 The prevailing story in this regard is that once Bhima goes out in search of property, he meets a yogi Nirbhayanath and a Yeti Kukadeswar on the way
 bhim ne yogi se paras pathar maanga, jise yogi is shart par dene ko raji hua ki vah is pahari sthaan par raaton-raat ek durg kaa nirmaan karvaa de

 On hearing the rooster's voice, Bhima got angry and gave a kick to the ground with anger, which made a big pit there, which people also know as the addiction pool

 There is a saying prevalent in relation to this fort, which explains the importance of this fort

 But from a strategic point of view it shows that due to its geographical reasons it was not suitable for fortification like fortifications like Ranthambore and Kubhalgarh

 On the edge of the hill was a row of rocks standing on top of which a high and strong type was built

 For all these reasons, it was very difficult for the enemies to enter the fort
 parantu yah vistrut maidan ke bich ek lambi pahari par bana he jo anya parvat shreniyon se pruthak ho gaya he
 Therefore, it was easily prevented by the enemies by encircling it and transporting the logistics used in the fort

 Storrer, while defining histology or ontology, wrote: Histology is the study of the structure and configuration of tissues within the microscopic body organs
 angareji kaa hystology shabd unani bhashaa ke shabd histos tathaa logia se milakar bana he, jinka arth hota he utakon kaa adhyayan
 Hence histology is the science under which the microstructure of tissues and their arrangement or configuration is studied
 'utak' shabd francisi bhashaa ke shabd tissue se niklaa he, jiskaa arth hota he sanrachana yaa banaavat 
 The term was first used by French body scientist Bisshat in the late 18th century in the context of body or anatomy
 unhone apni pustak main lagbhag bi prakaar ke utakon kaa ullekh kiya he
 However, nowadays only four types of main tissues are recognized, namely: epithylomy, connective, muscular and neural tissue
 adikaal se hi manushya pashu-pakshiyon or ped-paudhon ko unki akruti tathaa aakaar ke dwaara pahachaanata rahaa he
 With the development of science, curiosity was also generated to know the structure inside the body of flora and fauna
 isi jigyaasa ke falswaroop shalyakriya kaa vikaas hua
 Medical and biologists began to dissect animals and flora and study the structure of their organs - organ reactions
 isi adhyayan ke falswaroop sampurna sharir kii utpatti hui
 With this, when the microscope instruments developed, complex internal structures also became clear
 is sookshmdarsheey yantric adhyayan ko bhautikee kii sangya pradaan kii gai
 Therefore, in Bloom and Fawcett's words, 'under the body of microscopic or microscopic body comes the internal structure of the body which cannot be seen by naked eyes
 samast sajiv praaniyon kii sanrachanaatmak tathaa kriyaatmak ikai koshika hoti he
 The study of this cell is called cytology
 koshikaon ke punjon se utakon or utakon se angon kii rachana hoti hai
 The science that studies the structure of tissues is called physics and the science that studies the structure of organs is called body
 ootiki tathaa koshika vigyaan ke adhyayanon ke kaaran sharir ke durbhedya rahasyon kaa bhedan hota gaya
 Conducted studies of these two led to the development of optics-pathology
 san 1932 main nol evam raska ne electron sookshmdarshi kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase koshikaon tathaa utakon kii jatiltam saranchanaaon kaa spashtikaran hua
 Along with this, physiology also developed and new new mysteries were revealed
 is prakaar in teenon vigyaanon ke sammilit prayaas se jeevvaigyanik kshetra main abhootpurv kranti ai he
 Ecology and cytology mainly explain the morphological pattern of microstructures
 kintu jab se aneleen ranjakon kaa anveshan hua tab se koshikaon kii jatil sanrachanaon kaa bhi gyaan praapt hone laga he
 Today, hundreds of types of pigments are being used to shed light on microscopic structures
 is prakaar, ootiki ke kshetra main ab rasayanavigyaan kaa bhi pravesh ho gaya he
 Proper knowledge of chemical reactions of dyes is being gained by using regular stabilizers
 jeevadravya, koshika dravya tathaa unamem or koshikaon ke anek angakon kii rasinic sanrachanaon kaa gyaan ab sarsaadhaaran ke liye sulabh he
 How these organs perform specialized work is no longer unknown
 sookshm sanrachanaon kii rasinic prakruti ke adhyayan ko ootikirasayan yaa koshikarsayan kaha jaataa he or ab ootiki tathaa ootikirasayan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Helen Dean, there are three major categories of such studies: beli kii ootiki vishay par likhi pustak main utak vigyaan ke saath hi koshika vaigyanik adhyayan par bhi bal diya gaya he
 According to Bailey, since histology is a structural study and complements the anatomical knowledge gained by dissection, it is also necessary to emphasize its close connection with physiology and pathology
 
 According to them, the basis of histology is cytoplasm or cytology
 uparyukt vivaran se yah prakat hota he ki koshikavigyaan tathaa oothkavigyaan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 Since cells are microscopic structures, we will study histology by considering histology to be synonymous with microtubules
 chunki utak koshikaon dwaara hi bane hote hai, at: ootiki kaa adhyayan ham koshikaon ke hi madhyam se karenge
 For proper study of tissues, it is necessary that they are treated by special methods before bringing them to the microscope
 utak kaa sookshm adhyayan karne ke liye yah anivaary he ki vah ati patala ho
 Many similarities are found in different parts of living tissue
 at: uskaa thik thik adhyayan sambhav nahin hota
 To overcome these difficulties, tissue is first dissected from 4 to 8 microns
 is kaary ke liye 'microtome' yantra kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Such microscopic rupture of living tissue is not possible unless it is stiff
 at: utak ko kadaa karne ke liye use vishesh prakaar ke rasayanon ke ghol main sthaayeekrut kiya jaataa he
 After immobilization, this tissue is treated and sterilized in various solutions of alcohols, stains and other chemicals
 ant main ise vishesh taap par pehle se hi galaakar taiyaar rakhaa jaataa he, daal diya jaataa he
 After some time, pieces of tissue along with wax are put into a quadrilateral mold
 jab mom jamkar kadaa ho jaataa he, to uske chote chote tukade kaat liye jate hai
 Finally these pieces are deposited in a special part of the microtome and several sections of special thickness are cut with a sharpened knife
 in sectionon ko kaanch kii pattiyon par rakhkar adhyayan ke liye rakh liya jaataa he
 Wax is dissolved by placing the glass strips on the heating plate and the section of tissue freezes on the glass strip
 in sectionon se ladi kaanch kii pattiyon ko vishesh rasayanon tathaa alcohol ke gholon main nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 It is then soaked in dilene or sedar ud oil
 ab yah section sookshm adhyayan ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Internal microscopes are used for microscopic study of these sections
 aajkal utakon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye is prakaar ke microscopon kaa atyadhik prayog hone laga he
 For this microscopic study, methods of thermodynamic and radiation autocorrelation are being used
 ootikirasayan ke antargat utakon ke vibhinn bhaagon kii rasinic sanrachana kaa adhyayan hota he
 The radiation autoregression method involves the insertion of special types of radioisotopes into the specialized tissue of living organisms
 is prakaar se upachaarikrut utakon ko jantusharir se baahar nikaalkar section bana liye jate hai
 By taking these sections in the dark room, they are captured by special chemicals of photography, or placed under the film and tied firmly
 kuch samay baad inhen andhere kaksh se baahar nikaalkar sthaayeekrut kar liya jaataa he
 Thereafter, they are studied by bringing them into the light
 utakon kaa adhyayan unki sookshm sanrachana kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, a brief mention of the structure of the tissue is necessary
 utakon kii sanrachana main teen prakaar ke mukhya ghatak dikhalaai dete hai : koshikaaye, matrix tathaa taral dravya
 The unit of tissue is a cell
 koshikaaye sajiv hoti hai tathaa ve sabhi kaary karti hai, jinhen sajiv praani karte hai
 Their shape is minimal and shape is spherical, oval, columnar, porous, flagellate, polygonal etc
 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara aavrutt hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell membrane
 ise kabhi-kabhi jeev-dravya-kala bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - cendrak evam kendrika Organism golgi sammishra yaa yantra Kanabha sutra antarpradravya dalika Chromosomes and genes rebosom tathaa centrosom Lavak matrix yaa aadhatri ko intercellular yaa ground sabstens bhi kaha jaataa he
 As is clear from the name itself, it is located in the central part of the cells and works to connect them together
 ye sajiv tathaa nirjeev donon prakaar kii hoti hai
 Ordinarily found in connective tissues
 yah tantu yaa reshon dwaara bani hoti he, jo teen prakaar ke hote hai : kolazanee, jalidaar tathaa elastic 
 It is a homogeneous or homogeneous material that lives in liquid or gelatin-like conditions
 yah upakalaa, koshikaon tathaa choti-choti shiraaon ke neeche jami rahati he
 It contains mucopolysaccharide acids
 aadhatri komal tathaa drudh donon prakaar kii hoti he
 Tissues also contain fluids, of which blood and lymph are the main ones
 ye donon aashyon athwa nalikaaon se hokar pravaahit hote hai
 Tissue keeps liquid cells moisturized
 adhatu ke hi kaaran sharir kaa swaroop bana rahata he
 The body of an animal is really nothing else, but a palace of intracellular matter or half, in which the bricks of billions of cells of many color forms and sizes are selected
 ye koshikaaye apane utpaadon kaa aadan pradaan karti hui apana jivan vyateet karti rahati hai
 Histology also gives proper information about the organs of the body
 angatantron kii saranchana, rasinic prakruti evam kaarividhiyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye utak vigyaan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he

 As a form of content management, enterprise content management is a combined form of document collection, discovery and networking with digital archiving, document management, and work-in-progress
 isamen vishesh rup se kisi company ke aantarik, aksar avyavasthit jaankariyon ko iske sabhi swaroopon main istemaal or sangrakshan main shaamil vishesh chunautiyaan sammilit hai
 Therefore most ECM solutions focus on business-to-employee systems
 jab se isiem samaadhaan viksit hua he, nae ghatak ubharkar saamne aaye hai
 For example, the way content moves in and out, each time it is used creates a new metadata about the content; Somewhat automatically; Information about when and how the material was used allows the system to gradually adapt to new filtering, routing and search routes, corporate classifications and semantic networks, and decisions about rules of memorization
 is

 Thus ECM is a collection of basic components that fit a multi-level model and includes all documentation techniques for use, handing and joint management of systematic data and disorganized information
 jaise ki udhyam saamagree prabandhan atirikt i-vyapaar anuprayog kshetra ke liye aavashyak buniyadi ghatakon main se ek he
 The ECM also facilitates the management of all the information of a WCM and includes storage requirements as a universal repository
 isiem un ghatakon ko jodta he jinhen ek udhyam-aadhaarit pranali main shaamil kiye bagaiyr swatantra pranaaliyon ke rup main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Five ECM components and techniques were first defined by AIIM as capture, manage, store, preserve and deliver
 capchar main kuch yaa sabhi tarah kaa ankiyakaran, pratilipi taiyaar karnaa yaa jodna, safai karnaa or dastavejon kaa anukraman / vargeekaran shaamil hota he
 The techniques being used range from obtaining simple information to automated classification
 capchar ke ghatakon ko aksar input ghatak bhi kaha jaataa he
 Earlier document automation systems used to take photographs of documents for storage on microfilm or microfiche
 optical scinar ab kagaji dastavejon kii digital pratiyaan taiyaar karti hai
 Pre-existing documents can be copied digitally or a link can be added if they are already available online
 automatic yaa semi-automatic capchar, sroton ke rup main idiai yaa exmel dastavejon, bijness or iarpy aplicationon yaa maujuuda visheshgy aplicoshan pranaaliyon kaa istemaal kar sakati hai
 Various validation techniques can be used to extract information from scanned documents and digital faxes, including: image clyaap suvidhaon main roteshan, sidhaa karnaa, rangon kaa samaayojan, pratisthaapan, zum, sanrekhan, pej alag karnaa, tippaniyan or despekaling shaamil hai
 Two sets of techniques exist in forms capture, although the information content and the character of the documents may be similar
 forms processing, scanning ke madhyam se printed formon ko capchar karnaa he; yahan aksar pahchaan kii takneekon kaa istemaal hota he, kyonki acchhee tarah se dizin kiye gaye forms kaaphi had tak automatic processing ko sakasham banaate hai
 Automatic processing can be used to capture electronic forms, such as forms submitted via web pages, as long as the capture system is aware of the layout, structure, logic, and contents
 computer output tu lager discs isiem pranaaliyon dwaara chal rahe prabandhan ke liye reporton or anya dastavejon ko optical discon par yaa digital bhandaaran ke kisi bhi swarup main record karata he
 Another term for this is enterprise report management
 multah yah takanic keval leserdiskon ke saath kaam karti thi; anya takneekon dwaara leserdisk kii jagah lene ke baad bhi iskaa naam nahin badla gaya tha
 Aggregation connects documents to various applications
 iskaa lakshya vibhinn sroton se aankadon ko ekajute karnaa or unhen ek samaan sanrachana evam swaroop main bhandaaran evam processing pranaaliyon ko agrasaarit karnaa he
 Indexing improves search and provides an alternative way to organize information
 hastchalit anukraman saamagree ko haathon se index database kii visheshtaayen pradaan karata he, vishesh rup se prashasan or pahunch ke liye ek "prabandh" ghatak ke database dwaara istemaal kii gayi saamagree
 hastchalit anukraman shaamil kii jane vaali jaankariyon ko simit karne ke liye input diginon kaa istemaal kar sakati he; udhaaharan ke liye, intry mask dastavej ke bare main gyaat anya jaankaree ke aadhaar par program logic kaa istemaal kar sakati he yaa inputs ko roak sakati he
 The indexing of both automatic and manual features can be made easier and better with predefined input-design profiles; They can describe classes of documents that limit possible index values or automatically apply certain criteria
 swachaalit vargeekaran kaarykram index, shrenee ko nikaal sakate hai or aankadon ko swatantra rup se hastantarit kar sakate hai
 Automated classification or categorization based on information contained in electronic information items can evaluate information based on predefined criteria or a self-learning process
 is takanic ko osiar-parivartit faixon, karyaalay kii filon, yaa output filon ke saath prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The management category includes five traditional application areas: prabandhan shrenee anya ghatakon ko jodatii he jinhen sanyukt rup se yaa alag se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Document management, web content management, collaboration, work-in-progress and business process management work on the dynamic part of the information lifecycle
 records prabandhan sanghathan kii dastavej avdhaaran niti ke anusaar antim rup se taiyaar dastavejon ke prabandhan par dhyaan kendrit karata he, jiske badale ise sarkaar ke adeshon or udyog kii prathaon kaa aavashyak rup se anupaalan karnaa padataa he
 All components of management incorporate databases and access authentication systems
 prabandhan ke ghatakon kii peshkash vyaktigat rup se yaa suits ke rup main ekikrut kar kii jaati he
 In many cases they already include "store" components
 is sandarbh main dastauez prabandhan kaa matlab mote taur par nirmaan se lekar sangrah tak dastavejon kaa niyantran karnaa he
 Document management includes such tasks as: haalaanki, dastauez prabandhan "prabandhan" ke anya ghatakon ke saath, offis aplicationon jaise ki microsoft outluk or exange, yaa lotus nots or domino evam soochna bhandaaran ke niyantran ke liye "librari sevaaon" adhik se adhik istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The components of collaboration in an ECM system help users to develop and process content with each other
 in ghatakon main se kai sahyogaatmak software yaa grupware, packejon se viksit kiye gaye the; isiem sahyogi pranaliyaan isse kahin adhik aage badhati hai or isamen jaankaree prabandhan ke tatv shaamil hote hai
 ECM systems facilitate collaboration using databases and processing methods of information that are designed for use by multiple users simultaneously, even when all users are working on the same content item 
 ve jaankaree aadhaarit yogyataon, sansadhano or sanyukt jaankaree kii processing ke liye prishthbhumi sambandhi aankade kaa istemaal karte hai
 Administration components such as virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, appointment scheduling and project management systems, communication-related applications such as video conferencing, etc
 can be included
 sahyogaatmak isiem anya aplicationon se bhi jaankaree ko ekikrut kar saktaa he jisase sanyukt soochna processing main madad milti he
 Enterprise content management can integrate web content management systems
 haalanki, web ke madhyam se prastut isiem jaankaree - internet, extranet yaa ek portal par - keval vahi data hona chahie jo pehle se company main maujuud he, jisaki delivery pahunch pramann or bhandaaran dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Many people in this industry do not consider web content management as an integral part of ECM
 safal karyanvayan ke kuch hi udhaaharan maujuud hai jinase dastavejon ke liye ek saajha ripogitary or web saamagree kaa ek saath prabandhan kiya jaataa he
 Very different techniques and principles are used to structure and organize the content, and for the external oriented document content as compared to the internal oriented document content
 paaramparik electronic sangrahan pranaaliyon ke vipareet records prabandhan kaa matlab recordon, mahatvapurn jaankaree or company ke sangrah ke liye aavashyak data kaa vishuddh niyantran he
 Records management is independent of storage media; Managed information does not necessarily need to be stored electronically, but it can also be on a traditional physical media
 records prabandhan ke kaaryon main se kuch hai: Work progress and business process management vary to a great extent
 vibhinn prakaar ke varkelo hai: production varkelo jo maargdarshan or niyantran prakriyaaon ke liye purvanirdhaarit anukramon kaa upyog karata he jabaki ek aid-hoque workelo main upyogkarta swatantra rup se prakriya ke anukram ko nirdhaarit karata he
 Workflows can be implemented as workflow solutions or workflow engines that serve as a background service to control the flow of information and data
 workelo prabandhan main nimnlikhit kaary shaamil hai: Its purpose is to automate processes as much as possible by including all the necessary resources
 vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan varkelo kii tulana main ek kadam aage bad jaataa he
 Although the terms are often used interchangeably, BPM aims to fully integrate all affected applications within an enterprise, monitoring processes and assembling all the necessary information
 bipiem ke kaaryon main shaamil hai: BPM provides full functionality of the workflow, facilitating process and data monitoring at the server level
 udhyam anuprayog ekikaran kaa upyog vibhinn aplicationon ke saath sambandh jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Business acumen, along with rule structures, integrates information warehouses and provides utilities that help users in their work
 sangrah ke ghatak un jaankariyon ko asthaayee rup se sanchit karte hai jo aavashyak nahin he yaa jinhen sanchit karnaa vaanchit he
 Even if archive components use tools that are suitable for long-term archiving, "archiving" still differs from "security"
 sangrah ke ghatakon ko teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he: ripogitries, sangrah ke sthanon ke rup main, librari sevaayen, ripogitries ke liye prashasnic ghatakon ke rup main or sangrah kii takneekein 
 in buniyadi ghatakon ko kabhi-kabhi oparating system str par rakhaa jaataa he or isamen un suraksha takneekon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he jo "deliver" ghatakon ke saath milakar kaam karte hai
 However security technologies including access control are the preferred components of an ECM solution
 vibhinn prakaar kii isiem ripogitries ko sanyukt rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Possible types include: librari sevaayen isiem pranali ke prashasnic ghatak hai jo jaankaree tak pahunch kaa sanchaalan karte hai
 The library is responsible for receiving and storing information from components of service acquisition and management
 yah gatisheel bhandaaran main bhandaaran ke sthanon kaa prabandhan karata he, vaastavik "sangrah" or lambey samay ke sangrakshit sangrah main
 bhandaaran kaa sthaan keval soochna kii visheshtaon or vargikarnon dwaara hi nirdhaarit hota he
 The library service works closely with the components of the management database to facilitate the tasks required for search and retrieval
 jabaki database ko kisi sanchit vastu ke vaastavik sthaan kaa pataa "gyaat" nahin hota he, librari seva online bhandaaran ,najdiki bhandaaran or ofline bhandaaran kaa prabandhan karti he
 If the document management system does not provide its functionality, the library service must necessarily have version management facilities in order to control the information state and arrival / exit for the controlled information system
 librari seva soochna ke upyog or sampadan ke log taiyaar karti he jise ek "audit trail" kaha jaataa he
 a wide variety of technologies can be used to store information that depends on the application and system environment: antat saamagree ko badalane se roak diya jaataa he or yah sthir ho jaataa he
 The protection components of ECM operate for long-term, secure storage and backup of static information, as well as temporary storage of information that does not need to be stored
 electronic sangrahan ek sambandhit avadharana he jo isiem sangrakshan ghatakon kii tulana main vyapak kaaryakshmata rakhti he
 Electronic storage systems typically include a combined form of administrative software such as records management, imaging or document management, library services or information retrieval systems and storage subsystems
 media ke anya swarup bhi dirghakaalik sangrahan ke liye upyukt hai
 If the desire is only to ensure the future availability of information, microfilm is still viable; Unlike many digital records, microfilm is readable without access to any specific software from which it is made
 hybrid pranaliyaan microfils ko electronic media or database-samarthit pahunch se jodatii hai
 Long-term storage systems require timely planning and routine performance of data migration in order to keep information available in a constantly changing technological landscape
 jaise-jaise bhandaaran takneekein istemaal se baahar ho jaati hai, jaankariyon ko bhandaaran ke nae swaroopon main sthanantarit karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he, jisase ki samakaleen pranaaliyon kaa istemaal karte hue sanchit jaankaree tak pahunch bani rahe
 For example, if floppy disk drives are no longer readily available, the data stored on a floppy disk becomes essentially useless; Transferring the accumulated data on the floppy disk to the compact disk not only preserves the data but also makes it possible to obtain it
 is satat prakriya ko continyus migration kehete hai
 Protection components include special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long-term storage media
 soochna kii dirghakaalik uplabdhta surakshit karne ke liye electronic sangrahan main vibhinn ranneetiyon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Continuous transfer of objects from applications, index data, metadata and old systems to new systems generates many functions but secures access and usability of information
 is prakriya ke dauraan waisi soochnaaon ko jo ab praasangik nahin he mitaa diya ja saktaa he
 Conversion techniques are used where necessary to update the format of accumulated information
 puraane software kaa anukaran upyogkartaaon ko mul data or vastuon ko sanchalit karne or in tak pahunchaane kii anumati detaa he
 Special Viewer software can identify the nature of protected objects and display objects in a new software environment
 jaankaree kii uplabdhta surakshit karne ke liye interphes, metadata, data sanrachanaon or uddeshy praroopon ke maanak mahatvapurn hai
 The delivered components of ECM present information from the management, storage, storage and preservation components
 isiem ke liye eim ghatak model kaary-aadhaarit hai or ye ek sakht padanukram ko lagu nahin karte hai; deliver ghatak main anya pranaaliyon main jaankariyon ko daalane ke liye istemaal karne vaale kaary shaamil ho sakate hai deliver shrenee kii kaaryakshmata ko "output" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he; is shrenee main takneekon ko aksar output prabandhan kaha jaataa he
 The delivered components are divided into three groups: conversion technology, security technology, and distribution
 Conversion and security as services act as intermediaries and should be uniformly available across all ECM components
 output ke liye do kaary mukhya rup se mahatvapurn hai: leout or dizin, ruparekha taiyaar karne or formating output ke liye tuls ke saath, vitaran or prakaashan ke liye soochna prastut karne vaale aplicationon sahit
 Conversion should always be controlled and detectable
 yah kaary prishthbhumi sevaaon ke jariye kiya jaataa he jise antim upyogkarta aam taur par nahin dekh paata he
 Conversion techniques include: suraksha takneekein sabhi isiem ghatakon ke liye uplabdh hai
 For example, electronic signatures are used not only when sending documents but also in capturing data through scanning in order to record the completeness of the capture
 public kii infrastracchar electronic hastakshar ke liye ek buniyadi takanic he
 It manages keys and certificates and checks the authenticity of the signature
 anya electronic hastakshar preshak kii pahchaan or bheje gaye data kii shuddhta kii pushti karte hai yani ki yah purna or aparivartit he
 There are three types of electronic signatures of varying quality and safety in Europe: Simple, Advanced and Qualified
 In most European states, qualified electronic signatures are legally valid in legal documents and contracts
 digital adhikaar prabandhan or watermarking kaa istemaal bauddhik sampada adhikaron or copirite ke prabandhan or suraksha ke liye saamagree sindication or media sampatti prabandhan main kiya jaataa he
 Digital rights management works with technologies such as electronic watermarks that are directly integrated into the file and which require the protection of the right to use and the content published on the Internet
 uparokt sabhi takneekein upyogkartaaon ko ek isiem kii samagriyan vibhinn margon se ek niyantrit or upyogkarta-unmukh tareeke se pradaan karne main madad karti hai
 These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos and passive publications on websites and portals, where users can access the information themselves
 sambhavit output or vitaran media main shaamil hai: The various components of Deliver provide information for the given application to the users in a better way by controlling its use as much as possible
