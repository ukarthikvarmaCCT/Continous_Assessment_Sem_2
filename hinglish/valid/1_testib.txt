 Samaraveer Gokula is a national poem of the seventeenth century peasant revolution
 iske rachayita rajasthan ke sammanit evam puraskrit kaviver shri balvir singh 'karun' hai
 He has been decorated with the title of Aksharputra of Dinkar ji in the deliberations of Karun ji Nalanda, inspired by the poetry of Rashtrakavi Dinkar
 ] This powerful and intelligent poet has brought to life a neglected chapter of the seventeenth century by composing a poetic poem called 'samaraveer Gokula'
 varna-jati or swarg-apvarg kii chintaa karne vaala yah desh jab tab apane ko bhul jaataa he
 Like Khaz in the leprosy, the leftist historian and litterateur removes pages from the history of the autonomous struggle

 The result is 'samaraveer Gokula'

 His inspiration was the national spirit
 aadhunik yug main balvir singh 'karun' ne 'vijay ketu' or 'main dronacharya bolta hoon' ke baad ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak main 'samar vir gokula' kii bhavy prastuti kii he
 This is a testimony to the poise of 'vijay Ketu' and the flourishing of progressive history vision
 kavi ne bhoomika main likhaa he- maharana pratap, maharana raaj singh, chhatrapati shivaji, hasan khan mewati, guru govind singh, mahavir gokula tathaa bharatpur ke jat shaskaon ke alaava aise or adhik naam nahin ginaye ja sakate jinhone mughal satta ko khulkar lalakaara ho
 Veer Gokula should be named prominently because he laughed under the nose of Delhi and set up an army of 20 thousand peasant soldiers, who were unpaid, untrained and equipped with domestic weapons
 yah baat vistaar ke liye na bhuulakar raashtra kii raksha hetu pranarpan karne aaye the
 The inspiration of this poem was such that it was written in just forty days
 iskaa mahaduddeshy aisa ki bhartiya itihaas kaa ek sangharkshil adhyay kavyarup dhaaran kar kavyangat main dhyaan aakrisht karne laga
 Medieval gallantry and martyrdom came alive in national consciousness and started echoing in management
 upeshit jat kisaan kaa tejomay samarpit vyaktitv apane tej se damak uthaa
 In history, the character of the repressed Narnahar Gokul came in front of everyone in the verses
 aath sargon kaa yah prabandhkavy ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak kaa mahatvapurn avdaan he
 The poet has endured the suffering of Gokul born in the peasant clan of Mathura
 us peeda ne rashtriya sandarbh main upekshit ko kavyanjali dene kaa prayaas kiya he
 The poet has presented the peasant personality of Gokul to the Mughal emperor in the first session
 ucchkul ke naayakatv ke nikash ko gokul ne badal diya tha
 So, how long would Gokul be ignored in the era of upliftment of the peasant-worker-dalit! He struggled vigorously for the survival and identity of peasant life

 Resolved to oppose peasant repression by foreign Mughal rule

 samgaan MP3 recording componant video ek prakaar kaa video signal he jise do yaa adhik ghatakon main vibhajit kar diya gaya he
 In popular usage, it refers to a type of analog video information that is transmitted or stored as three different signals
 componant video, compozit, pieel yaa esaisieem ) video se is prakaar bhinn hota he ki isamen samast video soochna maatr ek hi line-level signal main sanyukt hoti he
 Like composite, component video cable is also not audio and is often coupled with audio cable
 jab is shabd ko anya kisi visheshan ke bina prayog kiya jaataa he to componant video kaa saamaanya arth luma par sinc ke saath analog vypibipiar componant video se hota he
 Reproduction of a video signal on a display device) is a straightforward process that is complicated by a group of signal sources
 dividi, vieches, computer or video game consol, yah sabhi bhinn madhyamon dwaara signlon ko sanchit karte hai, sansaadhit karte hai or sanchaarit karte hai tathaa praayah hi inamen se prayek ek se adhik signal vikalp pradaan karata he
 One way to maintain signal clarity is to isolate the components of the video signal so that they do not interfere with each other
 The signal thus separated is called "component video"
 es-video, arjibi or vypibipiar signlon main do yaa adhik signal sammilit hote hai: atah yah sabhi componant video signal hai
 In applications used by most users, analog component video is used
 dhire-dhire digital componant video, computer or home-theatre donon main hi prachlit hota ja rahaa he
 Component video is capable of transmitting signals such as 480i, 480p, 576i, 576p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p, and new high definition tvs provide support for using component video up to their original resolution
 vibhinn arjibi analog componant video maanak, arjibiechavi, arji and esabi ) kisi bhi prakaar ke sampeden kaa prayog nahin karte or rangon kii gaharaai yaa rizolyushan ke liye koi vaastavik seemaa adhiropit nahin karte, lekin signal ke sancharan ke liye inhen vrahat bandwidth kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or ye adhikansh atirikt aankadon kaa vahan karte hai kyonki saamanyatya prayek madhyam ek hi blike and white chitra kaa prayog karata he
 Most modern computers provide this signal through a VGA port
 adhikansh television, visheshkar europe main, esasiearti sanyojak ke dwaara arjibi kaa prayog karte hai
 All arcade games use RGB monitors except for the early vector and black and white games
 dhire-dhire analog arjibi kaa prachlan kam hota ja rahaa he kyonki computer disple port or digital video ke dwaara adhik acchhee spashtataa praapt kar rahe hai, jabaki home theatre main ab adhiktar echdiemai kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 Despite the quality and suitability, analog RGB has mostly been disregarded, as it is not easy to construct for digital rights management
 upabhokta electronics ke liye uttari america main arjibi kabhi bhi bahut prachlit nahin tha kyonki es-video ko upabhokta prayog ke liye paryaapt samajha jaataa tha, haalanki vyapaarik, vyavsaayik or ucch instoleshannon main arjibi kaa prayog vyapak str par ho rahaa tha
 RGB requires additional signals to harmonize with the video display
 iske liye kai tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he: Composite sync is very common in the European SCART contact scheme
 kabhi-kabhi ek purnataya compojit video ek sinc signal ke rup main bhi kaary kar saktaa he, haalanki computer monitor praayah atirikt video data ko sambhaal paane main asamarth hote hai
 a full composite sync video signal requires four wires - red, green, blue, sync
 If different wires were used, the sink wire was usually kept in white color
 vijie main safed sinc sarvaadhik prachlit he, yah analog computer monitoron par vishwavyaapee str par prayog kii jaati he
 It is also sometimes referred to as RGBHV, because horizontal and vertical synchronization vibrations are sent by different means
 is mod ke liye paanch suchalkon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If separate wires are used, the sink line is usually yellow and white, or yellow and black, or gray and black
 green par sinc sarvaadhik kam prachlit hai or haalanki kuch vijie monitor iske samaayojan kaa samarthan karte hai, lekin adhikansh nahin karte
 soni sog kaa ek bada samarthak he or unke adhikansh monitor video game consol) iskaa prayog karte hai
 For devices that are composite video or S-video, sog devices also require additional circuits to remove the sync signal from the green line
 ek monitor jo sog samanjan ke anukool nahin he use sog input die jane par, yadi vah kisi chitra kaa pradarshan karegaa to vah chitra bhi atyadhik hari rang kii chaaya se yukt hoga
 Other types of component analog video signals do not use R, g and b components, but instead use a colorless component called a luma, which gives information about brightness
 It combines with one or more color-transmitting components, known as chroma, which provide information only about color
 dividi player par dikhaayi padane vaale, es-video component video output or vypibipiar componant video output, donon hi is madhyam ke udahaaran hai
 Converting videos to luma and chroma leads to a sub-sampling of chroma, a method used by JPEG images and DVD players to reduce the storage needs of images and videos
 aaj jab log componant video ke vishay main baat karte hai to saamanyatya unka aashay ypbpr skim se hota he
 Many consumer DVD players, high-definition displays, video projectors, and other such devices use this format of color manuals
 aamtaur par, galati se yah conection "YUV", "Y / R-Y / B-Y" and Y, B-Y, R-ya jaise shabdon dwaara chinhit hote hai
 It is impure because YUV, ypbpr and y BY RY vary in their measurement components
 jab iskaa prayog kisi video strot ko video disple se jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jahaan ki donon hi 4:3 or 16:9 disple praaroop ke anusaar samanjit hon, pieel television maanak spandanon kaa signal pradaan karata he jo swachaalit rup se disple ko ek praaroop se duusare praaroop main badal degaa
 Examples of international component video standards are: bhram kaa ek sambhavit strot yah ho saktaa he ki shabdon componant or compojit ke bich maatr kuch hi aksharon kaa antar he
 The connectors of component video are not specific because the same connector is used for many different parameters; Therefore, making a component video connection often does not lead to satisfactory transfer of the video signal
 They may need to be adjusted to indicate the type of input / output used in many DVD players and tvs, and if this adjustment is incorrect, images will not be displayed properly
 For example, sequential scans are not activated as a default adjustment, even after the component video out put is selected

 Some geographers divide the indo-gangetic Plain into several parts: the Indus Valley, the plains of Punjab, the plains of Haryana, and the middle and lowlands of the Ganges
 These regional differences are mainly based on the availability of water

 Therefore, such a large number of animals must have attracted a large number of carnivorous animals as well
 Wolves, jackals, striped laggards, Indian cheetahs and Asiatic lions may have hunted heavily on the open plains while tigers and leopards may have hunted in the surrounding forests
 The Ganges was home to a large number of gharial, crocodiles and dolphins found in the river, which controlled the number of fishes and occasional herds crossing the river

 Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas was a renowned sociologist of India
 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'

 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank

 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega

 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 The Srimath, situated on His Holiness Panchganga Ghat in Kashi, has been continuously promoting the same vigorous tradition by becoming the main center of the holy stream of Shri Ram Prapati flowing by Acharyapada
 aaj bhi shrimath acharyacharan kii pariklpana ke anuroop unke dwaara prajjwalit deep se janamanas ko aalokit kar rahaa he

 His imaginations, his knowledge, his eloquence and best of all his generosity and combative consciousness are such that it is believed that Swami Ramanand's personality must have been
 vartmaan jagadguru ramanandaarch pad pratishthit swami ramanareshacharya ji maharaj ke satprayaason kaa nateeja he ki shrimath se kabhi alag ho chuki kabirdasiya, ravidasiya, ramsnehi, prabhruti paramparaayen vaishnav ke sutara main bandhakar shrimath se ekarupata sthapit kar rahi he

 Swami Ramanand is considered to be an epochal teacher in the history of Ramopasana

 In place of Narayana Mantra of srivaishnavas, Ramataraka or the conspirator Ram Mantra is considered the seed of communal initiation
 Instead of external virtue, he emphasized the purity of the inner spirit in sadhana, eradicating untouchability, high and low, and supported equality in Vaishnavism
 navdha se para or premasakti ko shreykar bataaya
 At the same time, in the promotion of principles, Hindi or the public language gave priority to the traditional Sanskrit language

 From the point of view of elements and ethics, he wrote many classical texts such as Vaishnavamtab Bhaskar, Sriramapatla, Sriramarchanapaddhati, Sriram Rakshastrotam
 swami ramanand ke dwaara di gai desh-dharm ke prati in amuly sevaaon ne sabhi sampradaayon ke vaishnavon ke hriday main unka mahatv sthapit kar diya
 In the communal history of India, so much popularity among the followers of conflicting principles and practices could not be achieved by any of the sect promoters before them
 maharashtra ke nathpanthiyon ne gyandev ke pita vitthal pant ke guru ke rup main unhen puja, advait mataavalambiyon ne jyotirmath ke brahmacharee ke rup main unhen apanaaya
 babaripanth ke santon ne apane sampradaay ke pravartak maanakar unki vandana kii or kabir ke guru to ve the hi, isli kabirpanthiyon main unka aadar swaabhaavik he
 The secret of this viciousness of the personality of swami-ramanand lies in his liberal and persuasive tendencies and co-ordinating ideology
 nishchay hin unke viraat vyaktitv evam vyapak mahatta ke anuroop katipay arshgranth evam sant-sahitya main ullekith unke ramavatar hone kaa varnan aksharsh: pramanit hota he

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class

 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea

 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians

 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia

 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture

 uske likhe hue aath granth hai, jinamein prapanchashaastra, nyaay ke siddhant evam darshanik siddhanton k vishwakosh, ye teen granth visheshtya ullekhneey hai
 Hegel's philosophical views may be said to be particularly influenced by the ideas of philosophers of German-country, Korn, Fikte, and Schelling, although there are significant differences between Hegel's and his ideas
 hegel kaa darshan nirpeksh pratyaywad yaa chidwad athwa vastugat chaitanyavad kehalaata he; kyonki unke mat main aatma-anatma, drashtaa-drishy, evam prakruti-purush sabhi padaarth ek hi nirpeksh gyanaswaroop param tatv yaa sat kii vibhinn abhivyaktiyaan hai
 According to him, the world is neither the result of unconscious nature or the puddles, nor the game of mind of any individual
 jad-chetan-gun-dosha-may samast sansar main ek hi aseem, anadi evam anant chetan tatv, jise ham parabrahm kah sakate hai, otprot he
 There is no power of any substance other than that
 vah nirpeksh chid yaa parabrahm hi apane aapaki apni hi swaabhaavik kriya se vividh vastuon yaa naiysargik ghatnaon ke rup main satat prakat karata rahata he
 He does not need any other means or material separate from him
 hegel ke anusaar pudgalaatmak vishwa or hamaare tan, paraspar bhinn hone par bhi, ek hi nirpeksh sakriy parabrahm kii abhivyaktiyaan hone ke naate ek duusare se ghanishthatapurvak sambandhit evam aviyojya hai
 In Hegel's view, the whole developmental activity of the world is the activity of the active Brahman
 kya jad kya chetan, sabhi padaarth or praani usee ek nirpeksh vidrup sat ke simit yaa parichhinn vyakt rup hai
 In the form of herbal nature, animal flora, conscious animal and self-conscious humans, the same parabrahma expresses itself and in its still manifestations the supreme self-assured human being is the supreme expression, whose philosophical, religious and artistic succession is the creation of Brahman itself
 Personal purpose is served
 duusare shabdon main, brahm apane aapako vishwa ke vividh padaarthon ke rup main prakat karke hi apana vikaas karata he
 Thus, Hegel's Absolute Brahman is an active tangible universal or dynamic and concrete universal element, not an abstract universal
 vah shankaracharya ke brahm ke sadrush na to shant yaa kutasth he or na bhedashunya
 Hegel has sharply criticized all nonchalant Brahmists by referring to Shailing's inscrutable Brahman as a dark night in which all cows of diverse colors appear black
 shaling charaachartmak samast vishwa kii aavirbhuti brahm se sweekaar karte hue bhi use sab prakaar ke bhedon se rahit tathaa prapanch ke pare maane the
 But Hegel did not seem to be justified in accepting the rise or development of a non-discordant, elemental and distinct dynamic world
 unhone brahm ko vishwathit nahin mana
 Hegel's Brahmo resembles Sriramanujacharya's God to some extent
 ve, shriramanujacharya kii tarah, brahm ke sajaateey vijaateey bhed to nahin maanate, parantu usamen swagatbhed avashya sweekaar karte hai
 They have accepted it as a non-discriminatory impulse or plural unity, not as pure imperviousness or blank unity
 isi prakaar, shriramanujacharya kaa siddhant bhi vishishtadvait he, shuddhadvait yaa advait nahin
 The "sarva Khalvidam Brahman" of the Hegel Chandogyopanishad, the "purusha Avedam Sarvam" of the Rigveda and the "sarvatha Parinpavam" etc
 of the Srimadbhagavadgita can be called approvers
 parantu manducopanishad ke "amaatrashchaturtho%vyavhaarya: prapanchopashma


" siddhant ke maananevaale nahin
 Hegel considered Brahm's soul expression to occur in different forms of the functional and dynamic world according to a particular rational or intellectual law
 unka kahana tha ki satya yauktik he or yauktik satya he
 In other words, according to him the rule of intellectual thought and the rule of development of the world is the same and he has stated this rule as the law of opposition or opposition
 iske anusaar jadaatmak jagat evam vaiyaktik man donon hi ke rup main nirpeksh brahm ke vikaas kaa hetu us tatv kaa aantarik virodh yaa vyaghaat hi he
 According to Hegel, two opposing or mutually opposing thoughts or substances co-ordinate into a third thought or substance
 udaahranarth, hamaare man main sarvapratham "sat" kaa vichaar udai hota he, yaa yon kahie ki sansar ke samast padaarthon kii aadi avasthaa "sat" hi he
 But "only Sat" or "sanatr" is virtually identical
 at: sat ke antsthal main hi asat yaa abhaav sannihit he
 And this antipathy of Sat Assat becomes the root of future development of Sat
 chunki vipratipatti yaa virodh yauktik vichaar ko sahya nahin, at: yah swabhaav se hi uske niraakaran kii ore agrasar ho jaataa he tathaa sat or asat naamak virdohi pratyayon ke samanvay kaa nishpaadan "bhav" naamak pratyay main kar detaa he
 Hegel calls the initial suffix as paksha or nighan, his adversary suffix as the counterpart or counterpart and his matching suffix coordinate or redress, and his entire process oriented to this side is known as antagonism coordination justice or duality-coordination method or trikavav
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "sat" paksh, "asat" pratipaksh tathaa "bhav" samanvay he
 Thus, in Hegel's opposition-coordination-justice, favor, counterparty, and coordination are the sum of all three
 ise kuch or adhik spasht rup se samajhane ke liye ham apane bahya gyaan ko len or dekhen ki usamen yah niyam kis prakaar lagu hota he
 According to Hegel's statement, one has external knowledge only when the subject of the first known object is opposed by the subject or subject, and then the subject is distinguished from that subject and contains itself
 yahan "vishayi" paksh tathaa "vishay" pratipaksh he or unka samanvay vishayi dwaara praapt vishay sambandhi gyaan se hota he
 In fact, in Hegel's view, the progress of the idea and the development of the whole world is, essentially, in accordance with this opposition to coordinated justice
 unhone anubhav yaa sansar ke praaia: sabhi kshetron kii vyakhya main is nyaay kii prayuktata ko pradarshit karne kaa du:saadhy kintu prashansaneey praytn kiya he
 His statement is that everything that happens in the world is according to this rule and consequently new distinctions or substances continue to emerge
 koi bhi bhed kabhi bhi nirpeksh pratyay yaa parabrahm ke baahar nahin hota or na vah brahm hi kabhi praapanchik padaarthon se pruthak hota he parantu sansar main kabhi brahm kii sambhavyataaon kaa ant nahin hota or is drushti se ham use sansarathit bhi kah sakate hai
 Hegel has tried to coordinate all the past, present and future distinctions in this Brahman or absolute suffix
 "hegel kaa brahm vyakti he athwa nahin ?" yah prashn vivadagrast he
 Haldane etc
 Pandit considers him a person; But Prof
 In the opinion of scholars like mctaggart etc
, that person cannot be called
 hegel, nihsandeh, ek kattar satkarywaadee vichaarak the
 According to him, the work also exists before its expression in its cause
 vastut: ve kaaran evam kaary tathaa guni or gun ko ek duusare se abhinn or anyonyashrith maanate the
 Just as a work cannot exist in the absence of reasons or a virtue cannot remain without virtue, similarly, in Hegel's opinion, no event or object can be called causal even in the absence of work, just as virtue cannot exist without virtue
 
 hegel kaa nirpeksh pratyay yaa brahm, jise ve kabhi kabhi ishwar bhi kehete hai, kaant kii "parmaarthik yaa apane aapmen kii vastuon" ke sadrush agyeya nahin
 He can become the subject of our thinking, because we and our contemplation, despite being intellectually inclined, correspond to the same
 duusare shabdon main chunki hamaare simit vichaar ke niyam vahi hai jo saarvbhaum ishwar yaa uske vichaarrup vishwa ke, at: vah hamen buddhi dwaara avgat ho saktaa he
 With this thoughtful attempt by Hegel, he undoubtedly did the insurmountable task of bridging the gap that Kant had dug between the material and practical things, describing them as unknowable and knowable respectively
 hegely darshan, ek atyant mahatvapurn, utkrisht evam utkar bauddhik prayaas hone par bhi, aapattiyon se mukt nahin
 Against it, the following things can be presented briefly- vijden cricketrs' almnaak cricket kii ek sandarbh pustak he jise united kingdom main prativarsh prakashit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered the world's most famous sports reference book
 vijden kii sthapana 1864 main angreji cricketer jon vijden dwaara fred liliwhite ke da guide tu cricketrs ke pratiyogi ke rup main kii gayi thi
 Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted even today, making it the longest running sports annual in history
 chatha sanskaran iske vartmaan sheershak ke tahat pehla prakashit ank tha; pehle paanch sanskaran da cricketrs almnaak ke rup main prakashit hue the jisamen "es" ke pehle apostroke kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The Cricket Reporting Agency was established in 1880 by Charles Pardon along with George Kelly King
 1887 main parden ke vijden kaa sampadak banane ke samay se sampadak ke rup main ve lagbhag hameshaa ek siaare partner rahe the or siaare almnaak ke sampadakeey nirmaan ke liye jimmedaar the, jab tak ki 1965 main press association ke saath iskaa vilay nahin ho gaya
 Wisden was acquired and published in the 1970s by Robert Maxwell's publishing group, Macdonald
 sar paul getti ne 1993 main jon vijden and company ko kharida tha
 And in December 2008 it was sold to A&C Black which was owned by Bloomsbury

 Wisden is a short-paged but very thick book with a distinctive bright yellow cover that it has been extracting from the 75th edition in 1938
 uske pehle aavaran pile, badami or salmon gulabi rangon ke bich vividh prakaar ke hote the
 That version was also the first issue to feature the two cricketers' famous woodcut by Eric Ravilious on its cover
 ise angreji gharelu cricket satr ke shuru hone se thik pehle prayek april ko prakashit kiya jaataa he
 Woodcut as the main feature of the front cover since 2003 has been replaced by a picture of an existing cricketer, but still appears in a much smaller size though
 ise kathor aavaran or naram aavaran donon swaroopon main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Since 2006, a larger format version has been published on an experimental basis
 kaha jaataa he ki aisa pathakon ke anurodh ke jawaab main kiya gaya he jinhen maanak sanskaran ke mudran aakaar ko padhane main pareshaani hoti he

 vaise yah ek bada mudran pustak nahin he kyonki print abhi bhi usee aakaar main hoga jaisaa ki kai maanak pustakon main paaya jaataa he
 Its format has changed markedly over the years

 The contents of a contemporary version include the following sections: parichayatmak "sampadak kii tippaniyon" sahit cricket sambandhi vishyon par lagbhag sau pannon ke lekh, jo aksar cricket ke vivaadaaspad muddon par prakaash daalate hai or cricket kii duniya main hameshaa bahes ko badhaava dete hai

 Wisden Cricketers 'almanac', commonly known as Wisden, is a cricket magazine published annually from the UK

 sambandhit janaganana code: In Ayurveda, before starting the treatment, there is a provision for clinical examination and clinical examination
 arthath chikitsa ke purv pariksha atyant aavashyak he
 As far as the examination is concerned, the examination is both for the patient and also for the disease
 rog-rogi donon kii pariksha karke unka balaabal gyaan karke hi safal chikitsa kii ja sakati he
 Ayurvedicists have described the diagnosis for the examination of the disease
 ayurveda ke anusaar, rog kii pariksha in paanch upayon se hota he - These five measures are called diagnostics
 nidaan– rog ke kaaran ko nidaan kehete hai
 Poorforma - The symptoms that occur before the disease occurs are called Poorforma
 rup - utpann hue rogon ke chihnon ko lakshan yaa rup kehete hai
 Upasya - Pleasant use in the result of medicine, food and vihara is called upasya
 samprapti - rog kii ati praarambhik avasthaa se lekar rog ke purna rup se pragat hone tak, rog ke kriyaakaal kii chah avasthaayen hoti hai
 The diagnostician has knowledge of the force of the disease
 iske saath hi saath chikitsa hetu rogi ke bal kaa gyaan bhi aavashyak he
 Which decides whether the patient is able to tolerate therapy or not
 iske liye dashavidh pariksha kaa varnan aayaa he jiske antargat vikruti pariksha ko chhodkar shesh pariksha rogi ke bal ko jaanane ke liye he
 Upadhyaya is used for knowledge of disease in unknown disease, and for healing in known disease
 chha: prakaar ke upshay hai
 After multiplying with medicine, food and vihara, there are 18 distinctions of the epithelium, which are 18 types of medical practices
 in prakaaron main prakritik chikitsa, homeopathy tathaa aa
chi
vi
 sahit bhinn-bhinn chikitsa paddatiyon ke siddhanth sutara vidyaman hai
 For example, one of the major distinctions of subclinical therapy is 'allopathy' based on 'malignancy', which is basically the opposite of symptoms
 maatr lakshan vipareet aushadh se taatkaalik rup se rog kaa shaman hota he, kintu chikitsa ke lakshya, 'dhaatusatmya' kii siddhi anishchit he
 Ayurveda also has an important place for antiviral therapy, such as the pillar medicine is used to stop the motion of diarrhea, but the important thing is that it has no harmful side effects
 allopathy maatr lakshanatmak chikitsa paddati hoti to bhi sweekaarya hoti parantu yah dushprabhav yukt tathaa hanikaarak he, isaliye vinaashkari he or aisi dushprabhav yukt chikitsa ko ayurveda 'chikitsa' hi nahin maanata
 From the earliest stages of the disease to the complete manifestation of the disease, there are six stages of the course of the disease- dosha ke sanchay, prakope, prasar tathaa sthaan sanshray rogon kii purvarup avasthaa he
 Symptoms of disease arise in manifestation and disease is manifested
 bhed avasthaa rog kii jeern avasthaa he
 That is, the accumulation of faults, the wrath, the pressure, the location, the person and the person who knows the distinction is the real doctor
 rogon kii ati praarambhik avasthaa main hi tridosh asantulan ko nimna upayon se, bina kisi blad test yaa eksre aadi dwaara jaanch kar rog kaa nidaan kiya jaataa hanaadi pareekshan, mel-mutr, netra, jihva, swar, sparsh evam akruti pareekshan
 It is considered best to treat in the pre-existing conditions as much as possible because if accumulation
 kaal main hi chikitsa kar di jaae to dosha naa aage badhegaa or na rog utpann hoga
