 software ejineering main, dizine pattern aam taur par software dizine main hone vaali samasya ke liye ek saamaanya pun: prayojya samaadhaan he
 a design pattern is not a complete design that can be directly converted to code
 samasya kaa kaise nidaan kiya jaae, iskaa yah ek vivaran yaa khaakaa he jise kai vibhinn sthitiyon main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Object-oriented design patterns, without specifying the final application classes or objects involved, typically depict relationships and interactions between classes or objects
 dizine pattern, modul or interconection ke prabhaav kshetra main rahete hai
 At higher levels, there exist architectural patterns that are relatively large in detail, which usually describe an overall pattern followed by an entire system
 sabhi software pattern, dizine pattern nahin hote
 udhaaharan ke liye, kalanvidhi, software dizine samasyaon ke bajaay pariklan samasyaon ko sulajhaata he
 Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander
 In 1987, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming and presented their results at the OOPSLA conference that year
 baad ke varshon main, bek, kaningham or dusron ne is par kaam karnaa jari rakhaa
 After the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable object-oriented Software was published in 1994, design patterns gained popularity in computer science
 usee saal programing kii pattern bhashaaen par pehla sammelan yojit hua or agle varsh portland pattern bhandar ko dizine pattern ke pralekhan ke liye sthapit kiya gaya
 The scope of this terminology remains a matter of controversy
 dizine pattern style kii ullekhneey pustakon main shaamil hai: Although the practical application of design patterns is a fact, the task of standardizing the concept of design patterns remained stuck for many years
 dizine pattern, vikaas prakriya ko siddh or parakhe hue vikaas maandand pradaan karte hue tej kar saktaa he
 Effective software design requires consideration of issues that may not be visible until later in implementation
 dizine pattern kaa punarprayog kuch sookshm muddon ko rokane main madad karata he, jo vyapak samasya paidaa kar sakate hai or yah code likhane waalon or vaastukaron ke liye, jo pattern se parichit hai, code pathneeyata main sudhaar karata he
 To achieve flexibility, design patterns typically present an additional level of indirect measure, which in some cases can complicate the resulting design and hurt application performance
 paribhaasha ke anusaar, ek pattern kaa uskaa upyog karne vaale prayek anuprayog main nae sire se programing kiya janaa chahie
 As some authors see this as a backward step from software reuse as provided by components, researchers worked to convert patterns into components
 meyer or arnot, sarvaadhik gyaat pattern ko ghatak main parivartit karne main do tihaai safalataa dar kaa daawa karte hai
 Often, people just understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems
 in takneekon ko samasyaon kii ek vyapak shrenee ke liye lagu karnaa kathin he
 Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require a specification tied to a specific problem
 dizine pattern kai virgon se rache hote hai 
 sanrachana, pratibhaagi or sahyog khand vishesh rup se dilachasp hai
 These classes explain a design motif: a prototype micro-architecture that developers copy and adapt to their specific design to solve the recurring problem described by the design pattern
 micro-architekchar, program ghatakon or unke sambandhon kaa ek set he
 Developers use design patterns by introducing this prototype micro-architecture into their designs, which means that the structure and organization of the micro-architecture in their designs will be similar to the design design chosen
 iske atirikt, pattern, developers ko software kii paraspar kriya ke liye acchhee tarah se gyaat, acchhee tarah se samajhe hue naam ke prayog se samvaad karne kii anumati dete hai
 Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them stronger than temporary designs
 dizine pattern ko vishesh domen main kodebaddh karne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye hai, jisamen vartmaan dizine pattern ke upyog sahit domen vishisht dizine pattern shaamil he
 Examples include user interface design patterns, information visualization, "secure usability", and web design
 vaarshik pattern langwagees of programing sammelan kii kaarywahi main domen vishesh pattern ke kai udhaaharan shaamil hai
 Design patterns are basically divided into categories of creative patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns, and they are interpreted using concepts of delegation, aggregation, and consultation
 object-unmukh dizine kii adhik prishthbhumi jaanane ke liye kapaling or kohizan dekhen

 Documentation for a design pattern, the context in which this pattern is used, the force within the context that the pattern attempts to resolve and the proposed solution
 dizine pattern ko pralekhith karne ke liye koi ek maanak praaroop nahin he
 Rather, a variety of formats have been used by different pattern authors
 tathaapi, martin foller ke anusaar, kuch nishchit pattern praaroop anya praroopon kii tulana main zyada lokapriy ho gaye hai or falswaroop pattern lekhan ke nae prayaason ke liye ek aam aarambhik charan ban gaye hai
 An example of a commonly used documentation format is the format used by Eric Gama, Richard Heim, Ralph Johnson, and John Lysedes in their book Design Patterns
 It has the following categories: computer vigyaan ke kshetra main, dizine pattern kii avadharana ke bare main kuch aalochanaayen maujuud hai
 Misuse of design patterns can result in unnecessary code implementation
 yah kushal software vikaas kii saadagi ke pratimaan ke vipareet he
 Users of dynamic programming languages have discussed several design pattern languages as workarounds for limitations, such as c ++ and Java
 udhaaharan ke liye, vizitor pattern ko us bhashaa main lagu karne kii jarurat nahin he, jo multimethds kaa samarthan karti he
 The purpose of the visitor is to add new operations to existing classes, without modifying them
 C++ main, ek varg ko ek vishisht or band tareekon ke set vaale, sintactic strecchar ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya he
 In a language with multimethods, such as methods for the Common Lisp class, it is outside that class structure and one can add new methods without changing them
 isi tarah, decorator pattern, dinemic dailygation ke karyanvayan ke baraabar he, jaisaa ki kaaman lisp, objective C, self or javascript main paaya jaataa he
 Peter Norwig discusses the stereotype of implementing various patterns in dynamic languages in Design Patterns in Dynamic Programming
 norwig or anya ne un bhashaa gunon kii vyakhya kii he, jo vibhinn pattern ko aaveshtit yaa sthanapann karte hai, jise C++ ke upyogkarta ko swayan ke liye lagu karnaa jaruri hoga
 Some authors allege that design patterns are not significantly different from other forms of abstraction and that the use of new terminology for existing factual descriptions in the field of programming is unnecessary
 model-vyuu-cantrolar pratimaan ko "pattern" ke ek udhaaharan ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he, jo "dizine pattern" kii avadharana se kai varshon pehle se vyaapt he
 Others argue that the design pattern community's primary contribution was to use Alexander's pattern language as a form of documentation; a practice that has often been ignored in the literature

 The biggest thing is that he expressed deep doubt on the recording of Toscanini
 He wrote to Lagge, 'the speed and energy are of the devils, no one would expect such an enthusiast or superman with great enthusiasm'
 One of the reasons Furtwängler was so respectful to Beethoven was that it served as a tonic after Toscanini was extremely angry with his poor performance

 The level of access varies according to Israeli security directives
 bethalham ke philistini nivaasiyon dwaara west-bank se israeli kabje vaale jerusalem main kii jane vaali yatra kaa niyaman ek permit-pranali ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Obtaining permits for entry, which in the past served as an urban shelter for Bethlehem in many ways, has become extremely rare since the beginning of the violence associated with the Second Intifada, though Israel later a terminal has been constructed to simplify the movement between two adjacent cities
 philistiniyon ko permit ke bina shahar ke bahari ilaake main sthit raishelle kii samadhi vaale yahudee pavitra-sthal main pravesh karne kii anumati nahin he
 Since Bethlehem and the Bible's adjacent Solomon's area are located in Area a (an area controlled by both military and civil administration), Israeli citizens are prevented from entering here without a permit from Israeli military officials

 For a book titled History of Malayalam Literature see History of Malayalam Literature: Parameswaram Nair
 malayalam bhashaa athwa uske sahitya kii utpatti ke sambandh main sahi or vishwasaneey pramaan praapt nahin hai
 Nevertheless, the antiquity of Malayalam literature has been considered to be around a thousand years
 bhashaa ke sambandh main ham keval is nishkarsh par hi pahunch sake hai ki yah bhashaa sanskritj nahin he - yah dravid parivaar kii hi sadasya he
 But it is still debatable whether it is a branch of Tamil, or a language that exists apart from other southern languages, developed from the original Dravidian language
 arthath samasya yahi he ki tamil or malayalam kaa rishta maan-beti kaa he yaa bahan-bahan kaa
 The task of finding the solution to this puzzle by research is the work of language scientists and they are the only ones who can solve this problem
 jo bhi ho, is baat main andeh nahin he ki malayalam kaa sahitya keval usee samay pallavit hone laga tha jabaki tamil kaa sahitya fal phool chukaa tha
 Like Sanskrit literature, we can also call Tamil literature as the source of Malayalam thirst quenching
 san 3100 isapurv se lekar 100 isapurv tak yah pracheen tamil kaa ek sthaneey rup thi
 Sanskrit was influenced by it from the first century BC
 teesri sadi se lekar pandrahavin sadi ke madhya tak malayalam kaa madhyakaal mana jaataa he
 Jains also influenced the language in this period
 aadhunik kaal main san 1795 main parivartan aayaa jab is rajya par angreji shashan purnroopen sthapit ho gaya
 The history of Malayalam literature is alive with songs
 inamen bhakthi, viraras or hasyaras ke geeton ke saath saath praudh kavy bhi vidyaman hai
 The place of "ramcharitam" is the most important among these adult works
 isaki bhashaa tamil ke itane nikat he ki chand tamil vidvan ise tamil kii rachana samaj baithe, parantu aaj yah nihsandeh siddh ho chukaa he ki ramcharitam malayalam kavy he or uskaa rachayita bhi keralavasi he
 Its theme is the story of the Ramayana of Lanka
 kerala ke chiraman naamak kavi ne isaki rachana kii he
 Researchers believe that Ramacharitam's creation dates back to the 13th century
 pehali se aathvin sadi isvi tak kii avadhi main cher rajya main, jo aage chalakar kerala bana, anek suprasiddh tamil rachanaaon kaa janm hua he
 We can take the example of high quality poems like "chilappatikaram" etc
 parantu ramcharitam ko is koti main, arthath keralavasi dwaara rachit tamil rachanaaon main ginana bhraamak hoga
 Ramacharitam was composed at a time when the spread of Sanskrit was frozen in Kerala and a mixed language called Manipravalam was developing
 ramcharitam main sanskrit ke tatsam evam tadbhav shabdon kaa prayog prachur maatra main miltaa he
 But there is a slight change in their forms due to the writing by the Dravidian letters
 saatvin sadi isvi se lekar aage kuch samay tak kerala ke saanskrithik kshetra main aryvanshaj namputiriyon kaa kaaphi prabhaav rahaa
 Most researchers are of the opinion that they had come to Kerala long ago
 inhen ke prabhaav se kerala main manipravalam naamak mishra bhashaa kaa vikaas hua
 Manipraval literature was highly confirmed between the 10th and 15th centuries AD
 isi manipraval ke madhyam se sanskrit ke anek kavyarupon kaa sankraman malayalam main hua
 We can take the example of champu poetry, message poetry etc
 "unniyai charitam", unnichirutevicharitam" or unniati "charitam" pracheen manipraval champu hai
 The creation period of Uniyacchi Charitam is the first half of the 14th century
 unniaticharitam 1350 i ke asapas likhaa gaya or uskaa rachayita he damodar chaakyar
 The author of Uniyacchi Charitam is considered a poet named Tevan Chirikuman
 unnichirutevi charitamko inhen kaa samakaleen mana jaataa he
 But there is no information in relation to which poet it is composed
 jaisaa inke naamon se vidit hota he, inaki vishaywastu kuch vikhyath sundariyon kii prashasti he
 "ushnunilisandesam" and "kokasandesam" are important in message verses
 aisa mana jaataa he ki donon kaa rachanakaal 14veen shatabdi he
 Nothing is known about the poets who composed them
 10veen or 15veen sadiyon ke bich kuch laghu manipraval kritiyon kii bhi rachana hui
 Most of these are compositions of Shringaras associated with some luxury beauties
 ilychchi, cheriucchi, uttarachandrika, kaunottara, mallinilav, marlekha ityadi nayikaon kaa varnan inamen sammilit he, "vaishiktantrm" ek vaishyaputree ko die gaye kuldharmopadesh kaa sangrah he; iskaa rachanakaal sambhavat: 11veen shatabdi he
 Bhaktipradhan compositions are also found in Maniprawal literature
 anantpurvarnanam, shrikrishnastavam, dashavatharcharitam ityadi inke udhaaharan hai
 "chandrotsavam is the creation of an unknown poet of the 15th century
 "medinivennilav" naamak ganika dwaara manaae gaye chandrotsav kaa varnan isaki vishaywastu he
 The spread of Manipraval literature inspired the creation of a scripture detailing the grammar rules and literary features of that language
 is granth kaa naam he "leelatikam"
 It can be inferred that "lilatilakam" is written in the 14th century
 yadi ek taraf manipraval sahitya kaa vikaas hota gaya to duusari taraf "pattu" naamak kavyashakha kii bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 As mentioned above, this branch has many folk songs related to religious and farming and other professions
 toram pattu, sarpam pattu, ayyapp, pattu ityadi kaa sambandh aachaar maryaadaaon or dharmik vishyon se he
 Krishippattu, Aarurpattu, Vallappattu etc
 fall into the second category
 in geeton ke mul ghatak hai--swar, taal or lay
 Adult songs are different from folk songs
 uparilikhit "ramcharitam" hi is vibhaag main sarvapratham ullekhneey he
 The definition given for adult pattu poetry in Lilatilakam fits well in this
 baad main likhe gaye "niranam" geeton main prayukt shabd keval dravid aksharon ke bane hue nahin hai
 There are a lot of Sanskrit terms in them, which shows that by this time adequate Sanskrit letters had been promoted
 is mat ko manyata mili he ki niranam geet 14veen sadi ke uttarardh or 15veen sadi ke purvardh ke bich likhe gaye hai
 There is no difference of more than one or one and a half centuries in the times of songs of Ramacharitam and Niranam
 phir bhi in donon ke bich kaa bhashaa sambandhi antar atyadhik spasht he
 This presupposes that although Manipraval had developed during the time of Ramacharitam, only poetry written by Tamil letters was deliberately used in this poem
 niranam kavi teen hai--madhav panikkar, shankar panikkar or ram panikkar
 Bhagavad Gita, translated by Madhav Panikkar, made the language proud - it is the first and foremost among the lyrical works composed in the regional languages of India
 isamen saat sau shlokon kaa bhashaantaran 328 geeton main hua he
 In the translation of the meaning and significance of the Gita, even the slightest has not been omitted
 shankar panikkar kii rachana "bharatmala" naamak gaankavy he
 Ram Panikkar made a brief translation of Ramayana, Bharat and Bhagavata
 yah kathan galat nahin hoga ki malayalam ko apane paanv par khadey hone kaa bal pradaan karanevaale isi kavi ko bhashaa kaa pita mana ja saktaa he--yadhyapi itihaaskaaron kii drushti main tunchatt eshuttachdan is oopaadhi ke adhikari hai; mere vichaar main kannation ke naam se vikhyath is ram kavi ko uparyukt padavi pradaan karne main eshuttachhan ko harsh hi hoga, kyonki eshuttachhan ke acharyapad ke bhi ve paatr hai
 All the above poems are retellings of mythology
 parantu pandrahavin shatabdi main aavirbhoot "krishnagatha" keval puraana kaa punrakhyaan maatr nahin he
 In this, the narrative of Krishnagatha described in the Dasam wing of the Bhagavata has been proved that the form of Sanskrit epics has appeared in the Manjari verse - one of the culminating types of dravidic verses
 at: krishnagatha ko malayalam kaa sarvapratham swatantra mahakavy maan sakate hai
 Renowned Krishnagatakar, as the poet of the seasons, interviewed the new beauty trappings by the Prakritavarnas
 sureeli ganvidha, lalit or komal padaavalee, chiranutan kalpanaayen--inke kaaran krishnagatha ek sammohankaree rachana ban gai he
 See - Tunchatu Ramanujan Ashutachchan pattu shakha kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn vibhaag "kilippattu" he
 Tunchatta considers Ashutachchan to be the founder of this genre
 isamen "kili" arthath tote kii jabaani kathakhyaan hota he, isliye ise kilippattu kehete hai
 The era of Ashutachchan is the first half of the 16th century
 is jamaane main kerala ek prakaar kii raajnneetik, saamaajik or saanskrithik shithilataa kaa anubhav kar rahaa tha
 Even today, as the divine man incarnated for the resurrection of Kerala from this degeneration, the people of Kerala still believe in ecstasy
 unhone bhakthi ke udbodhan se janata ko prabud kiya
 There are Tarak ashtutchanas from the direction of Kerala in Bhaswar Nabhomandal from devout poets like Namdev, Kabir, Chaitanya, Surdas, Tulsidas, Manikkavachkar, Kampar etc
 un sabaki bhanti eshuttachan bhi janata ko jaagrath evam udbuddha karne main safal hue
 Through short translations of these three in Ramayana, Bharat and Bhagavata, Eshutachchan found direct entry into the hearts of all Keralites
 kerali ko ek nutan garima, gambhirtha, shaleenta or swaavlamban praapt hua
 In this sense, Eshutachchan is considered the father of Malayalam literature
 ve hi aise kavi hai jo jhopadiyon or mehalon main samaan rup se samaadrut hai
 The second Bhaktipradhan ganakavya in the Pattu department is the "gyanappana" of "puntanam"
 puntanam ke anya stotra bhi lalit, komal or bhakthisudha se otprot he
 Other notable compositions of this department are some folklore and some lyrical poetry known as "vatakkan Pattu" and "tekkan Patt"
 jaisaa naamon se vidit hota he, ye geet kramash: uttar or dakshin kerala kii virgathaayen hai
 The language of the northern songs is similar to modern Malayalam, but the language in the southern songs is more familiar to Tamil than Tamil
 16 veen or 18 veen sadiyon bich rache gaye dakshini geeton main tamil kaa prabhaav sambhavat: dakshin kerala ke tamil pradeshon ke saath nikat sampark ko hi suchit karata he, na ki bhashaa ke swatantra vikaas ke abhaav ko
 The poets of the south were bilingual scholars
 manipraval andolan ke antargat champu kaavyon kaa doosraa charan 15veen shatabdi main pun: darshneey he
 Although more than three hundred Champu poems have been composed in this period, only the Ramayana of Punampamputiri and the linguistic etc
 of Mashamangalam Narayanan Namputiri are worthy of special attention
 punam kaa kaal 15veen shatabdi ke purvardh main athwa 16veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main hona chahie
 The period of Naishchad Champakaar is mid-16th century
 yadhyapi vikascram ke anusaar uttam manipraval main malayalam kii hi pramukhataa honi chahie thi, phir bhi in champuon main sanskritpradhan bhashaa hi apanaai gai he
 a situation arose that knowledge of Sanskrit became compulsory for most champs to understand
 is kaaran manipraval sahitya saamaanya janata se dur hota gaya
 Attakkatha is a literary department associated with choreography
 is kalaroop kaa naam "kathakali" he
 Aattakkatha is a prolific literary branch of Malayalam
 aaj kathakali ko atanrarashtriya sammaan praapt he
 Its basic literature has contributed a great deal in giving this status to this color
 17 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main koshikkot ke manaved raja ne "krishngiti" naamak sanskrit kavy kii rachana kii
 Based on this, the dance called "krishnanattam" also emerged
 isamen shrikrishna kii katha kaa aath dinon main abhinay karne kii yojana banaai gai
 Another dance form called "ramanattam" was also invented by Krishnattam
 is kala-rup ke aadharbhoot sahitya main ramakatha ko aath raat main khilne yogya khandon main vibhakt kiya gaya
 Its author is the king of Kottarakkara
 inke jivakaal ke sambandh main do mat hai
 Some consider them from the seventeenth century, others from the 15–16th century
 ramnattam main aaj kii kathakali kaa pragrup darshneey hai
 The Raja of Kottayam, whose life is considered to be the last phase of the 17th century, developed the modern form of Kathakali by revising and finishing Ramanattam
 inaki rachanaayen chaar hai--sabhi mahabharat ke upakhyanon par aadhaarit hai
 Kings like Karthik Tirunal, Ashwati Tirunal etc
 also have "nalacharitam" by Unnayi Warrier, the best work in the autobiographies
 nalcharitam chaar raaton main abhinaeya he
 Some scholars consider Unnayi Warrier to be the last of the 16th century and the first foot of the 17th century, and the second of the 17th and 18th centuries
 is pratibhavan kavi ne aattakkathaon ke liye ek amodh path kaa udghaatan kiya
 This poet is captivated by the utopian stanza-style, unpredictable Kalpavanavibhava and serious life-philosophy
 "girijakalyanm" naamak geet prabandh ko bhi kuch vidvan unnayi variyar rachit maanate hai
 It is composed in the style applied in the verses of Kilippattu
 18veen sadi ke ooshaakaal main ek mahaan tej:punj kaa udai hua--tullal-sahitya ke upgyaata kunchan nampyar kaa
 It is possible that colors like Tulla have been there before
 parantu isamen andeh nahin ki isi pratibhashali kavi ne tullal ko ek andolan ke rup main viksit kiya
 In a way, Tullal can be called a dancer
 tullal geet iskaa aadharaswaroop sahitya he
 Nampyar has taken the anecdotes of the Puranas as a story for the Tullal songs
 phir bhi varnanon main aanevaala vaataavaran puranic na hokar kerala ke samasamyik janajivan se mail khaanevaala he
 Nampyar has created a bitter satire on the personal and social perversions of the then life through mythological chronicles
 inke is parihaas kii tej dhar kaa lakshya samajasharir ke vranon kii cheer faad karnaa tha
 The highly accomplished Kavyaloka of the Satire genre is visible in Tullal literature
 is vishay main koi bhi inke samaksh nahin aata, na inke pehle, na baad main
 If the gags are to be successful, then subtle, ruthless and comprehensive understanding is expected
 yah siddhi prachur maatra main hone ke kaaran nampyar kaa hasya adarsh he
 His humor and poignancy does not stoke the flame of rancor, but only the feeling of heartfelt sympathy and human love springs
 pattu shakha kii ek anya mahatvapurn rachana 18veen sadi ke purvardh ke kavi rampurm variyar kaa "kuchelvruttam" vanchippattu he
 Initially, there was not much progress of prose literature in Malayalam
 10veen yaa 11veen shatabdi main likhit "bhashakautalium" kutiattam ke abhinay ke liye digdarshan denevaali "attaprakaaram" naamak granthparampara, 14veen shatabdi kaa "dootvakyam" gadhy, usee shatabdi kaa "brahmadpuranam" gadhy, "ambarishcharitam", "devibhagwatam" ityadi gadhy--in sabhi ko gadhy sahitya ke liye pracheen kaal kii dein maan sakate hai
 The Christian evangelists have written some prose texts in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries
 inamen "sankshep vedartham" "vedatarkam" ityadi sammilit hai
 "presentappukam" is the first travel literature
 kunchan nampyar ke baad kuch samay tak kii avadhi malayalam ke liye andhakaarmay he
 For about half a century, no light emerged during this period
 baad main swati thirunal ke yug kaa suprabhat hua
 Iyyimman Tampi Kilimanoor Koyittampuran, etc
 The authors of the autobiography found the support of Swatirirunal
 swati thirunal swayan kavi the or unhone hindi main bhi geet likhe the
 After this, the modern era of Malayalam literature begins with the period of Kerala Varma Koyittapuran
 sahityasaarvbhaum kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit is pratibhashali lekhak ke netritv main sahitya main ek navajagaran aa gaya
 Sandesh Kavya, titled "mayurasandesam", a translation of the play "shakuntalam" and a novel called Akbar are the main ones in his works
 unke shakuntal anuwaad ke saath malayalam main sanskrit naatakon ke anuwaadon kii baadh si ai
 Chattukkutty Mannatiyar, Kunjikkuttan Tampuran, Kottartattil Shankhani etc
 confirmed this branch
 samskruti naatakon kii hi tarah ke swatantra malayalam naatak bhi likhe gaye
 Bhagyeneya Rajaraja Varma of Kerala Varma also translated the texts of Kalidas etc
 inhen rajraj verma ne malayalam ko "keralapaninium" naamak vyakaran granth or "vruttmanjari" naamak chandashastra granth pradaan kiya tha
 Like his mother, he was also an inspiration and guide for everyone
 is jamaane main dwitiyakshar praapt ke pakshapatiyon or virodhiyon main jo ghor vivaad chhid gaya tha uske pravartak kramash: ye maatul bhaaginey the
 In this controversy, the first echoes of the call of "form of sentiment" of romanticism are heard
 isi avadhi main sanskrit ke mahakavyon ke anukaranon ke rup ke malayalam mahakavyon kii rachana hui thi

 The Kausar Alnil Road is a major route in the Cairo city area
 yahan par bahut saare vyapaarik pratishthan, vyavsaay, hotel, restaraan va lagaataar chalane vaala raat main manoranjan uplabdh hai
 Here the monuments, buildings and architecture built by the town planning of the past are reminiscent of various arts such as the famous fine art of 19th century Europe, Bazor art and Egyptian architecture - Islamic architecture - Renaissance of Moorish architecture

 The Kauser Alnil route goes from east to west like this 

 Starting from Abdin Mahal at Abdin Chowk, through an attractive commercial district, Bab el-lauk Bazaar, and from the campus of the American University in the Cairo city area While crossing, Talat connects with the Herb Road and goes to Tahrir Chowk via Moggama Bhawan and the Egyptian Museum
 phir yah nil nadi ko paar karti he or ant me jezira dweep par khatm ho jaati he
 Egyptian poet Ismail Pasha with strategic acumen decided to regain the eastern banks of the Nile in front of Jazeera Island and build Paris on the Nile
 nadi kaa nichalaa kshetra jo uske talabon, daldal, geeli mitti or lakhon logon ke nivas vaale prakritik jaldhara ke tateey kshetra ne ise bahut hi ummiido vaali faldaayi naagarik abhiyantriki pariyojna bana diya
 The Khairi Pasha Palace, built in 1860 at Tahrir Chowk at that time, later came into the premises of the American University
 is pariyojna kii shruwaat misr ke sainikon ke liye barrack banane se hui
 It later became an important Egyptian and then an important British institution
 yah kshetra naagarik zile ismailia kaa hissaa tha or is nai pariyojna ke liye jiske kendra main cosar elnil maarg sthit tha 617 acre kaa kshetra sweekrut hua tha
 In 1874, when a large number of infrastructural construction was completed, Ismail Pasha made a condition for spending a lot of money for the maintenance, decoration and construction of buildings, so that only special, rich and influential people could live here
 isaki vajah se shruwati varshon main isane bahut saare dhanadhyon ko aakarshit kiya
 Due to this, this area became very important, its and surrounding areas developed rapidly and business activities increased here
 angrez jab 1882 main misr kaa nirikshan karne aae to unka pehla makasad nil nadi ke kinare bane misri sena ke baiyrakon ko hathiyanna tha
 After many years of being in the hands of the British, King Farooq took the barracks back in 1948
 iske baad unhone in baiyrakon ko abbasia zile ke purv main sthanntarit kar diya
 These barracks were then used as buildings for the municipality of Cairo

 The accompanying Midan Ismailia crossroads were further demolished by demolishing the English barracks

 Some important historical sites from east to west are -> taharir chaukatlet herb margamisr ke pyramidqahiranil nadeeqnsar al-nil pul The use of the term satirical "burlesque" took place a few years before the re-establishment of the state power in England, which previously meant only free humor, not literary method
 uske pashchaat "drol" ke paryaay ke rup main iskaa prayog hua jiskaa arth tha atyant hasyajanak
 Even now the same meaning is used for literary forms that fall under the category of circumcision, satirical and pseudo-metaphor
 sarvapratham san 1643 main skaro ne iskaa prayog kiya tha or phir san 1648 main uske granth "virgil ke chhadam roopak" ke liye iskaa prayog hua tha
 The title that Charles Cauton followed in English was Scaronidus and Virgil's Transversity
 is shabd kaa prayog "hudibras" ke liye bhi hua tha jisi un bade atapate dwicharani chhandon main rachana hui thi jinka prayog aage chalakar sabhi prahaskon ke liye sweekrut ho gaya tha
 The term "burlesque" is now used for all poems, fiction and dramas in which ritual policy, institution, individual or literary works are presented in ridiculous and sarcastic form by ridiculous adulation
 jonson kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aisi rachanaaon main jaan boojhkar shail or bhav ke beey virodh yaa annupaat utpann karke vinodatmak prabhav utpann kiya jaataa he
 Of these, any insignificant object or sentiment that is presented with the utmost sarcastic seriousness is called the high praestor and in which the solemn gesture is displayed with a very low and bizarre ridiculous erudition, shortness or inferiority
 adhikansh is prakaar kii rachanaaon kaa uddeshy aalochana karnaa, khilli udaana yaa chhinte kasnaa hota he kintu isamen asanyat or asangat kriyaaon yaa vyavhaaron ke dwaara manovinod bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This type of pure imaginary haunter is called the estraveganza
 prahaasak ke mukhya rup hai parivritti vyang chithran or chhadmaroopak 
 a traitor whose humorously perverse imitation of a particular work or writer or later style or nature and manner is made and whose purpose is to laughter or humiliate or ridicule it is called pratism
 jis prahaasak main kisi lekhak yaa kriti yaa vyakti ke saralata se pahachaane ja sakane vaale lakshanon ko tod marod yaa vikrut karke chithran kiya gaya ho, use vyangyachitran kehete hai
 Pseudopatterns call the praetor in which the original subject remains as it is, but it is rendered in an extremely inconsistent and insignificant language and with exaggerated exaggeration
 kisi prahasak main in teenon paddatiyon kaa sammishran bhi ho saktaa he or kabhi-kabhi teenon kaa purna parityag bhi visheshat: jahaan saarvbhaum vichaar yaa jivan ke sarvasaamaanya pakshon ko asangat rup main prastut kiya jaae - jaise vaayran ke don juvaan main
 But often the enjoyment of the accuser is more than indirectly presented in the subject of the hilarious subject, so it is often irrelevant to the narrative, pseudotyped or cartography
 prahaasak us yug main adhik faltaa phulataa he jab lekhakon ke baad yaa saamaajik sansthaayen ninda yaa aalochana ke paatr ban jaati hai or jab bahut se log un sab baton kii asangati ke sabandh main adhik abhigya ho jate hai jo pehle prashansaneey samajhi jaati thim
 In Europe, when the ludicrous talk of medieval imaginative literature went on, Chaucer ridiculed him in his treatise called "sir Topas"
 do shatabdi pashchaat samantvaadi pranali kii hraasayukt shastrasajja ko "don quickzot" dwaara utpann kiye hue vinod ne purnat: samaapt kar daalaa jisamen us prakaar ke prahaasak likhane ke liye keval prerana hi nahin mili varan adarsh bhi upasthit kiye gaye
 The result of this is that in the early 17th century, especially in England, all forms of praetor were written in very impressive numbers
 "huditraas" style se nimna prahaskon kii paripati chali or ucch prahaasak "dryden" ke "mcflationo" tathaa pope ke "di rape ov di lock" sheershak rachanaaon ke veertapurna chhandon main apni paraakaashtha ko pahunch gay
 a number of hymns have been written and proselytized on prose and gothic novels of the 18th century, such as Jain Osten's "nierthenar Abbey" Peacock's "hedlong Hau" and "hauris Hau" and "thackray"
 isi prakaar "gifford" or "hauris smith" kii kavitaayen, veertapurna tathaa kalpanaavadi naatak or nrity natya bhi safal hue
 The theatrical haunter is as old as the happy drama or farce
 comos kii prahasanatmak guptatantr kriyaayein se "aristoeness" ke naatakon main chhadmaroopak, parivritti or vyangyachitran kaa atyant bhavy sammishran viksit hua
 Although these types of skit on the Elizabethan theater were rare, they are notable - such as "nine Verdies" in "shakespeare "'s" Labour's Labour's Lost "," Pseudomus and Thisse "in" Mid Summer Night's Dream ", and" Pseudomus "
 The Night of the Burning Passion "
 vartmaan naatakeey prahaskon ko mukhya prerana "di george williars" ke "di reharsal" kii safalataa ne jisamen veertapurna naatakon kaa chhadmarupan or dryden kaa vyangyachitran kiya gaya tha
 In the 18th century, there was a tendency to associate music with the pranks who followed the comedy-dance-theatrical style of ballot aupara
 ve itane lokapriy hue ki choti avyavasthit rangashaalaon main unka bahut prachlan hua jo peeche chalakar rangashaala ke liye bane hue patent niyamon se baadhya kiye gaye ki ve bina sangeet ke samvaad prastut na karen
 The word Barletta was used for such compositions, which should not be confused with the synonym of the praetor
 17 veen shatabdi main uskaa arth tha sookshm sangitamay prahasan kintu peeche chalakar uskaa arth hua aisa naatak jisamen itnaa sangeet ho ki vah patent niyam kii baadha se mukt rahe
 In the early 19th century, two types of influences of such low-grade dramatists were eliminated and replaced
 pehla to adhik shisht francisi style kaa prachlan or duusare adhik kalatmak naatakeey rachanaaon kaa utpaadan
 In France also, the lower-order playwrights composed two types of light and fine musical hymns called the Fairies' Fowlies and the Revue
 is prakaar ke ater sataron, laalitya, kalpana, chaturtapurna shlesh or un samayik pravritiyon par atyant kaushalpurna tippanee bhari rahati thi jinka sambandh francisi yaa angreji sathiya se hota tha
 The present-day American hymns originate from the lost English art
 amareeki rangamanch par iskaa prachlan bahut haley hi ho gaya tha kintu england kii apeksha adhik sheel ke saath hua tha jahaan prarambh main hi kambhaavana kii prerana se vah bahut lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Emphasis on the work began in the United States in 1869 when an English theater troupe arrived in the United States, with a rousing display of organs, beautiful ballads and grease paint
 ab to keval us haahaakaar kaa or prahaasak kaa nammaatr batch gaya he jisane us samay ke logon ko prabhavit kiya tha
 Now that type of performance has reached musical spree and revue

 Bundelkhand is a very wide state in view of history, culture and language
 lekin isaki bhugolic, saanskrithik or bhashik ikaayiyon main adbhut samanta he
 Geographers are of the opinion that the boundaries of Bundelkhand are clear and certain in physical and cultural form that it is a geographical region of India in which not only the basis of structural unity, geography and sociality is also the same
 vastav main samast bundelkhand main sachhee saamaajik, aarthik or bhaavnaatmak ekta he
 Based on Puranas, the famous geographer SM Ali has equated the three districts of Vindhyas, Vidisha, Darshana and Karusha with son-can

 Part is included

 Based on the current physical researches, Bundelkhand has been declared as a physical region and its boundaries are based on - the region which is Yamuna in the north, Vindhya Paleto ranges in the south, Chambal in the northwest and Panna in the south-east
 - Ajaygarh is surrounded by ranges, known as Bundelkhand

 However, these boundary lines can be said to be justified in terms of geostructure

 i0 pus0 321 tak vaidic kaal se mauryaal tak kaa itihaas vastut: bundelkhand kaa puranic-itihaas mana ja saktaa he
 All its basis is mythological texts
 bundelkhand shabd madhyakaal se pehle is naam se prayog main nahin aayaa he
 Its diverse names and their use have been in the modern era itself
 beesvin shatee ke praarambhik dashak main rhibahadur maharajasingh ne bundelkhand kaa itihaas likhaa tha
 In this, the calculation of the names of the Jagirs and their rulers under Bundelkhand was the main one
 dewan pratipaal singh ne tathaa panna darbar ke prasiddh kavi krishna ne apane sroton se bundelkhand ke itihaas likhe parantu ve vidwaan bhi saamaajik saanskrithik chetnaaon ke prati udasin rahe
 According to Dr
 Gupt, Pandit Harihar Niwas Dwivedi has discussed in detail the political, religious, cultural achievements of Bundelkhand in the history book of Central India
 is granth main kuch sthanon par bundelkhand kaa itihaas bhi aayaa he
 Pandit Gorelal Tiwari made a good effort and wrote a brief history of Bundelkhand which was different from most texts till date but he wrote the history of Bundelkhand on sociological basis only on political events
 budelkhand ke pracheen itihaas ke sambandh main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn dharna yah he ki yah chedi janapad kaa hissaa tha
 Some scholars consider Chedi district to be ancient Bundelkhand
 puranic kaal main bundelkhand prasiddh shaskaon ke adheen rahaa he jinamein chandravanshi raajaaon ke shrunkhalabaddh shasankaal kaa ullekh sabase adhik he
 In the Buddhist period, a Buddhist named Shampak built a stupa with the nails and hair of Lord Buddha in Baghuda region
 marhoot main iske avshesh vidyaman hai
 With regard to Buddhist history, the remains of that time in Bundelkhand are clear that there was no significant change in the condition of Bundelkhand during this period
 chedi kii charchaa na hona or vatsa, avanti ke shaskaon kaa mahatv darshaya janaa is baat kaa pramaan he ki chedi inamen se kisi ek ke adheen rahaa hoga
 The ancient district of Chedi is thus Bundelkhand
 itihaas sakshi he ki bharat kii aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut kii chhavnee main bhadki thi
 But there is a truth missing behind these historical facts, that 15 years before the war of independence, Meerut started a revolution in Dharmanagri Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand
 pavitra mandakini ke kinare gokshi ke khilaaf ekajute hui hindu-muslim birdari ne mau tehsil main adaalat lagaakar paanch firangi afasaron ko faansee par lataka diya
 After this, whenever the British or any of their hangers tried to cheat in the pride of the Bundelas, they were beheaded
 is kranti ke nayak the aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut ke sidhe-saadhe harbole
 The 'ghaghra platoon' of Burkhanshini women was also instrumental in taking forward the tales of struggle
 aazaadee ke sangharsh kii pehali mashaal sulgaane vaale bundelkhand ke ranbankure itihaas ke pannon main jagah nahin paa sake, lekin unki shoorveerta kii tasdik firangi afasar khud kar gayi hai
 There is a story buried in the Banda Gazette written by the British authorities, which is known by very few people
 gajetir ke panne palatney par maaloom hua ki varsh 1857 main meerut kii chhavnee main firangiyon kii fouj ke sipaahi mangal pandeya ke vidroh se bhi 15 saal pehle chitrakoot main kranti kii chingaari bhadak chuki thi
 Actually, British officers used to slaughter cows on the banks of the holy Mandakini river in Dharmanagari at that time of the past
 gaumance ko bihar or bengal main bhejkar vahaan se evaj main rasad or hathiyaar mangaye jate the
 The local people were distracted by the killing of a second faith, ie the cow dynasty, on the banks of Mandakini, a symbol of faith, but the tongue was closed due to the fear of the Firangi
 kuch logon ne himmat dikhaate hue maratha shaskaon or mandakini paar ke ‘nayaa gaanv’ ke choube raajaaon se fariyaad lagaayi, lekin donon shaskaon ne angrejon kii mukhaalafat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The request went in vain, as a result a flame of vengeance flared inside the chest
 isi dauraan gaanv-gaanv ghoomane vaale harbolon ne gaukashi ke khilaaf logon ko jaagrit karte hue ekajute karnaa shuru kiya
 Then on the sixth day of June in the year 1842, he did not expect any
 hajaaron kii sankhya main nihathe mazdooron, naujavaanon or burkanashin mahilaon ne mau tehsil ko gherkar firangiyon ke saamne baghawat ke naare buland kiye
 The special thing was that hindu-muslim fraternity had equal participation in this movement against Gaukashi
 tehsil main goron ke khilaaf aawaaj buland hui to bundelon kii bhujaaen fadakane lageen
 After seeing the British officers were hostage, after this, a 'public court' was put under the tree and five British officers were hanged after trial
 janakranti kii yah jwaala mau main dafan hone ke bajaay rajapur bazaar pahunchi or angrej afasar khaded diye gayi
 Seeing the beauty of time, the landlords of Merca and Samagra also jumped into the movement
 do din baad 8 june ko baberu bazaar sulagaa to vahaan ke thanedaar or tehseeldaar ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 Along with expelling the British from Joharpur, Palani, Bisalpur, Semri, the revolutionaries in the office of Tindwari Tehsil burnt government records and looted three thousand rupees
 aazaadee kii jwaala bhadakne par gori hukumat ne apane pitthu shaskaon ko hukum jari karte hue krantikariyon ko kuchalane ke liye kaha
 On this decree, Panna Naresh sent a thousand soldiers, a cannon, four elephants and fifty bulls, the queen of Chhatarpur and the king of Gaurihar as well as the army of the king of Ajaygarh had also traveled to Chitrakoot
 duusari ore banda chhavnee main dubake firangi afasaron ne banda nawab se jaan kii guhaar lagaate hue bivi-bacchon ke saath pahunch gayi
 Here to suppress the rebellion, all the soldiers of the army of Indian kings who reached banda-chitrakoot started to step in with the agitators
 nattejey main utsaahi krantikariyon ne 15 june ko banda chhavnee ke prabharee mi
 kakrel ko pakadaney ke baad gardan ko dhad se alag kar diya
 After this, to end the awe of the British from inside Awam, roam the streets of Banda with a severed head
 kakrel kii hatya ke do din baad rajapur, mau, banda, darsenda, tarauhaan, badausa, baberu, pailaani, simauni, sihunda ke bundelon ne yuddh parishad kaa gathan karte hue bundelkhand ko aaazaad ghoshit kar diya
 Convener of "bundelkhand Unified Party" Sanjay Pandey says that when the British officers themselves have written about this revolution, then why did Indian historians not give these facts a place in the pages of history? When asked the truth it was a real mass movement Because there was no leader in it but the general public was the agitator, so it is not possible to ignore the struggle of the Bundelas to find a place in history
