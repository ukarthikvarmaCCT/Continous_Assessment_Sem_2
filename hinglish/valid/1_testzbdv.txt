 As soon as he passed, he reached the position of taking the position of lecturer in Prayag University, as well as taking over the responsibility of the city proceedings of Prayag
 1946 main prayag vibhaag ke kaarywah, 1948 main jail-yatra, 1949 main do teen vibhaagon ko milakar sambhag kaarywah, 1952 main praant kaarywah or 1954 main bhaurav devaras ke praant chhodane ke baad unki jagah puure praant kaa daayitv sanbhaalane lage
 On returning to Bhaurao in 1961, he became his associate again as co-pracharak by returning the responsibility of the preacher
 bhaurav ke kaaryakshetra kaa vistaar hua to pun: 1962 se 1965 tak uttar pradesh ke praant prachaarak, 1966 se 1974 tak sah kshetra-prachaarak va kshetra-prachaarak kaa daayitv sanbhaala

 This was an unusual event in the history of the Union
 prachaar madhyamon or sangh ke aalochakon kii aankhe is drishy ko dekhakar fatty kii fatty rah gayin
 He could not believe that any non-maharashtrian Abraham of North India could reach the pinnacle of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on which he has been imposing the image of the monopoly of Maharashtrian Brahmins till now - that too unanimously
 rajju bhaiya kaa sharir us samay rogagrast or shithil tha kintu unhone praan-pan se saunpe gayi daayitv ko nibhaane kaa ji-tod prayaas kiya
 But how long could one be taken away from his body which was severely broken by non-working and social thinking
 atev san 1999 main hi unhone us daayitv kaa bhaar kisi kam umr ke vyakti ko saunpane kaa man bana liya
 And finally, after waiting for a year, respecting the earnest request of his colleagues, in March 2000, he handed over this responsibility to Sudarshanji and presented a model to the Union for voluntary retirement
 rajju bhaiya kii 60 varsh lambi sangh-yatra keval is drushti se hi asaamaanya nahin he ki kis prakaar ve ek ke baad doosraa bada daayitv safaltaapurvak nibhaate rahe apitu is drushti se bhi he ki 1943 se 1966 tak ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary ke saath-saath ek purnakalik prachaarak kii bhanti yatra-tatra-sarvatra ghoomte hue samast dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte rahe
 In order to increase their capacity for union work, they did not depend on three years of traditional training in union education class
 pratham varsh kaa prashikshan unhone 1947 main tab praapt kiya jab ve prayag ke nagar kaarywah kii sthiti main pahunch chuke the, dwitiya varsh unhone 1954 main bareli ke sangh-shiksha-varg main us samay kiya jab bhaurav devaras unhen samooche praant kaa daayitv saunpkar baahar jane kii taiyaari kar chuke the
 He did the third year in 1957 when he was handling the responsibility of a big province like Uttar Pradesh
 is baat se spasht he ki unhone teen varsh ke prashikshan kii aupchaarikta kaa nirvaah sangh ke anya swayamsevakon ke sammukh yogya udhaaharan prastut karne ke liye kiya apane liye yogyata arjeet karne ke liye nahin
 Even while teaching in Prayag University, he was busy campaigning in union work
 aupchaarik taur par unhen prachaarak 1958 main ghoshit kiya gaya par sachaai yah he ki unhone kaarywah pad ko prachaarak kii bhoomika swayan pradaan kar di
 Rajju Bhaiya was one of the most popular and successful professors of Prayag University due to his very simple and interesting teaching style and affection towards his disciples, besides possessing unusual authority on esoteric subjects like physics
 varishthata or yogyata ke kaaran unhen kai varshon tak vibhaag ke adhyaksh-pad kaa daayitv bhi professor ke saath-saath sanbhaalanaa padaa
 But in spite of all this, they continued to fulfill their duties in the union work
 reader yaa professor banane kii koi kaamana unke man main kabhi nahin jaagi
 The days when he was asked to apply for the post of Reader of Physics Department in Prayag University, he did not give the application
 sahyogiyon ne poocha ki rajju bhaiya! aapane aisa kyon kiya? to unhone bade sahaj dhang se uttar diya- "are meraa jivan-kaary to sangh-kaary he, vishvavidhyalay kii professori nahin
 Right now i take classes four days a week, three days i visit for union work
 kabhi-kabhi bahut koshish karne par bhi vishvavidhyalay samay par nahin pahunch paata
 Right now all the teachers of the department support me, but if i become a candidate on the post of reader, then they will start thinking of me as their competitor
 isliye kyon is pachade main fasana
 "rajju Bhaiya's entire life is a witness to the fact that he has never had any aspiration or desire for the post
 vishvavidhyalay main adhyaaapak rah kar bhi unhone apane liye dhanarjan nahin kiya
 They used to spend every pie of their salary on union work
 sampann parivaar main janm lene, public skulon main shiksha paane, sangeet or cricket jaise khelon main ruchi hone ke baad bhi ve apane upar kam se kam kharch karte the
 He was a rare example of austerity
 varsh ke ant main apane vetan main se jo kuch bachataa use guru-dakshina ke rup main samaaj ko arpit kar dete the
 Once Rashtradham Prakashan got stuck in the economic crisis, he urged his father to repay Rashtradharma Prakashan by giving his share money
 yah thi unki sarvatyagi sannyast vritti kii abhivyakti! Rajju Bhaiya was dear to everyone due to selfless affection and unselfish work
 sangh ke bheetar bhi or baahar bhi
 He also gained the trust and affection of politicians like Purshottam Das Tandon and Lal Bahadur Shastri as well as saints like Prabhudatta Brahmachari
 bahut samvedansheel ant:karan ke saath-saath rajju bhaiya ghor yathartwaadee bhi the
 He used to say anything unacceptable to anyone and it was difficult to avoid his talk
 apatkaal ke baad janata party kii sarkaar main jab nanaaji deshmukh ko udyog mantri kaa pad dena nishchit ho gaya to rajju bhaiya ne unase kaha ki nanaaji agar aap, atalji or adwaniji - teenon sarkaar main chale jaayenge to baahar rahakar sanghathan ko koun sanbhaalega? nanaaji ne unki ichha kaa aadar karte hue turant mantripad thukraa diya or janata party kaa mahasachiv bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Whether it is Atalji, or Advaniji; Be it Ashokji Sinhala, or Dattopant Thengdiji - every top leader respected Rajju Bhaiya's talk; Because there was no sense of selfishness, notoriety or factionalism behind him
 is drushti se dekhen to rajju bhaiya sachmuch sangh-parivaar ke na keval bodhi-vriksh apitu sabko jodne vaali kadi the, naitik shakti or prabhaav kaa strot the
 With his departure, not only the Sangh but an era has come to an end in the public life of India
 rajju bhaiya keval haad-maans kaa sharir nahin the
 He was a true figure of self-determination, determination and idyllic idealism
 isliye rajju bhaiya sabhi ke ant:karan main sadaiv jivit rahenge
 If seen, Rajju brother is immortal even today
 rajju bhaiya is baat se bade dukhi the ki krantikari 'bismil' ke naam par is desh main koi bhavy smarak hamaare netaa log nahin bana sake
 They wanted to see a monument like the Turkish National Monument built in Delhi, the capital of India
 unhone kaha tha: "lachchhedaar bhaashan dekar apni chhavi ko nikhaarane ke liye taaliyaan bator lenaa alag baat he, nepathy main rahakar dusron ke liye kuch karnaa alag baat he

 jis sindicated masaude ko sankalak grahan karata he vah saamanytah aresas yaa anya kisi kshamal praaroop jaise ardf yaa atom main muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 The compiler saves the time and labor spent on locating new content on websites, and in a way makes it a personal newspaper for the reader to present

 jaal aadhaarit sankalak aise anuprayog hai jo duurastha sarwar par sthit hote hai or jinka google reader yaa blogalins jaise jaal anuprayogon ke sahare prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since these applications are used through the Internet, the user can read their subscribed feeds wherever Internet connectivity is available
 aadhunik sankalak ajaiks jaisi takneekon kaa prayog karte hai or anekon vijet ke rup main bhi uplabdh hai
 In addition to individual compilers, there are community compilers that usually compile feeds from a small community

 "golpad" main aryabhat ne likhaa he "naav main baitha hua manushya jab pravaah ke saath aage badhata he, tab vah samajhataa he ki achar vriksh, pashaan, parvat aadi padaarth ulti gati se ja rahe hai
 In the same way, stable constellations also appear to be moving in reverse from the moving earth
 " is prakaar aryabhat ne sarvapratham yah siddh kiya ki prithvi apane aksh par gumti he
 He considered Satyuga, Treta, Dwapara and Kali Yuga as equal
 inke anusaar ek kalp main 14 manwantar or ek manwantar main 72 mahayug tathaa ek chaturyug main satyuga, dwapar, treta or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to Aryabhata the relation of circumference and diameter of a circle comes to 62,832: 20,000 which is pure to four decimal places
 aryabhat ne badi-badi sankhyaon ko aksharon ke samooh se nirupit karne kityant vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya he
 The place-value numeral system, first seen in the Bakshali manuscript of the third century, was clearly present in his works
 unhone nishchit rup se pratik kaa upyog nahin kiya, parantu francisi ganitagya george iffrah ke matanusaar- rikt gunank ke saath, das kii ghaat ke liye ek sthaan dharak ke rup main shunya kaa gyaan aryabhat ke sthaan-mulya ank pranali main nihit tha
 However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Continuing the Sanskrit tradition dating back to the Vedic period, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities as mnemonic
 aryabhat ne pai ke sanniktan par kaary kiya or sambhawatah unhen is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya tha ki pai irreshnal he
 In the second part of Aryabhatiyam, he writes: iske anusaar vyas or paridhi kaa anupaat × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416 he, jo paanch mahatvapurn aankadon tak bilkul sateek he
 Aryabhata, interpreting the word imminent, coming immediately before the preceding word, states that it is not only an approximation, but that the value is incomparable
 yadi yah sahi he, to yah ek atyant parishkrut drushtikon he, kyonki europe main paai kii tarkheenata kaa siddhant lambert dwaara keval 1761 main hi siddh ho paaya tha
 This approximation was mentioned in Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi's book on algebra after Aryabhatiya's translation into Arabic
 ganitpad 6 main, aryabhat ne trikon ke kshetrafal ko is prakaar bataaya he- This translates to: The area of a triangle is equal to the result of half of the side with a perpendicular
 aryabhat ne apane kaam main dwijya ke vishay main charchaa kii he or usko naam diya he ardh-jya iskaa shabdic arth he "ardh-tantri"
 People started calling it sine because of the ease
 jab arabi lekhakon dwaara unke kaam kaa sanskrit se arabi main anuwaad kiya gaya, to unhone isko jiba kaha 
 Since, in Arabic writing, vowels are used less frequently, hence its more abbreviated name
 jab baad ke lekhakon ko ye samaj main aayaa ki jb jiba kaa hi sankshipt rup he, to unhone vaapis jiba kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Jiba means "koh" or "trench"
 baad main barahavin sadi main, jab krimona ke gheraardo ne in lekhanon kaa arabi se latin bhashaa main anuwaad kiya, tab unhone arabi jiba kii jagah uske latin samakaksh sinus ko daal diya, jiskaa shabdic arth "khoh" yaa khai" hi he
 And after that in English, the sinus itself became the sign

 Here gives an example from Bhaskara's interpretation on Aryabhatiya: arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity
 is tarah ke samikarnon kii vyapak rup se charchaa pracheen vaidic granth sulb sutara main he, jiske adhik pracheen bhaag 800 i

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm
 diophentine samikarnon kaa istemaal kryptolujee main hota he or aresae sammelan, 2006 ne apana dhyaan kuttak vidhi or sulvasutra ke purv ke kaaryon par kendrit kiya
 In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata has provided interesting results for the classes and ranges of cubes
 or Aryabhata's astronomy system was called the Auric system, his later writings on astronomy, which propose a second model, superficially, have been lost, but they can be partially reconstructed from the discussions in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka
 is
 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Aryabhata seemed to believe that the earth revolves around its axis
 yah srilanka ko sandarbhit ek kathan se gyaat hota he, jo taron kii gati kaa prithvi ke ghurnan se utpann aapekshik gati ke rup main varnan karata he
 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 He said that the moon and planets shine with the reflected light of the sun
 maujuuda brahmandavigyaan se alag, jisame grahanon kaa kaarak chhadam grah nispand bindu raahu or ketu the, unhone grahanon ko prithvi dwaara daali jane vaali or is par girane vaali chaaya se sambaddh bataaya
 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this Earth's shadow and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 This approximation was a significant improvement over the computation of the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, 200 AD), whose calculations are not known in modern units, but his estimate had an error of about 5–10%

 Similarly, according to them, the duration of the year of the Earth is 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds, according to the calculation of modern time there is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds

 Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and that some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun
 is prakaar aisa suzav diya jaataa he ki aryabhat kii sangannaayen anternihit surya kendrit model par aadhaarit thim, jisame grah surya kaa chakkar lagaate hai

 haalaanki kuch log yah sweekaar karte hai ki aryabhat kii pranali purv ke ek surya kendrit model se upji thi jiskaa gyaan unako nahin tha
 It has also been claimed that they considered the planets to be elliptical, although no primary evidence has been presented for this

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation he influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha,or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai

 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential

 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate

 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today

 richter paimaana bukamp kii tarangon kii tivrata maapne kaa ek ganitiya paimaana he
 The simple logarithm of the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the ground and the random small amplitude at the time of an earthquake is called the 'richter scale'
 richter paimaane kaa vikaas 1930 ke dashak main kiya gaya tha
 From 1970 onwards, 'moment magnitude') was used in place of the Richter scale for the measurement of earthquake intensity
 'riktar paimaane' kaa puraa naam richter pariman pareekshan paimaana he or laghu rup main ise sthanik pariman likhte hai
 This scale is represented by a number to measure the amount of geological energy emitted from an earthquake
