 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not

 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD

 ‘ yah to kavita kaa kaam he lekin unke yahaan to kavi par or kavi ke kaam par bhi ek puri kavita he : ‘biimaar nahin he vah, kabhi-kabhi biimaar-sa pad jaataa he / unki khushi ke liye jo sachmuch biimaar rahete hai / kaviyon kaa koi thikaana nahin, na jane kitni baar ve / apni kavitaaon main jite or marate hai / unke kabhi na marane ke bhi udhaaharan hai / unki khushi ke liye jo kabhi nahin marate hai
 Such poetry composed of utterances and idioms in relation to ecstasy and biography is rare in literature
 raag, phag or aag bhi unki kavitaaon main nayi samvednaa ke saath aate hai
 They organize their energy between tradition and modernity, so any historical, mythological and mythical fantasy in their poetry comes with the same ease as fire is told in every object
 yah aag jab kavita ke rup main aati he to phir bhale hi hameshaa ek nadi kaa kinaaraa vahaan maujuud ho, uski lapten hamen tarah-tarah se pighalaati, pakaati yaa jhulasaati rahati he
 On reaching this point, Kunwar Narayan says that - 'I will play with fire'
 aise vakt yah ehsaas hamen samoochee samakaleenta ke saath uthaakar vartmaan ke puure itihaas se jod detaa he jab kavi kahata he ki- ‘meri bharpoor nafrat kar sakane kii takat dinon-din ksheen padati ja rahi he’
 Direct opposition and extreme hatred are always weakened in front of many human qualities, and in the world of creators, in the face of the words Shakespeare, Galib, Guru Nanak, Kamban Tyagaraj, Muttuswamy and love-sickness, as soon as the words of Meera were made
 They start fighting with all the hate
 kunwar narayan kii kavita ek aisi duniya rachati he jis main roj-roj hoti hatyaon or sampradayik durbhaavna ke khilaaf kavi manushya ke rup main ek daagdar jivan bhi jeene ko taiyaar he, basharte ki vah kisi bahut bade pyaar kaa jakhm ho
 Leaving aside the stubbornness of saying and making, the element which is overshadowed in the poems of this collection of Kunwar Narayan seems to be emanating from the 'wound' poem: 'it would have been nice to have gone through these streets / And if the stain was good If it was to be felt then / there would not be any splash of innocent blood on clothes / there would be a wound of some great love on the soul / which would never die
 ‘ yahaan sthitiyon ko badalane kii teevr ichha or manushya se nafrat na kar paane ke bich kaa in dinon chalata sagharsh bhi kalatmak oonchaaiyon ke saath dekha ja saktaa he

 prithviraj-raso kaa kavy soundarya ke sambandh main aaj tak koi thos vichaar -vimarsh nahin hua keval raso kii aitihaasikta par hi vichaar -vimarsh hua
 For a proper poetic assessment of Raso we have to consider the following headings
 yadi ham aitihaasik drushti ko tyaag kar kavyatv kii drushti se raso kii itivritti kaa moolyankan karen ,to hamen kavi kii apurv kalpana -shakti kii mahatta sweekaar kerani hogi
 
which historians slander Raso about the origin of the episodes, in fact, he is the symbol of the poet's poetic efficiency
 prithviraj or jayachand ke virodh kaa kaaran sanyukta kaa apharan chaahe na ho ,kintu kavi ne rasraj kii abhivyakti ke liye is bahaane sundar prasang dhund nikaala he
 By imagining a love affair as the cause of wars, he is saved from being an expression of pure hostility
 prithviraj kaa baar -baar chama kar dena bhale hi aitihaasik tathy na ho, kintu isse nayak ke charitra kii udaartaa kaa prabhaav pathakon ke hryday par ankit ho jaataa he
 When Ghori repels Prithviraj in a chain of iron, the reader's soul becomes stung and all his sympathy rests with the defeated Prithviraj, not staying with the victorious Ghori
 isi prakaar prithviraj kaa shabd vedhi baan dwaara gori kaa badh karke atmotsarg kar dena nayak ke charitra ko bahut unchaa uthaa detaa he ,jo bhartiya mahakavy -parampara ke liye aavashyak
 is
 raso ke rachayita ne nagar ,upavan, van ,sarovar ,durg ,sena ,yuddh aadi varnan main kavi -hriday kaa parichay diya he
 Direct depiction of the battlefield: yahan keval sthir drishy kaa ankan hua he ,kintu raso main gatisheel chitron kaa bhi abhaav nahin he: Here, not only the visible form of war, but also its magnified form becomes clear: raso main mukhyatah vir evam shringaar ras kii vyanjana prasanganusaar hui he
 The enduring sentiment of Veer Rasa has been expressed in vigorous style
 yatha : Similarly, in the beauty of Padmavati, the beauty of Shringar Ras is the use of perfect style: yahan kavi nayika chandra kii solah kalaon se susajjit karke hi santusht nahin ho gaya he,apitu baalyavastha main chandramaa dwaara isi chandramukhi ke sameep baith kar rasapan karne kii kalpana ne uske mahatv ko or bhi badha diya he
 The method for the organization of the various parts of the heroine not only had to collect different components, but she also had to use a special mold
 mahakavi chand ne nari -soundarya ke atirikt shringaar ras ke anya angon --vay ,sandhi ,yauvanagam ,anuraag, pratham milan sanyogkalin lajja aadi kaa bhi varnan purna talleenta ke saath kiya he
 He has achieved success in the representation of coincidental efforts in the expression of disambiguation
 ek udhaaharan drashtavy he ; Here the frequency of "increased separation multiple hair" is done in such a way that it automatically realizes the gradual increase of disconnections
 antim pankti main viyog kii vruddhi kii tulana din chadhane par kul -vadhu kii lajja se kii gai he
 The poet has introduced his sharp vision by comparing one subtle sentiment to another
 isi prakaar sab sukh sadhano ke vidyaman hote hue bhi viyog main unka swaad kis prakaar parivartit ho jaataa he ,iskaa anubhav kavi chaiyn kii nayika ke mukh se suniye-- "they are palaces, they are Yoginipur, they are herds of companions, but in the absence of the coincidence of a dear husband, i do not like anything
 "vir or shringaar ras ke atirikt anya rason kii bhi vyanjana raso main prasanganusaar hui he
 In particular, the portrayal of humor, horror and raudra was done from place to place
 "munh daridri ,tuchh sharir paane vaala or jangal kii had main rahane vaala pashu bardd dublaa kyon ho gaya?"iskaa uttar chandabaradaai ne bade vyangatmak dhang se dete hue kaha -- The meaning of this verse is that in fear of Maharaja Prithviraj, his enemies took such a deep word that there was nothing left for the poor man to eat
 aisi sthiti main uskaa dublaa ho janaa swaabhaavik he
 Needless to say that the poet has successfully portrayed humor by originating this entertaining affair
 vastutah rasokar main sarvatra ek mahakavi kii -si pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 Thus, we see that Prithviraj Raso is an adult creation in terms of emotional expression
 kala paksh kii drushti se bhi usamen alankaaron kaa prayog ,bhavanuroop bhashaa ,chhandon kii vividhta aadi visheshtaayen milti hai
 There is a lack of uniformity of language in it, but the defect is not so great that it reduces its importance
 kuch abhaav raso main khatakane vaale hai
 One is that the poet has based the motif of Veer Ras on the personal raga-desh
 ,atah usame mahakavy kii -si vyapaktaa nahin aa pai
 At that time, the nation was in great need of ethnic organization and unity, the poet's job is to rise above the atmosphere of his era and give a message for the future, but Rasocar could not do it
 isi prakaar shringaar ras main bhi prem bhav kii gambhirtha nahin aa pai ,nity naye vivaah rachaane vaale saamanton se isaki aashaa bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 The poet, adopting the feudalistic approach, has considered the woman as merely the object of enjoyment; He could not see the subtle beauty of her heart
 in sab dosha ke hote hue bhi prithviraj raso ek mahakavy he
 Deforestation means burning or cutting trees in areas of forests for several reasons; Trees and charcoal derived from them can be sold as a commodity and used by humans, while cleared land can be used as pasture or human habitat
 pedon ko is prakaar se kaatane or unhen punah na lagane ke parinaam swarup awaas ko kshati pahunchi he, jaev vividhta ko nuksaan pahunchaa he or vaataavaran main shushkta bad gayi he
 Also, the areas from which trees are removed often turn into wastelands
 aantarik mulyon ke liye jaagrukta kaa abhaav yaa unki upeksha, uttaradaayi mulyon kii kami, dhilaa van prabandhan or paryaavaran ke kanoon, itane bade paimaane par vanonmulan kii anumati dete hai
 In many countries deforestation is sustained, resulting in processes such as deletion, climate change, desertification and displacement of indigenous people
 saadhaaran shabdon main, vanonmulan isliye hoti he kyon ki van bhoomi aarthik rup se vyavhaarya nahin he
 Along with increasing the amount of land for farming, wood is used by more than 200 million people all over the world
 ek anuvanshik sansaadhan ke rup main wanon kii anumaanit mulya kii pushti kisi bhi aarthik adhyayan ke dwaara nahin kii gayi he
 As a result, the owners of forest land suffer from not cleaning the forests and this affects the welfare of the whole society
 vikasshil duniya ke pariprekshya se, jaev vividh sroton or carbon sinc ke rup main wanon ke laabh praathmik rup se viksit or amir rashtron ko pahonchte hai or is sevaao ke liye paryaapt kshatipurti nahin kii jaati he
 As a result of which some countries have a lot of forest, the developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States, cut their forests centuries ago and have benefited a lot from it and have equal opportunities for developing countries
 It would be wrong to refute
