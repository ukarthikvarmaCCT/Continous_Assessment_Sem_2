 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations

 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time

 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete

 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 There were many types of yagyas during the Vedic period
 yajna us yug kaa sabase bada saanskrithik samaaroh hota tha
 These sacrifices were also ordinary - and extraordinary
 kuch yagyon ko to raja-maharaja hi kar sakate the, jaise ashwamedh, rajasuya, aadi
 But some yajna had to be performed regularly by all Arya householders
 in yagyon kaa kram gopad brahman main is prakaar bataaya gaya he- Agnayadhan, Poornahuti, Agnihotra, Dashapurnayas, Agrahayana Chaturmasya, Pashuvadha, Agni-chotam, Rajasuya, Bajpai, Ashwamedha, Purushmeadha, Sarvamedha, Dakshinaha having many Dakshina-like and innumerable Dakshinavalas
 inamen agnyadhan or agnihotra pratidin ke yajna the
 On every Amavas and Poornima, Daspurnamas were performed
 phalgun poornima, asadha poornima or karthik poornima ko chaturmasya yajna kiye jate the
 The yagyas that were performed at the beginning of uttarayan-dakshinayan - they were called Agrahayana or Navasayeshthi Yajna
 isi prakaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke uddeshyon ko lekar bhinn-bhinn yajna hote the
 This Agrahayana or Navasayesthi Yajna became the festival of Deepawali
 yajna chaahe chote hai yaa bade, parvon hi main hote the
 The festival is called joint or joint
 yah sandhi parv ritu or kaal sambandhi hua karti thi
 Yajnas were performed in the evening of the morning, the treaty of parties, the treaty of mass, the treaty of Ritu, the treaty of Chaturmasya, the treaty of Ayen
 ye sandhiyaan parv kahati thim
 At the end of the sacrificial fire, there was an abhirth bath
 ab yagyon kii paripati to band ho gai he, par parvon par vishesh tirthon par snaan ab bhi dharm krity mana jaataa tha
 Kartik Purnima, Vaisakhi festival, Kumbh festival, etc
 Even today, big baths take place in haridwar-prayagnaic areas
 karthik poornima kaaganga snaan bahut prasiddh he
 The Aryans used to think highly of Uttarayan and Dakshinayan
 `nanya: pantha vidyatesnay' rituon main hi yajna karne se yagyakarta kaa naam ruthvij arthath rituon main yajan karne vaala prasiddh hua
 Astrological knowledge was required in Yajna seyajnas, and from the Yajna ceremonies, the transformation of the Grahanakshatras with Rutu was known

 In Egypt too, Minerva, Juno, Vensa, Hria, Hectry, Diana and Daya Devipuji used to go through the parts of Adibhama Isis
 unki puja chandan-akshat-dhoop-deep-maance-rudhir se hoti thi
 Just as here, Sri Devi Durga killed Mahishasura, whose face was like a buffalo, similarly the Egyptian god isis-minerva killed the demon Hecus hio-potomus
 jis prakaar ke navaratri yahaan hote hai
 The same type of Navratri festival is also held in Egypt

 There Ishtag is called 'kenav'

 Similarly, the Egyptians also make swastika-dualism triangles, trident and trident symbols
 misr sumer, bawul, asyria aadi deshonmen maatrasatta ke kul gotra chalate the
 With this, Goddess worship became popular there
 bharat main vahiin se yah pratha ai
 In the Veda, the words 'na na' for mother have come to mean 'ta ta' for father
 nighantu main bhi na naa shabd he
 In the Rigveda, mother is neither called nor mother in Syria and Asia Minor was called 'na na'

 But there was a Sumerian mother god Kipuja in Esareh

 The kingdom of Surya dynasty in India was called the Vishkrama of Suryamandal
 unki stri kaa naam sangya tha, jo tvashtavishwakarm kii putree thi, tathaa jo uttar kuru ke adhishwar the
 It is said that Vishnu attained Lakshmi in the churning of the sea
 par yah alankarikhai
 In fact, it is the incident of the meeting of a gold mine, which was received by the Devta Nagatiyan together
 peeche jaise saraswati nadi ko vidya kii devi maanalia gaya, usee bhaanti dhan-lakshmi ko dhan kii devi maan liya gaya
 And Vishnu had received her - so she became Vishnu's charanasevika
 parantu `shri'naam se lakshmi bhi, devi parvati bhi or durga bhi teenon kaa samavesh kiya gaya
 Pooja Aryans used to sing bhajans - not poojas
 parantu devi-devataaon kaa aage pujanarambh ho gaya
 There is no sign of worship in the Veda
 puja main pushp-deep,akshat or chandan kaa mahatva he
 People generally relate the meaning of worship to the worshiping metal
 parantu puj dhaatu pracheen sanskrit main nahinhai
 The word is synonymous with the Dravidian word 'poo', which means 'flower'
 dravid kaa hi doosraa shabd `je' he, jiskaa arth he karnaa
 Thus worship means 'pushpakarma'
 aaryon kaa yajna pashukarm tha, par dravidonka `pushpakarm'
 Later, the Aryans took a flower and gave him the worship
 ek dravid dhaatu `pusu' bhi he jiskaa arth lepan he
 Lepan also implies the meaning of sandalwood or vermilion
 is prakaar jahaan deviki pratishtha anarya paddati he, vahaan puja bhi dravid yaa aagney paripatihai is prakaar diwali kaa vah pracheen tyohaar, jo vastav main ayan yajna tha,dravid or aagney samskritiyon se milakar lakshmi puja kaa tyohaar ban gaya
ganesh puja ganesh armbh kaa devtaa he
 Ganesha Pujan takes place at the beginning of all auspicious deeds
 aajkal pandit log mitti ke ek dhele par kalava lapet kar useganesh kaa pratinidhi bana--on gananatva ganpati -unknotn mark- ha naamahe
 
 
 Worship Ganesha with mantra
 is mantra main `ganpati' shabd aayaa he isise andhparampara se yah mantra ganesh puja kaa mantra ban gaya he
 Actually, this mantra has nothing to do with Ganesha worship
 yah yajurveda kaa mantrahai--or ashmedh yajna se sambandhitahai
 Mahidhar in his commentary of this mantra has interpreted Ganapati as a horse, in fact, 'ganesh' is a symbol of Oum
 veda mantron kearmbh main `oum'aata he
 Oum is a symbol of Mangalacharan, similarly Ganesha also became a symbol of Mangalacharan
 `oum' or ganesh ke rup sadrishy he
 With the contact of Vedic traditions and foreign Dravidian and Igneous castes etc
, the worship of trees, animals etc
 also became prevalent among Hindus
 buddhakaal mekhanek prakaar ke pashuon kaa pujan hota tha or unke alag-alag sampradaay bane huethe
 It is written in Chulniddes- 'hathivantikanam' Hathti Devta
 assavatikanissa devtaa, gotikana gavi devtaa, kukkutavati kaanan kukuta devtaa, kakvatikanakakadevataa, nagawani-vaanan nagdevataa--aggevatikana agnidevtaa
 
 
 
 
 
 ' is prakaar hathi, ghoda, gaay, kutta, murga, kauwa, naag aadi pashu-pakshiyonko devtaa maanakar poojane waalon ke sampradaay chal pade the
 In these, the figures were made, they made Mangalacharan of the said Omkar as an elephant and made the form of Ganesha
 is sambandh main ganesh puraana main kuch shloke bhi he jo hamaremat kii pushti karte hai-- aunkaar rupi bhagwaan yo vedadi pratishthit:

 ganesh kii onkaarmayibhaavna sorupi shatabdi main gyaneshwar ne kii thi
 The color of Ganesha is called red
 mongolon kii kuch jatiyaan laal rang kii thi
 It is possible that the Mongols, Shakas, Huns, Kushan castes should have brought this anthropological religion in the beginning
 or unke hindu dharmamen mil jane ke baad unka hastivruthik or aaryon kaa vaidic oum milakar hathike siravaale chuuhe kii sawari karte or modak khaane vaala ganesh ban gaya ho
 Onkar's head is the head and body of Ganesha

 ganesh kii kalpana armbh main `vighnesh' ke rupamen sthapit hui
 Seeing the terrible form of elephant on human body, they started to worship them with fear
 par jab baudhon kii mahayan shakha kaa pradurbhaav hua to usamenvighnesh dhire `vighn har' ban gaye
 In the mythological society, they are considered to be obstacles
 parantu uttar bharat main to unki murtiyon choti-choti hi banati hai
 There are huge statues in the temples of the south
 jo bhayanak bhi he
 Sharada is considered his wife in Maharashtra
 par dakshin bhartiya unhenbrahmacharee hi maanate hai
 There is a rare deity of Ganesha in the tantras
 vikramaki paanchavin-chhathi shatabdi main ganesh puja armbh ho gai hogi
 Because it is discussed in the Puranas
 tantron main to he hi
 Buddha and Mahavira did not take Ganesh Kanam
 parantu jab aaryon ne padosi anaryon se gadhe par savarikarne vaali sheetladevi, kute par sawari ganthne vaale bhairav, ko devtaa rupamen grahan kiya tab mooshak vaahan vighnesh ganesh ko bhi grahan kar unhen vighneshbana daalaa
 And somehow by adding the rhyme of the word communion, a Ved Mantra was also included in his worshiping party and later became a Upanishad
 saathhi ganesh baudhon kii mahayan shakha main bhi prasiddh ho gaye
 Ganesha is the total deity of Gods in North India as Ganesha Puja is started
 parantu dakshin main ganesh ko kul devtaa kii bhaanti puja jaataa he
 Ganesha was the total deity of the Peshwas
 isi se jo tilak ne maharashtra main ganeshotsav kaa prachlankia jo ab uski bhaanti bhadrapada maas main dhoomdhaam se hota he, jaisaa asvinamas main bengal main durga pujan
 The Peshwa was a Chitpavan Brahmin, while Tilak was also a Chitpavan
 chitpaavan brahman arya nahin he, misr se aaye hue yahudee hai
 That is why the behavior of the bread daughter of chimpanavans is not from the Brahmins of Maharashtra
 maharashtriya brahman deshsth kahate hai or chitpaavan kokensth
 His rise was due to Shivaji
 shivaji ne jab raja pad dhaaran karnaa chaha tabamaharashtra ke brahmanon ne unhen shudra hone ke kaaran raja maananese inkaar kar diya
 He was honored by the Chitpavans after which he received the title of Peshwa and after the king, all the military and political rights were handed to him
 baad main peshwa hi maharashtra ke kartadharta ban gaye
 With this, Ganesha also became the Jan Dev of Maharashtra with the emergence of Chitpavan
 Swastik Swastik is also considered as Hindu Mars sign
 yah bhi vastav main oum kaa hibhrasht rup he
 Onkar itself has become a swastika symbol
 yah swastikapracheen misr or america ke peru tathaa mexico main shubh chinh mana jaataa tha
saraswati hindu or jain donon hi saraswati ko vaagdevi maanate hai
 The ancient Greeks believed many Vidyadevas under the name 'muse'
 jo bhinn-bhinn kalaonor vigyaanon kaa pruthak prabhutv karti thi
 But both Hindu and Jain religions collectively consider Saraswati Devi as the mastermind of all disciplines
 saraswati ko brahma kii putree kaha he
 Brahma in the Rigveda means prayer chant and the person singing it was called Brahma
 peeche yajyake ashyaksh ko brahma kehane lage
 In this way Brahma is also the source of sub-disciplines due to the origin of the Vedas, hence Saraswati is his daughter Vagdevi
 hindoolakshmi ko praadhanya dete hai
 But to Jeannie Saraswati
 karthikakrishna amavasya ko deepawali ke din hindu lakshmi pujan karte hai, vahankarthik shukla panchami ko shwethamba jain saraswati pujan kartehain, is avasar par ve apane dharm granthon kii jaanch padtaal jhaad ponch, safaithatha naveen veshtano se veshtit kar sandali par sajaate hai or samuhik pujanakarte hai
 In addition to Arhantdev, many Gods and Goddesses are considered in Jainism
 jaise shashan devtaa, yaksha yakshini, kshetrapal, dikpala, navagraha,yogini, ashtamatrika, prasad, sampradaay-deviyaan, kul-deviyaan
 Saraswati is considered as the chief among them
 jain shastron main saraswati pujan kafal samyagdarshan-gyaan-charitra aadi gunon kii uplabdhi karnaa bataaya he jain dharm mensolah vidya devi maani jaati he
 Saraswati Adhishwari is among them all

 Medieval Music Distinction of North and South The era of prosperity of Indian music was the first of the Muslims to enter India

 abul mujaffar muhiuddeen mohammad aurangzeb alamgir jise aamtaur par aurangzeb yaa alamgir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha bharat par rajya karne vaala chatha mogul shaasha tha
 His reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707
 aurangzeb ne bhartiya upmahadweep par aadhi sadi se bhi zyada samay tak rajya kiya
 He was the longest reigning Mughal ruler after Akbar
 apane jeevankaal main usne dakshini bharat main mogul samrajya kaa vistaar karne kaa bharsak prayaas kiya par uski mrityu ke pashchaat mogul samrajya sikudne laga
 The Mughal Empire reached the climax of its expansion under Aurangzeb's rule
 wo apane samay kaa shaayad sabase dhani or shaatishalee vyakti tha jisane apane jeevankaal main dakshin bharat main praapt vijayon ke jariye mogul samrajya ko saadhe baarah lakh varg mile main failaayaa or 15 karod logon par shashan kiya jo kii duniya kii aabaadi kaa 1 / 4 tha
 Aurangzeb imposed fatwa-e-alamgiri on the entire empire and also imposed an additional tax on non-muslims for some time
 gair-musalmaan janata par shariat lagu karne vaala wo pehla musalmaan shaasha tha
 During his reign, the Mughals had the highest number of Hindus among their court
 or sikhon ke guru teg bahadur ko darashikoh ke saath milakar baghaavat ke jurm main mrityudand diya gaya tha
 Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618 in Dahod, Gujarat
 wo shahjahan or mumtaz mahal kii chhathi santan or teesraa betaa tha
 His father was the Subedar of Gujarat at that time
 june 1626 main jab uske pita dwaara kiya gaya vidroh asafal ho gaya to aurangzeb or uske bhai daara shukoh ko unke dada jahangir ke lahore vaale darbar main nur jahaan dwaara bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya
 Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra Fort on 26 February 1628 when Shah Jahan was proclaimed the Mughal Emperor
 yaheen par aurangzeb ne arabi or farsi kii aupchaarik shiksha praapt kii
 According to Mughal practices, Shah Jahan appointed Shahzada Aurangzeb as the Subedar of the Deccan in 1634
 aurangzeb kirki ko gaya jiskaa naam badalakar usne aurangabad kar diya
 In 1637 she married Rabia Durrani
 idhar shahjahan mogul darbar kaa kaamkaaj apane bete daara shikoh ko saunpane laga
 Aurangzeb's sister died in an accident in 1644
 aurangzeb is ghatana ke teen hafte baad agra aayaa jisase uske pita shahjahan ko usapar behad krodh aayaa
 He dismissed Aurangzeb from the rank of Subedar of Deccan
 aurangzeb 7 maheenon tak darbar nahin aa sakaa
 Later Shah Jahan made him the Subedar of Gujarat
 aurangzeb ne sucharu rup se shashan kiya or use iskaa sila bhi mila, use badakhshaan or balkh kshetra kaa soobedaar bana diya gaya
 After this he was also made governor of Multan and Sindh
 is dauraan wo faras ke safaviyon se qandahar par niyantran ke liye ladata rahaa par use haar ke alaava or kuch mila to wo tha- apane pita kii upeksha
 In 1652 he was rebuilt the Subedar of the Deccan
 usne golconda or bijapur ke khilaaf ladaaiyaan kii or nirnaayak kshan par shahjahan ne sena waapas bula lee
 This greatly hurt Aurangzeb as Shah Jahan was doing this at the behest of his brother Dara Shikoh
 san 1652 main shahjahan biimaar padaa or aisa lagane laga ki shahjahan kii maut aa jaaegi
 The power struggle started in Dara Shukoh, Shah Suja and Aurangzeb
 shah suza, jisane apane ko bengal kaa governor ghoshit karavaaya tha ko harkar burma ke arakaan kshetra janaa padaa or 1659 main aurangzeb ne shahjahan ko tajmahal main shahi khajaane ko karch karne ke zurm main najarband karne ke baad apane ko badshaah ghoshit karavaaya
 Dara Shikoh was hanged for treason
 aurangzeb ne kabhi bhi shahi khajaane ko swayan par karch nahin kiya
 The Mughals, especially since Akbar, had been lenient on non-muslims, but Aurangzeb was just the opposite
 aurangzeb ne jazia kar phir se aarambh karavaaya, jise akbar ne khatm kar diya tha
 He forced the Kashmiri Brahmins to accept Islam
 kashmiri brahmanon ne sikhon ke nauven guru teg bahadur se madad maangi
 When Tegh Bahadur opposed this, Aurangzeb hanged him
 is din ko sikh aaj bhi apane tyohaaron main yaad karte hai
 During the reign of Aurangzeb, there was a wave of war-rebellion-repression-climbing etc
 pashchim main sikhon kii sankhya or shakti main badhottaree ho rahi thi
 He eventually defeated Bijapur and Golconda in the south, but in the meantime Shivaji's Maratha army plagued him
 shivaji ko aurangzeb ne giraftaar kar to liya par shivaji or sambhaaji ke bhaag nikalne par uske liye behad fikr kaa sabab ban gaya
 After all, Shivaji Maharaja defeated Aurangzeb and Marathas in India increased their strength throughout the country even after Shivaji's death the Marathas harassed Aurangzeb
 is bich hinduon ko islam main parivartit karne kii niti ke kaaran rajput uske kilaaf ho gaye the or uske 1707 main marane ke turant baad unhone vidroh kar diya
 Aurangzeb's administration had more Hindus than other Mughal emperors and Shivaji was also involved
 mughal itihaas ke bare main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki duusare baadshahon kii tulana main aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sabase zyada hindu prashasan kaa hissaa the
 Historical facts show that during the reign of Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, Hindus constituted 24 per cent of the various posts in the army, other important posts in the court and various geographical administrative units, which rose to 33 per cent during Aurangzeb's time
 em athar ali ke shabdon main kahen to yah tathy is dharna ke virodh main sabase tagada saboot he ki badshaah hindu manasabadaaron ke saath pakshpaat karata tha
 a large number of Rajputs were appointed to senior positions in Aurangzeb's army 
 maratha or sikhon ke khilaaf aurangzeb ke hamale ko dharmik chashme se dekha jaataa he lekin yah nishkarsh nikaalte vakt is baat kii upeksha kar di jaati he ki tab yuddh kshetra main mughal sena kii kaman aksar rajput senapati ke haath main hoti thi
 Historian Yadunath Sarkar writes that at one time Shivaji himself was a mansabdar in Aurangzeb's army
 kaha jaataa he ki ve dakshin bharat main mughal sultanate ke pramukh banaae jane vaale the lekin unki sainya kushalta ko bhaanpane main naakaam rahe aurangzeb ne is niyukti ko manjuuri nahin di
 Aurangzeb lived a holy life
 apane vyaktigat jivan main vah ek adarsh vyakti tha
 He was completely free from all the enemies that were common among the kings of Asia
 vah yeti-jivan jeeta tha
 He was restrained in eating, drinking, dressing and all other amenities of life
 prashasan ke baari kaam main vyast rahete hue bhi vah apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye quran kii nakal karke or tapiyaan sikar kuch paisa kamaane kaa samay nikaal letaa tha
 Not only Aurangzeb, one thing is said about all the Muslim kings of medieval India that none of them were Indians
 vaise ek str par yah bachakaana or bematlab kaa tark he kyonki 17veen shatabdi ke bharat main raashtra jaisi avadharana kaa to kahin astitv hi nahin tha
 Even after this, however, this thing does not apply at least in the case of Aurangzeb
 yah mughal badshaah pakkaa ucchwargeey hindustani tha
 Its simple logic is that he was born in Dahod, Gujarat and was raised like children of upper-class Indian families
 puure mughalkaal main braj bhashaa or uske sahitya ko hameshaa sangrakshan mila tha or yah parampara aurangzeb ke shashan main bhi jari rahi
 Columbia University historian Alison Bush says that there was an atmosphere of encouragement to Braj in Aurangzeb's court
 badshaah ke bete ajam shah kii braj kavita main khaasi dilchaspee thi
 He patronized some big names of Braj literature such as Mahakavi Dev
 isi bhashaa ke ek or bade kavi vrund to aurangzeb ke prashasan main bhi niyukt the
 The official writing language of the court during the Mughal period was Persian, but before the rule of Aurangzeb, the language prevailing between the emperors and the courtiers had become hindi-urdu
 ise aurangzeb ke us patr se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo usne apane 47 varshiya bete ajam shah ko likhaa tha
 The emperor had presented a fort to his son and ordered to be sung on the occasion
 ajam shah ko likhe patr main aurangzeb ne likhaa he ki jab vah baccha tha to use nagaadon kii aawaaj khub pasand thi or vah aksar kahata tha, ‘babaaji dhan-dhan!’ is udhaaharan se yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki aurangzeb kaa betaa tatkaaleen prachlit hindi main hi apane pita se baatcheet karata tha
 Emperor Aurangzeb acknowledged the importance of the religion of Islam, making the 'quran' the basis of his rule
 usne sikkon par kalma khudwana, nauroj kaa tyohaar manaanaa, bhaang kii kheti karnaa, gaanaa-bajaanaa aadi par roak laga di
 Banned the practice of sati in 1663 AD
 tirth kar punah lagaaya
 In 11 years of his rule, 'jharokha Darshan', in the 12th year, banned 'tuladan system', banned Hindu festivals in 1668 AD
 1699 i
 main usne hindu mandiron ko todane kaa aadesh diya
 'muhtasib' was appointed by Aurangzeb in large cities
 1669 i
 main aurangzeb ne banaras ke ‘vishwanath mandir’ evam mathura ke ‘keshav raay madingr’ ko tudwa diya
 He abolished about 80 taxes levied against the Sharia
 inhen main ‘aabwab’ naam se janaa jane vaala ‘raaydaari’ or ‘pandari’ naamak sthaneey kar bhi shaamil the
 Aurangzeb considered converting 'darul Herb' to 'darul Islam' as his important goal
 aurangzeb ke samay main braj main aane vaale tirth−yatriyon par baari kar lagaaya gaya jazia kar phir se lagaaya gaya or hinduon ko musalmaan banaaya gaya
 Aurangzeb's atrocities are mentioned in the compositions of poets of that time
 aurangzeb dwaara lagaaya gaya jajia kar us samay ke hisaab se tha
 Akbar abolished the Jaziya tax, but it was re-enacted during Aurangzeb
 jajia saamaanya karon se alag tha jo gaiyr muslimon ko chukaana padataa tha
 It had three levels and it was determined by the income of the person concerned
 is kar ke kuch apwaad bhi the
 The poor, unemployed and physically challenged people did not come under its purview
 inke alaava hinduon kii varna vyavastha main sabase upar aane vaale brahman or sarkari adhikari bhi isse baahar the
 Such was the religious tax zakat imposed on Muslims, which was necessary for every rich Muslim
 aadhunik mulyon ke mandandon par jajia nischitarup se ek pakshpaati kar vyavastha thi
 Modern nations cannot make such a distinction on the basis of religion and caste
 isiilie jab ham 17veen shatabdi kii vyavastha ko aadhunik rashtron ke paimaane par ise dekhte hai to yah bahut arajak vyavastha lag sakati he, lekin aurangzeb ke samay aisa nahin tha
 Other examples are also found in that period
 jaise maraathon ne dakshin ke ek bade hisse se mughalon ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 Their tax system was also biased at about the same level
 ve musalamaanon se jakaat vasuulate the or hindu aabaadi is tarah kii kisi bhi kar vyavastha se baahar thi
 Aurangzeb had built more temples than he had broken
 vishwaprasiddh itihaaskaar richard iton ke mutabik mughalkaal main mandiron ko dhahaana durlabh ghatana hua karti thi or jab bhi aisa hua to uske kaaran raajnneetik rahe
 According to Eaton, the same temples were demolished in which the rebels were given shelter or with the help of which a conspiracy was made against the emperor
 us samay mandir todane kaa koi dharmik uddeshy nahin tha
 Aurangzeb, notorious in this case, also followed the same rule of the Sultanate
 uske shasankaal main mandir dhahaane ke udhaaharan bahut hi durlabh hai or jo hai unki jad main raajnneetik kaaran hi rahe hai
 Aurangzeb, for example, never targeted temples in South India, while most of the army was stationed here during his reign
 uttar bharat main usne jarur kuch mandiron par hamale kiye jaise mathura kaa keshav raay mandir lekin iskaa kaaran dharmik nahin tha
 The Jats of Mathura revolted against the Sultanate, hence the attack
 thik iske ulat kaarnon se aurangzeb ne mandiron ko sangrakshan bhi diya
 This was his offering to Hindus who were loyal to the emperor
 kings college, landan kii itihaaskaar catherine butler to yahaan tak kahati hai ki aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tode, usase zyada banawaye the
 Scholars like Catherine Frank, m Athar Ali and Jalaluddin also point out that Aurangzeb had given grants to several Hindu temples, including the movable Bari Math in Banaras, Balaji Temple in Chitrakoot, Someshwar Nath Mahadev Temple in Allahabad and Umananda Temple in Guwahati
 Famous names are
 jis kalkhand yani mughalkaal main mandiron ko tode jane kii baat itani zyada prachlan main he, usamen hinduon dwaara kahin is baat kaa vishesh zikr nahin miltaa
 It can be argued that doing so in those times would not have been empty of danger, but even when the Sultanate came to an end in the 18th century, there is no mention of this
 ateet main mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mandir tode jane kaa mudda bharat main 1980-90 ke dashak main garm hua 
 a big argument is also made in trying to prove Aurangzeb as fanatical that he had banned music, but this is also not true
 catherine bataati hai ki sultanate main to kya sangeet par uske darbar main bhi pratibandh nahin tha
 On the day the emperor took over the throne, every year there was a lot of dancing and singing in the festival
 kuch dhrupadon kii rachana main aurangzeb naam shaamil he jo bataata he ki uske shasankaal main sangeet ko sangrakshan hasil tha
 Some historical facts also point to the fact that he himself was well versed in music
 mirat-e-alam main bakhtawar khan ne likhaa he ki badshaah ko sangeet visharadon jaisaa gyaan tha
 Mughal scholar Fakirullah has recorded the names of Aurangzeb's favorite singers and instrumentalists in a document titled Raag Darpan
 aurangzeb ko apane beton main ajam shah bahut priy tha or itihaas bataata he ki shah apane pita ke jeevankaal main hi nipun sangeetkaar ban chukaa tha
 Talking about music flourishing during Aurangzeb's reign, Catherine writes, 'the highest commentary on music was written in Persian during the time of Aurangzeb, compared to the entire Mughal period of 500 years
 ’ haalanki yah baat sahi he ki apane jivan ke antim samay main aurangzeb zyada dharmik ho gaya tha or usne geet-sangeet se duuri bana lee thi
 But looking at the things we have mentioned above, it can be assumed that he never made his personal wish the official policy of the Sultanate
 aurangzeb ke antim samay main dakshin main maraathon kaa jor bahut bad gaya tha
 The imperial army was not getting success in suppressing them
 isliye san 1683 main aurangzeb swayan sena lekar dakshin gaya
 He stayed away from the capital, in the same campaign for the last 25 years of his reign
 50 varsh tak shashan karne ke baad uski mrityu dakshin ke ahmednagar main 3 march san 1707 i
 main ho gai
 He was buried in the compound of the tomb of Fakir Buruhanuddin in Daulatabad
 uski niti ne itane virdohi paidaa kar diye, jis kaaran mogul samrajya kaa ant hi ho gaya

 The Royal Marriage Act, the Royal Marriage Act, was an act passed by the British Parliament in the year 1772 to establish rules to prove the validity of marriages of members of the British royalty and also to impose other legislations and rules in relation to royal marriages
 Was passed in order to avoid the relations of the members of the royal family, which reduced the status or value of the royal family
 
 shahi parivaar ke sahasyon ke nijee maamalon ke sambandh main, samprabhu ko die gaye adhikaar ke kaaran yah adhinium baari aalochana kaa paatr rahaa tha
 After the Perth Agreement of 2011, it was undone, and to a large extent limited interventions in its provisions
 is adhinium main die gaye praavdhaanon ke anusaar, rajpariwaar ke sadasyon ke keval un vivaahon ko vaid mana jayega, jo british samprabhu kii sweekruti se kiye jaaenge, or samprabhu kii asvitruti ke saath kiye gaye kisi bhi vivaah ko avaidh qaraar diya jayega, or us vivaah se hue saare santan or unke vanshajon kaa singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 However, members of the royal family could, despite the sovereign's disapproval, perform a legal marriage a year after informing the Privy Council of their desire to marry
 saath hi iske praavdhaan ke anusaar, shahi parivaar ke kisi bhi aisi "avaidh" vivaah main shariq hone ko bhi ek aapraadhik kaary qaraar diya gaya tha
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne

 In the same context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage performed without the sovereign's consent shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 Accordingly, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he

 visthaapan ek sadish raashi he
 When an object moves along any path from one point p to another point Q, the magnitude of this displacement will be the lowest distance between those two points and the direction of displacement will be in the direction of line PQ
 visthaapan ko s se darshaate hai
 The magnitude of the displacement is the length of the imaginary straight path, so it may be different from the total distance traveled by the particle
 jab koi vastu p bindu se q bindu tak jaati he or waapas punah p bindu aa jaati hai, tab visthaapan shunya hoga, jabaki chali gayi duuri shunya nahin hogi
 The rotation of the object can also be seen as a displacement at the time of studying the motion of a rigid body

 vyaktitv vikaar bhinn prakaar ke vyaktitvon or vyavhaaron kaa ek varg he jise american cycetric associyeshan nimna prakaar se paribhaashit karata he, The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems also defined personality disorders
 jise vishwa swasth sanghathan dwaara prakashit kiya gaya he
 Personality disorders are classified under ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders, especially under mental and behavioral disorders: 28F60-F69
29 Adult personality and behavior disorders
 adarsh rup se vyaktitv vikaar ke vibhinn swarup kisi vyakti kii vyavhaar sambandhi pravritiyon kii gambhir samasyaon se sambhddha hote hai, jo aamtaur par vyaktitv ke anekon pahaluon ko shaamil karte hai or lagbhag hameshaa hi kaaphi had tak nijee or saamaajik vidaaran se jude hote hai
 In addition, in many situations, personality disorder is inflexible and widespread, which is largely due to the self-conformity of such behavior and therefore the person considers it appropriate
 is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke falswaroop sambandhit vyakti saamanjasy sthapit ko hatotsahit karne karne kaa doshapurn kaushal grahan karne lagata he jo un nijee samasyaon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he jinase sambandhit vyakti atyadhik chintaa, bechaini or avsaad kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 The onset of these behavioral trends can be seen ideally from the later stages of adolescence to the onset of adulthood and in some unusual cases in childhood
 isliye yah asambhav hi he ki vyaktitv vikaar kaa nidaan 16 yaa 17 saal kii umr se pehle karwaanaa uchit hoga
 The general diagnostic instructions that apply to all types of personality disorders are given below, supplementary descriptions for these are given with each subtype
 vyaktitv vikaar kaa nidaan kaaphi vyaktiparak ho saktaa he; haalanki, anamy or vistrut vyavhaarik pravritiyon ke kaaran praayah kaaphi gambhir nijee or saamaajik samasyaayein ho jaati hai or saath hi saamaanya kriyaaon main bhi vyavdhaan padataa he
 Inflexible and unending trends of perception, thought and behavior are thought to be caused by a basic belief system and these systems are referred to as permanent fantasies or "dysfunctional ischemata"
 dsam IV exis II main, 10 prakaar ke vyaktitv vikaron ko 3 sanghon ke samooh main anusuchit karata he
 DSM also has a category for behavioral trends that do not fall under these 10 disorders but still manifest symptoms of personality disorder
 is shrenee ko yah naam diya gaya he: ve vyaktitv vikaar jinka vivaran anya rup main nahin diya gaya he
 Appendix b covers the following disorders
 ab bhi yah vikaar chikitsakon ke madhya vyapak str par maanya vikaron ke rup main dekhe jate hai, udahaaran ke liye theodor million
 This disorder is still accepted by millions of people
 yah DSM-III-R main the lekin DSM-IV se inhen hataa diya gaya tha
 Both of these were published in an appendix called "proposed diagnostic categories needing further study" and therefore have no concrete diagnostic criteria

 durvyavhaar kii gambhirtha sankhyikeey drushti se kaaphi mahatvapurn thi lekin chikitsakeey drushti se yah naganya thi, lakshan vigyaan kaa prasaran cluster A,B or c or mapank tak vistrut tha
 There is clear evidence that childhood abuse and neglect are pre-existing risks of developing personality disorders in the adult stage

 The abused group demonstrated the highest level of tendency towards psychopathology in the most evidenced manner
 yah dekha gaya ki aadhikarik rup se pramanit shaareerik durvyavhaar ke anubhav ne asaamaajik or aavegpurn vyavhaar ke vikaas main majboot bhoomika nibhaai
 duusari ore, upeksha ke rup main durvyavhaar kaa shikaar hue maamle jisane childehud pathology ko janm diya, uname vayaskta main aanshik deelepan kaa anubhav kiya gaya
 According to ICD-10, the diagnosis of personality disorder must be such that it satisfies the following general criteria in addition to the specific criteria prescribed under specific personality disorders: vyaktitv vikaar kii shuruaati avasthaaon yaa praarambhik praaroop ko ek bahu-aiami or sheeghra kaary karne vaali paddati kii aavashyaktaa he
 Personality development disorder is considered to be a risky state of the early stage of a personality disorder when one is of childhood or an adult

 Sleep is a natural recurrent altered state of consciousness of relatively suspended sensory and circulatory activity, characterized by inactivity of almost all voluntary muscles

 The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has further divided NREM into three levels: N1, N2 and N3
 The last level is also known as delta sleep or slow-wave sleep
 REM or NREM ke chakra main neend agrasar hoti jaati he, kram saamaanya rup se N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM hota he
 Much deeper sleep occurs early in the night, while the ratio of REM sleep increases later in the night and just before natural awakening
 1937 main sabase pehle alfred lee loomis or unke sahakarmiyon ne neend ke charnon kaa varnan kiya tha; jinhone neend kii vibhinn electroencephalography visheshtaon ko paanch staron main vibhajit kiya tha, jo jaagrathavastha se gahari neend ke kram kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In 1953, a different form of REM sleep was discovered and thus William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman reclassified sleep into NREM stages and REM
 1968 main "aar and ke sleep scoring manual" main alaan rechtcamphen or anthoni kales ne charnon ke maandand ko manakikrut kiya
 In the R&K standard, NREM sleep was divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep stages being stages 3 and 4
 charan 3 main, delta tarangen kul tarang pattern kaa 50% se kam hoti hai, jabaki charan 4 main ye 50% se adhik ho jaaya karti hai
 In addition, REM sleep was sometimes referred to as stage 5
 2004 main, AASM ne aar and ke scoring pranali kii samiksha ke liye AASM drishy scoring task force ko niyukt kiya
 Several changes were made from the review, the most important being the combination of Phase 3 and Phase 4 into Phase N3
 The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events
 uttejnaa or shwaas prashwaas sambandhi, hriday sambandhi tathaa gati vrutanton ko bhi joda gaya
 Sleep stages and other characteristics of sleep are commonly evaluated by polysomnography in a specialized sleep laboratory
 liye gayi maap main mastishk kii tarangon kaa EEG, netra gati kaa electroculography or kankaleey mansapeshi kii gatividhi kaa electromiography shaamil hai
 In humans, each sleep cycle lasts from 90 to 110 minutes on average, and each stage may have different physiological functions
 isse neend to aa sakati he or behoshee jaisi haalat lag sakati he, lekin isse shaareerik kaary puure nahin hote 
 According to the 2007 AASM Standards, NREM consists of three phases
 enariem main apekshaakrit kam sapane aayaa karte hai
 Phase N1 is related to the transition of the brain, in this phase the brain transitions from alpha waves of 8 to 13 Hz to theta waves of 4 to 7 Hz frequencies
 is charan ko kai baar uneendaapan yaa oonghti neend kaha jaataa he
 Sudden jerking and sleep emergence are also known as positive myoclonus, which may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1
 kuch logon ko is charan ke dauraan nidrajanak matibhram bhi ho saktaa he, jo unke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 During N1, the person loses some muscle condition and most conscious awareness of the external environment
 charan N2 kii visheshta he ki is dauraan neend kii takali 11 se 16 hertz or ke-samashtiyon ke bich gumti rahati he
 During this phase, as measured by EMG, muscle activity decreases and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears
 vayaskon main yah charan kul neend ke 45% se 55% main hua karata he
 The characterization of stage N3 is performed in such a way that at least 20% of the delta waves are between 0
5 and 2 Hz and the peak-to-peak amplitude is> 75 μv
 isi charan main raatri aatank, raatri shayyamutra, neend main chalanaa or neend main badbadana jaise parasomanian hua karte hai
 Many illustrations and descriptions still depict N3 phase with 20% –50% delta waves and N4 with more than 50% delta waves; These are jointly stage N3
 tej netra gati neend, yaa aariem neend, adhikansh maanav vayaskon kii kul neend kaa 20%–25% hua karti he
 Criteria for REM sleep include rapid eye movements and a rapid low-voltage EEG
 isi charan main sabase yaadgaar sapane aayaa karte hai
 At least in mammals, a descending muscle strain has been observed
 is tarah kaa pakshaaghaat jaruri ho saktaa he taaki shaareerik rachana ko aatm-kshati se bachaaya ja sake, jo ki is charan ke dauraan aksar aane vaale sajiv sapanom se shaareerik kriya ke jariye ho saktaa he
 Sleep time is controlled by the circadian clock, sleep-wake homeostasis and in humans, within certain limits, dependent on willful behavior
 sirkadian ghadi -ek bhitari samaynirdharak, taapmaana-asthirataa, anzime-niyantrak upkaran- adenosine ke saath agranukram main kaam karti he, yah ek aisa neurotransmeter he jo jaagrathavastha ke saath judy anek shaareerik prakriyaaon ko baadhit karata he
 Adenosine is prepared throughout the day; High levels of adenosine cause drowsiness
 dinchar pashuon main, hormone melatonin ke nirgaman ke kaaran sirkadian tatv se or sharir ke bhitari taapmaana main kramik kami se tandra yaa uneendaapan aayaa karata he
 Time is affected by one's chronotype
 sirkadian aavartan se ek sahi dhang se sanrachit or swasthyavardhak nidra prakaran kaa adarsh samay nirdhaarit hota he
 The spontaneity of homeostatic sleep needs to be balanced with the circadian element for satisfactory sleep
 sirkadian ghadi se praapt sandesh ke saath-saath yah sharir ko bataata he ki ise neend kii jarurat he
 The circadian rotation mainly determines wakefulness from sleep
 ek vyakti jo niyamit rup se jaldi uthta yaa uthati he, aam taur par vah apane saamaanya samay se adhik der tak soye nahin rah saktaa yaa sakati, yahaan tak ki bhale hi usne kam neend lee ho
 Sleep duration is influenced by the DEC2 gene
 kuch logon main is jin kaa utparivartan hota he; ve saamaanya se do ghante kam sote hai
 Professor of neurological science ying-hui Fu and colleagues breed mice carrying the DEC2 mutation, which would have slept less than normal mice
 neend kii sarvotkrisht maatra koi arthpurna avadharana nahin ho sakati, jab tak ki kisi vyakti ke sirkadian aavartan ke saath jodakar neend ke samay yaa timming ko na dekha jaay
 ek vyakti kaa bada neend prakaran apekshaakrit nishphal or aparyaapt ho saktaa he agar yah din ke "galat" samay main hota he; vyakti ko sharir ke taapmaana ke nunatam hone se pehle kam se kam chah ghante sona chahie
 The correct timing is when the following two markers or markers appear after the middle episode of sleep and before waking up: maanav neend umr ke hisaab se or vyaktiyon ke bich bhinn ho sakati he or agar din main uneendaapan yaa dushkriya na ho to neend ko paryaapt mana jaataa he
 a psychiatric study of one million adults at the University of California, San Diego found that those who live the longest are self-motivated and sleep six to seven hours a night
 neend kii avadhi or mahilaon main mrityu dar ke jokhim par hue ek anya adhyayan main bhi aisa hi parinaam paaya gaya
 Other studies show that "increased mortality is consistently associated with those who sleep more than 7 to 8 hours per day", although this study also says that it may be due to depression and socio-economic conditions, Which become co-related in terms of data
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki alarm lagaakar jagane waalon kii tulana main, jo log prakritik rup se kam neend ke baad jag jaaya karte hai, sirf uname kam neend ke ghante or kam rugnataa ke bich sah-sambandh prakat hote hai
 Researchers at the University of Warwick and University College London found that sleep deprivation more than doubled the risk of death from heart disease, but too much sleep may also be associated with doubling the risk of death, although primarily Not from heart disease
 professor francisco capusio ne kaha, "choti neend ko vajan badhane, ucchraktchaap or tip 2 madhumeh ke liye or kabhi-kabhi mrityu ke liye ek jokhim kaa kaarak banataa dekha gaya he; lekin choti neend-mrityu dar ke vipareet lambii neend ko badhi hui mrityu dar se jod sakane ke liye koi sambhavit tantra saamne nahin aayaa he, abhi isaki jaanch hona baaqi he
 Some people are involved, but depression, low socioeconomic status, and cancer-related illness are the reasons for this 


 In terms of prevention, our findings suggest that sleeping around seven hours per night continuously is optimal for health Or is best and a continued decrease in sleep may predispose to ill health
 " In addition, sleep difficulties are intimately associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, alcoholism, and bipolar disorder
 avsaad se grast vayaskon ke 90% tak main neend kii kathinaaiyaan pai gayi hai
 Anomalies found in the EEG include disruptions in sleep continuity, decreased delta sleep, and altered REM patterns, including relation to latency, overnight splitting, and density of eye movements
 viksit hone or thik se kaam karne ke liye bacchon ko pratidin adhik neend kii jarurat hoti he: navjaat shishu ke liye 18 ghante tak, iske baad umr badhane ke saath-saath isamen kami aati jaati he
 a newborn sleeps about 9 hours of REM sleep per day
 paanch varsh kii aayu tak yaa usase upar, keval do ghante se zaraa zyada REM neend liya karata he
 Sleep debt is the effect of not getting enough rest and sleep; Such large debts cause mental, emotional and physical fatigue
 neend ke karj ke parinamswaroop ucch stareey sangyanatmak kaary kar paane kii kshamta main kami aati he
 Neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have shown that the frontal regions of the brain are particularly responsive to homeostatic sleep pressure
 vaigyanik is baat par sahamat nahin hai ki kitna neend kaa karj jamaa hona sambhav he; kya yah kisi vyakti kii ausat neend ke hisaab se jamaa hota he yaa koi anya maandand he; na hi haal ke dashakon main audyogic vishwa main vayaskon main neend ke karj kii prabalata main koi ullekhneey badlaav aayaa he
 It has happened that children of western societies are sleeping less than before
 aisa andeh he ki kab or kitni der tak ek vyakti ko neend kii jarurat he, jaise neend se sambandhit vyavhaar kaa ek bada pariman, hamaare anuvanshiki dwaara viniyamit hota he
 Researchers have discovered some evidence that seems to support this notion
 neend ke prakaarya ke bare main anek siddhanton ne apni-apni vyakhya prastaavit kii he, lekin aisa pratibimbit hota he ki vishay ke bare main samajhadaari philhal adhuri he
 It is possible that sleep evolved to fulfill some fundamental function, and over time it took many functions
 yah mudda uthaaya gaya ki agar neend aavashyak nahin hoti, to yah jaanane kii apeksha kii jaaegi: To date no animal has been found that can meet these criteria
 anek main se neend ke kuch prastaavit kaary nimnlikhit hai
 Sleep has been shown to aid wound healing
 2004 main gumustekin at al
 dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki neend ke abhaav ke kaaran chuhon ke jaale ko thik hone main baadha aayi
 It has been found that sleep damage affects the immune system
 2007 main jager at al
 dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main, chuhon ko 24 ghante tak neend se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 a blood test of sleep deprived mice found a 20% decrease in white blood cell count when compared with a controlled group, a significant change in the immune system
 ab yah kaha janaa sambhav he ki "neend kii kshati rogksham kaary ko ksheen karti he or rogksham neend main herpher kii chunauti pesh karata he," or yah bataaya gaya ki standhari praani jo ki lambii neend main apana samay lagaaya karte hai ve rogksham pranali main nivesh karte hai, kyonki jin prajatiyon kii lambii neend hua karti he unamem adhik shwet rakt kan hua karte hai
 It is yet to be proven that sleep duration affects somatic development
 2007 main jeni at al
 dwaara ek adhyayan main 305 bacchon ke vikaas, oonchai or vajan ko darj kiya gaya, yah unke mata-pita ke saath sahasambaddh hokar kiya gaya, mata-pita dwaara bacchon ke sone ke samay kii jaankaree di jaati rahi or yah adhyayan nau varshon tak chalaa
 yah paaya gaya ki "bacchon main neend kii avadhi main badlaav kaa asar unke vikaas par hota nahin lagata he
 "it has been observed that sleep — and more specifically slow sleep — affects the increase of hormone levels in adult males
 aath ghante kii neend ke dauraan, vaan coutor, leprult or plat ne paaya ki jin logon main SWS kaa ooncha pratishat rahaa unamem hormone srav kii oonchi sanvruddhi bhi rahi, jabaki lam pratishat SWS waalon main hormone kii nimna vruddhi rahi
 There are many arguments in favor of the healthy work of sleep
 neend ke dauraan chayapachay charan sarjan kriya he; neend ke dauraan sanvruddhi hormone jaise sarjan kriya hormone jaise adhimaanya dhang se sravit hote hai
 In general, sleep duration in species is inversely related to animal size and directly related to basal metabolic rate
 ek bahut hi ucch aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath chuuhe rojaanaa 14 ghante tak kii neend liya karte hai, jabaki hathi or jiraph nimna aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath maatr 3-4 ghante hi sote hai
 Energy conservation can be done by resting peacefully without shutting down the composition of the atmosphere, which is a potentially dangerous situation
 ek mand nahin sone vaala jaanavar kii shikariyon se bache rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he, jabaki tab bhi vah urja sangrakshan karata rahata he
 Sleep, sleep, seems to serve a purpose or purposes other than conserving energy; For example, hibernating animals go to sleep again after waking up from hibernation due to lack of sleep during the hibernation period
 ve nishchit rup se acchhee tarah se aaraam kar chuke hote hai or sheetanidra ke dauraan urja sangrakshan bhi kiya he, lekin kuch anya kaaran se unhen sone kii jarurat he
 Rats that are kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia and, eventually, fatal septicemia
 REM neend kii ontogenetic pariklpana ke anusaar, navjaat shishu sambandhi REM neend ke dauraan hone vaali gatividhi khaskar sharir ke vikaas ke liye mahatvapurn he 
 Studies on the effects of active sleep deprivation have shown that early in life this deficiency causes behavior problems, permanent sleep disruption, decreased brain mass, and death of neuron cells in an unusual magnitude
 mastishk ke vikaas ke liye REM neend mahatvapurn prathit hota he
 Most of the sleep of infants is occupied by REM sleep, babies spend most of their time in sleep
 vibhinn prajatiyon main, janm lenevaala shishu jitna adhik aparipakv hota he, vah utana hi adhik samay REM neend main bitaata he
 The proponents also state that rem-induced muscle inhibition in the presence of brain activation aids brain development by activating the chetopagam, although this may put the infant in difficulty without any operational consequences
 iske atirikt, REM neend ke abhaav se baad ke jivan main vikaas kii asaamanyataayen paidaa hoti hai
 However, this has not been explained why older adults still need REM sleep
 jaleey stanpayi shishu shaishvavastha main REM neend nahin lete; umr badhane ke saath aise pashuon main REM neend badhati jaati he
 Scientists have described many ways in which sleep has been shown to be related to memory
 turnar, drumund, salaamat or brown dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main neend ke abhaav se karyrat smriti par prabhaav padataa dikhaaya gaya
 Working memory is important because it keeps information active for further processing and supports higher-level cognitive functions such as decision making, reasoning, and contextual memory
 adhyayan main 18 mahilaon or 22 purushon ko chaar dinon kii avadhi main prati raat sirf 26 minute hi sone kii anumati di gayi
 These individuals initially gave cognitive tests after complete rest and then were tested twice a day during four days of sleep deprivation
 antim pareekshan main, niyantrit samooh kii tulana main is neend-abhavagrast samooh kii ausat karyrat smriti vistaar main 38% kii giravat paayi gayi
 Memory seems to be affected differently by certain stages of sleep such as REM and slow sleep
 born, rasch or ges main uddhrut, ek adhyayan main anek maanav vishyon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha: jaagran niyantrit samoohon or neend pareekshan samoohon kaa
 neend or jaagran samoohon ko ek kaary sikhaaya gaya or phir sabhi pratibhaagiyon main santulit rup se raat ke kram main, raat kii shuruyaat or der raat donon hi samay pareekshan kiya gaya
 When those participants' brains were scanned during sleep, the hypnogram found that SWS dominated the sleep phase early in the night, representing an average of around 23% of sleep phase activity
 niyantrit samooh kii tulana main, ghoshnaatmak smriti pareekshan main aarambhik-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 16% behatar pradarshan kiya
 During late-night sleep, REM became the most active sleep stage, with approximately 24% and the late-night test group performed 25% better on the procedural memory test than the control group
 isse pataa chalata he ki der-raatri rem-sampann neend se prakriyaatmak smriti ko laabh miltaa he, jabaki aarambhik-raatri sws-sampann neend se ghoshnaatmak smriti ko laabh hota he
 a study conducted by Dutta has indirectly supported these results
 22 nar chuhon ko adhyayan kaa paatr banaaya gaya tha
 a box was constructed in which a rat could move freely from one end to the other
 dibbe kii tali ispaat kii jaali se banaayi gayi thi
 a light flashes in the compartment with a sound
 Five seconds later, an electric shock is applied
 As soon as the blow started, the rat would go to the other end of the box, then the blow would have ended immediately
 Rats could also go to the other end of the box using a five-second delay and thus avoid shocks altogether
 jatke kii avadhi kabhi bhi paanch second se adhik nahin rahi
 This was repeated 30 times on half the mice
 anya aadhe, niyantran samooh, ko usee pareekshan main rakhaa gaya, lekin unki pratikriya par dhyaan die bina chuhon ko jhatka diya gaya
 After each training session, the mice were kept in a recording cage for six hours for polygraphic recording
 This process was repeated for three consecutive days
 is adhyayan main paaya gaya pareekshan ke baad neend ki neend recording satr ke dauraan, chuhon ne niyantran pareekshanon ke baad kii tulana main, abhyaas pareekshanon ke baad REM neend main 25
47% adhik samay bitaayaa
 ye pareekshan born at al
 adhyayan ke parinaamon kaa samarthan karte hai, inase REM neend or prakriyaatmak gyaan ke bich sahasambandh kaa ek spasht sanket miltaa he
 An observation from the Dutta study is that the sleep exercise group spent 180% more time in the SWS than the control group during the recording session after the test
 This fact was supported by a study by Kudrimoti, Burns and mcnaughton
 is adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki sthanik khoj gatividhi ke baad, prayog main hippocample kii koshikaon kaa pattern SWS ke dauraan punahsakriy hota he
 Kudrimoti et al
 In one study, seven mice were run in a linear track using the reward at one end
 chuhon ko trek main anukool hone ke liye 30 minute tak rahane diya gaya, phir unhen inaam-aadhaarit prashikshan ke liye trek main 30 minute tak daudaya gaya or phir unhen 30 minute tak aaraam karne diya gaya
 During each of these three periods, EEG data were collected to inform the rats' sleep stages
 kudrimoti at al
 ne SWS ke purv-vyavhaar ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rates ko or saat chuhon ke ausatan 22 trek -daud dwaara SWS ke uttar-vyavhaar main teen baar rakhe das minute ke avkaash ko pariklit kiya
 The results showed that the ten minutes after the test race session showed a 12% increase in mean firing rate of hippocampal cells compared to prior levels; However, after 20 minutes, the mean firing rate rapidly returned to the previous level
 sthanik anveshan ke baad SWS ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii firing main vruddhi se samajha ja saktaa he ki aakhir kyon datta ke adhyayan main SWS neend kaa str bad gaya tha, kyonki yah bhi sthanik anveshan ke ek rup se sambhddha tha
 In order to increase the magnitude of slow oscillations during SWS, a study was conducted involving direct current stimulation in the puerperal cortex
 ekadish dhara uttejan ne agle din shabd-jodi samaran main bahut vruddhi kar di, isse yah pramaan mila ki praasangik smritiyon ke samekan main SWS ek badi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Various studies suggest that there is a correlation between complex functions of sleep and memory
 harvard ke neend shodhakarta sapar or stickgold kaa kahana he ki smriti or abhyaas kaa ek aavashyak hissaa tantrika koshika drumashm se yukt hota he, jo nae neuronal samparkon main sangathit hone ke liye koshika pind ko soochna bhejtaa he
 This process demands that no external information be presented to these drachms and it is also said that this is probably why memories and knowledge are solid and organized during sleep
 "parirakshan or sangrakshan" ke siddhant kaa maananaa he ki neend anukoolneey kaary karti he
 In those parts of the 24 hours of the day when the creature is protected, when it is awake and therefore moving around and when the person is at great risk
 jeev ko bhojan karne ke liye 24 ghante kii jarurat nahin hoti or vah anya jaruraton ko puraa karata he
 With this approach of adaptation, organisms stay out of harm's way, where they can fall prey to other potentially strong organisms
 ve usee samay neend lete hai jo unki suraksha ko adhiktam banaata he, unhen shaareerik kshamta or unka awaas pradaan karata he
 
 haalanki, yah siddhant isaki vyakhya karne main vifal rahaa kii aakhir kyon saamaanya neend ke dauraan bahari vaataavaran se mastishk kaa sambandh tut jaataa he
 Another argument against this theory is that sleep is not merely a passive consequence of separating animals from the environment, but rather a "drive"; the animal is late in its behavior in order to sleep
 isliye, gatividhi or niskriyata kii avadhi kii vyakhya ke liye sirkadian viniman paryaapt se adhik he, jo jeev ke liye anukoolneey he, lekin neend kii or bhi adhik ajeeb vishistataaen sambhawatah anya tathaa agyaat kaaryon ko puraa karti hai
 In addition, preservation theory needs to explain why carnivores such as lions, who are at the top of the food chain and who do not have much fear, tend to sleep too much
 yah kaha gaya he ki ve jab shikaar par nahin hote tab unhen urja ksharan ko kam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Preservation theory also does not explain why aquatic mammals sleep while walking
 in samvedansheel ghanton ke dauraan niskriyata vahi karti he or adhik laabhprad ban jaati he, kyonki praani tab bhi shikariyon aadi kii tarah kii paryaavaran chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main sakasham hota he
 Sleep faults again after faulty adaptation to the sleepless night, but apparently for some reason
 apane sone ke samay kisi singh se apni jaan bachaane main laga hua ek zebra din ke samay neend se nidhaal hokar so jaataa he, jo shikaar banane se kam nahin, kahin adhik asurakshit he
 Dreaming is the feeling of sensory images and sounds during sleep, the dreamers in sequence feel more like a manifest partner than an observer
 sapane dekhnaa pons dwaara utprerit hota he or neend ke REM charan ke dauraan adhikanshtah sapane aayaa karte hai
 People have introduced many concepts about dream work
 sigmund frid ne nirvivaad rup se maan liya ki sapane un apurna ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti hai jo achetan man main daal yaa phenk di jaati hai or unhone in ichchhaaon kii khoj ke liye manovishleshan ke rup main sapanom kii vyakhya kaa upyog kiya
 See Freud: The Interpretation of Dreams frid kaa kaam sapanom kii manovaigyanik bhoomika se sambandhit he, jo spasht rup se kisi bhi shaareerik bhoomika ke ho sakane ko chhod nahin detaa
 isliye haal ke smriti or anubhav ke vyavasthaapan or samekan main badhati aadhunik dilchaspee dwaara isse inkaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Recent research claims that the overall role of consolidation and administration of Chetopagam contacts during exercise and experience is that of sleep
 jon alan hobsan or robert mccarle kaa sakriyan sanshleshan siddhantakahata he ki REM avadhi main dimagi valkal main hone vaali neuron kii andhadhundh firing se sapane aayaa karte hai
 According to this theory, the forebrain then weaves a story in an attempt to reconcile and draw meaning by presenting nonsensical sensory information; That's why many dreams are of strange nature
 prabhavi khuraaq kuch had tak purv main upyog par nirbhar karata he
 As its effects begin to wane, it may cause a rapid alertness
 kharaab neend ke kai kaaran hai
 The following principles of healthy sleep can solve physical or emotional problems

 Also the difficulty of falling asleep or the urge to stop falling asleep can even activate a "second priority" for a moment, which can then become a bit painful after going temporarily
 shodh se pataa chalata he ki nidra kaa pattern vibhinn samskritiyon main alag-alag tarah kaa he
 The biggest difference in societies is that there are sources of artificial illumination on a large scale and nowhere else
 praathmik antar jo najar aata he vah yah he ki puraani sanskatiyon main nidra kaa pattern kahin adhik bhangur rahaa he
 For example, people may fall asleep soon after the sun sets, then wake up frequently throughout the night, sleep awake, and last for hours, lives

 In general, people are in very deep sleep long after going to sleep at night, although this is not always true
 kuch samaajon main, aam taur par log kam se kam ek anya vyakti ke saath yaa phir jaanwaron ke saath sote hai
 In some other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except the most intimate family, such as a spouse
