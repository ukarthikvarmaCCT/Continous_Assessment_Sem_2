 film preetam or gita ke pehle suhagaraat main jate hue khatam hoti he| Govardhanacharya was a devout poet who was a contemporary of Jayadeva
 ve bengali kavi the
 a collection of Muktak poems called Aryasaptashati is considered to be the work of Govardhan
 jayadev ke gitgovind main govardhanacharya ko rassiddh kavi kaha gaya he
 Jayadeva has become a well-known devout poet of Bengal during the time of Ballansen's son Lakshmanasena

 Govardhanacharya's name is also counted among those five gems

 Haal has composed adornments in Prakrit saga
 govardhan ne inhi gaathaon ko apni aryaaon kaa adarsh banaaya
 Prakrit's saga is closer to the Sanskrit Aryanchands, so Govardhan chose Aryachanda to create
 keval chand main hi nahin apitu bhavchitran main bhi govardhan haal kaa bahudhaa anukaran karte hai
 But it should not be understood from this that Aryasaptashati is just a Sanskrit translation of Gathasaptashati
 jab bhi govardhan kisi gaatha ke bhav ko vyakt karnaa chaahate hai, ve usamen apni moulik pratibha ke pradarshan se nahin chookte
 Therefore, despite being grossly affected by Aryasapsati Gathasaptashati, it is quite malic in itself

 The earliest definite reference to cricket is found in 1598 and it is clear that cricket was played in the 1550 century, but its true origin remains a mystery

 The widely accepted theory about the birth of cricket is that it was developed in the early medieval period by the community of agriculture and metalworking of Weld, which lies between Kent and Sussex
 ye county or padosi saare utkrushtataa ke praarambhik centre hua karte the or yaheen se yah khel jald hi landan, jahaan isaki sthaayee lokapriyata sunishchit thi or barkshaayar, asex, hampshire or middlesex jaise dakshin ke county main pahunchaa
 There were many common usage of words at that time, which are considered possible sources for the name "cricket"
 1598 main sabase aarambhik kaal ke gyaat sandarbh main yah crecket kehalaata tha
 Quoting the strong medieval trade relationship between southeast England and the province of Flanders, which was then under the Dutch of Burgundy, the name can be said to have been derived from the Crick, ie stick of Middle Dutch; Or is derived from Old English's crick or cryke meaning Baisakhi or sticks
 samuel johnson ke angrezi bhashaa ke shabdkosh main unhone cricket kii vyutpatti "krike, saxon, ek chadi" se bataaya he
 In the Old French language, criquette seems to have meant a variety of mughadar or stick, though it may be the origin of croquet

 ho saktaa he, is khel kaa avishkaar 1300 se pehle kisi samay norman yaa plantajenet ke samay main hua ho; yaa phir 1066 se pehle saxon kaal main
 Cricket is essentially a type of game similar to stoolball, rounders and baseball, but from which it evolved or other sports evolved in the opposite order, it cannot be decided
 is nirdisht kshetra ke bare main oxfordshire main stoolball par 1523 sandarbh hai; ho saktaa he yah kisi aise khel kaa jatigat shabd ho, jisamen gend ko kisi bhi tarah se balle yaa chadi se maaraa jaataa ho

 There is no evidence to support this thought and maybe Craig is completely different

 The earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere is from a court case of 1598, which confirms that around 1550 it was played at a ground in Guilford, Surrey
 yah mukadmaa ek vidhyalay ke bhukhand ke swaamitv par uthe ek vivaad se sambandhit rahaa he
 The Guilford-based court heard the statement of John Derrick, a 59-year-old death reviewer, on Monday 17 January 1597, who stated in his testimony that fifty years earlier he used to play "crackett" with his friends at the venue
 vah skool gilford royal grammer skool tha
 In 1598, cricket was mentioned in Giovanni Florio's italian-english Dictionary
 sgilair shabd kii unki paribhaasha thi: "tu mek a nvoyse age a cricket, tu play cricket-a-wicket, and bi meri" 
 Florio is the first author known to define "cricket" in terms of an insect and a game
 1611 main apane shabdkosh ke baad ke sanskaran main, florio ne nishkarsh diya ki "jab ham cricket a wicket, yaa gigeogi kehete hai" to "tu play cricket-a-wicket" kaa fritfrit ke sandarbh main yon saahchary se sambandh hota he or dibaticare ko is tarah paribhaashit kiya "bistar tak gigeogi kii aawaaj ke saath kaamuktha se kisi maadaa kaa jhankaaran"
 In 1611, a french-english dictionary published by Randall Cottgrave defined the noun cross as "the Crooked Staff Wherewitched Boys Play at Cricket"
 is shabd kaa kriya rup crosar he, jise "tu play at cricket" paribhaashit kiya gaya
 Although cricket is defined in Cottgrave's dictionary as a children's game, as noted above about Guildford's schoolchildren, it was around this time that adult participation began
 1611 main bhi sasex main cricket kaa pehla nishchit ullekh miltaa he or padri kii adaalat ke record main darj he ki pashchim sasex ke sidlesham ke do palliwasi easter ravivaar ko carch nahin aa paae kyonki ve cricket khel rahe the
 He was fined 12 pence and had to atone
 1613 main, ek anya adalati maamle main darj he ki gildford ke nikat vanbro main kisi par "cricket danda" se hamalaa kiya gaya
 Also in this period, the first definitive mention of cricket was discovered in Kent from a court case in 1640, which recorded that "for nearly thirty years" had "cricketing" in Chevening in "weld and Upland" versus "chalkhill"
 Used to be
 yah sabase aarambhik gyaat gramin cricket match he or ye pratiyogitaayen 17veen sadi ke purvarddh main lokapriy ban gayin
 The suit concerned the land on which the game was played
 1617 main, 18 varshiya oliver cromwel landan main cricket or footbal khelaa karata tha
 On 16 May, on Sunday 5 May, the Pallivasis of Boxgrove, near Chichester, West Sussex, were prosecuted for playing cricket in the church's cemetery
 mukadmaa chalaane ke teen kaaran the: pehla to yah ki isse ek sthaneey up-niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha; doosraa yah ki isse girjaghar kii khidkiyaan tut bhi sakati thim; or teesraa kaaran tha cricket ke balle kii chot se kisi chote bachche kaa bheja baahar aa ja saktaa he! 
 The final reason was that since the batsman was then allowed to hit the ball twice and fielding near the batsman was very dangerous, two subsequent incidents strictly confirmed this
 1624 main, purvi sasex sthit horstad kence main tab ek kshetrarakshak jasper vinal kii maut ho gayi jab ballebaaj edward taai ne kaich out hone se bachane ke prayaas main gend ko dubaara hit kiya
 Thus Mr
 Vinal is the earliest recorded record of death while playing cricket
 yah maamla mrityu sameekshak kii adaalat main darj hua, jahaan faisle main ise ek durbhagyapurna durghatana mana gaya
 This tragic incident occurred again in 1647 when a player named Henry Brand was killed when a batsman hit the ball again in Selsey, West Sussex
 1744 main jab pehla cricket kaa kanoon banaaya gaya, tab gend ko do baar maarna gaiyr-kanoonee ho gaya or is niyam ko todane par ballebaaj ko out kar dene kaa praavdhaan bana
 The record of the trial of 1624 confirms that two villages named Horsted Kans and West Hoathli were involved in the match and there is more evidence of the development of rural cricket
 lagbhag 1630 se paravartan tak, shuddhtavaadi prabhaav ke varshon main ravivaar ko khilne ke muddon ke anek ullekh padri kii adaalat ke record main milte hai
 These indicate signs of inter-parish matches being played, but no sign of the establishment of representative teams of the county prior to the 1660 reversion

 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 ek shaddashamalav triplate hota he ek chah ank, teen bite shaddashamalav sankhya, jo ki HTML main prayukt hoti he rangon ke pradarshan hetu
 The three bytes represent the red, green, blue components of a single color
 ek bite hoti he 00 se FF tak, yaa 0 se 255 
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red = 36, green = 104, blue = 160
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit 
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows: These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F,BC,8B 
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 saanchaa:color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue 
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
the lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: Shri MK Alagiri has been made a Minister in the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers in the Cabinet of Fifteenth Lok Sabha, Government of India

 lalaji 1907 main sufi amba prasad ke netritv main bani bharat mata sosayadi ke sakriy sadsy ho gayi
 In December 1912, when the Viceroy of British India, Lord Harding decided to leave Calcutta to form the capital in Delhi, at the same time, Ras Bihari Bose made plans to kill him in a hurry
 angrej lekhak smith ko san 1965 main diye gayi ek interviu main lalaji ne swayan batalaaya tha - "vysarai kii sawari nikaalane ke liye dilli main shandaar intjaam kiye gayi the
 Chairs were placed on both sides of the main road of Chandni Chowk, whose tickets were available in the black market for Rs 50 to Rs 300
 unki seat asplaned road tirahe ke paas thi
 As the procession approached the pearl market, there was a loud explosion
 ham log samajhe shaayad koi top daagi gayi hogi
 As soon as we reached the occasion, we came to know what exactly happened
 The Viceroy had bled badly, and the servants sitting behind him had blown away
 dar ke maare uski bibi vehosh ho gayi thi
 Both of them were taken to the Red Fort but the procession continued to Vadastur
 " Lalaji left Delhi to escape the arrest of the police and hid in the house of one of his friends Sundar Lal in Solan, located below the hills of Shimla
 pataa tab chalaa jab police kisi or maamle main sundar laal ko khojane unke ghar pahaunchi
 In the Delhi bombings, Lala Hanumantha Sahai, Master Amir Chand, Master Awadh Bihari, Bhai Balamukund and Basant Kumar Vishwas were arrested and prosecuted for plotting the Viceroy's murder

 Lalaji appealed against this decision which resulted in his life imprisonment being commuted to rigorous imprisonment of seven years

 Astu, whatever, "who threw the bomb on the Viceroy?" - Lala ji kept this secret secret till death, and kept his promise that this secret would be buried with him
 jab hindustan ko 1947 main vibhajit hokar aazaadee mili lalaji ne haveli se baahar nikalnaa chhod diya

 Monalisa is the immortal artwork of the legendary Italian artist Leonardo de Vinci painted by Vinci between 1503 and 1507
 It took Leonardo four years to create this painting, although during this time he was baptized by St
 Paul and the Virgin and Child with St
 Also made two other works of art called Andre

 The classic artist Leonardo da Vinci, who created the artwork, was born in 1452 in a small town called Vinci, in the east of Florence, Italy
 inke pita sar piyaren da vinci ek notary the
 Seeing Leonardo's keen interest in art since childhood, the father sent him to Paris for higher education in art
 jo ki us samay kala shiksha kaa ek pramukh kendra tha, yahan rah kar ve ek berakia ke studiyon main kala kii shiksha lene lage
 While staying here, Leonardo gained extensive knowledge of painting from his guru and became aware of its specifics
 sheeghra hi guru ne mahasoos kiya ki unka shishy unase bhi kahin guni va pratibhavan he, atah guru ke paas jitna bhi gyaan tha, apane shishy vinci ko de diya
 In addition to painting, Leonardo also specialized in engineering, study of human anatomy
 rhite bandhuon ke janm se saikadon varsh pehle jab hawaii jahaaj kii kalpana bhi mushkil thi tab liyanardo ne hawa main udne vaali mashin kaa model banaaya tha
 With the passion to understand the complex structure of the human body, Leonardo would dig into the cemetery from the cemetery in the darkness of night and bring it to the studs
 maanav sharir ke aantarik angon ko katate va unki draning banaakar vistrut nots likhte
 These historical sketches and comments are still preserved today, so Leonardo has made hundreds of paintings and drawings in his life, some of which are names of famous works of art, the more fame the masterpiece Monalisa got on Da Last Supper, Madonna Inn, etc
 Hai, he is really amazing

 newland kaa vishwaas he ki monaalisa ne apane pet main pal rahe bachche kii smriti va anusansha se apana chitra banwaaya tha
 His statement is that because of the thrill of new life coming into the world and the happiness that pulverizes motherhood, it is this unique and wonderful smile on his face

 According to Pallanati, the houses of Leonardo's father Sir Pierre and Francisco were not far apart, but the two families had close relations
 us samay lija kii aayu 24 varsh thi
 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Ishakella's drunken husband would often beat and beat her after getting drunk
 apni prakashit pustak ‘hu ij monaalisa ’ insearch main anekon samantaanen ginvaayi hai
 The book further states that Leonardo, who was a royal artist in the court of Duque, was very close to Isabella
 kareeb 8 varsh purv japan main daanton ke ek doctor ne yah kah kar sabko hairat main daal diya tha ki monaalisa kii rahasyamayi muskaan kaa raaj uske upree jabade main aage ke do daanton kaa tutaa hona he or isi kaaran uske upree hoth ek taraf kuch dabaa hua-sa dikhaai de rahaa he, isi kaaran uskaa ek upree hoth ek taraf se kuch dabaa hua sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed
 yah doctor pichley kai varshon se monaalisa par shodh kar rahe the
 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 It is a vehicle designed to provide more traction force at lower speeds
 yah apane peeche judy hui krishi upkaran, saamaan ladi treller, trali aadi khinchne kaa kaary bhi karata he
 On top of that some agricultural implements are also installed which are driven by the power derived from the tractor
 karshitr vah swayanchalit yantra he
 Its behavior is mainly saadhaarant: karshan kaary ye hai: jameen ko jotikar taiyaar karnaa, beej daalana, paudh lagaana, fasal lagaana, fasal kaatna, aadi
 The stationary tasks are: pumping water, threshing, feed dispatching, sawing, etc
 vibhinn prakar ke kaaryon ke liye paanch prakaar mukhya mul chaalak nimnlikhit hai: 1
 gharelu jaanavar, 2
 vayuchalit yantra, 3
 jalchaalit yantra, 4
 vidyucchalit yantra, 5
 ushmaainjan Of these original drivers, only domestic animals and incubation are successfully treated for traction
 vaayu, jal evam bijli dwaara praapt shakti kaa upyog sirf sthir kaaryon ke liy hi ho sakate he
 Horses and mules were used for agriculture related work till 1920 AD in countries like United Kingdom, USA; But after that the behavior of animals decreased
 aajkal vahaan in kaaryon ke liye praaia: tractor kaa hi vyavhaar kiya jaataa hai
 The main advantages of tractors over domestic animals are: 1
 isse kathin kaary lagaataar liya ja saktaa he, 2
 It does not affect the adverse climate, 3
 yah vibhinn gatiyon se kaary kar saktaa he, 4
 When it does not behave, it requires less attention and there is no need for fuel at all
 sabase pehle shakti-chaalit krishi upkaran unnisvin shatabdi ke armbh main aaye
 There was a steam engine mounted on wheels
 ek belt kii sahaayta se yah sambandhit krishi upkaran ko chalaata tha
 As a result of technological improvements and development in these machines, the first tractor emerged around 1850
 iske baad inkaa krishi kaaryon main jamkar prayog hua
 Vapor-powered engines in tractors continued for many years even into the twentieth century
 jab aantarik jvalan ingine paryaapt rup se vishwasaneey banane lage tab is nayi praudyogiki par aadhaarit tractaron ne puraani praudyogiki kaa sthaan le liya
 In 1892, Jan Frolic built the first petrol powered tractor
 iske keval do hi tractor bike
 Subsequently in 1911, Twin City Tractor Engine Company developed a design which was successful
 bhaap ingine kaa avishkaar evam vikaas antardahan ingine se ek sau varsh pehle hua tha
 At that time, the tractor was used only to drive the threshing machine
 bhaap tractor main kuch vikaas hone ke baad iskaa vyavhaar khet ko taiyaar karne, beej bone or fasal kaatane ke liye kiya jane laga
 The steam tractor did not prove useful for agriculture, as it was extremely heavy and slow moving
 iske atirikt iske liy prachur maatra main eendhan evam vaashpitra jal kii avashyaktaa hoti thi jisaki dekhbhaal ke liye duusare aadmi kii aavashyata padati thi
 These errors of steam-tractors attracted the attention of inventors to the combustion engine
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main pratham gas tractor kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 By 1905, the practice of gas tractors started in the fields
 isamen chaar pahiyon par sthit baari panjar par ek bada silinder gas ikin laga hua tha
 Like the steam tractor, it was also very heavy
 isamen eendhan, jal aadi kam maatra main lagata tha or ek hi aadmi puure yantra ko niyantrit or sanchalit kar saktaa tha
 1910 A
D
 Approximately the focus of the designs went towards the construction of light gas tractors
 1913 i
 se do evam chaar silinderonvaale ingine ke halke gas tractaron kaa nirmaan kiya jane laga
 After that different types of gas tractors started being manufactured, then different types of gas tractors were made
 pratham dijal ingine yukt tractor kaa nirmaan 1931 i
 main kiya gaya
 Although the price of such tractor was high
 phir bhi anek gunon ke kaaran isaki maang adhik thi
 The low pressure pneumatic tire in the tractor was first treated in 1932 AD
 aajkal bhi tractor ke vikaas ke liye anveshan kaary ho rahe hai
 According to the methods of traction and self-operation, there are two differences of tractors: 1
 chakra tactor - yah tractor bade mahatv kaa or krishi sambandhi kaaryon ke liye atyant upyogi he
 The wheel tractor is either three wheeled or four wheeled
 2
 li prakaar ke tractor aise tractor ke karshan yantra vinyas main do baari patariyaan lagi rahati hai
 It behaves with two iron wheels, one of which acts as a driver and the other is like a diluent
 yah tractor baari kaary, jaise band ke nirmaan or anya audyogic kaaryon ke liye bade paimaane par vyavahrut hota he
 Its behavior in agriculture is less
 upyogita ke anusaar karshitr ke nimnlikhit paanch bhed hai: 1
 Common Functions - These turbines are of standard design, such as four-cycle or leak-type turbine
 2
 sarvakaarya karshitr - aise karshitr se praaia: sabhi tarah ke karshitr kaary liye ja sakate hai
 3
 Phalodyan karshitra - These are small or medium sized instruments
 inaki banaavat aisi hoti he ki inase falodyan main sucharu rup se kaary liya ja sakat he
 These types of karishritas are very low in height and have very few projective parts
 4
 audyagik karshitr - in prakaar ke yantra kisi bhi aakaar yaa prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 They are practiced in factories and airports etc
 ye rabar ke pahie tathaa ucch chaal pareshan upkarnon se yukt hote hai
 5
 Bagh-karshitra - This is the smallest size tractor used in gardens or small farms
 yah teen aakaar kaa banaaya jaataa he: chota aakaar, madhyam aakaar or bada aakaar
 Planting and cultivation work is done in gardens with small size machine
 madhyam or bade akaarawale baag karshitr kaa vyavhaar hal chalaane aadi ke kaary ke liye liya jaataa he
 The driver drives this device and controls it with the help of a lever
 sabhi tractaron main nimnlikhit teen bhaag hote hai: 1
 Engine and its means, 2
 shakti pareshan pranali , 3
 Chassis pracheen samay ke tractaron main mandagami vishaal kshaitij ingine lagaae jate the jinamein keval ek yaa do silinder hote the
 To handle such heavy engines, strong wheels, big wheels etc
 were required, due to which the tractor itself became very heavy and it was difficult to take work
 aajkal ucch gativale halke injanon kaa prayog adhik ho rahaa he jinamein mukhyat: do silinder kshaitij ingine or chaar yaa chha: silinder vaale urdhwadhar ingine haate hai
 The main parts of a tractor engine, such as pistons, crack shaft bearings, valves, etc
 are larger and heavier than the parts of a motor vehicle engine
 sabhi silinder ek hi dhalaai main banaae jate hai
 Tractor engine cylinders start to collapse soon
 is kathinaayee ko sulajhane ke liye ye do vidhiyaan kaam main laai jaati hai
 These methods are expensive and time consuming
 isiliye aadhunik abhikalp ke ingine main apney silinder deevaaren yaa sleeve lagaae jate hai, jo ingine ko tractor se bina baahar nikaale sugamawa se pun: pratisthapit kiye ja sakate hai
 The price of the sleeve is much lower than the price of a new cylinder or good refinishing
 tractor ingine ke liye silinder sheersh alag se dhalaai dwaara banaae jate hai
 By doing this, it is easier to carry the frozen carbon in the combustion chamber
 balve ko silinder sheersh main lagaaya jaataa he jisase valve ke samanjan main aasaani hoti he
 The tractor piston is usually made of casting iron and there are three to seven rings attached to it
 sabhi tractaron ke crank shaft paat gadhaai dwaara ek hi tukade main banaae jate hai
 Generally, two and four cylinders of larger size 900 to 1,200 and four and six cylinders of smaller size run at 1500 to 2000 revolutions per minute
 antardahan ingine main vyavahrut eendhan gasiy eendhan yaa or dwitiya, sphuling prajvalan inrjan 
 In the first type of engine, only the air enters the cylinder in the suction stroke and there it is compressed in the compression stroke
 is stroke ke purna hone ke lagbhag ant:kshepak dwaara eendhan sookshmakanon ke rup main garm sampidit vaayu main ant:kshepit kiya jaataa he jisase dahan hota he
 Diesel oil is treated in such engines
 dwitiya prakaar ke sphuling prajvalan ingine main eendhan or vaayu kaa sanmishran corburator naamak bhaag main hota he or vahaan se chushan stroke dwaara yah mishran silinder main pravesh karata he
 Combustion is carried out by the sphincter plug as the mixture is compressed by a compression stroke in the cylinder
 is tarah ke eendhan main petrol or gas kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 After combustion both the above types of engines have diffusion stroke in which power is obtained
 prasar ke ant main jali hui gas nimna daab par rah jaati he jise nikaas stroke dwaara baahar nikaalkar chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 Heat is generated by friction due to hot gases in the engine and backward movement in the piston cylinders, causing the engine parts to deteriorate quickly
 isse bachane ke liye ingine ke purjon ko vayushithan yaa taralashithan dwaara thanda kar ushma kam kii jaati he
 It is necessary to have a locomotive on the tractor engine to bring uniformity in the changing speed with the changing load falling on the tractor
 praaia: sabhi tractor gatiniyantran kii avaruddh pranali se yukt hote hai
 In this, the speed is controlled with the help of centrifugal force carried by the rotating load
 tractor ke ingine kii shakti ko iske pahiyon yaa leekon main pareshit karanevaale yantravinyas ke teen bhaag hai: In various tractors, these parts are made of different designs
 yah pranali swayampranodan kaa ek saadhan he
 With this help the speed of the crank shaft of the engine can be reduced or increased and the tractor speed is obtained at will
 is pranali dwaara gatidisha ko bhi prativertit kiya jaataa he
 The power unit of self-propelled vessels needs a means of separation from its transmission gear and conduction wheel because vibhinn gatiyon ko praapt karne ke liye pareshan gear ko hataanaa padataa he
 For all these actions, a graze is used between the engine and transmission gear and the platen pulley
 in grabhon main sankuchan grabh, shanku grabh or vistaaran grabh pramukh hai
 Nowadays, almost all tractors have gravitational types
 aadhunik grabh abhikalp main bahuchakati prakaar ke grabh ke badale dwichakti or ekapatt grabh kaa vyavhaar adhik hota he
 In the latest design, the kinetic energy or pressure energy of a fluid is used for power transmission
 isamen taral yugman or balghurna parivartak aadi pramukh hai
 Under the tractor chassis, the structure, wheels or other means of traction and folding mechanisms come, the other units of the device are attached to the structure, so it is necessary to be strong
 pehle yah sandhan rivat jod dwaara banaaya jaataa tha kintu aajkal tractor ko halkaa, chota evam sanhat banane ke liye yah do bhaagon main dhalaai dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he jisamen se ek ingine crank khol evam doosraa pareshan koshth kaa kaary karata he
 Nowadays, the wheels of almost all tractors are made of low pressure biological rubber, but nowadays steel wheels are also used in tractors used for paddy cultivation etc
 modan yantravinyas kaa sabase pramukh bhaag gear he jo modan chakra se modan dand ko gati pareshit karata he
 These gears are always locked in a vault so that no dust etc
 can enter them
 kisi bhi tractor kii aayu or iske dwaara kiya gaya kaary is yantra kii dekharekh par nirbhar karata he
 The more carefully this device is placed, the better it will work and accordingly it will be durable
 yadi acchhee dekharekh kii jaay to yah shaayad hi kabhi kathinaayee upasthit karegaa
 Almost all tractors have difficulties with engines
 kathinaaiyon ke kaaran mukhyat: nimnlikhit chaar prakaar ke ho sakate hai: The lack of proper compression to start any engine smoothly and efficiently, is the wear of pistons, piston ring cylinders, cylinders, walls, etc
, lime around the cylinder top or sphincter plug, and carbon deposits under the valve
 
 valve ke kuch band ho jane, eendhanpath main koi bahari bastu aa jane, corburator plav ke kahin atak jane ke kaaran eendhan ke pravaah main avrodh hota he jisase kam eendhan hi aa paata he
 Sometimes, due to accumulation of sewage under the valve or holes in the plow, fuel starts coming in high
 corburator kaa uchit rup se na baitaane par eendhan mishran durbal yaa aavashyaktaa se adhik shaktishaalee ho jaataa he
 The presence of a good electrical sphincter in the combustion chamber at the right time depends on many delicate parts
 dhaatu kaa ek kan, jal kii ek boond yaa bijli kaa koi dhilaa sangyojan puri prajvalan pranali main baadha daal sakat he
 This would mean delay and loss of time
 crank karte samay ingine kaa prarambhn na hona yaa chalate chalate hathaat ruk janaa prajvalan kii kathinaayee kaa suchak he
 The valve should open or close at the appropriate time and the piston should be formed at the appropriate time with the speed of the piston
 ie samay main jaraa sa bhi parivartan hone se 'avadhi sambandhi kathinaayee' hoti he
 This does not impede the running of the engine or running smoothly, but it reduces the power of the engine, overheats the engine and increases the fuel consumption
 in sari kathinaaiyon ke kaarnon kii ore sadaa dhyaan dete rahane se tractor hameshaa acchhee avasthaa main rahata he
 It is a major port
 devdas bangla ke prasiddh upanyaaskaar sharathchandra chattopadhyaay kaa prasiddh upanyaas he
 Coordinates: 25 ° 36′40 ′′ n 85 ° 08′38 ′′ e / 25
611 ° n 85
144 ° e / 25
611; 85
144 canhauli bihata, patna, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 View of Cordillera Central from Pasil Valley cordilyera central dakshinpurvi asia ke philipinoz desh kii sabase unchi parvatamala he
 It stands in the north-central part of the island of Luzon and extends over all the provinces of the Kordilyera administrative region and some other administrative areas
 uttar main yah luzone ke uttari tat par samaapt hoti he or dakshinpurv main yah karabalo pahadiyon se judi hui he jo swayan aage chalakar siyerra maadre pahadiyon main mil jaati hai
 Kordilyera Central also has three active volcanoes
 paksh athwa pakhwada saamaanya vyavhaar main 15 dinon ke antaraal ko kaha jaataa he
 For convenience, half a month or two weeks time is also called as
 haalaanki jyotish shaastra, bhartiya panchang yaa kaal gananaa kii hindu paddati ke anusaar takneekee rup se paksh kii paribhaasha he - chandramaa dwaara kalachakra main ek se duusari sthiti tak jane ke liya jane vaala samay
 Accordingly, two types of Paksha are defined - Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha
 krishna athwa shuklapaksh main praaia: 15 din hote hai'
 But in case of any date-loss in any party, it becomes 14 days or if there is a date-increase, it becomes 16 days
 paksh main tithi kii haani yaa vruddhi na hone kii sthiti main 15 din hi hote hai
 Sometimes, due to the obvious mathematical process of Chandra and Surya, the date of decay in one side twice, the 13-day side also falls
 vartmaan vikram sanwat 2064 ke shravan maas ke krishnapaksh main do tithiyon kaa kshay ho jane ke kaaran yah paksh maatr 13 din kaa tha
 At the time of the war of Mahabharata, there was also a thirteen day favor
 sanatandharm ke granthon tathaa jyotishshastra main 13 divasiy paksh ko 'vishwaghastra paksh' kaa naam dekar ise vishwa-shanti ko bhang karne vaala mana gaya he
 It is believed that this side effect gives its effect within thirteen sides and thirteen months
 isko dharm evam jyotish ke granthon main 'vishwaghastra paksh' kaha gaya he
 In the scriptures, the name 'kalayoga' has also been given to the Vishwaghastra Paksha- nokia 5700 express mujeec, nokia dwaara banaaya gaya ek mobile phone upkaran he
 It was made available in the market in 2007
 yah uamties takanic par kaary karata he
 It is a product of the Nokia 5000 Active series with candibar texture, capable of showing 16 xxrep 5 0 colors - 240X320 pixels screen
 isamen 2
0 megapixl kaa camera rangeen photo khechney va sangrahan ke liye laga he
 Nokia 5700 is one of the few Symbian OS based phones with Hindi support available

 kawalam madhav panikkar bharat ke vidwaan, patrkaar, itihaaskaar, prashaasak tathaa rajanyajna the
 He is more famous by the name of Sardar KM Panikkar
 bharat ke aadhunik rajanyagnon main sardaar ke0em0 panikkar ke naam kaa ullekh avashya kiya jaataa he
 Panikkar was India's ambassador to China for a long time
 unka maananaa tha ki rajnay kaa janm europe main aadhunik rajyon ke janm se sambandhit he
 Defining diplomacy, Panikkar said, "diplomacy used in international politics is an art of keeping our interests ahead of other countries
 “ rajnay ek kala he jise apanaakar vishwa ke rajya apane parsparik sambandhon ko badhaate hue apane hit sadhana karte hai
 According to Panikkar, diplomacy is "the eyes and ears of one country located in another country
" “ koi bhi desh apane rajanyagnon ke madhyam se duusare desh kii ghatnaon, nitiyon or drushtikon ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar apni videsh niti ko aavashyak mode detaa rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered tact, skill, treachery etc
 as diplomatic virtues, whereas according to Panikkar, full diplomacy is motivated by a view to achieve good wishes of other countries towards their country, and the path of deceit etc
 Is a dangerous instrument
 duusare desh kii shubhakamanaa, prapti ke lakshya kii purti chaar prakaar se adhik acchhee tarah ho sakati he-duusare desh us desh kii nitiyon ko thik prakaar se samajhen or uske prati sammaan kii bhaavana rakhen, vah desh duusare deshon kii janata ke nyyochit hiton ko samajhe evam sarvopari maane tathaa vah eemaandaaree se vyavhaar kare
 You cannot deceive many people forever
 jab desh kii niti kii asaliyat jaahir ho jaayegi to vishwa-samaaj main us desh ke str ko dhakka pahonchega
 Panikkar believes that honesty is the best policy in international life as in personal life
 panikkar ne rajya ke prati swamibhakti ko ek rajanyajna kaa aavashyak gun mana he
 In his words, "the ambassador has to implement the policy that determines his government
" ye uske swayan ke paramarshon se bhinn ho sakati he kyonki kisi desh kii sarkaar hi puri sthiti se parichit hoti he jabaki rajdoot keval apane vishisht lakshyon ko hi jaanata he
 Therefore, when he has to execute instructions which are fundamentally against his views, he should not be influenced by emotion, partiality or friendship and in any case he should not reveal it even by flicking his eyes to the concerned government
 It is necessary that his own views are not different
 adarsh rajdoot ko kisi bhi paristhiti main apane desh se aae kade nirdeshon ko mridu banaakar apni sarkaar ke vyavhaar kaa galat anumaan nahin dena chaiye bhale hi uske desh kii videsh niti sweekaari rajya ko pasand na ho
 Panikkar, who was himself a successful diplomat, considers women's connection and contact helpful to diplomacy
 san 1926 main francisi rajdoot jules camban ne, ek lekh main likhaa tha ki sammanneey striyon kaa sansarg rajdoot ke liye laabhadaayak hoga
 Renowned Indian scholar Chanakya was opposed to contact with women of ambassadors
 sabhi deshon main striyon kaa prayog rashtriya hit vruddhi ke liye ati prachinkaal se kiya jaataa he
 Such was the use of poison girls of ancient times in Indian history

 In the Second World War period, an American sign clerk showed several letters exchanged between Roosevelt and Churchill, falling in love with a Russian migrant girl
 vah ladki vastav main german jasoos thi
 This clerk was sentenced to seven years due to this crime
 panikkar ke anusaar ek adarsh rajdoot ko apni safalataa par garv or asafalataa par niraashaa nahin hona chaiye
 Panikkar has agreed to two basic functions of the ambassador - first, to keep his government informed about the local conditions and policies there
 doosraa apane desh kii videsh-niti ke kriyanvayan ke liye desh se ai aajnaaon kaa safaltaapurvak paalan karnaa
 The responsibility of the success or failure of any ambassador should be on the foreign policy of that country and not on the diplomat, because the ambassador does not form foreign policy, it is the job of his foreign department
 panikkar kaa vichaar he ki vaartaon ke peeche dabaav kaa sabase bhayanak va antim tarika yuddh kaa he
 War is resolved when the possibility of agreement ends, or if the hope of successful outcome of negotiations seems to be weak

 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
