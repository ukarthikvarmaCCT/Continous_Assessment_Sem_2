 CM Yogi Adityanath's image has suffered a deep setback with the bjp's defeat in the Uttar Pradesh by-election and the Unnao rape case
 gujarat or tripura main jeet kaa shrey paane vaale yogi adityanath ko karnataka chunaav prachaar ke aakhri daur main utaara ja rahaa he
 While earlier it was believed that he would be fielded from the beginning, but now the party has changed the strategy
 3 may ke baad se yogi karnataka main jhonkenge apni takat
 The defeat of Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections shook Yogi so much that Yogi, who had taken the credit of victory in Gujarat and Tripura, had lost the Karnataka election campaign
 karnataka chunaav apane puure ufaan par he
 Congress and BJP have fielded their veterans

 Yogi will campaign for 10 days in Karnataka
 3 may se lekar chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din 10 may tak 25 reliyaan sambodhit karenge
 Let me tell you that when the election got a severe defeat, the Unnao rape scandal came to the fore till Yogi recovered from this shock
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kathua rape cond or unnav rape cond ke deshbhar main charchit hone ke baad yogi sarkaar isse juujhati najar ai
 The BJP tried not to take Yogi's services in the Karnataka elections until a final decision is taken on the MLA on the Unnao case
 unnav ke aaropee vidhayak kuldeep senger ab jab jail bheje ja chuke hai sibiai puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he or yogi adityanath janata ke bich apni paith jamaane main jute hai
 In such a situation, the party is now preparing to send him to Karnataka again
 gorakhpur upachunaavake turant baad siddharamaiya ne apane twit ke jariye yogi adityanath par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Yogi replied to this after defeating the BSP candidate in the Rajya Sabha
 upi ke upachunaav ke pehle karnataka main star prachaarak kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale yogi sarkaar kii demand bhi kam ho gai saath hi party ne bhi unhen karnataka se dur rakhaa
 Yogi Adityanath replied from Lucknow but did not go to Karnataka, despite being given different religious status to this Beechlingayat
 mana ja rahaa he party ne jaanboojhkar yogi adityanath ko karnataka chunaav se dur rakhaa taaki yogi par hone vaale hamale kam ho or party uske jawaab dene se batch saken
 Now in the last days of campaigning, Yogi Adityanath will once again show his strength in Karnataka, but his campaigning may not be as popular as it was before the Gorakhpur defeat

 However, apart from the JNU Students' Union, the committee's decision was also rejected by the university's teacher association

 Its president Rajendra Singh believed that if water is delivered to the people, their livelihood can be made a difference
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhone jal sangrakshan par kaam kendrit kiya
 During these years, the Sangh has created rainwater harvesting structures to purify groundwater and restore the ecology of 1,200 barren villages in Rajasthan

 The villages themselves raise the cost of wages and materials by raising money

 If the water harvesting work of Rajendra Singh is adopted on a wider scale, then we can go a few steps towards correcting water scarcity

 kya pakistan ek or takhtapalat kii taraf bad rahaa he? kya pakistan main phir military raaj hoga? sarhad paar ye sugabugahat tab se tej he jab se pakistani vazeer-e-aazam ke daftar se army cheef general qamar bajva ke naam ek chitthee jari hui he
 This letter has reassigned Bajwa the command of the army for the next three years
 iske saath hi ab ye mana jane laga he ki dikhaane ko beshak imran khan pakistan ke vazeer-e-aazam hai
 But the real command of the country is in the hands of General Bajwa
 72 saal ke pakistan ke itihaas main jab jab mulk par sankat aayaa
 Then these army representatives crushed democracy and took command of the country
 field marshall ayub khan se lekar yahaya khan tak or jioul haq se lekar parvaiz musharraf tak kul 35 saal tak pakistani sena pramukh mulk par raaj kar chuke hai or ab ek baar phir pakistan usee raah par he
 Article 370 India ended from Kashmir
 magar musiibat pakistan par tuuti he
 Because the politics of Pakistan starts from Kashmir and ends at Kashmir
 us kashmir ko lekar bharat ke faisle ne pakistan ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Now this article 370 has become the bone of the throat for Pakistan, which is not being burnt or swallowed
 lihaaza ab ek baar phir mulk kii kaman pakistan ke army cheef ke haathon main jaati dikh rahi he
 Since Imran Khan became the Prime Minister, only General Qamar Bajwa has been seen consistently commanding Pakistan on every major occasion
 bhale wo chini raashtrapati shi jingping se milanaa ho yaa trump se mulaakaat kii baat ho
 Overall, the news that was coming so far was in the tongue
 wo imran khan ke is faisle ke baad zaahir ho gai hai
 In which he has extended the term of Army Chief of General Qamar Bajwa for three years
 yani ab is baat kii tasdik ho gai he ki desh kii asli kaman sena pramukh ke haathon main he
 It is not only being expressed like this
 pichley saal hue pakistan ke chunaav main imran khan kii jeet ke peeche sena ke haath kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 The opposing party so far alleges that General Qamar Javed Bajwa is the one who elevated Imran Khan to the Prime Minister's chair
 lihaaza ye bhi ilzaam he ki sena pramukh ke kaarykaal ko teen saal or badhaane kaa ye faisla bhi khud general qamar javed bajva kaa hi he
 Let us tell you that the current army chief of Pakistan, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, was to retire in November
 lekin pradhanmantri imran khan ke offis se is baat kii ghoshnaa kii gai ki general bajva or teen saal ke liye sena pramukh bane rahenge
 The current climate of Kashmir is the biggest headache for Pakistan
 or is mushkil daur main army chif bajva kaman apane haath main rakhana chaahate hai
 Pakistan has the sixth largest army in the world
 jiskaa desh ke parmaanu hathiyaaron par bhi niyantran he
 And in a situation like war, the Pakistan Army can coup as before
 aapako bataa den ki pakistan banane ke baad se vahaan kai baar takhtapalat kiya ja chukaa he
 Most of the army has ruled Pakistan
 maujuuda vakt main abhi pakistan main chuni hui sarkaar he par pakistan kii vipakshi partiyaan imran khan ko cylected piem kahati hai
 Which means the army has remained a pawn
 or ab qamar bajva kaa ye ekstansion pakistan kii videsh niti par sainya varchasv ko hi dikhalaa rahaa he
 The army chief of Pakistan is not only dominated by the foreign policy of the country, but also in the domestic affairs of the army
 kashmir masale par bhi sena pramukh qamar bajva hi bade faisle le rahe hai
 Therefore, General Qamar Bajwa cannot have a chance to take this situation of conflict with India in his hands

 gaadi chalaane waalon ko lagata he ki unka kuch nahin hoga, jabaki sadak par paidal chalane vaale khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karte hai
 Drunken-driving has made the situation even more serious
 hycourt par tippanee karte hue supreme court ne kaha, yahaan tak ki court bhi is maamle main kadi sajaa se bachate hai
 In many cases people lose their lives, in many cases the victim survives, but his life becomes worse than death
 aise main court muaavja dene yaa phir kam umr kaa hawala dekar doshi ko aasaani se chhod dete hai
 The Supreme Court has said that stringent provisions are needed in these cases and the government should change the law to make the provision of 304A more stringent

 Bollywood now another horror film, Witch Story, to fill a new twist in these stories of witches
 yah film 13 may ko relies hone ja rahi he

 unhone kaha tha ki bishnoi samaaj khud shikaar karata he
 Kunika said, a TV show was debating about the black deer hunting case
 jisamen maine kaha tha ki salmaan ko sajaa dilaane kii bajaay bishnoi samaaj ko unhen ek udhaaharan kii tarah lenaa chahie or salmaan kii bel kaa virodh nahin karnaa chahie
 After getting out of jail, Salman Khan has done these 5 works till date, Bishnoi society should get Salman to work for his community

 ve bataati hai, mujhe santosh bishnoi naam ke shaks ne phone kiya or mujhe apane bayaan par maafee maangane ko kaha
 i obeyed him because i had no proof that Bishnois are carnivores
 lekin iske baad bhi dhamke bhare phone nahin ruke
 Salman did not eat jail food, clothes too, and the attired girl from home started receiving threatening messages on Facebook
 itnaa sab hone ke baad actress ne soshal media par video post kar apane bayaan par maafee maangi
 Even after this, such calls did not stop
 aakhir main ve police ke paas shikaayat darj karaane pahunchin
 Meanwhile, the Bishnoi community is also reported to have lodged a police complaint against Kunika

 The first Test match of the four-test series between India and Australia will be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Monday
 clark ke mutabik vah bina kisi vivaad ke shrinkhalaa khelnaa chaahate hai
 Clarke said at the press conference, "both teams understand where we are
 australian team or bhartiya team ke bich sambandh majboot nahin ho sakate
 We understand very well that there is a boundary line between the two teams that you cannot cross
 " bakaul clark, "main is baat kii guarantee le saktaa hum ki austrailian team is seemaa rekha ko nahin laanghegi
 Despite this, if she tries to cross it, she will be punished by the ICC and Cricket Australia
 " clark ne kaha, "ham behatar cricket khilne kii koshish karenge or seemaa rekha langhane se bachenge
 "it is notable that the" Monkeygate "controversy episode came to light four years ago during the Sydney Test in Australia
 isamen bharat ke harbhajan singh or austrailia ke andrew symonds shaamil the

 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan saket court ne sibiai se kaha ki sabhi peediton dwaara lagaae aaropon kii report bhi sibiai pesh kare
 The CBI has to tell in this report how many girls have been sexually abused on the basis of medical reports
 court ne kaha ki kai ladakiyon ne kaha to he ki hamaare saath galat hua he lekin unhone kisi par sidhaa aarope nahin lagaaya he
 The CBI told the court that the reason was that most of the girls were scared
 court main is baat ko lekar bhi bahes hui ki ladakiyon ne jo bayaan darj karaayaa he unamem unke saath akhir kiya kya gaya
 The CBI said that most of the girls were sexually abused after giving them drugs
 isliye jaj ne kaha ki jab bihar se is maamle kaa trial dilli transfar kiya gaya he to sabhi ladakiyon ko court main laakar unka bayaan darj karana behad jaruri he
 During the hearing, the court made it clear that whatever happened to the Muzaffarpur Shelter Home of the victims aged between 12 to 14 years, the trial was conducted by framing charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POSCO) Act
 Will go
 jabaki 16 saal se upar kii peedit ladakiyon ke maamle main dhara 354 ke tahat aarope tay karke maamla chalaaya jayega

 haalanki is maamle main bihar sarkaar in ladakiyon ke court main hone vaale bayaan ko video conferencing ke jariye darj karana chaahati thi
 The judge questioned this, saying that in such a situation, he has doubts about how truthful the recorded statements of the girls will be given without any pressure
 isliye unhen dilli main laakar bayaan darj karana hi behatar hoga
 The court also made it clear that while the girls from Bihar were brought to Delhi, the news would not be made public

 The Finance Ministry is now eyeing the Reserve Bank, concerned about the rising crude oil prices due to political instability in West Asia
 mantralay chahta he ki kendriya bank ko mahangaai par ankush ke upayon par dhyaan or zyada dhyaan dena chahie
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has given a similar indication to the central bank
 rigerv bank 17 march ko maudrik niti kii madhya timahi samiksha pesh karegaa
 Since March 2010, the central bank has increased policy rates seven times under measures to curb inflation
 haalanki ab mahangaai kii dar neeche aa rahi he, par ab duusare kaaran saamne aa gaye hai
 Crude oil prices are rising internationally due to political instability in West Asia and North Africa
 aise main aagaamee maheenon main mahangaai kii dar ke neeche aane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Addressing the RBI board of directors last week, Mukherjee said that inflation needs to be curbed in times of uncertainty with oil prices, with the post-crisis economic recovery and the pace of growth

 jaipur main 'shri rajput karani sena' kii hunkaar raily phuss sabit hui he
 Karni had called his rally in Vidyadhar Nagar of Jaipur to show the strength of Rajputs before the Legislative Assembly elections
 vidyadhar nagar stadium main bada manch banaaya gaya tha or kareeb 40,000 kursiyaan lagaai gai thim
 The rally was supposed to start at 11 pm but 200 people could not gather after 2 pm
 aakhirkaar khaali kursiyon ko sambodhit kar hi netaa chalate bane
 When the crowd did not come, Karni Sena convenor Lokendra Singh Kalvi said that due to Karva Chauth, not a single woman has come out of the house, even though the men have not come
 is baat kii ham jaanch karenge ki aakhir kya hua ki log nahin aae
 Everywhere people themselves had said that more buses were sent to come but if people have not come then they will find out the reasons and rally on November 14 and show their strength by showing the crowd
 mana ja rahaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle kaalvi ne karani sena kii raily tikaton kii saudebaaji ke liye kii thi or yah baat rajputon main fail gai ki karani sena congress or bijepi se saudebaaji kar sakati he
 Hence Rajputs kept away from the Karni Sena rally
 kaalvi ne kaha ki har jagah gutbaji hoti he magar ham isko thik karenge
 However, in a gesture, Kalvi made his intention that he had an inclination towards BJP
 karani sena ke sanyojak ne kaha ki congress 12-14 rajputon ko tikat detii he jabaki bijepi 25 rajputon ko tikat detii he
 In such a situation, if the Congress wants Rajput to come on its side, then at least give tickets as much as BJP
 karani sena padmavati film kaa virodh karke surkhiyon main ai thi, tab saamaajik sanghathan ke taur par rajput in ke saath bhaavnaatmak rup se jude the or isi vajah se karani sena apane aap ko bada samajhane lagi

 rashtriya karani sena ne bhi aaj kotputli main raily kar rajput samaaj ke liye congress or bijepi donon se apana paksh saaf karne ke liye kaha
 Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, president of the Rashtriya Karni Sena, has sought a road map for the well being of Rajputs from both the Congress and the BJP, and only then to support the Rajput vote

 ' Congress President Rahul Gandhi fiercely attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to mark the completion of 2 years of demonetisation and alleged that the Modi government's move was a self-generated tragedy and suicide attack that led to the Prime Minister's suit-booted friends Worked to whiten his black money
