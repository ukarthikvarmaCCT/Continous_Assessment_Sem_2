 devimahatmyam hinduon kaa ek dharmik granth he jisamen devi durga kii mahisasur naamak rakshas ke upar vijay kaa varnan he

 This Mahamaya Shakti conducts the three stages of the universe in three forms
 sristi, avasthaaon kaa lagaataar parivartan he
 The measure of change is time
 bina kaal ke parivartan kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore, in the first stage, it is Mahamaya in the form of Mahakali Shakti that speeds up the creation
 parivartan kii nirantarata main kaal ke kisi vishesh bindu par sristi kaa ek swaroop or keval ek vahi swaroop banataa he| uskaa sangharan or samposhan vah mahalakshmi ke rup main karti he
 The third stage of creation is the advance stage of development, when there is multi-faceted development of consciousness
 is avasthaa kaa sanchaalan or niyanntran mahasaraswati ke rup main vah karti he
 These three stages of the universe have been presented in comprehensible form for the general public
 In the first phase, Bramha, the creator of the universe, wanted to kill two demons named Madhu and Kaitabh
 These extreme powers, Tamoguni and Rajoguni respectively, are a crisis for development
 Brahma requested protection from Mahamaya
 With the inspiration of Mahamaya, Vishnu Yoginindra renounced and killed the demons
 The work of creation of Brahma goes ahead
 duusari avasthaa sabhyataa kii praarambhik avasthaa-ganga sindhu ke maidan kii tatkaaleen junglee avasthaa kaa pratikatmak varnan he
 Relatively weak human group in physical force from animals - Aryashakti chose to overtake the carriage of his civilization among the terrifying wild animals like buffalo etc

 When Ramanand came home after reaching the pilgrimage and reached Gurumath, his Gurubhais objected to having meals with him
 unka anumaan tha ki ramanand ne tirthaton main avashya hi khanpan sambandhi chuaachhut kaa koi vichaar nahin kiya hoga
 Seeing this request of his disciples, Raghavananda advised him to run a new sect
 yaheen se ramanand sampradaay kaa janm hua
 From these points of view, there is a difference between Ramananda sect and Ramanuja sect, but from philosophical theory both sects are the source of specific ideology
 donon hi brahm ko chidachidvishisht maanate hai or donon hi ke mat ke poshak hai
 Both consider Brahma to be Chidachishdishishtha and in both the ways the solution of salvation is the 'greatness' of Paramopasya
 ramanand sampradaay main nimnlikhit baaten pradhan hai - Ramananda showed the path of benevolent devotion
 unke shishyon main julaha, chamaar, jat, rajput, aadi or striyaan bhi thim
 The door of devotion was free for all
 unhone vairaagi sampradaay kii sthapana isi kaaran kii
 His teachings resulted in two ideologies that were against change
 duusari naveen vichaardhaara jo parivartan karke hindu, musalmaan sabhi ko sammilit karne ko udyat thi
 The greatest person of the first ideology was Saint Tulsidas and the main person of the second ideology was Sant Kabirdas
 ramanand sampradaay ko jo shri sampradaay kaha jaataa he usamen 'shri' shabd kaa arth lakshmi ke sthaan par 'sita' kiya jaataa he
 The philosophical view of this sect is considered to be the Vishayadvaita, as mentioned above
 vishishtadvait shabd kaa arth is prakaar kiya gaya he - vishishta chaa vishishta c vishishte, vishishtaoradwaite vishishtadvaitham arthath sookshm chidachit vishisht athwa kaaran brahm or sthool chidachid vishisht athwa kaary brahm main abhinnata sthapit karnaa hi vishishtadvait kaa uddeshy he
 In the Ramananda sect, Rama is called Brahma and 'sitaram' is considered adorable
 swami ji kaa brahm ram vishwa kii utpatti, raksha or iskaa lay karata he
 With its light, the sun and the moon illuminate the world
 jo vaayu ko chalyman karata he, jo prithvi ko sthir rakhata he, vah gyanaswaroop, sakshi, anek shubh gunon se yukt, avinashi evam vishwabharta ishwar hi brahm he
 This Brahman is continual; The legislator of Brahmadi, the preceptor of the Vedas, is himself omniscient
 sadayogiyon kii rakhaa karata he, chetan ko bhi chetanta pradaan karata he, swatantra he
 This Brahm post shows the realization of Shri Ramchandra

 vahi ekmaatr upaay bhi hai
 Lakshman is the dearest among the councilors of Lord Rama
 anumaan bhi unke duusare parshad hai
 Swami ji has ordered Lord Rama's archavatara or Pratimvatara to worship all four of his own person, divine, siddha and manusha with hematism
 ramanand ji ke mat se sita ke dwaara hi ram kii prapti hoti he
 Maharani Sita is a man of men and she is also the solution

 The person who lives in an exuberant body from God, according to self-respect, God is the one who is always supportive, to understand himself as the Karta, the bhokta, who is proud to know, is known by the inquisitors of the element, the best scholar calls him Jiva
 yah jeev gyanaswaroop, anandswarup tathaa gyaan or sukh aadi gunonvala, anu parimanwala, dehendriyadi se bhi apurv, paramatma kaa priy, nity evam swaprakash he
 Lord Sheshi and Jiva are his remaining
 bhagavan hi jeevon ke swami hai
 The living organism is independent
 at: bhagavan kii nirhetuk krupa ke bina jeev ko moksh nahin mil saktaa
 Ramananda has accepted new types of relations between God and Jiva, like father-son-relationship, Raksha-rakshak-relation, sevya-sevak-relation, soul-spirituality relationship and bhagya-bhoktritta
 jeevon ke do bhed hai - baddh or mukt
 Many types of bodies have been described as arrogant living beings by the amount of eternal actions
 baddh jeev do prakaar ke hai - 1
 mumukshu, 2
 bubhukshu
 Those who try to get rid of the tendency of interest of lust for evil deeds by the unquenchable grace of God are called Mumukshu
 iske viruddh sansaarik bhoga kii kaamnawale jeev bubhukshu kehalaate hai
 There are also two types of Mumukshu Jiva - 1

 The film has 9 songs composed by Nitin Raikwad, sanjeev-darshan, Karya Arora and Shri d and the songs are Moeed Elham, Nitin Raikwad, Kumar, Soni Ravan and Shri d which were released on 15 October 2013
 bollywood hangaamaa par taran adarsh ne film ko reating dete hue likhaa he ki satya 2 main ek sarvotkrisht gangster film banane ke tatv upasthit hai
 Madhurita Mukherjee of The Times of India has given the film stars
 bibisi hindi par komal nahata ne film ko 1 / 2 reating dete hue likhaa he - "is film ko ‘satya’ nahin balki ‘satyanaash’ kahana zyaada thik hoga
 " vayumandal kii ardrata naapane ke sadhano ko ardrathamapi kehete hai
 There are many substances, such as sulfuric acid, calcium chloride, phosphorus pentaoxide, common salt, etc
, which are absorbent of water vapor
 inkaa upyog karke rasinic ardathamapi banaae jate hai, jinke dwaara vaayu ke ek nishchit aaytan main vidyaman jalawaashp kii maatra gram main gyaat kii jaati he
 Weigh in a bottle by filling phosphorus pentaoxide and calcium chloride in two or three tubes
 phir is bottle ko ek vayuchooshak kii shrunkhlaa main jod dete hai
 When the sucker is turned on, the water falls and the air enters the empty space through the bottle and the tubes
 purvokt rasinic padaarth vaayu ke jalawaashp ko sokh lete hai or sukhi vaayu chooshak main ekatra ho jaati he
 Bottles and taps are then weighed with chemical substances
 pehali taul ko isamen se ghataakar jalawaashp kii maatra, jo ekatrit vaayu ke bheetar thi, gyaat ho jaati he
 Humidity can be detected with such precision with such a device, but it takes time to get results
 anya ardrathamapi dine, danniel yaa reno ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Through them we find the dew point
 phir is osank or vaayu ke taap par vashpadaab kaa maan, reno kii sarini dekhakar, aapekshik ardrata gyaat kar sakate hai
 In addition to this, wet and dry bulb hygrometer has been constructed for instantaneous knowledge of moisture in the air
 ise cicrometer bhi kehete hai
 In this device, two identical thermometers are mounted on the same board
 ek tapamapi ke balb par kapadaa lapeta rahata he, jo sadaa bhigaa rahata he
 For this, one end of the cloth is immersed in the water of the pot kept below
 kapade ke jal kaa vashpibhawan rahata he, jo vaayu kii ardrata par nirbhar rahata he
 When there is a lack of moisture in the air, the evaporation is more and its main part is a hair, which fluctuates according to the maximum humidity
 jab vaayu main nami kii adhikta hoti he to vashpibhawan kam hota he
 According to evaporation, the mercury of a wet-bulb thermometer comes down and a difference is found in the lessons of the two thermometers
 unke paathon main yah antar vaayu kii nami kii maatra par nirbhar rahata he
 If the air is saturated with water vapor, the text of the two thermometers remains the same
 reno kii sarini main vibhinn tapon par is antar ke anukool jalawaashp kii daab di hui he, at: donon tapamapiyon kaa paath lekar aapekshik ardrata tathaa osank kaa maan gyaat kiya jaataa he
 With the aim of changing the air on the thermometers, it is organized to rotate some cyclometers at a speed
 takhti motor dwaara prati second chaar baar ghumaai jaati he, jisase vaayu sadaa badalati rahati he
 The relative humidity table for such cyclometers is adapted to the corresponding revision number 4
 paribhraman sepaare kii sataha hilti rahati he
 Other remedies have been used to correct this defect and for pure measurement
 ek prakaar ke yantra main donon tapamapiyon ko dhaatu kii dohari nalee ke bheetar sthir rakhaa jaataa he or nalee ke bheetar kii hawa ek chote bijli ke pankhe dwaara badalati rahati he
 The radiation from such a double wall tube is also not affected
 kintu uparokt ardrathamapiyon se ardrata kaa maan sheeghra nahin gyaat kiya ja saktaa
 Apart from this, the amount of moisture in the air varies from moment to moment and we need to know the moisture every minute throughout the day
 purvokt yantron dwaara ham vayumandal ke upree bhaag kii ardrata kaa adhyayan bhi nahin kar sakate
 In order to accomplish these purposes, de Sosseur first created a hygroscope, looking at the effect of moisture on hair length
 is ardratadarshak main ek ruukhaa svachh bal rahata he
 One end of the hair is held in a fine piece of metal by a screw
 neeche kii ore bal kaa ek pheraa ek ghirani par lapet diya jaataa he
 The end of the hair is then fastened by a screw to the pulley
 ghirani kii dhuree par ek sanketak laga rahata he
 When the length of the hair is increased, due to a segregation, the pulley rotates on one side and decreases on the other side and with it the indicator moves on a circular scale
 maapni kaa anshankan ardrathaman main kiya rahata he, at: sanketak ke sthaan se maapni par ardrata kaa maan pratishat turant padhaa ja saktaa he
 Based on this, self-written hygrometers have been created, by which the value of humidity of 24 hours or every moment of the whole week is written on the graph
 kintu ek bal se itani pushtataa nahin aati ki ghirani ke sanketak se graph likhvaya ja sake, visheshkar jab aisa upkaran gubaare athwa vimaan main upree vayumandal ke adhyayan ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
 a bunch of hair or rope is used for confirmation
 parantu isse ardrathamapi kii yatharthata ghat jaati he
 It has been observed that one hair of horse is more useful than rope of human hair
 isliye inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he, parantu ek anya dosha ke kaaran sheet pradeshon main iskaa upyog nahin ho saktaa
 Due to the decrease in temperature, the hair's attrition towards water vapor is reduced
 tab upkaran bahut samay ke baad nami se prabhavit hota he
 -40 ° c But the hair becomes very frustrated
 ab kuch aise vidyut chaalak padaarthon kaa pataa chalaa he jinke vaidyut avrodh main jalawaashp ke kaaran parivartan hota he
 Dunmore has designed such a thermometer to study the upper atmosphere
 isamen lithium fluoride kii patali parat hoti he jiskaa vaidyut avrodh jalawaashp ke kaaran badalata he
 This layer remains in the electrodeath
 avrodh ke parivartan se dhara ghatati badhati he, at: dharamapi kii maapni par ardrathaman padhaa ja saktaa he
 The humidity value can also be plotted on the graph by making the indicator of the thermometer as self-writing
 gubaare or vayuyanon main praaia: aise hi ardrathamapi lage rahete hai
 a fractional number used in fluid dynamics and temperature variation
 amarushtakam sanskrit kaa ek geetikavy he
 Its creators are Amaru or Amaruk
 iskaa rachana kaal naveen shatee mana jaataa he
 It has 100 verses which are very beautiful and captivating
 naam se yah shatak he, parantu iske padyon kii sankhya ek sau se kahin adhik he
 The number of all shlokas in the Suktisangras, including the verses referred to as Amaruk, is 163

 On top of this, ten interpretations were composed in different centuries, in which Arjun Varmdev's 'rasik Sanjeevani' is famous for its scholarship and poignancy
 aanandavardhan kii sammati main amaruuk ke muktak itane saras tathaa bhavpurn hai ki alpakaay hone par bhi ve prabandhkavy kii samta rakhte hai
 The Sanskrit rhetoric has introduced many of his verses for examples of acoustics, and introduced his literary Sushma
 amaruuk shabdakavi nahin hai, pratyut rasakavi hai jinka mukhya lakshya kavy main ras kaa prachur unmesh he
 The verses of Amarushtak are full of adornment juice and are capable of drawing vivid pictures of the living in love

 kambuj yaa kamboj cambodia kaa pracheen sanskrit naam he
 The earliest Indian colony in the erstwhile Indochina peninsula was established in the Funan region around the first century AD
 lagbhag 600 varshon tak phunaan ne is pradesh main hindu samskruti kaa prachaar evam prasar karne main mahatvapurn yoga diya
 Subsequently, a great kingdom of Kambuj or Kambhoj was established in this region, whose glorious tradition of wonderful opulence continued till the 14th century AD
 is pracheen vaibhav ke avshesh aaj bhi angkorwat, angkorthom naamak sthanon main vartmaan hai
 According to the ancient legends of Kamboj, the foundation of this colony was laid by King Kambu Swayambhuva of 'aryadesh'
 vah bhagavan shiv kii prerana se kamboj desh main aae or yahan basii hui naag jati ke raja kii sahaayta se unhone is junglee marusthal main ek nayaa rajya basaaya jo nagaraj kii adbhut jaaduugari se hare bhare, sundar pradesh main parinat ho gaya
 Kambu married Nagaraj's daughter Mera and laid the foundation of the Kambuj dynasty
 yah bhi sambhav he ki bhartiya kamboj se bhi indochin main sthit is upnivesh kaa sambandh rahaa ho
 In the third century AD, an ambassador of Murunds who had settled on the northwestern border of India reached Funan and probably brought the horse of Kamboj with them
 kamboj ke pratham aitihaasik rajvansh kaa sansthaapak shrutvarman tha jisane kamboj desh ko phunaan kii adheenta se mukt kiya
 His son Shresthavarman settled the capital named Shresthapur in his name whose ruins are located near Watfu hill in Laos
 tatpashchaat bhavavarman ne, jiskaa sambandh phunaan or kamboj donon hi rajwanshon se tha, ek nayaa vansh chalaaya or apane hi naam bhavapur naamak rajdhani basaai
 The development of Kamboj begins with the time of Bhavavarman and his brother Mahendravarman
 phunaan kaa purana rajya ab jeernsheern ho chukaa tha or sheeghra hi is nae durgharsh samrajya main villin ho gaya
 After Mahendravarman's death, his son Ishaanavarman ascended the throne
 is pratapi raja ne kamboj rajya kii simaaon kaa dur-dur tak vistaar kiya
 He established diplomatic relations with India and Champa and built a new capital named Ishanpur
 ishanvarman ne champa ke raja jagaddharm ko apni putree byaahi thi jiskaa putr prakashdharm apane pita kii mrityu ke pashchaat champa kaa raja hua
 This suggests that Champa was under the political influence of Kamboj at this time
 ishanvarman ke baad bhavavarman dwitiya or jayavarman pratham kamboj nareshon ke naam milte hai
 This dynasty came to an end in 674 AD after Jayavarman
 kuch hi samay ke uparaant kamboj kii shakti ksheen hone lagi or dhire-dhire 8veen sadi i
 main java ke shailendra raajaaon kaa kamboj desh par aadhipatay sthapit ho gaya
 The Kamboj history of the 8th century AD is not very clear, but as soon as the beginning of the 9th century, the power of this ancient empire resurfaced
 iskaa shrey jayavarman dwitiya ko diya jaataa he
 He laid the foundation of Angkor dynasty and liberated Kamboj from the subjugation of Java
 usne sambhavat: bharat se hiranyadas naamak brahman ko bulawaakar apane rajya kii suraksha ke liye tantric kriyaayein karwaain
 This scholar Brahmin founded a sect called Devaraja which soon became the kingship of Kamboj
 jayavarman ne apni rajdhani kramash: kuti, hariharaalay or amrendrapur naamak nagaron main banaai jisase spasht he ki vartmaan cambodia kaa praaia: samast kshetra uske adheen tha or rajya kii shakti kaa centre dhire-dhire purv se pashchim kii ore badhata hua antat: angkore ke pradesh main sthapit ho gaya tha
 Jayavarman II was named Kambujarajendra and his Maharani under the name Kambujarajalakshmi during his time
 isi samay se cambodia ke pracheen naam kambuj yaa kamboj kaa videshi lekhakon ne bhi prayog karnaa prarambh kar diya tha
 Even after Jayavarman II, the empire of Kamboj continued to grow and grow and within a short time the empire of Kamboj spread throughout the Indochina peninsula
 maharaj indravarman ne anek mandiron or tadaagon kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 Yashovarman was a scholar of Hindu scriptures and Sanskrit poetry and he gave royalty to many scholars
 uske samay ke anek sundar sanskrit abhilekh prapya hai
 During this period, there was unprecedented progress of Hinduism, literature and period
 yashovarman ne kambupuri yaa yashodharpur naam kii nai rajdhani basaai
 Angkor Thom, the great center of religion and culture, also adorned this city
 'angkore samskruti' kaa swarnakaal isi samay se hi pranrabh hota he
 In 944 AD, Rajendravarman was the king of Kamboj, whose large inscriptions of the time are found written in beautiful Sanskrit poetry
 1001 i
 tak kaa samay kamboj ke itihaas main mahatvapurn he kyonki is kaal main kamboj kii seemayen china ke dakshini bhaag chooti thim, laos uske antargat tha or uskaa raajnneetik prabhaav syam or uttari malaya tak failaa hua tha
 Suryavarman i established Kamboj's suzerainty over almost all of Siamese and also invaded the southern Brahmadesh
 vah sahitya, nyaay or vyakaran kaa pandit tha tathaa swayan buddha hote hue bhi shaiva or vaishnav dharmon kaa premi or sangrakshak tha
 He tried to reinvigorate the state by ending the civil war in the country at the time of his coronation
 uttari champa ko jitkar suryavarman ne use kamboj kaa karad rajya bana liya kintu sheeghra hi dakshin champa ke raja jayahari varman se haar manani padi
 At this time there was a lot of unrest in Cambog due to civil wars and conflicts with neighboring countries
 jayavarman saptam ke rajyakaal main pun: ek baar kamboj kii pracheen yash:pataakaa fahraane lagi
 He formed a large army which included the soldiers of Siamese and Brahmadesh
 jayavarman ne anaam par akraman kar use jeetne kaa bhi prayaas kiya kintu nirantar yudhon ke kaaran shanai: shanai: kamboj kii sainik shakti kaa hraas hone laga, yahan tak ki 1220 i
 main kambojon ko champa se hatana padaa
 But even then Jayavarman VII is counted among the great rulers of Kamboj as it was during that time that the expansion of the empire of Kamboj reached its extreme limit
 jayavarman saptam ne apni nai rajdhani vartmaan angkorthom main banaai thi
 Its ruins are still counted among the famous ancient relics of the world
 nagar ke chaturdik ek unchaa parkota tha or 110 gaj chaudee ek parikha thi
 Its length was about eight and a half miles
 nagar ke parcote ke paanch singhdwar the jinase paanch vishaal rajpath nagar ke andar jate the
 These Rajpaths were found near the Virat Hindu Temple in Beyoncé, which was located in the center of the city
 mandir main 66,625 vyakti niyukt the or iske vyay ke liye 3,400 graamon kii aay lagi hui thi
 It is known from an inscription at this time that there were 789 temples and 102 hospitals and 121 hospital houses in Kamboj
 jayavarman saptam ke pashchaat kamboj ke itihaas ke anek sthal adhik spasht nahin hai
 In the 13th century, Kamboj lacked strong political power
 kuch itihasalekhakon ke anusaar kamboj ne 13veen sadi ke antim charan main china ke samrat kuble khan kaa aadhipaty maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 a messenger Angkorthom arrived from China in 1296 AD, a member of which shu-tan-kuan wrote a detailed and entertaining account of the then Kambos which was translated into French in 1902 AD
 14veen sadi main kamboj ke padosi rajyon main nai raajnneetik shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha tathaa syam or champa ke thai log kamboj kii ore badhane kaa nirantar prayaas kar rahe the
 The result was that there was a lot of pressure from two sides on Kamboj and it started to crush between the millstones of these two countries
 dhire-dhire kamboj kii pracheen mahatta samaapt ho gai or ab yah desh indochin kaa ek saadhaaran pichhadaa hua pradesh banakar rah gaya
 In the 19th century, French influence increased in Indochina; By the way, they came to this peninsula in the 16th century itself and were looking for an opportunity to increase their power
 vah avasar ab or 1854 i
 main kamboj ke nirbal raja ankaduong ne apana desh francisiyon ke haathon saunp diya
 Noordam i confirmed the deal on 11 August 1863 AD and for the next 80 years, Cambose or Cambodia remained a part of french-indochina
 1904-41 main syam or francisiyon ke bich honevaale yuddh main cambodia kaa kuch pradesh syam ko de diya gaya kintu dwitiya vishwayuddh ke pashchaat 1945 i
 main yah bhaag use pun: praapt ho gaya
 At this time the independence movement was also underway in Cambodia as a result of which France provided a new constitution to Cambodia
 kintu isse vahaan ke rashtrapramiyon ko santosh na hua or unhone 1949 i
 main francisiyon ko ek nae samanaite par hastakshar karne par vivash kar diya jisase unhone cambodia kii swatantra raajnneetik satta ko sweekaar kar liya, kintu ab bhi desh ko french union ke antargat hi rakhaa gaya tha
 Cambodia's influential King Noradam Sinhanuk continued his national movement against it
 inke praytn se cambodia sheeghra hi swatantra raashtra ban gaya or ye apane desh ke pratham pradhan mantri chune gaye
 Kamboj was an Indian colony in real sense
 vahaan ke nivaasiyon kaa dharm, unki samskruti evam sabhyataa, saahitiyik paramparaayen, vaastukala or bhashaa-sabhi par bhartiyata kii amit chhap thi jiske darshan aaj bhi kamboj ke darshak ko anayas hi ho jate hai
 Hinduism and the Vaishnava sect and then Buddhism were the kings of the Kambos and many Sanskrit inscriptions here would find it difficult to separate them from the Indian inscriptions due to their religious and mythological cultural background
 udhaaharan ke liye rajendravarman ke ek vishaal abhilekh kaa keval ek ansh yahan prastut he jisamen shiv kii vandana kii gai he : The old Arab tourists rightly named Kamboj as the Hindu country

 Thousands of Sanskrit words in Kambuj language in their Kambuji or Khmer form are still found today
 khmer lipi dakshini bharat kii pallav or purvi chalukya lipiyon ke mail se bani he
 Indian influence on the architecture, sculpture and painting of Kamboj is evident
 angkorthom kaa beyon mandir dakshin bharat ke mandiron se bahut miltaa-julata he
 Its peak also gives a clear glimpse of the peaks of Indian temples
 is mandir or ellora ke kailas mandir ke kalathatv, visheshat: murtikari tathaa aalekhya vishyon or drishyon main adbhut samya he
 a beautiful depiction of the social condition of Kamboj, the description of shu-tan-kutan is as follows- cambodia - kamboj kaa arvachin naam he
 It is a country on the Indian China Peninsula which was freed from French occupation in 1955 AD
 19veen shatabdi ke purv yah pradesh khmer rajya kaa ang tha kintu 1863 i

 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts

 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho

 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces

 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
