 haalanki hamaara yah pehla super computer nahin he
 Much earlier in 1998, scientists from C-DAC, Pune, created the 'param-1 xxrep 4 0 ' supercomputers and claimed that the supercomputer was 50 times faster than the current American supercomputers at the time
 lekin uske baad super computing ko lekar bharat main waisi utsukata nahin dikhaai di, jaisi anya viksit mulkon main is dauraan rahi he
 But now it seems that India does not want to be backward in this race, which is the result of this Tata supercomputer

 Lingayatism is a part of the oldest Sanatan Hindu religion of India
 is mat ke zyaadaatar anuyaayi dakshin bharat main hai
 This opinion is based on the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv jo satya sundar or sanathan hai, jinase sristi kaa udgaar hua, jo aadi anant hai
 In Hinduism, there is a description of the trinity, in which the name of Lord Shiva comes first
 shiv jinase sristi kii utpatti hui
 After this, the origin of Lord Brahma, who gives life to the whole world
 bhagwaan vishnu jo sampoorn jagat ke paalanhaar hai
 The third part is the origin of Lord Mahesh, that is, destroying the liberated souls and re-establishing life in the liberation cycle
 lingayat sampradaay bhagwaan shiv jo ki brahma, vishnu, mahesh, charachar jagat ke utpatti ke kaarak hai unki stuti aradhana karata he
 In other words, you can call them followers of Shaivism
 is sampradaay kii sthapana 12veen shatabdi main mahatma basavannaa ne kii thi
 The worshipers of this religion are called Lingayats
 yah shabd kannada shabd lingwant se vyutpann he
 These people mainly follow the teachings of Mahatma Basavanna
 'virshaiv' kaa shabdic arth he - 'jo shiv kaa param bhakt ho'
 But with the passage of time, Veerashaiva's philosophy, philosophy, practice, rituals, social mobilization, Acharanyam etc
 became different from other sects
 yadhyapi virshaiv desh ke anya bhaagon - maharashtra, andhra, tamil kshetra aadi - main bhi paae jate hai kintu unki sabase adhik sankhya karnataka main pai jaati he
 Shaivites derive their religious beliefs and philosophy from the Vedas and the 28 Shaivagams
 virshaiv bhi vedon main avishvaas nahin prakat karte kintu unke darshan, karmkand tathaa samajasudhar aadi main aisi vishistataaen viksit ho gai hai jinaki vyutpatti mukhya rup se shaivagamon tathaa aise antardrushti yogiyon se hui maani jaati he jo 'vachanakaar' kehalaate hai
 In the nearly three centuries between the 12th and 16th centuries, there have been some 300 pledges, of which 30 have been women
 inamen sabase prasiddh naam basav kaa he jo kalyaan ke jain raja vijjal kaa pradhan mantri tha
 He was not only a yogi mahatma but also a karmat Sanghatanaka who established the Veerashaiva sect
 vaasav kaa lakshya aisa aadhyatmik samaaj bananaa tha jisamen jati, dharm yaa stripurush kaa bhedbhaav na rahe
 He was opposed to ritualistic fanatics and emphasized the truth of mental purity and devotion
 vah maatr ek ishwar kii upasna kaa samarthak tha or usne puja tathaa dhyaan kii paddati main saralata laane kaa praytn kiya
 a wonderful revolution arose in the society due to the end of caste discrimination and the rise of women
 gyanayog bhaktiyog tathaa karmyog - teenon vachanakaron ko maanya hai kintu bhakthi par sabase adhik jor diya jaataa he
 Many of the followers of Vasava were Harijans and they also performed inter-caste marriages
 virashaivon kaa sampradaay 'shakti vishishtadvait' kehalaata he
 The Supreme Chaitanya or Supreme Agreement is beyond the country, time and other qualities
 para sanvid kii shakti hi is vishwa kaa utpaadak kaaran he
 The world or world is not false
 ek lambii or bahumukhi prakriya ke parinamswaroop bahurupadhari sansar kii utpatti hoti he
 What we see in humans is the development of specialization and self-consciousness, but this self-consciousness is the motivating reason for the attempt to reunite with the Supreme Consciousness
 sadhana ke parinaam swaroop jab ishwar kaa sachcha bhakt samadhi kii sarvocch sthiti ko praapt hota he tab summersaiky kii sthiti arthath ishwar ke prayek swaroop ke saath purna ekta kii sthiti utpann hoti he
 This is the state of bliss or salvation of man
 ise purna vilyan na maanakar milan ke paramanand main barabari se hissaa grahan karnaa samajhnaa adhik acha hoga
 Veerashaivas have established a tradition of spiritual discipline called 'shatasthala Shastra'
 yah maanav kii saadhaaran chetana kaa angsthal ke pratham prakram se lingsthal ke sarvocch kram par pahunch jane kii sthiti kaa suchak he
 In the whole process of spiritual practice, spiritual discipline, the emphasis is on devotion and refuge
 virshaiv mahatmaon kii kabhi kabhi 'sharan' yaa shivasharan kehete hai yane aise log jinhone shiv kii sharan main apane aapako arpit kar diya he
 His practice is called Shivayoga
 virashaivvaad mulat: advaitavaadi darshan he kintu yat: paramatma kriya or dhyaan se pare he or hamaare vaastavik anubhav kii duniya ke astitv kii vyakhya ichha tathaa kriya ke bina nahin kii ja sakati, isliye shiv ke shakti siddhant kii kalpana kii gai
 The spiritual aspirant uses one or all of his three powers to establish unity with God
 premashkti ke prayog kaa naam bhaktiyog, chintanashkti ke prayog kaa gyanayog tathaa karm shakti ke prayog kaa naam karmyog he
 It is through these that final unity with God is established
 isamen andeh nahin ki virashaivon ke bhi mandir, tirthasthan aadi vaise hi hote hai jaise anya sampradaayon ke, antar keval un devi devataaon main hota he jinaki puja kii jaati he
 As far as the relation of the Veerashaivas is concerned, the temples or other forms of cultivation are not as important as the idol of the favored linga, which is held on the body
 aadhyatmik guru prayek virshaiv ko isht ling arpit kar uske kaan main pavitra shadakshar mantra 'om nam: shivaay' phunk detaa he
 Each Veerashaiva bathes and worships with contemplation and meditation by placing the idol of the favored penis on the hand's gadali
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki prayek virshaiv main satyaparayanata, ahimsa, bandhutavbhaav jaise ucch naitik gunon ke hone kii aashaa kii jaati he
 He is indulgent and avoids alcoholic substances etc
 basav ne is sambandh main jo nidesh jari kiye the, unka saransh yah he - chori na karo, hatya na karo or na jhooth bolo, na apni prashansa karo na dusron kii ninda, apni patni ke sivaa anyash sab striyon ko mata ke samaan samajho

 Dalton Laboratory Scheme or 'dalton Scheme' is a concept of teaching which was started by the American academician Kumari Helen Parkhst
 san 1912 main america kii shikshashastrini kumari helen parkhst ne aath se 12 varsh ke bich kii avasthaavale baalkon ke liye ek nai shikshyojna banaai
 Although this plan was already in his mind, its actual use was done between 1913 and 1915
 isi bich pratham vishwayuddh chhid gaya or kumari parkharst ne bhi apni yojana thode din ke liye dhili kar di
 After the end of the World War, in 1920, he started his plan in schools in Dalton in the state of Massachusetts, USA
 iske pashchaat unhone ek bal vishvavidhyalay paathshaala sthapit karke usamen apni dalton prayogshaala yojana kaa vyavhaar kiya
 In those days, teachers were dominant in schools
 pashuon kii bhanti chaatr kaksharupi baade main band kar die jate the
 They used to tell the teachers what they told
 sunaate samay tanik sa bhi herpher hua ki beton se dhun die jate the
 Often the school was also in dark, narrow and less windy rooms
 vidhyaarthiyon ke munh par taale lage hue the
 The meritorious child did not have the opportunity to move at a fast pace and the maltreated boys did not have the facility to stop at their slow pace
 yadhyapi ruso, pastallujee or harbart jaise shikshashastriyon ne balak ke swatantra shikshavikas par bahut kuch likhaa or kaha tha, phir bhi adhikansh vidyalayon main dandwadi, pracheen panthiyon kaa samrajya tha
 All these things made the entire education system absolutely monotonous and interesting
 kumari helen parkharst ke komal nari hriday ko is kathor, akarun or neeras vaataavaran se atyant kshobh hua, isliye unhone america main apni dalton yojana chalaa di
 If she wished, she would have added her name to this scheme similar to that of Meria Montesauri, but she believes that it is not morally right to associate and bind an education system to her name
 unki yahi ichha rahi he ki is yojana ko vishesh niyamon or bandhanon main na jakadaaa jaae or isiilie vibhinn deshon or sthanon ke liye unhone badi chhot de di he
 From 1915 to 1918, Parkhurst also used the Montessori system in California and that is why some people consider this system to be the product of the Montessori, but the fact is not
 is prayogshaala yojana ke do mukhya siddhant hai
 It is clear from these principles that this Dalton scheme is not a new educational system but a new type of school system
 isamen vishay to ve hi padhaaye jate hai jo anya vidyalayon main, kintu isamen padhai kaa dhang, parinaam or prakaar bhinn hota he
 In this, the entire course is botched as a convenient monthly printed contract action plan, leaving time for holidays, frequency of lessons read and for students to practice automatically
 prayek paathya vishay ko ek varsh kii das masik kaaryayojanaon main baant diya jaataa he or is vidhyalay kaa maheenaa bees din kaa hota he
 In this contract work, the work of routine is referred to as the problem, as if the geography of India has been studied in the work of a contract of geography, then it is the work of the entire monthly or macro contract and small parts of it, such as geography, Climate etc
 are problems or daily tasks
 inamen se kuch samasyaon ke liye do din kaa or kuch ke liye aadhe din kaa samay diya jaataa he
 In these problems, instructions are given for reading, answering questions, drawing a map or writing a description and doing other tasks that give the student credit
 prayek vidhyaarthee is kaary ko theke ke rup main grahan karata or ek maheene ke liye diya hua nirdisht kaary nishchit samay main puraa karata he
 There is freedom in this that students can complete the work to be completed in one month according to their wish, in whatever order and with which speed
 ve chahen to ek maheene ke liye die gaye kaam ko das din main puraa kar sakate hai
 But they cannot take the next month's work as soon as they finish the work
 ve shesh bache hue samay main pustkaalay se manachaahi pustak kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai
 When students take the contract for monthly work, they also promise that we will neither help anyone nor we will take help from others to complete this work
 chaatro ko itani chhot avashya rahati he ki ve apane guru yaa apane sahpaathiyon se sanmati len kintu kaary unhen swat: hi puraa karnaa padataa he
 Classes disappear in this scheme and each classroom becomes a laboratory
 in vibhinn prayogshaalaon main un un vishyon ke sab sahaayak padaarth pustak, chitra, rekhachitr, pratimurti, yantra aadi vidyaman rahete hai
 Students of different categories who want to complete the work of a single subject can all sit in the classroom lab of that subject and use the material to complete their work
 is prakaar vidhyalay main pehali, duusari, teesri kaksha na hokar hindi kii prayogshaala, ganit kii prayogshaala, itihaas kii prayogshaala tathaa bhugol, vigyaan, sangeet, chitrakala aadi vishyon kii prayogshalas ban jaati hai
 That is why there are neither hours nor any timed schedule or routine
 is yojana ke antargat adhyapakon kaa kaam yah he ki Time is not wasted
 yadi itihaas kaa adhyaaapak shivaji par lekh likhnaa chahta he to vah is kaam ko bhashashikshak kii kaaryayojna main daal saktaa he jiskaa aitihaasik ansh itihaas kaa adhyaaapak dekh le or bhashaa kaa ansh bhashaa kaa adhyaaapak
 With this, the student also avoids the difficulty of writing two essays
 is yojana main adhyaaapak ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah vidhyaarthee ke kaam main baadha de, yah chaatr kaa hi adhikaar he ki vah aavashyaktaa padane par adhyaaapak se sanmati or paraamarsh le
 The ten months annual contract work plan is prepared for the students

 itihaas, bhugol, vigyaan tathaa arthshaastra jaise vishyon main samasyaayen adhik hoti hai jinke liye chaatr ko vishesh adhyayan karke apni ore se parinaam nikaalnaa hota he
 Written work - Complete list of writing work should be given and the date on which the article is to be taken should be clearly mentioned

 Conference - Action plan should also mention the dates when the whole class has to sit together and discuss the subject or explain something special
 sahaayak pustaken - kaaryayojna ke saath un pustakon tathaa patrapatrikaon ke naam, unke adhyay tathaa prishth bhi de die jaaen jinase sahaayta lenaa aavashyak ho
 Progress statement - The children should also be told how to account for their progress so that they can remain confident and they understand that we have gained so much knowledge, so much work, so much progress
 iske liye kaksha main bhi pragatipatt rahata he or chaatr ke paas bhi, jisamen vah apane kiye hue kaam kii pragati kaa ankan karata chalata he
 Study of the notice board - If there is a plan to hang a picture, map or article etc
 on the notice board of the laboratory, then it should also be mentioned
 vibhageeya chhot - masik kaaryayojna banaate samay adhyapakon ko paraspar milakar is prakaar se kaaryavibhaajan karnaa chahie ki ek hi prakaar ke kaary kii aavriti na ho or chaatr par anaavashyak bhaar na pade
 The comprehensive and practical form of this scheme has started in the name of the subject scheme, according to which the whole plan is made in monthly order to teach a subject throughout the year, by taking care of the classrooms of the existing schools

 vargamul nikaalane kii ek prachlit vidhi nimnlikhit sarvasamika par aadhaarit he- Aryabhata expresses his method of extracting square root by the following verses- written in the line of the square root)
 This is the square root
 Most methods of deriving the square root of positive numbers s begin with an approximate value of the square root that is progressively made pure
 yadi yah aarmabhik maan, vargamul ke shuddh maan se bahut dur hoga to gananaa karne main adhik charan lagenge
 Therefore it is very useful to approximate the square root
 mana purnank s ≥ 1, tathaa isamen ankon kii sankhya d he
 so mana 234 kaa vargamul nikaalnaa he
 Here d = 3 and n = 1
 Hence, the value of square root of 234 = s ≈ 2 ⋅ 10 2

 Onondog people were "fire-holders" whose responsibility was to present issues for discussion and they used to sit on one side of the three-direction fire

 From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century, the population of Native Americans declined as follows: due to infectious epidemics from Europe; Due to mutual massacres and wars occurring at the hands of European explorers and colonists, as well as between tribes; Due to displacement from their lands; Internal battles, due to slavery; And due to a high rate of intermarriage
 Most mainstream scholars believe that of the various factors that contribute, infectious epidemics are the biggest cause of population decline of Native Americans because these natives did not have sufficient immunity against new diseases brought from Europe
