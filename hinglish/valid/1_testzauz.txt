 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea
 apni bhinn bhugolic or mausami paristhitiyon ke kaaran alag mahadwipon main band jalsambharon kii sankhya bhi bhinn he
 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia

 Without Gandhiji's unified personality, the Indian National Congress began to split into two parties during his two years in prison, one party led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, who favored the party's participation in the House
 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

 In December 1928, Gandhiji made a motion in a session of the Congress held in Calcutta asking him to give power to the Indian Empire or face the non-cooperation Movement for the independence of the entire country as his motive for not doing so

 After this, Gandhiji launched a new Satyagraha in protest against the taxation of salt in March 1930, which was a 400 km journey from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to commemorate the salt movement from 12 March to 6 April to produce salt on its own

 It was signed in March 1931 by the Treaty of Irwin Gandhi
 savinay avagya andolan ko band karne ke liye british sarkaar ne sabhi rajnatik kaidiyon ko reeha karne ke liye apni rajamandi de di
 As a result of this agreement, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference to be held in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress

 In addition, Lord Willington, the successor of Lord Irwin, began a new campaign to control and crush the movement of nationalists

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader

 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled

 Like other temples before independence, there was complete ban on entry of Harijans in this temple too

 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr
 Kelappan Fasting can be done in favor of is kaaran guruvayur mandir ke trusteo kii ore se baithak bulaakar mandir ke upasko kii raay bhi praapt kii gayi
 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai
 With the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi, the first day of January was celebrated as the determination day and the decision made was received
 
 In the summer of 1934, three unsuccessful attempts were made to kill him

 He did not disagree with the party's move but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with the Indians would facilitate the strengthening of the party's membership which has hitherto belonged to communists, socialists, trade associations, students, religious leaders
 Laker existed between trade unions and various voices

 Gandhi, while leading a party for Raj, did not want to prove any goal by campaigning which would be accepted as a political arrangement with Raj temporarily
 gandhi ji nehru presidensi or congress ke lahore adhiveshan ke saath hi 1936 main bharat laut aae
 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future
 usne congress ko samaajwaad ko apane uddeshy ke rup main apnaane se nahin roka
 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest

 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy
 unhone sabhi congressiyon or bharatiyon ko ahimsa ke saath karo yaa maro ke dwaara antim swatantrata ke liye anushaasan banaae rakhane ko kaha
 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life
 unka 50 saal purana sachiv mahadev desai 6 din baad hi dil kaa daura padane se mar gaye or gandhi ji ke 18 maheene jail main rahane ke baad 22 farvari 1944 ko unki patni kasturba gandhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria
 unke kharaab swasthya or jaruri upachaar ke kaaran 6 may 1944 ko yuddh kii samaapti se purv hi unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Raj did not want to see him dying in jail which would increase the anger of the country
 haalanki bharat chodo andolan ko apane uddeshy main ashink safalataa hi mili lekin andolan ke nishthur daman ne 1943 ke ant tak bharat ko sangathit kar diya
 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest
 majboor gandhi ne apni anumati de di
 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya
 The leaders of Hindu Muslim and Sikh community assured them that they would forget peace and bring peace

 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 To reflect their ordinary life he later wore a dhoti for the rest of his life gandhi kaa janm hindu dharm main hua, unke puure jivan main adhiktar siddhanton kii utpati hindutv se hua
