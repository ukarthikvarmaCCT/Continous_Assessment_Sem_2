 Two years after the Battle of Sokovia, Thor has failed to find the Infinity Stones, and is now imprisoned by the fire-demon Sartar in Mospelheim
 saratar thor ko bataata he ki thor ke pita odin ab asguard par nahin hai, or jaise hi saratar odin ke kaksh main jalati hui anant lau main apana mukut giraayegaa, regnarok dwaara vah kshetra turant hi nasht ho jayega
 Thor defeats Sartar and retains his crown, and assumes that he has stopped Ragnarock forever
 iske baad thor asguard laut aata he, jahaan uskaa bhai loki odin ke rup main rah rahaa hota he
 Thor forces Loki to help him in Odin's quest, and with Stephen Strange's directions on Earth, he finds Odin in Norway
 odin unhen bataate hai ki vah mar rahe hai, or unke marate hi unki pehali santan, hela unki jail se chhot jaaegi, jahaan vah bahut pehle sil kar di gai thi
 Hela was Esgard's commander in chief, and had conquered nine territories with Odin, but Odin feared that his ambitions had begun to dominate his good, so they imprisoned him and wiped him out of history forever
 kuch samay baad odin kii mrityu ho jaati he, or hela karawas se mukt hokar un donon ke saamne prakat hui
 He destroys Thor's hammer, Mylonir, and when Thor and Loki attempt to escape through the Biafrost Bridge, Hela chases them and throws them into space to die
 hela asguard main pahunchi, or vahaan jaakar usne asguard kii sena ko nasht kar diya or varirs thri kii hatya kar di
 He then revived the ancient dead warriors, including his giant wolf Fenris, and appointed the Asgardian Skurge as his executioner
 hela asguard ke samrajya kaa vistaar karne ke liye bifrost kaa upyog karne kii yojana bana rahi thi, lekin hemdal ne bifrost pul ko niyantrit karne vaali talwaar chura lee, or asguard ke baaki nagarikon ke saath chhip gaya
 Thor fell to Sakar, a planet of garbage surrounded by a wormhole
 daason kii ek vyapaaree, scraper 142 ne obediens discs kii sahaayta se thor ko apane niyantran main kar liya, or use sakaar ke shaasha, grandmaster ko ek gladator ke rup main bech diya, jiske saath loki pehle hi mitra ban chukaa tha
 Thor identified 142 as a Valkyrie, who at one time was a member of a great army of female warriors on Esgard, and all his companions were killed while protecting Esgard from Hela
 thor ko grandmaster ne apni kantest of champions pratiyogita main bhaag lene ke liye majaboor kiya, jahaan uskaa saamana apane puraane dost halk se hua
 Using his electric power in this competition, as the Thor began to overwhelm the Hulk, the Grandmaster tricked him into unconsciousness, winning the Hulk
 gulam rahete hue hi thor ne halk or 142 ko asguard ko bachaane main uski madad karne ke liye manaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin donon main se koi taiyaar nahin hua
 As soon as he had the chance, Thor escaped from the palace, and arrived at the quinjet that had brought the Hulk to Sakar
 halk bhi thor kaa peechha karte hue quinjet main pahunchaa, jahaan natasha romanoff kii ek recording sunakar vah sokovia ke baad pehali baar bruce binar main waapas badal gaya
 The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but Loki reminds 142 of his previous battles as Valkyrie
 thor kii madad karne kaa faisla karte hue 142 apni sadbhaavna sabit karne ke liye loki ko kaid kar leti he
 Fearful of being left behind alone, Loki tells the group to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships
 phir ve log anya gladiestaron ko mukt karte hai, jo ki corg or mik ke netritv main grandmaster ke viruddh ek kranti kaa elaan kar dete hai
 Loki attempts to betray his brother again to get a reward from the Grandmaster, but Thor realizes his tricks, leaving him behind, where Korg and the other gladiators soon find him
 thor, binar or 142 asguard ke ek warmhole se nikalakar asgard pahonchte hai, jahaan hela kii senaayen bifrost kii talwaar ke liye hemdoul or asguard ke nagarikon par hamalaa kar rahi hoti hai
 Banner again transforms into the Hulk, and defeats Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle the resurrected warriors led by Skurge
 loki or anya gladator unki madad karne ke liye aate hai, or asguard ke nagarikon ko apane jahaaj par aashray dete hai; apane karmon ke pashchaatap main skirj un nagarikon ko bachaane ke liye aane praanon kaa balidaan kar detaa he
 Thor and Hela face to face, in which Thor loses his right eye and then realizes in a vision of Odin that only Ragnarock can stop Hela
 jab hela 142 or thor se lard rahi hoti he, to loki saratar ke taj kaa pataa lagaakar or use anant lau main daal detaa he, or isse saratar punerjeevit hokar asguard ko nasht kar detaa he, or isamen hela kii bhi mrityu ho jaati he
 Thor and the others escape with the remaining citizens of Esgard aboard the Grandmaster's ship
 thor, jo ab odin kii mrityu ke baad asgard kaa raja he, apane logon ko prithvi par le jane kaa faisla karata he
 In the mid-credits scene, a large spaceship faces their ship
 post-credit drishy main, grandmaster apane purv shishyon ke ek samooh se mulaakaat karata he, jo abhi bhi vidroh kar rahe hai

 Islamic Philosophy: Arab philosophy, more properly called Muslim philosophy, appears in four main dimensions, evolving rapidly in the sphere of Greek philosophy: in vibhinn vichaar sampradaayon kaa sankshipt vivaran neeche prastut he : This idea was established by the end of the first century of the sect Hijri
 yah do mahan siddhanton -ishwariya ekatv tathaa ishwariya nyaay - par aadhrut tha
 Godly unity meant that God is one - the smell of dualism cannot be found in him
 usamen apane 'mulsatv' se pare koi anya gun nahin he
 His own essence targets all the virtues
 vah sarvajna evam sarvashaktiman he, kintu iskaa kaaran yah nahin he ki usamen apni satta yaa satv se pruthak sarvajyata yaa sarvashaktimata ke koi gun hai, balki iskaa kaaran yah he ki uskaa mulsatv hi in gunon ke naam se jaani janevaali visheshtaon ko apane main nihit karata he
 This view was propounded by Vasil bin 'ata, the originator of this sect, and Abdul Hudhail Allaf explained it clearly
 ishwariya nyaay kaa abhipraay yah he ki ishwar sadaiv nyaayi he or vah kabhi nirday nahin hota
 a subdivision of this belief holds that God has blessed man to a certain extent with freedom of desire and work
 manushya apane sabhi karmon ke liye uttaradaayi he, apane satkarmon ke liye vah puraskaar tathaa dushkarmon ke liye dand paata he
 The Mu'tazli people called themselves 'ahl Atta Tawheed Vall Adl' because they were strong supporters of God's justice and unity
 mu'tazliyon ke anya pramukh mat the, quran kii shashvatata se inkaar tathaa paralok main ishwar darshan kii asambhavyata
 The archivists believed that wisdom is a quality of God
 or vah quran main abhivyakt he
 Thus Quran is self-centered and is associated with the eternalness of God
 mu'tazli kehete hai ki yadi yah gyaan ishwar kii shashvatata se sambhddha he to iskaa arth do shaashvat satyon kaa astitv hua
 In other words, it validates the power of two gods
 puraatanapanthi yah maanate the ki kam se kam kuch logon ko swarg main ishwar kaa darshan hona sambhav he or yah param anand kaa vishay hoga
 mu'tazali said that God cannot be seen even in heaven, because it happens to be a preconception that in this expansion he also occupies some place
 lekin ishwar vistaarmay he hi nahin, at: use kabhi kahin bhi nahin dekha ja saktaa
 The mu'at-zalis started the sublimation of the orthodox rules of Islam with a good feeling, but the faith of many of them was inadvertently shaken in relation to the divine origin of the Quran
 parinamat: apni hi tarkpaddati ko lekar ve majahab ke anek rudh niyamon ko na maanane ke liye vivash ho gaye, yatha ilham kaa siddhant, ityadi
 The first group of Mu'tazli thinkers were conscious of their religion and wanted to sublimate them to associate with the human conscience
 mu'tazaliyon ke sampradaay kaa udgam bahari prabhaav se achoote rahakar hua tha
 
 kintu jab greek darshan anudit hokar aayaa to mu'tazaliyon ne use bade hausale ke saath padhaa
 The study of Greek philosophy created new problems in his mind and his interest in religion was automatically pushed back for his own sake
 mutazliyon main kuch pramukh the, najjam jubba' i, jaahiz ityadi
 Ash'arism is a reactionary movement against Mut'zlism
 abdul hasan al-ash'ari iske sansthaapak the 
 He was born in Basra in 260 or 270 Hijri and was trained in Mu'tazli camp
 40 saal kii avasthaa tak ye mu'tazlwaadi the
 It is said about him that he had visions of the Prophet in his dream, in which he encouraged him to follow the rules of Quran and Hadith
 unhone aisa karne kii pratigya kii tathaa apni shakti bhar mu'tazliyon se sangharsh karne kaa nishchay kiya
 In public debate, he debated and defeated his mentor, Jubba'i
 inhone i'tishaal ke khandan main sau se adhik pustaken likhin
 They denied any knowledge in relation to divine things that held its independent power from Ilham
 unki manyata thi ki dharmavigyaan kii imaarat vishuddh buddhivaadee aadhaar par nahin khadi kii ja sakati
 They rejected Mu'tazli's view that God is nirgun
 unka yah vishwaas tha ki ishwar vividh gunon se sampann he, yatha gyaan, ichha, samarthy ityadi; kintu ye sabhi manushyon main paae janevaale gunon ke arth main nahin samajhe ja sakate
 In relation to the Quran, he was of the opinion that it is the eternal voice of God
 ichha yaa sankalp kii swatantraaa ke sambandh main unki sthapana thi ki manushya kisi vastu kaa sarjan nahin kar saktaa
 God is the only creator or creator
 ishwar manushya main chunaav evam shakti ke jaateey gunon ko paidaa kar detaa he, tatpashchaat un kaaryakalapon kii sristi karata he jinka talmail chunaav evam shakti ke saath baithta he
 Motivator is only God
 jo baat manushya kii shakti main nihit he, vah he maatr 'kasb' jiskaa arth yahi he ki manushya ke kaary uske chunaav evam shakti ke un gunon ke anuroop hai jinhen ishwar ne usamen pehle se hi paidaa kar rakhaa he
 Man is the goal point of God's actions
 mu'tazliyon kii sthapana thi ki ishwar nyaayi hone ke kaaran apane praaniyon kaa anisht kar hi nahin saktaa
 God has given man freedom of action
 at: ishwar nahin balki swany manushya achche evam bure krityon kaa nirmaataa he
 Proving this view to be wrong, al-ash'ari posited that God is not bounded by any limits
 vah apane icchaanusaar apane kisi bhi praani kaa hit yaa ahit kar saktaa he
 His view that God could be interviewed in the hereafter was that it is impossible from a physical point of view, because it relates to location and direction, yet his vision can be done without the help of physical eyes
 jaisaa di0 bi0 macdonal kehete hai, 'al-ashari kii mahan moulik buddhi ne tatvashastreey dharmavigyaan kii ek shaktishaalee pranali kii neenv daali tathaa 'paandityavaadee kalam' kii vaigyanik buniyaad ke liye aadharshila rakhi
 ' sufiwaad is baat kii shiksha detaa he ki ham apane ant:karan ko kaise pavitra banaaen, apana naitik dharaatal kaise drudh karen tathaa apane aantarik evam bahya jivan kaa kaise nirmaan karen ki shaashvat anand kii uplabdhi ho sake
 The purification of the soul is its subject matter, and its culmination and goal is the attainment of eternal bliss and supreme grace
 Sufis acknowledge that all the acts of their sacred knot by God on their bandits and all the duties suggested by the Prophet are such necessary contracts
 In whose bonding it is necessary to tie up all the adults and adult brain
 is arth main sufiwaad ek vishuddh islamic anushaasan he jo muslimon ke aantarik jivan tathaa charitra kaa nirmaan aise kartavyon evam adhiniyamon, anubandhon evam anivaarytaaon ke jariye karata he jinhen koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi tarah se nahin chhod saktaa
 But Sufism does not have the same meaning in Islam
 iskaa ek rahasyamay abhipraay he
 In the mystic sense of the world, Sufi is the one who is aware of the true relationship between God and himself
 is prakaar sufi yah jaanata he ki vah aantarik rup se ishwar ke man main sthit ek vichaar he
 Being an idea is eternal along with God
 bahya rup se vah ek srujit praani he jiske rup main ishwar swayan sufi kii kaaryakshmata ke anusaar apane ko prakat karata he
 He neither possesses an independent personal existence nor possesses any authoritative quality
 ishwar kii satta se uski satta he, vah ishwar ke hi dwaara dekhtaa he, ishwar ke hi dwaara sunata he
 This intention is confirmed by this text of the Quran: 'he is the first and the last, he is the external and the inward and he knows everything'
 is aayat kaa vishleshan karte hue paigambar ne kaha : 'tum bahya ho or tumse upar kuch bhi nahin; tum abhyantar ho or tumse neeche kuch bhi nahin; tum pratham ho or tumse purv kuch bhi nahin; tum antim ho or tumhaare baad kuch bhi nahin he

 No department of knowledge field could survive the test of their alert intelligence

 Al Farabi: Farabi, the greatest philosopher of Islam and the new Platoist, is considered the best analyst of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle
 evn khallikan ke shabdon main, 'koi bhi muslim darshanik-vigyaanon ke kshetra main al farbi kii koti tak nahin pahunchaa he; unki kritiyon kaa adhyayan tathaa unki style kaa anukaran karke hi avicina ne aisi suvijyata praapt kii tathaa swat: apni hi kritiyon kaa upadey banaaya
 He understood Aristotle so thoroughly and inaugurated the mysteries of Greek philosophy so widely that he was called 'the second master' by the Muslims, because the first master was Aristotle himself
 arestu ke prati unke saare josh ke baavjood unhen utpatti vishyak navy platowadi manyataon kaa bhi chaska tha
 He believed that this world, originating from God, came down in an unfavorable way
 al farbi kii tarkshastra kii pustakon ke bare main apni anushansa likhte hue sabase mahan yahudee darshanik mabhonidis ne ye shabd kahe
 'I will allow you to read the works of the philosopher Abu Nasser al-faravi by not asking you to read any other book related to logic
 al farbi kaa kahana he ki 'saamaanya satyon kaa nigaman vishesh satyon ke pratishthit ho jane ke baad hi sambhav he, tathaa bhavatmak gyaan andriya anubhavon dwaara praapt gyaan kii hi parinti ke rup main ho saktaa he
 As far as the theory of intelligence is concerned, Al Farabi follows his predecessor al-kindi and discusses four types of intelligence, viz
, Latent or latent intelligence, functional intelligence, acquired intelligence and medium knowledge al farbi kaaranta ke siddhant kii vistrut vyakhya apane 'gyaan-ratna' naamak prabandh main karte hai
 Like Aristotle, he also believes that the chain of causes is not infinite, the infinity of origins is impossible

 His philosophy was the adoption of Aristotle's doctrines, with a slight effect of New Platoism

 According to Ibn Sina, the goal of logic is to present people with certain criteria on the basis of which they can avoid being misled in their arguments
 tarkshastra vishyak apane prabandh ko ve nau bhaagon main baantate hai jo arestu ke arabi sanskaranwale granth se samya rakhata he
 This book also contains verses and poetry
 ebn sina is baat par jor detaa he ki gambhir tark sadaiv kisi baat kii thik thik paribhaasha karne par nirbhar rahata he
 The definition should explain the properties of the object, its basic race, its disruptive religion and its specific characteristics; Thus, it is completely separate from the description of Kore
 saamaanya evam visheshon kii charchaa karte hue ibj sina bataate hai ki saamaanya kaa astitv keval manushya ke man main hi rahata he
 It is a kind of abstract suffix that remains only in the form of mental perception and has no objective reality
 saamaanya bodh kii nishpatti vishesh athwa vyakti tak usee bhanti hoti he jaise vyakti kii sristi ke purv srishtikarta ke man main vah ek saamaanya pratyay ke rup main tha
 There is a sense of generality in substances only when it is associated with specific properties

 Apart from the abilities of vegetation, there are other things in the soul of animals

 Their number is eight which can be called sense knowledge, sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell, strength and perception of cold-temperature, dryness-humidity-perception, perception of soft hard barriers and sensibility of vulnerability
 ye saare bodh milakar bahm padaarth ke swaroop kaa pariklpanaatmak gyaan bodhakarta kii aatma ko karaate hai
 The inner powers of sense perception are as follows: al mussabira, al muffakira, al vahm, al hafijaa athwa al zakira 
 Humans and animals understand the specials through the senses, human beings do the knowledge of the common through wisdom power
 manushya kii bauddhik aatma athwa 'aggal' ko shaareerik shaktiyon se pruthak apni nij kii shaktiyon kaa gyaan rahata he

 No power is infinite, they can be increased or decreased and the results are always infinite
 yadhyapi kaal yaa samay swayan gati nahin he, tathaapi vah nakshatron kii gati ke sahare janaa evam mapa ja saktaa he
 Following al-kindi, Ibn Sina presents the definition of place as 'that it is the boundary of the transfusion that passes through the hold or embankment', and what we call void is just a name and an unlikely object
 ebn sina ishwar ko hi 'aavashyak satta' tathaa paramtatv maanata he
 The substances which are studied in physical sciences are only possible 'objects'
 puure anant main ek maatr ishwar hi aavashyak rup se astitvavan rahata he
 The purpose of philosophy is to know God and be as similar as possible

 He does not see in philosophical methods the theory of the immortality of a person and the belief in the foreknowledge and preconception of God, by which it is believed that God already knows small things of life and can already see them and May interfere with them at any time
 al gzali kii pustak ke prabhaav ke prakaashan ne darshanikon kaa munh band kar diya
 Arabic philosophy nevertheless maintained its existence and Spain expanded into the Moore Caliphate system

 Extinct Banjara folk culture lok samskruti ko log saadharantaya ‘gramin samskruti’ kaa paryaay maan lete hai, jabaki yah un sabhi logon kii samskruti he jo kisi samudaay kaa hissaa he, jinaki kuch paramparaayen tathaa manyataayen hai
 Folk culture changes over time
 jis tarah lokgeeton main kabhi tehraav nahin aata, vah jiske kanth se footte he usee ke ho jate he, thik usee tarah lok samskruti main baraabar kuch-na-kuch judata or ghatata rahata he
 But even after all this addition and subtraction, its original fragrance remains as it is
 dow
hajaari prasad dvivedi ke anusaar “lok shabd kaa arth janapad yaa graamy nahin he, balki nagaron or gaanvon main faili hui vah samoochee janata he, jiske vyaavhaarik gyaan kaa aadhaar pothiyaan nahin he
 "1 Vidyanivas are opposed to taking Mishra Lok in this sense
" Lok "has an etymological meaning" Everything which is visible, perceptible, is visible, in front of it, that is a sense of contemporary and direct subjectivity
 
 fok kii avdhaaran jaise pashchim main ban gai he
 It is of such a nature that what is left behind, that is Gavaru, which is accepted as the oral tradition of illiterate people, is fok but not limited to the folk man community, it is very wide
 samast jivan jo saamne failaa hua he,yaa sancharanshilaya sathavar he vah sab lok he
 "2 banjaaraa samaaj kaa mul lagbhag sabhi itihaaskaaron ne rajasthan ko hi mana he
 Banjara Samaj It is known by many names in each province of India
 jaise maharashtra main banjaaraa, karnataka main lamaani, andhra main lambaada, punjab main baazeegar, uttar pradesh main nayak samaaj or bahari duniya main raani naam se jane jate he
 There are many views of scholars regarding the etymology of the word Banjara
 bharat kii sabase sabhy or pracheen samskruti sindhu samskruti ko mana jaataa he
 gor-banjara culture is associated with this culture
 is samaaj kaa alag-alag bhaagon main vibhinn naamon se janaa jaataa he
 But the people of Banjara society are known as 'gore' and 'gormati' in every province
 banjaaraa vah vyakti he, jo belon par anaaj ladakar bechney ke liye ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko jaataa he
 The same person is called 'banjara'
 anadi kaal se yah samaaj vyapaar karata tha
 Since then, this caste has been referred to as 'commercialist'
 ‘vaanijya’ yah shabd sanskrit kaa he
 The word commerce is called 'banaj' in Hindi and the word Banjara is derived from 'banaj'
 ‘banjaara’ ko ‘gore’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 The word 'banjara' is used as a symbol of living a free life
 – With reference to the etymology of the word Banjara, Dr
 Grierson establishes the association of the word Banjara with Sanskrit commerce - "commerce-commercial-commerce-commercials-banjara" is said to be a business indicator, not a word indicator
 ”4banjaaraa shabd ke sandarbh main samajashastri rasel tathaa heeralaal kaa mat he ki-“rajasthan ke mul nivasee ‘gore’ yaa chaaran log madhyakaalin bharat main banjaaraa naam se prakhyat hue
 "5 uparokt loakgeet me ‘nagari’ yah shabd mahatvapurn he
 The meaning of the city is 'harappa Nagar'
 banjaaraa samaaj koi bhi shubh kaary karne se pehle bhagwaan se prarthana kii jaati he- According to the above prayer, the creation of the Banjara society, the campus of Saraswati is the original settlement place of Banjara culture, living in the period of Harappa culture, which flourished in the hilly region of Ganga Saraswati
 banjaaraa samaaj main naariyon ko bhi ‘harpali’ kaha jaataa he
 Meaning of 'harpari' in Banjara dialect- habdappa hai
 is sandarbh main yah geet dikhaai detaa he
 - banjaaraa samskruti main zyaadaatar log gaay-belon kaa hi vyapaar karte the
 Because of which Banjara society is also called 'gore society'
 hadappa samskruti ke log bhi kheti, vyapaar karte the
 It is clear from this that the Banjara caste belonged to the era of Indus culture and Hadappa culture
 sindhu samskruti kii bahut sari manyataayen banjaaraa samskruti main dikhaai detii hai
 Earth, Shing, Taurus, animal husbandry, Lingapuja were given importance in Indus culture
 usee prakaar se banjaaraa samskruti main ‘suraj’ or ‘agni’ kii puja karte he
 It is clear from this that the word Banjara is used to refer to the nomadic caste and for the concept of this caste, it is the language and culture due to it being a nomadic caste by the deeds, trade and other societal deeds performed by the sections of that caste
 i have a social standing
 yah bhi is jati ke sandarbh main sarv sweekaar yah he, ki isaki vyapti sarv deshiy he
 It is known from the history that the Banjara people were already of merchant instinct and had met the merchant community of Rajasthan
 rajasthan, malwa, gujarat aadi pradesh rajput rajwanshon ke hi the
 Trade was rampant in these regions
 is pradesh ke vyapaaree log des-videsh main maal lekar vyapaar kiya karte the
 The Gujjars, Marwadis and Banjaras had gained more fame among the merchants of Rajasthan
 jivan-yaapan kaa ekmaatr saadhan vyapaar hone ke kaaran inaki aarthik sthiti acchhee rahi
 But the war of Akbar and Rana Pratap adversely affected their economic situation
 yah rana pratap ke anuyaayi the
 Banjaras faced many plagues with Rana Pratap
 mughalon ke akand-tandav se uubakar tathaa jivan-yaapan karne ke liye yah log mughal phujon ko rasad tathaa yuddh saamagree pahunchane kaa kaam karne lage
 Around 1630 AD, these Banjaras reached south with Mughal forces to attack Adilshah of Bijapur under the leadership of Shah Jahan and later settled in the same
 vyapaar “banjaras have different businesses
 pracheen kaal main banjaare vaanijyakaar yaa vyapaaree ke rup main khaadya-padaarth or anya samagriyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchane kaa kaary samuhik rup se kiya karte the
 It was not possible for the Banjaras to return to their original place after traveling far and wide in all the four directions of the country
 unkeliye sheet or greeshm donon rituen kshtkaarak hoti hai
 Banjara men and women used bulls, bullock carts, camels and horses for their trade
 Banjaras used to go collectively for any purpose
 ”9 banjaaraa samudaay hameshaa utpeedan kaa shikaar hota rahaa he chaahe samantshahi vyavastha se yaa angrejon ye yaa phir aazaadee ke baad sarkari niti se
 Earlier, the main occupation of the Banjara society was of salt
 aazaadee kii ladaai main banjaaron ke yogadan ko hameshaa hi kamatar aanka gaya he
 Being a nomad, they were highly reliable means of sharing information
 baad main angrejon ne banjaaraa sanudaay ko aarthik rup se kamjor karne ke liye 31 disambar 1859 ko ‘namak kar vidheyak’ thope diya
 The Banjara community protested against it
 gandhi ji ke saath 1930 main unhone virodhswaroop dandi march bhi kiya
 Due to this decision of the British, the salt merchant banjars were broken
 aakhirkaar unhen apana paitruk namak kaa vyavsaay badalanaa padaa
 Since then, the Banjara societies live up to the present day doing small jobs
 banjaaraa samaaj kii mahila-purush gond, sindha namak, mitti multani, mehandi,lohe se bane aujaar jaise saamaan bechney ko majaboor hue
 Many had to move to cities
 veshbhusha evam aabhushan Every caste has its own cultural system, behind that cultural system, the ancient history of that caste is hidden
 isliye jati ko anya se pruthak pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The cultural system of the Banjara caste is ancient and traditional
 inamen inaki veshbhusha paddati, aahaar paddati tathaa hastkalaon kaa samavesh hota he
 Banjara society has a distinct identity throughout India because of its dress
 banjaaraa jati kii veshbhusha rajasthan kii veshbhusha ke bahut najadik pai jaati he
 Generally Banjara men tie a turban on the head
 kameez yaa jhabba pahante hai
 Dhoti is tied
 haath main narmukhi kadaa, kaanon main murakiya va jhele pahante hai
 Mostly they carry sticks in their hands
 banjaaraa samaaj kii mahilaayein baalo kii faliyaan gunth kar unhen dhaagon main pirokar chotii se baandh detii hai
 Women wear a dohra, a symbol of euphoria around the neck
 haathon main chuda, naak main nath, kaan main chaandi ke ognya, gale main khangala, pairon main kadiya, nebariyaan, lagand, unguliyon main bichhiya, anguuthe main guchhla, qamar par karadhani yaa kandaura, haathon main bajuband, dodiya, haath-paan va anguuthiyaan pahenti hai
 Some women also wear ghagra and lehenga
 lugadi odhani odhati hai
 Older women wear Kanchali
 banjaaraa striyon ke aabhushan ke sambandh main dow
 shriram sharma ke anusaar-“banjaaran vastron kii bhaanti aabhushanon ke maamle main bhi vishesh ruchi rakhti hai
 Women of organized society wear most of the jewelery on special occasions, but Banjaran does not want to separate her ornaments from the body
 anya aadim jatiyon kii mahilaon kii tarah banjaaraa stri bhi kaudi, sip, duvanni chavanni aadi se apane aabhushanon taiyaar kara leti he
 " khan-paan Banjara's food is different from other societies
 kintu khaadya padaarthon main banjaaron kii ruchi or rajasthaniyon kii ruchi ek hi he
 Even today the Banjaras are not far from the interest of their ancestors
 bharat ke kisi bhi kone main vaas karne vaale banjaaraa logon kaa aahaar lagbhag ek hi prakaar kaa he
 Banjaras take vegetarian and non-vegetarian food
 banjaaraa vyakti tej tarraar saalan vyavhaar main khaataa dikhaayi detaa he
 There are two types of food of Banjare
 ek he samuhik khan-paan tathaa doosraa he vyaktigat khan-paan
 Group meals: This is done on auspicious occasion or during religious rituals
 shaakaahaari bhojan- banjaaraa jati kshatriya vansh ke hone ke kaaran un par hindu dharm kaa prabhaav saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 Like the food items that are made in Hinduism, the Banjara caste also produces food items
 banjaaraa jati yah mul rajasthan se hone ke naate in par rajasthani aahaar paddati kaa bhi asar padaa hua he
 But the Banjara caste is settled in different provinces being nomadic
 isliye is jati par us praant ke aahaar paddati kaa bhi prabhaav dekhne ko miltaa he
 Roti is the staple food of the Banjar caste
 banjaaraa boli main roti ko ‘baati’kaha jaataa he
 Baati It is made from jowar, millet and corn
 ‘rabadi’ bhi banjaaraa logon kii sabase pasand aahaar mana jaataa he
 'rabdi' This dish is made from buttermilk
 banjaaraa log iske atirikt dalia, khodi poli, galwali, laapasi, suwali bajre kii khichdi, aamara laal mirch kaa saalan aadi bade chaav se khate hai
 Masanahari - Banjara is basically a forest dweller and due to the tendency to hunt in them, most of the Banjara people are seen consuming meat
 aaj bhi inke dainik bhojan main hamen ek-do baar maance se ban khaadya padaarth rahete hai
 Except for meat, these people find the food incomplete
 mulat;paahadon tathaa jangalon main rahane vaale or shikaar karne kaa shauk rakhane vaale banjaaraa log bakrii, murga, khargosh, teetar, junglee suar, kekada, kucha, machhliyaan aadi praniyon kaa maance seven karte hai
 They take special pleasure in hunting and eating wild pigs
 suar kaa shikaar karne vaale aadmi ko banjaaraa boli main ‘suramamati’ kehete he
 Banjara people also observe the practice of sacrificing goat in the name of some gods and goddesses in every family due to the obscurity
 yah log bakre ke maance ke liye adhik dhan kharch karte hai
 Among them, alcohol along with meat is also highly consumed in the name of deities
 reeti-rivaaj The Banjara religions are Pippasu
 inke dharmik vishwaas paramparaagat hindu dharmik vishwaason se sambandhit hai
 The effect on religion, worship, fast, festivals, religious rites etc
 is visible
 dharmik taur par is samudaay ne ab tak kisi ek dharm ko sampoorn vidhi-vidhanpurvak lahin apanaaya he or manamaane tareeke se anek devi-devataaon ko maanate hai or manamaane tareeke se puja bhi karte hai
 Despite being Hindu, they have not adopted any one branch of Hinduism
 banjaaraa samudaay main prakruti evam agyaat ke prati bhay, vismay kii aadim bhaavana bhi vyaapt he, jiskaa bahya rup mantra-tantra, jaadu-tona aadi ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 Along with fire, water, forest land and new crops etc
 are also worshiped
 banjaaraa sabhi devi-devataaon ko maanate hai jaise- sevaalaal, humbhukya, mituthukya, ram, krishna, balaji, tuljabhavani, durgadevi, sheetladevi aadi inke devi-devtaa hai
 The Banjaras of Chhattisgarh worship the goddess 'banjara', who symbolizes the mother power of this caste
 nrity or loakgeet In India, we find traditions, folk art among many people
 ham dekhte he ki maanav jivan or kala kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 Humans resort to music to alleviate fatigue or to forget their sorrow when bored with their daily activities
 sangeet se tarotaaja hokar phir se apane kaamon main jute jaataa he
 Each community has its own traditional musical instruments which are sung on the occasions of dance and folk songs and festivals of religious deities like Holi, Deepawali, Dussehra etc
 banjaaraa samaaj nrity, sangeet, rangoli, kasheedakaari, godana or chitrakaari ke liye behad prasiddh maane jate hai
 Each Banjara community has a band of singers who are called as 'gavanya' or 'gwal' in the Banjara dialect
 inaki gaanevaalon kii toli main kam se kam chaar yaa paanch log hote hai
 Everyone dances together
 angik cheshtaaon dwaara hridaygat bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti karnaa nrity he
 The act of expressing the emotion, ie dance, is indicative of the natural tendency of the common people by mere gestures
 nrity kaa mul maanav ke anand bhav main he
 And at the same time, the culture of a country or caste is enshrined in folk dances due to the dance being independent
 thik isi tarah vivaah, tyohaar aadi ke sandarbh main banjaaraa striyaan naach-gaan karti he
 In Holi, all the Banjaras forget the malice and come to one place and enjoy Holi
 holi tyohaar main lengi geet gaate he
 like- diwaali tyohaar yah hindu dharm kaa mahatvapurn tyohaar he
 Similarly, the important festival of Banjaras is Holi
 banjaare holi or diwaali ko sagi bahane maanate he
 The Diwali of Banjara tribe is of two days
 is tyohaar main godhan kii puja kii jati he tathaa kunari ladkiyaan sabhi logon ko, pashuon ko aashirwad detii hai
 Banjare Diwali is called Kali Amavas or medicine
 diwaali ke din banjaare bakre kii bali dete hai
 This folk song in relation to Diwali and Holi- lok sahitya main banjaaraa lokgeeton kii parampara pracheen kaal se hi dekhne ko milti he
 There is a possibility of folk songs being prevalent even during the time of Adivana
 maanav ne jab se bhashaa bolnaa sikhi tab se lokgeeton kaa prachlan hua he
 The word Sampada of folklore continues to exist with language
 isliye banjaaraa lokgeeton kaa pravaah peedi-peedi se aaj tak chalaa rahaa he
 Folklore, with its ease, simplicity and intensity of sensation, fills the melody of the heart of the folklore
 uskaa rose-rose zankrut ho uthta he
 The folklore of social exchange illuminates like a torch here
 in geeton ko dharti ke geet kaha saktaa he
 Therefore these folk songs are associated with every karma of our life
 janta ke geet ‘jantsaar’ dhan ropane ke geet, vivaah ke geet, chhathi ke geet sawan ke geet, holi ke geet, diwali ke geet, vibhinn devi-devataaon ke geet aadi geet banjaaron ko apane purvajon se viraasat main mili hai
 Not only happiness and celebration in folk songs, but also many folk songs are found on the inconsistencies prevalent in Banjara society
 upsanhaar People of different religions, castes and religions reside all over India, one of which is the Banjara society, whose history is centuries old
 bharat main vartmaan main banjaaraa jati kii jansankhya lagbhag 6 karod ke aas-paas he
 It is home to a large number of Banjaras in Shahjahanpur, Bijnor, Pilibhit, Bareilly, Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Etawah, Moradabad, Muthra, Etah, Agra, and Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Mandla in Madhya Pradesh and Panchmahal, Kheda, Ahmedabad and Sarabarkantha regions of Uttar Pradesh
 See you in maharashtra, karnataka, andhrapradesh, tathaa rajasthan, aadi lagbhag sabhi praanton main pai jaati he
 This society, which lives in a different culture throughout its country, is known as its unique identity
 vaise bhartiya samvidhan anusaar banjaaraa samaaj ke vikaas ke liye prayek praanton main alag- alag kanoon banaaye gaye hai, jiske kaaran banjaaraa jati ko kisi praant ne use anusuchit janajati main, to kisi main use pichhadaa varg yaa vimukt jati kii suchi main rakhaa gaya he
 Due to lack of uniform law for the Banjara society in the country, this society has still not been able to connect with the mainstream of development
 iske kaaran banjaaraa jati ke log anek praanton apni roj-roti ke liye khanaabadosh banakar apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 Politically, this society has not been able to make its own identity
 vartmaan samay main bhi 6 karod ke aas-paas aabaadi hone par bhi, kisi bhi praant, jila va block str par is samaaj kaa pratinidhitiv nahin hone ke kaaran banjaaraa samaaj aaj bhi vikaas kii raah dekh rahaa he
 Now Banjara society cannot be deprived of their rights, because new consciousness is coming in Banjara society
 vah ab sangathit ho rahaa he
 Now the time has come that the Banjara caste will have to represent them in government and non-government, political organizations
 jisase sadiyon se pichde banjaaraa samaaj kaa rasta prabal ho
 Notwithstanding time if there is no concrete initiative from the society at the governance level
 banjaaraa samaaj ab apane adhikaron ke liye or adhik samay tak intjaar nahin karegaa

 Ghajni gets confused and fails to remember anything

 He also comes to know that Ghajni is Sanjay's target
 yadav use is baat kii bhi jaankaree detaa he ki sanjay ek janamana serial hatyara he
 Sunita gets two diaries and frees Yadav
 achaanak isi bich sanjay vahaan pahunch jaataa he; use uname se kisi kii yaad nahin aati he or vah unka peechha karata hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 Ultimately Yadav gets hit by a bus and Sunita barely escapes the freak Sanjay
 yah jaankaar ki gajani khatre main he, vah use suchit kar detii hai ki yah sanjay hi he jo uski jaan ke peeche padaa hua he
 Targeting this name, Ghazni arrives at Sanjay's flat with the intention of killing him

 She protects those girls and saves them
 lekin ladkiyaan giroh ke sargana ke rup main gajani kaa naam letin hai

 gajani or uske gunde tod-phod karte hue kalpana ke apartment main ghus jate hai or uske laut aane kii pratiksha karte he jabaki kalpana andar hi mil jaati he
 Coincidentally, Sanjay reached there to meet Kalpana
 kalpana kaa antim uccharit shabd tha "gajani "
 gundon ne kalpana par hamalaa kar diya
 Sanjay was about to intervene when suddenly Ghazni struck his head with an iron rod
 sanjay kii aankhon ke saamne antim drishy kaundh jaataa he, ki gajani ke lohe kii chad ke krur prahaar se hi kalpana kii hatya hui thi
 Sunita now realizes the truth about the shock, she meets Sanjay and tells him what the truth is
 gusse se bekaabu hokar vah ji-jaan se gajani kaa peechha karata he
 Upon reaching Ghazni's den in Mumbai, Sanjay brutally kills all the Ghazni's retainers one by one in a planned manner and falls behind Ghajni
 durdamy dhang se khadedta hua vah uske paas pahunch kar ladaai main bhid jaataa he
 He wants to kill Ghazni so that his memory cycle disappears again and he forgets the present
 gajani mudata he or chura bhonk detaa he
 While mocking Sanjay, he narrates the gruesome tale of how he murdered Kalpana, when suddenly Sanjay overcomes his power with the ultimate boil
 sanjay gajani ko thik usee tarah martha he jis tarah gajani ne kalpana kii hatya kii thi
 The film progresses to its end, with Sanjay still working as a volunteer in an orphanage suffering from a memory loss

 Soil erosion does not occur due to dense leaves on the ground

 In addition, the useful bacteria that find shelter in the roots of grasses increase the fertility of the soil by accumulating nitrogen from there and the soil structure is greatly enhanced by their roots

 One of his songs hit Siddharth's ear - 'don't let Veena's strings loose
 dhilaa chhod dene se unka surila swar nahin nikalegaa
 But don't tighten the wires so much that they break
 ’ baat siddharth ko janch gai
 He agreed that yoga is proved only by regular dieting
