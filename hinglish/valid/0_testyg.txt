 Only one system is fully compliant and qualified as a single Unix specification "unix" open samooh ke farmaan se, shabd "unics" ek varg ko sandarbhit karata he na kii ek parichaalan tantra ke vishisht karyanvayan ko, vah parichaalan tantra jo open samooh ke ekal unics vishisht ko puraa karne ke liye unics 98 yaa unics 03 trademark sahan karne ke yogya hoti hai, jiske baad parichaalan tantra kaa vikreta open samooh ko ek shulk detaa he

 The Open Group requests that "unix" is always used as an adjective, following a common term, such as "system", to help avoid the creation of a generic trademark
 "unics" mul swarupan tha, lekin iskaa upyog: "UNIX" vyapak rahata hai kyonki denis richi ke anusaar jab american association of komputing mashinari ke tisare parichaalan tantra sangoshtee ko mul unics paper prastut karte hai,"hamaare paas ek nae prakaar ke akshar baithanevaala tha or troph kaa abhi abhi avishkaar hua tha or ham chote caps ke utpaadan main sakasham hone ke nashe main dhutt the"

 isaki kathavstu is prakaar he- King Lear was the king of England in ancient times
 vah swabhaav se krodhi evam vivekarahit tha
 Due to old age, he wanted to lead a worry free life by giving his kingdom to his daughters
 atev apni teenon putriyon- goneril, reagan or kardelia - ko bulaayaa or unase poocha ki ve use kitna pyaar karti hai
 Goneril was married to Duke of Albany and Reagan to Duke of Cornwall, and both Duke of Burgundy and the King of France were interested in a settlement with Cardillia
 goneril evam ragin ne pita ke prati apana aseem sneh khub badha chadhaakar prakat kiya, kintu kardelia ne ine-gine shabdon main kaha ki vah apane pita ko utana hi pyaar karti he jitna uchit he, na kam, na adhik
 Angered by this answer, King Lear divided his kingdom into equal parts in Goneril and Reagan by not giving Cardillia a third part
 goneril or reagan ne lier evam unke saathiyon tathaa unke sau saamanton ko baari-baari se apane saath rakhane kaa vachan diya
 Not receiving the share of the kingdom, Cardillia went out of the country with the King of France

 Global warming means the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and ocean temperatures since the 20th century and its approximate continuity

18 °C kii vruddhi hui he
 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of many gases, including some greenhouse gases
 inamen se adhikansh dharti ke upar ek prakaar se ek prakritik aavaran bana leti hai jo lautati kirnon ke ek hisse ko roak letaa he or is prakaar dharti ke vaataavaran ko garm banaae rakhata he
 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki greenhouse gaison main badhotaree hone par yah aavaran or bhi saghan yaa motaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change
 prithvi kii jalwaayu bahari dabaav ke chalate parivartit hoti rahati he jisamen surya ke chaaron ore iske apni kaksha main hone vaale parivartan bhi shaamil hai
 The pressure on the orbit also changes the concentration of solar flashes, volcanic eruptions, and atmospheric greenhouse gases
 vaigyanik aam sahmati hone ke baad bhi haal hi main hui garmi main vruddhi ke vistrut kaaran shodh kaa vishay hote hanyah he ki maanviya gatividhiyon ke kaaran vaataavaran kii greenhouse gaison main vruddhi se hone vaali adhikansh garmi ko audyogic yug kii shuruyaat ke baad se dekha gaya
 This credit goes to the most recent 50 years for which data are available
 aam sahmati ke vichaar se alag kuch anya sankalpanaaon kaa suzav adhikansh taapmaana vruddhi kii vyakhya karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces 36–70 percent greenhouse effect); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume
 bhavishya main CO2 kaa str zyada hone ki ashanka he kyunki jeevashm eendhan or bhoomi ke upyog main kaafii parivartan aa rahe hai vruddhi k dar anishchit aarthik, saamaajik, takneekee or prakritik ghatnaon par nirbhar karegi par shaayad aakhirkaar jeevashm eendhan kii uplabdhta hi nirnaayak sabit ho ipisisi kii utsarjan paridrishyon par vishesh report bhavishya ke kai CO2 paridrishyo ke bare main bataati he jo 2100 ke akhir tak 541 se lekar 970 pipiem tak ho sakate hai
 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100, if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect

 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate

 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0

 dharawahik ke liye dekhen- epa ai aar Information filed with the police for action in relation to an incident is called FIR or First Information Report
 pratham soochna report yaa exiaar ek likhit prapatr he jo bharat, pakistan, evam japan aadi kii police dwaara kisi sangyeya aparaadh kii soochna praapt hone par taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 This information is often filed as a complaint to the police by the victim of the crime
 kisi aparaadh ke bare main police ko koi bhi vyakti maukhik yaa likhit rup main suchit kar saktaa he
 The FIR is a document prepared by the police, in which the information of crime is described
 Generally, this is the first step necessary before the police can start crime related research
 bharat main kisi bhi vyakti dwaara shikaayat ke rup main praathmiki darj karaane kaa adhikaar he
 But many times the police do not register information given by ordinary people as FIR
 aise main praathmiki darj karaane ke liye kai vyaktiyon ko nyaayalay kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padaa he
 When a crime is reported to a police officer, it is called an FIR
 iskaa puraa rup he he- 'first informeshan report'
 You can go to the police regarding any type of crime
 In urgent and serious cases, it is mandatory for the police to register an FIR immediately and start research
 The police does the work of scripting the crime information
 praavdhaan he ki telephone se praapt soochna ko bhi exiar kii tarah samajha ja saktaa he
 The FIR process is completed under Section 154 of the Indian Penal Procedure Code 1973
 yah vah mahatvapurn suchanaatmak dastavej hota he jiske aadhaar par police kanoonee karrwai ko aage badhaati he
 The FIR is registered for cognizable offense
 sangyeya aparaadh ke bare main pratham soochna report koi bhi vyakti darj karvaa saktaa he
 Under this, the police has the right to arrest the accused person and investigate
 While the offense is not cognizable, action would not have been possible without the permission of the court
 haalanki police kii najar main di gayi jaankaree main agar jaanch-padtaal ke liye paryaapt aadhaar nahin banataa he, to vah karrwai ke liye baadhya nahin
 In this situation, the reason for not taking action is to be recorded in the log book, which also has to be given to the person in front
 police adhikari apni taraf se is report main koi tippanee nahin jod saktaa
 The person complaining has the right to read the report and give a copy of it
 is par shikayatakarta kaa hastakshar karana bhi anivaary he
 If the SHO refuses to file the information, it should be informed by meeting senior officials or by post
 aksar FIR darj karte vaqt aage ke kaarywahi ko saral banane hetu is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa hai ki ghatnasthal se sanlagn thane main hi isaki shikaayat darj ho parantu kai baar aise maukey aate hai jab peedit ko vipareet evam visham paristhitiyon main kisi bahari police thane main cese darj karne kii zarurat pad jaati hai
 But it is often seen that the policemen do not appear to be as serious about any incident outside their border
 Know that FIR is your right and also the details of inequalities happening towards you, so the government has made a provision of ZERO FIR to protect your rights even in such odd circumstances
 iske tahat peedit vyakti aparaadh ke sandarbh main avilamb kaarywahi hetu kisi bhi police thane main apni shikaayat darj karvaa sakate hai evam baad main cese ko uparokt thane main transafar bhi karavaaya ja saktaa hai

 After this, the court asked the company to make an advertisement stating the right facts
 The company, through its advocate Adam Ross, accepted that there is no 7 mg vitamin c in a 100 ml pack of ribena
 Finally, in its new advertisement, the company only claimed that blackcart contained 4 times more vitamin c than oranges
 shabdon ke her pher main lipt yah daawa bhi aadha sach or aadha mithyaa hi tha! On 14 June 2007, the head of the Cleveland Clinic's Cardiology Department wrote an article in the New England Journal of Medicine
 He said that research has made it clear that rosiglitazone, a substance sold as Avendia, can cause heart attacks
 usee samay ke aasapaas new yark times ne bhi nisen ke dawa companiyon ke kuch karmchaariyon ke saath hue vaartalap prakashit kiye
 glaxosmithkline had no knowledge of this, and the publication was legal in the province of Ohio because the laws there were sufficient for either party to be aware
 amareeki congress ab yah jaanch kar rahi he ki roziglitazone ko license dete samay tathaa baad main kya-kya jaankariyaan uplabdh thim, tathaa kya glaxosmithkline ne jaanboojh kar kuch mahatvapurn tathy chupaaye the

 Major institutions like Medicine Sans Frontières welcomed it openly, seeing that other institutions also came forward to welcome the move
 haalaanki medicine sans frontieres ne is baat par khed bhi jataayaa ki glaxosmithkline ne is nirnay main echhaivi sambandhi patenton tathaa madhya aay vaale rashtron ko shaamil nahin kiya
 The decision has received mixed reactions from charitable organizations in the medical field
 medicine sans frontieres jaisi pramukh sansthaaon ne iskaa khule dil se swaagat kiya, jise dekh kar anya sansthaaen bhi is kadam ke swaagat ko aage aayin
 However, he also regretted that glaxosmithkline did not include hiv-related patents and middle-income nations in the decision
