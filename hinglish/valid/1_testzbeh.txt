 [[shrenee:hindi santhaan}} Template: Grammatical categories Grammatical tense is a periodic linguistic quality that expresses the position or time of a verb by, during, or beyond the verb
 kaal bhav, awaz or pahalu ke saath, chaar gunon main se kam se kam ek he, jo abhivyakti spasht kar sakate hai
 Tenses reflect the contrast of occasional references to the development of an expression
 sabhi bhashaaen samaan kaal istemaal karti hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, haalanki hameshaa in kaalon kii abhivyakti kaa anuwaad spasht rup se ek bhashaa se duusari bhashaa main nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jabaki sabhi bhashaaon main kriya ke theth rup hote hai jiske dwaara ve shabdkoshon main pahachaane jate hai or krambaddh kiye jate hai, saadharantah sabase aam vartmaan kaal yaa ek saadhaaran rup, unke kaal abhivyakt karne ke tareekon kaa istemaal, bhashaaon ke bich bhinn he
 There are some languages in which tense is not interlinked through the verb form nor expressed structurally, but instead, whenever needed, the underlying adverb is intertwined with the use of adjectives and some contain topical information
 Appears by the use of intransitive adjectives
 kuch bhashaaon main pahalu or kaal par ek saath sanket karne ke liye ek ekal kriya antahkunchit kii ja sakati he
 The number of tenses in a language can be disputed, as the tense noun is often mistaken for displaying occasional expressions, extra facets and even expressions
 kai granthon main, kaal shabd galati se anischitata, aavruti, nishpatti, avadhi, sambhaavna kii gunvattta ko sanderbhit karata he or yahan tak ki ise bhi ki kya jaankaree anubhav se vyutpann hoti he yaa afvaah se 
 yah vastav main kaal nahin hai, lekin paramparaagat namapaddati aksar unka aise vargeekaran karti he
 In reality, all languages have the same tenses
 ye aam taur par teen samoohon main vibhajit hote hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, jisamen ek nirdhaarit abhipraay main prayek shrenee baddh hota he
 For example, past tenses are those in which the occasional reference to the component verb occurs before the occasional reference to the statement itself
 bhoot kaal, saamaanya ateet / bhoot se lekar tatkaal ateet / bhoot, sudur yaa dur sudur ateet / bhoot tak bhi shrenee baddh ho saktaa he, inke bich sirf ek hi antar hota he or vah he, samayik sandarbh binduon ke bich ghatnakram par duuri
 In English, tense is divided into two types of groups - pure tense and verb tense
 Pure tense refers to the manifestations of the present, past and future in which the secondary topical context is considered absolutely certain or known
 duusare shabdon main, shuddh kaal un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann sach mana yaa janaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, verb gesture refers to the manifestations of present, past, or future in which the certainty of attestation is not completely certain
 angrezi main yah rup ek kriyabhaav dyotak, kriyabhaav dyotak kahawat yaa kriyabhaav dyotak kriya-visheshan jodne se abhivyakt kiye jate hai
 The past tense is expressed only in English by subtracting the verb
 sabhi kachche or achook pahaluon main, bhoot kaal pheravat rup main abhimukhataa poorak, tha / the, hona ) ke paroksh rup ke istemaal se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In non-periodic aspects, the past tense can be expressed through a particular intransitive form in which the component verb has been used indirectly, except for the aspectual complement 'done'
 yah rup keval kuch hi sakaaratmak vyakhyanon main sambhav he
 In all other types of utterances, the inflection form must be employed
 vartmaan kaal bhoot kaal ke saamaan ek achihnit rup ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin isamen abhimukhataa poorak keval pheravat roopon main vyakti or sankhya he / hai, he / he ) ke saath samjhaute ke liye hi manaa kiye jate hai
 Interpreted forms, as with past tense, can be used for some positive lectures
 angrezi main shuddh bhavishya kaal vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi abhivyakt kiya jaataa he lekin ek bhavishya -chihnak kriya-visheshan yaa samay padbandh ke saath
 In English, the adverb denotative tense is expressed either by the use of a fully accepted adverb denotative form or by an additional adverb denotative adverb or a pure tense form with a phrase
 In English, the verb dative sign is most often used to express the future tense
 kriyabhaav dyotak bhavishya aath bhavishya roopon main se kisi ko bhi sanderbhit karata he jisamen bhavishya parinaamon ke anishchit swaroop ke kaaran anupramann ko sach nahin kaha ja saktaa
 yah rup nischitata ke hisaab se bhinn hote hai or hameshaa ek sahaayak manodasha ke abhipraay ke bheetar bhavishya nischitata kaa vah str abhivyakt karte hai
 The following list shows examples of tense expressions in some indo-european and finno-arjic periods using the verb "go"
 kaal mote taur par vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya ke rup main vargeekrut kiye gaye hai
 Several possible periods exist within these broad classifications
 in kaalon ke bich antar mukhya rup se kathan ke samay se samayik duuri kii degree kaa he
 For example, within the general category of the past tense, the immediate past, the distant past, the distant past and the distant past may exist, the difference being only the increase in the distance from the time of the narration to the narration
 kuch bhashaaen keval bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bich hi bhed nahin karti, balki gair-bhoot, gair-vartmaan, gair-bhavishya ke bich main bhi
 baad ke donon kaal pehle ke do sammilit karte hai, bina spasht kiye ki ve koun sa kar rahe hai

 ve agroday naamak ganraajya ke maharaja the
 Whose capital was Agroha dharmik manyatanusaar inkaa janm suryavanshiy maharaja vallabh sen ke antimkaal or kaliyug ke prarambh main aaj se 5185 varsh purv hua tha
 There was no unhappiness or helplessness in the rule of the entire Khandava kingdom, Ballabh Garh and the king of Agar district
 bachapan se hi ve apni praja main bahut lokapriy the
 He was a religious, peace messenger, praja vatsal, anti-violence, abolition of Bali system, Karunanidhi, loving kindness to all beings, loving kindness king
 ye ballab garh or agra ke raja ballab ke jyeshtha putr, shurasen ke bade bhai the At the time of puberty, he was invited to join the swayamvara of Raja Nagraj's daughter princess Madhavi
 us swayamvar main dur-dur se anek raja or rajkumaar aae the
 Even Indra, the king of the gods, came to visit the princess's beauty
 swayamvar main rajkumaari madhavi ne rajkumaar agrasen ke gale main jayamala daal di
 It was a combination of two different sects, castes and cultures
 jahaan agrasen suryavanshi the vahiin madhavi nagvansha kii kanya thim
 Indra got jealous of anger and anger due to this marriage and he stopped rain in Pratapnagar
 chaaron ore traahi-traahi much gayi
 People started becoming grasps of premature death
 tab maharaj agrasen ne indra ke viruddh yuddh chhed diya
 As Agrasen was fighting a religious war, his palace was heavy, seeing that the Gods made Narada Rishi a mediator and got the reconciliation between the two
 kuch samay baad maharaj agrasen ne apane praja-janon kii khushhaali ke liye kaashi nagari ja shivaji kii ghor tapasya kii, jisase bhagwaan shiv ne prasann ho unhen maan lakshmi kii tapasya karne kii salaah di
 Mother Lakshmi was pleased with the austerity done for charity and gave her darshan and said that she should create a new state and follow the Kshatra Dharma, nurture and protect her state and subjects! His kingdom will always be full of wealth
 apane naye rajya kii sthapana ke liye maharaj agrasen ne apni rani madhavi ke saath saare bharatvarsh kaa bhraman kiya
 At the same time, a lioness was seen giving birth to a cub at one place, it is said that soon after taking birth, the cub immediately jumped on the elephant considering Maharaja Agrasen's elephant as a crisis for his mother
 unhen laga ki yah divine sandesh he jo is veerbhumi par unhen rajya sthapit karne kaa sanket de rahaa he
 On the advice of sages and astrologers, the new state was named Agriyagna or Agrodaya and the place where the cub was born, Agroha, the capital of Agrodaya, was established
 yah jagah aaj ke haryana ke hisar ke paas hai
 Even today, this place is worshiped as the fifth dham for the Agrawal community, at present the Agroha Development Trust has made facilities for the people of Agrawal community who come here by building very beautiful temples, Dharamshalas etc
 maharaja agrasen ko samaajwaad kaa agradoot kaha jaataa he
 In order to establish true socialism in his area, he made a rule that in order to help every family who settled in his city from outside, each family in the city would give him a coin of the current trend and a brick, so that the newcomer could easily live for himself
 Manage the location and business
 maharaja agrasen ne tantreey shashan pranali ke pratikaar main ek nayi vyavastha ko janm diya, unhone punah vaidic sanathan arya saskrunti kii mul manyataon ko lagu kar rajya kii punargathan main krishi-vyapaar, udyog, goupalan ke vikaas ke saath-saath naitik mulyon kii punah pratishtha kaa bidaa uthaaya
 In this way, during the reign of Maharaja Agrasen, the Agrodaya Republic made double progress day and night
 kehete hai ki isaki charam smriddhi ke samay vahaan lakhon vyapaaree rahaa karte the
 To the newcomer who came there, the family settled in the state used to give one rupee and a brick as help, thus the newcomer would get millions of rupees and bricks to establish himself so that he could start his business without worry
 Used to do it
 mata mahalakshmi kii krupa se maharaja agrasen ne apane rajya ko 18 ganraajyo main vibhajit kar ek vishaal rajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha, jo inke naam par agrey ganraajya yaa agroday kahalaaya
 
 maharishi garg ne maharaja agrasen ko 18 ganadhipatiyon ke saath 18 yajna karne kaa sankalp karavaaya
 Seventeen-and-a-half gotras of the Agrawans were established in the name of these 18 Ganadhipatis sitting in yagyas
 us samay yagyon main pashubali anivaary rup se di jaati thi
 The priests of the first yajna themselves became Garg sages, initiated the eldest prince Vibhu and chanted them from the Garga gotra
 isi prakaar doosraa yajna gobhil rishi ne karavaaya or dwitiya ganadhipati ko goyal gotra diya
 Third Yagya Gautam Rishi got Goin gotra, in fourth Vatshi got Bansal gotra, in fifth Kaushik Rishi got kansal gotra, in sixth Shandilya Rishi was Singhal gotra, in seventh seventh Mangal Rishi got Mangal gotra, in eighth Jamin got Jindal gotra Tandya Rishi had Tingal gotra, Tenth in Aurvish Rishi, Aryan gotra in Gyarave, Dhaumya Rishi in Gyarawan got Dharan gotra, Mudgal Rishi in twelfth got Mandal gotra, Vasantha Rishi in thirteenth l'gotra, in the fourteenth, Maitreya Rishi gave the Mittal gotra, the fifteenth Kashyap Rishi gave the Kuchal gotra
 17 yajna purna ho chuke the
 At the time when live animals were being sacrificed in the 18th Yajna, Maharaj Agrasen was disgusted by seeing that scene
 unhone yajna ko bich main hi roak diya or kaha ki bhavishya main mere rajya kaa koi bhi vyakti yajna main pashubali nahin degaa, na pashu ko maaregaa, na maans khayega or rajya kaa har vyakti pranimaatr kii raksha karegaa
 Impressed by this incident, he embraced non-violence religion
 idhar antim or athaharwe yajna main yagnacharyo dwaara pashubali ko anivaary bataaya gaya, naa hone par gotra adhuraa rah jayega, aisa kaha gaya, parantu maharaja agrasen ke aadesh par atharaven yajna main nagendra rishi dwaara nangal gotra se abhimantrit kiya
 This gotra is considered half due to lack of animal sacrifices, thus even today 18 and a half seventeen gotras are prevalent in Agarwal society

 Jay Shri! maharaj ne apane rajya ko 18 ganon main vibhajit kar 18 guruon ke naam par 18 gotron kii sthapana kii thi
 Despite each tribe being different, they all remained part of the same family
 isi kaaran agroha bhi sarvangin unnati kar sakaa
 He established a democratic state by taking one representative each from the same 18 counties of the state, whose form is seen in the present democracy system as well
 agarawalon ke 18 gotra nimnlikhit hai - Yagna was considered a sign of prosperity, splendor and prosperity at that time
 maharaj agrasen ne bahut saare yajna kiye
 Once the horse brought to the sacrificial fire was very restless and frightened, he got an idea that what is the benefit of such prosperity which is filled with the blood of silent animals
 usee samay unhone apane mantriyon ke naa chaahane par bhi pashu bali par roak laga di
 That is why even today, the leading society remains away from violence
 maharaj agrasen ke raaj kii vaibhavta se unke padosi raja bahut jalte the
 So they kept attacking Agroha again and again
 baar-baar munhaki khaane ke baavjood unke kaaran rajya main tanaav bana hi rahata tha
 Due to these wars, Agrasenji was disturbed in the work of the welfare of the subjects
 log bhi bhaybheet or roj-roj kii ladai se trast ho gayi the
 Along with this, a huge fire broke out in Agroha once
 us par kisi bhi tarah kaabo naa paaya ja sakaa
 Thousands of people became homeless due to that fire and went to different states of India in search of livelihood
 par unhone apni pahchaan nahin chhodi
 All of them still like to be called Agarwal and maintain their identity with the same 18 gotras
 aaj bhi ve sab maharaj agrasen dwaara nirdeshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hai
 The capital of Maharaja Agrasen was Agroha
 unke shashan main anushaasan kaa paalan hota tha
 The public devoutly performed their duties with freedom
 maharaj agrasen ne 108 varshon tak raaj kiya
 a balanced harmony of tradition and experimentation is seen in the life values he embraced
 unhone ek ore hindu dharm grathon main kshatriya varna ke liye nirdeshit karmkshetra ko sweekaar kiya or duusari ore deshkal ke pariprekshya main nae adarsh sthapit kiye
 There are basically three ideals of his life - democratic governance, economic equality and social equality
 ek nishchit aayu praapt karne ke baad kuladevi mahalakshmi se paraamarsh par ve agrey ganraajya kaa shashan apane jyeshtha putr vibhu ke haathon main saunpkar tapasya karne chale gaye
 Towards the end of his life, Maharaj handed over all the responsibility to his eldest son Vibhu and adopted the Vanaprastha Ashram
 aaj bhi itihaas main maharaj agrasen param pratapi, dharmik, sahishnu, samaajwaad ke prerak mahapurush ke rup main ullekith hai
 Hospitals, schools, stepwells, Dharamshalas etc
 are the basis of Agrasen's life values in the country and these values are the symbol of human faith
 pracheen granthon main varnit agrey hi agarawalon kaa udgam sthaan aaj kaa agroha he
 Maharaja Agrasen Rashtriya Road No 10 is located as a hamlet along the hisar-sirsa bus route in Haryana, 190 km from Delhi and 20 km from Hisar

 mahaasaagar ke jal ke satat evam nirdesht disha vaale pravaah ko mahasagariya dhara kehete hai
 In fact, ocean currents are warm or cold rivers flowing in the oceans
 praayah ye bhranti hoti he ki mahasaagaron main jal sthir rahata he, kintu vastav me aisa nahi hota he
 The water of the ocean flows continuously at a regular speed and different forms of these currents are seen
 prakritik dhara main pramukh apvahan dhara evam stream karant hoti hai
 a stream current has some limitations, while the runoff current current has no specific limit
 prithvi par registaanon kaa nirmaan jalwaayu ke parivartan ke kaaran hota he
 Areas of high pressure and cold ocean water currents are natural phenomena, whose actions result in deserts after hundreds of years
 mahasagariya dhara banane ke mukhyat: teen kaaran hote hai - pratham to jal main lavan kii maatra ek sthaan kii apeksha duusare sthaan par badalati he, isliye sagariya jal ke ghanatv main bhi sthaan ke saath-saath parivartan aata he
 Due to the natural tendency of liquids in which they lead to a region of higher density, currents are formed
 duusare kaaran main surya kii kirane jal kii sataha par ek samaan nahin padatin
 This causes inequality in water temperature
 iske kaaran sanvahan dhara paidaa hote hai
 The third reason is strong winds flowing above the surface of the ocean
 unamem bhi jal main tarangen paidaa karne kii kshamta hoti he
 These waves are also formed by orbiting the Earth
 is ghurnan ke kaaran prithvi ke uttari hisse main ghadi kii disha main dharaaen banati hai
 Thus, the main reasons are: prithvi par anek dharaaen bahati hai
 The Gulf Stream is the most important of these
 is stream main jal nila evam ushn ho jaataa he
 It flows north of the Gulf of Mexico to Canada
 yahi kaaran he ki landan evam paris kam thande rahete hai jabaki norge ke tateey ilaake puure varsh barf rahit rahete hai
 Apart from this, Brazil Current, Japan, North Equator, North Pacific Ocean waves etc
 are counted among the major ocean currents of the world
 mahasagariya dharaaen sagariya jivan ke liye atyaavashyak hoti hai
 They are the main source of food for marine animals
 sagar tarangon se garm jal sheethal jal vaale kshetron tak jaataa he
 In contrast, oceanic waves also have an effect on the ground temperature
 satahi sagariya dhaaraon kaa gyaan pot-parivahan par hone vaale vyay ko kaafii had tak niyantrit karne main madad kar saktaa he
 It is these that have a major impact on fuel consumption, which significantly reduces expenditure and travel time
 puraane samay main to sagariya dhaaraon va vaayu disha gyaan or bhi mahatvapurn hua karata tha
 a good example of this is the Agulhas stream, which prevented Portuguese sailors and explorers from coming to India for long
 aaj bhi sansar bhar ke nauvahan pratiyogi sagariya dhaaraon kaa laabh uthaate hai
 Ocean currents are also important for ocean life
 iskaa ek udhaaharan il machhlee he
 Knowledge of ocean currents is also helpful in the study of oceanic cancer
 iskaa ulat bhi satya he
 These currents also play an important role in determining the temperature worldwide

 The place is located 4200 kilometers south-west of Perth, the capital of Australia
 unke anusaar mahaasaagar kii sataha se teen kilometre kii gaharaai par upasthit yah jal pravaah un mahasagariya dhaaraon ke vaishvik jal main ek mahatvapurn path he jo jalwaayu parivartanon ko prabhavit karte hai
 Charkha is a manual device from which yarn is made
 iskaa upyog kutir udyog ke rup main soot utpaadan main kiya jaataa he
 It became a symbol of economic independence in India's freedom struggle
 charkha yantra kaa janm or vikaas kab tathaa kaise hua, is par charkha sangh kii ore se kaafii khojbin kii gai thi
 Before the British came to India, there was a trend of charkha and loom across India
 1500 i
 tak khaadi or hastkala udyog puri tarah viksit tha
 In 1702 alone England bought 10,53,725 pounds of khadi from India
 marcopolo or tevernear ne khaadi par anek sundar kavitaayen likhi hai
 Tavernier's diary in 1960 praises Khadi's softness, strength, closeness and transparency
 bharat main charakhe kaa itihaas bahut pracheen hote hue bhi isamen ullekhneey sudhaar kaa kaam mahatma gandhi ke jeevankaal kaa hi maananaa chahie
 First of all, in 1908, Gandhiji came to know about the spinning wheel while he was in England
 uske baad ve baraabar is disha main sochate rahe
 They wanted the charkha to be brought from somewhere
 san 1916 main sabarmati ashram kii sthapana hui
 After two years of great efforts, in 1918 a spinning wheel was found near a widowed sister
 is samay tak jo bhi charakhe chalate the or jinaki khoj ho pai thi, ve sab khadey charakhe hi the
 Nowadays standing charkha has a sitting, two pillars, a farai and a circle of eight rows
 desh ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main bhinn bhinn aakaar ke khadey charakhe chalate hai
 The diameter of the spinning wheel is 12 inches to 24 inches and the length of the pillows is 19 inches
 us samay ke charakhon or takuon kii tulana aaj ke charakhon se karne par aashcharya hota he
 Of all the charkha samples received so far, Chikkol's standing charkha was the best
 iske chaak kaa vyas 30 inch tha or takuva bhi baarik tathaa chota tha
 It used to have good yarn of medium marks
 san 1920 main vinoba ji or unke saathi sabarmati ashram main katai kaa kaam sikhte the
 a few days later Satyagraha Ashram was established in Maganwadi
 us samay congress mahasmiti ne 20 lakh nae charakhe banane kaa prastaav kiya tha or unhen saare desh main failaana chaha tha
 The All India Khadi Mandal was established in 1923 during the Kakinada Congress, but by then there had not been much progress towards the reform of charkha
 congress kaa dhyaan raajnneeti kii ore tha, par gandhi ji use rachanaatmak kaaryon kii ore bhi kheenchna chaahate the
 Hence, the All India Charkha Union was established on 22 September 1925 in Patna
 charakhe main sanshodhan ho, iske liye gandhi ji bahut baichaiyn the
 In 1923, a prize of Rs 5,000 was also announced, but no developed specimen was received
 29 july san 1929 ko charkha sangh kii ore se gandhi ji kii sharton ke anusaar charkha banane waalon ko ek lakh rupaya puraskaar dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Many people tried to fulfill the conditions that Gandhiji had kept, but no one got success
 kirloskar bandhuon dwaara ek charkha banaaya gaya tha, lekin vah bhi shart puri na hone ke kaaran asafal hi rahaa
 There were equal usage experiments on the size of the spinning wheel in terms of utility
 khadey charakhe kaa kisaan charakhe kii shakal main sudhaar hua
 Gandhiji used to spin himself
 yarvada jail main kisaan charakhe ko peti charakhe kaa rup dene kaa shrey unheen ko he
 Shri Satishchandra Dasgupta made a bamboo charkha in the same manner as the standing spinning wheel, which proved very effective
 baans kaa hi janatachakra banaaya gaya, jis par shri virendra majumdaar lagaataar barason kaatte rahe
 The migration cycle was also made for children or for cutting in migration, which was less than the farmer cycle, but it was convenient to carry
 is prakaar ab tak bane hue charakhon main gati or soot kii majbooti kii drushti se kisaan charkha sabase acha rahaa
 Still, the charkha standing in the countryside remained more dear
 gandhi ji ke swargvaas ke baad bhi charakhe ke sanshodhan or prayog kaa kaam baraabar chalata rahaa

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai

 Hepatitis c virus is spread by blood to blood contact
 Most people have little, if any, symptoms after the initial infection, although 85% of the victims carry the virus in the liver
 Permanent infection can be cured by standard treatment such as medicines, peginterferon and ribavirin
 Over fifty-one percent have been fully recovered
 Those who get cirrhosis or liver cancer need a liver transplant and the virus goes completely after the transplant

 Acute hepatitis c refers to the first 6 months of infection with HCV
 60% to 70% of infected people do not show any symptoms during the acute phase
 a small number of patients experience symptoms of acute phase, they are usually mild and common and rarely help in diagnosing hepatitis C
 Acute hepatitis c infection includes reduced appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, itching, and flu-like symptoms
 Hep c genotypes 2A and 3A have the highest rates of relapse at 81% and 74%, respectively

 The hepatitis c virus spreads when there is blood-to-blood contact
 It is estimated that up to 90% of individuals in developed countries are infected with chronic HCV infection through the use or sexual contact of untreated blood or blood products or drug needles
 The primary sources of HCV infection in developing countries are infected injection equipment and inadequate blood and blood products
 There has not been a single documented case of blood transfusion in the United States for more than a decade because the blood supply is tested with both EIA and PCR techniques

 Sexual activities and behaviors were initially identified as potential sources of the hepatitis c virus
 Recent studies question this route of transmission
 Currently, this transmission is considered rare for Hepatitis c infection
 The following are currently known modes of transmission
 There may be other forms of transmission that are still unknown

 The cdna clone was first isolated from the hepatitis c virus genome in 1989 but until 1992 reliable tests for the virus screen were not available
 Therefore, people who have come in contact with blood or blood products before the implementation of blood supply test for HCV, must have been infected with HCV virus
 Blood products include clotting factors, immunoglobulins, pathogens, platelets, and plasma
 In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the risk of HCV infection is only one unit of blood in the United States, per one lakh per unit of transfusion

 Medical and dental personnel are the first responders, and military personnel accidentally exposed to blood can cause HCV infections from blood splatter on the eyes or wounds through accidental needles
 The use of universal precautions to avoid such accidental risks significantly reduces the risk of HCV

 Sexual transmission of HCV rarely occurs
 Studies show that the risk of sexual transmission among heterosexuals is much lower or rarer than single relationships
 The CDC does not recommend the use of condoms in single-term couples for a long time
 However, because of the high prevalence of hepatitis C, this small risk may translate into a non-trivial number of cases transmitted by sexual routes
 Vaginal penetrative sex is believed to have a low risk of transmission while sexual exposure to the anogenital mucosa, with a high degree of mental damage, has a high risk of transmission

 Personal care items such as razors, toothbrushes, cuticle scissors, and other manicuring or pedicuring devices can easily cause blood contamination
 There is a risk of HCV when such things are shared
 In any such condition, when wounds such as canker, winter sores, and the condition in which the bleeding continues immediately after cleaning the teeth, proper care should be taken during therapy

 The transmission of the disease that is transmitted from the infected mother to the child during the process of birth is called vertical transmission
 Transmission of hepatitis c from mother to child has been well described, but is relatively rare
 Transmission occurs only in women who are HCV RNA positive at the time of delivery
 In this case, an estimated 6 out of 100 are at risk of transmission
 Women out of both HCV and HIV positive at the time of delivery have a risk of transmission of HCV in 25 out of 100

 "hepatitis C" is difficult to diagnose during its acute phase because most infected people do not experience any symptoms at this stage of the disease
 People who experience symptoms during the acute phase are so ill that they cannot even get treatment
 Diagnosing the stage of chronic hepatitis c is also very challenging because until the liver disease progresses, its symptoms are not revealed and it takes several decades

 Hepatitis c testing begins with a blood test for bloodborne diseases that is used to detect HCV
 anti-hcv antibodies can be detected within 15 weeks of infection in 80% of patients, in> 90% after 5 months and in> 97% of patients after 6 months
 Overall, HCV antibody testing has a strong positive predictive value for immunity to hepatitis c virus, but patients who have not yet developed immunity or have insufficient levels of immunity may miss it
 Sometimes people with hcv-infected people do not develop antibodies to fight the virus
 That is why they do not bring positive tests in HCV antibody screening
 Because of this possibility, RNA testing should be considered when the immunological test is negative but the risk of hepatitis is high

 Genotype testing is generally recommended in people suffering from HCV infection
 HCV genotype testing is used to determine the long-term and potential response to interferon-based treatment

 In genotype 1 hepatitis c treated with ribavirin with pegylated interferon alpha-2a or pegylated interferon alpha-2b, human interferon lambada3, a signaling of genetic polymorphisms near human il28b gene, has significant differences in response to treatment Are connected
 This finding, informed in its original nature, has shown that patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C, possessing certain genetic variant alleles possessing the IL28B gene, are more capable than others in achieving sustained viral response after treatment
 Nature reports have demonstrated that the same genetic variation is also associated with natural acceptance of the genotype 1 hepatitis c virus

 In a mother who is also infected with HIV, the rate of transmission can be more than 19%
 At present, there is no data to determine whether antiviral therapy can reduce perinatal transmission
 Interferon and ribavirin are prescribed during pregnancy
 However, after the rupture of the membranes, skull skins can be lethally illuminated and prolonged labor can reduce the risk of transmission to the baby

 Many alternative therapies are aimed at streamlining liver function rather than treating the virus, thereby slowing the pace of the disease to maintain quality of life
 As an example, the extracts of Silybum marianum and Sho-psycho-toe are sold for their hcv-related effects, with the first being said to aid some liver functions and the second to aid liver health and the virus

 Some countries in Africa and Asia have more prevalence
 HCV prevalence is highest in Egypt, up to 20% in some regions

 Some studies have reported that standard treatment by interferon and ribavirin leads to greater success when the antiviral drug amantadine is also given
 Sometimes it is also called "triple therapy"
 This includes a dose of 100 mg of amantadine twice a day
 Studies suggest that this may prove particularly useful for "unresponsive" patients who previously had no benefit from treatment with only interferon and ribavirin
 Amantidine is not approved for
 Now studies are trying to find out when it can benefit the patient in the event of liver damage and when it can cause harm

 yah ganit or darshan main ek concept he jo aisi raashi ko kehete hai jisaki koi seemaa na ho yaa ant na ho
 In the past, people have expressed different views about the eternal

 This term is used for quantities whose steam or calculation is impossible due to their not being finite

 It is clear from the definition of fractions that fractions are the number that multiplies by s and gives the product
 yadi va, sa main se koi bhi shunya na ho to va / sa ek adwitiya raashi kaa nirupan karata he
 Then it is clear that 0 / s always remains the same, irrespective of the constant number

 Flowers, or flowers, are the reproductive structures found in plants
 ye kaha jaataa he
 Along with the reproductive components of flowering plants, flowers have been appreciated and used by humans, especially to decorate their environment and as a source of food
 paraag ko protsaahit karne ke liye pratyak pushp kii apni vishesh prakaar kii sanrachana hoti he
 Killistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open
 Many types of Viola and Salvi species have these types of flowers
 keetpremi phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Generally, many parts of the flowers have a gland called pollen that attracts these insects
 kuch phulon main sanrachanaayen hote hai jinhen madhuras nirdesh kehete hai jo ki paragan karne waalon ko bataate hai ki madhu kahan dhoondhna he
 Flowers also attract pollinators with fragrance and color
 phir bhi kuch phool paragakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nakal yaa anukaran karte hai
 For example, some orchid species create flowers that match the color, shape and scent of the female bee
 phool roopon main bhi visheshgy hote hai or punkatior kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paragak par sthanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vaastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragak un sabhi phulon main paraag ko streekashar main sthanantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Vataparagit flowers use air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, Ambergia rag hay and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators because of which they do not tend to be "showy flowers"
 Male and female reproductive organs are usually found in separate flowers, male flowers have long stamens fibers that are open at the end, and female fruits have long, wing-like pistils
 jahaan ki kitprageeya phulon ke paraag bade or lasalase daanon ki pravriti liye hue rahete hai jo ki protein main dhani hote hai, vaataparagit phulon ke paraag zyaadaatar chote dane liye hue rahete hai, bahut halke or kiton ke liye itane poshak bhi nahi

 If the flowers are not attached to the stem and are formed at the addresses, they are called avrita
 When the flower is flowered, it is called a flowering flower
 yadi phuleey pushpan phulon ke samoohon main khatm hota he, to prayek taana jo phool ko grahan kiye rahata he use pedicel kehete hai
 The flowering stem creates an end form called a flower chair or its letter
 The flower parts are arranged in a whorl above the letter
 vorl ke chaar mukhya bhaag is prakaar hai: Although the floral structure described above may be considered an 'ideal' structural scheme, the plant species show a wide variation of variation from this scheme
 ye badlaav phool-paudhon ke vikaas main bahut myne rakhte hai or vanaspatijna iskaa gahan prayog paudhon kii nasl ke sambandhon ko sthapit karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, two subfamilies of flowering plants can be distinguished by the inflated limbs of each of their whorls: a dicotyledon whorl ideally has four or five limbs, and monocotellidons have coefficients of three or three
 ek samuhik strikesar main keval do carpel ho sakate hai, yaa phir upar die gaye monocot or dikot ke samanyikaran se sambandhit na hon
 Most breeds of individual flowers, as described above, have both jayang and stamens
 vanaspatijna in phulon kaa varnan purna, ubhaylangeey, harmafrodit ke rup main karte hai
 Yet in some plant breeds, the flowers are incomplete or unisexual: holding only stamens or pistil organs
 In the first case if a particular plant which is either female or male is considered a diocesius 
 lekin agar ek lingeey purush yaa maadaa phool ek hi paudhe par dikhte hai to aise nasl ko monoisius kaha jaataa he
 Additional discussion on the change of flowers from the original plan is mentioned in the articles containing the original parts of the flowers
 un prajatiyon main jahaan ek hi shikhar par ek se zyada phool hote hai jise tathakthith rup se sayukt phul bhi kaha jaataa hai-aise phulon ke sangrah ko inflorosense bhi kaha jaataa he, is shabd ko phulon kii tane par ek vishisht vyavastha ko lekar bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Attention should be practiced in this regard as to what a "flower" is

 In many flowers, the element is coincident, if the outer part is divisible at any point from the central peak, two matching halves are created - they are called fixed or homogeneous
 udaa gulab yaa treelium
 jab phool vibhajit hote hai or keval ek rekha kaa nirmaan karte hai jo ki avyav sanyong kaa nirmaan karte hai aise phulon ko aniyamit yaa jaigomorfic udaa snapadragon / majus yaa zyaadaatar orkids
 a flower formula is a way that the structure of a flower is represented by a special letter, number, or symbol
 bajaay ek vishesh prajati ke, ek saamaanya formule kaa istemaal ek paudhe ke parivaar ke phuleey sanrachana ko ingit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The following representations are used
 Ca = bahyadalpunj Ca5 = dalpunj = pankhudiyaan kuch teen ke gunank main)or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; z yadi jode jaigomorfic a = punkesar g = jayang x: representing "variable number" ∞: representing many pushp sutara kuch is prakaar se dikhaai degaa: Many additional symbols are used phool kaa praathmik uddeshy prajnan he phool prajnan ang hote hai jo ki shukranuon ko paraag se bijand / andkosh se jodne main madhyastata karte hai, saamaanya rup se ek paudhe se dusre ko, par kai paudhe swayan ke phulon ko paraagit kar sakate hai
