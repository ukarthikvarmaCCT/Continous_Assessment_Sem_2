 haal hi main ek intervyuu ke dauraan 'tubalite' ke diarector kabir khan ne ompuri se judi kuch baaten share kii
 Hakir Khan remembers Ompuri saying that Om Puri had completed all the scenes of this film before leaving the world
 keval 1 din kii shooting kaa sirf ek shot bachaa hua tha, jise hamane bade aaraam se change kar diya
 In a way Om Ji left us after completing the film and left this last film in his memory
 mujhe is baat kaa bahut afsos hua kyonki unke saath meraa ek alag rishta tha
 i had also offered him the film 'kabul Express' in which he was going to be seen in the role of a terrorist but his doctor refused because it was a film in the film and Om ji had a lot of problem in his back
 uske baad ham log tach main rahe
 In 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' i also gave him a role which he liked very much, he also played that role but said that for me to write a big role next time
 phir maine 'tubalite' main ek banne miyaan kaa bada role likhaa, lekin durbhagyavash ye unki aakhri film sabit hui
 Subsequently when Kabir Khan was talked about Shahrukh's cameo role
 salmaan ke child actor ko reporter ne bataaya chini, to ye mila javaabakabir khan ne shahrukh khan ke bare main kya kahakabir ne bataaya ki maine kai filmein dekhi hai or jab bhi main koi chemiyo role dekhtaa hum to mujhe bada ajeeb lagata he
 Sometimes he thinks he is Gimmick
 main hameshaa sochataa tha ki us chemiyo role se film ko kya phayda hoga
 But in the film 'tubelight' came a voice from within me that there should be something in it which is different, because this is a character who takes great care of Laxman
 is kirdaar ke liye pehle ham kisi or actor ke bare main soch rahe the lekin baad main maine salmaan se baatcheet kii
 Shah Rukh agreed to just a call for a cameo in Tubelight: Salman Khan: He advised me to approach Shahrukh Khan for this role
 phir salmaan ne khud hi shahrukh se baat kii
 i have an old relationship with Shah Rukh Khan, who has studied in Shahrukh's school because i know him since college
 yahaan tak kii zarurat padane par maine unke note lekar ke padhai bhi kii he
 Shahrukh also liked this character immediately
 aap ek hi film main salmaan or shahrukh khan ko dekhenge to bahut hi badhiya seen saamne najar aata he
 In those days, Shah Rukh Khan was busy promoting the film 'raees', due to which Sonu Nigam gave a full day and the whole day we shot a scene with a very big schedule

 Bajaj Gaya Salman's 'radio', the first song of the film 'tubelight' was released
kabir does not like making sequels, i do not like sequels because i don't find his idea interesting
 lekin meri sabhi filmon main se agar kisi kaa sikval ban saktaa tha to wo tigar hi thi
 i am happy that a sequel is being made
 ali abbaas jafar bahut hi badhiya kaam kar rahe hai

 Kapil Mishra, who is on a hunger strike outside his home, made public the details of the foreign visits of five AAP leaders Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khaitan, Satyendar Jain, Raghav Chadha and Durgesh Pathak
 unhone kaha ki yah anshan nahin, balki satyagrah he or kejariwal jab tak in yatraaon kii jaankaree saarvajanik nahin karte, tab vah bhukh hadtaal par rahenge, bas jal grahan karenge
 During this, Kapil read a written statement in which he said, details of these foreign trips and where the money spent in these trips came from
 kahaan-kahaan gaye, kyon gaye, kya-kya kiya or kiske paison se ye sab kiya gaya
 You always said that we do not even have money to contest elections, then where did the money from these foreign trips come from? He said, i have been told by someone that after getting this information, the public will not let you stay in the chair even for a moment

 'kapil Mishra also said, and yes, now again the same ruse will not go on pretending that i am an agent of BJP, why today i am asking, why not ask earlier

 Kapil Mishra, who was removed as Delhi's water minister, had earlier tweeted late Tuesday that if AAP leaders did not reveal the source of funding for their foreign trips, they would sit on hunger strike

 Mishra, who was sacked from the AAP, said in a series of tweets made late Tuesday evening, 'all the details of the visits of Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khaitan, Satyendar Jain, Raghav Chadha and Durgesh Pathak should be made public
 unhone kaha, agar ye jaankariyaan saarvajanik nahin kii gai, passport kii ditels nahin di gai to kal subah se anshan karuunga

 At the same time, it has also been confirmed that BJP President Amit Shah is going to get a place in Modi Cabinet
 jiske baad bijepi adhyaksh pad ko lekar charchaaen shuru ho gai hai
 Gujarat BJP state president Jitu Vaghani has congratulated Amit Shah on joining the Modi cabinet
 jisase ye baat saaf ho gai he ki amit shah centre sarkaar main mantri banenge
 Amit Shah will become a member of CCS
 haalanki mantri banane ke saath hi amit shah ko bijepi adhyaksh kaa pad chhodana hoga
 After which now JP Nadda's name has been in the headlines for the post of BJP President
 vahiin rajasthan se rajyasabha saansad bhupendra yadav bhi bijepi adhyaksh pad ke res main he
 Who is JP Nadda? JP Nadda is considered a confidant of Amit Shah
 jagat prakaash (jepi) nadda modi sarkaar main swasthya mantri rah chuke hai
 Nadda entered politics from the Himachal Assembly elections held in 1993
 saath hi vah bilaspur ke vidhayak ke rup main pehali baar vidhansabha pahunche
 He was also the Health Minister of Himachal from 1998 to 2003
 vahiin saal 2008 se 2010 tak dhumal sarkaar main unhen van evam paryaavaran, vigyaan evam takneekee mantri bhi banaaya gaya
 He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 2012

 unhen party kaa rashtriya mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 Nadda is also in charge of Chhattisgarh
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhen upi kaa prabhaar saunpa gaya tha
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, BJP has recorded a good performance in Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin saal 2014 main bhi jepi nadda kaa naam bijepi adhyaksh pad ke liye saamne aayaa tha
 However then Amit Shah was made BJP President
 sanghathan main jepi nadda kii majboot pakad mana jaati he
 Who is Bhupendra Yadav Bhubendra Yadav has played many important responsibilities in the BJP organization
 vartmaan main rajasthan se rajyasabha saansad hone ke saath hi yadav sanghathan main rashtriya mahasachiv ke pad kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaa rahe hai

 bhoopendra yadav gujarat main bhi ahm daayitv sambhaal chuke hai
 He has also held the role of Chief Strategist in the 2013 Rajasthan Assembly Elections

 The Narendra Modi cabinet again issued the Land Acquisition (amended) Ordinance 2015 on 3 April
 sarkaar apane is adhyadesh ke jo phaayde gina rahi he, usamen se ek yah bhi he ki desh kii raksha ke liye kaam karne vaale sansthaanon ko jameen hasil karne main aasaani ho
 Therefore, factories and other institutions manufacturing defense equipment have also been added under the purview of the Defense Institute
 ab sena ke saath hi in sansthaanon ke liye bhi bhoomi adhigrahan main paryaavaran adhyayan, soshal audit, kisaanon kii sahmati or bahufasali jameen na lene kii baadhyataa khatm he
 Those who oppose the ordinance are also making noise on other issues, but the matter of protecting the country is such a sacred voice on which no one is ready to speak
 jamini hakeekat iske ulat he
 The Defense Ministry, which is desperate to get more land, is already the largest landowner in the country
 17
 The Ministry of Defense, which owns 3 lakh acres of land, not only has more than 81,000 acres more than its requirement, but it has not been able to use more than 50,000 acres of land already acquired
 yahi nahin, takreeban 26,000 acre jameen aisi he, jise raksha mantralay ab apane kaam laayak nahin maanata or usne ise parityakt maan liya he
 The Ministry neither uses this land nor makes it available for any other purpose
 jis desh main kisaan jameen ke chote-se tukade ko apane khun-paseene se sinchakar fasal ugaata he or mausam kii maar ke baad sir patakekar rah jaataa he, us desh kii raksha ke liye jimmedaar sena ke aalaa afasaron ke aamod-pramod ke liye 5,000 acre se zyada jameen main 97 golfcorse chal rahe hai
 Many of these golf courses are such that the Ministry does not consider it necessary to give information about how much land there is
 majaa dekhie, jab yah sawaal khadaa hua ki golf course kaise sainik jaruraton ke daayre main aaenge, to 2006 main sena adhyaksh ne golfcorson ko sena kaa paryaavaran park ghoshit kar diya
 These facts were made public by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in a report tabled in Parliament on March 25, 2011 on the assets of the Ministry of Defense
 iske baad disambar 2013 main bijepi ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi kii adhyakshata vaali sansad kii lok lekha samiti (piesi) ne bhi sieji ke khulaase kii tasdik kii thi
 The current Minister of State for Environment and Forests (independent Charge) Prakash Javadekar was also a member of this committee
 donon sansthaaon ne apni sifarish main kaha ki raksha mantralayon kii parisampatti kaa prabandhan bahut lachar he or ise badalane kii jarurat he
 There is a slight difference in the opinion of the two: the CAG in its recommendation said that the additional land should be used for other public welfare works, while the PAC headed by Murli Manohar Joshi said that this land should be used for other welfare works of the army
 Be done in yahaan dilachasp baat yah he ki donon sansthaaon ne barason tak baariki se jaanch karne ke baad atirikt jameen kii maujuudagi sweekaar kii, iske kuprandhan kii baarikiyaan ginaayin, lekin kahin yah nahin kaha ki desh kii raksha ke liye raksha mantralay ko or jameen kii jarurat he
 But the Ministry of Defense does not accept these things
 sieji report taiyaar hote samay raksha mantralay ke tab ke karnadhaaron ne atirikt jameen hone se inkaar kar diya tha or sansad ke maujuuda bajet satr main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne saaf kaha, ''raksha mantralay ke paas koi atirikt jameen nahin he
 Whatever the land is for the use of defense works
 '' sarkaar kii yah bhi daleel he ki raksha kshetra main ''mek in india'' ko badhaava dene ke liye videshi companiyon ko aamantrit karnaa hoga or nai nirmaan or takanic viksit karne kii ikaayiyon ke liye jameen kii jarurat hogi
 By the way, according to the CAG and PAC, there are 25 army stations in the country, out of which the records of Local Military Authorities (LMA) at 9 stations were found to be 12,769 acres more than the records of Defense Estate Officers (DEO), while the remaining stations
 But this land was found to be 9,427 acres less
 yani sena ke paas kitni jameen he, iskaa thos record nahin he
 The accounts of the army land are so scattered that after the completion of six years since 2006, in October 2011 the operation of digitization of records "raksha Bhoomi" was completed, even then the exact records could not be recorded
 shaayad sena kaa kaam karne kaa tarika hi alag hota he
 That is why the defense department is adopting a stubborn attitude towards the use of land, showing a stronger attitude in the operation of the areas under the cantonment administration
 pichley saal zyaadaatar cantonment ilaakon main bahut si sadaken suraksha ke naam par sthaayee rup se band kar di gayi
 This created a crisis for the population of 50 lakh living in 62 cantonments spread over 2 lakh acres of land
 raksha mantralay ke diarector (el and si) nitin chayande ne teenon senaaon ke pramukhon or raksha parisampatti ke mahanideshak ko 7 janvari, 2015 ko patr likhakar kaha ki cantonment ilaakon main bade paimaane par aam raaston ko band kiye jane kii shikaayatein mili hai
 This should be stopped immediately and the roads are opened
 deshbhar main chhavnee ilaakon main rah rahe logon ko ek manch par laakar sangharsh kar rahe jhaansi ke ke
 s
 phukelaa kaa daawa he, ''desh ke zyaadaatar kaint kshetron main is aadesh ke baavjood sadaken nahin khuli hai
 We are living under military rule in free country
 kabhi kisi ke maveshi chin liye jate hai, kabhi kisi kaa makaan gira diya jaataa he or phogiyon kii badasluki jhelane kii to hamen aadat si pad gai he
 Pradeep Jain Aditya, former Jhansi MP and former Minister of State for Rural Development, says, “I used to sweat while seeking permission from the cantonment administration to burn Ravana of Dussehra in Sadar Bazar area
 '' sena ke ravaie main badlaav ke liye unhone pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko patr likhaa he
 Keshav Prasad Maurya, BJP MP from Phulpur Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh and Malla Reddy, TDP MP from Malkajgiri in Telangana, have also written letters to the Prime Minister on similar issues in their respective areas
 haryana ke ambala se bijepi saansad ratan laal kataaria kaa daawa he, ''east india company ke jamaane se kaint kshetron main chal rahaa 1836 kaa jijio 179 damankaaree he
 The government should end it immediately
 '' yah kanoon sabhi cantonment board main sainik afasaron ko janata kaa daman karne kaa aseemit adhikaar detaa he
 Will the GGO-179 be included in the hundreds of laws that the Modi government is going to fight, or will the government put its full force on raising more land for the largest government landlord, the Ministry of Defense? a post shared by anushkasharma1588 (@anushkasharma) on Mar 21, 2018 at 5:20am PDTA post shared by Rani Mukherjee Chopra(@ranimukherjeefp) on Mar 21, 2018 at 4:34am PDTA post shared by Rani Mukherjee Chopra (@ranimukherjeefp) on Mar 20, 2018 at 4:47am PDT (also from input language) hansraj college kii principal dow

 Australia beat hosts England by 39 runs in the first T20 International of a two-match series thanks to their explosive batsman Aaron Finch's 156-run world record innings of 11 fours and 14 sixes
 
 247
 Aaron Finch not only broke the record for the biggest individual score in Twenty20 international cricket in this blazing innings at an unbelievable strike rate of 61, but the 14 sixes he bowled were also the most in an innings
 isse pehle, tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main sabase bade vyaktigat score kaa record newzealand ke brandan mackulam ke naam tha, jinhone bangladesh ke khilaaf 123 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Also, this century of Aaron Finch is the second fastest century in the history of T20 cricket
 finch ne apana 100waan ran 47veen gend par banaaya, jabaki isse pehle newzealand ke khilaaf richard levi ne sirf 45 gendon main shatak thok daalaa tha
 By the way, the record of the lowest balls century in any format of cricket is recorded by Shahid Afridi of Pakistan, who touched 100 runs in just 37 balls in a one-day international
 pehali hi gend par chakka jadkar pari kii shuruyaat karne vaale aaron finch ke 'de danaadan' vaale mood kaa yahi sabase bada saboot he ki unki pari kaa har mahatvapurn padaav unhone chakke se hi paar kiya
 Finch, who hit 14 sixes out of a total of 18 in the Kangaroos' innings, completed his 50 runs (26th ball) with a six, also scored his century (47th ball) with a six, broke Brandon mccullum's record with a six, and 150
 The run figure was also touched by sixes
 vaise, bhale hi duniya main yah doosraa sabase tej tii-20 shatak he, lekin australia kii ore se na sirf yah sabase tej tii-20 shatak he, balki yah kangaaroon kii ore se tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main thoka gaya pehla or ekmaatr shatak bhi he
 The comments england ne darasal, is match main toss jitkar pehle fielding karne kaa faisla kiya tha, lekin kangaroo salaami ballebaaj finch ne unke is faisle ko katai bevakoofana sabit kar diya
 With the help of Aaron Finch's historic innings, Australia has won for the first time in any format of international cricket for the first time in the last seven months, and this victory has led to a 3–0 loss in the Ashes series on this tour
 Must have had some ointment
 is pari ke saath hi aaron finch tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main shatak thokane vaale 10wein ballebaaj ban gaye, or iske boote australia ne 20 over main chah wicket ke nuksaan par 248 ranon kaa pahaad khadaa kiya, or jawaab main england ke ballebaaj jo root ke naabad 90 ranon ke baavjood kul 209 ran hi bana sake
 247
 61 ke avishsaneey strike rate se kheli gai is dhamaakedaar pari main aaron finch ne na sirf tinti-20 antarrashtriya cricket main sabase bade vyaktigat score ke record ko todaa, balki uske dwaara thoke gaye 14 chakke bhi ek pari main sarvaadhik hai
 Earlier, the record for the highest individual score in T20 international cricket was for New Zealand's Brandon mccullum, who scored an innings of 123 runs against Bangladesh
 iske alaava aaron finch kaa yah shatak tii-20 cricket ke itihaas kaa doosraa sabase tej shatak he
 Finch scored his 100th run off 47th ball, while Richard Levy hit a century in just 45 balls against New Zealand
 vaise, cricket ke kisi bhi format main sabase kam gendon main shatak kaa record pakistan ke shahid aafridi ke naam darj he, jisane ek-divasiy antarrashtriya match main sirf 37 gendon main 100 ran kaa aankada chuaa tha
 Aaron Finch's 'de Danadan' mood, which started the innings with a six on the first ball, is the biggest proof that he crossed every important stage of his innings with a six
 kangaaroon kii pari main lage kul 18 main se 14 chakke thokane vaale finch ne apane 50 ran (26veen gend) chakka lagaakar puure kiye, apana shatak (47veen gend) bhi chakke se banaaya, brandan mackulam kaa record bhi chakke se hi todaa, or 150 ran kaa aankada bhi chakke se hi chuaa
 By the way, even though this is the second fastest T20 century in the world, it is not only the fastest T20 century by Australia, but also the first and only century by the Kangaroos in T20 international cricket
 is also
 tippaniyan England had, in fact, decided to field first by winning the toss in this match, but Kangaroo opener Finch proved his decision to be a fool
 aaron finch kii is aitihaasik pari kii madad se australia ko pichley saat maheene main pehali baar antarrashtriya cricket ke kisi bhi format main pehali jeet hasil hui he, or is jeet se isi daure par ashes shrunkhlaa main 3-0 se mili karaari haar ke zakhm par kuch maraham laga hoga
 With this innings, Aaron Finch became the 10th batsman to score a century in T20 international cricket, and this helped Australia lift a mountain of 248 runs for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs, and in response to England batsman Joe Root Despite an unbeaten 90, he could only score 209 runs

 Women can not only interact with anyone better than men but also do not hesitate to share their talk with others
 jab mahilaon ko apane pati kaa saath nahin mil paata he to unhen kisi duusare se apane dil kii baton ko share karne kii jarurat mahasoos hone lagati he
 This not only fulfills the innate needs in their life, but also awakens the enthusiasm, enthusiasm and waves in their life, which is missing from their daily married life

 Cindy Lauper's song "girls Just Want to Have Fun" tells us that many women who are shocked and upset by a failed marriage have affairs with someone else, because there is no chance of fun and fun in their marriage
 Lives and their lives become very dull and cumbersome

 With this lifestyle, the two do not get any time to talk among themselves
 yahaan tak ki veekend or chuttee ke din bhi vah ek duusare se kate-kate hi rahete hai
 After the birth of children, her husband's love for many wives is not the same as before and begins to see her as the mother of a child
 vah unhen apni patni yaa premika ke rup main nahin dekhte
 Miss Solin said that depression and hopelessness start to develop in the minds of women facing this situation
 mahilaayein apane pati se pyaar or atmiyata chaahati he or jab yah atmiyata mahilaon ko apni jindagi main nahin milti to unke paas shaadi se baahar pyaar kii talash karne ke alaava or koi vikalp baaki nahin rahata
 He said that there is nothing worse for women than to face the situation of unsuccessful marriage
 jis shaadi main atmiyata or pati ke pyaar or chahat kii kami hoti he, vahaan mahilaon par iskaa shaareerik or maansik dushprinaam kaaphi hota he
 The increasing cases of divorce in India are characteristic of the modern world

 At such a time, platforms for making love out of marriage protect women from their boredom and failed marriages
