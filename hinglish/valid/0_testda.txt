 Just as Hindus are happy reading the story of Lanka Vijay in Ramayana

 The prince of Troy kidnapped Queen Helen of Sparta and took him to the city of Troy
 is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye yunaan ke sabhi raajaaon or veeron ne milakar try par akraman kiya
 But neither the city gate was broken nor the ramparts could be broken
 ant main unani sena ne ek chaal chali
 a wooden hollow horse was mounted on a wheelbarrow
 use chhod ve apane jahaajon se waapas laut gaye
 The people of Troy thought that the Greeks left their idol of the god and were disappointed
 ve use khinchakar nagar main laae to mukhyadwar ke mehrab ko kuch kaatna padaa
 At night, when Troy was celebrating, Greek soldiers came out of the hollow ash statue and quietly opened the gate of Troy
 greek sena, jo waapas nahin gai thi balki paas main jaakar chhip gai thi, troy main ghus gai
 Troy perished behind a Helen just as Ravana's golden Lanka was destroyed behind Sita

 'odyssey' is the saga of the adventurous return journey of the Greek monarch Odessus

 The story begins in the last part of this painful period

 In Canto Nine, Odesian narrates the story of the Battle of the Syconies

 For nine days and nine nights, our battle-ships wandered far away from the north wind

 They were forcibly dragged and brought onto the vessel
 phir aage chalakar ham ek nayanvaale rakshason ke desh main pahunche or apni morrkhtaa se ek rakshas kii gupha main kaid ho gayi
 Then cleverly, after giving him liquor, he broke his eye with a big block and in the morning, when the demon opened the cave to his sheep to go out, we got out by tying ourselves with each sheep
 yah rakshas samudr evam bhucamp ke adhipati varun kaa putr tha
 Due to this, Varun became angry with us

 Zeus allows Athena to act as he pleases, and she appears as a mentor to Odysseus' son Telemacus, advising him to block the entry of Pinelopei's patronesses into his house and to locate his father himself

 Telmacus organizes a gathering and condemns the pioneers of Pinelopei and embarks on a journey without informing his mother, with the help of Mentor, Athena
 menter ke saath vah pilos pahunchakar vruddh nestor se miltaa he jahaan use trajan yuddh ke asal vivaran gyaat hote hai
 From Pilos he goes to Sparta
 vahaan mene laos kii patni hellen se miltaa he or ghar lautne kii taiyaari karne lagata he
 Shortly thereafter, the poet presents the events of the kingdom of Odysseus in Ithaca
 ek ore pinalopi apane putr ke ekaek lupt ho jane se santrast he or duusari ore uske panigrahanarthi bandargah par antinus kii dekharekh main ek jahaaj bhejkar vyavastha karte hai ki telemacas jaise hi laute, uski hatya kar di jaay taaki odisius kii sampatti or pinalopi par unka kabja ho sake
 The fifth verse again contains the scene of the assembly of the gods, in which Athena once again seeks the salvation of Odysseus
 jiyas harmij ko callypso ke paas bhejtaa he or uske kehane se vah vrikshon ke latthon kaa bedaa banaakar odisius ko ethaka kii ore ravaanaa kar detii he
 After traveling with the help of stars for 17 days, as Odysseus approaches the island of Fiacia, the rage of Poseidon, the god of the sea, shatters his fleet and begins to sink into the waves
 tabhi samudr kii apsara liukothea use ek pranarakshak roomaal detii he jiske sahare vah antat: fiaisia pahunchataa he
 In the sixth verse, Nausicaa, the daughter of King Elsinus of Fiacia, receives orders from Athena in the dream to wash her clothes on the beach the next morning, where she meets Naked Odysseus
 saatven anuvaak main vah use kapadaa pahanaakar ghar le aati he
 In the eighth verse, King Elsinus greets Odysseus in the court
 is avasar par bhaat trajan-yuddh-sambandhi geet gaata he to odisius vichlit hokar rone lagata he
 Odysseus has to give his real introduction when the king asks him the reason for crying
 agle teen anuvaakon main odisiastroy ke patan ke baad kii apni 10 varsh kii romaanchak yatra kaa vivaran sabko sunaata he
 In the 12th Anuwak, Odysseum arrives at Ithaca on the magical ship of Phycia where Athena meets him as a shepherd and transforms him into a beggar so that his wife's benefactors do not harm him by recognizing him
 13wein anuvaak main ethina odisius ko uske shookarpal ke yahan bhejkar swayan sparta jaati he or telemacas ko shighrata se ethaka lautne kaa aadesh detii he
 In the 14th verse there is a conversation between Odysseus and Schukarpal
 15wein anuvaak main telemacas apni maan ke panigrahanarthiyon ke shadyantr se bachakar surakshit ghar laut aata he
 In the 16th verse, Telemacus recognizes his father in the house of Schukarpal
 pashchaat pitaputra pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon se chhutkaaraa paane kii yojana banaate hai
 In the 17th and 18th paragraphs, beggar Odysseus arrives at his palace where his old dog, Eragus, recognizes him and dies in joy
 isi samay odisius prasaad main upasthit pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon kaa auddhatya dekhtaa he jisase aage chalakar unhen maarane ke uske bhayankar krity kii uchit bhoomika bhi ban jaati he
 In the 19th episode, Odysseus and Pinalopi have a face-to-face conversation, but Pinalopi does not recognize her husband, while her old husband Euryclia recognizes her by looking at the childhood amputation on her leg
 20 wein anuvaak main odisius gusse ke kaaran raat bhar jagakar anek baaten sochataa rahata he
 In the 21st verse, Pinlopi challenges his descendants to shout the bow of Odysseus in the innings in such a way that he arrives out of the middle of 12 rings hanging in a huge tree
 sab asafal hote hai kintu bhikshukveshi odisius chhallon ke bich se tir nikaal detaa he
 The 22nd verse marks the climax of the epic
 odisius pinalopi ke saare panigrahanarthiyon ko tiron se bedhakar maar detaa he
 No one escapes, as all the doors of the spacious chamber were already locked, in the 23rd episode Pinelopy recognizes her husband, and the heartwarming and touching scene of the two meet
 maha kavy ke antim athwa 24wein adhyay main, jise kuch aalochak prakshipt maanate hai, devdoot marakari pinalopi ke sabhi panigrahanarthiyon kii atmaaon ko narak ke nichle evam nikrusht pradeshon main le jaataa he jahaan unhen vibhinn prakaar ke traasamay dand die jate hai
 Meanwhile, Odysseus goes to the fields outside the city and meets his father Lartise
 ant main odisius ke ghar laut aane ke upalaksh main shandaar daavat hoti he or ithaka main sukhshanti sthapit hone kii soochna ke saath granth kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 The story of the Iliad is just 50 days - the events of the last two months of the tenth year
 yadi kathanak katha ke armbh se prarambh hota to us leeda evam hans ke sanyog se prarambh hona chahie tha
 But Homer catches the last part of the story
 bich-bich main vah purv katha kaa sanket karata jaataa he, vah bhi ek kram se nahin
 The legend is already known to the Greek audience
 isi se use koi kathinaayee nahin gyaat hoti, anyathaa ek anjaan vyakti ko katha kaa prathamansh tabhi spasht hoga jab ek baar vah sampoorn kavy kaa pathan kar jaae
 The second thing to keep in mind about Elliot is that his subject, as is evident from Mangalacharan, is the anthem of Echiles
 jahaan yah krodh apni charam parinti ke baad samaapt hota he
 The story ends until a little further, that is, the direct results of this anger until the death of Petraclus and indirect death of Hector, but the death of Echileus, the destruction of Troy, etc
 does not come in this epic
 homer apane mahakavy main ghoshit vishay par badi kadai se ‘tu da point’ sthit rahata he - jaraa bhi idhar-udhar nahin jaataa
 The result of this extreme restraint is the story or 'unity of the subject'
 prayek ghatana samoochee dizin ke andar kasi hui angik sangati ke saath baithaayi gayi he
 There is a lack of unity and consistency in the Indian epics and the whole structure is complete with a loose narrative system
 valmiki ramayana kaa vishay he polastyavadh, par usamen avaantar ghatnaayen bahut deele sutron se judi hai
 In the Mahabharata, this 'unity' is not at all - it is written in the style of encyclopedia
 tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas main avashya yah ‘gathili ekta’ evam ‘angik sangati’ homer kii hi tarah milti he
 As far as the unity and effectiveness of the subject is concerned, no Indian poet, even Kalidas, can equal Tulsidas
 yah baat yahan abhidharth main likhi ja rahi he
 Homer describes and describes the anger of Echiles and its development in 9 cantos and concludes the story by taking its direct, indirect fruits
 yadi vah aage kii ghatana, ekiles kii mrityu evam try-dhwans, tak varnit karne ke pralobhan main padataa to kavy main vah kati-chhati gathili dhaanchaagat ekta nahin aa paati
 The structure would have become loose
 arestu ne homer kii pratibha kii saraahna ‘poytics’ ke un adhyyon main kii he or homer kaa hi anukaran kaa adarsh banane kii shiksha di he, jahaan vah ‘teen ektaaon’ evam prabhavanviti kii charchaa karata he
 In Greek literature, there is a great emphasis on structure
 yah rup vidhaan kii jyamithik sangati, unki murtikla, natyakala aadi sabhi ke andar spasht he
 He did not attach any less importance to Bhaanda than sentiment and ornamentation
 homer main yah pravriti na keval beej rup main vidyaman he, balki uskaa sarvottam rup homer main hi miltaa he
 The whole 'action' in the Iliad is circular
 jahaan se prarambh hota he, vahiin par aakar samaapt hota he
 The rites that provided the structure and the homeland to the Greek tragedy are the ethnic treasures of the Greeks, and they also establish the life of Homer's genius
 isi se homer evam kaalaantar ke tragedy sahitya main dhaanchaagat evam bhavgat samanta he
 The structure of the Greek tragedy is governed by three elements - 'one country', 'one period', and 'one trade or subject'
 elliod main ‘desh’ ek hi he arthath sari ghatana try ke mehalon evam saamne ke samudratat par hi hoti he
 The 'period' is also the same, because the epic story is of a continuous duration of 50 days
 arthath, ‘kaal’ kaa ek anwarat akhand rup diya gaya he - 10wein varsh ke antim 50 dinon ko pakad kar
 He does not spread the circle on the surface for 10 years and he covers it within 50 days
 vyapaar yaa vishay bhi ek hi he - ekiles kaa krodh, uskaa shaman evam upsanhaar ke rup main uskaa fal
 Just here, the epic ends
 odesi kaa vishay vistrut he
 The hero of the epic Odysseus wandered for 10 years after the war
 is dashak ke antim bhaag se is mahakavy kaa bhi prarambh hota he
 The structure is exactly like the Iliad
 elliod ke 50 dinon kii ghatana main vartmaan kaa hi praadhanya he - un 50 dinon main kya ghatit hua, isi kaa varnan kavi kaa uddeshy he
 The events of the past come somewhere along the way
 parantu odesi main yah baat nahin
 The theme of Odyssey is 'odysseus's sad journey'
 atah yah 10 varshon kaa bhraman-vrittant hi uskaa uddeshy he
 Like the Iliad, it begins at the end of the decade, but its purpose is more related to the 'past' than the 'present'
 isliye homer aadhunik filmon kaa flashbek-technic kaa upyog karata he
 The epic begins in the 10th year, when Odysseus Apsara begins a voyage from the island of Kelipso, and his fractal vessel sinks and flows into the land of Nasica
 vahaan ke raja ko apane 9 varshon kii ram kahani sarg 9 se 12 tak main sunaata he
 The 'PRE-MEMORY' technique is in this 9th to 12th cantos
 parantu is purv smriti ke garbh main bhi ‘antahpurv smriti’ he 11wein sarg main, jab vah ekiles ko try yuddh kii katha kaa sheshansh sunaata he
 The time organization of Odyssey is very complicated
 ‘vartmaan’ ke garbh main ‘purv’ evam us purv ke garbh main ‘antahpurv’ nihit he
 The entire period can be termed as 'mukul-patra-bandh'
 kali main pankhudiyon kii ek parat ke andar duusari parat, duusari ke andar teesri parat padi rahati he
 In the same way, there is a time lag for Odessi
 yah kaal-bandh dvigun pechida isliye ho jaataa he ki odesi kaa ‘desh’ ek nahin he
 The theme of Odyssey is 'fierce Seascape and Cavitation'
 atah vyapaar ke kendra do ho jate hai
 One is Ithaca where her queen Pinilopy is waiting for her and her sons and sisters are surrounded by her enemies
 doosraa he odesius swayan evam uski samudr-sataha par kii chalyman sthiti
 The events of these two 'countries' are handled by the great master Zeus
 ‘desh kii ekta’ na hone par bhi vishay yaa vyapaar kaa ekta usee tarah kati-chanti rup main vidyaman he jis tarah ‘elliod’ main
 The poet carefully and carefully protects the consistency and goodness of the entire business by placing the other event in one layer
 elliod kii vishay-vastu simit he
 That is the pattern of the tragedy
 badi saralata se kaary-prabhaav kii ekta saadh lee gayi
 But the subject of 'odyssey' is broad
 yah upanyaas kii tarah he
 Yet so carefully the unity of work and influence has been edited that even today's genre-oriented or form-oriented novels fade in front of him
 ek aadi kavi ke liye-ek prarambhkartta ke liye itani badi kaarigari aashcharya kaa hi vishay he
 In short, the Ilayad's design is tragedy and Odyssey's novel
 itnaa hote hue bhi odesi bahut-si baton main elliod ke samaanaantar he
 Both Iliad and Odesi poetry begin by holding the end of the story
 donon kaa ant bhi prarambh main ghoshit vishay par hota he
 The motion of both are circular
 donon main sargon kii sankhya 24 he
 Hector dies at the end of the Iliad, and the prince-pleading princes in Odyssey
 elliod ke ant main ek shant vaataavaran, kuch kaal ke hi liye sahi, upasthit ho jaataa he jisamen donon paksh mritkon kaa dah-sanskaar karte hai
 In Odessi, at the end, there is a final peace and lasting peace
 donon mahakavyon ke andar aaye charitra ek hi paimaane or saanche main dhale gyaat hote hai
 The deviousness and readiness that Anthony helps the Greek warriors in the Iliad, as well as in Odyssey
 pojidon donon main ek krur evam ujdd devtaa kii tarah he
 Odesius is depicted as courageous, heroic, cruel, and devious in both epics
 minilas usee prakaar dhani, udaar hriday yoddha donon mahakavyon main he
 a friend of wise old Nestor also stays there
 yadi in mahakavyon ke rachayita alag-alag hote to charitron ke chithran main fark avashya aa jaataa
 For example, Homer's 'diomidil' or 'afroditi' are completely different from Virgil's Diomidis or Afroditi
 kathanak evam charitron kaa samaan pattern bataata he ki donon kavy ek hi vyakti kii pratibha se nicksruth hai

 Ashtadhatu is a mishratu used in the construction of Hindu and Jain idols
 jin aath dhaatuon se milakar yah banati he, ve ye hai- sona, chaandi, tamba, sisa, jasta, tin, loha, tathaa paara kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In an ancient book, they are instructed as follows: swarna roopyan tamran c rang yashadamev c
 Sis iron iron raschecheti dhatvoltashtau prakritita:
 sushrutsamhita main keval pratham saat dhaatuon kaa hi nirdesh dekhakar apatat: prathit hota he ki sushrut paara ko dhaatu maanane ke paksh main nahin hai, par yah kalpana thik nahin
 He has also considered Rasa elsewhere as a metal
 ashtadhaatu kaa upyog pratimaa ke nirmaan ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Then the eclipse of brass in place of juice should be understood; Such is the decision of Hemadri based on a promise of Bhavishpurana
 jyotish shaastra ke anusaar har dhaatu main nihit urja hoti he, dhaatu agar sahi samay main or grahon kii sahi sthiti ko dekhakar dhaaran kiye jaaen to inkaa sakaaratmak prabhaav praapt hota he anyathaa dhaatu vipareet prabhaav bhi detaa hai | ashtadhaatu hinduon ke liye aityant shubh dhaatu he
 Since ancient times, Ashtadhatu has also been used in statue making
 ashtadhaatu kaa upyog pratimaa ke nirmaan ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha | iske alaava ashtadhaatu kaa prayog ratna ko dhaaran karne ke liye bhi hota tha yadi aapaki kundali main rahu ashubh sthiti main ho to vishesh kshtdaayak hota he usame bhi rahu kii maha dasha or antardasha main atyant hi kshtkaarak dushprabhav de saktaa he aisi sthiti main daahine haath main ashtadhaatu kaa kadaa dhaaran karne se avashya hi laabh praapt hota he saath hi kisi yogya jyotish ke paraamarsh se rahu kaa jap or daan bhi kar sakate he yah upaay avashya hi raahat pradaan karata he
 Ashtadhatu side effects aajkal ashtadhaatu se bani koi bhi cheez jaise kadaa, anguthi kam hi log pahante hai kyoki ashtadhaatu lead,paara, ye bhi dhaatu milakar banaai jaati he jo kii cancer rog kaa ek mukhya kaaran hota he isliye ashthadhatu kaa prayog aaj ke samay main kam ho gaya hai | But in Panchadhatu, other than lead and mercury, other metals such as iron, nickel and rhodium etc
 are made ashtadhatu, which is wrong, it does not affect that much
 saal 2017 main nalanda jile main shauchalay nirmaan ke dauraan jameen kii khudaai main ashtadhaatu kii pratimaa nikal ai
 ye prattima vishnu kii he jisaki lambaai lagbhag paanch feet se zyada he

 shakti electronic ke kaaran vidyut urja ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan hue hai
 Today, drives are available to drive motors ranging from 10 watts to several hundred megawatts
 6 jigawatt tak kii vidyut shakti lagbhag 1000 kilovolt ke ucch-voltata disi pareshan ke madhyam se transmit kii ja sakati he
 Trains, elevators, and cranes are all running smoothly through power electronics
 akshay urja ke sroton ke vidyut grid se jodne main shakti electronic kaa hi haath he
 Even radar systems rely on power electronics
 yadhyapi shakti electraniki main chote-mote sabhi electronic avyav prayukt hote hai, kintu nimnlikhit avyavay shakti electraniki ke vishishti pahchaan hai- Work in the field of power electronics was preceded by miniature-signal electronics
 sabase pehle vidyut shakti ke niyantran tathaa parivartan ke liye vidyut mashiinon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This was followed by the Mercury Arc Rectifier
 tatpashchaat nirvaat evam gas-bhare vaalvon kaa yug aayaa
 The development of SCR in 1957 gave a new direction to Shakti Electronics
 aajkal esasiaar, jitio, bijetti, mossphate, aijibiti aadi swichon ke prayog se atyant dakshata purvak vidyut-shakti kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Due to this, the field of power electronics has become very wide and important
 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation
 uparyukt ucchashakti rujukari main yaa to anek dhanagron ke liye ek hi runagra rahata he yaa anek dhanagar rujukari, jinke runagra jude rahete hai, prayog main laae jate hai
 Both types of minuscule are used
 motor kii chaal kaa niyantran kaagaj ke milon main vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki chaal par hi kaagaj kii motaai nirbhar rahati he
 In these devices, the electric current of the exciter field is changed, which produces the controlling area for the generator
 yah janitr ek prime mover dwaara chaalit hota he
 The armature of the generator gives its output to the motor whose speed has to be controlled
 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 a contact-circuit is used by this
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he
 The contact-circuit uses an electron tube called the "ignitron"
 ignitron ek vishesh prakaar kii gas-yukt nalee hoti he, jo ucch vidyut-dhara ko sanbhaal sakati he
 Its use is similar to a thyratron tube

 Yeast is a fungus
 yah sharkarayukta carbonic padaarth main bahutayat se paye jane vaala vishesh prakaar kaa kavak he
 It is a flowerless plant
 sharir mul, tana evam patti main vibhakt nahin hota he
 It has about 1500 castes
 saadhaaran vyakti ko yeast se vastu kaa bodh hota hai ki jise banane vaale goondhe aate main daalkar, use uthne or spanji banane ke liye chhod dete hai
 Only such spongy flours become spongy powder
 aise yeast saadharantaya tikiye ke rup main bazaaron main bikatein hai
 Larger microscopic unicellular plants remain from such yeast
 ye hi vaastavik yeast, yaa sackharomices, he
 Yeast is actually a class plant
 yah kavakon se samanta rakhata hai
 Yeast is found abundantly in the air
 yah ushnata, ardrata or aahaar ke abhaav main jivit rah saktaa hai or isaki kaaryashiltaa bani rahati hai
 But at 100 ° c it is destroyed by humid heat
 yah kinavan utpann karata hai
 For this reason, its practice has been going on for thousands of years in making Pavarotti, Sura or Beer etc
, although the reason for this was first discovered by Cagnard Delatur
 unhone hi siddh kiya tha ki yeast sajiv padap hai, jo mukulan prakriya se badhata hai
 Organic substances, especially starch and sugars, contain fermentation from yeast
 yeast koshikaon kii vruddhi ke saath saath unase anzime banate hai
 These are the enzymes diastase, the invertance and the jimes
 diastess starch ko vighatit karata, invartes ikshushrkara ko glucose or fructose main parinat karata or jimes glucose or fructose sharkaraaon ko alcodaul or carbon dioxide main parinat karata hai
 All these processes are done in the appropriate stage
 kinavan kaa upyukt taap 25 degree - 30 degree sein0 hai
 There are two types of trade yeast, one is dry and the other is compressed
 yeast ko makai ke aate yaa starch ke saath milakar tikia banaai jaati he or tab use sukhaya jaataa he
 This is dry butter
 is rup main yeast niskriy yaa prasupt rahata he or bahut kaal tak surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa hai
 It is activated by mixing with appropriate substances and then it is used
 sampidit yeast main praryaapt starch or ardrata rahati he
 This leads to kinevan in a short period of time
 yah yeast adhik samay tak surakshit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It is necessary to keep it in a cool place to keep it safe
 kuch vyakti apane kaam ke liye swayan apana yeast taiyaar karte he
 For this, grains of grains, especially barley, are soaked in water
 isse dane ankurne lagate hai
 After germination, the bacteria that make lactic acid in it are mixed and made acidic
 amleey banane kaa uddeshy use sadane se roka hota he
 The substance obtained in this way helps in the diet of yeast
 ab isamen yeast beej daalkar kinavan ke liye chhod dete hai
 Keep the temperature constant isse kinavan jald sampann hota he
 Now filter it in the filter press and keep it aside
 usamen starch milakar, dabaakar badi badi tikia banaate hai
 Small bites are obtained by its bite
 ab starch ke sthaan main makai ke aate kaa vyavhaar hone laga he
 Yeast is used in the preparation of Pavarotti, many different types of wines, brandy, husky, rum, beer, etc

 11 mahila kii aawaaj main, purush kii aawaaj main, ek prakritik sankhya he
 Before this comes 10 and after it comes 12, that is, eleven is one more than 10 and by reducing one out of 12, eleven is obtained
 ise shabdon main gyaarah se likhaa jaataa he
 The sum of six and five is eleven
 ganit ke aadhaar par dekha jaye to yah paanchavi sabase choti avibhajya sankhya he or do ankon vaali sabase choti avibhajya sankhya he
 Multiplying 11 by any binary number results in writing the same number and putting the sum of the same number in the middle, such as: lekin jab donon sankhyaon kaa yoga 9 se upar arthath dahaai ke ank main chalaa jaataa he to baayin ore kii sankhya main ek kii vruddhi kar di jaati he jaise: The above statement is a special condition of the Vedic Mathematics formula, multiple
 sanganak ke kunjeepatal par ek kunjee F11 hoti he kedii or vindos jo mozila firefox, opera web brouzar, google krom, internet oxplorer aadi ko purna screen or saamaanya avasthaa main badalane ke kaam aati he tathaa mike os athwa oes eks main sabhi khule hue windos ko chupaane ke liye kaam main liya jaataa he
 Although 11 is only a number, but like other places, the importance of this number is also related to the beauty of Hindi language
 jiske kuch udhaaharan nimna hai: Hindi Wikipedia's birthday is celebrated on 11 July
 iskaa pehla panna 11 july 2003 ko kinhin anamak sadsy ne banaaya tha jiskaa antim sampaadan 15 janvari 2007 ko mitul ji ne kiya tha
 The importance of eleven is also in numerology
 ank shaastra main sankhya 11 ek bahut hi jatil parinaam bhari sankhya he
 According to this, the people who have the number 11 are great planners and those who work with great impulse
 khanda shabd kaa bodh inamen se kisi bhi vishyon se ho saktaa he

 Generally, both males and females acquire dominant status to improve social status within a group
 aksar maadaaen hi alpha nar kaa chayan karti hai
 In order for a male chimpanzee to achieve alpha status, it is mandatory to obtain acceptance from females within the group because in reality they decide what kind of lifestyle to set
 There are many cases where a group of dominant females evict the alpha male for not meeting their preference and instead support another male who has them to lead the group as a successful alpha male Capacity appears

 "in this contrary reaction, Terrace now argues that Nim's use of ASL was not the adoption of a human language
 nim ne kabhi swayan baatcheet kii shuruyaat nahin kii, naye shabdon kaa istemaal shaayad hi kabhi kiya or logon ne jo kiya usne sirf uski nakal kii

 In the last word, the law sought to legalize marriage for those willing to abandon their profession of faith
 yah antar jati or antar-dharm vivaah main lagu ho saktaa he
 Overall, the response from local governments and administrators was that they unanimously opposed Maine's bill and believed that the law encouraged marriage based on lust, which would inevitably lead to immorality
 special vivaah adhinium, 1954 main puraane adhinium III, 1872 ko badal diya gaya
 The succession of property of a married person under this Act or of traditional marriages and their children registered under this Act, is governed by the Indian Succession Act

 aasaan shabdon main jab ham bionix ke bare main sochate hai to saadharantah aise kritrim baanh va taang ke bare main sochate hai jo maanav sharir main baahar se lagaai ja sake yaa phir aise samvedansheel upkarnon ke bare main sochate hai jinka aapng maanav sharir main ropan kiya gaya he
 Essential systems of life are powered by motors and sensitive equipment under a method called "bionics"
 yah maanav ke kshatigrast angon se kuch sandesh mastishk ko bhejte hai jisase ki manushya apane kaary kuch had tak swayan kar sake
 In a situation when any part of the body is damaged by a human misfortune or goes completely dysfunctional, what will be the solution with him? Unfortunately we do not have capabilities like lizard or starfish so that we can develop those arms, legs, etc
 again and bring it back to old form
 “stam sell” ke kshetra main kiya ja rahaa pareekshan iskaa upaay ho saktaa he
 But this method has not developed much yet
 atah iske bare main kuch bhi nishchit rup se nahin bolaa ja saktaa
 Till then, only artificial limbs can be a ray of hope and this is where bionics comes into view
 bionix kaa itihaas bionix kaa itihaas bahut hi pracheen he
 There is also a mention in the legend that how soldiers used iron parts instead of their damaged parts and went to war in battle-land
 parantu aaj ke paripeksh main bahut sari vidyaon or takneekon kaa sangyojan ho gaya he jaise ki robotics, baio-ejineering tathaa meigs jisase ke kritrim angon kii rachana main puri tarah se choti-choti baton ko dhyaan main rakhaa ja sake tathaa vah maanav koshikaaraon ke saath apana kaary kar sake
 In both the fields of medicine and electronics, short-form electrical organs, sophisticated micro-chips and developed computer schemes are all used to strengthen the weak human body
 yah vishisht maanav-mashin sambandh jis ke liye “bionic sharir” kaa naam uchit he, ne shaareerik aakshamataaon vaale insaanon ko kritrim angon, kritrim maans-peshiyon, kaanon main lagaai jane vaali mashiinon or duusare angon dwaara ek behatar jindagi jeene kii raah dikhaai he
 Artificial muscles: In the absence of meat, the body of a human body will appear to be a swinging structure of bones
 yah vichaar hi khaufnak he
 So is it possible to develop new muscles in the absence of meat muscles? There is a way - using EAP or "electroactive Polymer"
 yah praayah kritrim maans-peshiyon ke naam se jaani jaati he or shodhakartaaon dwaara maanav vikruttataon ko vash main karne ke liye prayog main laai ja rahi he
 Yosef Bar Cohan of the "NASA" laboratory is at the forefront of this research
 unhone bahuterey prayog kiye hai tathaa is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki yah paulimur vidyut ke prabhaav main aam maans-peshiyon kii tarah hi pratikriya dete hai
 Therefore, research is going on on their use in the human body and there is a possibility of their use in the future
 kritrim dil hamaara dil hamaare sharirake liye ingine kii tarah he jo hamaare vibhinn angon ko rakt pump kar rahaa he or unhen jivan pradaan kar rahaa he
 If this heart stops? Artificial development on the heart began around 1950 when the introduction of the "money macar" gave some relief to people with heart disease
 aaj ke “pas-maikar” bahut chote ho gaye hai
 By technical definition, "money-macers" send small electrical rays to the heart and facilitate the movement of heart beats while a physician controls the software of "money-macers"
 koi pareshaani hone par usko sandesh mil jaataa he or vah usko thik kar detaa he
 But now the whole artificial heart is possible
 abiomed dwaara viksit “abicor” dil kaa bahut saare marijon main ropan kiya ja chukaa he or yah prayaas kaaphi had tak safal bhi rahaa he
 In some patients, it has been successful in extending the life span to six months
 yah prayaas unheen marijon par kiya gaya he jinke bachane kii koi ummid nahin hoti
 Therefore, keeping them alive for a period of six months is an achievement

 inamen vah kshamta he jisase vah roshni ko vidyut aavegon main parivartit kar optic nerve se mastishk tak pahunchaate hai jahaan par us vastu kaa chitra banataa he
 But retinus pigmentosa and old age AMD, etc
 can lead to degeneration of healthy cells and after a period of time human can become blind
 parantu jab tak optic nerve swasth he tab tak phir bhi niraash hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin kyonki duniya bhar main shodhakarta chikitsak netra kii bimariyon se jujh rahe peediton kii drushti waapas laane ke liye prayatnsheel hai
 Optovionics of Naperville has developed an artificial silicone retina
 is kritrim retina main 2 mi

 Called Illinois, this microchip fits inside the eye and is made from 5000 microscope devices that can produce solar electricity
 yah upkaran aankhon main pravesh kar rahi roshni ko vidyut abhaason main parivartit karte hai
 These electrical sensations stimulate the rest of the retina's cells, allowing the human to have limited vision
 is disha main prayasarat ek or hasti hai - dow wiliam dobel, jinhone apni samarpit team kii madad se bahut saare netraheen vyaktiyon ko drushti pradaan kii
 His team has successfully created a brain-camera nexus that allows images to be placed on a computer in front of the eyes
 yah tasviren netraheen manushya ke mastishk main apressant dwaara ropit electrode par bhej di jaati hai
 Thus the dot matrix picture of the person or object presented in front of it is visible
 par is upkaran ke lagaataar prayog se us vyakti ko zyada vistrut chitra dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Role of bionics in the field of hearing There are innumerable follicular cells in the human ear, which are helpful in hearing, ie in hearing many voices
 parantu agar yah kshatigrast ho jaaen to dhwani shravan tantrikaon se mastishk tak nahin pahunch paaegi or is kami ko keval kokealear ropan se hi puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 There are innumerable electrodes in this plant that replicate the function of ROM cells, so that the information needed for hearing reaches the brain and helps in hearing
 melborn ke ek sanstha dwata kiye ja rahe anusandhan ke antargat ek boyonic kaan banaaya gaya he jo ki smart plastic naamak tatv main lapeta gaya he
 This element promotes the growth of nerves and cells in the inner ear
 maanav ko sahyog detaa bionix zyaadaatar manushyon ke liye hilanaa-dulana aasaan he
 But a person suffering from a disease called quadriplegia has to make a lot of effort to move even an inch
 hamane ab tak kritrim baaju or taang dekhe hai jo ki manushya ke sharir par upar se lagaae ja sakate hai parantu inkaa prayog bhi tabhi sambhav he arthath yah haath-paanv bhi tabhi hill-dul sakate hai agar tantrikas kshatigrast maans-peshiyon ko aisa karne ke liye prerit karen
 The efforts of Yoshiuki Sankai of Tsukuba University in Japan have led to such research which can prove to be a boon for people suffering from Maruraju, ie Spinal Card and other accidents
 shodhakarta vaigyanik ne das saal apana adipraaroop banane main lagaae
 This format, called HAL, is a bionic series
 is main ek computer or bydaree he jo ki motor se chalane vaale dhaatu exo scallyton ko shakti pradaan karata hai tathaa taangon ke saath baandhane par taangon ke sanchaalan main sahyog dete hai
 a similar bionic chain has also been developed for the upper part of man that can support the operation of the arms of man
 bionic neuron “super main” ke naam se jane janevaale christopher reeve or “wheel chair” se baddh profaisar stephen hawking kii vajah se tantrika vigyaan ke kshetra main shodh roshni main aayaa he
 It is a miracle that Reeve lived for so many years, even after being paralyzed from the neck down in an horsepower accident
 dow jerald lieb, jo ki dakshini celifornia kii ek vishvavidhyalay main praadhyapak hai, apni team ke saath bion naamak ek aisi takanic par kaary kar rahe hai jiskaa uddeshy lakwagrast maans-peshiyon main jaan foonkna he
 These bion are such electrical devices that can be injected into the human body with the help of a needle where it is needed
 isaki shakti kaa strot radio lahar he jise ki marij dwaara pahane gaye bahari niyantrak se samarth banaaya ja saktaa he
 a similar device was recently conducted under research at the University of South Ampton of a forty-six-year-old woman who had twice suffered a stroke and had an impact on her left side of the body
 yah upkaran uski baanh main lagaaya gaya tha jo ki use jaruri vidyut uttejnaa pradaan kar sake or uski lakwagrast maans-peshiyon ko puraani gatishiltaa praapt ho sake
 Brain-machine collaboration The human brain is a very complex device that a lot of research is going on to understand
 hamaare saare vichaar or gatividhiyaan isi se niyantrit hote hai
 If some parts of a handicapped person cease to function, but the mind remains functional, this fact can show scientists the path to live a fertile life by tantric signs to that man
 brainget ek aisi takanic he jiske dwaara ek laghu chip dimag main laga di jaati he jo ki manushya ke vichaar ek computer par bhej detii he or unheen vaicharik sanketon dwaara computer par i-mail bheji ja sakati he, computer par game khele ja sakate hai, sirf sochane maatr se hi
 If we carry forward the positive aspects of bionics in the future, then it can be used to advance human society and to improve human life
 audyogic sambandh ek bahu-vishyak kaary kshetra he jo rojgaar sambandh kaa adhyayan karata he
 Industrial relations are increasingly being called employment relations, due to the importance of non-industrial employment relations
 kai bahari log audyogic sambandhon ko shram sambandhon ke baraabar bhi maanate hai or samajhate hai ki audyogic sambandh keval sangathit rojgaar sthitiyon kaa hi adhyayan karte hai, magar yah ek atyadhik sarleekaran he
 The divergence of the personal objectives of the owner and the worker gave rise to the problem of industrial relations
 maanav kalyaan ke prashaadhan ke rup main ab udyogon ke samaajik uddeshy bhalee bhanti sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 This means creating conditions more conducive to work under which production can be streamlined, and an appropriate principle to define the action response between the two main production processes, capital and labor

 Initially, the workers considered it to be a catastrophe, but later they realized that their sorrows were almost permanent
 swami ke adhikarashetra main unke saamaajik evam bhautik abhaav din duune raat chaugune hote gaye or is prakaar donon ke sambandh is dhang ke na rahe jinhen kisi bhi praakar sadbhavnapurna kaha ja sake
 The problem continued to take a violent form day by day

 In the Middle Ages the area of trade was small and the masters and workers were in more close contact
 shramik swaamiyon se pruthak apni ek bhinn jati hi samajhate the
 Gradually he realized how small his personal strength was
 phir unki sthiti main or bhi patan hua jisase ve kritadas ke samaan ho gaye or antat: swami shramik kaa sambandh isi aadhaar par sthir hua
 The working class started establishing their union when the method of factories in production started

 se inhone kuch deshon kii raajnneeti par bhi apana prabhaav daalana aarambh kar diya or unke vartmaan evam bhavishya ko adhikadhik prabhavit karne lage
 The International Union of industrial-labor-unions was established in 1919 AD which included representatives of owners, workers and governments of 60 countries
 kuch europea deshon main maalikon evam shramikon ke sanghatan sarkari niyantran main le liye gaye
 During and after World War II, the governments of most countries consulted the representatives of the owners and workers in their affairs
 ab saamanyat: sabhi shramik desh ke liye apana mahatv samajhane lage hai or yah bhi jaan gaye hai ki unki sukhsuvidha antat: utpaadan ko viksit karne par hi avlambit he
 There are three aspects of industrial relations: science building, problem solving and ethics
 In the science building aspect, industrial relations is a part of social science and it seeks to understand employment relations and their institutions through high-quality, rigorous research
 
 is swabhaav main, audyogic sambandh vidvatta, shram arthshaastra, audyogic samajashaastra, shram or saamaajik itihaas, maanav sansaadhan prabandhan, raajnneeti vigyaan, kanoon evam anya kshetron main vidvatta se pratichchhedit hoti he
 In the problem solving aspect, industrial relations try to design policies and institutions to help the employment relationship work better
 The ethical aspect of the ethos incorporates strong normative theories about industrial relations, workers and employment relations, particularly by treating the working class as a useful commodity and encouraging workers to view themselves as human beings
 , Which has been named human rights in democratic communities
 audyogic sambandh vidvatta kaa maananaa he ki shram bazaar puri tarah se pratispardhaatmak nahin hai or is liye mukhyadhara aarthik siddhant ke vipareet, niyoktaaon ke paas vishisht rup se karmchaariyon se adhik saudebaazi kii shakti he
 Industrial relations scholarship also believes that at least some of the natural interests between employers and employees do not match, and therefore conflict in contrast to scholarship in human resource management and organizational behavior is seen as a natural part of the employment relationship
 isliye audyogic sambandh vidwaan aksar vibhinn sansthagat vyavastha kii visheshta kaa adhyayan karte hai jo rojgaar sambandh kaa charitra-chithran karti hai or use akruti detii hai - kaarobaari sataha par maanak or shakti sanrachanaon se lekar kaarysthal main karmchaaree aawaaj tantra, se ek company, kshetreey yaa rashtriya str main samuhik rup se vyavastha kii saudebaaji karne, se saarvajanik niti or shram kanoon ke vibhinn staron, se "poonjeevaad kii kismon", saamaajik loktantr or nav-udaarataavaad) tak
 When the labor market is seen as incomplete and when the interests in the employment relationship do not match, then one cannot expect the market or managers to always serve the interests of the workers and in extreme cases to stop the exploitation of the workers
 Industrial relations scholars and businessmen therefore support institutional interventions to improve the functioning of the employment relationship and protect workers' rights
 in sansthagat hastkshepon kii prakruti, haalanki, audyogic sambandhon ke do shiviron ke bheetar alag he
 The pluralist camp sees the employment relationship as a mixture of shared interests and conflicts of interests that are largely confined to the employment relationship
 kaarysthal main, bahulwaadi isliye shikaayat prakriyaaon kaa samarthan karte hai, karmchaaree aawaaj tantra jaise nirmaan kaary parishad or shram union, samuhik saudebaazi or shram-prabandhan bhagidaari
 niti kaaryakshetra main, bahulwaadi nunatam vetan kanoonon, vyavsaayik swasthya or suraksha maanakon, antarrashtriya shram maanakon, tathaa anya rojgaar env shram kanoonon env saarvajanik nitiyon kii vakaalat karte hai
 All these institutional interventions are seen as ways of balancing the employment relationship, which not only generate economic potential, but also employee equity and voice
 In contrast, the Marxist-inspired critical camp sees employer-employee conflict of interest as far-fetched and intensely resistant in the socio-political-economic system
 is drushtikon se, ek santulit rojgaar sambandh kii khoj niyokta ke hiton par bahut adhik vajan detii he or iske bajaay poonjeevaad ke bheetar nihit teevr pratirodhi rojgaar sambandh ko badalane ke liye sthaayee rup se baithe sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kii zarurat he
 Thus militant trade unions are often supported
 audyogic sambandhon kii jaden audyogic kranti main hai jisane hajaaron vetan karmchaariyon ke saath muft shram bazaar or vistrut audyogic sanghathanon ko janm dekar aadhunik rojgaar sambandh banaaya he
 Labor problems arose when society fought with these massive economic and social changes
 kam vetan, lambey kaaryakari ghante, samaswar or khatarnaak kaam or apmanjanak paryvekshi vyavhaar ucch karmchaaree vikray raashi, hinsak maar or saamaajik asthirataa ke khatre kii ore le gaye
 Intellectually, industrial relations were built at the end of the 19th century as a middle foundation between classical economics and Marxism, with Sydney Webb and Beatrice Webb's Industrial Democracy being the major intellectual work
 is liye audyogic sambandhon ne shastreey icon ko asweekaar kar diya
 Institutionally, Industrial Relations John R
 It was founded by the Commons when they created the first academic industrial relations program at the University of Wisconsin in 1920
 is kshetra ke liye shuruaati vittiya sahaayta jon di
 rockfilor, junior se ai, jinhone colorado main ek rockfilor-swaamitv koyale kii khan main khooni hamale ke baad pragatisheel shram-prabandhan sambandhon kaa samarthan kiya
 In Britain, another progressive industrialist, Montego Burton, held chairs in industrial relations in Leeds, Cardiff and Cambridge in 1930 and the discipline was formalized in the 1950s with the formation of the Oxford School by Alan Flanders and Hugh Clegg
 audyogic sambandh ek majboot samasya-sulajhane ke unmukhikaran ke saath bana tha, jisane shram samasyaon ke liye shastreey arthshaastriyon ke leses fere samaadhaanon or varg kranti ke marxvaadi samaadhaanon, donon ko asweekaar kar diya tha
 It is this approach that is the basis of new settlement legislation in the United States, such as the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act
 audyogic sambandh vidwaanon ne teen pramukh saidhantik drushtikon yaa sanrachanaon ko varnit kiya he, jo unki samaj or kaarysthal sambandhon ke vishleshan main vipareet hai
 The three views are generally known as monotheistic, pluralistic and democratic
 prayek kaarysthal sambandhon kii ek vishesh dharna pradaan karata he or isliye kaarysthal takaraav, unionon kii bhoomika or naukari viniman jaisi ghatnaon kii vyakhya alag tarah se karegaa
 The democratic approach is sometimes referred to as the "collision model", although this is somewhat ambiguous, as pluralism also seems to assume that confrontation occurs naturally in workplaces
 prajatantravaadi siddhant marxvaadi siddhanton ke saath prabhaavshaalee dhang se abhigyaat kiye gaye hai, haalanki ve in tak simit nahin hai
 In monotheism, the organization is seen as a cohesive and consistent whole unit with the ideal of "a happy family", where management and other members of staff all share a common purpose, emphasizing mutual support
 iske alaava, akeshwarwad kaa ek paitruk drushtikon he, jaha yah sabhi karmchaariyon kii vafadari kii maang karata he, vah jor dene or aavedan karne main mukhya rup se prabandhkeey hota he
 Consequently, trade unions are considered redundant because the loyalty between employees and organizations is considered to be mutually intact, where the industry cannot have two aspects
 The collision is considered obstructive and the irrational result of communication analysis, interpersonal friction and agitators
 bahulwaad main samajha jaataa he ki sanghathan shaktishaalee or vibhinn up samoohon se bana he, jisamen prayek kii apni vaid nishtha he or uddeshyon or netaaon kaa apana samucchy he
 In particular, the pluralism approach has two major sub-groups: management and trade unions
 natijatan, prabandhan kii bhoomika kaa jhukaav niyantrit karne or lagu karne kii ore kam hoga tathaa anunay or talmail baitaane kii ore adhik
 trade unionon ko karmchaariyon ke vaid pratinidhi ke rup main samajha jaataa he, takaraav samuhik saudebaazi se nipati jaati he or zaruri nahin ki use ek buree baat ke rup main hi dekha jaae, yadi prabandhit kiya jaae to vah vastav main vikaas or sakaaratmak badlaav kii disha main le ja sakati he
 This view of industrial relations sees the nature of capitalist society, where there is a fundamental division of interest between capital and labor and views workplace relations against this history
 yah drushtikon samajhataa he ki shakti or aarthik dhan kii asamantaaon kii jaden poonjivadi aarthik vyavastha ke swabhaav main hai
 Confrontation is therefore considered inevitable and is a natural answer against the exploitation of workers by trade union capital
 jab ki sahmati ke kai daur ho sakate hai, marxvaadi soch yah hogi ki sanyukt viniman ke santhaan prabandhan kii sthiti ko seemaabaddh karne kii bajaay badhayenge kyonki vah poonjeevaad ko chunauti dene kii jagah uski nirantarata kaa anumaan karte hai
 By many accounts, industrial relations are in crisis nowadays
 shaikshik vishwa main, isaki paaramparik jagah ek taraf mukhyadhara arthshaastra or sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kii pramukhataa dwaara or duusari ore aadhuniktaa dwaara khatre main he
 In policy-making communities, the institutional intervention of industrial relations is increasingly emphasized, the Neoliberal emphasis on the Lesser Fair promotion of free markets
 In practice, labor unions are declining and fewer companies have industrial relations functions
 audyogic sambandhon main shaikshanik kaaryakramon kii sankhya isliye sikudti ja rahi he or vidwaan anya kshetron ke liye yah kshetra chhod rahe hai, vishesh rup se maanav sansaadhan prabandhan or sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar
 kaam kaa mahatv, haalanki, pehle se kahin zyada majboot he or audyogic sambandhon ke sabak mahatvapurn hai
 The challenge for industrial relations is to re-establish these relations with the wider academic, policy and business world
