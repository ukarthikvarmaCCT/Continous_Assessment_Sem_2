 In mathematics, methods that check the convergence of infinite series are called convergence tests
 ye vidhiyaan sashart abhisaran, nirpeksh abhisaran, abhisaran ke interval yaa apsaran kii jaanch karatin hai
 Finding the definitive expression for s is not always easy
 at: ham yah jaanane ke liye ki koi vishisht shrenee abhisari he yaa nahin, abhisari or apsaari kii parikshavidhiyon kaa prayog karte hai
 If a series is composed of positive terms only, then {sn} after a term will be an incremental sequence and the necessary and sufficient agreement for the convergence of such an incremental sequence is that it is finite, that is, the existence of such a constant amount K
 That Sn <K for all values of n
 dhanatmak padonvaali shrenee ke abhisaran pareekshan kii vidhiyaan nimnlikhit hai : In this method, the positions of a sequence {an} { \ displaystyle \ left \ {a_ {n} \ right \ }} of another sequence {bn} { \ displaystyle \ left \ {b_ {n} \ right \ }} The positions are compared
 yadi, For all values of n, 0 ≤ an ≤ bn { \ displaystyle 0 \ leq \ a_ {n} \ leq \ b_ {n}}, and ∑ n = 1 ∞ bn { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} If ^ { \ infty} b_ {n}} converge then ∑ n = 1 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} will also converge
 kintu, yadi, For all values of n, 0 ≤ an ≤ bn { \ displaystyle 0 \ leq \ a_ {n} \ leq \ b_ {n}}, and ∑ n = 1 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} is divergent, then ∑ n = 1 ∞ bn { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} b_ {n}} will also be divergent

 a contact lens is a corrective, cosmetic, or therapeutic lens commonly placed on the eye's cornea
 1508 main kantact lainson kii pehali kalpanaaon ko samajhane or rekhaankit karne kaa shrey leonardo da vinci ko jaataa he lekin vaastavik kantact lainson ko banane or aankh par lagane main 300 varshon se bhi adhik lage
 Modern soft contact lenses were invented by the Czech chemist Otto Viktorli and his assistant Dryslav Lim, who also invented the gel used for their production
 kuch narm kantact lainson ko halke nile rang kaa banaaya jaataa he taaki saaf karne or rakhane ke gholon main ve aasaani se dikhaai de saken
 kuch cosmetic lainson ko aankh dikhaawat ko badalane ke liye jaanboojh kar rangeen banaaya jaataa he
 Nowadays, on some contact lenses, UV protective surface procedure is done to protect the natural lens of the eye from UV damage
 yah anumaan he ki vishwa bhar main 125 million log kantact lainson kaa prayog karte hai, jinamein se united stats main 28 se 38 million or japan main 13 million log hai
 The types of lenses used and recommended vary from country to country - more than 20% of the recommended lenses are used in Japan, the Netherlands and Germany nowadays, while less than 5% of people in Scandinavia use them
 
 log kantact lainson kaa prayog kai kaarnon se karte hai, jinamein akasar unki dikhaawat or kaaryashiltaa mukhya hoti he
 Compared to eyeglasses, contact lenses have less impact on moist weather, do not have steam, and provide a greater field of vision
 ve khelon kii kai gatividhiyon ke liye bhi upyukt hote hai
 In addition, eye disorders such as keratoconus and ancyconea cannot be cured with spectacles
 leonardo da vinci ko akasar kantact lainson kii kalpana ko prastut karne kaa shrey unki 1508 main prakashit kodex of da ai, minial di main karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 In which he described changing the strength of the cornea by immersing the eye in a bowl of water
 lekin leonardo ne yah salaah nahin di ki unki is kalpana ko drushti ke sudhaar ke kaam main laayaa jaae – unako to aankh ke samaayojan kii prakriya main adhik ruchi thi
 René Descartes introduced another idea in 1636, in which a test tube filled with fluid is placed in direct contact with the cornea
 iskaa ubhara hua sira drushti ko sudhaarney ke liye saaf kaanch kaa bana hua tha– lekin yah vichaar avyaavhaarik tha kyonki iske kaaran palak jhapakna asambhav tha
 In 1801, while conducting experiments related to the processes of adjustment, scientist Thomas Young created a fluid-filled i-cup that could be considered the ancestor of the contact lens
 ai-cap ke tal par yang ne micoscope kaa ek ipis lag diya
 But like Leonardo, Young's device was not designed to correct the defects of refraction
 sar jaan harchel ne encychlopedia metrpolitanaa ke 1845 ke ank ke footnot main drushti ke sudhaar ke do upaay prastut kiye – pehla, pashu kii jelly se bharaa kaanch kaa ek golakaar capsule or cornia kaa ek sancha, jise kisi paardarshee madhyam par dhaala ja saktaa tha
 Although Herschel never tested these ideas, they were later put forward by many independent inventors such as the Hungarian Dr
 Dalas, who devised a method of making living eye molds
 isse aankh ke vaastavik aakaar ke anukool lainson kaa pehali baar utpaadan sambhav hua
 In 1887 a German glassblower, F
E
 Müller produced the first cover of a transparent and tolerable eye
 german chakshuvisheshgy adolf gastan uzen fik ne 1887 main pehle safal kantact lens kaa nirmaan or prayog kiya
 While working at Zurich, he described the creation and application of apocal scleral contact shells that stick to the less sensitive edges of the tissue around the cornea - initially on rabbits, then on their own and finally In on a small group of volunteers
 These lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were 18–21 mm in diameter
 fik ne cornia / kelacity ke or kaanch ke bich kii khaali jagah main dextros ghol bhar diya
 He published his work, contactbrill, in a journal, Archiv fur agneh Nahilkunde, in March 1888
 fik kaa banaaya lens bada or baari tha or ek baar main keval kuch hi ghanton ke liye pahana ja saktaa tha
 Agitated Müller in Kiel, Germany, improved his own near-vision in 1888 with a more convenient glass-blower scleral contact lens he had built
 1887 main hi lui je jirard ne kantact lens ke ek aise hi scleral prakaar kaa avishkaar kiya
 Glass-blown scleral lenses were the only type of contact lens until the 1930s, when polymethyl methacrylate evolved, making plastic scleral lenses possible for the first time
 1936 main, aptometrist wiliam fenbloom ne plastic lens prastut kiye, jo adhik halke or suvidhapurna the
 These lenses were made of glass and plastic
 1949 main pehle corneal lainson kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These lenses were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they were applied only to the cornea instead of the entire surface of the eye and could be worn for sixteen hours per day

 The early corneal lenses were relatively expensive and brittle in the early 1950s and 1960s, which led to the development of a contact lens insurance market
 riplacement lens insorence, ink
 ne 1994 main kantacton ke saste or aasaani se badale ja sakane hone par apane mul utpaada ko band kiya
 One of the main inconveniences of PMMA lenses is that the conjunctiva and cornea do not get oxygen at all through the lens, which can have many side effects
 1970 ke dashak ke ant main or 1980 or 1990 ke dashakon main is samasya se nipatane ke liye oxygen pargamya lekin kadi vastuon kaa vikaas hua
 These were played by chemist Norman Gaylard in the development of permeable contact lenses
 Together, these polymers are known as hard gas permeable or RGP objects or lenses
 haalanki uparokt sabhi lainso ke prakaar –scleral, bimeme lens or arjipi – vastav main hard yaa rigid kehalaae jane chaiye, hard shabd kaa prayog aajkal moose bimeme lainson ke liye kiya jaataa he jo abhi bhi kabhi-kabhaar lagaae jate hai, jabaki rigid shabd ek aam shabd he jiskaa prayog in sabhi lens prakaaron ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 That is, hard lens is a subclass of rigid lens
 kabhi-kabhi arjipi lainson ke liye gas-pargamit pad kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo galat he, kyonki narm lens bhi gas-pargamya hote hai or unamem se oxygen pravesh karke aankh kii sataha tak pahunch sakati he
 The main discoveries in soft lenses were made by Czech chemists Otto Viktorli and Drahoslav Lim, who published their work in a magazine called Nature in 1959 for the use of hydrophilic gel for bio-use
 iske baad 1960 ke dashak main kuch deshon main pehle narm lens uplabdh hue or yues food and drug administreshan ) ne saflence padaarth ko 1971 main pehali anumati di
 Due to the immediate comfort obtained from soft lenses, these lenses were written more quickly than rigid lenses - in comparison it takes some time to get complete comfort from rigid lenses

 These new items presented the benefits of silicon - which has very high oxygen permeability - combined with the comfort and therapeutic performance of conventional hydrogels that have been in use for 30 years
 in lainson kaa prayog prarambh main adhik samay tak pahane ja sakane ke liye kiya gaya, haalanki haal main hi roj pahane jane vaale silicon hydrogel prastut kiye gaye hai
 a polar group is added to a molecule modified molecule without changing the structure of the silicon hydrogel
 ise tanaaka monomer kaha jaataa he kyonki ise japan kii menicon company ke kyoichi tanaaka dwaara 1979 main avishkrut or patent kiya gaya
 Second-generation silicon hydrogels
 Such as Galifilcon a and Senofilcon a use the Tanaka monomer
 vistacon ne tanaaka monomer main or sudhaar kiya or anya anu jode, jo ek aantarik namikaran agent kii tarah kaam karata he
 Comfilcon a was the first third-generation polymer
 patent yah daawa karata he ki yah padaarth bhinn aakaaron ke do siloxi macromaron kaa prayog karata he, jo saath main prayog kiye jane par bahut ucch oxygen pargamyata utpann karte hai
 Enfilcon a is another third generation substance that is naturally able to be moist
 enfilcon e padaarth 46% pani he
 Contact lenses are classified in different ways
 sudhaarak kantact lens drushti main sudhaar laane ke liye banaae jate hai
 In some people there is a disparity in the refractive power of the eye and the length of the eye causing a refraction error
 kantact lens is truti ko niskriy karke retina par prakaash ko sahi tarah se kendrit hone detaa he
 Diseases that can be cured by contact lenses include myopia, myopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia
 kantact pahanane vaale kantact ke brands yaa style ke anusaar roj raat ko yaa kuch dinon main ek baar apane kantact lainson ko nikaal kar rakhte hai
 Recently there has been renewed interest in arthrokeratology, in which the cornea is flattened overnight, leaving the eye without contact lenses or glasses during the day to correct myopia
 jin logon main rang ke vikaar hote hai unke liye laal-rang ke eks-krom kantact lens prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Although this lens does not bring back normal color vision, some colourants help people recognize colors better
 chromajen lainson kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or unamem raat ke samay drushti main kuch simaaen pai gai hai, haalanki anyathaa rangeen drushti main achachhaa sudhaar aata he
 An earlier study showed very good gains in color vision and patient satisfaction
 baad main kiye gaye ek randmiked, dabl-blind, plasibo-niyantrit adhyayan main in chromajen lenson kaa dislexicon main prayog kiya gaya jisamen dekha gaya ki bina lainson se padhane kii tulana main inase padhane kii yogyata main bahut achachhaa sudhaar hua
 This method has received FDA approval in the USA
 cosmetic kantact lens kaa kaam aankh kii dikhaawat main badlaav laana hota he
 These lenses can also improve vision, but there may be some blurring or obstruction of vision due to color or design
 uese main food and drug administreshan gaiyr-sudhaarak cosmetic lainson ko akasar sajaavati kantact lainson kii sangya detaa he
 Such lenses produce mild irritation at the time of applying, but are well tolerated after the eyes become accustomed to it
 kisi bhi kantact lens kii tarah, cosmetic lainson se bhi halki or gambhir jatiltaaon kaa jokham hota he, jinamein ankhon kaa laal ho janaa, kshobh or sankraman shaamil hai
 All people wearing a cosmetic lens are required to be under the supervision of an eye specialist to avoid complications of blindness
 theatre main prayukt kantact lens ek prakaar ke cosmetic kantact lens hote hai jo mukhyatah manoranjan udyog main akasar daraavnee or jombi filmon main ankhon ko asamanjas main or uttejk dikhaane, yaa unhen bhoot-numa, badali yaa jeevanheen dikhaane yaa pahanane vaale kii putliyon ko bada dikhaane, jisase lage ki pahanane vaala vibhinn tarah ke nashile padaarthon se prabhavit he, ke liye prayog main laae jate hai
 Scleral lenses are applied to the white part of the eye and are used in many theatrical lenses
 unke aakaar ke kaaran, in lainson ko lagaana kathin hota he or ve aankh ke bheetar acchhee tarah se nahin lagate
 ye drushti main bhi avrodh utpann kar sakate hai kyonki prayog karne vaale ke dekhne ke liye lens main thodi si jagah hoti he
 Because of this they cannot be worn for more than 3 hours as they can cause temporary obstructions in vision
 is tarah ke lainson ke sidhe chikitsakeey prayog hote hai

 Some lenses may make the star of the eye appear larger, or hide disorders such as star absence or wound
 japan or dakshin korea main ek nayaa chalan he, valayakaar kantact lens
 valayakaar lens bade dikhte hai kyonki ve na keval aankh ke taare ko dhankane vaale bhaag par hi rangeen hote hai balki lens ke adhik chaude bahari challe main bhi gahare rang ke hote hai
 This makes the star appear larger and wider
 haalanki kantact lainson ke anek brands halke rangeen hone se unka prayog aasaan hota he, aankh kaa rang badalane ke liye cosmetic lainson kaa prayog kaaphi kam hota he – 2004 main feet kiye gaye kantact lainson kaa yah keval 3% hi tha
 Cosmetic contact lenses can be dangerous for health
 narm lens akasar ankhon ke anavartaneey vikaron ke ilaaj or prabandhan ke liye prayog kiye jate hai
 The bandage contact lens protects the injured or patient cornea from constant rubbing of the eyelids, which helps it recover
 unka prayog bullas kerratopathy, shushk ankhon, corneal chhaalon or skhalan, cornia ke shoth, cornia kii sujan, dessemetocil, corneal actasis, murence ulcer, anterior corneal distrophy or neurotroffic kerratoconjuctivitis jaise rogon main kiya jaataa he
 Contact lenses that produce drugs in the eye have also been developed
 pehle kantact lens kaanch se banaae jate the, jo aankh main kshobh utpann karte the or lambii avadhiyon ke liye pahanane yogya nahin the
 But when William Fenbloom presented a lens made of polymethyl methacrylate, the contacts became much more convenient
 in piememe lainson ko aam taur par sakht lainso ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he 
 But PMMA lenses also have their own side effects
 lens main se cornia tak oxygen kaa sanchaar nahin hota, jisase kai avaanchit prabhaav ho sakate hai
 The late 1970s and the 1980s and 1990s saw the development of better hard materials - also oxygen permeable
 in polimaron ko samuhik rup se kade gas pargamya yaa arjipi vastuon yaa lainson kii sangya di gai he
 Tough lenses have an advantage, they do not absorb chemicals or smoke due to their pores
 Absorption of such compounds by other types of contacts can be a problem for those who typically face painting or other chemical processes
 kade lainson ke anek anuthe gun hote hai
 In fact it displaces the natural shape of the lens cornea by a new refractory surface
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek saamaanya kadaa kantact lens un logon ko drushti kaa ek acha str uplabdh kara saktaa he, jinhen drushtivaishamy yaa kerretoconus kii tarah bigade aakaar kii cornia ho
 While hard lenses have been available for nearly 120 years, soft lenses have only recently developed
 oto victorli dwaara narm lainson kaa avishkaar karne ke baad pehle narm lens kuch deson main 1960 ke dashak main prastut kiye gaye or 1971 main united stats epad ne saflence saamagree ko sweekruti di
 Soft lenses provide instant relief, while hard lenses take some time to get comfortable
 jin polimaron se narm lainson kaa utpaadan hota he unamem 25 varshon main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa he, mukhyatah polimaron ko banane vaali saamagree main parivartan karke unki oxygen pargamyata badhaane ke maamle main
 Some mixed hard / soft lenses are available
 ek vaikalpik takanic he, ek chote, kade lens ko ek bade, narm lens par chadhaanaa
 aisa vibhinn chikitsakeey sthitiyon main kiya jaataa he, jab ek akelaa lens aavashyak drushti kshamta, lagane ke gun yaa aaraam pahunchane main asamarth ho
 Silicon hydrogels became available in 1999
 Silicon hydrogels have the highest oxygen permeability of silicon and the comfort and therapeutic functionality of conventional hydrogels
 ye lens pehle mukhyatah bade hue ke upyog ke liye diye jate the, haalanki aajkal din main pahane jane vaale silicon hydrogen sweekrut kiye gaye hai or bazaar main utaare gaye hai
 Silicon increases oxygen permeability as well as produces intense hydrotherapy in the surface of the lens and reduces its ability to damp
 isse akasar lens ko pahanane par takalif or shushkta utpann ho jaati he
 Hydrogels are added to deal with the hysteria, which makes the lenses humidified
 lekin, lens kii sataha phir bhi jal-santraasak rah sakati he
 Therefore, on some lenses, surface transformers are performed by plasma treatments that change the hydrological nature of the surface of the lens
 anya prakaar ke lainson main aantarik punarnamikaarak agent milakar lens kii sataha ko ardratagrahi banaaya jaataa he
 a third process is to increase the damping by reducing cross-linking by using longer surface polymer chains without altering the surface or adding additional agents
 dainik prayog vaale kantact lens ko sone ke pehle nikaal lenaa hota he
 Long-term contact lenses are designed to wear continuously throughout the night, usually for 6 or more consecutive nights
 nai vasteen, jaise silicon hydrogen unhen lagaataar 30 raaton tak pahanane ke upyukt bana sakate hai
 These long-wearing lenses are called continuous wear
 saadharantah akstanded vier lainson ko ek nishchit avadhi ke baad phenk diya jaataa he
 They are becoming more popular due to their convenience
 in lainson ko adhik samay tak isaliye pahana ja saktaa he kyonki unamem adhik oxygen pargamyata hoti he, jo aankh ko swasth banaae ankhti he
 Extended lens wearers are at a higher risk of cornea infection and ulcers - mainly due to inadequate care and cleaning of the lens, instability of the tear film and deposition of bacteria
 The corneal neoplasms have also historically been the common problem of using extended lenses, although this problem is not seen in silicon hydrogel extended wear
 The most common problem with extended lens use is conjunctivitis - usually allergenic or giant papillary necrrhealitis, sometimes caused by a poorly placed contact lens
 anek uplabdh narm kantact lainson ko unhen pratisthapit karne ke kaarykram ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The shortest replacement program is a once-used lens, which is replaced every night
 pahanane ke samay tikaaupan kii kam aavashyaktaa ke kaaran kam pratisthaapak chakra vaale lens saadharantah patale or halke hote hai or isaliye apane varg or janareshan main sabase aaramdaayak hote hai
 These may be best for patients with eye allergies or other disorders, as they limit the accumulation of antigens and proteins
 ek baar prayog vaale lens un logon ke liye phydemand hai jo kantacton kaa prayog kabhi-kabhi karte hai yaa aise kaamon ke liye unka prayog karte hai jinamein unke gum ho jane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Most lenses are recommended to be discarded after 2 weeks or a month
 tremasik or vaarshik lens jo pehle bahut lokapriy the ab prayog main nahin laae jate hai kyonki kam dar vaala kaarykram patale lainson or kam jamaav ko protsaahit karata he
 Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and last for many years without changing
 piememe sakht lens bhi bahut tikaoo hote hai or saamanytah 5 se 10 varshon tak pahane jate hai
 The interesting thing is that daily disposable lenses are also often made by the same company from the materials used to produce long-term lenses
 lainson main keval vyas yaa aadhaar vakrata main hi bhinnata hoti he
 a spherical contact lens is the lens whose optical surfaces inside and outside are part of the ball
 toric lens ke kii ek yaa donon satahon kaa prabhaav selindrical lens ke samaan hota he or yah saamanyatangolakaar lens ke prabhaav ke saath hota he
 Myopic and farsighted people who also have astigmatism and who are not suitable for regular contact lenses can use toric lenses
 yadi keval ek aankh main astigmatismo ho, to rogi ko ek aankh main golakaar lens or duusari main toric lens lagane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Toric lenses are made from the same items used for regular contact lenses, but they have some additional properties: chashmon kii tarah, kantact lainson main bhi ek yaa adhik focal bindu ho sakate hai
 Multicentric contact lenses are almost always used to correct presbyopia or inadequacy of adjustment
 ekal drushti lainson ko monovijan naamak ek prakriya main bhi kaam me laayaa jaataa he
 a single vision lens corrects the vision of one eye and myopia
 vaikalpik rup se, koi vyakti duuradrushtita ke liye ekal drushti kantact lens or nikat drushti ke liye padhane ke chashme kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 Stiff gas permeable bicontinuous contact lenses typically have a small lens downstream to improve myopia
 jab ankhon ko padhane ke liye neeche kiya jaataa he, to yah lens drushti ke maarg main aa jaataa he
 In order to work properly, rgp's have to move in the vertical direction, so that the gaze gaze of the eye can be changed like binocular glasses to the farthest parts
 bahukendrik narm kantact lainson kaa utpaadan adhik kathin hota he or unhen lagane ke liye adhik kaushal kii jarurat hoti he
 All soft binocular lenses are called contemporary vision because correction of far and near vision is presented simultaneously on the retina regardless of where the eye is in any position
 beshak keval ek hi sudhaar sahi hota he or trutipurna sudhaar se dhundhalapan hota he
 Typically they are designed for correction of vision in the middle of the lens and correction of myopia on the periphery or vice versa
 aankh ke bheetar lagaae jane vaale lens, jinhen aropanyogy kantacch lens bhi kaha jaataa he, vishesh chote upachaarak lens hote hai jinhen shalya chikitsa se aankh ke pichley chambar main taare ke peeche or lens ke saamne adhik teevr nikat drushtita or dur drushtita ko thik karne ke liye aropit kiya jaataa he
 Most of the contact lenses are produced on a large scale
 haalanki kai companiyaan kantact lens banaati hai, yues main iske chaar mukhya utpaadak hai
 Prescriptions for contact lenses are usually given by eye specialists
 united stats, euke or austrailia jaise deshon main saadharantaya aptometrist yah kaam karte hai
 In France and Eastern European countries, opthalmologists play a key role
 vishwa ke anya bhaagon main, aptician kantact lainson ke nuskhe dete hai
 Contact lenses and eyeglass tips may be similar but are not interchangeable
 visheshgy yaa kantact lens fitre aankh kii pariksha ke samay vyakti kii kantact lens ke liye upyuktata nishchit karata he
 The health of the cornea is tested - eye allergies or dry eyes can affect a person's ability to successfully hold a contact lens
 kantact lens ke nuskhe main nirdisht maanakon main shaamil hai: Keep in mind that although the contact lens prescription specifies the diameter and base curve of the appropriate lens for the individual, many producers produce the lens only at a limited number of intervals

 Many people wear ordered lenses on the Internet
 united stats main, ferenes tu kantact lens kanjumar act jo 2004 main lagu hua, rogiyon ko kantact lainson ke nuskhe uplabdh karaane ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 By law, consumers have the right to get a copy of a contact lens prescription so that they can buy the lens from the shop of their choice
 Some controversy has arisen as to whether some online vendors are allowed to sell the lenses according to the prescription if the original recipe writer does not respond within 8 business hours as authentication messages are often sent at the time the business is closed for the recipe
 From which lenses can be made even on expired prescriptions
 kantact lens pahanane se hone vaali jatiltaayen kantact lens pahanane vaale logon main se kareeb 5% ko prabhavit karti hai
 Excessive use of contact lenses, especially overnight, is the cause of most safety concerns
 kantact lens ke pahanane se hone vaali samasyaayein aankh kii palak, netrashleshma, cornia kii vibhinn parton or aankh kii bahari sataha ko dhakne vaali aansu kii film ko bhi prabhavit karti hai
 Long-term contact lens side effects such as studies done by Xuguo Liu and others over 5 years of age have shown that wearing a contact lens for a long period reduces the thickness of the cornea and the curvature and surface
 Inequality increases
 kade kantact lens ko lambey samay tak pahanane se cornia ke kerretociton kaa ghanatv kam or upakalaa kii langerhans koshikaon kii sankhya bad jaati he
 Before touching contact lenses or eyes, it is necessary to wash hands with soaps that contain fragrance or allergens
 Soap should not be resistant to bacteria as it carries the risk of insufficient cleaning of hands and destruction of natural bacteria found on the eyes
 ye bacteria rogakaarak bacteria ko cornia main basane se rokte hai
 The technique of applying or removing a contact lens varies slightly according to whether the lens is soft or hard
 sabhi maamalon main lainson ko lagane yaa nikaalane ke liye prayogkarta ko kuch abhyaas kii jarurat hoti he, jisase apni ungali ke sire se aankh ke golak ko chune kaa dar dur ho sake
 Contact lenses are usually placed in the eye by placing the concave portion upwards on the index finger and then touching the cornea
 duusare haath se aankh ko khulaa rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Disposable soft lenses, in particular, can cause problems - if the surface tension between the lens and the finger is too high, the lens may reverse, or it may double
 jab lens kaa aankh se pehali baar sampark hota he, tab aankh ko uski aadat hone tak yaa lens par padi dhul ke kaaran thodi si der ke liye kshobh mahasoos ho saktaa he
 At such times, washing the eye can be beneficial but it should not be done more than a minute
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki haalanki kuch tarah ke kantact lainson main yah saralata se maaloom ho jaataa he ki aapane lens ko ulti ore se laga liya he, aap lens kii sahi sthiti kaa pataa pehle hi laga sakate hai
 For this, place the lens on the tip of your finger and squeeze its lower part with two fingers of your other hand - you will know the exact position if the lens ends have turned inward like a taco
 If they turn outwards, you will need to flip the lens
 But in some types of glass it is difficult because they look the same from both sides
 kai lainson ko aankh main lagane ke baad bhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki ve unhen ulta lagaaya gaya he
 This happens because the sight and feeling on both sides of these lenses are the same
 is vajah se kai log yah koshish karte hai ki ve pehle din se hi apane kantact lainson ko donon ore se dekhakar pahchaan len taaki jab unhen lage ki lens ulta lag gaya he to ve kabhi bhi use sahi tarah se laga saken
 lainson ko kabhi bhi ulta nahin pahananaa chaiye bhale hi ve aaraamdeh lagate hon or unase spasht kyon na dikhataa ho
 The soft needle is pulled out by holding the eyelids open and holding the lens with two fingers
 is tareeke se kshobh ho saktaa he, aankh ko chot lag sakati he or kai baar aisa karnaa, palak ke jhapakane ke kaaran kathin ho saktaa he
 If the lens is pushed through the cornea, it can bend, allowing it to be easily caught
 vikalp ke choop main, ek baar lens ko cornia par se aankh ke bhitari kone kii ore khiskaa dene ke baad use upree palak ko ungali se neeche kii ore dabaakar baahar nikaala ja saktaa he
 This method reduces the risk of touching the eye with fingers and is an easy method for people with long fingernails
 kade kantact lainson ko bahari kone par ek ungali se khinch kar or phir palak jhapaka kar lens ke aasanjan ko kamjor karke nikaala ja saktaa he
 The other hand is placed like a cup under the eye to hold the lens
 lainson ko nikaalane ke liye kuch chote upkaran bhi uplabdh hai, jo lacheele plastic se bane chote musakon ke jaise hote hai
 The concave end is lifted to the eye and the lens is touched, making the seal between the lens and the cornea stronger than the seal and the lens comes out of the eye
 haalanki dainik dispojable lainson ko saaf karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he, anya prakaaron ko niyamit safai or visankramit karnaa aavashyak hota he taaki saaf dikhaai de sake or lens kii sataha par biophils banane vaale bacteria, kavak or ekainshmoeba sahit anek sookshmjeevanuon se utpann takalif or sankramanon kii rokthaam kii ja sake
 There are many products available that can be used for this purpose
 kuch utpaadanon kaa prayog keval kuch vishesh prakaar ke kantact lainson ke saath hi karnaa chaiye
 It is necessary to check the label of the production to see what type of lens it can be used with
 kantact lens ko saaf karne ke liye keval pani kaa prayog nahin karnaa chaiye kyonki pani lens ko puri tarah se visankramit nahin kar saktaa
 kantact lens ko saaf karne ke liye pani kaa istemaal karne se lens dooshit ho saktaa he or kabhi-kabhi isse aankh ko na thik hone vaali haani pahunch sakati he
 It is also important to follow the production instructions to prevent eye infection or irritation
 iske alaava, kantact ke dibbon yaa lens ko pani yaa bahuuddeshiy ghol yaa hydrogen paraksaide se acchhee tarah dhonaa nahin bhoolanaa chaiye taaki uski satahon par biophilmein na banane paaen
 It is necessary to make sure that the production is not contaminated with microorganisms
 in gholkon ke paatro ke siron kabhi bhi kisi sataha ke sampark main na aana chaiye or prayog main na hone par paatr ko band rakhana chaiye
 Thyomarsal, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol and other compounds are added as preservatives in some products to prevent mild contamination of the product and eliminate microorganisms present on the contact lens
 1989 main kantact lainson se hone vaali samasyaon main se kareeb 10% ke liye thyomarsaal ko jimmedaar paaya gaya
 Products without preservatives deteriorate quickly

 a large part of current contact lens research is involved in the treatment and prevention of disorders arising from contamination of contact lenses and the building of foreign organisms
 chikitsakon dwaara aam taur par mana jaataa he ki kantact lens ke prayog kii sabase badi samasya jeevanujnya keretitis he or sabase aam sookshmjeevanu sudomonas airuginoja he
 Other bacteria are also the main cause of bacterial keratitis related to wearing of contact lenses, although their prevalence varies at different locations
 inamen anya jatiyon ke saath staphilokacal jati or stryptocokal jati shaamil hai
 Microbiological keratitis is a serious focal point in current research due to its severe effects, including blindness on the eye
 shodh kaa ek vishesh ruchikar vishay he, yah jaananaa ki sudomonas airuginoja jaise sookshmjeevanu kaise aankh main ghuste or use sankramit karte hai
 Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis has not been well understood, several different factors are being investigated
 kuch shodhakon ne dikhaaya he ki cornia main oxygen kii kami se sudomonas ke corneal bahyakala se sanyog, sookshmjeevanuon ke antareekaran tathaa shothakeey prakriya ke shuru hone ko badhaava miltaa he
 One way to reduce hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen the cornea receives
 haalanki silicon-hydrogen lens unki ati ucch oxygen pargamyata ke kaaran alpaxiyata ko lagbhag khatm kar dete hai, parmparik hydrogel narm kantact lainson kii apeksha ve bhi bacterial dooshan or corneal antahsancharan ke liye adhik prabhavi sthiti uplabdh karte lagate hai
 a recent study found that Pseudomonas aeruginoza and staphylococcal epidermis cling more strongly to silicon hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel contact lenses, and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginoza is 20 times stronger than staphylococcus epidermidis
 isse pataa chalata he ki sudomonas kaa sankraman sabase adhik kyon hota he
 Contact lens is another important part of research, patient acceptance
 Compatibility is a major issue associated with the use of contact lenses, because the lens and its cases are often contaminated when the patient is rejected
 bahuuddeshiy gholkon or dainik dispojable lainson kii uplabdhi se aparyaapt safai se utpann kuch samasyaon main kami ai he, lekin sookshmjivon ke dooshan ko rokane ke liye nae tareeke abhi viksit kiye ja rahe hai
 a silver-rich lens case is being made that can remove any contaminating microorganisms that come in contact with the lens case
 iske alaava kai sookshmjeev-pratirodhakon kaa vikaas kiya ja rahaa he jo swayan kantact lainson main pravishya kiye ja sakate hai
 Contact lenses containing selenium molecules have been shown to reduce the deposition of bacteria without harming the cornea of the rabbit eye, and contact lenses to a large extent reduce the adhesion of the actylglucoside bacteria used as surfactants
 ye yogic kantact lainson ke nirmaataaon or aptonetriston ko ruchikar lagate hai kyonki bacterial jamaav ke prabhaav ko prabhaavshaalee rup se rokane ke liye inke prayog ke liye rogi kii sweekruti kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti

 musolini ne unani dweep corfu ko jeetne ke liye ek yudhpot bheja or italvi sena ne 31 agast 1923 ko corfu par kabja kar liya

 According to the British, who were given the League of Nations A-mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; On the other hand, the new Turkish Republic claimed the province to be its own historical central part

 The League, however, now faced opposition from Lithuania and the Soviet Union, which had opposed any international force in Lithuania
 The League canceled the referendum and plans made for international force in March 1921 and came back to resolve the issue through negotiations between the two parties

 Following allegations of forced labor in the us-owned Firestone Rubber Plantation and US allegations of slave trade, the Liberian government asked the United Nations to launch an investigation
 The commission constituted for the investigation was jointly appointed by the Union, the United States and Liberia
 1930 main, sangh kii ek report main pushti kii gai ki das pratha tathaa jabaran mazdooree prachlit thi
 The report found many government officials involved in the sale of bonded laborers and recommended that they be replaced by European or American ones
 The Liberian government outlawed slavery and forced labor and sought US assistance, a move that provoked anger inside Liberia resulting in President Charles DB King and his vice-president resigning
 The League then threatened that a trusteeship would be established on Liberia until the reforms were implemented
 President Edwin Barkley's focus shifted to implementing these reforms

 Subject to the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government was empowered to deploy its forces to the surrounding areas of the Southern Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries through the Chinese territory of Manchuria

 However, Japanese soldiers claimed that the railway had been demolished by Chinese troops and in apparent retaliation occupied the entire territory of Manchuria
 unhone is kshetra kaa namakaran manchuko kiya or 9 march 1932, ko ek kathputli sarkaar china ke purv maharaja pu yi ke netritv main sthapit kii
 Internationally, this new country was recognized only by the governments of Italy and Germany, while the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China
 san 1932 main, japan kii vaayu or jal sena ne china ke shanghai shahar par bamavarsha kii, jisane 28 janvari kii ghatana ko chingaari pradaan kiya
 The League of Nations agreed to request the Chinese government, but the long sea voyage caused the members of the union to delay investigating the case

 Despite Japan's high reach in the Union, the report presented by Litton proved Japan aggressive and demanded that Manchuria be returned to China
 Before the report was voted on by the Legislative Assembly, Japan announced its intention to move forward in China
 san 1933 main report vidhansabha main 42-1 ke bahumat se paarit hui, parantu china se apni sena hataane ke bajaay, japan ne sangh se apni sadsyta waapas le lee
 According to the manifesto, the United Nations should have responded by imposing economic sanctions on Japan, or should have gathered the military and declared war against it
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi kaarywahi kii nahin gai
 The threat of an economic embargo became almost useless because the United States was not a UN member
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa aarthik pratibandh sangh apane sadsy rajyon par aropit karata tha vah aprabhavi ho jaataa tha, kyonki jab ek sadsy raashtra ko dusre sadsy raashtra ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye pratibandhit kiya jaataa tha to vah sanyukt rajya america ke saath vyapaarik sambandh sthapit kar letaa tha
 The League of Nations could gather an army, but major powers such as Britain and France were also complicit in their own affairs, such as control of their vast empire, especially after the upheavals of the First World War
 Manchuria was therefore left under Japanese control until the Soviet Union's Red Army captured the area and returned it to China after World War II

 In December of 1935, the hoare-lavelle Treaty was an attempt by British Foreign Minister Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Lavelle to end the conflict in Abyssinia, which proposed to divide the country into two parts - an Italian territory and An Abyssinia region
 Mussolini agreed to the treaty, but news of the deal was leaked, as a result the French and British public strongly opposed it and called the treaty an offer to sell Abyssinia
 Hoare and Lavelle were forced to resign from their posts and both the British and French governments separated from their respective peoples

 The situation was the same with Japan, the major powers' enthusiasm in dealing with the crisis of Abyssinia was not due to their belief that the fate of this poor and remote country which was inhabited by non-europeans could not be the subject of their central interest
 Huh

 On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army began a state-uprising, leading to a long-term armed conflict between the Spanish Republicans and the nationalists

 Union members, however, neither interfered in the Spanish Civil War nor prevented foreign intervention
 Hitler and Mussolini continued their support of General Francisco Franco's nationalist rebels and the Soviet Union supported the Spanish republicans

 The Allies were also bound by the Treaty of Versailles to try to disarm and the arms embargo that was imposed on the defeated nations was described as the first attempt towards worldwide disarmament
 sangh prasanvida ne sangh ko prayek rajya ke liye ek nirsreekaran yojana taiyaar karne ke liye nirdisht kiya parantu parishad ne is jimmedaari ko 1926 main gathit vishesh ayog ko 1932-34 ke vishwa nirastrikaran sammelan kii taiyaari karne ke liye saunp diya
 The members of the Sangh had different views on disarmament
 francisi apane shastron ko is guarantee ke bina kam karne ke liye anicchhuk the ki unpar akraman hone par sainik sahaayta mili
 Poland and Czechoslovakia felt insecure on the west side and wanted the members to be strengthened before aggressive action by the union and disarming them
 Without this guarantee, they would not reduce their weapons because they felt that the threat of invasion from Germany was too high

 The last important function of the Union was the suspension of the Soviet Union in December 1939 when it invaded Finland
 xxrep 4 - Cartoon from Punch magazine, 10 December 1920, ridiculed the space left by the US when it did not join the League of Nations

 Additionally, the US refusal to join the union limited the power of the organization

 It also tied the Union to the Treaty of Versailles, so that when the treaty became indistinct and unpopular, it also reflected in the League of Nations
 sangh kii tathakthith tatasthta ne ise anirnay ke rup main abhivyakt kiya
 It required a unanimous vote of its nine members, later fifteen council members, to pass an act; Therefore, decisive and effective work was difficult, if not impossible
 yah apane nirnyon par aane main dhimaa bhi tha kyonki kuch nirnyon main sampurna sabha kii sarvasammat manjuuri aavashyak thi
 This problem stemmed mainly from the fact that the main members of the League of Nations were not prepared to accept the possibility that their destiny would be decided by other countries and therefore, consequently, gave themselves the power to veto by implementing a unanimous vote
 sangh main pratinidhitiv aksar ek samasya thi
 Although it intended to include all nations, many never joined, or their partnership with the Union was too small

 Ruth Henning suggested that if the US had been a member of the Union, it would have supported France and Britain as well, presumably France would have felt more secure and such encouragement would have allowed France and Britain to cooperate more with Germany and this would lead to Nazi The rise of the party would have been less possible

 The structure of government in the US would have also made its membership problematic because its representatives in the Union would not have taken any decision on behalf of the American executive branches without the prior approval of its legislative branches

 The collective security system that the Union used meant that nations were required to act against states they considered friendly and in this way support states that had no general intimacy with their national interests
 There may be danger

 Foreign Office Minister Sir Eyre Crowe also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that "a serious union and contract" would be "just a treaty like other treaties": "what is there to ensure that it Won't break like other treaties? "
 Crowe expressed skepticism about the "pledge of common action" against the invaders because he believed that individual states' actions would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power
 He criticized the union's proposal for economic sanctions because it would be ineffective and was "a question of genuine military prominence"
 Crowe warned that universal disarmament was a practical impossibility

 Virtual memory is a type of computer system technology that gives a computer program the impression that it has a built-in memory
 jabaki vastav main ise prakritik rup se vibhinn hisson main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or discs storage main bahut adhik maatra main ho saktaa he
 Systems that use this technology make programming with large applications simpler and use real physical memory more efficiently than applications without virtual memory

 Conversely a large pool of memory is virtualized into smaller pools for different systems

 The definition of "virtual memory" is based on redefining the address space as contiguous virtual memory addresses to convert programs into thinking that they are using large blocks of contiguous addresses

 Embedded systems and other special-purpose computer systems that require very fast and / or very favorable response times may not want to use virtual memory due to reduced scheduling

 adhichitron ko dwitiyak storage se praathmik storage main aage peeche karne ke liye program jimmedaar tha
 Therefore, the main reason for introducing virtual memory was not only to expand primary memory, but to make such expansion as simple as possible for programmers to use

 Apart from this, it initially slowed down memory access a bit
 There were also concerns that the new system using secondary storage — the comprehensive algorithm — would be much less effective than the application-specific method used earlier

 Almost all implementations of virtual memory divide the virtual address space of an application program into pages; a page is a block of attached virtual memory addresses
 pejon ke aakaar aam taur par kam se kam 4K bite hote hai or bade virtual memory adreson vaali pranaliyaan yaa vaastavik memory ke bahut bade pariman aam taur par bade aakaar ke pejon kaa upyog karte hai
 Almost all implementations use page tables to convert virtual addresses viewed by application programs to physical addresses that are used by hardware to process instructions
 prishth sarini main prayek pravishti yaa to virtual pej ke liye vaastavik memory adress, jahaan pej ko sanchit kiya jaataa he, yaa ek suchak ki pej ko vartmaan main ek discs fil main rakhaa gaya he, main ek maanchitran shaamil hota hai
 Systems may have a single page table for the entire system or separate page tables for each application
 yadi aisa keval ek hi hota he, to ek hi samay main chalane vaale vibhinn aplikeshan ek hi virtual adress spes kaa saath-saath prayog karti hai, arthath ve ek hi anukram vaale virtual adreson ke vibhinn bhaagon kaa prayog karte hai
 Systems that use multiple page arrays provide multiple virtual address spaces - concurrent applications assume they are using virtual addresses with the same sequence, but their individual page tables redirect to different real addresses
 Huh
 yadi, kisi nirdesh ko nishpadit karne ke samay, ek CPU ek khaas virtual adress main sthit ek nirdesh praapt karata he, ek vishisht virtual adress se aankada praapt karata he yaa kisi khaas virtual adress main aankada sangrah karata he, to virtual adress ko sangat bhautik adress main roopantarit kiya janaa chahie
 ise ek hardware avyav ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jise kabhi-kabhi ek memory prabandhan ikai kaha jaataa he
 It searches for the actual address corresponding to the virtual address and sends the actual address to the parts of the CPU that execute the instructions
 yadi prishth sarini yah suchit karata he ki virtual memory pej vartmaan main vaastavik memory main nahin he, to hardware ek prishth dosha apwaad utpann karata he jo oparating system ke prishthan paryvekshak ghatak shuru karata he 
 This part of the operating system prepares and manages the page tables
 yadi gatisheel adress roopantaran hardware ek prishth dosha apwaad utpann karata he, to aavashyak virtual adress vaale pej ke dwitiyak storage main pej spes ki khoj karata he, ise vaastavik bhautik smriti main padhata he, virtual adress ke nae sthaan ko darshane ke liye prishth sarini kaa navinikaran karata he or ant main gatik adress roopantaran ko pun: khoj shuru karne ke liye kahata he
 Usually all real physical memory is already in use, and the paging supervisor must first save a portion of the actual physical memory in the disk and upgrade the page table to indicate that the corresponding virtual address is now the actual physical Not in memory but saved in disk
 prishthan paryvekshak aam taur par vaastavik bhautik memory vaale un hisson ko seve karte hai or unka adhilekhan karte hai jinka haal hi main upyog kiya ja chukaa he, kyonki sambhawatah ye vaise kshetra hai jinka aksar kam se kam upyog kiya jaataa he
 So each time the dynamic address conversion hardware matches a real physical memory address, it must put a stamp of time in the page table entry for that virtual address
 sabhi virtual memory systamon main memory vaale kshetra hote hai jo "jakde hue" hote hai, arthath unhen dwitiyak storage main sthanantarit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye: In MVS, z / OS and similar oses, parts of system memory are managed in the virtual = real method, where each virtual address corresponds to a real address
 ve hai: ibm's initial virtual memory system was the only way to hold virtual = real mode pages
 z / OS main 3 mod hote hai, v = V, V=R or V=F 
 Some systems, such as Burroughs Large Systems, do not use paging to implement virtual memory
 iske bajaay, ve vibhaajan kaa upyog karte hai, taaki kisi aplikeshan ke virtual adress spes ko char lambaai ke khandon main vibhajit kiya ja sake
 ek virtual adress main ek khand sankhya or khand ke bheetar ek ofaset hota he
 Memory is still physically expressed by a single number
 ise praapt karne ke liye, ek khand vivarnak kii khoj karne ke liye procesar khand sarini main khand sankhya kii khoj karata he
 The chunk descriptor contains a marker indicating whether the chunk is present in main memory and, if so, the address and chunk length in main memory at the beginning of the chunk
 yah jaanch karata he ki khand ke bheetar ofaset ki lambaai khand ki lambaai se kam he yaa nahin or, yadi aisa nahin he, to kya koi avrodh utpann hota he
 If a chunk does not exist in main memory, a hardware interrupt is generated in the operating system, which allows the chunk to read a chunk in main memory or move a set of paged data from supporting storage to actual storage during implementation
 Can try
 khand ko padhe jane ke liye mukhya memory main jagah banane hetu oparating system ko mukhya memory main se anya khandon ko hataanaa pad saktaa he
 In particular, the Intel 80286 supported a similar partitioning scheme as an option, but was not used by most operating systems
 vibhaajan or prishthan kaa sammishran karnaa, aamtaur par prayek khandon ko prishthon main vibhajit karnaa sambhav he
 In systems that combine them, such as Multics and IBM System / 38 and IBM System i machines, virtual memory is typically implemented with paging, in which partitions are used to provide protection to the memory
 intel 80386 or baad main IA-32 processron ke saath, khand ek 32-bit vaale raikhik prishthan vaale aderes spes main sthit rahete hai
 So the segments can be moved in and out of that linear paged address space
 isse virtual memory ke do star milte hai; haalanki bahut kam hi oparating system aisa karte hai
 Instead, they only use paging
 prishthon or khandon kaa upyog kar virtual memory ke karyanvayan main antar na keval kramash: nishchit or char aakaaron ke dwaara memory ke vibhaajan se sambandhit he
 In some systems, such as Multics, or later in System / 38 and Prime Machines, as a semantics of a memory model, segmentation actually appeared in user processes
 duusare shabdon main, us ek prakriya ke badale main jisamen ek memory hota tha jo bits yaa shabdon ke ek bade vector ke jaisaa dikhaai detaa tha
 It was more structured
 yah prishthon ke prayog karne se bhinn he, jo prakriya main dikhaai dene vaale model ko nahin badalata he
 This resulted in significant results
 khand na keval "char lambaai vaala ek prishth", yaa aderes spes kii lambaai ko badhaane kaa ek ek sidhaa tarika nahin tha 
 multics main, vibhaajan ek bahut shaktishaalee tantra tha jiskaa upyog ek ek-stareey virtual memory model pradaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha, jisamen "process memory" or "file system" ke bich koi antar nahin tha - ek 'praprocess active adress spes main keval khandon ki ek soochi hoti thi jinhen iske sambhavit adress, code or data, donon main pratichitrit kiya jaataa tha
 This was not the same as the later mmap mechanism in Unix, because differential file pointer prompts do not work when mapping files in semi-arbitrary locations
 multics main adhikansh nirdeshon main nirmit aise patabhigaman mod the
 In other words, it could have completely eliminated the need for a linker by executing a restored inter-clause reference
 yah us samay bhi kaam karata tha jab vibhinn prakriyaayein ek hi file ko vibhinn sthanon main unke nijee adress speson main pratichitrit karata tha
 All implementations need to avoid a problem called "thrashing", where the computer spends too much time shuffling blocks of virtual memory between real memory and disk and therefore seems to work slowly
