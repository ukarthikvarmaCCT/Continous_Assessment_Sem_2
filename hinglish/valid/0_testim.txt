 The original Greek word that was used was pithos, which is a large jar, sometimes as large as a small human being told that it would sleep one at a time)
 iskaa upyog wine, tel, anaaj, yaa anya saamagree ke bhandaran ke liye, yaa, dharmik rup se maanav sharir ko dafanaane vaale ek paatr ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 In Pandora's case, this jar was made of sugar clay to store common senses in it, or made of bronze metal, which could be used as a non-retractable gel
 pithos kaa galat anuwaad 16 shatabdi ke maanavtaavaadi rotardam ke irasmus ke dwaara kiya gaya jinhone pandora kii hesiod kahani kaa latin main anuwaad kiya
 Erasmus linked the word Pithos to the Pyxis of Latin; Which means "box"

 1 were tantra bhartiya upmahadweep kii ek vaividhtapurna evam sampann aadhyatmik paripati he
 Different types of thoughts and activities come under the system
 tanyate vistaaryate gyaanan anen iti tantram - arthath gyaan ko iske dwaara tanakar vistaarit kiya jaataa he, yahi tantra he
 Its history is very old
 samay ke saath yah paripati anek parivartanon se hokar gujri he or samprati atyant dakiyanoosee vichaaron se lekar bahut hi pragat vichaaron kaa sammishran he
 The system has existed in various forms in India, Nepal, China, Japan, Tibet, Korea, Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Mongolia
 bhartiya tantra sahitya vishaal or vaichitryamay sahitya he
 It is ancient and also extensive
 vaidic vaanmay se bhi kisi kisi ansh main isaki vishalata adhik he
 The treatise called Charanavuyah gives a small introduction to Vedic literature, but the Vedic literature available in comparison to Tantra literature seems to be a simple way
 tantric sahitya kaa ati pracheen rup lupt ho gaya he
 But from the introduction of its expansion, it can be inferred that in ancient times it was more than Vedic literature and also Vichitra
 sankshep main kaha ja saktaa he ki param advait vigyaan kaa sookshmatisookshm vishleshan or vivaran jaisaa tantra granthon main he, vaisaa kisi shaastra ke granthon main nahin he
 At the same time, it is also true that the description of the use of the higher, subjugated Prabhriti petrology is also found in the system
 spashtat: vartmaan hindu samaaj veda-ashrith hone par bhi vyavhaar-bhoomi main vishesh rup se tantra dwaara hi niyantrit he
 'tantra' and 'agam' are both synonyms
 kisi-kisi sthaan main aagam shabd ke sthaan main, 'nigam' shabd kaa bhi prayog dikhaai detaa he
 Yet it is true that to understand Tantra, the word Agama used to behave in the form of 'word-proof' i
e
 in the form of an expression
 angreji main jise, revillation, kehete hai, ye aagam praaia: vahi hai
 There is no doubt that supernatural favorites are more important than secular optimists
 veda jis prakaar hiranyagarbha athwa brahm ke saath sanshlisht he, usee prakaar tantra mulat: shiv or shakti ke saath sanshlisht he
 Just like Shiva, there are different forms of Shakti
 bhinn roopon se vibhinn prasthaanon ke tantro kaa aavirbhaav hua tha
 Similarly, according to Shaiva and Shakta Tantra, there is also Vaishnava Tantra
 'pancharaatr', athwa 'satvat', aagam isi kaa namaatar he
 There is also the spread of Agama according to its stream in the sects like Ganapati and Solar etc
 of Vaishnava
 dow shreder ne 'ahirbudhnya samhita' kii bhoomika main pancharaatr aagam ke vishay main ek utkrisht niabandh prakashit kiya tha,jisase pataa chalata he ki vaishnav aagam kaa bhi ati vishaal sahitya he
 But here, instead of some detailed criticism about the Vaishnava system, criticism of Shaiva and Shakta Agamas is presented
 vaise to tantra ek samaangi paripati nahin kahi ja sakati kintu tantric sahitya main- Basic Tantra literature can generally be divided into three parts- vistrut vivaran ke liye pracheen tantra sahitya dekhen
 For more details, see Secondary Mechanism-literature
 vistrut vivaran ke liye tantrasahitya ke vishisht acharya dekhen
 Most Hindu texts have not been translated
 lekin vigyaan bhairav tantra iskaa apwaad he jiske anekanek anuwaad hue hai
 Sir John Woodroff translated the Mahanirvanatantra into English in 1913
 iske saath hi unhone kai anya tantra granthon kaa bhi anuwaad kiya
 Apart from this, Malinivijayottantantra, Kiranantra, and Parakhyantra have also been translated into western languages
 2068 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2068 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2068 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 devibhagwatpuranam Relational Theory Introduction to Specific Relativity vishisht aapekshikta siddhant athwa aapekshikta kaa vishisht siddhant gatisheel vastuon main vaidyutsthitiki par apane shodh-patr main albert oinstin ne 1905 main prastaavit jadtviya nirdesh tantra main maapan kaa ek bhautik siddhant diya
 Galileo Galilei recognized that all similar motions are relativistic and that nothing here is absolute and nothing is even at rest, which is now called the relative principle of Galileo
 oinstin ne is siddhant ko vistaarit kiya, jiske anusaar prakaash kaa veg nirpeksh va niyat he, yah ek aisi ghatana he jo mikelson-morle ke prayog main haal hi main drushtigochar hui thi
 He also gave an epiphany that all these physical laws, all the laws of mechanics and electrodynamics, whatever they are, remain the same
 is siddhant ke parinaamon kii sankhya vrahat he jo praayogic rup se prekshit ho chuke hai, jaise- samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan or samakshanikta
 This theory has changed the concept of nocturnal time interval and has given rise to new concept like nocturnal time period
 is siddhant ne krantikari dravyaman-urja sambandh E=mc2 diya, jahaan c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he, yah sutara is siddhant ke do abhigruhiton sahit anya bhautik niyamon kaa sayukt rup se vyutpan he
 The predictions of relativity theory simply refer to the result of notable physics, especially when the velocity of an observable object is negligible compared to the velocity of light
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar prakaash kaa veg c kisi pariklpana kaa veg maatr nahin he jaise vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa veg balki samshti va samay ke ekikaran kaa dik-kaal ke rup main karne ke liye ek moolbhoot lakshan he
 One consequence of this theory is that any object or particle whose break mass is not zero cannot be accelerated to the velocity of light under any circumstances
 is siddhant ko vishisht kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki yah siddhant keval jadtviya nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hota he
 a few years later, a comprehensive theory of general relativity was given, which works on broad coordinates and also helps in understanding gravity
 —albert oinstin : aatmakathaatmak tippaniyan Einstein made two basic propositions that seem to be the most correct, ignoring the absolute validity of the laws of the then mechanics and electrodynamics
 yah prastaav prakaash ke veg par nirbhar or bhautik niyamo va jadtviya nirdesh tantra se swatantra the
 He mentioned these identities in his first presentation in 1905
 vishisht aapekshikta kii vyutpatti na keval uparokt do abhigruhiton par he balki samshti kii samdaishikata va samarupata, chad maapan kii swatantraaa or apane ateet ke itihaas se ghadiyaan sahit vibhinn nihit pariklpanaaon par nirbhar karti he
 According to Einstein's original presentation on specific relativity in 1905, various postulates derived by different variable derivation methods have been given
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar koi bhi nirdesh tantra nirpeksh nahin hoti
 The stationary instruction system on Earth is not an inertial direction system because it also rotates with the rotation speed of the Earth
 ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra ke saapeksh niyat veg se gatisheel nirdesh tantra bhi jadtviya hota he
 Hence the hypothesis of absolute inertial reference system is unfounded
 mana nirdesh tantra s main dik-kaal nirdeshaank hai or nirdesh tantra S′ main nirdeshaank hai
 Then according to Lorenz transformation these coordinates can be determined by the following relations: jahaan Lorenz is the multiplier and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and the velocity of the reference system s ′ is parallel to the v x-axis
 y or z nirdeshaank prabhavit nahin hai; keval x or t nirdeshaankon kaa sthaanantaran hota he
 There is nothing special in the x-axis, the transfer can also apply to the y or z axes, or in any direction that is parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion
 ek raashi jo lorenj roopantaran main nishchar rahati he lorenj nishchar kehalaati he
 On writing Lorenz transform and its inverse in different coordinates, where one is the coordinates of one event and the other is coordinates of the event and then their intervals are defined as follows: atah ham likh sakate hai Results of specific relativities can be derived from Lorenz equations
 ye roopantaran or vishisht aapekshikta bhi, newtoneey parinaamon se bhinn parinaam dete hai jab saapeksh veg kaa maan prakaash ke veg kii koti kaa ho
 The velocity of light is much higher than any man-made conferences, which some effects were achieved by specific relativity
 samakshanikta, samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan jaise udhaaharan praayogic rup se siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 Two different phenomena that are similar in one inertial reference system may be not analogous to the observer located in the other inertial reference system
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran kii pratham sameekaran Here it is clear that those instructions are symmetric in system S, not necessarily the other directive system in s ′
 yadi ye ghatnaayen nirdesh tantra s main samasthani hai, tab wo duusare nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hongi
 The time between any two events from one observer to another observer is not fixed, but depends on the speed of the observer
 mana kii ek ghadi nirdesh tantra s main viramavastha main he
 Two different tick-ticks of this clock can be represented by Δx = 0
 in donon tik ke madhya samay kaa maapan donon tantron main kiya jaataa he, iske liye pratham sameekaran nimna prakaar praapt hua : This shows that the time difference between the two ticks was higher in the instruction system in which the clock was in motion than in the instruction clock
 samay vistaaran kii sahaayta se ham kai bhautik pariklpanaaon ko samaj sakate hai jaise prithvi ke vayumandal main brahmand kirnon se janit muono kii kshay dar
 The measurement of the dimensions of an object by one observer may be different from the measurement observed by another observer
 isi prakaar, mana rekhak viramavastha main nirdesh tantra s main x-aksh kii taraf sanrekhit he
 In this system, the length of the linear is written as Δx
 rekhak kii lambaai kaa maapan S' nirdesh tantra main karne par jisamen ghadi gatisheel he jahaan chad ke chhoron par x′ kaa maapan S' tantra main samakshanik kiya jaataa he
 In other words, this measurement was done in Δt ′ = 0, which can be coupled by the fourth equation to establish the following relation in lengths Δx and Δx ′: isse spasht hota he ki nirdesh tantra jisamen chad gatisheel thi main chad kii lambaai kaa maan iske swayan ke viraam nirdesh tantra se kam he
 They are not simply added for the connection of velocities
 yadi nirdesh tantra s main prekshak ke anusaar koi vastu x aksh kii ore veg u se gatisheel he, to nirdesh tantra S′ jo nirdesh tantra s ke saapeksh x-aksh kii or v veg se gati kar rahi he main sthit prekshak dwaara prekshit gatisheel vastu kaa veg u' he jahaan : Other instructions observed in the system: yahan dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vastuen jo nirdesh tantra s main prakaash ke veg se gatisheel hai tab vah vastu nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi prakaash ke vag se gatisheel hogi
 If the values of u and v are very low relative to the velocity of light, we get spontaneous galactic conversions of velocities
 saamaanya udahaaran jo diya jaataa he vah yah he ki ek train purv disha kii or patariyon ke saapeksh v veg se gati kar rahi he
 a child who is sitting inside a train threw a ball eastwards and with a velocity u relative to the train
 chirsmmat bhautikee main, patariyon par viramavastha main par sthit prekshak gend kaa veg kaa maan purv disha main u = u′ + v prekshit karegaa, jabaki vishisht aapekshikta yah satya nahin he; balki gend kaa veg purv disha main duusari sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : u = / 
 Again, there is nothing special for x or east direction
 ye sutara kisi bhi disha main lagu hogen jiske liye hamen saapeksh veg v ke paraspar samaantar va lambavat gatiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Einstein's law of combining velocities was found to be correct in the Fitzau experiment, which measured the velocity of light relative to a moving fluid parallel to the velocity of light
 lekin aaj tak kisi bhi prayog ne asamaantar gati ke vyapak rup ke liye sutara kaa parikshan nahin kiya
 Thomas precursor, also known as Thomas Rotation, is a relative refinement applied to the rotation of particles
 kisi vastu kaa abhivinyas vibhinn prekshkon ke liye bhinn ho saktaa he
 Unlike other relative effects, this effect is also meaningful at very low velocities, as can be seen in the movement of moving particles
 jaise-jaise kisi vastu kii chaal prekshak ke drushtikon se prakaas ke veg ke samakaksh pahunchati he, to iske aapekshik dravyaman bhi badhata he jisase iskaa twarit hona or adhik kathin ho jaataa he, yah sab prekshak ke nirdesh tantra se prathit hota he
 In the break state, the energy value of an object is mc2 where m is the mass of the object
 urja sarankshan ke niyam se kisi bhi kriya main dravyaman main kami kriya ke pashchaat isaki gatij urja main vruddhi ke tulya honi chahie
 Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking its kinetic energy into it
 iske alaava uparokt ke sandarbh - lorenj roopantaran ko vyutpann karte hai or vishisht aapekshikta kii vyakhya - tulyata ke liye swa anubhavik tark dete hue ainstin ne bhi kam se kam chaar paper likhe
 The mass-energy equivalent is a consequence of specific relativity
 newtoneey yantriki main jahaan urja or samveg bhinn bhautik rashiyaan hai vishisht aapekshikta main ek chatursadish kaa nirmaan karte hai or yah samay ghatak ko samshti ghatak se sambandhit karata he
 An object located in the resting state is an energy mass quadrature: its time component is energy and the other three macro components are zero
 x-aksh disha main alp veg v ke saath lorenj roopantaran ke saath nirdesh tantra badalane par urja-samveg chatursadish hoga
 The value of momentum will be the same as the value obtained by dividing the product of energy and velocity by c2
 jaise kisi vastu kaa newtoneey dravyaman, jo nimna vegon ke liye samveg va veg ke anupaat ke saamaan hota he, e / c2 ke baraabar hoga
 Energy and momentum are the net property of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to conclude that they will be automatically obtained in quadrangular form from two fundamental identities of specific relativity, because they do not tell about matter or radiation, but rather about the macro and time
 Explains about atah isaki vyutpati ke liye adhik bhautik gyaan kii aavashyaktaa he
 For this, Einstein used the additional principle according to which the mechanics at low velocities yield perfect results, so at low velocities only the energy scalar and three-momentum vector are there
 isse aage unhone pariklpana di ki prakash kii urja or aavruti samaan dopler visthaapan ghatak se roopantarit hoga, jise usne maxwell samikarnon dwaara pehle hi satya siddh kar diya tha ainstin dwaara 1905 main prakashit pratham paper kaa vishay "kya kisi pind kaa jadtv us urja par nirbhar karata he? " tha
 Although Einstein's argument in the paper is accepted by physicists as true almost universally without any proof, and many authors have suggested for the last few years that this is false
 anya lekhakon ke anusaar yah kathan kaaphi anirnaayak tha kyonki yah kuch antarnihit manyataon par aadhaarit tha
 Einstein admitted that his 1907 article on specific relativism disputed its derivatives
 vahaan unhone mahasoos kiya ki anumaanit urja-dravyaman tark ke liye maxwell samikarnon par bharosa karnaa samasyatmak he
 His paper published in 1905 argued that massless particles could be emitted, but according to the Maxwell equations, it undoubtedly made direct that emission of light could be achieved only as a result of work
 vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke utsarjan ke liye, kisi aaweshit kan kii halchal hi prayaapt he or yah nishchit hi kaary he, atah yah urja kaa utsarjan he
 Since the speed of light is not possible, it can be concluded that humans cannot travel more than 40 light years away from the earth if the passenger is active from 20 to 60 years of age
 yah bhi saralata se sochaa ja saktaa he ki yatri kuch hi soramandalon tak pahunch paane main sakasham ho saktaa he jo prithvi se 20-40 prakaash varshon kii duuri par sthit hai
 But this is an incorrect result
 kyonki samay-vistaaran kii pariklpana ke anusaar payalat ke sakriya 40 varsh ke dauraan kaalpanik antarikshayan saikadon prakashavarsh yatra kar saktaa he
 If it is possible to build an spacecraft whose acceleration is 1g, then in less than a year, the speed of light will be observed at about the same speed of light from Earth
 samay vistaaran kii vajah se prithvi par sthit nirdesh tantra se prekshit uskaa jivan vistaar badhegaa, lekin uske saath yatra kar rahi ghadi main yah parivartan nahin hoga
 During his journey, the person on earth will experience more time than the traveler
 yatri dwaara prekshit 5 varsh bhraman yatra prithvi ke 61⁄2 varsh ke tulya hogi or 6 prakashavarsh duri tay karegaa
 If he returns to earth after a 20-year tour, he has spent 335 years on Earth and has traveled 331 light years
 1 g twaran ke saath 40 varsh kii yatra prithvi ke 58,000 varshon ke tulya hogi or 55,000 prakashavarsh duuri tay hogi
 a 40-year journey with 1
1 acceleration would be equivalent to 148,000 years of Earth and travel 140,000 light years
 isi vistaaran kaaran se ek muon jo prakaash ke veg c ke lagbhag saamaan veg se gatisheel hota he c×viraam arddh-aayu duuri se bahut aage bhi prekshit hota he
 In Figure 2, the interval AB is 'time-congruent'; Just as there is a directive mechanism in which two events a and b occur at the same point in the society, only when they occur at different times can be separated
 yadi is nirdesh tantra main ghatana A, ghatana B, se pehle ghatit hoti he to sabhi nirdesh tantron main ghatana A, b se pehle hi ghatit hogi
 It is possible for matter to move from one place to another, so a relationship is established here
 chitra main antaraal AC samshti-samroop arthath yahan ek nirdesh tantra aisa he jisamen ghatana a or c ek hi samay par ghatit hoti hai keval samshti alag-alag hota he
 Here, one can also find the instruction mechanisms in which a occurs before C, and the direction mechanisms in which c occurs before A
 yadi yah kaaran-or-prabhaav sambandh ke liye sambhav hota ki kuch ghatnaayen a or c ke bich ghatit ho jaayen tab kaaranta kaa virodhabhash iskaa parinaam hoga
 For example, if a was the cause and c is the effect, then there are some directive mechanisms in which the effect occurred before the cause
 yadhyapi yah apane aap main virodhabhash nahin he, isse pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he ki prakaash ke bhi veg se tej gati se swayan ke nirdesh tantra ke bhoot main bhej ja saktaa he
 The causal contradiction can be constructed by sending a signal if and only if no signal was previously found
 isliye, yadi kaaranta ko parirakshit kiya jaae, tab vishisht aapekshikta ke parinamswaroop nirvaat main koi soochna athwa padaarth prakaash ke veg se tej gati nahin kar saktaa
 However, some objects move faster than the velocity of light, such as: Places where the rays of light strike the lower part of the cloud due to the lightning flashes, so that the beam can travel at a speed greater than the velocity of light when It turns quickly
 kaaranta ko dhyaan main rakhe bina yahan or bhi bahut prabal kaaran hai prakaash ke veg se teevr gati vishisht aapekshikta dwaara nisheddh he
 For example, if a fixed force is applied to an object for an infinite time, f = dp / dt is easily impeded by the integration of the following expression without limitation, but only because p = m γ v { \ 
 The displaystyle p = m \ gamma v \ ,} leads to infinity, as v { \ displaystyle \ , v}, proceeds to c
 ek prekshak le liye jo twarit nahin he ko yah drushtaant hota he yadhyapi vastu kaa jadtv badhata he, atah saamaan bal ke prabhaav main ek laghu twaran utpann hota he
 This behavior is actually observed in particle accelerators, where each charged particle is accelerated by an electromagnetic force
 gunter nimtz or petrissaa ekcle dwaara pratipaadit saidhantik or praayogic surangan adhyayan ne galat daawa kiya kii vishesh paristhitiyon main signal prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se chal saktaa he
 It is measured that the fiber digitizing signal speeds up to 5 times the velocity of c and the information that the electrons carry at zero time oscillation electrons and that the ionization of the atom from the photon and even then the electron imposes zero time in the tuning
 nimtz or ekcle ke anusaar, is ati-pradeepan prakriya main keval ainstin kaaranta or vishisht aapekshikta lekin pracheen kaaranta nahin, kaa ulanghan hota he : ati-pratideept sanchaar kisi bhi tarah kii samay yatra kaa parinaam nahin hota
 According to various scientists, not only are the interpretations of Nimtz incorrect but the experiment is actually a general experimental verification of the specific relativity principle
 vishisht aapekshikta main 4-vimiya minkovesaki samshti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he; - yah dik-kaal kaa udahaaran he
 Minkowski's time period appears to be very similar to the standard three-dimensional Euclidean macro, but it undergoes a radical change over time
 trivim samshti main avakal rekha alpaansh ds nimna prakaar se paribhaashit hota he Where dx = are the minor minor divisions in the three-dimensional macro
 minkovasaki jyamiti main, samay se vyutpan nirdeshaank x0 adhi-vimaa hoti he atah doorik avakal nimna he Where dx = quadrilateral is the differential minority in the time period
 yah ek gahari saidhantik antardrushti kaa sujhavit karata he: vishesh aapekshikta dik-kaal main saamaanya ghurnan samamiti ke tulya he, jo eucalidian samshti main ghurnan samamiti ke anuroop
 Like the Euclidean society, Euclidean distance is also used, so the time period uses Minkowski's distance
 mul rup se vishisht aapekshikta ko "dik-kaal interval kii nishcharata" ke rup main dekha jaataa he jab ise "kisi jadtviya nirdesh tantra" main dekha jaataa he
 All equations and effects of specific relativity can be derived from Minkowski's time-rotation rotation symmetry
 uparokt "ds" kaa vaastavik rup doorik par or x0 nirdeshaank ke chunaav par nirbhar karata he
 To make the time coordinates similar to the macro coordinates, it is used as imaginary: x0 = ict
 misanar, thorne or whealer ke anusaar, antat vishisht va saamaanya aapekshikta donon kii gahari samaj minkosaki doorik ke adhyayan se praapt hoti he or abhedya eucalidian doorik samay nirdeshaank ict ke sthaan par x0 = ct lete hai
 Some authors use x0 = t where the multiplier of c is included elsewhere; For example, macro coordinates are divided by c, or multiples of c ± 2 are used in a distant surface
 yahan vibhinn prathaon ko praakrit ikai se pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he jahaan c=1
 In this, the units of both time and macro are equivalent and the multiplier of c does not appear anywhere
 yadi ham samashti vimaa ko ek kam kar den, jisase ki bhautikee ko trivim main nirupit kar saken Then there will be a zero change in the direction of the duality cone, as the equation yaa Which is the equation of the circle with radius c dt
 jab ham teen dik-vimaaon main isaki vruddhi karte hai, tab yah raashi chaturvimaa shanku main drushtaant hoti he : Therefore yah ashakt dwait-shanku, samshti main ek bindu ko ek-vimaa ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 When we study the stars and say "the light incident from this star that i am seeing now is so many years old", we see this point as a Vima: a null is geodesic
 ham is ghatana ko duuri d = x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 { \ displaystyle d={ \ sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2 xxrep 4 } par sthit va d / c samay purv ghatit ho chuki thi
 For this reason the null duality cone is also known as the 'light cone'
 shanku main -"t" kshetra kaa matlab bindu se soochna praapt kar rahaa he or shanku ke +"t" kshetra main bindu soochna bhej rahaa he
 Minkowski can illustrate the geometry of the macro by using Minkowski diagrams, which are also useful in understanding various experimental ideas in specific relativity
 vishisht aapekshikta kii samikarnon ko vyakt parivarti rup main likhaa ja saktaa he
 In the time period of an event, the situation is given by the reflex quadrature whose components are: ham x0 = ct paribhaashit karte hai taaki samay nirdeshaank kii vimaa bhi duuri ke samaan ho jaisaa ki anya dik-vimayein hai; atah dik va kaal samaan rup se sambandhit hai shirshank pratiparivarti suchakank ke liye upyog kiye hai naa ki unki ghaat ke liye or padank parivarti suchakank hai jo shunya se teen tak kii paraas main hai jaise ki adish kshetra φ kii chaturpravanta ko likhaa jaataa he : In inertial instruction systems, the coordinate transforms are given by the Lorenz transformation Λ
 gati kii vishesh avasthaa ke liye jab yah x-aksh kii disha main ho : Which is the magnification matrix between the x and ct coordinates, where μ 'is the pointer to the rows and ν is the column and yah kisi bhi disha main veg ke liye vyapkikrut kiya ja saktaa he or aage ghurnan ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, adhik jaankaree ke liye lorenj roopantaran sambandhi vishay dekhen
 The conversion of quadrature from one inertial instruction system to another is given by Lorenz transformation: yahan par μ' or ν' par 0 se 3 tak ke liye joda jaataa he
 The following are inverse transforms: jahaan λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _{ \ mu '}{}^{ u }}, λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^{ \ mu '}{}_{ u }} kii vyutkram matrix kehalaati he
 In the case of Lorenz transformation, the above is taken in the direction of the x-axis: adhik vyapak rup main, adhiktar bhautik raashiyon ko pradeesh ke ghatakon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, conversion from one instruction system to another, it is possible to follow comprehensive display conversion rules
 yahan λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _{ \ chi '}{}^{ \ psi } \ ,}, λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^{ \ chi '}{}_{ \ psi }} kii vyutkram matrix he
 All the entries are modified as per the rules
 dik-kaal kii chaturvim prakruti kaa minkosaki durik η ke ghatakon ko 4 × 4 ke avyuuh ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he : Which is similar to its inverse η α β { \ displaystyle \ eta ^ { \ alpha \ beta}} in those directive systems
 poincare samooh roopantaran kaa vrihat vyapak samooh he jisamen minkovesaki doorik samahit hota he And this is the basic physical symmetry of specific relativity
 chatursadish sthiti main lambai main alp parivartan d x μ { \ displaystyle dx^{ \ mu } \ !} ke varg ko nimna prakaar likhaa jaataa he This is an inferior zodiac
 nishchar se matlab sabhi jadtviya nirdesh tantron main iskaa maan samaan rahata hai kyonki yah ek adish raashi he atah iske saamaanya roopantaran main koi λ prakat nahin hota
 When the value of longitude dx2 is negative tab maanak samay kaa avkalaj he, jabaki dx2 dhanatmak he, maanak duri kaa avkalaj he
 The primary value of physical equations in adjective form lies in the Pioncare group, so we do not have to do specific and difficult calculations to calculate this effect
 pradeesh ke rup main parichit anya bhautik rashiyaan bhi roopantaran niyamon kaa paalan karti hai
 The quadrature vector Uμ is given by the following equation iske pashchaat ham kan ke ek nirdesh tantra se duusare nirdesh tantra main chaturvegon ke roopantaran se sambandhit saral vaakya main vegon ke sangyojan par vichaar karte hai
 Uμ also has a definitive form: atah sabhi chaturveg sadish kaa parimaan c hota he
 This equation proves that the concept of permanent instruction in relativity disproves the hypothesis: because we are always in the forefront at least
 chaturtvaran sadish nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : Subsequently, the above equation is calculated with respect to τ atah aapekshikta main, twaran chatursadish or veg chatursadish lamb koniya hote hai
 Emotion and energy are included in the covariant 4-vector: jahaan m nishchar dravyaman he
 The derivative value of the quadrangular vector derives the momentum – energy relation: yah nishchar kya he ham siddh kar sakate hai jiske liye hamen yah siddh karnaa hoga ki yah ek adish he, yah is par nirbhar nahin karata ki ham kis nirdesh tantra main gananaa kar rahe hai or nirdesh tantra ke roopantaran se hamen kul samveg shunaya praapt hota he
 It is clear here that the permanent mass is free and inert
 sthir dravyaman kii gananaa gatisheel kanon va nikaayon ke liye bhi kii jaati he, iske liye inkaa roopantaran us nirdesh tantra main kiya jaataa he jisamen inkaa samveg shunaya ho
 Static energy is related to mass and this well-known relation equation is mentioned above: yahan dhyaan rahe nikaay kaa dravyaman unke dravyaman kendra nirdesh tantra main kalit kiya jaataa he jo is nirdesh tantra main isaki kul urja dwaara diya jaataa he
 This should not be the same as the sum of the private body masses measured in other reference systems
 newton ke gati ke tritiy niyam kaa upyog karne ke liye, donon balon ko samaan samay nirdesh tantra main veg main parivartan kii dar ke rup main paribhaashit hone chahien
 Where, it is necessary to have the stereoscopic forces defined above
 durbhagyavash, chaturvim main aisa koi pradeesh nahin he jo trivim bal sadish ke ghatakon ko apane ghatakon main samahit karata ho
 If the velocity of the particle is not c, then it is possible to transform the stereoscopic forces from the particle's concomitant direction system to the observer direction
 isse 4-sadish kaa nirmaan hota he jise chaturbal kaha jaataa he
 This is the rate of change in the energy momentum quadrature defined above relative to the above standard time
 chaturbal kaa covariant sanskaran: Where τ is called standard time

 In broad terms, though, the components of the quadratic are not the same as the components of the stereoscopic force because the stereoscopic forces are defined as the rate of change in momentum relative to the directive time which is dp / dt rather the standard force is the quadratic force
 Is defined as the rate of change in dp / dτ

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean

 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
