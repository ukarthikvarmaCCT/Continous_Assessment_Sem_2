 And before that the Kafirs used to pray for blessings when they came to know what they knew, then it is a shame for God to deny the Kafirs, what is the worse thing that they are losing their lives in respect of God, with his own friends, whoever he has chosen to book with his own grace, disobeying everything that God has revealed with this blood For the Kafirs and the Kafirs, Roussewai has a wonder and when he was told that God has believed in him, then believe that we have come to believe in the same book which was revealed to us and that book which was then i have not believed, even though it is a right, and it also admits the book that they have, but they deny the book that has come after them
 Ask them if you were honest then why open it? Da was former killed the prophets and you have Moses Vajeya and Raushan had already come with fun, yet you made the calf after them, and you were going to torture yourself by that and when we took you away and hanged the head on your head and what we have given you reliably
 Keep and listen, then you start saying, we do not believe it and because of their dishonesty, they were fed in the hearts of the calf's slaughter in their hearts and tell them that if you were honest you How bad did you believe that you should tell these people that if the last house near God is special for you and people do not like it, if you are true then start death, but because of those immorality Those whom their hands have already sent ahead, they certainly will not face death and God is very well aware of the oppressors and you will find them the highest green of life and in Mushriq Every person wants to be given a thousand years of age, however Even if given such a dull age, he is not going to relieve himself from the wonders of God, and God is watching everything that he does, say that he is the enemy of Jibreil because that angel has poured on your heart with the command of God And he also appeals to the books that are present in front of him and there is good news for the believers who revere the man and his angels and his apostles and Jibraeel and Michael If you are a shaman, then of course God is also an enemy of kafirs and we have made such markings on you which are waja and light and no one can deny them except such disbelievers and their condition is that whenever someone dies, one of them Fariq broke it, but most of them often do not believe and when Rasul came to them from God and also confirmed the book that he has, then one of those Ahle book Iroh threw his paise Pusht the books Khuhda Goya that people know No and fell behind the mantra that was chanted in the Sultanate of Sultan's time, although Suleman did not do kufr, but the devils practiced kufr that he used to bring magic to the people and the things that both Harut and Marut angels It was revealed in the Bible, although both of these angels did not teach anyone, until they said that both of us are fair, i am dishonest He used to learn from them on that too, due to which Mia used to take care in wife, however, without Azne God, he could not reach anyone with these things and these people used to learn such things which themselves harm them and bring something Despite that, he knew for sure that the person who bought these people is ultimately uninterested and is very large, instead of which he gave his life Understand not think i wish sold are and that he believed bring and avoiding magic blah Spartan If it was built, it would have been much better than what it would have received from the shrine of God, i wish these people would understand that you do not say that i am a believer, but say it to them and keep listening and it is painful for the infidels
 He and Musherakin do not want that goodness will be passed on to you from your family and God, whom he wants, especially for his mercy And God is very fuzzy
 When we make any rectangle or erase it from your mind, then we make it better or even more like that, don't you know that the uncountable God is the focus on everything, don't you know that the sky The Sultanate is uniquely unique and apart from God, you are neither a patron nor a helper
 Do you want that you also treat your Rasul the same way? In Bikh times were unlocking of Moses and the person who Iman against blasphemy Having done so, he has strayed from the straight path, often in the book Ahle, because of his heartfelt desire, people wish to make you a Kafir after believing that their rights have been revealed, even after that you forgive me And pray even God send his command, of course God is on everything and keep praying and give zakat and whatever goodness you send to yourself will be present
 You will find God is watching everything that you do and says that no one except Jude and Nussaira will be able to go into unconsciousness, it is their thoughtless pilgrimage
 You tell them that if you are true that we will go into unconsciousness Present your argument, yes, the person who bowed his head in front of God and does good work, for that he has his revenge in his family and no such kind of people Huf will and not those Ghmghin will and faith to say Nusara Judah It is not appropriate for such people to go in it, but for such people who have suffered, the world is roused, and for such people, in the end, there is a great wonder, that God is facing the eastern side wherever it is
 Of course, God is very versatile and well versed and the Jews started saying that God keeps children, although he is a pak, but all that is in the ground and in the sky belongs to him and all his They are proud of the sky and the land, and when they decide to do something, then they just say that "ho Ja" is the one that they become and those who do not know why God does not ask us, Or why we don't have any signs, Similarly, they have done the same things that were before them, the hearts of all of them are similar to each other, people who are sure, why have they clearly shown their signs, we have made you good news and fearful You have been sent and you will not be asked anything about the doings, and neither the Jews will ever agree with you nor the Nusaira, even you defend their religion and say that it is free It is instructed and if you go on their wishes even after you have got Ilma, then there will be no guardian to protect you from God nor help people whom we have written in the book (kujihad al-nikah muddinayanpalli main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he

 thos avasthaa kii bhautikee ko thos avasthaa kaa siddhant ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is that branch of physics in which the structure of a solid and its physical properties are studied
 yah sanghanit pravastha bhautikee kii sabase badi shakha he
 In solid state physics, it is considered how external properties of solids are related to their atomic-level properties
 is prakaar thos avasthaa bhautikee, padaarth vigyaan kaa saiddhanthik aadhaar banaati he
 Apart from this, it is also directly used in the technology of transistors and the technology of semiconductors
 is vishay ke pramukh vibhaag hai : 1
 Structure-based properties, such as gemology, theory of structure of metals, alloys, ionic crystallization, cohesive force, banded structure, etc
; 2
 pradhanat: samang thoson ke gun, jaise vishisht ooshmaa, ooshmiya kampan, ooshmiya tathaa vaidyucchalakata, atichaalakata, prakaash samvaahakta, chumbakeey tathaa vidyutpaarak aadi 3
 Toxicity and deformation properties in solids, such as impurity, semiconductivity, plasticity, lattice structure defects, color center point defects, displacement theory, geminology etc

 Since the number of atoms in the unit volume of a gas is relatively small, its density is also small
 phir parmaanuon ke bich adhik duuri hone ke kaaran ant:parmanviya bal bhi ksheen hote hai
 Therefore, the atomic distances can be easily changed
 gasiy avasthaa kii vyakhya main ant:parmanviya balon ko ekadam naganya mana ja saktaa he, kintu thos or drav ke siddhanton ke vikson main aisa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In this case, the atomic forces have to be clearly considered, because these atoms are close to each other and the forces between them are powerful
 ant:parmanviya bal kai prakaar ke hote hai, at: thos ke gunon main gas kii apeksha adhik bhinnata pai jaati he
 For example, mercury and argon exhibit very similar properties in the gaseous state, while substantial differences are found in their properties in the solid and liquid conditions

 Grieving and talking about them, Lomash Rishi came there
 dharmraj yudhisthir ne unka yathochit aadar-satkar karke ucchasana pradaan kiya
 Sage Lomash said, “O Pandavgan! You people should worry about Arjun
 main abhi devraj indra kii nagari amravati se aa rahaa hoon
 Arjuna is residing there happily
 unhone bhagwaan shiv evam anya devataaon kii krupa se divya tathaa alokik astr-shastr tathaa chitrasen se nrity-sangeet kala kii shiksha bhi praapt kar liya he
 They will come here only after killing the Asuras called Nivat and Kavach
 devraj indra ne aapke liye yah sandesh bheja he ki aap pandavagan ab tirthayatra karke apane aatmbal main vruddhi karen
 According to the message given by Devraj Indra, Yudhishthira took his brothers, priests Dhaumya, Lomash Rishi etc
 and went for pilgrimage
 ve log naimisharany, kanya-tirth, ashv-tirth, gau-tirth aadi main darshan-snanadi karte huye agastya rishi ke ashram aa pahunche
 Lomash Rishi praised that ashram and said, “O Dharmaraja! It is the holy austerity of Agastya Muni and his godly wife Lopamudra
 ek baar agastya muni yahan ghoomte huye pahunche to unhone ek gadde main apane purvajon ko ulte latakate dekha
 When Agastya Muni asked for the reason for his hanging in this way, the ancestors said that, o son! Because of your childlessness we have got this hell tank
 isaliye sheeghra apana vivaah kar putr utpann karo, jisase hamaara uddhaar ho
 Saddened by the ancestors, Agastya went in search of a fit wife and married Lopamudra, the princess of Vidarbha
 jab agastya muni ne lopamudra ke soundarya par mugdh hokar putrotpatti kii abhilaashaa se use apane paas aane ke liye kaha to lopamudra boli ki he swami! main rajkumaari hoon isaliye aapkaa mere saath samagam bhi rajochit dhang se hona chaiye
 First of all, arrange for money and bring beautiful clothes and gold jewelery for me and yourself
 apni patni kii vaani se prabhavit hokar agastya muni dhan maangane ke liye raja shrutarva, vraghnashv tathaa ikshvaku vanshi trasadrisyu ke paas gayi kintu sabhi raajaaon kaa kosh khaali hone ke kaaran un raajaaon kshamaprarthana karte huye ne agastya muni ko dhan dene main asamarthta prakat kar diya
 Frustrated, Agastya came to the monk named Muni Ilval
 ilval daitya ne prasannataa ke sa unhen munhamaanga dhan pradaan kar diya
 Agastya Muni, after receiving money, wished for his wife and gave birth to a son named Dridhasu
 kaalaantar main yah tirthasthan agastyashram ke naam se prasiddh hua
 Parashurama regained his glory by taking a bath in this place of pilgrimage
 isaliye he yudhisthir! yahan snaan karke aap duryodhana ke dwaara chhine gayi apane tej ko punah praapt kijiye
 " lomash rishi ke aadeshaanusaar vahaan snaan-puja aadi karke yudhisthir ne lomash rishi se poocha, “he prabho! krupa karke yah bataaiye ki parashuram nistej kaise huye the?” lomash rishi ne uttar diya, “dharmraj! dasharathanandan shri ram jab shiv ji ke dhanush ko todakar sita ji se vivaah kar apane pita, bhaaiyon, baaratigan aadi ke saath ayodhya laut rahe the to ek bade joro kii aandhi ai jisase vriksh prithvi par girane lage
 Then King Dasharatha's vision fell on Parasurama of Bhrigukul
 unki veshbhusha badi bhayankar thi
 There were big jats scattered on the stunning face, there was redness of anger in the eyes
 kandhe par kathor farsa or haathon main dhanush baan the
 The sages went ahead and welcomed him, and accepting this welcome, he said to Shri Ramchandra, "dasharathanandan Ram! We have come to know that you are very powerful and you have broken the bow of Shiva and by breaking it you have gained a rare fame
 main tumhaare liye ek acha dhanush laayaa hoon
 This bow is not ordinary, Jamadagnikumar is of Parashurama
 is par baan chadhaakar tum apane shaury kaa parichay do
 Seeing your strength and valor, i will fight with you
 parashuram kii baat sunakar raja dasharath vineet swar me bole, “bhagwan! aap vedavid swadhyaayi brahman hai
 By destroying the Kshatriyas, you have already reduced your anger
 isaliye he rishiraj! aap in baalkon ko abhaya daan dijiye
 " kintu parashuram ji ne dasharath kii anunay-vinay par koi dhyaan na dete huye ram se kaha, “ram! sambhavtah tumhen gyaat nahin hoga ki sansar main keval do hi dhanush sarvshereshth maane jate hai
 The whole world respects him, Vishwakarma created him with his own hands
 unamem se pinaak naamak ek dhanush ko devataaon ne bhagwaan shiv ko diya tha
 With this bow, Lord Shiva killed Tripurasura
 tumne usee dhanush ko tod daalaa he
 The second divine bow is in my hand
 ise devataaon ne bhagwaan vishnu ko diya tha
 It is also as powerful as Pinak
 vishnu ne bhriguvanshi richik muni ko dharohar ke rup main vah dhanush de diya
 i have received this bow by hereditary form
 ab tum ek kshatriya ke naate is dhanush ko lekar is par baan chadhaao or safal hone par mere saath dwandv yuddh karo
 When Parshuram repeatedly challenged, Ramchandra said, “O Bhargava! i am not saying anything special in front of you as a Brahmin
 kintu aap meri is vinsheeltaa ko parakramaheenta evam kaayarta samajhakar meraa tiraskaar kar rahe hai
 Bring me a bow and arrow
 ” yah kah kar unhone jhapatate huye parashuram ke haath se dhanush baan le liye
 Then with an arrow on the bow, he said, "O Bhrigunandan! Being a Brahmin, you are my worshiper, so i cannot leave this arrow on you
 parantu dhanush par chadhane ke baad yah baan kabhi nishphal nahin jaataa
 It has to be used somewhere
 isaliye is baan ke dwaara aapaki sarvatra shighratapurvak aane-jane kii shakti ko nasht kiye detaa hoon
 After hearing this talk of Shri Rama, Parshuram, who was powerless, started saying humbly, "hear one of my words before leaving the arrow
 kshatriyon ko nasht karke jab maine yah bhoomi kashyap ji ko daan main di thi to unhone mujhase kaha tha ki ab tumhen prithvi par nahin rahanaa chaiye kyonki tumne prithvi kaa daan kar diya he
 Since then, i have never lived on the earth at night, following the orders of Guruvar Kashyap Ji
 atah he ram! krupa karke meri gaman shakti ko nasht mat karo
 i will go to the Mahendra mountain at the same speed as the mind
 chunki is baan kaa prayog nishphal nahin jaataa, isaliye aap un anupam lokon ko nasht kar den jin par menne apni tapasya se vijay praapt kii he
 The ease with which you have put an arrow on this bow has convinced me that you are the sakshata Vishnu who killed the demon Madhu
 ” parashuram kii prarthana ko sweekaar karke ram ne baan chhodkar unke dwaara tapasya ke bal par arjeet kiye gayi samast punyalokon ko nasht kar diya or isse parashuram ji nistej ho gayi
 Then Parashurama went to Mahendra mountain to do penance

 computing yani sanganan main feed agrigater, jise feed reader, news reader yaa saadharantah agrigater kaha jaataa he ek desktop yaa web anuprayog hota he jo ki internet par muhaiyaa syndicated masaude, masalan samachar surkhiyaan, blog, podcast or vlog kaa sankalan kar ek hi sthaan par use pradarshit karata he
 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom
 sankalak jaalasthalon yani websits par nai saamagree jode jane kaa pataa lagane main vyay hone vaale samay va shram kii bachat karata he or ek tarah se pathak ke liye uskaa vyaktigat akhbaar bana kar use pesh karata he
 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format
 kai portal jaalasthalon main sankalan kii suvidha jalsthal par hi muhaiyaa he, masalan maai yahuu yaa ai google par
 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs
 sankalak masaude ko samahit kar kisi ek hi brouzar yaa desktop anuprayog par pesh kar detaa he
 These applications are also called RSS readers, feed readers, feed aggregators, news readers or search aggregators
 jin sankalkon main podcasting kii kabaliyat he ve swatah media filein jaise kii empi3 ricarding kaa adhibharan yaa downlod bhi kar saktaa he
 In some cases, it can also load these files directly into portable media players such as ipods connected to computers
 haal hi main kuch naye sankalak, jinhen "aresas narator" pukaara ja rahaa he, bhi maidan main utre hai jo na keval feed masaude kaa sankalan karte hai balki unhen aflin yani internet se jude bagaiyr audio ricarding ke rup main sunne kii suvidha dete hai
 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats
 udhaahranh sipan main, , aadi
 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries
