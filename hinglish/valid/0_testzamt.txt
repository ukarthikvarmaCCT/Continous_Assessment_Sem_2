 ise kashmir ke duusare yuddh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha
 Pakistan started this battle by sending its soldiers as infiltrators in the hope that the people of Kashmir would revolt against India
 is abhiyaan kaa naam pakistan ne yudhbhiyaan jibraltar rakhaa tha
 Thousands of people from both sides were killed in this war lasting five months

 In the war, infantry and armored troops took part in many campaigns with the help of the Air Force
 dono paksho ke bich hue anek yudhon kii tarah is yuddh kii anek jaankariyaan donon pakshon ne saarvajanik nahin kii
 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system
 pakistan ke ghuspaithiyon ko jaldi hi pahchaan liya gaya or vidroh karne ke bajaay janata ne unki soochna bhartiya sainikon ko de di or yah abhiyaan purnatah vifal ho gaya
 On August 5, 1965, between 26000 and 3 xxrep 4 0 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control in the dress of the local population of Kashmir and entered Indian Kashmir
 bhartiya sena ne sthaneey aabaadi se isaki soochna paakar 15 agast ko niyantran rekha ko paar kiya

 The Indians were successful in bringing additional troops and India entered 8 km into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and captured the Haji Pir Pass

 The expedition came under occupation of the infiltrators of Gibraltar by the Indians and the expedition failed
 yahi nahin, pakistan kii kaman ko lagane laga ki pakistani kashmir kaa mahatvapurn shahar mujaffarabad ab bharatiyo ke kabje main jane hi vaala he
 Pakistan launched a new campaign Operation Grand Slam to ease the pressure on Muzaffarabad
 1 sitambar 1965 ko pakistan ne grand slam naamak ek abhiyaan ke tahat samrik drushti se mahatvapurn shahar akhnur jammu or kashmiripar kabje ke liye akraman kar diya
 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India

 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given
 general choudhary is baat se sahamat nahin the lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shashtri ne unki baat ansuni kar is hamale kaa aadesh de diya
 On September 6, India crossed the international border and attacked the Western Front and made the official start of the war
 6 sitambar ko bharat kii 15ve paidal sainya ikai ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke anbhavi major general prasad ke netratv main icchhogil nahar ke pashchimi kinare main pakistan ke bade hamale kaa saamana kiya
 The Ichogil Canal was the de facto border of India and Pakistan
 is hamale main khud major general prasad ke kafile par bhi hamalaa hua or unhe apana vaahan chhod kar bhaagna padaa
 India succeeded in crossing the canal near Barki village in retaliation

 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Khemkaran to reduce the pressure on Lahore and captured it
 In return, India attacked Bedi and its surrounding villages
 6 sitambar ko lahore par hamale main bhartiya sena ke pratham paidal sainya khand ke saath dwitiya bakhtarband upkhand ke teen tanks daste shaamil the
 They immediately crossed the border and reached the Ichogil Canal, the Pakistan Army deployed defense teams on the bridges, the bridges which could not be saved were blown up, this move of Pakistan stopped the Indian army moving forward
 jat regiment kii ek ikai 3 jat ne nahar paar karke dograi or batapore par kabja kar liya
 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged

 On 8 December 1965, a squad of 5 Maratha Light Infantry was sent to strengthen the Rajasthan Military Force stationed at Munabav, a strategically important town

 5 3 Gurkhas and 954 heavy artillery squad sent to help Maratha could not reach due to heavy attack of Pakistani Air Force and Tran coming from Barmer after taking logistics also became an attack near Garda Road Rail Base 10 September Munabao was captured by Pakistan
 9 sitambar ke baad kii ghatnaon ne dono deshon kii senaao ke sabase garvit khando kaa dambh chur chur kar diya
 The 1st Armored Division of India, called the Pride of the Indian Army, attacked in the direction of Sialkot
 chhavinda main pakistan kii apekshaakrit kamjor 6 bakhtarband khand ne buree tarah haraa diya bhartiya sena ko kareeb kareeb 100 tanks gavaane pade or peeche hatane par majaboor hona padaa
 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target

 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat
 usne apane 97 tanks kho diye, jisamen 72 paton tanks shaamil the; iske alaava 32 tanks chalati haalat main kabja kar liya gaya
 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred

 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in combat as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 hindko pashchimottaree pakistan ke kaibar-pakhtuunakva praant ke hindkovi logon or afghanistan ke kuch bhaagon main hindki logon dwaara boli jane vaali ek hind-arya bhashaa he
 According to some linguists, it is a western dialect of Punjabi, although there has been some controversy
 kuch pashtun log bhi hindko bolte hai
 The mother tongue of Punjabi can understand Hindus to a great extent
 duniya bhar main anumaanit 20-50 lakh log hindko bolte hai
 Some of Bollywood's most famous actors are from Indo-mother tongue families, such as Pran, Dilip Kumar and Shahrukh Khan
 raaj kapur, prithviraj kapur or uske parivaar ke anya sadsy bhi peshawar main rahe the or hindko bolte the
 There are many ideas about how the word Hindo came to be
 asia or iran se hindustan aane vaale aarambhik logon kaa hindukush parvat ko paar karne ke baad isi boli ke saath sampark sthapit hua
 Since after crossing Hindukush, there was no obstruction in the way of Hindustan, hence this dialect was called Hindustan Ki Boli or Hindko
 unani logon ne hindustan ke liye indicos shabd kaa prayog kiya he or isi liye yahan kii boli kaa naam hindko pada
 Some people even say that the Iranians gave it this name
 sindh ghati ke pahaado ke madhya yaa aage-peeche yah bhashaa boli jaati thi
 In Persian, there is the word koh for the word mountain and this is what made the word Hindo
 hindko ek hind-aryaa boli he
 Sanskrit language grammarian Panini also belonged to this area
 yah bhashaa bhi punjabi ke samaan prakrit se bani
 Nowadays, like the old times, Hindus are being spoken in those places which were the place of Gandhara Rahtal
 isliye hindko puraani gandhar rahatal kii bhi aam bolchaal kii bhashaa thi or yah sansakrut ke bhi nazadik thi
 Hindus speak the language as Hindus of Afghanistan

 result raajnneeti vigyaan ek saamaajik vigyaan he jo sarkaar or raajnneeti ke adhyayan se sambandhit he
 Political science is a broad subject or field of study
 raajnneeti vigyaan main ye tamaam baaten shaamil hai:raajnneetik chintan, raajnneetik siddhanth, raajnneetik darshan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, sansthagat yaa sanrachanagat dhaancha, tulanaatmak raajnneeti, lok prashasan, antarrashtriya kanoon or sanghathan aadi
 The origin of political science is very ancient
 unani vichaarak arestu ko raajnneeti vigyaan kaa pitamah kaha jaataa he
 Plato's idealism and Aristotle's rationalism are included in Greek thought
 raajnneetishastra yaa raajnneeti vigyaan atyant pracheen vishay he
 Initially it was not accepted as an independent subject
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan nitishastra, darshanashastra, itihaas, evam vidhishastra aadi kii avadharanaon ke aadhaar par hi karne kii parampara thi
 In modern times, it was not only accepted as an independent subject, but also developed well in the context of social sciences
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan aaj ke sandarbh main pehle kii apeksha ek ore jahaan atyadhik mahatvapurn he vahiin duusari ore vah atyant jatil bhi he
 The importance of political science is revealed by the fact that today the study of political process is necessary to understand both national and international politics
 prakriya ke adhyayan se hi vaastavik raajnneeti evam unke bheetar avasthit tathyon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 The complexity of political science is linked to their overlapping form and the nature and nature they generate
 aaj raajnneeti vigyaan ’raajnneetik’ va gaiyr raajnneetik donon prakaar ke tatwon se sambandhit he
 Political elements directly govern the political process and from this point of view, under political science, the study of state government, government institutions, electoral system and political behavior is done
 gaiyr raajnneetik tatv apratyaksh rup se raajnneetik prakriya ko chalaane main yogadan dete hai or is kaaran raajnneeti kii sahi samaj inako samanvit karke hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 For this purpose, in political studies, adequate importance is given to the supporting elements like society, economy, religion, culture, geography, science and technology, psychology and history
 unani vichaarkon ke samay se lekar aadhunik kaal tak ke vibhinn chintakon, siddhanthavettaon or vishleshkon ke yogadanon se raajnneeti vigyaan ke rup, adhyayan saamagree evam uski paramparaaye samay-samay par parivartit hoti rahi hai
 Accordingly, this subject has been continuously developing
 is vikascram main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke sambandh main do pramukh drushtikonon kaa udai hua he : paramparaagat drushtikon evam aadhunik drushtikon
 The traditional or traditional approach introduces state-precedence while the modern approach is process-dominant
 isa purv chhathi sadi se 20veen sadi main lagbhag dwitiya mahayuddh se purv tak jis raajnneetik drushtikon kaa prachlan rahaa he, use adhyayan suvidha kii drushti se 'paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon' kaha jaataa he
 It is also called idealistic or classical approach
 paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhant ke nirmaan va vikaas main anek raajnneetik vichaarkon kaa yogadan rahaa he yatha- plato, arestu, siciro, sant agastin, equinas, lock, ruso, montescue, kant, hegal, green aadi
 Even in the modern era, many scholars are considered supporters of the traditional view, such as Leo Strauss, Eric Vogolin, Ocott, Hannah Arent, etc
 pracheen yunaan va rome main raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye darshanashastra, nitishastra, tarkshastra, itihaas va vidhi kii avadharanaon ko aadhaar banaaya gaya tha kintu madhyakaal main mukhyatah isai dharamshastreey drushtikon ko raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The Renaissance movement in the 16th century gave rise to intellectual political consciousness as well as the concept of nation-state
 18 veen sadi kii audyogic kranti ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke vikaas ko nai gati pradaan kii
 The glorious revolution of England, the democratic revolutions of France and America developed the traditional political theory as 'liberal democratic political theory'
 paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye mukhyatah darshanik, taarkik naitik, aitihaasik va vidhik paddatiyon ko apanaaya he
 Since the 19th century it has placed special emphasis on legal, constitutional, institutional, descriptive and comparative methods
 20veen sadi ke prarambh se hi paramparaagat drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye ek nai drushti apanaai jo ateet kii tulana main adhik yathartwaadee thi
 In traditional political science, the practice outside the government and its statutory organs emphasized the study of socio-political facts affecting the policies and decisions of the government
 raajnneetik dal evamdababasamoohon ke saath-saath aupchaarik sanghathanon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 It also emphasized the study of social, economic conditions and movements which are clearly outside the formal organization of the government but affect its policies and programs
 ’raajnneeti’ kaa paryaayavachi angreji shabd 'politics' unani bhashaa ke 'polis' shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'nagar’ athwa ’rajya’ he
 In ancient Greece, each city was organized as an independent state, and the term politics reflected the learning of the governance related to those city states
 dhire-dhire nagar rajyon kaa sthaan rashtriya rajyon ne le liya atah raajnneeti bhi rajya ke vistrut rup se sambandhit vidya ho gai
 In the modern era, when the world is leaning towards scientific and systematic study of every subject, the study of subjects related to the state is called political science or political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashae di hai
 These definitions can be interpreted under the following headings: - raajnneeti vigyaan rajya kaa adhyayan he- anek raajnneetishastriyon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se hi raajnneeti vigyaan rajya naamak sanstha ke adhyayan kaa vishay he
 Scholars believe that from ancient times to modern times, the state has been the 'central element' of political science
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to the famous political scientist Blunshli, political science is the science which is related to the state and it tries to understand what is the basic element of the state, what is its essential form, what are its various forms of expression and its development
 How did it happen
 ’ german lekhak garis kaa kathan he ki raajnneeti shaastra main, shakti kii sanstha ke rup main, rajya ke samast sambandhon, uski utpatti, uske moort rup, uske prayojan, uske naitik mahatv, uski aarthik samasyaon, uske astitv kii avasthaaon uske vittiya pahalu, uddheshy aadi par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Garner, "political science begins and ends with the state
" ’’ doctor jakaaria kaa kathan he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra vyavasthit rup main un aadharbhoot siddhanton kaa nirupan karata he jinke anusaar samshti rup main rajya kaa sanghathan hota he or prabhusatta kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 ' uparyukt sabhi paribhaashaon se spasht he ki raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kendriya vishay rajya he
 The reason for this is the belief that since the time of Plato and Aristotle, the existence of the state is for the achievement of some sacred goals
 raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar kaa adhyayan he - kuch raajnneetishastriyon kii raay main raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa nahin apitu sarkaar kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 They believe that the state is a special organization of human beings and its functional expression is through the government
 unka tark he ki rajya ek amoort sanrachana he jabaki sarkaar ek moort evam pratyaksh sanstha he or sarkaar hi samprabhutaa kaa prayog karti he
 Government is the device of the state by which its purpose and purpose are converted into action
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main sarkaar kaa hi adhyayan hona chaiye
 According to Seele, "political science researches the elements of governance in the same way that property science deals with property, biology of life, arithmetic numbers and geometry of space and length
" ’’ leacock ne is sandarbh main sankshipt evam sargarbhit paribhaasha di he- ‘‘raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar se sambandhit shaastra he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan rajya evam sarkaar donon kaa adhyayan he- paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kuch vidwaanon kii manyata he ki keval rajya yaa keval sarkaar kii drushti se di gai paribhaashae apurna hai
 In fact, the state and the government have a close relationship and in the absence of any one of them, the other cannot be studied
 yadi rajya amoort sanrachana he to sarkaar ise moort va bhautik rup pradaan karti he tathaa isi prakaar yadi rajya prabhusatta ko dhaaran karne vaala he to sarkaar us prabhusatta kaa upbhog karti he
 Hence, both of these should be studied under political science
 paul janet ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan saamaajik vigyaanon kaa vah ang he jisamen rajya ke aadhaar tathaa sarkaar ke siddhanton par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dimock, political science is related to the state and its means to the government
 ’’ gilakraist ne sankshipt paribhaasha dete huye kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan rajya va sarkaar kii saamaanya samasyaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan maanav tatv ke sandarbh main adhyayan he- kuch raajnneetishastri uparokt paribhaashaon ko purna nahin maanate kyonki in paribhaashaon main maanav tatv kii upeksha kii gai he
 They believe that the study of the state or government is aimless and insignificant without human beings, because they have been created for the benefit of human beings, so the study of human elements is mandatory
 professor laski kii anusaar ‘‘raajnneeti shaastra ke adhyayan kaa sambandh sangathit rajyon se sambandhit manushyon ke jivan se he
 Expressing the importance of the human element in the context of political science, in the Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Herman Heller even went on to say that "the all-round nature of political science is determined by its fundamental human beliefs
" ’’ vastutah iskaa arth yah he ki raajnneeti vigyaan ek aisa saamaajik vigyaan he jiske antargat is tathy kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he ki kisi sangathit raajnneetik samaaj main swayan manushya kii sthiti kya he
 Political science studies the policies of the government towards various communities and sections of the society along with the study of the rights and freedoms of the individual
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha ham aise shaastra ke rup main kar sakate he jiskaa sambandh uske rajya naamak sanghathan se hota he or jiske antargat swabhaavatah sarkaar kaa bhi vistrut adhyayan sammilit hota hai sankshep main raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat rajya, sarkaar tathaa anya sambandhit sanghathanon va sansthaaon kaa, maanav ke raajnneetik jivan ke sandarbh main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Traditional definitions related to political science indicate the following trends: jis prakaar raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha vibhinn vichaarkon ne vibhinn prakaar se kii he, usee prakaar uske kshetra ko bhinn-bhinn lekhakon ne vibhinn shabdon main vyakt kiya he
 For example, according to the French thinker Blünschli, "political science deals with the bases of the state
 It studies its essential nature, its diverse forms, its expression and its development
" ’’ dow garnor ke anusaar ’’isaki moulik samasyaon main saadharantah pratham rajya kii utpatti or uski prakruti kaa anusandhan, dwitiya raajnneetik sansthaaon kii pragati, uske itihaas tathaa unke swaroopon kaa adhyayan, tathaa tritiy, jahaan tak sambhav ho, iske aadhaar par rajnatik or vikaas ke niyamon kaa nirdhaaran karnaa sammilit he
 Gatell has written a detailed description of the field of political science, that "historically, political science studies the origins of the state, the development of political institutions and the principles of the past
 


 vartmaan kaa adhyayan karne main yah vidyaman raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa vichaardhaaraon kaa varnan, unki tulana tathaa vargeekaran karne kaa praytn karata he
 For the purpose of making political institutions and activities more advanced on the basis of changing circumstances and moral norms, political science also looks forward to the future and also considers what the state should be like
 ’’ From the above definitions, in the field of political science, three ideologies emerge
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kshetra nirdhaaran karne hetu sanyukt raashtra sangh kii unesco dwaara sitambar 1948 main vishwa ke pramukh raajnneetishastriyon kaa sammelan ayojit kiya gaya jisamen paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshetra ke antargat nimnlikhit adhyayan vishay shaamil kiye jane kaa nirnay kiya gaya- Principles of Politics - Study of political theories and ideas of past and present
 raajnneetik sansthaayen - samvidhan, rashtriya sarkaar, pradeshik va sthaneey shashan kaa saral va tulanaatmak adhyayan
 Political Parties, Groups and Lokmat - a study of the political behavior of political parties and pressure groups, the process of participation of citizens in public opinion and governance
 anterrashtriya sambandh- anterrashtriya raajnneeti, anterrashtriya vidhi, anterrashtriya sanghathan tathaa anterrashtriya prashasan kaa adhyayan
 Traditional political science is based on philosophy and imagination
 paramparawaadi vichaarak adhikanshtah darshan se prabhavit rahe hai
 These thinkers have paid attention to the values of human life
 inke chintan kii pranali nigamanaatmak he
 Plato has a special significance in traditional political science
 plato ke atirikt roman vichaarak siciro or madhyayug main sant augustin ke chintan main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii spasht jhalak milti hai
 There are a large number of strong supporters of traditional political science in the modern era
 ruso, kant, hegal, green, bosanke, laski, okshot evam leyostros kii rachanaaon main plato ke vichaaron kii spasht jhalak dikhaai detii he
 In the modern period, there has been severe criticism of traditional political science study material and state related beliefs
 aalochakon ke anusaar rajya va raajnneetik sansthaaon kii paridhi se pare bhi kuch prakriyaayein evam ek parivesh dekhne ko miltaa he jiske adhyayan kii upeksha raajnneeti vigyaan kii garima va upyogita ke liye anarthakaari he
 Defenders of this view believe that human behavior is the source of inspiration and study of all social sciences and political science is generally the study of the political aspect of human behavior
 dwitiya mahayuddh se purv katipay raajnneetik vichaarak raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main manushya kii raajnneetik prakriyaaon evam gatividhiyon ko pramukh sthaan diye jane ke prati aagrahashil rahe
 Balter Wagehot, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Bryce, etc
 emphasized realistic studies of politics
 graham vaalas, arthur bentle, ketalin or lasvail ne maanav evam uske vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal diya
 Charles Marriam emphasized the development and use of scientific techniques and methods for the study of political science at the 1925 Conference of the American Political Science Association
 1930 main lasvail ne apni pustak ‘psico-pathology and politics’ main raajnneetik ghatnaon evam kriyaaon kii vyakhya ke liye frid ke manovigyaan ko aadhaar banaaya
 Before the Second World War, the University of Chicago in the United States had become the domain of behavioral political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan se aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan tak kii vikaas prakriya main dwitiya mahayuddh kii ghatana kaa vishesh mahatv he jiske baad kii duniya purv kii duniya se raajnneetik sanrachana, audyogic vikaas, vaigyanik va takneekee uplabdhiyon tathaa sainya kshamta kii drushti se atyadhik bhinn thi
 This serious change took place globally, replacing the traditional concepts of human society and culture, giving rise to new concepts
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat is vaataavaran main charles marium ke apni rachana ’new aspect of politics’main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan hetu naveen evam vaigyanik takneekon ke prayog kaa purna samarthan kiya
 In the above background, in the 1960s, political scientists at the University of Chicago in the United States tried to free political science from the philosophical system and make its study more scientific
 raajnneeti vigyaan ko saamaajik vigyaan maanate huye iske adhyayan ko purna banane hetu samajashaastra, manovigyaan, arthshaastra, maanavshaastra jaise samaaj vigyaanon kii vaigyanik paddatiyon ko apnaanaa uchit samajha
 Among these scientists, David Easton, Caitlin, Lasvale, etc
 are prominent
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii aadhunik avadharanaon kii drushti se george ketalin, david easton, hairald lasvail va kaplan vishesh ullekhneey he
 These scholars have emphasized the real and practical contexts of politics in their political science statements, considering it to be a study of power, influence, political justification and power
 aadhunik drushtikon ke samarthak raajnneeti shastriyon dwaara raajnneeti vigyaan ke bare main jo vichaar prastut kiye hai unako nimnlikhit binduon ke antargat spasht kiya ja saktaa he- Political science is the study of human actions - According to the modern approach of political science, political science studies the political behavior and actions of human beings
 maanav vyavhaar ko gaiyr raajnneetik-kaarak bhi prabhavit karte he
 All these factors are studied in political science
 e
 hard evam es
 hantigton kaa kathan he ’’raajnneetik vyavahaarwad shashan ko maanav or uske samudaayon ke kaaryon kii ek prakriya ke rup main sweekaarta he
 Hasjar and Stevenson hold the view that "political science in its field of study is primarily concerned with the mutual and collective interaction of individuals and the power relations between states and states
" raajnneeti vigyaan shakti kaa adhyayan he- ketalin va lasvail is vichaar ke samarthak he
 The mainstay of both is psychology
 ketalin ne 1927-28 main rajya ke sthaan par manushya ke raajnneetik kriya kalap ke adhyayan par bal dete huye raajnneeti ko prabhutv evam niyantran ke liye kiye jane vaala sangharsh bataaya he
 According to him, the main source of conflict has been the desire of human beings that other people believe in its existence
 1962 main apnipustak systematic politics main ketalin ne likhaa he- niyantran bhaavana ke kaaran jo kaary kiye jate he tathaa niyantran kii bhaavana par aadhaarit sambandhon kii ichchhaaon ke kaaran jis dhaanche va ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan hota he, raajnneeti shaastra kaa sambandh un sabase he
 Another powerful thinker Laswell believes that every person tries to make an impact for the attainment of certain values and valuable persons in the society, and the spirit of power lies in the influence
 atah lasvail ke anusaar 'raajnneeti shaastra kaa abhisht vah raajnneeti he jo batalaaye ki koun, kya, kab or kaise praapt karata he
 According to him, political activity starts from the situation in which the doer tries to achieve different values and power is the necessary condition
 raajnneeti vigyaan raaj-vyavasthaaon kaa adhyayan he- is drushtikon ke samarthak david easton, amand, aar
 kegan aadi he
 This approach defines political science as a sociological approach
 inaki manyata he ki sampoorn samaaj swayan main ek vyavastha he or raaj vyavastha is sampoorn samaaj vyavastha kii ek upvyavastha he tathaa vah uske ek abhinn bhaag ke rup main hoti he
 There are many functional structures in the state system such as constitution, organs of government, political parties, pressure groups, public opinion and election and human behavior is an integral part of this system
 sankshep main in vidwaanon kii manyata he ki raajnneeti vigyaan sampoorn samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raaj-vyavastha kii in sanrachanaon kii parsparik kriyaaon evam sambandhon tathaa maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Political science places more emphasis on the following facts under the study of polity - the study of the political process as part of the overall social order, the structure of the system and the inter-relationship of groups

 yah suchi bhinn prakaar ke un sabhi kanon kii he jo gyaat hai athwa unki upasthiti saiddhanthik rup se di gai he or yah mana jaataa he ki puraa brahmand inhen kanon se bana hua he
 See the different pages below for a list of different types of specific particles
 mul kan un kanon ko kehete hai jinaki aantarik saranchana prekshaniy nahin hoti arthath ye anya kanon dwaara milakar nahin banate
 These quantum fields are the basic basis of the theory
 mulkanon ke vibhinn parivaar or up-parivaar vidyaman hai
 The radicals are classified according to their rotation
 fermion kaa prachakran ardhapurnank hota he or bosonon kaa prachakran purngunaj hota he
 All the particles mentioned in the standard model have been observed experimentally, with the Higgs boson being discovered as the last particle
 fermion mul kanon kii do shreniyon main se ek he, anya shrenee boson he
 Fermion particles are those particles described by the Fermi Dirac statistic and whose quantum number is determined by the Pauli exclusion law
 isamen quark or lepton tathaa inke dwaara nirmit koi bhi sanyukt kan jo inaki visham sankhyaon se milakar bana ho shaamil hai, jaise berion or vibhinn parmaanuon ke nabhik
 The rotation of fermions is a semi-multiple of integers; The rotation of all known radicals is 1⁄2
 sabhi gyaat fermion dirack fermion hai; jinamein sabhi gyaat kanon ke liye bhinn prati-kan hota he
 To date, it is not known whether the neutrino dirac is Fermion or Myorana fermion
 quark hadronon ke moolbhoot ghatak hote hai or inaki anyonya kriya prabal anyonya kriya hoti he
 Among known charged particles, only quarks are particles on which the charge value is fractional but are not found to be independent and are found as a group of three or a group of two
 atah prakruti main keval purnank aavesh hi prekshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their antagonists are per-quarks, which differ only in the form of negative values of charge
 abhi tak prekshit kanon main chah bhinn prakaar ke quark hote hai jinamein se teen dhanatmak aaweshit hote hai jabaki anya teen par aavesh rinatmak hota he
 Leptones do not participate in strong interactions
 inke pratikan prati-lepton hote hai jinaki lepton sankhya or aavesh inke vipareet hota he
 The antimatter of electron is called positron for historical reasons
 kan bhautikee ke maanak model ke anusaar kul chah prakaar ke lepton hote hai jinamein se teen aaweshit lepton hote hai jinhen electron-sadrush lepton kehete hai tathaa anya teen lepton aaveshrahit hote hai jinhen nutrino kehete hai
 Bosons are types of radicals that are different from fermions
 boson un kanon ko kaha jaataa he jo bose-oinstin sankhyikee kaa paalan karte hai or purnank prachakran rakhte hai
 Bosons may be radicals such as: photons, gluons, etc
, or complex particles such as mesons
 prakruti ke sabhi moolbhoot bal gej boswanon dwaara vyavahit hote hai or dravyaman higgs kshetra dwaara nirmit mana jaataa he
 The basic bosons according to the standard model are the following: ati-samamitiya siddhanton ke anusaar kuch ore bhi kan maujuud hai jinamein se ek bhi 2014 tak prekshit nahin kiya gaya: Note: Just as the photon, z Boson and w ± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields - the photino, zino, and wino ± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2 by definition
 No matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutrino s and chargeinos as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos
 Other theories predict the existence of additional bosons: Mirror particles are predicted by theories that restore parity symmetry
 Magnetic monopole is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge
 They are predicted by some guts
 Tachyon is a generic name for hypothetical particles that travel faster than the speed of light and have an imaginary rest mass
 Preons were suggested as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern collider experiments have all but ruled out their existence
 Kaluza – Klein towers of particles are predicted by some models of extra dimensions
 The extra-dimensional momentum is manifested as extra mass in four-dimensional spacetime

 The main characters of this story are - Mirza Sajjad Ali and Mir Roshan Ali
 donon vaajibili shah ke jagirdaar hai
 They have no concern for the basic necessities of life
 donon gahare mitra hai or shatranj khelnaa unka mukhya karaber he
 Both of them are ill-equipped, servants and servants, breakfast-food, betel-tobacco etc

 She repeatedly sends the servant to get some medicine from Mirza Hakim, but Mirza is immersed in chess
 har ghadi unhen lagata he ki bas agali baaji unki he
 Finally, being fed up, Mirza's Begum tells them both of them
 khel kaa sara taam-jhaam dyodhi ke baahar phenk detii he
 The result is that the chess game now arises from Mirza and goes to Mir's door
 mir sahab kii bivi shuru main to kuch nahin kahatee lekin jab baat had se aage badhane lagati he tab in donon khilaadiyon ko maat dene ke liye vah ek nayab tarkeeb nikaalati he

 Both friends are worried, what solution can be found out
 mir or miraza bhi chote khilaadi nahin the
 He too broke down

 One day, suddenly Mir Saheb saw that the British army was moving along the banks of Gomti
 unhone miraza se hadabadi main yah baat bataai
 Mirza said - you save your trick
 angrej aa rahe hai aane do
 Mir said there is also artillery
 miraza sahab ne kaha- yah chakma kisi or ko dena
 Thus again both were lost in the game
 kuch samay main nawab waajid ali shah kaid kar liye gaye
 On the same route, the British army was returning victoriously
 puraa shahar besharmi ke saath tamaasha dekh rahaa tha
 Such a great Nawab of Awadh was silently bowing his head
 mir or raushan donon is nawab ke jagirdaar the
 They should put their lives in defense of the Nawab
 parantu durbhaagya ki jaan kii baaji to inhone lagaai zarur par shatranj kii baaji par
 After a while, these two friends got involved in the game
 baat khandaan or rayeesi tak aa pahaunchi
 The abusive language started happening
 donon kataar or talwaar rakhte the
 Both took out swords and gave each other
 donon kaa ant ho gaya
 Hopefully! This death would have happened in favor of Nawab Wajidali and in the opposition of the British Army! But this did not happen

 Unfortunately, two of their best defenders - Bo Larson and Roy Anderson - already ruled out with injuries and ruled out with their captain and key midfielder - Stafan Tepar - breaking his toe in training on the eve of the final, The strategy that Malmo FF used the same defensive support was Belgium's team club Bruch earlier in Wembley in the final twelve months
 With neither of the finalists being one of Europe's major clubs, the Olympia Stadium in Munich was far from complete for the final and the game itself was something of an anti-climax
 tathaapi, ek yaadgaar kahani vahaan abhi bhi bataaya janaa tha
 Back in February, Brian Chloegh Forrest was elected to spend the money that was made by winning the league title in 1978 at a forward from Birmingham City
 Chloegh became Trevor Francis Britain's first £ 1 million footballer when he took him to Nottingham, but UEFA rules dictated that he could not play European football for the next three months
 The first game that Francis was eligible for was, therefore, the final itself and, although out on the right wing, with Martin o'neill injured and Chloeigh not selected by Archie Gemmill, Francis was selected to play his first European club game

 Manusmriti is an ancient theology of Hinduism
 ise maanav-dharm-shaastra, manusanhita aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is in the form of a sermon given by Manu to the sages
 iske baad ke dharmagranthkaaron ne manusmriti ko ek sandarbh ke rup main sweekaarte hue iskaa anusaran kiya he
 In addition to the theological writers, philosophers like Shankaracharya, Shabaraswamy also cite this text authentically
 paramparanusaar yah smriti swyambhuv manu dwaara rachit he, vaiwaswath manu yaa prachaness manu dwaara nahin
 Manusmriti also shows that Bhrigu had shelved the memory, which is popularly known as Manusmriti, by sheltering the scriptures of Swayambhuva Manu
 is 'bhargaviya manusmriti' kii tarah 'naradiya manusmriti' bhi prachlit he
 Manusmriti is the theology which is well known
 na keval bharat main apitu videsh main bhi iske pramaanon ke aadhaar par nirnay hote rahe hai or aaj bhi hote hai
 Therefore, Manusmriti is considered as the world's invaluable fund of theology
