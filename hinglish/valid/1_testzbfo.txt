 Shiva Tandava Stotra is the hymn of Lord Shiva, composed by the great scholar and supreme devotee Lankadhipati Ravana
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga It is believed that Ravana, the devotee of Shiva, had lifted Mount Kailash and was in full arrogance on his power when he was trying to take the entire mountain to Lanka
 mahadev ko uskaa yah ahankaar pasand nahi aayaa to bhagavan shiv ne apane anguuthe se tanik sa jo dabaaya to kailash phir jahaan tha vahiin avasthit ho gaya
 The hand of Ravana, the exclusive devotee of Shiva, got buried and he got up to pray - "shankar Shankar" - that is, forgive, forgive, and began to praise; Which later became known as Shiva Tandava Stotra

 In the broad sense of animal breeding, all kinds of tasks related to the production, rearing and care of animals are involved, but in a limited sense, the term is often used to improve the heredity of animals in such a way that the human need and the desired kind of advanced Animals are available
 pashuon kaa sudhaar do prakaar se kiya ja saktaa he : First by improving their environment and second by improving their heredity
 in donon main se kisi ek main hi sudhaar karne se yathochit pragati nahin ho sakati
 By improving the environment, changes in animal numbers are often very quick, but that change is not permanent and lasts only as long as the new situation persists
 kintu kisi pashusamudaay kii anuvanshakita main sudhaar dwaara parivartan praaia: mand gati se hota he, kintu vah sthaayee hota he
 Initially, the animals were able to separate such groups of animals which they considered superior to other animals
 phir unamem jo uttam hote the unka chayan kar lete the
 With this type of selection, some such animals also came out in the group in which there was a desire for animal breeding
 ab unamem se jo jaanavar prajnak ko pasand aate the unhen duusari peedi ke janak ke rup main chun lete the or yahi vidhi peedi dar peedi apanaai jaati thi
 The cattle rancher would remove unwanted elements like this and insisted on the growth of animals with desirable qualities
 kisi bhi pashuprajnan kaarykram ke antargat teen baaten aavashyak hoti hai : The first step under any breeding program is to determine what the breeder's goal is to increase the production of animals to sell in the market, or to turn botanical tools into livestock products, or a particular one
 Wants to produce animals adapted to the climate, etc
 ek hi farm main do vibhinn uddeshyon ke liye ek hi jati ke do vibhinn prakaar ke pashuon kaa paalan laabhadaayak ho saktaa he, jaise kuch ghodon kaa gaadi khinchne ke liye to kuch kaa sawari ke liye, kuch pashuon kaa paalan maance utpaadan ke liye to kuch kaa dugdh utpaadan ke liye
 It may also happen that the same type of animal has a combination of different qualities, so that two different needs can be met from the same animal
 prayek pashu ke gunon kaa aankna prajnan kaarykram ke antargat doosraa kadam he
 Varan is the third step under the breeding program, which assesses the extent to which each of the available animals has the heredity to produce and use, or discard, the desired traits
 in gunon ke anusaar pashuon ko alag karnaa varan yaa chayan kehalaata he
 There are three types of selection: jaanwaron ko purnat: unke vyaktigat gunadosho ke aadhaar par prajnan ke liye chunanaa samooh varan, purvajon or sagotra bandhuon ke gunadosho ke aadhaar par unka chayan vanshavali athwa kul varan tathaa santati ke gundosh ke aadhaar par kisi jaanavar ke prajananaatmak gunon kaa moolyankan karnaa santati pareekshan kehalaata he
 If these three types of comparisons are compared, then each of them has its own merits
 jab kuch chure hue lakshan bahut hi vanshanugat hote hai, tab ausat santan main maan vaap kii bhanti hi ye lakshan prakat hote hai, kintu lakshan jab nune vanshanugat hote he ta ausat santan main us kul ke, jisase maan baap chune gaye the, alp maatra main gun prakat honge
 Progression by group selection depends on the intensity of selection and the average decline of the parent's total
 samooh varan dwaara praani main pratham adhik spasht parivartan hota he, kintu baad main gati dhimi pad jaati he or prabhaav kaaphi nahin hota
 The goal can be achieved by "group selection", not as much as family selection, but it does not degrade below the average singularity of parents in second-generation offspring
 parivaar varan visheshat: un gunon ke liye jo thodi maatra main anuvanshik hai, athwa jo vyaktigat jaanwaron main alag-alag nirdhaarit nahin kiye ja sakate, athwa jo kabhi maadaa main yaa kabhi nar main paae jate hai, athwa dirghajivita ke nirdhaaran ke liye joki jab tak koi praani vishesh praudh yaa vruddh nahin hota, spasht nahin hoti upyogi hota he
 Perfect family selection parivaar kii sankhya badi ho Family members have a very close relationship and tulana kiye janevaale pariwaron main se prayek parivaar ek jaisi sthiti tathaa vaataavaran main paley hon
 In horses, goats, sheep and other cattle, in which the offspring produced by a single parent is very small, family selection is not very important
 pashu jab baccha hi rahata he tabhi uske gunon ko dekhnaa hota he or tabhi santati varan laabhadaayak hota he
 But children are of low-grade heredity, or have characteristics of the same sex
 sahi sahi santati pareekshan ke liye nimnlikhit baaten aavashyak hai : It should include all the children, or at least the chosen sample also, duusare, janak se jin gunon kaa santanon ne praapt kiya ho unako baad kar diya jaay, yaa unka uchit yatharthata ke saath moolyankan ho or All the progenies who are being compared should be born in the same type of environment
 vistrut lekh ke liye dekhen - kritrim viryasechan The act of establishing a male in the female's vagina or uterus without natural intercourse with Venus has been in the laboratories for many years, especially in equine reproduction, to counteract impotence
 kintu iskaa vistrut prayog anya farm jaanwaron par pehle pahal roosi kaaryakartaaon dwaara 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main viksit kiya gaya, anya deshon main bhi yah visheshat: dugdhashalaon ke maweshiyon ke liye, apanaaya gaya
 For artificial semen, the male is collected by mating with a puppet female, or by erasing the penis of the male, ejaculating the semen
 ab veery ko uchit vilyan or andey ke pitak ke saath milakar tanukrut kar liya jaataa he, jisase keval ek baar ke hi skhlit veery se anek maadaaon ko garbhit karaayaa ja sake
 This diluted semen can be kept uterus for several days by keeping it at low temperature
 kritrim garbhashay se utpann santan prakritik maithun dwaara utpann santan kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Artificial semen does not require every animal husbandry to keep a bull, thus avoiding the difficulty and expense of keeping a bull
 prakritik dhang se garbhaadhan karaane kii apeksha kritrim viryasechan karaane kaa vyay adhik yaa kam pad saktaa he
 The act of artificial insemination is done by a trained person who recognizes and treats reproduction errors
 isse dhor sa prajnan sambandhi swasthya acha rahata he
 In order to reduce the cost of artificial insemination, it is necessary for the livestock owners to cooperate with the artificial insemination institutions
 maan-baap bananevaale vishesh naron or maadaaon kaa varan kar lene ke pashchaat doosraa kadam yah nishchit karnaa hota he ki kis maadaa ke saath kis nar kaa sangam karaayaa jaay
 If there is no fixed policy of cattle rearing, then any male union with a female is made within the entire group to be a parent and a mother
 yadi jode kaa chunaav unke paraspar sambandh ke aadhaar par hota he to sagamampaddati ant:prajnan se lekar janak ke puure samooh ke sambhavit vahi:prajnan tak ho sakati he
 These confluence methods can be combined, or manipulated, and applied to different methods of selection
 is prakaar anek prakaar kii prajnan yojanaon ko sambhav kiy ja saktaa he
 The method of confluence itself does not make any ancestral gene more or less infrequent, but it does alter the proportions of different combinations of ancestral genes and can alter the variability of the population, leading to selection if an irregular method of confluence
 Can be more effective than it is
 nikat ke sambandhiyon main sangam ant:prajnan kehalaata he
 This terminology is used for those in which the male and female of the pair have at least a cousin or cousin
 sameepvarti ant:prajnan kaa parinaam spasht or shighrata se hota he
 Moderate inbreeding can be effective if done for several generations
 ant:prajnan kaa pramukh prabhaav samayugmajata kii vruddhi karnaa or nasl ko spasht or asambadhit pariwaron main vibhakt karnaa hota he
 Inheritance As each family progresses, each family becomes more homogenous and different from other families within itself
 yah pariwaron ke bich prabhavakaari chayan kii sambhaavna kii vruddhi karata he
 Increase in homozygosity generates successive properties in more individuals
 chunki prabhavi kii apeksha aprabhavi gun praaia: bahut kam pasand kiya jaataa he, isse vyashti ke gunon main praaia: kuch ausat hraas paaya jaataa he, kyonki yah avaanchit aprabhavi gunon ko prakaash main laata he
 When interbred but unrelated individuals are hybridized, more life force is often displayed in the offspring than in the original livestock
 is prakaar ant: prajnan se saadhaarant: tatkaal ghaataa hota he, kintu kalantar main chune gaye ant: prajaat vanshakram kaa paraspar antaraasangam karaayaa jaataa he, tab laabh avashya hota he
 In order to remove any specific errors of a species or to include the ooze and any desired properties of chromosome, such pairs are selected in which there is no connection between them as much as possible
 vibhinn naslon, yaa ek hi spishij kii vibhinn jatiyon, kii varnsankarta se utpann santan praaia: asaadhaaran tivrata se vruddhi or ucch koti kii jeevanshkti kaa pradarshan karti he
 When the first generation of the hybrids are mutually reproduced, then the oz of the hybridity is often degraded

 This belief is also in an Indian article by Marx
 ’’ Wishing for the liberation of the Indian public from British domination, he wrote in 1833, "we can certainly hope to see a revival of that great and interesting country in the most remote period, where the words of the gentleman resident Prince Saltykov i am more clever and efficient than the Italian people, whose subordination is also balanced by a quiet dignity, who despite their innate laziness Rays officials have been amazed by his bravery, whose country is our languages, is the origin of our religions and where the ancient German in the format race, the nature of ancient Greece reflect Brahyan
 ’’ Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma evaluates Indian contexts from a Marxist point of view, but he himself prides himself on these values, while simultaneously telling his readers that India is a very ancient nation in terms of language and literature and thinking

 Pair skating is a form of figure skating
 antarrashtriya skating sangh ke niyam ke anusaar peyar tiimon main "ek purush va ek mahila" shaamil hote hai
 The sport is different from ice dancing and solo skating due to some elements involved in pair skating, including lifting your partner over the head, twist lifts, death spirals and throw jumps, etc
 timen ekal skating ke tatwon kaa pradarshan ek dusre ke saath lay main karti hai
 Pair skating is difficult because to achieve this level of cohesion it is imperative to have the same technique and timeliness of all elements of performance, as well as practice and mutual trust between peers

 peyar rup main skating kii sabase gambhir durghatnaayen hona aam he
 In February 1908, pair skating first appeared as a global competition, with three teams from Germany competing in St

 peyar lifts aamtaur par sar ke upar se, ghurnan karte hue tathaa barf ke sampark main arthath barf par duuri tay karte hue kii jaati hai
 Points like lift type, entry type, snow field and speed on ice as well as change of location, excellent condition of lady, durability and turning clarity of male, unloading type and unique features
 Both partners are usually on one leg when coming out of the lift
 kam duuri tay kiye jane par athwa lift ke dauraan gati ko ullekhneey rup se kam kiye jane par moolyankankarta unke ank kam kar sakate hai
 Alternatively, a hard entry or dismount, one-handed drop, move during lift, stop rotation and / or turn clockwise and vice versa is done to increase your score
 ghurnan ke bina kii gayi lifton ko kairi lift kehete hai
 The lift below the male's shoulder is called a dance lift and is done to get choreography points, so are stationary lifts, "just by staying in one place", without having to travel any distance goes
 lifton kaa vargeekaran purush kii pakad tathaa shuruyaat main ladi ko purush ke sar se upar uthaaye jane tak kii sthiti ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 For example, in the hip lift, the male lifts the lady by placing her hand on her hip, while in the press lift, the arm is lifted by hand
 sabase kathin prakaar kii lift excel laso lift ko mana jaataa he, jisamen purush dwaara haath-se-haath ko pakad kar uthaate samay ladi ek purna ghurnan puraa karti he
 Twist lifts, the only element found in pair skating, is a practice in which the male assists the lady with her axles or toes with the force of her toes where she rotates and is held in the air by the male Is caught, then he brings it back down to the ice
 kuch twist main, ladi ghurnan se pehle split kaa pradarshan karti he
 If both the legs are at least 45 ° from the axis of the body, then this increases the grade of execution
 koi jodi yadi kathin pravesh kaa pradarshan kare, deree se ghurnan kare athwa yadi ladi apane sar se upar apane donon haathon ko pakade to jodi ko praapt hone vaale ank bad jate hai
 Double and triple twist lifts are usually seen at higher levels; The first quadruple twist lift was performed by Marianna Cherkasova and Sergei Shakrai in the 1977 European competition

 antarrashtriya pratiyogita main iskaa pratham pradarshan 2006 ke sheetakaaleen olympix main kiya gaya tha
 Death spiral, an element found only in pair skating, is a practice in which the male swings the lady to a deeper angle while making a pivot, in which the position is almost horizontal to the ice
 outside age deth spiral apane insaide age roopon kii tulana main adhit kathin maane jate hai, inamen se bhi forward outside deth spiral sabase kathin mana jaataa he
 Points gained can be increased by performing difficult penetration such as shoot-the-duck or catch-foot situations, changing the hand grip during an element's performance and / or maintaining the catch-foot position
 peyar spin ek spin he jisamen donon saathi ek hi dhuree ke saapeksh, ek duusare ko pakade hue, chakkar katate rahete hai
 The extra balance gained by peers catching each other helps skaters achieve spin situations that are difficult, or simply not achievable, by the skater alone
 ghurnan gati, centring tathaa sthitiyon kii gunvattta tathaa kathinaayee praapt hone vaale ankon ko prabhavit karti hai
 The pairs can rotate in an inhomogeneous entrance or in the direction of the train and vice versa
 peyar skating karne vaale ekal skating ke tatwon ko bhi ek-duusare ke saamanjasy ke saath karte hai
 These elements include: jumping, spin, step sequence, spiral sequence and other field activities
 "ek ke rup main skating kar rahe do log" ke prakaash main, said-bai-said tatv kii gunvattta kaa moolyankan prayek scater ke pradarshan ke ausat ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, skaters should start side-by-side elements simultaneously, ending together while maintaining harmony and concord with each other the entire time
 said-bai-said koodon main, jodon ko ek hi kud puure saamanjasy ke saath tathaa ek duusare ke adhik se adhik nikat rahete hue kerani chahie
 yadi koi ek saathi ek kud ko underrotate karata he, donon koodon ko halkaa pradarshan karne vaale ke jitne hi ank praapt hote hai

 Pressure vessels are those characters in which a gas or liquid is kept at a pressure greater than or less than atmospheric pressure
 kisi bhi paatr main vayumandaleey daab se adhik yaa kam daab hona khatarnaak ho saktaa he or itihaas main kai bhayaavah durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 Therefore, the design, manufacture and operation of pressure vessels are controlled by the standards set by the concerned technologists
 For a sphere, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel is where: Other shapes besides a sphere have constants larger than 3 / 2, although some tanks, such as non-spherical wound composite tanks can approach this
 This is sometimes called a "bullet" for its shape, although in geometric terms it is a capsule
 For a cylinder with hemispherical ends, where In a vessel with an aspect ratio of middle cylinder width to radius of 2:1, Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a sphere is where σ θ { \ displaystyle \ sigma _{ \ theta }} is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction, σ l o n g { \ displaystyle \ sigma _{long}} is stress in the longitudinal direction, p is internal gauge pressure, r is the inner radius of the sphere, and t is thickness of the sphere wall
 a vessel can be considered "shallow-walled" if the diameter is at least 10 times greater than the wall depth
 Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a cylinder is where: Almost all pressure vessel design standards contain variations of these two formulas with additional empirical terms to account for wall thickness tolerances, quality control of welds and in-service corrosion allowances
 For example, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code formulas are: Spherical shells: Cylindrical shells: where e is the joint efficient, and all others variables as stated above
 The factor of safety is often included in these formulas as well, in the case of the ASME BPVC this term is included in the material stress value when solving for pressure or thicknes

 For this service, he received the status of Companion of the Order of Indian Empire
 inhone san 1887 se da deccan agriculchrists relif act ke antargat vishesh nyaayadhish ke padbhaar ko bhi sambhala
 Ranade was from a staunch Chitpavan Brahmin family

 After the death of his first wife, his reformers wanted him to marry a widow and save her
 parantu, unhone apane parivaar kaa maan rakhte hue, ek balika, ramabai ranade se vivaah kiya, jise baad main unhone shikshit bhi kiya
 After his death, his wife undertook his educational and social reforms

 It was based on the principles of published theism, which was based on the ancient Vedas
 prarthana samaaj maharashtra main keshav chandra sen ne armbh kiya tha, jo ek drudh brahmasamaji the
 It was originally committed to bring religious reforms in Maharashtra
 ranade saamaajik sammelan andolan ke bhi sansthaapak the, jise unhone mrityu paryant samarthan diya, jiske dwaara unhone samaaj sudhaar, jaise bal vivaah, vidhwaa mundan, vivaah ke aadambaron par baari aarthik vyay, sagarpar yatra par jaateey pratibandh ityadi kaa virodh kiya
 He laid full emphasis on widow remarriage and female education

 In a letter to Henri Fossett, Florence Nightengale wrote: 1943 main, babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne, ranade kii prashansa kii, evam unhen gandhi or jinah ke virdohi kaa darja diya
 Ranade has written many articles and books on social, religious, economic and political subjects

 He was opposed to revivalism
 punarutthanavaad kii simaaon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone apane ek lekh main likhaa tha ki- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false

 answermeamsa one of the six Indian philosophies
 uttarmimasaa ko 'shaareerik mimasaa' or 'vedantadarshan' bhi kehete hai
 These names are from the text called Brahmasutra created by Badarayana
 mimasaa shabd kaa arth he anusandhan, gambhir, vichaar, khoj
 The Vedas were considered the ultimate proof in ancient India
 veda vaanmay bahut vistrut he or usamen yajna, upasna or gyaan sambandhi mantra paae jate hai
 They are divided into parts called Mantras, Brahmanas and aranyaka-upanishads
 bahut pracheen hone ke kaaran vedavakyon ke arth, prayog or paraspar sambandh samanvay kaa gyaan lupt ho jane se unke sambandh main anusandhan karne kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Jaimini coordinated the sentences under the mantra and Brahmin parts in his treatise Mimamsasutra
 mantra or brahman veda ke purvabhag hone ke kaaran unke arth or upyog kii mimasaa kaa naam purvamimasaa padaa
 The sentences of the Aranyaka and Upanishads in the northern part of the Vedas were co-ordinated by Badarayana in the texts called Brahmasutra and hence he got the name Uttamimamsa
 uttarmimasaa shaareerik mimasaa bhi is kaaran kehalaata he ki isamen sharirdhari aatma ke liye un sadhano or upasnaon kaa sanket he jinke dwaara vah apane brahmatv kaa anubhav kar saktaa he
 It was named Vedanta philosophy because it coordinated the subjects of the sentences of the last part of the Veda
 iskaa naam brahmamimasaa athwa brahmasutra is kaaran padaa ki isamen vishesh vishay brahm or uske swaroop kii mimasaa he, jabaki purvamimasaa kaa vishay yajna or dharmik krity hai
 Uttaraimamsa is not only a representation and co-ordination of the meaning of Vedic sentences, it also considers philosophical problems related to Jiva, the world and Brahman
 ek sarvangin darshan kaa nirmaan karke uskaa yuktiyon dwaara pratipaadan or usase bhinn matvaale darshanon kaa khandan bhi kiya gaya he
 Philosophically, this part is considered very important
 samast brahmasutra main chaar adhyay hai or prayek adhyay main chaar paad hai
 The first four sutras of the first chapter in the first chapter and the first and second feet of the second chapter cover almost all the things related to Vedanta philosophy
 inamen hi vedantadarshan ke upar jo akshep kiye ja sakate hai ve or vedant ko duusare darshanon main-purvamimasaa, buddha, jain, vaisheshik, pashupat darshanon main, jo us samay prachlit the-jo trutiyaan dikhaai detii hai ve aa jaati hai
 Because all the texts are in the form of subtle and hard formulas, it is not so simple that everyone can understand its meaning and consistency
 guru log in sutron ke dwaara apane shishyon ko upanishdon ke vichaar samajhaayaa karte the
 Over time, all his knowledge disappeared and there was a need to write commentaries on him
 sabase pracheen bhashya, jo is samay prachlit or prapya he, shri shankaracharya kaa he
 After Shankara and the Acharyas also wrote commentaries on the Brahmasutra to confirm the opinions of their sect and in accordance with their opinions
 shri ramanujacharya, shri madhwacharya, shri nimbarkacharya or shri vallabhacharya ke bhashya prakhyat hai
 The views of all these masters, despite being similar in some parts, are very different
 swayan baadaraayan ke vichaar kya hai, yah nishchit karnaa or kis acharya kaa bhashya baadaraayan ke vichaaron kaa samarthan karata he or unke anukool he, yah kahana bahut kathin he kyonki sutara bahut duruh hai
 This problem is also associated with this problem, what are the philosophical views of the Upanishads who have tried to coordinate in the Brahmasutra
 baadaraayan ne unako kya samajha or bhashyakaron ne unako kya samajha he? vahi bhashya adhiktar thik samajha janaa chahie jo upanishdon or brahmasutra donon ke anuroop ho
 From this point of view, Shri Shankaracharya's opinion seems more expedient
 kuch vidvan ramanujacharya ke mat ko adhik sutranukool batalaate hai
 The most special philosophical principle of Uttamimamsa is that the root world
 Chetan Brahm is the cause and cause of the cause
 jaise makadi apane bheetar se hi jaal taanati he, vaise hi brahm bhi is jagat ko apni hi shakti dwaara utpann karata he
 Not only this, he is its parent and he also destroys it
 jeev or brahm kaa tadatmya he or anek prakaar ke sadhano or upasnaon dwaara vah brahm ke saath tadatmya kaa anubhav karke jagat ke karmjanjaal se or barambar ke jivan or maran se mukt ho jaataa he
