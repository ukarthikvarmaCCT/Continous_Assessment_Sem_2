 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers

 According to the stories seen by Smriti Patra in the past in the second and sixth editions, he was beautiful and tall with pale skin, jet black hair and dark brown eyes

 It is speculated that the reason for his becoming a human being was to divide his soul into a Horcrux in his desire to become immortal

 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness

 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love

 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he

 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort kii jaadui gyaan kisi bhi jivit jaadugar se bahut adhik he or yahan tak ki voldemort ke puri shakti ke saath lautne par uske mantron ke saamne dambldor ke paas sabase taqatvar bachaav mantra hone kaa gyaan bhi aparyaapt hoga
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts
 parantu voldemort main yah vilakshan pratibha tathaa kaushal hote hue bhi vah pyaar jaise shaktishaalee jaadu kaa saamana karne main ayogy tha; is samay koi shaktiyaan kaam nahin karti thi

 a man, revealed to be Jacques Sonier, is chased by a mysterious masked man named Silas at the Grand Gallery in Louvre in Paris
 silas, priari ke clef de voûte yaa "keestone" ke sthaan kaa pataa maangata he
 Under death threats, Saunier eventually confesses that Keystone is housed in the storehouse of the Church of St
 Sulpice, "under the rose
" " silas use dhanyavad detaa he or phir use pet main goli maar detaa he
 Meanwhile, French police contact American iconographer Robert Langdon, who went to Paris as an AUP guest lecturer on symbols and the holy woman, to visit the crime scene in the Louvre
 ve pate hai ki souniar ne marate hue halki kaali syaahi or apane swayan ke sharir or rakt kaa upyog karte hue jatil rup se kuch pradarshit karne kii koshish kii he
 Captain Bezu Fak asks him about his interpretation of the first scene
 silas, "da teacher " naam ke ek rahasyamay aadmi ko bulaata he or khulaasa karata he ki usne keestone ke sabhi chaar sangrakshakon ko maar diya he or yah bhi kaha ki maare gaye sabhi ne usee khaas sthaan kii pushti kii he
 He wears a metal mole on his thigh and flogs himself with a whip for the sins of murder
 iske baad silas, bishap minial aringarosa dwaara suvidha hasil karke saint-salpaais jaataa he or use ek bujurg nan dwaara bhartee kiya jaataa he; akele hone par, vah carch kii farsh khodta he use ek pathar miltaa he jis par likhaa hota he job 38:11
 uskaa saamana nan se hota he, jo ek pankti ko uddhrut karti he: "hidartu shail daau kam, bat no fardar" 
 yah ehsaas hone par ki use dhokhaa diya gaya he, silas kafa ho jaataa he or nan ko maar detaa he
 Sophie Nevu, a pseudo-specialist in the French police, enters the Louvre and secretly gives Langdon a message that leads him to the men's room
 vahaan, sophy usase milti he or use bataati he ki us par nazar rakhi ja rahi he, ek GPS trekking dot ko uski jacket main daal diya gaya he or kaha ki laash ke paas mili ek pankti kii vajah se vah is hatya ke maamle main mukhya sandigdh he "
 sophy haalanki maanati he ki, souniar, jo pataa chalata he ki uske dada the, use ek gupt sandesh dena chaahate the or vah lengdon ko is sameekaran main laana chaahate the taaki vah code ko todane main sophy kii madad kar sake
 In the time gained by removing the tracking device, they both begin to rinse the Louvre and they get a few more anagram messages left by Saunier
 inamen se kai, leonardo da vinci kii kala se sambandhit hote hai or donon ko madonna of da rox ke peeche kumudini ke phool ke saath ek chaabi milti he
 After being chased by French police and cut off from the US embassy, they both escape to Bois de Boulogne where Langdon closely inspects the key
 ek sire par unhen kuch ankit dikhataa he jo ek pataa he
 That address directs them to the Depository Bank of Zurich where that key is used for a safety box
 bank main unhen souniar kaa jamaa box miltaa he or ve use 10 anko vaale febonaki sankhya ke kram kaa upyog karke kholte hai
 Inside the box, they find a container of rosewood, which contains a cryptogram: a cylindrical container with a five-alphabetical numbered sheet, in which it is necessary to read the five-letter code in the correct sequence in order to open it again inside it
 The parchment message kept can be seen
 us guptalekh ko jabardastee kholane par uske andar rakhi sirka kii shishi tut jaaegi jo charmpatr ko kharaab karte hue sandesh ko nasht kar degi
 Unfortunately, the police are called by a security guard and they are forced to leave the place
 bank manager, andre vernett, batch kar nikalne main unki sahaayta karte hai or unhen police dwaara kii jane vaali niyamit jaanch se bachaane ke liye ek bakhtarband vine main yatriyon ke rup main le jate hai
 Langdon and Nevu, sitting in the back of the truck, have a long discussion about cryptography and Nevu says that his grandfather often played with him with cryptography
 lengdon kehete hai ki guptalekh main bahumoolya jaankaree ho sakati he yaa jo ve khojane kii koshish kar rahe hai uske bare main ek or suraag ho saktaa he
 Eventually, they suddenly stop at one place and Vernet asks them to give the crypt at gunpoint
 lengdon, jhansa dekar vernett ko nihattha kar detaa he or vah or sophy guptalekh ke saath vahaan se batch kar bhaag jate hai
 Langdon suggests that they should go to his friend, Le Tebbing, to get help to open that cryptex
 le tibing, pavitra grel kaa ek utsaahi khoji nikalataa he, jo yah maanata he ki vastav main, grel koi cap nahin he, balki meri megdelen he jise isliye bhaga diya gaya tha kyonki yishu ke anuyaayi, apane netaa kii hatya ke baad ek aurat kaa anugaman nahin karnaa chaahate the
 Mary was pregnant at the time and Teabing tells Sophie that a secret society was formed to protect Jesus' lineage
 mana jaataa he ki jaik souniar is samaaj kaa ek hissaa the or tibing ko andeh he ki vah sophy ko isamen shaamil hone ke liye prashikshan de rahe the
 Silas, meanwhile, sneaks into Teabing's mansion and attempts to steal the cryptex
 tibing, apni chadi kaa upyog karte hue silas ko behosh kar detaa he or phir ve log naukar, remi jin or silas ko lekar vahaan se batch kar nikal jate hai
 From Teabing's plane, the team arrives in London chasing the next clue
 yah pataa chalata he ki remi jin bhi vastav main da teacher kaa ek anuyaayi he, magar ek rahasyamay aadmi dwaara silas ko mukt karaane ke baad use maar diya jaataa he
 Silas is attacked by the police and in the shoot-out he accidentally shoots Bishop Manuel Aringarosa
 du:kha se abhibhoot hokar silas, police kii goliyon se aatmahatya main mar jaataa he or aringarosa ko aspataal le jaaya jaataa he, saath hi saath fah use dhokhaa dene ke jurm main giraftaar kar letaa he
 As Langdon gets closer to solving the mystery, he is betrayed by Teabing, who is then revealed to be The Teacher
 tibing bataata he ki vah meri megdelen ke avshesh khojna chahta he taaki vah sabit kar sake ki pavitra grel ke bare main vah sahi tha or dhamkee detaa he ki agar lengdon ne code ko nahin kholaa to vah sophy ko goli maar degaa
 In response, Langdon throws the cryptex into the air
 tibing usko lapakata he, lekin vah zamin par gir jaataa he
 The vial of vinegar breaks and apparently spreads over the document and destroys it
 tibing ke giraftaar hone ke baad, yah pataa chalata he ki lengdon ne code ko sulajhaa liya he or use phenkane se pehle guptalekh se suraag hataa diya tha
 Using clues, they go to the Rozalin Chapel in Scotland where the remains of Magdalene were previously hidden
 vahaan, ve gupt sanghathan ke anya sadasyon se milte hai jisane uski raksha kii thi
 It is revealed that Sophie is actually a descendant of Magdalene and is therefore the current living descendant of Jesus Christ
 ve use surakshit rakhane kii kasam khate hai
 Langdon and Sophie split up shortly thereafter
 hajaamat banaate vakt lengdon galati se khud ko kaat letaa he or sinc par khun kii rekha use gulab rekha kii yaad dilaati he
 He follows the rose line and discovers the location of the Holy Grail, buried below in the pyramid at the Louvre

 holocost samooche yahudee logon ko jad se khatm kar dene kaa sochaa-samajha or yojanabaddh prayaas tha
 In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and established a racist empire, in which Jews were labeled sub-human and were not considered part of the human race
 1939 main germany dwaara vishwa yuddh bhadakaane ke baad hitler ne yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke liye apane antim hal ko amal main laana shuru kiya
 His soldiers began to squeeze the Jews into certain areas
 unase kaam karwaane, unhen ek jagah ikattha karne or maar daalane ke liye vishesh camp sthapit kiye gaye, jinamein sabase kukhyat tha oschvitz
 Jews were brought to these camps and killed in the closed rooms, leaving poisonous gas
 jinhen kaam karne ke kaabil nahin samajha jaataa, unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa, jabaki baaki bache yahudiyon main se zyaadaatar bhukh or beemaari se dam tod dete
 Documents revealed after the war reveal that Hitler's motive was to eliminate every single Jew from the world
 yuddh ke chah saal ke dauraan naajiyon ne takreeban 60 lakh yahudiyon kii hatya kar di, jinamein 15 lakh bachche the
 Hitler carried out his objective of eradicating Jews so effectively that one-third of the world's Jewish population was destroyed
 yah narsanhaar sankhya, prabandhan or kriyanvayan ke lihaaj se vilakshan tha
 Under this, people of a community started being killed wherever they met, simply because they were born Jewish
 in kaarnon ke chalate hi ise apni tarah kaa naam diya gaya-holocost
 Several answers have been offered to this question: religious, historical, philosophical, psychological, and Marxist
 lekin koi bhi ek jawaab kabhi santoshjanak nahin ho saktaa
 The historical answer goes like this - In the 1930s a large part of the German population agreed to live in a society that was based on hatred, the concept of ethnic superiority and violence
 ve jis vyavastha se bandhe the, uski kendriya dharna yah thi ki yahudee log har us cheez kii numaaindgi karte hai, jo germanon ke khilaaf he or isliye yahudiyon ko khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 This notion was also associated with a racialized view of the world, which considered the Germans to be part of the master race and the Jews of the anti race with destructive physical qualities
 jab yahudiyon kaa bhugolic rup se khaatmaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa, tab unhone sabase kattar rasta akhriyaar kiya, jo tha- antim hal
 More such incidents are found in history, but some things of the Holocaust make it unique
 naaji germany ke alaava bhi kai sarkaron ne camp system or technolji kaa sahaara liya or itihaas ke zyaadaatar hisse main yahudiyon kaa katl kiya jaataa rahaa
 But the Holocaust can be said to be different for two main reasons
 1
 duusare samoohon ke prati apni nitiyon se alag naajiyon ne har yahudee ko maarane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 For this, they did not care about age, sex, faith or work
 unhone is makasad ko anjaam dene ke liye khaas taur par ek aadhunik naukarshahi kaa istemaal kiya
 2
 The Nazi leadership said that eradicating Jews from the world would be beneficial for the German people and the whole of humanity
 haalanki asal main yahudiyon kii ore se unhen koi khatra nahin tha

 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor

 The effects of climate factors on climate are complicated by various processes
 sarvaadhik spasht pratyuttaron main se ek kaa sambandh jal ke vashpikaran se he
 The heat produced by the mixing of long-term greenhouse effect gases such as carbon dioxide causes a greater amount of water vaporization in the atmosphere

 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate

 Thus, the greenhouse effect depends on the speed at which the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with elevation, if the temperature rate is low then the greenhouse effect will be higher and if the rate of temperature fall is low then the greenhouse effect will be less

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent
 sankshep main, hindutv ke pramukh tatva nimnlikhit hai-hindu-dharm hindu-koun?-- goshu bhakthirbhavedyasya pranave c drudha matih
 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs

 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina

 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever

 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai

 sandhi ke niyam keval bhaaropee bhashaaon main hi nahin hai balki koriayan jaisi ural-altic parivaar kii bhashaaon main bhi hai
 Treaty is a "natural" or spontaneous action, just as blue and red combine to become a purple color
 sandhi ke mukhyatah teen bhed hai - When a new word is formed by combining two vowels, the vowel is formed
 swar sandhi ke mukhya bhed nimnlikhit hai a mixture of similar vowels etc
 becomes long vowels
 yatha– a + a = a - Lotus + Asan = Kamalasana a +aa= aa — him + aalay = himalay Aa + a = aa-vidya + Artha = Student aa + aa = aa — maha + aalay = mahalay e + e = e - Giri + Indra = Girindra i + i = i — nadi + ish = nadeesh u + u = o - short + urmi = short uu + u = uu — vadhoo + utsav = vadhootsav The combination of different vowels leads to a merit
 iske kuch pramukh niyam is prakaar hai- When Harsva or long "A" is followed by Harsva or long "I", both are replaced by "A"
 jaise a + e = a - Bharat + Indu = Bharatendu aa+ i = e — rama + ish = ramesh a + e = a - Maha + Indra = Mahendra a+ i = e — gana + ish = ganesh When Harsva or long "A" is followed by Harsva or long "U", both are replaced with "O"
 jaise a + u = o - Moon + Uday = Moon aa + u = o — maha + udai = mahoday Aa + Oo = o - Ganga + Urmi = Gangormi a + uu = o — jal + urmi = jalormi When Harsva or long "A" is followed by Harsva or long "ॠ", both are replaced with "ar"
 jaise a + r = Ar - Dev + Rishi = Devarshi aa + ri = ar — maha + rishi = maharishi Its main sources are jab hrasv yaa deergh "a" ke baad "e" yaa "i" aae to donon ke sthaan par "i" ho jaataa he
 like a+ e = i — atra + ev = atraiv Aa + Ai = Ai - Maha + Aishwarya = Maheshvarya a+ i = i — mat + aikya = mataiky Aa + a = Ai - Always + Ave = Always jab hrasv yaa deergh "a" ke baad "o" yaa "ou" aae to donon ke sthaan par "ou" ho jaataa he
 like a + o = ou — sundar + odan = sundaraudan a + o = o - One + Medicine = Forest medicine aa + o = ou — maha + oj = mahouj Aa + Au = Au - Maha + Medicine = Mahoshadhi iske kuch pramukh niyam is prakaar hai- When "I" or "E" is followed by any other vowel other than "I" or "E", "I" or "E" is replaced by "Y"
 jaise Abhi + Uday = Abhyuday iti +aadi = ityadi When "U" or "oo" is followed by any other vowel other than "U" or "oo", "U" or "oo" is replaced by "V"
 jaise Su + input = welcome anu + eshan = anveshan Bride + Arrival = Slaughter jab "ri" ke baad "ri" ke atirikt koi anya swar aae to "ri" ke sthaan par "r" ho jaataa he
 like matra + aadesh = matradesh Pitru + Adi = Pitradi jab "e", "i", "o" evam "ou" ke baad koi anya swar aae to inke sthaan par kramshah "ay", "aay", "av" "aav" ho jaataa he
 like ne +an =nayan Gai + Ak = Singer po + an = pawan Nine + iq = sailor jab do vyanjanon yaa vyanjan or swar ke mail se ek nayaa shabd banataa he to ise vyanjan sandhi kehete hai
 Such as: -dik + Yaj = Giants + Ish = Vagish jab pehle shabd ke ant main sthit visarg ke duusare shabd ke pratham akshar se sanyukt hone par nayaa shabd banataa he to visarg sandhi hoti he
