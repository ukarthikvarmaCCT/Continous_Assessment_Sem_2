 Gulf therefore thought of opposing Pickens, which included re-filing as "delaware Corporation" so that shareholders could not vote en masse and shocked the financial world by acquiring General Electric, listening to Ashland Oil's offer )) And finally Chevron drove his white horse in late 1984
 Gulf relinquished ownership of many of its worldwide subsidiaries and merged with Chevron in the spring of 1985

 It has 10 digits
 iske rachanaakaar maharaj shudrak hai
 The background of the play is Pataliputra
 bharat ke anusaar das roopon main se yah 'mishra prakaran' kaa sarvottam nidarshan he
 The play 'mrithakkatikam' is a proof that India has inherited the tradition of giving the last man a place in literature where people like thieves, courtesans, poor Brahmins, handmaids, barbers, overthrow the evil king and establish a republic to establish the heroism from the last man Are received
 mrichhakaticam kii kathavstu kavi pratibha se prasut he
 Sarvatava Vipravar Charudatta, a resident of Ujjayini, is the protagonist of this episode and Vasantasena is the heroine born in the clan of the Sunni
 charudutt kii patni dhoota purvaparigrah ke anusaar jyeshtha he jisase charudutt ko rohitsen naam kaa ek putr he
 Charudatta was once very prosperous but had become poor due to his mercy, though he had a great reputation for authenticity, courtesy and honesty
 vasantsena nagar kii shobhaa he, atyant udaar, manaswini evam vyavahaarakushla, rupagunsampanna saadhaarani navyauvana nayika uttam prakruti kii he or vah asaadharan gunon se mugdh ho us par nirvyaj prem karti he
 Being a Sadharani and an acceptable heroine, it is considered a narrow episode
 isaki kathavstu tatkaaleen samaaj kaa purna rup se pratinidhitiv karti he
 This throws a lot of light not only on the individual subject but also on the governance and state of this era
 saath hi saath vah naagarik jivan kaa bhi yathavat chitra ankit karata he
 In this, the social form of the decoration of the city, the behavior of the vagrants, the practice of slavery, the game of gambling, the slyness of wits, the chauvinism, the system of adjudication in the court, the maliciousness of the subjects towards the undesired king, and the dominance of public opinion
 
 saath hi samaaj main daridrajan kii sthiti, guniyon kaa sanman, sukh du:kha main samroop maitri ke bidarshan, upakrit varg kii kritagyata, nirparaadh ke prati dand par kshobh, raaj vallabhon ke atyaachaar, vaaranari kii samruddhi evam udaartaa, pranay kii vedi par balidaan, kulanganaon kaa adarsh charitra jaise vaiyaktik vishyon par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he

 mrichctic’ kii katha kaa kendra he ujjayini
 He is such a big city that the conductor of Pataliputra comes to settle his fame and gain business after hearing his fame
 hamen isamen chaaturvarnya kaa samaaj miltaa he – brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra
 The main work of the Brahmins was Purohitai, but they were also interested in the rule
 is katha main jo ek badi gambheer baat milti he vah yah he ki yahan brahman, vyapaaree or nimnavarna milakar madandh kshatriya rajya ko ukhaad phenkate hai
 It is worth noting
 or phir sochane kii baat yah he ki is katha kaa lekhak raja shudrak mana jaataa he jo kshatriyon main shreshth kaha gaya he
 There are ten digits in Mruthaktik, each number has multiple scenes
 is naatak main ek sachharitra kintu garib brahman charudatt kii kahani he jise saundaryamayi ganika vasantsena prem karti he
 With this, the political story of Aryak's statehood is also intertwined
 kritikar ne donon kathaon ko kushalta se joda he
 The play is broadly divided into two parts - first, the love affair of Vasantasena and Charudatta and the second, with the rebellion of Aryak attaining Rajpada
 pehla ank : is ank main yah katha he ki raja kaa saalaa shaakaar ujjayini kii prasiddh ganika vasantsena ko paanaa chahta he
 He pursues Vasantasena on a dark night with his two companions
 bhaybheet vasantsena charudatt ke ghar main shaaran leti he
 She leaves all her gold-clad as a heritage in Charudatta's house, telling her to escape the thieves
 doosraa ank : samvahak, jo pehle charudatt kii seva main tha, jue kii lat lagane par bahut sa dhan haar jaataa he
 He takes Sharan to the house of Vasantasena for rescue, who gives him a bracelet and makes him free
 vah buddha-bhikshu ban jaataa he
 Third issue: a Brahmin named Sharvilak loves Vasantasena's maid Madanika
 use daasatv se chhudaane ke liye vah ek raat charudatt ke ghar main send lagaakar vasantsena dwaara dharohar rakhe gaye sone ke saare aabhushan chura letaa he
 On the other hand, Chaudutt's paternal wife Dhuta gives her precious Ratnavali in exchange for stolen robes to save her husband from Loknanda, Chaudutt gives the Ratnavali and sends the clown Maitreya to Vasantasena's house
 chauthaa ank : sharvilak churaae hue aabhushan lekar madnika ko daasatv se mukt karaane ke liye vasantsena ke ghar pahunchataa he
 Madanika is very sad to hear about the theft
 is galati ko sudhaarney kii bhaavana se vah sharvilak ko yah samajhaati he ki chori ke aabhushan vasantsena ko saunp dene se na vah chor rahegaa, na charudatt ke sir par rin rahegaa or vasantsena ke aabhushan use vaapis mil jaayenge, sharvilak aisa hi karata he
 He tells Vasantasena that Charudatta has sent the message that we cannot keep the goldsmith safe by having a dilapidated house, so keep it with you
 vasantsena sandesh ke badale main kuch le jane kii baat kahkar madnika ko sharvilak ko saunp detii he
 In this issue, the clown meets Vasantasena and says that Swarnapatra has lost in gambling, so accept this Ratnavali
 vasantsena vaastaviktaa jaanati he, par kuch nahin karti
 She decides to come to Charudatta's house in the evening
 paanchavaan ank : is ank main varsha-ritu varnan hua he
 Vasantasena meets Charudatta and stays overnight at his house due to rain
 chatha ank : subah charudatt pushpkarndak udyaan main ghoomane jaataa he, vasantsena ke liye gaadi taiyaar rakhane kaa aadesh dekar taaki vah usamen udyaan tak yatra kar sake
 It is here that Vasantasena sees Chaudatta's son Rohsen insisting that he wants to play with a gold ball, not a clay car
 vasantsena saare aabhushan mitti kii gaadi main rakhkar kahati he ki isse sone kii gaadi bana lenaa
 Vasantasena comes out to meet Charudatta in the garden, but mistakenly sits in the car park standing at the same place
 udhar karagaar todakar, rakshak ko markar nikal bhaaga gwaale kaa betaa aryak, bachaav ke liye charudatt ke vaahan main chadh jaataa he
 On the way, two police soldiers - Veerak and Chandanak, also see the vehicle, but one of them lets Aryaak go by promising to protect him
 saatvaan ank : raja paalak ne sidhon kii bhavishyavaanee par vishwaas karke jis aryak naamak vyakti ko bandi bana liya tha, jab vah bandhan todakar bachataa hua charudatt kii gaadi main chadhakar udyaan main charudatt ke samaksh aata he or unase shaaran maangata he
 Charudatta gets him safely out of his car
 aathvaan ank : bhul se shaakaar kii gaadi main baithi vasantsena jab udyaan main pahunchati he to charudatt ke sthaan par dusht shaakaar se uskaa saamana hota he
 Vasantasena once again falls into the clutches of Shakara, on not accepting Shakkar's insistence, he strangles Vasantasena and leaves him covered with leaves knowing he is dead
 tabhi juaari se buddha-bhikshu ban chukaa samvahak mritpraaya vasantsena ko vihaar main laakar punerjeevan detaa he
 Number nine: Shakara makes Charudatta accused of killing Vasantasena
 nyaayalay main vivaad chalata he, charudatt swayan ko nirdosh sabit nahin kar paata
 Unhappy Charudatta waits for his friend Maitreya, who had gone to Vasantasena to return the jewelery that Vasantasena had given him to make a gold car instead of Rohsen's clay cart
 isi kshan vahi aabhushan lekar maitrey aa jaataa he
 But while talking to Maitreya, they fall in front of everyone holding the wall and it is believed that Chaudutt has killed Vasantasena in the greed of jewelery
 use mrityudand kaa aadesh dekar vadhasthal kii ore le jaaya jaataa he
 Tenth Issue: In this issue, one of the Shakara servants declares the perpetrator Charudatta innocent, but no one believes him
 duusare thik isi samay praan bachaane vaale buddha-bhikshu bane samvahak ke saath aakar vasantsena shaakaar kii dushtataa vyakt kar detii he or charudatt jhuthe aarope se mukt ho jaataa he
 Here the new king Aryak arrives in the kingdom, he not only gives the kingdom to the chargeless Charudatta, but also gives death penalty to Shakara due to false accusation
 kintu charudatt ke kehane par shaakaar ko bhi kshamaa kar diya jaataa he
 On hearing the news of the death sentence for Pativrata Dhuta Charudatta gets ready to fire, Charudatta is present and stops this sad incident
 raja aryak prasann hokar vasantsena ko ‘vadhoo’ ke pad se vibhooshit karata he
 The monk conductor is made the chancellor of all the viharas
 das sthvarak ko daastaa se mukt kiya jaataa he, mrityudand dene valechandalon ko chandalon kaa pramukh bana diya jaataa he, yahan tak ki shaakaar ko bhi abhaydaan diya jaataa he
 The play ends with these happy events
 mrichctic kii na keval kathavstu hi atyant rochak he, apitu kavi kii charitra chithran kii chaaturi bahut ucch koti kii he
 Though it has a predominant rasa vipralambha adornment, there is an easy harmony of the various juices of the heart like humor, compassion, terrible and vatsalya
 greek natyakala kii drushti se bhi parakhe jane par iskaa mulya paashchaatya manishiyon dwaara bahut unchaa aankaa gaya he
 Its language is endowed with prasad quality is extremely Pranjal
 praakrit ke vividh swaroopon kaa darshan isamen hota he- praacha, magadhi or shauraseni ke atirikt, sarvottam praakrit maharashtri or aavanti ke bhavy nidarshan yahan uplabdh hote hai
 According to Grierson, the use of takki Prakrit is also found in Shakari Vibhash in this case
 shabdachayan main maadhuri evam arthvyakti kii ore kavi ne savishesh dhyaan diya he, jisase aavanti evam vaidarbhi reeti kaa nirvaah purna rup se hua he
 There are two stories in Mrithaktik
 ek charudatt kii, duusari aryak kii
 The legend of Gunadhya tells the revolt of Gopal Darak Aryak
 brihatkatha apane mul rup main pashachi bhashaa main ‘baddkaha’ ke naam se likhi gai thi
 This shows that this play is of the first century AD or the second century AD
 yah naatak sanskrit sahitya main apana vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 in this- ye isaki visheshtaayen hai
 The political feature of this play is that it has been described as bad Kshatriya king
 gop-putr 'aryak' ek gwaala he, jise kavi raja banaata he
 Although the poet considers Varnashrama, he makes Gopa the king
 aisa lagata he ki yah moolkatha puraani he or sambhavtah yah ghatana koi vaastavik ghatana he jo kinvadanti main rah gai
 The depiction of slavery society is very beautiful and we find it in the time of Chanakya, when the word 'arya' is used as 'citizen'
 ho saktaa he, koi puraani kinvadanti chanakya ke baad ke samay main is katha main utar ai ho
 During the time of Buddha, the rise of traders was also considerable
 tab ujjayini kaa rajya alag tha, kosal kaa alag
 Ujjayini is also described here
 ek jagah lagata he ki us samay bhi bharat kii ekta kaa abhas tha, jab kaha gaya he ki 'sari prithvi aryak ne jeet lee' – vah prithvi jisaki kailas pataakaa he
 If seen, the poet was realistic and impartial
 usne sabaki achchhaayiyaan or buraaiyaan dikhaai hai or badi gaharaai se chithran kiya he
 This is the reason for his success
 yah maharaj shudrak kii kriti maani jaati he jo bhaas or kalidas kii bhaanti raaj kavi hue hai
 Mritchkatik AD can be said to be composed around the first century
 kaha jaataa he, bhasapranit 'charudutt' naamak chaturangi roopak kii kathavstu ko parivardhit kar kisi parvarti shudra kavi ke dwaara mrichctic kii rachana hui he
 In fact, the basis of its narrative is found in the stories narrated in Brihatkatha and Kathasaritsagara
 mrichctic’ kii katha kaa kendra he ujjayini
 He is such a big city that the conductor of Pataliputra comes to settle his fame and gain business after hearing his fame
 us samay vah patliputra ko mahanagar nahin kahata
 This means that Ujjayini was more important than Pataliputra at that time
 spasht hi patliputra buddha ke samay main patliputra tha, jabaki ujjayini main mahasen chand pradyot kaa samrudh rajya tha
 The second antiquity is that there is a lot of slavery in it
 das-daasi dhan dekar azaad kar liye jate the
 The courtesans also became brides in that society
 yah sab baaten aise samaaj kii hai, jahaan zyaada kadai nahin milti, jo baad main chaalu hui thi
 Rather, the poet has set a new ideal in the society by making the bride a bride
 usamen vidroh kii bhaavana he
 He kills the oppressor like an animal, elevates the woman and the slave frees the settler
 yon kah sakate hai ki yah naatak joki shastreey shabdon main prakaran he – bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 Who knows, how many social dramas were lost in the cheek of the times
 hunon se lekar turkon tak ke vidhwanson ne na jane kitne granth-ratna jala daale ! Many commentaries were written on the mrithkatik
 iske anek anuwaad bhi hue hai or anek sanskaran bhi prakashit ho chuke hai
 Among them is the most ancient commentary by Prithidhar

 yah game sabase vaastavik samay ranneeti khelon ke samaan he, jab tak ki ek taraf istipha nahin diya jaataa he
 In the Age of Age of Empires III, the player progresses through the technical "era", representing a period of historical time; These provide greater improvements, access to units and buildings

 raajnneetijna ko us avadhi se samanyikrut sheershak diya jaataa he jo aamtaur par bonus ko darshata he: udhaaharan ke liye, "da nachurlist" khilaadi ko chaar gaayon ko detaa he, jabaki "da general" baarah muskatirs or baari topakhane kaa ek tukdaa detaa he
 As the player's home city level rises, more politicians are unlocked — one for every ten home city levels — up to 60 such

 Most cards are available for all civilizations, but some are unique to one
 If there is more than one deck when Home City is being played, the player must choose when to send the first shipment
 ek game ke dauraan khilaadiyon ne yah praarambhik deck rakhaa he; yah suvidha khilaadiyon ko un deck ke nirmaan ke liye protsaahit karti he jo maanchitr par kheli jaati hai, yaa anya council ke liye anukulit hai

 khel kii aadhaar ikai, aabaadakaar he, jo sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye sansadhano ko ikattha karne or imaaraton ke nirmaan ke liye jimmedaar he
 The number of units a player can control in a scenario is limited by the "population limit", a common real-time strategy game mechanic
 gharon or nagar kendron kii shuruyaat seemaa 200 se adhik tak bad jaati he, jabaki prayek ikai kaa utpaadan hota he, jansankhya kii gananaa bad jaati he
 Basic units such as settlers and infantry are counted as 1, but others, including most cavalry and mercenary infantry, 2 more powerful units, especially artillery or mercenary cavalry, 7's Can count more for population
 mul yoddhaon, khojakarta, prashikshit or charaai vaale jaanwaron, garm hawa ke gubaare or yupoton kii gananaa jansankhya seemaa ke liye nahin kii jaati he, lekin aam taur par ek nirmaan seemaa hoti he, jisase khilaadi ek samay main keval un vishisht ikaayiyon kii ek nishchit sankhya ko tainaat kar sakate hai
 Military units are used to compete against other players

 a new unit introduced in Edge of Empires III is the Explorer, which is primarily responsible for collecting treasures, but is also capable of creating trading posts and also for special attacks used on player orders
 Is capable

 This ransom is credited to the player who disabled him when applicable

 Mercenaries are not trained like standard units; Instead, they can be sent from home city or hired for more coins than saloons, so that only economically powerful players can get their employment

 Incidentally, along with the hero / explorer units, the marauders had to kill units such as spies, agents and ninja
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, mul america janajatiyon kaa chayan khel ke nakshe ko vyavasthit karata he, or apane swayan ke sainya ikaayiyon kaa samarthan karata he jinhen ek gathbandhan banane ke baad prashikshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some resident US military units used mouth weapons, some used indigenous range weapons, such as bows and arrows or atlas-atlas, while still others carried European gunpowder weapons
 ye ikaiyaan aamtaur par paidal sena yaa ghudsavaar varg ke virgon se sambandhit hoti hai, lekin, pani ke saath nakshe par, godi ke madhyam se khilaadi ke liye keno bhi uplabdh hote hai
 Buildings play a large role in the gameplay, as they are used for training civilian and military units, exploring improvements, supporting the population, providing structural defense, or as resource providers
 game main chitrit imaaraton us yug ke vaastushilp dizin ke samaan hai
 All the games in the series share several buildings, including the town center and the docks
 yug ke madhyam se khilaadi ke unnayan ke rup main ek imaarat kii upasthiti or visheshtaon ko parivartan kar sakate he, or kuch sabhyataaon main apni swayan kii anuthi imaaraten hai
 The performance of these buildings depends on civilization
 kuch imaaraton ko keval kuch samay par rakshaatmak toweron jaise banaaya ja saktaa he
