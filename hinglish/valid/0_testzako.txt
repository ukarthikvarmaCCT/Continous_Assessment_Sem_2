 This lack of nature in daily life can lead to some social disorders along with some harmful social changes
 in sampurna aniyamittaaon ko Nature Deficit Disorder kaa naam diya gaya he
 The term was first used by Richard Lauw in his famous book Last Child in the Woods
 Nature Deficit Disorder kisi chikitsakeey bimaari yaa nidaan kaa naam nahin he balki yah ek aisi sthiti kaa naam he jo ki puri tarah se maanav nirmit he
 If we talk about a common metropolitan lifestyle, we will see that in these places we find complete natural conditions and lack of both of them
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki maanav dwaara viksit kiye gaye sthanon ko purna prakritik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 For example parks etc
 jangalon, pahaado or gaanv ke maidaanon jaisi angarh jagahon ko purna prakritik kaha ja saktaa he
 This man-made situation can be characterized as a sense of isolationism that is gradually being taken away from natural ideology
 iske prabhaavon ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main bata ja saktaa he
 Firstly, the effects on our physical and mental conditions and in the second phase the effects on social and future life can be seen by linking each other

 When the speed of a chemical reaction increases with the mere presence of a substance, it is called catalysis
 jis padaarth kii upasthiti se abhikriya kii gati batch jaati he use utprerak kehete hai
 The catalyst does not participate in the reaction, only affecting the speed of action
 audyogic rup se mahatvapurn rasayanon ke nirmaan main utprerakon kii bahut badi bhoomika he, kyonki inke prayog se abhikriya kii gati batch jaati he jisase anek prakaar se aarthik laabh hota he or utpaadan tej hota he
 Therefore, a lot of money and human labor is engaged in research in the field of catalysis
 sarvapratham san 1835 main, berjilius ne kuch rasinic kriyaaon kii or dhyaan aakrisht kiya jinamein katipay bahm padaartho kii upasthiti main kriya kii gati to teevr ho jaati thi kintu bahm padaarth us kriya main koi bhaag nahin letaa tha
 For example, if the sugar is heated in the presence of acids, it is quickly converted into glucose and fructose
 is kriya main amla koi bhaag nahin letaa
 It can be reused
 berjilius ne is kriya ko "utpreran" kii sangya di tathaa un padaartho ko "utprerak" ke naam se pukaara jinaki upasthiti main kriya veg se hone lagati he
 Ostwald defined catalytic materials as: "" a catalyst is a substance that changes the velocity of a chemical reaction, but remains unchanged at the end of the action itself, so it can be reused
 
 adhikansh kriyaaon main utprerak pratikriya kii gati ko badha detaa he
 Such catalysts are called positive catalysts; But there are also catalysts which slow down the speed of chemical reaction
 aise utprerak rinatmak utprerak kehalaate hai
 The main features of catalysis are: praaia: sabhi utprerit kriyaaon ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he: samaavyavi utprerit kriyaayein ; vishmavyavo utprerit kriyaayein 
 In these actions, catalyst, repellent and byproduct are all present in the same state
 udhaahranrth, salfurik amla banane kii veshm vidhi main sulfur diaksaide, bhaap tathaa oxijan ke sanyog se salfurik amla banataa he tathaa nitric oxide dwaara yah kriya utprerit hoti he
 In this action, reagents, catalysts and byproducts remain in this gaseous state
 in kriyaaon main utprerak, pratikarmak tathaa pratifal vibhinn avasthaaon main upasthit rahete hai
 As such, ferric oxide catalyzes the combination of nitrogen and hydrogen in the Haber-method of making ammonia
 sookshm nikal kii upasthiti main vanaspatik telon kaa hydrogenikaran is prakaar kii kriyaaon kaa ek anya udhaaharan he
 Some substances do not affect the velocity of chemical action by their presence, but some affect the action of other catalysts
 inamen se un padaartho kii, jo utprerakon kii kriyasheeltaa ko badha dete hai, utprerakavardhak tathaa un padaartho ko, jo utprerakon kii kriyasheeltaa kam kar dete hai, utprerakavirohi yaa utprerak vish kehete hai
 Self-catalysts - Some reactions are also known in which a substance produced by the reaction acts as a catalyst for the reaction
 udaahranarth, ethil acetate ke jalavichedan main jo aseetic amla praapt hota he, vahi aster ke jalavichedan kii kriya ko utprerit karata he
 Although studies have been going on for a long time to understand catalysis, the final conclusion has not yet been reached in this subject
 vaigyanik isapar ekamat hai ki sabhi utprerak ek hi siddhant ke anusaar kriya nahin karte
 Two theories are used for the mechanism of catalysis - intermediate compound theory; Adsorption theory
 1
 madhyavarti yogic siddhant- yah utpreran kii vyakhya ke liye ek rasinic siddhant he
 Accordingly, the catalyst reacts with one of the first reagents to form an intermediate temporary compound; Then that intermediate temporary compound reacts with other reagents and gives the catalyst again in its precursor
 iske anusaar pratikarmakon "k" tathaa "kha" kii sangyojanakriya utprerak "ga" kii upasthiti main nimnlikhit prakaar se prakat kii jaati he: This sequence continues until the end of the verb
 madhyavarti yogic siddhant ke dwaara kuch kriyaaon ke utpreran kii vyakhya saral he
 But it is difficult or impossible to explain most heterogeneous actions and actions of catalytic inhibitors or poisons
 2
 adhishoshan siddhant- yah utpreran kii vyakhya ke liye bhautik siddhant he
 According to this theory, reagents condense at the bottom of the catalyst
 is prakaar utprerak tal par pratikarmakon kii sandratha bad jane se maatra-anupaati-niyam ke anusaar kriya kaa veg bad jaataa he
 Now a new theory has been formulated by combining both the above principles
 iske anusaar utprerak padaarth ke tal par kuch sakriy centre hote hai
 These centers have the ability to adsorb molecules or atoms
 at: dhaatu ke tal par pratikarmakon ke ghani bhoot hone se sadranta to badhati hi he, jiske kaaran kriyaveg main vruddhi hoti he, saath hi in sakriy kendron par pratikarmak inke saath asthaayee yogic bhi bana lete hai, jo madhyavarti yogic siddhant ke anusaar utpreran kaa kaary karte hai
 Fertilizers are complex organic materials that are derived from plants or animals
 ye adhikansh pratikriyaaon main atyutm utprerak siddh hue hai
 Enzymes act as catalysts in almost all the activities that occur in tree plants
 iske atirikt hamaare sharir main honevaali kriyaaon, visheshta bhojan ke pachan main bhi prakinv utprerak kaa kaam karte hai
 or ek or audyogic tathaa rasinic kriyakshetra main utprerak bahut hi upyogi siddh hue hai
 The stabilization of nitrogen is a simple example of catalytic action
 ped paudhon ke liye sthaayee nitrogen kii uplabdhi nitrate yaa ammonia ke rup main hoti he
 Both these forms of nitrogen are produced with the help of catalysts
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke samay lagbhag samast vishwa main motor aadi vaahanon ko chalaane main jo idhan kaam main laayaa jaataa tha vah sab utprerakon kii sahaayta se hi taiyaar kiya jaataa tha

 In each war, the states that fight against each other are called "warring" states
 jo rajya kisi ore se nahin ladate athwa yuddh main koi bhaag nahin lete, ve tatasth rajya kahe jate hai
 Thus neutrality is the feeling of being neutral or neutral, which the third states not involved in the war hold towards the warring states and the warring states give their recognition to this sentiment
 nishpakshta athwa tatasthta kaa yah bhav tatasth rajyon or yuddhrat rajyon ke bich kuch kartavyon or kuch adhikaron kii sristi karata he
 Neutrality was not practiced in the ancient era
 un dinon yadi koi yuddh chhidata tha to yuddhrat donon rajyon ke atirikt anya tisare rajyon ko is baat kaa chunaav karnaa padataa tha ki ve in do main se kis paksh main sammilit hon
 They used to become friends of one and sutru of the other
 madhyakaalin yug main koi bhi rajya is prakaar kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa tha ki vah yuddhrat do pakshon main se kisi ek hi paksh kii sahaayta kar saktaa tha
 Neutrality gained place as an institution in international legislation in the 17th century, although it was still in its infancy and needed a long period of time to achieve its present form
 18veen shatabdi main pahunchakar hi saidhantik evam vyaavhaarik, donon roopon main yah baat maanya ho saki ki tatasth rajyon kaa yah kartavya he ki ve tatasth yaa nishpaksh rahen or yuddhrat rajyon kaa yah kartavya he ki ve tatasth rajyon ke adhikarashetra kaa sanman karen
 The First World War started in 1914
 us samay kai rajyon ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki ve tatasth rahengen
 The United States was among the states to make such a declaration
 parantu oktober, 1916 main america bhi yuddh main sammilit ho gaya
 At the end of the war the League of Nations ended the traditional law of neutrality
 ukt anubandh kii dhara 10 ke anusaar rashtrasang ke sadasyon ne sabhi sadsy rajyon kii kshetreey athwa pradeshik akhandta or raajnneetik swatantraaa kaa aadar karnaa sweekaar kiya
 When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, the traditional rule of neutrality was temporarily revived
 sanyukt rajya america tathaa kai anya deshon ne pun: aisi ghoshnaa kii ki ve is yuddh main tatasth rahenge
 Germany violated the neutrality of most of these states
 apane tatasthtakaal main bhi america ne udharpatta kanoon banaakar mitra shaktiyon ko is bahaane sahaayta pradaan kii ki in deshon kii suraksha swayan america kii suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 The question has been disputed as to whether such conduct was appropriate in the days when America was predominantly neutral? dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti ke uparaant san 1945 main jab sanyukt rashtrasang kaa adhikaarptr sweekrut hua to usne vaidhanik rup main tatasthta kaa ant kar diya
 There is no system of separate statutory existence of such states in that charter
 uske anusaar koi bhi rajya aise kisi yuddh main swechhaya tatasth nahin rah saktaa jiske sambandh main suraksha parishad ne kisi vishesh rajya ko shanti bhang karne kaa athwa agrakraman karne kaa apradhi paaya he or jiske liye sanyukt rashtrasang ne apane sadsy rashtron kaa aavahan kiya he ki ve ukt rajya ke viruddh sainik karwai karen
 Perpetual Neutrality - Perpetual or perpetual neutrality is the neutrality of states which are accepted by special treaties such as the neutrality of Switzerland
 swechhaprerit or paramparaagat tatasthta - yadi koi rajya swechha se tatasth rahata he or kisi sandhi dwaara apane ko tatasth nahin banaata, to uski tatasthta swechhaprerit tatasthta he
 On the other hand, if a state makes such a treaty that it will remain neutral when war breaks out, then its neutrality will be called traditional or practical neutrality
 sashastr tatasthta- yadi koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth ke adhikarashetra kaa upyog karne kaa praytn karata he or vah tatasth rajya apni tatasthta kii raksha ke liye sainik kaarywahi karata he to aisi tatasthta kii raksha ke liye sainik karwai karata he to aisi tatasthta "sashastr tatasthta" kahi jaaygi
 The neutrality of Belgium, Holland and Switzerland at the time of World War II likewise armed neutrality
 kaaran, us samay ye rajya apni senaaon ko yuddh ke liye satat prastut rakhte the
 Total and Constitutional Neutrality - Neutrality of a state that is supposed to be "sovereign neutrality" remains neutral, but directly or indirectly provides some kind of assistance to one of the two warring parties
 duusari or, un rajyon kii tatasthta "sampurna tatasthta" maani jaaygi jo kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko kisi bhi prakaar kii koi sahaayta pradaan nahin karte
 1
 To have a sense of fairness against the warring states
 2
 tatasth rajya ke vyapaariyon dwaara nakebandi or varjit maal ke avaagaman sambandhi niyamon ko bhang karne par koi yuddhrat rajya unhen dand dene ke apane adhikaar kaa prayog kare to usamen apni sammati pradaan karnaa
 1
 To treat the coastal states in accordance with the sense of fairness
 2 shatrurajya ke prati tatasth rajyon ke vyapaar-vaanijya sambandhi athwa anya jo sambandh hon, unhe na dabaanaa
 If a warring state tries to break the neutrality of a neutral state, then that neutral state can always take up arms for its defense and its use of this force will not be considered an act of enmity
 kisi bhi tatasth rajya ko, apane pradesh ke bheetar se hokar kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko apni sena, yudhsaamagree athwa anya rasad aadi nikaal le jane kii, anumati nahin deni chahie
 But he can allow the warships of the warring states from his coastal region to pass through there
 in yupoton ko vahaan se hokar nikal jane de saktaa he
 He does not need to boycott these warships from their ports
 kintu is prakaar tatasth rajyon se hokar nikalate samay yuddhrat rajya ke yupoton ko aisa koi shatru kaary nahin karnaa chahie jisase shatru rajya ke yuddh poton ko koi haani pahunche
 Warring states should not take aggressive action against the enemy state by making the coast of neutral states or their own ports
 yuddhrat rajya ke sainik tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra se hokar nikal jane kii cheshtaa karen to unhe balpurvak peeche hataa dena chahie
 If they are able to enter the jurisdiction of the neutral state, then the neutral state should keep their weapons under house arrest
 jahaan tak yudhbandiyon kaa prashn he, kisi bhi tatasth rajya main pravesh karte hi, apane vahaan pravesh karne ke kaaran hi ve mukt jo jate hai
 But it is the duty of the neutral state not to allow them to go to their army and work again
 tatasthta ke ulanghan antarrashtriya aparaadh maane jate hai, phir iske niyamon kaa ulanghan chaahe koi tatasth rajya kisi yuddhrat rajya ke viruddh kare, chaahe koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya ke viruddh kare
 These violations should be immediately remedied
 jis paksh par atyaachaar kiya gaya ho, vah atyaachaari paksh se kshatipurti kii maang kar saktaa he
 The aggrieved state can also wage war against the tyrannical state
 tatasth rajya kii sampatti par balaat adhikaar kar lene ke sambandh main jo kanoon he, uske aaj ke prachlit arth ke anusaar, kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko akraman athwa suraksha ke liye aavashyak hone par tatasth rajya kii sampatti kaa upyog karne athwa use nasht kar dene kaa adhikaar praapt he
 This right can also be exercised within the jurisdiction of a neutral state, can also be exercised under enemy territory and within the open sea
 yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya ko koi seva karne ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa, yon swechha se vah koi seva kar de to duusari baat he
 If the warring state uses the neutral state's property or destroys it, the warring state must compensate it
 nal or damyanti kii katha bharat ke mahakavy, mahabharat main aati he
 Yudhishthira lost his everything in gambling and had to exile with his brothers
 vahiin ek rishi ne unhen nal or damyanti kii katha sunaayi
 Nal Nishad was the king of the country
 ve virasen ke putr the
 Nal was very brave and beautiful
 shastr-vidya tathaa ashv-sanchaalan main ve nipun the
 Damayanti was the only daughter of the King of Vidarbha
 vah bhi bahut sundar or gunwan thi
 Nal began to love her after listening to her beauty
 unke prem kaa sandesh damyanti ke paas badi kushalta se pahunchaaya ek hans ne
 And Damayanti also started burning in the face of her unknown lover
 is katha main prem or pidaa kaa aisa prabhaavshaalee put he ki bharat ke hi nahin desh-videsh ke lekhak va kavi bhi isse aakarshith hue bina na rah sake
 By translating Bop into Latin and into English poetry by Dean Milman, the West has also been well acquainted with this tale
 vidarbha desh main bhismak naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 His daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 At the same time, Nishal's son Nils ruled in Nishad country
 ve bade hi gunavan, satyawadee tathaa brahman bhakt the
 Those who came from the country of Nishad to Vidarbha praised the qualities of Maharaj Nal
 yah prashansa damyanti ke kaanon tak bhi pahaunchi thi
 Similarly, people coming from Vidarbha country would discuss the form and qualities of princess in front of Maharaj Nal
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki nal or damyanti ek-duusare ke prati aakrisht hote gayi
 In the Mahabharata, on the insistence of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, Maharishi Brihadeva told the story of nal-damayanti
 dharmraj ! nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal naam ke ek raja ho chuke hai
 He was very talented, supremely beautiful, truthful, Jitendriya, beloved of all, Vedas and Brahmin devotees
 unki sena bahut badi thi
 
 ve swayan astravidya main bahut nipun the
 They were brave, warrior, benevolent and irresistibly valiant too
 unhen jua khilne kaa bhi kuch-kuch shauk tha
 In those days, a king named Bhima ruled the country of Vidarbha
 ve bhi nal ke samaan hi sarvagun sampann or parakramee the
 He pleased the sage Daman and received four children from his boon — three sons and a daughter
 putron ke naam the—dam, dant, or daman
 The daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 His eyes were huge
 devataaon or yakshon main bhi waisi sundari kanya kahin dekhne main nahin aati thi
 In those days, how many people would come from Vidarbha country to Nishad country and would tell the form and quality of Damayanti in front of King Nal
 nishadh desh se vidarbha main jane vaale bhi damyanti ke saamne raja nal ke rup, gun or pavitra charitra kaa varnan karte
 Thus, mutual affection sprouted in both of their hearts
 ek din raja nal ne apane mahal ke udyaan main kuch hanson ko dekha
 They caught a goose
 hans ne kaha—‘aap mujhe chhod dijiye to ham log damyanti ke paas jaakar aapke gunon kaa aisa varnan karenge ki vah aapako avashya var legi
 'nal gave up laughing
 ve sab udakar vidarbha desh main gayi
 Damayanti was very happy to see her swans and started running towards them to catch the swans
 damyanti jis hans ko pakadaney ke liye daudti, vahi bol uthta ki ‘ari damyanti ! nishadh desh main ek nal naam kaa raja he
 She is as handsome as Ashwini Kumar
 manushyon main uske samaan sundar or koi nahin he
 It is as if idol is Cupid
 yadi tum uski patni ho jaao to tumhaara janm or rup donon safal ho jaayan
 We have seen the gods, gandharvas, humans, snakes and demons roaming around like a tap, but a beautiful man could not be seen
 jaise tum striyon main ratna ho, vaise hi nal purushon main bhushan he
 The pair of you two will be very beautiful
 ’ damyanti ne kaha—‘hans ! tum nal se bhi aisi baat kahana
 'hans returned to Nishad country and told the message of Damayanti from the tap
 damyanti hans ke munh se raja nal kii kirti sunakar unase prem karne lagi
 Her attachment grew so much that she would keep paying attention to them day and night
 sharir dhoomil or dublaa ho gaya
 She started looking down sakhiyon ne damyanti ke hriday kaa bhav tadkar vidarbharaj se nivedan kiya ki ‘aapaki putree aswasth ho gayi he
 'king Bhima thought big about his daughter
 ant main vah is nirnay par pahunche ki meri putree vivaahyogy ho gayi he, isaliye iskaa swayamvar kar dena chaiye
 He sent a invitation letter to the swayamvara to all the kings and informed them that the kings should take advantage by visiting the swayamvara of Damayanti and fulfill my desire
 desh-desh ke narpathi hathi, ghode or rathon kii dhwani se prithvi ko mukherit karte hue saj-dhajkar vidarbha desh main pahunchne lage
 Bhima made proper arrangements to welcome everyone
 devarshi naarad or parvat ke dwaara devataaon ko bhi damyanti ke swayamvar kaa samachar mil gaya
 All the Lokpal, including Indra, also left for Vidarbha country with their congregation and vehicles
 raja nal kaa chitt pehle se hi damyanti par aasakt ho chukaa tha
 He also traveled to Vidarbha country to join Damayanti's Swayamvara
 devataaon ne swarg se utarate samay dekh liya ki kaamdev ke samaan sundar nal damyanti ke swayamvar ke liye ja rahe hai
 Like the sun of the tap, the deities too were amazed by the Kanti and extraterrestrial appearance
 unhone pahichaan liya ki ye nal hai
 He parked his planes in the sky and came down and said to the tap - 'rajendra Nal! You are very Satyavrati
 aap ham logon kii sahaayta karne ke liye doot ban jaaiye
 'nal pledged and said' i will '
 phir poocha ki ‘aap log koun hai or mujhe doot banaakar koun-sa kaam lenaa chaahate hai ?’ indra ne kaha—‘humlog devtaa hai
 i am Indra and these are Agni, Varuna and Yama
 ham log damyanti ke liye yahan aaye hai
 The Gods told Nal that you should become our messenger and go to Damayanti and say that Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yamdevata want to come to you and marry you
 inamen se tum chaahe jis devtaa ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar lo
 Nal said with both hands that 'devraj'! There is only one purpose for you and me to leave
 isaliye aap mujhe doot banaakar vahaan bhejein, yah uchit nahin he
 Whoever has a desire to get a woman as a wife, how can he leave her and go to her and say such a thing? You guys please forgive me about this damyanti kaa swayamvar hua jisamen na keval dharti ke raja, balki devtaa bhi nal kaa rup dharkar aa gaye
 The swayamvara had several taps standing simultaneously
 sabhi pareshaan the ki asli nal koun hoga
 But Damayanti was not deterred at all
 usne ankhon se hi asli nal ko pahchaan liya
 All the gods also greeted him
 is tarah ankhon main jhalkate bhaavon se hi damayanti ne asli nal ko pahachaanakar apana jeevanasathi chun liya
 The newly-married couple received the blessings of the gods
 damyanti nishadh-naresh raja nal kii maharani bani
 Both started spending time happily
 damyanti pativrataaon main shiromani thi
 Pride could never touch her
 samyaanusaar damyanti ke garbh se ek putr or ek kanya kaa janm hua
 Both children were blessed with beautiful looks and qualities as per their parents
 samay sadaa ek-sa nahin rahata, dukh-sukh kaa chakra nirantar chalata hi rahata he
 Though Maharaja was a man of tap quality, godliness and virtue, but there was a flaw in him - addiction to gambling
 nal ke ek bhai kaa naam pushkar tha
 He lived separately from the tap
 usne unhen jue ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The game started
 bhagya pratikul tha
 Nal started losing, gold, silver, chariot, Rajpat all got out of hand
 maharani damyanti ne pratikul samay jaanakar apane donon bacchon ko vidarbha desh kii rajdhani kundinpur bhej diya
 Here, he lost his everything in null gambling
 unhone apane sharir ke saare vastrabhushan utaar diye
 Came out of the city wearing only a garment
 damyanti ne bhi maatr ek sari main pati kaa anusaran kiya
 One day King Nal saw some birds with gold wings
 raja nal ne sochaa, yadi inhen pakad liya jaay to inako bechakar nirvaah karne ke liye kuch dhan kamaaya ja saktaa he
 Thinking this, he opened his clothes and threw them on the birds
 pakshi vah vastra lekar ud gayi
 Now Raja Nal was left with no clothes even to cover his body
 nal apni apeksha damyanti ke dukh se adhik vyakul the
 One day both of them were hiding under the same cloth under a tree in the forest
 damyanti ko thakaavat ke kaaran neend aa gayi
 King Nal thought, Damayanti has to bear great grief because of me
 yadi main ise isi avasthaa main yaheen chhodkar chal don to yah kisi tarah apane pitaake paas pahunch jaaygi
 Considering this, he cut half of her sari with a sword, and by covering her body with it and leaving Damayanti in the same state, they left
 jab damyanti kii neend tuuti to bechaari apane ko akelaa paakar karun vilaap karne lagi
 Disturbed by hunger and thirst, she suddenly went to the dragon and the dragon swallowed it
 damyanti kii cheekh sunakar ek vyaadh ne use ajgar kaa grass hone se bachaaya
 But the hunter was evil by nature
 usne damyanti ke soundarya par mugdh hokar use apni kaam-pipaasa kaa shikaar bananaa chaha
 Damayanti said while cursing him- 'if i have never thought of any other man except my husband King Nal, then the life of this sinful hunter should be ended now
 damyanti kii baat puri hote hi vyaadh mrityu ko praapt hua
 While wandering deviously, Damayanti reached Chedinresh Subahu one day and then to her father
 antat damyanti ke satitv ke prabhaav se ek din maharaj nal ke duhkho kaa bhi ant hua
 The two were reunited and Raja Nal also regained his kingdom
 nal va damyanti ke do judwa putr namah va dalh the
