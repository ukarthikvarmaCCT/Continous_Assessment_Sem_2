 Oh my gobind! If you drink milk, then my mind will be calm or my father will be angry
 sone kii katori maine aapke aage rakhi he
 PA! Must drink i have not committed any sin

 Dad will get me out of the house
 jo kaary namdev ke pita sari umr na kar sake vah kaary namdev ne kar diya
 That innocent child was not aware of Pandito's dishonesty

 In the end the Lord came to be drawn to the devotion of the devotee
 pathar kii murti dwaara hanse
 Namdev has mentioned this in this way - ek bhakt prabhu ke hryday main bas gaya
 Lord laughed seeing Namdev
 hans kar unhone donon haath aage badhaaen or doodh pi liya
 After drinking milk, the idol became the same again
 doodh pilaakar namdev ji ghar chale gaye
 In this way the Lord gave them a darshan

 In the writing of almost every subject, except for a few serious subjects like theology, spiritualism etc
, this humor is equally echoed in quotes and utterances in the idioms of the language in the choice of themes
 jahaan aalochana kuch adhik bhedak hoti he, vahaan yah vinod vyangy main badal jaataa he-jaise shiksha, saamaajik, roodhiyon tathaa raajnneeti sambandhi lekhon main isse guleri ji kii rachanaayen kabhi gudgudakar, kabhi jhakazorkar pathak kii ruchi ko baandhe rahati hai
 The style of Guleri ji is mainly the style of conversation where he is directly related to the reader in the tone of Kisabayani
 yah saahitiyik bhashaa ke rup main khadi boli ko sanvarane kaa kaal tha
 Therefore, at the level of terminology and usage, there is some lack of coherence and refinement
 kahin ve ‘prishni’, ‘clripti’ or ‘agmighra’ jaise aprachlit sanskrit shabdon kaa prayog karte hai to kahin ‘ber’, ‘bichoda’ or ‘pand’ jaise theth lokbhasha ke shabdon kaa
 Not only the words of English, Arabic, Persian etc
, the idioms also come in full or translated form in their writing
 par bhashaa ke is mili-jule rup or baatcheet ke lahaze se unke lekhan main ek anaupchaarikta or atmiyata bhi aa gai he
 Yes Guleri ji gives lots of quotes and examples in his writing
 in uddharanon or udaahranon se aamtaur par unka kathy or adhik spasht tathaa rochak ho uthta he par kai jagah yah pathak se udhaaharan kii prishthbhumi or prasang ke gyaan kii maang bhi karata he aam pathak se pracheen bhartiya vaanmay, pashchimi sahitya, itihaas aadi ke itane gyaan kii apeksha karnaa hi galat he
 Therefore this additional 'contextualism' is definitely a hindrance in the smooth taste of his writings
 baharhaal guleri ji kii abhivyakti main kahin bhi jo bhi kamiyaan rahi hon, hindi bhashaa or shabdaawalee ke vikaas main unke sakaaratmak yogadan kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 He was using Khadi dialect in many subjects and in many contexts - perhaps more than any other contemporary scholar
 sahitya puraana-prasang itihaas, vigyaan, bhashavigyaan, puraatatva, dharm, darshan, raajnneeti, samajashaastra aadi anek vishyon kii vaahak unki bhashaa swaabhaavik rup se hi anek prayuktiyon or shaileyon ke liye gunjaaish bana rahi thi
 He is a living proof of Hindi's ability to express various subjects
 har sandarbh main unki bhashaa athmiya tathaa sajiv rahati he, bhale hi kahin-kahin vah adhik jatil yaa adhik halaki kyon na ho jaati ho
 Guleri's language and style was not merely a medium for expression of his ideas
 vah yug-sandhi par khadey ek viveki maanas kaa or us yug kii maansikta kaa bhi pramanik dastauez he
 Pointing towards this, Prof
 Namwar Singh also says, "guleri ji was not just creating a new prose or new style in Hindi but he was actually creating a new consciousness and this new prose was a creative creation of new consciousness
 Means
 ’’ His 'and modernity' is evident in his serious association with contemporary social, political and religious situations and in his thoughts and reactions to them
 unka sarokaar apane samay ke keval bhashik or saahitiyik aandolanon se hi nahin, us yug ke jivan ke har paksh se tha
 They could not live without commenting on the situation that attracted or excited their psyche
 ye tippaniyan unke sarokaaron, kushaagratha or najariye ke khulepan kii gavaahi detii hai
 In many respects, Galeri ji was so ahead of his time that his comments still make us look around and think
 ‘kheloge kudoge hoge kharaab’ kii manyata vaale yug main guleri ji khel ko shiksha kaa shashakt madhyam maanate the
 With the opposition of child marriage and support of female education, a hundred years ago, he considered co-education necessary for the healthy development of boys and girls
 ye sab aaj ham shahari janon ko itihaas ke rochak prasang lag sakate hai kintu puure desh ke sandarbh main, yahan faile ashiksha or andhvishwaas ke maahaul main guleri ji kii baaten aaj bhi sangat or vichaarneey hai
 They continue to mention the weaknesses of Indians - especially in socio-political contexts
 hamaare adhampatan kaa ek kaaran aapasi foot he-‘‘yah mahadweep ek duusare ko kaatane ko daudti hui billiyon kaa pitara he’’ jati-vyavastha bhi hamaari bahut badi kamazori he
 Guleri ji calls for abandoning the narrowness of the mind and coming to that grand field where there is no difference of social caste, no difference of mental caste and where there is caste discrimination, then the interests of working system
 chuaachhut ko ve sanathan dharm ke viruddh maanate hai
 They strongly contradict meaningless rituals and superstitions associated with astrology
 keval shastramulak dharm ko ve bahyadharm maanate hai or dharm ko karmkand se na jodakar itihaas or samajashaastra se jodate hai
 Religion means "public affection" for him, "who considers communal jealousy and malice evil"
 unke anusaar udaartaa sauhaard or maanavtawaad hi dharm ke prantatva hote hai or is tathy kii pahchaan behad zaruri he-‘‘aajkal vah udaar dharm chahie jo hindu, sikh, jain, parsi, musalmaan, kristan sabko ek bhav se chalaavai or inamen birdari kaa bhav paidaa kare, kintu sankeern dharmashiksha


 hamaari bich kii khai ko or bhi chaudee banaayenge
 ''
 dharm ko guleri ji baraabar karmkand nahin balki aachaar-vichaar, lok-kalyaan or jan-seva se jodate rahe

 On 1 January 1959, the success of the revolution led to Cuban dictator Fulgenians Batista fleeing the country, and young guerrilla warriors seizing power
 kranti kii yah prakriya apane anoothepan ke kaaran hathiyaarband tareekon se satta par kabza karne kii ek vishisht vidhi ke rup main charchit hui
 Its advocates claimed that a party of committed guerrillas could carry out the revolution and that a long-term effort to mobilize the wider public or upgrade their political consciousness was not a pre-condition
 sanyukt rajya america ne cuba main fidel kastro ke shashan ko apdasth karne kii kai koshishen kin, lekin vah naakaam rahaa
 Gradually, Cuba became the pole of opposition not only in North America, but in the whole world
 nabbe ke dashak main sari duniya main samaajawaadee khemaa dhah jane ke baavjood cuba main communist shashan aaj tak jari he
 The origins of Cuba's revolution lie in its colonial past
 laathini america ke adhiktar deshon ne 1810- 25 ke bich spani upniveshwaad se aazaadee hasil kar lee thi
 But Cuba remained a Spanish colony until 1898
 is tarah yah america mahadweep main sabase ant main azaad hone vaala desh tha
 It eventually gained independence in the second freedom struggle led by José Marti, but the freedom fighters did not occupy power
 cuba ranneetik drushti se sanyukt rajya america ke liye bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 Apart from this, America was also eyeing the sugarcane cultivation happening here
 isliye america ne yahan kii raajnneeti main khul kar dilchaspee lee or apane hit saadhane ke liye taiyaar shaskaon ko samarthan diya
 In the process, Cuba became as if one colonial ruler had been replaced by another colonial ruler
 is ghatnakram kaa parinaam yah niklaa ki cuba kaa rashtriya mukti andolan america ke prabhaav or niyantran ke viruddh sangharsh ban gaya
 The 1933 movement should be seen as the next chapter in the development of the Cuban revolution
 isane swatantraaa ke sangharsh main ek naye charan kii ore sanket kiya
 The most important thing is that this movement defined itself in the context of the organization of the working class and the socialist tradition
 is andolan ke kaaran hi kuch samay ke liye cuba main pragatisheel sarkaar bani
 But shortly thereafter, power came into the hands of Batista who again connected Cuba to American economic and political interests

 After losing the elections, Batista overthrew his dictatorship in 1952 with the help of the army

 On one side were the Artodoxes who emphasized the tradition of Marti
 duusari ore, diarectorio revolutionerio the jo 1933 main hue andolan ke netaa aantonio guteras se prabhavit the
 They insisted on violent action against the oppressive state
 fidel kastro bhi isi vichaar se prabhavit the, lekin un par maarti ke jujharu vyaktitv kaa bhi kaaphi prabhaav tha
 In the period after 1933, the Communist Party of Cuba, which was founded in 1925, changed its working schedule under the influence of the Soviet Union
 1935 ke baad vah batista ke saath sahyog karne lagi
 Therefore, youths like Fidel Castro, who believed in revolutionary nationalism, looked at communists with skepticism
 duusari ore communiston ne bhi radical rashtravaadiyon kii is aadhaar par aalochana kii ki ve varg aadhaarit vishleshan ke bajaay rashtrawaad ke naam par logon ko sangathit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 After 1952, the race for leadership between the Directorio and Castro started to lead the revolution which continued even further
 lekin in donon main samanta yah thi ki ye donon hi 1933 ke sangharshon ko apni buniyaad maanate the
 On 26 July 1953, youths from the Artodoxo group attacked the army
 is samooh main fidel kastro bhi shaamil the
 This attack was very impressive and many soldiers of Batista's army were killed in it
 lekin iske parinamswaroop kastro or baaki vidrohiyon ko girakrataar bhi hona padaa
 Batista tortured many of the captured rebels and many were sentenced to death
 khud kastro par bhi mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or unhen 15 saal kii sajaa di gayi
 The arguments by Castro in his defense during the trial have historical significance
 unhone desh main faile bhrashtachar par hamalaa kiya or 1940 ke udaarataavaadi samvidhan ko phir se lagu karne par bal diya
 Castro called for programs such as leasing land to small farmers, nationalization of large foreign-owned properties and benefiting laborers in factories owned by people from other countries
 iske alaava kastro ne saarvajanik sevaaon ke rashtriyakaran, lagaan main katautee or shiksha main sudhaar par bhi bal diya
 In this way, Castro offered a picture of post-revolution Cuba
 fidel kastro or duusare baagi netaaon ke saath hue bartaav ne jan-aakrosh ko bhi badhaayaa
 Castro was released from prison in July 1955 using the Amnesty Law due to protests against it
 kastro iske chah hakrate baad desh chhod kar mexico chale gayi lekin unhone vaayada kiya ve apane sangharsh ko aage badhaane ke liye waapas aayenge
 Even after Castro went abroad, the organization formed by him remained active, known as the 26 July Movement
 kastro kaa lakshya bilkul spasht tha
 They wanted to create an army of new armed rebels
 unhen bharosa tha ki krantikariyon kii karrwai se jan-vidroh paidaa hoga
 It was with this attitude that Fidel Castro tried to prepare his armed guerrilla squad in Mexico
 iske alaava ve raajnneetik gathjod banane kii koshish bhi karte rahe
 It was here that he met Ernesto Che Guevara, a young dentist
 donon hi gorilla yuddh dwaara kranti karne kii sankalpana par sahamat the
 Both were trained by Alberto Bio, a senior Spanish war warrior at a farm in Chalco in Mexico
 kastro or che ne disambar, 1956 main motor vises grenma se 82 gorilla ladaakon ke saath cuba waapas aane kii yojana banaayi
 But when he reached the coast of Cuba on 3 December 1956, he encountered Batista's troops
 unki madad ke liye je-26-em ke shahari ilaakon ke sadsy aaye the, lekin ve intazaar karke chale gayi kyonki kastro ke chhapamar nishchit taarikh ke bajaay kaafii der se pahunche the
 Most guerrilla fighters were killed in an attack by Batista's troops
 lekin fidel, che or fidel ke chote bhai raul kastro is hamale main batch gayi
 After about 15 days, these people met each other in the forests of Sierra Mestra in an injured state
 unhone shahar main je-26-em se sampark kaayam kiya or jangalon main hi gorilla ladaakon ko ikattha karnaa shuru kar diya
 But it was very difficult to make the poor farmers trained revolutionary here
 kisaan kabhi bhi kranti kaa kaam chhod kar kheti karne ke liye waapas jane ko taiyaar rahete the
 Or the opposing camp could draw them in their favor by luring them with money etc
 che guyavara ke liye yah zyaada chintaa kii baat thi
 Therefore, he emphasized strict discipline and strict punishment to those who break the discipline
 duusari taraf ek samasya yah bhi thi ki cuba main kaam karne vaale duusare krantikari sanghathan, masalan diarectorio or 26 july movement, kaa shahari netritv kastro or che kii gorilla yojanaon se puri tarah sahamat nahin tha
 He was also a critic of the Cuban Communist Party
 khud che or fidel ke bich bhi communist lakshyon ko lekar matbhed tha
 Che's greater emphasis was on Marxism, while Cuban nationalism had a strong influence on Castro
 baharhaal, dhire-dhire je-26-em par kastro keme kaa prabhaav ho gaya or is dal ke shahari keme ke netaa frank paayas kii 30 july, 1957 ko hatya kar di gayi
 In April 1958, Castro issued a full war manifesto on behalf of his team
 isamen unhone logon se april, 1958 main aam hadtaal karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 Although this strike was not very successful, it further increased the protest against Batista
 iske kaaran kastro anya samoohon se adhik najdiki sahyog kaayam karne ke liye prerit hue
 On 20 July, he issued a unity declaration
 is par dayrecterio or je-em-26 sahit aath sanghathanon ne apane hastakshar kiye
 But the Communist Party of Cuba did not join it
 baharhaal, yah ghoshnaa-patr batista ke virodhiyon ke ekajute hone kaa bhi pramaan tha
 It presented a complete plan to uphold democratic and constitutional rights
 yah ghoshnaa-patr ek tarah se is baat kaa bhi pramaan tha ki baaki vidrohi samooh bhi fidel kastro ke netritv ko sweekaar karne lage the
 Gradually, Batista's hold on power also weakened
 navambar main vaidhata hasil karne ke liye batista shashan ne dikhaave ke liye chunaav karaaye
 These elections were rigged extensively, so its results gained no legitimacy
 batista or vidrohi samoohon ke bich badhata takaraav disambar main charam par pahunch gaya
 In December 1958, Castro's ally, Che, defeated 350 thousand guerrillas in the city of Santa Kalra after a three-day battle with four thousand guards of Batista
 isamen che ne ranneetik kushalta kaa parichay dete hue us train ko shahar main aane se roak diya jisamen rakshak dal ke liye hathiyaar aa rahe the
 The government army lost
 iske teen din baad 31 disambar, 1958 ko batista desh chhodkar bhaag gaya
 The Cuban revolution has an important place in the history of the twentieth century
 isane yah dikhaaya ki kis tarah yuva ladaake gorilla chhapamar yuddh ke dwaara satta main badlaav kar sakate hai
 The revolutionaries succeeded despite opposition from the US
 america ne kranti ke baad kaafii koshishen kin lekin vah cuba main fidel ke shashan or prabhaav ko khatm nahin kar paaya
 Usually Fidel, Che and their team 26-M July's contribution to the Cuban revolution are emphasized
 lekin cuba ke bheetar ke duusare samoohon, udhaaharan ke liye, diarectorio ne bhi isamen mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Fidel Castro and his party wanted to achieve progressive socialist goals through revolutionary nationalism
 lekin is kranti or iske baad saamne aayi vyavastha main loktantric swatantraaaon or mulyon ko koi tarjeeh nahin di gayi
 Che Guevara later tried to implement the model of the Cuban Revolution elsewhere, but he failed
