 This meant that the British were squeezing the Indian economy by constantly imposing exports to their advantage and charging unnecessary surcharges
 ramesh chandra dutt kaa janm 1848 main kolkata ke ek aise parivaar main hua tha jisane east india company ke tahat vyapaar karke kaaphi sampatti arjeet kii thi
 This ICS in 1868 Went to England to take the examination of and passed third place in this examination in 1869
 san 1871 main ye bharat waapas aae
 He wrote a book 'three Years in England' about his stay in England for these three years
 bharat aane ke baad inhone anek prashasnic padon kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaala tathaa urisa ke kamishnar evam polytical agent, baroda ke dewan or royal kamishan ke sadsy rahe
 In 1882, Ramesh Chandra Dutt continued to oversee administrative work in various districts of Bengal
 1883 main jila magistrate banane ke baad 1894 main bardhaman jile ke dipti kamishnar niyukt kiye gayi
 He was the first Indian to reach such a high position in the nineteenth century
 1897 main unhone isies se avkaash grahan kiya or 1904 tak kii avadhi europe main guzari
 He was also Professor of History at University College, London
 1899 main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke lakhanu adhiveshan ne unhen apana adhyaksh nirvaachit kiya
 From 1897 to 1904, he was Professor of Indian History at the University of London
 unka nidhan 1909 main hua
 Through his deep research and analysis, Dutt showed that the British rule not only failed to improve the physical condition of India, but also during its period India was de-industrialized
 british aarthik niti ke parinamswaroop bharat ke dastakaari utpaadan main jabardast giravat aayi or uski bharpai ke rup main audyogic utpaadan main badhotaree nahin hui
 Nor was Indian industry given any kind of protection
 nattejey ke taur par bhartiya arthvyavastha pehle se kahin zyaada kheti par nirbhar hone ke liye majaboor ho gayi
 Indian society continued to become rustic
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki british upniveshwaad ke kathith rachanaatmak kadamon se bhi bharat ko laabh nahin hua
 Due to rail transport started by the British, traditional transport services were killed and trains were used to carry goods made in British factories
 dutt kaa nishkarsh tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha aviksit nahin he, balki uskaa vikaas avaruddh kar diya gaya he
 The history written by him defies the Marxist notion prevalent in a section of scholars according to which the role of British colonialism is seen to be progressive
 aarthik itihaaskaar ke alaava ramesh chandra dutt ek pratibhashali or kushal saanskrithik itihaaskaar bhi the
 Along with being the founder president of Bangi Sahitya Parishad, he also briefly wrote Mahabharata and Ramayana in English
 sanskrit sahitya ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par dutt ne bharat kii pracheen sabhyataa ke itihaas kii rachana bhi kii
 Apart from highlighting the ill effects of British economic policy, Dutt's second major contribution to the development of economic ideas was that he advocated setting limits to government intervention in the economy
 yah sifaarish unhone beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main ek aise samay main kii jab anya bhartiya arthshaastri aarthik jivan main sarkaar ke hastkshep ko kam karne kii maang kar rahe the
 Dutt said that the government should avoid private initiative interventions but should be prepared to intervene under specific circumstances so as to avoid conflict of interest by avoiding temporary types of crises
 yatharth kaa akalan karne kii dutt kii paddati bhi us jamaane ke hisaab se alag tarah kii thi
 Dutt developed the concept of interdependence of economic and political facts, instead of considering one as the major and the other as his influence among the many reasons of reality
 unki manyata thi ki samaaj ke tantra main har chiz ek-duusare par nirbhar he, paraspar judi hui he isliye santulan bigaadane jaisaa koi bhi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, Dutt also understood that balance is not always the same
 vah lagaataar badalata rahata he
 Therefore, the government should focus on the underlying dynamics of the immediate situation while intervening, or else its interventionist actions may result in the opposite
 arthshaastra par dutt kii rachanaaon kaa prakaashan 1900 se shuru hua
 His first book was 'famines and Land Assessment in India', which studied the famines in India, which was also praised by Russian anarchist philosopher Prince Kropatkin
 unki is kriti se zaahir tha ki ve bhartiya kisaan kii jivan-sthitiyon main kitni dilchaspee rakhte hai or unka aarthik chintan kis tarah se uski sthiti sudhaarney par kendrit he
 Dutt questioned why the people of India had to face ten horrific famines in the span of forty years since 1858? He asked that during this time the ruler was in the hands of the Empress rather than the East India Company
 is dauraan aamtaur par shanti rahi or keval ek hi yuddh hua
 The government had trained administrators who had sufficient experience in Indian conditions
 zamin upjau thi, kisaan udhyami or kifaayatshar the
 Despite such favorable circumstances, why did it happen that during these famines, about 1
5 crore people lost their lives due to hunger? Dutt did not agree to believe that the cause of famines is due to the rapid increase in population or that the farmers of India are careless, unconcerned and cynical
 unhone yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ki kisaanon kaa soodakhor mahajanon ke shikanje main fasaa hona akaal kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Dutt showed in his study that the growth rate of population in India was not only always lower than in England, but in the ten years before his study, the population of this country had stopped increasing
 dutt ke anusaar bharat se zyaada parishramee or kam karch main guzar-basar karne vaale kisaan duniya main or kahin nahin hai
 He cited the reports of commissions investigating the causes of famine and said that it is due to the rigorous recovery of government revenue that farmers have to depend on the Mahajans
 angrez sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaate hue dutt ne pradarshit kiya ki akaal ke baavjood aisa koi saal nahin tha jab sari fasalen chaupat ho gayi hon
 Grain was always full in government warehouses
 ek praant main agar fasal karaab ho gayi ho, to duusare praant main fasal acchhee hui
 Farming has expanded, it has become denser, yields have also increased compared to earlier, prices of agricultural produce have also increased, but even after this the condition of farmers has continued to deteriorate
 iske liye dutt ne british nitiyon ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 In 1902, the first volume of Dutt's great treatise 'the Economic History of British India' was published
 ise british hukumat par likhe gayi sabase behtareen granth kii sangya di jaati he
 In this, economic history was introduced from the establishment of British power in 1757 till the emperor's rule was implemented
 isamen east india company ke tahat apanaayi gayi kheti or bhoomi bandobast sambandhi nitiyon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa utpaadan sambandhi nitiyon ke saath-saath vitt or prashasan sambandhi nitiyon kaa vishleshnatmak vivaran tha
 British reviewers of the book also considered its impartiality and depth iron
 1904 main is mahagranth kaa doosraa khand prakashit hua
 He claimed on the basis of authentic facts that selfish policies adopted in the early years of British rule have been responsible for the decline of Indian industries
 dutt ne bharat main garibi ke kaarnon par prakaash daalate hue sabit kiya ki angrezon kii niti ke kaaran deshi udyog or hastkalaon ko tabah ho janaa padaa
 Millions of people became unemployed, leaving no other option but to live for them
 is tarah kheti ke bharose jivit rahane waalon kii sankhya had se zyaada bad gayi or sabhi ke rahan-sahan kaa str gir gaya
 Along with this, the British continued to spend huge money to rule India, which did not benefit the country
 rajkoshiya niti or bhu-rajasav pranali kuch is tarah kii banaayi gayi ki kisaan ke paas sirf zindaa bache rahane laayak sansaadhan hi rah gayi
 Dutt also had a prescription for curing these problems
 unhone sifaarish kii ki bhartiya mil udyog se utpaadan shulk hataa liya jaae, nichi daron ke naram lagaan ke alaava baaki sabhi taxon se kisaanon ko chhutkaaraa diya jaae, england main hone vaali faujee or shahi karch bharat se nahin vasule jane chahie or bharat main bhi faujee karch ghataaye jane chahie
 As soon as Dutt made these suggestions, the British government and its supporters started criticizing them all-round
 unke tathyon or vishleshan ko kaarij karne kii koshish kii gayi
 It should be noted that Dutt was a senior officer of Indian Civil Services and was bound by the responsibility of serving British rule
 lekin, apni baat par jame rah kar unhone apane virodhiyon ke saath bahes kii or sarkaar se lagaataar anurodh kiya ki vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar ke liye nitiyaan badale
 His unique talent was not limited only to administrative work, but he was also an original writer and historian

 Parliamentary law is the set of all rules of parliamentary procedure that are generally considered necessary for the legislative system to operate smoothly
 yadhyapi deshkal ke anuroop aise niyam kuch vishyon main alag alag ho sakate hai kintu sansadeey vidhi kaa mul strot englad kii sansad ke ve niyam he jinke anusaar vidhinirmaan, karypalika par niyantran tathaa aarthik vishyon ke niyaman hetu aisi prakriyaayein banaai jaati he jinase in vishyon par sadan kaa mat gyaat hota he
 Therefore, the first session of Parliament calls for a President or Governor
 satr aarambhn ke pashchaat sadan kaa kaarysanchalan sadan kaa adhyaksh karata he
 The Speaker makes the vote of the House on various subjects from different types of questions, proposals and results of counting on them
 at: prastaavon tathaa sambandhit prashnon or samuchit rup se vichaar karne ke liye ek kaarysoochee banaai jaati he jiske anusaar prastaavak athwa prashnkarta ke liye samay niyat kiya jaataa he
 The main objective of the questions is to control the executive government
 karypalika ke anuchit krityon athwa anya trutiyon par prashnottar ke samay adhyaksh apni vyavasthaayen detaa he
 At such times only the use of parliamentary language is required
 koi aisa prashn nahin uthaaya ja saktaa jo nyaayalay ke vichaaradhin ho athwa kisi kaaran se adhyaksh usko aavashyak nahin samajhataa
 There are three types of questions in general
 pratham, alpasuchit prashn jinke saarvajanik mahatv ke hone ke kaaran unka uttar adhyaksh kii vyavasthanusaar turant hi sambandhit mantri ko dena chahie
 If this is not possible, the Speaker can arrange for the Minister to give some more time
 dwitiya, tarankit prashn jinka uttar shashan kii ore se maukhik diya jaataa he
 Third, written answers are given to unstarred questions
 uttar aparyaapt hone kii dasha main adhyaksh anupoorak prashnon kii anumati bhi de saktaa he
 The vote of the House is also known from the motion and the counting of votes thereon
 mukhya rup se prastaav do prakaar ke hote hai
 First main proposal, second secondary proposal
 gaun prastaav uchit rup se suchit evam adhyaksh kii anugna se upasthit kiye gaye mukhya prastaav par vivaad ke samay rakhe jate hai, jaise kaary sthagit karne ke liye prastaav
 This proposal leads one to consider any other important subject except the main proposal
 vivadant prastaav kaa uddeshy kisi prashn par anaavashyak vivaad ko samaapt karnaa hota he
 On the passing of this resolution, the question is immediately put before the House for counting
 mukhya prastaav ke sanshodhan athwa usapar vichaar karne hetu nirdhaarit samay ko badhaane hetu bhi gaun prastaav prastut kiye ja sakate hai
 An important type of motion is a motion of no confidence against the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House or any Minister or Cabinet
 is prastaav ke uchit rup se suchit karne ke pashchaat usapar vichaar kikaya jaataa he
 The counting of votes is done after considering the proposals as per rules
 matdaan kaa koi rup prayukt kiya ja saktaa he, jaise haath uthavakar, prastaav ke paksh evam vipaksh ke sadasyon ko alag alag khadaa karke, ek ek se baat karke athwa gupt matdaan peti main matdaan karvaa kar
 If deemed necessary, the subject may be referred to the Select or other committees for full consideration after the first and second reading but before the third reading
 sadan kaa kaary sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye sadan ko sanyukt rup se tathaa prayek sadsy ko vyaktigat rup se paramparatargat kuch visheshadhikaar praapt he
 For example, the House has the absolute right to have unrestricted right to speech, to publish or not to publish the details of the proceedings of the House, to remove strangers, to make the House its structure and process
 iske atirikt koi bhi sadsy satr aarambhn ke chalis din pehle evam satrant ke chalis din pashchaat tak bandi nahin banaaya ja saktaa, yadi uske upar koi aparaadh karne, nivarak najarbandi yaa nyaayalay athwa sadan ke avamaan kaa aarope na ho
 If a member or someone else has disregarded the above privileges, then it becomes a question of contempt of the House and instead the House has the absolute right to punish the person or the person who has been oppressed on the decision of the Committee of Privileges

 sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he
 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access
 ab lagbhag har santhaan main apatpi sarwar hone se, yah vyavastha kaam main nahin aati he
 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers
 isse dur-daraaj se aane vaali sanchikaon par local filon jaisaa hi kaary ho saktaa he
 FTP URL is used in this
 sanchika bhejne ke anya tareeke jaise esaftipi or esasipi apatpi se nahin jude hote
 SSH is used throughout their process
 file transfar protocol yaa apatpi apane vartmaan rup main vibhinn charnon se hota hua pahunchaa he
 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 Nadir Shah Afshar was the Shah of Persia and he established Iranian sovereignty over the region after centuries
 usne apana jivan daastaa se aarambh kiya tha or faras kaa shah hi nahin bana balki usne us samay irani samrajya ke sabal shatru osmani samrajya or roosi samrajya ko irani kshetron se baahar nikaala
 He established the Afshari dynasty and its rise came at a time when the Osmani Empire was under attack from the west in Iran and the Afghans had conquered the Safawi capital Isfahan from the east
 uttar se rus bhi faras main samrajya vistaar kii yojana bana rahaa tha
 Even under this circumstance he organized his army and due to his military campaigns he is awarded titles such as Napoleon of Persia or the last great general of Asia
 wo bharat vijay ke abhiyaan par bhi niklaa tha
 After defeating the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah Alam, who was in power in Delhi, he gained immense wealth from there, including the Kohinoor diamond
 iske baad wo apaar shaktishaalee ban gaya or uskaa swasthya bhi bigadataa gaya
 In the latter part of his life he became very tyrannical
 san 1747 main uski hatya ke baad uskaa samrajya jald hi teetar-bitar ho gaya
 Nadir was born into an ordinary family in the Afshar Qalbus clan in Khorasan
 uske pita ek saadhaaran kisaan the jinaki mrityu nadir ke balykaal main hi ho gai thi
 It is said of Nadir that his mother was enslaved by the Uzbeks with him
 par nadir bhaag sakane main safal rahaa or wo ek afshaar kabeeley main shaamil ho gaya or kuch hi dinon main uske ek tabake kaa pramukh ban baitha
 He soon emerged as a successful soldier and married two daughters of Baba Ali Baig, a local headman
 nadir ek lambaa, sajila or shokh kaali aankhon vaala noujvaan tha
 He was ruthless towards his enemies but generous towards his servants and soldiers
 use ghudsawaari bahut pasand thi or ghodon kaa bahut shauk tha
 His voice was very serious and it is also considered one of the many reasons for his success
 vah ek turkmen tha or uske kabeeley ne shah ismail pratham ke samay se hi safaviyon kii bahut madad kii thi
 At that time, the throne of Persia was ruled by the Safavis
 lekin nadir shah kaa bhavishya shah ke takhtapalat ke kaaran nahin bana jo ki praayah kai safal senanayakon ke saath hota he
 He supported the Safavis
 us samay saafavi apane patanonmukh samrajya main nadir shah ko paakar bahut prasann hue
 On one side, the Osmani Empire, on the other hand, the Afghan revolt had plagued the Safavis
 iske alaava uttar se roosi samrajya bhi nigahen gadaaye baitha tha
 Shah Sultan Hussain's son Tahmasya joined Nadir
 uske saath milakar usne uttari iran main mashhad se afgaanon ko bhagaakar apane adhikaar main le liya
 With this service was honored with received the title of Thamasya Quli Khan
 yah ek sammaan tha kyonki isse use shahi naam mila tha
 But Nadir was not a commander to be so satisfied
 nadir ne iske baad heraat ke abdali afagaanon ko parrast kiya
 After consolidating his position in the court of Tehmashp, he planned to attack the Afghans who had captured the capital Isfahan in 1729
 is samay ek unani vyapaaree or paryatak besile vatatzes ne nadir ke sainya abhyaason ko aankhon se dekha tha
 He made a note - Nadir bowed his head in acceptance of his generals' greetings after entering the practice area
 uske baad wo apana ghoda roktaa tha or kuch der tak sena kaa nirikshan ekadam chup rahakar karata tha
 He allowed the practice to begin
 iske baad abhyaas aarambh hota tha - chakra, vyuh rachana or ghudsawaari ityadi

 nadir khud teen ghante tak ghode par abhyaas karata tha
 By the end of 1729, he defeated the Afghans three times and took Isfahan back under his control
 usne afagaanon ko mahafooj tareeke se bhaagane de diya
 He then planned a massive military campaign
 jiske liye usne shah tahmaashp ko kar vasuulne par majaboor kiya
 Usmani Turks dominated from the west
 abhi tak nadir ke abhiyaan uttari, kendriya tathaa purvi iran or usase sate afghanistan tak simit rahe the
 He drove the Osmanis from the west and soon after that he moved east towards Herat where he took control of Herat
 uski sainya safalataa tahmaashp se dekhi nahin gai
 He feared a coup
 usne apni sainya yogyata sabit karne ke makasad se osmanon ke saath phir se yuddh shuru kar diya jiskaa ant uske liye sharmnaak rahaa or use nadir dwaara jite hue kuch pradesh osmanon ko lautaane pade

 Nadir also had a moderate religious relationship with the Armenians
 uskaa shashan yahudiyon ko liye bhi ek sukun kaa samay tha
 Within his empire, he made no attempt to inflict Sunni religion on the people, but outside the empire he became known as the Shah of the Sunni converted kingdom

 This gave him a clue that Raza is also plotting against him
 isi dar se usne raza ko vysarai se padchyut kar diya
 He then went on an expedition to Turkestan and then went on to suppress the rebellion of Dagestan
 par yahan par use safalataa nahin mili
 The Lezgo adopted the Khandak war policy and attacked Rashad's caravan and disturbed Nadir
 jab wo dagestan main tha to nadir ko khabar mili ki raza usko maarane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 This angered him and he blinded Raza
 raza ne kaha ki wo nirdosh he par nadir ne uski ek na suni
 But a few days later Nadir regrets his mistake

 After he returned empty-handed from Dagestan, he regrouped his army for a much older goal - the Osmanian Empire of the West
 us samay jab sena sangathit hui to uski ginati thi - 3,75,000 sainik
 Hardly any army had such an empire at that time

 Ali Quli declared himself Shah after he died
 usne apana naam adil shah rakh liya
 After Nadir died, the army dispersed and the empire began to rule independently by satraps
 europea prabhaav bhi badhata hi gaya
 Nadir had gained a reputation as a winner in Europe

 Flowers, or flowers, are the reproductive structures found in plants
 ye kaha jaataa he
 Along with the reproductive components of flowering plants, flowers have been appreciated and used by humans, especially to decorate their environment and as a source of food
 paraag ko protsaahit karne ke liye pratyak pushp kii apni vishesh prakaar kii sanrachana hoti he
 Killistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open
 Many types of Viola and Salvi species have these types of flowers
 keetpremi phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Generally, many parts of the flowers have a gland called pollen that attracts these insects
 kuch phulon main sanrachanaayen hote hai jinhen madhuras nirdesh kehete hai jo ki paragan karne waalon ko bataate hai ki madhu kahan dhoondhna he
 Flowers also attract pollinators with fragrance and color
 phir bhi kuch phool paragakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nakal yaa anukaran karte hai
 For example, some orchid species create flowers that match the color, shape and scent of the female bee
 phool roopon main bhi visheshgy hote hai or punkatior kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paragak par sthanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vaastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragak un sabhi phulon main paraag ko streekashar main sthanantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Vataparagit flowers use air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, Ambergia rag hay and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators because of which they do not tend to be "showy flowers"
 Male and female reproductive organs are usually found in separate flowers, male flowers have long stamens fibers that are open at the end, and female fruits have long, wing-like pistils
 jahaan ki kitprageeya phulon ke paraag bade or lasalase daanon ki pravriti liye hue rahete hai jo ki protein main dhani hote hai, vaataparagit phulon ke paraag zyaadaatar chote dane liye hue rahete hai, bahut halke or kiton ke liye itane poshak bhi nahi
 Flowers are bicellular, which create two types of holes

 sankshep main, ek phool kii sanrachana ek sanshodhit tane par ek agr maristem par hoti he, jo kii lagaataar badhate nahin rahata phool kuch tareekon se paudhe se jude rahete hai
 If the flowers are not attached to the stem and are formed at the addresses, they are called avrita
 When the flower is flowered, it is called a flowering flower
 yadi phuleey pushpan phulon ke samoohon main khatm hota he, to prayek taana jo phool ko grahan kiye rahata he use pedicel kehete hai
 The flowering stem creates an end form called a flower chair or its letter
 The flower parts are arranged in a whorl above the letter
 vorl ke chaar mukhya bhaag is prakaar hai: Although the floral structure described above may be considered an 'ideal' structural scheme, the plant species show a wide variation of variation from this scheme
 ye badlaav phool-paudhon ke vikaas main bahut myne rakhte hai or vanaspatijna iskaa gahan prayog paudhon kii nasl ke sambandhon ko sthapit karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, two subfamilies of flowering plants can be distinguished by the inflated limbs of each of their whorls: a dicotyledon whorl ideally has four or five limbs, and monocotellidons have coefficients of three or three
 ek samuhik strikesar main keval do carpel ho sakate hai, yaa phir upar die gaye monocot or dikot ke samanyikaran se sambandhit na hon
 Most breeds of individual flowers, as described above, have both jayang and stamens
 vanaspatijna in phulon kaa varnan purna, ubhaylangeey, harmafrodit ke rup main karte hai
 Yet in some plant breeds, the flowers are incomplete or unisexual: holding only stamens or pistil organs
 In the first case if a particular plant which is either female or male is considered a diocesius 
 lekin agar ek lingeey purush yaa maadaa phool ek hi paudhe par dikhte hai to aise nasl ko monoisius kaha jaataa he
 Additional discussion on the change of flowers from the original plan is mentioned in the articles containing the original parts of the flowers

 In many flowers, the element is coincident, if the outer part is divisible at any point from the central peak, two matching halves are created - they are called fixed or homogeneous
 udaa gulab yaa treelium

 a flower formula is a way that the structure of a flower is represented by a special letter, number, or symbol
 bajaay ek vishesh prajati ke, ek saamaanya formule kaa istemaal ek paudhe ke parivaar ke phuleey sanrachana ko ingit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The following representations are used
 Ca = bahyadalpunj Ca5 = dalpunj = pankhudiyaan kuch teen ke gunank main)or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; z yadi jode jaigomorfic a = punkesar g = jayang x: representing "variable number" ∞: representing many pushp sutara kuch is prakaar se dikhaai degaa: Many additional symbols are used phool kaa praathmik uddeshy prajnan he phool prajnan ang hote hai jo ki shukranuon ko paraag se bijand / andkosh se jodne main madhyastata karte hai, saamaanya rup se ek paudhe se dusre ko, par kai paudhe swayan ke phulon ko paraagit kar sakate hai
 Fertile farms produce seeds which are further ancestral

 Flowers are also pleasing to pollinators for smell and some smells for our smelling power
 sabhi phulon ki gandh manushyon ko apil nahin karatin, kai phool aise kiton se paraagit hote hai jo ki sade maance se aakarshith hote hai or phool jo ki mrit pashu ki tarah gandh maarthe hai, jinhen aksar carrian phool kaha jaataa hai jisame reflasia, titaneram or uttari america kaa paupu shaamil hai
 Flowers that are pollinated by night visitors are likely to concentrate on their smell to attract pollinators
 Such flowers are mostly white
 phir bhi dusre phool paraganon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nakal kaa istemaal karte hai udahaaran ke liye kuch orchid kii kuch prajatiyon ke phool madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khooshbu se mail khate he
 Male bees roam from one flower to another in search of a partner
 paudhe dwaara paraagan kii vyavastha is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kis tarah se paraagan ko istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Most flowers can be broadly divided into two groups depending on their mode of pollination
 kitparageeya: phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Mostly they specialize in shapes / forms and the stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollination when it lands on its attractor
 To get it, the pollinator transfers the pollen to the stigma in all the flowers that are arranged in exactly the same way 
 kai phool paraagan ke liye maatr phulon ke hisson ke bich nikatataa par nirbhar / bharosa karte hai
 Others, such as Saracenia or female sleeper orchids, have a fixed structure that prevents pollination by antagonizing self-esteem
 vaataparagit phool: vaayu kaa istemaal paraag ko ek phool se agle phool tak le jane main karte hai udhaaharan ke liye ghaasein, santi vriksh, emborsia jati kii raig ghans or esar jati ke ped or jhaadiyaan

 madhumakhi or bombal makkhi sakriy rup se vaataparagit paraag corn jo jamaa karte hai haalaanki ye unke zyada mahatva ke nahin hote
 Some flowers are self-pollinated and use flowers that never bloom, or are self-pollinated before the flowers bloom, these flowers are called cleistogamous
 Many Viola and Salvia species have these types of flowers
 bahut se phulon main ek yaa kuch vishisht prakaar ke jeevanuon se nikat sambandh hote hai
 For example, many flowers attract only one insect from a specific insect species, so depend on that insect for successful breeding

 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard rebound ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 ambedkar kaa granth likhane kaa uddeshy: The urge to write this book has a different origin
 1951 main kalakatta kii mahabodhi sosayadi ke jarnal ke sampadak ne mujhase poocha baishakh sankhya ke liye ek lekh likhane ke liye
 In that article, i argued that the religion of Buddha is the religion that a social science could have awakened, and without which it would perish
 maine yah bhi bataaya he ki aadhunik duniya ke liye buddha dharm hi sahi dharm he jo vah khud ko bachaane ke liye hona chahie tha
 This is why the fact of Buddhism is that, the literature of Buddhism is so vast that no one can read about it in full, that is why it makes a slow advance
 yah ek bible ke rup main aisi koi baat nahin he ki isaayiyon ke rup main he, isaki sabase badi baadha he
 Upon publication of this article, i received several calls, written and oral, to write such a book
 yah in kahata he ki main kaam kiye hai ke jawaab main he
 The book is written as an answer for the modern students Buddhism faces
 shuruuaat main, lekhak ke baahar soochibaddh chaar sawaal: The first problem is related to the main event in the life of Buddha, namely, Parivarja
 kyon buddha parivraja le gaye the? paramparaagat jawaab yah he ki unhone parivraja li kyonki unhone ek mrit vyakti, ek biimaar vyakti or ek buudhe vyakti ko dekha he
 The answer to this question is absurd on the face
 buddha ne 29 saal kii umr main parivraja le li to vah in teenon sthalon main se ek parinaam ke rup main parivraja le li, yah kaise vah in teen jagahen pehle nahin dekha tha he? ye saikadon dwaara hone vaali aam ghatnaon rahe hai, or buddha pehle unhen bhar main aa karne main vifal nahin ho saktaa tha
 It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that it was the first time he saw them
 spashtikaran prashansaneey nahin he or kaaran ke liye apil nahin karata he
 But if the answer is no, what is the real answer? duusari samasya yah he chaar arya satya dwaara banaai gai he
 Are they as part of the original teachings of the Buddha? This formula cuts to the root of Buddhism
 jivan du: kha he, mrityu du: kha he, or punarjanm du: kha he, to vahaan sab kuch kaa ek ant hota he
 Neither religion nor philosophy can help a man achieve happiness in the world
 agar koi du: kha se nahin batch paati he, to, kya buddha dharm kya kar sakate hai kar sakate hai, is tarah ke du: kha se aadmi he jo janm se hi kabhi vahaan raahat dene ke liye? chaar arya satya buddha dharm ke susamachar ko sweekaar gaiyr baudhon ke raste main ek mahaan badi baadha hai
 The four Aryans deny hope to man for truth
 chaar arya satya buddha ke susamachar nirashavad ke susamachar banaate hai
 Are they part of the original gospel form, or are they a later addition by the monks? teesri samasya aatma ke siddhanton, karm or punarjanm ke liye sambandhit he
 The Buddha denied the existence of the soul
 lekin unhone yah bhi karm or punarjanm ke siddhant kii pushti kii he kaha jaataa he
 One question arises at a time
 agar koi aatma he, kaise vahaan karm ho saktaa he? agar koi aatma he, kaise vahaan punarjanm ho saktaa he? ye chaunkaane vaala sawaal kar rahe hai
 In what sense did Buddha use the words karma and rebirth? Does he understand them in which they use them in a different sense than that used by the Brahmins of their day? If so, in what sense? Does he have the same feeling in which Brahmins use them? If so, is there not a terrible contradiction between the denial of the soul and the affirmation of karma and rebirth? This paradox needs to be resolved
 chauthi samasya bhikkhu se sambandhit he
 What was Buddha's object in making bhikkhu? The object was to make a right man? Or was your purpose to make people a social worker serving and being their friends, being guides and devoting their lives to philosophers? This is a very real question
 is par buddha dharm kaa bhavishya nirbhar karata he
 Bhikkhu is only a right man, so he is of no use for the propagation of Buddhism, because although a right man he is a selfish man
 agar, duusare haath par, vah ek saamaajik naukar he, vah sabit buddha dharm kii aashaa ho saktaa he
 This question is in the interest of theoretical stability, but not so much should be decided in the future interest of Buddhism

 farsi main 'mansabadar' kaa arth he mansab rakhanevaala
 Mansab in the Mughal Empire meant the status that the emperor conferred on his officials
 mansab do prakaar ke hote the, 'jaat' or 'savaar'
 The practice of Mansab first started in 1575 by Akbar
 'jaat' se taatpary mansabadar kii us sthiti se tha jo use prashaskeey padashrenee main praapt thi
 His salary was also determined in the same proportion on the basis of the salary lists which were in force at that time
 savaar shrenee se abhipraay tha ki kitna sainik dal ek mansabadar ko banaae rakhana he; or iske liye use kitna vetan milegaa
 This was determined by multiplying the prevailing payroll by the number of riders
 kaha jaataa he, mansab pratha kii utpatti praarambhik turki or mongol sena ke 'dashamalwatmak' sanghathan main dekhi ja sakati he or isi ko aadhaar maanakar akbar na keval vartmaan sainik shrenee ko 'jaat' shrenee main parivartit kiya or ek nai 'savaar' shrenee ko janm dekar us uddeshy ko puraa kiya jo ki pracheen shrenee karti thi
 But there is no evidence that even before 1575, mansions were given
 isse yahi prathit hota he ki 'jaat' tathaa 'savaar' shreniyon kaa armbh ek saath hi usee varsh kiya gaya
 In Akbar's time, the rider class was usually either equal to or less than the caste category
 jahangir ne mansabadari paddati main ek mahatvapurn prayog kiya arthath do ashv or teen ashv shrenee kaa prarambh
 The two-horse and three-horse range were considered part of the rider category
 do ashv teen ashv shrenee praapt karanevaale kaa vetan tathaa sainik jimmedaariyaan dono hi dohare ho jate the
 Salary on 'jat' category was determined separately for each category
 vetan main vruddhi shrenee main vruddhi hone ke samaanupaat main nahin haati thi
 The salary on the caste category below five thousand was determined differently in three classes - first, when the rider class is equal to the caste category; Second, when the 'rider' category is less than the 'jat' category but not less than half; Third when less than half
 pratham vargvaalon kaa vetan dwitiya varg se, tathaa dwitiya vargvaalon kaa vetan tritiy varg se adhik hota tha
 The salaries on the ridership category did not vary according to categories; But the rate of pay per unit is stated permanently
 shahjahan se lekar baad tak 'savaar' shrenee ke prati ikai kii vetan kii dar aath hajaar daam thi
 The salary of the rider class can be calculated by multiplying this sum by the rider number
 mansabadar ko vetan yaa to nakad athwa jaagir ke rup main diya jaataa tha
 The 'monthly ratio' system was born during the reign of Shah Jahan
 yah vyavastha nakad vetanon par bhi lagu kii gai
 As a result, the salary, facilities and duties of the mansabdars decreased
 'nishchit vetan' main bahut si katautiyaan hoti thim
 The maximum reduction was done in the salaries of the Deccani mansabdars, and this was a quarter reduction in prices
 vishesh rup se na maaf hone par nimnlikhit katautiyaan sabhi mansabadaaron par lagu kii jaati thim- pashuon ke liye chaara, rasad ke liye maang tathaa rupe main do daam
 Akbar started the custom of firing in 1575 along with Mansab
 iskaa uddeshy pratyek mansabadar ko utane ghode tathaa ghudsavaar vaastavik rup main banaae rakhane ke liye majaboor karnaa tha, jitne usase rajkeey seva ke liye apekshit the
 Consequently, Akbar adopted the practice of staging horses and 'face' for individuals to prevent avoidance of military responsibilities
 abulafajl ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki akbar ke samay main mansabadar se ummid kii jaati thi ki vah utane sainik prastut karegaa jitani ki uski 'savaar' shrenee ho
 He was punished for not doing so
 vichaarneey baat rah jaati he ki mansabadar se uski 'savaar' shrenee ke anuroop jo sankhya pratyaashit hoti thi vah ghodon kii thi athwa sainikon kii ? shahjahan ke samay main 'tritiyansh' niyam ke antargat, 100 savaar shrenee vaale mansabadar ko 33 savaar or 66 ghode rakhane padate the
 It appears from this that in Akbar's time no more than 50 riders and 100 horses would have been asked for 100 'riders' category
 shahjahan ne nae sire se mansabadari paddati ko sangathit kiya
 The mansabdars who were appointed only in those areas where they had jagirs were expected to produce one-third of their 'riders' category; Appointed in territories where he did not have his fiefdoms only a quarter; And fifth when appointed in Balkh or Badakshan
 jin mansabadaaron ko vetan nakad miltaa tha unpar bhi paanchaven hisse kaa niyam lagu hota tha
 Under the Fifth Rule, there will be 1000 riders and 2200 horses in 5000 'riders' category in the annual arrangement
 siddhantaroop main samast mansabadaaron kii niyukti badshaah dwaara hoti thi
 Often the Mughal military recruitment was done on the basis of caste or descent, there was no special place for merit

 Fakhruddin's view has been supported by most scholars
 chunki bharat aane se purv hi yah jati afghanistan ke helemand nadi ke tateey kshetron ke un bhaagon main rahati thi, jise kilji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Probably that is why this caste was called Khilji
 maamluk athwa ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan shamsuddin kumors kii hatya ke baad hi jilaluddin firoj kilji singhaasana par baitha tha, isliye itihaas main kilji vansh kii sthapana ko kilji kranti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The Khilji revolution is not only important because it ended the Ghulam dynasty and established the new Khilji dynasty, but it is also important that the Khilji revolution resulted in the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate to the south

 cubai krantikari or rajaneta fidel kastro ne cubai kranti main 1953 se 1959 tak hissaa liya
 From his early life, Fidel Castro decided to overthrow the Fulgensio Batista military government through a military movement "movement"
 july 1953 main usne monkada baiyrakon par asafal hamale kaa prayaas kiya jiske dauraan kai chhapamar maare gaye or kastro giraftaar hue
 During the trial, Castro favored his antics and presented his famous "history will find me innocent" speech, after which he was sentenced to 15 years of model imprisonment in Izla de la Yuvantud

 In March 1952, the Cuban military general Fulgencio Batista took power, which led to the election of President Carlos Prio Socarras to run to Mexico
 apane aap raashtrapati ghoshit karte hue batista ne yojanaband raashtrapati chunaavon ko mansookh kiya or apni nai pranali ko "anushaasan-baddh loktantr" qaraar diya
 Like others, Castro also considered it a dictatorship of a person
 batista daayen ore badhkar poonjipatiyon or america se sambandh gahare kiye jabaki soviet sangh se rajanyik sambandh tod liye or mazdoor unionon kaa daman kiya or cuba ke samaajawaadee guton par muqadame darj kiye
 Castro brought several lawsuits against him with the intention of opposing the Batista regime and asserted that Batista had done a lot of criminal work which required his imprisonment and accused many ministers of breaking the labor laws
 kastro ke muqadame jab benattejey dikhaai padane lage, to usne nai sarkaar ko nikaalane ke anya vikalpon par gaur karnaa shuru kiya
 Unsatisfied with the non-violent opposition of Partido Oratodoxo, Castro founded the "movement", a party that had civil and military committees

 Despite Castro's deep connections to revolutionary socialism, he kept himself from joining the Communist PSP because it feared that political moderates would be intimidated, although he personally kept in touch with many PSP members, including his brother Raul Castro was also there
 baad ke samay main kastro ne kaha ki aandolan ke sadsy keval batista-virdohi the or unamem se shaayad hi koi kade samaajawaadee yaa samrajyavad-virdohi vichaar rakhata tha, jo ki kastro ke mutabiq "newyarki vichaardhaara or vigyaapan pranali kaa gaharaa prabhaav" tha, jiske kaaran se cuba ke kaamgaar varg kii varg chetana ko dabaaya ja rahaa tha
 "in a few moments from now, either you are victorious or defeated, but whatever - open your ears and friends, recognize that this movement has to be won

 Even if you fail, this step of ours will set an example for the Cuban public, which will bring fresh people who will be ready to die for Cuba
 aise sabhi log hamaara jhanda uthaakar aage badhenge


 Orient and people of all islands will support us
 '68 or '92 kii tarah ham yahan orient main azaadi yaa maut kaa pehla naaraa lagaayenge!" Castro collected weapons to attack the Moncada Barracks, a fictitious fortress in the Orient province outside Santiago de Cuba
 kastro ke chapa-maar ne iraadaa kiya tha ki fauziyon kii varadi pahanakar is thikaane par july 25 ko aayenge jo ki saint james ke tyohaar kaa samay tha jab adhikansh adhikari maujuud nahin hua karte the
 The rebels wanted to flee before more troops arrived, raiding the arms and taking them under their control
 tazaa hathiyaaron se las kastro apane hamiyon main astr baantna chahta tha jo orient ke garib chadi kaatane waalon se taluk rakhte the
 The subsequent plan was to seize the Santiago radio station, broadcast the manifesto of the movement and air the rebellion

 The attack occurred on July 26, 1953, but did not go according to plan; Three of the sixteen trains leaving Santiago could not reach there
 baiyrakon ke pahonchte hi alaaram baj gaya jiske saath hi thikaane ke baahar hi adhikansh baagiyon kaa safaaya kar diya gaya
 Those who came in had to face a severe interruption and four were killed in front of Castro

 Six of the rebels were killed and fifteen wounded, while nineteen soldiers were killed and twenty-seven wounded
 saundaryashastra samvednaatmak-bhaavnaatmak gun-dharm or mulyon kaa adhyayan he
 Aesthetics is the representation of art, culture and nature
 saundaryashastra, darshanashastra kaa ek ang he
 It is also called Soundaryamimansa and Anandamimansa
 soundaryashastra vah shaastra he jisamen kalatmak kritiyon, rachanaaon aadi se abhivyakt hone vaala athwa unamem nihit rahane vaale saundarya kaa tathvik, darshanik or maarmik vivechan hota he
 The main purpose of this is to discuss the nature and nature of the joyful feeling in our mind by looking at a beautiful object and to coordinate it with other sensations of life
 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse
 pracheen unani darshan main plato kii rachana hippiaz major main saundarya kii avadharana par charchaa milti he
 Aristotle's thoughts on the sad style of play in his poetics have influenced art-criticism for a long time

 non-western standards for interpreting this tradition of art-practice have not yet been formed, and interpretations made through Western standards have yielded unsatisfactory results

 This resulted in the formulation of the concept of fine arts by theorists

 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics
 kaant kii banaayi gayi zamin par hi baad main german vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kaa vrihattar darshanik dhaanchaa khadaa kiya
 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions

 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication

 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good
 samskruti-adhyayan ke tahat saundaryashastra ke abhijanonmukh rujhaanon kii kadi pariksha kii gayi he
 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he

 khagolashastra main khagoleey magnitude yaa khagoleey kantimaan kisi khagoleey vastu kii chamak kaa maap he

 satyanarayan bhagwaan kii katha lok main prachlit he
 Satyanarayana Vrat Katha is the true form of Lord Vishnu as the most revered fast story among Hindu religious leaders
 kuch log manauti puri hone par, kuch anya niyamit rup se is katha kaa aayojan karte hai
 There are two parts of the story of Satyanarayana, fast-worship and story
 satyanarayan vratakatha skandapurana ke revakhand se sankalit kii gai he
 Satya came to Narayan position
 kashtha-vikreta bhil bhi ati nirdhan tha
 Somehow he used to feed his family and his family by selling wood
 usne bhi sampoorn nishtha ke saath satyacharankia; satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchki
 King Ulkamukhi was also a loyal Satyavrathe
 ve niyamit rup se bhadrashilandi ke kinare sapatnik satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchkarte the
 Satyacharanhi was the origin of his life
 duusari taraf sadhu vanik evam raja tungadhjaswarthbadhakoti ke satyavrathithe
 Both these characters, being forced to selfish means, satyacharanakya; Satyanarayana worshiped God
 sadhu vanik kii satyanarayan bhagwaan main nishtha nahin thi
 After taking the resolution of Satyanarayana Poojarchaka, Kalavatinamak kanya-ratna was born in his family
 kanyajanmake pashchaat usne apane sankalp ko bhula diya or satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchanhin kii
 He postponed Pooja till the marriage of the girl
 kanya ke vivaah-avasar par bhi usne satyacharanevam puujarchaase munh mod liya or damaad ke saath vyapaar-yatra par chal pada
 Due to the incident, the father-in-law was accused of theft in Ratnasarpur
 yahaan unhen raja chandraketuke karagaar main rahanaa pada
 When the father-in-law and son-in-law were freed from prison, Shvasur lied to a Dandiswamy that his boat contained only Ratnadin, not a letter
 is mithyavadanke kaaran use sampatti-vinaash kaa ksht bhogana pada
 Finally obliged, he gave a fast to Lord Satyanarayana
 sadhu vanikke mithyaachaar ke kaaran uske ghar par bhi bhayankar chori ho gai
 Wives-son-in-law
 isi bich unhen sadhu vanikke sakushal ghar lautne kii soochna mili
 At that time Kalavati was worshiping Lord Satyanarayana with her mother Lilavati
 samachar sunate hi kalavatiapane pita or pati se milane ke liye daudi
 She forgot to receive the Lord's Prasad in the same manner
 prasad na grahan karne ke kaaran sadhu vanikaur uske damaad naav sahit samudr main dub gaye
 Then suddenly Kalavati remembered his mistake
 vah daudi-daudi ghar ai or bhagwaan kaa prasad liya
 After that everything went well
 lagbhag yahi sthiti raja tungadhijki bhi thi
 At one place Gopabandhu Bhagwan was worshiping Satyanarayana
 rajasattamadandhtungadhvajan to poojasthalpar gaye or na hi gopbandhuondvaara pradutt bhagwaan kaa prasad grahan kiya
 That is why he had to suffer
 antat:baadhya hokar unhone satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchki or satyacharanka vrath liya
 The five characters mentioned above in the Satyanarayana fasting story are not just Kathapatriahi, they symbolize two humanistic tendencies
 ye pravritiyaan hai, satyagrah evam mithyaagrah
 Sarvadin remains the holder of both tendencies in the world
 in paatro ke madhyam se skandapuranayah sandesh dena chahta he ki nirdhan evam sattahinavyakti bhi satyagrahi, satyavrati, satyanishth ho saktaa he or dhan tathaa sattasampannavyakti mithyagrahiho saktaa he
 Shatanand and the wood seller Bhil were poor and powerless
 phir bhi inamen teevr satyagrahavrittithi
 In contrast, the monks and monarchs Tungadhvajadhansampan and Sattasampanathe were
 par unki vritti mithyagrahithi
 Such a phenomenon is rare in a person with power and wealth
 satyanarayan vratakthake paatr raja ulkamukhisi hi viral koti ke vyakti the
 The implication of the entire Satyanarayana fasting story is that a man should take a fast of satyacharan for the spiritual and other spiritual practices
 satya hi, bhagwaan he
 Truth is Vishnu
 lok main sari buraaiyon, saare cleshon, saare sangharsho kaa mul kaaran he satyacharanka abhaav
 The verse in the story of Satyanarayana Vrat is as follows: Yatkrutvasarvadu: Khebhyo Muktobhavatimanava: visheshat:kaliyugesatyapujafalaprada
 Ketch Kaalvandishyantasamyamanthamavach
 satyanarayanankechit satyadevantthaapare
 Nana Rupadharohbhutvasarvaparamasprit: bhavishyatiklauvishnu: satyarupisnathan:
 That is, by performing the ritual of Satyanarayana fast, a person is free from all sorrows
 kalikaal main satya kii puja vishesh rup se faldaayihoti he
 Satya has many names, such as Satyanarayana, Satyadev
 sanathan satyarupivishnu bhagwaan kaliyug main anek rup dhaaran karke logon ko manovanchit fal denge
 By performing the ritual of Satyanarayana fast, man is freed from all sorrows
 kalikaal main satya kii puja vishesh rup se faldaayihoti he satya ke anek naam hai, yatha-satyanarayan, satyadev
 Lord Sanatan Satyarupi Vishnu will take many forms in Kali Yuga and give desired results to the people

 yah vishwaas is vichaar se upja he ki manushya prakritik rup se hinsak he yaa kuch paristhitiyon main tarksangat kaarak hinsak kaary karne ke liye prerit karenge
 Others, however, believe that wars are not a natural part of human nature and this myth actually prevents people from being motivated for world peace
 vishwa shanti kaise praapt kii ja sakati he, iske liye kai siddhanton kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 Many of these are listed below
 vishwa shanti hasil kii ja sakati he, jab sansadhano ko lekar sangharsh nahin ho
 For example, oil is one such resource and the conflict over the supply of oil is well known
 isliye, pun: prayojya eendhan strot kaa upyog karne vaali praudyogiki viksit karnaa vishwa shanti hasil karne kaa ek tarika ho saktaa he
 It is claimed that sometimes world peace is an inevitable consequence of a particular political ideology
 purv america raashtrapati jorge dablyoo bush ke mutabik "loktantr kaa prayaag vishwa shanti kaa netritv karegaa
" ek marxvaadi vichaarak leone trotski kaa maananaa he ki vishwa kranti communist vishwa shanti kaa netritv karegi
 Proponents of the controversial Democratic peace doctrine claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democratic countries never or rarely wage war against each other
 
 jaik levi baar-baar- jor de kar yah siddhant bataate hai ki "chaahe kuch bhi ho, antarrashtriya sambandhon main hamen ek vyavhaarik kanoon kii aavashyaktaa he"
 Countries that have become democratic since the Industrial Revolution are increasing
 ek vishwa shanti is prakaar sambhav he, agar yah rujhaan jari rahe or agar loktantric shanti siddhant sahi ho
 However, there are several possible exceptions to this theory
 apni "capitalism pis theory" pustak main aayan rand maanati he ki itihaas ke bade yuddh us samay ke apekshaakrit adhik niyantrit arthvyavasthaaon vaale deshon dwaara mukt ke khilaaf lade gayi or us poonjeevaad ne maanav jati ko itihaas main sabase lambey samay tak shanti pradaan kii or jis avadhi main puri sabhy duniya kii bhagidaari main 1815 main nepolian yuddh ke ant se 1914 main pratham vishwa yuddh ke chhidane tak yuddh nahin hue
 It must be remembered that nineteenth-century political systems were not pure capitalist, but rather mixed economies
 haalanki poonjeevaad ke tatv kaa prabhutv tha, par yah poonjeevaad kii ek sadi ke utane hi kareeb tha, jitna maanav jati ke aane tak tha
 But elements of statehood flourished throughout the nineteenth century and by the time of its eruption in 1914, the governments involved dominated the policies of statehood
 haalanki, is siddhant ne europe ke baahar ke deshon, saath hi saath ekikaran ke liye germany or italy main hue yudhon, franko-percian yuddh or europe ke anya sangharshon ke khilaaf pashchimi deshon dwaara chede gayi krur aupniveshik yudhon kii andekhi kii
 It presents the absence of war as a scale of peace, when class struggle actually existed
 cobdenism ke kuch samarthakon kaa daawa he ki tarriff hataane or antarrashtriya mukt vyapaar shuru karne se yudhon asambhav ho jaayenge, kyonki mukt vyapaar ek raashtra ko aatmanirbhar banane se roktaa he, jo lambey yudhon kii ek aavashyaktaa he
 For example, if one country produces firearms and the other produces ammunition, both will fight each other, because the first will be unable to acquire ammunition and the second to acquire weapons
 aalochakon kaa tark he ki mukt vyapaar ek desh ko yuddh ke maamle main asthaayee rup se aatmanirbhar banane kii apaat yojana banane se nahin roak saktaa yaa ek desh saadhaaran taur par apni jarurat ek duusare desh se puri kar saktaa he
 a good example of this is the First World War
 britain or germany donon yuddh ke dauraan aanshik rup se aatmanirbhar banane main kaamyaab ho gayi
 This was particularly important because of the fact that Germany had no plans to create a war economy
 adhik aam taur par, iske anya samarthakon kaa tark he ki mukt vyapaar, bhale hi yuddh ko asambhav nahin banaayen, par vah yuddh kara saktaa he or yudhon ke kaaran vyapaar par pratibandh kai vibhinn deshon main utpaadan, anusandhan or bikri main lagi antarrashtriya companiyon ke liye mahange sabit ho sakate hai
 In this way, a powerful lobby - which is not present only because of national companies, can argue against the war
 dwipaksheeya aashwast vinaash kaha jaataa he) sainya ranneeti kaa ek siddhant he, jisamen do pratidwandvi pakshon dwaara purna paimaane par parmaanu hathiyaaron ke upyog se hamalavar or rakshak dono ke vinaash kaa prabhavi parinaam nikalataa he
 During the Cold War, the proponents of a policy of assured bilateral destruction, the lethality of the war grew so much that there was no possibility of any net gain for either side and thus the wars proved futile
 kuch log rashtriya raajnneeti main ek pravriti dekhte hai, jiske tahat nagar-rajya or raashtra-rajya ekikrut ho gayi or suzav diya ki antarrashtriya manch iskaa paalan karegaa
 Many countries, such as China, Italy, the United States, Germany, India, and Britain, were unified, while the European Union later complied with it and indicated that more globalization would help create a unified world order
 pruthakatawaad or gaiyr-hastkshepwaad ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki kai rashtron se bani ek duniya us samay tak shantipurvak sah-astitv ke saath rah sakati he, jab tak vah gharelu maamalon kii taraf majbootee se dhyaan kendrit rakhe or duusare deshon par apni ichha thopane kii koshish nahin kare
 Separationism should not be confused with non-interventionism
 gaiyr-hastkshepwaad kii tarah pruthakatawaad duusare rashtron ke aantarik maamalon main hastkshep se bachane kii salaah detaa he, lekin sangrakshanvaad or antarrashtriya vyapaar or paryaton par pratibandh par jor detaa he
 Non-interventionism, on the other hand, advocates a combination of free trade political and military non-interference
 japan jaise raashtra shaayad ateet main pruthakatavaadi nitiyon kii sthapana ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai
 The Japanese Edo, Tokugawa, started a separatist period Edo period, under which Japan separated itself from the whole world
 yah ek prasiddh algaav avadhi thi or kai kshetron main acchhee tarah pralekhith kii gai
 World peace is depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behavior that prevents the institutionalization of power and promotes violence
