 pelucida kshetra ke bheetar kaa lambii rekha utpann hoti he jo koshikaon ke adhik sankhya main ekatra hone ke kaaran banati he
 The primitive streak is the place where the cells of the epiblast enter the embryo and form the notochordal somite and lateral plaques
 standhari jantuon ke blastodarm kaa primitive stric bhi isi prakruti kaa hota he
 Therefore, the primitive streak is thought to be similar to the slastopore of an aphibia
 prarambh main uragon main bhrun kaa parivardhan pakshiyon ke samaan hota tha kintu antargaman anfibia ke sadrush hota he
 Due to intensive cell division, a line arises in the middle of the pelusida region, called a primitive knot or primitive plate
 is kshetra main antargaman hone se arthath koshikaon kaa tal neeche dabane se ek guha ban jaati he
 Through this cavity, it can be interpreted as the blastopore of the embryo of the anphibia and the cavity as the arcanteric cavity

 Some people try to organize or make certain the seemingly difficult task of software writing
 anya log software lekhan ke liye pariyojna prabandhan takanic prayog main laate hai
 Without project management, the delivery of software projects can be easily delayed or its cost may be higher than the budget

 is bindu par apurna, aspasht yaa virodhabhasi aavashyaktaaon kii kushal or anbhavi software ejiniyaron ke dwaara pahchaan kii jaati hai
 Performing live code frequently can reduce the risk of inaccurate requirements
 ek baar graahakon se saamaanya aavashyaktaaon ko ekatrit kar lene ke baad vikaas ke kaary-kshetra ke vishleshan kaa nirdhaaran kiya janaa chahie or ise spasht rup se vyakt karnaa chahie
 This is often called a work-related document
 laagat ke falan ke kaaran yaa vikaas ke aarambh main aspasht aavashyaktaaon ke parinaamon ke kaaran kuch kaaryaatmakataa pariyojna ke kaary-kshetra se baahar ho ja sakati he
 If development is done externally, this document can be considered a legal document to clarify any confusion regarding promises made to the customer if there is a dispute
 ek nae software ko taiyaar karne main aksar domen vishleshan pehla kadam hota he
 Whether it is an addition to the current software, a new program, a new subsystem or a completely new system
 yah maanakar ki developers naye software ke vishay-kshetra ke kushal jaankaar nahin hai, pehla kaam software ke tathakthith 'domen' kaa pataa lagaana he
 The more knowledgeable they are already in relation to domains, the less work is required

 If the analyst does not use proper terminology, then it is likely that his words will not be taken seriously
 Thus, this step will be an important prelude to finding and collecting requirements
 yadi kisi vishleshak ne uchit kaam nahin kiya he to bhram utpann ho saktaa he: "main jaanata hum ki aap yah maanate hai ki maine jo kaha uske sambandh main aap jo sochate he use aapane samaj liya, lekin main is sambandh main nishchit nahin hum ki aap yah samajhate hai ki aapane jaisaa suna vah meraa matlab nahin tha "
 The specification is the function under which the software to be written is probably described correctly
 vyaavhaarik rup se, sabase safal vinirdeshon ko pehle se hi suviksit prograamon ko samajhane or adhik anukool banane ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 However, often before the development of a program, a very detailed description of the most important software systems is given in terms of security
 vinirdesh bahari antarfalkon ke liye sabase adhik mahatvapurn hote hai jinhen sthir bana rahanaa chahie
 vinirdesh paryaapt rup se sahi hai yaa nahin iskaa nirdhaaran karne kaa ek acha tarika aavashyaktaaon or upyog kii sthitiyon kii shuddh rup se sakshmata sunishchit karne ke liye tisare paksh dwaara dastavejon kii samiksha karana he
 The design of a software system or software structure is an abstract representation of that system
 sanrachana kaa sambandh yah sunishchit karnaa he ki software system utpaada kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karegaa, saath hi saath yah bhi sunishchit karnaa he ki bhavishya main aavashyaktaaon ke sambandh main charchaa kii ja sakati he
 Structural steps discuss interfaces between software systems and other software products, as well as the underlying hardware or operator operating systems
 karyanvayan prakriya kaa ek hissaa he jahaan software ejeeniyar pariyojna ke liye code kaa program likhte hai
 Software testing is an integral and important part of the software development process
 prakriya kaa yah hissaa yah sunishchit karata he ki bag kii pahchaan yathashighra kar lee jaye
 The internal design of the software is documented throughout the development with the aim of maintaining and enhancing the software in the future
 isamen ek API kaa sanlekhan shaamil ho saktaa he, chaahe vah bahari yaa aatanrik ho
 Deployment begins after the code is properly tested, approved for issue and sale, or otherwise distributed in a production environment
 software prashikshan or sahaayta mahatvapurn he, kyonki software pariyojnaon kaa ek bada pratishat is kaaran se asafal ho jaataa he ki developers yah nahin samaj pate hai ki yadi sanstha main koi bhi vyakti software kaa antim upyog nahin karata he to ise viksit karne vaale dal dwaara software ko taiyaar karne main lage samay or yojana kaa koi mahatva nahin rahata he
 People are often resistant to change and avoid taking risks in an unfamiliar area
 isliye pariniojan charan ke hissaa ke rup main, aapke software ke nae graahakon ke liye prashikshan kakshaen yojit hona bahut aavashyak he
 Maintenance and enhancement of software may take longer than the initial development of the software to cope with new undiscovered problems or new requirements
 apratyaashit samasya main sudhaar karne ke liye ek code ko jodna aavashyak he jo mul dizin main upyukt nahin bataata he yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki koi graahak adhik kaaryaatmakataa kaa anurodh kar rahaa ho or unke anurodh ko samyojit karne ke liye code ko joda ja saktaa he
 At this stage customers' calls are received and you see whether your testing was widely enough to solve the problems before the customer used them
 yadi anurakshan vaale charan kaa shram laagat purv charnon ke shram laagat kii apeksha 25% se adhik hota he, to yah sambhaavna hoti he ki kam se kam ek purv charan kii samgr gunvattta acchhee nahin he
 In that case, management should consider the option of rebuilding the system before maintenance costs are uncontrolled
 kisi vaastavik yaa mahasoos kiye gaye vishyon kii pahchaan karne vaale software kaa pareekshan karne vaale graahakon / kshetra dalon ke saath interphes dwaara jude rahane ke liye vikaas dalon ko anumati pradaan karne ke liye prakriya ke is charan main aksar bag trekking system upkaran pariniojit kiye jate hai

 aglaa charan kuta lekhan he, jo sabhi pareekshanon ke biit jane or programmer dwaara or adhik pareekshan karne kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos nahin kiye jane ke baad purna ho jaataa he
 Design and structure arise from refactoring and after code writing
 dizin unheen logon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he jo kuta lekhan karte hai
 Is used or demonstrated effectively
 At this point, experts resume test writing for the next most important part of the system
 waterfol model ek prakriya ko darshata he, jahaan developers ko in kadamon kaa kram se paalan karnaa padataa he: Just as the builder does not change the foundation of the house after the structure is erected, the process moves on to the next step after each step is completed

 Defendant reasoning has an increased cost in eliminating problems caused by the introduction of repetition by critics of the process
 yah bhi ek kaarak he jo supurdagee ke samay ko badha detaa he or ucch jokhim vaali pariyojnaon main bhi is prakriya ko teji se alokapriy bana detaa he
 This approach is used in high-risk projects, especially in large defense contracts

 Formal methods are mathematical approaches to solving software problems at the level of requirements, specification and design
 aupchaarik paddatiyon ke udhaaharan main bi-vidhi, petri nets, swachaalit prameya siddh karnaa, RAISE or VDM shaamil hai
 Various formal specification notations, such as z notation, are available

 Finite state device based methods allow creating subroutines for executable software specification and traditional coding
 aupchaarik paddatiyon kaa adhik sambhawatah vayaviki software main anuprayog kiya ja saktaa he, vishesh rup se jahaan software suraksha kii drushti se mahatvapurn he
 Software security guarantee standards, such as DO178B, demand formal methods at the highest level of classification

 Another emerging trend in software development is writing a specification in some form of logic and then executing that logic as if it were a program
 varnan tark par aadhaarit OWL bhashaa iskaa ek udahaaran he
 Some versions of English in logical form and logical form are in the process of auto-mapping the forms and executing the logic directly
 iske udhaaharan hai niyantrit prakritik angreji bhashaa or internet vyavsaay sambandhi tark, jinhen shabdkosh yaa vaakya vinyas ko niyantrit nahin karnaa padataa he
 Bidirectional English — a feature of the system of directly executing logical mapping and reasoning is that they can explain their results in English at a professional or scientific level
