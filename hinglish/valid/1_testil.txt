 He said that non-arabs, Islam Converting 'neo-muslim' to an established Muslim cannot be considered as a kafa, nikah purpose

 Maulvi Qari Mohammed Tayyeb Siddiqui, the first president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and vice-chancellor of the Deoband madrasa, was also a supporter of casteism and wrote two books in support of Mufti Usmani's book: "ansab wa kabil ka taafajul" and "nasb and Islam

 Although some scholars theorize that there is no discrimination among the Muslim castes like the Hindu castes, Dr
 Ambedkar gave his argument to the contrary that the social evils in the Muslim society were "worse than the Hindu society"
 babasaheb ambedkar bhartiya raajnneeti ke vikhyath vyakti the or bhartiya samvidhan ke mukhya vaastukar hai
 He was bitterly critical of the Muslim caste system and their practices, citing that "these groups have the same social preference within the caste as the Hindus but in many ways are worse than the Hindu castes
" "

 Sufism, a mystical dimension of Islam, often supplemented with the legal path of the Shari'a, had a profound impact on the growth of Islam in India

 Catherine was highly influenced by Chekhov and together with the Ukrainian writer SS Koteliंski, she later translated Chekhov's letters into Russian to English
 haalaanki e0 si0 ward ke anusaar catherine kii shailigat samanta hi chekhav se adhik thi

 In physics, the rotation of the axis of a rotating object is known as precession or aion
 purassaran do tarah kaa hota he- Often we see that the axis of a rotating object changes its position
 duusare shabdon main, ghurnan-aksh swayan kisi anya aksh ke paritah ghurnan kar rahaa hota he
 In astronomy, a rotating or orbital parameter of a celestial body is gradually changed to aion
 aadhe varsh tak surya, akaash ke uttar golardh main rahata he, aadhe varsh tak dakshin golardh me
 While moving from the South Hemisphere to the North Hemisphere, the point of the sky at which the center of the Sun resides is called Vasantvishuv
 yah vindu taron ke saapeksh sthir nahin he; yah dhire-dhire khisakta rahata he
 This move is called equinox ion or simply anion
 vasantvishuv se chalakar or ek chakkar lagaakar jitne kaal main surya phir vahiin lautataa he utane ko ek sayan varsh kehete hai
 The return of the Sun from a star is called the sidereal year
 yadi vishuv chalata na hota to sayan or nakshatra varsh baraabar hote
 Due to aion there is a difference of few minutes in both the years
 aadhunik naapon ke anusaar ausat nakshatra varsh kaa maan 365 din, 6 ghanta, 9 minute, 9
6 second ke lagbhag or ausat sayan varsh kaa maan 365 din, 5 ghanta, 48 minute, 46
054 second ke lagbhag he
 a practical year should be kept according to the year of sion, otherwise the beginning of the year will not always be there in a season
 hinduon main jo varsh abhi tak prachlit tha vah sayan varsh se kuch minute bada tha
 Therefore, the beginning of the year was moving forward
 udhaahrant: pichley dhai hajaar varshon main 21 yaa 22 din kaa antar pad gaya he
 It is not possible to tell exactly because Suryasiddhanta, Brahmasiddhanta, Aryabhatiya, etc
 have different Varshamanas
 yadi ham log do chaar hajaar varshon tak puraane varshmaan kaa hi prayog karen to sawan bhadon ke maheene us ritu main padenge jab kadaake kaa jaada padataa rahegaa
 That is why the Government of India has now adopted 365
2422 days of cyan year in its national almanac
 ayan kaa ek parinaam yah hota he ki akashiya dhruv, arthath akaash kaa vah bindu jo prithvi ke aksh kii sidh main he, taron ke bich chalata rahata he
 He makes one round in about 26,000 years
 jab kabhi uttar akashiya dhruv kisi chamkile taare ke paas aa jaataa he to vah tara prithvi ke uttar golardh main dhruvatara kahalaane lagata he
 At this time, the north celestial pole is near the first small Saptarshi
 isiilie is taare ko ham dhruvatara kehete hai
 Right now the celestial pole is going near the pole, so the aforesaid star will be called the pole pole for hundreds of years
 lagbhag 5,000 varsh pehle pratham kaaliy naamak tara dhruvatara kahalaane yogya tha
 There was no star in the middle that would be called Dhruvatara
 aaj se 15,000 varsh pehle abhijeet naamak tara dhruvatara tha
 In our Griha Sutras, there is an order to perform Dhruvadarshan on the occasion of marriage
 pratyaksh he ki us samay koi na koi dhruvatara avashya tha
 It has been estimated that this practice must have been around 5,000 years ago
 shatapath brahman main likhaa he ki krittikas purv main udai hoti hai
 Due to this, around 3,000 BC The scripture seems to be because, due to the aeon, the rodents did not rise before and after it
 lattu ko nachaakar bhoomi par ek prakaar rakh dene se ki lattu kaa aksh khadaa na rahakar tirachha rahe, lattu kaa aksh dhire-dhire mandraata rahata he or vah ek shanku parilikhat karata he
 In the same way, the axis of the Earth transcribes a cone whose half-vertex is about 23 degrees
 kaaran yah he ki prithvi thik-thik golakaar nahin he
 The diameter is greater on the Mediterranean
 mote hisaab se ham yah maan sakate hai ki kendriya bhaag shuddh rup se golakar he or uske baahar niklaa bhaag bumadhyarekha par chipka hua ek valay he
 The Sun always attracts the Earth by staying in the plane of the Ravi Marg
 yah aakarshan prithvi ke centre se hokar nahin jaataa, kyonki purvakalpit valay kaa ek khand apekshaakrit surya ke kuch nikat rahata he, doosraa kuch dur
 Attraction falls more on the proximal part, less on the remote
 isliye in aakarshanon kii yah pravriti hoti he ki prithvi ko ghumaakar uske aksh ko ravimaarg ke dharaatal par lamb kar den
 If this rotation is combined with the rotation of the Earth's own axis, then the direction of the resulting rotation axis comes out which is slightly different from the old direction of the Earth's axis, that is, the Earth's axis from its old position to this new position Comes in duusare shabdon main, prithvi kaa aksh ghumta rahata he
 The moon also helps in rotating this type of axis
 vastut: chandramaa kaa prabhaav surya kii apeksha duuna padataa he
 On doing a subtle calculation, everything comes out exactly as seen by the piercer
 prithvi kii madhyarekha ke foole dravya par surya ke assam aakarshan se prithvi kaa aksh ek shanku parilikhit karata he
 The level of the Chandra Marg makes an angle of 5 degrees from the level of the Ravi Marg
 is kaaran chandramaa prithvi ko kabhi ravimaarg ke upar se khinchataa he, kabhi neeche se
 As a result, the angle between the equator and the surface of the sunway also varies slightly
 jise ''vidolan kehete hai
 Due to the moving of the Earth, both the spring and autumn equinoxes keep moving
 upar bataae gaye ayan ko chandra-saura-ayan kehete hai
 In this, the surface of the Mediterranean varies
 parantu grahon ke aakarshan ke kaaran swayan ravimaarg thodaa vichlit hota he
 This also makes a difference in the position of the equinox
 ise grahiy ayan kehete hai

 Before knowing about Mul Dwarka i
e
 oriental Dwarka, Mul Dwarka, we have to know about Prabhas Tirtha
 
 Dāyātevārī ra दुष्praकोkā maya: Sangamsya Rupo Sarvadham 
tirthana pradhan tirthasy rupah prabhas teerthamuttamam
 pashrchim bharat ke saurashtra praant ke sagartatpar 20, 15 akshansh or 70,28 rekhaansh par atyant praachin prabhas naamak tirthakshetra he isi jagah par itihaas prasikad somnath mandir he
 On the bank of the deer river of Prabhas Tirtha, Lord Krishna had departed to Paramdham after killing his body
 prabhas tirth se 7 kimi kii duri par sthit he verawal railwestation, verawal se prabhas tirth ko bas, rickshaw aisi aneko suvidhaose jode rakhaa he
 Dwarka, the historical city of Lord Krishna near Prabhas, due to this city being on the seashore, had the same gate i
e
 the whole city, hence the gate was named Aka = Dwarka
 dwarka aaj ke prabhas se 36 kimi ke duri par purab kii ore he
 It is called Mul Dwarka
 ye puratatviya puraave se sidhd ho gaya he kii mul dwarka hi bhagwaan shrikrishna kii aitihasik nagari dwarka he
 Lord Krishna built Dwarka city from Devashilpi Vishwakarma in Dwapar era, when all its palace houses and old cities were made of gold
 jab prabhas tirth ke hiran nadi ke kinare bhagwaan shrikrishna ne apana dehtyag karke paramdhaam ko prasthaan kiya tha tab sone kii dwarka ko akasmaat gaayab kar diya kyon kii dwapar yug khatm hokar kaliyug ko shuruyaat hone vaali thi
 According to the Mahabharata, Yadav could worship Dwarka from Prabhas in 2 to 3 hours
 bhagwaan shrikrishna ne apana dehtyag karke paramdhaam ko prasthaan karne se pehle ek bhill ne bhagwaan shrikrishna ke pair ke anguthe ko hiran samajkar baan maar diya
 In the same way that no ash is left after burning Kapura, in the same way Lord Krishna left his very beautiful and holy earth body in Panchatatva and departed to Paramdham
 uski yaad me prabhas tirth naamak chotasa gaav maatr rah gaya he
 In the 7th century AD, Varaheedas also destroyed that small village, that king Ishwarji Chavda settled a city called Okki Dwarka in Okha region, which remains a pilgrimage center of faith today
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii dwarka 24 mile pasri hui thi, us vakt kaa harikot or aajkaa hirakot aajke kodinar gaav tak faili thi
 Thus, Dwarka of Lord Krishna is not Dwarka today
 o Mulav Dwarka is located 42 km away from Veraval towards Purab

 Although the tree sparrow is expanding its territory in Fennoscandia and in Eastern Europe, its population is declining in most of Western Europe, the same trend is also reflected in other farmland birds such as shattering birds, corn bunting and northern lapwing
 From 1980 to 2003, there has been a 28 percent decline in the total population of birds with common agricultural land

 The large decline in the number of tree sparrows is probably due to intensive agriculture and specialization in the agricultural sector, especially the use of minor plant pesticides and the practice of sowing crops in autumn
 Due to the change from mixed to specialization agriculture and the increasing use of pesticides, the food available as small insects for newborn birds has also decreased

5 kilograms per bird per year, for which he moved three million people
 And put kak-fugitives which exhaust the birds to the extent of death
 Although initially successful, The "great Sparrow Campaign" later ignored the number of locusts and other harmful pests eaten by birds as food and led to a fall in crop production, leading to famine conditions
 Due to which 30 million people died between 1959 and 1961

 History of ancient Egypt By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of North Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the region's population to migrate to the shores of the Nile Valley and nomadic moderns from the late Middle Pleistocene about 120 thousand years ago
 Human hunters began living in the area, the Nile River has been the lifeline of Egypt ever since

 He estimated the area of a circle by subtracting the ninth part of its diameter and doubling the result

 This golden ratio is reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including pyramids, but its use may have been an unintended consequence of ancient Egyptian practice combining the use of nodular ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony
 pracheen misr kii samskruti or smarakon ne duniya par ek sthaayee viraasat chhod di he
 For example, the cult of the goddess Isis became popular in the Roman Empire, while obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome

 However, European colonial occupation in Egypt destroyed a significant portion of this country's historical heritage, with some foreigners producing more positive results
 For example, Napoleon conducted the first study in Egyptology when he brought about 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's natural history, which was published in Description de l'ėgypte

 The above rule applies to all human actions, whether these actions have happened before or in the future
 manushya keval chetana se utpann prerana ke kaaran koi kaam kar saktaa he
 There is a fundamental connection between consciousness and the character of man
 chetana vah vishesh gun he jo manushya ko jivit banaati he or charitra uskaa vah sampurna sanghathan he jiske dwaara uske jivit rahane kii vaastaviktaa vyakt hoti he tathaa jiske dwaara jivan ke vibhinn kaary chalaae jate hai
 The consciousness and character of a human being are not only his personal property
 ye bahut dinon ke saamaajik prakram ke parinaam hote hai
 Each person presents their inheritance in themselves
 vah vishesh prakaar ke sanskaar paitrik sampatti ke rup main paata he
 He also represents history in itself, because he has found different types of education and training in life
 iske atirikt vah duusare logon ko bhi apane dwaara nirupit karata he, kyonki unka prabhaav uske jivan par unke udhaaharan, upadesh tathaa avapeedan ke dwaara padaa he

 is prakaar manushya kii chetana athwa viveki man uske avchetan, athwa prakritik, man par apana niyantran rakhata he

 pashuon ke jivan main is prakaar kaa niyantran nahin rahata, atev jaisaa ve chaahate hai vaisaa karte hai
 Human being is a conscious creature, so before taking any action, he thinks well about its result
 manovigyaan kii drushti se chetana maanav main upasthit vah tatv he jiske kaaran use sabhi prakaar kii anubhutiyaan hoti hai
 It is because of consciousness that we see, hear, understand and think on many topics
 isi ke kaaran hamen sukh-du:kha kii anubhuti bhi hoti he or ham isi ke kaaran anek prakaar ke nishchay karte tathaa anek padaarthon kii prapti ke liye cheshtaa karte hai
 There are three characteristics of human consciousness
 vah gyanatmak, bhavatmak or kriyaatmak hoti he
 Indian philosophers have called it Sachchidananda form
 aadhunik manovaigyanikon ke vichaaron se ukt niropagya kii pushti hoti he
 Consciousness is the element in which there is a feeling of knowledge, of emotion and of person, that is, action
 jab ham kisi padaarth ko jaanate hai, to uske swaroop kaa gyaan hamen hota he, uske prati priy athwa apriy bhav paidaa hota he or uske prati ichha paidaa hoti he, jiske kaaran yaa to ham use apane sameep laate athwa use apane se dur hataate hai
 Consciousness has been considered as a self-illuminating element in philosophy
 manovigyaan abhi tak chetana ke swaroop main aage nahin bad sakaa he
 Consciousness makes all things, root conscious, body mind, inanimate living, brain, etc
, represent their nature
 phir chetana ko inke dwaara samajhane kii cheshtaa karnaa avichaar he
 According to the statement of Megadugal Mahasya, just as physical science has its own methods of thinking and special methods, in the same way, it has its own methods and methods of thinking about consciousness
 atev chetana ke vishay main bhautik vigyaan kii vidhiyon se na to sochaa ja saktaa he or na uske pradutt iske kaam main aa sakate hai
 Then physics itself has not been able to publish a definite opinion about the nature of its final units which are the basis of that science
 padaarth, shakti, gati aadi ke vishay main abhi tak kaamchalaoo jaankaree ho saki he
 The final decision has not been taken yet about his appearance
 atev chetana ke vishay main antim nirnay kii aashaa kar lenaa yuktisangat nahin he
 Explaining consciousness through unconscious elements, that is, adding a work-cause relationship to it, is downright indiscriminate
 chetana ko jin manovaigyanikon ne jad padaarth kii kriyaaon ke parinaam ke rup main samajhane kii cheshtaa kii he arthath jinhone ise shaareerik kriyaaon, snaayuon ke spandan aadi kaa parinaam mana he, unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 He has eliminated the presence of consciousness
 pavalaaf or watasan mahoday ke chintan kaa yahi parinaam hua he
 According to his statement, thinking about mind or consciousness in psychology is futile
 manovigyaan kaa vishay manushya kaa drishyman vyavhaar hi hona chahie
 Psychologists have different opinions about the relationship in the body of consciousness
 kuch ke anusaar manushya ke brihat mastishk main honevaali kriyaaon, arthath kuch naadiyon ke spandan kaa parinaam hi chetana he
 It is not an independent element in itself
 dusron ke anusaar chetana swayan tatv he or uskaa sharir se aapasi sambandh he, arthath chetana main honevaali kriyaayein sharir ko prabhavit karti hai
 Sometimes the body is not affected by the actions of consciousness and sometimes the actions of the body do not affect consciousness
 ek mat ke anusaar sharir chetana ke kaary karne kaa yantra maatr hai, jise vah kabhi upyog main laati he or kabhi nahin laati
 But if the device deteriorates, or breaks down, then consciousness becomes crippled for its work
 kuch gambhir manovaigyanik vichaarkon dwaara vigyaan kii vartmaan pragati kii avasthaa main uparyukt mat hi sarvottam mana gaya he
 Three levels of consciousness are considered: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 chetan str par ve sabhi baaten rahati hai jinke dwaara ham sochate samajhate or kaary karte hai
 Man's ego remains in consciousness and here is the organization of thoughts
 avchetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jinka gyaan hamen tatkshan nahin rahata, parantu samay par yaad kii ja sakati hai
 In the unconscious level, there are things which we have forgotten and which we do not remember even after our hard work and through special process which are reminded
 jo anubhutiyaan ek baar chetana main rahati hai, ve hi kabhi avchetan or achetan man main chali jaati hai
 These sensations are not completely passive, but continue to affect humans inadvertently
 chetana saamaajik vaataavaran ke sampark se viksit hoti he
 Man gets morality, justification and tact from the influence of environment
 ise chetana kaa vikaas kaha jaataa he
 At the height of development, consciousness realizes freedom
 vah saamaajik baton ko prabhavit kar sakati he or unase prabhavit hoti he, parantu is prabhaav se apane aapako alag bhi kar sakati he
 This kind of feeling of consciousness is addressed with the words pure Chaitanya or Pramata, Atma etc
