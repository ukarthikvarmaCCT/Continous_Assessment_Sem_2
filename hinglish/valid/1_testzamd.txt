 After the breakup of the Roman Empire, it was captured by the uncivilized castes of Western Europe - Frank Lombard and the Goths
 in luteri jatiyon ne samaaj or sarkaar ko sarvatha naveen rup diya
 By the fifth century the Roman Empire had become unable to defend itself
 german kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman ke kaaran italy ke gaanv asurakshit se ho gaye the, kyonki sarkaar suraksha karne main samarth nahin thi jiske parinamswaroop janata ne apni suraksha ke liye shaktishaalee varg se samjhauta kiya
 These powerful classes later became the basis of feudalism

 According to him, "in the birth of feudalism, the sense of security was predominant
 sambhavit videshi akraman tathaa sarkari afasaron kii aniyantrit maangon se chhutkaare ke liye ek aisi satta kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii ja rahi thi, jo unhen kisi bhi keemat par suraksha pradaan kar sake

 While affirming some of these grounds, Dr
 Satish Chandra opined that "feudalism in Europe was related to two systems, one of which was the agricultural slave system and the other was the military organization
 ’’ is aadhaar par krishi daasatv evam sainik sanghathan donon samantvaad ke mukhya aadhaar he
 On the basis of this analysis, it can be said that feudalism was an administrative system based on decentralization related to the land system in Europe in which feudal was the bridge between the supreme power and the peasants, which were connected to both the parties through fixed contracts
 europe main rajya seva karne ke puraskaar swaroop saamanton ko bhoomi di jaati thi or un saamanton kii prashasnic dekh-rekh main jitna kshetra hota tha, uskaa puraa rajasav unheen ko praapt hota tha kintu vah apane adhinsth logon ke praapt kar main se apane prabhu ko niyamit rup se kuch nazar bhejtaa rahegaa
 The king used to give land to the officers for cash
 jameen un anya logon ko bhi di jaati thi jinako raja puraskrit karnaa chahta tha
 Hence, in European feudalism, peasants had to work for landlords or individuals who were given land and who were called feudal lords
 saamanton kaa kartavya raja ke liye sainik ekatra karnaa tha
 Prof
 Sijvik has considered feudalism to be the result of four different tendencies
 pehali pravriti ek manushya kii duusare manushya ke saath, jo usase ucchtar str kaa tha, vaiyaktik sambandhon kii thi
 From the point of view of their security, they established a relationship with a powerful person who was personal rather than citizenship
 sarankshak or ashrith ek duusare ke saath vaiyaktik sambandhon ke judaav ke kaaran bandhe hue the
 The guardian used to protect his dependents and his strength increased due to the increasing number of dependents
 duusari pravriti manushya ke adhikaar, rajnatik sthaan tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti ke nirdhaaran karne kii pravriti thi
 In feudalism, the political relationship and social status of a person depends on how much land he owned
 teesri pravriti yah thi ki bade-bade bhupati apane pradeshon main raajnneetik satta kaa prayog karne lage
 This change happened gradually
 unhen yah adhikaar prarambh se praapt nahin tha, kendriya satta kii durbalata ke kaaran jaise-jaise unki shakti badi, unhone apane pradesh kii suvyavastha ke liye apane adhikaron ko badhaayaa or un par shashan karne lage
 The fourth trend was the tendency of segregation of social classes, there were two types of people dependent on the king or feudal
 pehle ve jo sainik sevaaon ke badale raja yaa saamanton se bandhe hue the tathaa duusare ve jo unki bhoomi par krishi yaa anya prakaar ke kaary karte the
 Mr
 H
S
 Devius, while determining the nature of communism, analyzed its fundamental tendencies, stating that "under this system, a person was contracted to his lord in terms of security
" vah apane saamanti prabhut se pruthak apni swatantra satta kii ghoshnaa nahin kar saktaa tha
 War was the main principle of the feudal system
 bhai-bhai ke viruddh or putr pita ke viruddh ladane main koi sankoch nahin karata tha
 The condition of the lower class was also very lamentable
 ’’ prastut drushtikon main vyakti kii suraksha kii bhaavana par adhik bal diya gaya he evam saamanti sambandhon tathaa anubandhon kii dridhtaa kii ore sanket kiya gaya he
 The lord from whom the person benefited, had to demonstrate his masterly devotion to him
 vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati thi
 According to Henny S
 Lucus, "the feudal organization had an important place in the feudal organization
 prayek saamanti rajkumaar ke adheen anek vesols hote the, jo use apni salaah tathaa yuddh main sahaayta dene ke liye pratibandhit the
 '' shri lukas ke matanusaar raja or samant donon kii parsparik anubandhta siddh hoti he, jiskaa aadhaar parsparik aadan-pradaan tha
 The feudal provided military aid to the king, was entitled to receive the king's advice by giving critical advice to the king
 bewstor mahoday ne apane kosh main samantvaad ke swaroop main prakaash daalate hue likhaa he ki ‘‘yah ek aisi raajnneetik vyavastha thi jo raja or samant ke bhoomi se sambandhit parsparik sambandhon par adhrith thi tathaa jisamen bhoomi praptakarta dwaara seva or aadar-bhaavana swaamitv, sahaayta, vivaah aadi kii ghatnaayen pramukh thi
 '' chambers insaclopeediya main samantvaad vishyak manyataon main swami bhakthi or ajna-paalan par bal dete hue likhaa gaya he ki ‘‘samantvaad shabd yadhyapi samaaj vyavastha kaa ek prakaar he tathaa mukhya rup se un vyakti sambandhon kii vyakhya karata he jo jameen ke adhikaar or vyaktigat sampati ke aadhaar par ek vyakti kii duusare vyakti ke prati adheenta prakat karte he, tathaapi yah vyaktigat sambandhon or niyamon kii us vishisht paddati kii ore sanket karata he jisamen ek ore suraksha tathaa nirvaah he tathaa duusari ore seva tathaa ajna paalan he
 Thus, the responsibility of the security of the feudal subsistence and feudalism: social and economic development process was on the Lord
 saath hi samant prabhu kii ajnapaalan or seva bhakthi se anubandhit tha
 On non-compliance, the king could only in principle remove him from the land by withdrawing it
 yah keval praarambhik saiddhanthik swaroop tha, kintu vyavhaarik rup main aisa nahin hota tha
 This system changed over time
 bhoomi pehle aaajeevan di jaati thi, baad main anuvanshik adhikaar hone laga
 Then he also provided the land received on the same terms on which he had received it from the king
 is prakaar saamanti vyavastha vanshanugat rup se chalane lagi
 That view can be seen in the context of the confirmation of the aforesaid opinion
 ‘‘saamanti pratha vanshanugat thi
 After the death of Samanta, his successor was made his lord, who used to visit the state court and presented his lord's devotion to the king by offering something
 ’’ Thus by the king giving land to the feudal and by the feudal lords to the chieftains below him became hereditary and a new level of feudalism i

 The main conclusions that can be drawn when analyzing the views of the aforesaid scholars regarding Western feudalism
 kahin to prabhu or samant ke anubandhatmak sambandhon main nihit kanoonee paksh par bal diya gaya he, kahin saamaajik paksh par kahin aarthik paksh par, kintu kuch aise saamaanya tatv bhi he jinka lagbhag sabhi vichaarkon ke maton main sanket miltaa he
 These common elements include land grants by the Lord and service and obedience by the feudal lords
 inke saath europea samantvaad ke swaroop nirdhaaran main krishi daasatv pratha bhi ek mahatvapurn tatv he
 Under this, the peasants were tied to the land and the real owners of the land were the zamindars who worked as the link between the real tenants and the king
 kisaan jameen jotane ke badale saamanton ko upaj or beth-begaar ke rup main lagaan adaa karte the
 The basis of this system was a self-sufficient economy, in which the production of goods was not for sale in the market, but mainly for the use of local farmers and their owners
 ’’ There is no broadly accepted modern definition of feudalism
 shabd samantvaad yaa saamanti vyavastha purv aadhunik kaal main gadha gaya tha or aksar raajnneetik or mat prachaar sandarbh main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 By the mid-20th century, François Louis Ganshoff's Fudilism, 3rd ed
, Became a traditional definition of feudalism
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se jab mark bloch ke fudal sosayadi iskaa samavarti hua jab ise pehali baar angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya, kai madhyakaalin itihaaskaaron ne ek vyapak saamaajik pahalu ko isamen shaamil kiya, isamen jameendaari ke band ko joda, jise kabhi-kabhi "saamanti vyavastha" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Since the 1970s, when Elizabeth A
R
 Brown published The Tyranny of a Construction, with many re-examining the evidence and concluding that feudalism is an incurable term and should be removed from scholarly and academic discussion altogether or at least only for serious merit and warning
 It should be used together
 europea sandarbh ke baahar, samantvaad kii avadharana kaa saamaanya taur par saadrishy ke dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he, shogun ke tahat sabase adhik baar japan main charchaa kii jaati he or kabhi-kabhi madhyayugin or gondarine ithiopia
 haalanki, kuch saadrishy samantvaad ko aage liya gaya he, pracheen misr, parthian samrajya, bhartiya upmahadweep or america ke dakshin ladaai ke pehle vividhta ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 The term feudalism is also used — often inappropriately or even predominantly — those applied to medieval Europe — often inappropriately or blasphemously — in non-western countries where institutions and practices were considered to be the same with medieval Europe
 kuch itihaaskaaron or raajnneetik siddhanton kaa maananaa he ki kai myanon main samantvaad shabd kaa prayog iske vishisht arth ko vanchit karne ke liye kiya gaya he jiske chalate samaaj ko samajhane main is upyogi avadharana ko asweekaar kiya gaya he
 The feudalistic version of François Louis Ganshoff describes the mutual legal and military obligations between major wars and revolves around three important concepts of God, vassal, and ownership
 ek prabhu vyapak arth main ek mahaan sandarbh he jo jameen par kabja karata tha, ek jagirdaar bhagwaan ke dwaara jameen ko apanaataa tha or bhoomi ko jaagir ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In exchange for the use of ownership and protection of the lord, the vassal will provide some form of service to the lord
 vahaan kaarykaal saamanti desh ke kai kismein the, jisamen sainya or gaiyr sainya shaamil the
 The form of feudal feudalism was based on the relationship between the lord and the jagirdar, between the obligations and its authority
 isse pehle ki prabhu kisi ko bhoomi anudaan kar sake, unhen us vyakti ko ek jagirdaar bananaa padataa tha
 It was performed in a ceremonial and symbolic ceremony called the Commendation Ceremony and this oath and tribute act was divided into two parts
 shradhanjali ke dauraan swami or maatahat ek anubandh main aate hai jo jagirdaar ko apane aadesh main prabhu ke liye ladane ke li pravesh karnaa hota tha, haalanki prabhu ko bahari takaton se jagirdaar kii raksha karne kaa vaada ke liye sahamat hona padataa tha
 The Shraddhanjali comes from the Latin word Fidelitas and the lord Earth feudal was fidelity to himself by a vassal
 "shrandhanjali" bhi shapath ke liye sanderbhit karata he or adhik spasht rup se shradhanjali ke dauraan kiye gaye jagirdaar kii patibaddhtaon ko pushti karata he
 Such an oath was followed by tribute
 ek baar prashasti samaaroh puraa kiya gaya, prabhu or jagirdaar ke saath ek saamanti sambandh aapasi dayitvon par ek duusare par sahamat the
 The principal responsibility of the lord was "aid", or vassal for military service
 jo bhi upkaran kaa upyog kar jagirdaar milkiyat se rajasav ke aadhaar par praapt kar saktaa he, maatahat ko kol karne ke liye prabhu kii ore se sainya seva karne ke liye uttar jimmedaar tha
 The primary reason for this security of military help was to enter into the feudal lord's relationship
 iske alaava, jagirdaar ko apane prabhu kii anya daayitv ho sakate hai, jaise court main pravesh, chaahe jaagirgari, saamanti yaa raja ke khud ke court main upasthiti
 yah bhi "salaah" pradaan karne ke jagirdaar shaamil saktaa he, isliye yadi prabhu ek bada faisla vah apni sari jagirdaar ko bulaane or ek concil yojit karenge saamana karnaa padaa he
 This agricultural policy at the jagir level may be a fairly mundane matter, but it also involved the handing down of punishment from criminal to criminal offenses, including capital punishment in some cases
 raja kii saamanti adaalat ke sambandh main, is tarah ke vivechna yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke sawaal shaamil ho sakate hai
 These examples are in Europe depending on location and period of time, customs and feudal practices varied, see examples of feudalism

 Feudalism has traditionally emerged as a result of decentralization of an empire

 The cavalry troops came to encompass a more secure area as well as social, political, judicial and economic areas over their allotted land and a system of hereditary rule over their power

 Only when the centralized power to maintain the existence of infrastructure with European monarchies vanished as feudalism eventually began to yield organized power and new power

 Feudalism became a popular and widely used term in 1748,) thanks to the law of Montescui de l'sprit the ruling class of the Lois power of des souls
 His definition is classic feudalism today is the most widely known and the vassal is also an easy way to understand, simply put, when a lord granted a lord, the vassal provided return service to the military

 Army gaiyr europea: The history of dance is as old as human history
 iskaa kaa pracheenatam granth bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra he
 But its references are also found in the Vedas, which suggests that dance was discovered in prehistoric times
 is kaal main maanav jangalon main swatantra vichrata tha
 Gradually, he began to live in groups in water sources and hunting-dominated areas - his first problem at that time was food - after which he would dance with joy and jump around the fire

 The earliest available evidence in the eyes of history are the sculptures found in the caves in the early caves and the excavations of Harappa and Mohenjodaro - one of which is a bronze sculpture made of bronze - which the scholars reviewing have proved that this dance Is full of emotion

 Bharata Muni made Natya Kala as his goal and for the development of the same, he wrote an extremely useful and fully-practical interpretation of the Natya Shastra - which is such a useful text for the Natya-dance art even after this time

 | From whose west it can be found in the sub-languages of Rajasthani

 It developed mainly in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 mathura, bharatpur,hindun city, dhaulpur, agra, gwalior aadi ilaakon main aaj bhi yah mukhya samvaad kii bhashaa he
 The Brajbhasha exists either in its original form or with slight changes in this one area
 isiliye is ilaake ke ek bade bhaag ko brijanchal yaa brijbhoomi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "brajbhasha" developed in the tradition of Indian Aryan languages is born from the womb of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 jab se gokul vallabh sampradaay kaa centre bana, brajabhasha main krishna vishyak sahitya likhaa jane laga
 With this effect, the dialect of Braj became a literary language

 Due to the influence of district life, many forms of Braj Bhasha are visible to us
 kintu thode se antar ke saath unamem ekarupata kii spasht jhalak hamen dekhne ko milti he
 Brajbhasha has its own metaphorical nature, that is, its singular masculine nouns and adjectives are often immediate; Nouns such as Khurpou, Yamrau, Manjou, etc
 are out of date
 isi prakaar karau, goru, saanwarau aadi visheshan pad aukarant he
 The common past-present singular masculine form of the verb also remains predominantly in Brajbhasha
 yah baat alag he ki uske kuch kshetron main "y" shruti kaa aagam bhi paaya jaataa he
 In the dialect of Tehsil Kol of District Aligarh, the common past tense form is devoid of "Y" Shruti, but "Y" Shruti is definitely found in the Tehsils of District Mathura and South Bulandshahr
 jaise : "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau chhora bolgau"" -
 "" Carau Landa Bolou "" -
 kannauji kii apni prakruti okarant he
 In the forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs, Kannauji follows Okranta where Brajbhasha moves with inertia
 jila aligarh kii jalapadiya brajabhasha main yadi ham kahen ki- ""karau chhora bolau"" to ise hi kannauji main kahenge ki-""kaaro larika bolo
 The future verb kannauji has a tintarupini, but in the Brajbhasha, it is found to be kridantarupini
 yadi ham "ladkaa jayega" or "ladki jaaegi" vaakyon ko kannauji tathaa brajabhasha main roopantarit karke bolen to nimnaankit rup pradaan karenge : In Kannauji - Lurika Jai hai
 bitiyaa jaihai
 In Brajbhasha - Chhora Jaigou
 chhori jaigi
 It is clear from the above examples that the verb in the common future tense form of Brajbhasha changes according to the gender of the subject, while there is a form in Kannauji
 iske atirikt kannauji main avadhi kii bhanti vivruti kii pravriti bhi pai jaati he jiskaa brajabhasha main abhaav he
 Sandhyrithya is often found in the nouns, pronouns, etc
 of Kannauji, but in Brajbhasha, those terms are found in the rheumatic state
 udhaaharan : Kannauji - "" Bu Go ""
 brajabhasha -""bo gayu"" 
 In the pronouns "bo" and "bo", the pronouns of the above sentences describe the nature of the two languages of Sandhirahitya and Sandhi

 lord dalhousie ne aise dattak grahan ko manjuuri dene evam ashrith rajyon ke maamle main dattak kii anupasthiti main apane vivekaanusaar kaarywai karne ke param adhikaron par jor diya
 In practice, this meant the rejection of last-minute adoption and the merger of states with no natural or adoptive successors, as Lord Dalhousie believed that western governance was better than eastern and should be implemented wherever possible
 swaabhaavik yaa dattak na hone ke kaaran satara , jaitpur-sanbhalpur, baghat , udaipur , jhansi , nagpur , karauli or avadh rajyon kaa vilay kar diya gaya
 According to the lapsed principle, the first state merged was Satara

 Lord Dalhousie merged with it, declaring it a dependent state

 The best known example is for remote login on computer systems by application users
 esaech ek esaech sarwar ke saath esaech client aplication ko jodne, client-sarwar architekchar main ek asurakshit network par ek surakshit channel pradaan karata he
 Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH
 protocol vinirdesh do pramukh sanskarnon ke bich antar karata he, jise esaech -1 or esaech -2 kaha jaataa he
 The most visible application of the protocol is for accessing shell accounts on Unix-like operating systems, but it also sees some limited usage on Windows
 2015 main, microsoft ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhavishya main relies main esaech ke liye mul samarthan shaamil hoga
 SSH was designed to replace Telnet and for unprotected remote shell protocols such as Berkeley Ragin, RSP, and rexac protocols
 ve protocol sade text main jaankaree, vishesh rup se password bhejte hai, jo packet vishleshan kaa upyog karke avrodh or prakatikaran ke liye atisamvedansheel hote hai
 The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide the confidentiality and integrity of data over unsecured networks such as the Internet, although leaked files by Edward Snowden indicate that the National Security Agency can sometimes decrypt SSH, allowing them to Allows read content of SSH sessions
 
 On July 6, 2017, the government transparency organization wikileaks confirmed that the US Central Intelligence Agency has developed tools that can be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows or GNU / Linux operating systems, on systems compromised by SSH customers Started SSH connection can be stopped! paribhaasha SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate remote computers and, if necessary, allow the user to authenticate
 esaech kaa upyog karne ke kai tareeke hai; ek network conection ko ancript karne ke liye swachaalit rup se jenerate kiye gaye saarvajanik-nijee kunjee jode kaa upyog karnaa he, or phir log on karne ke liye password pramanikaran kaa upyog karnaa he
 Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without specifying a password
 is paridrishy main, koi bhi vibhinn kunjee kii milan karne vaali jodi utpann kar saktaa he
 The public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key
 jabaki pramanikaran nijee kunjee par aadhaarit he, pramanikaran ke dauraan kunjee ko network ke madhyam se kabhi bhi sthanantarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 SSH only verifies if the same person offering the public access is the owner of the matching private key
 esaech ke sabhi sanskarnon main agyaat saarvajanik kunjee ko satyapit karnaa mahatvapurn he, yani unhen maanya ke rup main sweekaar karne se pehle, saarvajanik kunjee ko pahchaan ke saath sambhddha karen
 Accepting an attacker's public key without verification would authorize an unauthorized attacker as a legitimate user
 mukhya prabandhan On systems such as Unix, the list of authorized public keys is usually stored in the home directory of the user who is allowed to remotely log into the file ~ / 
ssh / authorized_ keys
 yah fil keval esaech dwaara sammanit he yadi yah maalik or root ke alaava kisi bhi cheez se likhane yogya nahin he
 When the public key is present at the remote end and the matching private key is present at the local end, the password does not require typing in the stack
 This password needs to be well)
 haalanki, atirikt suraksha ke liye nijee kunjee ko pasfrez se lock kiya ja saktaa he
 The private key can also be viewed in standard locations, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting
 esaech-kijen upyogita hameshaa jodon main saarvajanik or nijee kunjee banaati he

 Ozone depletion or ozone depletion describes two distinct but related observations; Since the 1970s, there has been a slow but steady decrease in the total amount of ozone in the Earth's stratosphere by about four percent per decade; and there is a greater but seasonal decrease in the ozone of the stratosphere over the Earth's polar regions during the same period is
 baad vaali ghatana ko saamanytah ozon chhidr ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In addition to this well-known stratospheric ozone depletion, there have also been occurrences of tropospheric ozone depletion, which occur near the surface of polar regions during spring

 The transfer of these compounds to the stratosphere occurs after being emitted on the surface

 cfcs and other causative substances are commonly called ozone-depletion substances

 It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences are due to increased skin cancer, plant damage, decreased plankton population in the ocean light area, increased ultraviolet rays due to ozone depletion
 parabegni kirnon ke kaaran ozon kaa hraas hota he
 The three upper forms of oxygen are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms, oxygen gases, and ozone gases
 ozon kaa nirmaan samtap mandal main tab hota he jab oxigen ke anu 240 nm se chote tarang dairdhya ke ek parabangnee photone ko avashoshit karke prakaash apaghatit ho jate hai
 It forms two atoms of oxygen
 ab parmanvik oxigen O2 ke saath sanyojit hokar O3 banaati he
 The ozone molecule absorbs UV light between 310 and 200 nm, causing the ozone to split into an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule
 ab oxigen parmaanu oxigen anu ke saath sanyojit hokar fir se ozon anu banaata he
 This is a continuous process that ends when an oxygen atom "recombines" with an ozone molecule to form two O2 molecules
 o + O3 → 2 O2 The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination
 ozon ko mukt mulak utprerak kii ek sankhya ke dwaara nasht kiya ja saktaa he, isamen se sabase mahatvapurn he hydroxil mulak ,nitric oxide mulak or parmaanu chlorine or bromine 
 All of these have both natural and synthetic sources; at the present time, the majority of OH and NO
 It has a natural origin in the stratosphere, but human activity has resulted in dramatically higher increases in oxygen chlorine and bromine
 cfcl3 + hν → cfcl2 + Cl Now the atoms of chlorine and bromine destroy ozone molecules through several decomposition cycles
 is tarah ke ek chakra ke saralatam udhaaharan main, ek chlorine parmaanu ek ozon anu ke saath, kriya karata he, iske ek oxigen parmaanu ko lekar clo bana letaa he or ek oxigen anu ko mukt kar detaa he
 Chlorine monoxide reacts with another molecule of ozone to form another chlorine atom and two oxygen molecules
 is gas pravastha kriya ke liye rasinic abhikriya nimnanusaar he: Cl + O3 → clo + O2 clo + O3 → Cl + 2 O2 The overall effect causes a decrease in the amount of ozone
 or adhik jatil pranali kii khoj kii gai he, jo samtap mandal ke nichle bhaag main ozon ke vinaash kaa kaaran he
 a single chlorine atom can continuously destroy ozone for two years

 However, they were initially rejected by data quality control algorithms as inappropriate; The ozone hole was detected only in satellite data when the raw data was rechecked for evidence of ozone depletion in situ observations
 jab software jhande ke bina lautaa to ozon chhed ko peeche 1976 main dekha gaya tha
 Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reported that the chemical reaction on the polar stratospheric cloud in the cold Antarctic stratosphere has a vast amount of chlorine, albeit local and seasonal increases that lead to ozone
 Destroys antarctic main dhruviya samtap mandaleey badal keval tabhi banate hai, jab taapmaana -80 degree Cwaka kam ho jaataa he or basant kii praarambhik sthitiyaan hoti hai
 In such situations, cloud ice crystals provide a suitable surface for conversion of inactive chlorine compounds into active chlorine compounds that can easily destroy ozone

 These conditions have created ozone holes in Antarctica

 This measurement was done from the ground level and then from the altitude, in which measurements measured high concentrations of chlorine monoxide in the Antarctic stratosphere

 Meanwhile, measurements of ozone from a worldwide network of ground-based Dobson spectro-photo-meters were analyzed, leading to the conclusion that the ozone layer was indeed eroding at all latitudes outside the tropical region
 in pravritiyon kii upgrah maap ke dwaara pushti kii gai
 As a result, the main halocarbon producing nations prohibited the production of cfcs and halons and related compounds, a process completed in 1996
 1981 ke baad se sanyukt raashtra paryaavaran kaarykram ne ozon riktikaran ke vaigyanik moolyankan par reporton kii ek shrinkhalaa jari kii
 The most recent observations are from 2007 where satellite measurements showed that the ozone layer's hole is healing and is now the smallest in a decade
 ozon riktikaran ko vaigyanik samudaay main adhik gambhir vivaad ke rup main nahin liya jaataa he
 There is a general consensus among atmospheric physicists and drug dealers that scientific understanding has reached a level where the steps taken to control CFC emissions are justified, although the decision is ultimately the same for policy makers

 For example, although increased levels of UVB have increased the risk of melanoma, it is difficult for statistical data to establish that there is a relationship between ozone depletion and increased rates of melanoma

 Although they are often interlinked in the mass media, the relationship between global warming and ozone depletion is not strong
 sampark ke chaar kshetra hai: More or less misconceptions about ozone depletion are summarized here; a more detailed description can be found in the ozone-depletion FAQ

 But atmospheric gases cannot be separated by weight; The forces of air are so strong that they completely mix the gases

 The objections often felt are that it is generally believed that natural sources of chlorine in the troposphere are four to five times larger in magnitude than man-made sources
 jabaki kadavi sachai yah he ki kshobh mandal kii chlorine apraasangik he, keval samtap mandal kii chlorine hi ozon riktikaran kaa kaaran he
 Chlorine produced from sea spray is soluble and thus dissolves in rainwater before reaching the stratosphere

 Even the lower atmosphere contains more chlorine in the form of cfcs and the corresponding haloelkenes, compared to the amount of chlorine in hcl produced by the spray of salts
 samtap mandal main helocarbon adhik prabhavi ho jate hai
 Of these, only one halocarbon, methyl chloride, is the main natural source, accounting for 20 percent of the chlorine in the stratosphere; The remaining 80 percent comes from man-made compounds

 But direct measurements show that cfcs have a lower contribution than chlorine

 According to GMB Dobson the springtime ozone levels ran out, Halley Bay was first measured, surprised to find that it was ~ 320 DU, about 150 DU less than the spring level, it was ~ 450 DU in the Arctic
 haalaanki ye saamaanya jalwiviya maan ke purv ozon chhed the
 According to Dobson, the baseline from which the ozone hole is measured is: the value of the actual ozone hole is in the range 150–100 DU
