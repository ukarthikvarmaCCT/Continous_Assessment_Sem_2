 But there is no mention of them in his compositions

 By this time, public attention was being paid to the corruption prevalent in the Church of Rome
 yatratatra padariyon kii charitrik trutiyaan kii khari aalochana bhi hone lagi thi
 This was a symptom of the great change in European ideology widely influenced by religion which we also see in the Canterbury Tales
 saath hi saath logon kaa dhyaan ab parloukik baton se hatakar bhautik jagat kii samasyaon tathaa dainik jivan ke sukh du:kha kii ore jane laga
 This important trend of European biography is also reflected in the Canterbury Tales and other works of Chaser
 madhyayugin sahitya adhikanshat: kalpanapradhan tha yaa aadhyatm tathaa naitikta kii shiksha dene kaa madhyam maatr
 Chaser gave him an independent existence free from the urges of class and morality
 sahitya rachana main unka uddeshy pradhanat: jivan ke prati apni vyaktigat anubhatiyon kii manoranjak abhivyakti tha
 All these characteristics of Chaser's literature are seen with full blossom in Elizabethan carpet literature almost two hundred years later
 is prakaar ham unhen europea punarjagran kaa aadya angreji kavi kah sakate hai
 As has been said, Chaser started his literary life with a translation of 'romain de la Rose'
 roopak shailo main prem kii vyakhya prastut karanevaala vah kavy bhinn hi nahin apitu paraspar virdohi prakruti ke do francisi kaviyon kii kriti he
 In a dream, a lover tries to pluck the flower of love in a beautiful garden
 praarambhik bhaag prem kaa bada hi shisht, sundar evam prabhavotpadak chitra prastut karata he lekin badwaale bhaag main duusare kaviyon ne striyon tathaa prem ke varnan main dhyangyatmak style apanaai he
 In many of Chaser's compositions, we see the influence of French poetry
 'book aanv dachez' 'house ov fame' tathaa 'parlment ov foules' roopak style main hai
 The events described in the three seem to be seen in a dream
 book ov daches tathaa parlment ov foules main kavi darbari parampara ke anusaar prem kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 We also find such an ideal depiction of love in Ron de la Rose
 'tryles and cracid' kii kahani bokeshio se lee hui he
 This grief confirms the Italian influence over the poetic chaser
 trialas niraash premi he jisaki premika cracid usase alag ho jane par ek anya purush kaa varan kar leti he
 Chaser composed 'legend of Good Women' as she herself stated in the preface, on the queen's complaint that she had 'accused the entire female race of being unreliable by Cressid's character
 is adhuri pusatak main lagbhag das aitihaasik tathaa puranic khyatipraapt naariyon kaa prashansaatmak jeevanavrittant he
 Chaser's final and best composition is 'canterbury Tales'
 angreji samaaj ke vibhinn staron tathaa peshon kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaale lagbhag tees tirthayatri jo cantarbari nagar main tamas baket kii samadhi par apni shradhanjali arpit karne janevaale hai ek sarai main ikattha hote hai
 With the idea that the road should not be tired and be entertained, it is decided at the suggestion of the lord of the inn that every traveler should tell four stories while leaving and two return times
 jisaki kahaniyaan bahumat dwaara sarvottam samajhi jaaen, use sab log milakar usee sarai main acchhee daavat den
 The stories of 'canterbury' are derived from the entire European anecdote literature, not Chaser's own work
 uski melikata yatriyon ke charitra ke sookshm adhyayan main dekhne ko milti he
 Chasar, through his thirty-one passers, with a high degree of characterization in characterization, has also achieved laudable success in presenting a comprehensive portrait of the erstwhile British society
 cantarbari tels main hamen yug ke saamaajik jivan kii jhaanki milti he
 Another feature of Chasar is his unflinching humor
 yahan vah maanavcharitra kii choti badi kamajoriyon par hansataa he, vahiin use manushya maatr se, uski sari trutiyon ke baavjood apaar sahanubhuti bhi he
 For these reasons, his literature remains healthy and even today, a source of renewable inspiration

 Nevertheless, scientists believe that it must have been descendants of the group sometime

 His father's name was Gokul Mishra and mother's name was Uma Devi

 Actually the thing was that Gokul Mishra and Uma Devi had four children continuously and they all died untimely
 santan na jeene ke kaaran gokul mishra ati nirashapurna jivan main rah rahe the
 Uneducated Brahmin Gokul Mishra was naturally loyal to God, but those days he started worshiping his adorable Lord Shankar Lord more and more

 atah ise 'thakkan' kaha jane laga
 After a long time, this Thakkan was named and after the grace and blessings of Baba Vaidyanath, this child was named Vaidyanath Mishra
 " Gokul Mishra's financial condition was not good

 All the land was given on the share and when difficulties arose due to reduced yield, they were tempted to sell the land

" i can go " or sachmuch is andolan ke silsile main apat sthiti se purv hi inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or phir kaaphi samay jail main rahanaa padaa
 In 1948, for the first time, Nagarjuna suffered from an asthma attack and then he suffered from time to time due to lack of proper treatment

 Nagarjuna's real name was Vaidyanath Mishra, but in Hindi literature, he composed compositions in Nagarjuna and Maithili with the traveler surname
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone 'vaideh' upnaam se bhi kavitaayen likhi thim
 In 1936, he took the name 'nagarjuna' in 'vidyalankar Pariven' in Sinhala
 aarambh main unki hindi kavitaayen bhi 'yatri' ke naam se hi chhapi thim
 In fact, after 1941 AD, at the request of some friends, he had decided not to write in Hindi by any name other than Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kii pehali prakashit rachana ek maithili kavita thi jo 1929 i0 main laheriasarai, darbhanga se prakashit 'mithila' naamak patrika main chhapi thi
 His first Hindi work was a poem called 'ram ke Prati' which appeared in the weekly 'vishwabandhu' originating from Lahore in 1934

 Poetry, novels, story, memoirs, travelogues, essays, children's literature - he used pen in all genres

 Nagarjuna's attachment to Bengali language and literature was there from the very beginning
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone apane chaatr jivan main bangla sahitya ko mul bangla main padhanaa shuru kiya
 Originally writing poetry started in February 1978, and by September 1979, about 50 poems had been written

 Some were published in Hindi short magazines including transliteration and translation

 He had done the praises of Jayadev's 'geet Govind' only in 1948 AD

 In 1965, he had praised Vidyapati's hundred songs

 Nagarjuna is a modern poet in the true sense of Indian soil
 unhone azaadi ke pehle or baad main bhi kai bade janandolanon main bhaag liya tha
 Between 1939 and 1942, he was imprisoned in Bihar for leading a demonstration by farmers
 azaadi ke baad lambe samay tak wo patrakarita se bhi jude rahe
 These three qualities are not only found in Nagarjuna's personality, but also in his literature
 niraala ke baad nagarjun akele aise kavi hai, jinhone itane chand, itane dhang, itani sheliyaan or itane kavy roopon kaa istemaal kiya he

 Just as it was said earlier in the context of sentiment, it can be said from the point of view of language that the entire Hindi poetry tradition from Kabir to Dhumil is alive together in Baba's poems
 baba ne chand se bhi parhez nahin kiya, balki uskaa apni kavitaaon main krantikari dhang se istemaal karke dikhaa diya
 One of the basis of the popularity of Baba's poems is the miraculous use of verses performed by him

 Plants found on the planet are divided into two major divisions
 jo paudhe phool tathaa beej nahin utpann karte unako kryptogam kehete hai or jo phool, fal evam beej utpann karte hai ve fenerogam kehalaate hai
 Algae are classified in the Thalophyta class of cryptogam
 ye paudhe nimna shrenee ke hote hai, jinamein parnaharith paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 They are often green in color due to the presence of foliage
 kuch shaiwal aise bhi hote hai jinka rang laal, bhura athwa nila haraa hota he
 Most algae are found in water in ponds, suspended reservoirs and seas
 kuch shaiwal padpon ke tanon par, athwa pathar kii shilaon ke upar, hari parat ke rup main uga karte hai
 Some blue-green algae also grow on the steps of bathrooms, rivers and ponds
 ye ek prakaar kaa chikna padaarth chhodte hai, jiske kaaran bahudhaa log phisalkar gir jaaya karte hai
 Water-born algae are divided into two parts
 kuch mithe pani ke shaiwal hote hai jo talabon, jhiilon, nadiyon aadi main ugte hai, tathaa kuch khaare pani ke, jo samudron main paae jate hai
 Freshwater algae is called Alvana Jalsahaval and saltwater is called sea algae
 pani main ye yaa to swatantra rup main tairte rahete hai, athwa dharaatal par ek vishesh ang dwaara, jise sthapanang kehete hai, sthir rahete hai
 Algae floating in water are either unicellular or multicellular
 rachana ke vichaar se shaiwalon main bahut vibhinnata pai jaati he
 Some are very unicellular, which are visible only by microscope and some are those which are several cm
 Are long
 chlorela, clamedomonas aadi pratham koti main hi aate hai
 Large-grade algae are formulaic, composed of many cells
 sabase bada shaiwal mecrocystis he, jo lakhon koshikao se bana tathaa kai sau foot lanbaa hota he
 There is a nucleus inside each cell, which is surrounded by cytoplasm
 prayek koshika chaaron ore se koshikeey deevaaron se ghiri hoti he
 The dispersed and chloroplasts are scattered in the cytoplasm
 varshi sanrachana ke vichaar se shaiwal kai vibhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 Some are unicellular and itinerant in which the flagella is present, such as in Euglina
 kuch jatiyon ke anek eckoshik milakar jhund banaate hai or kashabhika ke sahare ek jagah se duusari jagah bhraman karte hai, jaise pludonraina, walwoox aadi
 Some are rounded, such as chlorococcum, some formulas, such as Spirozaera and Eulox
 kuch main dandavat rup tathaa sidhaa rup ek saath hota he
 These are classified as Heterotricus such as Fraschiella
 is shaiwal main do vibhaag hote hai, ek to jameen main dharaatal ke samanaantar sutaravat ansh hote he, jise bhushayi bhaag kehete hai
 Out of these parts, directly emanating sutrum parts are produced, which are called erect systems
 aise hi shaiwalon se prithvi par ke bade bade padpon ke pradurbhaav kaa hona samajha jaataa he
 Nutritional problems in algae are solved automatically
 inamen parnaharith vidyaman rahata he, isliye prakashasanshlesh kii vidhi se ye apana bhojan swayan bana lete hai
 Therefore, such plants are called autotrophs
 shaiwalon main janan kai prakaar se hota he
 Some themselves are divided and continue to grow
 yah kriya adhiktar koshika vibhaajan kii reeti se hoti he
 Unicellular algae reproduce in this manner
 bade koti ke shaiwalon main alangik tathaa langik donon prakaar ke janan hote hai
 Asexual reproduction can occur in many ways
 kuch shaiwalon main chalabijaanuon kii utpatti hoti he
 Chalban is a body of bare organisms, which can move from place to place with the help of flagella
 chalabijanu pani ke shaiwalon main paidaa hote hai
 They sprout automatically and form new algae
 jab pani kii maatra kam hone lagati he, athwa vipareet vaataavaran aa padataa he, to achalbijanu banate hai, jo mote aavaran se chaaron ore ghire rahete hai
 They do not have flagella
 kuch shaiwalon main alangik janan nishcesht bijaanuon dwaara hota he
 The way they are formed is that any algae cell becomes flattened and is covered with a thick folded covering
 aisi dasha to keval asangat paristhiti main hi dekhi jaati he, visheshkar jab shushk or garm vaataavaran ho jaataa he
 When favorable environment is attained, they begin to germinate and the upper, thick folded wall slowly breaks down and newborn algae form
 kuch shaiwal pani ke kinare pade rahete hai
 When there is an opposite environment, the division of these cells continues, but they do not separate, but the cell wall becomes thick and many cells are filled inside it
 jab anukool vaataavaran aata he, tab ye ankurit hokar nayaa shaiwal banaati hai
 Such condition is called palamella stage
 langik janan do vibhinn prakaar kii koshikaon ke sanyog se hota he
 These cells are called gametes
 ye yugmak yugmakadhaniyon main paidaa hote hai
 a combination of both types of gametes makes a zygote
 yugmakon ke jode, jisamen se ek pitrupaksh kaa tathaa doosraa matrupaksh kaa hota he, teen prakaar ke hote hai : Both types of gametes have the same composition and size in the time pair
 inke dwaara honevaale janan ko samayugmaki janan kii sangya dete hai
 The two connected gametes are one way of looking and are rotated by the flagellum, but one is small and the other is large
 chote yugmak ko laghuyugmak tathaa bade kaa guruyugmak kehete hai
 These gametes are asymmetrical and such reproduction is called as unpaired generation
 donon prakaar ke yugmak bhinn aakaar ke hote hai
 One is small and moving and the other is large and stable
 pratham kotiwale ko punyugmakash tathaa duusare ko stri yugmak yaa anda kehete hai
 This type of reproduction is called heterozygous reproduction
 is prakaar kaa janan bahudhaa bade shaiwalon main hota he or ise vishamyugmakata kehete hai
 As a result of the action of combination, zygote and pair are formed
 ye ankurit hote hai
 At the time of germination, they form clusters which sprout and give rise to new algae
 samayugmaki saadhaaran koti kaa tathaa vishamyugmaki ucch koti kaa janan samajha gaya he
 It has been done in different departments by the opinion of different scientists

 pichley 20 varshon se krishi main shaiwal ke upyog par anek mahatvapurn baaten sthir kii gai he
 Research in laboratories has shown that algae stabilize nitrogen by taking nitrogen from the air, transforming it into compounds of nitrogen in the soil
 paudhon ke liye nitrogen atyadhik upyogi poshak tatv he
 Due to this the importance of algae has increased
 yah nitrogen ko sthir karke mitti kii urvara shakti ko badhaata he or fasal main vruddhi karata he
 From the research of many scientists in India, it has been found that the growth of nitrogen by algae, often from 20 to 30 pounds per acre, does not stabilize the soil
 keval mixophisii jati ke shaiwal hi is kaary main praveen hai
 Among them, Nostak, Toulipox, Aulsora fertilissima and Annabina etc
 have proved to be the founders of the most importance
 katak ke dhamasnusandhan centre ke anusandhan se yah gyaat hua he ki toliponos sabase adhik nitrogen sthapit karata he
 Analysis of paddy plants has also revealed that algae composted plants absorb nitrogen more than soil
 katak anusandhan centre ne pariksha karke dekha he ki kheton main shaiwal ko kritrim rup se upjane par dhan kii fasal main 800 pound tak kii vruddhi hui
 a very small amount of nitrogen fixing algae was mixed with sand, poured into the fields and irrigated
 isse shaiwal kii vruddhi hui, nitrogen adhik maatra main mitti main praapt hua tathaa dhan kii fasal main bhi vruddhi hui
 The author's research has also revealed that algae cause an increase of about 24 pounds of phosphate on the top surface of the soil
 saath saath 1,000 pound jaev carbon bhi bad jaataa he, jisase mitti kii sanrachana or urvara shakti main unnati hoti he
 Industrial use of algae has been carried out in various directions

 There they would work as well as meet socialists at night and study socialism
 vahaan se lautakar kuch samay tak sena main kaary kiya
 Thereafter, after returning home, he continued to participate in the socialist movement and also joined journalism
 1912 tak ve samaajawaadee dal ke mukhpatr "awanti" ke sampadak ban gaye
 As the First World War broke out in 1914, Mussolini, like the Socialists, refused to believe that Italy should remain impartial
 ve chaahate the ki italy britain or france ke paksh main ladaai main utre
 Due to this he had to step down from the post of editor of "awanti" and was removed from the party
 1919 ke 23 march ko musolini ne apane dhang se raajnneeti main ek nae sanghathan ko janm diya
 The name of this group was "fasi-the-kambattimanti"
 isamen unhone unheen logon ko liya jo 1914 main unke vichaar ke the

 Additionally, two verses are in the preface and one verse is in the epilogue as Falashruti

 Money cannot be taken for free software
 yadi software ke liye paisa nahin milegaa to kaam kaise chalegaa| tab vyapaaree varg ko aisa laga ki free software bekaar he or unhone ise apane se bahut dur rakhaa
 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows
 unhone ‘the Road Ahead’ pustak likhi he
 This book is also very good

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part
 ham is samay ek doraahe par khadey hai or ek aisi sthiti main hai ki soochna pradyogiki ko nayaa mode de sakate hai
