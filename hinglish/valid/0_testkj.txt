 In defense of the beginner of this phrase, Zuma is actually mentioned 471 times in the entire transcript of the judgment against Shack, the word "corrupt" or "corruption" has been used 54 times and contains 12 sentences containing Both the words "corrupt" and "zuma" are used together

 The case was withdrawn from the Pietermaritzburg High Court after the prosecution's application for adjournment was dismissed

 On 4 August 2008, Zuma appeared in court
 On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson stated that the corruption charges against Zuma were illegal on procedural grounds because the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions did not give Zuma the opportunity to submit a representation before deciding to press charges and pay the state legal
 Instructed to do
 nikholson ne yah bhi kaha ki, unka maananaa tha ki raajnneetik hastkshep ne zuma ke khilaaf punah aarope daayar karne ke nirnay main ek bhoomika nibhaai, yadhyapi unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kyon unhone zuma par lage aaropon ko avaidh bataaya
 Nikholson also emphasized that his decision was not related to Zuma's guilt or guilt, but was only on a procedural basis
 vibhinn media reporton ne yah galat soochna di ki zuma ke khilaaf aarope khaarij kar die gaye hai
 This was not the case
 NDPP, zuma par punah aarope lagane main sakasham bana hua tha, haalanki, sirf ek hi baar unhen NDPP ke samaksh abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya wo bhi NDPP ke aisa karne ke nirnay ke aadhaar par
 nirnay ke 47 paragraph main, nyaayadhish nikholson ne likhaa, The compulsion to listen to representations is a part of the principle of audi alteram partem
 aavashyaktaa yah he ki ek vyakti jo ho saktaa he ki ek nirnay ke kaaran pratikul rup se prabhavit ho rahaa he, use ek anukool parinaam praapt karne kii drushti se ek abhyavedan prastut karne kaa avasar diya janaa chahie
 prabhavit vyakti ko aamtaur par us maamle ke saar yaa tatwon ke vishay main suchit kiya janaa chahie, jis par use jawaab dena he
 The court determined that the ndpp's failure to follow the procedure outlined in section 179 of the constitution invalidated the ndpp's decision to re-charge Zuma
 nyaayadhish nikholson ne paaya ki zuma par lagaae gaye aaropon ke samay par vibhinn anumaan lagaae ja sakate hai jo is nishkarsh kii pushti karata he ki isamen sarkaar kii kaaryakari shakha dwaara raajnneetik hastkshep kaa kuch ansh shaamil he
 Judge Nicholson writes in paragraph 210 of his decision, raashtrapati kii polokavane main hui raajnneetik haar ke baad, 28 disambar 2007 ko shriman emse dwaara chalaae gaye abhiyog kaa samay, sabase adhik durbhagyapurna tha
 This aspect, combined with the incident of Mr
 Piccoli who should have been independent and immune to the suspension of executive intervention, convinced me that the most true conclusion is that the damaging political influence continues
 nirnay ke anuchhed 220 main nyaayadhish nikholson ne aage likhaa he, There is a worrying structure in the behaviors i have set out above signs of political interference, pressure or influence
 yah mantri maduna dwaara shri ngakuka ko die gaye "raajnneetik netritv" se shuru hua, jab unhone aavedak par mukadmaa chalaane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa aparaadh tha unka thint pratinidhiyon se vaarta karnaa or milanaa or anya maamle jiskaa ullekh main kar chukaa hum
 sakshya ke niyam die jane ke kaaran adaalat is nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya he jo us paksh ke hit ke liye sabase kam anukool he jinke paas tathyon kaa vishesh gyaan he
 This is certainly more prevalent than the political interference of "clues or suggestions" mentioned in the Yengeni case
 yah ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he ki is tarah kii prakriya, nae dakshin africa main ghatit hui or isane rangabhed shashan ke antargat vinaash ko prerit kiya
 " sunwaayee se pehle zuma ke samarthakon kii ore se dakshin africa nyaaypalika kii khub aalochana kii gai
 In this context, the irony was that the South African judiciary was found in favor of Zuma for the third time, including acquittal of the rape charges leveled against him
 NDPP ne jald hi is nirnay ke khilaaf apil karne ke apane iraade kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court to appeal the decision of Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson: mujhase sambandhit aise doorgaami "afasosjanak, pariwadaatmak or pratikul" nishkarsh nikalnaa or zuma maamle ke un nishkarshon ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa or ninda karnaa adaalat ke liye anuchit tha
 My absolute request is that the defense of the interests of justice is in improving the matter
 in pratikul nishkarshon ne mere ANC party dwaara meraa naam waapas liye jane ko falit kiya - yah ek aisa nivedan tha jise maine pichley 52 varshon se ANC kaa ek patibaddh or vafaadaar sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 i am afraid that if not rectified, i may face further adverse effects
 rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke pravaktaa, talaali talaali, ne 23 sitambar ko pretoria se phone dwaara kaha, "hame kagajaat mil gaya he
 It is under consideration
 " On 12 January 2009, Blomfontein's Supreme Court of Appeal rejected the decision for this appeal
 up nyaayadhish adhyaksh lui harms ko apil ke do pahaluon par nirnay lenaa padaa
 pehla pahalu tha ki kya zuma ko is baat kaa adhikaar tha ki ve NPA ke samaksh abhyavedan karne ke liye aamantrit kiye jaayen wo bhi unke khilaaf rishwat or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko waapas liye jane kaa nirnay liye jane se pehle
 doosraa pahalu yah tha ki kya nyaayadhish nikholson zuma par ilzaam lagaae jane ke NPA ke nirnay ke sandarbh main tatkaaleen raashtrapati thabo mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ko samajhane main sahi the
 On the question of inviting representations during the review of the npa's decision, Harms DP found that the interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution given by Nicholson was incorrect because the NPA had no such obligation and was therefore free to accuse Zuma, He has done
 nikholson ke mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ke vishay main die gaye tark ke sawaal par, harms deepi ne paaya ki "nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he"
 On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority, in light of the new revelation of serious flaws in the prosecution, withdrew all charges against Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thint
 yah rahasyodghatan phone vaarta ke tukdon ke rup main the jo yah dikhaate the ki scorpian ke adhyaksh, lionard maikaarthi or saarvajanik abhiyojan ke purv rashtriya nideshak, bulilani ngakuka ne zuma par abhiyog chalaae jane ke samay ko lekar saazish rachi thi, jo sambhavyatah zuma ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi, raashtrapati thabo mabek ke raajnneetik laabh ke liye tha
 The withdrawal of the charge was announced by the acting president of the NPA, Mokothedi Empshe, who insisted that the withdrawal of the charges was due to abuses that made the legal process "tainted" and not equal to acquittal
 NPA kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad, haalanki, kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon ne suchit kiya ki aaropon ko waapas liye jane kii sthiti main ve apane se kanoonee karrwai par vichaar karenge
 The Democratic Alliance later filed an appeal for a judicial review of the npa's decision, with reference to his party leader Helen Zilla clarifying that Ampshey "did not make decisions based on the law, but was bound by political pressure" 
 On 9 June 2009, the day of hearing of the case was fixed
 jabaki zuma ne apni pratikriya ko kalochit rup se daayar kiya, ampshe ne maamle kii sunwaayee main deree kii, jisamen unhone NPA kii pratikriya ko pesh karne ke liye do vistaaran kaa anurodh kiya
 NPA spokesman Muthunzi Mahaga said they would not file papers because there are "outstanding cases" that are yet to be resolved
 democratic elliance party pramukh jile ne tark diya ki zuma kii pratikriya moulik rup se galat he or "unamem koi sanvaidhanik aadhaar nahin hai"
 jabaki kanoonee chunautiyaan jari rahi, june 2009 ko hue ek surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki, aadhe se zyada dakshin africa yah maanate hai ki raashtrapati jacob zuma acha kaam kar rahe hai
 The poll conducted by TNS Research Studies in late June 2009 showed that Zuma's approval level had steadily improved
 surveykshan main shaamil logon main se lagbhag 57% ne kaha ki ve sochate hai ki zuma ek sakasham netaa hai - yah taadaad april 2009 main raashtrapati ke naam udghaatan ke mukaable 3% tak adhik thi
 In November 2008, just a few months after former President Thabo Mbeki was withdrawn and Zuma faced corruption charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him
 disambar 2005 main, zuma par apane forest toun, johanesburg vaale ghar main ek 31 varshiya mahila kaa balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 The alleged victim belonged to an important ANC family, was the daughter of a close associate of Zuma's struggle days and was an AIDS activist believed to be HIV positive
 zuma ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya or daawa kiya ki yah yon sambandh aapasi sahmati se bana tha
 Even before the charges were filed, as rumors about rape allegations erupted in November, Zuma's political prospects seemed to be on the decline
 unke ucch str ke adhikansh raajnneetik samarthakon ne in nae aaropon ke sandarbh main us tarah se pratikriya nahin di jis tarah se unhone bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf di thi
 In a hearing before the rape trial, crowds of thousands of his supporters gathered before the court, while small anti-rape groups demonstrated for the alleged rape victim
 jaise kii zuma ne mukademe ke dauraan kiya, ve bheed ke saath lethu masini vami gaate rahe or ANC yuva lig or balm panthi party yuva lig ke pravaktaa ne zuma ke samarthan main baat kii
 As the rape trial progressed, reports surfaced that the South African left wing contingent differed on how to address Zuma's case and the sacp's relationship with him
 Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while other members of the SACP were skeptical about the value of performing for a particular person against important principles of governance
 kuch purv samarthakon ke dalbadal lene ke baavjood, kai zuma samarthakon ne adaalat ke baahar pradarshan karnaa jari rakhaa, abhiyokta kii akhandta or naitikta par nirantar pratighaat karne, abhiyokta ke ek kareebi dost par apshabd oochhaalane or abhiyokta samaj kar kisi anya mahila par pathar phenkane jaise krityon ne balaatkaar virdohi samoohon kii aalochana ko badhaava diya
 Zuma's defense team presented evidence relating to the victim's sexual past and insisted that the physical relationship was with both consent

 The lawsuit also sparked a political controversy when Zuma, who at the time was heading the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman accused of rape, knowing that Also that she was HIV positive
 unhone adaalat main yah kaha ki "HIV sankraman ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye" uske turant baad unhone snaan kar liya
 The statement was condemned by the judge, health experts and AIDS activists

 On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma innocent and Zuma agreed that the sexual act surrounded by the questions was consensual
 nyaayadhish vine dar marave ne abhiyokta ko adaalat main jhooth bolne ke liye buree tarah se fatkaaraa, lekin zuma ko bhi apni laaparvaahee ke liye doshi tehraaya
 When his rape case ended, many South Africans wondered how to fill the gaps created by Zuma's trial in his political system
 An analysis by Mel & Guardian described these incidents as particularly disturbing: phir bhi, balaatkaar mukademe ke khatm ho jane ke baad, bijness de kii krima brown ne di gargian ko bataaya "jacob zuma waapas aa gaye hai
 This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership
 ab zuma waapas luthuli house kii ore agrasar hai
 ] They will demand to be reinstated back to the post of vice president and others will find it difficult to block their way 


 This is a major victory for Zuma's political career
 " The prospect of Zuma's return as a contender for the presidency became a cause for concern for international investors
 ek swatantra vishleshak ne suzav diya, "haalia surveykshanon ke anusaar, zuma or unke mashin gan chalaanevaale kafile ko union building kii ore badate hue dekhnaa mukhyatah madhyam varg or vyapaariyon ko hatotsahit karne vaala he

 kai antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ne iskaa swaagat ek spasht sanket ke rup main kiya ki dakshin africa sarkaar apane bhitari rankon se bhrashtachar ko ukhaad fankne ke liye samarpit he
 On the other hand, some people in South Africa highlighted the fact that Zuma and Mbeki represent two different constituencies in the African National Congress
 kuch vampanthi samarthakon ne daawa kiya ki mabek or unka bazaar-unmukhi paksh ANC main apana varchasv kaayam rakhane ke uddheshy se zuma ko baahar nikalne kii sajeesh kar rahaa hai

 On the next court date in November, thousands of Zuma supporters gathered to support him; Zuma addressed the Durban crowd in the Zulu language and appealed to them to maintain the unity of the party and sang the song Lethu Machines Vami of the apartheid struggle, which literally translates to the words "meri machine me la" It is understood in the context of machine guns
 oktober main ANC yuva lig ke liye ek daure main desh main kisi anya jagah zuma ne ek badi bheed kii vaahvahee jiti
 While at least a partial of his political power is based on inter-party relations, one analyst argued that the loyalty of his supporters was rooted in the Zulu approach to loyalty and mutual aid

 Zuma's stance on Zimbabwe was mixed
 2006 main german patrika der spigel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone mugabe ke prati bhaavnaatmak sahanubhuti vyakt karte hue kaha ki "europea aksar is tathy kii andekhi karte hai ki mugabe africaiyon ke bich bahut lokapriy hai
 In his eyes, he got the blacks back to their country after centuries of colonialism
 "he added that" people love them, so how can we condemn them? Many in Africa believe that there is a racist aspect in the criticism of Mugabe by Europeans and Americans

 Western countries have already become dissatisfied due to the unfortunate death of some Europeans in Zimbabwe
 " However, until December 2007, he was more forthright in criticizing the leadership of Zimbabwe, under which he defined his policies in more contrast with Mbeki's policies: yah or bhi dukhad he ki anya vishwa ke anya netaaon jinhonen daman dekha he yah bahaanaa karte hai ki aisa kabhi hua hi nahin, yaa yah atishyoktipurna he
 When history finally discusses the dictators, then those who stand by the side and see the spectacle should also bear the consequences
 a shameful quality of the modern world is to look back on injustice and ignore the difficulties of others

 jis prakaar lok prashasan kii paribhaasha main kai drushtikon dikhaai dete hai, usee prakaar isaki prakruti ke vishay main bhi do tarah ke drushtikon hai
 First, the broader view is called 'complete thought' or 'integrated thought' and the second narrow approach is called 'managerial thought'
 is vichaar ke samarthakon ke matanusaar, lok prashasan lokaneeti ko lagu karne or us kii purti ke liye prayog kii gai gatividhiyon kaa yoga he
 In this way administration is the sum of the actions to be performed to achieve a certain goal, whether they are actions, managerial or technical
 vistrut rup se sarkaar kii sabhi gatividhiyaan chaahe ve karypalika ho tathaa chaahe vidhayak athwa nyaayik, lok prashasan main shaamil hai
 LD Authors such as Hahnite, Wilson, Deimak, and Fiffner supported the idea
 el
di
 hnite ne spasht shabdon main kaha he, ”lok prashasan kaa sambandh un sabhi kaaryon se he jin kaa prayojan saarvajanik niti ko puraa karnaa yaa use kriyanvit karnaa hota he
 "in this definition, special action comes from all areas related to governance, such as letter distribution, sale of public lands, negotiation of any treaty, compensation to the injured employee, preventing a child sick with infectious disease from contact with other persons
" , Removal of garbage from public parks, construction of plutonium and compliance with use of atomic power
 “ Adopting this approach, Fiffner said, "public administration means doing the work of the government whether it is operating an x-ray machine in a health laboratory or making coins in mint
" lok prashasan se taatpary he logon ke prayaason main samanvay sthapit karke kaary ko sampann karnaa taaki ve milakar kaary kar saken athwa apane nishchit kaaryon ko puraa kar sake
 " is vichaar ke samarthak keval unheen logon ke kaaryon ko prashasan maanate hai jo kisi udhyam sambandhi kaaryon ko puraa karte hai
 The goal of managerial work is to integrate, control and coordinate all the activities of the enterprise, making all the activities look like a coordinated effort
 simon, smithberg tathaa thomson is drushtikon ke samarthak hai
 According to him, the term administration is used in its narrower sense to reveal the ideals of conduct that are found to be the same in many types of support groups, and are neither based on the specific goal that they achieve So they are cooperating and not dependent on the particular technical practices used for those goals
 “ is vichaar kaa paksh lete hue luther gulik ne bhi likhaa he, ”prashasan kaa sambandh kaary puraa kiye jane or nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii paripurti se he
 "in other words, supporters of this idea restrict public administration to the activities of the executive branch only
 in donon vichaaron main kai pahaluon se bhinnata pai jaati he
 Integrated thought involves the work of all persons related to administration, while managerial thought restricts administration to the functions of only a few above persons
 duusare shabdon main ekikrut drushtikon main prabandhkeey, takneekee tathaa gaiyr-takneekee sab prakaar kii gatividhiyaan shaamil hai jab ki prabandhkeey drushtikon apane aap ko ek sanghathan ke prabandhkeey kaaryon tak hi simit rakhata he
 According to the unified approach, public administration is related to the three branches of government - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary
 parantu prabandhkeey drushtikon ke anusaar lok prashasan kaa sambandh keval karypalika kaaryon se he
 Neither of these two ideas can be completely ignored
 prashasan kaa thik arth to us prasang par nirbhar karata he jis sandarbh main shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dimock and Koening have tried to summarize the nature of public administration keeping in mind all aspects
 unke anusaar, The idea of the field of public administration can be divided into two parts - vilobi ke anusaar, lok prashasan ke kshetra kaa sambandh in baton se he- In the light of the above ideas, we can describe the field of public administration as follows- samuhik sambandhon kaa aadhaar kya he tathaa vyakti un aavashyaktaaon kii purti kis prakaar kar paata he, yah vichaarneey vishay lok prashasan kaa he
 Which elements have a major influence on administrative decisions, we study it in public administration
 lok prashasan ke adhyayan-kshetra ke bare main vichaarkon main bada bhed he
 Basically the differences are with these questions whether public administration is only a managerial part of government work or overall study of all the organs of government? Is public administration the implementation of government policies or does it also play an effective role in policy making
 lok prashasan kala he yaa vigyaan - is vishay par vidwaanon main matbhed he
 Luther, Gulick, Urvik, Woodrow Wilson, etc
 are prominent among the thinkers who consider public administration as science
 inke anusaar lokprashasan kaa adhyayan krambaddh tareeke se kiya jaataa he jisame pariklpana, tathyon kaa sangrah, tathyon kii pushti, tathyon kaa vargeekaran, tulanaatmak adhyayan, vishleshan aadi vaigyanik tareeko kaa upyog kar ek nishchit nishkarsh par pahunchaa jaataa he
 Thus the general rule is established only by using these scientific methods in public administration
 vigyaan kii bhanti hi lok prashasan main kuch sarvamaanya siddhanth bhi he jaise- aadesh kii ekta, niyantran kshetra, tailor kaa vaigyanik prabandh kaa siddhanth aadi
 Like science, new experiments are also done in public administration to remove the existing defects in public administration and to develop administrative techniques
 isi ke saath lok prashasan main takneekee gyaan kii bhi pradhanta he
 Like a scientist, a skilled administrator must also be equipped with technical knowledge so that he can discharge his duties efficiently
 in artho main lokprashasan ko vigyaan mana ja saktaa he
 Second and thinkers like Prof
 White, Dr
 M
P
 Sharma, Artway Tid put public administration in the category of art
 unke anusaar lokprashasan kaa vikaas bhi kala kii bhaanti dhire-dhire kramik rup se hua he
 From this point of view public administration is also an art in which general rules have been established by systematic study of different eras
 ek kalakaar ke samaan hi prashaasak bhi anubhav env abhyaas ke aadhaar par hi safal or siddh ho saktaa he
 Just as the success of art is based on certain rules, similarly in public administration, in the absence of rules, there is a possibility of the administrators' arbitrary and distorted nature of administration
 vikasshil hone ke kaaran jis prakaar kala ke siddhanton main parivartan hota rahata he thik usee prakaar lokprashasan main bhi vikaas kii prakriya nirtanr chalati rahati he or nae niyam banate rahete he
 Public administration is accepted as an art due to the presence of all the above mentioned traits of art

 Tulu is a popular language in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts located in the western side of Karnataka state of India and in some parts of North Kerala
 pehle tulu brahman vaidic or sanskrit sahitya likhane ke liye 'tiglri' naamak lipi ko upyog karte the
 But very little literature is found in Tulu language
 par aaj is lipi ko jaananevaale bahut kam hai
 The old Tigallari script closely resembles the Malayalam script
 ab tulu likhane ke liye kannada lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This Panch is one of the Dravid languages
 dakshin kannada or udupi jilon kii adhikansh logon kii maatrubhaasha tulu he
 Hence, both these districts are collectively known as Tulunadu
 kerala ke kasargod jile main bhi bahut log tulu bhashaa bolte hai
 a Brahmin from Udupi district has composed a book named 'bhagavata' using the Tigari script
 kavi mandaar keshav bhat ne 'mandaar ramayana' naam kaa ek aadhunik mahakavy likhaa he
 According to linguists, there are four major forms or styles of tulu: shivalli - tulu brahmanon kii bolanewaali style
 Jains - The speaking style of Jains from the northern parts of Tulunadu
 saamaanya - tulunadu ke zyaadaatar logon kii bolanewaali style
 This style is used in commerce, art, entertainment
 adivasee - adivasee logon kii bolanewaali style
 According to some old Malayalam works, the area which spread from the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod to Gokarna in Uttara Kannada was known as Tulunadu
 par aaj kaa tulunadu dakshin kannada or udupi jilon tak hi simit he
 Nevertheless, many people who speak Tulu are found in Kasaragod in Kerala and Mumbai and Thana in Maharashtra
 vartmaan samay main tulubhashik sahitya likhane ke kaary main kannada lipi kaa upyog hota he
 Semiconductor devices are electronic components that are made using the properties of semiconductor materials
 silicon, jarmenium or gallium arsenid mukhya ardhchaalak padaarth hai
 In most applications, semiconductor devices are now being used at all locations where thermodynamic devices were previously used
 ardhchaalak yuktiyaan, thos avasthaa main electranik sanchalan par aadhaarit hai jabaki tub yuktiyaan uccha nirvaat yaa gasiy avasthaa main ushmyanon ke chaalan par aadhaarit thim
 There are mainly two types of semiconductor devices based on construction - stand alone devices and integrated circuits
 ardhchaalak padaarthon kaa sabase mahatvapurn aakarshan he ke inhe dooshit kar inke vyavhaar ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 This process of corruption is called doping
 ardhchalkon ke chaalan ko vaidyut kshetra, roshni, ooshmaa, yahan tak dabaav se bhi niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, semiconductors are used to make sensors
 vidyutdhara kaa pravaah hota he "mukt" electron or "chhidron" ke dwaara, jinhe aavesh vaahak bhi kehete he
 a semiconductor such as silicon is doped by adding elements such as phosphorus or boron, greatly increasing the amount of free electrons or holes available in the semiconductor
 jab dooshit ardhchaalak main adhiksham chhidr hoten hai to use P-prakaar ardhchaalak kehate hai or jab adhiksham electron hoten hai to use N-prakaar ardhchaalak kehate hai, jahaan p yaa n dhanatmak prabhaar yaa rinatmak prabhaar ke aavesh vaahakon kaa suchak hai
 The production of semiconductors and their doping process takes place in a very controlled environment called fab
 P-prakaar or N-prakaar ke ardhchalkon ke bich ke jod ko P-N jod kehete hai
 a diode made of PN pair has a period of bonding between the P-type and N-type semiconductors, which does not allow the flow of current from n to P, but from p to N
 jab diod agr abhinath hota he, jahaan p kii taraf ucchtar vaidyut sanchaalan shakti hoti he, tab vidyutdhara pravaah hota he
 Conversely, the current flowing in the inverted diode is equal to no
 ardhchaalak par roshni daalane se electron-chhidr ke jode batch jaate hai, jisase chaalakata batch jaati he
 Photo diodes were created by taking advantage of this phenomenon
 sanyojit ardhchaalak diodon se prakaash paidaa kii ja sakati he, jaise prakaash utsarjak diod or leisure diod main
 The major types of transistors, dipole pair transistors, are formed in two pn pairs, npn or pnp aggregates
 madhya khand, jise "base" bhi kaha jaataa he, sankeern hota he
 Other sections are called emitters and collectors
 base or utsarjak ke bich aavesh ke antaravahit karne se base-samahrta ke gunaswabhaav me antar aa jaataa he, tatah, base-samahrta ke agr abhinath hone ke baavjood dhara pravaah hota he
 Many times more flow is found between the base-collector than the ratio of the small flow change of the base-emitter
 ek anya tarah kaa transister he kshetra prabhaav transister - is ardhchaalak ke chaalakata ko vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav se badhaaya-ghataya jaataa he
 The amount of electrons and or holes free from the influence of the electric field increases, thus increasing the conductivity
 agar is vidyut kshetra ko lagane ke liye uttkram abhinath P-N jod kaa prayog karen, to use jod kshetra prabhaav transister kehate hai; agar is vidyut kshetra ko lagane ke liye dhaatu oxide kaa prayog karaten hai, to banataa he dhaatu oxide ardhchaalak kshetra prabhaav transister Today, phosphate is the most important semiconductor device
 vidyut kshetra ko utpann karne kaa kaam "get" vidyudagr karti he, jisase "sorce" or "drain" ke bich ke channel ke chaalakata kaa niyantran hota he
 There are two types of this channel, P-channel or N-channel
 haalanki dhaatu se mosphate ko uskaa naam mila, par aaj poli silicon ko upyogit kiya jaataa he
 Silicon is most commonly used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices
 anya padaarthon kii tulana main iske mukhya gun hai kachche maal kii kam laagat, nirmaan me aasaani or vyapak taapmaana parichaalan seemaa
 Currently, the first silicon for manufacturing semiconductor devices is made by making a boule of at least 300mm width, so that it can be made of such a wide wafer
 pehle jarmenium kaa prayog vyapak tha, kintu iske ushn atisamvedansheeltaa ke karan silicon ne isaki jagah le lee he
 Today, kudhatu of germanium and silicon is often used in the manufacture of superfluous devices; IBM is a major producer of such devices
 gallium arsenid kaa prayog bhi vyapak he ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan main, magar is padaarth ke chode baul nahi ban pate, jiske kaaran silicon kii tulana main gallium arsenid se ardhchaalak yuktiyon ko bananaa mehangaa pasta he
 Other substances that are either less widespread, or are being researched: tark dwaar ke banane main transister moolbhoot ang hai
 PS, logic gates are the basic construction components of a digital path
 microprocesar jaise ankiy parirpathon main transister switch kii bhaanti kaam karte hai
 For example, applying electric conductive power to the mossfet determines whether the switch closes or opens
 jin transistaron kaa prayog anuroop paripathon main hota he, vahaan inkaa prayojan switch ke rup me naa ho kar, pravardhan or dolan ke liye hota he
 In these, both investment and output correspond
 power ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog ucch volt yaa dhara ke prakalan me hota he
 Computer has to use power semiconductor devices in SMPS or motor drive etc
 
 Power digital circuits, also known as "smart" power devices, employ IC technologies at high power
 ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke avyav abhigyapak alag-alag nirmaataa alag-alag tarah se karte hai
 However, after several attempts, some standards are in vogue, such as JEDEC JESD370B in USA, Pro Electron in Europe and JIS in Japan
 ardhchalkon kaa prayog electronica ke kshetra main transister ke khoj ke pehle se hi ho rahaa he
 In early twentieth-century radio, they were seen as a detective component called "cat's mustache"
 in praarambhik sansuchakon ke chaalan main kaaphi asuvidhaayen thim - tungsten ke bane tantu ko gailena yaa carborndam crystal ke aasapaas tab tak hilaanaa pasta tha jab tak kii wo achaanak hi kaam naa karnaa shuru kar de! us samay inke parichaalan pranali ke bare main pataa nahi tha
 The use of vacuum nozzles, which were more durable, ceased to be used
 aaj ke "billi kii moochon" ko unke naye rup, shotaki diod, main dekha ja saktaa hai
 High-frequency radar research was emphasized during the Second World War, for which amplification based nozzles stopped working
 kotak magnetron ke vikaas ke baad ucch-aavruti pravardhak kii sakt zaroorat paddy
 In an instant, Bell Labs's Russell Ohl re-examines "cat mustaches"
 kai dashakon se iske prayog main naa hone ke kaaran prayogshaala main isaki ek ikai bhi na thi or ise ve dhund ke laaye menhaton ke kisi radio ke dukaan se
 Ohl investigated why the cat's mustache was so beneficial
 1939 main unhone or bhi shuddhikrut crystal par praytn kiya or paaya kii haalanki iskaa jugti ravaiya khatm ho gaya, par iske sansuchan kii kshamta bhi gaayab ho gayi
 Then one day suddenly a crystal of the highest purity lying near them started working - after looking carefully it turned out that there was a small crack in the middle of this crystal
 phir unka dhyaan is baat par gaya ke sansuchak ke kamare main jagah badalane se kabhi yah kaam karnaa shuru kar de to kabhi band kar de
 He discovers that this behavior of the crystal depends on the light falling on it
 jab unhone ise anya logon ko dikhya, walter brattan ne turant boojh liya ki crystal ke daraar par kisi tarah kaa jod ban rahaa he
 It did not take long to reveal the mystery
 crystal me daraar kaa kaaran tha daraar ke donon taraf ke bich dooshan me asantulan, jiske kaaran jahaan ek taraf kuch electron adhik the, to duusari taraf kuch kam
 As both parts were connected, the flow from one side of the electron side to the other side began when the maximum power from the battery's electrical operating power jumped to the other side, and got into the "holes" of the defect
 magar isse ek asthirataa paidaa ho gayi! adhiksham paksh me sahaj santulan ke liye ek electron kii kami hei, jise bydaree ne apane electron ko de kar purti kii or dusre taraf ke atirikt electron ko avasorana karke bydaree ne sampoorn chakra ko puraa kiya
 In this way, electric current flow was established
 bydaree kii disha ko badalane se yah pravaah tham jaataa he kyonki "chhidron" main bydaree ke electron bhar jaate hai or duusari taraf ke adhiksham electronon ke kaaran electron aage nahi batch pate
 This behavior of this diode made of two solid crystals is called semiconductor
 diod ke band hone kii pravriti jod ke paas ke aavesh vaahakon ke pruthak hone ke kaaran he or is kshetra ko | avakshay kshetra kehete hai
 To save this new knowledge of semiconductors, Pardu University, Bell Labs, MIT and together made new better crystals and ended the techniques
 ek saal ke andar hi jarmenium utpaadan main itani paripakvata aa gayi ki inkaa prayog samrik radaaron main shuru ho gaya
 After the war, William Shokley attempted to build a semiconductor device such as the Triode
 iske liye unhone nidhiyan or lab hasil kiya, jon barden or bruttan ke saath kaam karam shuru kiya
 Understanding the movement of electrons in semiconductors was important for the development of transistors
 agar diod ke utsarjak or samahrta ke bich ke is sachlan ko kisi tarah niyantrit kiya ja sake, to pravarddhak kaa vikaas kiya ja sakegaa
 If electric current is applied on both sides of a type of crystal, the flow of electrons is not established; This flow can be established if electrons or "holes" are inserted from the third end
 bade kristal kii pravarddhak ke rup main upyogita bhi kam hoti he, kyonki isamen kaaphi maatra main electronon yaa chhidron kaa antaravahan karnaa pasta he
 Overall, the making of transistors depends on the proximity of the surface to the exposure of the electrons and the input and output at short distances by the depletion region of the crystal
 bruttan ne jab ese yukti ko bananaa shuru kiya, to pravardhan kii jhalken dikhti or lupt hon jaati
 Once, by pouring the application into the water, it suddenly started working, defining mechanics, surface physics)
 kristal ke electronon kii visheshta hoti he ki ve paas ke aaveshon ke prabhaav se ekatrit hoten hai - utsarjak kii sataha ke paas electron or samahrta ke sataha ke paas chhidr ekatrit hote hai vipareet aaveshon ko dhundte hue
 They can be easily removed from this surface with the oscillation of charges in any right corner of the crystal
 agar utsarjak or samahrta paas-paas hon, to aaveshon ke antaravahan se inke bich electronon kaa dhar pravaah sthapit ho jaataa he
 Where this oscillation of charges represents a lighter signal, the stream current between the emitter and the collector is the amplified product of this signal
 bel labs main kai koshishon ke baad safalataa aakhir mil hi gayi nok-sanyog transister ke rup main
 The gold foil was lightly peeled off by affixing the gold foil to the plastic wedge, then with the wedge edge
 isse mila do bahut hi kareebi sone kaa sanyog
 Now this plastic wedge was buried in the crystal and electric power was applied on both sides of the crystal
 dhara pravaah tab hua jab kristal ke tal par lage duusare vidyut shakti se kristal ke electron tal kii taraf bah gayi
 This is the invention of the nozzle-coincident transistor
 23 disambar 1947 ko akasar transister kaa janm diwas kaha jaataa he
 This "PNP nozzle-coincident germanium transistor" had 18 times the speech amplification power
 1957 main wiliam shokli, jon barden or walter brattan ko bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar mila
 Bell Labs' internal polling suggested several names, such as "semiconductor triode", "solid triode", etc
 jon piers ke suzav, transister, ko sabase zyada mat mili
 If you break the name, you get "transfer" and "warrister"
 shokli ko aprasannataa thi ki unhe barden or brattan ke saath transister ke avishkaar ke shrey main bhaag dena pada
 Bullock's lawyers found out that Shokley's writings had some similarities to Julius Edgar Lillian's 1925 patent, and he considered Shokley's name to be excluded from the transistor's patent
 shokli isse atyant naaraaz hue or un ne thaan lee yah dikhaane kii ki asli dimag kiskaa he
 In a few months a new type of transistor was invented, which was stable and durable compared to the nozzle-coincident transistor
 sathwein dashak main is transister kii dhooma thi

 The purification of germanium was quite complex - some of the improvement came from the use of purified water, but nonetheless, because of the overpopulation of germanium, it was suggested that silicon would be a better option
 bahut kam vaigyanikon ne is par dhyaan diya
 The first transistor made of silicon was made by Gordon Teal, whose company, Texas Instruments, took great advantage
 iske baad jarmenium kaa prayog transistaron main khatm sa ho gaya
 The rodents were further purified using the technique of "zone dissolution"

 He imposed the Emergency in 1975 in a situation of instability in the period following a decisive victory in the indo-pak war of 1971
 unhone evam congress party ne 1977 ke aam chunaav main pehali baar haar kaa saamana kiya
 After returning to power in 1980, she was engaged in a growing conflict with most of the separatists in Punjab, which led to her political assassination in 1984 by her own bodyguards
 indira kaa janm 19 november, san 1917 main pandit jawaharlal nehru or unki patni kamala nehru ke yahan hua
 She was his only child
 nehru parivaar apane purakhon kaa khonj jammu or kashmir tathaa dilli kebrahmanon main kar sakate hai
 Indira's grandfather Motilal Nehru was a wealthy barrister from Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh
 jawaharlal nehru purv samay main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bahut pramukh sadasyon main se the
 His father Motilal Nehru was a popular leader of the Indian freedom struggle
 indira ke janm ke samay mahatma gandhi ke netritv main jawaharlal nehru kaa pravesh swatantrata aandolan main hua
 Her upbringing, under the overall supervision of her mother, who was separated from the household related work of the Nehru family due to her illness, developed a strong personality in Indira along with strong protective tendencies
 unke pitamah or pita kaa lagaataar rashtriya raajnneeti main ulajhate jane ne bhi unke liye saathion se meljol mushkil kar diya
 Along with his own sows, which also had Vijayalakshmi Pandit, was opposed and it continued in the political world as well
 indira ne yuva ladke-ladakiyon ke liye vanar sena banaai, jisane virodh pradarshan or jhanda juluus ke saath saath kanges ke netaaon kii madad main samvedansheel prakashnon tathaa pratibandhit saamagreeon kaa parisancharan kar bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main choti lekin ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai thi
 An often repeated story is that he saved an important document, which planned a major revolutionary initiative of the early 1930s, from his father's house under police supervision, through his schoolbag
 san 1936 main unki maan kamala nehru tapedic se ek lambey sangharsh ke baad antat swargavaasi ho gayi
 Indira was then 18 years old and thus never had the experience of a stable family life in her childhood
 unhone pramukh bhartiya, europea tathaa british skulon main adhyan kiya, jaiseshantiniketan, badminton skool auroxford
 During her studies at Somerville College, Oxford University, England, in the late 1930s she became a member of the Indian League, a staunch supporter of freedom based in London

 She gave birth to Rajiv Gandhi in 1944 with Feroze Gandhi and two years later, to Sanjay Gandhi
 san 1947 ke bharat vibhaajan araajaktaa ke dauraan unhone sharnaarthi shiviron ko sangathit karne tathaa pakistan se aaye lakhon sharnaarthiyon ke liye chikitsa sambandhi dekhbhaal pradaan karne main madad kii
 This was his first major public service

 Her married life was initially good, but later when Indira moved to her father in New Delhi, during her prime ministership, living alone in a high mental pressure environment at Teen Murti Bhavan, she was trusted, secretary and nurse
 became
 unke bete uske saath rahete the, lekin wo antat firoz se sthaayee rup se alag ho gayin, yadhyapi vivaahit kaa tagma juta rahaa
 When India's first general election came to a close in 1951, Indira was busy campaigning for both her father and her husband who were contesting from Rae Bareli constituency
 firoz apane pratidwandita chayan ke bare main nehru se salaah mashvira nahin kiya tha or yaddapi vah nirvaachit hue, dilli main apana alag nivas kaa vikalp chunaa
 Feroze soon developed the image of fighting against his political corruption by exposing a major scandal in a nationalized insurance industry, which resulted in the resignation of a finance minister, a colleague of Nehru
 tanaav kii charam seemaa kii sthiti main indira apane pati se alag huin
 However, in 1958, a short time after the by-election, Firoz suffered a heart attack which dramatically healed his broken marriage

 His tenure was eventless
 wo apane pita ke karmchaariyon ke pramukh kii bhoomika nibhaa raheen thim
 Nehru died on May 27, 1964 and Indira contested the election on the inspiration of the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and was immediately appointed to the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, joining the government
 hindi ke rashtrabhasha banane ke mudde par dakshin ke gaiyr hindibhashi rajyon main danga chhidane par vah chennai gayi
 There he consulted with government officials, tempered the anger of community leaders and supervised reconstruction efforts in the affected areas

 Minister Gandhi's footsteps were probably not aimed directly at Shastri or for his own political heights
 kathith rup se unka mantralay ke dainik kaamkaaj main utsaah kaa abhaav tha lekin wo samvaadmadhyamonmukh tathaa raajnneeti or chhabi taiyaar karne ke kala main daksh thim
 "during the struggle between Mrs
 Gandhi and her rivals, the central Congress leadership for succession after 1965, many states and state congress organizations were forced to remove upper-caste leaders and replace the backward castes to collect votes of those castes
 So that their opposition and opponents in the state Congress can be defeated
 , Some of which may be considered appropriate socially progressive achievements, however, often lead to intensifying inter-ethnic regional conflicts 


 jab 1965 ke bharat-pakistan yuddh chal rahaa tha, indira srinagar seemaa kshetra main upasthit thi
 Although the army warned that the Pakistani subalterns had reached very close pace to the city, they rejected their proposal to resettle in Jammu or Delhi and instead circled the local government and welcomed the media's attention

 Then Congress Party President K

 Kamaraj was instrumental in making Indira Gandhi the Prime Minister after Shastri's sudden demise
 san 1966 main jab shrimati gandhi pradhanmantri baniin, congress do guton main vibhajit ho chuki thi, shrimati gandhi ke netritv main samaajawaadee or morarji desai ke netritv main ruudhivaadi
 Morarji Desai called them "dumb dolls"

 He had to take Desai as India's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of India
 1969 main desai ke saath anek mudadon par asahmati ke baad bhartiya rashtriya congress vibhajit ho gayi
 They ran the rule for the next two years with support from socialists and communist parties
 usee varsh july 1969 ko unhone bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran kiya
 In 1971, he declared war on Pakistan on behalf of East Pakistan, who were fighting for their independence, to solve the Bangladeshi refugee problem
 1971 ke yuddh ke dauraan raashtrapati richard nicksan ke adheen america apane saatven bede ko bharat ko purvi pakistan se dur rahane ke liye yah vajah dikhaate hue ki pashchimi pakistan ke khilaaf ek vyapak hamalaa vishesh rup sekashmir ke seemakshetra ke mudde ko lekar ho sakati he, chetavanee ke rup main bengal kii khadimen bheja
 This step had alienated India from the first world and Prime Minister Gandhi has now rapidly given a new direction to a pre-cautious national security and foreign policy
 bharat or soviet sangh pehle hi mitrataa or aapasi sahyog sandhi par hastakshar kiye the, jiske parinamswaroop 1971 ke yuddh main bharat kii jeet main rajnatik or sainya samarthan kaa paryaapt yogadan rahaa
 However, Gandhi was now a national nuclear program in view of the nuclear threat from the People's Republic of China and the interest in the interference of two major superpowers not felt conducive to India's stability and security
 unhone naye pakistani raashtrapati zulfikaar ali bhutto ko ek saptaah tak chalanevaali shimla shikhar vaarta main aamantrit kiya tha
 Approaching the failure of the talks, the two heads of state eventually signed the Simla Agreement, under which the two countries contracted to negotiate and peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute
 kuch aalochakon dwaara niyantran rekha ko ek sthaayee seemaa nahin banane par indira gandhi kii aalochana kii gai jabaki kuch anya aalochakon kaa vishwaas tha kii pakistan ke 93,000 yudhbandi bharat ke kabje main hote hue pakistan prashasit kashmir ko pakistan ke kabje se nikaal lenaa chahie tha
 But this agreement repealed the immediate intervention of the United Nations and any third party and greatly reduced the possibility of Pakistan launching a major attack in the near future
 bhutto se ek samvedansheel mudde par sampurna aatmasamarpan kii maang nahin kar unhone pakistan ko sthir or saamaanya hone kaa mauka diya
 The medium-to-business relationship of many contacts stalled over the years was also normalized again
 smiling buddha ke anaupchaarik chaaya naam se 1974 main bharat ne safaltaapurvak ek bhumigat parmaanu pareekshan rajasthan ke registan main based gaanv pokharan ke kareeb kiya
 India became the world's latest nuclear powerhouse, describing the test for peaceful purposes
 1960 ke dashak main visheshikrut abhinav krishi kaarykram or sarkaar pradutt atirikt samarthan lagu hone par antat bharat main hameshaa se chale aa rahe khaddyann kii kami ko, multah gehun, chaaval, kapaas or doodh ke sandarbh main, atirikt utpaadan main badal diya
 Instead of relying on food aid from the United States - where a President whom Mrs Gandhi greatly disliked, the country became a food exporter
 us uplabdhi ko apane vanijyik fasal utpaadan ke vividhikaran ke saath harith kranti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 At the same time, the white revolution brought about by the increase in milk production, especially among the growing children, helped to overcome malnutrition
 'khaadya suraksha', jaise ki yah kaarykram janaa jaataa he, 1975 ke varshon tak shrimati gandhi ke liye samarthan kii ek or strot rahi
 In the early 1960s, the organized Hari Kranti Kranti was the informal name for the intensive agriculture district program, under which the people living in cities, on whose support Gandhi was, in fact, deeply dependent on all Indian politicians, abound
 Got the surety of cheap food grains
 yah kaarykram chaar charnon par aadhaarit tha: This program, which lasted for ten years, eventually led to a threefold increase in wheat production and a small but attractive increase in rice; While there was little or no growth in cereals such as barley, gram and coarse cereals - still a relatively stable yield remained in these areas
 gandhi kii sarkaar ko unki 1971 ke jabardast janadesh ke baad pramukh kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The internal structure of the Congress Party, weakened as a result of its numerous divisions, became entirely dependent on his leadership in determining the fate of elections
 gandhi kaa san 1971 kii taiyaari main naare kaa vishay tha garibi hataao
 This slogan and the blueprint of the proposed Poverty Hatao program, which came with it, were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support based on the rural and urban poor
 is tarah unhen pramukh gramin jatiyon ke dabadabe main rahe rajya or sthaneey sarkaron evam shahari vyapaaree varg ko andekha karne kii anumati rahi thi
 And, the share of the poor who remained unimpressed in the past, at least both the political value and the political weight, increased
 garibi hataao ke tahat kaarykram, haalaanki sthaneey rupase chalaaye gayi, parantu unka vittaposhan, vikaas, paryvekshan evam karmikaran nai dilli tathaa bhartiya rashtriya congress dal dwaara kiya gaya
 "these programs also presented the central political leadership the ownership of distributing new and vast resources throughout the country 


" "ultimately, Poor Hatao Poor was of little use: only 4% of all funds allocated for economic development, three The major went for poverty removal programs and almost none reached the "poorest of the poor" class
 is tarah yadhyapi yah kaarykram garibi ghataane main asafal rahi, isane gandhi ko chunaav jitaneka lakshya hasil kar liya
 Gandhi had already been accused of authoritarian conduct
 unki majboot sansadeey bahumat kaa vyavhaar kar, unki sattarudh bhartiya rashtriya congress ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar kendra or rajyon ke bich ke satta santulan ko badal diya tha
 He twice declared states ruled by opposition parties as "lawless and chaotic" and took control of them by imposing President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution
 iske alaava,sanjay gandhi, jo nirvaachit adhikariyon kii jagah par gandhi ke kareebi rajnatik salaahkaar bane the, ke badhate prabhaav par, pi
en
haksar, unki kshamta kii oonchai par uthte samay, gandhi ke purv salahakaar the, ne aprasannataa prakat kii
 Seeing his new inclination towards the use of authoritarian power, eminent personalities and ex-freedom fighters like Jayaprakash Narayan, Satendra Narayan Sinha and Acharya Jivataram Kripalani toured all over India campaigning actively against him and his government
 raaj narayan dwaara daayar ek chunaav yachika main kathith taur par bhrashtachar aaropon ke aadhaar par12 june, 1975 ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne indira gandhi ke lok sabha chunaav ko radd ghoshit kar diya
 Thus the court ordered a ban against him from leaving the seat of parliament and participating in elections for six years
 pradhanmantritv ke liye lok sabha yaa rajya sabha kaa sadsy hona anivaary he
 Thus, this decision effectively freed him from office
