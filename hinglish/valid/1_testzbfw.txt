langik janan kii utpatti kaise hui, yah ek paheli he
 Several explanations have been presented about why sexual reproduction evolved from asexual reproduction
 kai protists yon punarutpaadan, bahukoshikeey paudhon, jaanwaron, or kavak ke rup main karte hai
 In the eukaryotic fossil record, sexual reproduction first appeared in Proterozoic Eon 1
2 billion years ago
 sabhi yon punarutpaadan eukeriotic jeev sambhawatah ek ekal cell vaale aam purvaj se nikalate hai
 It is possible that the development of sex was an integral part of the development of the first eukaryotic cell
 aisi kuch prajatiyaan hai jo duusari baar is feechar ko kho chuki hai, jaise ki badeloidia or kuch partnocarpec paudhon
 In more developed plants, sexual reproduction occurs by fruits and seeds
 unke phulon main nar gamit or maadaa yugmak hote hai, jinke sayujya se yugmaj banate hai
 These develop into embryos inside the seed, sprouting and giving rise to new plants
 gamit bahut sookshm or eckoshikeey hote hai
 Sexual reproduction requires two different parents
 kabhi-kabhi ek hi prakaar ke do gamit milakar janan karte hai
 The meeting of such union is called
 do vibhinn gamiton ke milane ko nishechan kehete hai
 Algae and fungi resemble germination in lower grade plants and fertilization in higher grade plants
 jin paudhon ke gamit main nar or maadaa kaa vibhed nahin hota unhen samayugmak kehete hai or aise paudhon ko samayugmi 
 What makes male and female together in fertilization is the spermatozoa, the Assam gametes of the gametes and the plant is called asaugamia or miscellaneous flowers
 janan kii uparyukt vidhiyon ke atirikt kuch anya vidhiyon, jaise ajeevanujanan, apyugmajanan or asechan janan se bhi janan hota he
 There are many methods of sexual reproduction in animals, the main methods are- saamaanya langik janan main do janyu koshikaaye milakar ek yugmaj banaati hai
 Two animals have their origin in the parents of two different sexes
 nar janyu ko shukranu or stri janyu ko dimb yaa andanu kehete hai
 These Januas originate in special ingredients, ie, the Janadas
 nar janad ko vrushan or stri janad ko andashay kehete hai
 The union of the aforementioned two lives is called impregnation
 sansechan ke falswaroop yugmaj kaa nirmaan hota he
 Fragmentation of the zygote creates the embryo and develops into an infant form
 vrushan shukrajnan nalikaaon se bana hota he
 The endoplasm of each tube is made up of embryonic epithelium, whose multiplication and differentiation make sperm
 yah prakriya teen kramon main hoti he
 The first order is the multiplication stage, the second order is the growth phase and the third order is the mature state
 bhruneey apithilium kii sabhi koshikaaye nirmaan main sakasham hoti hai, par kuch hi usamen bhaag leti hai
 These cells are divided into geometrical proportions by necrosis
 vibhaajan se bani koshikaon ko shukranu-koshik-jan kehete hai
 Sperm-cell-masses are very microscopic
 inke andar poshak padaarth ekatrit hene se ye badhane lagate hai
 Such unclassified cells are called primary sperm cells
 ye phir paripakv avasthaa main pravesh karti hai
 Here primary sperm cells divide twice
 pratham vibhaajan ardhasuthran yaa hraas vibhaajan kaa he
 Prior to this division, the number of chromosomes present in the nucleus of the primary sperm cell is doubled, but the parental chromosomes at the time of meiosis are arranged in pairs by intercalation
 antargranthan main koi do chromosomi jode nahin banaate varan aise hi chromosome jode banaate hai jo samadharmi yaa saman shakti or rachana ke hote hai
 Thus the number of ancestral chromosomes in the meiosis becomes haploid
 koshikaaye ab dwitiya shukranukoshika ho jaati hai
 The second spermatocyte is once again divided into what is called mitosis
 isse purvashukranu banate hai, jo dhire dhire roopantarit hokar shukranu ban jate hai
 a typical sperm has three parts - the head, middle section or cervix and tail
 vibhinn shukranuon ke sir vibhinn aakaar ke hote hai
 Most are oval, but the tip of which is crooked, crooked or any other type of paper
 inke agrim sire par nukila agrastha bhaag yaa acrosom hota he
 The middle segment is usually small and cylindrical
 punch kaa akshasutra isi main lipta rahata he
 The tail is long and thin as the filaments and moves like a flag
 yah shighratapurvak hilti-dulti rahati he, jisase veeryadrav, yaa jal main tairkar andanu main pravesh karne ke liye shukranu aage badhata he
 Eggs are produced from the cells of the ovaries
 andey kii bhi gunan avasthaa, vruddhi avasthaa or paripakv avasthaa hoti he
 Egg multiplication is formed by multiplication of some of the producing cells of the ovary
 koshikajanon main andpit ekatra hokar badhate hai or badhkar praathmik dimbkoshika banate hai
 They again degenerate and divide into two separate cells
 inamen ek bahut choti or duusari badi hoti he
 The smaller one is called the first polar body and the larger one is called the second ovary
 dwitiya dimbkoshika kaa sutaran vibhaajan hoti he
 Here too, one is small and the other is big
 badi ko paripakv yaa praudh anda or choti ko dwitiya dhruviya pind kehete hai
 The primary polar bodies are also threaded to get polarity
 dhruviya rachanaayen janan ke kaam ke liye bekaar hoti hai
 The semicircular or degenerate division is necessary because the number of zygotes formed by the combination of such genera is the same as the number of ancestral formulas required for that caste, otherwise the ancestral traits may be likely to change in the offspring
 paitruk sutron kii sankhya nishchit rakhane ke liye yugmaj jagak ke samay unka hraas vibhaajan aavashyak he
 a new organism is produced only when the egg meets the sperm
 jin praaniyon main langik janan hota he, unamem dimb or shukranu do vibhinn lingwale praaniyon main utpann hote hai
 Their conjugation is by intercourse between male and female
 sambhog ke samay dimb or shukranu nikat to aa jate hai, par shukr kaa dimb ke saath milakar ek ho janaa, arthath dimb kaa nishechan kai baton par nirbhar karata he
 Eggs are not impregnated if conditions are not favorable
 sansechan ke liye nimnlikhit paristhitiyaan aavashyak hai : The number of eggs is very small in interbreeding animals and one or a few offspring are produced at a time, but in those animals which have external impregnation, the number of eggs is more and the sperm count is more than the eggs
 Even more
 jab andon or shukranuon kaa sanyog jal main hota he, yugmajon ke liye anek baadhaayen rahati hai, jaise jal kaa taap, uski amlata yaa kshariyata, ; jal kii dhara kii gati, aasapaas ke anya jaleey praaniyon kii upasthiti ityadi
 Thus, nature maintains a large number of eggs and sperm to maintain a series of species, as many of the eggs and sperm from these majority of eggs and sperm die in an uncorrected state on account of any of the above reasons
 sansechan ke liye ek dimb ko ek hi shukranu kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The normal sperm count in ejaculated semen during one-time sexual intercourse has been estimated at 22,60,00,000
 inamen keval ek hi shukranu dimb ko sansechit karne kaa kaam karata he
 Only one egg in each ovulation originates from the ovum
 jyon hi koi kriyasheel shukranu apane hi spishij ke praani ke dimb ke sampark main aata he tyon hi vah usamen pravesh kar jaataa he
 The head of the sperm penetrates inside the egg, but its tail is broken and remains outside
 dimb main shukr pravesh kar uske andar anek ghatnaon ko uttejit karata he
 First, he blocks the entry of another sperm into the egg
 yah kaam is prakaar hota he : a type of chemical secretion is released from the outer layer of the impregnated egg, which does not attract the other sperm to the egg, or it forms a jelly-like membrane around the outside of the egg, which prevents sperm from entering
 Or a very small hole in the egg surrounded by impermeable wall, the micropyle closes as a sperm enters
 dimb main pravisht karne par shukranu nirdhaarit path se cendrak kii ore agrasar hote hue dimb ke purvakendrak se miltaa he or shukranu tathaa dimb donon hi ke purvakendrak ghulmilakar chromosome banaate hai, jo koshika dravya main swatantra pade rahete hai
 The egg now becomes a zygote
 dimb kaa centrosonom lupt ho jaataa he, par shukranu kaa centrosom do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or ek gatisheel tarku kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chromosomes take their place around the ovary of this larynx, and the embryo begins to form and begin to divide and develop the accumulated ovum
 janyuon kaa sayujya kaise hota he, isapar vichaar karne se pataa lagata he ki adhikansh dashaon main to sanyog se hi nar janyu tairte-tairte maadaa janyu ke sampark main aa jaataa he, par kuch dashaon main shukranu sidhe nirdisht lakshya kii ore badhate hai
 The reason for this is because the sperm is attracted towards a particular chemical substance
 is rasinic dravya ko dimb utpann karata he
 This is called chemical traction
 par har dasha main rasinic karshan nahin hota
 It is believed that there is a polar difference between the male population and the female population, due to which they are attracted
 aakarshan kaa vaastavik kaaran kya he, yah nishchit rup se abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 During mating, the female is usually inactive and the male develops a variety of interlocking elements to embrace the female
 kuch praaniyon main gaun lakshanik lakshan, jaise maanav nar main dadhi, muchhen or nari main inkaa abhaav kintu viksit stan kaa hona or chidiyon main vividh bhanti ke rangon se yukt par ityadi, paae jate hai
 These secondary traits are helpful in combining male and female by affecting the sense organs
 kuch praaniyon main kuch aise bhi sahaayak avyav paae jate hai, jo santan kii raksha ke liye hote hai
 After impregnation in many beings, the responsibilities of the parents cease and the zygote develops without any care, in some creatures the children take care of themselves, but in some creatures the parents take great care to protect their offspring
 Huh
 ve andey yaa bhrun kii raksha ke liye koi upyukt sthaan chunate hai
 Some also take measures to keep them tied
 iske liye ve koe kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Other animals have oviposites, in which they preserve eggs or do the same work from the tissue of a living or dead animal
 vahiin andey kaa vikaas hota or dimbh banate hai
 The eggs or eggs of some creatures stick to the mother or father
 kuch maan baap unhen galfdon main liye phirte hai, kuch shishutheliyon main, jaise crusteshia main, kuch swartheliyon main, kuch faili hui dimvahiniyon main or kuch marsupiyal theliyon main liye phirte hai
 In some beings, the coincidence of the egg and sperm is inside the mother's body and the zygotic fragmentation and development of the fetus also take place there
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par shishu mata ke garbh se prasav dwaara baahar chalaa aata he
 The period of time the fetus stays in the mother's womb is called the gestation period
 is prakaar ke vikaas ko ant: vikaas kehete hai
 In some fishes, lizards and birds, the ovum is impregnated within the female's body by sexual intercourse, and the zygotic infarcted ovum is adorned with a powdery covering and comes out of the body
 bhrun kaa vikaas baahar hi hota he
 When fully grown, the child breaks the egg shell and comes out of the egg
 is prakaar ke vikaas ko bahya vikaas kehete hai
 In fish, frogs, and other animals of lower order, both the egg and sperm are ejaculated outside the body and there is a coincidence and the eggs develop in the embryo
 is prakaar sansechan bhi or vikaas bhi bahya hota he 
 Cows, buffaloes, goats, humans, etc
, in which the fetus grows inside the mother's body and the baby comes out in a living state, are called jarayus
 inke vipareet machhlee mechak, saanp, chhipakali or chidiya jaise jantu, jinamein shishu andey se baahar nikalate hai, andj kehalaate hai
 In most cases, the fetus is nourished by the mother's blood, a connective like placenta
 kuch shark machhliyaan, ainablabs, kuch chhipakaliyon or staniyon main isi prakaar kii vyavastha pai jaati he
 In some creatures, after birth or when they come out of the egg, the parents feed the newborn
 staniyon main stan hota he, jisase doodh kaa srav hota he, yah doodh navjaat shishu kaa aahaar hota he
 Saliva is secreted from the mouth of many birds, which is the food of chickens
 anyathaa chidiyaan dana chugakar shishu ke mukh main daal detii hai
 Gestation usually occurs when an adult is born, but in some animals, such as midsize and axolatal, reproduction begins at infancy
 ise asechan janan kehete hai
 The reproduction of most animals or plants is almost certain, the development of the egg depends on the season and environment
 anek chidiyon, kiton or anya praaniyon main vasant yaa greeshm ritu main janan kii kriyasheeltaa adhik hoti he
 The condition of the environment, temperature, humidity, dryness etc
 affect the physiology and also have an effect on reproduction
 bhojan ke saath hi janan kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 In animals where the environment is the same, the season is not fixed in the animals, as in the Philippine islands, some animals migrate only by climatic conditions and there are occasional, external or internal changes in the supporting gonads
 kuch praaniyon main janan jeevanaparyant chalata he, par kuch main umr kii vruddhi ke saath-saath janankriyasheeltaa mand pad jaati athwa bilkul ruk jaati he
 Most animals experience a rest period of reproductive function and then the season begins again
 aisa kram shrinkhalaa main yaa ekantaranat: hota he
 Among high quality animals, including humans, heating, menstruation or egg production are also ordered
 praaniyon ke sharir main kuch aisi granthiyaan hai, jinaki koi vaahni nahin he
 From these glands, hormones are formed, which go directly into the blood
 raktapravaah ke saath saath ye samast sharir main ghoomte hai or sharir par bhinn-bhinn prabhaav utpann karte hai
 They stimulate some organs and suppress some
 inamen piyush granthi or janangranthi kaa prajnan se bada ghanaa sambandh he 
 Some animals have both male gonads and female gonads, and sperm and eggs are produced in the same animal
 ye ubhayalingi praani hai
 In these, either chromosomes of the same type are mutually reproduced inside, called self-immobilization, or impregnate each other's eggs by eating two bisexual pairs, called self-mutation, or by eating two bisexual pairs mutually
 The eggs are impregnated, which is called the cross
 kechuen, jonken, ghonghe or hydra pichley prakaar ke udhaaharan hai
 Swayamsevachan is rarely found

 Bees lay some caged and some undescribed or unfired eggs
 sansechit andey se shramik or rani madhumakhiyaan utpann hoti hai or asansechit andey se drone yaa nar madhumakhiyaan utpann hoti hai
 In some marine creatures, such as sea urchins, scientists have made possible the production of new animals from uncultivated eggs
 mechak ke andey ko sooyee se god kar tathaa uskaa vikaas kar bangchi utpann kiya gaya he
 Thus, eggs have also been successfully induced to develop by physical and chemical methods
 yakrut krimi or tiger sailamandar main janan kii ek apurv reeti pai jaati he, jise dimbhajanan kehete hai
 In this, when the animals remain in a state of disobedience and do not become full adults, then only they start reproduction and growth

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915

 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: prakram gati kaa suchak he
 Variation in the internal structure of any object is change
 jab ek avasthaa duusari avasthaa kii ore sunishchit rup se agrasar hoti he to us gati ko prakram kaha jaataa he
 In this sense, the movement of the organism from the amoeba to the human being, the actions of crust and the flow of fluid into the vapor are indicative of the process
 prakram se aisi gati kaa bodh hota he jo kuch samay tak nirantarata liye rahe
 In the normal world, the root and conscious, such changes in matter and organism are indicative of the process
 is prakaar prakram shabd kaa prayog vyapak arth main hota he
 This basic text of the process has been used to understand social life
 saamaajik shabd se us vyavhaar kaa bodh hota he jo ek se adhik jivit praaniyon ke parsparik sambandh ko vyakt kare, jiskaa arth nijee na hokar samuhik ho, jise kisi samooh dwaara manyata praapt ho or is rup main uski sarthakata bhi samuhik ho
 a society can have many types of groups that influence human behavior in one or more directions
 is arth main saamaajik prakram vah prakriya he jiske dwaara saamaajik vyavastha athwa saamaajik kriya kii koi bhi ikai yaa samooh apni ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa kii ore nishchit rup se kuch samay tak agrasar hone kii gati main ho
 From one point of view, changes in specific direction can be seen under one part of the social system and the other from the perspective of the social system
 pratham prakaar ke parivartan ke teen rup hai- Defined numerically based on size - growth of population, the gathering of more than a few items at one place, such as bullock carts in the grain market or growing as customers day climb, are examples of this
 maikaishwar ne iske vipareet disha main udhaaharan nahin die hai, kintu bazaar kaa shaam ko samaapt hona, bade nagar main din ke 8 se 10 baje ke bich bason yaa relon dwaara bahari bhaag se bhitari bhaagon main kai vyaktiyon kaa ekatra hona tathaa siankal main visarjeet hona aise hi udhaaharan hai
 The loss of famine and epidemic also signifies a similar process
 sanrachanaatmak tathaa kriyaatmak drushti se gun main hone vaali parivartan - kisi bhi saamaajik ikai main aantarik lakshanon kaa pradurbhaav hona yaa unka lupt hona is prakaar ke prakram ke dyotak hai
 Such is the process of moving the symptoms of democracy in a small way towards perfection
 ek chote kasbe kaa nagar ke rup main badhanaa, praathmik paathshaala kaa madhyamik tathaa ucch shikshanalay ke rup main sammukh aana, chote se puja sthal kaa mandir yaa devalayas kii avasthaa praapt karnaa vikaas ke udhaaharan hai
 The action of development refers to the enhancement of those qualities which have been obtained in one stage from a small to a larger and more virtuous position in the other
 yah vruddhi keval sankhya yaa aakaar kii nahin, varan aantarik gunon kii he
 In this way, growth takes place in structure and also in actions
 england main pradhanmantri or sansad ke gun rupi vruddhi main nirantarata dekhi gai he
 There were two directions for this development
 inhen kisi bhi disha se dekha ja saktaa he
 The rise of the Congress and the attainment of independence in India on one hand and the continued powerlessness of the British government can be seen in the same way
 jab tak saamaajik vikaas main nai aane vaali gun sambandhi avasthaa ko pehle aane vaali avasthaa se hey yaa shrey bataane kaa prayaas nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak saamaajik prakram vikaas va hraas kii sthiti spasht karte hai
 Change of goals based on certain limitations - When moving from one stage to another is considered socially acceptable or credible, then that type of process takes the form of progress or progress and when social beliefs change the direction brought by change From the inferior point of view, it will be called the process of collapse or inversion
 rus main samyawad kii ore badhaane vaale kadam pragatisheel maane jaayenge, america main rajkeey satta badhaane vaale kadam patan kii paribhaasha tak pahunch jaaenge, shudra varna ke vyaktiyon kaa brahman varna main khan-paan hona samaajawaadee kaarykram kii manyataon main pragati kaa dyotak he or paramparaagat vyavasthaaon ke anusaar ad:patan kaa lakshan
 Some systems may be credible according to the beliefs of s time and at other times they can be seen as contemptuous
 rome main glediator kii vyavastha, yaa pracheen kaal main das pratha kii avasthaa main hone vaale parivartanon ke aadhaar par bhavanaayen nihit thim
 There are different classes or groups in the society, they determine their beliefs
 ek samooh kii manyataayen kai baar sampurna samaaj ke anuroop hoti hai
 Sometimes they also go in opposite directions and according to them different social changes can be evaluated in the direction of credit
 jab tak saamaajik manyataayen swayan na badal jaaen, ve parivartanon ko pragati yaa patan kii paribhaasha lambey samay tak detii rahati hai
 Other types of social processes can be seen outside of themselves but in terms of balancing or growing as part of a normal system
 saamaajik parivartan chab ek sanstha ke lakshanon main aate hai to kai baar us sanstha kii sampurna saamaajik vyavastha yaa anya vibhaagon se bana hua sambandh badal jaataa he
 The earlier equilibrium fluctuates and the process starts in any direction
 pariwaron ke chote hone ke saath sanyukt parivaar ke hraas ke falswaroop vruddh vyaktiyon kaa parivaar yaa gram se sambandh badalata sa dikhaai pad rahaa he
 The strong relations of feudalism have suddenly brought a new problem for the prominent people of that era
 is bhaanti ke parivartanon ko samajhane kaa aadharbhoot tatv samaaj ke ek ang kii purvavastha ke santulan ko nai avasthaa kii samasyaon se tulana karne main he
 These types of changes can be balancing or reducing balance
 santulan ek ang kaa anya angon se dekha ja saktaa he
 When two individuals or groups try to achieve the same goal by using accepted means, this action is called competition
 isamen lakshya prapti ke saadhan saamaanya hote hai
 Sometimes even the manual gets published
 olympic khel tathaa khel kii vibhinn prakaar kii pratiyogitaayen isaki suchak hai
 Getting the first position is the second example under the rules of examination
 jab niyamo ko bhang kar, yaa unki avhelnaa kar lakshya prapti ke liye vipakshi ko niyamon se pare haani pahunchaakar prayaas kiye jaaen to ve sangharsh kehalaayenge
 Competition in political parties harmonizes the basic rules; Conflicts in them dilute the rules and thus create chaos
 kabhi-kabhi chote sangharsh badi ekta kaa sarjan karte hai
 At the time of external aggression, the internal organizations are united at times, sometimes such maladjustment takes root that it cannot be removed even beyond ordinary ways
 yah aavashyak nahin ki sangharsh kaa fal sadaa samaaj ke ahit main ho, kintu us prakram main niyamon ke atirikt hone vaale prabhavatmak kadam avashya uth jate hai
 When one society or culture encounters another society or culture, many times elements of one start appearing in the other and the other in the first
 samskruti ke tatwon kaa is bhanti kaa grahan adhiktar simit evam chune hue sthalon par hi hota he
 Tea was taken from the British for breakfast but no butter; The use of clocks increased but the habit of working on time was not as widespread; Sitting on the chairs and remembering caste in getting jobs are similar changes
 dar samaaj main vastuon ke upyog ke saath kuch niyam or pratibandh hai, kuch manyataayen tathaa vidhiyaan hai or unki kuch upadeyata he
 It is not necessary that the place of an object in one society, its place should be in the other society at all these points
 bharat main motor or telephone kaa upyog sammaan vruddhi ke maapak ke rup main he, jabaki america main vah keval suvidha maatr kaa; kuch deshon main parmaanu bam raksha kaa aadhaar he, kuch main pratishtha kaa
 In this way, the spread of culture is influenced by the needs, beliefs and social structure of the society
 is prakriya main nai vyavasthaaon evam vastuon ke kuch hi lakshan grahan kiye jate hai
 It has been called English in culture
 culture main jab kisi nai vastu kaa aanshik samavesh kiya jaataa he to us ansh grahan ko is shabd se vyakt kiya gaya he
 When an element of a culture is completely incorporated into a new culture, then that process is called assimilation
 is shabd kaa bodh he ki grahan kiye gaye lakshan yaa vastu ko is rup main samskruti kaa bhaag bana liya he, maano uskaa udgam kabhi videshi rahaa hi na ho
 As of today, it has become such an integral part of culture that the need to see the source of its arrival cannot be accepted
 hindi kaa khadi boli kaa swaroop hindi bhashi pradesh main aaj utana hi swaabhaavik he jitna unke liye aalu kaa upyog yaa tambaakoo kaa prachlan
 In India, the elements of Saka, Hun and Scythian have become so ingrained that it is meaningless to see their separate existence
 ek bhashaa main anya bhashaaon ke shabd isi rup main apana sthaan bana lete hai, jaise pandit kaa angreji main yaa rail motor kaa hindi main samavesh ho gaya he
 When an element obtained from an external system becomes an integral part of an internal system, then that process is called intimation
 ek hi samaaj ke vibhinn bhaag jab ek-duusare kaa samarthan karte hue saamaajik vyavastha ko akhand banaae rakhane main yogadan karte rahete hai to us prakram ko integration kaha jaataa he
 The concrete structure of this type of society often makes the society strong and devoid of new ideas
 nity nae parivartanon ke bich ekmaatr thos vyavasta swayan main santulan kho baithti he
 Therefore, it is expected that the living social system also encourages processes within itself to create new equilibrium for new stages; In this view, a fully organized society has a weakness in itself
 gatisheel samaaj main kuch asantulan aavashyak he kintu mukhya baat dekhne kii yah he ki usamen nity nae santulan tathaa samasya samaadhaan ke prakram kis swasthyaprad dhang se chalate hai
 Processes of cooperation and conflict always run in every society
 prayek samaaj main sahyog evam sangharsh kii prakriyaayein sadaa chalati rahati hai or unke bich vyavastha banaae rakhana har samaaj ke bane rahane ke liye aisi samasya he jiske samaadhaan kaa praytn karte rahanaa aavashyak he

 Ganga Dussehra is a major festival of Hindus
 jyeshtha shukla dashami ko dashahra kehete hai
 In this, bathing, donation, morphological fast is done
 skandapurana main likhaa hua he ki, jyeshtha shukla dashami sanvatsarmukhi maani gai he isamen snaan or daan to vishesh karke karen
 Do Arghya and Tilodak on any river
 aisa karne vaala mahapatkon ke baraabar ke das paapon se chhot jaataa he
 If Jyeshtha Shukla is a Tuesday on Dashami and there is a Hath Nakshatra Yuta Tithi, it is all about to be defeated
 varah puraana main likhaa hua he ki, jyeshtha shukla dashami budhvaari main hast nakshatra main shreshth nadi swarg se avateern hui thi vah das paapon ko nasht karti he
 For this reason, that date is called Dussehra
 jyeshtha maas, shukla paksh, buudhvaar, hast nakshatra, gar, anand, vyatipaat, kanya kaa chandra, vrishabh ke surya in das yogon main manushya snaan karke sab paapon se chhot jaataa he
 It is written in the Bhavishya Purana that, on this day of Dussehra, a person who stands in the water of the Ganges and recites this hymn ten times, whether poor or poor, is unable to find the fruit by worshiping the Ganges
 yah dashahra ke din snaan karne kii vidhi puri hui
 The Ganga Stotra called Dussehra and the method of reading it of Skanda Purana - Beautiful three-eyed quadrilateral with all the elements, which is embellished with all four arms, Ratnumbh, Swetakamal, Varada and Abhay, is wearing white clothes
 mukta maniyon se vibhooshit he, saumy he, ayut chandramaaon kii prabhaa ke sam sukh vaali he jis par chaamar dulaae ja rahe hai, waal shwet chhatra se bhaleebhanti shobhit he, acchhee tarah prasann he, var ke dene vaali he, nirantar karunardrachitt he, bhuprishth ko amrit se plavit kar rahi he, divya gandh lagaae hue he, triloki se poojit he, sab devon se adhishthit he, divya ratnon se vibhooshit he, divya hi malya or anulepan he, aisi ganga ke pani main dhyaan karke bhakthipurv mantra se archana karen
 'om Namo Bhagwati Hilli Hilli Mili Mili Gange Maa Pavay Pavay Swaha' This is the mantra of Gangaji
 iskaa arth he ki, he bhagavti gange! mujhe baar-baar mil, pavitra kar, pavitra kar, isse gangaji ke liye panchopchaar or pushpanjali samarpan karen
 In this way, by meditating and worshiping the Ganges, stand in the water of the Ganges and make a resolution with ॐadya etc
 that, at such times, in order to destroy all sins by increasing one every day from Pratipada to Dashami on the bright side of Jyeshtha month
 i will chant the Ganga Stotra
 peeche stotra padhanaa chahie

 Gir Wildlife Sanctuary is a state-owned national park and wildlife sanctuary in Gujarat, India, known for being the only habitat of lions in Asia
 gir abhayaarany 1424 varg kilometre main failaa hua he jisamen, 258 varg kilometre main rashtriya udyaan or 1153 varg kilometre vanyapraniyon ke liye arakshit abhayaarany vistaar he
 Apart from this, there is Mittiyala Wildlife Sanctuary nearby which is spread over 18
22 km
 ye donon arakshit vistaar gujarat main junagarh, amarelli or gir somnath jile ke bhaag he
 This park and sanctuary is a center of attraction for expatriates in the world for Sinha Darshan
 vishwa main singhon kii kam ho rahi sankhya kii samasya se nipatane or aciatic singhon ke rakshan hetu singhon ke ekmev nivasasthaan samaan is vistaar ko arakshit ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 After Africa, lions have survived in this world

 The history of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary is more than 100 years old and its predecessor has a connection with ancient history
 bharat or anya vistaar main pracheen kaal main singhon kii prajati kaa mahatv rahaa he or lokvartaon main singh ko jangal kaa raja kahan jaataa he
 The lion is also mentioned in ancient symbols
 sanathan dharm main maan amba kaa vaahan singh he
 Later, the lion species began to become extinct not only in India but also in the spread of Asia and around 1900 only 15 lions were left in the Gujarat region
 tab junagarh ke tatkaaleen nawab dwaara gir kshetra ko singho ke liye arakshit ghoshit karke singho ke shikaar par pratibandh laga diya tha
 In ancient times, lions were also found all over India and other countries of Asia
 singapore kaa naam singh ke upar se padaa he jiskaa arth singhon kaa nagar hota he
 In the ancient texts of India, there is mention of hunting of lions by the kings to show bravery

 The US had no plans in fact, because the US intelligence department was confident that the Soviet Union would never deploy a nuclear missile in Cuba
 Exom quickly discussed five possible action sequences: sanyukt chinas of staff ne sarvasammati se sahmati vyakt kii ki ek purna-paimaane par hamalaa or hastkshep hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 They believed that the Soviet Union would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba
 kennedy uljhan main the
 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing
 If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin
 kennedy ne sochaa ki cuba par hawaii hamalaa karne se soviet yah maan lenge ki berlin ko adheen karne ke liye "ek hari jhandi" kaa signal mil gaya he
 Kennedy also believed that US allies would think that Berlin lost the US as a "war-loving cowboy" because of not finding a peaceful solution to the Cuban situation
 :332 Exom then discussed the strategic balance of power, the impact on both political and military
 sanyukt chinas of staff kaa maananaa tha ki mixilon se sainya santulan gambhir rup se badal jayega, lekin raksha sachiv robert mkanmara ne isse asahmati jataayi

the military balance had not changed

 Then America Will Take Action, ": 674-681 Second, would damage the us's credibility between its allies and the American public if they allowed the Soviet Union to change the strategic balance by deploying missiles in Cuba
 Huh

 On Sunday, October 21, Kennedy met Exom members and other top advisors throughout the day and considered two options: mainly air strikes on Cuban missile bases, or Cuban maritime blockades
 a full-scale invasion was not the first option of administration, but something had to be done

 Since it was scheduled to take place in international waters, President Kennedy received approval from the OAS to take military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the Rio Treaty
 Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the U
S
 Commander South Atlantic at Trinidad on 9 November
 An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required
 In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine
 The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship
 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the U
S
 to discuss this assistance
 The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation
 This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty
 Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport
 The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba
 The cno's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine

 sabhi ne yues kii sthiti kaa samarthan kiya
 On October 22, Monday evening at 7:00 pm EST, President Kennedy gave a nationwide television speech broadcast by all major networks, announcing the discovery of the missiles
 It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union
 Kennedy described the administration's plan: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated
 All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back
 This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers
 We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948
 During the speech, instructions for US forces around the world to be placed at DEFCON 3 were issued

 However, after this, at 9:24 pm, a wire sent by Khrushchev was received by Kennedy at 10:52 pm EST, in which Khrushchev said, "if you look at the evolving situation with impunity, you will understand with a cool mind
 That the Soviet Union would not shy away from rejecting America's arbitrary demands, "and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as" an attack action "and instructed its ships to ignore it Ayenge

 On 25 October Thursday morning at 1:45 EST, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by saying that the US had been forced into action, constantly assuring us that there were no offensive weapons in Cuba
 And when these assurances proved to be wrong, then the reactions against the deployment "became necessary which i have announced

 Robert Kennedy called it "a very long and emotional letter"
 Khrushchev reiterated the basic framework, which John Scalley had been told the day before, "I propose: on our part we will declare that there will be no weapons in our ships for Cuba
 You will declare that The United States will not attack Cuba and will not support any other forces that intend to attack Cuba
 Then our military specials in Cuba Jtron is no longer requires the presence of

 Contrary to last night's letter, a new proposal was made in this message that if the Jupiter missiles were removed from Italy and Turkey, the missiles would be withdrawn from Cuba in return
 At 10:00 am EST, the Executive Committee met again to discuss the situation and concluded that the message changed after internal arguments between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin
 :300 mecnaimara ne paaya ki grojni naam kaa ek or tanker ravaanaa hone600 mile ko he, use roak diya janaa chahie
 They also found that they have not made the USSR aware of the quarantine line, which is why they suggested to give this information to them through u Thant at UN

 But 


 you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us 


 i therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive

 will remove its analogous means from Turkey

 Kennedy had already stated that he would order an attack on those sites if an attack occurred, but decided that he would not do so until a second attack
 40 saalon ke baad mecnaimara ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that — the Cubans did not have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did — we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air -missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we would not meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation

 White House special counsel and advisors Ted Sorrensen and Robert Kennedy went to the meeting and returned 45 minutes later with the effect of a draft letter
 The President had made several changes, typed and sent it
 exom kii baithak ke baad, ovel karyaalay main ek or choti baithak jari rahi
 The team argued that the letter given to Ambassador Dobranin should be outlined with a verbal message saying that if missiles were not lifted, military action would be taken to remove them
 Dean Rusk added a provision that Turkey would not be mentioned anywhere in the language of the agreement, but there would be an agreement that the missiles would be "voluntarily" removed immediately thereafter
 The President agreed to this and the message was sent
 juon brito kii guzarish par fomin or scally phir se mili
 Scali asked why Khrushchev's two letters were so different, so Fomin claimed that it might have happened because of "poor communication"
 scally ne jawaab diya ki yah daawa vishwasaneey nahin or ve chillaaye ki unhen sochaa ki yah "ek bekaar dhokhaa tha"

 Scally said he did not think anyone would believe it, but they agreed to give the message

 Within the US establishment, it was well understood that Khrushchev was in a terrible situation, ignoring the second proposal and accepting the first
 sainya taiyaariyaan jari rahi or sambhavit karrwai ke liye air force ke sabhi adhikariyon ko sakriy duty ke liye unke addon par waapas bula liya gaya
 Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood, saying, "we did not give up hope, but what could be expected now when Khrushchev revisited his position in the next few hours
" yah ek ummid thi, na ki apeksha
 mangalvaar yaa sambhavat: kal tak sainya sangharsh kii apeksha thi
 

 " raat 8:05 iesti ek patr agle din die jane ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya
 The message was like, "as i read your letter, the main points of your proposal - as much as i could understand them, seem to be acceptable - which are the following: 1) You can get these weapons systems from Cuba to the UN proper supervision
" And have agreed to withdraw with proper security under surveillance and not keep such weapon systems in Cuba

 The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure that it would not be "late"
 patr milane ke saath hi ek samjhauta taiyaar hua
 However, as Robert Kennedy mentioned, there was a small expectation that it would be accepted
 Exom again met at 9:00 pm EST to consider the next day's action

 After much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles in southern Italy and Turkey, later also from across the Soviet Union's border, in return for Khrushchev from Cuba
 Missiles lifted

 In the context of Cuba the Security Council Under the framework, the US would make a statement that goes like this: It would be announced that the United States would respect the inviolability of Cuba's borders, its sovereignty

 yues etorni general robert kennedy ne soviet rajdoot antony dobranin se apane samjhaute main anaupchaarik rup se prastaav diya ki turki main jupiter mixilon ko "sankat khatm hone ke kuch hi dinon ke bheerat" hataa liya jayega
:222 aakhri yues mixilon ko 24 april 1963, tak kholkar alag-alag kar diya gaya or iske turant baad unhen turki se baahar bhej diya gaya
 The practical effect of this kennedy-khrushchev treaty was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, while also ensuring that the US would not invade Cuba
 yah sambhav he ki khrushchev ne cuba main mixilon ko keval isliye rakhaa tha taaki kennedy italy or turki se misile hataa le, jabaki soviet kaa parmaanu yuddh kii sharan main jane kaa koi iraadaa nahin tha; basharte americanyon dwaara goli maar kar unki hatya kar di jaae

 The assumption was that Kennedy won the battle between the superpowers and Khrushchev was humiliated
 haalanki, yah maamla puri tarah se thik aisa nahin he kyonki kennedy or khrushchev donon ne hi unki apni sarkaron ke dabaav ke baavjood purna sangharsh ko taal dene ke liye hi har kadam uthaaya

 The Soviet Union seemed to be retreating from the circumstances that they had started - though it could have been viewed in reverse if it had been properly carried out

 Castro was not entirely happy with the idea, but he accepted the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution to save Cuba from the US invasion and help his ally Soviet Union
 :272 schlesinger kaa maananaa tha ki misile hataa liye jate to kastro khrushchev se or bhi naaraaz hote or tab ve kennedy ke saath hote, kyonki khrushchev ne unhen hataane kaa nirnay lene se pehle kastro se mashvira nahin kiya tha
 In early 1992, it was confirmed that by the time the crisis arose the Soviet Army in Cuba had acquired tactical nuclear detonators for its cannon rockets and Il-28 bomber aircraft
 kastro ne kaha he ki agar yues yah jaanate hue bhi ki cuba tabah ho jayega, akraman karata he to ve inke upyog kii sifarish karenge
 Controversially the most dangerous moment in this crisis was identified during the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference in October 2002

 dravghnatvamaapi yaa utplav-ghanatvamaapi yaa hydrometer vah yantra he jisase bina kisi gananaa ke, dravon ke ghanatv padhe ja sakate hai
 The attention of these instruments to scientists was from very ancient times and there is evidence that Archimedes knew about them
 dravadhanatvamaapi kii rachana is siddhant par aadhaarit he ki drav main anshat: duube hue or santulit pind kaa bhaar utane drav ke bhaar ke baraabar he jo pind kaa duba hua bhaag visthapit karata he
 When the hydrometer is released into a fluid in which it can float freely, the density of the fluid is read by its lashing and the intersection of the flat surface of the fluid
 padhane ke liye dand ke bheetar ek maapni chipki rahati he
 If the volume of the hydrometer is below the density of a specific calibration mark of this scale and the density of the fluid, then the mass of the displaced fluid is
 yadi dravghnatvamaapi kaa dravyaman he to Therefore, if the volume below the lowest symbol indicated on the penalty and the volume between the highest and lowest signs, then the range of densities that can be measured with a thermometer is from m / to m / V

 praayah ghanatv ke sthaan main aapekshik ghanatv kaa prayog hota he, jiskaa arth he, utpaada or pani donon ke 15 degree celsius taap par ke ghantvon kaa anupaat
 Due to the diffusion coefficient of the fluids that work, it is desirable to choose a specific temperature to compare their densities and this temperature is usually taken at 25 ° C
 dravghnatvamaapi kii maapni ke anshankan chinhon par ve ghanatv likhe rahete hai jo is taap ke us drav kaa hota jisamen dravghnatvamaapi is ansh tak duubataa
 But it is always inconvenient to bring the fluid to this temperature, so a biannual table is given, in which 15 ° C, corresponding to the reading and fluid temperature of the thermometer
 The modification can be read to obtain density

 The second use of a hydrometer is to find the percentage of sugars in a sugar solution, which requires the observation of the biannual table by finding the temperature of the solution and its density reading from the fluidometer
 is prakaar dravghnatvamaapi ke saath saraniyon kaa hona aavashyak he
 Arrays can be modified if required and work with the same hydrometer
 agar yah siddhantatya maan liya jaae ki dravghnatvamaapi kaa kaary ghanatv padhanaa he or saraniyon kaa kaary un paathyaankon ko sarthakata dena he, to bahut kuch main sarleekaran or vartmaan bhrantiyon kaa nivaaran, kiya jayega

 maapni par anshankan kaa aadhaar, jaise 15° celsius par gram prati mili
, khuda rahanaa chahie
 It can be easily proved that if the density corresponding to the highest point of the penalty is ρ0 and that of the minimum corresponds to ρ1 ', then the ratio of bulge and penalty volumes yadi dand kaa aantarik vyas ek samaan he, dand kii lambaai l tathaa ucchtam chinh se ghanatwair vaale chinh kii duuri l he to From this we can see that as ρ increases, the increase in l is expected to decrease; As a result, the calibration marks at the bottom of the scale become more and more close

 When the lube of the condenser is partially submerged in a fluid, the surface of the water rises somewhat near the lashing due to the back strain
 jitne utkarshi bal se drav uthta he, utane hi bal se dand neeche ko prerit hota he or ek prakaar se uske dravyaman m main vruddhi ho jaati he; yahan centimetre main dand kaa vyas he, drav kaa prishthtanav he, gurutvatwaran hai
 So if the standard reads, in a more retarded fluid, the thermometer reads density, which modifies the reading udhaahrant:, yadi =

 However, different compilation methods assign a value to the Grandy series in the same way
 inamen se do saralatam vidhiyaan sisera-sankalan or able sankalan pramukh hai
 The first method of obtaining a compilation of divergent categories was given by Ernesto Sisera in 1890

 The average value for each n of the first n partial computations is σn, and then the marginal value is obtained when its n is leading to infinity
 grandi shrenee ke liye, samaanaantar madhya kaa anukram nimnlikhit he Or, more symbolically jahaan The sequence of parallel mean converges at 1⁄2, so the Sisaira compilation of Σak is 1⁄2

 The Sisera compilation of the range 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + · · · is 2⁄3

 If the latter range converges to a function for 0 <x <1, x, leading to 1, then it is called the abel summation of the original range
 iske baad able prameya ke anusaar yah prakriya saadhaaran yoga ke tarksangat he
 The following can be written for Grandi category shrenee 1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + · · · ke sangat able yoga 2⁄3 he jo falan / se praapt hota he
 Whenever a class Sisera is computable, it is also computable and its sum is obtained

 According to China's official military history, this war helped China achieve its policy goals of protecting its western sector border, as China retained de facto control of Aksai Chin

 According to James Calvin, even though China won a military victory, it lost its international image

 These countries saw China's goals as world conquest and clearly believed that China was the aggressor in the border war

 After the war, the Indian Army underwent extensive changes and felt the need to be prepared for similar conflicts in the future

 Due to the inability to anticipate the possibility of Chinese invasion of India, Prime Minister Nehru faced harsh criticism from government officials for promoting pacifist relations with China
 bhartiya raashtrapati radhakrishnan ne kaha ki nehru kii sarkaar aprishkrut or taiyaari ke bare main laaparvaah thi
 Nehru accepted that Indians were living in their world of understanding

 The Indian Army was divided due to Krishna Menon's policies of "good appointment to the favored" and the 1962 war was seen by the Indians as a combination of a military defeat and a political disaster

 Many Indians saw the war as a betrayal in India's attempt to establish a long-standing peace with China

 The war put an end to Nehru's hopes that India and China could form a strong Asian pole, a response to the growing influence of the superpowers of the Cold War group

 Two years later, in 1967, there was a small border skirmish between Chinese and Indian troops as a Chola incident

 To know the reasons for the defeat, the Government of India took it immediately after the war

 His war with the East India Company is called the Kotiot War

 However, when the Mysore army captured Malabar for a second time, all senior members of the Kottayam royal family fled to Travancore
 pazhassi raja ne kottayam sena se kahin adhik majboot mysuri akramanakariyon ke khilaaf ek susangathit chhapamar ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 During this time he emerged as the most influential figure in Kottayam, as the public stood firmly with his beloved prince, who did not leave him even in his misfortune
 His troops were drawn from among the Nair warriors and the Kurichias and Mullukurumbas tribals
 kerala verma pazhassi raja kaa janm kottayam shahi rajvansh puranat swarupam ke padinjare kovilkam main hua tha
 This Padinjare Kovilakam or western branch of this royal dynasty was located in Pazhassi
 is prakaar lokapriy pazhassi raja naam aayaa
 Thalassery taluka of Kannur district used to be the kingship of Kottayam where it is today
 is rajtv kii rajdhani pazhassi kottayam main sthit thi, yah ek chota-sa shahar tha, jo tailicheri se adhik dur nahin tha
 Hyder Ali captured Malabar for the second time in 1773 on the pretext that the king of Malabar did not present a gift as agreed in 1768
 haidar kii krur sena ke bhay se malabar raja ke adhikansh parijan apane bal-bacchon or mitron ke saath travnakor bhaag gaye
 Although the chastity, robbery and atrocities of the Mysorean authorities began to be protested everywhere in Malabar, this resistance turned into anarchy with the exodus of the leadership
 baharhaal, pazhassi raja ne ghoshnaa kii ki khatre ko saamne dekhakar bhaag khadaa hona kaayarta he
 He remained in Kottayam and started a guerrilla war by mobilizing a team, as he could not fight face to face with the Mussoorie army because he did not have enough guns and army
 raja ne puralimala ke lagbhag abhedya jangal-pahaado or vynad main anek adde banaaye or kottayam tathaa vynad main mysuri sena ko baar-baar gambhir kshati pahunchaayi
 In 1778, Hyder's vassal, the king of Chirakkal, besieged Talassery at the behest of Hyder himself and led to his economic blockade
 mysuri sena ke haathon se kottayam ko chhudaane main talasseri sthit sashastr british karkon ne pazhassi raja ke logon ko sakasham banaaya
 This move of the British Army ensured that the Chirakkal army was now attacked from the rear by Pazhassi army
 chirakkal sena ne peeche hatana shuru kiya
 But Pazhassi chased them and destroyed the Chirakkal army and after that they marched towards Kottayam, where they ended the Mysore occupation and took possession of the entire Kottayam
 lekin is mahatvapurn kshan main jab british or raja kii sanyukt karrwai se malabar main mysuri sena ko tabah kiya ja saktaa tha, tab talasseri sthit british karkon ko british governor dwaara nirdesh diya gaya ki haidar ke saath nammaatr shanti ko samaapt nahin kiya jaay
 Thus, Mysore took advantage of the British decision not to capitalize on the victory in Thalassery
 The Chirakkal army was strengthened by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao, who marched towards Kottayam
 gupt rup se british dwaara gola-barood or hathiyaaron kii aapurti ke baavjood pazhassi ke log itani badi sena ko roak paane yaa haraane main vifal rahe or ek yuddh ke baad jald hi kottayam sena bikhar gayi
 The mysore-chirakkal army then captured Kadathanad and enshrined a puppet king who had joined hands with Mysore
 1779 main, ek vishaal mysore- chirakkal-kadathanad sena ne talasseri ko gher liya
 Pazhassi Raja sent an army of 1300 Nairs to help the British to protect Talassery and it was successful
 1779 ke ant tak, gheraabandi ko teji se ek safal parinaam tak pahunchane ke liye mysuri senapati sardaar khan ko talasseri bheja gaya
 Sardar Khan knew that with the help of Pazhassi, the British were able to resist him and that is why he started negotiating with Pazhassi
 usne pazhassi ke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki agar ve mysore ke saath mitrataa kar len or saath main paanch lakh rupee kaa uphaar pradaan karen to mysore adhikrut kottayam ke kshetra waapas de die jaaenge
 itane kam samay main itani badi raashi kaa intjaam karnaa kottayam ke vash se baahar kii baat thi
 But Pazhassi made great efforts on his part to pay Sardar Khan and also paid him 60,000 rupees
 But Khan was not satisfied and turned down Pazhassi's request to return his authority in Malabar
 sardaar khan ke is laalchee va uddand drushtikon se yah tay ho gaya ki talasseri par kabja jamaana mysore ke liye lagbhag asambhav he
 In 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to lift the Mysore siege from Talassery: he and his men would attack the enemy from the east side and the British army would come out of the fort to attack the Mysorean army from the front
 donon senaaon ke is sanyukt prahaar se shatru do bhaag main bant jayega
 tab mysuri tathaa mitra sena ko aasaani se ukhaad phenkaa ja sakegaa
 lekin 1781 main hi angrejon ko is yojana kaa mahatv samaj aayaa or unke bombai adhikari isse sahamat hue
 pazhassi kii yojana ke anusaar ek oparation shuru kiya gaya or mysuri sena ke vinaash ke saath yah samaapt hua
 Sardar Khan was also killed
 uske baad pazhassi raja ke netritv main nair yoddhaon ne kottayam main vidroh kar diya
 Soon, the Mysoreans were driven out
 1782 tak, kottayam ek swatantra desh tha
 But after the Treaty of Mangalore after the anglo-mysore War, the British recognized the authority of Tipu Sultan over Malabar
 is prakaar usne apana ekmaatr moolyawaan sahyogi kho diya, mysore kaa ek maatahat rajya banane ke liye kottayam taiyaar ho gaya tha
 Once again, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore fixed a very high rate of visitation
 haalanki pazhassi raja ke bade bhai ravi verma prati varsh 65,000 rupee dene par sahamat hue, lekin mysore ne 81,000 rupee kii maang kii
 The increased rate of visitation increased the difficulties of farmers who were already suffering from foreign occupation for years
 tab pazhassi raja ne is mudde ko apane haathon main liya or ek baar phir jan pratirodh andolan kii shuruyaat kii
 By the end of 1788, Pazhassi's hatred towards Tipu increased greatly due to Tipu's policy of forced conversion
 pazhassi ne maan liya ki angrej nishchit rup se kahin kam bade shatru hai or unhone unke saath apane sambandhon ko majboot banaaya
 Not surprisingly, Tipu sent an army from Kottayam to Palakkad to subdue the Nair warrior caste
 But in 1790, Tipu abandoned the Malabar War because of his focus on the Deccan war
 katirur ke mysuri garh par kabja karne ke liye pazhassi raja 1500 nairon ke saath angrejon ke saath ja mili
 After Katirur, Pazhassi and his army marched south-east and snatched the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men
 is prakaar ek baar phir se puraa kottayam pazhassi raja ke niyantran main aa gaya
 In 1790, the British recognized Pazhassi Raja as the chief king of Kottayam instead of the original king taking refuge in Travancore
 angrejon ko bataur bhent 25,000 rupaye dene ke liye raja sahamat ho gayi
 However, after the defeat of Tipu in the Third anglo-mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British under the Seringapatam Treaty between the British and Tipu
 tab angrejon ne malabar main apana varchasv sthapit karnaa shuru kiya
 The British and Pazhassi had opposite opinions in this matter - Pazhassi did not help the British because they were willing to accept British sovereignty, but because they wanted to see their country Kottayam independent
 pazhassi us samay pareshaan ho uthe jab unhone 1792 main malabar ke raja ke saamne angrejon kii rakhi sharton ko padhaa
 haalanki ve shuruyaat main anishchit the, lekin baad main unhone apana man banaaya or british sharton ko maanane par sahamat ho gayi
 The summary of the terms is as follows: in sharton ne raja ko mahaj ek british agent main badal diya
 The king's rights to rule as he wished had been taken away and he also had no control over the economy
 pazhassi ne sochaa hoga ki kottayam ke gharelu prashasan main angrej hastkshep nahin karenge, kyonki mysore shashan kaal main bhi adhinsth raajaaon kii swaittata jari rahi thi
 If Pazhassi thought about the future, he was to be disillusioned with the British in the near future
 pazhassi raja ne 1793 se 1805 main apni mrityu tak british samrajyavad kaa virodh kiya
 He fought two wars to protest British intervention in the domestic affairs of his state
 He waged war on the question of Kottayam management from 1793–1797 and on the issue of ownership over Wayanad from 1800–1805
 pazhassi raja ke kurumbranad ke raja apane chachaa veeraa verma ke saath achche rishte nahin the
 In 1793, this rascal uncle Raja explained to the British commissioners that he should be allowed to deposit taxes in Kottayam
 He thought that the British would be happy with the good tax collection and he would be allowed to occupy the entire Kottayam
 Needless to say that Pazhassi Raja became enraged by this British trick
 unhone khud ko chalaa hua mahasoos kiya
 After all, he was the only king in northern Malabar who consistently helped the British in the war with Mysore
 raja veeraa verma asli dhokheybaaj tha - ek taraf usne kottayam main kar jamaa karne kaa sidhaa jimmaa apane haathon main le liya or duusari taraf usne pazhassi raja ko angrejon kaa virodh karne ko uksaaya
 iske alaava, angrejon kaa moolyankan kathor tha or bhugtan karne kii kisaanon kii kshamta se pare tha
 He protested the forced extortion by British agents and Pazhassi Raja took the issue into his own hands
 jaisaa ki pehle dekha gaya tha, raja ne is jabaran vasuuli kaa tagada virodh kiya
 In 1793, Pazhassi Raja as a protest ensured that the British in Kottayam were not allowed to collect tax
 unhone yah bhi dhamkee di ki agar angrej adhikariyon ne kaali mirch kii lataaon kii gananaa band nahin kii to ve lataaon ko nasht kar denge
 However
 Local British officials had a discussion with the king and soon both came to know of Veera Varma's dirty game
 so, angrejon ne raja ko sweekaar yogya samaadhaan kaa rasta akhriyaar kiya, jiske tahat kul rajasav kaa 20 fisadi raja ke paas or anya 20 fisadi mandir kharch main janaa tay hua
 In the near future, no tax was also to be imposed on the temple property
 1793 main, tipu ke vakeelon ne angrejon se shikaayat kii ki british adhinsth pazhassi raja ne adhikansh vynad par kabja jamaa liya he, jo tab bhi mysore ke adheen tha
 Soon the king became the supreme of the Wayanad plateau
 lekin governor general ne moorkhtapurna dhang se 1794 ke samjhaute ko radd kar diya or kurumbranad raja ko paanch saal ke patte par kottayam de diya gaya
 The king got really angry with this and decided to resist it by running the rule of his country according to customary law
 patta kii avadhi samaapt hone ke ek saal pehle raja ne mahaan nair iruvazinad ke naarangoli nambiar ko apane yahaan sharan di, jinhen angrejon ne apradhi qaraar de rakhaa tha, kyonki unhone aise teen logon kii htya kar di thi jinhone unke swajan kii htya kii thi
 This kindness of the king with Nambiar irritated the British
 angrej is baat se bhi naaraaz hue ki raja ne prathagat kanoon ke anusaar do daakuon ko suuli par chadha diya tha
 The British planned to arrest Raja on the charge of 'murder', but abandoned the idea thinking that 500 armed Wayanad Nair bodyguards were engaged in protecting Raja
 1795 main, patte par kottayam mil jane ke ek saal baad bhi veeraa verma kottayam main kar nahin vasuul paaya, iske liye unke bhattije raja ko hi shrey jaataa he
 So, British forces were sent to help Veera Varma in tax collection, but the people of Paiichi Raja successfully resisted him
 1796 main, bombai se aadesh jari hua ki kottayam main 2 saal bakaayaa kar vasuul kiya jaay
 raja kii giraftaar ke liye angrejon ko ab kisi bahaane kii zarurat nahin rahi
 300 soldiers under Lieutenant James Gordon were dispatched from Talassery and captured Raja's fort Rupi residence at Pazhassi
 lekin iske chaar din pehle hi raja manattana ja chuke the
 Gordon looted the palace where the king's traditional treasure lay
 is lut se raja krodhit hue or unhone talasseri sthit paryvekshak ko ek patr bheja
 The king was also angry that his former commander Kurjambranad named Pazayamvideen Chandu had become an agent of the king and the king got even more angry when Veera Verma and the treachery with the blessings of the British, the audacity to dictate them Of
 baad main catheri ambu ke ek samarthak dwaara chandu maar daalaa gaya, jab pajayamviden us samarthak kii htya kar daalane vaala tha
 The king took his capital Purali chain and then Wayanad
 The king blocked all British communication between Wayanad and lower Malabar through the Kuttiyadi valley
 angrejon ne bhi javaabi karrwai karte hue raja or nichle malabar ke bich sabhi sanchaar kaat die
 But since they did not have enough army, instead of chasing, they started waiting for help
 british commandent karnal do tha, jise raja talasseri kii gheraabandi ke samay se acchhee tarah se jaanate the
 So the king thought that this old friend of his could help him in mediating with the British government
 raja ne sangharsh khatm karne kii peshkash kii, basharte ki unhen maaf kar diya jaay or unke khajaane sahit unka ghar waapas kar diya jaay
 karnal or raja puraane sainik hone ke naate anaavashyak raktapaat se nafrat karte the or isliye usne raja ke anurodh ko apane un ayuktaon ke paas bhej diya, jo haalanki raja kii swatantra style kaa kadaa virodh kiya karte the, phir bhi ve karnal kii salaah se sahamat ho gayi, jabaki tipu ke saath raja ke mil jane kaa jokhim bhi tha
 The northern superintendent was ordered to return the king's house and the king's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and supreme governments
 lekin sarkaar ke aadesh veeraa verma ke madhyam se raja ko suchit kiye gayi, jiskaa matlab hua ki chachaa raja ne apane bhattije tak yah khabar nahin pahunchaai ki angrejon ne unke anurodh ko maan liya he
 Uncle Raja had a vested interest in continuing the war between the British and the nephew Pazhassi Raja
 veeraa verma ne raja ke khaas or senapati catheri ambu ko bhi kottayam ke grih prashasan se hataa diya
 Ambu along with his followers moved to Kannoth, where he planned and implemented a resistance with the help of the public, which ensured the withholding of tax collection by Veera Varma in Kottayam
 lekin ambu spasht rup se raja ke maargdarshan par kaam kar rahe the, jo ambu ke nishkasana ko apane chachaa kii ek or sajeesh samaj rahe the, taaki raja ko kamjor kiya ja sake
 The king feared that the British were planning to arrest him, so he went to distant Wayanad
 vynad main british sena ke jamaav se unka shaq or bhi bad gaya
