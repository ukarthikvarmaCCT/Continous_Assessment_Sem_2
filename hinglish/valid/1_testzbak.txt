ve varisht daata hai
 Trinity is also reflected in the qualities of Vishnu
 ve teen pad-kram vaale, teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale, teenon lokon ko naap lene vaale or lokatray ke dharak hai
 Similarly, he is also the equated form of 'tridhatu' ie satta, raja and tama or containing earth, water and light
 vishnu parthiv lokon kaa nirmaan or param vistrut antariksh aadi lokon kaa prasthaapan karne vaale hai
 They are the three types of movement in self-constructed worlds
 unki ye teen gatiyaan udbhav, sthiti or vilay kii pratik hai
 In this way, they are also the creators of everyone, both spinach and destroyer
 ve 'lokatray kaa akelaa dharak' hai
 They measure all three worlds alone with their three footprints
 lokatray ko naap lene se bhi yah falit hota he ki lokatray arthath vahaan ke samgr praani unke purna niyantran main hai
 Vishnu is also an embryo-protector
 garbhasth beej kii raksha ke liye or sundar balak kii utpatti ke liye vishnu kii prarthana kii jaati he
 Due to the clear emphasis on his foster nature, he has been called 'vishnurgopa Paraman Pati 

' meaning the protector of all, even in the Ahoratra fire form in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan rugveda ke ashtum mandal ke pachchisven sookt ke barahawein mantra kii vyakhya main bhi vishnu ko spasht rup se 'paalan se yukt' maanate hai
 xxrep 4 
 isliye samgr pariprekshya main rugveda main vishnu ko param hitaishi kaha gaya he
 Despite being mentioned in most mantras, Indra is called 'sukrit' and Vishnu is called 'sukritara'
 'sukruttarah' kaa acharya sayan ne 'uttam fal pradaan karne waalon main shreshth' arth kiya he; shripad satavlekar ji ne 'uttam karm karne waalon main sarvshereshth' arth kiya he or maharishi dayanand saraswati ji ne bhi 'ativ uttam karm vaala' arth kiya he
 Indra is 'sukrit' and Vishnu is 'sukritarah'
 taatpary spasht he ki rugveda main hi yah maan liya gaya he ki vishnu sarvocch hai
 Similarly, despite being the king of Indra, the supremacy of Vishnu is also clear in the Rigveda that in it it is said for Vishnu that "he holds the whole world alone" and Indra is told that he States do
 taatpary spasht he ki sristi ke sarjak evam paalak vishnu ne sanchaalan hetu indra ko raja banaaya he
 In this well-defined perspective, Brahmin texts related to the supremacy of Vishnu and later mythological beliefs also spontaneously emerge
 brahman-yug main yajna-sanstha kaa vipul vikaas hua or iske saath hi devamandali main vishnu kaa mahatva bhi pehle kii apeksha adhiktar ho gaya
 At the beginning of Aitareya Brahmana, in order to give place in yagya, starting with fire, Vishnu's place has been called 'param'
 inke madhya anya devataaon kaa sthaan he
 In this way, Vishnu has been given a much higher place in the Vedic Samhita texts than the fire that attained the foremost place
 vastutah vishnu ko mahattam to rugveda main bhi mana hi gaya he, par varnan kii alpata ke kaaran vahaan unka sthaan gaun lagata he
 He has been given the highest rank by the explicit statement in the Brahmin texts
 yah shreshthata is katha se bhi spasht hoti he ki vishnu ne apane teen pagon dwaara asuron se prithvi, veda tathaa vaani sab chhinakar indra ko de di
 This is the narrative conversion of the three steps of the Vedic Vishnu into Brahmins; And with this, the superiority of Vishnu also became clear in the Brahmin era itself
 aitarey brahman spasht rup se vishnu ko dwarpal kii tarah devataaon kaa sarvatha sangrakshak maanata he
 The signs available in the Rigveda and the Brahmins have had substantial additions to the Puranas - narrative as well, descriptive as well as explanatory
 puraanon ne is jagat ke mul main vartmaan, nity, ajanma, akshay, avyay, ekares tathaa hey ke abhaav se nirmal parabrahm ko hi vishnu sangya di he
 He is devoid of instructions and adjectives like 'paranaam Par:', the divine located in the inner soul, the supreme superior and the form, varna etc
 ve janm, vruddhi, parinaam, kshay or naash -- in chah vikaron se rahit hai
 They are widespread and the whole world is inhabited by them; That is why scholars call him 'vasudev'
 jis samay din, raat, akaash, prithvi, andhkaar, prakaash tathaa inke atirikt bhi kuch nahin tha, us samay ekmaatr vahi pradhan purush param brahm vidyaman the, jo ki indriyon or buddhi ke vishay nahin hai
 At the beginning of the universe, the same sentiment expressed by Lord Vishnu as Chatur Shloki Bhagwat in the original knowledge of Brahma, - i was the only one before creation
 mere atirikt na sthool tha na sookshm or na donon kaa kaaran agyaan
 Where this is not a creation, i am the one and i am the one who seems to be in the form of this creation and i am the one who will survive
 in sandarbhon se vishnu kii sarvocchata tathaa sarvaniyanta hone kii bhaavana spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Vishnu is believed to have two forms
 pratham rup-- pradhan purush or doosraa rup 'kaal' he
 These both combine and separate both creation and holocaust, or nature and man
 yah kaal rup bhagavan anadi tathaa anant hai; isliye sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or pralay bhi kabhi nahin rukate
 In the context of the origin of creation in the Bhagavata Maha Purana, known as the Sirmour of the Vaishnavas and the 'tilak of Puranas', it is said that the lotus emerged from the navel of Vishnu, who slept in Ekarnava, and realized all the qualities in it
 With the entry of Vishnu himself, the Vedmaya Brahma automatically emerged
 isi prakaar adhikansh puraanon main vishnu ko param brahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The Puranas are full of stories related to them
 paalankarta hone ke kaaran unhen jaagtik drushti se yada-kada vividh prapanchon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Suggesting deception to be tricked by the Asuras, advising the gods on sea-churning for regaining sovereignty when the Asuras seize the kingdom; And by taking the form of erotic Mohini and enticing the Asuras to feed the nectar to the gods; Vishnu's deception in the stories mentioned in the sub-divisions like Devi Bhagwat and Shivpuran related to dissolving the essence of Tulsi for the slaughter of Shankhchud
 is sambandh main yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki paalankarta hone ke kaaran ve parinaam dekhte hai
 Due to the disenfranchisement of the asuras / unjust by any boon, if the end of the unjust and deceit is scandalized, they do not hesitate to cheat
 ramavatar main chhipakar bali ko maarna tathaa krishnavatar main mahabharat yuddh main anek chhalon kaa vidhayak bananaa unke isi drushtikon kaa parichaayak he
 Carpenters use these stories as an antidote to arbitrary interpretation
 parantu inhen sandarbhik gyaan kii drushti se dekhnaa isliye aavashyak he kyonki puraanon yaa tatsambandhi granthon main ye prasang vipareet sthitiyon main saamaanya se itar vishisht kartavya ke gyaan hetu hi upasthaapit kiye gayi hai
 It is important to note that in Puranas, elemental knowledge is called Brahma, God and God
 vishnu kaa sampoorn swaroop gyanatmak he
 In the Puranas, the jewelery and armaments worn by them are also considered symbolic: - is prakaar samast srujanaatmak upadan tattvon ko vishnu apane sharir par dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 a stanza related to the figure of Shrivishnu is very famous: - shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshm
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrash Megha Varnam Shubhangam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam
 vande vishnu bhavabhayaharan sarvalokaikanatham
 
 bhavarth - jinaki akruti atishay shant he, jo sheshnag kii shaiya par shayan kiye hue hai, jinaki naabhi main camel he, jo devataaon ke bhi ishwar or sampurna jagat ke aadhaar hai, jo akaash ke sadrush sarvatra vyaapt hai, nilmegh ke samaan jinka varna he, atishay sundar jinke sampurna ang hai, jo yogiyon dwaara dhyaan karke praapt kiye jate hai, jo sampurna lokon ke swami hai, jo janm-maran rup bhay kaa naash karne vaale hai, aise lakshmipathi, kamalnetra bhagwaan vishnu ko main pranaam karata hoon
 Vishnu's superiority does not mean that Shiva or Brahma etc
 are inferior to him
 oonch-neech kaa bhav ishwar ke paas nahin hota
 It is just a priority to be virtuous in Leela for creation and operation
 isliye vaishnav ho yaa shaiva -- sabhi puraana tathaa mahabharat jaise shreshth granth ek swar se ghoshit karte hai ki ishwar ek hi hai
 It is said that the same Lord Janardhana holds these three nouns - 'brahma', 'vishnu' and 'shiva' - for the creation, condition and destruction of the world
 anekatra vishnu tathaa shiv ke ek hi hone ke spasht kathan uplabdh hote hai
 The word 'avatar' literally means the manifestation of God in the physical world through his independent power
 avatar kii siddhi do dashaon main maani jaati he -- ek to apane rup kaa parityag kar kaaryvash naveen rup kaa grahan; tathaa doosraa naveen janm grahan kar sambaddh rup main aana, jisamen mata ke garbh main uchit kaal tak ek sthiti kii baat bhi sannivisht he
 It does not involve changing the form for a short time or regaining the form of another
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke chaturth adhyay ke suprasiddh saatven evam aathven shloke main bhagavan ne swayan avatar kaa prayojan bataate hue kaha he ki -- jab-jab dharm kii haani or adharm kaa utthan ho jaataa he, tab-tab sajjanon ke paritran or dushton ke vinaash ke liye main vibhinn yugon main utpann hota hoon
 Apart from this, a specific and more lofty purpose has been said in the Bhagavata Mahapurana that God is beyond the nature of growth, destruction, etc
, is indestructible, eternal, nirguna
 to yadi ve avatar rup main apni lila ko prakat nahin karte to jeev unke ashesh gunon ko kaise samajhate? atah jeevon ke preranaroop kalyaan ke liye unhone apane ko tathaa apni lila ko prakat kiya
 Therefore, there are many odd situations in different avatar-stories so that the organism can understand what the proper path is according to the situation! vishnu ke avtaron kii pehali vyavasthit suchi mahabharat main uplabdh hoti he
 The total number of incarnations in Shantiparva of Mahabharata is stated to be 10: - hans: kurmashch matsyasch pradurbhava dwijottam

 Here, from the aforesaid incarnations, leaving the swan and adding the third Rama i

 Balarama, the number of Dash is complete
 is vivaran se ek baat pramanit ho jaati he ki mahabharat-kaal tak dash se adhik avtaron kii kalpana bhi nahin kii gayi thi; anyathaa un dash avtaron ko 'bhoot or bhavishya ke bhi sabhi avatar' nahin kaha gaya rahata
 Later, other avatars were also conceived and the total number of incarnations reached twenty-four
 bhagwat mahapurana main 22 tathaa 24 avtaron kii gananaa ke baavjood avtaron kii bahumanya sankhya mahabharat vaali dash hi rahi he
 Many Puranas like Padmapuran, Lingapurana, Varahapuran, Matsyapuran etc
 have mentioned about the same avatars
 agnipurana ke varnan main bhi bilkul vahi kram he
 The following verses of this context are generally universal: matsayah kurmo varahashch narsinghoth vamanh

 My allegiance to my work was made soon and my mother's towards her



 meri maa ek adarsh gruhinee thi
 She managed to raise the family better even on a low income
 phir ek din hamen vah kasbaa chhodkar pasaau main aana padaa
 i was quite young then
 darasal vahaan ghati main based us kasbe main mere pita kii niyukti ho gai thi, kintu ham vahaan zyada dinon tak nahin rahe, vahaan se hamen linz aana padaa
 This is where my father retired and settled there
 unki pension se ghar kaa guzaara mushkil se ho rahaa tha
 My father was very hardworking since childhood
 unka parivaar bahut nirdhan tha
 At that time, he was only thirteen years old, when he left home due to the financial condition of his family
 logon ne unki kam umr ko dekhakar ghar laut jane ke liye bahut jor diya, kintu ve kuch kar dikhaanaa chaahate the, atah kuch seekhney kii ichha se viana aa gayi
 At that time, he had only three guldas in his pocket, while the desire was high
 itani kam aayu main bina dhan, kisi aparichit sthaan par aana ek saahasik kadam hi kaha jaayegaa, kyonki aane vaale samay main unhen kin kathin paristhitiyon se do-chaar hona padegaa, yah bhi unhen pataa nahin tha
 But the determination of the mind put an end to all fear
 ghar tyaagane ke chaar varsh baad yani jab unki aayu satraa varsh kii hui, to ve kaarigari kii training paas kar chuke the, magar is gun se unhen santushti na mil saki
 He could not earn much in the work received from that training, so he decided to do some big work and he got busy in achieving this goal
 mere pita gaanv main rahete hue sochate the ki purohitai kaa kaary sarvshereshth he, magar shahar main aane tathaa vahaan kaa vaataavaran dekhakar unki soch badal gai thi
 After coming there, he came to know the importance of government job, in which there was money and comfort, as well as respect
 anya kisi kaam main ve itani suvidhaayen nahin juta sakate the
 With this approach, he started trying to get a government job
 ant main unke drudh nishchay kii jeet hui or taees yaa choubees varsh kii aayu main unhen asainik sarkari santhaan main naukari mil gai
 After forgetting his determination and after getting the step, he started reminding him of his family and town
 magar ab vahaan unka apana koi nahin tha
 So it felt pointless to go there
 unhone waapas kasbe main lautne kaa vichaar sthagit kar diya
 At the age of fifty-six, he retired from service
 khaali baithne kaa unka swabhaav nahin tha, isliye unhone khetibari karne kaa vichaar kiya or apper austria ke bahari ariye main lambaanch naamak sthaan par farm kharid liya
 In this way, while living in Lambancha, they started plowing on the chest of the earth
 yah us daur kii baat he, jab main is yogya ho chukaa tha ki apane bhavi jivan ke vishay main nirnay le sakuun
 i did not have the slightest desire to do the work that Dad used to do
 main kya karnaa chahta tha?


is vishay par bhi maine gambheertha se vichaar nahin kiya tha
 But still what i had decided in my mind that i would not handle my father's work
 ghar main mere paanv rukate nahin the, meraa adhikansh samay shararti bacchon ke bich baaten karne yaa daud lagane main bitta tha
 My mother did not like these boys even at all
 meri shararti mitramandli ke saath aksar bahes hoti rahati, jisase mujhamen behichak bolne kaa gun viksit ho rahaa tha
 i had become a very good leader
 apni umr se adhik vyakti kii bhaanti meraa bolnaa mujhe paathshaala ke sabhi bacchon se alag pahchaan de rahaa tha
 i loved the prayer meetings in the church, so i started singing songs in the group group of the church in Lambancha
 meraa maanviya adarsh aibat the is adarsh ko praapt karne ke liye main sadaiv sangharshrat rahata tha
 Just like my father got inspiration from a priest in childhood, so was my situation
 mujhe apane pitaaji se kabhi protsaahan nahin mila, kyonki unki najar main meraa kushal vaktaa hona mahatvaheen tha, mere bhavishya ko lekar vah sadaa chintit rahete the
 Once, while looking at my father's books in reverse, i got some books related to military subjects
 is pustika ke do khand the
 i had the material dear to read
 is pustak ke pathan-pathan ne mere man main sainik vishyon se jadi ghatnaon ko vistaar se jaanane kii utkashtha utpann kar di
 i had a wide range of questions in my mind, because a booklet contained material related to the french-german military themes of 1870–71
 main behad gambheertha se sochataa tha, kya german main rahane vaale tathaa yuddh main ladane vaale germanavaasiyon main koi bhinnata he? kya antar he vah? aakhir is yuddh se austria alag kyon rahaa? kya ham anya germanavaasiyaan kii bhanti german ke naagarik nahin hai? aakhir mere pita or anya log kyon us yuddh main sahyogi nahin bane? kya vastav main unamem or hamamen antar he? My mind got confused in finding answers to these questions
 apane is prashnon ke jo uttar maine khoje unase main asantusht tha
 But i understood that not all Germans had the privilege of being related to the kingdom of Wismarck
 aisa kyon tha, yah meri buddhi main nahin aa rahaa tha! isliye main is vishay main gambheerthapurvak adhyayan kaa vichaar karne kaa icchhuk tha, kintu mere pitaaji ko meraa is kshetra main padaarpan bada hi nagavar gujara
 He wished that i too could get a government job like him
