 The Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost have the same meaning
 20veen sadi se pehle angreji main holi spirit ke liye holi ghost bahut hi aam naam tha
 The name is used in the Book of Common Prayer, Catholic Doug Reims Bible and King James Version) and is still widely used among English speakers whose religious vocabulary is largely derived from the KJV
 yah shabd aaj bhi angrezi carch main paaramparik-bhashaa ke sanskaar main barkaraar he
 The original meaning of the English word ghost is parallel to spirit or soul; Later, the latter word was taken in the specific meaning of "the dead soul of the dead" and added to the objectionable symbolic meaning
 1901 main bible ke america maanak sanskaran ko holi spirit ke naam se anudit kiya gaya, jo ki 1881-1885 ke angreji sanshodhit sanskaran par aadhaarit he

 Christians believe that the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians
 vishisht kshamtaaon vaale ye uphaar isai vyaktiyon ko pradaan kiye jate hai
 They are known by the Greek word for gift, charisma, which makes the word charismatic
 nayaa vidhaan teen alag-alag aise uphaar pradaan karata he, jo ki alokik se lekar vishisht aahvaan se sambhddha se lekar harek isai se apekshit kuch had tak tak shreneebaddh hote he
 It is mostly believed that these lists are not exhaustive and others prepare their own lists
 sant ambros ne pavitra aatma ke saat uphaaron ke bare main likhaa he ki bapstima ke samay aastikon par in uphaaron kii baadh laa di jaati he : 1

 sammati kii aatma; 4
 kshamta kii aatma; 5
 gyaan kii aatma; 6
 dharmikata kii aatma; 7
 pavitra bhay kii aatma
 The greatest disagreement remains among Christians about the existence of the Holy Spirit, regarding the nature and occurrence of these gifts, especially supernatural gifts
 ek raay yah he ki isai dharmadutiya yugon ke liye alokik tohfon ke vitaran kii vishesh vyavastha hua karti thi, kyonki us samay girjaghar kii sthiti anokhi thi or vartmaan samay main pradaan kiya janaa durlabh ho gaya he
 This view is that of Catholic churches and other mainstream Christian groups

 However, the practice of supernatural gifts was rare in some small groups such as the Montinists until the development of the Pentecostal movement in the late 19th century
 alokik uphaar kii praasangikta main aastik kabhi-kabhi pavitra aatma ke baptism yaa pavitra aatma ke poorak ke bare main kaha karte hai, jisaki un uphaaron ko praapt karne ke kram main isai ko anubhav karne kii jarurat he
 Many churches believe that baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same as conversion and that all Christians in the Holy Spirit are defined by baptism

 From the point of view of theology, these symbols are the key to understanding the Holy Spirit and his works and it is not only artistic representation
 !'" According to Roman Catholic theology, the primary work of the Holy Spirit is through the Church

 purvi orthodoxi kaa daawa he ki parampita devatv kaa shaashvat strot he, jisase putr shaashvat rup se paidaa hota he
 In contrast to the Roman Catholic Church and Western Christianity in general, the traditional church did not accept the use of the Filioque, describing the grace of the Holy Spirit
 589 main third council of tolado main pehali baar philiok kaa jik kiya gaya or 11veen sadi main roman catholic girjaghar dwaara moolmantra main ise joda gaya
 It is believed for the Holy Spirit to originate from the Father in perpetuity, according to Jesus in John 15:26; Not from the Father and the Son, as the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches claim

 During the last phase of the 19th century, the extradition movement prevailed the view that the Holy Spirit currently functions only through the influence of inspired theology
 is tarkwaadi vichaardhaara ko elexander campbell se joda gaya, jo "bhavatmak shivi baithkon or unke din ke pratyarvatan ke rup main jo unhone dekha, usase bahut adhik prabhavit" the
 They believe that the soul leads people to salvation, but it is understood that the soul does this work "by the persuasion and thought of words in the same way in which one person moves from one to the other
" " yah vichaar barton dablyoo stone par abhibhavi hua, jinka maananaa he ki isai ke jivan par aatma kii adhik pratyaksh bhoomika hoti he
 From the 20th century, there were many from the Church of Christ who broke away from the "word-only" doctrine of the operation of this Holy Spirit
 jaisaa ki andolan ke ek chaatr kaa kahana he, "achche yaa bure ke liye ho, jin logon ne tathakthith shabd keval siddhant kii himaayat kii thi unki pakad isamsih ke girjagharon ke logon ke mano-mastishk par ab nahin rahi

" While the Holy Spirit has been accepted as God in all mainstream denominations, it has a special emphasis in Pentecostal churches
 un charchon main aadhunik isaayiyon ko loukik tathaa alokik uphaar, jaise ki vaani tathaa bhavishyavaanee karne kii shakti, dene vaale ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The Christian movement called Pentecostalism derives its name from the event of Pentecost, the event of the coming of the Holy Spirit when Jesus' disciples gathered in Jerusalem
 pentacostwadiyon kaa maananaa he ki jab kisi vishwasi kaa "pavitra aatma se baptism" hota he, tab aatma ke uphaar isamsih ke sharir arthath carch ko unnat karne ke liye praptakarta main sakriy ho jate hai
 Some of these gifts are listed in 1 Corinthians 12
 pentacostal andolan pavitra aatma ke kaam par vishesh bal detaa he or vishesh rup un uphaaron par jinka ullekh upar kiya gaya he, unka vishwaas he ki aaj bhi uphaar die ja rahe hai
 Most of Pentecostalism differentiates "baptism with the Holy Spirit" from the experience of re-birth, it is generally a different experience in which it is believed to gain the power of the soul by the Christian in a new way
 With that, Christians will be able to display symbols, miracles and wonders more readily for the sake of evangelism or for service within the church and community
 Some Pentecostalists believe that soul baptism is an essential element for salvation, not a "second blessing"
 These Pentecostalists believe that the power of the soul is released in their lives when they are baptized by the Holy Spirit
 kai pentacostalwaadi maanate hai ki pavitra aatma ke is antavpuran kaa nirdeshaatmak praarambhik sakshya he anya jabaanon main bol paane kii kshamta ),or kisi vyakti vishesh vishwasi ke jivan main pavitra aatma kii upasthiti ke anek aadhyatmik abhivyaktiyon main se ek he vaani kii abhivyakti
 Non-trinitarian views differ significantly from traditional Christian doctrine and generally fall into two categories
 kuch samoohon kaa maananaa he ki pavitra aatma parameshwar pita or parameshwar putr se ek alag satta he or kisi anya myne main koi alag astitv hone ke bajaay vah unke saath 'ek' he; latter de santon kaa vishwaas is shrenee main aata he
 Others believe that some aspect or function of God refers to the Holy Spirit; Jehovaz Wittnes, Christadelphians, Unity Church and Oneness Pentecostalism beliefs fall into this category
 latter de saint andolan main, pavitra pretatma ko ishwariyamurti kaa teesraa bhinn sadsy manaa jaataa he, or uske paas ek "aatma" rupi sharir hota he, jo ki use pita or putr se alag karata he jinke paas jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he "manushya kii tarah moort" sharir hote hai
 Like other modalist groups, Oneness Pentecostalism states that the Holy Spirit is a form of God, rather than separate or distinct from the Father, it is simply another name of the Father and not the distinction between God the Father, his Son and the Holy Spirit is
 jehova ke gavaah kaa maananaa he ki pavitra aatma asli maanav nahin he, balki parameshwar kii shakti he, jaise ki parameshwar kii divya "saanse" yaa "urja", jiskaa istemaal unki ichha ko puraa karne or srijan, mukti, pavitrataa ou divya maargdarshan ke uddeshy main hota he or ve is shabd kaa saamaanya taur par laabh nahin uthaate

 The Unity Church describes the spiritual terms God the Father, God and the Holy Spirit in a spiritual way in three forms of intellectual activity: intelligence, imagination and expression

 The concept of Bahá'í religion is of the greatest soul, seen as the limit of God
 iskaa istemaal aamtaur par parameshwar ke doot / paigambar ke upar parameshwar kii aatma ke avataran kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ki parameshwar ke aavirbhaav ke rup main janaa jaataa he, tathaa inamen isamsih, mohammad or bahoulla shaamil hai
 In Bahá'í it is believed that the Holy Spirit is the carrier through which the knowledge of God is directly connected with His messenger and in different religions, in different ways such as the burning of Moses' bush, which is the sacred fire for the Zoroastrians, The pigeon near Jesus, the angel Gabriel of Muhammad and the nymph of heaven near Baha'u'llah
 bahaai dharm is avadharana ko khaarij kar detaa he ki devatv main pavitra aatma parameshwar kaa saajhedaar he, balki maanata he ki vishuddh saar parameshwar kii visheshta he
 In the religion of Islam, a spirit created as a messenger who performs a divine act or gives a message is usually seen in association with the angel Gabriel or Ruhul Qudus and is called the Holy Spirit, but alternatively created by God The soul with which he killed Adam, is inspired by the angel of the heaven and the Prophet

 However, the term Ruhul Qudus is found in the Talmud or Midrasi literature

 The "holy Spirit" is humanized to some extent in the Rabbi, but it is the quality of God as one of his attributes; Not as a spiritual division of the representative into divinity, as in Christianity
 shekhinah bhi dekhen
 a religious movement developed out of Christianity, called Rastafari, it makes its own unique interpretation of the Holy Trinity and the Holy Spirit
 haalanki bahut saare maamuli badlaav he, ye aamtaur par yah kehete hai ki yah haile selasi he, jo param pita parameshwar or parameshwar donon ko moort kar detaa he; jabaki holi yani pavitra aatma rastaa dharm main vishwaas karanevaalon main) or har maanav jati main paaya jaataa he
 Rasta also says that the human body is the true church and also that the Holy Spirit resides in this church
 jordan main jab isamsih kaa bapstima hota he tab pavitra aatma un par ek kabutar ke rup main utarati hai; is vivaran ke aadhaar par pavitra aatma ko hameshaa kabutar ke rup main darshaya gaya he
 Many pictures of the proclamation show the Holy Spirit as a dove, as soon as the archangel Gabriel declares that Jesus Christ is coming into Mary's womb, a light rays begin to grow towards Mary
 ek kabutar mahaan sant gregory ke kaan main bhi dekha ja saktaa he jaisaa ki anya girjagharon ke fadar lekhakon yaa unke sachivon dwaara unke kiye gaye kaamon ke die gaye varnan main darj he
 The dove is also parallel to that, which comes with the olive branch to Noah after the flood, and the presence of God in the Rabi tradition above the surface of the pigeon
 da book of acts ne hawa ke rup main paintecost main parameshwar ke doot ke upar utarate hue pavitra aatma kaa varnan kiya he or laplapaati hui agni ko parameshwar ke doot ke upar vishram karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Based on the imagination, the Holy Spirit is sometimes depicted as a symbol of the fire crest in this description

 Furthermore, the divine presence of God is in Shekhinah and is also feminine

 The word Holy Spirit has been translated into Arabic language القدس الروح and has been used as a masculine in all Qurans

 The author reiterates that God is spirit and that the Bible introduces God through humanization and avatarism, which only shows the likeness of God
 God is not a sexual being, either male or female─something that was considered to be true in ancient Near Eastern religion
 He even speaks specifically against such a view in Num 23:19, where the text has God saying he is not a man, and in Deut 4:15-16, in which he warns against creating a graven image of himself in "the likeness of male and female
" But though he is not a male, the "formless" deity has chosen to reveal himself largely in masculine ways
 In art, when the Holy Spirit is introduced using the form of a human body, that form is usually that of the male body, such physical characteristics are not meant to represent reality

4 dawa main, anupaalan rogiyon us avasthaa ko varnit karata he, jab use chikitsa salaah lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Mostly, it refers to drug or drug compliance, but it can be used for medical devices such as compression stockings, chronic wound care, self-guided physiotherapy practice, or for counseling or other treatments for patients and healthcare
 Both provider compliance and a positive doctor affect the patient relationship, which is the most important way to improve compliance
 , Although the high cost of prescription medication also plays a major
 gaiyr-anupaalan swasthya dekhbhaal ke prabhavi vitaran ke liye ek pramukh baadha he
 Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that approximately 50% of patients suffering from serious diseases living in developed countries follow these treatment recommendations
 vishesh rup se, madhumeh daron ko kam asthma ke liye upachaar kaa paalan karne ke liye or ucch raktchaap hai sochaa tha ki un paristhitiyon kaa boj kaaphi had tak maanav or aarthik yogadan karne ke liye
 Compliance rates may be underestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in formal clinical trial settings, but falls in the "real" setting
 anupaalan karne ke liye pramukh baadhaon main aadhunik dawa parhez kii jatilta, kharaab "sehat sakshartaa" or upachaar ke laabhon ke mansik bodh main kami, charchaa nahin kiye gaye dushprabhav, dawa parche kii laagat or apraveen sanchaar yaa rogi or swasthya-seva pradaata ke bich vishwaas kii kami shaamil hai
 Efforts to improve compliance are targeted toward simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and setting the number of medications
 aadhe se adhik rogi unako nirdeshit kiye gaye upachaar parhez kaa paalan nahin karte hai
 Until recently, this was called "noncompliance", which is sometimes interpreted to mean that instructions for treatment were not followed or deliberately ignored due to irrational behavior
 aaj, swasthya seva peshewar adhiktar "anupaalan " ke bajaay "avlamban " yaa "saamanjasy " shabdon kaa upyog parhez ke rup main karte hai, kyonki ye shabd un rogiyon ke vividh kaarnon kaa adhik sateek vivaran detaa he, jo upachaar nirdeshon ko nahin mantre hai yaa aanshik rup se maanate hai
 However, the preferred terminology still remains debatable
 kuch maamalon main, saamanjasy kaa upyog vishesh rup se un rogiyon kaa sandarbh dene ke liye kiya jaataa he jo upachaar parhez kaa paalan karte hai, jise chikitsak or rogi donon ke sahyog se banaaya jaataa he, taaki ise chikitsak dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye upachaar parhez kaa keval paalan karne se alag kiya ja sake
 Despite the ongoing controversy, the term adherence has been preferred by the World Health Organization, the American Pharmacists Association, and the US National Institute of Health Adherence Research Network
 saamanjasy anupaalan ko behatar banane ke liye upachaar prakriya main rogi ko shaamil karne ke liye vartmaan euke enechaes pahal kaa sandarbh detaa he
 In this situation, the patient is informed about their condition and treatment options
 ve yah nirnay lene main upachaar team ke saath sammilit hote hai kii koun si karrwai kerani he or team ko waapas pratikraya dene or nigaraanee karne ke liye aanshik rup se uttaradaayi bhi hote hai
 Compliance with treatment can be improved by: dablyuechao kaa anumaan he ki viksit deshon main gambhir rogon se peedit keval 50 % rogi hi upachaar anushansaaon kaa paalan karte hai
 It can affect the health of the patient and can affect the wider society when it causes complications from chronic diseases, obstructive infections, or the formation of untreated psychiatric disease
 baariki se nigaraanee kiye gaye adhyayan ke dauraan anupaalan dar saamanytah vaastavik-vishwa kii paristithiyon se ucch hote hai
 For example, one study reported a 97% compliance rate at the beginning of treatment with statins, but about 50% of patients had reported complaints after six months
 jab ek swasthya seva pradaata kisi rogi ke paas jaataa he, tab ho saktaa he ki vah rogi ke liye dawa kaa ek parchaa use de, lekin sabhi rogi farmesi par die gaye parche ko bhar nahin paaenge
 america main, 20-30% farmesi main ke nuskhe kabhi nahin bhare jate hai
 There are many reasons why patients do not fill drug prescriptions, including cost of medication, doubt about the need for medication, or prioritizing their own care parameters over medication
 dawa ke nuskhe kaa paalan na kiye jane main sabase badi baadha uski laagat he
 a 2001 nationwide survey of 1010 adults in the US found that 22% of people did not want to file because of its value, which is equivalent to a 20–30% overall rate of non-filing
 shuru karne ke baad, shaayad hi kabhi marijon ne nirdeshit upachaar parhez ko puraa kiya ho or shaayad hi kabhi upachaar ke course ko hi puraa kiya ho
 Understanding of costs and treatment instructions are major barriers to not completing treatment
 jaisaa ki pehle ullekith kiya gaya he, vishwa swasthya sanghathan kaa anumaan he ki keval 50% log jeern bimariyon ke liye nirdhaarit kiye gaye lambey samay tak chalane vaale upachaar ko puraa karte hanjo rogi ke swasthya ko jokhim main daal detaa he
 Several types of packaging methods are said to help the patient complete the prescribed treatment
 in tareekon main khuraaq ke aahaar ko yaad rakhane main aasaan banane vaale swaroop, saath hi nirdeshon ke prati marij kii samaj badhaane ke liye vibhinn label shaamil hai
 For example, medicines are sometimes packaged with a reminder system for the time of day and / or scheduled week to take the medication
 aushadh-chikitsa kaa rogi dwaara paalan kiye jane main sahaayta karne ke uddeshy se, ek gaiyr-laabhakaari sanghathan aushadyeey udhyam, packenging udhyam or pratinidhi, european rogi sanghathan ke bich set ap kiya gaya tha

 In the British political concept, the sovereign of Britain is regarded as the human incarnation of the Rajmukut, that is, they are the ultimate source of total authority of the entire state and the whole system, and the British sovereign ultimately has the right to rule over Britain

 However, in governing, policy making and administrative decision making, the substantive contribution of the court is minimal and nominal, as the various historical constitutions and conventions make most of the supremacist powers of the ruler from the crown to ministers and officials or other institutions of the crown
 Passes have been delegated

 Therefore, even today, rulers exercise the right to summon and dissolve the Parliament
 2011 main paarit phixd-turm paraliyaments act ne sansad bhang karne ke ashikaar ko khatm kar diya
 However, the ruler still has the right to perform the suntan
 yadi ek alpsankhyak sarkaar, sansad ko bhang kar nae chunaav ghoshit karne kii maang karti he, to shaasha aisi maang ko kaarij karne ke liye purnatah swatantra hai
 Ideally, the ruler can voluntarily demote the prime minister at any time, but in the current state the prime minister is expelled from office only in the event of death, or electoral defeat

 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he
 This post has no political meaning

 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707

 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories

 Spouses of Sovereigns, Disabilities: At least three of the following persons must be confirmed Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord High Advocate, and Protector of the Scrolls
 regency ko puraa karne ke liye, yah bhi ek hi teen vyaktiyon kii ek ghoshnaa kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Regency, when necessary, becomes the Regent following the proper line of succession; Parliamentary voting or some other treatment is needed
 regent, british naagarikta he, or britain kaa nivasee hona
 According to these rules, the only regent was the future George IV, who reigned when his father George III went mad
 haalanki, 1953 main regency ke adhinium kahata he ki agar rani ke uttaradhikari regency kii jarurat he, rajkumaar philip, edinburgh ke duk regent he

 Advisers of state requirements are doing the same as Regents
 vartmaan main, paanch rajyon ke parshadon: Parliament provides funds for most of the sovereign's government spending through parliamentary grants and public funds, known as the "citizen List"
 tathaa ek vaarshik anudaan, shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav tathaa rani kii aadhikarik yatraaon ke liye bhi aavantit kii jaati he
 Funds for most expenses, including staff costs, state visits, formal commitments, and official entertainment, are met by the civic list itself
 yah raashi sansad dwaara 10 varshon kii avadhi ke liye nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 By the year 1760, the financial requirements of the ruler were met by hereditary revenue, profits of crown assets
 1760 main raja jorge tritiy ne apane vanshanugat rajwan kaa parityag civil list ke liye karne kii sahmati de di, jo varsh 2012 tak rahaa
 At present, the amount of money received from Mukutia Estates is more than that given to the Civil List or other grants to the Adhrat
 is prakaar 2007-08 ke bich crown esteton ne rajkosh main £200 million kii vruddhi karwaai, jabaki sansad dwaara 40 lakh pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Thus, with a wealth of 7
3 billion pounds, crown assets are one of the largest landowners in Britain, these sari assets are placed under trust and the sovereign cannot deal with them voluntarily
 2012 ke baad se sansadeey anudaan or naagarik suchi ko mila kar ek sankukt samprabhu anudaan se badal diya gaya he
 Like the Mukutiyya estate, the land and properties of the Duchy of Lancaster have been placed under the royal trust
 yah sab shahi bhatte kaa hissaa he
 The revenue generated by this duchy is used for the "personal expenses" of the ruler, which are not borne by the citizen list
 isi prakaar cornwall kii dachi ek kshetra he, jise shaasha ke jyeshtha putr ke vishwash main, unke nijee kharchon hetu, aavantit kii gayi he
 The sovereign is eligible for indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 also income tax and capital gains tax
 is sandarbh main, naagarik suchi or sansadeey anudaan ko aay nahin mana jaataa he, kyonki unhi aadhikarik kaaryon ke liye diya jaataa he
 Estimates of the queen's total wealth, depending on whether the personal property is being counted or the property held by the ruler in the trust, may vary considerably
 udhaaharan ke liye, shahi sangrah adhirat kii nijee sampatti nahin he, lekin "crown collection trust", ek charity, dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa he
 Forbes magazine's 2008 estimate listed the Queen's personal assets as $ 650 million, but no official figures are available
 1993 main lord chemberlen ne kaha tha kii press main ghoshit, maharani kii nijee sampatti kaa £100 million kaa anumaan "behad atiranjit tha
 " adhirat kaa landan main aadhikarik nivas buckingham mahal he, jo aadhikarik nivas hone ke alaava adhiktar rajkeey va shahi samarohon kaa bhi mukhya sthal he
 In addition to this there is another royal residence, Windsor Castle, which is the largest domed palace in the world, which is mainly used on occasions like weekly holidays, Easter, etc
 scotland main samprabhu kaa aadhikarik nivas haulirud palace he, jo edinburgh main avasthit he
 It is used by the sovereign, on his Scottish travels
 paramparanusaar, samprabhu varsh main kamasekam ek saptaah ke liye haulirudehouse main nivas karte hai
 Historically the main residence of the Anglo Sovereign was the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London, until Henry VIII intervened in the Palace of the Whitehall
 1698 main bheeshan aag ke chalate whiteul mahal tabah ho gaya, jiske baad rajpariwaar saint james palace main shift ho gaya
 Although Buckingham Palace replaced St
 James Palace as the sovereign's main residence in 1837, St
 James Palace still holds the record of being a senior palace, and is still a hostile residence
 yah mahal aaj bhi uttaradhikaar parishad kaa sabha-sthal he tathaa ise rajpariwaar ke anya sadasyon dwaara bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other royal residences include the Clarence House and the Kensington Palace
 ye mahal rajmukut ke hai, or inhen mukut dwaara bhavi shaskaon ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 Sovereigns cannot voluntarily deal with these palaces

 The imperial kulank of the United Kingdom is a chauvinistic standard, in which: "the first and third chawls display three yellow horns on a red background; the second chawl has a lohit lion surrounded by two stripes on the yellow background, in the center; and the fourth chawl on a blue background
 a Harp has a performance ", a lion and a unicorn as a supporter, and a French-language motto on the strip:" Dieu et mon droit " Is shown
 kavach ko gherta hua ek garter he jisapar garter ke shaurykram kaa dhyey likhaa hota he:"honi soit qui mal y pense"
 In Scotland, the rulers use different types of kulank, in which the first and fourth sections represent Scotland, and in the second and second parts of England, Ireland is displayed
 isamen do dhyey pradarshit hote hai, neeche scotland ke dhyey "in Defens God me Defend" kaa ek chota bhaag "in Defens" pradarshit he tathaa thisal ke kram kaa dhyeyvakya "nemo me impune lacessit"; samarthak ke rup main ek singh or ek unicorn kavach samet do lambii talavaaron kaa samarthan karte hai, jinpar england tathaa scotland ke dhvaj fahre cote hai
 The official flag of the ruler is the royal standard, in which the royal kulanka is displayed
 is maanak ko samprabhu kii mezbaani kar rahe bhawan, pot, vimaan yaa vaahan par pradarshit kiya jaataa he, logon ko samprabhu kii upastithi se aagaah karne ke liye
 The royal standard is never unfurled, as it is never the case that a ruler is absent, because the crown prince becomes a ruler as soon as a ruler dies
 jab shaasha apane mahal main upasthit nahin hote he, tab buckingham palace, windsor kasal or sanderingham house main british dhvaj fahraaya jaataa he, or scotland main sthit mehalon, haulirud pales or balamoral pales main scotland ke shahi maanak ko fahraaya jaataa he

 Lactation or lactation or lactation describes the process of weaning the milk from the mammary gland, the process of feeding that milk to the baby, and the time it takes for a mother to breastfeed her baby
 yah prakriya sabhi maadaa stanpayi praaniyon main hoti he or manushyon main ise aam taur par stanpan yaa nursing kaha jaataa he
 In most species milk is released from the mother's nipples; However, milk is released from the stomach ducts of the platypus
 stanpayi praaniyon kii keval ek prajati dayak fruit chamagadad main doodh utpann karnaa nar kaa ek saamaanya kaary he
 Males can produce milk due to an imbalance of hormones in some other mammals
 is ghatana ko navjaat shishuon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he )
 Galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production
 is charan main prolactin or oxitosin kii jarurat padati he
 The main function of lactation is to provide nutritional and immune protection to children after birth
 lagbhag sabhi stanadhariyon main, lactation baanjhapan kii ek avadhi ko janm detaa he jo santan ke jivit rahane ke liye ishtatam janm antaraal pradaan karne kaa kaam karata he
 From the fourth month of pregnancy, the female or female body produces hormones that stimulate the development of the milk duct system in the breasts: garbhavastha ke paanchaven yaa chhathwein maheene tak stan doodh utpann karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 Lactation can also be induced without pregnancy
 garbhavastha ke uttarardh main mahila yaa maadaa ke stan lactogenesis ke pratham charan main pravesh karte hai
 This occurs when colostrum is formed in the breast, which is a thick and sometimes yellowish fluid
 is charan main projesterone kii atyadhik maatra kii vajah se doodh utpaadan main kaaphi rukawat aati he
 It is not a medical concern if colostrum starts coming out of the breast of a pregnant woman before she gives birth to her baby and it is not a sign of future milk production
 janm ke samay prolactin kaa str ooncha rahata he jabaki garbhanal ke prasav ke parinamswaroop projesterone, estrogen or echpiel ke staron main achaanak giravat aa jaati he
 a sudden drop in progesterone in the presence of a high prolactin level leads to a fairly abundant milk production in the second phase of lactogenesis
 stan ke uttejit hone par rakt main maujuud prolactin kaa str badhane lagata he or lagbhag 45 minute main kaaphi upar chalaa jaataa he or lagbhag teen ghante baad doodh pilaane kii avasthaa main aane se pehle iskaa str waapas neeche gir jaataa he
 The release of prolactin stimulates the cells of the airway, causing milk to form
 prolactin stan ke doodh main bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Some research has shown that the quantity of prolactin in milk is very high at the time of excessive milk production and when the breast is full of milk it is less and its high level from two o'clock to six o'clock in the morning
 There is a possibility of mukhya rup se insulin, thyroxin or cortisol jaise anya hormone shaamil hote hai lekin abhi tak unki bhoomikaaon ke bare main puri jaankaree nahin mili he
 Although biochemical markers indicate that Phase II of lactogenesis begins about 30 to 40 hours after giving birth, but mothers typically breastfeed for 50 to 73 hours after giving birth
 Does not feel full
 apni maan ke stan se doodh pine vaale bachche ko sabase pehle doodh ke rup main colostrum praapt hota he
 It contains a much larger amount of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and in particular, has a high level of immunoglobulin A, which acts to cover the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and invade microbes from the baby's system

 sravi iga se khaadya allergy ko rokane main bhi madad milti he
 The production of colostrum for the first two weeks after birth gives the breast milk the opportunity to mature slowly
 hormonal endocrine niyantran tantra, garbhavastha or janm dene ke baad pehle kuch dinon ke dauraan doodh utpaadan ko prerit karti he
 The autocrine control mechanism functions when the milk supply reaches a more robust state
 is charan ko lactogenesis kaa tritiy charan kehete hai
 During this stage, the more milk is produced from the breasts, the more milk is produced in those breasts
 shodh se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki puri tarah se stanon se jitna zyada doodh nikalataa he, doodh utpann hone kii dar utani hi adhik ho jaati he
 In this way, the milk supply has a huge impact on how often the baby drinks milk and how well the milk gets out of the breast
 kam aapurti kii pahchaan aksar nimna baton se kii ja sakati he: The release of the hormone oxytocin results in a milk ejection or retraction reaction
 oxitosin stan ke aasapaas kii mansapeshiyon ko uttejit kar detaa he jisase stan se doodh nikalne lagata he
 Feeding mothers have described the feeling of breastfeeding differently
 kuch maataaon ko maamuli jhunjhuni kaa ehsaas hota he jabaki anya maataaon ko khub zyada dabaav yaa halkaa dard / bechaini kaa ehsaas hota he or aisi bhi kuch maatayen hai jinhen kuch alag mahasoos hi nahin hota
 The abandonment response is not always particularly consistent initially
 doodh pilaane kaa vichaar aane par yaa kisi bachche kii awaz sunai dene par yah riflex arthath pratikriya uttejit ho sakati he jisaki vajah se na chaahate hue bhi doodh kaa risaav hone lagata he yaa us vakt bhi donon stanon se doodh nikal saktaa he jab shishu kisi ek stan se doodh pi rahaa hota he
 However, such and other types of problems often go away after two weeks of weaning
 tanaav yaa chintaa kii vajah se doodh pilaane main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Poor milk ejection response can be caused by a number of reasons, such as - wound or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma
 If a mother has difficulty in feeding, then she can be helped in many different ways that prove helpful in the milk ejection reaction
 in tareekon main shaamil hai: kisi parichit yaa aaramdaayak sthaan main doodh pilaanaa, stan yaa peeth kii maalish, yaa kisi kapade yaa snaan aadi ke madhyam se stan ko garm karnaa
 The increase of oxytocin may potentially stimulate the milk ejection reaction and may also cause uterine contractions
 doodh pilaate samay maataaon ko is tarah ke sankuchan kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he jise afterpens kehete hai
 It can also experience a lot of problems such as cramps, from minor discomfort to contractions, and may worsen with other and later children
 kuch mahilaon ke stan suukh or chatak jate hai or unamem khuli daraaren bhi pad jaati hai or doodh pilaane ke dauraan unase khun bhi nikal saktaa he
 Rubbing lanolin on the nipples and areola can relieve these problems
 jo mahila garbhvatee nahin he us mahila main "kritrim rup se" or jaanboojhkar doodh utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 This does not necessarily mean that the woman is pregnant and she can do this job well even in the post-menopausal period
 jo mahila kabhi garbhvatee nahin hui he vah bhi kabhi-kabhi doodh pilaane laayak kaaphi pariman main doodh utpann karne main sakasham hoti he
 This is called "induced lactation" ie "release of milk when excited"
 jin mahilaon ne pehle bhi stanpan karaayaa he unamem phir se doodh kaa nikalnaa shuru ho saktaa he
 This is called "reallocation" ie "re-milking"
 isi tarah se aam taur par ek poorak nursing system yaa kuch anya prakaar kii poorakta se shuru karne vaali kuch dattakagrahi maatayen stanpan kara sakati hai
 It is believed that there is little or no difference in the composition of milk whether the release of milk is artificially induced or as a result of pregnancy
 shaareerik uttejnaa or dawaaon dwaara bhi doodh nikal saktaa he
 In theory, milk can also be extracted only by sucking the nipples with great patience and persistence
 iske liye niples ko lagaataar uttejit karnaa pad saktaa he or inhen uttejit karne ke liye stan ko dabaanaa yaa vastav main chusane kii jarurat padati he or doodh ke bahaav ko badhaane ke liye stanon kii maalish kerani padati he or unhen nichodna padataa he
 Temporary use of galactagogue drugs is also effective; Galactagogue herbs may also prove useful
 ek baar sthapit ho jane par jarurat ke mutabiq doodh nikalnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 In addition, some couples may also use lactation for sexual purposes

 Communication is the process of sending information to the sender of the receiver, in which a medium is used to convey the information so that both the sender and the recipient can understand the information conveyed
 It is a process by which animals can exchange information through different mediums
 There is a demand of communication that all parties can understand the common language which has been exchanged, Mediums are dialect, song and sometimes tone of voice and non-verbal, physical mediums such as physical gestures, gestures, even language, touch, eye contact or writing are the definitions of communication - an action by which meaning In an effort to create a common understanding of representation and communication, this process requires a repertoire of number skills, inter-personal and inter-personal processing, Un observing, speaking, questioning, sanchaar kai staron par, kai alag alag tareekon se hota he or adhiktam praaniyon ke liye, saath hi kuch mashiinon ke liye bhi 
yadi samast nahin to adhiktam adhyayan ke kshetra sanchaar karne ke liye dhyaan ke ek hisse ko samarpit karte hai, isliye jab sanchaar ke bare main baat kii jaae to yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki sanchaar ke kis pahalu ke bare main baat ho rahi he
 Definitions of communication range wide, some recognize that animals can communicate with each other and humans, and some are limited and include only humans within the parameters of human symbolic interaction

 a typical example is called the speech act
 In the presence of communication noise on this transmission channel, source realization and decoding can be faulty and thus The type of speech act can be desired with the expected result
 The problem with this code writer - transmission - receipt - encroachment sample is that it appears that both the code writer and the scribe have some tool that works as a code book
 And this code book is definitely like AX if not AX
 haalaan ki code kitaab jaisaa is model main kuch vivakshit he, veh darasal he nahin or is kaaranvash sankalpanaatmak baadhaaen aati hain Principles of co-regulation Communication is described as a constructive and dynamic continuous response, as a discrete exchange of information in the rung

 Most human languages use sounds or expressions to help with communication with those around them
 There are thousands of human languages and they have many similarities, although these similarities also differ

 The origin of the word in the language of Pandurang is like διά as in the sense of flowing like a word) necessarily does not indicate that as humans have begun to use the word, the confusion between the prefix διά and δι-
 Due to this, it is understood that communication takes place only between two parties

 Human communication has necessarily been considered as a highly developed form of animal communication
 The study of animal communication which is called zoogeology or zoosemiotics 'it says, apart from human communication), ethics is a huge contribution in the development of social biology and animal understanding, it is quite clear why That humans are capable of interacting with animals, especially dolphins and other animals used in the circus, but these animals learn to learn special methods of communication
 Understanding animal communication and the animal state is a rapidly evolving field and the 21st century
 There have been revolutions in different areas of the world, such as personal symbolic names, animal feelings, animal civilization and learning and behavior which were considered long learned

 Fungi communicate for their growth and development, such as the formation of mycelia and excrete progeny
 In addition, fungi communicate with a variety of bacteria with their own and related species, and with non-fungal bacteria, especially extracellular organisms
 , Eucaryotes, Semio-chemicals used with plants and insects are of biotic origin and fungal organisms are specifically processed
 While the same chemical application does not provoke the fungal bacteria to process without being part of the biotic message, this means that the fungal bacteria have the ability to distinguish the molecules of a species from the biotic message
