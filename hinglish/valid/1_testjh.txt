 Squirrels are nocturnal

 In temperate regions, early summer is most difficult for squirrels because the seedlings of the sesame seedlings grow at that time and are not available for the squirrels to eat, apart from this there is no other source of food available at this time

 The living squirrels found at this time are divided into 5 sub-families, which consists of about 50 classes and 280 species
 gilahari kaa sarvaadhik purna jeevashm, hesperopits, chadronian ke samay kaa he or aadhunik udan gilahariyon ke saamaan he
 During the latest Eocene to Myocene, there were many squirrels that cannot be placed under the lineage of any living species today
 At least some of these, possibly the oldest, basel, were a type of "proto-squirrels"
 This type of ancient ancestral distribution and variation indicates that squirrels as a group originated from North America
 kabhi-kabhi milane vaale in alpagyaat jeevashmon ke atirikt, jivit gilahariyon kaa jativrutt atyant spasht v saral he
 They have three major lineages, one of which includes the Ratufinae
 isamen vah kuch gilahariyaan bhi shaamil hai, jo ushnkaribandheey asia main pai jaati hai
 The newly incubated small squirrel of tropical South America is the only surviving member of the Sciurilliane family
 tritiy vansh ab tak kaa sabase vishaal vansh he or anya sabhi up pariwaron ko sammilit karata he;iskaa vitaran lagbhag bahudeshiy he
 This supports the hypothesis that the common ancestors of squirrels found through all living and fossils lived in North America, since the same lineage appears to have originated — if, for example, assume that the birth of the squirrels If they were from Eurasia, the clues of their ancient lineages should be found from Africa, but looking at the African squirrels it seems that their The origin is quite modern
 gilahariyon ke mukhya samooh ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara anya up parivaar praapt honge
 The Schiurinae family includes flying squirrels and schiurini, which among others include American tree squirrels; The Sciurini were often seen as a separate family, but they are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae

 Whatever the case, the trifurcation of the main squirrel lineage is very convenient in biophysical and ecological terms, with two of the three subfamilies being roughly the same size, each containing around 70–80 species; The third family is twice the other two families
 skiurine ke antargat vrikshiya gilahariyaan aati hai, jo ki america or kuch seemaa tak uresia se hai
 In tropical Asia on the other hand, Kelosquirinae is the most diverse and includes axillary squirrels, but their formation is quite different and they look more "beautiful", which is probably due to the effect of their extremely colorful rows

 It is a famous poetic genre of Arabic literature which later became extremely popular in Persian, Urdu, Nepali and Hindi literature as well

 This Arabic word means to talk to women or about women

 Before this, the lion is called nausea

 The poet usually keeps his name in Makte

 a ghazal can have between 5 and 25 lions
 ye sher ek duusare se swatantra hote hai
 Sometimes more than one lion gives meaning
 aise sher kata band kehalaate hai
 The words rhymed in the lion of Ghazal are called kafia and the words repeated in the lions are called radif
 sher kii pankti ko misra kaha jaataa he
 Kafia occurs in both Egyptians of Malta and the latter line of Kafias in the second line of lions
 radif hameshaa kaafiye ke baad aata he
 Radif and Kafia can also be parts of the same word and can also be a lion without Radif that ends on the Kafiyya
 ghazal ke sabase achche sher ko shahe bait kaha jaataa he
 Such a collection of ghazals is called Diwan in which there should be at least one ghazal for every week
 urdu kaa pehla dewan shaayar kuli qutubashah he
 Ghazals are of two types based on rhyme - bhav ke aadhaar par bhi gazalen do prakaar kii hoti hai- Ghazals began as a poetic genre of Arabic literature
 arabi bhashaa main kahi gayi gazalen vastav main naam ke hi anuroop thi arthath usamen auraton se baaten yaa uske bare main baaten hoti thi
 After coming from Arabic to Persian literature, this genre remained unchanged at the level of craftsmanship, but in terms of the narrative, they overtook them
 unamem baat to daihik yaa bhautik prem kii hi kii gai kintu uske arth vistaar dwaara daihik prem ko aadhyatmik prem main badal diya gaya
 Arabic love became popular in Persian
 farsi ghazal main premi ko sadik or premika ko mabood kaa darja mil gaya
 Sufi seekers played a decisive role in giving Ghazal its form
 sufi sadhana virah pradhan sadhana he
 Therefore, in the Persian ghazals, the separation aspect took precedence rather than coincidence
 farsi se urdu main aane par bhi ghazal kaa shilpagat rup jyon kaa tyon sweekaar kar liya gaya lekin kathy bhartiya ho gaya
 But contrary to the common concept of North India, Indian ghazals originated in the Deccan during the Bahmani Sultanate where ghazals influenced by songs were written
 bhashaa kaa naam rekhta padaa
 Vali Dakani, Siraj Daud etc
 were the poets of this tradition who in a way carried forward the tradition of Amir Khusro
 dakkini urdu ke gazalakaaron ne arabi farsi ke badale bhartiya pratikon, kavy roodhiyon, evam saanskrithik prishthbhumi ko lekar rachana kii
 At that time, the language of royalty in North India was Persian, so when Ghazal came to North India, Persian influence on it started increasing
 gaalib jaise urdu ke shreshth gazalkaar bhi farsi gazalon ko hi mahatvapurn maanate rahe or urdu gajal ko farsi ke anuroop banane kii koshish karte rahe
 Later, during the Dawood era, the influence of Persian was somewhat reduced
 ikbaal kii aarambhik gazalen isi prakaar kii he
 Later, due to political conditions, the influence of Persian on the Urdu ghazals started increasing again

 Poverty line or poverty line is the level of income that a person is unable to meet his material needs due to low income

 If a person's income is less than 60 percent of the national average income, then that person can be considered to be living below the poverty line

 For example, the method of extracting the mean

 These technical changes will not only help in more accurate identification of the poor but will also ensure that no person who is not poor gets the benefit of the subsidy prescribed for the poor

 The partial eta class is generally greater than the eta square

 velupillai prabhakaran littey ke netaa tha
 Since the formation of the LTTE around 1975, he was known as the head of the world's most powerful guerrilla fighters
 18 may 2009 ko srilanka kii sena ne unhen maarane kaa daawa kiya he
 Prabhakaran was born on 26 November 1954 in Velvettithurai, a coastal town in Jaffna Island, Sri Lanka
 vah apane mata-pita kii chauthi or sabase choti santan tha
 Prabhakaran was mediocre in studies
 bachapan main uskaa swabhaav sharmila or kitabon se chipke rahane vaale bachche ke rup main tha
 Velupillai Prabhakaran, who had been a ruthless movement for the last three decades to demand a separate Eelam in Sri Lanka, was a firm fighter, but his opponents saw him as an ambitious who never tolerated dissidents
 'thambi' ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran ek sarkari adhikari kii chauthi santan tha, jisane bachapan main hi skool chhod diya tha
 Prabhakaran was greatly influenced by Napoleon and Sikandar Mahan and had read many of his books
 ek saakshaatkaar main prabhakaran ne iskaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Apart from these, Prabhakaran was also highly influenced by Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh
 ye donon bhartiya netaa british shashan ke viruddh hinsak sangharsh main vishwaas rakhte the
 Prabhakaran, distraught with Tamils in politics, employment and education, began attending political meetings and received martial arts training
 
 In Sri Lanka, Tamil Hindus are a minority and Christians live in the majority
 aaj tak shri lanka main tamil hinduo ko vot daalane tak kaa adhikaar nahin mila hua he
 Even in the Sri Lankan constitution it is clearly written that Tamil Hindus are second class citizens
 agar ham tamil hinduo par kiye gaay atyaachaaro ko bataane lag jaye to isi vakt hamaara pej band jaayegaa
 Imagine how horrifically Tamilo would have been slaughtered
 isi atyaachaar ke virodh main valipilai prabhakaran ne littey {libresan tiger of tamil ilm } kaa nirmaan kiya
 Hindu Tamils survived only two ways, die as a victim of the atrocities of Christians and die the other way, fighting for the sake of self-respect
 hindu tamilo ne doosraa rasta chunaa or prabhakaran kaa saath dete hue shri lanka ke saath yuddh ched diya
 The LTTE achieved tremendous success in the early decades and partly accepted the Sri Lankan defeat

 In response to which Prabhakaran kills Rajiv Gandhi
 agar us vakt prabhakaran kaa thoda bhi saath diya gaya hota to aaj hindu tamilo kaa ek alag desh hota or shri lanka se ji hajuri nahin kerani padati
 Because then the country of Tamils would have stood with us
 aaj bhi shri lanka main tamil hinduo ki sthiti dayaneey he
 Thambi sprang up in a small town in the northeastern region of Sri Lanka and introduced the 'tamil New Tiger' in 1972 with a group of young men to meet the demand for a separate 'homeland' for Tamils

 In 1975, he was accused of killing the mayor of Jaffna
 tamil vidrohiyon kii ore se ye pehali badi karrwai thi
 In the struggle of Tamil Eelam, more than 70 thousand people, including many Sinhalese and Tamil leaders, lost their lives
 bharat ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi bhi isi aatankwaad kii bhent chadh gaye
 Prabhakaran was responsible for the assassination of Sinhalese leaders President Premadasa, Damini Dishanayake and Ranjan Vijayaratne and liberal Tamil leaders Appapillai, Amirtalingam, Yogeshwaran and his wife and Foreign Minister Laxman Kadirgamar

 a logic gate or logic gate is a device whose output is a logical function of the current signals or earlier signals present at its input
 yah bhautik yukti ho sakati he yaa koi adarshikrut yukti
 Nowadays most semiconductor logic gates are used, but in theory they can also be made from electromagnetic relays, liquid logic, pressure logic, optical logic, molecules etc
 booleey logic se jin algorithm kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he unhen in bhautik geton se un algoridmon ko saakaar rup bhi diya ja saktaa he 
 Just as a door can be in two stages - 'open or closed', the output of a logic gate can also be 'high or low'
 logic get, and or or jaise saral bhi ho sakate hai or ek computor jitna jatil bhi
 a logic gate built using a diode is the simplest logic gate
 kintu iske keval AND tathaa OR get hi banaaye ja sakate hai, 'inwarter' nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Hence it can be called an 'incomplete logic family'
 invar sahit sabhi logic get banane main sakasham hone ke liye kisi prakaar ke pravardhak kii jarurat hogi
 Therefore, the use of relay, vacuum nozzles or transistors is indispensable to create a 'complete logic family'
 bipolar transistoron kaa prayog karke bana logic parivaar register-transistor logic kehalaata he
 This was used in early integrated circuits
 iske baad vibhinn drushtiyon se sudhaar karte hue diod-transistor logic or transistor-transistor logic aaye
 Now almost all the transistors have been replaced by MOSFET, which causes less IC to occupy and less energy to work
 vartmaan main prayukt logic parivaar kaa naam complimentry metal-oxide-semiconductor he
 The output of a three-stage logic gate has three different states
 ye hai - hai, lo or hai impidence 
 From the point of view of high intensity, there is no role
 kintu apane hai impidence vaali avasthaa ke kaaran in yuktiyon kaa upyog data bas par vibhinn yuktiyon se data bhejne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Except for the device which is sending data to the bus, all other devices connected to that bus are converted to 'high Impedance State'
 is prakaar ye anya yuktiyaan ek prakaar se bas se judi hokar bhi usase alag hai kyonki bas or inke output ke bich 'hai impidence' maujuud he
 There are two types of rational gates - combinational logic and sequential logic
 sangyojan tark kaa output uske inputon kii vartmaan avasthaa par hi keval nirbhar karata he na ki unki pehle kii avasthaa yaa avasthaaon par
 In other words, it can be said that they do not have memory
 iske kuch udhaaharan hai - binary aidar, incoder, dicoder aadi
 Logic gates can also be used for data storage
 iske liye ltch paripath yaa 'flip-flop' kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 When multiple flip-flops are added in parallel, multi-bit data can be stored in it
 ise register kehete hai
 a type of 'memory' exists in a system consisting of flip-flops
 isi liye inase computor kii memory banaayi jaati he
 There are many types of memory of a computer
 keval NOR yaa keval NAND kaa prayog karke kisi bhi anya logic get kaa kaam liya ja saktaa he
 Therefore these logic gates are called 'universal logic gate'
 keval AND, yaa keval OR, yaa keval NOT geton kaa prayog karke icchaanusaar koi bhi logic falan banane sambhav nahin he
 Therefore AND, OR and NOT gates are not universal logic gates

 chikitsa shaastra main, pradaahak antra rog ) brihadantra or choti aant kii pradaahak dashaon kaa ek samooh he
 The main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
 ibidi ke pramukh rup hai krohan rog or vranmay brihadantrashoth
 Forms of IBD with very few cases for calculation, which are not always classified as specific IBD, are: krohan rog or yusi main mukhya antar sthaan or pradaahak parivartanon kii prakruti he
 Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, although most cases begin with the marginal ileum
 iske vipareet, vranmay brihadantrashoth brihadantra or malashay tak samit rahata he
 Template: Pathophysiology in CD vs
 UC superficially covers the ulcerative colitis up to the mucosa, while Crohn's disease affects the entire intestinal wall
 ant main, krohan rog or vranmay brihadantrashoth vibhinn anupaaton main bahirantrik abhivyaktiyaan prastut karte hai
 Rarely, neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis can be definitively diagnosed due to the characteristic eccentricities in presentation
 is sthiti main, anishchit brihadantrashoth kaa nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Although it is a recognized definition, not all centers accept it
 saanchaa:symptoms in CD vs
 UC While there are very different diseases, both can present any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and various related complaints or diseases such as arthritis, inflammatory dermatitis, and primary sclerosis
 They are usually diagnosed by biopsy with biology of pathological lesions

 UC Template: Treatment in CD vs
 The optimal treatment for UC inflammatory bowel disease depends on its form
 udhaaharan ke liye, mesalajin krohan rog kii tulana main vranmay brihadantrashoth main adhik upyogi he
 In general, depending on the level of severity, immunosuppression may be required to control symptoms in IBD, such as prednisone, TNF inhibition, azathioprine, methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine
 More commonly, the treatment of IBD requires the form of mesalazine
 aksar rog ke failane par niyantran ke liye steroid kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jo ek samay rakrakhaav dawa ke rup main sweekaarya the
 Biological colitis patients, such as TNF inhibitors, have recently been used in patients with Crohn's disease for many years
 gambhir maamalon main shalyakriya kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, jaise antra uchhedan, akunchan sandhan yaa ek asthai yaa sthai brihadantrachhidrikaran yaa sheshantrachhidrikaran

 Treatment is usually initiated with medications with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone
 ek baar pradaah safaltaapurvak niyantrit ho jaataa he, to rogi ko aam taur sudhaar hone ke liye halki dawaaon, jaise asakol, ek mesalamin par sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he
 If unsuccessful, a combination of the above immunosuppressive drugs with a mesalamine may or may not be given, depending on the patient
 oothkaplavika dwaara vish utpann kiye jate hai, jinke kaaran histoplasmosis naamak antra rog hota he, jo ek ibidi ke lakshanon vaale pratirakshakatahin rogi ke liye ek gambhir chintaa kaa kaaran he
 Antibacterial drugs, such as nystetine and either itraconazole or fluconazole have been suggested for the treatment of IBD diseases with similar symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, fever, and stomachache, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
 nimnlikhit upachaar ranneetiyon ko niyamit nahin kiya gaya he, lekin pradaahak antra rogon ke adhiktar roopon main ye aashajanak dikhaai padati hai
 Preliminary reports suggest that "worsening therapy" can not only prevent but also cure IBD: Feeding approximately 2,500 eggs of the worm Suis worm twice a month has markedly reduced symptoms in many patients
 yah bhi anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki kam umr main cocktail ke antargrahan se ek prabhavi "pratirakshan" prakriya viksit kii ja sakati he
 Antibiotics and biologists have shown increasing hope in the treatment of IBD, and some studies have proven that they are as effective as prescription drugs
 2005 main new scientist ne bristol bristol vishvavidhyalay or bath vishvavidhyalay ke ibidi main bhaang kii drishy upachaaratmak shakti par ek sanyukt adhyayan ko prakashit kiya
 This report indicated that cannabis reduces IBD symptoms, indicating the possibility of the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules of plant-borne chemicals
 sibi1 cannabinoid abhigraahak - jo mastishk main maujuud hone ke liye jane jate hai - aanton ke astr kii antatstar koshikaon main pahate hai, yah sochaa gaya he ki ve kshatigrast hone par aanton ke astr kii marammat main shaamil hote hai
 The team deliberately destroyed the cells to generate inflammation in the intestinal lining and was then given synthesized cannabinoids; The result was that the lining of the lining started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and came back to fill the cracks
 It is believed that in a healthy stomach, natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endogenous cells when injured and then bind to CB1 receptors
 is prakriya se ghaav bharne kii ek abhikriya aarambh hoti dikhaai detii he or jab log bhaang kaa prayog karte hai, isi prakaar kaunabinoid in abhigrahakon se baddh ho jate hai
 Previous studies have shown that CB1 receptors on the nerve cells in the stomach react to cannabinoids by slowing intestinal motility, thus reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea
 dal ne ibidi peediton kii aanton main anya kainaniboid sibi2 kii bhi khoj kii, jo swasth aaton main maujuud nahin hote
 ye abhigraahak jo bhaang ke rasayanon se bhi pratikriya karte hai, apoptosis - kramadeshit koshika mrityu - ke saath bhi sambaddh prathit hote hai or atikriyasheel pratiraksha pranali kaa daman karne tathaa atirikt koshikaon kaa safaya karke pradaah ko kam karne main bhi inaki bhoomika ho sakati he
 While ibds may limit quality of life due to pain, vomiting, diarrhea and other socially unacceptable symptoms, they are rarely fatal in themselves

 New evidence suggests that patients with IBD are at higher risk of intra-articular dysfunction and cyclic artery disease

 In all likelihood, an intense resurgence of the original symptoms may be seen, this is known as a "flare-up"
 paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he ki yah apane aap dur ho saktaa he yaa dawa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The time between two flare-ups can range anywhere from weeks to years and varies wildly between patients - some have never experienced flare-ups

 Static electricity means electric charge created on the surface of an object
 yah sthir aavesh us vastu par tab tak upasthit rahete he jab tak ki yah bhoomi main naa bah jaayen yaa phir yah niraveshan dwaara anavisht naa ho jaye
 Whenever two surfaces come in contact with each other or separate, there is a transfer of charge, but if one of the two surfaces has a high resistance to electric current, the static charge remains the same
 ham main se adhiktar log sthir vidyut ke prabhaavon se parichit hai kyonki ham ise anubhav kar sakate hai, jab kisi aaweshit vastu ko kisi vidyut chaalak yaa phir vipareet dhruvata ke ucchaveshit kshetra ke nikat laayaa jaataa he to ham us chingaari ko dekh or sun sakate hai jo atirikt aavesh ke anavisht hone ke kaaran utpann hoti he

 Hence, the Sikhs organized themselves into two parties - the Budha Dal and the Tarun Dal
 buddha dal kaa netritv kapur singh or tarundal kaa netritv deepasingh ke haathon main tha
 Both these parties used to harass local officials when they came out of their hiding places
 inhone apni bikhri hui shakti ko sangathit kiya
 The Tarun Dal was divided into five batches with the following leaders: deepasingh shahid Karam Singh and Dharam Singh, Amritsar khansingh or vinod singh, goindwal Dasundha Singh, Kot Budha biru singh or jeevansingh
 When Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded Punjab from Afghanistan, the Sikhs got a good opportunity to organize themselves on a firm basis
 unhone sarhind or lahore par adhikaar kar liya
 Between 1748 and 1765, the five batches of the Budha and Tarun parties spread rapidly and formed a number of states, known as precedents
