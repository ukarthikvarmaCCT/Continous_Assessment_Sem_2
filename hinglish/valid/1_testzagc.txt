 Now-a-days, "elegy" contains poems which relate to the mourning of the demons or in which soulful light is thrown on the fleetingness of life or the impermanence of past splendor
 parantu pracheen greece main iske atirikt bhi anya samayik vishyon kaa eleji main samavesh hota tha, aisi kavitaaon main kavi ke vyaktigat bhav utsav ke avasaron par jaise yuddh, prem, raajnneeti tathaa darshanik upadesh shrotaaon ke samaksh baansuri ke lay ke saath gaakar sunaae jate the

 yah sainik kavi the or inke naatakon main ojasvi style ke saath hi kalpana kii unchi udaan tathaa pragadh deshprem or atoot dharmik vishwaas paae jate hai
 The primacy is poetic and the dramatic element is secondary
 aristij tathaa primethyus sambandhi inke naatak vishesh prasiddh hai
 The central place in the development of the Greek grief is that of Isophilus's successful rival, Seafoclees, who expanded the scope of dramatic elements, especially dialogue, by including the third character
 inke naatakon main maanav tathaa alokik tatwon kaa kalatmak saamanjasy he or inke paatr, jaise idipas or aitigon, asaadhaaran vyaktitv ke hote hue bhi, manvochit visheshtaon se paripurna he

 The Dirian people had an important role in the development of the Sukhanta drama, but its elevation is related to Etika because the field of Aristophaniz, the ardent promoter of the ancient Greek Sukhaat drama, remained athens
 is nirbhik naatakkaar ne isa purv 427 se lekar 40 varsho tak aise sukhaant naatakon kaa srijan kiya jinamein svachhand kalpana kii udaan ke saath saath kavy kii madhurata, nirikshan kii tivrata tathaa vyangon kii vidagdhta kaa ascharyajanak sammishran hai
 In these Sukhanta, "bird", "bhek", "cloud", "nights" and often individuals are attacked

 Aflatoon and his disciple Aristotle were philosophers as well as literary critics

 is nae centre ke lekhak tathaa vidvan yunaan ke lekhakon se prabhavit tathaa anupranit the or visheshkar vigyaan kshetra main unka kaary vishesh saraahneey hua

 falswaroop puraane sahitya kii vyakhya ke saath saath bahut se granthon kii visheshtaon kii raksha sambhav hui
 The development of new elements in the poetry of this period is clear, but it is also evident that the scope of the poem has become narrower and the poem began to be written not for the public but for the experts

 This composition is counted among the famous texts of the world and it has significant historical elements notwithstanding, but more important is the art of characterization and interesting story which has made it an invaluable gem of its field
 isi yug main greek gadhy sahitya ne katipay upanyaason kaa srijan kiya jo romance ke naam se prasiddh hai kyonki jivan kaa yatharth rup prastut karnaa inkaa mukhya dhyey nahin he or yatharthata kalpana tathaa atiranjan or ascharyajanak ghatnaon se dabakar mritpraaya ho gai he

 The Greek poetry of this era is dominated by originality and liveliness, and most of the poems are of the ordinary category
 parantu lusian i

 Among his works, "phaleris" and "dialogue of the Dead" are particularly notable
 dialaag vyangy chitron se bharaa he or usamen maanav jati ke vicitra karnaamon par tikaa tippanee prastut kii gai he tathaa narak main avateern mritatmaon kii acchhee jivan jhaanki milti he
 In all these works, the behavior of Dhanikas and the writer's hatred and harsh criticism towards his views is an automatic proof
 is tarah lusian kii pratibha vyangatmak katutaa se prerit thi or unka vyangy samakaleen janajivan tak hi simit nahin tha
 He severely criticized all religious movements, ancient and contemporary, and also ridiculed the gods and their miracles in works like Dialogues of the Gods and towards the Syriac Goddess
 is tarah lusian greece kii puraani pravriti kaa hi pratinidhi nahin apitu uske samast sahitya kaa pratinidhi tha

 The leaders and saints of the Greek Church and its subordinate centers began to analyze and analyze religious and spiritual problems and feelings through this language
 dharmik rachanaaon main kuch to vyaakhyaatmak or upadeshaatmak hai, jaise "sant paal ke prasiddh patr" or kuch kaa sambandh vyavastha tathaa sanghathan se he, jaise "first epsil ov kaleement", parantu adhikansh vyaakhyaatmak hai, jaise "ipsil ov barnwas"
 The literary elements in these compositions are secondary, but the serious writings of Alexandria's famous church-fathers Clement and Origen are impressive examples of literary style as well as literary genius
 aitihaasik drushti se sarvaprasiddh granth sijera dwaara likhit "acleziastical history" he jo tatkaaleen carch itihaas kaa pramanik granth he
 The medieval Christian writers began the process of establishing the harmony of ancient Greek philosophy and religion with their new and progressive religion through the Greek language and style
 iske falswaroop puraani style ke bahut se tatwon kaa punarjanm hua or aflatoon tathaa arestu ke mukhya siddhanton ko isai dharamshastra main sammanpurn sthaan mila
 a strong supporter of this new ideology was the religious writer of "byzantium" who was completely inspired by Greek literature and philosophy
 isi dharmik centre se un geetkaavyon ko protsaahan mila jo carch main vividh puja tathaa tyoharon ke avasaron par gaae jate the or aaj tak "litargi" tathaa "him" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 These lyric poetry follow a new rhyme system, discarding the old rhyme tradition, and there is an astonishing variation in their external forms
 parantu bhashaa itani lacheelee he ki bina kisi vishesh prayaas ke un sabhi bhinn roopon kaa upyukt saadhan ban jaati he
 The best development of these songs was in the series of religious songs known as "canon" and whose best promoter was Saint John of Damascus
 is tarah kii kavitaayen shatabdiyon tak likhi jaati raheen or inamen shabd tathaa sangeet praaia: samprukt hai
 With this came the emergence of another new literature which was related to the life and miracles of Christian saints

 The origin of these popular texts is the "biography" of Egypt's Sat Athani, whose author is believed to be a fourth-century saint Athanasius
 aadhunik greek sahitya ke sarvapradhan ang aise padya, lekh tathaa kavy hai jo sarsaadhaaran main prachlit bhashaa main likhe gaye
 The language that is popularly known as "demotic Greek" as opposed to classical
 inamen adhikansh loakgeet kii shrenee main aate hai or lokajeevan ke utaar chadhaav ke pratibimb hai
 The main inspiration of these songs is cosmic and their recollection recounts the mythology prevalent in the golden age of Queen Elizabeth I, in which youthful exuberance, nature love and exquisite lips in Sura Sundari as well as melodious agony, which is the transience of physical pleasure beauty Originates from is panrapara main kuch aise kavy bhi hai jinka mahatv aitihaasik he or udgam-strot tatkaaleen durghatnaayen; udhaaharan ke liye ham un lokgeeton ko le sakate hai jo kustutuniya ke patan par shok tathaa uske rakshakon ke saahas tathaa shaury par santosh prakat karte hai
 The authors have little connection with this abundant poetry

 In addition, the other famous part of modern Greek literature is the one on which the impression of Western Europe is deep

 apane "rotocritas" naamak lokapriy upanyaas main yah madhyayugin romance ko aadhunik mode dene main safal hue hai
 The emergence of this new literature in Crete was only for 50 years because the glory of literature also ended with the fall of Crete in 1669 AD, although it had considerable influence on later Greek literature
 18veen shatabdi kaa uttarardh greece kii raajnneetik jagriti kaa sangharshkaal tha
 The question of the national language was also considered in this period

 After several unsuccessful attempts in this struggle, the popular language finally came to victory and the main credit for this victory is "dionysius Silomons", the best poet of modern Greece, who proved that language can be a successful medium of high quality
 20veen shatabdi ke aarambh tak padya tathaa gadhy isi madhyam se likhe jane lage, jisase is bhashaa kaa paryaapt vikaas tathaa parimarjan hua

 alleged mutation utparivartan kii paribhaasha karte hue batalaaya gaya he ki utparivartan kisi spishiz ke anuvanshik padaarth main utpann gatisheel rasinic parivartan kaa naam he
 These changes occur in the structure and number of chromosomes
 at: is drushti se kisi jin kii aanvik sanrachana parivartan ko "jin utparivartan" kahenge
 However, when such changes are reflected in a particular or a fragment of a chromosome, they will be called "point mutations"
 vastut: in donon prakaar ke parivartanon main koi vishesh bhed nahin hota, at: in donon padon kaa paryaay, roopon main ullekh kiya gaya he
 Mutations are instantaneous, so they are also called "instantaneous mutations"
 bindu utparitarvan ati sookshm hote hai or unka prabhaav sampurna jeev parivartan par nahin padataa
 Hence the term mutation is generally used for point mutation only
 kisi manushya kii janan koshika main jin utparivartan hone par yah uske yugmanaj main sthanantarit ho jaataa he or is prakaar in cobikaon dwaara utpann nai peedi tak pahunch jaataa he
 As a result of numerous cell-divisions, mutation genes also become effective for a particular trait or trait, producing their own copies

 But such mutations are less visible than latent mutations
 parantu jahaan tak manushya main hue utparivartanon kaa prashn he, aise utparivartan adhiktar prabhavi ho batalaaye gaye hai
 Gender-associated mutations are more common in heterozygous males because they contain dominant sex-linked genes

 If ineffective mutations occur in the gonads, then future offspring will be heterozygous
 alingsutri aprabhavi utparivartan ek baar jab utpann ho jate hai, to kai pidiyon tak dikhalaai hi nahin dete
 But if these mutations are sex-linked, they become effective in the next generation itself
 pranaghatak utparivartanon ko adhiktar aprabhavi yaa prasupt mana jaataa he
 If the fatal mutations enter the gonads, then the future progeny will be heterozygous

 One thing is clear from this that if the temperature increases even by 10 degrees, the rate of mutation doubles or triples
 is prasang main ek manoranjak baat yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki tapakram main vruddhi dwaara hi nahin, apitu atishay nunata dwaara bhi utparivartan prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Keeping the eggs of the Drosophila millenogaster for three days at -6 degrees heat, it was observed that within 25 to 40 minutes the rate of lethal mutations in their x and II chromosomes tripled

 computer vigyaan main ek software sarthak kramadeshon or zaruri soochnaaon kaa ek aisa tantra he jo computer ke yantransh or duusare softwaron ko aadesh dekar kramadeshak kaa manachaaha kaam karata he
 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer

 Seven types of intellectual property rights are discussed in TRIPS
 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software
 software ko patent karaane kaa mudda vivaadaaspad he tathaa kuch kathin bhi
 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
