 Rajawade did not consider history as 'iti-ha-us' i
e
 those that did not happen
 unki manyata thi ki saidhantik pahaluon se saath itihaas ko samaaj-vigyaan hi mana jaae
 His view corresponds with that of Hegel that history is expressed in its true sense as a philosophy
 rajvaade ne shahji par likhe niabandh main maraathon ke shakti-lop ko punarsthapit karne hetu 'dialactis of difit' arthath haar ke dwandv par charchaa karte hue bataaya ki uttam, sudaul tathaa nishchit hathiyaar banane kii kala ke vikaas ke liye vaigyanik gyaan kii jo purv taiyaari aavashyak hoti he, vah us samay maharashtra main nahin thi
 Attacking the devotional poets, Rajawade told that when the thoughtful people like Dekart, Bacon etc
 in Europe, were encouraging those searching for various substances living in the creation, at the same time saint Eknath, Tukaram, Dasopant, Nipatniranjan etc
 Mahatma Panch was trying to show the path of Brahman interview by destroying the Mahabhutas

 iskaa pehla adhyay ‘stri-purush samagam’ main kai atipracheen arya prathaon kaa zikr tha
 It was first published in May 1923 in the magazine Chitrayajagat of Pune
 isamen veda samhita, mahabharat or harivansh ke uddharanon or saakshyon dwaara yah kaha gaya tha ki atyant pracheen arya samaaj main bhai-bahan or pita-putree ke bich shaareerik sambandh hote the
 How these unrestrained physical relationships developed further was the subject of this essay
 is pustak kaa doosraa adhyay ‘striyon kii vansh-pravartak shakti or prajapati sanstha’ main unhone yah dikhaaya ki kaise ek balak ko duusare se alag pahchaanane ke liye pita kii jagah maatrikul kaa naam diya gaya, kyonki tab stri-purush sambandh mili-jule hote the
 Also, Rajwade also shows in this that the genealogy before Prajapati Sanstha was under women and there were three results of Prajapati Sanstha's development as an ancient Arya Samaj
 pehla yah ki prajapati kul kii pruthak rup main sthapana kii prakriya shuru hui
 The second is that the practice of settling in distant countries started
 bahu-bharyak or ekapatik prajapati sanstha main kramagat rup se parivartan shuru hua
 The third chapter of this treatise in 'an Aryan practice of hospitality' as evidenced in the forty-fifth chapter of the industry festival of Mahabharata, 'ishtana Putraan Vibhavana Swaran Daran' means 'let your woman in distress also be offered to your friend with serene conscience' It was told that Indians never believed that there is a disincentive in giving self-woman to a friend
 iskaa samarthan panini ne dwigorluganapatye sutara main ‘dvyormitrayorpatyan dwaimitri’ arthath do mitron ke apaty yaa santati ko dwaimitri kah kar kiya he
 In this situation both friendships are given to paternity

 Also, in this, they have shown the process of historical development of monogamous marriage system in gender grouping of men and women
 is granth main kshepak rup main bhartiya vivaah sanstha ke itihaas vishay par rajvaade dwaara likhit tippaniyan ‘lagnsanstha ’ sheershak ke antargat sammilit kii gayin
 a reviewer, evaluating the Hindi version of the Indian Marriage Institution History, wrote that 'many mystics of our Renaissance were absorbed in the imagination of Swarnaloka in the distant past
 rajvaade unase bilkul alag the
 In the history of Indian marriage institution, they completely reverse the history hypothesis
 ve jo likhte hai uskaa nishkarsh kuch yah he ki satyuga or dwapar darasal pashavik, barbar or ardhamanviya sanskaron or naitik mulyon ke yug the or jin mahaan naitik mulyon par ham apana seenaa phulae rahete hai, ve kaliyug kii dein hai
 The form of Vedic and pre-vedic societies was something else, not the one which we consider fascination
 rajvaade kaa maanavshaastra, puraatatva or saanskrithik itihaas se juda bodh puraataniyon ko pachega nahin
 Where everything is considered divine and divine, the idea of social order created by the struggle and development of millions of years of human beings would seem strange but the royalty take away the land of the antiquities

 Seeing Cohen's achievements, he was awarded the Order of Canada, the highest civilian honor by the Government of Canada
 kohen ne 1950 ke dashak main bataur kavi or upanyaaskaar apana kariyar shuru kiya
 At the age of 33, he recorded his first music album
 kohen kaa janm canada ke ek madhyamvargeey yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 Cohen was only 9 years old when his father died
 kohan kaa parivaar ek rudhivaadee yahudee parivaar thi jisase kohen kaa jeevanaparyant rishta bana rahaa
 According to Cohen, his family was a descendant of Aaron, a prophet of Judaism

 Cohen's inclination as a student of literature was more towards the poems of Federico García Lorca
 schuli shiksha ke dauraan hi kohen ne sangeet siikhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Cohen's attachment to music was due to his mother
 unki maa ek behtareen lokgayika thim
 In March 1954, Cohen's first poem appeared in a magazine called Civ / N

 1960 ke dashak main sakriy sangeetkaaron or geet lekhakon main bob dylan ke baad leonard kohen duusare aise gayak the jinke bare main sangeet samikshakon ne jamkar likhaa
 Cohen gave up his career of writing literature for music practice

 When questioned about the struggle on which side he advocates, he replied that his roots may be Jewish but he is against the war
 carch shabd unani visheshan kaa apbhransh he jiskaa shabdic arth he "prabhu kaa"
 In fact, the Church is used in two ways; One is the building of the Lord that is the Church and the other is the organization of Christians
 carch ke atirikt 'kalisia' shabd bhi chalata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world
 baad main yah shabd girjaghar ke liye bhi prayukt hone laga
 Here the church will be considered in the sense of institution
 sabhi isai praaia: is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi carch kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many of their churches or organizations exist today, which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : In the early centuries of Christianity, little has been done about the definition and form of the Church
 bible main isa kii jeevani tathaa shiksha kaa jo varnan he usase spasht he ki prarambh hi se isaayiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki is ne samast maanav jati ke liye mukti ke sadhano ko sulabh kar diya or is uddeshy se prithvi par "ishwar kaa rajya" sthapit kiya
 The "kingdom of God" is a community of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus and receive his teachings
 bible main us samudaay ko "ishwar ko praja" kaha gaya he
 For his organization and rule, Jesus selected 12 disciples and gave them special teaching and authority and ordered them to go around the world to preach their teachings and baptize believers into the church
 is prakaar bible main isa ke anuyaayiyon ke samudaay ko carch, "ishwar kaa rajya" tathaa "ishwar kii praja" kaha gaya he
 From these positions it may appear that initially the actual form of the church has been considered limited to external organization, but this is not the case
 isa ne apni shiksha main isapar bal diya he ki unamem tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon main adrishy evam rahasyatmak ekta he
 He said to his disciples- "I take the vine and you are the branches
" " isse spasht ho jaataa he ki carch kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv aadhyatmik hi he
 Saint Paul has laid great emphasis on this spiritual and mystic aspect of the church
 isa tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon kaa aadhyatmik sambandh or isa ke sabhi anuyaayiyon kii rahasyamay ekta ko spasht karne ke liye unhone apane patron main barambar carch ko "isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir" kaha he 
 Hence, from the beginning both the external organization of the church and its spiritual form have been taken care of
 protestant dharm ke kaaran carch main foot padi to dharmacharya carch ke swaroop par adhik chintan karne lage
 Protestant scholars put more emphasis on the invisible form of the church and in response to the Catholic Church's outward organization of the church, its visible membership, etc
 is vivaad main unhone carch ke chaar bahari lakshanon kaa apekshaakrit adhik mahatv diya he
 The true Church of Christ is Catholic; One is, in the bondage of love, all its members believe in the principles of religion
 ek sanskaar, ek si pujanapaddati or ek hi parmadhikari kaa shashan sweekaar karte hai; pavitra he ; apozels he The visible organization of the church may also include some people who are hypocrites who have no spiritual connection with Jesus, who are not part of Jesus' spiritual body
 ishwar hi jaanata he ki koun carch kaa sachcha sadsy he or is kaaran yah mana ja saktaa he ki vaastavik carch adrishy hi he
 Even then, the sacraments are the essential condition of full membership of that invisible real church, so cannot be separated from the invisible church
 aajkal praaia: sabhi protetianst bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Even though full membership of the Church is required for salvation, it is not compulsory
 ishwar sabhi logon kii mukti chahta he or sab manushyon ke ant:karan main satprerana utpann karata he
 Those who follow the inspiration of God inadvertently become imperfect members of the Church invisibly and can achieve salvation provided by Jesus
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat isai sansar main carch kii ekta ke andolan ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga
 Consequently, in an effort to determine the true form of the church based on the elements existing in the Bible, excluding rebuttal, the emphasis is on the fact that the church is the spiritual body of Jesus
 isa uskaa sheersh he or sachche isai us sharir ke ang hai

 After the death of Jesus, his disciples started preaching Christianity among Jews and non-jews
 pratham mishnariyon main se sabase safal the sant paulus; unki yatraaon kaa varnan tathaa unke patr bibil ke uttarardh main surakshit hai
 At that time Antioch was the third city of the Roman Empire, Saint Peter, the successor of Christ, came here and from that center Saint Paul preached Christianity in Asia Minor, Macedonia and Greece

 There are many reasons for this success
 ek to us samay logon main prabal dharmajigyaasa thi, duusare isai dharm prayek maanav kaa mahatv sikhalaataa tha, chaahe vah das athwa stri hi kyon na ho
 Apart from this, people could not live without being influenced by the spirit of Christianity

 Although the Roman rulers viewed the new religion with skepticism from the beginning and persecuted its followers, it was only in the third century that a complete attempt was made to completely eradicate the Christian religion, especially Desius, Diocliction, In the reigns of the Muskminians and Gallerius

 In the civil war that ensued for the successor after the renunciation of Dioclution, Constantine was victorious and he gave freedom to all religions by taking out the edict of Milan in 313 AD
 us samay ariyas ke mat ke kaaran isai sansar main ashaanti failane lagi thi
 To overcome this, Constantine organized the first World Assembly of the Catholic Church; This assembly of Nicaea declared in opposition to Aureus's belief that Jesus is God in real sense
 konstantin ke uttaradhikariyon ne ariyas ke anuyaayiyon kaa paksh liya, falswaroop lagbhag 50 varsh tak purvi katholic carch main itani avyavashtha rahi ki vahaan kaa carch us kuprabhav se kabhi mukt nahin ho paaya
 Towards the end of that century, the first real Christian emperor Theodosius declared Christianity as a religion; He also controlled the followers of Aureus and for that purpose organized the Second World Assembly of the Catholic Church in Küstüntunia
 paanchavin shatabdi main or do baar vishwasabha bulaai gai
 Bishop Nestorius of Kuntuntunia began to proclaim a new doctrine according to which two divine and human persons existed in Jesus
 effesus kii vishwasabha ne nestorius ko padchyut kiya or uske anuyaayiyon ko carch se bahishkrut ghoshit kiya, iske falswaroop faras kaa carch alag ho gaya
 Later Eutikas introduced monophysicism according to which Jesus has only one person and one nature
 is mat ke virodh main kalcedon kii vishwasabha ne isa main ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon ko vaastavik mana he
 The bishops of Syria, Armenia, and Egypt rejected the decision of Caledonian and the Christian communities of those countries also parted from the Catholic Church
 baad main islam ne syria or mistra ko samrajya se chin liya or vahaan ke adhikansh log us nae dharm se sammilit hue

 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz 
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles

 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris
 academi ne vrittant par vishwaas na karte hue ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye ek ayog niyukt kiya jiske prativedan main fadar basile ke vrittant ko bhramaatmak bataate hue yah mantavya prakat kiya gaya ki bijli gir jane se pind kaa prishth kuch is prakaar kaanch sadrush ho gaya tha jisase basile ko yah bhram hua ki yah pind prithvi kaa ansh nahin hai
 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical
 inamen se pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa aashmik ang mukhyat: aulivin khanij se bana hota he jiske sfat praaia: vrittakar hote hai or jo louh-nikal dhaatuon ke ek tantra main samaavrutt rahete hai
 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum
 loha 
 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon 
 iridium
 Titanium
 manganeez sizium 
 antimony telurium meganecium sirium

 Helium in 52 tatwon main se keval aath prachur maatra main paae jate hai, jinamein haalon sabase pramukh he
 The other seven are sequentially Oxygen, Silicon, Manganese, Sulfur, Aluminum, Nickel and Calcium
 inke atirikt 20 anya tatv paryaapt maatra main paae jate hai tathaa unki upasthiti kaa pataa saadhaaran rasinic vishleshan dwaara 1926 se purv hi lag chukaa tha
 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet
 aashmik ulkapindon main saadharantaya piroxin or aulivin kii prachurtaa evam felsapaar kaa abhaav hota he, jisase unka sanghathan bhumandal kii atibhasmik shailon ke sadrush hota he
 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 ° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin
 ulkapindon kaa ek brihat sangrah kalkatte ke bhartiya sangrahalay ke bhuvaigyanik vibhaag main pradarshit he
 It is supervised by the Geological Survey of India
 prachlit niyamon ke anusaar desh main kahin bhi gira hua ulkapind sarkari sampatti hota he
 Anyone who finds such a body has the duty to refer it to the local collector from where it is sent to the Geological Survey of India Department

 In all, it has 468 different meteorites, out of which 149 are metallic and 319 are of surprise category

 sanchaar madhyam se aashay he sandesh ke pravaah main prayukt kiye jane vaale madhyam
 The main reason behind the development of media is due to the curious tendency of humans
 vartmaan samay main sanchaar madhyam or samaaj main gaharaa sambandh evam nikatataa he
 Through this, the interests and interests of common people are explained
 sanchaar madhyamon ne hi soochna ko sarvasulabh karaayaa he
 Communication has also developed through technological development and with this communication has become a global phenomeno
 sanchaar madhyam, angreji ke "media" se bana he, jiskaa abhipraay hota he do binduon ko jodne vaala
 The communication medium connects the communicator and the listener
 herald loswell ke anusaar, sanchaar madhyam ke mukhya kaary soochna sangrah evam prasar, soochna vishleshan, saamaajik mulya evam gyaan kaa sampreshan tathaa logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The influence of media has been in society since time immemorial
 paramparaagat evam aadhunik sanchaar madhyam samaaj kii vikaas prakriya se hi jude hue hai
 The audience or target group of the media is scattered
 iske sandesh bhi asthir swabhaav vaale hote hai
 Then the communication medium leads to the process of communication
 sanchaar shabd angreji ke communication kaa hindi roopaantar he jo latin shabd communis se bana he, jiskaa arth he saamaanya bhagidaari yukt soochna
 Since communication takes place in the society itself, we can see from the perspective of society that communication is the process of giving direction to social relations or keeping a constant flow
 sanchaar samaaj ke aarambh se lekar ab tak ke vikaas se judaa hua he
 According to the famous communicator Dennis Maquel, "there is the exchange of meaningful messages from one person to another
 dow mari ke mat main, "sanchaar saamaajik upkaran kaa saamanjasy he
 " ligans kii shabdon main, " nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 This process goes on continuously and interacts with experiences
 " In the view of political science thinker Lukiv Pai, "the analysis of social processes is communication
" " Thus in relation to communication one can say that society is the main center in this where the process of communication takes place
 sanchaar kii prakriya ko kisi daayre main baandha nahin ja saktaa
 Then the goal of communication is informative, motivational, educational and entertaining
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi sanchaar madhyamon kaa astitv rahaa he
 It is a different matter that their form used to be different
 bharat main sanchaar siddhanth kavy parpanra se judaa hua he
 Practicalization and permanence are linked to the principle of communication
 sanchaar mukhya rup se sandesh kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 Then as far as the nature of the media is concerned, it is connected to the user of communication as well as the society
 chunki ham yah bhi pate hai ki sanchaar madhyam samaaj kii bheetar kii prakriyaaon ko hi ubhaarte hai
 There have also been changes in the nature and character of India's media in the outgoing century, but mainly three to four qualitative changes are seen in the character of the press
 pehla : shatabdi ke purvaaddh main iskaa charitra mulat: mishanwaadee rahaa, vajah thi swatantraaa andolan va aupniveshik shashan se mukti
 Personalities like Tilak, Gandhi, Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Vishnu Paradkar, Madhavrao Sapre contributed to the creation of its character
 doosraa : 15 agast 1947 ke baad raashtra ke agenda par nai praathamiktaaon kaa ubharna
 The nation building period started from here and the press was also influenced by its rites
 yah daur do dashak tak chalaa
 Third: a culture of pure professionalism started from the seventh decade
 vajah thi raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon kaa visphot
 Fourth: The press was modernized in the last two decades, the emergence of regional press as a 'power' and the disappearance of sensitivity and vision from newspapers and magazines
 iske itar aaj to sanchaar madhyamon kii prakruti asthaayee he
 It has its own legitimate reasons, however, other than this, the media has started serving sensational news and information sensationally for other purposes

 Jain sages are practiced in Jainism for individuals who follow the religion

 According to Jain texts, saints have to bear twenty-two parishes barish ke 4 maheenon main ahimsa dharm kii raksha ke liye jain sadhu vihaar aadi nahin karte
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many munis and acharyas in this tradition - dev murti sharma,bharat ke uttar pradesh kii pratham vidhansabha sabha main vidhayak rahe
 In the 1952 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, he participated in the election on behalf of the Congress from the 263-banaras Legislative Assembly constituency of Benares district of Uttar Pradesh
 dharamapi yaa galvanometer ek prakaar kaa ameter hi he
 It is used to detect the presence of current in a circuit
 praayah isapar ampear, volt yaa om ke nishaan nahin lagaaye gayi rahete hai
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar dharamapi kai prakaar ke ho sakate hai- The tangent brometer is the most simple and useful movable magnetometer
 isamen kisi achumbakeey padaarth ke urdhwadhar dhaanche par vidyutarodhi taanbe ke taar kii ek vrittakar kundali lagi rahati he
 The horoscope usually consists of 552 rounds, with connective screws after 2, 50 and 500 rounds
 inaki sahaayta se aavashyatanusaar kam yaa adhik chakkaron se kaam le sakate hai
 The circular coil can be rotated around the vertical axis
 kundali ke centre par ek chumbakeey sui urdhwadhar kilak par sadhi rahati he or sui ke lamberup ek aluminium kaa lanbaa sanketak laga rahata he, jo sooyee ke saath saath kshaitij vrittakar scale par ghumta he or chumbakeey sooyee kaa vikshep batalaata he
 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 Before measuring the current, you make the base of the dielectric horizontal and rotate the plane of the coil to the magnetic meridian
 is dasha main chumbakeey sui ke baks ko kundali ke centre par kshaijit sthiti main rakhte hai or yah bhi dekh lete hai ki sanketak ke donon sire 0 degree - 0 degree par sthit he ab dharamapi ke do sanyojak penchon ko us paripath main sambhddha kar dete hai jisamen dhara kaa pravaah hota he
 As the current flows in the vertical coil, a magnetic field is created, which forms a right angled horizontal earth magnetic field
 un donon chumbakeey kshetron ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee par do vipareet disha main ghumaanevaale balyugma kaary karte hai
 The needle is deflected and stops in such a situation where the rotations of both the balugams are equal
 yadi sooyee kaa vikshep q ho, to dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : That is, the current flowing in the currentometer is proportional to the tangent of the deflection angle
 niyatank dharamapi kaa parivartan gunak kehalaata he
 The change multiplier is measured in amperes
 yah us vidyutdhara ke baraabar hota he, jo dharamapi kii sooyee main 45 degree kaa vikshep utpann kar sakati he
 This type of simple tangent dormometer is not sufficiently subtle and accurate
 vishesh rup se dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata chumbakeey sui ke donon dhruvon par ek si nahin hoti
 This leads to an error in the current, because the formula relies on having the same magnetic field at both poles
 isliye isi siddhant par aadhaarit ek doosraa dharamapi bana, jise helmholts galavenometer kehete hai
 This is not an error in the currentometer and it is much more sensitive than a simple tangentometer
 isamen achumbakeey padaarth ke do urdhwadhar dhaanchon par vrittakar kundaliyaan hoti hai
 The distance between their centers is equal to their radius
 chumbakeey sooyee kaa baks donon kundiliyon ke kshaitij aksh par thik bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The wires of both the coils are connected in such a way that the magnetic fields produced from both are in the same direction when current flows in them
 aisa hone se chumbakeey sooyee ke paas dharaa se utpann chumbakeey kshetra adhik teevr ho jaataa he or yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki is kshetra kii tivrata sooyee ke donon siron par ek si rahati he
 As a result of this change, this thermometer becomes more sensitive and accurate
 dhara naapane ke pehle sooyee ke baks ke samtal ko kshaitij karnaa or urdhwadhar kundaliyon ko chumbakeey yamyottar main karnaa aavashyak he
 After this adjustment, when current flows in the coil of the dielectric and there is an angle deflection in the magnetic needle, the value of the current is known by the following formula: g ko helmholts dharamapi kaa pavirthan gunak kehete hai
 This thermometer is also not sufficiently sensitive
 adhik sookshmagrahi dharamapi banane ke liye ek nayaa siddhant prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 That is, if the effect of the earth magnetic field is reduced on the magnetic needle, then any current will cause the magnetic needle to have greater deflection than before, meaning the device will become more sensitive
 isko asthaitik yugma kaa siddhant kehete hai
 If two nearly equal magnetic rotating magnets are attached to a rigid rod so that they are parallel to each other and their opposite poles are close together, they are called an inertial pair
 is yugma main donon chumbakon ke vipareet dhruv paas paas hote hai, is kaaran parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav is yugma par bahut kam padataa he
 The coil or coils of the wire are wrapped around a magnet or both magnets in such a way that the currents are exerted on the magnets in the same direction
 is dasha main yadi kundaliyon main nune dhara bhi pravahit ha, ta bha chumbakeey yugma main adhik vikshep hota he
 This type of dielectric is very sensitive
 yadi is chumbakeey yugma ko ek anthnrahit latakan dwaara lataka diya jaae or is latakan main ek chota sa darpan laga diya jaae, to prakaash kiran dwaara ati sakshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he
 The rays of light are reflected from the mirror of the photometer by moving from the lamp and come into focus on a scale by a lens
 jab dhara pravaah ke kaaran chumbakeey yugma main vikshep hota he or darpan kone q dwaara ghumta he, to parvartit prakaash kirne kone 2Q main gumti hai or scale par prakashabindu main sthanantaran ho jaataa he
 By this method, the micro-deflection of the needle can be measured and as a result, the extreme current can be measured with this thermometer
 asthaitik chumbakeey yugma kaa prayog kai prakaar se vibhinn naamon ke dharamapiyon main kiya gaya he
 Calvin Dharmapi, Pashen Dharmapi and Broca Dharmapi are some examples
 in dharamapiyon se 10-12 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 a hydrometer is a thermometer, especially an inertometer, is very sensitive, but it is inconvenient to use
 ye asthaayee bhi hote hai
 This is why they are rarely used

 Krishna represents many genres in Indian culture
 unka chithran aamtaur par vishnu jaise krishna, kaale yaa nile rang kii twachaa ke saath kiya jaataa he
 However, ancient and medieval inscriptions, both in India and Southeast Asia, and in stone sculptures have depicted them in the natural color from which it was made

 in lokapriy chitranon main, krishna kabhi path pradarshak ke rup main saamne main prakat hote hai, yaa to duuradrushtaa ke rup main, kabhi rath ke chaalak ke rup main
 Alternate depictions of Krishna depicting him as a child, a child crawling on his hands and knees, dancing, stealing fellow friend Gwal Baal, buttermilk, carrying laddus in his hand or during the Holocaust a supernatural baby floating on a banyan leaf that appears to suck its toe
 krishna kii pratimaa main kshetreey vividhtaayen unke vibhinn roopon main dekhi jaati hai, jaise odisha main jagannatha, maharashtra main vithoba, rajasthan main shrinath ji, gujarat main dwarkadhish or kerala main guuruvyruppan 
 Other depictions show him along with Radha who is believed to be the symbol of divine love of Radha and Krishna
 unhen kurukshetra yuddh main vishwaroop main bhi dikhaaya jaataa he jisamen unke kai mukh hai or sabhi log unke mukh main ja rahe hai
 He is also shown along with his friend Sudama who is a symbol of friendship

 Similarly, the early Tamil texts of the medieval era also include statues of Krishna and Rukmini
 in dishanirdeshon ke anusaar banaai gai kai murtiyon sarkari sangrahalay,chennai ke sangrah main hai
 a detailed account of Krishna as a personality is first written in the epic Mahabharata, which depicts Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu

 In his commentary on Panini's verse 3
1
26, he also uses the killing of Kansavadha or Kamsa, an important part of the legends related to Krishna
 madhya bhartiya rajyamadhya pradesh main aupniveshik kaal ke puratatvavidon ne ek brahmi lipi main likhe shilaalekh ke saath ek stambh kii khoj kii thi
 Using modern techniques, it is proclaimed between 125 and 100 BCE and concluded that it was built by an indo-greek representative to a regional Indian king who was an ambassador of the Greek king Antilacidas His representative was in form
 isi indo-greek ke naam ab ise heledioras stambh ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Its inscription is a dedication to "vasudeva" which is another name of Krishna in the Indian tradition
 kai vidwaanon kaa mat he kii isamen "vasudev" naamak devtaa kaa ullekh hai, kyonki is shilaalekh main kaha gaya he ki yah " bhagwat heleodoras" dwaara banaaya gaya tha or yah " garud stambh" 
 Additionally, a chapter in the inscription also contains a poem related to Krishna, referencing Adhyaya 11
7 of the Mahabharata, that the path to immortality and heaven is to lead a life of three virtues correctly: self-restraint, generosity and vigilance
 heleodoras shilaalekh ekmaatr pramaan nahin he
 Krishna is also mentioned in the three Hathibada inscriptions and one Ghosundi inscription, which are located in the state of Rajasthan and according to modern practice whose time is in the 19th century BC
 pehali sadi isa purv, sankarshan or vasudev kaa ullekh karte hue, unki puja ke liye ek sanrachana kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 These four inscriptions are one of the oldest known Sanskrit inscriptions
 kai puraanon main krishna kii jivan katha ko bataaya yaa kuch is par prakaash daalaa gaya he 
 The two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain the most detailed information about the story of Krishna, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts differ and have significant inconsistencies
 bhagwat puraana main baarah pustaken up-vibhajit hai jinamein 332 adhyay, sanskaran ke aadhaar par 16,000 or 18,000 chando ke bich sanchit he 
 The tenth book of the text, consisting of about 4000 verses and dedicated to legends about Krishna, is the most popular and widely studied chapter of the text

 unhone anya shaskaon se ekbar phir ekajute hokar angrejon ke khilaaf ladane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin kisi ne unki baat nahin maani
 After this he decided to remind the British of the milk of the sixth on his own

 In view of this, he made a treaty with the British in 1805 AD
 angrejon ne unhen swatantra shaasha mana or unke saare kshetra lautaa die
 After this, he along with Scindia made another plan to drive out the British
 unhone sindhiya ko khat likhaa, lekin sindhiya dagebaaj nikle or vah khat angrejon ko dikhaa diya
 After this, the whole matter worsened again
 yashwantrao ne hallaa bol diya or angrejon ko akele dam par maat dene kii puri taiyaari main jute gaye
 For this, he opened an ammunition factory in Bhanpur
 isbaar unhone angrejon ko khadedane kii thaan lee thi
 Therefore, they were busy working day and night

 muharram islamic varsh yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa he
 It is also a Muslim festival
 hijri san kaa aagaaj isi maheene se hota he
 This month is considered one of the four holy months of Islam
 allaah ke rasul hazrat mohammad ne is maas ko allaah kaa maheenaa kaha he
 Also, the statement of keeping Roza in this month has been said
 mukhtaliff hadison, yani hazrat mohammad ke kaul va amal se muharram kii pavitrataa va isaki ahmiyat kaa pataa chalata he
 Likewise, Hazrat Muhammad once referred to Muharram and called it the month of Allah
 ise jin chaar pavitra maheenon main rakhaa gaya he, unamem se do maheene muharram se pehle aate hai
 These two months are Jikada and Jilhijj
 ek haddees ke anusaar allaah ke rasul hazrat mohammad ne kaha ki ramajaan ke alaava sabase uttam roje ve hai, jo allaah ke maheene yani muharram main rakhe jate hai
 While saying this, nabi-e-karim Hazrat Muhammad added one more thing that just as the most important namaz after the obligatory namaz is performed, similarly after Ramadan, the best roses are from Muharram
 islamic yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa muharram he
 It is a matter of coincidence that today this aspect of Muharram is out of the eyes of the common man and should pray to Allah in this month whereas prophet-islam kept fast in this month and attracted the attention of his companions
 is bare main kai pramanik hadisen maujuud hai
 Ibadats going on the 9th of Muharram have also been described as a great cause
 hazrat mohammad ke saathi ibne abbaas ke mutabik hazrat mohammad ne kaha ki jisane muharram kii 9 taarikh kaa rojaa rakhaa, uske do saal ke gunaah maaf ho jate hai tathaa muharram ke ek roje kaa sawab 30 rojon ke baraabar miltaa he
 Goya should be fasting in the month of Muharram
 yah roje anivaary yani jaruri nahin hai, lekin muharram ke rojon kaa bahut sawab he
 However, it is definitely said that on this day the installment of Hazrat Noah, the prophet of Allah, got an edge

 The 10th day of Muharram month is called 'ashura'
 aashura ke din hazrat rasul ke navaase hazrat imam hossain ko or unke bete gharavaale or unke sathiyon ko kerbala ke maidan main shahid kar diya gaya tha
 Muharram is a major festival of people who believe in the religion of Islam

 In the same month in 680, a religious war took place in a place called Karbala, which took place between the grandson of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad and Ibn Zayd

 And since then, not only Muslims of all the world but also people of other communities also remember the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his companions during this month

 This incident in Karbala in Iraq is a living example of sacrificing truth

 Today, the common man has little knowledge of the poor

 In such a situation, there is a need to look at the things mentioned by Hazrat Muhammad and follow them properly
 imam or unki shahadat ke baad sirf unke ek putr hazrat imam jainulabedin, jo ki beemaari ke kaaran yuddh me bhaag na le sake the bache | duniya me apane bacchon kaa naam hazarat hossain or unke shahid saathiyon ke naam par rakhane vaale arbo musalmaan hai
