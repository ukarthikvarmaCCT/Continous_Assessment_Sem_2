 is dharmasutra main ek hi sthaan par kisi bhi vishay ke sabhi niyamon ko samaapt nahin kar diya jaataa, apitu ek hi vishay kaa bhinn-bhinn adhyyon main vivechan kiya gaya he
 as-succession, Atonement, Purification, Putra-bheda and Anadhyaya are discussed at different places
 * The language of Boudhayan Dharmasutra seems to be Pāिini
 isamen anek apanineey prayog bhi uplabdh hote hai* 'abhigachhaat' tathaa* 'aanayitva' prayog panineey vyakaran ke viruddh hai
 This sutra text is prose-verse
 brahman-granthon kii style ke sadrush lambe gadyatmak ansh tathaa chote-chote sutara bhi isamen hai
 In this Dharmasutra many Vedamantras are quoted in full form as * or partial *
 vaidic mantron athwa mantranshon kaa nirdesh 'iti shruti:' tathaa 'iti vigyaayate' dwaara kiya gaya he
 Many shlokas have been quoted in it as ‘athapyaudaharanti’
 boudhayan praaia: virdohi mat ko upasthit karne ke pashchaat hi apana mat dete hai
 The style of this sutra text is simpler than other Dharmasutras
 *govindaswami ne is tathy kii ore ingit kiya he ki boudhayan laghavapriya nahin hai
 Due to the chaos of division, it is believed that changes and additions have been made from time to time, due to which some part of this Dharmasutra is projected
 yatha chaturth prashn baad main joda gaya prathit hota he
 Atonement has been discussed in its four chapters, which has already been given in the first chapter of the second question by saying 'ie atonement' *
 boudhayan dharmasutra main hiranyakeshi, aapstamb tathaa kaanv boudhayan teenon kaa naam-nirdeshpurvak ullekh hua
 * Mahadev, the commentator of the reincarnated Hiranyakeshi Shrutasutra, considered Boudhayan as ancient from Aapastamb
 boudhayan ne apane dharmasutra main do baar gautam kaa naam lekar ullekh kiya he* tathaa gautam dharmasutra ke 19wein adhyay ke anek sutron ko jyon-kaa-tyon tathaa anek sutron ko parvarti rup main apane dharmasutra main grahan kar liya he
 Hence, the Boudhayan Dharmasutra is definitely a later work from the Gautama Dharmasutra
 isi prakaar boudhayan tathaa aapstamb dharmasutron main bhi kai sthanon par samanta he
 a number of sutras received in Aapastamb cite Boudhayana 'iti'
 isse yahi siddh hota he ki boudhayan ne in sutron ko aapstamb se grahan kiya he
 The language and style of Apastamb is more disorganized, as well as the words used in the old sense
 is aadhaar par aapstamb ko boudhayan se purvavarti mana jaataa he
 Buehler considers Baudhayana as predecessor to Apastamb
 unka tark he ki aapstamb dwaara pratipaadit mat boudhayan kii apeksha parvarti he tathaa aapstamb ne boudhayan ke maton kii aalochana bhi kii he
 The topics propounded in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra can be summarized as follows- boudhayan dharmasutra main vyakti ke vyaktigat evam saamaajik aachaar tathaa kartavyon kaa vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 Varna system has been the basis of Indian culture
 is dharmasutra main sabhi varnon evam ashramon ke kartavyon par vistaar se prakaash daalaa gaya he
 According to Baudhayana, the duty of a Brahmin is to perform Vedadhyana, donate-give and sacrifice
 vedadhyayan ke saath-saath yajna karnaa, daan dena, praaniyon kii raksha karnaa kshatriyon ke kartavya hai tathaa adhyayan, yajna, krishi, vyapaar tathaa pashupaalan vaishyon ke kartavya hai
 The only duty of a Shudra is to serve the three varnas
 yadhyapi saamanyat: in kaaryon kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, kintu inamen vyavasthit kram bhi dekhne ko miltaa he- yatha 1-5-10 main brahmanon ko kheti karne kii chhot bhi di gayi he
 Similarly, in a special situation, the Brahmin and the Vaishya have also been given the law to take up arms
 ek sthaan par yah bhi kaha gaya he ki pashupaalak, vyapaar karne vaale, bhrityon kaa kaary karne vaale tathaa soodakhor brahmanon ke saath shudra ke samaan aacharan karen
 * Vaishya can give money on interest, but taking more interest is a sin
 * In this Dharmasutra, human life has been divided into four ashrams as Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Parivrajaka, and the duties of all of them separately have been enumerated
 brahmacharya ke niyamon main brahmacharee kii bhiksha, yagyopavit, sandhyaa, aachman, anadhyaay aadi ke sambandh main jo kuch bhi kaha gaya he vah vartmaan manusmriti main nirdisht brahmacharee ke kartavyon ke samaan hi he
 Not only this, but many such verses are also available in the Buddhist Dharmasutra, which are also present in Manusmriti
 * grihasth ke liye anya dharmagranthon kii bhanti boudhayan ne bhi aath vivaah maane hai
 * Three types of graduates have been mentioned here after finishing their education before home education
 grihasth ke liye boudhayan ne devyagy, pitruyajna, bhootyajna, manushyayajna tathaa brahmayajna ke rup main panch mahayagyon kaa vidhaan kiya he tathaa inako mahasatra kaha he
 There is enough emphasis on Swadhyaya, even it has been called Brahmayagya
 swadhyay ke saath-saath gayatri-jap, pranayam tathaa sandhyopasana kaa vidhaan bhi yahan par kiya gaya he
 The sutrakara has a strong emphasis on these actions, probably because these actions motivate the person towards the sunrise
 vaikhanas arthath sanyasi ke liye das prakaar kii diksha kaa vidhaan yahan par kiya gaya he
 Although Boudhayan has tried to give proper direction to the workability of men and women by framing various rules of marriage, he is aware that unethical relations also flourish in the society by the wayward men
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue boudhayan ne santaan ke kai prakaar ginaae hai-yatha- kanin, dattak, kritrim, apaviddh, sahopha, kriit tathaa ponrbhav
 It is necessary to consider some of these
 avivaahit kanya se utpann putr kanin kehalaata he
 It seems that such a son was then accepted in the society
 panini ne bhi iske liye ek sutara kaa nirmaan kiya he
 * The son who is safe in the womb of the womb during the marriage period is called Sahodha
 cleeb yaa patit pati ko chhodkar anya pati se utpann santan ponrbhav kehalaati thi
 * This indicates the practice of Neog
 ukt sabhi putr daybhag ke adhikari the
 For adultery, Boudhayans do the harshest punishment, even to burn alive in fire
 boudhayan dharmasutra main brahman, kshatriya tathaa vaisya ke liye kramshah chaar, teen tathaa do patniyon kaa vidhaan bhi kiya gaya he
 Only one wife is prescribed for the Shudra
 * yadhyapi yah ucch adarsh nahin he, saath hi varnon ke prati pakshpaat bhi he; kintu sambhav he ki us samay samaaj main yah sab kuch sweekrut ho
 In the same context, Boudhayan has also mentioned varnasankaras
 pratilom vivaah se utpann santanon ko is dharmasutra ke pratham prashn ke navam adhyay main chandal, rathkaar, kukkut, vaidehak, shwapaak, parashav, nishad aadi anek naamon se pukaara gaya he* ki sabhi varnsankar santaanen hai jo varnon ke paraspar sambandhon se utpann hui hai
 It seems that at the time of the creation of the Buddhist Dharmasutra, the above stage was occurring in the society
 vivaah kii vaidic maryaada tuutakar varnsankarta ke kaaran nai–nai jatiyaan banati ja raheen thim
 Dharmasutras undertook to give social recognition to all of them so that they would not be ignored and social bond in some form should also be maintained
 gautam kii bhanti boudhayan bhi maanate hai ki manushya bure kaaryon main lipt ho jaataa he
 * Etdarth Boudhayan has enacted several types of atonement and fasting of Chandrayaan etc
 so that a person can leave his / her sin-weight and become saintly again
 unhone is sandarbh main paatkon tathaa upapatakon kii gananaa bhi kii he tathaa sabhi ke liye dand–vidhaan kiya he
 Many of these punishments are extremely harsh - that is, the punishment of alcohol is to burn the body by drinking a burning sura
 manusmriti main bhi is dand kaa vidhaan isi prakaar kiya gaya he
 Possibly harsh punishment is so that a person can not fall into the path of sin
 boudhayan ne samaan aparaadh ke liye sabhi varnon ke liye dand main bhed kiya he
 Although the law of harsh punishment is found for a Brahmin, however, he is said to be impractical in all crimes
 * varnashram ke saath–saath boudhayan ne raja ke adhikaar evam karttavyon par bhi paryaapt prakaash daalaa he
 The king should take one-sixth of the income from the subjects as tax, so that he can protect the subjects
 * abhigyanshakuntalam main bhi dushyant dwaara kar ke rup main shashth bhaag kaa hi ullekh kiya gaya he
 * boudhayan ne yajna ke samay nae vastra dhaaran karne kaa vidhaan kiya he, saath hi naam lekar yah bhi kaha he ki yajmaan, yajmaan patni tathaa ruthvik ye sabhi shuddh vastra pahanen
 * It is clear from this statement that women also had the right to sit in yajna with husband
 *boudhayan ne striyon kii swatantraaa par roak lagaai he* tathaa is vishay main ek shloke bhi uddhrut kiya he, jo vartmaan manusmriti main* main bhi swalp shabd–bhed se uplabdh he
 According to the Boudhayan Dharmasutra, women also do not have rights in the Daibhaga
 * boudhayan ne kashyap ke naam se ek shloke bhi uddhrut kiya he – jo stri dravya se kray kii jaati he use patni kaa nahin apitu daasi kaa sthaan praapt hota he
 * Overall, the position of woman in this Dharmasutra is not good
 striyon ke samaan shudron kii bhi bahut acchhee sthiti nahin he
 It has been legislated to do Anadhyaya for as long as one place, Shudra can be seen or its sound can be heard
 * In many sources in the fifth chapter of the first question of the Buddhist Dharmasutra, the context of meat eating has also been run
 sabhi vidwaan aisa maanate hai ki is dharmasutra main samay samay par anek parivartan evam parivardhan hote rahe hai, jisase prathit hota he ki yah maance–prakaran tathaa stri evam shudron kii dinavastha ke pratipadak prakaran bhi isamen prakshipt kar die gaye
 Thus, in this Dharmasutra, almost all the duties related to human life are constituted by legislation
 taatkaalik paristhitiyon kaa prabhaav sutarakaar par padaa hi hoga, usee kaa digdarshan anekatra is dharmasutra main dekhne ko miltaa he
 The rendition of this Dharmasutra is sufficiently compatible with Manusmriti
 isaki govindaswamikrut vivaran ‘namni’ ekmaatr vyakhya uplabdh he
 In this interpretation, Govand Swami has given quotes from many memories
 iske atirikt unhone shatathap, shankhalikhit, mahabhashya, yogasutra, bhagavadgita tathaa shabarabhashya se bhi anek uddhran die hai
 Adequate citations of Shrutasutras are also found in it

 These quotes have certainly increased the pride of Govind Swami's interpretation

 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated

 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible

 Although the exact origin of chess is not certain, it is known that its modern rules first developed in Italy during the 16th century
 Until the beginning of the 19th century, in its modern form, the rules continued to change slightly
 shatranj ke niyamon main sthanon ke aadhaar par bhi alag-alag parivartan hue

 Each type of piece moves in a special way
 khel kaa lakshya shah or maat hota he arthath virdohi khilaadi ke badshaah ko aprihaary rup se bandi bana lenaa hota he
 It is not necessary that the game ends in a state of checkmate, but the player can usually give up the game if he believes in his defeat
 iske atirikt khel kii drow sthiti main khatm hone ke bhi kai tareeke hote hai
 In addition to the basic moves of the pieces, the equipment used in the game, time control, behavior of players, adjustment of players with physical disabilities, details of moves in chess gestures and for irregularities to be taken during the game
 Processes are also regulated by regulations
 shatranj ko shatranj ke bisaat par khelaa jaataa he jo ekantar rangon ke 64 virgon main banta hua ek vargakar board hota he jo drafts ke khel main prayukt hone vaale board jaisaa hota he
 Whatever be the actual colors of the board, the light colored squares are called 'light' or 'white' and the dark colored squares are 'dark' or 'black'
 16 "safed" or 16 "kaale" mohare bisaat par, khel kii shuruyaat main, rakhe jate hai
 The board is laid in such a way that a white square lies in the right corner of each player and a black square in the left corner
 Each player has 16 pieces to his right
 khel kii shuruyaat main dahini ore dikhaae gaye chitra ke anusaar moharon ko vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 The player has 8 pawns in the second row; The player's closest line consists of the remaining pieces
 moharon kii vyavastha ko yaad rakhane ke liye lokapriy vaakyansh jo praaia: nae khilaadiyon main prachlit hote hai “queen on on color” tathaa “white on rhite” 
 baad vaala vaakyansh bisaat bichaane se sambandhit he jiske anusaar prayek khilaadi kaa nikatatam daayan varg safed hona chahie
 Each square of the board is identified by a specific pair of letters and a number
 khadi panktiyon ko safed ke baayen se safed ke daaen e se lekar ech tak ke akshar se suchit kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, horizontal lines start from the nearest white part of the board and represent numbers from 1 to 8
 iske baad bisaat kaa prayek varg apane file akshar tathaa rank sankhya dwaara vishisht rup se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The white king, for example, will remain in the E1 category at the beginning of the game
 The black horse situated in B8 category will reach A6 or C6 in the first move
 prayek khilaadi ke niyantran main rangeen moharon ke do main se ek set hota he or iskaa naam khilaadi ke sambandhit moharon ke rang par hota he arthath safed yaa kaala
 safed moharon kii chalane kii baari pehali hoti he or jaisaa ki adhiktar bisaat khelon main hota he, ek khilaadi ke baad doosraa khilaadi chalata he
 It is mandatory to do tricks; It is not lawful to refrain from playing "pass" - even when it is dangerous for the player to move
 jaisaa ki aage bataaya gaya he, khel, badshaah ke shah paakar maat hone, kisi khilaadi ke haar maan lene athwa khel drow ghoshit hone tak jari rahata he
 Additionally, if the game is being played under controlled time, then the player who violates the time limit will lose
 shatranj ke aupchaarik niyamon main, koun sa khilaadi safed moharon se khelegaa, yah tay karnaa shaamil nahin hota
 Instead, the decision is subject to the tournament's own specific rules or in the event of non-competitive play, depending on the mutual consent of the players, in some situations random selection is also resorted to
 shatranj ke prayek mohare kaa chalane kaa alag-alag tarika hota he
 Except in the event of cutting the opponent's pieces, the moves always go in some rough square
 ghode ke apwaad ko chhodkar mohare ek-duusare ke upar se nahin guzar sakate
 jab koi mohara katataa he to hamalavar mohara dushman ke mohare ke us varg main sthapit ho jaataa he 
 kaate hue mohare ko is prakaar khel se hataa diya jaataa he or shesh khel ke dauraan ye waapas nahin aa sakate
 badshaah ko shah diya ja saktaa he kintu use kaata nahin ja saktaa 
 Castling involves the king being raised two squares towards the rook and placing the rook on the other side of the king just next to it
 caseling keval tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab nimnlikhit sharten puri hon: If player A's pawn moves two squares forward and player B's pawn is in the 5th horizontal row in the corresponding vertical row, then B's pawn can cut A's pawn, if only one square of it moves
 kaatane kii yah kriya keval iske thik baad vaali chaal main kii ja sakati he
 In this example, if the white pawn comes from A2 to A4, then the black pawn on B4 will cut it to A3 by cutting it by Ampasan method
 yadi pyaadaa aage badhate hue aapni 8veen kshaitij pankti main pahunch jaae, to yah tarakkee paakar apane hi rang kaa vazeer / rani, kishti, feel athwa ghoda ban saktaa he, jo khilaadi kii ichha par nirbhar he ki vah kya bananaa chahta he 
 yah chayan pehle ke kate hue moharon tak hi simit nahin hota
 Therefore, theoretically it is possible for a player to make a wazir up to a number of nine, or an installment, a file or a horse up to a number of ten if all his pawns are promoted
 If the piece of the player's choice is not available, the player should ask the judge to provide that piece
 jab koi khilaadi aisi chaal chalata he jisase virdohi ke badshaah ke cat jane kaa khatra utpann ho, to badshaah ko shah padaa hua mana jaataa he
 The definition of check is that one or more opposing pieces will theoretically cut the king in the next move
 If the king of a player is in the position of check, the player will have to do such a move which will eliminate the danger of cutting the king; The player can never leave his king in check position at the end of his move
 Possible ways to eliminate check are: anaupchaarik khelon main, virdohi ke badshaah ko shah dene vaali chaal chalane ke dauraan shah kii ghoshnaa karnaa aavashyak hota he
 However, checkout is rarely announced in formal competitions
 khilaadi aisi koi chaal nahin chal saktaa jisase uske badshaah par shah padataa ho athwa pehle se shah kii sthiti main padaa hua badshaah usee sthiti main chhot jaataa ho, yahaan tak ki us halaat main bhi nahin jab shah dene vaale mohare ko pin ke kaaran nahin chalaa ja saktaa, arthath jab us mohare ko chalane se virdohi ke apane badshaah par shah padataa ho
 It also means that the player cannot place his king in any square immediately next to the opponent's king, because doing so will put the king against the king by the opponent
 yadi kisi khilaadi ke badshaah par shah ho or aisi koi vaid chaal na ho jisase ki vah khilaadi apane badshaah ko shah se bachaa sake to badshaah shahmaat kii sthiti main mana jaataa he, khel khatm ho jaataa he or vah khilaadi haar jaataa he
 Because check and match end the game, unlike other pieces, the king never actually cuts nor can be removed from the board
 dahini ore die gaye chitra main shah or maat kii sthiti kaa ek namoona dikhaaya gaya he
 The white king is threatened by the black queen; Each class, in which the emperor may go, is also threatened; The king cannot cut the wazir / queen because then it poses an installment threat
 koi bhi khilaadi shahmaat kii sthiti se pehle hi kisi bhi samay haar maan le saktaa he or tab uske virdohi kii jeet ho jaaegi
 aisa saamanyat: tab hota he jab khilaadi ko yah vishwaas ho jaataa he ki vah khel haarane vaala he
 The player can give up by speaking or do so in three ways on their scoresheet: by writing "resigns", rounding the result of the game, or by writing "1–0" if the black-faced side has given up and if By writing "0–1" if the white side has given up
 Dropping your king is also a sign of giving up, but it is not used much
 Stopping both watches is not a sign of giving up, as clocks can be stopped to call the judge
 haath milaane kaa prastaav bhi jaruri nahin ki haar maan lenaa mana jaae, kyonki aisa sochaa ja saktaa he ki khilaadi drow karne ko sahamat hue hai
 The game will end in the event of a draw if any of these situations arise
 jis khilaadi ko chaal chalani he vah yah ghoshnaa karke ki nimnlikhit main se koi ek paristhiti utpann ho gai he, athwa nimnlikhit sthitiyon main se kisi ek ko utpann karne vaali chaal chalane kii manshaa kii ghoshnaa ke saath, drow kaa daawa kar saktaa he: If the claim is found to be true, the game is drawn
 kabhi aisa niyam tha, ki yadi kisi khilaadi ke liye virdohi badshaah ko lagaataar shah dena sambhav ho jaae or khilaadi ne aisa karte rahane kii apni manshaa jaahir kar di ho, to khel drow ho jayega
 yah niyam ab prabhavi nahin he; haalanki, khilaadi aisi sthiti main praaia: drow ke liye sahamat ho jaaenge kyonki aise main antat: teen baar duharaav vaala niyam athwa 50 chaalon vaala niyam lagu ho jayega
, It will end with the defeat of the player who has finished his entire allotted time
 There are different types of time controls
 khilaadi ko sampurna khel ke liye samay kii ek nishchit avadhi di ja sakati he, athwa ek nishchit samay ke andar use chaalon kii ek nishchit sankhya chalani padati he
 Also a small increase in time can be made for each move
 ye niyam shatranj ke aise khelon par lagu hote hai jo "bisaat ke upar" khele jate hai

 As long as the hand is not removed from the piece in the new square, then that piece can be placed in any valid category
 yadi koi khilaadi virdohi ke kisi mohare ko choota he, to use us mohare ko, yadi vah cat sake to jarur kaatna hoga
 There will be no penalty if any of the pieces touched is not valid for running, but this rule will still apply to the player's own pieces
 caseling ke dauraan sabase pehle chuaa jane vaala mohara badshaah hoga

 yadi khilaadi avaidh tareeke se caseling karne kii koshish kare, to yadi sambhav ho duusari kishti ke saath caseling sahit badshaah kii duusari vaid chaal avashya chalani padegi

 The choice of font is the first stage of typography lessons - story written in prose, writing separate from the story, editorial, academic, religious, scientific, spiritual and professional writing

 print media ke saath hi typographer binding margin, kaagaj ke chunaav tathaa mudran kii vidhi ke saath bhi jude rahete hai
 Likability is the case of a typeface designer to ensure that each character or glyph is clean and tidy with all other characters in the font
 Convenience is also somewhat related to the typographer choosing the typeface of the correct and clean design for intended use at the fixed size
 a well-known example of design, the brush script contains a lot of unreadable characters, since many of those characters can easily be misread if they look different from the textual context

 Because the common meaning of "readable" is "readable", there are still some people, some of whom are also commercially involved with typography, who think that "readability" is a term that refers to the effectiveness of the type and Needs debate
 lekin spashtataa or pathneeyata alag-alag hai, haalanki ye tip kii pahalu se sambandhit hai
 It is well known that these two words can help in analyzing the feature and function of type in a much narrower sense than the word readability alone
 


 typography main hamen spashtataa or aasaani se pahchaan yogya hone kii gunvattta kaa matlab samajhane ke liye


suvachyata kii paribhaasha dene kii jarurat he - isliye, udaaran ke liye, ham kah sakate hai ki puraane itelic style ke chote aakaar main lower cese h spasht nahin hota kyonki iskaa muda hua pair b kii tarah dikhaai padataa he; yaa vargeekrut vigyaapan main ek ank 3 bahut had tak 8 ke samaan he

 Generally, typefaces that are close to basic letterfarms are more pronounced than typefaces that are dense, diffuse, compacted, or detached
 haalanki, ek spasht tiperphes bhi kamjor setting or kram sthaan ke chalate apthaneey ho saktaa he, thik usee tarah spasht tiperphes achche dizin ke dwaara adhik pathneey banaae ja sakate hai
