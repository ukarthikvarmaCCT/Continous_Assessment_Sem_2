 16veen shatabdi ke prarambh main samast pashchimi europe dharmik drushti se ek tha - sabhi isai the; sabhi roman katholic carch ke sadsy the; uski parampargat shiksha maanate the or dharmik maamalon main uske adhyaksh arthath rome ke pope kaa shashan sweekaar karte the
 European reforms or reforms refer to the great movement of the 16th century, which resulted in this unity of Western Christians being disintegrated and Protestant religion emerged
 carch ke itihas main samay-samay par sudhaarwadi andolan hote rahe kintu ve carch ke dharmik siddhaton athwa uske shaskaon ko chunauti na dekar unke nirdesh ke anusaar hi naitik buraaiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa dharmik shiksha kaa prachaar apana uddeshy maanate the
 The reform movement that began in the 16th century soon began to oppose both the traditional teaching of the Church and the authority of its rulers
 dharmasudhar andolan ke parinamswaroop europe main catholic sampradaay ke saath-saath luther sampradaay, calvin sampradaay, anglican sampradaay or presbyterian sampradaay prachlit ho gayi
 To understand this new form of reform, it is very important to consider the present situation in Europe
 isa dwaara pravartit katholic carch ke prati isaayiyon main jo shraddha kaa bhav shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha vah kai kaarnon se kam ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, a French pope was elected, who remained in France throughout his life
 iske falswaroop baad main 40 varsh tak do pope vidyaman the, ek france main or ek rome main, jisase samast katholic sansar do bhaagon main vibhakt rahaa
 In the eighth century, the Catholic king of the Franks defeated the Lavard army invading Italy and gave the central part of Italy under the authority of the Pope, and thus became an ordinary ruler in addition to the cleric of the Roman Catholic Church
 is kaaran germany or france ke raja sahaj hi carch ke maamalon main or visheshkar pope ke chunaav main hastkshep karne kaa prayaas karte rahe
 In the late 14th century, this election became a competition ground for Italian elites, focusing less on the individual's merit and more on his lineage
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki us samay nitant ayogy popon kaa chunaav hua or rome ke darbar main naitikta tathaa dharm kii upeksha hone lagi
 So it was quite natural for the Church of Rome to lose respect
 asantosh kaa ek or kaaran yah tha ki samast carch kii sansthaaon par unki sampatti ke anusaar kar lagaaya jaataa tha or rome ke pratinidhi sarvada ghumkar yah rupaya vasuul karte the
 Apart from this predicament of the central organization of the Church, the condition of various religions was not satisfactory
 is samay samast pashchimi europe lagbhag saat sau dharmapraanton main vibhakt tha
 Their rulers were called bishops
 ye bishap samant the jo raja dwaara praaia: abhijaat varg main se chune jate the, darbar ke sadsy the or germany main bahudhaa apane kshetra ke raajnneetik shaasha bhi the
 Therefore, many bishops were more interested in politics, less interested in religion and left the religious administration of their homeland to the highly empowered priests of the university
 gaanvon main basanevaale adhikansh saadhaaran purohit ardhashikshit the
 They were unable to give lectures and were often poor
 saadhaaran purohiton kii yah dayaneey dasha 16veen shatabdi ke europea katholic carch kii sab se badi kamajori thi
 There was no one to teach religious education to the general public except the visiting Franciscans etc
 isse sarvatra andhvishwaas fail gaya or karmkand ko anaavashyak evam asantulit mahatv diy jane laga
 In the 13th century, Catholic theology gave a rational representation of the doctrines through the Christian interpretation of Aristotle and the Scholastic Philosophy, but in the 15th century the focus and contemplation of the fundamental problems of religion were removed
 vishvavidhyalayon main dharmapandit gaun prashnon ke vishay main apane matbhedon ko adhik mahatv dene lage the jisase katholic dharmavigyaan itan nishpraan ho gaya tha ki kuch saadhakon kii yah dharna drudh ho gai thi ki dharmavigyaan sadhana main baadhak he
 Thus we see that there was a need for reform in all the areas of the church and the movement for reforms became imperative
 14veen shatabdi main angarej vicliff or baad main bohemia ke na hus jo sikhalaane lage the ki carch kaa sanghathan, uske sanskaar aadi yah sab manushyon kaa avishkaar he; isaayiyon ke liye bible hi paryaapt he
 Even at that time those ideas did not get much success, but their influence on Luther is obvious
 spain main tolido ke arbobishap cemeness ne carch ke anushaasan ke andar dharmasudhar andolan pravartit kiya jisase vahaan kaa vaataavaran purna rup main badal gaya kintu pashchimi europe main carch kii paristhiti main koi vishesh parivartan nahin ho paaya tha
 When Luther raised his voice against Rome, he had unprecedented success for another reason
 europe main us samay sarvatra pracheen unani tath latin sahitya kii lokapriyata ke saath saath ek naveen saanskrithik andolan prarambh hua jise rinesaan athwa navajagaran kaha gaya he
 As a result, a sense of personal freedom arose in the people
 mudran ke avishkaar ke kaaran isi samay se bible kii mudrit pratiyaan adhik saraltapurvak sulabh hone lagi thim, jisase logon ko apni ore se dharm ke vishay main sochane or bible ko apni nijee vyakhya karne kii pravriti ko bhi protsaahan milane laga tha
 The historical development of the European Reformation is as follows: It began with Luther's rebellion in 1517 AD
 unhone kin paristhitiyon main apana andolan pravartit kiya tha or carch ke kin paramparaagat siddhanto kaa virodh karke kis prakaar ek nayaa dharm chalaaya tha, iskaa varnan vishwakosh main anyatra kiya gaya he 
 At that time all of Germany was divided into about four hundred independent states
 unke adhikansh shaskaon ne katholic samrat charles ke virodh main luther ko sarankshan pradaan kiya or apni praja ko luther ke carch main mila diya
 Soon all the Scandinavian Christians also joined the Lutheran religion
 switsraland main dharmasudhar ke do netaa sarvapradhan the - jurik main jinvagli or janeeva main calovin, donon ke anuyaayi baad main ek hi kelvinist carch main sammilit ho gaye
 The sect also spread to Holland, Scotland and parts of France
 scotland main iskaa naam presbytareey dharm rakhaa gaya he france main pehle luther kaa prabhaav padaa kintu baad main vahaan ke adhikansh protestat dharmavalambee, jo yugani kehalaate hai, calovin ke anuyaayi ban gaye
 His organization was active for a long time as a political party
 england ke raja ne prarambh hi se luther kaa virodh kiya tha
 He also wrote a treatise in which he gave the pope's divine right to matters of religion
 yadhyapi henry jivan bhar apane rajya main protestant siddhanton kaa prachaar rokane kaa prayaas karte rahe, phir bhi unhone vyaktigat kaarnon se 1531 i
 main england kaa carch rome se alag kar diya, is prakaar anglican samudaay prarambh hua tha
 The Protestant ideology had a profound influence on the church during the time of Henry's successors, which is now considered one of the three major branches of Protestant religion, but the Anglican community in fact has its own distinct history of origin, development and propagation
 in teen sampradaayon ke atirikt dharmasudhar andolan ke falswaroop protestant dharm ke or bahut se upsampradaayon kaa udbhav hua jinka yahan par ullekh karnaa anaavashyak he
 Some details of the sects which are of relatively more importance are given elsewhere in the dictionary
 is simhavlokan se spasht ho jaataa he ki luther dwaara pravartit sudhaar andolan ne vibhinn rup dhaaran kar samast europe ko hilaa diya
 Initially the reform of the church was the aim of this movement, but it soon began to attack the traditional education of the church and the organizational unity of the church
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki europe ke isaisansar kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Completely independent sects emerged from the point of view of governance, which, while believing the same Jesus and the Bible, give different opinions about many fundamental religious principles
 raajnneetik drushti se dharmasudhar kaa parinaam bahut hi vyapak rahaa
 The later condition of Europe was such that the rulers too inevitably took an active part in this religious movement
 ve apni praja ko apane hi dharm main sammilit karne athwa banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Thus many wars in the name of religion are discussed in the history of Europe, such as the 30-year war in Germany, the Yugno War in France and the successful freedom struggle against Emperor Charles v in Holland
 upar iskaa ullekh ho chukaa he ki katholic carch main samay samay par sudhaar andolanon kaa pravarttan hota rahaa he kintu 16veen shatabdi ke vidrohatmak dharmasudhar se katholic carch ko vishesh rup se prerana mili
 This century saw the election of talented individuals as pope who have again given priority to spirituality under the rule of the Church, which again led to the reappearance of the pope in the entire Catholic world
 bishpon kii samantshahi ko samaapt kar diya gaya or chaaron or sadhuswabhaav vyaktiyon kii niyukti se janata ke saamne bishap kaa pracheen adarsh ubharne laga, jo apni praja kaa dharmaguru evam aadhyatmik charvaaha he
 The 19th World Assembly of the Church was organized in the city of Trent, in addition to the new organization of the Church, in particular the teaching of ordinary priests was arranged
 at: carch kii sabhi shreniyon main sudhaar hua or jansadharan main dharmik shiksha kaa uchit prachaar ho sakaa
 In this work, religious leaders have shared the hands of other priests
 16veen shatabdi main jesuit aadi kai dharmasanghon kii sthapana hui tathaa pracheen dharmasanghon main sudhaar laayaa gaya jisase ve sabake sab samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dharm kii seva kar saken
 In this way, we see that perhaps the most profound and beneficial effect of the Reformation was on the old Catholic Church
 europea dharmasudhar kaa vyapak prasar evam gaharaa prabhaav dekhakar anayas hi man main yah prashn uthta he ki is apurv safalataa kaa kya rahasy he
 Several reasons for this success have been conceived: 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main katholic carch kii dayaneey dasha or iske karnadhaaron kii niskriyata, carch kii sampati hadapney ko utsuk rajanetaaon kii sahaayta, navajagaran ke kaaran vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa andolan, mudran ke avishkaar se prachaar kii nai suvidhaayen
 All this proved to be helpful for the under-reported movement, but the secret of its success must be found elsewhere
 dharmasudhar ke pravartak satvik or dharmik bhav se prerit the or ve apane pratibhashali sahyogiyon main bhi dharmik navajagaran kii utkar abhilaashaa utpann karne main samarth hue
 In his view, the only remedy for that renaissance seemed to be that man would not surrender to Jesus by believing in his virtuous deeds, and believe in the Bible's gospel of Jesus safely
 unhone bible ko apane andolan kaa aadhaar bana liya, bible main jo shakti nihit he usee ke dwaara unhen safalataa mili he
 Nowadays 16th century events are being considered in the Christian world in neutral terms
 kathilak europea dharmasudhar kii rachanaatmak uplabdhiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or protetianst samajhane lage hai ki carch kii tatkaaleen buraaiyon kaa virodh karnaa kitna hi aavashyak kyon na tha, uski ekta chhin bhinn karne se isai dharm ko bahut haani hui he
 After the Second World War, the movement for Christian unity has been given utmost importance and the desire to remove the ill effects of the reforms is increasing
 martin luther ke purv dharmasudharkon ne chaudaavin sadi se hi carch or popashahi kii aniatikta, bhrashtataa, vilasita or shoshan ke viruddh apni aawaaj buland kii or unhone dharm sudhaar kii prishth bhoomi taiyaar kii

 But liberalism is impaired in influencing manpower, this failure in this direction has been proved after many years

 In fact, its great inability to reorganize by mobilizing public enthusiasm has been proved

 Nevertheless its fundamental principles are freedom of research and thought, freedom of speech and exchange are still required, because without these, rational thought and action cannot be possible

 star-delta parivartan ek ganitiya takanic he jo kisi vidyut paripath ke vishleshan ko saral bana detaa he
 It is also known as Y-delta, Y-delta, delta-star transformation, star-mesh transformation, T-Π or T-pi transformation
 iskaa yah naam vidyut paripath kii akruti ke aadhaar par padaa he jo ki roman akshar y or greek aksharδ jaise dikhti hai
 This circuit change was published in 1899 by Arthur Edwin Kennedy
 vastut: yah parivartan teen-siron vaale do networkon main tulyata sthapit karata he
 For equivalence it is necessary that both networks should have the same impedance between any two ends
 The general idea is to compute the impedance r y { \ displaystyle R_{y}} at a terminal node of the y circuit with impedances r ′ { \ displaystyle R'}, r ′′ { \ displaystyle R''} to adjacent nodes in the δ circuit by where r δ { \ displaystyle r _ { \ Delta}} are all impedances in the δ circuit
 This yields the specific formulae The general idea is to compute an impedance r δ { \ displaystyle R_{ \ Delta }} in the δ circuit by where RP = r 1 r 2 + r 2 r 3 + r 3 r 1 { \ displaystyle R_ {P} = R_ {1} R_ {2} + R_ {2} R_ {3} + R_ {3} R_ {1 }} is the sum of the products of all pairs of impedances in the y circuit and r opposite { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {opposite}}} is the impedance of the node in the y circuit which is opposite the edge with r δ { \ displaystyle r _ { \ Delta}}
 The formula for the individual edges are thus In graph theory, the Y-Δ transform means replacing a y subgraph of a graph with the equivalent δ subgraph
 The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of cycles
 Two graphs are said to be Y-Δ equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Δ transforms in either direction
 For example, the Petersen graphs are a Y-Δ equivalence class
 Given the values of r b { \ displaystyle R_ {b}}, r c { \ displaystyle R_ {c}} and r a { \ displaystyle R_ {a}} from the δ configuration, we want to obtain the values of r 1 { \ displaystyle R_ {1}}, r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {2}} and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_ {3}} in the equivalent y configuration
 In order to do that, we will calculate the equivalent impedances of both configurations in N1N2, N1N3 and N2N3, supposing in each case that the omitted node is unconnected, and we will equal both expressions, since the resistance must be the same
 The resistance between N1 and N2 when N3 is not connected in the δ configuration is In the y configuration, we have By similar calculations we obtain and The impedances for the y configuration can be derived from these equations by adding two equations and subtracting the third
 For example, adding and, then subtracting yields and hence and Let RT = r a + r b + r c { \ displaystyle R_ {T} = R_ {a} + R_ {b} + R_ {c}}
 We can write the δ to y equations as Multiplying the pairs of equations yields and the sum of these equations is Now we divide each side of by r 1 { \ displaystyle R_{1}}, leaving Using in, we have and by definition of r t { \ displaystyle R_{T}} which is the equation for r c { \ displaystyle R_ {c}}
 Dividing by r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {2}} and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_ {3}} gives the other equations
 star-delta parivartan kaa upyog networkon ko sarlikrut karke unka vishleshan karne main hota he
 Just as the resistors connected in series or parallel order are simplified by replacing them with an element, similarly in more complex networks the star is facilitated by delta or by changing the delta to star
 yah neeche ke udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega- Conversely, using Δ-Y, adding a new node can also simplify in the following way: en;y-delta transformation [[category: Electrical Products saatvin se barahavin sharabdi tak puure bharat main is style kaa pramukh sthaan tha

 prayek laghu-film kii kathavstu aam taur par jeri ko pakadaney ke liye tom ke asankhya prayaason or parinamswaroop hui hathapayee or tabaahi par aadhaarit he
 Because Tom seldom attempts to eat Jerry, and since some of the cartoon shorts seem to pair really well with each other, it's still unclear why Tom, Jerry's So much follows
 prastut kuch kaarnon main saamaanya chaalaaki / chuhon ke prati bair, apane maalik ke aadeshaanusaar duty, tom ko saunpe gaye kaaryon ko jeri dwaara bigaadane kii koshish, jeri dwaara tom ke maalik kaa bhojan kha janaa, jisaki nigaraanee kaa jimmaa tom ko saunpa gaya he, badale kii bhaavana, jeri dwaara tom ke anya sambhavit shikaron ko khaae jane se bachaana, duusari billi se pratispardhaa or tom dwaara chaalaak mohini billiyon ko bahakaane kii koshishon ko naakaam karnaa, jo anya kaarnon ke alaava jeri ghrinaa yaa irshyaavash karata he
 Tom rarely succeeds in capturing Jerry because of Jerry's cunning, clever abilities and luck
 dilachasp baat yah he ki kai sheershak cardon main tom tathaa jeri ek duusare par muskuraate hue dikhaae gaye hai, jo prayek cartoon main duusare par pradarshit atyadhik jhunjhalaahat ke bajaay pyaar-taqaraar kaa rishta ankit karata he
 There are many such illustrations in cartoons, where they express genuine friendship and concern for each other's well being
 laghu-film ke kuch ank theatre anemation main izad kiye gaye kuch zordaar parihaason ke liye mashhoor hai: jeri kaa tom ke do tukade kar dena, uskaa sir khidki yaa daravaaje main band kar dena, tom dwaara kulhadi, pistaul, visphotakon, fandon or zehar se jeri kii hatya kii koshish karnaa, vaifal aayran main tom kii poonch thunsna, use refrigerator main dhakelnaa, uski poonch ko bijli ke socket main lagaana, use sonta, chadi yaa bada hathoda lekar jor se maarthe hue, ek ped athwa ek bijli ke khambhe se use zamin par giraanaa, uske pairon main maachis kii tilia chipka kar unhen jalaana aadi
 Despite the popularity, Tom and Jerry have often been criticized as overly violent
 :42 :134 lagaataar hinsa kii ghatnaon ke baavjood, mul cartoonon ke kisi bhi drishy main koon athwa jamaa hua koon nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 However, in a very rare instance, when Tom cuts to pieces in the opening nomenclature of Tom and Jerry: The Movie, the blood can be clearly seen
 barambar ghatit ek parihaas main jeri, tom ko tab martha he jab vah soch main duba rahata he, jahaan shuruuaat main tom ko dard kaa ehsaas nahin hota - or kuch kshanon baad hi us par dard kaa asar hota he or thik iske vipareet; ek anya parihaas main jeri, peechha karte hue tom ko bich main roktaa he, isse pehle ki tom kuch kar paae, vah usko chot pahunchaa detaa he
 The cartoon is also notable for its dependence on the unchanged form, such as darkening the characters after the explosion and the use of heavy and large shadows
 har rose ghatit vishyon or ghatnaon ke prati samanta hi yaqinan is shrinkhalaa main hasya drishyon kaa pramukh aakarshan he
 The characters regularly transform themselves into ridiculously familiar shapes, often inadvertently, in a gruesome manner
 sangeet laghu-filmon main bhidant par jor dete hue, paaramparik dhwani-prabhaavon ko bharte hue or drishyon ko bhaawanaaon se bhar detaa he
 Music director Scott Bradley created intricate compositions, combining jazz, classical and pop music; Bradley often repeated contemporary pop songs, as well as songs from MGM films including The Wizard of Oz and Meet Me in St
 Louis
 In general, the dialogue is very short, as Tom and Jerry almost never talk, but younger characters
 Is thus not limited
 udaahranarth, bhaag lene vaale prayek ank main maimi tu shoes kirdaar ke liye samvaad hai, sivaay da little orfan ke
 Most of Tom and Jerry's dialogues are loud laughs or gasps, which are provided by a horn or other musical instrument

 tom ek roosi nila billaa he, jo laad-pyaar bharaa jivan vyateet karata he, jabaki jeri ek chota bhure rang kaa gharelu chuha he, jo hameshaa uske aas-paas bane rahata he
 "tom" is the common name for a male cat or badge
 pehali laghu-film pus gates da boot main tom ko multah "jespar" naam se pukaara gaya, jabaki jeri ko jinks naam diya gaya
 Tom is very quick-witted and thin-skinned, while Jerry is self-reliant and good-for-chance
 jeri apane aakaar kii tulana main, nihaai jaisi chizon ko kaaphi aasaani se uthaane or unase padane vaali chot ko sahane jaisi ascharyajanak taaqat rakhata he
 Despite being more proactive and determined, Tom has no match with Jerry in brains and smartness
 har cartoon ke ant main "aankh kii putali ke gaayab hone" yaa "fed out" hote-hote saamanytah jeri jeet jaataa he, jabaki tom ko haara hua dikhaaya jaataa he
 Nevertheless, on rare occasions other results may also emerge, usually Tom wins when Jerry is the attacker or he crosses a boundary
 kabhi-kabhi, praayah vidambnaapurvak, donon haar jate hai, khaas taur par jab jeri kaa aakhri jaal tom ko prabhavit karne par sambhavit tareeqe se us par ulta padataa he
 Or when Jerry ends up chasing something at the end
 kabhi-kabhi, akhir main ve donon dost ban jate hai 
 Both characters exhibit sadistic tendencies, in which they enjoy harassing each other
 tathaapi, cartoon ke aadhaar par, jab bhi kisi ek kirdaar par maut kaa khatara mandaraata he, duusare main vivek jagata he or vah use bachaa letaa he
 Sometimes, they become attached to each other as a result of an unpleasant experience and their attacks on each other are more than just a game
 kai laghu-filmon main kaafii aasaani se donon main patate hue dikhaaya gaya hai or jab halaat kii maang ho, to apeksha se pare, ve donon ek saath kaam karne kii kshamta rakhte hai, bahudhaa kisi anya paksh ke virudv, jo un donon par atyaachaar karne or unhen nicha dikhaane main safal hota he
 In a short film, Tom first meets Meathead and he and Mangy Mat try to catch Jerry
 lekin jab tom kaa shaitan use jeri kii bajaay methed kaa sir kaat kar use chot pahunchane ke liye baadhya karata he, to sir kaatane ke bajaay vah uske sir par chot se sujan paidaa karata he
 Despite his portrayal of Tom's apparent death in five short films, his death is never permanent; He even reads about his death in previews written in Jerry's diary
 vah mouse trubal or yanki doodle mouse main visphot main mrit dikhaai diya he, jabaki da tu mousakitors main karttan-yantra ke baahar uskaa sir kataa hua he
 Although many of the supporting and minor characters interact, Tom and Jerry rarely do so
 Tom, famously, sings the song while courting the cat; For example, in the 1946 short-film Solid Serenade, Tom Lewis sings Jordan's "is You Or Is You Ain't My Baby" song
 do-teen laghu-filmon main, tom, billi ke saath prem-lila rachaate samay, usase screen abhinayta charles boyar ke samaan french main bol kar pranay nivedan karata he
 Co-director William Hanna voiced the series' most famous sound-effects, Tom's screen-tearing scream, and Jerry's bewildering sip, in addition to giving a number of shrieks, gasps and other vocal effects for the couple
 tom dwaara kiya gaya ekmaatr anya saamaanya swaroccharan tab kaa he, jab koi bahari tatv kisi paridrishy yaa sambhavya ghatana ke asambhav hone kaa daawa karata he, jo ki anivarytah, vyangatmak rup se tom kii yojanaon ko naakaam karne ke liye hote hai - jis bindu par, latheda va chakanachur tom prakat hota he or bhootaha, goonjati main kahata he "dont you bilive it!", jise 1940 dashak ke dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke kuch mashhoor prachaar filmon se liya gaya he
 In issue one, Tom hires a rat slayer who, after failing in several attempts to kill Jerry, shifts his job to the title of Kat killing instead of "mouse", after which Tom reluctantly Speaks this word out loud to himself
 1956 kii ek laghu-film blue cat blues main jeri parshvaswar main katha sunaata he
 In the 1943 short film The Lonesome Mouse, Tom and Jerry are both seen speaking more than once

 In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often encounters the butchery of Butch, a muddy dark street cat who wants to catch Jerry, and Spike, a grumpy, rogue watchman bulldog who tries to harass his son Tyke Wale attacks Tom when he is trying to catch Jerry
 aksar spike hasya abhinayta jimi durant kii awaz or haav-bhaavon kaa istemaal karte hue bolta tha
 Spike's coat has changed to brown and light pink over the years
 1940 ke uttarardh main spike ke bete tike ke pravesh se spike ke kirdaar ko thodaa narm banane or ek asthai nai theatre shrinkhalaa, donon ko badhaava mila
 As stated above, Butch, a black badge in the street, also wants to catch Jerry and eat
 vah tom kaa sabase purana virdohi he
 However, almost all of the digits in which he appears have been enmity with Tom due to his toadal
 kuch cartoonon main buch bataur tom kaa ek dost yaa khaas mitra banakar dikhaai detaa he, jahaan buch tom ke dost, methed or topsi kaa netaa he
 Tom's choices vary many times
 uskaa pehla aakarshan sheki he or vah da jut cat main ghamandi awaz main baatcheet karti he or da mouse kams tu dinar main use "tommy" kah kar pukaarti he
 Tom's second and longest running premiere was Toddles Gaylor, whose Tom and Jerry cartoons never had any dialogues
 shuruuaat se, tom ko ek roodhiwaadee africa-america gharelu naukaraani, maimi tu shoes kaa, saamana bhi karnaa padataa he
 In the opening short films, Mamie is often depicted as a maid looking after the well-to-do house where Tom and Jerry live
 baad main tom and jeri laghu-filmein maimi ke apane ghar main set kiye hue lagate hai
 Her face is never shown, and she usually beats the badge with a sweep of evil
 jab maimi maujuud nahin hoti thi, tab kabhi-kabhaar anya logon ko, saamanyatya gardan ke nichle hisse ko dekh sakate hai
 Mamie appeared in several cartoons until the 1952 push-button kitty

 Producer Fred Quimby, who runs the MGM animation studio, immediately dropped Hanna and Barbara from other one-shot cartoons he was working on and created a series based on cat and mouse

 In the early 1940s, Tom's outline included many details — feathers, multiple wrinkles on the face, multiple eyebrows — that were more streamlined by the late 1940s and looked like a real cat

 Since the original short films by Tom and Jerry were rarely seen by the Ditch / Cinder crew, the resulting films were against the trend and in many ways considered absurd
 kirdaaron ke haav-bhav praayah tej gati se pradarshit kiye gaye, jiske kaaran unki chaal bahut hi dhundhale dikhaai di
 As a result, the animation of the characters felt baffling and sick
 The soundtrack consisted of sparse music, blank sound effects and dialogue, which were mostly whispered and echoes were used instead of speaking

 Jones had trouble adapting his style of Tom and Jerry humor, and in many cartoons, postures, personalities, and style were preferred over the plot
 The characters' formats were slightly altered: Tom was given slightly thicker Boris Carlaaf-like eyebrows, less intricate looks, sharp ears and furry cheeks, while Jerry had big eyes and ears, a light brown color, and a cute, fat boar like Howe

 Amar Ujala - Today dow rabindranath shrivastav hindi ke bhashaachintak evam manishi the
 Prof
 Rabindranath Srivastava was born on 9 July 1936 in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh
 unki praathmik shiksha-diksha gaanv main hi sampann hui
 He was actually a student of science
 lekin unhone sahitya kii ore apana kadam badhaayaa
 His interest in literature moved towards linguistics
 unhone leningrad vishvavidhyalay se bhashavigyaan main doctoret kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He then did a post-doctorate from California
 unhone vibhinn antarrashtriya paramparaon main hue chintanon ko bhartiya bhashaaon ke pariprekshya main vyapak drushtikon pradaan kiya
 He changed the entire landscape of Indian linguistics with his serious writing and ideology
 pro shrivastav bahumukhi pratibha sampann vyakti the
 He was a diligent, inquisitive, spontaneous, humble, disciplinarian, reticent and aware language scholar
 unhen kareeb se jaananevaale or pahchaananevaale atmiyon ke liye ve aadambar rahit vyakti the
 Explaining his personality, his half-hearted Dr
 Bina Srivastava has said in one place - “his personality was very lively
 ve puri tarah ‘life phul’ the
 As soon as reaching, the light would go on
 ghar main unhen koi gambhir vyakti maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hota tha
 His interest was multi-faceted
 cinema, doordarshan, saiyr-sapate, picnic aadi unhen bahut pasand thi
 "
 Prof
 Srivastava did not accept any distinction between humans
 shaayad isiilie ve apane vidhyaarthiyon ko bhi ‘ji’ lagaakar sambodhit karte the
 Prof
 Srivastava constantly pondered over various aspects of language and linguistics
 ve shravanik dhvanivigyaan, saidhantik bhashavigyaan, shailivigyaan, samajabhashavigyaan, anuwaad vigyaan, bhashaa shikshan or computational bhashavigyaan jaise anuprayukt bhashavigyaan ke vividh vishyon ko saath lekar aage bade
 Not only this, he wrote many famous books on the multi-faceted and multi-faceted aspects of literature, culture, education and communication, keeping the language at the center of the Indian context
 unhone apane chaatrajivan main anek kavitaayen likhin
 In the early period of his writing, he created literature by considering poetry, story and criticism as his field
 rus se bhashavaigyanik banakar lautne ke pashchaat unhone hindi bhashavigyaan ko aadhunik bhashashastreey chintan se jodakar dekhne kii pravriti kaa pravartan kiya or is sambandh main kai moulik pustakon kii rachana kii, saikadon lekh - hindi or angrezi donon bhashaaon main likhe
 Also edited many books
 agar pro dilip singh ke shabdon main kahen to "unka sampurna lekhan unke bhashanuragi man kaa svachh chamkila pratibimb he
 To walk with his writings is to walk on the cord of the linguistics of the East and the West, with all your conscious consciousness
 is chetana ke bina unke lekhan kii gaharaai ko maap paanaa sahaj nahin he
 "
 ve yah bhi udghaatit karte hai ki "unhone paashchaatya bhashavigyaan kii parakh karke use yaa to sweekaar kiya yaa uske virodh main apane mat vyakt kiye
 He also put forth the linguistic position of the Third World
 is disha main angrezi, hindi or roosi bhashaa main prakashit unke lekh mile kaa pathar hai
 His articles are related to acoustic phonology, theoretical linguistics, sociolinguistics, stylistics, other language teaching, literacy, computational linguistics, breeder phonology and signology
 in lekhon kaa adhyayan unke chintan kii paridhi or unke kramik vikaas se hamen parichit karaata he
 "
 pro shrivastav ne apni pustakon or lekhon main bhashaa or bhashavigyaan ke vividh pakshon par chintan-manan kiya
 He has always considered language as a symbol and has certified Indian multilingualism as a comfortable communication system of multilingual and multicultural society
 unki manyata he ki "bhashaa kaa gaharaa sambandh samaaj se he or isi kaaran vah vishamarupi hone kii niyati se bandhi he
 Language is literally another name for a set of purposeful styles
 kisi ek bhashaa kii vibhinn sheliyaan aapas main anshatah yaa to saamanjasy kii sthiti main rahati hai yaa phir tanaav kii sthiti main
 The state of cohesion binds the styles purposefully, and tense situations cause competition among them
 bhashaa na keval vyakti ke sangyanatmak bodh kaa pratibimb he balki is sampradaay main vah aisa darpan bhi he jisamen aadharbhoot style anya aropit shaileyon ke saath apane sambandhon kaa chitra bhi pratibimbit karti hai
 It is therefore the responsibility of linguists that within the grammar of a language they also include the arrangement of stylistic variables — combined bylaws
 " 
 Rabindranath Srivastava considers the language not only as grammar but as something more than that
 ve kehete hai ki "hindi maatr vyakaran nahin or na hi vah keval vishisht bhashik sanrachana he
 It is also a social institution in the form of language, a social symbol in the form of culture and in literature it is also an ethnic tradition
 " 
 They consider it more expedient to discuss linguistic community in place of language in the Indian context 
 atah ve kehete hai ki "bhashaa kaa saadhy to sampreshan he, arth vyapaar he or saamaajik vah shakti he jo kisi ek samudaay ke sabhi vyaktiyon ko bhaavana, chintan or jivan drushti ke dharaatal par ek-duusare ke najadik laakar ek ikai main bandhti he
 We refer to this unit as 'linguistic community'
 bhashaai samudaay un vyaktiyon ke sansthagat samooh kaa naam he jo hone ko ekabhashi yaa bahubhashi ho saktaa he par jiske sadsy apni sampreshan vyavastha main samaan rup se bhashik pratikon kaa istemaal karte hai or apane saamaajik vyavhaar main jab kisi bhashaa, boli yaa style kaa chunaav karte hon to uske chunaav kaa aadhaar bhi samaan hota he
 


 so it is necessary for this 'linguistic community' uske sadasyon kii sampreshan vyavastha main samanta ho, Through this communication system, its members should not only be able to exchange views with each other, but also be socially bound together on this basis, sampreshan vyavastha main prayukt honevaali bhashaaon, boliyon yaa shaileyon ke chunaav sambandhi gyaan yaa manovriti kaa aadhaar samandharmee ho, Depending on this common sense and attitude, they are different from or distinct from other linguistic communities, isaki ek aisi aropit bhashaa yaa style kaa pratimaan ho jiske aadhaar par iske sadsy apni jaateey asmita kii pahchaan banaate hon 
 In fact Prof
 Srivastava underscored the need to relate the Hindi question to the Indian cultural and social question, saying, "let us recognize our social identity and in this context rethink the question of linguistic identity
" agar hindi-urdu bhashaa aam janata ke liye ek he to isi kaaran ki vah shaikshanik str par banaae gaye kritrim vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin karti
 She uses language based on her basic structure, nature and rules of Hindi and Urdu
 or is drushti se hindi or urdu ek bhashaa, ek zabaan thaharti hai
 There is no discrimination among the speakers of this one tongue and no difference on the ground of social identity
 " 
 Prof
 Srivastava has also associated Hindi language teaching with Hindi language thinking because teaching cannot be meaningful without understanding linguistic identity
 unki manyata he ki "bhashaa shikshan pranali kaa sambandh ek nishchit prakaar ke prayojanon kii siddhi or ek nishchit prakaar ke dwibhashik prayokta paidaa karne se hai
 "
 pro shrivastav bhashavid hone ke saath-saath sarjak sahityakar bhi the
 It has also been indicated earlier that Srivastava has also written poems
 in kavitaaon ko parakhnaa he to unke bheetar ghota lagaana hoga
 That is, these poems can be opened only with the help of text analysis
 is sandarbh main pro dilip singh kehete hai ki "shrivastav kii ye kavitaayen ‘farmaaishi’ nahin hai
 If it was, they would not have kept it on the screen like this
 abhivyakti ke str par rabindra ji kaa puraa kavy-sansar praudh he or vastu kii drushti se samayik yaa aadhunik
 His poetic expression was how modern from the age of nineteen, it is clear from these poems
 


 Prof
 Srivastava was biased to see the texture of the poem within
 


 ye kavitaayen rup or vastu ke gahare dwandv se rachi gai hai
 These poems will not be judged on the basis of 'what the poet says' but rather their true criterion will be what the poem says
 ’ arthath in kavitaaon kii anugoonj kii pakad ‘paath-vimarsh’ ke raste hi sambhav ho sakegi
 His poems from 1958 to 1967 must be seen in the context of textual criticism
 kam-se-kam yah jaanane ke baad ki ve hindi main pathvaadi aalochana ke pratham pravaktaa the
 "
 pro shrivastav ne apane lekhon me hindi-urdu ke dwandv ke bare main kaaphi kuch kaha he
 His belief has also resulted in poems

 And for us 


 it wasn't the right time
 ham acha kar rahe hai or yah usee tarah he
 

 It's the same way you divorce your wife and she went ahead and succeeded and her career flourished and then you go back and, 'oh my God, she's still cool
 ' 'priye, kya ham waapas ek ho sakate hai?' 'zaraa tehriye


 har chiz bant chuki he or yah usee tarah he
 

 'I don't see it happening yet

 fieldi ke saath dubaara milanaa shandaar tha
 i went to her house, mainly with a desire to meet an old friend

 jonathan or manki, donon ne us mulaaqaat se inkaar kar diya
 i learned a lot together with Fieldi
 i knew that i wanted my friends and missed them, but that meeting confirmed that my path in life was different and it was no longer possible to engage musically or professionally
 jahaan tak manki kii is tippanee kaa sawaal he ki "sab kuch pehle se hi bant chukaa he" vah bhi sahi nahin he
 In fact, since January 2005, since i left Korn and for the next 4 years, Korn failed to give me royalties for the records i had with him
 haalanki, main maanata hum ki yah jaanboojhkar nahin kiya gaya tha
 We are patient and working with their management in trying to resolve financial issues so that "everything can be shared as we accepted long ago in our contract

 i still wish Corn all the best, including all my friends there - Fieldi, Jonathan and Monkey

 At the end of solar eclipse, people say that people should do some work only by taking a bath
 pipal ke ped kaa hindustan or videsh main bhi bahut maanata he
 It is said that the Peepal tree is inhabited by Vishnu, Shani, Hanuman and other gods
 is kaaran logo pipal ke ped ke neeche nahin bytate balki ped kii puja karte he
 On the Peepal tree, people apply kumkum and turmeric to worship and women tie thread around the tree
 pipal kaa ped hame oxygen detaa he
 Some people also say that where God dwells, there is a dwell of evil
 kehete he kii shaam hone ke baad pipal ped ke neeche yaa aas paas bhi nahin janaa chahie, cocuki mana jaataa he kii us samay pipal ke ped par bhoot pret kaa vaas hota he
 So the way we treat the Peepal tree is equally afraid of it
