 In Baburnama, how the king of Malwa was forced to give this legacy to Alauddin Khilji
 uske baad yah dilli sultanate ke uttaradhikariyon dwaara aage badhaayaa gaya or antatah 1526 main, babar kii jeet par use praapt hua
 Although Baburnama was written in 1526–30, its sources are not known
 usne is heere ko sarvada iske vartmaan naam se nahin pukaara he
 Rather, after a controversy, it was concluded that Babur's diamond was later called Kohinoor
 babar evam humayu, donon ne hi apni aatmakathaaon main, babar ke heere ke udgam ke bare main likhaa he
 This diamond was earlier with the Kachwaha rulers of Gwalior, from whom it reached the Tomar kings
 antim tomars vikramaditya ko sikandar lodhi ne haraaya, va apane adheen kiya, tathaa apane saath dilli main hi bandi bana kar rakhaa
 After Lodhi was defeated by the Mughals, the Mughals plundered his property, but Prince Humayun meddled and got his property back, but instead liberated him and took refuge in Mewar, Chittor
 humayu kii is bhalaai ke badale vikramaditya ne apana ek bahumoolya hira, jo shaayad kohinoor hi tha, humayu ko saabhaar de diya
 But Humayun's life was very unfortunate
 vah shershah suri se haar gaya
 Suri also died by burning with a cannonball
 uskaa putr va uttaradhikari jalaal khan apane saale dwaara hatya ko praapt hua
 That brother-in-law was also overthrown by one of his ministers
 vah mantri bhi ek yuddh ko jitate jitate aankh main chot lag jane ke kaaran haar gaya, va sltanat kho baitha
 Humayun's son Akbar never kept this gem with him, which later went directly to Shah Jahan's treasury
 shahjahan bhi apane bete aurangzeb dwaara takhtapalat kar bandi banaaya gaya, jisane apane anya teen bhaaiyon kii hatya bhi kii thi
 Shah Jahan rooted Kohinoor in his famous Peacock-throne
 uske putr aurangzeb ne apane pita ko kaid karke agra ke kile main rakhaa
 It is also a legend that he placed the Kohinoor near the window in such a way that, inside it, Shah Jahan could see the image of the Taj Mahal
 kohinoormugalo ke paas 1739 main hue irani shaasha nadir shah ke akraman tak hi rahaa
 He looted fiercely in Agra and Delhi
 vah mayur singhaasana sahit kohinoor va agaadh sampatti faras lut kar le gaya
 On receiving this diamond, Nadir suddenly left the face of Shah: koh-i-noor, from which it got its current name
 1739 se purv, is naam kaa koi bhi sandarbh gyaat nahin he
 Kohinoor's assessment comes from a legend by Nadir Shah
 uski rani ne kaha tha, ki yadi koi shaktishaalee maanav, paanch pattharon ko chaaron dishaao, va upar kii ore, puri shakti sahit phenke, to unke bich kaa khaali sthaan, yadi suvarna va ratnon maatr se hi bharaa jaye, unke baraabar isaki keemat hogi
 In 1747, after the assassination of Nadir Shah, it passed into the hands of Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan
 1830 main, shuja shah, afghanistan kaa tatkaaleen padchyut shaasha kisi tarah kohinoor ke saath, batch niklaa; va punjab pahunchaa, va vahaan ke maharaja ranjit singh ko yah hira bhent kiya
 In its replacement, Ranjit Singh had prepared the East India Company to send its troops to Afghanistan, win the Afghan throne and bring back Shah Shuja
 ranjit singh, ne swayan ko punjab kaa maharaja ghoshit kiya tha
 In 1839, on his death bed, he wrote to Kohinoor to donate to Puri, Odisha famous Sri Jagannath, temple
 kintu uske antim shabdon ke bare main vivaad uthaa or antatah vah puure naa ho sake
 On March 29, 1849, hoisted the British flag at the Lahore Fort
 is tarah punjab, british bharat kaa bhaag ghoshit hua
 An important part of the Treaty of Lahore was as follows: "the jewel named koh-i-noor, taken from Maharaja Ranjit Singh from shah-shuja-ul-mulk, will be handed over to the Queen of England by the Maharaja of Lahore
 " The Governor General was in charge of this treaty, Lord Dalhousie, whose desire to acquire the Kohinoor was one of the main reasons for this treaty
 inke bharat main kaary, sadaa hi vivaad grast rahe, va kohinur arjan kaa krity, bahut se british tikaakaron dwaara, aalochit kiya gaya he
 However, some even proposed that diamonds should have been presented directly to the Queen, rather than being snatched away; But Dalhazi considered it a reward for war, and saved it in the same way
 baad main, dalhauzi ne, 1851 main, maharaja ranjit singh ke uttaradhikari dalip singh dwaara maharani victoria ko bhent kiye jane ke prabandh kiye
 Thirteen years old, Dalip traveled to England, and met him
 yah bhent, kisi ratna ko yuddh ke maal ke rup main sthanantaran kiye jane kaa antim drushtaant tha
 In 1851, at a huge exhibition in Hyde Park, London, it was shown to the British public
 ratna ke kataav main kuch badlaav hue, jinase vah or sundar prathit hone laga
 In 1852, in the presence of Victoria's husband Prince Albert, the diamond was cut again, reducing it from 186 1 / 6 carats to 105
602 carats, but its aura increased manifold
 albert ne budhimata kaa parichay dete hue, acchhee salahon ke saath, is kaary main apana ativ prayaas lagaaya, saath hi tatkaaleen 8000 pound bhi, jisase is ratna kaa bhaar 42% ghat gaya, parantu albert phir bhi asantusht the
 Diamonds were inlaid with another two thousand diamonds in the crown
 baad main, ise maharaja kii patni ke kirit kaa mukhya ratna jadaa gaya
 Queen Alexandria was the first queen to use it
 inke baad maharani mairi thim
 In 1936, it was crowned by Queen Elizabeth's crown
 2002 main, ise unke taabut ke upar sajaayaa gaya
 The story of 'kohinoor', the world's rarest and most prized diamond, reaching the crown of the Queen of Britain extends from the Kurukshetra of Mahabharata to the poor laborer's hut of Golconda
 britain kii maharani ke taj main jadaa or duniya ke anek baadshahon ke dilon ko lalachaane kii kshamta rakhane vaala anokhaa kohinoor duniya main aakhir kahan se aayaa, is bare main aitihaasik ghatnaon ke alaava bahut si kathaayen or kinvadantiyaan bhi prachlit hai
 This diamond has been a witness to many wars, intrigues, greed, bloodshed and victory
 duniya ke sabhi hiron kaa raja he kohinoor hira
 Its story is also no less exciting than fairy tales
 kohinoor ke janm kii pramanit jaankaree nahin he par kohinoor kaa pehla ullekh 3000 varsh pehle mila tha
 Its relation is told from Shri Krishna period
 puraanon ke anusaar swayantak mani hi baad main kohinoor kahalaayi
 Karna then got Arjuna and Yudhishthira from Surya
 phir ashok, harsh or chandragupta ke haath yah mani lagi
 In 1306, this gem was first seen near Ramdev, the Maharaja of Malwa
 malwa ke maharaja ko parajeet karke sultan alaudin khilji ne mani par kabja kar liya
 This unmatched diamond passed from Babur to the last Mughal emperor Aurangzeb
 ’jwels of bitrain’ kaa maananaa he ki san 1655 ke aasapaas kohinoor kaa janm hindustan ke golkunda jile kii kohinoor khan se hua
 The diamond then weighed 787 carats
 ise bataur tohfa khan maalikon ne shahjahan ko diya
 Heera stayed with Shah Jahan till 1739
 phir ise nadir shah ke paas rahaa
 Nadir Shah named it Kohinoor after seeing its glittering glow
 kohinoor ko rakhane vaale aakhri hindustani punjab kaa ranjit singh tha
 After taking over the power of Punjab in 1849, Kohinoor fell into the hands of the British
 phir san 1850 main east india company ne hira maharani victoria ko bhent kiya
 England reached and reached Kohinoor weighing only 186
 maharani victoria ke johari prince elwet ne kohinoor kii pun: kataai kii or polish karwaai
 Since 1852, the weight of Kohinoor has remained at 105
6
 san 1911 main kohinoor maharani mairi ke sartaaj main jadaa gaya
 And still in the same crown
 ise landan sthit ‘tower of landan’ sangrahalay main numaaish ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 After the long story of this diamond, many countries have been claiming it
 1976 main, pakistan ke pradhan mantri zulfikaar ali bhutto ne british pradhan mantri gym calleghan ko pakistan ko waapas karne kaa anurodh kiya, jise unhone ek namr "nahin" main uttar diya
 
 The other claim was made by India

 At present, efforts have been issued to bring it back to India
 aazaadee ke fouran baad, bharat ne kai baar kohinoor par apana malikana haq jataayaa he
 Katherine, the daughter of Maharaja Dilip Singh, died in 1942, which could give convincing arguments regarding the Indian claim of Kohinoor
 anuwaad nivedit Apart from Kohinoor from the mines of Golconda, India also produced many precious diamonds of the world

 File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 Part of a category on Sikhism sikh dharm ek akeshwarwadi dharm he
 Followers of this religion are called Sikhs
 sikhon kaa dharmik granth shri aadi granth yaa gyaan guru granth sahib he
 Usually 10 Satgurs of Sikhs are considered, but the religious text of Sikhs is composed of 30 Bhagats including 6 Gurus, whose same Sikhs are considered important for walking on the Sikh path
 sikhon ke dharmik sthaan ko gurudwara kehete hai
 Born in Punjab in 1469 AD, Nanak Dev discovered Gurmat and spread the Sikh teachings of Gurmat by going to the country longitude itself
 sikh unhen apana pehla guru maanate hai
 Gurmat was considered by the remaining 9 Gurus
 10ve guru gobind singh ji ne ye parchaar khalsa ko sonpa or gyaan guru granth sahib kii sikhyaon par amla karne kaa upadesh diya
 The saints Kabir, Dhana, Sadhana, Ramanand, Parmanand, Namdev Itiyadi, whose Bani etc
 are recorded in the scripture, also consider those Bhagats as Sikh Satgurus and try to follow their teachings
 sikh ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ve ek-onkaar kehete hai
 They believe that God is famine and nirankar
 bharat main sikh panth kaa apana ek pavitra evam anupam sthaan he sikhon ke pratham guru, gurunanak dev sikh dharm ke pravartak hai
 He dispelled the evil practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisies prevalent in the Indian society of his time
 unhone prem, seva, parishram, paroapkaar or bhai-chaare kii drudh niv par sikh dharm kii sthapana kii
 Not surprisingly, from a liberal perspective, Guru Nanak Dev embraced the goodness of all religions
 unka mukhya upadesh tha ki ishwar ek he, usee ne sabko banaaya he
 Hindu Muslims are all children of the same God and all are equal for God
 unhone yah bhi bataaya he ki ishwar satya he or manushya ko achche kaary karne chahie taaki paramatma ke darbar main use lajjit na hona pade
 Guru Nanak has said in one of his books that Pandits read pothi, but do not understand the idea
 dusron ko upadesh dete hai, isse unka maaya kaa vyapaar chalata he
 His words are false, he wanders into the world
 inhen sabad ke saar kaa koi gyaan nahin he
 These pundits are still in debate
 guru arjuna dev to yahan tak kehete hai ki paramatma vyapak he jaise sabhi vanaspatiyon main aag samaayi hui he evam doodh main ghi samaaya hua he
 In the same way, the light of the divine is prevalent in everyone, the divine is spread in all its parts
 sikh dharm ko majboot or maryadasmpann banane ke liye guru arjuna-dev ne aadi granth kaa sampadan karke ek bahut bada aitihaasik evam shaashvat kaary kiya
 He also honored the compositions of 15 saints and 14 creators with five Sikh Gurus in the Adi Granth
 in paanch guruon ke naam hai- guru nanak, guru angaddev, guru amardaas, guru ramdaas or guru arjunadev
 Guruji showed his benevolent humanist vision by storing the speech of 15 saints in Shaikh Farid, Jayadeva, Trilochan, Sadhana, Namdev, Veni, Ramananda, Kabir, Ravidas, Pipa, Saitha, Dhanna, Bhikhan, Parmanand and Surdas
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone haribans, balha, mathura, gaynd, nalh, bhall, salh bhikkha, kirat, bhai maradaana, sundardaas, raai balwand evam satta duum, kalsahaar, jaalp jaise 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko aadigranth main sthaan dekar unhen ucch sthaan pradaan kiya
 While doing this amazing work, no limitation of religion, caste, region and language was created in front of Guru Arjun Dev
 unhen maaloom tha in sabhi guruon, santon evam kaviyon kaa saanskrithik, vaicharik evam chintanparak aadhaar ek hi he
 It is noteworthy that when Guru Arjun Dev completed the editing work of Adigranth in 1604 AD, then there were the first five gurus' vaishnas in it
 iske baad guru govind singh ne apane pita guru teg bahadur kii vaani shaamil karke aadigranth ko antim rup diya
 There are a total of 778 posts of 15 saints in the adi-granth
 inamen 541 kabir ke, 122 shaikh farid ke, 60 namdev ke or 40 sant ravidaas ke hai
 One to four positions of other saints have been placed in the Adi Granth
 gauratlab he ki aadi granth main sangrahit ye rachanaayen gat 400 varshon se adhik samay ke bina kisi parivartan ke puri tarah surakshit hai
 But the former Guru Gobind Singh, before his death, appointed Guru Granth Saheb for the spiritual guidance of all Sikhs and the entire Khalsa Panth for 'worldly direction' as 'guru Pad'
 us samay aadigranth guru sahab ke rup main sweekaar kiya jane laga
 Guru Gobind Singh initiated people of all religions and castes into the guru-shishya-tradition to make Sikhism a classic
 unhone aane vaali shatabdiyon ke liye is nae manushya kaa srijan kiya
 This new human being is not always divided into castes and religions, is always committed to the protection of religion, human and country
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii yah sancharana, nihsandeh, sikh maanas kii thati he
 Then, the ultimate goal of Sikhism is human welfare
 kadaachit isi maanav-kalyaan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko ek lambaa patr likhaa tha, jisamen ishwar kii stuti ke saath-saath aurangzeb ke shashan-kaal main ho rahe anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa maarmik ullekh he
 In this letter, the pretext of doing righteous deeds and not shedding the blood of innocent subjects, cracking under the guise of religion and God and warning for lies and like a warrior, is a war to fight in the battlefield
 kaha jaataa he ki is patr ko padhakar aurangzeb kii runh kaanp uthi thi or iske baad vah adhik samay tak jivit nahin rahaa
 Even his inner desire to meet Guruji could not be fulfilled
 yah koi shrey lene-dene vaali baat nahin he ki sikh guruon kaa sahaj, saral, sada or swaabhaavik jivan jin mulyon par aadhaarit tha, nishchay hi un mulyon ko unhone paramparaagat bhartiya chetana se grahan kiya tha
 According to the demand of the country, time and circumstances, he had deeply influenced the political, social, religious, economic and cultural life of the then by changing his personality
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The Sikh Gurus gave a new direction to the religion and social order of their time
 unhone bhakthi, gyaan, upasna, aadhyatm evam darshan ko ek sankeern daayre se nikaalkar samaaj ko us tabake ke bich pahunchaa diya, jo isse purnat: vanchit the
 This awakened the self-realization of the people and a new vision and awareness arose in them, they started recognizing the self-realized experience
 is prakaar nirgun niraakaar param shakti kaa pravaah prakhar evam twarit rup se praapt hua
 Another peculiarity of Sikhism is that Sikh Gurus talked about human beings venturing into life, achieving happiness while earning and attaining God by meditating
 unka maananaa tha ki parishram karanevaala vyakti sabhi chintaaon se mukt rahata he
 Guru Nanak has even said that the person who earns hard work and does some charity in it, he recognizes the right path
 sikh guruon dwaara prarambh kii gai ‘lungar’ pratha vishvabandhutv, maanav-prem, samanta evam udaartaa kii anyatra na pai jane vaali misaal he
 Sikh Gurus also established cultural and moral values that never fade
 unhone apane darshanik evam aadhyatmik chintan se bhaanp liya tha ki aane vaala samay kaisaa hoga
 Therefore, he insisted on alternative thinking against blind copying
 shaareerik-abhyaas evam vinodashiltaa ko jivan kaa aavashyak ang mana
 Punjabi folk songs, folk dances and Hola Mahalla are the inspiration-seeds of the Sikh Gurus at the core of their performance
 in lokgeeton evam lok nrityon kii jaden punjab kii dharti se footati hai or logon main thirakan paidaa karti hai
 Bhangra and Giddha are the cultural pride of Punjab, whose beats are often heard in India and abroad
 punjabi samskruti rashtriyata kaa merudand he
 There is unity in its soul, sympathy, cooperation, compassion and human love in its blood
 punjabi samskruti aadmi se jodatii he or uski pahchaan banaati he
 a Punjabi wandering in any corner of the world is one of its own miniature Punjab
 prayek sikh kii apni swatantra chetana he, jo jivan-sambandhi samasyaon ko apane hi prakaash main sulajhane ke uddeshy se gambheer rup se vichaar karti ai he
 Take the history of the Sikh Gurus, they did not formulate the imperialist concept at all, instead they kept on looking at the humanitarian world through cultural, religious and spiritual harmony
 azaadi ke purv, bharat-paak vibhaajan evam iske baad kai dashakon main punjab main samay-samay par aae hinsaatmak-zalazalon evam nirdayee vidhwanson ke baavjood is dharti ke logon ne apana shantipurna astitv banaae rakhaa he
 The guidance has been flashes
 sikhon ke das guru he
 Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is a religious book of Sikhs
 sikhamat kii shuruyaat hi "ek" se hoti he
 The Sikh scriptures only interpret "one"
 ek ko nirankaar, parbrahm adik gunavachak naamon se janaa jaataa hai
 The form of Nirankar is mentioned at the beginning of Sri Gurugranth Sahib, which is called 'mool Mantra' in common language
 takreeban sabhi dharm isi "ek" kii aradhana karte hai, lekin "ek" kii vibhinn avasthaaon kaa zikr va vyakhya shri guru granth sahib ji main di gai he wo apane aap main niraali he
 The living soul which is formless, has only 4 qualities of Nirankar
 baaki chaar gun praapt karte hi jeev aatma vaapis nirankaar main samaa jaati he, lekin usko praapt karne ke liye jeev aatma ko khud ko gurmat ke gyaan dwaara samajhnaa zaruri he
 It is called "soul contemplation" in Sikhism
 aatma kaa niraakaari swaroop man, chit, surat, budhi, mati adik kii jaankaree sikh dharm ke mul sikhyaon main di jaati he
 By understanding these activities, a person can understand himself
 sikh dharm kii shuruyaat hi aatam gyaan se hoti he
 What is soul? Where did it come from? Why does it exist? What to do is Etihadi is taught by special Sikh propaganda of spirituality
 aatma ke vikaar kya hai, kaise vikaar mukt ho
 The soul itself is part of the nirankar
 iskaa gyaan karavaate karavaate nirankaar kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Sikhism does not believe in personnel philosophy
 anya dharmo kaa kahana he ki prabhu ko ache karm pasand hai or bure karmo waalon ke saath parameshwar bahut bura karata he
 But according to Sikhism, humans cannot do anything themselves
 insaan sirf sochane tak simit he karata vahi he jo "hukum" main he, chaahe wo kisi garib ko daan de rahaa ho chaahe wo kisi ko jaan se maar rahaa ho
 The same thing was made firm by Shri Gurugranth Sahib at the beginning: isi liye gurmat main paap punya ko nahin man jaataa
 If a person performs an action, then that difference should be done by mixing voice with soul
 yahi karn he kii gurmat karm cond ke viruddh he
 Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji tried to liberate the common people from the clutches of the contractors, pandas, pirs etc
 of religion by removing the prevalent practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisy in the Indian society of his time
 nimnlikhit chaar 'padaarth' maanav ko apane jeevankaal main praapt karnaa anivaary he : Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha were not taken into four substances
 shri guru gobind singh ji kehete hai: In Sikhism, devotees and Satgurus have called Nirankar without formlessness
 kyonki sansaarik padaarth to ek din khatm ho jate hai lekin parabrahm kabhi nahin marataa
 That is why it has been called a famine
 yahi nahin jeev aatma bhi aakar rahit he or is sharir ke saath kuch samay ke liye bandhi he
 Its existence is without the body, which is far from the intelligence of the common man
 yahi karn he kii sikhamat murti puja ke sakht khilaaf he
 Satgurus and devotees have treated idol worshipers with blind, animal etiquette words
 us kii tasviir bane nahin ja sakati
 Not only this, any worldly material like Kabar, historical things of devotees and Satgurus, idols are worshiped against the basic principles of Sikhs
 dharmik granth kaa gyaan ek vidhi jo nirankaar ke desh kii taraf lekar jaati he, jiske samaksh sikh natmastak hote hai, lekin dharmik granthon kii puja bhi sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 In Sikhism, every living being is called an avatar
 har jeev us nirankaar kii ansh he
 Any panchi, animal, tree, etc
 are incarnations in the world
 maanush kii yoni main jeev apana gyaan puraa karne ke liye avatarit hua he
 The person is not worshiped in Sikhism as "god forbid that everyone is alive, giving, AK God"
 tamaam avatar ek nirankaar kii shart par puure nahin utarate koi bhi ajooni nahin he
 This is the reason that Sikhs do not consider anyone as God
 haan agar koi avatar gurmat kaa upades karata he to sikh us upadesh ke saath zarur jude rahete hai
 As Krishna has said in the Gita that soul does not die and death does not happen, Sikhism agrees with this, but further Krishna has said that karma is the religion from which Sikhism does not agree
 pigambar wo he jo nirankaar kaa sandesh athwa gyaan aam lokai main baante
 As it is said in Islam that Muhammad is the last prophet, it is said among the Sikhs that "every jug jug bhakta upaaya"
 bhakt same dar same paidaa hote hai or nirankaar kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaate hai
 Sikhism agrees with "la ilaha ill Allah" but only Muhammad is not Rasul Allah
 arjuna dev ji kehete hai "dhur kii bani ai, tin sagali chint mitaai", arthath mujhe dhur se vaani ai he or meri sagal chintaaen mit gai hai kionki jisaki taak main main baitha tha mujhe wo mil gaya he
 Originally, the statement of devotees Avam Satguru was done by Satguru Arjun Dev Ji, which is called Adi Granth, is famous as a religious text of Sikhs
 This book is a true sermon of 36 devotees and it is astonishing that 36 devotees have lectured Nirankar in equal view
 There is no difference in a word
 Along with the Sikh Adi Granth, the Dasam Granth, which is the collection of the speech of Satguru Gobind Singh Ji, is also considered
 This book is under the Khalsa
 But taking knowledge of Adi Granth in the original form is the best practice for Sikhs
 yahi nahin sikh har us granth ko sammaan dete hai, jisame gurmat kaa upadesh he | Adi Granth or Adi Guru Granth or Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Guru Darbar or Pothi Sahib, is a religious book compiled by Guru Arjun Dev, which records the experiences of the spiritual life of 36 devotees
 The Adi Granth is said to be because of the knowledge of "adi" in it
 According to the chanting, "truth" is the beginning
 The scripture that makes it known is called Adi Granth
 Its references are within the text itself
 However, Vidwan says that because this book was not made by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, this is why it is an Adi Granth and Satguru Gobind Singh Ji climbed the 9th palace, hence this Adi Granth was called Jagan Guru Granth
 bhakton evam satguruon kii vaani potheon ke rup main satguru arjuna dev ji ke samay mojood thim | bhai gurdas ji ne yah granth likhaa or satguru arjuna dev ji disha nirdharak bane | unhon ne apni vaani bhi granth main darj kii | yah granth kii kai nakle bhi taiyaar hui | 1430 pages of Adi Granth were standardized by the Khalsa
 dasam granth, sikhon kaa dharmagranth he jo satgur gobind singh ji kii pavitra vaani evam rachnaao kaa sangrah he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji made many compositions during his lifetime, whose small books were made
 un kii maut ke baad un kii dharm patni mata sundari kii ajna se bhai mani singh khalsa or anya khalsa bhaaiyon ne guru gobind singh ji kii sari rachnaao ko iktha kiya or ek jild main chadha diya jise aaj "dasam granth" kaha jaataa he
 Simply put, Guru Gobind Singh ji composed and Khalsa edited
 dasam granth kaa satkar sari sikh kaum karti he
 The Vāsānī of the Dāsam Granth such as Jaap Sahib, Tāva Parsād Savaiye and Chopai Sahib are part of the daily Sajda, Nitnem, of the Sikhs, and these Vanyas are read while making Khande Bate's Pahol, which is called Amrit Chakna in the common language
 takhat hajur sahib, takhat patna sahib or nihang singh ke gurudwaron main dasam granth kaa guru granth sahib ke saath parkash hota hai or rose hukamname bhi liya jaataa he
 The attacks of Sarabloh Granth and Bhai Gurdas are doubtless creations
 However, the Khalsa Mahima is adorned in the Sarbloh Granth which is the authenticated work of Satguru Gobind Singh, the rest of the Srabloh text contains a karma scandal, a person worshiping itiyadi vizhi mojud who is against the basic principles of the Sikhs
 The words of Bhai Gurdas are recorded in the words of idol worship, karma doctrine etc

 vaidic jyotish main mul rup se 27 nakshatron kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 Mrigashira Nakshatra ranks fifth in the counting order of constellations

 As we know you, the constellation in which a person is born has the effect of that particular constellation

 Before he began putting his ideas together, he talked with Damon Lindelof, executive producer of LAST, with whom he had worked at the crossing for three years
 Kring thanks Lindelof for his measures in which he explained how to perform the series on the network and gave feedback on the experiences he had learned while working on the series drama
 The two still negotiate and assist each other's projects
 When Kring told the NBC network about Heroes' plan, he described the network's response as "exciting 


 very good
" He says that he has been a partner with NBC for some time based on running Crossing Jordan as a show-runner for six years
 When he narrated the plan, he described everything in depth, including the mysterious ending
 When the NBC officer asked them what was going to happen next, Kring replied "you just wait and find out
" After the project was approved, a special 73-minute version of the first episode was screened in front of a large audience at the 2006 Comic Con in San Diego
 Initially it was stated that this non-proliferated pilot would not be released, yet it was included in the DVD set of the first season

 When the writing team works on an episode, each writer takes a character and writes the lone scenes around it
 These stories are then added and the episodes are given to the writer
 The system allows each writer to contribute to each episode and enables the writing team to finish the script early so that shooting crews can shoot more scenes at one location
 Tim Kring considers the writing process to be collaborative and says that the collaboration process is important because the production has to shoot multiple scenes in one place
 To do this, several scripts must be prepared
 Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explains that this process is important in a series drama because it is important to know in which direction each character is moving

 In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Tim Kring commented on criticisms from the two seasons and a 15% drop in the series' ratings
 Kring said he made mistakes directing season two
 He thought audiences were looking to "develop the characters and discover their powers", as opposed to season one, when viewers were looking for "thrills"
 Kring also stated that he had problems with the development of the story, stating that the second season "took too much time to become a big story", describing that Peter's hypothesis of a final battle from the viral in the first episode rather than the seventh Should have been He believes that in the context of the main story, it would have been better to bring new characters, such as Eli, instead of a separate story of Maya and Alejandro
 Kring also admitted that he was called "heroes in Japan" The story should have ended more quickly and also that the romantic stories are not going well
 With reference to Claire and West and Heroes and Yeko, he said, "I have seen more believable romance on TV
 In that context, i don't think romance is a natural fit for us

 In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeff Loeb from the production staff at Heroes due to creative differences and budget problems
 As a result, Tim Kring had to refocus on the development of the characters and the simple story series

 " Regarding the show's closing date, Kring commented that, "the show has not yet been thought of ending

 aalochana yaa samalochna kisi vastu / vishay kii, uske lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, uske gun-dosha evam upyuktatta kaa vivechan karne wali saahitiyik vidha he
 The beginning of Hindi criticism is considered to be from the Bharatendu era of the late 19th century
 'samalochna' kaa shabdic arth he - 'acchhee tarah dekhnaa'
 The word 'criticism' is made of 'luch' metal
 'luch' kaa arth he 'dekhnaa'
 The words review and criticism also have the same meaning
 angreji ke 'critisism' shabd ke samanaarthi rup main 'aalochana' kaa vyavhaar hota he
 The word criticism is also used for 'commentary-interpretation' and 'poetry-theory' as practiced in Sanskrit, but Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is clear that modern criticism is something independent of Sanskrit's poetry-theory
 aalochana kaa kaary he kisi sahityak rachana kii acchhee tarah pariksha karke uske rup, ganu or arthvyastha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has given the definition of criticism in these words: arthath aalochana kaa kartavya sahityak kriti kii vishleshan parak vyakhya he
 Criticism analyzes those elements of the synthesis of literature from the life and spirit of life
 sahitya main jahaan raagatatv pradhan he vahaan aalochana main buddhi tatv
 Criticism also assesses historical, social, political conditions and pupils and discusses their impact on literature
 vyaktigat ruchi ke aadhaar par kisi kriti kii ninda yaa prashansa karnaa aalochana kaa dharm nahin he
 Methodism and system are important in criticism for the interpretation and analysis of work
 aalochana karte samay aalochak apane vyaktigat raag-dwesh, ruchi-aruchi se tabhi batch saktaa he jab paddati kaa anusaran kare, vah tabhi vastunishth hokar sahitya ke prati nyaay kar saktaa he
 From this point of view, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered the best critic in Hindi
 aalochana karte samay jin manyataon or paddatiyon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he, unke anusaar aalochana ke prakaar viksit ho jate hai
 Four types of review are generally accepted: - saiddhanthik aalochana main sahitya ke siddhanton par vichaar hota he
 In it, ancient classical poetry - Rasa, Alankar etc
 and modern beliefs and rules of literature are mainly disseminated
 saiddhanthik aalochana main vichaar kaa bindu yah he ki sahitya kaa maandand shastreey he yaa aitihaasik
 The classical form of a norm is static and unchangeable, but considering the criteria as a historical category, their form is variable and developmental
 donon prakaar kii saiddhanthik aalochanaayen uplabdh hai
 But now the importance of the same theoretical criticism which assumes development in the historical process of elements and rules of literature
 nishchit siddhanton keadhar par jab sahitya ke ganu-dosha, shreshth-nikrusht kaa nirnay kar diya jaataa he tab use nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai
 It is also considered a type of moral criticism
 iskaa mukhya swabhaav nyaayadhish kii tarah sahityak kritiyon par nirnay dena he
 Such criticism often uses the principle mechanically
 isliye nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa mahatva kam ho jaataa he
 Although creating a sense of value or superior literature and inferior literature is one of the main religions of criticism, but it is not possible by mechanical use of principles
 'hindi sahitya kosh' main nirnayaatmak aalochana ke vishay main bataaya gaya he: Thus judgment in criticism is not the point of dispute as much as the method adopted for decision
 jasai, ramachandra shukla kii aalochana main mulya nirnay he, lekin uskaa tarika srujanaatmak he, yantric nahin
 Judicial criticism lacks flexibility in both value and method
 is aalochana main kavy kaa jo prabhaav aalochak keman par padataa he use vah sajile pad-vinyas main vyast kar detaa he
 Personal interest is main in this
 prabhavabhivyajunk samalochna koi thaȥk-ǒthakaane kii vastu nahin he
 Neither is its value in the field of knowledge nor in the field of emotion

 If two or more drivers are separated and kept close by an insulating medium, this arrangement is called a capacitor
 in chaalkon par baraabar tathaa vipareet aavesh hote hai
 If the capacitor is connected to a battery, current will not flow through it, but an equal amount of positive and negative charge will accumulate on its plates
 vidyut sandharitra kaa upyog vidyut aavesh, athwa sthir vaidyut urja, kaa sanchay karne ke liye tathaa vaidyut filter, snabar aadi main hota he
 The capacitor consists of two plates of metal with a malleable dielectric material filled in the space between them
 sandharitra ke platon ke bich dhara kaa pravaah tabhi hota he jab iske donon platon ke bich kaa vibhavaantar samay ke saath badale
 For this reason, no current flows in the capacitor in a permanent state when the fixed DC voltage is applied
 kintu sandharitra ke dono siron ke bich prayavarti vibhavaantar lagane par uske platon par sanchit aavesh kam yaa adhik hota rahata he jiske kaaran vahya paripath main dhara bahati he
 DC current cannot flow through the capacitor
 sandharitra kii dhara or uske platon ke bich main vibhavaantar kaa sambandh nimnaankit sameekaran se diya jaataa he- Where : sandharitra ko aaweshit karne main jo kaary karnaa padataa he vah sandharitra main sangrahit ho jaati he
 This energy stored in the capacitor is in the form of an electric field
 sangrahit urja u kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara dwaara abhivyakt hoti he- The value of the energy stored in the unit volume at any point in the electrical field can be given by the following formula- jis prakaar pratirodhon or prerakatvon ko aavashyaktaanusaar shreneekram yaa samaantar kram main jodakar uchit maan tathaa uchit reating praapt kar lee jaati he, usee prakaar do yaa adhik sandharitron ko bhi aavashyaktaanusaar sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Equivalent capacitance of n capacitors connected in series is given by the following formula: do sandharitra shreneekram main jode jaany to unki tulya dharita nimnlikhit saral sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- And if both capacitors are of equal value, then their equivalent capacitance becomes half the capacitance of each, if combined in series
 udhaaharan ke liye 10 micropharad ke do sandharitron ko shreneekram main jodne par tulya dharita 5 micropharad hogi
 The total capacitance of capacitors connected in parallel order is equal to the sum of their capacitances
 udhaaharan ke liye 10 micropharad vaale 4 sandharitra samaantarkram main jod diye jaany to unki kul dharita 40 micropharad ho jaaegi
 Two plates of capacitor can be combined in different ways
 is prakaar sandharitra bhi kai tarah ke hote hai
 The main information about the three main geometry capacitors is given in the table below
 sandharitra ke do chaalkon ke bich ke kuchaalak kii ek mukhya gun uski parmitivity he jo ε se nirupit kii jaati he
 The permittivity of the vacuum is denoted by ε0
