 During the trial, Castro favored his antics and presented his famous "history will find me innocent" speech, after which he was sentenced to 15 years of model imprisonment in Izla de la Yuvantud
 fidel kastro ke giroh ko july 26 ke aandolan ke rup main punahnamakaran karte hue batista sarkaar ne may 1955 main use kshamaa kiya kyonki sarkaar ko fidel se kisi bhi prakaar kii rajnatik chunauti nahin lag rahi thi
 After renewing MR 26-7, Fidel fled to Mexico with his brother Raul Castro

 apane aap raashtrapati ghoshit karte hue batista ne yojanaband raashtrapati chunaavon ko mansookh kiya or apni nai pranali ko "anushaasan-baddh loktantr" qaraar diya
 Like others, Castro also considered it a dictatorship of a person
 batista daayen ore badhkar poonjipatiyon or america se sambandh gahare kiye jabaki soviet sangh se rajanyik sambandh tod liye or mazdoor unionon kaa daman kiya or cuba ke samaajawaadee guton par muqadame darj kiye
 Castro brought several lawsuits against him with the intention of opposing the Batista regime and asserted that Batista had done a lot of criminal work which required his imprisonment and accused many ministers of breaking the labor laws
 kastro ke muqadame jab benattejey dikhaai padane lage, to usne nai sarkaar ko nikaalane ke anya vikalpon par gaur karnaa shuru kiya
 Unsatisfied with the non-violent opposition of Partido Oratodoxo, Castro founded the "movement", a party that had civil and military committees

 Despite Castro's deep connections to revolutionary socialism, he kept himself from joining the Communist PSP because it feared that political moderates would be intimidated, although he personally kept in touch with many PSP members, including his brother Raul Castro was also there

 The subsequent plan was to seize the Santiago radio station, broadcast the manifesto of the movement and air the rebellion

 Those who came in had to face a severe interruption and four were killed in front of Castro

 koran, quran yaa koran islam kii pavithratam kitaab he or isaki neenv he
 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai
 These messages originated with Adam

 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man

 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years, the mark of this civilization on the whole world gives its mark
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts
 udhaaharan ke taur par: "jab al-quran padhaa jaataa he, to ise sunen or chup rahen
 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai
 Each synonym has its own different meaning, but its use can be found with the Quran in some contexts
 is tarah ke shabdon main kitaab, aayah ; or sura shaamil hai
 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha
 Subsequently, he received the revelation of the complete Qur'an over a period of 23 years
 haddees or muslim itihaas ke mutabik, mohammad madina main aakar ek swatantra muslim samudaay kaa gathan karne ke baad, unhone apane kai saathi quran ko padhane or kanoonon ko seekhney or sikhaane kaa aadesh diya, jinhen dainik bataaya gaya tha
 It is related that some Quraysh who were taken as prisoners in the Battle of Badr regained their independence after having taught some Muslims the simple writings of the time
 is prakaar musalamaanon kaa ek samooh dhire-dhire sakshar ban gaya
 As it was said initially, the Quran was recorded on planks, skins, bones, and wooden stems
 musalamaanon ke bich zyaadaatar sure upyog main the kyonki sunni or shiya donon sroton dwaara kai hadison or itihaas main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, mohammad ke islam ke aahvaan ke rup main quran ke upyog se sambandhit, prarthana karne or padhane ke tareeke ke rup main
 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations
 haalanki, mohammad ke aalochakon ne unhen ek vyakti, ek kavi yaa jaadugar hone kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki unke anubhav pracheen arab main aise aankadon dwaara daawa kiye gaye logon ke samaan the
 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632

 is prakaar, shastreey samooh, sabase mahatvapurn zayd bin thabit ne chand ekatra kiye or puri kitaab kaa sankalan karke kuran ko kitaab kaa rup diya tha
 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha
 To preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use the copy of Abu Bakr and produce a standard copy of the Quran
 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death
 is paath kaa kram uthman ke yug ke dauraan baad main ikattha hua tha ki is sanskaran ko kalkram kram main ekatrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran into circulation
 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai

 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'O my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you will not see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world

 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession

 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the

 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time

 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other

 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah

 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part

 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality
 jiske aadhaar par aaj sadiyon baad bhi hazarat mohammad kaa kram vishwa nayakon main pratham mana jaataa he
 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it
 is prishth bhoomi ke kaaran hi koran main kai baar ek hi baat ko baar baar doharaaya janaa lagata he
 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again
 koran ne ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha
 He stood before the two great powers of the world
 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today

 After studying them, he said that the descriptions in the Quran regarding embryology are exactly in line with modern discoveries
 kuch aayaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki ve ise galat yaa sahi nahin kah sakate kyon ki ve khud is baat main anbhigya hai
 It also included the first verse of the Qur'an that was translated

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya
 Healthy differences always help in the progress of the society and factionalism always causes harm
 isliye islamic vidwaanon kii matbhinnata bhi koran haddees main kaary karne or adarsh samaaj kii rachana main sahaayak hui he kintu nuqasaan is matbhinnata ko kattar rup main viksit kar gutbandi ke kaaran hua he
 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the
 The entire Christian and Jewish world has been trying for centuries to somehow prove that the Qur'an is the words of Hazrat Muhammad and is his creation

 yashpal kaa naam aadhunik hindi sahitya ke kathakaron main pramukh he
 They are simultaneously known in both revolutionary and author forms
 premchand ke baad hindi ke suprasiddh pragatisheel kathakaron main inkaa naam liya jaataa he
 Yashpal was associated with the revolutionary movement from his student life, as a result of which he had to spend a long time in jail and jail
 iske baad inhone sahitya ko apana jivan banaaya, jo kaam kabhi inhone bandook ke madhyam se kiya tha, ab vahi kaam inhone bulatin ke madhyam se janajagran kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Yashpal was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1970 by the Government of India in the field of literature and education
 yashpal kaa janm 3 disambar 1903 ko punjab main, firospur chhavnee main ek saadhaaran khatri parivaar main hua tha
 His mother, Mrs
 Premdevi was a teacher in a school in the orphanage there
 yashpal ke pita heeralaal ek saadhaaran kaarobaari vyakti the
 His ancestral village was Rangad, where his ancestors had once settled and settled in Hamirpur
 pita kii ek choti-si dukaan thi or unke vyavsaay ke kaaran hi log unhen ‘lala’ kehete-pukaarte the
 In between, they used to carry goods on horseback and go to the nearby villages for ferrying
 apane vyavsaay se jo thodaa-bahut paisa unhone ikattha kiya tha use ve, bina kisi pukhta likhaa-padhi ke, hath udhaaru taur par sood par uthaaya karte the
 He was uninterested in his family
 isiilie yashpal kii maan apane do beton—yashpal or dharmpal—ko lekar firozpur chhavnee main arya samaaj ke ek skool main padhaate hue apane bacchon kii shiksha-diksha ke bare main kuch adhik hi sajag thim
 His mother and this environment have played a pivotal role in the development of Yashpal's intense hatred towards poverty, the attraction of Arya Samaj and the freedom movement
 yashpal ke rachanaatmak vikaas main unke bachapan main bhogi gai garibi kii ek vishisht bhoomika thi
 In his childhood, Yashpal had heard many stories of terror and strange behavior of the British
 barsaat yaa dhoop se bachane ke liye koi hindustani angrezon ke saamne chaataa lagaae nahin guzar saktaa tha
 The main roads in the big cities and mountains were for them, Hindustani used to walk on the rough roads built under these roads
 yashpal ne apane hosh main in baton ko sirf suna, dekha nahin, kyonki tab tak angrezon kii prabhutaa ko asweekaar karanevaale krantikari andolan kii chingaariyaan jagah-jagah footne lagi thim
 But whatever Yashpal saw in his childhood, it was enough to inflame hatred for the British
 ve likhte hai, ‘‘maine angrezon ko sadak par sarv saadhaaran janata se salaami lete dekha he
 Have seen Hindustani begging in front of him, guessed his disrespect and felt opposition to him
 

’ In the context of his hatred against the British and later British imperialism, Yashpal specifically mentions two incidents of his childhood
 inamen se pehali ghatana unke chaar-paanch varsh kii aayu kii he
 Then one of his relatives was a manager in a cotton ginning factory in Yulekprant
 kaarkaanaa stesan ke paas hi kaam karne vaale angrezon ke do-chaar bangle the
 There was a lot of terror around these people
 inamen se ek bangle main murdiyaan pali thim, jo aas-paas kii sadak par gumti-phirti thim
 One evening Yashpal started teasing those hens
 bangle main rahanevaali mem sahiba ne is harqat par bacchon ke fatkaar diya
 Probably abused someone like 'donkey' or 'owl'
 chaar-paanch varsh ke balak yashpal ne bhi uski gaali kaa pratyuttar gaali se hi diya
 When the woman threatened to kill them, they also responded by threatening her in the same way and then ran away and hid in the factory
 lekin ghatana yun hi taal di janevaali nahin thi
 Complaint was made with his relative
 unhone yashpal kii maan se shikaayat kii or anek ashankaon or aatank ke bich yah bhi bataaya ki isse puure kaarakaane ke logon par kaisaa sankat aa saktaa he
 Then, mentioning its result, Yashpal writes, 'my mother beat me very well with a stick, i went to the ground but was beaten up
 is ghatana ke parinaam se mere man main angrezon ke prati kisi bhaavana utpann hui hogi, yah bhaanp lenaa kathin nahin he
 


 ' duusari ghatana kuch iske baad kii he
 Then Yashpal's mother was headmaster at Arya Kanya Pathshala in Kashipur town of Tirai in Nainital district, in Yuktprant
 shahar se kaafii dur, kaarkaane se hi sambandhi ko bada-sa awaas mila tha or yashpal kii maan bhi vahiin rahati thi
 There was a pond called 'drona Sagar' near the house
 ghar kii striyaan praayah hi vahaan dopaher main ghoomane chali jaati thim
 One day those women were taking a bath there, on the other side of it, two British white soldiers, suddenly appeared
 striyaan unhen dekhakar bhay se chinane lageen or aatmaraksha main ek-duusare se lipatate hue, bhaybheet hokar usee avasthaa main apane kapadeuthakar bhaagane lageen
 Yashpal also eloped with them
 ghatit kuch vishesh nahin hua lekin angrezon se is tarah darkar bhaagane kaa drishy sthaayee rup se unki bal-smriti main tank gaya
 

 'that fear from the British was like seeing a tiger in a flock of goats would be afraid, that is, the English could do anything
 usase darkar rone or chinane ke sivaay doosraa koi upaay nahin tha
 

 ' arya samaaj or congress ve padaav the jinhen paar karke yashpal antat krantikari sanghathan kii ore aae
 His mother wanted to make him a fiery propagator of Swami Dayanand's ideals
 isi uddeshy se unki aarambhik shiksha gurukul kangri main hui
 The seeds of fiery backlash against Arya Samaj oppression fell here on the land of his mind
 yaheen unhen punarutthanavaadee pravritiyon ko bhi nikat se dekhne-samajhane kaa avasar mila
 He also had a painful experience of his poverty here
 apane bachapan main bhi garib hone ke aparaadh ke prati ve apane ko kisi prakaar uttaradaayi nahin samaj pate
 Due to these values, he could never be indifferent to the insult of the poor
 congress yashpal kaa doosraa padaav thi
 Like many others of his era, he too entered politics through Congress
 rajnatik drushti se firozpur chhavnee ek shant jagah thi
 Three miles away from the cantonment there used to be lectures and proms of the city
 khaddar kaa prachaar bhi hota tha
 In 1921, Yashpal was an eighteen-year-old youth at the time of the non-cooperation Movement — full of zeal for patriotism and patriotism, he also participated in the Congress campaign with foreign cloth Holi
 ghar ke hi luggad se bane khaddar ke kurtta-pyjama or gandhi topi pahante the
 He also made a coat of this Khaddar
 baar-baar mailaa ho jane se uubakar unhone use laal rangava liya tha
 In his speeches during this period, as a source of anti-british imperialism statistics, the book he mentions called Desh Darshan is probably Sankharam Ganesh Deuskar's Bengali book Desherkatha published in 1904, whose impression on the Indian public is widespread
 The British government was banned due to the reaction and popularity
 mahatma gandhi or gandhivaad se yashpal ke taatkaalik mohabhang kaa kaaran bhale hi 12 farvari san 22 ko, chaura-chauri kand ke baad mahatma gandhi dwaara andolan ke sthagan kii ghoshnaa rahaa ho, lekin isaki shuruyaat or pehle ho chuki thi
 Gandhi's principle of non-violence went against the agenda of armed revolution of Yashpal and his revolutionary comrades
 mahatma gandhi dwaara dharm or raajnneeti kaa ghaal-mail unhen kahin buniyadi rup se galat lagata tha
 After coming to Lahore after matriculation, Yashpal came into contact with Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Bhagwati Charan Bohra at National College
 noujvaan bharat sabha kii gatividhiyon main unki vyapak or sakriy hissedari vastutah gandhi or gandhivaad se unke mohabhang kii ek anivaary parinaam thi
 The principal sources of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha were Bhagwati Charan and Bhagat Singh
 sake lakshyon par tappanee karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘noujvaan bharat sabha kaa kaarykram gandhivaadi congress kii samjhautavaadi niti kii aalochana karke janata ko us rajnatik kaarykram kii prerana dena or janata main krantikariyon or mahatma gandhi tathaa gandhivaadiyon ke bich ek buniyadi antar kii ore sanket karnaa upyogi hoga
 Despite fierce opposition from Lala Lajpat Rai's Hinduist policies due to the lathi charge on him, which ultimately led to his death, Bhagat Singh and his associates killed Sanders
 is ghatana ko unhone ek rashtriya apmaan ke rup main dekha jiske pratirodh ke liye aapasi matbhedon ko bhula dena jaruri tha
 The bombing by Bhagat Singh in the assembly was a logical culmination of this thinking, but Mahatma Gandhi did not issue any formal appeal, despite widespread pressure from the public to protest against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 apane krantikari jivan ke jo sansmaran yashpal ne simhavlokan main likhe, unamem apni drushti se unhone us andolan or apane saathiyon kaa moolyankan kiya
 He has always emphasized rationality, reality and reliability
 yah sambhav he ki us moolyankan se bahuton ko asahmati ho yaa yashpal par tathyon ko tod-marodakar prastut karne kaa aarope ho
 Even today there are some people, who do not consider Yashpal very good revolutionary
 unke krantikari jivan ke prasang main unke charitrahanan kii durbhasandhiyon ko hi ve puri tarah sach maanakar chalate hai or shaayad isiilie yashpal kii ore meri nirantar or baar-baar vaapasi ko ve ‘ret kii murti’ gadhane-jaisaa kuch maanate hai
 They also see 'revolution' confined to the politics of bomb-holistic politics
 raajnneetik kranti yashpal ke liye saamaajik vyavastha main krantikari parivartan kaa hi ek hissaa thi
 He saw imperialism as an exploitative system which, in Bhagat Singh's words, 'is the extreme form of exploitation of man in the hands of man and nation in the hands of the nation'

 The pillar-jagirdari and Zamindari system of this system were likewise under the main agenda of their opposition
 desh main jis rup main swadhinata ai or bahuton kii tarah, ve bhi santusht nahin the
 More than independence, they considered it a transfer of power
 or yah lagbhag vaisaa hi tha jise kabhi premchand ne jon kii jagah govind ko gaddi par baith jane ke rup main apni ashanka vyakt kii thi
 Revolutionary nations were youth driven by spirit of devotion and sacrifice
 avasar aane par unhone hameshaa balidaan se ise pramanit bhi kiya
 But Yashpal insists on seeing his comrades as jealous, hostile, competition-seeking ordinary humans
 apane sansmaranon main aaj rajendra yadav jise adarsh ghoshit karte hai—‘ve devtaa nahin hai’—uski shuruyaat hindi main vastutah yashpal ke inhen sansmaranon se hoti he
 These revolutionaries were not isolated from ordinary human beings, despite being somewhat different, typical and devoted exclusively to their goals
 ho bhi sakate the
 Sharat Chandra presented the ideal of revolutionaries in Pathredawi, Yashpal considered it to be real, which inspires patriotism, cannot be considered a representative and authentic picture of the revolutionary movement and that life
 subodhachandra sen gupt patheradavi main bijli panivali jhanjhawati raat main savyasachi ke nishakraman ko bhavi mahanayake subhaashachandr bose ke palaayan ke ek roopak ke taur par dekhte hai, jabaki yashpal savyasachi ke atimanviya se lagane vaale kaary-kalapon or khoh-khandhiron main bitaye janevaale jivan ko vaastavik or pramanik nahin maanate
 He uses his long experiences of revolutionary life as the mainstay of his criticism
 2, march san 38 ko jail se rihaai ke baad, jab usee varsh november main yashpal ne viplav kaa prakaashan-sampadan shuru kiya to apane is kaam ko unhone ‘bullate bulatin’ ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 He made writing his base to carry forward the unfinished work of the non-violent and egalitarian society he wanted to build through political revolutionaries
 apane samay kii saamaajik-raajnneetik samasyaon ke kendra main rakhkar likhe gaye sahitya ko praayah hameshaa hi vichaarvaadi kahkar laanchit kiya jaataa he
 This was Nand Dulare Vajpayee's big charge against Premchand
 apane upar lagaae gaye prachaar ke aarope kaa yashpal ne uttar bhi lagbhag premchand kii hi tarah diya
 In the role of his first novel, Dada Comrade, he wrote, 'I have a complaint to the lovers of art that i give priority to art and to the promotion of art
 mere prati die gaye is faisale ke viruddh mujhe apil nahin kerani
 Santosh is able to make his intent clear 


 Later commenting on his literary concerns in more detail, he later wrote, 'the struggle for the complete development and liberation of man is the meaning of the author
 jab lekhak apni kala ke madhyam se manushya kii mukti ke liye puraani vyavastha or vichaaron main antarvirodh dikhaata he or nae adarsh saamne rakhata he to us par adarshaheen or bhautikwaadi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 Today's writer has his roots in reality, so he is not only materialistic but he is also not ideal
 uske adarsh adhik yatharth hai
 When the writer of today supports new ideals through his art, he is accused of being a preacher
 lekhak sadaa hi apni kala se kisi vichaar yaa adarsh ke prati sahanubhuti yaa virodh paidaa karata he
 a meaningful literature will be there
 yashpal ke lekhan kii pramukh vidha upanyaas he, lekin apane lekhan kii shuruuaat unhone kahaniyon se hi kii
 His stories are not beset by the politics of his time, such as his novels
 nai kahani ke daur main stri ke deh or man ke kritrim vibhaajan ke viruddh ek sampurna stri kii jis chhavi par jor diya gaya, uski vaastavik shuruuaat yashpal se hi hoti he
 How many stories of Yashpal have been used as fertilizer in the direction of thinking of today's story
 vartmaan or aagat katha-paridrishy kii sambhaavnaaon kii drushti se unki sarthakata asandigdh he
 His story-collections include cage flight, enlightenment, ashes of chinagari, flower kurta, crusade, why did you say i am beautiful and Uttami's mother is the chief
 jo or jaisi duniya banane ke liye yashpal sakriy raajnneeti se sahitya kii ore aae the, uskaa nakshaa unke aage shuru se bahut kuch spasht tha
 He made the basis of the actual achievements of the system in place of a utopia
 yashpal kii vaicharik yatra main yah sutara shuru se ant tak sakriy dikhaai detaa he ki janata kaa vyapak sahyog or sakriy bhagidaari hi kisi raashtra ke nirmaan or vikaas ke mukhya kaarak hai
 Yashpal is an advocate and patron of the broad interests of the public everywhere
 apni patrakarita or lekhan-karm ko jab yashpal ‘bullate kii jagah bulatin’ ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai to ek tarah se ve apane rachanaatmak sarokaaron par hi tippanee kar rahe hote hai
 This accumulation of representative work of such a bad writer will inspire him to know and understand in its entirety, we believe so

 The philosophy of dialogue is a form of religious existentialism that focuses on the distinction between the i-daw relationship and the i-it relationship
 vienna main janme, buber shraddhalu yahudee parivaar ke the, lekin unhone darshan main dharmanirpeksh adhyayan karne ke liye yahudee prathaon se naata tod liya

 1923 main buber ne astitv par apana prasiddh niabandh likhaa, Ich und Du or 1925 main unhone hebrew bible kaa german bhashaa main anuwaad shuru kiya
 In 1930 Buber became an honorary professor at Frankfurt University Am Mine and resigned from his professorship shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933
 He then established the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews to participate in public education
 In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in Jerusalem, taking a British mandate for Palestine and becoming a professor at the Hebrew University there and lecturing on anthropology and introductory sociology
 buber kii patni paula kii 1958 main mrityu ho gai or 13 june 1965 ko jerushlem ke talbiye main apane ghar par unka nidhan ho gaya
 Martin Buber was born in Vienna to an Orthodox Jewish family
 unke dada, solomon buber jinke lemberg ke ghar par buber kaa adhikansh bachapan beetaa, ve midrash or rabi sahitya ke prasiddh vidwaan the
 Buber spoke Yiddish and German at home
 1892 main, buber apane pita ke ghar lemberg laut aaye
 ek nijee dharmik sankat ke chalate unhone yahudee dharmik prathaon se apana naata tod liya: unhone immanual kant, sorain kircuguard or fredrick nitshe padhanaa shuru kiya
 Especially the latter two personalities inspired him to study philosophy

 1898 main, ve yahudee andolan main shaamil ho gaye or unhone sammelnon or sanghathanaatmak kaaryon main bhaag lenaa shuru kar diya

 Buber's evocative and sometimes poetic writing style features prominent themes in his works: the reestablishment of Hasidic narratives, biblical stories, and spiritual discussions
 ek saanskrithik zionist hote hue, buber israel or germany ke yahudee or shaikshik samudaay main sakriy rahe
 philistin ke liye ve dwi-raashtra samaadhaan ke kattar paksh main the or yahudee rajya israel kii sthapana ke baad unhone israel ke kshetreey sangh or arab rajya kii baat kahi
 unka prabhaav manviki se pare tak jaataa he, vishesh rup se saamaajik manovigyaan, saamaajik darshan, darshanik araajaktaavaad or dharmik astitvvaad
 Buber disagreed with Theodore Herzl's views about the cultural and political direction of Zionism, based on his personal attitude towards Zionism
 herkel ne zionizam ke lakshya ke rup main ek raashtra-rajya kii kalpana kii, lekin yahudee samskruti yaa dharm ko aavashyak nahin mana
 iske vipareet, buber kaa maananaa tha ki zionizam kaa samarthy saamaajik or aadhyatmik samruddhi ke liye he
 Herzl and Buber spent the rest of their lives working towards their respective goals with mutual respect and disagreement
 1902 main, buber, zionist andolan ke kendriya ang, saptahik di velt ke sampadak ban gaye
 However, one year later Buber joined the Jewish Hasidism movement
 buber ne is baat kii prashansa kii ki kaise hasidic samudaay dainik jivan or samskruti main apane dharm ko karyanvit kiya he
 In sharp contrast to the busy Zionist organization, which always considered political concerns, Hasidim focused on the values buber had long advocated for Zionism
 1904 main, buber apane adhikansh zionist sanghathanaatmak kaaryon se peeche hat gaye or khud ko adhyayan or lekhan ke prati samarpit kiya
 That year he published his research: Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems
 1910 se 1914 tak, buber ne mithkon kaa adhyayan kiya or puranic granthon ko prakashit kiya
 In 1916, he moved from Berlin to Heppenheim
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan unhone purvi europe ke yahudiyon kii sthiti main sudhaar karne ke liye yahudee rashtriya ayog kii sthapana main madad kii

 1921 main buber ne franz rozenjwaig ke saath ek ghanishtha sambandh shuru kiya
 In 1922 Buber and Rozenzwaig co-operated Rozenijwaig's House of Jewish Learning, called the Lairhouse in Germany
 1923 main buber ne astitv par apana prasiddh niabandh likhaa, Ich und Du 
 haalanki unhone ise apane jivan main baad main sampadit kiya, unhone isamen adhik badlaav karne se inkaar kar diya
 1925 main franj rozenjwaig ke sangyojan main unhone hebrew bible kaa german main anuwaad shuru kiya
 He himself called the translation Verdeutschung, as it does not always use the literary German language, but attempts to discover a new dynamic equivalent syntax to maintain respect for the original multi-connective Hebrew
 Between 1926 and 1928 Buber edited the quarterly de Creetur)
 1930 main buber francfort vishvavidhyalay am mine main maanad professor ban gaye
 Soon after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, he resigned his professorship in protest
 On 4 October 1933, the Nazi authorities refused to lecture him
 In 1935 he was expelled from the Reichsschrifttumskammer
 iske baad unhone central offis for juish edlt ajukeshan kii sthapana kii, jo teji se mahatvapurn nikaay ban gaya kyonki german sarkaar ne yahudiyon ko saarvajanik shiksha main bhaag lene se manaa kar diya
 naaji prashasan se teji se is sanstha ko baadhit kiya
 Finally, in 1938, Buber left Germany and Mendet settled in Palestine, the capital of Palestine

 unhone philistin main yahudiyon kii samasyaon or arab ke sawaal par charchaa main hissaa liya - jo unke bible sambandhi, darshanik or hasidic kaaryon ke baahar tha
 He became a member of the Ishud group, which aimed at the creation of a bi-national state for Jews in Arabia and Palestine
 puri tarah se yahudee rajya ke nirmaan kii tulana main is tarah ke ek dwi-rashtriya sangh se buber ke anusaar zionizam kaa uchit anupaalan hota he
 In 1946 he published Paths in Utopia, in which he described his commune-based socialist views and spoke of his "communicative community" theory, which was based on mutual "interactive relations"
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad buber ne sanyukt rajya america or europe main vyaakhyaan dene shuru kiye
 Buber is noted for his synthetic thesis of interactive existence, as he described in the book i and Tum
 haalanki, apane kaaryon main unhone vibhinn vishyon kii charchaa kii he, jisamen shaamil he dharmik chetana, aadhuniktaa, buraai kii avadharana, naitikta, shiksha or bible sambandhi hermeneutics
 Among me and you, Buber presented his research on human existence
 foirbakh ke da essence of chrischienity or kircuguard ke "single van" se aanshik rup se prerit hote hue, buber ne muthbhed ke rup main astitv ke aadhaar par kaam kiya
 He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of ish-do and ish-es and the consciousness, interaction and existence whereby a person makes contact with other persons, inanimate objects and all reality in general
 darshanik rup se, ye shabd jode astitv ke prakaaron ke bare main jatil vichaar vyakt karte hai - vishesh rup se kaise ek vyakti jivit rahata he or us astitv ko kriyanvit karata he 
 jaisaa ki buber main or tum main tark dete hai, ek vyakti in vidhiyon main se ek main duniya ke saath har samay sanlagn rahata he
 The caste designation Buber uses to describe dual forms of existence is dialogue and monologue
 The concept of dialogue, especially language-oriented dialogue, is used to describe dialogue / monologue through metaphors and to express the reciprocal nature of human existence
 ish-du ek sambandh he jo do praaniyon ke aapasi, samgr astitv par jor detaa he
 This is a solid face-to-face, as these two beings meet each other in their authentic existence, without any merit or questioning each other
 yahaan tak ki kalpana or vichaar bhi is sambandh main ek bhoomika nahin nibhaate he
 In the i-you case, infinity and universality become real
 buber ne bal diya ki ek ish-du sambandh main kisi bhi rachana kaa abhaav he or yah kisi vishay-vastu kaa sanchaar nahin karata 
 is tathy ke baavjood ki ish-du ko ghatana ke rup main siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa, buber ne jor dekar kaha ki yah asli he or dekha ja saktaa he
 Various examples have been used to illustrate ish-doo relationships in daily life - two lovers, a cat and a spectator, a writer and a tree and two strangers on a train
 Common English words used to illustrate ish-doo relationships include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutualism and exchange
 ek pramukh ish-du sambandh jisaki pahchaan buber ne kii thi vah tha bhagwaan or manushya ke bich maujuud rishta
 buber kaa tark he ki yahi ek tarika he jiske dwaara bhagwaan ke saath baatcheet kii ja sakati he or ek ish-du sambandh main anant ke saath kisi tarah jodta he
 To make this i-tum relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not to actively pursue it
 aise rishte kaa anugaman karne se jo gun viksit hote hai ve is-may se sambandhit he or isliye ek main tumhen-sambandh ko roka ja sake
 buber kaa daawa he ki main-tum ke liye taiyaar rahete hue, bhagwaan antat hamaare swaagat ke jawaab main hamaare paas aata he
 Furthermore, Buber describes that since God is completely devoid of qualities, this i-tum relationship lasts as long as the person desires
 jab vyakti ant main main-yah ke liye waapas lautataa he, ve gahare sambandh or samudaay ke ek stambh ke rup main kaam karte hai
 The ish-s relation is almost the opposite of ish-do
 jahaan ish-du main do praaniyon kaa saamana hota he, ish-es main praani vastav main milte nahin he
 Instead, the "I" encounters and characterizes an idea, or constructs a concept in its presence and takes that creature as an object
 aise sabhi vastuon ko mahaj maansik abhyavedan mana jaataa he, jo vyaktigat man se nirmit hoti he chalati he
 This idea is partly based on Kant's Phenomena theory and according to this these objects are present in the cognitive mind of the person
 isliye, ish-es rishta apane aap main he rishte ke saath ek tathy he, yah baatcheet ek he nahin he, lekin ek ekalaap he
 Other things such as a person's behavior etc
 can be used and experienced in the ish-s relationship
 aavashyak rup se, kisi vastu vyakti ke hit kii seva kar sakate hai - multah, nishpakshta ke liye is prapatr swayan ke maamle main duniya se sambandhit he
 Buber argued that human life oscillates between ish-es and ish-do and that in fact the experience of ish-do is quite low and medium
 aadhuniktaa kii vibhinn kathith buraaiyon kii jaanch main, buber kaa maananaa tha ki astitv ko dekhne kaa vistaar ek saamagree vishleshnatmak or shuddh rup se ish-es sambandhon par aadhaarit he
 Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existence, but the meaning of all existence
 ish und du kaa mul german se kai anya bhashaaon main anuwaad kiya gaya he
 However, because Buber's German usage was highly idiomatic and often unconventional, it is a matter of natural dispute as to how to interpret the complex message of his writing accurately
 An important debate in the English-speaking world has been centered around the correct translation of ish-es and ish-do
 german main "du" shabd kaa prayog hua he, jabaki angreji main do alag-alag anuwaad kaa upyog kiya jaataa he: "daau" or "yu " 
 mukhya samasya yah he ki bahut vyaktigat, yahaan tak ki antarang german "du" ko kaise anuwaad kiya jaye, jiskaa aadhunik angreji main koi pratyaksh samakaksh nahin he
 Smith argued that "dau" had religious and respectful implications that Buber wanted to say
 Kaufman states that the term is impersonal and archaic, it is used in intimate conversation
 is bahes ke baavjood, buber kii kitaab angreji-bhashi duniya main ai and daau ke rup main vyapak rup se gyaat he, shaayad isliye kyonki smith kaa anuwaad counmaan se kai saal pehle aayaa tha
 However, both Smith and Kauffmann's translations are widely available
 buber hasidic vidya ke ek vidwaan, dubhashiya or anuvadak the
 He saw Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, often taking examples from the Hasidic tradition that community, citing mutual life, emphasized and gave meaning to common activities
 buber ke anusaar hasidic adarsh aise jivan par bal detaa he jise bhagwaan kii bina shart upasthiti main bitaayaa jaataa he, jahaan dainik aadaton or dharmik anubhav ke bich koi spasht vibhaajan nahin rahata he
 This has had a special effect on Buber's anthropological philosophy, which considers dialogue on the basis of human existence
 1906 main, buber ne breslove ke nakhman kii kahaniyon kaa ek sangrah di geshishton des rabbi nakhman prakashit kiya, jo prasiddh hasidic rebbe tha, jise buber dwaara nav-hasidic style main varnit kiya gaya
 Two years later, Buber published De Legende des Balsheim, he was the founder of Hasidism
 hasidic parampara kii buber kii vyakhya kii, haalanki, uske romani andaaz ke liye chaim potak jaise vidwaanon dwaara aalochana kii gai he
 In Buber's introduction to the Tales of Hasidism, Potek commented that Buber had "publicized superstitions and petty excesses, its Jadic worship, its filth and Lurianic cabal, of Hasidism's" dogma, progress, mutual quarrels, the heavy cargoes of its Lurian slavery
 Ignored
 " Even more serious criticism is that Buber did not emphasize the importance of Jewish law in Hasidism
 This is ironic, keeping in mind that often Buber tried to show in Hasidism that the righteousness of a person does not require a stereotypical or cultic religion
 1920 ke dashak ke shuru main hi martin buber ne pehle se hi dwi-rashtriya yahudee-arab rajya kii vakaalat shuru kar di thi, yah kehete hue ki yahudee logon ko "arab ke saath bhaichaare or shanti se jeene kii apni ichha ko mukhar karnaa chahie or ek aam ganatantr desh main ke vikaas main jisamen donon log mukt vikaas kii sambhaavna dekh saken vah karnaa chahie
 " Buber rejected the idea of zionism as merely a national movement and instead aspired to build an exemplary society, a society which, he said, would not be marked by Jewish repression of the Arabs
 It was necessary for Zionism to reach an agreement with the Arabs even if the Jews remain in the country as a minority
 1925 main ve sanghathan brit shelam ke nirmaan main shaamil the, jo dwi-raashtra ke nirmaan kii baat karata he or apane shesh jivan main unhone aashaa vyakt kii or vishwaas kiya ki ek din yahudee or arab ek sanyukt raashtra main shanti se rahenge

 After the state of Israel gained independence in 1948, Buber advocated Israel's involvement in some of the broader "near East" states from Palestine
