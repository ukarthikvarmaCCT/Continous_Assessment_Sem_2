 According to him, "cow's milk also cannot be mother's milk
 " Gandhiji considered it necessary for the unity of the country that the dominance of the English should end soon

 The truth is that the work of partitioning India is due to English educated people

 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas

 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls

 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect

 The Oracle realizes that it is a discarded program and tells Neo to go to the source of the Matrix with the help of Chabiwale, a prisoner of Merowinjian
 chabiwala vah chaabiyaan banaata he jo chhipe hue darvaaze khol sakati he
 Smit arrives after the oracle leaves and tells Neo that after losing to him he knew he had to return to the source where he would be wiped out but he did not do so and now a wizard program has been created
 vah apane clon banane kii kaabiliyat dikhataa he jisase vah metrics ke anya logon ko apane pratirupon main badal saktaa he jiname anya easant bhi shaamil he
 He tries to change Neo as well but fails, leading to a fight between Neo and Smit's models

 Neo, Morpheus and Trinity come to the Merowinjian to ask for Chibiwale, but he refuses
 uski patni percyphone apane pati se tang aa kar use dhokaa de detii he or teenon ko chabiwale ke paas le aati he par ek merovingian ko bhaag kar apane pati ko khabar karne ke liye zindaa chod detii he
 The Merowinjian soon arrives while Morpheus Trinity and Chabiwala escape and Nio fights the inelastic men of the Merowinjian

 Chibiwala opens the source door through which Neo and Morpheus escape Smit, but Chibiwala is killed

 In a conversation, the architect explains to Neo that Neo is part of the design of the metrics, and before that several versions of the metrics and the Chosen have arrived
 agar nio metrics ke sorce main milakar use riboot nahin karegaa to vah krash ho jayega or usase jude sabhi log maare jaaenge

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India descended from the Shakya dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India
 chakravarti samraat ashok ke rajya main maury vansh kaa behad vistaar hua
 It was due to Emperor Ashoka that the Maurya Empire became the most famous and powerful worldwide
 325 isapurv main uttar pashchimi bharat sikandar ke kshatrapon kaa shashan tha
 When Alexander was invading Punjab, a Brahmin named Chanakya came to encourage Magadha for empire expansion
 us samay magadh acha khaasaa shaktishaalee tha tathaa uske padosi rajyon kii ankhon kaa kaanta
 But the then Emperor Ghananand of Magadha turned him down
 usne kaha ki tum ek pandit ho or apni chotii kaa hi dhyaan rakho "yuddh karnaa raja kaa kaam he tum pandit ho sirf panditai karo" tabhi se chanakya ne pratigya liya kii dhananand ko sabak sikhaa ke rahegaa| The Mauryas have been part of the ancient Kshatriya clan
 brahman sahitya,vishakhdutt krit mudrarakshas va justin ityadi unani sroton ke anusaar maury the maury ke utpatti ke vishay par itihaaskaaro ke ek mat nahi he kuch vidwaanon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki chandragupta maury kii utpatti unki mata mura se mili he mura shabd kaa sansodhit shabd maury he, ve aise kabeeley the jo moron kaa paalan karte the
 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"
 yah tippanee thodi atishyokti kahi ja sakati he kyonki itnaa gyaat he ki kaveri nadi or uske dakshin ke kshetron main us samay cholon, pandyon, satyaputron tathaa keralaputron kaa shashan tha
 Ashoka's inscriptions have been found in Chittaladurg, Yeragudi and Maski in Karnataka
 uske shilalikhit dharmopadesh pratham tathaa trayodash main unke padosi chol, pandya tathaa anya rajyon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main usne jain dharm apana liya tha or singhaasana tyagkar karnataka ke shravanbelagola main apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath sanyasi jivan vyateet karne laga tha
 After Chandragupta his son Bindusara was ruling but not much is known about him
 dakshin kii ore samrajya vistaar kaa shrey yada kada bindusaar ko diya jaataa he hanlanki uske vijay abhiyaan kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 According to the Jain tradition, his mother's name was Durdhar and Bindusara ruled in the Puranas for 25 years
 use amitraghaat kii oopaadhi bhi di jaati he jise unani granthon main amitrochatus kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Bindusar Azivak believed in Dharam
 usne ek unani shaasha en tiocus pratham se sukhi anjir, mithi sharaab va ek darshanik kii maang kii thi
 Emperor Ashoka is one of the greatest rulers not only of India but of the history of the world
 samrajya ke vistaar ke atirikt prashasan tathaa dharmik sahishnutaa ke kshetra main un kaa naam abbar jaise mahaan shaskaon ke saath liya jaataa he
 Although he has been a very powerful and great emperor than Akbar
 kai vidwaan to samraat ashok ko vishwa itihaas ke sabase safal shaasha bhi maanate hai
 During the days of his prince, he suppressed the rebellions of Ujjain and Taxila
 par kaling kii ladaai unke jivan main ek nirnaayak mode sabit hui or unka man yuddh main hue narsanhaar se glani se bhar gaya
 He embraced Buddhism and did many things to propagate it
 samraat ashok ko buddha dharm me upagupt ne dikshit kiya tha
 He held the title of Devanapriya, Priyadarshi
 samraat ashok ke shilaalekh tathaa shilotkeern upadesh bhartiya upmahadweep main jagah-jagah paae gaye hai
 He also sent his preachers abroad to preach Dhamma
 jin-jin deshon main prachaarak bheje gaye unamem syria tathaa pashchim asia kaa anteocus theos, misr kaa tolemi philadelus, macedoniya kaa antigons gonathas, sairin kaa megas tathaa epiras kaa alacgander shaamil the
 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part
 isi prakaar uttari tathaa pashchimi bhaag kii rajdhani kramshah takshashila tathaa ujjain thi
 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities
 rajya ke praantapalon kumaar hote the jo sthaneey praanton ke shaasha the
 There was a Council of Ministers and Mahamatyas in every province to help Kumar
 praant aage jilon main bante hote the
 Each district was divided into village groups
 pradeshik jila prashasan kaa pradhan hota tha
 The rope was used to measure the ground
 prashasan kii sabase choti ikai gaanv thi jiskaa pradhan graamic kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production
 iskaa kaam vetan nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa milawat rokna bhi tha
 The second committee looked into the affairs of people coming from outside in Pataliputra, especially foreigners
 teesri samiti kaa taalluk janm tathaa mrityu ke panjikaran se tha
 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark
 kautilya ne nagar prashasan main kai vibhaagon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo nagar ke kai kaaryakalapon ko niyamit karte the, jaise - lekha vibhaag, rajasav vibhaag, khan tathaa khanij vibhaag, rath vibhaag, seemaa shulk or kar vibhaag
 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire
 kisaanon ko sthaneey rup se koi kar nahin dena padataa tha, hanlanki iske badale unhen kadai se par vaazib maatra main kar kendriya adhikariyon ko dena padataa tha
 The currency of that time was gage
 arthshaastra main in panon ke vetanmanon kaa bhi ullikh miltaa he
 The minimum salary was 60 panas while the maximum salary was 48,000 panas
 chhathi sadi isa purv takabharat main dharmik sampradaayon kaa prachlan tha
 All these religions were associated with Vedic practice in one way or the other
 chhathi sadi isapurv main koi 62 sampradaayon ke astitv kaa pataa chalaa he jisamen buddha tathaa jain sampradaay kaa udai kaalaantar main anya kii apeksha adhik hua
 By the time of the Mauryas, Buddhist and Jain communities had developed
 udhar dakshin main shaiva tathaa vaishnav sampradaay bhi viksit ho rahe the
 Chandragupta Maurya had renounced his throne and converted to Jainism
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chandragupta ne apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath karnataka ke shravanbelagola main sanyasi ke rup main rahane laga tha
 In later inscriptions, it is found that Chandragupta died at the same place by fasting fast as a true devoted Jain
 vahaan paas main hi chandragiri naam kii pahari he jiskaa namaakaran shaayad chandragupta ke naam par hi kiya gaya tha
 Ashoka adopted Buddhism after the Kalinga war
 iske baad usne dhamm ke prachaar main apana dhyaan lagaaya
 Here Dhamma meant "moral principles", not religion or religion or religion
 us samay na to islam kaa janm hua tha or na hi isiyat kaa
 Therefore, those moral principles were not to oppose any religion outside, but to provide a moral law to man
 apane duusare shilaalekh main usne likhaa he - " dhamm kya he? alp dushkarm tathaa adhik satkarm
 Avoiding evils like fury, cruelty, anger, pride and jealousy, and observance of virtues such as mercy, generosity, truth, self-control, simplicity, attachment to morality, purity of heart, and internal and external purity
 " After adopting Buddhism, he also tried to bring it into life
 usne shikaar karnaa or pashuon kii hatya chhod diya tathaa manushyon tathaa jaanwaron ke liye chikitsaalayon kii sthapana karai
 He generously donated to Brahmins and ascetics of various religious creeds
 iske alaava usne aaramgrih, evam dharmashala, kuen tathaa baavariyon kaa bhi nirmaan kaary karaayaa
 He appointed officers of the rank of Dharmamahatra whose work was to propagate Dhamma to the general public
 usne videshon main bhi apane prachaarak dal bheje
 Apart from neighboring countries, he also sent missionaries to Egypt, Syria, Macedonia Cyrene and Epirus
 halanki ashok ne khud buddha dharm apana liya tha par usne anya sampradaayon ke prati bhi aadar kaa bhav rakhaa tathaa unke viruddh kisi kaarywahi kii ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Shan Vistrath was in the Mauryan period sainya vyavastha chah samitiyon main vibhakt sainya vibhaag dwaara nirdisht thi
 Each committee consisted of five military experts

 The highest officer of military management was called Antapal
 yah seemaant kshetron kaa bhi vyavasthaapak hota tha
 According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya's army was invincible soldiers equipped with six lakh footmen, fifty thousand horsemen, nine thousand elephants and eight hundred chariots
 chandragupta maury ne shashan sanchaalan ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye chaar praanton main vibhajit kar diya tha jinhen chakra kaha jaataa tha
 The rule of these provinces was governed by the representative of the emperor
 samraat ashok ke kaal main praanton kii sankhya paanch ho gai thi
 These provinces were- praachi - patliputra Uttarapath - Taxila dakshinapath - suvarnagiri Avanti Nation - Ujjayini kaling - tosli The provinces were administered by officials named Dynastic Kumar

 At the apex, the central division of the empire was subsequently divided into provincial diets

 The diet was subject to the subject

 In order to maintain discipline in the city and to control the crimes, there was a police system called Rakshata
 unani sroton se gyaat hota he ki nagar prashasan main teen prakaar ke adhikari hote the- agronoyoi, antinomoi, sainya adhikaar
 After the death of the Mauryan emperor, the mighty Maurya Empire, which had been going on for almost two centuries, began to disintegrate

 This ended the Mauryan Empire

 There are countless applications of these sensors about which most people are not yet aware
 in anuprayogon main gaadiyaan, mashin, antariksh praudyogiki, dawa, vinirmaan or robotics shaamil hai
 The sensitivity of a sensor indicates how often the sensor's output changes when the measured amount changes
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi taapmaana main 1 °C ke parivartan ke falswaroop tharmametre kaa paara 1 cm dravit hota he, to isaki samvedansheeltaa 1 cm / °C hoti he

 For example, if a sensor does a temperature measurement and has a voltage output, then sensitivity is a constant whose unit is; This sensor is linear because the ratio is constant at all measurement points

 This epic is a mixture of art and science, being a mixture of two great traditions of Sanskrit literature - Ramayana and Paninian grammar
 at: ise sahitya main ek nayaa or sahaspurn prayog mana jaataa he
 While expressing pride of his own work, Bhatti has said that this composition is not for the readers inferior to the knowledge of grammar

 It is designed to entertain the meritorious scholar, and to make the Subodh student aware of the rigorous rules of grammar in practical method

 In Madhyaviyathatuvrati, there is a mention of the commentary on Bhattikavya by Adi Shankara

 There are four episodes in the epic

 The main purpose of the composition is to present the characteristics of grammar and literature by the target

 a scandal in the middle is characterized by certain organs of poetry

 The second scandal is the 'rights scandal', in which word usage is in accordance with the rules displayed in certain specific rights of Paninian grammar
 tritiy cond saahitiyik visheshtaon ko abhilakshith karne kii drushti se rachaa gaya he atev is cond ko mahakavi ne 'prasancand' kii sangya di he
 There are four tribunals in this scandal: The first tribunal has the goals of linguistic and semantic

 This part is a personal feature of Bhattikavya, presenting an example of language language
 antim cond pun: sanskrit vyakaran ke ek jatil swaroop tisaint ke vividh shabdarup ko pradarshit karata he
 This scandal is the biggest

 The second episode covers the next four sergoes, describing the coronation of Sugriva's coronation, the discovery of Sita by the monkey Bhatas, the dissolution of the Ashokavatika on his return, and the capture of Maruti and present in the assembly

 According to the prophet himself, Bhattikavya was composed in Balabhi Nagar under the Gurjar country
 bhatti kavi kaa naam "bhartri" shabd kaa apbhransh rup he
 Certain reviewers consider the poet's full name as Bhartrihari, but this Bhartrihari is certainly different from Bhatruhari, the creator of the Shatatraya or the principal of the syntactic
 bhatti upnaam bhartruhari kavi valbhinaresh shridhar sen se sambandhit he
 The time of Mahakavi Bhatti is unanimous in the late sixth century AD
 alankaar varg main nidarshit udaahranon se spasht prathit hota he ki bhatti or bhamah ek hi parampara ke anuyaayi hai
 For nearly 10 centuries before Bhattikavya's composition, Panini's Ashtadhyayi's deep reading was going on
 bhatti kaa uddeshy ashtaadhi ke adhyayan ko aasaan banane vaala saadhan nirmit karnaa tha
 He did this by associating the examples given in the grammar texts already existing with the Ramakatha
 isse seekhney main saralata or sarasata aa gai
 The influence of Bhattikavya can be seen even in remote Java
 vahaan kaa pracheen java bhashaa kaa ramayana bhattikavy par hi aadhaarit he
 This Ramayana is currently the oldest surviving text of the Java language
 yah ramayana bhattikavy ko 12wein sarg tak purnatah anusaran karata he
 Sometimes the entire poem has been translated
