 The zygote or crustacea is a major division of arthropod fauna in the fauna, which consists of large crabs, prawns, chingats, pruning, mahachingt, khandavar, wood yucca and water animal, etc
, but to look for its smallest organisms, we have to resort to the microscope
 
 kathini kii bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke aakar prakaar main bahut hi antar hota he jis kaaran isaki sankshipt paribhaasha dena atyant kathin he
 Every symptom of difficulty, especially in its parasites and highly specialized creatures, changes completely in one way or the other
 crusteshia shabd kaa upyog prarambh main un jeevon ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jinka kavach kathor tathaa namya ho
 In contrast, other creatures are those whose armor is brittle, such as oysters and snails etc
 parantu ab yah gyaat he ki sab sandhipad jeevon kaa bahi:kankal kathor tathaa namya hota he
 For this reason, difficulty is now isolated from other symptoms
 is varg ke jeev praaia: jalanivaasee hote hai or sansar main koi bhi aisa jalashay nahin he jahaan inaki koi na koi jati na pai jaati ho
 Due to this difficult organisms often breathe through the reservoir or skin
 inamen do jodi shringika jaise avyav mukh ke saamne or teen jodi hanu mukh ke peeche hote hai
 The main familiar organisms of the difficult class are the prawns and crabs that humans use in their food form, but far less economic than these are the organisms Aphipadz, Isopidz, etc
, which act as mamers while living in groups in shallow reservoirs
 We do
 in nimna jeevon kaa bhojan duusare jeev tathaa vanaspatiyon kii tyakt vastuen hai or saath hi yah swayan ucch praaniyon, jaise matsay ityadi, kaa bhojan banate hai
 There are also many talapalvic microbes whose groups change the color of the ocean for miles, so that the fishermen get knowledge of proper fisheries
 is prakaar yah matsay kaa bhojan banakar or saath hi machhuon kii sahaayta karke aarthik laabh pahunchaate hai
 The armor of organisms of this class is divided into groups of segments in the same way as other arthropod organisms, but often some of these segments are also unified
 prayek khand kavach anguthi ke samaan hota he, jo apane agle tathaa pichley khand ke saath namya integument se judaa rahata he
 The dorsal band resembling the arc of each segment is called sternum, and both lateral parts of the tergum, which remain as the bandages, are called plura
 prayek khand ke sternam ke saath ek jodi ang jude rahete hai
 The last segment of the body, which has anus, remains limbless and is called a telson
 aadhunik kathini main koi bhi aisa jeev nahin miltaa jisamen prayek khand ek duusare se spashtatya pruthak ho
 For example, the shell of the body of the prawn body is undivided and oblong and is called carapace
 iske khandon kii sankhya kaa anumaan is bhaag ke saath jude avyavon kii sankhya se lagaaya jaataa he
 The number of combined volumes in this section is considered to be at least six, including the nightly sections
 is bhaag ko sir kehete hai
 When more than this section is included in this part, then the components of the subsequent segments are completely separate from the next elements
 sir ke peeche ke khandon ko sharir ke do bhaagon, vaksh tathaa udar main baanta gaya he, jinako unke vibhinn avyav ek duusare se pruthak karte hai
 But in the high tough malaconstraca etc
, the thoracic segments join the head
 tab is sanyukt bhaag ko shirsovaksh ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 In this way, the form of carapace is also found in many different types of difficult organisms
 yah brankiopoda or austracoda main bivalve kavach ke rup main sharir tathaa angon ko purnataya dhake rahata he, siripedia main yah maansal praavaar ke aakaar kaa hota he or ise pusht karne ke liye calsiumyukt patt bhi sthit rahete hai
 These are some of its special forms, but in the carapace of a simple rectangular form, all the sections of the thorax can be included in the head
 kairapes vibhinn kathiniyon main se praaia: sabhi main paaya jaataa he
 Only Anostraca are organisms that do not have carapace
 kathini ke sharir kii samparivartit charam seemaa iske parashrayi tathaa sthagit jeevon main pai jaati he
 Khandavars remain in their old age with their heads and also have a tendency towards radial symmetry due to their postponed life
 parashrayi jeevon main sharirkhand lupt ho gaye hai or sharir kaa aakaar bhi purna rup se parivartit ho gaya he
 An example of this is rhizocephala, in which the symptoms of difficulty, even the symptoms of arthropods, do not appear in old age
 kathini jeev mukhyat: jalanivaasee hai
 For this reason it is estimated that the body of the ancestor of this class was divided into equal segments and each pair had a pair of limbs attached to it
 inkaa prayek avyav prachlan, bhojanprapti, shwasan tathaa gyanagrahan aadi sab kaary saath-saath karata tha
 a similar system of ingredients has been considered in Trilobita, but this subclass has disappeared
 abhi tak adhunik kathini main kisi bhi aise jeev kaa pataa nahin chalaa jiske avyavon main ye chaaron kaary saath hote hon
 Its head parts are suitable for different special functions, but the components of the torso of Branchiopoda are similar and to some extent can be assumed to have all four functions
 anyathaa angon kii visheshta kathini main kai upayon se unnati kar gai he, kyonki yah vidit he ki jo ang kuch kathiniyon main ek kaary karte hai ve hi kisi duusari kathini main uske vipareet koi anya kaary karte hai
 The development within the difficulty is mainly based on the duty control of these organs
 chaahe kathini ke avyav kisi bhi kaary ke liye upyojit hon or unke aakaar main chaahe kitni vibhinnata kyon na ho, inaki banaavat mukhyat: dwishakhi hoti he
 The base circle of each component is diagonal and is called a sympod or protopodite and two branches endopodite and exopotide arise from its upper segment
 is prakaar ke mul aadhaarit avyav ko steenopodium kehete hai
 Such simple bifacial components are the copulatory posture of the copipod, the abdominal organs of Malacostraca, and similar organs are also found in the progenitor ovum, called noplius
 isi prakaar ke avyav duusare kathini jeevon main vishesh kaaryon ke liye vibhinn rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There are two types of eyes of difficulty, medium and combined eye
 ati saral madhyam netra nopleius or anek vayask kathiniyon main rahete hai, parantu mailocostraca main ye lupt ho jate hai or inamen sanyukt netra hi kaaryshil netra hote hai
 Combined eyes are often a pair, which are the descendants of some organisms and many are in one
 netravrunt ko sir kaa avyav mana gaya he, parantu yah sandehatmak he
 Because, in growth it emerges much later in other organs
 pratham shringikas, jo mukh ke saamne rahati he, duusare khand ke avyav maani gai hai

 yadhyapi dwitiya shringika mukh ke aage sthit rahati he, tathaapi vastav main iskaa sthaan mukh ke peeche tha
 In Noplias, its place is on the side of the mouth and it helps in bringing the food towards the mouth
 iske shesh kaary pratham shringika ke samaan hote hai
 In Melacostraca, one of its branches is multi-faceted in shape and its function is only sensing, but the other branch is similar in shape to a flat plate and it also serves as a flattening of the float
 nopleius tathaa vayaska kopipoda, isopoda ityadi main adhohanu bhi dwishakhi hote hai or bhojanprapti main sahaayta karte hai, parantu bahuterey kathiniyon main adhohanu shaktimaan hanu kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai or inaki sataha daant or condon se susajjit hoti he
 The parasites resemble the drastic shund for the piercing of the tough

 These three are the last Hanu of the mouth
 sir ke pechhevaale angon main brankiopoda, kopipoda ityadi main aapas main koi vishesh bhinnata nahin hoti or ye ang mukhyat: ek samaan hote hai
 Their shape is similar to that of Melakostraka's Upambhaka and Upajambha
 is prakaar ke avyavon ko fillopodia kehete hai
 But the parts of the torso of Melacostraca are divided into two parts - eight pairs of thoracic components and six pairs of abdominal organs
 ye ek duusare se purnataya bhinn hote hai
 The thoracic components are mainly used to speed up and for this reason their endopodides, which take a major part in this work, are transformed in the same way, but their exopodides, which are useful in flotation, have disappeared
 
 vaksh ke purv ek athwa do jodi avyav praaia: padahanu aakaar ke hote hai jis kaaran inhen anupaad naam diya gaya he
 The abdominal organs are always useful in biceps and flotation
 antim udarang ke sahyog se punch minapaksh kaa aakaar dhaaran karke jeev ko vishesh prakaar se ulatney main sahaayta detii he
 Most of the following hardy breathe through the ground, but the organisms whose outer skeleton has become more rigid do respiratory work in their bodies where the floor has been eroded, such as the lining of the carapace; Or this work is done by special senses, which are called Jalasvanika
 jalashvasanika vaksh yaa uske angon par sthit shakhikaaye hai jinka aakaar chapata hota he or jinaki sookshm bheeton ke bheetar rudhir pravaahit hota rahata he
 In Decapoda, the aqueducts are classified into three categories depending on their position - branching branches, branching branches adjacent to the breastbone, and the branchial mandibular interior that are covered with carapace
 thalanivaasee kathini, jaise kekade ityadi, vayushwasan ke liye anukulit hote hai-inke brakiyal mandal ke astr kaa tal fefdon kaa kaary karata he
 In other organisms, such as isopoda, wood, etc
, there are branchial air-filled ducts found in the colon, similar to the trachea of insects and other vertebrates
 kathiniyon main aaharanlee pratiprishth mukh se lekar ant tak purna sharir main sadaiv sidhi rahati he
 But there are some such creatures in this class in which it is also found neutered or coiled

 The foreskin and posterior intestines, whose holes are the mouth and anus, and whose inner floor is covered with chitin, which is attached to the outer body of chitin
 teesraa bhaag madhyantra he, jo in donon ke madhya main rahata he
 The muscles of the foreskin are strong and hair, thorns and teeth etc
 develop on their inner floor
 melacostraca main yah bhaag amashay banaata he, jisamen jathar, peshni tathaa chaanan upkaran khaadya rason ko kanon se alag karne ke liye vishesh saadhan rahete hai
 But ghee and filter are usually separate in cardiac and neural organs
 madhyantra ke agle sire par ek jodi yaa adhik yakrut unduk rahete hai jinka kaary avasorana tathaa srav hai or jinamein se shakha nikalakar yakrut bhi bana sakati he
 In the Decapoda, the liver gland makes all the necessary enzymes and also exploits substances deprived of its cavity
 isi main bhojan glikojan ke rup main sanchit hota he
 In some Decapoda, the mesentery is very small, due to which the alimentary canal is known only of the anterior and posterior bowel
 parashrayi kathini jeevon main aaharanlee yaa to nammaatr kii hoti he athwa uskaa bilkul abhaav hota he
 Like other arthropod organisms, blood flows to the body cavities and destinations even in difficulties
 hriday bhi anya sandhipadon kii bhanti aaharanlee ke prishthi hridayaavaran ke bheetar sthit rahata he
 In Branchiopoda, Astracada, and some Melacostraca, the heart is often equal to the entire length of the body, and in addition to the end section of the body, it has a pair of capillary blinds in each section, which goes through the cardiovascular system
 anya kathiniyon main hriday kii lambaai praaia: kam hoti he
 The arteries exit the heart and open in the bloodstream, from where the blood enters the heart through every part and part of the body
 rudhir ko oxygenyukt karne ke liye jalashvasanika isi bhaag main sthit rahati he
 There are also many difficulties in which there is no heart, such as Siripedia, Kopipoda, etc
 and in them blood is transported with the help of operation of the body and the abdomen
 kathiniyon kaa rudhir halakaa taral padaarth hota he jisamen leukosite mila rahata he or antomestroca main haemoglobin bhi upasthit rahata he
 The main excretory senses of difficulty are two pair of glandular and venous glands that open at the postures of the organs of the same name
 donon grathiyon kaa purna vikaas kabhi bhi kisi jati kii ek avasthaa main ek saath nahin miltaa, atev jivan ke itihaas main bhinn-bhinn avasthaaon main ek ke pashchaat duusari granthi kaaryshil hoti he
 For example, in the adult stage of prawns and other decapitals, the adenoid gland is functional and the uppermost gland in its ovum
 parantu adhiktar kathiniyon main iske vipareet dasha hoti he
 In this, the composition of these two glands is the same
 prayek granthi main teen mukhya bhaag hote hai : 1
 antasyun, jo dehguha kaa avshesh tathaa ksheen bhitawala bhitari bhaag he, 2
 utsargi nalika tathaa 3
 parivartit bahirgaman pranali, jo antasyun se judi rahati he or jiskaa ek bhaag granthman bhitawali utsargi nalika he
 Both the ventral and excretory system of the excretory tube grow larger and form the concentric bladder

 kathini main tantrika tantra kii avasthaa main sandhipadon kii adarsh dasha se lekar atyant sankredic dasha tak kii purna shrenee milti he
 In the primitive Branchiopoda, the series of anterolateral flakes is staircase-like in some of the anilids and in which the two parts of the chain are separated from each other
 anya kathini samoohon main praaia: shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaagon kaa aapas main sanrohan ho jaataa he, saath hi, gucchhikaaye bhi ek duusare ke sameep aakar sayujjit ho jaati hai
 In the last state of this category, which is found in crabs, only a group of bunch appears

 ye saadhaaran athwa shakhayukta bhi ho sakati hai or inase nalikaay utpann hokar sharir ke praaia: madhya se baahar kii ore khulti hai
 In the cirrpedia and some of the cladosira males, these holes remain at the boundary of the body, but in their female the holes are located on the first section of the thorax, and in Melacostraca also the holes remain in this place in both sexes
 kathini ke andjnan se jo dimbh bahulsankhya main uplabdh hote hai ve vayask se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 Before taking the adult stage, the organism has to cross a range of different ovules in which the first ovum is called noplus larva
 prayek kathini is avasthaa ko avashya paar karata he chaahe vah svachhand plavit avasthaa main utpann ho athwa bhrunit main
 In the typical state, the ovum is an unbroken oval, which contains three pairs of components and becomes the adult's antunculus, antennae, and mediobles

 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method

 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 kadachit isliye videshi sarkaar kii daman-niti kaa unhen shikaar hona padaa tha, uske nrushans vyavhaar kii yatnaa jhelni padi thi
 In the nineteenth century, the prose of Hindi prose-making and the Hindi-propaganda movement, despite facing severe hardships under the most adverse conditions, the evidence of how fast and athletic it is is evident on the dilapidated pages of 'bharatamitra' 'saar Sudhanidhi' and 'proper speaker' 
 vartmaan main hindi patrakarita main angreji patrakarita ke dabadabe ko khatm kar diya he
 Earlier, English journalism dominated the country and abroad, but today the flag of Hindi language is waving
 30 may ko 'hindi patrakarita diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Modern-day journalism was born in India in the fourth phase of the eighteenth century in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
 1780 i
 main prakashit hike kaa "kalakatta gazat" kadachit is ore pehla praytn tha
 anglo-indian English journalism of these cities had developed greatly by the time the first Hindi letter Udant Martand was published
 in antim varshon main farsi bhashaa main bhi patrakarita kaa janm ho chukaa tha
 Persian letters of the 18th century were probably handwritten letters
 1801 main 'hindostaan intelligence oriental anthology' naam kaa jo sankalan prakashit hua usamen uttar bharat ke kitne hi "akhabaaron" ke uddhran the
 In 1810 Maulvi Ikram Ali started publishing the Leitho letter "hindostani" from Calcutta
 1816 main gangakishor bhattacharya ne "bengal gajet" kaa pravartan kiya
 This was the first Bengali letter
 baad main shrirampur ke padariyon ne prasiddh prachaarpatr "samachar darpan" ko janm diya
 After these initial letters, in 1823, we get to see 'newschandraika' and "samvad Kaumudi" in Bengali language, "jame Jahanuma" and "shamsul Akhbar" in Persian Urdu and "mumbai Samachar" in Gujarati
 yah spasht he ki hindi patrakarita bahut baad kii cheez nahin he
 Delhi's "urdu Newspaper" and Marathi's "digdarshan" came only after Hindi's first letter "udant Martand"
 "udant martand" ke sampadak pandit jugalkishor the
 It was a weekly paper
 patr kii bhashaa pachhanhi hindi rahati thi, jise patr ke sampadakon ne "madhyadeshiy bhashaa" kaha he
 The letter closed in 1827
 un dinon sarkari sahaayta ke bina kisi bhi patr kaa chalanaa asambhav tha
 The company government had given the facility of postage etc
 to the missionaries' letter, but even after trying, "udant Martand" could not get this facility
 1826 i
 se 1873 i
 tak ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa pehla charan kah sakate hai
 In 1873, Bhartendu founded the "harishchandra Magazine"
 ek varsh baad yah patr "harishchandra chandrika" naam se prasiddh hua
 By the way, Bhartendu's "kavyashakha Sudha" paper came out in 1867 itself and he took an important part in the development of journalism; But the new language style was introduced in 1873 only from "harishchandra Magazine"
 is bich ke adhikansh patr prayog maatr kahe ja sakate hai or unke peeche patrakala kaa gyaan athwa nae vichaaron ke prachaar kii bhaavana nahin he
 The major letters after "udant Martand" are: in patron main se kuch masik the, kuch saptahik
 The daily paper had only one "news Corruption" which was bilingual and published from Calcutta
 yah dainik patr 1871 tak chalata rahaa
 Most of the letters were published from Agra which was a big educational center in those days and the students met the needs of the society
 shesh brahmsamaj, sanathan dharm or mishnariyon ke prachaar kaary se sambandhit the
 Many of the letters were bilingual and some were even bilingual
 isse bhi patrakarita kii aparipakv dasha hi suchit hoti he
 The "banaras Newspaper" was very influential in the early letters of Hindi Pradesh and in protest against its linguistic language, Taramohan Maitra started publishing the weekly "sudhakar" from Kashi in 1850 and Raja Lakshman Singh from Agra in 1855 from Prajitha
 raja shivaprasad kaa "banaras akhbaar" urdu bhashastyli ko apanaataa tha to ye donon patr panditau tatsampradhan style kii ore jhukate the
 Thus we see that before 1867 Hindi journalists could not follow a certain style in relation to the language style
 is varsh 'kavi vachansudha' kaa prakaashan hua or ek tarah se ham use pehla mahatvapurn patr kah sakate hai
 At first it was monthly, then fortnightly and finally weekly
 bharatendu ke bahuvidh vyaktitv kaa prakaashan is patr ke madhyam se hua, parantu sach to yah he ki "harishchandra magazine" ke prakaashan tak ve bhi bhashastyli or vichaaron ke kshetra main maarg hi khojate dikhaai dete hai
 The second era of Hindi journalism runs from 1873 to 1900
 is yug ke ek chor par bharatendu kaa "harishchandra magazine" tha ore nagariprachaarini sabha dwaara anumodanprapt "saraswati"
 The number of papers published in these 27 years is above 300-350 and extends to Nagpur
 adhikansh patr masik yaa saptahik the
 The monthly papers used to have some more permanent assets in the form of essays, Naval Katha, talks etc
, but most of the papers did not go more than 10-15 pages and we can call them "thought sheets" in today's words
 saptahik patron main samaacharon or unpar tippaniyon kaa bhi mahatvapurn sthaan tha
 In fact, there was no special request for the daily news at that time and perhaps that's why the weekly and monthly papers were more important in those days
 unhone janajagran main atyant mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha
 The ideal of these 25 years of the nineteenth century was Bharatendu's journalism
 "kavivachansudha", "harishchandra magazine", shri harishchandra chandrika", balbodhini ke rup main bharatendu ne is disha main pathpradarshan kiya tha
 Frustrated by his commentaries, and angry at the "punch" of "kavikhaवचनasudha", the magistrate of Kashi also stopped taking Bharatendu's letters to the education department
 isamen andeh nahin ki patrakarita ke kshetra bhi bharatendu purnataya nirbhik the or unhone nae nae patron ke liye protsaahan diya
 He also named many letters like "hindi Pradeep", "bharat Jeevan"
 unke yug ke sabhi patrkaar unhen agrani maanate the
 Prominent among the journalists who came to this field after Bharatendu were Pandit Rudradutt Sharma, Balakrishna Bhatt, Durgaprasad Mishra, Pandit Sadanand Mishra, Pandit Vanshidhar, Badrinarayan Chaudhary "prem Dhan", Devkinandan Tripathi, Radhacharan Goswami, Pandit Gauridapan, Raja Raman Singh, Prata
 Mishra, Ambikadatta Vyas, Babu Ramakrishna Verma, Pt
 Ramgoolam Awasthi, Yogeshchandra Vasu, Pt
 Kundanlal and Babu Devakinandan Woman and Babu Jagnnathdas
 1895 i
 main "nagariprachaarini patrika" kaa prakaashan aarambh hota he
 Critical literary review started from this magazine and hence we can consider it a definite lighthouse
 1900 i
 main "saraswati" or "sudarshan" ke avataran ke saath hindi patrakarita ke is duusare yug par patakshep ho jaataa he
 In these 25 years, Hindi journalism developed in many directions
 praarambhik patr shikshaprasar or dharmprachaar tak simit the
 Bharatendu also developed social, political and literary directions
 unhone hi "balabodhini" naam se pehla stri-masik-patr chalaaya
 a few years later, women see themselves entering the region - "bharatabhini", "sugrihini"
 in varshon main dharm ke kshetra main aryasamaj or sanathan dharm ke prachaarak vishesh sakriy the
 Some letters related to Brahmasamaja and Radhaswami faith and some Christian religious letters from Christian centers like Mirzapur also appear, but we find the religious reactions of the era only in the letters of Aryasamaj and mythology
 aaj ye patr kadachit utane mahatvapurn nahin jaan padate, parantu isamen andeh nahin ki unhone hindi kii gadhyshailee ko pusht kiya or janata main nae vichaaron kii jyoti bhi
 As a result of these religious debates, various sections of the society and sect went towards reform and very soon there was a flood of communal letters
 saikadon kii sankhya main vibhinn jaateey or vargeey patr prakashit hue or unhone asankhya janon ko vaani di
 Today, the same letters are very important in our historiography, who have done some outstanding work in the field of language style, literature or politics
 saahitiyik drushti se "hindi pradeep", brahman, kshatriyapatrika, anandakadambini, bharatendu, devanagari prachaarak, vaishnav patrika, kavi ke chitrakaar, nagari nirad, sahitya sudhanidhi or raajnneetik drushti se bharatamitra, uchit vaktaa, saar sudhanidhi, bharatoday, bharat jivan, bharatoday, shubhachintak or hindi bangavasi vishesh mahatvapurn hai
 These papers have preserved the best of our 19th-century literature, rasikas, karmat worshipers of Hindi, stylists and thinkers
 yah kshobh kaa vishay he ki ham is mahatvapurn saamagree kaa patron kii filon se uddhaar nahin kar sake
 How many essays, commentaries, articles, panches, haps and sketches and sketches of living writers like Balakrishna Bhatt, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Sadanam Mishra, Rudradatta Sharma, Ambikadatta Vyas and Balamukund Gupta are getting us to the mark today
 aaj bhi hamaare patrkaar unase bahut kuch sikh sakate hai
 He was a pioneer in his time
 beesvin shatabdi kii patrakarita hamaare liye apekshaakrit nikat he or usamen bahut kuch pichley yug kii patrakarita kii hi vividhta or bahurupata milti he
 Journalists of the 19th century had to face chaos in the language-style arena
 unhen ek ore angreji or duusari ore urdu ke patron ke saamne apni vastu rakhni thi
 Right now the people interested in Hindi were very small
 dhire-dhire paristhiti badali or ham hindi patron ko sahitya or raajnneeti ke kshetra main netritv karte pate hai
 From this century onwards, the movement of religion and social reforms fell behind and the caste consciousness gradually assumed the form of national consciousness
 falat: adhikansh patr, sahitya or raajnneeti ko hi lekar chale
 The first two decades in the field of literary papers were led by "saraswati" edited by Acharya Dwivedi
 vastut: in bees varshon main hindi ke masik patr ek mahaan saahitiyik shakti ke rup main saamne aae
 a number of papers were published in the form of a novel novel Kahani - such as Novel 1901, Hindi Naavil 1901, Novel Lahari 1902, Novel Sea 1903, Novel Kusumnjali 1904, Novel Bahar 1907, Novel Promotion 19012
 keval kavita athwa samasyapurti lekar anek patr unnisvin shatbdi ke antim varshon main nikalne lage the
 They went on
 samalochna ke kshetra main "samalochak" or aitihaasik shodh se sambandhit "itihaas" kaa prakaashan bhi mahatvapurn ghatnaayen hai
 But Saraswati's ideal as "missleni" was more popular and a few letters can be named with him in the letters of this category, such as "bharatendu", Nagri Hitaishini Patrika, Bankipur, Nagrikaprakash, Mithilamihir and Indu
 "saraswati" or "indu" donon hindi kii sahityachetana ke itihaas ke liye mahatvapurn hai or ek tarah se ham unhen us yug kii saahitiyik patrakarita kaa sheershamani kah sakate hai
 Through "saraswati", Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi and "indu" through Pandit Rupnarayan Pandey, the editorial vigilance, perseverance and honesty that he set before us was able to give a new direction to Hindi journalism
 parantu raajnneetik kshetra main hindi patrakarita ko netritv praapt nahin ho sakaa
 The center of political journalism of the previous era was Calcutta
 parantu kalakatta hindi pradesh se dur padataa tha or swayan hindi pradesh ko raajnneetik disha main jaagruk netritv kuch der main mila
 The first daily Hindi Hindi state of Raja Rampal Singh's bilingual "hindustan" was published in English and Hindi from Kalakankar
 do varsh baad, babu seetaram ne "bharatoday" naam se ek dainik patr kanpur se nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 But both these papers could not be long lasting and the weekly papers had to become the vehicle of political ideology
 vastav main unnisvin shatbdi main kalakatta ke bharat mitra, vangvasi, sarasudhanidhi or uchit vaktaa hi hindi pradesh kii ranithik bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 Perhaps "bharatamitra" was the most enduring and powerful of these
 unnisvin shatabdi main bengal or maharashtra lok jagrati ke centre the or ugr rashtriya patrakarita main bhi ye hi praant agrani the
 The journalists of Hindi Pradesh accepted the leadership of these provinces and their independent political personality could not develop for a long time
 phir bhi ham "abhyuday", "pratap", "karmyogi", "hindi kesari" aadi ke rup main hindi raajnneetik patrakarita ko kai dag aage badhaate pate hai
 The excitement of the First World War once again led to several daily letters
 kalakatta se "kalakatta samachar", "swatantra" or "vishwamitra" prakashit hue, bombai se "venkateshwar samachar" ne apana dainik sanskaran prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya or dilli se "vijay" niklaa
 In 1921 "today" from Kashi and "present" from Kanpur were published
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1921 main hindi patrakarita phir ek baar karavatein leti he or raajnneetik kshetra main apana nayaa jivan aarambh karti he
 New trends in our literary papers also start from this time
 falat: beesvin shatee ke pehle bees varshon ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa teesraa charan kah sakate hai
 After 1921, the contemporary era of Hindi journalism begins
 is yug main ham rashtriya or saahitiyik chetana ko saath saath pallavit pate hai
 Around the same time, Hindi was entered into universities and some Kriti editors came to know who were fully familiar with the journalism of English and who wanted to bring Hindi papers at par with the letters of English, Marathi and Bengali
 falat: saahitiyik patrakarita main ek nae yug kaa aarambh hua
 National movements declared qualification for the national language of Hindi for the first time and as the strength of national movements started increasing, Hindi journalists and letters started gaining more importance
 1921 ke baad gandhi ji ke netritv main rashtriya andolan madhyavarg tak simit na rahakar graminon or shramikon tak pahunch gaya or uske is prasar main hindi patrakarita ne mahatvapurn yoga diya
 The truth is that Hindi journalists were at the forefront of national movements and took a firm stand against foreign authority
 videshi sarkaar ne anek baar nae nae kanoon banaakar samachaarpatron kii swatantraaa par kutharaghaat kiya parantu jail, jurmaana or anekanek maansik or aarthik kathinaaiyaan jhelte hue bhi hindi patrakaron ne swatantra vichaar kii deepashikha jalaae rakhi
 Among the letters that came to the literary field after 1921 are prominent- vastav main aaj hamaare masik sahitya kii praudhata or vividhta main kisi prakaar kaa andeh nahin ho saktaa
 Many first-class works of Hindi came to light first by menstruation and many excellent poets and litterateurs were also related to journalism
 aaj hamaare masik patr jivan or sahitya ke sabhi angon kii purti karte hai or ab visheshgyata kii ore bhi dhyaan jane laga he
 Like the evolving glimpse of literature trends, it is not found in books
 vahaan hamen sahitya kaa sakriy, sapraan, gatisheel rup praapt hota he
 In the political arena, the newspapers which were popular in this era are - inamen se adhikansh saptahik hai, parantu janaman ke nirmaan main unka yogadan mahatvapurn rahaa he
 As far as letter art is concerned, we can clearly say that there is a difference of earth and sky in the letters of the third and fourth eras
 aaj patrasampadan vastav main ucch koti kii kala he
 In the field of political journalism, "aaj" and its editor late Baburao Vishnu Paradkar occupies almost the same place as Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi in the field of literary journalism
 sach to yah he ki "aaj" ne patrakala ke kshetra main ek mahaan sanstha kaa kaam kiya he or usne hindi ko bisiyon patrasampadak or patrkaar die hai
 Like many parts of modern literature, Hindi journalism is also a new category and in that it is mainly a reflection of the social, cultural, literary and political movements of our middle class
 vastav main pichley 200 varshon kaa sachcha itihaas hamaari patrapatrikaon se hi sankalit ho saktaa he
 In the "kaler Katha" book of Bengali, an attempt has been made to assess the mid-nineteenth-century life of Bengal based on the descent of letters
 hindi main bhi aisa praytn vaanchhneeya he
 In a way, in the nineteenth century, there is very little that can be called literature and whatever it is, it has appeared first in the pages of letters
 bhashastyli ke nirmaan or jaateey style ke vikaas main patron kaa yogadan atyant mahatvapurn rahaa he, parantu beesvin shatee ke pehle do dashakon ke ant tak masik patr or saptahik patr hi hamaari saahitiyik pravritiyon ko janm dete or viksit karte rahe hai
 The experimental form that we see in the literature of Dwivedi era in "saraswati" and "indu" is the true form of that literature
 1921 i
 ke baad sahitya bahut kuch patrapatrikaon se swatantra hokar apane pairon par khadaa hone laga, parantu phir bhi vishisht saahitiyik andolanon ke liye hamen masik patron ke prishth hi ulatney padate hai
 There are magazinelets for political consciousness
 vastut: patrapatrikas jitani badi jansankhya ko chooti hai, vishuddh sahitya kaa utani badi jansankhya tak pahunchnaa asambhav he
 In the 90s, Indian language newspapers, Hindi journalism, Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran etc
 began to come out from the towns and cities
 jahaan pehle mahanagaron se akhbaar chhapate the, bhumandalikaran ke baad aayi nayi takanic, behatar sadak or yatayaat ke sansadhano kii sulabhta kii vajah se chote shaharon, kasbon se bhi nagar sanskaran kaa chapana aasaan ho gaya
 Also, in these decades, the search for new consumers for new goods started in the market spreading in rural areas and towns
 hindi ke akhbaar in vastuon ke prachaar-prasar kaa ek jariya ban kar ubhara he
 At the same time local news is prominently featured in these newspaper editions
 isse akhabaaron ke pathakon kii sankhya main kaaphi badhotaree hui he
 Media expert Sevanti Ninan called it a 'reinvention of the public world of Hindi'
 ve likhti hai, “print media ne sthaneey ghatnaon ke kawarej dwaara jila str par hindi kii maujuud saarvajanik duniya kaa vistaar kiya he or saath hi akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskarnon ke dwaara anjaane main iskaa punarvishkaar kiya he
 In 1990, the report of the National Reader Survey stated that there was only one Hindi newspaper in the five leading newspapers
 pichley ne sabit kar diya ki ham kitni teji se bad rahe hai
 This time, the first four of the five most read newspapers are in Hindi
 ek utsahjanak baat or bhi he ki iares survey main jin 42 shaharon ko sabase teji se ubharta mana gaya he, unamem se zyaadaatar hindi hriday pradesh ke hai
 It is clear that if the states of the South have increased the tremendous growth of development in the last three decades, then for the next decade we belong to Hindi people
 aisa nahin he ki akhbaar ke adhyayan ke maamle main hi yah pradesh aguva sabit ho rahe hai
 a data from the IT industry shows that the number of people reading and writing on the net in Hindi and Indian languages is increasing continuously
 matlab saaf he
 This expansion of Hindi aspirations is also looking towards journalists
 pragati kii chetana ke saath samaaj kii nichali qatari main baithe log bhi samachar patron kii panktiyon main dikhne chahie
 The results of previous IAS, iits and all education councils have proved that even the people sitting on the lowest steps in Hindi speakers are ready for a big jump
