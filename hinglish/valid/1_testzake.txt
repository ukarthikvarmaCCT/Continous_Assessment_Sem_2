 oinstin ne pachaas se adhik shodh-patr or vigyaan se alag kitaaben likhin
 In 1999, Time magazine declared shatabdi-purush
 ek surveykshan ke anusaar ve saarvkalik mahanatam vaigyanik maane gaye
 Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers

 Einstein's intellectual achievements and singularities have made the term "einstein" synonymous with "intelligent"
 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light
 yahi baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke vishesh siddhant ke rup main janaa gaya
 The conclusion was that, in the time-space structure, the moving matter is seen as slow and narrow, when it is measured in the observer's frame
 is shodh-patr main yah bhi tark diya ki luminipheras ether kaa vichaar zarurat se zyaada tha
 In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein constructed e = mc2 from special relativity equations
 1905 se oinstin kaa saapekshata main shodh kai varshon tak vivaadaaspad bana rahaa, halaaki ise kai agrani bhautikavidon jaise kii maiks plank dwaara sweekaara bhi gaya
 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model
 1910 ke dashak ke dauraan, alag-alag pranaaliyon ko kwantum yantriki ke daayre main laane ke liye iskaa vistaar hua
 Following the discovery of Ernest Rutherford's nucleus, and the proposition that electrons revolve around planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the discrete motion of electrons in atoms of elements by quantum mechanical, initiated by Planck and developed by Einstein And the periodic table of the elements can be explained
 1898 ke wilhem viena ke tark ko iske saath jod kar oinstin ne iske vikaas main yogadan diya
 Vienna showed that, by the hypothesis of a thermodynamic variability of a thermal equilibrium state, all black rotations at different temperatures can be derived from each other by a simple transfer process
 1911 main oinstin ne yah paaya kii vahi samoshna siddhant yah dikhaata hai kii maatra jo kisi bhi yantric gati main pramaathran he ko ek sthiroshm aparivartaneey hona chahie
 Arnold Summerfield identified temperate invertebrates as dynamic variables in traditional mechanics
 is siddhant ke anusaar- Albert Einstein has made a huge contribution in this subject
 yatra karte samay, oinstin ne apni patni elsa tathaa dattak putree kadamuni margot or ilse ke liye patr likhaa karte the
 These letters can be found at The Hebrew University
 margot oinstin ne in nijee patron ko janata ke liye uplabdh karaane kii anumati de di thi, lekin saath hi yah anurodh kiya ki uski mrityu ke bees saal baad tak aisa nahin kiya jaye

 Frankland first isolated a carbonyl compound called di-ethyl zinc in 1849 and determined its structure
 baad main anek dhaatuon or upadhaatuon ke sanyog se kai yogicon kaa sanshleshan kiya gaya
 These compounds have played an important role in the advancement of modern chemistry, such as tetra-ethyl sis, which is a highly useful reaction used in motor fuels

 In 1952, a semester before Ernesto "fuser" Guevara was about to complete his medical degree, he and his old friend Alberto, a biochemist, left Buenos Aires to travel to the South American continent in search of fun and vitality
 While at the end of their journey they have one goal - they want to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is tourism

 Along with social injustice these Samans changed Guevara's view of the world and by implication later inspired his political activities as a revolutionary
 "every generation needs a journey story; every generation needs a story about what it is to be transformed by geography, what it is to be transformed by encounters with cultures and people that are alien from yourself, and you know that age group 15 to 25, that’s the perfect generation to get on a motorcycle, to hit the road, to put on your backpack and just go out
" Guevara makes his symbolic "final voyage" that night
 Despite his asthma, he chooses to swim across the river in the leper's hut instead of the doctors' cabin, which divides the two separate societies of the leper colony

 iske uttar main europe ke spain or jibraltar kshetra hai jabaki dakshin main uttari africa ke marokko or seuta kshetra hai
 At its closest point, the continents of Europe and Africa have a distance of only 14
3 km
 kyonki yah bumadhya sagar or atlantic mahaasaagar ke bich main yatayaat kaa ek sikuda hua bindu he isaliye is jalsandhi par qabza karnaa aitihaasik rup se mahatvapurn rahaa he
 The Arabs from North Africa had conquered Spain by crossing the Strait at the beginning of the medieval period, and the Spaniards re-established their empire several hundred years later by pushing them across the Strait
 aaj se 59 lakh varsh purv jibraltar jalsandhi dhire-dhire band ho gai or bumadhya sagar or atlantic kaa sampark tut gaya
 The Mediterranean Sea dried up over time and the concentration of salt in its water increased
 anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki yadi aaj jibraltar jalsandhi band ho jaae to 1000 varshon main bumadhya sagar kaa adhiktar pani suukh jayega or yah ek faili hui namak se bhari droni ban jaaegi
 The Strait started opening up about 53
3 lakh years ago
 yah pehle to ruk-ruk ke hua lekin phir jalsandhi puri tarah khul gai
 Due to this, the water of Atlantic Ocean started to fall in the Mediterranean Sea due to the fierce flow
 anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ko puri tarah bharne main kuch mahino se lekar 2 varshon tak kaa samay laga
 Paving of the Mediterranean Sea is about 1 km below the Atlantic, and the current would have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea with a 1000-meter-per-second sea-water roar
 bhavishya main africa or europe kii lagaataar kam hoti duuri se aaj se lakhon varsh baad yah jalsandhi phir se band ho jaaegi or bumadhya sagar main shushkikaran phir hone lagegaa
