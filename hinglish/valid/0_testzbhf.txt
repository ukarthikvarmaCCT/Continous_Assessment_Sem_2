 Crime is the one which is forbidden by law

 However, illegal acts of law are no longer a crime

 yadi chat par patang udaate samay kisi ladke ke pair se ek pathar neeche sadak par aa jaae or kisi duusare ke sir par girakar praan le le to vah ladkaa hatya kaa apradhi nahin he

 Winston Churchill, who has become a famous British politician and many a time minister, says that the public's sense and vision towards crime and criminality can only give a real estimate of the civilization of that country
 british kanoon usee kaam ko aparaadh samajhataa he jo durbhaav se, swechhaya, dhoortattapurvak kiya, karaayaa, karne diya yaa hone diya gaya ho
 There are many crimes that are not considered crimes simply because they are crimes
 jaise, britain main jin prakaar ke vivaah nazaij he atah yadi vivaah ho bhi gaya to vah vivaah nahin samajha jayega, jaise 16 varsh se kam umr kii ladki se vivaah karnaa ityadi
 The form and type of crime has also changed in the new industrial civilization

 Psychology considers crime to be the result of man's mental complications
 jis vyakti kaa balykaal prem ore protsaahan ke vaataavaran main nahin bitta uske man main unek prakaar kii hinata kii maansik granthiyaan ban jaati hai
 In these glands, a lot of his mental strength is stored in his mind
 dow alfred edler kaa kathan he ki jis vyakti ke man main hinata kii maansik granthiyaan rahati hai vah anivaary rup se anek prakaar ke aparaadh karata he
 He commits this crime so that he can prove himself stronger than others
 hinata kii granthi tis vyakti main man main rahati he vah sadaa bhitari maansik asantosh kii sthiti main rahata he
 He keeps himself engaged in such works all the time so that everyone will look at him and praise him
 hinata kii maansik granthi manushya ko aise kaamon main lagaati he jinke karne se manushya ko anek prakaar kii ninda sunani padati he
 This person always wants to keep himself the subject of discussion
 yadi uske bhale kaamon ke liye charchaa nahin hui to bure kaamon ke liye hi ho
 His mental gland does not let him remain calm
 vah use sadaa vishesh kaam karne ke liye prerana detii rahati he
 If such a person is punished, it does not improve him, but it makes his mental gland even more complicated

 One of the objectives of proper education is that the child should have the ability to control himself

 These people were proficient in intellect right from birth, so they could know many types of thoughts
 parantu unke man main bachapan main hi aise sthaayee bhav nahin bane jisase ve swayan ko anuchit kaary karne se roak saken
 Till these permanent expressions become a part of human nature, they do not give the ability to stop human from misconduct
 aise vidvan log aparaadh karte hai or unke liye swayan ko koste bhi hai
 This increases their mental confusion

 iske antargat manushya yaa kisi anya praani / padap ke sharir main maujuud bhinn-bhinn angon evam tantron ke kaaryon or un kaaryon ke hone ke kaarnon ke saath-saath unase sambandhit chikitsa vigyaan ke niyamon kaa bhi gyaan diya jaataa he
 For example, the ears do the work of hearing and the eyes do the work of seeing, but in relation to hearing and seeing physiology it provides knowledge about how the sound reaches the ear screen and the rays of light fall on the lens of the eye
 How the image of the object reaches the brain
 isi prakaar, manushya jo bhojan karata he, uskaa pachan kis prakaar hota he, pachan ke ant main uskaa aanton kii bhittiyon se avasorana kis prakaar hota he, aadi
 The basic natural events of life of all living organisms are the same
 atyant asmaan jeevon main kriyavigyaan apni samasyaayen atyant spasht rup main upasthit karata he
 In high-level beings, the actions of the major organs of the body are very specific, which makes it possible to understand them by paying attention to the subtle details of the actions
 )nimnlikhit mul prakritik ghatnaayen hai, jinase jeev pahachaane jate hai: Organization - This is more evident in higher level beings
 sanrachana or kriya ke vikaas main samantarata hoti he, jisase sharirkriyavidon kaa yah kathan siddh hota he ki sanrachana hi kriya kaa nirdharak upadan he
 There is subtle cooperation in different parts of the person, which increases the power of the creature to adapt to the surrounding environment
 urja kii khapat - jeev urja ko visarjeet karte hai
 Man's life is created by the physical activities that relate him to the environment
 in shaareerik kriyakalapon ke liye urja kaa satat vyay aavashyak he
 In the absence of food or oxygen, the activities of the body come to an end
 sharir main adhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hone par uski purti bhojan evam oxigen kii adhik maatra se hoti he
 Thus respiration and disorganization activities are necessary for life
 jin vastuon se hamaare khaadya padaarth banate hai, ve oxikaran main sakasham hoti hai
 This oxidation action produces heat
 sharir main honevaali oxikaran kii kriya se urja utpann hoti he, jo jivit praani kii kriyasheeltaa ke liye uplabdh rahati he
 Growth and reproduction - If the metabolic process is predominant, then growth occurs, with which the power of compensation is associated
 vruddhi kaa prakram ek nishchit samay tak chalata he, jiske baad prayek jeev vibhakt hota he or uskaa ek ansh alag hokar ek yaa anek nae vyaktiyon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Each of them has all the properties that the native organism has
 sabhi ucch koti ke jeevon main mul jeev kshayshil hone lagata he or antat: mrityu ko praapt hota he
 Adaptation - There is a common feature in all living organisms, that is the power of adaptation
 aantar sambandh tathaa bahya sambandhon ke satat samanvay kaa naam anukulan he
 The actual environment of living cells is the tissue fluid in which they reside
 yah aantar vaataavaran, praani ke saamaanya vaataavaran main honevaale parivartanon se prabhavit hota he
 For the survival of the organism it is necessary to neutralize the changes in the environment, so that the internal environment, as it may be, remains within the living limits
 yahi anukulan he
 Most of the knowledge of physiology has been available from daily life and study of patients, but some knowledge has also been available from experiments conducted on animals
 rasayan, bhautikee, sharirarachana vigyaan or oothkavigyaan se iskaa atyant nikat kaa sambandh he
 Analytical physiology is thus built on the knowledge gained from experiments conducted on living beings, or on isolated parts, which survive for some time in a favorable state
 prayogon se vibhinn sanrachanaatmak bhaagon ke gun or kriyaayein gyaat hoti hai
 In synthetic physiology we try to find out how the processes of the body are synthesized by the mobilizing processes, forming the cooperative processes of different parts and how the organisms, by harmonizing their different organs in the macro form, Reacts to change in external condition
 pratimaan - sanrachana or sharirkriyaatmak gunon main ek hi jati ke praani aapas main bahut milte julate hai or jaev lakshanon ke maanak praroop kii ore unmukh yah pravriti jeev or uske vatavaran ke bich sannikat saamanjasy kii abhivyakti he
 This similarity is highest among beings born from the same parent, at the same time
 jyon jyon ham anya jatiyon ke praaniyon kii samaantaaon ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai, unamem bhed badhata jaataa he or praaniyon ke vargeekaran main jantujgat ke chhoron par sthit praaniyon kaa antar itnaa adhik hota he ki unki tulana aspasht hoti he
 Nevertheless, where there is a very close relationship between individual beings, as in human race, the difference between them is also evident
 saamaanya maanav vyashti kaa adhyayan karnaa, maanav fiziology kaa kartavya he, kyonki isse rog ke adhyayan kii mahatvapurn aadharbhumi taiyaar hoti he, parantu yah kahana ki kisi prastut lakshan kaa prakritik swaroop kya he, kathin he
 In addition, the results of all physiologic experiments show substantial differences, depending on the individual nature of the disposable animals
 isiilie mahatvapurn samuchit niyantranon kaa or mahatvapurn parinaam kaa adhimulyan nahin hona chahie
 Ideal results are often considered to determine the outcome
 prayogon kii punraritiyaan aavashyak hai
 The error of observation, which is often small in real sciences, is very high in biology, because of variable variability in observation due to variable individuality
 jis prakaar anya vigyaanon main parinaamon ko sankhyikee dwaara vivechit kiya jaataa he, vaise hi fiziology ko parinaamon kii sambhavita ke niyam kii prayukti se vivechit kiya jaataa he
 Very careful decision making is required from a limited number of experiments in terms of whether the results obtained are different from the controlled ranges
 kathinaaiyon ko dur karne kii ek vidhi ke rup main ausaton, arthath samaantar madhya, kaa aashray liya jaataa he, jaise ham kehete hai, maanav ke kisi samudaay vishesh main prati ghan millimetre rakt main laal selon kii ausat sankhya 5 karod 20 lakh he
 Although this method is the most fluid and highly behaved, it is unsatisfactory because it does not determine in what magnitude the deviation from the mean and how often is relative
 hamaare paas yah gyaat karne kaa koi saadhan nahin rah jaataa ki uparyukt udhaaharan main 4 karod 50 lakh saamaanya paraas ke andar he yaa nahin
 As a result, the practice of using more realistic means to express the results of statistics is increasing
 chunki kisi vigyaan kii vartmaan avasthaa ko samajhane ke liye uske vikaas kaa itihaas gyaat hona aavashyak he, isliye phiziology se ruchi rakhanevaale vyakti ke liye uske itihaas kii ruparekha se parichit hona aavashyak he
 As far as the development of the overall subject is concerned, it is a matter of keeping in mind that no part of science can develop separately, all parts depend on each other
 udaahranarth, ek nishchit seemaa tak sharir ke gyaan ke bina fiziology kii kalpana asambhav thi or isi prakaar bhautikee or rasayan kii ek seemaa tak viksit avasthaa ke bina bhi isaki pragati asambhav thi
 Below is a list of important names that have given the subject an epoch-making twist from time to time, considering the publication of 'fabrica humanis corporis' in 1543 AD by André Vicelius
 1795 i
 main fiziolosi kii pehali patrika nikali
 The English Journal of Physiology was published in 1878 AD and the American Journal of Physiology in 1898 AD
 1874 i
 main landan main university kaleje or america ke harvard main 1876 i
 main fiziolosi ke english chair kii sthapana hui
 Thus we see that Physiology is a new subject, which began barely a century ago
 jeevarsayan or bhi nayaa vishay he tathaa fiziolosi kii ek prashakha ke rup main viksit hua he
 Chandragommin was a famous Buddhist grammarian
 ve 'chandra vyakaran' naamak prasiddh granth ke pravartak maane jate rhe
 His other famous names were 'chandra' and 'chandracharya'
 inkaa samay jayaditya or vaaman kii 'kashika' tathaa bhartruhari ke 'vaakyapadiya' se nishchit rup main purvavarti he
 Many of his manuals are accepted without nomination in Kashikasutravruti
 vaakya padiya main bataaya gaya he ki pantajali ko shishyparampara main jo vyakaran nashtabhrasht ho gaya tha use chandraacharyaadi ne anek shakhaon main pun-pranit kiya 
 The example cited in the Chandra grammar is mentioned by reference to 'ajayd Gupto Hunan' that the victory of the Gupta emperor happened during the lifetime of the writer Chandracharya
 at: saamaanya rup se chandragomin kaa samay 470 i
 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 His first nomenclature is probably in 'syntactic'
 inkaa nirmit granth, jo mulat: sutratmak he parantu jisapar likhit vrittibhag bhi sambhavat: unheen kaa he, chandra vyakaran he
 It is different from Paninipuravarvati available lunar grammar
 aisa anumit he ki is chandra vyakaran kii rachana chandracharya ne bauddhabhikkhuon aadi kaa padhaane ke liye kii thi
 Vedic language is not the grammar of the process used in it
 iske anek kaaran ho sakate hai
 Being a Buddhist, perhaps Chandragomin considered the scripture of Brahmadharmanayyayas as their religious-ceremonial speech and deemed the grammatical construction of the language unnecessary
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki hajaaron varsh puraani vaidic sanskrit ke bhashaprayegon kii vyakaranvivechna ko adhik prayojan kaa na samajha ho- vishesh rup se sanskrit bhashagnanarthi baudhon ke liye
 One reason is that due to the urge to create a simplified grammatical system, they have not been desired to write a grammar of residual language in old and obsolete in practice
 is vyakarangranth kii rachana aisa sarvapratham mahaprayas he jise ham panineey ashtaadhi kaa pratisanshodhit punassanskaran kah sakate hai
 The second such epic attempt is a grammar book called 'saraswati Kantabharan' of Bhojraj
 isamen katyayan or patanjali ke vaarthik or mahabhashyiya sampurna sujhaavon or sanshodhano ko praaia: apana liya gaya he
 In this grammar, the nouns that have been derived from the noun, especially monosyllabic nouns like 'ti', 'ghu', are excluded
 isi kaaran is sampradaay ko 'asanjnak' vyakaran bhi kehete hai
 Nevertheless, its basic structure is certainly built on the foundation of Ashtadhyayi
 is vyakaran ke adhikansh sutara ashtaadhi ke hi hai yaa ashtaadhi sutron ke hi roopaantar hai
 In the transformed formulas there are some in which even the words are only of Panini, only their order has changed, such as in place of Panini's 'anekashitva Sarvasya' and 'adyantou Takitou' Sutras are 'shidanekal' Sarvastha and 'takitavarganthau' respectively
 kalkram se prachlit navaprayogon ke liye kuch nutan sutara bhi nirmit hai
 The corresponding number is about 3100
 kaha jaataa he, vyakaranparishisht rup main chandragomin ne unadipth, dhatupath, ganpaath, lingakarika, varnasutra or upsargavritti kii bhi rachana kii thi jinamein unadisuchi or dhatupath kaa prakaashan 'chandravyakaran' granth ke saath hi hua he
 The 'varnasutra' describes the efforts of the place of the Varnas in the same formulas of Panini education
 'chandravyakaransutravriti' ke atirikt dharmik granth 'shishylekh' or 'lokanand' naatak ke nirmaan kaa, jinka adhik mahatv nahin he, gaurav bhi chandracharya ko praapt he
 The most surprising thing in this context is that this book, which was prevalent in the study of studies in Bengal till a few centuries ago and cited by subsequent legalizations, was found in Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet, not in Bengal itself
 dow libeesh ne tibet se praapt kar iskaa prakaashan kiya

 Allen and Seaman claim that nearly a quarter of the total students admitted to post-secondary education in 2008 were opting for online courses as a whole, and a report by Ambient Insight Research shows that in 2009 the United States In the US, 44 percent of post-graduate students were taking some or all of their courses online and it was estimated that this figure Dada will increase to 81 percent by 2014
 is prakaar yah dekha ja saktaa he ki i-shiksha kam se kam sanyukt rajya america main madhyamikottar shiksha kaa ek pramukh rup banane ke liye badi tezi se apni simaaen laangh rahaa he
 Many higher education, namely for-profit institutions, now offer online classes

 E-education services were developed when computers were first used in education
 mishrit shiksha sevaaon kii taraf badhane kii ek pravriti hoti he jahaan computer-aadhaarit gatividhiyon ko vyaavhaarik yaa kaksha-aadhaarit paristhitiyon ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Bates and Pool and the OECD suggest that e-education of various types or forms does not require any e-education, ie no use of computers and / or internet for teaching and learning, ranging from classroom support, such as a curriculum or Providing powerpoint slides of classroom lectures to students through the education management system, via the laptop program, where students bring laptops into the classroom And they need to be used face-to-face as part of the classroom and hybrid learning, where class time is reduced rather than eliminated, and also through online education as a whole More time is devoted to education, which is a form of distance education, to be considered a continuum
 yah vargeekaran kuch had tak i-shiksha kii sthiti par aadhaarit slone kamishan kii report ke vargeekaran kii tarah hi he, jo praudyogiki ke upyog kii badhati tivrata ko darshane ke liye web vardhit, web poorak or web aadhaarit shiksha ko sanderbhit karata he
 In the Bates and Pool continuum, 'mixed education' may include classroom support, laptop and hybrid education, while 'distributed education' may include either hybrid or total online education
 to yah dekha ja saktaa he ki i-shiksha anuprayogon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa kaa varnan kar saktaa he or yah sahakarmi kii samiksha vaale shodh prakashnon main bhi bilkul spasht nahin he ki kis tarah kii i-shiksha par charchaa kii ja rahi he
 However, Bates and Pool argue that when instructors state that they are using e-learning, it often refers to the use of technology as a classroom aid, although over time, all online education There has also been a gradual increase in
 computer-aadhaarit shiksha, jise kabhi-kabhi sankshep main sibiel bhi kaha jaataa he, shaikshik vaataavaran ke ek mukhya ghatak ke rup main computer ke upyog ko sanderbhit karata he
 While it may refer to the use of computers in a classroom, the term more broadly refers to a structural environment in which computers are used for teaching purposes
 is avadharana ko aam taur par un myanon main computaron ke istemaal se alag rup main dekha jaataa he jahaan shiksha kam se kam anubhav kaa ek paridhiy tatv he 
 Computer-based trainings are self-driven learning activities accessible through a computer or manual device
 sibiti aam taur par ek raikhik fishan main samagriyon ko prastut karata he jo bahut kuch ek online pustak yaa niyam-pustika ko padhane kii tarah hi hota he
 For this reason, they are often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations

 Evaluation can be easily recorded and recorded through online software by providing information of end-user immediate feedback and completion status
 upyogkarta aksar pramaan-patron ke rup main paripurna record ko print karne main sakasham hote hai
 cbts provide a different type of learning motivation than textbooks, manuals, or traditional education methods of classroom-based learning
 udhaaharan ke liye, sibiti satat shiksha aavashyaktaaon kii santoshjanak purti ke liye upyogkarta-anukool samaadhaan pradaan karte hai
 Instead of limiting students from attending courses or reading printed rulebooks, students are able to gain knowledge and skills through methods that are much more suited to personal learning preferences
 udhaaharan ke liye, sibiti anemeshan yaa video ke madhyam se drishy shiksha laabh pradaan karte hai, jo aam taur par anya kisi bhi saadhan se praapt nahin hote hai
 CBT can be a good alternative to printed education materials because a thriving medium, including video or animation, can be easily interleaved to enhance education
 sibiti kaa ek or laabh yah bhi he ki ek baar aarambhik vikaas kaary puraa ho jane par inhen vyapak darshakon ko apekshaakrit kam laagat par aasaani se vitarit kiya ja saktaa he

 In datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work, John johnson-illola describes a typical computer-supported collaboration space: The Smart Board
 johnson-ilola ke anusaar, ek "smart board pranali ek 72-inch, pichhlaa prakshepan, tachascreen, kaary hetu kushal whitboard sataha pradaan karti he" 
 In datacloud, johnson-ilola emphasizes that "we are trying to understand how users move within the information space, how users can stay within the information space rather than just looking at them, and How information places should be shared with other people instead of being confined to themselves, who used to reside in it instead of just visiting
 vah vyakhya karte hai ki kaise smart board pranali ek soochna sthaan pradaan karti he jo apane chaatro ko sakriy sahyog main sanlagn hone kii anumati pradaan karata he
 He makes three different claims about the functionality of this technology: 1) this smart board system allows users to work with much information, 2) it provides an information space that proactively supports Invites, 3) Generated tasks are often "dynamic and emergent"
 johnson-ilola further states that with smart boards "

 Bernard Laskin, the pioneer of e-education, argues that if e-education is to be effective, then the word "E" must have a greater understanding of the wider meaning

 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai

 In India, this topic has remained taboo till date

 While this is the time that they need more care
 bharat main masik dharm ke dauraan mahilaon or ladakiyon kaa jivan The mention of this subject in India has been forbidden in the past only because there is a legend associated with the history of our Hindu culture
 jiske anusaar indra devtaa se ek brahman kii hatya ho gai thi
 Part of the sin of that murder was given to women
 jiske kaaran unhen masik dharm hota he
 During which they are considered profane
 isi apavitrataa ke kaaran unhen dharmik kaaryo main bhaag lene se manaa kiya jaataa he
 The second reason is the mantra of Hindu deities in Sanskrit
 jisko padhane ke liye ekaagratha kii jarurat hoti he
 But during menstruation, women and girls suffer unbearable pain
 jiske kaaran unka dhyaan puja main nahin lag saktaa
 Even if you sit in worship and kill, there is a fear of making mistakes and committing sins
 jisase bachaane ke liye unhen roka jaataa he
 Due to restriction masik dharm ke dauraan "puja" kamare main pravesh nahin karnaa shahari ladakiyon ke bich pratibandit hota he, jabaki rasoighar main pravesh nahin karnaa gramin ladakiyon main mukhya pratibandh hota he
 Girls and women are also prohibited from praying and touching holy books during menstruation

 Women who participated in a study also reported that during menstruation, the body emits some specific odor or rays, which spoil preserved food
 or, isliye, unhen achaar jaise khaadya padaarthon ko chune kii anumati nahin he
 However, as long as general hygiene measures are taken into account, no scientific tests show menstruation as the cause of any food spoilage

 However, there seems to be no logical or scientific explanation for this
 bharat ke kuch hisson main, masik dharm se guzar rahi ladakiyon / mahilaon dwaara kuch sakht aahaar pratibandhon kaa bhi paalan kiya jaataa he jaise ki dahi, chimney, or achaar jaise khattey bhojan ko chune se manaa kiya jaataa he

 Fact aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi koi ladki yaa mahilaayein apni avadhi ke dauraan ek gaay ko chooti hai, to gaay banjh jaaegi - pramukh ladkiyaan shaap or ashuddhta ke saath apane sharir ko jodatii hai
 In many less economically developed countries, large numbers of girls drop out of school when menstruation begins
 isamen bharat main 23% se zyada ladkiyaan shaamil hai
 In addition, the monthly menstrual period also poses a barrier for female teachers
 bharat main 77% se adhik masik dharm ladkiyaan or mahilaayein puraane kapade kaa upyog karti hai, jise aksar pun: upyog kiya jaataa he
 In addition, 88% of women in India sometimes resort to using ash, newspapers, dried leaves, and husk sand to aid absorption
