 Katappa continues to listen to his story of how he killed Bahubali


 kalkey se jeetne ke baad, mahishmati main amarendra bahubali ko bhavishya kaa raja or bhallaal dev ko senapati ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets her answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger
 kuntal samrajya par pinjariyon kaa hamalaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of Devasena's brother Kumar Verma, Amarendra foils the attack and saves Kuntal
 amarendra use bataa detaa he ki vah koun he or shivgami ke krodh ke bhay ko dur karne or use apni dulhan banane hetu raji karne kii koshish karata he
 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he
 After 25 years, Mahendra Bahubali, son of Bhallaldev and Amarendra Bahubali, has a fierce battle and Bhallaldev is defeated in this war
 mahendra bahubali kaa rajbhishek hota he or mahismati kaa nayaa raja ban jaataa he

 The issue of global justice in political philosophy is born out of the notion that the world is largely unjust
 antarrashtriya str par lagu kiye ja sakane vaale vaishvik nyaay kii sankalpana jon rolls kii rachana 1999 main prakashit 'da lau of pipuls' se nikali he
 In his famous work 'A Theory of Justice', he underlined through the discriminatory principle in the context of operating a better liberal society that economic and social inequalities should be adjusted in such a way that the person in the lowest position would benefit the most
 
 yahan rolls kaa iraadaa nyaay sambandhi is yukti ko raashtra kii simaaon main lagu karne kaa he
 But Charles Bij and then Thomas Poge insisted that these principles presented by Rawls should be applied internationally
 unki daleel thi ki jin kaarnon se rolls inhen ek raashtra-rajya ke bheetar lagu karnaa chaahate hai, ve vaishvik str par bhi maujuud hai
 These people were disappointed when Rawls made it clear that the theory he gave was not related to global justice
 antarrashtriya str par nyaay kii apni sankalpana vyakt karne ke liye rolls ne da lau of pipuls kii rachana karke un kanoonon ko spasht kiya jinke bare main unka mat he ki unase ‘suvyavasthit log’ sahamat honge
 Rawls has included liberal people and 'decent non-liberal people' in the category of well-organized people
 rolls ne 'da lau of pipul' main yathartwaadee utapia apanaaya he
 According to Rawls, this is realistic because it takes into account many real conditions
 masalan, vaastavik duniya main vividhta bahut zyaada he or duniya ke sabhi log na udaarataavaadi mulyon ko apanaate hai or na hi unase in mulyon ko apnaane kii ummid bhi kii ja sakati he
 While building his theory on many levels, first of all he has focused only on those who are liberal
 uske liye unhone do mul sthitiyon kaa prayog kiya he jinamein pehali sanvaidhanik loktantric shashan kii udaarataavaadi sankalpana ke liye saamaajik samjhaute se sambandhit he
 The second basic position is for representatives of liberal people
 pehali mul sthiti main log is baat par faisalaa karte hai ki samaaj kii buniyadi sanrachana niyantrit karne kii nishpaksh sharten kya hongi
 After ensuring the governing principles of liberal society, Rawls turns to the international level and decides what kind of foreign policy the liberal people will choose
 rolls ke mutabik is mukaam par udaarataavaadi logon ke pratinidhiyon kii aankhon par ek vishisht ‘agyaan kaa pardaa’ padaa hota he
 For example, they do not know which geographical area they are from and what their powers are, etc
 rolls spasht karte hai ki udaarataavaadi log aath siddhanton or teen sansthaaon kaa chunaav karte hai
 The eight principles adopted in this original state speak of being equal to people, respecting their freedom, adhering to the agreements and promises made by them, following a policy of non-interference and focusing on self-defense
 saath hi spasht kiya gaya he ki in usulon ke mutabik aatmaraksha ke alaava kisi bhi anya kaaran se yuddh kaa sahaara nahin le sakate hai
 Apart from this, these eight principles emphasize that people will support human rights, adhere to certain conduct restrictions even in the time of war and it will be their duty to help those who are justified or restrained due to adverse conditions Or are not able to achieve a decent political and social order
 rolls ke anusaar udaarataavaadi logon dwaara chuni gayi teen sansthaaon main se ek sanstha logon ke bich nyaaypurna vyapaar sunishchit karegi, duusari logon ko kooparative bankig sanstha se udhaar lene main samarth banaayegi or teesri sanstha vahi bhoomika nibhaayegi jo sanyukt-raashtra dwaara nibhaai jaati he
 According to Rawls, this situation is of the Confederations of People
 udaarataavaadiyon ke baad rolls kaa dhyaan un logon par jaataa he ki kis tarah shaleen yaa maryaadit oonch-neech vaale log bhi is tarah ke siddhanton or sanghathanon kaa chunaav karenge
 According to Rawls, to get into the category of such decent people, it is necessary to pass four criteria
 ye chaar kasautiyaan hai
 First, society should not be aggressive
 use apana kaam is tarah se karnaa chahie jo duusare samaajon ke liye shantipurna or sammanjanak ho
 Second, its legal system and the idea of justice should protect the basic rights of all members of society
 ise kam-se-kam har kisi ke jivan ke adhikaar yani jeevika or suraksha ke adhikaar, swatantraaa kaa adhikaar arthath daastaa se mukti, vyaktigat sampatti ke adhikaar or aupchaarik samanta ke adhikaar ko manyata deni chahie
 Rawls believes that such rights should be recognized on behalf of liberals and non-liberals
 teesri, shaleen logon ko aisi vyavastha apnaani chahie jisamen kanoonee vyavastha kaa prashasan karne vaale logon ko yah vishwaas ho ki kanoon main saamaanya shubh shaamil he
 Fourth, decent people should have a decent post-process process of deliberation in which the vital interests of all members of society can be accommodated
 rolls shaleen padsopaneey vyaktiyon ke udhaaharan ke rup main ek kaalpanik sthaan kaizanistan kii kalpana karte hai
 According to him, Kazakhstan can be seen as a society of well-organized people
 unka aagrah he ki udaarataavaadi samaaj apni videsh niti main kaizanistan jaise rajyon ko sahan karne kii kshamta viksit karen
 According to Rawls, one can realistically expect only a system like that of Afghanistan
 ve is baat par bhi jor dete hai ki udaarataavaadiyon dwaara shaleen gair- udaarataavaadiyon ko protsaahit karte hue is baat par jor nahin dena chahie ki har samaaj udaarataavaadi hi ho
 Such insistence can end the liveliness of these gracious people
 rolls maanate hai ki log udaarataavaadi hon yaa gair-udaarataavaadi, unke bich parsparik sammaan kaa kaayam rahanaa sabase zaruri he
 There is a difference of opinion between the supporters of universalism and Rawls in terms of helping poor countries
 rolls maanate hai ki kuch samaajon main suvyavasthit banane ke liye aavashyak raajnneetik or saanskrithik paramparaon, maanviya panji, gyaan, bhautik tathaa takneekee sansadhano kaa abhaav hota he
 It is the duty of well-organized people to help such societies become like people
 arthath yahan nyaaypurna sansthaaon kii sthapana karnaa hi unka pramukh kaam he
 This is the goal of helping the societies burdened or backward in the past
 rolls ke anusaar ek baar yah lakshya hasil ho jane par aage kisi madad kii zarurat nahin rahati, bhale hi yah samaaj tulanaatmak rup se garib banaarhe
 According to Rawls, the political culture of that society has an important role in the prosperity of certain societies
 sampatti jamaa sansadhano se nahin balki kisi khaas samaaj kii raajnneetik sanskri ti se utpann hoti he
 It also plays an important role in the religious, philosophical and moral traditions that reinforce the basic structure of the political and social institutions of that society
 iske alaava adhyavsaay or sahyog kii pravriti kii bhi badi bhoomika hoti he
 Actually all these aspects together increase the prosperity of a society
 rolls inhen kaarnon ke aadhaar par a thiyari of justise main pesh kiye gayi nyaay ke siddhant ko rajyon ke bich antarrashtriya str par lagu karne kaa virodh karte he
 Rawls has a clear belief that once people are capable of self-determination and 'logically' about their affairs, the duty to help ends
 kai aalochakon kaa vichaar he ki rolls ‘pipul’ se sambandhit vichaar paryaapt rup se spasht nahin he
 Rawls is mistaken in believing that states are so independent of each other that they can be held solely responsible for the status of their citizens
 darasal, ek bhedbhaav- aadhaarit antarrashtriya raajnneetik arthvyavastha kii maujuudagi bhi khaas rajyon kii garibi or kuch sampannataa ke liye zimmedaar hoti he
 Thomas Poge has clarified that two international rights play a special role: first the international lending privilege and the international resource privilege
 koi sarkaar apane rajya main apni shaktiyon kaa kis tarah prayog kar rahi he, isaki chintaa antarrashtriya samudaay nahin karata
 It does not even matter much about how this group came to power or how it is using its power
 damankaaree sarkarein apane desh kii ore se udhaar le sakati hai— yah unka antarrashtriya sansaadhan visheshadhikaar hota he, yaa ve apane desh ke prakritik sansadhano ko bech sakati hai— yah inkaa antarrashtriya sansaadhan visheshadhikaar hota he
 According to Poge, because it benefits internationally rich countries, they also accept this situation
 isliye hamen aarthik pahaluon par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Poge emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the people living in prosperous developed societies to end the unjust global system and protect the poor from the pitfalls
 poge yah suzav dete hai ki lagbhag ek pratishat kaa vaishvik sansaadhan tex laganaa chahie jiskaa istemaal vikasshil samaajon ke sabase garib logon kii bhalaai ke liye ho
 It is the responsibility of the people of the developed society to help the poor people
 rolls ne aarthik rup se duniya ke garibon kii madad karne ke kisi spasht daayitv ko rekhaankit nahin kiya he, jabaki thomas poge ne rolls se aage jate hue is par jor diya ki amir logon kaa daayitv he ki ve garib logon kii madad karen
 But the main limitation of the form of global justice which Pogé envisioned is that it only invokes the moral agency of the people of the rich countries
 lekin garib logon kii agency par koi dhyaan nahin diya he
 That is, in this theory, there is a complete neglect of how poor people view global injustice or justice

 anya sammaan main shaamil he, tamilnadu rajya film puraskaar, nandi puraskaar or vijay puraskaar, jahaan camel hasan ne dashavatharam main apane yogadan ke liye chaar alag puraskaar jite
 In 2014, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan
 parivaar saadharantaya pati, patni or bacchon ke samooh ko kehete hai, kintu duniya ke adhikansh bhaagon main vah sammilit vaasavale rakt sambandhiyon kaa samooh he jisamen vivaah or dattak pratha dwaara sweekrut vyakti bhi sammilit hai
 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another
 vyakti kii saamaajik maryaada bahut kuch parivaar se hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal
 usamen desh, kaal, paristhiti or pratha aadi ke bhed sa ek yaa anek pidiyon kaa or ek yaa anek danpatiyon athwa pati-patniyon ke samoohon kaa hona sambhav he, uske sadsy ek paariwarik anushaasan vyavastha ke atirikt pati or patni, bhai or bahan, pitamah or pautra, chachaa or bhattije, saas or putravadhu jaise sambandhon tathaa kartavyon evam adhikaron se paraspar aabaddh, anya saamaajik samoohon ke sandarbh main ek ghanishtatam antarang samooh ke rup main rahete hai
 Within the family, the division of sex between men and women is also universal and time-bound
 striyon kaa adhikansh samay ghar main vyateet hota he
 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage
 levis margan aadi vikasvaadiyon kaa mat he ki maanav samaaj kii praarambhik avasthaa main vivaah pratha nahin thi or purna kamachar prachlit tha
 This was followed by a state of youth marriage, polyandry, polyandry and monogamy or monogamy in the social development
 vastut: bahuvivaah or ekapatnitv kii pratha asabhy or sabhy sabhi samaajon main pai jaati he
 Therefore, this view does not appear to be evidence
 maanav shishu ke paalan poshan ke liye lambii avadhi apekshit he or pehle bachein kii baalyavastha main hi anya chote bachche utpann hote rahete hai
 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary
 phir, pashuon kii bhanti manushya main rati kii koi vishesh ritu nahin he
 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he
 In the couple's family, husband and wife together establish their separate household
 kintu adhikansh samaajon main yah parivaar brihattar kautumbik samooh kaa ang mana jaataa he or jivan ke anek prasangon main parivaar par brihattar kautubik samooh kaa, ghanisht sambadh ke atirikt, niyantran hota he
 In industrialized countries like the USA, there has been a multiplicity of couples in place of a family of couples
 yadhyapi vahaan kaa samaaj pitruvansheey he, phir bhi yugal parivaar vahaan kisi ek brihattar kutumb kaa ang nahin mana jaataa
 The couple consists of a husband wife and, on birth, their unmarried children
 sammilit pariwaron main inke atirikt vivaahit bachche or unki santan, vivaahit bhai athwa bahan or unke bachche saath rah sakate hai
 The circumference of blood relatives in the included family is different in different societies
 bharat jaise desh main ek sammilit parivaar main saadhaarant: 10-12 sadsy hote hai, kintu kuch pariwaron main sadasyon kii sankhya 50-60 yaa 100 tak hoti he
 Families have different forms and types based on different forms of marriage, lineage, ownership and authority
 matrusthaneey parivaar main pati apni patni ke ghar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy banataa he, jabaki pitristhaneey parivaar main patni pati ke ghar jaakar rahati he
 Maternal families are generally matriarchal and patrilineal families are patrilineal
 bahudhaa parivaar kii sampatti kaa swaamitv pitristhaneey parivaar main purush ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main nari ko praapt he
 The eldest child is usually the heir to the property
 kintu yah aavashyak nahin he
 In the tribe like Garo of India, only the smallest girl is the owner of the family property
 anek samaajon main parivaar ke sabhi stri yaa purush sadasyon main swamitv nihit hota he or kuch main purush tathaa stri donon ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikaar praapt he
