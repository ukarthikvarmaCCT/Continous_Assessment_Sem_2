 , Microsoft dwaara iske COM programing model ke liye viksit kiya gaya teesri-peedi kaa event-dryven programing language or integrated deveopment envyranment he
 VB is considered relatively simple in terms of learning and using programming languages, due to its characteristics of graphical development and being a member of the BASIC family
 Visual Basic kii vyutpatti BASIC se hui
 This enables rapid application development of graphical user interfaces, database access and creation of active-x controls and objects through data access objects, remote data objects, or active-x data objects
 scrypting lenguage, jaise ki VBA or vbscript ke sintax to vaise vizual basic ke jaise hi he par unke pradarshan main antar he
 a programmer can assemble an application using the components provided with Visual Basic
 vizual basic main likhe gaye program Windows API kaa bhi prayog kar sakate hai, lekin aisa karne ke liye external function dikaleyareshans kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Its sixth version was finally released in 1998
 Microsoft kaa vistaarit samarthan march 2008 main samaapt ho gaya jiske baad Visual basic
net iskaa namazad uttaradhikari bana
 Visual Basic, like the BASIC programming language, was also designed to be easy to learn and use
 yah language programmeron ko keval saral GUI aplications banane kii kshamta hi pradaan nahin karata balki iske dwaara jatil aplications bhi viksit kiye ja sakate hai
 Programming in VB is a combination of multiple actions
 ye kriyaayein hai: drishy rup se componants yaa controls ko ek form par vyavasthit karnaa, un componants ke atributs or acshans ko nirdhaarit karnaa or functions ke role ko or majboot karne ke liye code kii atirikt line likhnaa
chunki componants ke difolt atributs or acshans paribhaashit rahete hai, isliye programmer ko ek saadhaaran program likhane ke liye kods kii bahut zyada line likhane kii zaroorat nahin hoti
shuruuaati sanskarnon main haalanki pradarshan kshamta se judi samasyaon ko anubhav kiya gaya, lekin zyada tej computaron or netive code compylation kii sahaayta se yah samasya koi badi baat nahin rah gai he
 Although programs from version 5 onwards can be compiled into native code executables, they still require the presence of runtime libraries of approximately 1MB in size
 yah rantime, Windows 2000 or baad ke windos ke sanskarnon main 'bai difolt' shaamil rahata he, lekin 95 / 98 / NT jaise ] ke puraane sanskarnon ke liye iskaa akjicuteble ke saath vitaran karnaa zaruri hota he
 Forms are made using drag-and-drop techniques
 form par controls rakhane ke liye ek upkaran kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Event handlers and attributes are associated with controls
 jab control banaaya jaataa he to iske saath difolt vailu bhi die jate hai, lekin ise programmer ke dwaara badla ja saktaa he
 Many attribute values can be changed during run time, depending on changes in user actions or environments
 udhaaharan ke liye, control kii sthiti main badlaav laane ke liye code ko form risise event handler main daalaa ja saktaa he taaki yah form par kendrit rah sake, form ko bharne ke liye fail sake, ityadi
 code ko text box main kipress ke liye event handler main daalane se program, daale gaye text ke cese ko khud-ba-khud anuvaadit kar saktaa he, yaa yahaan tak ki kuch kairactors ko andar daale jane se bhi roak saktaa he
 Executables, active-x controls, or DLL files can be created from Visual Basic, but are primarily used to design interfaces for Windows applications and database systems
 pop-ap kaaryakshmata pradaan karne ke liye kam kriyasheeltaa vaale dialog box kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Control provides basic functionality of the application while programmers can add more logic to the appropriate event handlers
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek drop-down sangyojan box swatah apni suchi dikhaa detaa he jisase kii yujar kisi bhi element kaa chayan kar saktaa he
 When an item is selected, an event handler is 'called', which then executes the extra code written by the programmer to perform a specific task
 koun sa kaary-vishesh shuru kiya gaya yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki koun se element kaa chayan kiya gaya tha, jaise ki ek sambandhit list ko bharna
 It may also be that a Visual Basic component does not have a user interface, instead it makes active-x objects available to other programs through the component object model
 is visheshta ke kaaran sarwar-said processing yaa ek aid-in modul sambhav ho jaataa he
 It is a garbage collected language in which garbage collection is done by reference counting
 isamen utility objects kii ek vishaal librari hoti he or ek aadharbhoot object oriented saport hota he
 Because default project templates include more common components, programmers rarely need to specify additional libraries
 kai anya programing langwejon se alag, Visual Basic aam taur par 'cese sensetive' nahin hota, haalanki yah kiwards ko ek maanak cese vinyas main parivartit kar detaa he or vairieble nems ke cese ko simbal teble ke andar maujuud entry ke cese ke anuroop bana detaa he
 Comparing by default strings is case sensitive, but it can also be 'case insensitive' at will
 vizual basic compiler ko anya Visual Studio langwejon ke saath share kiya gaya he, lekin IDE main bandhanon ke kaaran kuch 'targats' or threading modells kii rachana sambhav nahin he
 Visual Basic has the following characteristics that are different from languages derived from c -: ! single ke liye, long ke liye &, intiger ke liye %, string ke liye $ or karenci ke liye @), yaa phir kii frej As ke prayog se bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 VB can also be installed in this mode in which only explicitly declared variables can be used with the command Option Explicit
 VB 1
0 kaa anaavaran 1991 main hua tha
 The drag and drop design for the user interface originated from a prototype form generator developed by Alan Cooper and his company Tripod
 Microsoft ne Tripod ko Windows 3
0 ke liye ek programeble form system main viksit karne ke liye kupar evam unke sahyogiyon ke saath ek anubandh kiya
 This was done under the contract code name Ruby
 Tripod main koi bhi programing language sammilit nahin tha
 Microsoft decided to combine Ruby with the Basic Language to create Visual Basic
 Ruby interphes jenerator ne vizual basic kaa "vizual" bhaag pradaan kiya jise "omega" database system jise Microsoft ne chhod diya tha) ke liye dizin kiye gaye "EB" ambeded BASIC eenjan ke saath milaayaa gaya
 Ruby also provided the facility to load dynamic link libraries with additional controls, which later became the VBX interface
 scrypting main prayog karne ke liye Microsoft ne Visual Basic ke vyutpaadon ko viksit kiya he
 Visual Basic itself has been extensively developed from BASIC and has since been replaced with the 
NET Platform version
 kuch vyutpaada language hai: | Microsoft Office]]), and is also included in many third-party products such as solidworks, autocad,], arcgis and Sage Accpac ERP
 jis tarah se VBA ko vibhinn aplications main karyanvit kiya gaya he usamen choti-choti aniyamitataayen hai, lekin vrihad rup se yah VB6 ke jaisi hi language he or samaan rantime librari kaa upyog karti he
 | staroffice Basic]] staroffice is an interpreter included in the suite that is compatible with Visual Basic
 ise ] dwaara viksit kiya gaya he
 Early models of Visual Basic only compiled the code into p-code or Pseudo code
 Visual Basic 5 or 6 donon hi code ko netive yaa p-code main compyle kar sakate hai; yah programmer par nirbhar karata he ki vah code ko kis rup main compyle karnaa chahta he
 The p-code language is interrupted by the runtime, also known as a virtual machine
 virtual mashin ko portability or small code jaise phaaydon ke uddeshy se kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 Nevertheless, one problem with this is that the extra layer of code interpretation by runtime slows down execution
 haalanki kuch code or algoridam banaae ja sakate hai jo compyle kiye gaye netive code se zyada teji se ran kar sakate hai
 Visual Basic applications require the Microsoft Visual Basic runtime msvbvmxx
dll, where xx is the corresponding version number - 50 or 60
 msvbvm50
dll comes standard with Windows in all later versions of Windows 98, while MSVBVM60 
dll comes with all later versions of Windows 95
 haalanki tab bhi, Windows 95 mashin ko us DLL ke instollar ke saath shaamil karne kii zaroorat hoti he, jisaki aavashyaktaa program ko padati thi
 Criticisms of Visual Basic versions prior to VB
NET include: 1
0 se lekar 6
0 tak ke Visual Baisc ke sabhi sanskaran nivrutt ho chuke hai or Microsoft ab unamem se kisi ko saport nahin karata
 Visual Basic 6 programs abhi bhi Vista, ] or Windows 7 tak ke Windows windos ke sanskarnon par ran kar saktaa he or rantime in sanskarnon par Microsoft dwaara saported hai

 Where was Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas? There is a debate among people about this matter 
 lekin khudaai main mili avasheshon ke aadhaar par puratatvavidon kaa ek bada varg yah maanata he ki pandavon kii rajdhani isi sthal par rahi hogi
 Although archaeologists do not have strong evidence for this, the remains of the pottery found during the excavation strengthen the talk of the Pandavas being the capital around the fort
 yahaan khudaai main aise bartanon ke avshesh mili hai, jo mahabharat se jude anya sthanon par bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, the context and ancient traditions related to Mahabharata also indicate that here must have been the capital of the Pandavas
 bharat main bahut kam nagar aise hai, jo dilli kii samaan puraane hon
 According to historians, the old fort was built in the 16th century on the high mound of the site where Indraprastha was inhabited in the pre-historic period

 vahaan unhone samudr jaise gaddhon dwaara ghire hue ek nagar ko banaaya or uski rakshaatmak prachiren banaai
 Scholars believe that the outline of Purana Qila was also similar

 Classic Originally a term used for writers of ancient Greece and Rome and their works, but now, famous, distinguished or distinguished writers of any country and era and their works
 vartmaan arth main is shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog isa kii duusari sadi main roman lekhak oulas gelius ne kiya
 According to him, there are two categories of authors
 1
 clasical scriptor arthath vah jinaki rachana pratham koti kii yaa kirtimansthaapak hoti he or 2
 Prajitarias Scriptor, ie, one whose composition is in the style of the proletariat is of the ordinary category or Kaalsapex
 rome ke chathe raja cervius tulius ne apane sanvaidhanik sudhaaron main sampatti ke adhikaar par rome ke nagarikon ke paanch varg banaae the
 In this class division of Roman society, the most prosperous citizens were called 'classic' and the most destitute and propertyless citizens were called 'pralitari'
 lekhakon kii uparyukt do kotiyon kaa namakaran isi saamaajik vibhaajan ke anukaran ke aadhaar par hua
 In the modern era, the term Kalasik is being used to refer to the distinguished meritorious arts of music, pictures, supplies, movies, etc
 and their compositions
 clasik shabd kii arthsima ko or bhi vistrut kar ab jivan ke kisi kshetra main bhi vishrut yaa sthaayee kirtiman sthapit karne vaale vyakti, uski dakshata, style yaa uplabdhi, anany yaa vikhyath kreedapratiyogitaaon ityadi ko bhi clasik kaha jaataa he

 Was
 is prakaar clasik shabd ke vibhinn sandarbho main vibhinn arth hai
 As far as the literary use of the word classic is concerned, despite being from the West, it is now prevalent in all the languages and literature of the world
 kisi bhi pracheen bhashaa yaa sahitya ko usase prabhavit yaa viksit kisi aadhunik bhashaa yaa sahitya ke sandarbh main ‘clasik’ kaha jaataa he
 Thus Sanskrit is referred to as 'classic' in reference to most Indian languages or literatures, or to the ancient Chinese language and its literature in the context of modern Chinese language and literature
 duusari ore prayek bhashaa ke sahitya kaa kalvibhaajan kuch vishesh saahitiyik mulyon ke aadhaar par ‘clasik’ tathaa anya shabdon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Thus, within Sanskrit and ancient Chinese literature itself are considered 'classic' periods
 saath hi sanskrit ke saapeksh hindi a ‘clasik’ bhashaa or sahitya he, kintu hindu main bhi apana ‘clasik kaal’ he
 Here the term 'classic' and its values are discussed in the context in which they were developed

 Its spread is believed to range from Homer to Justinian

 In the literature of this period, the tendency of imitation and scholarship is more in place of original experiments

 Apollonius Rodeus unsuccessfully tried to keep alive and popularize the tradition of ancient heroism

 After Rome was initiated into Christianity, the literature and culture of cultivated Greece suffered greatly

 Ancient Roman or Latino literature is inferior to ancient Greek literature both in terms of spread and prosperity
 iske bhi teen vibhaajan kiye jate hai : 1
 In the era of the Republic, special work took place in the field of skit, prose poetry

 The content of all these writers was related to the life of Rome, but the form of their works has a profound influence in ancient Greek literature
 2
 augustas kaal laathini sahitya kaa swarnyug mana jaataa he
 The name of Virgil, the greatest poet of Latin poetry, is associated with it
 gaderia jivan sambandhi das kavitaaon, echlogz or greek yoddha is ke jivan par aadhaarit mahakavy, jyorgics ke liye prasiddh he
 His literature has a very mature, refined and coordinated expression of Greek and Roman cultural traditions, the then glory of the Roman Empire and the dream of the rise of a great European civilization

 Livius or Livy is the famous historian of this era

 According to scholars, the classical era of Latin literature actually comes to an end with the Silver Age, as the subsequent lateness of language and sentiment began to decline in the later Latin literature
 duusari sadi ke baad laathini sahitya par isai dharm kii prabhutaa sthapit ho gai
 This literature expresses the intense duality between the ancient Greek and Latin idol and the beliefs of the pagan tradition and Christianity
 is yug ke ullekhneey sahityakaron main taratulian, minusius faliks, laktantiyas, sant jerome, sant agustin, boethium, kasiyadoras, sant bennedikt, gregory mahan, sant isidaar aadi hai

 But from the middle of the 15th century onwards, this process became so rapid and widespread that from here medieval Europe is considered a transition to modernity

 The Renaissance replaced the principle of primitiveness and inferiority as a place of faith in the sanctity of the human body and immense possibilities for the development of the individual
 yah pravriti itani prabal thi ki swayan carch ko iske saath samjhauta karnaa padaa
 According to the French scholar Jasraan, the symbol of this unquestionable triumph of cosmicism and humanism was a bare sculpture of a bronze lady, which was established after the Renaissance itself at the tomb of a pope

 In addition to drawing inspiration from the works of ancient Greek and Latin litterateurs, 16th-century Italian litterateurs accepted the works of Aristotle and Horace, the Poetics and Ars Poetica, as works of poetry
 punarjagran ne hi florence main lorentson medichi ke netritv main nakeelatunavaad ko bhi janm diya, jiskaa gaharaa asar italy or europe ke anya deshon kii premasambandhi kavitaaon par padaa
 Classical Renaissance reached Italy in the 15th-16th century, France and Spain, Germany and England in 16th century by crossing the borders of Italy
 is navjagrati ne roman catholic carch ke antargat europe kii ekasutrata bhangkar in deshon kii nijee pratibha ko unmukt kiya
 That is why each of these countries molded this new consciousness into their own molds
 dharm, samskruti, sahitya, kala, vigyaan, shiksha, sabhi par is jagriti kii chhap padi
 The message of this movement was conveyed by the leaders of Italy to the countries of Europe and the leaders of the countries of Europe reached Italy to receive it
 italy ke leonardo da vinci or alaamanni france or kastiglione spain pahunche
 Great Western religious leaders Luther and brilliant humanitarian Erasmus arrived in Italy from Western Europe
 france ke plaia ke kaviyon, germany ke dharmasudhar andolan, spain kii lirik kavyadhara, england ke elizabethyugin sahitya kii mul prerana yahi navjagriti thi
 The specialty of this renaissance was that while on the one hand he presented his ancient classical ideals, on the other hand, by freeing the consciousness of the person, he also gave him the courage to go into new directions of experimentation and creation
 17veen or 18veen sadiyon main inhen aadarsho ke roodhi ban jane ke baad is rachanaatmak sphurti kaa bhi laap ho gaya
 a new suit was born, called Neoclassicism, by tying the flow of ancient classics to the pool of customs
 aksar ‘classisism’ or ‘nio-classisism’ paryaay ke rup main prayukt hote hai, kintu puraane clasikon ke adarsh or vaad main bandha jane ke baad classisism yaa nio-classisism ke aadarsho ke bhed ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The main role in establishing Neo-classicism in Europe was the 17th century French litterateurs and critics, who rigorously arranged and often inanimate mannerism by the 16th century Italian critics on the principles of ancient Greek and Roman litterateurs like Aristotle, Horace, etc
 Gave the form of french aalochanashasthri pracheen greek or roman chintakon ke paas sidhe na pahunchakar apni ruchi ke italvi aalochanashastriyon ke madhyam se pahunche, jiske falswaroop unhone kaaphi svachhndatha ke saath pracheen clasico, visheshat: arestu ke siddhanton par apni reeti-ariti aropit kar di
 In criticism, the first important propagandist of this formalism was Mallarb
 1630 se 1660 ke bich is ritivaad kaa prasar or bhi hua
 The work was carried out by Shaplain, Boylo, Rapun, Le Bosso, etc
 and was inspired and supported by the French Academy, decarte's Rationalism and the Catholic Church, established under the patronage of Louis's court
 nio-clasical aalochanashastra kaa dhyaan kavita, jisamen mahakavy or du:khant tathaa sukhaant roopak bhi shaamil the, kii ore ho gaya
 He had some simple principles, eg, poetry aims at moral education more than entertainment; Knowledge of poetry or ritual is more important than talent; Riti means imitation of Kalasikas: 'truth' is paramount in the object of poetry and Truth means universal truth felt by human beings; And in place of imagination, there should be intellectual restraint and balance; There should be clarity and brevity in the expression; There should be proper maintenance of order, compliance and balance in the composition
 sankshep main, in saadhaaran niyamon kii teen dhuriyaan thi, buddhi, nir-ksheer-vivek or kalatmak abhiruchi
 As far as poetic forms were concerned, according to the neo-classical Criticists, the elders had decided the subject, goals, effects and styles of each form
 isi aadhaar par unhone mahakavy or sukhaant naatakon ke rachanavidhan ko reetibaddh kiya
 He condemned the blending of the elements of misery in farce and farce and considered the central principle of the design of metaphor to be the connotation of time, country and event
 nio-clasical siddhanton kaa gaharaa asar tatkaaleen europea sahitya par padaa kyonki 14wein lui kaa france europe kaa saanskrithik centre tha
 18th-century English literature is a reflection of Neo-classical ideals
 spasht he ki pracheen greek or laathini clasikon or renesaan ke unke anuyaayiyon ko nio-clasical sahityakaron se ek nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the one hand there is exploration or tradition-oriented exploration, on the other hand, the attempt to convert the achievement of this investigation into stereotypes
 tii
 es
 eliyat ne virgil par likhe gaye apane lekh ‘hwatiz clasik’ main classisijia kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh kiya he ve sankshipt rup main is prakaar hai : chintan or lokvyavahaar kii praudhata kii abhivyakti, itihaas, parampara or saamaajik niyati kaa bodh, bhashaa yaa style main saadhaaraneekaran, drushtikon kii udaar or vyapak grahanshiltaa, saarvbhaumikta
 The ancient classics performed their work with reference to the great traditions of literature, social life and contemplation
 nio-clasical sahityakaron main bhi yah bodh tha, kintu unke saamne ye mahan sandarbh nahin the
 Neo-classicalism is the product of an era when society goes through a period of development and becomes inertia, when it stops at the end of a closed street
 aise samay sahitya main vastu kaa sthaan gaun or rup kaa sthaan pradhan ho jaataa he
 It is a very fertile land of orthodoxy in Rupashakti literature
 yah ashyarch kii baat nahin ki pashchimi europe ke saanskrithik sankat ke is yug main angreji or anya sahitya main nia-classisism kaa punaruddhar hua
 Ezra Pound, the famous originator and theorist of modern English poetry, T
 E
 Hulsh and T
S
 Elliot attached more importance to 18th-century neo-classical English poetry than the Romantic literature developed on the basis of Renaissance's humanist tradition
 hulsh ke anusaar ‘manushya asaadhaaran rup se sthit or simit jeevadharee he, jisaki prakruti sarvatha aparivartaneey he
 Only through tradition and organization can a good thing be made in its hands'
 ‘manushya anant sambhaavnaaon kaa strot he’
 Describing this Romantic faith as mental illness and hence, he says: 'I predict that the era of dry, hard, classical poetry is coming'
 jisamen kalpana se adhik mahatv chitrakaushal kaa hoga
 Thus, the struggle of Romanticism and Classicism is not only a literary struggle but also a struggle of progress and stereotypes towards political and cultural values
 ‘clasik’ kii rudh paribhaasha ke antargat unani or roman sahitya or unke pariprekshya main europea sahitya kii hi charchaa upar kii gai he
 In the context of the above literature, Hume raised the question that Homer was read Rome and Athens a thousand-two thousand years ago and is still read in London and Paris
 anek vibhinnataaon or parivartanon ke hote hue bhi aaj tak unka mahatv bana hua he iskaa kya kaaran he? is prashn ke uttar main yah anubhav kiya gaya ki jo sahitya kaal kii kasuti par khara utre vahi ‘clasik' he
 Therefore, it is now being understood that classic literature is one in which those elements of life must be definitely included, whose utility and meaning are indispensable for every era and country
 bhartiya sahitya ko ‘clasik’ kii isi paribhaasha kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 From this point of view, Ramayana and Mahabharata fall into the ranks of the classic
 sanskrit ke anek kaavyon or mahakavyon kii gananaa uske antargat kii ja sakati he
 Kalidasa's overall literature is classic in itself but 'raghuvansh' and 'abhigyan Shakutnal' are paramount
 hindi kaa saahitiyik itihaas abhi kuch hi sau barason kaa he
 In the meantime, the type of literature that was composed mostly adopted the same focal points of Sanskrit literature, which are called rasa, sound, curvature, ritual and ornamentation
 is kaal ke lekhakon ke preranarot the sanskrit ke hrasonmukh saahitiyik acharya
 Therefore, in that period there is not much that can be called a classic
 akele tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas ko is koti main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered a classic of the works of Sur and Jayasi

 This period is called 'neo-colonialism'

 Despite the tremendous political and economic competition among the European empires in the last part of the 19th century, Africa was divided peacefully and this partition also saved them from going to war

 The important work of Partition was executed very quickly
 yadhyapi vibhajankarta vibhinn rashtron main aapas main anek mataantar the kintu phir bhi bina koi yuddh lade is kaary ko shantipurna dhang se purna kar liya gaya
 The vast continent of Africa was known as the 'dark continent' before the 19th century
 europe ke atyant sameep hone ke baad bhi europavasi iske sambandh main koi gyaan nahin rakhte the or yadi koi desh africa ke sambandh main kuch jaankaree rakhte bhi the to vah na ke baraabar hi thi
 Until this time people were not aware of the internal prosperity of the continent of Africa
 vyapaaree-varg bhi is mahadweep ke sambandh main keval itnaa hi jaanate the ki ve yahaan se habshiyon ko pakadakar le jate the or daason ke rup main unhen america kisaanon ko bech dete the
 Gradually this situation began to change and the people of Europe started getting attracted towards the continent of Africa, for which the following reasons and circumstances were responsible: sarvapratham 1876 i

 Its purpose was to consider the importance of Africa and to form the African Conference

 africa main belgium ke badhate hue prabhaav ko dekhakar europe ke anya deshon ne bhi africa main apane-apane upnivesh sthapit karne ke prayaas karne prarambh kar diye
 Countries such as England, France, Germany and Italy declared that their entry into Africa was the main purpose of their entry into Africa to civilize the uncultured masses and propagate Christianity
 is prakaar apratyaksh rup se europe ke vibhinn rajyon ne africa kii lut ke kaary ko prarambh kiya
 Each of the nations of Europe wanted to establish their colonies in Africa, so differences of opinion arose between them
 antatah berlin main ek anterrashtriya sammelan bulaayaa gaya jisamen vibhinn deshon kii matantaron ko dur kiya gaya evam germany, england or france ke seemaa sambandhi vivaadon kaa sulajhaava kiya gaya
 The above mentioned countries also signed a new treaty on this occasion in 1890 AD
 berlin ke is sammelan main africa ke saanskrithik vikaas ke prashn par bhi vichaar-vimarsh hua
 Many restrictions were also imposed on the trade of arms and liquor, but soon the Africans started being heavily exploited in the Congo
 berlin ke is mahatvapurn sammelan main switzraland ke atirikt europe ke sabhi deshon or america ne bhi bhaag liya or yah sammelan navambar 1884 se farvari 1885 tak chalaa
 England benefited the most from the plunder of Africa

 Napoleon established his control of Egypt in 1798, but after his defeat in the Battle of the Nile, his influence there ended and England gained dominance over Egypt
 misr kaa england ke liye vishesh mahatv tha kyonki misr par kisi anya desh kaa prabhutv sthapit hone se uske bharat sthit samrajya ko khatra utpann ho jaataa tha

 But in 1879, the British attacked the Transvaal, due to which the relations between the British and the Boer caste became strained and the flame of the war was kindled
 is yuddh main angrejon ko paraajay kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or biiron kii swatantraaa ko sabhi logon ne sweekaar kar liya tathaa transwaal ko swatantra ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In 1881, some gold mines were discovered in Transvaal due to which the British started to enter the Transvaal and at some places their number exceeded the original Boars, it threatened the security of the Boars
 
 boar angrejon se ghrinaa karte the or unhen 'videshi' kahkar pukaarte the
 The main leader of these foreigners was Cecil Rhodes
 vah dakshini africa main british shashan kii sthapana par vishesh bal de rahaa tha or thode samay main hi usne africa ke bahut bade bhaag par adhikaar kar liya, jo rhodesia kahalaaya
 He was elected Prime Minister of Cape Colony in 1890 AD and remained in the post until 1896 AD
 uski yah bhi dhaaran thi ki angrejon ko transwaal tathaa orenj free state par bhi adhikaar sthapit kar lenaa chahie
 England was also waiting for an opportunity to avenge their defeat against the Boers
 1899 i
 main usne orenj free state va transwaal ke viruddh yuddh prarambh kar diya
 In the initial war, the Boars achieved some success, but for a long time they could not succeed in maintaining their conquest and were ultimately defeated

 main donon ke madhya ek sandhi ho gayi jiske anusaar transwaal tathaa orenj free state par angrejon ke adhikaar ko sweekaar kar liya gaya
 After this treaty, many facilities were provided to the Boers but even after this their dissatisfaction did not end

 France wanted to establish its control over important territories of Africa, such as Egypt, Algeria, Tunis and Morocco, but England opposed it and did not allow its authority to be established over Egypt, as Egypt was of great importance to England's empire in India

 kintu dhire-dhire france ne dakshin africa ke kai mahatvapurn upniveshon par adhikaar sthapit kar liya
 After taking over Algeria in 1847, France had its eyes on the territory of Tunis, which was located in the east of Algeria
 italy bhi tunis ke pradesh kii ore laalchee ankhon se nihaar rahaa tha, kintu france ne 1881 i

 Bismarck continued to serve as Chancellor in Germany from 1870–1890 AD
 apane pradhanmantri-kaal ke praarambhik varshon main vah upnivesh-sthapana kaa ghor virdohi tha kyonki vah england ke saath apane sambandhon ko kharaab karnaa nahin chahta tha
 England considered every country that participated in the colonial race and tried to expand its water power
 bismark germany ko ek aatm-santusht desh kaha karata tha kintu baad main nimnlikhit kaarnon se prerit hokar usne upnivesh-sthapana kii ore dhyaan dena prarambh kar diya tha : The famous historian Gooch has written in this context that the plunder of Africa had greatly increased the hunger for colonization of Germany, and Bismarck eventually had to quell this hunger
 aupniveshik daud main vilamb se bhaag lene ke kaaran bismark africa kii lut main samay par sammilit nahin ho sakaa lekin phir bhi 1884 i
 se 1890 i
 tak usne togoland, camerun, purvi africa or dakshin-pashchim africa main kuch upnivesh sthapit kiye
 Thus even a skilled politician like Bismarck could not avoid the call of the times and he too had to take part in the race for colonization, which he was initially a great opponent of
 spain ne africa ke dakshin-pashchimi samudr-tat par apane kuch upnivesh sthapit kiye
 In 1908, he also established his authority over some territories opposite the island of Gibraltar
 italy tunis ke pradesh par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha, parantu france dwaara vahaan apana aadhipaty sthapit kar liye jane ke kaaran usne 1883 i

 Later, Portugal established its dominance over Mozambique, which the Portuguese called 'east Africa'
 is prakaar europe kii mahashaktiyon ne sampoorn africa kaa aapas main vibhaajan kar liya
 The most important part of the partition was that this work was executed in a very peaceful manner
 yadhyapi kai avasaron par katutaa bad jane ke kaaran yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen atyadhik bad gayin kintu vaartalap or kootneeti ke dwaara matantaron ko shantipurna dhang se hal kar diya gaya

 For example, when searching for less, it will also search for the lotus and also the waist
 regular oxpraishan ko regex yaa regexp ke rup main sankshepit kiya jaataa he
 It is possible to use regular expressions in many programming languages, using it, a very big thing can be said or written in a single line, which makes the program small and legible
 jo programmer nahin hai unke liye yah 'find and riples' ke rup main iskaa bahut upyog he
 The following examples illustrate some features that can be expressed in regular expressions: regular oxpraishan in udaahranon se bhi adhik jatil ho sakate hai:regular oxpraishan ke prayog kai paath sampadakon dwaara upyogita evam bhashaaon kii programing main pattern par aadhaarit mul paath kii khoj or usamen manachaahe badlaav ke liye kiya gaye hai
 For example, Perl, Ruby and Tcl have strong regular expression engines built into their syntax
 Unix vitaranon ke dwaara pradutt anek upyogitaayen -- sampadak ed evam filter grep—regular oxpraishan kii avadharana ko lokapriy banane main sarvapratham the
 As an example of syntax, regular expressions \ bex can be used to search for all instances of the "ex" string that come after "word boundaries"
 alpagyon kii shabdaawalee main, \ bex apane se miltaa julata string "ex" ko do sambhavit kshetron main khoj legaa, shabdon ke aarambh main or ek string main do varnon ke bich main, jisamen se ek to shabd varna he or doosraa shabd varna nahin he
 Thus, "texts for experts" in the string corresponds with "ex" in \ bex "experts", but does not match in "texts"

 Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based internal queries, most search engines do not provide regex support to people
 One notable exception is Google Code Search
 regular oxpraishan, jise praayah pattern bhi kaha jaataa he, ek aisa suchak he jo strings ke ek set ke bare main vistaar se batalaata he
 They are usually used to summarize sets without creating a list of elements
 udhaaharan ke liye, 'set' jisamen teen strings hote hai "handel ", "händel " or "haendel " ko h ndel ke pattern ke rup main varnit kiya ja saktaa he 
 adhiktar akaarawadon main agar koi rijex kisi khaas set ke saath mail khaataa he to yah jaan lenaa chahie ki aise suchakon kii anant sankhya he
 Most formalisms form regular expressions for the following verbs
 |grey ke saath "gray " yaa "grey " mail khaataa he
 | gray and gry are identical patterns that describe both "gray" and "gray" sets
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab*c "ac ", "abc ", "abbc ", "abbbc " or isi prakaar se mail khaataa he
 These textures can be arbitrarily joined together to form complex indexes, just as one can construct arithmetic indicators from numbers and operations +, -, × and ÷
 udhaaharan ke liye, Hndel evam Hndel donon hi pramanik pattern hai, jo pichley udhaaharan kii hi tah samaan strings ke saath mail khaataa he, vah pichhlaa udhaaharan he Hndel
 The exact syntax for regular expressions varies with tools and context; More details are given in the "syntax" section

 Perl and Tcl regular expressions were derived from the Regex library written by Henry Spencer, although Perl was broadcast to add several new features to Spencer's library

 Part of the design philosophy of Perl 6 is to improve the integration of Perl's regular expressions and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the grammar of the phrase's terminology to be defined
 The result was a short language Perl 6 rule, which is used to define the Perl 6 grammar as well as to provide tools for programmers in the language

 The use of regular expressions in structured information standards for document and database modeling began in the 1960s and spread to the 1980s, when ISO SGML industry standards were consolidated
 At the heart of the structure's clarity in language standards is regular expressions

 Pattern Matching: See also History regular oxpraishan ko aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Regular expressions have constants and operators, which respectively indicate the sets of strings that act upon these sets
 nimnlikhit paribhaasha maanak he or aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant kii adhikansh paathya pustakon main paayi jaati he
 ek seemaabaddh varnmaala σ ko dekhte hue nimnlikhit sthiraankon kii paribhaasha di gai he: The following operations are defined: | α in r and β in s } ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} {"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s jo r or s ke gathbandhan ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} | {"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}
 koshthkon se bachane ke liye yah maan liya gaya he ki clin tara ko hi sarvocch praathamikta praapt he or iske baad sangyojan or tab jaakar set gathbandhan ko
 agar koi sanshay nahin he to koshthkon kaa lop ho saktaa he
 For example, c can be written as abc and a |) as a | bc *
 kai paathya pustakon main lamberup baar ke badale sangyojan ke liye ∪, +, yaa ∨ chihnon kaa prayog miltaa he
 Examples: |b* {ε, {0}a, b, bb, bbb, 


} ko sanketit karata he
 | b) * Empty string: {ε, {0} denotes a set of all strings with no symbols other than a and b, including a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, 


}
 |ε) a se aarambh kar strings ke set ko, tab jiro athwa adhik b s or ant main vikalp ke saath a c : {{0}a, ac, ab, abc, abb, abbc, 


} ko sanketit karata he
 Is the formal definition of regular expression intentionally economical and unnecessary quantifier? To avoid and +, which can be expressed as: a + = aa * and a? =

 As a rule, the complement operator is unnecessary, as can be limited by using other operators

 In this sense, regular expressions can denote well-organized language, precisely the category of language accepted by regular finite automata
 haalanki phir bhi susanhati main ek ullekhneey antar he
 Some categories of well-organized languages can be described by regular finite automata, whose size exponentially increases to the smallest regular expression
 bhashaaen hi yahaan maanak udhaaharan hai
 The Lk character {{0} a, b} whose last letter is equal to ka with all its strings
 ek ore, l 4 ko varnit karne vaale regular oxpraishan ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^{*}a} diya hua he
 This pattern gives the normalization indicator in Lk duusari ore, yah vidit he ki Lk bhashaa ko sweekaar karata hua niatatmak parimit autometon ke paas kai sthitiyon main kam se kam 2k ke hona jaruri he
 Fortunately, more common than regular expressions is simple mapping from non-finite to finite automata, which does not suddenly assume such a large explosive size; This is why nfas are often used as alternative representations of well-organized languages

 Finally, it is worth noting that many regular expression engines in the world apply features that cannot be described in terms of formal language theory by regular expression; See below for more information on this subject
 jaisaa ki udaahranon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he, vibhinn regular oxpraishan usee bhashaa ko abhivyakt kar sakate hai: ritivaad anaavashyak he
 It is possible to write in the algorithm between the given regular expressions to decide whether the mentioned languages are essentially the same
 This reduces each expression to the extent of the minimum deterministic finite state machine and determines whether they are homogeneous equivalents
 is anaavashyaktaa ko kis had tak nikaal diya ja saktaa he? kya ham regular oxpraishan kaa ek rochak subset khoj sakate hai jo puri tarah suchak ho? clin tara or set kaa gathbandhan spashtatah aavashyak he, lekin shaayad ham unke prayog par roak laga sakate hai
 This can turn into a surprisingly difficult problem

 Recently, regular expressions in Dexter Kozen were self-certified with Clean Algebra
 paaramparik Unix regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas ne aam paripati kaa anusaran nahin kiya, lekin ek upkaran se duusare upkaran main aksar antar rahata tha
 The IEEE POSIX Basic Regular Expression Standard was designed specifically for inverse compatibility with traditional syntax, but it provided a common standard that has been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression devices, although It still often has some variations or additional features
 aise anek upkaran hai jo cmand line vishyon ke saath ERE vaakya-vinyas ko sahaara dete hai
 In the BRE syntax, most of the letters are taken in a literal sense - they match each other
 The exceptions listed below are called beyond characters or separated by sequences
 udhaaharan: Beyond letters means the opposite of syntax of POSIX extended regular expressions for some letters, avoiding the backslash
 is vaakya-vinyas main hi, ek bekaslash ke kaaran meta kairactor ko shabdic aksharon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 So for example, \ is now and \ { \ } is now {}
 Also, \ n has been omitted for previous references and is included beyond the following letters: udhaaharan: | dog corresponds with "cat" or "dog"
 POSIX vistaarit regular oxpraishan kaa prayog aksar aadhunik Unix prayojyata ke saath cmand line flag -E ko shaamil kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Since many categorized categories of characters are selected local settings, some of the POSIX standard letter categories or categories are shown in the following table: POSIX aksharon kii shreniyon kaa prayog keval koshthak suchakon ke andar hi ho saktaa he
 For example, ab] corresponds only to upper case capital letters and lowercase letters "a" and "b"

 An additional non-posix range understood by some devices is that typically defined by a plus underline underscore

 Editor Vim further identifies the distinction between the Word and Word-head categories
 Since characters in many programming languages that can begin as an identification mark are not the same as those that may be present in other positions

 Character classes with most other regular expression flavors are used to describe POSIX defined parenthesis indicators
 POSIX basic or vistaarit regular oxpraishan maanakon kii tulana main Perl ke paas adhik susangat or samrudh vaakya-vinyas he
 An example of its continuity is that \ always runs separately from non-alphanumeric characters

 Because of its widely suggestive capabilities, many other usability and programming languages have adopted syntax like Perl - for example, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework, and w3c's XML
 Schema uses all regular expression syntax like Perl
