 The mathematics of most daily life is the essence of these basic concepts and hence it can be easily understood
 haalanki adhikansh dharanaen ant:pragna ke dwaara hi ham par prakat hoti he, phir bhi shuddh evam sankshep rup main un dharanaon ko vyakt karne ke liye uchit shabdaawalee evam kuch niyamon or pratikon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, mathematics has its own language and script which is necessary to know and understand first
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki dainik jivan se asambaddhit maanakar ise samajhane kii drushti se kathin mana jaataa he, jabaki hakeekat main yah vaastavik jivan ke saath abhinn rup se judaa hi nahin he, balki usee se isaki utpatti bhi hui he
 It is ironic that most people shy away from mathematics by showing disinterest, while the fact is that it has utility in every sphere of life and knowledge
 yah keval sanyog nahin he ki archimedes, newton, gaus or lagranj jaise mahaan vaigyanikon ke vigyaan ke saath-saath ganit main bhi apana mahaan yogadan diya he
 At present, mathematics is broadly divided into two parts: vigyaan, arthshaastra or anya kai kshetron main prayog kiya jane vaala ganit praayogic ganit he or isamen adhyayan kii jane vaali ganitiya samasyaon kaa strot kisi or kshetra main hota he
 Under this, mechanics, landlessness, earth science, astrology etc
 are subjects
 shuddh ganit swayan ganit main upji un samasyaon kaa hal dhundta he jinka anya kshetron se sidhaa sambandh nahin he
 Many times applications of pure mathematics are found over time and thus some part of it comes in experimental mathematics
 shuddh ganit ke antargat, bijganit, jyamiti or sankhya siddhant aadi aate hai
 The well-known theorem of Pharma is a part of the number theory
 shuddh ganit kaa vikaas beesvin shatabdi main bahut adhik hua or iske vikaas main 1900 main david hilbert ke dwaara paris main diye gayi vyaakhyaan kaa bahut yogadan rahaa

 The motivations of the creation of these war poems were the same events in the history of the Baloch caste that took place in that period; Such as the 30-year struggle of the Rind and lashari tribes, the vivid tale of the immortal love of Hani-shah Murid, Beberg and Giranaz and narratives, the antics of Shahdad and Mahnaz, the valor and courage of Shahdad and his followers in the Battle of Panipat because of Humayun's friendship , The war against Beberg Pusser for the singularity of Jusur and Ghayur Balach and other similar incidents gave rise to such high-quality war poetry

 At the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, the British did not just take a new regime with them in Balochistan, but they laid the foundation of a new civilization in the land of mountains, deserts and valleys

 Before and after the British left India in 1947, there was tremendous pressure on the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir to merge into one of the newly created two nations
 bharat ke batwaare par hue samjhaute ke dastavej ke anusaar riyasto ke raajaaon ko dono main se ek raashtra ko chunane kaa adhikaar tha parantu kashmir ke maharaja hari sih apni riyasat ko swatantra rakhana chaahate the or unhone kisi bhi raashtra se judane se bachanaa chaha
 After the British left India, the princely state was attacked by Pakistani soldiers and Pashtuno tribal fighters
 is bhay se ki riyasat kii fuj inkaa saamana nahin kar paayegi maharaja ne bharat se sainik sahaayta maangi
 India laid the condition for Kashmir's accession to India in lieu of military aid
 maharaja ke hami bharne par bharat ne is vilay ko manyata de di or riyasat ko jammu kashmir ke naam se nayaa rajya bana diya
 Indian Army contingents were immediately deployed to protect the state
 kintu is vilay kii vaidhata par pakistan asahmat tha
 Since caste-based figures were not available, it was difficult to determine the reasons behind Maharaj's accession to India
 pakistan kii yah daleel thi ki maharaja ko bhartiya sena bulaane kaa adhikaar nahin tha kyonki angrejo ke aane ke pehle kashmir ke maharaja kaa koi pad nahin tha or yah pad keval angrejo kii niyukti thi
 So Pakistan decided to go to war but its army chief Douglas Gracie refused to accept the Pakistani Prime Minister's order to this effect
 unka tark yah tha ki kashmir par kabja kar rahi bhartiya senaayen british rajasatta kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahi hai atah vah usase yuddh nahin kar sakate
 However, Pakistan later sent forces, but by then India had occupied almost two Tihai Kashmir

 Initially, the army of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state was not ready for the initial attacks of tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir, it was deployed only in small numbers to guard the border, so their defense system collapsed immediately in front of the attack and some of their The troops met the enemies
 aaazaad kashmir ke kabeelai ladaake shuruwati aasaan safaltaaon ke baad lutpaat main vyast hry gayi or unhone aage bad aasaani se kabje main aa sakane vaale naye ilaako par hamalaa karne main der kar di or maharaja kae bharat main vilay main sahamati dete hi bhartiya sena ko vimaano kii madad se sainik pahuchane kaa mauka de diya
 By the end of 1947, the Pakistani campaign to capture Kashmir had evaporated
 keval himalay ke upari hisso main aaazaad kashmir naam kii pakistani sena ko kuch safaltaayen mili par aakhir main unhe leh ke bahari hisse se june unniis sau adtalis main waapas khaded diya gaya
 Throughout 1948, there were many minor battles between the two sides, but no one got any significant strategic success and gradually a border which is now known as the Line of Control was established
 31 disambar 1948 main aupchaarik yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa ho gayi
 This war can be divided into ten parts
 yah bhaag is prakaar se hai
 The main objective of the initial attack was to take control of the Kashmir Valley and its major city Srinagar
 jammu or kashmir riyasat kii greeshmakaleen rajdhani srinagar or sheetakaaleen rajdhani jammu thi
 The princely forces stationed at Muzaffarabad and Domel were immediately defeated by a Pakistani army called Azad Kashmir Army and the road to Srinagar was opened
 riyasat kii sena ke punah sangathit hone ke pehle srinagar par kabja karne ke bajaay aaazaad kashmir sena seemaant shahro par kabja karne or uske nivaasiyon se lutpaat evam anya atyaachaar karne main jute gayi
 In Poonch valley, the princely armies retreated and concentrated in the cities, and after several months they were freed from captive Indian Army encirclement
 jammu or kashmir riyasat ke bharat se vilay ke baad bharat ne vimaan ke dwaara sainik or upkaran srinagar pahunchaaye
 Upon reaching there, he strengthened the princely army and built a security cordon around Srinagar and defeated the Azad Kashmir Army
 is suraksha ghere main bhartiya sena ke bakhtarband vahno ke dwaara virodhiyo ko peeche se gherna bhi shaamil tha
 After defeating the retreating Pakistani army from Baramulla and Uri, both these cities were liberated, although the encirclement of the cities continued by the Pakistani army in the Poonch Valley
 gilgit main aaazaad kashmir kii kabeelai sena main gilgit rajya ke ardh sainik bal shaamil ho gayi or chitral ke mehtar jagirdaar kii sena bhi apane jagirdaar ke pakistan main vilay kii ghoshnaa ke baad usame shaamil ho gayi The Indian Army ceased to chase Azad Kashmir's army after the capture of Uri and Baramulla and sent an aid force in an attempt to break the encirclement of Poonch in the south direction
 haalanki sahaayta tukdi poonch pahuch gayi par vah gheraabandi nahin tod paayi or vah bhi funs gayi
 a second support unit reached Kotli but had to retreat leaving the barricade of Apna Kotli, in the meantime, Mirpur was captured by the army of Azad Kashmir
 pakistan / aaazaad kashmir kii sena ne jhanger par kabja kar liya tatpashchaat usne naushera par nakaam hamalaa kiya
 Other contingents of Pakistan / Azad Kashmir army continued unsuccessful attacks on Uri
 duusari ore bharat ne ek chote se akraman se chhmb par kabja bana liya
 By this time, additional military forces were available with the Indian Army, in which situation on the Line of Control began to stabilize
 bhartiya sena balon ne jhanger or rajori par pratiakraman kar ke unhe kabje main le liya
 The Azad Kashmir Army in the Kashmir Valley continued to attack the security apparatus of Uri
 aaazaad kashmir sena ne uttar main scardu kii gheraa bandi kar di
 Despite numerous counter-offensives by the army of Azad Kashmir, the Indians kept control of Jhanger, although now the army of Azad Kashmir was getting more and more help from regular Pakistani soldiers
 kashmir ghati main bharatiyo ne akraman kar tidhwal par kabja kar liya
 The army of Azad Kashmir was getting a good boost in the high Himalayan regions
 unhone tukadiyo kii ghuspaith kar ke kargil par gheraabandi kar di tathaa scardu kii madad ke liye ja rahe bhartiya sainya daston ko haraa diya
 The Indian Army Ballo continued the attack in the Kashmir valley and proceeded northward and captured Keran and Gurais
 unhone tidhwal par kiye gayi ek pratiakarman ko waapas khaded diya
 The Indian contingent at Poonch in the Poonch Valley broke the siege and joined it briefly for the outside world
 lambey samay se fasee kashmir riyasat kii tukdi gilgit scout se scardu kii raksha karne main ab tak safal thi is liye pakistani sena leh kii ore nahin batch paa rahi thi
 In August, Chitral's army attacked Skardu under the leadership of mata-ul-mulk and captured Skardu with the help of artillery
 isse gilgit scout ladakh kii ore aage jane kaa mauka mil gaya
 During this time the Line of Control was being established and the defense of the areas under its control on both sides was more important than attacking
 is dauraan keval ek mahatvapurn abhiyaan chalaaya gaya yah tha abhiyaan dak jo ki bhartiya balo dwaara draas ke kabje ke liye tha is dauraan poonch par gheraabandi jari rahi
 Now the Indian Army was heavily dependent on the Pakistani Army and its supported Azad Kashmir Army on all fields
 poonch ko ek saal lambii gheraabandi se aaazaad kara liya gaya tha or gilgit scout jo ki ab tak acchhee kamyaabi hasil kar rahi thi use use aakhirkaar haraakar uskaa peechha karte hue bhartiya sena ne kargil ko aaazaad kara liya par aage hamalaa karne ke liye bhartiya sena ko rasad kii aapurti kii samasya aa sakati thi atah unhe ruknaa padaa jojila darre ko tanks kii madad se kabje main le liya gaya pakistani sena tanks kii apeksha nahin kar rahi thi or unke turant paanv ukhd gayi
 The use of the tank was possible only due to the experience gained from the Burma War
 is darre par kabje ke baad draas par aasaani se kabja ho gaya
 On reaching this phase of the fight, the Indian Prime Minister made up his mind to take the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and get the matter resolved by him
 31 disambar 1948 ko sanyukt raashtra ke dwaara yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 a few days before the ceasefire, the Pakistani army broke the road contact between the two by conducting a counter-offensive and seizing the route between Uri and Poonch
 ek lambey molbhav ke baad dono paksh yudhviram par raji ho gayi
 The terms of this ceasefire were adopted by the United Nations on August 13, 1948
 isame pakistan ko apane niyamit or aniyamit sanico ko puri tarah se hataane or bharat ko rajya main kanoon vyavastha lagu karne ke liye aavashyak sainik rakhane kaa prastaav tha
 Upon the fulfillment of this condition a referendum would determine the future and ownership of the state
 is yuddh main dono paksho ke lagbhag 15-15 sau sainik maare jane kaa anumaan he
 And after this war, sixty percent of the princely state of India and 40 percent of the territory of Pakistan occupied
 is yuddh ke do charano main bakhtarband vaahan or halke tanko kaa prayog atyant mahatvapurn tha in dono main hi bahut hi kam sankhya main inkaa prayog hua tha
 These stages were yah ghatnaayen yah bataati hai ki asambhavit jagaho par bakhtarband vahno ke hamale kaa dushman par maansik dabaav padataa he
 It may also happen that the attackers did not use anti-tactic weapons, perhaps they did not leave them behind
 bakhtarband vahno ke prayog kii safalataa ne bharat kii yuddh niti par gahari chhap chodi china ke saath yuddh ke vakt bharatiyo ne badi mehnat se durgam ilaako main bakhtarband vahno kaa prayog kiya kintu us yuddh main bakhtar band vahno ko apekshit safalataa nahin mili
 If we study the changes in the boundary line, then some interesting facts emerge
 ek baar senaaon kaa jamaavada puraa hone ke baad niyantran rekha main badlaav behad dhimaa ho gaya or vijay keval un ilaakon tak simit ho gayi jiname sainik ghanatv kam tha jaise kii uttari himalay ke unche ilaake jiname shruwaat main aaazaad kashmir kii sena ko safaltaaen mili thi
 In 1948, Pakistan invaded Kashmir and captured a third of it
 abhi tak yah ek tihaai bhaag pakistan ke paas he
