 Once, due to the fear of austerity, Shri Krishna started living in the middle of the sea

 Satrajit, who lived in Dwarikapuri, worshiped Suryanarayana
 tab bhagwaan surya ne use nity aath bhaar sona dene vaali syamantak naamak mani apane gale se utarkar de di
 Shrikrishna expressed his desire to get that gem when he got into the society after getting a gem
 satrajit ne vah mani shrikrishna ko na dekar apane bhai prasenjit ko de di
 One day, he went on a hunting horse and went for hunting
 vahaan ek sher ne use maar daalaa or mani le lee
 The king of bears, Jamwant, killed the lion and went to the cave with a gem
 jab prasenjit kai dinon tak shikaar se na lautaa to satrajit ko bada dukh hua
 He thought, Sri Krishna must have killed him to get the gem
 atah bina kisi prakaar kii jaankaree jutaaye usne prachaar kar diya ki shrikrishna ne prasenjit ko markar syamantak mani chin lee he
 Srikrishna along with many people went to the forest to find Prasenjit to stop this public blasphemy
 vahaan par prasenjit ko sher dwaara maar daalana or sher ko rich dwaara maarane ke chihn unhen mil gaye
 While searching for bear's feet, they reached the cave of Jamawant and went inside the cave
 vahaan unhone dekha ki jamvant kii putree us mani se khel rahi he
 Jamwant was ready for war upon seeing Krishna
 yuddh chhid gaya
 Outside the cave, Sri Krishna's companions waited for him for seven days
 phir ve log unhen mar gaya jaanakar pashchaatap karte hue dwarikapuri laut gaye
 Here, even after fighting continuously for twenty-one days, Jamwant could not defeat Shri Krishna
 tab usne sochaa, kahin yah vah avatar to nahin jiske liye mujhe ramchandraji kaa vardaan mila tha
 On getting this confirmation, he married his daughter to Sri Krishna and gave Mani in dowry
 shrikrishna jab mani lekar waapas aae to satrajit apane kiye par bahut lajjit hua
 To get rid of this shame, he also married his daughter to Shri Krishna
 kuch samay ke baad shrikrishna kisi kaam se indraprastha chale gaye
 Then with the opinion of Akrur and Ritu Verma, Shatdhanva killed Mani and took Mani in his possession
 satrajit kii maut kaa samachar jab shrikrishna ko mila tove tatkaal dwarika pahunche
 They agreed to kill Shatdhanva and snatch the gem
 is kaary main sahaayta ke liye balram bhi taiyaar the
 Knowing this, Shatdhanva gave Mani to Akrur and escaped on her own
 shrikrishna ne uskaa peechha karke use maar to daalaa, par mani unhen nahin mil pai
 Balramji also reached there
 shrikrishna ne unhen bataaya ki mani iske paas nahin he
 Balaramji did not believe
 ve aprasann hokar vidarbha chale gaye
 On Shri Krishna's return to Dwarka, people insulted him heavily
 tatkaal yah samachar fail gaya ki syamantak mani ke lobh main shrikrishna ne apane bhai ko bhi tyaag diya
 Shri Krishna was mourning the insult he received that suddenly Naradji came there
 unhone shrikrishnaji ko bataaya- aapane bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ke chandramaa kaa darshan kiya tha
 That is why you have to be stigmatized like this
 shrikrishna ne poocha- chouth ke chandramaa ko aisa kya ho gaya he jiske kaaran uske darshanamaatr se manushya kalankit hota he
 Then Naradji said- Once Brahmaji had fasted Ganesh on the day of Chaturthi
 ganeshji neprakat hokar var maangane ko kaha to unhone maanga ki mujhe sristi kii rachana karne kaa moh na ho
 As Ganeshji started walking as 'aastastu', Chandramane was ridiculed by seeing his bizarre personality
 is par ganeshji ne rusht hokar chandramaa ko shaap diya ki aaj se koi tumhaara mukh nahin dekhnaa chahega
 After cursing, Ganeshji went to his own world and hid in the lakes of Moon Mansarovar
 chandramaa ke bina praaniyon ko bada ksht hua
 Seeing their suffering, pleased with the fast of all the gods by Brahma's command, Ganesha gave a boon that now the moon will be freed from the curse, but whoever sees the moon on Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi, he will surely feel a false stash of theft etc
 kintu jo manushya prayek dwitiya ko darshan karata rahegaa, vah is laanchhan se batch jayega
 By fasting Siddhi Vinayak on this Chaturthi all the doshas will be released
 yah sunakar devtaa apane-apane sthaan ko chale gaye
 In this way, you have got this stigma by seeing the moon on Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi
 tab shrikrishna ne kalank se mukt hone ke liye yahi vrath kiya tha
 Yudhishthira asked Lord Krishna in the battle of Kurukshetra - God! What is the measure of man's desire for fulfillment? How can a man attain wealth, sons, good fortune and victory? Hearing this, Shri Krishna replied - If you worship Parvati's son Shri Ganesh in a proper way, then surely you will get everything
 tab shrikrishna kii ajna se hi yudhisthirji ne ganesh chaturthi kaa vrath karke mahabharat kaa yuddh jeeta tha

 Keeping in mind the effects of these submissions, agricultural scientists of the world have suggested that farmers should use all the methods in order to protect their crops from insects and diseases and also to protect the environment from pollution

 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 In the ancient metaphysical definition it has the Brahmi status in the Gita 
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai
 Sampoorna Bhagwat Geeta PDF in Hindi and Sanskrit arene hastkshep sajiv koshikaon ke andar kii ek pranali he jo yah niyantran karne main sahaayta karti he ki koun-koun se jin sakriy hai or kitne sakriy hai
 Two small types of RNA molecules - micrornas and small interfering rnas - are at the heart of RNA interference
 rnas jin ke pratyaksh utpaada hote hai or ye chote rnas anya vishisht rnas se jude hue ho sakate hai or unki gatividhiyon ko yaa to badha sakate hai yaa gata sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye ve ek massenger arene ko protein utpaadan karne se roak sakate hai
 RNA interference plays an important role in protecting cells from parasitic genes - viruses and transposons - but generally plays a role in gene expression as well as directing development
 pashuon ke saath kai eukryot main areneai maarg paaya jaataa he or anzime disar dwaara prarambh kiya jaataa he, jo lambey duhare-dhanse hue arene anuon ko ~20 neucliotoide ke chote tukdon main vibhajit karata he
 One of the two strands of the fragment, known as the guide strand, is then incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex
 adhyayan kaa sabase acha parinaam post tronscriptional jin sailencing he, jo tab paidaa hota he jab guide strand base massenger arene anu ke sampoorak kram ke saath judata he or daraar ko argonot, ariessi complex kaa ek catalytic ghatak, ke dwaara prerit karata he
 This is known as a process that is spread to all organisms physically except for initially limited molar concentrations of sirna
 jin abhivyakti par dsrna kaa chaynit aup majboot prabhaav ise ek mahatvapurn shodh bana detaa he, koshika culture or sajiv praani honon main hi kyonki koshika main daakhil synthetic dsrna ruchi ke vishesh jeenon ke dabaav ko prerit kar saktaa he
 rnai can also be used for large-scale screens that can systematically shut down each gene in a cell, which may aid in the identification of the components required for a particular cellular process or cell division event
 is maarg kaa upyog jaevpraudyogiki or aushadhi ke liye ek aashajanak upkaran ho saktaa he
 Historically, RNA interference was known by the same name as posttranscriptional gene silencing and quelling
 in spashtatya asambandhit prakriyaaon ko puri tarah se samaj lene ke baad hi yah saaf ho paaya ki ye sabhi rnai ke hi tathy ko vyakhyayit karte hai
 In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig C
 Mello received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm C
 elegans, which they published in 1998
 areneai ek arene-ashrith jin sailencing prakriya he jise arene-prerit sailencing complex dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he or jise laghu dugana-dhanse hue arene anuon dwaara koshika ke cytoplasm main shuru kiya jaataa he, jahaan ve katalytic aaraiessi ghatak argonot ke saath ant:kriya karte hai
 When dsrna is exogenous, the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and broken into small fragments by the enzyme dicer
 dsrna kii shuruuaat endogens bhi ho sakati he jaise, microrna-ke rup main purv jin koding-s vyakt kii shahi sena se jinom main he
 The primary transcripts of such genes are the first process to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-mirna in the nucleus, after which they are sent to the cytoplasm to be divided by dicer
 is prakaar, do dsrna raste, exogens or endogens risk complex kii ore jate hai
 Endogenous ribonuclease proteins initiate rnai by activating the dicer, which binds and splits double-stranded rnas to form double-stranded fragments of a few unbound bent 21–25 base pairs at each end
 Huh
 kai jeevon ke jinom par bioinaformctics adhyayan kaa suzav he kii yah lambaai lakshya-jin vishistataa ko adhiktam seemaa tak badhaati or gaiyr-vishisht prabhaavon ko newnatam banaati he
 These small double-stranded fragments are called short interfering sirnases
 iske baad ye sirnas ekal strand main vibhajit kiye jate hai or ek sakriy aaraiessi complex main ekikrut kiye jate hai
 After integration into RISC, sirnas prevent their use of base-pairs from their target mrna and the induced cleavage of the mrna, consequently, as a transformation template
 exogens dsrna ko, si
 elegans main aradi-4 or drosophila main R2D2 ke rup main gyaat ek prabhavotpadak protein ke dwaara pahachaanaa or parisimit kiya jaataa he, jo disar kii gatividhi ko uddipt karata he
 This protein only delimits long dsrnas, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown
 ye arene-binding protein tab vibhajit sirna se RISC complex main sthanantaran ko sugam bana dete hai
 In C
 elegans, this initiation reaction is spread by cell synthesis of a population of secondary sirnas using dicer-produced initiations or 'primary' sirnas as templates
 ye sirnas sanrachanaatmak rup se disar-utpaadit sirnas se pruthak hote hai or ek arene-ashrith arene polimirej dwaara utpaadit hue lagate hai
 micrornas are genomically coded non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression, particularly during development
 vyapak rup se paribhaashit, arene hastkshep kii ghatana main mirnas ke antarjaat rup se prerit jin sailencing prabhaav ke saath hi bahari dsrna dwaara sakriy kii gai sailencing bhi shaamil he
 Mature mirnas are structurally similar to exogenous produced sirnas, but mirnas must first undergo extensive post-transcriptional modification before they mature
 mirna ko piarai-emiarene ke rup main gyaat ek praathmik tronscript ke rup main ek bahut lambey arene-koding jin se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he jise microprocesar complex ke dwaara, koshika nabhik main, ek pre-emiarene naamak ek 70-neucliotide stem-loop sanrachana tak prasanskrit kiya jaataa he
 This complex is composed of an rnase III enzyme called Drosha and a dsrna-binding protein Pasha
 purv- mirna kaa yah dsrna bhaag paripakv mirna anu paidaa karne ke liye disar dwaara bound or vibhajit kiya jaataa he jise RISC complex main ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he; is prakaar, mirna or sirna pravaah kii ore apane shuruuaati processing main usee koshikeey mashinari ko share karte hai
 The sirnas derived from long dsrna precursors are different from those of mirnas, especially those in animals that have incomplete base pairs for the target and that prevent translocation of multiple mrnas of the same sequence
 iske vipareet, sirnas aam taur par purna poop se base-peyar banaate hai or keval ek ekal, nishchit lakshya main mrna daraar ko prerit karte hai
 In Drosophila and C
 elegans, mirna and sirna are processed by confirmed argonaut proteins and dicer enzymes
 ek arene-prerit sailencing complex ke sakriy ghatak lakshya andoneuclies hote hai jinhen argonot protein kaha jaataa he jo unke bound sirna se anyonashrith lakshya mrna strand ko vibhajit karte hai
 Since the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they can all in principle be a functional sirna
 haalanki, do main se keval ek strand, jise guide strand ke rup main janaa jaataa he, argonot protein ko baandhte hai or jin sailencing ko nirdesh dete hai
 Other anti-guide strands or passenger strands are reduced during IRSC activation
 haalanki pehle yah mana jaataa tha ki ek atipi nirbhar helices ne en do stred ko alag kiya, lekin yah prakriya vastav main atipi-nirbhar he or athaiessi ke protein ghatakon dwaara sidhe-sidhe ghatit kii jaati he
 The strand selected as a guide is such that the 5 ′ end is loosely attached to its component, but strand selection is made ineffective by the nondeference in which the Dicer splits the dsrna prior to ISC incorporation
 iske bajaay, R2D2 protein paisanger strand ke adhik-sthir 5' chor ko baandhakar algaavvaadi kaarak ke rup main kaary karata he
 The structural basis to bind RN to the argonaut protein was tested by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an rna-bound argonaut protein
 yahaan, arene strand kaa phosphoyukt 5' chor ek sangrakshit aadharbhoot sarphase pocket main pravesh karata he or ek divalent kaishan se sampark banaata he jaise ki manganecium or yah sampark vah sirna ke 5' niucliotoid or sanchit tirocine avshesh ke bich aromatic staking dwaara karata he
 The idea of this site was to construct a nucleation to bind sirna to its mrna
 yah samaj main nahin aata he ki kaise sakriy RISC complex koshika ke bheetar poorak mrnas ko avasthit karata he
 Although the cleavage process has been proposed to be associated with conversion, conversion of mrna is not required for rnai-mediated degradation
 darasal, areneai mrna lakshya ke viruddh bahut prabhaavshaalee ho sakati he jinka roopantaran nahin kiya jaataa
 argonot protein, RISC ke utprerak ghatakon ko pi-body ke naam se gyaat cytoplasm ke vishesh kshetron main avasthit kiya jaataa he, jo mrna ke teevr ksharan dar vaale kshetra hote hai, mirna gatividhi ko bhi cluster kar diya jaataa he
 Disruption of the P-body reduces the ability of RNA interference, suggesting that these are sites with a complex step in the rnai process
 arene hastkshep maarg ghatakon kaa upyog bahut saare ucroit main sanghathan or unke jinom sanrachana kii marammat main kiya jaataa he
 Modification of histones and the associated induction of heterochromatin formation help genes downregulate pre-transliteration, a process referred to as rna-induced transcriptional silencing and is carried out by a complex of proteins called RITS
 is
 vikhandan yeast ke is complex main argonot, ek chromodomen protein siechapi1 or agyaat kaary karne vaala Tas3 protein rahete hai
 As a result, argonaut and rdrp proteins are required for induction and expansion of heterochromatic regions
 vastav main koshika vibhaajan ke samay, dhimaa yaa vilamb anophej ke kaaran, yeast vikhandan es
paumbe main in jeenon kaa vilop histone mithailation or centromear nirmaan ko baadhit karata he
 In some cases, similar processes involving histone modification have been observed for transliteration upregulate genes
 vah tantra jiske dwaara RITS complex hetrocromatin nirmaan or sanghathan ko prerit karata he use sahi tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he or adhiktar adhyayanon ne apana dhyaan vikhandan yeast ke meting-tip kshetra par kendrit kiya he, jo anya jinomic kshetron yaa jeevadhariyon kii gatividhiyon kaa pratinidhi nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 In the maintenance of existing heterochromotin regions, RITS as a complement to local genes forms a complex containing sirnas and stably binds to local methylated histones, and functions in a nascent pre-mrna transcript, initiated by RNA polymerase
 Goes, working by co-transliteration to deplete
 is tarah ke hetrocromatin kshetra kaa ek gathan, haalanki, iskaa rakrakhaav nahin, disar-ashrith hota he, sambhavat: is kaaran ki disar ko sirnas ke shuruuaati ghatakon ke nirmaan kii jarurat padati he jo anuvarthi tronscript ko lakshya banaate hai
 Heterochromatin maintenance is suggested to act as a self-reinforcing feedback loop as new sirnas are formed by rdrp for incorporation from the nascent transcript to the local rdrp

 SAS: If the two congruent sides of two triangles and the angles between them are equal, then they are congruent
 SSS : yadi ek tribhuj kii teenon bhujaayen duusare tribhuj kii teenon sangat bhujon ke baraabar hon to dono tribhuj sarvangasam hai
 ASA: Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and the included side are equal
 The ASA Postulate was contributed by Thales of Miletus
 In most system of axioms, the three criteria — SAS, SSS and ASA — are established as theorems
 In the School Mathematics Study Group system SAS is taken as one of 22 postulates
 AAS: Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and a not-included side are equal, since the 3rd angle would have to be equal, and therefore the side would be included
 This one is valid only in Euclidean geometry
 The SSA condition which specifies two sides and a non-included angle ) does not always prove congruence
 Specifically, SSA does not prove congruence when the angle is acute and the opposite side is shorter or equal to the adjacent side but longer than the sine of the angle times the adjacent side
 This is the ambiguous case
 In all other cases, SSA proves congruence
 Notice that the opposite side cannot be smaller than the adjacent side times the sine of the angle as this could not describe a triangle
 The SSA condition proves congruence if the angle is obtuse or right
 In the case of the right angle condition), we can calculate the third side and fall back on SSS
 The SSA condition proves congruence if the angle is acute and the opposite side either equals the adjacent side times the sine of the angle or is longer than the adjacent side
 AAA is sthiti main dono tribhuj keval samroop hote hai, jaruri nahin ki ve sarvangasam bhi hon

 The Supreme Court has the maximum and comprehensive judicial jurisdiction of the Indian Union
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anusaar ucchtam nyaayalay kii bhoomika sangheey nyaayalay or bhartiya samvidhan ke sangrakshak kii he
 The rules described in Articles 124 to 147 of the Indian Constitution form the foundation of the Supreme Court's structure and jurisdiction
 ucchtam nyaayalay sabase ucch apiliy adaalat he jo rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon ke ucch nyaayalayon ke faislon ke khilaaf apil sunata he
 In addition, petitions relating to disputes between states or serious violations of fundamental rights and human rights are usually placed directly before the Supreme Court

 28 January 1950, two days after India became a sovereign democratic republic, the Supreme Court of India came into existence
 udghaatan samaaroh kaa aayojan sansad bhawan ke narendramandal bhawan main kiya gaya tha
 Earlier, from 1937 to 1950, the Chamber of Princess was the building of the federal court of India

 The design of the building was designed in the indo-british architectural style by Chief Architect Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar, the first Indian chairman of the Central Public Works Department
 nyaayalay 1958 main vartmaan imaarat main sthaanantarit kiya gaya
 In an attempt by the architects to give the image of the scales of justice to the building, the central block of the building has been made in such a way that it looks like the central beam of the scales
 1979 main do nae hisse purv wing or pashchim wing ko 1958 main bane parisar main joda gaya
 In total there are 15 court rooms in this complex

 raashtrapati bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko apane mat par phir se vichaar karne ko tabhi kahegaa jab is hetu koi taarkik kaaran maujuud hoga
 After reconsideration his vote will be binding on the President, although he will take the opinion of two senior judges of the Supreme Court while casting his vote

 darshanashastra vah gyaan he jo param satya or prakruti ke siddhanton or unke kaarnon kii vivechna karata he
 Philosophy is an approach to test reality
 darshanik chintan multah jivan kii arthvatta kii khoj kaa paryaay he
 In fact, philosophy is the science of self, that is, nature and society, and the general rules of the process of human thought and cognition
 darshanashastra saamaajik chetana ke roopon main se ek he
 Philosophy is the name of the discipline that seeks truth and knowledge
 vyapak arth main darshan, tarkpurna, vidhipurvak evam krambaddh vichaar kii kala he
 It is born according to experience and situation
 yahi kaaran he ki sansar ke bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon ne samay-samay par apane-apane anubhavon evam paristhitiyon ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jivan-darshan ko apanaaya
 The history of Indian philosophy is very old, but in the sense of philosophy, the term philosophy was first used by Pythagoras
 vishisht anushaasan or vigyaan ke rup main darshan ko plato ne viksit kiya tha
 It originated as a science in the slave-master society, which had united the gross sum of human knowledge about the objective world and itself
 yah maanav itihaas ke aarambhik sopanon main gyaan ke vikaas ke nimna str ke kaaran sarvatha swaabhaavik tha
 In the process of development of social production and accumulation of scientific knowledge, different sciences got separated from philosophy and philosophy started developing as an independent science
 jagat ke vishay main saamaanya drushtikon kaa vistaar karne tathaa saamaanya aadhaaron va niyamon kaa karne, yatharth ke vishay main chintan kii tarkbuddhiparak, tark tathaa sangyaan ke siddhant viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa se darshanashastra kaa ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main janm hua
 The fundamental question of philosophy as a separate science is the problem of contemplation with self, the relation of consciousness with ghosts
 darshan vibhinn vishyon kaa vishleshan he 
 Therefore, the philosophy of consciousness is indispensable in Indian philosophy, which is not in modern philosophy
 maanav jivan kaa charam lakshya dukhon se chhutkaaraa praapt karke chir anand kii prapti he
 The same goal of Indian philosophies is to liberate the human from ignorance from the root cause of suffering and attain salvation
 yani agyaan va paramparawaadi or roodhiwaadee vichaaron ko nasht karke satya gyaan ko praapt karnaa hi jivan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 There has been a tendency for curiosity and exploration in humans since time immemorial
 prakruti ke udbhav tathaa surya, chandra or grahon kii sthiti ke alaava paramatma ke bare main bhi jaanane kii jigyaasa maanav main rahi he
 It is the result of his relentless efforts to eradicate these curiosities that we are living in such a developed society
 parantu pracheen rishi-muniyon ko is bhautik samruddhi se na to santosh hua or na chir anand kii prapti hi hui
 Therefore, in order to attain this truth and knowledge, he started searching for knowledge through subtle and subtle means and he also got success in it
 usee satya gyaan kaa naam darshan he
 Dishtehyeneti darshanam arthath asat evam sat padaarthon kaa gyaan hi darshan he
 The term Western Philosophy is derived from Philos + Sophia
 isliye philosphy kaa shabdic arth he buddhi prem
 The Western philosopher wants to become a wise or intelligent person
 paashchaatya darshan ke itihaas se yah baat jhalak jaati he ki paashchaatya darshanik ne vishay gyaan ke aadhaar par hi budhimaan hona chaha he
 Some examples will be found to the contrary in which it is also found ideal to conduct interviews with Paramasta on the basis of conduct purification and precision of mind
 parantu yah adarsh praachya he na ki paashchaatya
 The Western philosopher insists on his knowledge and does not consider it mandatory to conduct his character according to his knowledge
 keval paashchaatya rahasywaadee or samadhivaadi vichaarak hi iske apwaad hai
 Darshan is another name to be interviewed with supreme authority in Indian philosophy
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar manushya ko param satta kaa saakshaat gyaan ho saktaa he
 In this way, the path of devotional knowledge and yoga are explained for the interview
 parantu darshanik gyaan ko vaigyanik gyaan se bhinn kaha gaya he
 In acquiring scientific knowledge, the subject of change has to be changed so that it can be subdued according to its will and then its intended use can be done
 parantu praachya darshan ke anusaar darshanik gyaan jivan sadhana he
 Such a philosophy changes the philosopher himself
 use divya drushti praapt ho jaati he
 By which he sees all beings with his macro vision
 samasamyik vichaardhaara main praachya darshan ko dharm-darshan mana jaataa he or paashchaatya darshan ko bhashaa sudhaar tathaa pratyayon kaa spashtikaran kaha jaataa he Philosophy is the interpretation of experience
 is vyakhya main jo kuch aspasht hota he, use spasht karne kaa ytn kiya jaataa he
 Our knowledge centers open outwards, we often dissolve in the external world
 kabhi kabhi hamaara dhyaan antarmukh hota he or ham ek nae lok kaa darshan karte hai
 As soon as the facts are visible, moral sense also commands
 vaastaviktaa or sambhaavna kaa bhed adarsh ke pratyay ko vyakt karata he
 Under the influence of this suffix we look upwards
 is tarah darshan ke pramukh vishay bahya jagat, chetan aatma or paramatma ban jate hai
 While considering them, we naturally consider their relationship
 pracheen kaal main rachana or rachayita kaa sambandh pramukh vishay tha, madhyakaal main aatma or paramatma kaa sambandh pramukh vishay bana or aadhunik kaal main purush or prakruti, vishayi or vishay, kaa sambandh viven kaa centre bana
 Physics, logic and policy in ancient Greece, these three were considered three parts of philosophy
 bhautikee baahar kii ore dekhati he, tark swayan chintan ko chintan kaa vishay banaata he, niti jaananaa chaahati he ki jivan ko vyavasthit karne ke liye koi nirpeksh aadesh gyaat ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The main questions in philosophy are- 1
 gyaan ke atirikt gyaata or gyey kaa bhi astitv he yaa nahin? 2
 What is the nature of final power? Is it one type, or more than one type? pracheen kaal main niti kaa pramukh lakshya ni:shreyas ke swaroop ko samajhnaa tha
 In modern times, Kant replaced the suffix of duty as the fundamental suffix
 tripti yaa prasannataa kaa moolyankan vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- 1
 gyaan kya he? 2
 Is there a possibility of knowledge or not? 3
 gyaan praapt kaise hota he? 4
 What are the limitations of human knowledge? gyanamimasaa ne aadhunik kaal main vichaarkon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 Earlier philosophy was often taken in the sense of philosophy
 darshanikon kaa lakshya samgr kii vyavastha kaa pataa lagaana tha
 Whenever it seemed that human intelligence could not go further in this investigation, then some secondary principles became the subject of discussion
 yunaan main, sucraat, plato or arestu ke baad tathaa germany main kaant or hegal ke baad aisa hua
 Realism and skepticism are such theories
 is tarah darshanik vivechan main jin vishyon par vishesh rup se vichaar hota rahaa he, ve ye hai- the main topic - gaun vishay - Thinkers have viewed these subjects from various sides according to their own interests
 kisi ne ek paksh par vishesh dhyaan diya he, kisi ne duusare paksh par
 Sub-problems are present below each problem

 Although all philosophy originated from the Vedas, yet the whole of Indian philosophy has been divided into two parts, the believer and the atheist
 jo ishwar tathaa vedokt baton jaise nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga, mimasaa or vedant par vishwaas karata he, use aastik mana jaataa he; jo nahin karata vah naastik he
 The Vedic tradition has 6 philosophies: mimasaa nyaay vaisheshik sankhya yoga veydant This philosophy gives knowledge of paravidya, which is beyond the reach of words, from different perspectives
 prayek darshan main anya darshan ho sakate hai, jaise veydant main kai mat hai
 Note - Often people understand that he who does not believe in God is an atheist but here atheist means not believing in Vedas, so all the three philosophies given above come in atheist philosophy] Anarchism · Deism · Deontology · Dualism · Empiricism · Epiphenomenalism · Feminism · Functionalism · Hedonism · Hermeneutics · Humanism · Idealism · Materialism · Monism · Naturalism · Nihilism · Process · Solipsism · Rationalism · Realism · Relativism · Skepticism · Utilitarianism · more

 vitt main, poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model kaa upyog kisi poonjigat parisampatti ke liye saidhantik rup se upyukt vaanchit pratilabh dar gyaat karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jab is parisampatti ko ek pehle se hi suvishakheekrut sanvibhag main joda janaa ho, tathaa jabaki us parisampatti kaa ashaakhneey jokhim gyaat ho
 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset
 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he
 ”: 2 The broad form of this model is the bi-beta model, which distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem kii avadharana, harry marcovitz dwaara vishakheekaran / vividhikaran tathaa aadhunik sanvibhag theori par pehle kiye gaye kaary kaa vistaar karte hue, jaik trenor, wiliam shorpe, jon lintner and jaan mosin dwaara swatantra rup se prastut kii gai
 In 1990, Sharpe, Markowitz and Merton Miller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for their contribution to financial economics
 fisher blike ne siepiem kaa ek or sanskaran, blike siepiem yaa shunya-beta siepiem, viksit kiya jisamen jokhim-mukt parisampatti kii manyata ko khaarij kiya gaya tha
 This version was more rigorous in empirical testing and was an effective contributor to the global acceptance of CPM
 mulya nirdhaaran va portpholio chayan ke kai aadhunik tareekon ke aagaman tathaa antarpanan anubhavik khaamiyon, ke baavjood apni saadhaaranta va vibhinn prakaar paristhitiyon main upyogita ke kaaran siepiem abhi bhi adhik prachlit he
 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
