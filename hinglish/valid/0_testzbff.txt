 Mobile phones usually receive energy from a battery, which can be recharged from a USB port, from a portable battery, from a power cord or from a cigarette lighter socket using an adapter in a car, or from a solar panel or a dynamo
 Can
 17 farvari 2009 ko, GSM association ne ghoshnaa kari ki ve mobile phone ke liye ek maanak charger par sahamat hue hai
 The standard charger adopted by the 17 manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola, should be the micro USB connector
 nae charger, maujuuda chargeron se adhik yogya honge

 purv main, nikal dhaatu-hydride, mobile phone kii betrion kaa sabase saamaanya rup tha, kyonki unka aakaar or vajan kam hota he
 Lithium-ion batteries are sometimes used, as they are lighter and do not have voltage degradation like nickel metal-hydride batteries
 kai mobile phone nirmaataaon ne puraani lithium-aayan ke vipareet lithium-bahulak betrion kaa upyog shuru kar diya he, bahut kam vajan or ghan ke alawa kisi bhi anya aakaar main bananaa hi iskaa mukhya laabh he
 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates
 t-mobile allows its account holders to open a SIM code after a good 90 days Provide according to the FAQ
 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
 In the US, competition in these types of services does not exist because some major service providers do not offer pay-when-you-go service

 Part of a category on Sikhism guru hargobind sikhon ke chhathen guru the
 Sahib has been praised in the Sikh history of Guru Arjun Dev Ji's son, Guru Hargobind Sahib, as a dal-bhanjan warrior
 guru hargobind sahib kii shiksha diksha mahaan vidvan bhai gurdas kii dekh-rekh main hui
 Guru ji was equally blessed with Baba Budaji
 chathe guru ne sikh dharm, samskruti evam isaki aachaar-samhita main anek aise parivartanon ko apni ankhon se dekha jinke kaaran sikhi kaa mahaan bootaa apni jade majboot kar rahaa tha
 Guru Hargobind Sahib gave protection to this great plant of heritage with his divine vision and gave it an opportunity to flourish
 apane pita shri guru arjuna dev kii shahidi ke adarsh ko unhone na keval apane jivan kaa uddeshy mana, balki unke dwaara jo mahaan kaary prarambh kiye gaye the, unhen safalataa purvak sampoorn karne ke liye aaajeevan apni patibaddhta bhi dikhalaai
 According to the changing circumstances, Guru Hargobindsaheb also took up the education of arms and scripture
 vah mahaan yoddha bhi the
 He had a wonderful practice of wielding a variety of weapons
 guru hargobindsahib kaa chintan bhi krantikari tha
 He wanted the Sikh community to be empowered to fight atrocities and oppression along with peace, devotion and religion
 vah aadhyatm chintan ko darshan kii nai bhangimaaon se jodna chaahate the
 Guru - He assumed the two swords of Miri and Piri as soon as he assumed the throne
 miri or piri kii donon talavaarein unhen baba boddaji pahanaai
 It is from here that Sikh history takes a new mode
 guru hargobindsahib miri-piri ke sankalp ke saath sikh-darshan kii chetana ko nae aadhyatm darshan ke saath jod dete hai
 In this process politics and religion became complementary to each other

 Jahangir's wife was a servant of Noor Jahanmiyanamir
 in logon ne bhi jahangir ko guru ji kii mahanata or pratibha se parichit karavaaya

 jahangir ne keval guru ji ko hi gwalior ke kile se aaazaad nahin kiya, balki unhen yah swatantrata bhi di ki ve 52raajaaon ko bhi apane saath lekar ja sakate hai
 That is why in Sikh history, Guru Ji is called a prisoner and a donor

 Guru ji fought with Shah Jahan four times while remaining firm on his life values
 ve yuddh ke dauraan sadaiv shant, abhaya evam adol rahete the

 guru ji ne apni sujh-boojh se guru ghar ke shraddhaluon ko sugathit bhi kiya or sikh-samaaj ko nai disha bhi pradaan kii

 guru hargobindsahib kii chintan kii disha ko nae vyaavhaarik arth de rahe the
 In fact it was the effect of his aura and power
 guru ji ke vyaktitv or krittitvaka gaharaa prabhaav puure parivesh par bhi padane laga tha
 Guru Hargobindsaheb used all his strength to establish the ideals of Harmandirsahib and Akal Takht Sahib
 guru hargobindsahib praaia: punjab se baahar bhi sikh dharm ke prachaar hetu apane shishyon ko bheja karte the
 Guru Hargobindsaheb not only linked Sikh life philosophy to contemporary problems, but also created a life vision that also highlighted the possibility of glorious solutions
 sikh lahar ko prabhaavshaalee banane main guru ji kaa adwitiya yogadan rahaa
 Guru Ji included Jyoti-plots in Kiratpur Sahib
 gurudwara patalpuriguru ji kii yaad main aaj bhi hajaaron vyaktiyon ko shaanti kaa sandesh detaa he
 Bhai Gurudas has mentioned the glory saga of Guru Hargobindsaheib in these words: Panj Pialepanjpeer Chhatampir Bait Gur Heavy, Arjuna Kaya Palat's idol Hargobindaswari, chali peedhisodhiyanrup dikhaavanavaaro-vaari, Dal Bhanjan Guru Surma Vadayodha is the ten guru of multi-benevolent teachings
 guru hargobind sahib ji jab kashmir kii yatra par the tab unki mulaakaat mata bhagbhari se hui thi jinhone pehali mulaakaat par unase poocha ki kya aap guru nanak dev ji hai kyonki unhone guru nanak dev ji ko nahin dekha tha
 He had made a big chola for Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which had 52 cloves, he had made this cloth a little bigger after hearing about him that his body is a little heavier
 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"

 ★ bhartiya jyotish ke pravartakon main maharishi parashar agraganya hai
 In Maharishi Prokant texts, only these complete texts are available under the name 'brihatparasharhorashastra'
 anya pravartak rishiyon ke vachan to itastatah milte hai, lekin kisi sampoorn granth ke adyavadhi darshan nahi hote hai
 This is a testament to the generality and universality of Parashar's view
 'parashrahorashastra' kii gungrahita va sampoornataa ke kaaran hi inaki yah rachana sarvatra prachlit he
 ★ If you look at all the texts of astrology, then one feels that the original mural of the mantras of the later masters are parasitic thoughts
 ek prakaar se parashar ke jyotishiya vichaaron kaa prastaar hi avaantar granthon main newnaadhik rup se dekhne main aata he
 So it is also said - tirthodakan c vahnishch nanytah shuddhimarhatah
 - That is - just as the evidence of the Vedas themselves is self-evident, the water and fire of the pilgrimage itself is pure, no purification is required to purify, authenticate and make them valid, in the same way to quote the words of Parashar as proof
 The practice is everywhere
 parashari kathanon va nirnyon ko pramanit karne ke liye kisi anya rishi vaakyon kii aavashyaktaa akinchitkar hi he
 ★ Parashar Sampradaya or Parasriya ideology is similar to that Ganga of thoughts, which reaches all the land of India by its nectar at its peak speed or destination, and in the intermittent rivers of many ideologies, it moves within itself
 atah 'parashar matt' ganganad he to anya vichaardhaaraein yaa matt nadiyaan hi he
 It is an uninterrupted, Sadanira river
 is drushti se dekhne par maharishi parashar kaa sthaan jaimini muni se unchaa hi siddh hota he
 We do not find the tradition of nourishment of Gemini Matt in the form of attu in later times
 jaimineey matt kii sabhi baaten parashar sampradaay main sarvatobhaven samahit ho gayi he, iskaa abhas parashrahorashastra ko dekhne se mil jaataa he
 ★ Acharyas like Varahamihira also bow down to the principles of Parashar
 ve apane granthon main bahut parashar matt kaa ullekh karke uskaa angikaran karte hai
 Therefore, the Parashar Sampradaya has been cultivated, flowered and flourished all over India and 'brihadparasharhorashastra' written by him is considered to be the final decisive text in the subject of astrology
 parashar, 'falit jyotish' ke aadhaar stambh hai isamen koi andeh nahi he
 ★ The period of Parashar is allowed to be around Mahabharata period
 kaliyug naamak kalkhand ke prarambh main hone ke kaaran uttarottar baliyastv ke siddhant se kaliyug main parashar matt kii sarvopari manyata spasht he
 ★ At one or two places in Kautilya's Arthashastra it is felt that the Vashistha and Pitamah doctrine was propagated at that time, so after assuming the time of Parashar after Narada, Vasistha, Pitamahadi astrologers, their existence seems to be in the beginning of Kali Yuga
 ★ parasharah kaa sristi tatv nirupan surya siddhant ke tadeey prakaran se mail khaataa he
 Hence Parashar existed around the event of the Mahabharata war, in the Puranic era, after the Vedic creation period, before the modern Matha from Panini, even before Chanakya, in the Puranic period
 ★ arthshaastra main parashar kaa namollekh paaya jaataa he
 Parasrasmriti shlokas are collected in Garuda Purana
 ★ brihadaaranyakopenishad va taittiriyaranyak main vyas va parashar ke naam aate hai
 ★ Yask also mentions the origin of Parashar in his ' # Nirukta'
 ye krishnadwaipayan vyas ke pita the tathaa inke pita kaa naam 'shakti' tha
 Varaha calls Parashar as Shaktiputra or Shakti East
 ★ agnipurana main spashtatya inhen shakti kaa putr hi kaha he
 This Parashar was fascinated by Matsyagandha Satyavati and Parashar son Krishnadvapayan Vyas was born from Satyavati's womb, it is well known
 ★ inhi parashar ne kaliyug main vyavastha banaaye rakhane ke liye 'parasharasmriti' yaa 'dwadashadhyaayi' dharmsamhita kii rachana kii thi
 Krite tu manavo dharmastrayatayein gautam: smritah
 dwapare shankhalikhitah kalau parasharah smritah
 ★ When Krishnadvapayan Vyas ji took some sages to his father Parashar located in Badarikashrama, Parashar gave him the knowledge of Varnashrama Dharma system
 ★ varah ne inhi shaktiputra parashar ko horashastra kaa pravaktaa bhi mana he
 Varahamihira is believed to have occurred in the fifth century
 atah prayek paristhiti main aaj se lagbhag 2000 varsh purv parashar ke samay kii nichali seemaa he
 ★ The conversation of Vidur and Maitreya is mentioned at one place in Srimad Bhagwat
 isse bhi # maitrey, # parashar va # mahabharat kii kadiyaan milti prathit hoti he
 Maharishi Parashar, who described Maitreya as Hora Shastra, was a sage who attained old age or fourth quarter in the Mahabharata period
 mahabharat kaa samay paramparaya kam se kam 3000 varsh purv mana jaataa he
 Hence Parashar took place in India 2-3 millennia ago
 ★ 'parashar tantra' kaa ullekh # bhattotpal ne anek sthanon par kiya he
 He has admitted to seeing and reading 'parashari Samhita' in the commentary of # Brihajatak
 'parashar tantra' naam se jo uddhran die gaye hai, unka vishay tantra arthath siddhant jyotish se kam va samhita se adhik mail khaataa he
 ★ Lord Brahma ji tells Narada ji- brahma ji bole - he naarad ! ab ham shivaji ke chhbbeeswein avatar kii katha kehete hai, tum man lagaakar suno
 ★ Twenty-sixth Avatar of Lord Shiva - chhbbeeswein dwapar main # parashar ne vyas kaa janm liya, jo hamaare # praputra the tathaa # shakti se utpann hue the

 Parashar was the grandson of Vasistha on this basis
 shaktimuni kaa vivaah tapasvi vaisya chitramukh kii kanya adrishyanti se hua tha

 Due to this, Vasishta made many attempts of suicide, but did not succeed
 atah shakti kii patni adrishyanti ko saath lekar ve himalay par pahunche
 Once Vasisthan heard the sound of Vedhyayana, he was surprised because no one who was reciting Vedas was seen there
 tab adrishyanti ne unhen bataa diya ki shakti kaa putr mere garbh main he or usee ke vedadhyayan kii dhwani suni gayi he
 Vasistha was so pleased to hear that he gave up the desire for death
 janmoparant parashar ne sun liya ki rakshas kalmampaad ne unke pita shakti ko kha liya tha
 Hearing this, there was fierce opposition to demons in his mind and he decided to put an end to demons from the world
 is aashay se unhone apana rakshas-satr aarambh kiya jisamen rakshas marate ja rahe the
 When many demons were killed, Maharishi Pulastya went to Parashar after getting the permission of Niruti and prayed to complete the demon-session to save the demon dynasty
 unhone ahimsa kaa upadesh diya
 Vyas also explained to Parashar that it is improper to kill all demons without any blame, so you should complete your yagna because Bhushan of the sages is forgiven - pulasthya tathaa vyas ke sadupadeshon se prabhavit hokar parashar ne apana rakshas-satr purna kiya
 They put Agni in the flat region of the Himalayas
 pulasthya ne rakshas-satr purna karne ke uplakshya main unhen kai prakaar ke aashirwad diye

 For the sake of seeing no one else, the monk created a fog and had sexual intercourse with him, which led to the birth of Parashar-son Vyas
 parashar ke anugrah evam aashirwad se kaali kaa comar rah gaya
 With Parashar's astonishment, Kali became Satyavati with a breath
 satyavati ko yojangandha hone kaa vardaan diya
 This Satyavati was later Shantanu's wife, from whose womb Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born
 vichitraveery ne kashiraj-putree ambika tathaa ambalika ko byaaha, par vah nissantan mar gaya
 At the insistence of Satyavati, Vyasa's engagement with Ambika and Ambalika took place and consequently Pandu and Dhritarashtra were born

 pati kii moochha par vilaap karti rani sumitra ko unhone aashwast kiya tathaa apane haath se raja kaa sparsh kiya
 The king came to his senses
 usne muni ko pranaam kiya
 Then Parashar preached to him to bathe in the Mangalthirtha of Sethubandha to get victory over the enemies
 muni ne use shriramji ke ekakshar mantra kaa upadesh kiya
 On his duly chanting, the bow, arrow, chariot and charioteer required for battle appeared before the king himself
 muni parashar ne pavitra jal se raja kaa abhishek kiya tathaa divyastron kii prayog-vidhi samajhaai
 The king again conquered the enemy and regained his lost kingdom

 To optimize the production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at a cost of approximately US $ 1
5 billion to provide space for two new assembly lines, ie, combination galleries
 New methods of production were developed and a rotating machine was also developed that could rotate the subcomponents of the avionics up to 180 degrees making it easier for employees to reach the upper sections of the structure
