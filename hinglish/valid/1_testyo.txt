 70,000 Zoroastrianism is the prevalent religion of Iran since ancient times
 ye zand avesta naam ke dharmagranth par aadhaarit he
 Its founder is Mahatma Zarathushtra, hence this religion is also called Zarathushtri religion
 zand avesta ke ab kuch hi ansh milte hai
 Its oldest parts can be from the period immediately after the Rigveda
 isaki bhashaa avestan bhashaa he, jo sanskrit bhashaa se bahut, bahut mail khaati he
 The teaching of Zoroastrianism is: Humat, Hukht, Huvrushta, which in Sanskrit was Sumat, Sukta, Suvarna or Subuddhi, Subhash, Subhuktaan
 parsi ek ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ahura mazda kehete hai
 His description is very similar to the Vedic deity Varuna
 agni ko ishvarputra samaan or atyant pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is through this that Ahura Mazda is worshiped
 parsi mandiron ko aatish beharam kaha jaataa he
 Spenta Amesha is their seven angels
 verigod According to Parsi belief, Ahura Mazda's enemy is the evil Angira Manu
 ek jamaane main parsi dharm iran kaa rajdharm hua karata tha
 He took refuge in India
 tabase aaj tak parsiyon ne bharat ke udai main bahut bada yogadan diya he
 When ancient Persia was a vast empire stretching from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, the Prophet Zarathustra laid the foundation of Zoroastrianism, conveying a theism
 zarathustra va unke anuyaayiyon ke bare main vistrut itihaas gyaat nahin he
 The reason is that first Alexander's forces and later Arab invaders destroyed almost all the religious and cultural literature of ancient Persia
 aaj ham is itihaas ke bare main jo kuch bhi jaanate hai, vah iran ke pahaado main utkeern shila lekhon tathaa vaachik parampara kii badaulat he
 By the seventh century AD, the Persian Empire had lost its archaic splendor and power
 jab arabon ne is par nirnaayak vijay praapt kar lee to apane dharm kii raksha hetu anek jarathosti dharmavalambee samudr ke raste bhaag nikle or unhone bharat ke pashchimi tat par sharan lee
 Here they were called 'parsis'
 aaj vishvabhar main maatr sava se dedh lakh ke bich jarathosti hai
 More than half of these are in India
 faras ke shahenshaah vishtasp ke shasankaal main pangbar zarathustra ne dur-dur tak bhraman kar apana sandesh diya
 According to him God is only one
 is ishwar ko zarathustra ne 'ahura majadaa' kaha arthath 'mahaan jivan daata'
 Ahura Mazda is not a person, but is a sattva, a force, an energy
 zarathustra ke darshananusaar vishwa main do aadya atmaaon ke bich nirantar sangharsh jari he
 One of them is the soul of Ahura Mazda, 'spenta Menu'
 duusari he dusht aatma 'angharaa manu'
 To destroy this evil spirit, Ahura Mazda created this material world with his seven works namely sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, humans and fire
 ve jaanate the ki apni vidhwanskaari prakruti tathaa agyaan ke chalate angharaa manu is vishwa par hamalaa karegaa or isamen avyavashtha, asaty, dukh, krurta, rugnataa evam mrityu kaa pravesh kara degaa
 Man, the masterpiece of Ahura Mazda, has a central role in this struggle
 use swechha se is sangharsh main buree aatma se loha lenaa he
 In this war, his weapons will be goodness, truth, strength, devotion, ideal and immortality
 in siddhanton par amal kar maanav antat vishwa kii tamaam buraai ko samaapt kar degaa
 Some more scientific interpreters interpret religion's 'spenta menu' differently
 iske anusaar 'spenta manu' koi aatma nahin, balki sanvriddhishil, pragatisheel man athwa maansikta he
 That is, it is a quality of Ahura Mazda, the quality that creates and enhances the universe
 ishwar ne spenta manu kaa srijan isiilie kiya tha ki ek aanandadaayak vishwa kaa nirmaan kiya ja sake
 The progressive mindset divides human beings into two classes on earth
 sadaachari, jo vishwa kaa sanvardhan karte hai tathaa duraachaari, jo isaki pragati ko rokte hai
 Zarathustra wants that every person should be like God, adopt life-giving energy and be the carrier of creation, enrichment and progress
 paigambar zarathustra ke upadeshon ke anusaar vishwa ek naitik vyavastha he
 This system has not only to maintain itself, but also to develop and enhance itself
 jarathosti dharm main jadta kii anumati nahin he
 Evil forces hamper the process of development, but man is not to be distracted by it
 use sadachaar ke path kar kaayam rahete hue sadaa vikaas kii disha main badhate rahanaa he
 Each moment of life has a definite purpose
 yah koi anayas shuru hokar anayas hi samaapt ho jane vaali cheez nahin he
 Everything is according to God's plan
 sarvocch achchhai hi hamaare jivan kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 Man has to live with goodness, through goodness, for goodness
 'humat', 'huukt' tathaa 'huvarshat' jarathosti jivan paddati ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Zoroastrianism prohibits monasticism, celibacy, fasting, self-suppression etc
 aisa mana gaya he ki inase manushya kamjor hota he or buraai se ladane kii uski takat kam ho jaati he
 Pessimism and depression have been given the status of sin
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki maanav is vishwa kaa puraa anand uthaae, khush rahe
 Whatever he does, just be sure of one thing and that never deviate from the path of virtue
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon se sampann jivan kii manaahi nahin he, lekin yah bhi kaha gaya he ki samaaj se tum jitna lete ho, usase adhik use do
 To get something by killing or exploiting someone is a misdemeanor
 jo hamase kam sampann hai, unki sadaiv madad karnaa chahie
 In Zarathosti religion, death is considered a temporary victory of evil
 iske baad mritak kii aatma kaa insaaf hoga
 If she is virtuous, then she will be inhabited by joy and light, and if misdemeanor, she will go into the depths of darkness and despair, but this state of vicious soul is also temporary
 aakhir jarathosti dharm vishwa kaa antim uddeshy achchhai kii jeet ko maanata he, buraai kii sajaa ko nahin
 Hence it is believed that eventually many liberators will come and complete the victory of good over evil
 tab ahura majadaa aseem prakaash ke rup main sarvasamarthyavan honge
 Then the spirits will have the final say
 iske baad bhautik sharir kaa punarotthana hoga tathaa uskaa apni aatma ke saath punarmilan hoga
 Time will cease to exist and the seven works of Ahura Mazda will come together in eternal blessedness and attain blissful, eternal existence

 Almora · Uttarkashi · Udham Singh Nagar · Chamoli Garhwal · Champawat · Tehri Garhwal · Dehradun · Pithoragarh · Pauri Garhwal · Bageshwar · Rudraprayag · Haridwar khagolashastra main upgrahi challa kisi grah ke ird gird ghumta hua pattharon, dhul, barf or anya padaarthon kaa bana hua challa hota he
 Its biggest example in our solar system is Saturn's orbiting rings

 Scientists believe that there may be three reasons for becoming a satellite ring - kisi jamaane main sochaa jaataa tha ke upgrahi challe sthai nahin ho sakate or karodon saal ke antaraal main dhire-dhire bikhar jate hai yaa phir judakar ek upgrah bana lete hai
 Conversely, close study of Saturn's rings has revealed that its rings have been intact since the early days of the solar system, that is, they have been in existence for billions of years

 haalaanki kavi ke ullekh ke anusaar is mahakavy ko rachane kii prerana unhen adikavi valmiki se hi mili
 They wrote that is ke purvardh kii katha valmikiy ramayana se kuch-kuch samya bhi rakhata he kintu uttarardh main kavi kii nijee udbhaavna evam vyavastha hi pramukh he
 The poet's erudition is demonstrated through this poetry
 samvaad-yojana, alankaar-yojana, chand-yojana kii drushti se yah kavy kavi ke acharyatv ke kaushal ko hi prastut karata he
 In this, the poet has broken the well-known narrative tradition
 vastutah unhone is granth-rachana main pratyaksh sahyog sanskrit ke 'prasanraghav', 'hanumannatak' aadi granthon se liya he
 'kadambari' also has a clear effect
 naatakon kaa aadhaar lene se or katha bhaag chhod dene se samvaad ke vaktaaon ke naam inhen padya se pruthak rakhane pade hai
 The dialogue-planning is done in a dramatic way, so it can be used with visual simplicity as a special feature
 keshav ke is kavyagranth main bhakthi kii pradhanta na hote hue bhi ram ko avtari mana gaya he tathaa anek sthalon par unase upadesh dilaayaa gaya he
 As a result, the didactic passages have become substantial and poetry has been damaged
 keshav ko reetikaal kaa yuganirmaataa sahityakar tathaa hindi kaa pratham acharya kavi mana gaya he
 From this point of view, the predominance of Acharyatva is also evident in Ramachandrika
 style kii drushti se isamen vividh prakaar ke chhandon ke udhaaharan prastut karne kii pravriti dikhaai padati he
 It seems that poets are teaching someone the method of pingle
 ramchandrika kii bhashaa sanskritpradhan brajabhasha he
 Due to excessive use of Sanskrit words and the miracle of ornamentation, the composition has become cumbersome and annoying
 is granth main kavi kii sahrudayata se kahin adhik panditya kaa pradarshan prabal he
 In the words of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, it undoubtedly expresses the great piety and acharya of Keshava
 pracheen hindi sahitya kaa marmajna hone ke liye ramchandra chandrika kaa adhyayan nirvivaad rup se anivaary he
 It has an important place in Hindi literature

 In such a situation, tigers are called cannibals or man-eaters
 baagh ko aarambh se hi ek vishisht saamaajik sthiti praapt rahi he
 Especially because of its fearless nature and majestic dealings, it is counted among the top foresters
 jahaan ek ore manushya ne sadaa se baagh ko veerta or devatv ke bhav se dekha he vahi baaghon ne bhi manushya ko sadaiv apni prakritik bhojan shrinkhalaa se pare ek jeev ke taur par rakhaa he
 It is not that there has not been a conflict between humans and tigers, but this confrontation only occurs under special circumstances
 amuman yah takaraav donon ke achaanak saamne aa jane par hi hota he or is takaraav kaa ghaatak parinaam saamne aane par bhi adhikansh ghatnaon main baagh manushya ko ghayal yaa uske sharir ko kshatvikshat karke chhod detaa he

 narbhakshi baagh aamtaur par bagal se yaa peeche se hamalaa karte he or shikaar ke paas palatwaar karne kaa koi mauka nahin hota he
 Cannibal behavior of tigers is not their normal behavior
 iske liye mukhya rup se vanya sthanon main anuchit or andhadhundh maanviya dakhal jimmedaar he
 The percentage of forest is decreasing rapidly and human interference in the natural habitat of tigers is increasing
 aisi sthiti main baagh apane bhojan or nivas ke liye apane prakritik nivas or swabhaav kaa parityag kar ke maanviya seemaa main chale aate hai
 After tasting human blood, tigers generally like it and become habitual

 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 taal ek prakaashiya yukti he jo prakaash ke apvartan ke siddhanth par kaam karata he
 Taal is a transparent medium surrounded by two surfaces of regular, geometric form such as spherical, cylindrical, etc
, which form an actual or imaginary reflection of an object after refraction

 The surface of the palate is usually spherical, but cylindrical, or agoli palms are also used as needed
 aankh ke crystalia taal hi ekmaatr prakritik taal he
 Thousands of years ago, people knew about the rhythm and according to Maisner, in ancient times even glasses were benefited
 chashmen ke alaava prakashvigyaan main taal kaa upyog doordarshee, sookshmdarshi, prakashastambh, dwinetri ityadi main hota he
 Rhythm can be mainly divided into two classes, anant se aanevaali samaantar kiran uttal lens main apvartan ke pashchaat bindu pha par abhisarit hokar vahaan vaastavik pratibimb bana rahi he; jabaki avatal taal main apvartan ke pashchaat ve bindu "pha" par bane kaalpanik pratibimb se apsaarit hoti prathit hoti hai
 Therefore, convex pool is also called 'convergent pool' and concave pool is also called 'upsari pool'
 yahan yah jaan lenaa aavashyak he ki uttal taal abhisari taal or avatal taal apsaari taal ke rup main tabhi kaam karata he, jab uske chaaron taraf ke madhyam kaa apvartanaank taal ke madhyam ke apvartanaank se kam hota he
 = 1
5, refractive index of air is mu = 1
00)
 yadi chaaron taraf ke madhyam kaa apvartanaank taal ke madhyam ke apvartanaank se adhik hoga, to uttal taal apsaari or avatal taal abhisari ho jayega
 The focus distance of a rhythm can be derived from the following formula
 is sutara ko taal-nirmaataa kaa sutara kehete hai
 Where yadi d kaa maan R1 or R2 kii tulana main chota ho to ise 'patala taal' kahenge
 For this, the formula for focus distance will be as follows lenson main prakaashiya varna-vipathan kii samasya paayi jaati he
 In many cases this problem can be removed to a large extent by the combination of two complementary chromatic aberration lenses
 yadi alag-alag aakaar ke evam alag-alag padaarth ke saral lenson ko ek ke baad ek kram main lagaaya jaay to ise yogic taal kehete hai
 The simplest case is one in which the rhythms are placed adjacent to each other
 yadi f1 or f2 focus duuri vaale do patale taal sataakar rakhe jate hai to unki sammilit focus duuri f kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala jaayegaa- Since 1 / f is called the power of the rhythm, it can be said that the powers of the lens are also added when coupled
 kintu yadi do patale taal paraspar d duuri par rakhe jany to sanyukt taal tantra kii focus duuri is sutara se niklegi- Eyeglasses have a thinner rhythm and are also made in the same manner described earlier
 parantu isaki sataha kaa utana yatharth hona aavashyak nahin he jitna un lenson kii sataha kaa jo doordarshee or photography main prayukt hote hai
 The edges of the palate are glued to the stone wheel to form the shape of the eyeglass frame
 nikat drushti dosha ko dur karne ke liye avatal taal or dur drushti dosha ko dur karne ke liye uttal taal prayukt hota he
 a cylindrical rhythm is used to remove impurities of immobility
 yadi is dosha ke saath saath nikat drushti, yaa dur drushti, kaa dosha bhi ho, to goleey belanaakaar taal prayukt hota he
 The power of such lenses in the direction of the vertical axis is different from the power of the rhythm in the direction of the horizontal axis
 jaradur drushti ke dosha ko dur karne ke liye dwifokasi taal kaam main aata he, jisamen avatal tathaa uttal ek hi taal main donon tarah ke taal sanyukt rahete hai
 The upper part is for viewing distant objects and the lower part is for viewing of nearby objects
 kaanch ko ek vishesh prakaar kii mashin par ghiskar dwifokasi, taal taiyaar karte hai
 Nowadays, usually both types of lenses are heated and combined in a furnace to create a bifocal rhythm, and the rhythm formed in this way is called the melody bifocal rhythm
