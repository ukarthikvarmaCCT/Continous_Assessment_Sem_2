 No form of Maya has been used to build bridges on the ocean

 valmikiy ramayana main darshan, raajnneeti, naitikta, shashan kushalta, khagolashastra tathaa manovigyaan kaa vishad varnan hona siddh karata he ki maharishi valmiki vividh vishyon ke gyaata tathaa prakand pandit the
 In this epic, not only of Rama and Sita, but also the characters of Bharat, Lakshmana, Shatrughan, Hanuman, Sugriva, Dasharatha, Kaushalya, Sumitra, etc
 are also presented as strong and inspiring

 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another

 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal

 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary

 Therefore, in most parts of the world and in societies, male dominance is found

 In the patriarchal tribes, men are often allowed to have more than one wife, but there is very little that only specific and powerful people can do

 aisa samay aata he jab raktasambandhon kii nikatataa ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt parivaar do yaa anek sanyukt athwa asamyukt pariwaron main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The disjoint family also takes a combined form in the chronology and the order of the joint family remains
 sanyukt parivarpranali yadhyapi bahut pracheen he, tathaapi iske aantarik swaroop main bahirvivaah, uttaradhikaar tathaa saanpattik adhikaar ke niyamon main, kalkram main parivartan hota rahaa he
 The Industrial Revolution has disrupted the traditional joint family in Western countries, due to which the livelihood security and advancement facilities are given to the person outside the family as a result of increased mechanization

 aisi avasthaa main jab arthvyavastha or utpaadan ke sadhano main bhi buniyadi parivartan ho rahaa he, parivaar ke shashan, rachana or kaaryon main herpher hona avashyambhavi he or vah parilakshith bhi ho rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say that the joint form of the family is ending
 nagaron or graamon main sanyukt parivaar pehle se kam ho gaye hai, iskaa koi pramaan nahin he
 There are mainly two types of ideas among scholars regarding change
 ek vichaar ke anusaar paristhiti ke prabhavaswaroop parivaar main katipay parivartan hone par bhi uskaa sanyukt rup nasht nahin ho rahaa he

 In order to make the pigeon his diet, the eagle pursues him to hunt
 kabutar teji se udata hua raja shibi ke charnon main ja padaa or bolaa- meri raksha kiijie

 You need meat to satisfy your hunger, so i give you meat equal to the weight of this pigeon

 a healthy diet is one that helps to maintain or improve health

 a healthy diet includes adequate intake of all nutrients and water

 Healthy diet is very beneficial for our body

 By the mid-1990s, high cholesterol fears were often voiced
 tathaapi, abhi haal ke anusandhan ne darshaya he ki jab cholestrol ke dushprabhav kii baat kii ja rahi ho, ucch or nune-ghanatv ke lipoprotein ke bare main samaadhaan hona chahie
 Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol
 udhaaharan ke liye, bahaasantrupt vasa cholestrol ke donon prakaar ko kam karne kii ore pravrutt hote hai; eksantrupt vasa LDL ko kam or HDL ko badhaane kii ore pravrutt hote hai; santrupt vasa yaa to HDL ko badhaane yaa HDL or LDL donon ko badhaane kii ore pravrutt hote hai; or, paar vasa LDL ko badhaane or HDL ko kam karne kii ore pravrutt hote hai
 Dietary cholesterol by itself is found only in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy, but studies have shown that large amounts of dietary cholesterol only have a negligible effect on blood cholesterol

 The major problem for foods with such advertisements is that alcohol and fast food are portrayed as provoking, escaping, and instant gratification
 vishesh rup se pichley paanch varshon main sarkari agenciyon ne "junk" khaadya padaarthon par media kawarej ke liye kharch kii gai raashi or vidhi se nipatane kaa prayaas kiya he
 The government also pressures businesses to promote healthier food choices, consider limiting the availability of junk food in state-run schools, and taxing high-fat foods

 The British Heart Foundation released its government-funded advertisements under the label "food4thought", which were targeted towards children and in which adults generally display the macabre nature of how fast food is made
 manovaigyanik drushtikon se, khaane kii aswasth aadaton vaale vyakti ke liye ek nayaa swasth aahaar hasil karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 This may be due to the taste and acquired preferences for fatty foods in early adolescence
 aise vyakti ke liye swasth aahaar ke prati parivartan aasaan ho saktaa he yadi chocolate jaisi chizein khaanaa anumat ho; mithai mood sthirkaarak ke rup main kaam kar sakati he, jo sahi poshak padaarthon ke seven ko sambalit karne main sahaayak ho sakati he
 It is well known that experiences related to food intake in our childhood affect our attitude towards food in later life
 isse ham apane aap nirdhaarit karne main sakasham hote hai ki ham kitna khaaenge, saath hi koun se khaadya padaarthon kaa ham seven nahin karenge - jo kshudhalop, atikshudha, yaa orthorexia jaise khan-paan sambandhi vikaar viksit kar saktaa he
 This is also accurate for our approach regarding daily consumption of food size or quantity of foods; People's interpretation of more or less food is based on their upbringing
 jahaan paudhe, subjiyan or fal chirkaalik bimariyon kii ghatnaon ko kam karne main madadgaar ke rup main jaani jaati hai, paudhon par aadhaarit khaadya padaarthon dwaara swasthya laabh, saath hi saath aahaar kaa kitna pratishat swasthya laabh paane ke liye paudhon par aadhaarit ho, isaki jaankaree agyaat he
 Nevertheless, plant-based diets have been associated with health and longevity among society and nutrition circles, as well as cholesterol lowering, weight loss, and in some cases stress reduction

 Whereas, there was no objection from Gandhi about this right given to Indian Christians, Muslims and Sikhs
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
 Now Gandhi's health was continuously deteriorating due to the death fast

 Ambedkar was indifferent to the deal, calling it Gandhi's fast to play a drama played by Gandhi to deprive the untouchables of their political rights and pressurize them to withdraw from their demands

 Baba Saheb Ambedkar made many efforts to improve Hindu religion and Hindu society, to achieve equality and respect, while being under Hindu religion for 10-12 years, but the heart of the upper caste Hindus did not change
 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya
 After that he said that, "we made every effort and satyagraha to achieve the level of equality in Hindu society, but all proved fruitless
 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, interrupts their jobs, insults them and even gives them water
 ambedkar ne hindu dharm tyaagane kii ghoshnaa kisi bhi prakaar kii dushmani va hindu dharm ke vinaash ke liye nahin kii thi balki unhone iskaa faisla kuch moulik siddhanton ko lekar kiya jinka hindu dharm main bilkul talmail nahin tha

 unke dwaara itnaa lanbaa samay lene kaa mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki wo chaahate the ki jis samay wo dharm parivartan karen unke saath zyada se zyada unke anuyaayi dharmantaran karen

 buddha dharm pragna, karunaa or samta kii shiksha detaa he
 He said that man wants these things for auspicious and happy life
 devtaa or aatma samaaj ko nahin bachaa sakate
 According to Ambedkar, true religion is the one whose center is man and morality, based on science or intellectual element, not God, the center of religion, liberation of soul and salvation

 'most of the constitutional provisions of India have reached directly in an effort to promote this revolution either by advancing the purpose of social revolution or by setting the conditions necessary for its achievement

 In fact, i can say that if anything went wrong, it would not be because our constitution was bad but the person using it was inadequate
 ambedkar ne bharat ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 kaa virodh kiya, jisane jammu-kashmir rajya ko vishesh darja diya, or jise unki ichchhaaon ke khilaaf samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Balraj Madhok had said that, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah: "you want India to protect your borders, it should build roads in your area, it should supply you with food grains Should, and give Kashmir equal status as India
