temuri shah husain bikera ke baad jab turan main sultanate barabaad hui, to shephali kabul kii taraf bhagya pariksha karne ke liye aayaa
 His son Yarli and grandson Saifali migrated to Afghanistan
 yarali ko babar ne gazani kaa haakim niyukt kiya
 After a few days on his death, son Saifali got the same status
 vah bhi jaldi hi mar gaya
 The young adult Bairam went away with his family members
 humayun se mitrataabalkh main vah kuch dinon tak padhata-likhata rahaa
 Then he became the servant of the contemporary Shahzada Humayun and later his friend
 bairam khaan ko sahitya or sangeet se bhi bahut prem tha
 He soon became very dear to his master
 16 varsh kii aayu main hi ek ladaai main bairam khaan ne bahut veerta dikhaai, uski khyaati babar tak pahunch gai, tab babar ne khud usase kaha : shahzada ke saath darbar main hajir karo
 After Babur's death, he started living as the shadow of Humayun Emperor
 humayun ne champaner ke qile par gheraa daalaa
 Seeing no mistake, Dal Mughal Bahadur descended into the fort with stairs, including Bairam Khan
 qila fatah kar liya gaya
 Bairam Khan was also with Sher Shah while fighting in Chausa
 kannauj main bhi vah ladaa
 All these events tied Humayun and Bairam Khan into an unbreakable friendship
 jivan daanakannauj kii ladaai main paraajay ke baad mogul sena main jisaki sing jidhar samaai, vah udhar bhaaga
 Bairam reached Mian Abdul Wahab of his old friend Sambhal
 phir lakhanu ke raja mitrasen ke paas jangalon main din guzaartaa rahaa
 Sher Shahi Hakim Naseer Khan came to know
 usne bairam khaan ko pakad mangavaya
 Naseer Khan wanted to kill Bairam Khan, but Bairam Khan somehow escaped from the efforts of friends
 ant main use shershah ke saamne hajir hona padaa, jisane ek maamuli mogul sardaar ko mahatv na dekar use maaf kar diya or jivan daan de diya
 The office of the ruler of Kandahar went again to the Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud, but he was in tune to meet his master
 jab hijri 950 main humayun iran se lautakar kabul lete sindh kii ore badha, to bairam khaan apane aadamiyon ke saath humayun kii ore se ladane laga
 Humayun got the news of this, then he was not happy
 hindustan main safalataa milane vaali nahin thi, isliye humayun ne iran kaa rasta kiya
 Bairam Khan was also with him
 shahi kafile main kul milakar sattar aadmi se zyaada nahin the
 Humayun besieged Kandahar after returning from Iran
 usne chaha, bhai kamran ko samajha-bujhaakar koon-karaaba roka jaae
 Humayun sent Bairam Khan to Kabul to convince him, but where he was going to be
 qandahar par adhikaar karke bairam khaan ko vahaan kaa haakim niyukt kiya gaya
 Regarding Kandahar Vijay, Humayun himself said- "rose Nauroz Bairam's' Emrose"
 dile ahabaab begum’st imroj
 After being defeated by the Mughal emir, he was disappointed
 vah kabul laut janaa chaahate the, par bairam khaan ne unhen roak diya
 Intrigue Akbar's milkmaid Maham Anga was always plotting against Bairam Khan
 mogul darbar main maham anaga kaa ek samooh tha, jo hameshaa hi bairam ko nicha dikhaane main laga rahata tha
 In Hijri 961, these people cheated that Bairam Khan wants to be independent, but Bairam was not salt-free
 humayun ek din jab swayan qandahar pahunchaa tha, tab bairam khaan ne bahut chaha ki badshaah use apane saath le chale, lekin qandahar bhi ek bahut mahatvapurn sthaan tha, jiske liye bairam khaan se badhkar acha shaasha nahin mil sak Bairam was an associate of Humayun and a wali or guardian of his minor son Akbar
 vah badshaah humayun kaa param mitra tathaa sahyogi bhi tha
 In his entire life Bairam Khan served the Mughal Empire very much
 humayun ko uskaa rajya phir se hasil karne tathaa kitne hi yudhon main use vijit karaane main bairam khaan kaa bahut bada haath tha
 To make Akbar also the Emperor of India, Bairam Khan waged numerous wars and made a significant contribution to the establishment of the Mughal Empire in India by defeating a powerful king like Hemu
 mogul samrajya main akbar kii doodhmata maham anaga hi thi, jo bairam khaan ke viruddh saazish karti rahati thi
 It was the result of these intrigues that Bairam was ordered to perform Haj, where he was assassinated in 1561 AD
 vansh parichayberam khaan kaa sambandh turan kii turkman jati se tha
 The Nizams of Hyderabad were also Turkmen
 itihaaskaar kasim farishta ke anusaar vah iran ke karakuilu turkmaanon ke baharlu shakha se sambaddh tha
 Alishkar Beg Turkman was one of the famous chieftains of Timur, who was appointed ruler over Hamdan, Dinwar, Khuzistan etc
 alishkar kii santaanon main shephali beg hua
 After the Sultanate of Turan was destroyed after Timur Shah Hussein Baykra, Sherli came to Kabul to test his fortune
 uskaa betaa yarali or pota sammli afghanistan chale aaye
 Babar was appointed as the ruler of Ghazni by Yarli
 thode hi dinon ke baad uske marane par bete sammli ko vahiin darja mila
 He too died soon
 alp vayask bairam apane gharavaalon ke saath balkh chalaa gaya
 He kept studying for a few days in Humatabalkh with Humayun
 phir vah samavayask shahzada humayun kaa naukar or baad main uskaa mitra ho gaya
 Bairam Khan also loved literature and music
 vah jaldi hi apane swami kaa atyant priy ho gaya tha
 Bairam Khan showed great valor in a battle at the age of 16, his fame reached Babur, then Babar himself said to him: Attend the court with Shahzada
 babar ke marane ke baad vah humayun badshaah kii chaaya ke taur par rahane laga
 Humayun laid siege to the fortress of Champaner
 kisi tarah se daal galati na dekhakar chalis mogul bahadur sidhiyon ke saath qile main utar gaye, jinamein bairam khaan bhi tha
 The fort was conquered
 shershah se chausa main ladate vaqt bairam khaan bhi saath hi tha
 He also fought in Kannauj
 in sabhi ghatnaon ne humayun or bairam khaan ko ek atoot mitrataa main band diya tha
 After the defeat in the battle of Jeevan Danakannauj, the horn of the Mughal army, whose horn he had, ran away
 bairam khaan apane puraane dost sambhal ke miyaan abdul wahaab ke paas pahunchaa
 Then the king of Lucknow spent days in the jungles near Mitrasen
 shershahi haakim naseer khaan ko pataa laga
 He ordered Bairam Khan to hold him
 naseer khaan chahta tha ki bairam khaan ko katl kar den, par doston kii koshish se bairam khaan kisi prakaar se batch gaya
 In the end, he had to appear in front of Sher Shah, who did not give importance to a minor Mughal chieftain and forgave him and donated his life
 qandahar ke haakim kaa padberam khaan phir se gujarat ke sultan mahmud ke paas gaya, par use apane swami se milane kii dhun thi
 When Hijri returned to Iran in 950 and Humayun proceeded towards Sind, taking Kabul, Bairam Khan fought with his men on behalf of Humayun
 humayun ko isaki khabar lagi to uski khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 In India, success was not going to come, so Humayun traveled to Iran
 bairam khaan bhi uske saath tha
 In total there were no more than seventy men in the royal convoy
 iran se lautakar humayun ne qandahar ko gheraa
 He wished, the brother-in-law should understand and stop the bloodshed
 use samajhane ke liye humayun ne bairam khaan ko kabul bheja, lekin vah kahan hone vaala tha
 By taking over Kandahar, Bairam Khan was appointed as the governor
 qandahar vijay ke bare main humayun ne swayan kaha-“roj nauroj bairam’st imroj”
 Dile Ahhab Begum'st Imrose
 se parajeet hokar mogul amir niraash ho chuke the
 He wanted to return to Kabul, but Bairam Khan stopped him
 saazikabar kii doodhmata maham anaga nity hi bairam khaan ke kilaaf saazishen rachati rahati thi
 In the Mughal court, there was a group of Maham Anaga, who always used to degrade Bairam
 hijri 961 main in logon ne chugali lagaai ki bairam khaan swatantra hona chahta he, lekin bairam khaan namak-haraam nahin tha
 When Humayun had reached Kandahar himself one day, Bairam Khan desired that the emperor take him with him, but Kandahar was also a very important place, for which no better ruler could be found than Bairam Khan

 On November 26, when the fleet was approaching the capital Aava, the representative of King Thebaw approached General Prendergast with a proposal of surrender; And on the 27th, when the naval ships were about to reach outside the city and start the attack, the troops received orders to lay down their king's weapon

 In the meantime, however, the surrender of the Burmese king was completed; And on November 28, within a fortnight of the declaration of war, Mandalay had fallen, and King Theobo had been taken captive, each powerful fort on the river, the king's artillery, thousands of rifles, guns, and weapons in his possession

 John Milton, the author of the immortal epic called John Milton Paradise Lost, is enumerated among the greatest English poets of all time
 kalapremi pita kii santan hone se aarambh se hi susanskrit milton ne ucch shiksha bhi praapt kii
 At the same time, the natural instinct of rapid learning gave him the ultimate erudition, which also had a spontaneous effect on his literature
 raajnneetik sakriyata ke baad satta main ucch pad praapt karne tathaa ucch vargeey mahila se vivaah karne ke baavjood donon hi sthitiyaan milton ke liye antat atyadhik dukhad siddh hui
 Despite becoming completely blind and having to face various sufferings, he also made his grief a source of creativity and in this way, the end of a miserable life became miserable rather than sad
 ye ek mahaan kavi he
 His personal sonnet is 'on His Blindness' which is based on his own being blind
 jon milton kaa janm landan kii chipside basti bredstreat main 9 disambar 1608 i0 ko hua tha
 His father was a lover of literature and art despite being a strict Puritan, due to which the child Milton received all the benefits of a cultured family
 milton kii shiksha saint paul skool tathaa kembridge vishvavidhyalay ke christ college main hui
 He remained 7 years at Christ College
 1629 i0 main unhone bi0e0 paas kiya or 1632 main em0e0
 But even after the completion of college, his regular and planned studies continued
 unke pita kii ichha thi ki vah carch main naukari kare arthath padri bane, parantu apane antarman se milton kabhi yah baat sweekaar nahin kar paye
 He was also not interested in going into any other business
 swaabhaavik rup se ve atmik unnati kii baat sochate hue kavyrachana main lag gayi
 Due to his father's good financial condition, he did not even feel difficulty in doing so
 cambridge chhodane ke baad ve apane gramin nivas par rahane lage, jo landan se kareeb 17 mile dur buckinghamashair main harton main tha
 Milton was so engrossed in his studies from childhood that he often kept reading till midnight
 vishvavidhyalay main bhi unki yah adhyayan-nishtha bani rahi or gramin nivas ke ekantavaas main swaabhaavik rup se unka adhyayan abaadh gati se chalata rahaa
 Thus, Milton became a great scholar by steadily increasing his erudition on the already laid firm foundations
 yah baat saavdhaneepurvak dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he, na keval isliye ki apane paanditya kii vishalata evam vishuddhta main vah hamaare anya sabhi kaviyon se kahin zyada bad chadh kar he, balki isliye bhi ki uske panditya ne sarvatra uske sahitya kaa poshan kiya he jiske falswaroop uskaa sahitya uske panditya se otprot he
 At the age of 30, after deciding to travel, Milton traveled from London to Paris via Italy; But after receiving news of the crisis situation indigenously, he found it unethical to travel
 agast 1639 main ve landan laut aaye or 1640 ke baad satta ke viruddh puritanon ke sahaayak ke rup main kriyasheel rahe
 When the Commonwealth was established, he was appointed the Latin Secretary for the Committee on Foreign Affairs
 1643 main unhone rajpaksh ke ek sadsy richard pavel kii yuvati kanya meri pavel se vivaah kiya, parantu yah vivaah atyant durbhagyapurna siddh hua
 This young woman felt that her journey with Milton was bleak and so she went to meet her father after a month and refused to return
 isi ke baad milton ne 'talaak ke siddhant tathaa anushaasan' par ek pustika likhi thi
 His wife returned in 1645 and died in 1652 after becoming the mother of three daughters
 1652 ke aarambh main hi atyant durbhagyapurna rup se ve bilkul andhe ho gayi
 His eyesight was already greatly weakened due to extreme exertion
 3 varsh baad unhone punah vivaah kiya parantu unki patni catherine woodcock 15 maheene ke andar hi mar gayi
 Milton was imprisoned after the re-establishment of the kingdom and two of his books were burned by state command
 parantu sheeghra hi ve mukt hue or dhire-dhire unki raajnneetik prasiddhi samaapt ho gayi
 Now they were blind, as well as poor and alone
 jis nimitt unhone itnaa parishram or balidaan kiya tha uski asafalataa se unhen mahan klesh ho rahaa tha
 He married a third, Elizabeth Minshall, comforting her in old age, although she was also suffering a great deal due to the ungrateful behavior of the daughters of the first wife
 aisi andhakaarmay evam dukhapurna paristhiti main unhone mahan kaavyatmak yojanaon ko apanaaya or isi kshetra main jivan kii charam safalataa praapt karke 8 november 1674 ko unka dehanth ho gaya
 Milton created Paradise Lost as a byproduct of his lifetime accumulated wish, despite enduring the hatred and ridicule of the people when he became blind
 apni is amar kriti main milton ne ek saath kavy, naatak, vyangy, raajnneeti, dharm-darshan -- sabaki samekit abhivyakti kar daali he
 In this epic based on biblical narrative, he embodied his mature ideological conclusions while giving a cinematic version of the then political ups and downs, as well as intertwining various disciplines
 yah saarvkalik mahan mahakavy 1667 i0 main prakashit hua tathaa paradise rigand or samson agonystis donon saath-saath 1671 i0 main
 Paradise Lost has actually ended in Paradise Regiment
 paradise lost kii tulana main yah chaar sargon kaa alpakaay khandakavy he
 The liquidation of this Khandakavya has been completed in a relaxed manner, while discussing the philosophy of religion
 purv mahakavy main aadam ke nirvaasan rupi duhkhant ke baad yahan naatakeey rup se shaitan kii paraajay tathaa maseehaa kii vijay ke varnan se samast kavyakruti kii sukhaant parinti hui he
 It is often undoubtedly recognized that Milton is the greatest English poet after Shakespeare
 duusare shabdon main iskaa aashay he ki vah natya sahitya ke baahar angreji kaa mahanatam kavi he
 Milton started composing from the time he studied in college
 unhone gadhy evam padya donon vidhaon main likhaa he
 Milton's poetry is not high in number due to writing well-written verses and getting into political and religious disputes for a long time
 kul jamaa lagbhag ek darjan sanet kii rachana hi unhone kii he
 After engaging in political and religious controversies, Milton continued to compose prose for nearly 20 years, of which almost all except Ariopositica are considered redundant
 unka shaashvat mahatva kavy-rachana ke kaaran hi he
 Areopositica bahadurpur-1 nathanagar, bhagalpur, bihar sthit ek gaanv he

 Many dialects are spoken in Italy, some of which seem very different from literary Italian

 The names of Italian dialects closely resemble the borders of the Italian provinces
 switzaraland se mili hue uttari italy ke kuch bhaagon main ladin varg kii boliyaan boli jaati hai-jo romance boliyaan hai; switzaraland main bhi laadini boli jaati he
 Ventsian dialects are spoken in the northwestern part of Italy, the city of Venice can be called its representative center
 pimaute, liguriya, lombardia tathaa emilia praanton main inhen naamon kii boliyaan boli jaati hai jo kuch-kuch francisi boliyon se milti hai
 The ending vowel of Latin is omitted in it - for example Phat,, Fett Otto, Ott
 toskana praant main toskana varg kii boliyaan boli jaati hai
 The basis of literary Italian has been the dialect of Toscana province, especially Florence
 yah laathini kshadhik sameep kahi ja sakati he
 The mahaprana utterance of Kantha is its principal feature — namely kasa, kahasa

 Even though they evolved from the same original source, their differences may have come in different ways to pronounce Latin in these dialects

 There are beautiful Rustic songs in the dialects of Italy which are now being collected and studied
 boliyon main sajivta or vyanjanashkti paryaapt he
 The folk songs of Nopolitano are very famous
 naveen sadi ke aarambh kii ek pehle "indovinello veronese" milti he jisamen aadhunik italvi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa prayog hua he
 Even before that, the use of Latin apostles are found in the accounts of the accounts written in Latin, which inform the beginning of modern language
 saatvin or aathvin sadi main likhit patron main sthanon ke naam tathaa kuch shabdon ke rup main milte hai jo naveen bhashaa ke dyotak hai
 Gradually, the dialect of literary Latin and the general language gradually increased, and modern Italian developed from the Latin of dialect itself
 is boli ke anek namoonay milte hai
 a testimony in the context of the Panchayat of the boundary of the monastery of Montecassino in 960 is found in the then dialect; a similar dialect and article written in Latin Apabhramsa is found in the church of Saint Clemente of Rome

 These poems may have been composed in the dialect of Sicily
 shringaar hi in kavitaaon kaa pradhan vishay he
 Pierre Dalla Vinya, Yakopo the Aquino, etc
, were in the court of Frederick, a number of scholars
 vah swayan kavi tha
 After Venevetto's war, the literary and cultural center became Toscana, instead of Sicily, where the sangarivayak Gitikavya was composed, Guittone del Viva de Arrezzo was the principal poet of this stream
 florence, pisa, lukka tathaa aarejjo main is kaal main anek kaviyon ne tatkaaleen boli main kavitaayen likhin
 There was an attempt to stabilize the form of literary language in Bolon
 sicili or toskana kavyadharaon ne saahitiyik italvi kaa jo rup prastut kiya use antim or sthir rup diya "dolche stil novo" ke kaviyon ne
 These poets kept such a form of artistic restraint, refined interest and refined rich language that for many centuries ahead Italian writers kept writing in this as their ideal
 dante alimieri ne isi naveen style main, toskana kii boli main, apni mahaan kriti "divina komediya" likhi
 Dante also introduced a refined form of prose in "convivio" and introduced a form of natural prose different from the artificial and ordinary colloquialism of Guido Faba and Guittonne de Arezzo
 dante tathaa "doche stil novo" ke anya anuyaayiyon main agraganya hai fronchesco, petrarka or jvovanni bokkacho
 Petrarca refined and organized the language of Florence
 petrarka kii kavitaaon or bokkacho kii kathaon ne italvi saahitiyik bhashaa kaa atyant suvyavasthit rup saamne rakhaa
 The writers behind took inspiration from the works of Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio for centuries
 15veen sadi main laathini ke pracheen sahitya ke prashansakon ne laathini ko chalaane kii cheshtaa kii or pracheen sabhyataa ke adhyayanwaadiyon ne naveen saahitiyik bhashaa banane kii cheshtaa kii, kintu yahi laathini pracheen laathini se bhinn thi
 As a result of this trend, what should be the form of literary language, the problem arose
 ek dal vibhinn boliyon ke kuch tatv lekar ek nai saahitiyik bhashaa gadhane ke paksh main tha, ek dal toskana, visheshkar florence kii boli ko yah sthaan dene ke paksh main tha or ek dal, jisamen pietaro bembo pramukh tha, chahta tha ki dante, petrarka or bokkacho kii bhashaa ko hi adarsh mana jaae
 Machiavelli also favored Fiorentino
 toskana kii hi boli saahitiyik bhashaa ke pad par pratishthit ho gai
 Further in 1612, Kruska Academy published the first dictionary of the Italian language, which helped to stabilize the literary language form
 18veen sadi main ek nai sthiti ai
 French began to have a great influence on the Italian language
 french vichaardhaara, style, shabdaawalee tathaa vaakyanshon se or muhaavaron ke anuwaadon se italvi bhashaa kii gati rug gai
 The French rationalist movement was its primary cause
 italvi bhashaa ke anek lekhakon-aalgarotti, verry, bekkaaria-ne ni:sankoch french kaa anusaran kiya
 The biases of the pure Italian were greatly hurt by this
 milan ke nivasee alessandro manjoni ne is sthiti ko suljhaayaa
 They considered it necessary to have a language for the unity of the nation and they considered the language of Florence to be suitable for that place
 apane upanyaas "i promessi sposi" main florence kii bhashaa kaa saahitiyik adarsh rup unhone sthapit kiya or is prakaar toskana kii bhashaa hi antim rup se saahitiyik bhashaa ban gai
 This problem was definitely solved after Italy attained political unity

 Books compiled by six Sunni Muslim scholars in the ninth century AD are called Qutub al-sittah
 unhen kabhi-kabhi al-sahih al-sittaah ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo "pramanik chah" ke rup main anuwaad karata he
 They were first formally grouped and defined in the 11th century by Ibn al-qaysrani, who added Sunan ibn Majah to the list
 tab se, unhone sunni islam ke aadhikarik siddhant ke hisse ke rup main nikat-saarvbhaumik sweekrut kiya gaaya he
 Not all the Sunni Muslim jurisprudence scholars Ibn Majah's mutaluk agree
 vishesh rup se, maliki or ebn al-athir jaise al-mavattaah ko chhathi pustak maanate hai 
 The reason for linking Ibn Majah to Sunan is that it contains many hadiths that do not figure in the other five, while all the hadiths of Muvatta are included in other Sahih books
 sunni muslim chah pramukh haddees sangrahon ko unke sabase mahatvapurn maanate hai, haalanki pramanikta kaa kram mazahabon ke bich bhinn hota he According to Ibn Hajar, the first two, commonly referred to as the two Sahihs, as an indication of their authenticity, contain about seven thousand hadiths, if repetition is not counted

 Gopal Ram Ghamri was a great Hindi servant, novelist and journalist
 ve 38 varshon tak bina kisi sahyog ke 'jasoos' naamak patrika nikaalte rahe, 200 se adhik upanyaas likhe, saikadon kahaniyon ke anuwaad kiye, yahaan tak ki rabindranath thakur kii 'chitraganda' kavy kaa bhi anuwaad kiye
 He was a writer who rendered Hindi Ahnish service, encouraged people to read Hindi, created such works that people learned Hindi
 yadi devakinandan khatri ke baad kisi duusare lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhane ke liye gaiyrhindi bhashiyon ne hindi sikhi to ve gopalram gahamri hi the
 Gahmari initially translated plays, then started translating novels
 bangala se hindi main kiya gaya inkaa anuwaad tab bahut pramanik mana gaya
 Rich in versatility, Gopalaram Gahmari wrote in a wide variety of poems, dramas, novels, stories, essays and literature, but in the field of detective novels
 'jasoos' naamak ek masik patrika nikaali
 For this, he often had to write a novel every month
 200 se zyada jasusi upanyaas gahamriji ne likhe
 'awesome Corpse', 'innocent hanging', 'sarkati corpse', 'double detective', 'fierce theft', 'killer hunt' and 'guptabhed' are his major novels
 jasusi upanyaas-lekhan kii jis parampara ko gahamri ne janm diya, uskaa hindi main vikaas hi na ho sakaa
 Gopal Ram Gahmari was born Paush Krishna 8 Thursday evening in 1923 in Gahmar in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh
 inke prapitamah shri jagannatha sahu francisi chheent ke vyapaaree the
 He had two sons - Raghunandan and Brijmohan
 raghunandanji ke teen putr hue ram narayan, kaalicharan or ramdaas
 Gopalram Ghamri was the son of Ramnarayanji
 kaalicharan ni:santan the or ramdaas ke ek hi putr the mahavir prasad gahamri
 Gopalram Gahmari also had one son, Iqbal Narayan
 mahavir prasad gahamri ke do putr the devtaa prasad gahamri evam durga prasad gahamri
 Devta Prasad Gahmari was associated with the daily 'aaj' and 'sanmarg' published from Kashi for a long time
 gopal ram gahamri jab chah maas ke the tabhi pita kaa dehanth ho gaya or inaki maan inhen lekar apane maike gahammer chali ain
 Gopal Ram was brought up in Gahmar itself
 praarambhik shiksha-sanskaar yaheen sampann hue
 Due to his extra attachment to Gahmar, he added this nanihal with his name and started to be called Gopalaram Gahmari
 unki praarambhik shiksha gahammer main hui thi
 Educated at Vernacular Middle from there
 1879 main middle paas kiya
 Then at the Gahmar School, he continued to teach students for four years and also continued to practice Urdu and English
 iske baad patna narmal skool main bhartee hue, jahaan is shart par pravesh hua ki uteern hone par middle paas chaatro ko teen varsh padhaanaa padegaa
 Accepted this condition due to poor economic condition
 lekin bich main hi padhai chhodkar gahamri ji betia maharaja skool main head pandit kii jagah par kaary karne chale gaye
 In the year 1888, he discharged from all work and passed the normal examination in the High First Grade
 iske turant baad 1889 main rohtasgarh main headmaster niyukt ho gaye
 However, he could not survive here and moved to Bombay in 1891 at the invitation of Seth Gangavishnu Khemraj, the famous publisher of Bombay
 gahamri ji jab rohtasgarh main the to vahiin se patr-patrikaon main apni rachanaaen bheja karte the
 When he started living in Bombay, his pen was also moving there
 yah alag baat he ki ve vahaan bhi adhik dinon tak nahin tik sake
 Since Khemraj's business was the publication of books, there was no special place for creativity for him
 patr-patrikaon kaa prakaashan vahaan se hota nahin tha
 Therefore, not seeing his favorable opportunities here, resigned from there and went to Kalakankar
 kaalankaakar se nikalne vaale dainik 'hindosthaan' ke gahamri ji niyamit lekhak the
 Along with this, the best newspapers and magazines of that time used to write regularly in 'bihar Bandhu', 'bharat Jeevan', 'saar Sudhanidhi'
 jab 1892 main gahamri ji raja rampal singh ke nimantran par kalakankar chale aae to yahaan ve sampadakeey vibhaag se sambanddh ho gaye or ek varsh tak rahe
 While working here, she learned Bangla and also tried to enrich literature through translation
 gahamri ji ek jagah bahut dinon tak nahin tikte the
 Once again in 1893, he turned to Bombay and started editing the letter 'bombay Business Sindhu' emanating from here
 is patr ko vahaan ke ek nirbhik or aseem saahsee postman nikaalte the
 But say the misfortune of this letter or that of Ghamri ji that this letter stopped after six months, but Ghamri ji did not go in vain
 vahiin ke ek hindi premi eses mishra ne gahamri ji ko bulaakar unhen 'bhashaa bhushan' ke sampadan kaa bhaar saunpa
 This letter was monthly
 lekin yah patr bhi band ho gaya
 But there were no economic reasons behind this shutdown nor any other type of optical problems
 balki is patr ko ek dange ke kaaran band kar dena padaa
 After the closure of 'bhasha Bhushan', he went in search of a new place
 inke chaahane waalon or in par sneh rakhane waalon kii kami nahin thi
 Among them were Pt
 Balmunkud Purohit
 inhen kii krupa se gahamri ji mandla kii ore rukh kiye
 But could not stay here for long
 yahaan se masik 'guptakatha' kaa prakaashan to shuru hua, lekin arthabhaav ke kaaran is patr ko asamay band kar dena padaa
 Gahramiji once again came to the crossroads
 lekin is chauraahey se ek rasta phuta jo bombai kii ore jaataa tha
 Khemraj ji started publishing the letter named ‘sri Venkateswara Samachar’
 yah patr gahamri ji ke kushal sampadan main thode samay main hi lokapriy ho gaya
 Meanwhile, in the 'pradeep' originating from Prayag, a detective story 'hirar Price' was published by the tribune's editor Nagendranath Gupta
 gahamriji ne is kahani kaa hindi main anuwaad kar shri venkateshwar samachar main kai kishton main prakashit kiya
 This detective story was so interesting to the readers that many readers subscribed to this letter
 us daur main jasusi dhang kii kahaniyon main pathakon kii gahari ruchi jag rahi thi
 It would have confounded such a tale of interestingness and mystery that aroused a kind of jugupas within the readers and forced them to read
 gahamri ji pathakon ke man-mastishk ko samaj chuke the
 He had become aware of the popularity of the translation of 'hire Ka Mole' and the reactions of readers by writing 'jodi Detective'
 is lokapriyata ke kaaran ve kai tarah kii yojanaayen banane lage
 They had also understood that a vast section of readers could be created only through detective stories
 gahamri ji puri taiyaari ke saath jasusi dhang ke lekhan kii ore pravrutt hue
 It is also worth mentioning that some incidents that happened to him also pushed him towards espionage writing
 is tarah 1899 main hi ve ghar aakar jasoos nikaalnaa chaahate the, kintu balmukund gupt ke putr kii shaadi honi thi or ve 'bharat mitra' ke sampadan kaa bhaar gahamri ji ko dekar apane gaanv guryani chale gaye
 For a few days, Ghamri ji edited 'bharat Mitra' efficiently
 isaki vajah se 'jasoos' kaa prakaashan thode samay ke liye sthagit ho gaya
 He wished that along with 'saraswati', 'detective' should also be published, but this desire remained in his mind
 is tarah jasoos kaa prakaashan janvari, 1900 main 'saraswati' ke saath na hokar chaar maheene baad yani may 1900 main hua
 During the editing of 'bharat Mitra', Ghamri ji had informed about the exit of the detective
 iskaa laabh yah hua ki saikadon pathakon ne prakashit hone se pehle hi patrika kii graahaki le lee
 Another notable thing is that the credit of the word 'detective' in Hindi goes to Ghamri ji
 unhone likhaa he ki '1892 se pehle kisi pustak main jasoos shabd nahin dikh padaa tha
 He named his magazine in such a way that the general reader could easily understand its subject matter
 'jasoos' shabd se haalanki yah bodh hota he ki isamen jasusi dhang kii kahaniyaan hi prakashit hoti hongi, lekin aisi baat nahin thi
 In addition to a detective story in every issue, news, views and reviews of books were also published regularly
 jasoos nikaalane ke liye unhen kuch dhan kii aavashyaktaa thi, isaki purti unhone 'manorama' or 'mayavini' likhakar kar lee
 The first issue of 'detective' came out from Hariprakash Press of Babu Amir Singh and in the first month, we received a quarter to two hundred rupees from VPP
 isane apane praveshank se hi lokapriyata kii sari hadon ko paar karte hue shikhar ko chhu liya tha
 Seeing its immense popularity, Gopalaram Gahmari did not look back when he turned to writing espionage stories and novels and did not care what the so-called scholars of literature thought of him
 apane praveshank main jasoos kii parichay kuch is andaaj main pesh kiya- In this way, due to its readership and due to their immense affection, this magazine kept on coming out of the village like Gahmar for a whole 38 years, not for two years
 jis tarah bal krishna bhatta ne bhukh se jujhate hue 33 varshon tak 'hindi pradeep' ko pradipt rakhaa, vaise hi gopal ram gahamri ne yenkenprakaren 38 saal tak ise jivit rakhaa
 Meanwhile, he again got an opportunity to go to Bombay
 venkateshwar samachar patr nikal rahaa tha
 He needed an editor
 yadhyapi us samay us patr ke sampadak yashasvi lekhak lajjaram mehta ji the
 They were to go to Bundi at their home
 isliye patr ko ek sampadak kii jarurat thi
 Gahmari ji went to his call and took charge, but the 'detective' did not stop
 vah lagaataar nikal rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Seth Ranganath proposed to Gahmari ji that the detective be given to him and he should continue to live for Rs 50
 seth ji ne unke samaksh yah bhi prastaav rakhaa ki bombai main rahane kii ichha na ho jo gahammer se hi likhakar bhej diya karen, prakashit karata rahoonga
 However, Gahmari ji declined the offer and returned to his village
 is dauraan gahamri ji ne jasusi vidha se hatakar aadhyatmik vishyak do pustaken likhin
 'shakti Shakti' was a translation from his Bangla and 'mohini Vidya', a unique work on Masmerism and possibly the first in Hindi
 ye donon pustaken hindi pathakon dwaara kaaphi pasand kii gayi
 In later days, he was also disgusted by espionage writing and he turned to religion and spirituality
 gahamri ji kaa kahana tha ki 'jiskaa upanyaas padhakar pathak ne samaj liya ki sab solho aane sach he, uski lekhnee safal parishram samajni chahie
 'ghamri ji used to take special care of the readers' interest in his works, what kind of material he likes
 sahitya ke sandarbh main unke vichaar bhi ucch koti ke the
 He also considered literature as history
 unka maananaa tha ki sahitya jis yug main rachaa jaataa he, uske saath uskaa gaharaa sambandh hota he
 He considered the novel as the history of his time
 guptchar, bekasoor kii faansee, ketki kii shaadi, ham hawalat main, teen jasoos, chakkardaar khun, than than gopal, gerua baba, 'mare hue kii maut' aadi rachanaaon main keval rahasy romaanch hi nahin hai, balki yug kii sangatiyaan or visangatiyaan bhi maujuud hai
 The condition and direction of the society is also assessed
 yah kahkar ki ve jasusi or keval manoranjak rachanaaen hai, unki rachanaaon ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he, na unke avadaanon se munh modaa ja saktaa he
 Much credit goes to Devkinandan Khatri and Gahmari ji for the popularity of Gahmari ji's later generation
 inhone apane lekhan se vah sthitiyaan bana di thi ki logon kaa padhgaye kii ore rujhaan bad gaya tha
 Gahmari ji alone translated hundreds of stories, novels
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne to apane sahitya ke itihaas main gopalram gahamri ke krititv ko saraahaa, lekin baad ke aalochakon ne unhen bisraa diya
 Gautam Sanyal wrote in a special issue of Hans that, 'premchand's novel which holds the highest place in terms of readability, many narrative situations of' embezzlement 'are similar to a foreign crime thriller and translated by Gopalram Ghamri In 1906, Detective had done it in the magazine
 ' is uddhran se gopalram gahamri ke bare main kuch or kehane kii jarurat nahin he

 kaalsarp ek aisa yoga he jo jataka ke purv janm ke kisi jaghanya aparaadh ke dand yaa shaap ke falswaroop uski janmkundali main parilakshith hota he
 Practically, a victim is financially and physically disturbed, mainly because he has child related problems
 yaa to use santan hoti hi nahin, yaa hoti he to vah bahut hi durbal va rogi hoti he
 His livelihood is also very difficult
 dhanadhay ghar main paidaa hone ke baavjood kisi na kisi vajah se use apratyaashit rup se aarthik kshati hoti rahati he
 Various types of diseases also bother him
 jab janm kundali main saare grah rahu or ketu ke bich avasthit rahete hai to usase jyotish vidya marmajna vyakti yah faladesh aasaani se nikaal lete hai ki sambandhit jataka par aane vaali ukt prakaar kii pareshaaniyaan kaalsarp yoga kii vajah se ho rahi hai
 But remember, this yoga does not have the same effect on all the natives of Kalsarp Yoga
 kis bhav main koun si raashi avasthit he or usamen koun-koun grah kahan baithe hai or unka balaabal kitna he - in sab baton kaa bhi sambandhit jataka par bharpoor asar padataa he
 Therefore, there is no need to be scared just by listening to Kalsarpa Yoga, but by getting an astrological analysis of it and getting detailed information about its effects will be called intelligence
 jab asli kaaran jyotishiya vishleshan se spasht ho jaye to tatkaal uskaa upaay karnaa chahie
 Below are some astrological situations in which Kalsarpa Yoga troubles the native with great intensity
 ukt lakshanon kaa ullekh is drushti se kiya gaya he taaki saamaanya pathakon ko kaalsarp yoga ke bure prabhaavon kii paryaapt jaankaree hasil ho sake
 But it is not that Kalsarpa Yoga is bad for all the natives
 vividh lagnon va raashiyon main avasthit grah janm-kundali ke kis bhav main hai, iske aadhaar par hi koi antim nirnay kiya ja saktaa he
 There have been many such people with Kalsarpa Yoga who, despite facing many difficulties, rose to high positions
 jinamein bharat ke pratham pradhanmantri swa pan jawahar laal nehru kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 Late Morarji Bhai Desai and Shri Chandrashekhar Singh were also affected by yoga etc
 kintu ve bhi bharat ke pradhanmantri pad ko sushobhit kar chuke hai
 Therefore, in any situation, a person should not be discouraged and should always be constantly alert for his all-round progress while performing his duties
 yadi kaalsarp yoga kaa prabhaav kisi jataka ke liye anishtakaari ho to use dur karne ke upaay bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 Our ancient texts mention many such measures, through which all kinds of planetary obstacles and predated inauspicious deeds can be repented
 yah ek jyotishiya vishleshan tha pun: aapako yaad dilaanaa chahta hoon ki hamen apane jivan main milane vaale saare achche yaa bure fal apane nizkrut karmo ke aadhaar par he, isliye grahon ko dosha na den or karm sudhaaren or trisutriy nuskhe ko apane jivan main apanaayen or mere bataaye gaye upayon ko apane jivan main prayog main laayen, aapke ksht zarur samaapt honge
 Trisutriya Recipe: Self-serving parents, husband and wife's religious conduct, devotion and loyalty to the country
 yah upaay apanaate hue maatr ikkis shanivaar or ikkis mangalvaar kisi shani mandir main aakar niyamit shri shani pujan, shri shani tailabhishek va shri shanidev ke darshan karenge to aapke ksht avashya hi samaapt honge
 Is there Kalsarp Yoga in your horoscope? Do not panic, you should take the time to meet a qualified priest
 kaalsarp yoga ke pramukh bhed kaalsarp yoga mukhyat: baarah prakaar ke maane gayi hai
 An attempt has been made to explain all the distinctions by presenting an example horoscope - jab janmkundali main rahu lagn main va ketu saptam main ho or us bich saare grah hon to anant naamak kaalsarp yoga banataa he
 The personality building of such natives requires hard work
 uske vidhyarjan va vyavsaay ke kaam bahut saamaanya dhang se chalate hai or in kshetron main thodaa bhi aage badhane ke liye jataka ko kathin sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 Mental anguish sometimes provokes him to leave his family and adopt a reclusive life
 latary, share va sood ke vyavsaay main aise jaatakon kii vishesh ruchi rahati hai kintu usamen bhi inhen zyada haani hi hoti he
 He has to face many ailments physically
 uski aarthik sthiti bahut hi danvadol rahati he
 As a result, his mental anxiety starts dissolving poison in his married life too
 jataka ko mata-pita ke sneh va sampatti se bhi vanchit rahanaa padataa he
 His near relatives also do not desist from harm
 kai prakaar ke shadyantron va mukademon main fanse aise jataka kii saamaajik pratishtha bhi ghatati rahati he
 He has to be humiliated again and again
 lekin pratikultaaon ke baavjood jataka ke jivan main ek aisa samay avashya aata he jab chamatkaarik dhang se uske sabhi ksht dur ho jate hai
 That miracle happens suddenly with no effort
 sampoorn samasyaon ke baad bhi zarurat padane par kisi cheez kii inhen kami nahin rahati he
 It does not make anyone bad
 jo jataka is yoga se zyada pareshaani mahasoos karte hai
 They should benefit by taking the following measures
 rahu duusare ghar main ho or ketu ashtum sthaan main ho or sabhi grah in donon grahon ke bich main ho to kulik naam kaalsarp yoga hoga
 The native also has to become a part of the evil
 is yoga kii vajah se jataka kii padhai-likhaai saamaanya gati se chalati he or uskaa vaivaahik jivan bhi saamaanya rahata he
 But due to financial troubles, poison is dissolved in his married life too
 mitron dwaara dhokhaa, santan sukh main baadha or vyavsaay main sangharsh kabhi uskaa peechha nahin chhodte
 The nature of the native is also distorted
 maansik asantulan or shaareerik vyaadhiyaan jhelte-jhelte vah samay se pehle hi boodha ho jaataa he
 There is a continuous decline in his enthusiasm and might
 uskaa kathin parishramee swabhaav use safalataa ke shikhar par bhi pahunchaa detaa he
 But he does not fully enjoy this fruit
 aise jaatakon ko is yoga kii vajah se hone vaali pareshaaniyon ko dur karne ke liye nimnlikhit upayon kaa avlamban lenaa chahie
 Rahu in the third house and Ketu in the ninth place and in the meantime if all the planets are afflicted, then Kalasarpa Yoga called Vasuki is formed

 There is a lack of peace and tranquility in the house
 jataka ko samay-samay par vyaadhi grasit karti rahati hai jisamen adhik dhan kharch ho jane ke kaaran uski aarthik sthiti bhi asaamaanya ho jaati he
 The native has to struggle to earn money, yet success in it remains doubtful
 chandramaa ke peedit hone ke kaaran uskaa jivan maansik rup se udign rahata he
 Due to this yoga, the native has to suffer especially in legal matters
 rajyapaksh se pratikulata rahati he
 The native has to suspend or suffer in the field of job or occupation etc
 yadi jataka apane janm sthaan se dur jaakar kaary karen to adhik safalataa milti he
 But even after everything, the native achieves a lot of success in his life
 vilamb se uttam bhagya kaa nirmaan bhi hota he or shubh kaary sampaadan hetu use kai avasar praapt hote hai
 If Rahu is in the fourth place and Ketu is in the tenth place, if there are all the planets in between, then Kalsarpa Yoga called Shankhapal is formed
 isse ghar-dwaar, jameen-jaaydaad va chal- achal sampatti sambandhi thodi bahut kathinaaiyaan aati hai or usase jataka ko kabhi-kabhi bevajaah chintaa gher leti he tathaa vidya prapti main bhi use aanshik rup se takalif uthaani padati he
 The native receives some partial discomfort from the mother at some time or another
 sawari evam naukaron kii vajah se bhi koi na koi ksht hota hi rahata he
 In this they also have to bear some loss
 jataka kaa vaivaahik jivan saamaanya hote hue bhi vah kabhi-kabhi tanavagrast ho jaataa he
 Due to the suffering of the Moon, the person is lost mental balance from time to time
 kaary ke kshetra main bhi anek vighn aate hai
 But they all automatically get destroyed in the interruption period
 bahut saare kaamon ko ek saath karne ke kaaran jataka kaa koi bhi kaam praaia: puraa nahin ho paata he
 Due to the effect of this yoga, the economic balance of the person gets disturbed, due to which the financial crisis also is present
 lekin itnaa sab kuch ho jane ke baad bhi jataka ko vyavsaay, naukari tathaa raajnneeti ke kshetra main bahut safaltaaen praapt hoti hai evam use saamaajik pad pratishtha bhi milti he
 If you feel the above problem then take the following measures
 avashya laabh milegaa
 If Rahu v and Ketu are in the eleventh house and meanwhile all the planets, then Padma Kalasarpa Yoga is formed
 iske kaaran jataka ke vidyadhyayan main kuch vyavdhaan upasthit hota he
 But in time, that disruption ends
 unhen santan praaia: vilamb se praapt hoti he, yaa santan hone main aanshik rup se vyavdhaan upasthit hota he
 The native is often worried about his son
 jataka kaa swasthya kabhi-kabhi asaamaanya ho jaataa he
 Due to this yoga, even though life is normal, couples sometimes become more stressful
 parivaar main jataka ko apyash milane kaa bhi bhay bana rahata he
 The friends of the native are selfish and they all help to make him fall
 jataka ko tanavagrast jivan vyateet karnaa padataa he
 Due to the effect of this yoga, there are also secret enemies of the native
 ve sab use nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 There is partial obstruction in its profit path also and due to anxiety, the life of the person remains struggling
 jataka dwaara arjeet sampatti ko praaia: duusare log hadap lete hai
 Diseases also surround the native
 ilaaj main adhik dhan kharch ho jane ke kaaran aarthik sankat upasthit ho jaataa he
 The native is more concerned about old age and sometimes the feeling of taking retirement in his mind is also awakened
 lekin itnaa sabakuch hone ke baad bhi ek samay aisa aata he ki yah jataka aarthik drushti se bahut majboot hota he, samaaj main maan-sammaan miltaa he or kaarobaar bhi thik rahata he yadi yah jataka apana chaal-chalan thik rakhen, madhyapan na karen or apane mitra kii sampatti ko na hadpe to uparokt kaalsarp pratikul prabhaav lagu nahin hote hai

 The Pentium dual-core brand was used for Intel's mainstream x86-structured microprocessors from 2006 to 2009 when it was renamed Pentium
 procesar yaa to 32-bit vaale yonah yaa 64-bit vaale merom-2em, alendel or woolfdel-3em kor par aadhaarit hai, jo mobile yaa desktop computer ko lakshya kar taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Pentium dual-core processors are placed above the Celeron but below the Core and Core 2 in Intel's product types, according to features, price, and performance in the given clock frequency
 pentium dul-kor overklocking ke liye bhi adhik lokapriy pasand tha, kyonki yah kam keemat par sarvshereshth pradarshan pradaan kar saktaa he
 In 2006, Intel announced plans to reintroduce low-cost core microarchitecture processors based on single-core conro-l but less than 1 megabyte of cash as a structural product after the Pentium trademark was removed from the market 
 The identification numbers of those employed pentiums were similar to the subsequent pentium dual-core microprocessors, but the first digit being "1" instead of "2", indicated their single-core viability
 1 mabibite cash vaala ek single-kor conro-l ko utana sakasham nahin mana gaya ki vah niojit pentiyamon kaa seleronon ke saath antar kar saktaa tha, isliye uskaa sthaan dul-kor vaale sipiu ne le liya or "dul-kor" ko us shrenee main shaamil kar liya
 Throughout 2009, Intel changed the name from Pentium dual-core to Pentium in its publications
 Some processors were sold under both names, but recent E5400 to E6800 desktops and SU4100 / T4x00 mobile processors were not officially part of the Pentium dual-core range
 is brands kaa upyog karne vaala pratham procesar 2007 ke aarambh main notebook computer main dikhaai diya
 pentium T2060, T2080 or T2130 naam vaale un processron main 32-bit kaa pentium M-vyutpann yonah kor tha, evam vah 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor duo T2050 ke lagbhag samaan tha
 All three of them had a 533 mhz FSB that connected the CPU to memory
 intel ne laptop nirmaataaon ke anurodh par pentium dul-kor viksit kiya
 Subsequently on June 3, 2007, Intel released desktop Pentium dual-core branded processors known as the E2140 and E2160
 baad main sitambar 2007 main ek E2180 model jari kiya gaya
 These processors support Intel 64 extensions, which are based on the recent 64-bit core microarchitectored Allendale core
 ve 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor 2 duo E4300 procesar ke lagbhag samaan the
 They both had an 800 mhz FSB
 unhone intel seleron se upar ke procesar vaale saste bazaar ko apana lakshya banaaya jinaki visheshta keval 512 kilobite vaali L2 cash thi
 One such move brought a change to the Pentium brand and shifted it to the cheaper category, rather than its former position with the mainstream / premium brand
 These are highly capable of overclocking cpus
 alendel procesar ke mobile sanskaran merom-2m ko bhi 2007 main shuru kiya gaya, jisaki visheshta 1 megabite vaali L2 cash kintu T23xx processron ke saath keval 533 MT / s FSB thi
 The bus clock was later increased to 667 MT / s for T3xxx Pentium processors made from the same dye
 intel dwaara 45 nanometer vaale E5200 model ko agast 31, 2008 ko jari kiya gaya, jisamen 65 nanometer vaale E21xx shrinkhalaa main 2 megabite kii L2 cash or 2
5 gigahertz kii kaald gati thi
 The E5200 model is also a highly capable processor to overclock, with some highly enthusiastic models achieving a clock speed of up to 6 ghz using liquid nitrogen refrigeration
 intel ne is kor kaa upyog karte hue E6500K model jari kiya
 The model features an open multiplier, but is currently being sold only in China
 penrin kor merom kor evam intel ke pentium dul-kor microprocessron kii mobile shrinkhalaa ke 45 nanometer sanskaran kaa parvarti he
 In this the FSB is increased from 667 mhz to 800 mhz and the voltage is reduced
 intel ne pratham penrin aadhaarit pentium dul-kor, T4200 disambar 2008 main jari kiya
 Later, mobile Pentium T4000, SU2000 and SU4000 processors based on Penryn were sold in the market as Pentium
 2010 ke aarambh main pentium dul-kor brands band ho chukaa he evam iskaa sthaan pentium naam ne le liya he
 The desktop E6000 series and oem-only mobile Pentium SU2000 and all later models were always called Pentiums, but processors with desktop Pentium dual-core E2000 and E5000 series had to be renamed
 yadhyapi pentium naam kaa upyog karte hue, desktop pentium dul-kor kor microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he, jise apane vishesh lakshan kii pentium d se tulana karne ke samay spasht rup se dekha ja saktaa he, jo sarvapratham pentium 4 main vyavhaar kiye gaye net barst microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he
 Shared L2-cache of 2 or 4 megabytes supported Core 2 Duo, the desktop Pentium dual-core has a shared L2 cache of 1 or 2 megabytes
 iske vipareet, pentium d processron main yaa to 2 yaa 4 mabibite kaa gaiyr saajha L2 cash hota he
 Additionally, the fastest speed clock Pentium d has a factory limit of 3
73 ghz, while the fastest speed clock desktop Pentium dual-core reaches 3
2 ghz
 in processron ke bich ek pramukh antar yah he ki desktop pentium dul-kor processron main keval 65 wat kaa thermal dizin power hota he jabaki pentium d main yah 95 se 130 wat ke bich hota he
 Hindi essay writingism-contentious discussion seminar, symposium, writing, Hindi typing, competition, conference, conference, award ceremony hindi diwas prayek varsh 14 sitambar ko manaaya jaataa he
 On September 14, 1949, the Constituent Assembly decided with one vote that Hindi will be the official language of India
 isi mahatvapurn nirnay ke mahatv ko pratipaadit karne tathaa hindi ko har kshetra main prasaarit karne ke liye rashtrabhasha prachaar samiti, wardha ke anurodh par varsh 1953 se puure bharat main 14 sitambar ko prativarsh hindi-diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 In the year 1918, Gandhiji had asked to make Hindi language a national language in Hindi Sahitya Sammelan
 ise gandhi ji ne janamanas kii bhashaa bhi kaha tha
 This decision was taken after much deliberation on the question of the official language of independent India on 14 September 1949, which is described in section 343 of Chapter 17 of the Constitution of India as follows: yah nirnay 14 sitambar ko liya gaya, is kaaran hindi diwas ke liye is din ko shreshth mana gaya tha
 However, when it was chosen and implemented as the official language, people from non-hindi speaking states started opposing it and English too had to be given the status of official language
 is kaaran hindi main bhi angrezi bhashaa kaa prabhaav padane laga
 Many programs take place during Hindi Divas
 is din chaatr-chaatraon ko hindi ke prati sammaan or dainik vyavhaar main hindi ke upyog karne aadi kii shiksha di jaati he
 In which Hindi essay writing, debate, Hindi typing competition etc
 are held
 hindi diwas par hindi ke prati logon ko prerit karne hetu bhashaa sammaan kii shuruyaat kii gai he
 This honor will be given annually to such a personality of the country, who has made a special contribution to the use and upliftment of Hindi language among the people
 iske liye sammaan swaroop ek lakh ek hajaar rupee diye jate hai
 Many suggestions for the development and expansion of Hindi language are also obtained at many places through essay writing competition in Hindi
 lekin agle din sabhi hindi bhashaa ko bhul jate hai
 Remember the Hindi language for a few more days, for this reason Rajbhasha Week is also organized
 jisase yah kam se kam varsh main ek saptaah ke liye to rahati hi he
 It is the fourth largest language in the world after English and Chinese by number of speakers
 lekin use acchhee tarah se samajhane, padhane or likhane waalon main yah sankhya bahut hi kam he
 It is becoming even less
 iske saath hi hindi bhashaa par angreji ke shabdon kaa bhi bahut adhik prabhaav hua he or kai shabd prachlan se hat gaye or angrezi ke shabd ne uski jagah le lee he
 Due to which the possibility of extinction of language has also increased in future
 is kaaran aise log jo hindi kaa gyaan rakhte hai yaa hindi bhashaa jaanate hai, unhen hindi ke prati apane kartavya kaa bodh karwaane ke liye is din ko hindi diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he jisase ve sabhi apane kartavya kaa paalan kar hindi bhashaa ko bhavishya main vilupt hone se bachaa saken
 But both the people and the government seem indifferent to this

 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar palakkad kaa raja kosikod ke shaasha jamorine kaa hitaishi hua karata tha
 In the early 18th century they decided to separate from Zamorin and became independent
 tab jamorine ne palakkad par akraman kiya jisase bachane hetu sahaayta maangane ke liye haidar ali ke paas aae
 Hyder Ali then took advantage of the opportunity and authorized that strategic point of view in return for this assistance
 iske baad 1766 main haidar ali ne iskaa punarnirmaan bhi karavaaya
 After eleven days of war in 1784, the fort was taken under British authority by the army under Colonel Fullerton
 iske baad kosicode ke jamorine ke sainikon ne kile par akraman kar use apane adhikaar main le liya kabza kar liya, kintu 1790 main angrejon ne ise punah le liya or phir se kile ko punarnirmit kiya
 Tipu Sultan found heroism in an encounter with the British in 1799 and since then came to be known in his name
 palakkad main kile kaa nirmaan francisi abhiyantrikon ke sahyog se 1757 -1764 ke bich aarambh hua
 Hyder Ali had brought under him two new territories on which this fort was constructed for the purpose of keeping an eye
 iske alaava yahaan se palakkad or coimbattoor ke bich avaagaman par bhi niyantran evam nazar rakhi ja sakati thi
 Along with this, elephants of army troops were also kept in the grounds of the fort
 1768 main british capten wood ne kile par akraman kar adhikaar kar liya kintu aagaamee navambar main hi haidar ali ne angrejon se yuddh kar kile ko punah apane adhikaar main le liya
 In those days Palakkad was also known as Palghatcherry
 angrejon se hue yuddh main kile ko bhari kshati pahunchi thi jiskaa punaroddhar haidar ali karvaa liya
 After the death of Hyder Ali in December 1782, his son Tipu Sultan took over the reins of the state
 1783 main british karnal phularaton ke netritv main angrejon ne tipu par kadaa prahaar kiya or kile ko punah apane adhikaar main le liya, haalanki is yuddh main bhi kile ko baari kshati hui
 King Zamorin of Calicut also attacked Palakkad to assert his authority and Tipu again succeeded in freeing the fort from the British in 1788, but in a short time Colonel Stuart regained the fort in 1790 and After this, it remained under the British
 angrejon ne is kile ko apni sainik chhavnee ke liye prayog kiya or tipu ke viruddh hone vaale abhiyaanon ke liye ek mahatvapurn centre bana
 In 1792, the ongoing war between the British and Tipu Sultan was under a treaty
 iske anusaar tipu dwaara malabar ke sabhi adhikrut kshetra angrejon ko hastantarit ho gaye
 unhone palakkad kile kii san 1797 main marammat karwaai
 Even then, that fort was known as Tipu's Fort

 There is often some relation between genetics and disease
 anek rog dooshit vaataavaran tathaa paristhatiyon se utpann hote hai, kintu anek rog aise bhi hote hai jinka kaaran mata-pita se janmana praapt koi dosha hota he
 a disease is called genetic disease

 In organisms, offspring are produced by the combination of male sperm and female scrotum
 shukranu tathaa andkoshika donon main cendrakasutra rahete hai
 According to the nature of the genes located in these nucleus, the mental and physical qualities and defects of the offspring are fixed
 jin main se ek yaa kuch ke doshatpadak hone ke kaaran santan main ve hi dosha utpann ho jate hai
 Some diseases do not cause any disease, only the physical organization of the progeny is such that certain types of diseases are produced in it
 isliye yah nishchit jaananaa ki rog kaa kaaran anuvanshikta he yaa pratikul vaataavaran, sarvada saadhy nahin he
 There are other difficulties in the correct calculation of genetic diseases
 udaahranarth; bahut se janmajaat rog adhik aayu ho jane par hi prakat hote hai
 On the other hand, some genetically defective children die as soon as they are born

 Some diseases occur in far greater numbers than girls
 anuvanshik rogon ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 Some of these are the following: tirodhayak jin ke dosha se motiyobind, ati nikatadrushti, glocoma, dirghadrushti ityadi rog hote hai
 Disease, astigmatism, keratoconus, etc
 diseases occur due to the lost gene
 lingagrathit jin janit chakshurogon main, jo purushon main adhik hote hai, varnandhta, dinaandhta, rataundhi ityadi rog hai
 In these, more than one hundred genetic diseases have been counted
 inamen psorisis, ikthiasis, keratosis ityadi pramukh hai
 Overgrowth, ejaculata, multiple types of camouflage, non-proper development of bones, dislocation of the forehead from birth, etc
 hemophilia, vishesh prakaar kii raktaheenata ityadi

 Consolidation work was first started in Punjab in the year 1920
 sarkari sangrakshan main sahakaari samitiyon kaa nirmaan hua, taaki chakbandi kaa kaary aichhik aadhaar par kiya ja sake
 The experiment was general: successful, but it was considered necessary that the Punjab Consolidation Act be passed in 1936, by which the officers should be empowered to decide the differences between the scheme and the tenants
 1928 main "royal kamishan on agriculture in india' ne, jise iskaa adhikaar nahin tha ki vah jameen kii milkiyat main koi parivartan kare, yah sanstuti kii ki anya praanton main bhi chakbandi grahan kar lee jaay
 But other than the Central Provinces and Punjab, where consolidation work took place with some limited success, other provinces had very little success
 yah paaya gaya ki thode se hi ese khand the jahaan punjab kii bhoomi kii adla badali yaa chakbandi dwaara honevaali kshati kii jokham uthaane ko anicchhuk the
 After independence, the principle of voluntary acceptance in the consolidation system was practically eliminated and a new inspiration was provided
 bombai main pratham baar 1947 main paarit ek vidhaan dwaara sarkaar ko yah adhikaar praapt hua ki vah jahaan uchit samajhe, chakbandi kaary lagu kare
 The provinces that followed this practice include Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Pt
 Bengal, Bihar and Hyderabad
 prantiy sarkaron ko kendriya sarkaar dwaara bahut protsaahan praapt hua
 Consolidation expansion was organized in all the three five-year plans and in May 1957, the Indian government announced that it had agreed to provide financial assistance to a great extent for implementing the consolidation work of the states
 chakbandi kaarykram ke viksit aavesh ko is tathy se jaanchaa ja saktaa he ki jahaan march, 1956 main ant tak bharat kaa kul chakbandi kshetra 110
09 lakh acre tha vahaan march, 1960 ke ant tak badhkar 230
19 lakh acre ho gaya tathaa usee samay 131
87 lakh acre kshetra par chakbandi kaary chal rahaa tha
 But in different provinces, this work was being done in an unbalanced manner
 march, 1960 main chakbandi kiye hue kshetra kaa aadhe se bhi adhik bhaag punjab praant main sthit tha, jabaki bade praanton- jaise aadhra, madras, bengal or bihar main chakbandi kshetra yaa to bilkul shunya tha yaa naganya
 Obviously, it is not an easy task to consolidate in an area where land does not have predominantly homogeneous quality
 iske liye sadaiv bahut sankhya main prashikshit adhikari chahie
 Unfortunately the compulsory compulsion did not allow it to become more popular among the tenants and the good results that were expected were not yet achieved, but there is the apprehension that they may not be divided again after the consolidation
 isaliye kuch praanton main, udaahranarth uttar pradesh main, chakbandi kiye hue kshetra ko upbhog, vikray evam hastantaran karne se rokane ke liye vishesh niyam banaae gaye hai
 But in other provinces like Punjab, these rules have not been implemented yet and some promoters have not even considered it legally

 Increase in agricultural production: Farmers are able to use their limited resources effectively once the holdings are compacted, which has led to increase in agricultural production along with convenience in agricultural work

 Increase in agricultural mechanization: During the consolidation process, each chak gets the facility of drainage for the irrigation and transportation, which has helped farmers in crop production
