 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader

 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr

 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval

 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future

 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest

 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy

 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest

 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 To reflect their ordinary life he later wore a dhoti for the rest of his life gandhi kaa janm hindu dharm main hua, unke puure jivan main adhiktar siddhanton kii utpati hindutv se hua

 On January 25 too, he inspired people to abandon untouchability as a great sin in the context of this incident, and on January 26, at a reception organized by traders in Madura, he said that i am believing that this misfortune on us is due to untouchability
 Has come as a result of this enormity

 After this war, Burma, as a territory of India, came under the British Raj
 iske baad 1937 se, british log burma ko bharat se alag karke ek alag upnivesh ke rup main shashan karne lage
 Burma gained independence as a republic in 1948
 1879 main burma main uttaradhikaar sankat ke baad, burma se british resident ko waapas bula liya gaya tathaa deshon ke bich aadhikarik rajanyik sambandh samaapt ho gaye
 The British thought about the war as a reaction, but they did not start a war at that time due to the ongoing wars in Africa and Afghanistan
 1880 ke dashak ke dauraan, british log burma or france ke bich sthapit samparkon ke vishay main chintit hone lage
 French people came to the border of Burma in the indo-china War

 Officially these people went to collect industrial knowledge, but soon they reached Paris where they started talking to French Foreign Minister Jules Ferry

 The British reacted with diplomatic force and the French government removed Haas from there for alleged "health reasons"

 The Bombay Burma Trading Corporation was fined for showing underestimation of teak extraction from Tongu and non-payment to its employees

 The company and the British government claimed that the allegations were false and the Burmese courts are corrupt
 british logon ne burma sarkaar se maang kii ki ve is vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye britain dwaara niyukt ek madhyasth ko sweekaar karen
 When the Burmese refused, the British issued a warning on 22 October 1885

 With the acceptance of the warning, all types of real Burman independence would be ended and it would remain a nominal autonomous 'princely' state of British India
 By November 9, a practical denial of these terms reached Rangoon, upon which Mandalay's authority and the Burmese king Theob Min's relinquishment of the throne depended
 yah bhi mana ja saktaa he ki burma rajya ke vilay kaa nirnay ho chukaa tha
 At this time, beyond the fact that this country was a dense forest, and therefore completely unsuitable for military operations, the British had little knowledge of Upper Burma; But the British steamers on the Great River Highway of the Irrawaddy River had been running from Rangoon to Mandalay for many years, and it was only natural that the British expedition should be taken most rapidly and satisfactorily from the waterway directly to the capital
 In addition, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's large number of wind-powered steamers and barges were available in Rangoon, and company officials had spatial knowledge of the direction of the difficult paths of the river to the British forces

 On 16th, the artillery on both the banks was captured by land invasion, the Burmese were not ready for it, they could not resist
 However, on 17 November at Minhala, which was on the right bank of the river, a large number of Burmese forces, one after the other, captured a pagoda and a stronghold of Minhala
 nadi ke paar se kii ja rahi bambaari ke neeche british bhartiya paidal sena kii ek brigade ne hamale ko badhaate hue barmanon ko parajeet kiya tathaa isamen burman dal ke 170 log maare gaye, 276 bandi banaaye gaye tathaa iske saath hi bahut se log bhaagane ke prayaas main nadi main dub kar mar gaye
 The campaign continued for the next few days, with naval platoon and heavy artillery silencing the Burman defense lines at Nyong-yu, Pakokku and Myingyan one after the other
 haalanki, kuch sutron kaa kahana he ki burman pratirodh teevr isliye nahin tha kyonki thibow ke raksha mantri kinvon min gyi you kong, jo ki british logon ke saath sandhi karnaa chaahate the, unhone burman phujon ko british logon par akraman na karne ko kaha
 unke aadesh kaa paalan kuch burman palatnon dwaara to kiya gaya, parantu sabake dwaara nahin
 Apart from this, the British people betrayed the Burmese by their false propaganda, they made it appear as if they do not want to rule the country for a long time, their only aim is to remove King Theob from the throne and make Prince Nyong Yan the new ruler
 Have to sit on the throne
 us samay burma ke adhikansh log thibow ko uske kushasan ke kaaran pasand nahin karte the, saath hi usne tathaa uske raaj-purushon ne 1878 main uske sattarudh hote samay lagbhag sau shahi rajkumaron va rajkumariyon ko marava diya tha
 Nyong Yan was a survivor of this royal massacre and lived in British India during his exile, in fact he was dead at the time of this war

 is prakaar, burman logon ne, jo is kathith nae raja kaa swaagat kar rahe the, is hamalavar british sena kaa virodh nahin kiya
 However, when it became clear that the British would not establish the new king in Burma and that Burma had in fact lost its independence, there were strong revolts by the Burman groups, including contingents of the former Imperial Burman army, a decade
 Lasted longer than
 The role of Yoo Kong, which initially caused the Burman resistance to collapse, gave rise to a saying Yu Kong Lean Hattok, Minzet Pok
 november 26 ko jab bedaa rajdhani awa pahunch rahaa tha, raja thibow ke pratinidhi general prendergast ke paas aatmasamarpan kaa prastaav lekar pahunche; tathaa 27 taarikh ko jab nausainik jahaaj shahar ke baahar pahunch kar akraman prarambh karne vaale the, tab hi tukadiyon ko apane raja kaa hathiyaar daalane kaa aadesh praapt hua
 There were three strong forts with thousands of armed Burmans, and although most of them laid down their arms at the behest of their king, many were allowed to disintegrate with weapons; And in the coming times, they divided this group into guerrilla groups and continued this war for years
 is bich, tathaapi burma ke raja ke aatmasamarpan kii kaarywai purna ho chuki thi; tathaa 28 navambar ko yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke ek pakhwaade ke andar mandley kaa patan ho chukaa tha, tathaa raja thibow ko bandi banaaya ja chukaa tha, nadi par sthit prayek shaktishaalee kile, raja ke topakhane, hajaaron riflon, banduukon, tathaa hathiyaaron ko apane kabze main kiya ja chukaa tha

 From Mandalay, General Prendergast reached Bhamo on 28 December
 yah ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kadam tha, kyonki yah china ko ghere hue tha, jiskaa burma ke saath apane daavon or seemaa kaa vivaad tha
 Although the king was removed from the throne and he was exiled to India along with the royal family, and the entire river and capital was in the hands of the British, rebel groups took advantage of this situation and started armed resistance, Which was very difficult to stop
 burma par 1 janvari 1886 ko angrejon dwaara kabja kar liya tha
 The timing of the merger, according to critics of the war, is hard evidence of actual British intent
 lekin yah vilay is vidroh kii shuruyaat maatr thi, jo ki 1896 tak chalaa
 The final and utterly successful peacekeeping attempt was made by Sir Frederick Roberts, to do this he established a system of military police security posts spread across the country, and wherever there were incidents of rebellion, troops with small arms would arrive
 The British called for additional troops in the country, and this part of the campaign lasted for years, when this difficult and difficult task was completed

 It was led by a contingent of all arms, led by Colonel W

 biharilal yaa bihari hindi ke reeti kaal ke prasiddh kavi the
 Bihari Lal was born around 1595 in Gwalior
 ve jati ke maathur choube the
 His father's name was Keshavarai
 jab bihari 8 varsh ke the tab inke pita inhe orchha le aaye tathaa unka bachapan bundelkhand main beetaa
 His mentor was Keshavdas and his youth in-laws were spent in Mathura, as is evident from the following couplets - jaipur-naresh savai jaisingh apni nayi rani ke prem main itane duube rahete the ki ve mahal se baahar bhi nahin nikalate the or raaj-kaaj kii ore koi dhyaan nahin dete the
 Ministers and people were concerned that large, but the king was not in any strength to say something
 bihari ne yah kaary apane upar liya
 He somehow brought the following couplet to the king - is dohe ne raja par mantra jaisaa kaary kiya
 He was freed from the love loop of the queen and again took up his reign
 ve bihari kii kavy kushalta se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone bihari se or bhi dohe rachane ke liye kaha or prati dohe par ek asharfi dene kaa vachan diya
 Bihari started composing poetry in the court of Jaipur King, where he got enough money and fame
 bihari kii ekmaatr rachana satsai he
 This is a form of 'muktak' poetry
 isamen 719 dohe sankalit hai
 Certain couplets are also suspected
 sabhi dohe sundar or saraahneey hai tathaapi tanik vichaarpurvak baariki se dekhne par lagbhag 200 dohe ati utkrisht thaharte hai
 Braj language is used in 'satsai'
 brajabhasha hi us samay uttar bharat kii ek sarvamaanya tathaa sarv-kavi-sammanit grahya kavyabhasha ke rup main pratishthit thi
 Its publicity and spread had become so much that it was easily possible to come in many forms
 bihari ne ise ekarupata ke saath rakhane kaa stuty safal prayaas kiya or ise nishchit saahitiyik rup main rakh diya
 This brightened the Braj language
 satsai ko teen mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kar sakate hai- niti vishyak, bhakthi or aadhyatm bhavaparak, tathaa shriganrapaparak
 Of these, the part of the prosthesis is more
 kalachamatkaar sarvatra chaaturya ke saath praapt hota he
 Rupang beauty, beautification, hero-heroine discrimination and how, Bhava, Vilas are described in the erotic part
 nayak-nayikanirupapan bhi mukht: teen roopon main miltaa he- pratham rup main nayak krishna or nayika radha he
 Religious and philosophical ideas have been taken into account while depicting them
 isliye isamen goodharth vyanjana pradhan he, or aadhyatmik rahasy tathaa dharmamarm nihit he; dwitiya rup main radha or krishna kaa spasht ullekh nahin kiya gaya kintu unke abhas kii pradipti di gai he or kalpanaadarsh rup rauchirya rachakar adarsh chitra vicitra vyanjana ke saath prastut kiye gaye hai
 This does not give the luxury of cosmic lust in it
 tritiy rup main loksambhav nayak nayika kaa spasht chitra he
 In this too, the imagination and skill of the poet traditional character is obtained in full
 nitant loukik rup bahut hi nune or bahut hi kam he
 Efforts have been made to sort the Muktak couplets of 'satsai'
 25 prakaar ke kram kahe jate hai jinamein se 14 prakaar ke kram dekhe gaye hai, shesh 11 prakaar ke kram jin tikaaon main hai, ve praapt nahin
 But no definite order could be given
 vastut: baat yah jaan padati he ki ye dohe samay-samay par muktak rup main hi rache gaye, phir chun chunakar ekatrit kar sankalit kar die gaye
 The idea is valid only with respect to invasive couplets
 yadi 'meri bhav baadha harau' is dohe ko pratham mangalacharnatmak arthath keval radhopaasa hone kaa vichaar spasht hota he or yadi 'mor mukut kati kachhini'-is dohe ko len, to keval ek vishesh banakwali krishnamurthi hi bihari kii abhishtopasya murti mukhya thaharti hai - bihari vastut: krishnopaa the, yah spasht he
 It is clear from the view of Satsai that for the Bihari, both the miracle and the narration skills are essential and necessary in the poetry of Rasa and ornament tact
 unke dohon ko do virgon main is prakaar bhi rakh sakate hai, ek varg main ve dohe aayengen jinamein ras rauchirya kaa prabalya he or rasaatmakataa kaa hi vishesh dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 The ornamental miracle is also there, but not a special one, but it is in the form of rasa only for the sake of maturity and expression
 duusare varg main ve dohe hai jinamein rasaatmakataa ko visheshta nahin di gai varan alankaar chamatkaar or vachanachaaturi athwa kathan-kalakaushal ko hi pradhanta di gai he
 Any particular ornamentation has been successfully treated with utterances
 is prakaar dekhte hue bhi yah maananaa padataa he ki alankaar chamatkaar ko kahin nitant bhulaayaa bhi nahin gaya
 While giving raska the flourishing, even the decking skill is not allowed to fall
 is prakaar kahana chahie ki bihari rasalankarsiddh kavi the; rassiddh hi nahin
 Literally couplets are hard to put into plushness, with them justification and commitment, the four-tier miracle is only effective and helpful
 yah baat nitiparak dohon main spasht rup se milti he
 Nevertheless, Bihari has made a commendable effort of succulence in them
 aisi hi baat darshanik siddhanton or dharmik bhav marmon ke bhi prastut karne main aati he kyonki unamem apni virasata swabhaavat: rahati he
 Yet Bihari has succeeded in presenting him with Sarasata
 bhakthi ke hardik bhav bahut hi kam dohon main dikhaai padate hai
 In particular, devotion arose in Bihari's emotional heart in particular and his expression was also there
 bihari main dainya bhav kaa praadhanya nahin, ve prabhu prarthana karte hai, kintu ati hin hokar nahin
 They consider the will of God as the main one
 bihari ne apane purvavarti siddh kaviwaron kii muktak rachanaaon, jaise aaryasptshati, gathasptshati, amarukshatak aadi se mulbhaav liye hai- kahin un bhaavon ko kaat chhantakar sundar rup diya he, kahin kuch unnat kiya he or kahin jyon kaa tyon hi sa rakhaa he
 The beauty is that a successful attempt has been made to keep long gestures in a concise form leaving their mark with elegance
 'satsai' par anek kaviyon or lekhakon ne tikaayen likhin
 a total of 54 vaccines have been received mainly
 ratnakar ji kii tikaa ek prakaar se antim tikaa he, yah sarvang sundar he
 The translations of Satsai have also been done in Sanskrit, Urdu etc
 and some poets have specialized in Kundalia etc
 verses clarifying the couplets of Satsai
 anya purvaparavarti kaviyon ke saath bhavsamya bhi prakat kiya gaya he
 Some commentaries are written in Persian and Sanskrit
 tikaakaron ne satsai main dohon ke kram bhi apane apane vichaar se rakhe hai
 Also, the number of couplets is also modular
 yah nitant nishchit nahin ki kul kitne dohe rache gaye the
 It is possible that those who came to Satsai would have chosen more than 700 couples
 saare jivan main bihari ne itane hi dohe rache hon, yah sarvatha maanya nahin thahartaa
 Some critics have written their criticisms on 'satsai'
 reeti kavy se hi isaki aalochana chalati aa rahi he
 The first poets wrote couplets and verses signifying the poignant feature of Satsai
 urdu ke shaayaron ne bhi isi prakaar kiya
 As: is prakaar kii kitni hi uktiyaan prachlit hai
 Critical books on Satsai have also been written extensively
 saath hi aadhunik kaal main isaki kai tikaayen bhi prakashit hui hai
 He was specially compared to Kavivar Dev and on the one hand, Dev was tried to prove it better than Bihari
 do pustaken, 'dev or bihari' pan
 krishnavihari mishra likhit tathaa 'bihari or dev' lala bhagavanadin likhit ullekhneey hai
 The commentary titled 'bihari Ratnakar' edited by Ratnakar ji and the critical interpretation called 'kavivar Bihari' are particularly observable and authentic
 bihari kii kavita kaa mukhya vishay shringaar he
 He has described both the coincidence and disconnection aspects of makeup
 sanyog paksh main bihari ne haavbhaav or anubhavon kaa bada hi sookshm chithran kiya hai
 It contains a lot of poignancy
 sanyog kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie - Bihari's disconnection, description is very exaggerated
 yahi kaaran he ki usamen swaabhaaviktaa nahin he, virah main vyakul nayika kii durbalata kaa chithran karte hue use ghadi ke pendulum jaisaa bana diya gaya he - The nonviolent method of Sufi poets has also had a substantial impact on Bihari
 viyog kii aag se nayika kaa sharir itnaa garm he ki us par daalaa gaya gulab jal bich main hi suukh jaataa he - Bihari is basically a Shringari poet
 unki bhakthi-bhaavana radha-krishna ke prati he or vah jahaan tahaan hi prakat hui he
 This Doha of mangala-charan at the beginning of Satsai is a reflection of his devotion to Radha - bihari ne niti or gyaan ke bhi dohe likhe hai, kintu unki sankhya bahut thodi he
 See a couplet regarding wealth collection - prakruti-chithran main bihari kisi se peeche nahin rahe hai
 He has very beautiful description of six objects
 greeshm ritu kaa chitra dekhie - Bihari villagers ridicule Aristotle and say- bihari ko jyotish, vaidyak, ganit, vigyaan aadi vividh vishyon kaa bada gyaan tha
 So they have used it a lot in their couplets
 ganit sambandhi tathy se paripurna yah doha dekhie - The language of Bihari is the literary Braj language
 isamen sur kii chalati braj bhashaa kaa viksit rup miltaa he
 The words of Eastern Hindi, Bundelkhandi, Urdu, Farsai etc
 have also come in it, but they do not hang
 bihari kaa shabd chayan bada sundar or sarthak he
 Words have been used in a very favorable way and not a single word seems to be of Bharati
 bihari ne apni bhashaa main kahin-kahin muhaavaron kaa bhi sundar prayog kiya he
 like - vishay ke anusaar bihari kii style teen prakaar kii he Although examples of calm, humor, compassion etc
 are also found in Bihari's poetry, but the main rasa is adornment
 bihari ne keval do hi chand apanaae hai, doha or soratha
 Doha is the predominance of verses
 bihari ke dohe samaas-style ke utkrisht namoonay hai
 It was the work of a poet like Bihari to fill many expressions in small verses like couplets
 alankaaron kii kaarigari dikhaane main bihari bade patu hai
 Some ornamentation has come in each of their couplets
 kisi-kisi dohe main to ek saath kai-kai alankaaron ko sthaan mila he
 Exaggeration, Eloquence and Sangrupak are Bihari's special favorite ornaments
 See an example of allegorical ornaments - kisi kavi kaa yash uske dwaara rachit granthon ke pariman par nahin, gun par nirbhar hota he
 The same is with Bihari
 akele satsai granth ne unhen hindi sahitya main amar kar diya
 No one got the same reputation as Bihari Satsai in Shringar Rasa's texts
 is granth kii anek tikaaen huin or anek kaviyon ne iske dohon ko aadhaar bana kar kavitt, chappay, savaiya aadi chhandon kii rachana kii
 Bihari Satsai continues to be a poetry-debacle of the rasikas even today
 kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaas shakti ke kaaran satsai ke dohe gaagar main sagar bhare jane kii ukti charitaarth karte hai
 It is rightly said about them - apane kavy gunon ke kaaran hi bihari mahakavy kii rachana na karne par bhi mahakaviyon kii shrenee main gine jate hai

 gananaa karanevaala semafor kisi ekal sansaadhan kaa band / khulaa flag nahin, balki uplabdh sansadhano ke ek samooh kaa counter hota he
 It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra
 semafor dining philocopher samasya main res sthitiyon ko rokane kaa clasik samaadhaan hai, haalanki ve sansaadhan gatirodh ko nahin rokte hai
 Access to the semaphore is possible using the following functions
 jinhen atomic ke rup main chinhit kiya gaya ho unhen vyavdhaan utpann nahin kiya janaa chahie, iske kaaran neeche spasht kiye gaye hai
 p / / Acquire Resource {wait until s> 0, then s: = s-1; / * Testing and decrementing s must be atomic to avoid race conditions * / } v / / Release Resource{s := s+1; / *must be atomic* / } Init {s: = v;} dhyaan den ki veriable s kii vruddhi ko baadhit nahin kiya janaa chahie tathaa s kaa maan 0 se bada praapt hone par kaary p main vyavdhaan utpann nahin kiya janaa chahie
yah ek vishesh nirdesh, jaise test-and-set, ke prayog dwaara, athwa anya prakriyaaon ko sakriy hone se rokane ke liye vyavadhaanon ko upekshit karke kiya ja saktaa he
 The value of a semaphore is equal to the number of empty units in the resource
 kaary p vyast-pratiksharat rahata he yaa shaayad tab tak soya rahata he, jab tak ki koi sansaadhan uplabdh na ho jaae or phir turant ek sansaadhan par daawa karata he
 v is the opposite; It only provides resources once the process has finished using the resource
 Init kaa prayog koi bhi nivedan kiye jane se pehle semafor ko keval praarambhik maan pradaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Tasks p and v must be atomic, which means that no process should ever be interrupted to perform any other task on the same semaphore
 aupchaarik naamon, p or v kii utpatti dach shabdon ke pratham aksharon se hui he
 v means verhogen, or "growth"
 Various interpretations are given for P, including "passeer for", "effort" probeer, and "catch" pakken), but in fact Dijkstra wrote that his intentions from p are built- The word was prolaag, which is an abbreviation for probeer te verlagen, or "try-and-subtract,"
 This confusion arises due to the fact that in the Dutch language the word v is used for both increase and decrease
 Begin with these words and complete these words The use of the noun form would be impossibly misleading for non-dutch-speakers
 programing bhashaa ALGOL 68 main, linaks karnel main tathaa kuch angreji pathyapustakon main kaaryon, p or v ko, kramash: down tathaa ap kaha jaataa he
 In software engineering, they are often called wait and signal, or acquire and release, or pend and post
 mul dach adyaksharon se milan karne ke liye kuch pustakon main inhen procure tathaa vacate kaha jaataa he
 Semaphores can have an associated queue of processes to avoid busy-waiting
 If a process performs a p function on a semaphore whose value is zero, this process is added to the semaphore's queue
 jab koi anya prakriya v kaary karke semafor ko badhaati he or kyuu main prakriyaayein upasthit hai, to unamem se ek ko kyuu se hataa diya jaataa he or uskaa kriyanvayan pun: prarambh hota he
 When the priorities of the processes are different, the cue can be placed in order of priority, so that the process with the highest priority is taken first from the cue
 mana ki 'sansaadhan' saarvajanik prashaadhan-grih ke shauchalay hai tathaa shauchalayon kaa abhigaman chaahane vaali 'prakriyaayein' yaa to ve log hai, jo ek qatari main khadey hokar kisi bhi shauchalay ke uplabdh hone kii pratiksha kar rahe hai, athwa ve log hai, jo pehle se hi shauchalay kaa prayog kar rahe hai
 The person sitting outside the toilet takes care of how many toilets are available at this time and who should go inside after that
 rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya semafor kaa maan he, jo uplabdh rikt sansadhano kii sankhya bataata he
 When a process wants to access the toilet, the semaphore will tell it that it will have to wait in a queue or that it can use the toilet
 yadi shauchalay rikt he to us vyakti ko abhigam praapt hota he or rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya main se 1 kam kar diya jaataa he 
iskaa arth yah hua ki rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya 1 kam ho gai he
 If the number of empty toilets is 0, then the person will have to wait in the queue until it becomes empty
 Once the person uses the toilet, the next person can use it
 iskaa arth yah he ki rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya main ab 1 kii vruddhi ho gai he 
ab s kaa maan 0 se bada ho gaya he tathaa pratiksha kar rahaa vyakti ab shauchalay kaa abhigaman kar saktaa he
 The process of demanding available toilets, updating the number of vacant toilets and waiting in a queue should not be interrupted by any other process
 This is called atomic work
 yah qatari ek first-in first-out kyuu he, jiskaa arth yah he ki qatari main sabase pehle khadey vyakti ko rikt shauchalay ke prayog kaa avasar sabase pehle milegaa
haalanki yadi qatari main kisi anya sthaan par khadaa vyakti shauchalay kaa prayog tatkaal karnaa chahta he, to qatari ko vyavasthit kiya ja saktaa he
 The concept of counting semaphores can be expanded by the ability to demand or return more than one 'unit' from the semaphore
 vastut: UNIX semafor isi prakaar kaary karata he
 Modified p and v functions are conducted as follows: P{wait until s >= howmany;s:=s - howmany; / *must be atomic operation* / } v {s: = s + howmany; / * must be atomic * / } is baat ko samajhane ke liye ki yah p ke saral sanskaran ko 'howmany' baar kol karne se behatar kyon he, nimna samasya par vichaar karen
ham yah maan lete hai ki aapke paas n sansadhano kaa ek sangrah he, jise ham nishchit aakaar vaala bafer kahenge
sambhavat: aap uplabdh babers kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye ek counting semafor kaa prayog karnaa chahenge, jise n dwaara inishlise kiya gaya ho
jab koi prakriya ek bafer aavantit karnaa chaahati he, to vah semafor par p ko kol karti he or ek bafer praapt karti he
 If no buffers are available, one process waits until another process frees a buffer and calls v on the semaphore
 yah maane ki do prakriyaayein hai, jo kramash: babers KN ho
 iskaa saral kriyanvayan yah hoga ki pehali prakriya p ke saral ghataav roopantaran ko semafor par k baar kol karegi or yah duusari prakriya dwaara p ke saral ghataav roopantaran ko semafor par l baar kol karaayegi
haalanki, is paddati ke falswaroop gatirodh utpann ho saktaa he: kalpana karen ki oparating system pehali prakriya ko kriyanvit hone kii anumati detaa he
 Then, when the first process has taken control of only the z buffers, the operating system stops the first process to give the second process execution time
 duusari prakriya babers ko praapt karnaa shuru karti he
 However, when the second process receives buffers, the semaphore becomes 0 and the second process is suspended until another process releases some more buffers
 Finally, the operating system first buffers the rest of the process that it needs, Allows for the resumption to proceed
 durbhaagya se, chunki semafor 0 he, atah pehali prakriya is kaary ko purna nahin kar sakati, at: yah bhi kisi anya prakriya dwaara or adhik babers mukt kiye jane kii pratiksha karte hue nilambit ho jaati he
 Neither the first nor the second process can obtain enough buffers to continue the work and so neither of the two processes returns any buffer to the collection
 Thus, they are stuck in a deadlock situation
 semafor ke sanshodhit sanskaran main, pehali prakriya k babers kii maang karegi, jo use ek atomic kaary ke dwaara praapt hongi, jiske baad semafor main N-K ikaiyaan shesh rah jaaengi
tab duusari prakriya aegi, jo semafor ko N-K-L tak ghataaegi or chunki yah ek rinatmak sankhya he, at: pratiksha karegi
jab pehali prakriya babers ko mukt karti he or semafor ko badhaati he, tab jaise hi semafor 0 par pahunchataa he, to iskaa arth yah he ki sangrah main l tatv uplabdh hai, duusari prakriya prarambh ho sakati he or iske sabhi babers praapt kar sakati he
 It should be noted that the semaphore counts do not necessarily equal the number of buffers available in the collection
 p main do baar S>=0 shart ko jaanchana or iske liye pratiksha karnaa is baat kii guarantee dene ke liye aavashyak he ki semafor kii pratiksha suchi main judati jane vaali vibhinn prakriyaayein ek duusare ke nivednon main baadha utpann na karatin: ek prakriya tab tak semafor kii gananaa ko nahin badalati, jab tak ki vah kyuu main agali prakriya na ho
vaastavik karyanvayan main yah kaary madhyavarti charan ke liye pratiksha prakriya ko yatharth main sakriy kiye bina kiya jaataa he
 The use of semaphores is still practiced today in programming languages that do not intrinsically support other forms of synchronization
 They are the primary mechanisms of synchronization in many operating systems
 haalanki, programing bhashaaon ke vikaas kaa jhukaav sinchroniteeshan ke adhik sanrachit roopon kii ore he, jaise monitor 
 semafar gatirodhon se nibatane kii apni aparyaaptta ke saath hi ek prakriya dwaara pehle hi liye ja chuke semafor ko dubaara lene or liye ja chuke semafor ko mukt karnaa bhul jane jaisi galatiyon se bhi programmer ko nahin bachaate
 Since semaphores are associated with a calculation, they can be used when multiple threads need to work together to achieve an objective
 Consider this example: counting semafor ke alaava, ek "blocking semafor" bhi hota he
 a blocking semaphore is a semaphore that is initialized to 0
 iskaa prabhaav yah he ki koi bhi aisa thread, jo semafor par p kaary karata ho, vah avaruddh ho jaataa he
 The use of semaphores usually requires hardware support to guarantee the molecularity of the functions that require it
 The computer languages of the computer typically include instructions that are specifically designed to take care of semaphores

 ye vishesh nirdesh memory main ek padhein-badalen-likhen chakra ko puraa karte hai, jo na keval vyavdhaan utpann na kiye ja sakane yogya hota he, balki kisi bhi anya procesar yaa input / output upkaran dwaara memory main usee sthaan par kiye ja rahe anya sabhi kaaryon ko hataa bhi detaa he
 Special instructions guarantee that using them a semaphore method can test and transform a semaphore into a single, atomic task
 ek mutex ek binary semafor hota he, jisamen saamanyat: swaamitv athwa praathamikta vyutkraman sangrakshan jaisi atirikt visheshtaayen shaamil hoti hai
 Differences in mutex and semaphore depend on the operating system
 mutex kaa prayog keval parsparik apvarjan main karnaa abhisht he tathaa binary semaforce ghatana kii adhisuchana or parsparik apvarjan, donon main prayog ke liye banaae gaye hai

 eäò¶é ́é Aesthetics is the study of sensory-emotional qualities — religion and values
 kala, samskruti or prakruti kaa pratankan hi saundaryashastra he
 Aesthetics is a part of philosophy
 ise soundaryamimasaa tatha anandamimasaa bhi kehete hai
 Beauty is the scripture in which there is an elemental, philosophical and poignant interpretation of the beauty that is expressed or contained in artistic works, creations etc
 kisi sundar vastu ko dekhakar hamaare man main jo anandadaayini anubhuti hoti he uske swabhaav or swaroop kaa vivechan tathaa jivan kii anyaanya anubhutiyon ke saath uskaa samanvay sthapit karnaa inkaa mukhya uddeshy hota he
 Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy under which questions related to art, literature and beauty are discussed
 gyaan ke daayre se bhinn indriya-bodh dwaara praapt hone vaale taatparyon ke liye unani bhashaa main 'astetiko' shabd he jisase 'esthetics' kii vyutpatti hui
 a classical aesthetical approach related to nature, art, and literature developed
 yah nazariyaa keval kriti kii sundarata or kala-rup se hi apana sarokaar rakhte hue uske raajnneetik or sandarbhagat ayaamon ko vimarsh ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 But there are also some methods of brainstorming art and literature that communicate the meaning of works and social and historical aspects of their creation process
 marxvaadi saundaryashastra ek aisa hi vimarsh he
 Plato's work in ancient Greek philosophy discusses the concept of beauty in Hippias Major
 naatak kii dukhaant style par arestu dwaara apni rachana poitics main kiye gayi vichaar ne kala-aalochana ko lambe arase tak prabhavit kiya he
 In the context of non-western ancient thinking on art and beauty, the Natyashastra of India, Abhinavagupta's rasa-siddhanta and the creation of Chinese scholar Cheng Yin-yuwan, Li-tai ming-hua Chi's unique and elaborate discussions presented in the Western world as well is believed
 kala-anushilan kii is parampara kii vyakhya karne ke gair-pashchimi maanak abhi tak nahin ban paye hai or pashchimi maanakon ke zariye kii gayi vyakhyaaon ke nattejey asantoshjanak nikle hai
 a separate concept of aesthetics emerged as a philosophical activity in Western thought in the eighteenth century when art works began to be isolated from handcrafts
 iskaa nateeja siddhantkaron dwaara lalit kala kii avadharana ke sutrikaran main niklaa
 Alexander Gottlieb Bomgarthen wrote an esthetica in 1750 to initiate a debate
 iske saat saal baad david hum dwaara ‘of da standard of test’ likh kar saundaryashastra ke ubharate hue vimarsh ko prashnaankit kiya gaya
 But the real beginning of modern European aesthetic aesthetics began with Emmanuel Kant's work published in 1790, Critique of Judgment
 apni is kriti main kaant ne saundaryashastreey akalan kii kasautiyon ko saarvbhaum banane par jor diya
 But on the other hand, he appeared to be skeptical of the possibility of any kind of universal aesthetics
 is virodhabhas ke baavjood kaant kii uplabdhi yah rahi ki unhone kala or saundarya kii vivechna ke liye kuch anivaary dvibhajanon ko sthapit kar diya
 The most notable of these dialects are: sense perception and logic, essence and form, expression and expression, pleasure and epiphany, freedom and necessity, etc
 kaant kii duusari uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone saundaryashastreey anubhav or andrik anubhav ke bich antar sthapit kiya
 He said that aesthetics should be interpreted and concluded without any practical attachment to the goal of analysis
 unnisvin sadi ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he ki vah saundaryashastra kii shatabdi thi
 It was only on Kant's land that German scholars later created a larger philosophical framework of aesthetics
 higel ne apni rachana lectures on esthetics main, shoppenhor ne da world ez vil and ripragentation main or nitshe ne berth of tragedy main pashchimi saundaryashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon kii baarik vyakhyaayein kin or uske naye ayaamon ko prakashit kiya
 Formalism emerged in English-speaking aesthetics in the late nineteenth century
 victoriayan britain ne ‘kala kala ke liye’ kaa naaraa diya jiske pravaktaaon main auskar wild kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The stylistic approach emphasizing purely aesthetic experience deeply influenced modern art forms in almost all fields
 lekin is andolan ke virodh kii dhvaniyaan mahaan roosi sahityakar liyo tolstoy kii rachana whot iz art? or america parinamwad ke pramukh pravaktaa jon divi kii kriti art ez experience main sunaayi deen
 Tolstoy argued that art that cannot communicate moral sensations among humans, however great it may be in terms of metaphorical criteria, cannot be appreciated
 divi ne bhi sampreshan kii bhoomika ke sawaal par rupvaad se loha lete hue kala ko saundaryashastra ke naam par uske daayre ke baahar maujuud anubhav kii sanrachanaon se kaat kar rakhane kaa virodh kiya
 The German tradition of aesthetic thinking continued into the twentieth century as well
 ghatnakriyashastra, vyakhyashastra or marxvad ke auzaaron kaa istemaal karke saundaryashastra sambandhi siddhanton ko or samrudh kiya gaya
 In 1936 Martin Heidegger wrote an essay like 'the Origin of the Work of Art' which is considered one of the best works of philosophy of art
 haidagar ne is niabandh main daawa kiya ki kala-kriti ko is jagat main sthit vastu ke rup main dekhnaa aadhuniktaa kii moolbhoot lakshanik trutiyon main se ek he
 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
