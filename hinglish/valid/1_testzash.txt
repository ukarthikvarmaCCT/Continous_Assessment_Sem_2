 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih

 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi

 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai

 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 These successful experiments of tiger haven also led to allegations of Billy spreading genetic pollution in tigers of Dudhwa
 tara baghin jo englad se laakar dudhwa main punervasit hui vah siberian va royal bengal kii sankar nasl sabit hui
 The tiger does not have any sub-species, they live in different geographical conditions, they have physical development, they are considered different in the race, such as homo-sapiens, whether they are Africans or Indians, they breed among themselves
 Doing it does not have any kind of genetic pollution

 It is generally believed that this script stems from another ancient Indian script, Brahmi

 "pallava Granth", another version of this script, used by the Pallava people, was also called the "pallava script"
 kai dakshin bhartiya lipiyaan, jese ki burma kii mon lipi, indonesia kii jawai lipi or khmer lipi isi sanskaran se upjin
 Now, the Devanagari script is often used to write Sanskrit, but in the Tamil-speaking regions of South Asia until the 19th century the script was used to write Sanskrit
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki 5veen sadi main vaidic pustakon ko pehali baar likhane ke liye granth lipi kaa prayog hua tha
 In the early 20th century, Devanagari was used in place of scripture in religious and scholarly texts, and Tamil script with special markings in common folk-centered publications
 granth lipi kaa prayog tamil-sanskrit manipravalam likhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha, yah tamil or sanskrit ke mishran se bani ek bhashaa he jiskaa prayog sanskrit ke lekhon kii tikaa ke liye hota he
 It evolved into a more complex writing system, with Tamil words written in Tamil Vattelutu and Sanskrit words written in scripture

 As the popularity of Manipravalam declined, the use of this writing style diminished, but this tradition continued in the printed versions of books originally written in Manipravalam until the mid-20th century

 Nowadays, two versions are used: Brahmani, or square and Jain, or Gol

 It is possible that the modern Tamil script also came from the text itself, but it is not known for sure

 There is a lot of similarity between the modern Tamil script and the script, the letters of Mahaprana Aghosha, Alprana Ghosh and Mahapraana Ghosh in Tamil have been omitted
 inhen bhi dekhen: tamil lipi The script can be classified as follows: pracheen va alankarik granth ko pallav granth kaha jaataa he

 The inscriptions of Mahabalipuram, the rock cut caves of Tiruchirappalli and the Kailashant inscriptions fall into this category

 The later Pallavas and the inscriptions of Pandian Nedunchezian are also examples of the script of this style

 This style was practiced from 950 CE to 1250 CE

 The absence of the vowel of a is indicated by the halant: anya vyanjanon ke liye matraaon kaa istemaal hota he: Sometimes conjuncts can be formed by mixing consonants and quantities, such as: kahin kahin par halant ke saath vyanjan ke liye alag banaavat kaa prayog bhi he: There are two types of consonants related conjuncts in the book

 bharat kii panchayat raaj pranali main gaanv yaa chote kasbe ke str par gram panchayat yaa gram sabha hoti he jo bharat ke sthaneey swashaasan kaa pramukh avyav he
 The sarpanch is the elected supreme representative of the gram sabha
 pracheen kaal se hi bharatvarsh ke saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik jivan main panchayat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan rahaa he
 Every aspect of public life was governed by this
 vaidic kaal main bhi panchayaton kaa astitv tha
 The head of the village was called Gramani
 uttar vaidic kaal main bhi yah hota tha jiske madhyam se raja gram par shashan karata tha
 The "village elders" were included in the Buddhist village councils
 inke pramukh ko "grambhojak" kehete the
 The council or panchayat used to arrange the land of the village and help the village collector in maintaining peace and security in the village
 janhit ke anya kaaryon kaa sampadan bhi vahi karti thi
 Panchayat is also mentioned in Smriti texts
 kautilya ne gram ko raajnneetik ikai mana he
 The "grammarian" of "economics" was the head of the village, which had so many rights
 apane saarvajanik kartavyon ko puraa karne main vah gramvaasiyon kii sahaayta letaa tha
 Cooperation of villagers in other public interest works was also desirable
 gram kii ek saarvajanik nidhi bhi hoti thi jisamen jurmaane, dand aadi se dhan aata tha
 Thus the rights and duties of the Gramikas and Grampanchayats were included, whose violation was punishable

 He ruled the village with the help of "panchamandal" or Panchayat
 "gramvriddh" is panchayat ke sadsy hote the
 Harsha also adopted this system
 uske samay main rajya "bhukti", "vishay" or "gram" main vibhakt tha
 The Madhuban inscription of Harsha mentions Samakundaka village which was under the theme "kundaghani" and "ahichhatra" Bhukti
 grampramukh ko graamic kehete the
 The Chola and North Mallur inscriptions of the ninth and tenth centuries show that there was a panchayat system in the south as well
 graamy swashaasan kaa vikaas chol shashan kii mukhya visheshta thi
 These communal governance units were called "kurrum", which included several villages
 kurrum ek swaitshasi ikai thi
 Governance was vested in a Mahasabha, the people of the district village were elected and the assembly used to run the work of governance through its committees
 is prakaar kii aath samitiyaan thim jo janhit ke vibhinn kaaryon ko karne ke atirikt shanti or suraksha banaae rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi thim
 She also used to do justice related work
 gram puri tarah swaitshasi tha or is prakaar kendriya shashan anek dayitvon se mukt rahata tha
 Some kind of panchayat system continued in Muslim and Maratha periods too, and each village remained self-supporting
 angreji shasankaal main panchayat-vyavastha ko sabase adhik dhakka pahunchaa or vah yah vyavastha chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Nevertheless, Panchayats remained in the social life of the villages
 prayek jati athwa varg kii apni alag-alag panchayatein thim jo uske saamaajik jivan ko niyantrit karti thim or panchayat kii vyavastha evam niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaale ko kathor dand diya jaataa tha
 The government did not interfere in the actions of these panchayats
 aarambh se hi angrejon kii niti yah rahi ki shashan kaa kaam, yathasambhav, adhikadhik rajya karmchaariyon ke haathon main hi rahe
 As a result, due to the establishment of foreclosure and civil courts, new revenue policy, policing, development of means of swapping, etc
, the self-reliant life and local autonomy of the villages gradually ended
 parantu aage chalakar angrejon ne bhi yah anubhav kiya ki unki kendrikaran kii niti se shashanbhaar din prati din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the demand for autonomous governance was also increasing due to national awakening
 atev unhen vikendrikaran kii disha main kadam uthaane ko baadhya hona padaa
 Initially district boards and municipal boards were established
 san 1907 ke vikendrikaran sambandhi shahi kamishan ne panchayaton ke mahatv ko swikar kiya or apni report main likhaa ki kisi bhi sthaayee sanghathan kii neenv, jisase janata kaa sakriy sahyog prashasan ke saath ho, graamon main hi honi chahie
 The commission recommended that in a few selected villages, which are free from mutual penalties and quarrels, panchayats should be established and initially given limited powers
 tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne 1915 i
 main kamishan kii siforeeshon ko siddhantat: to swikar kar liya parantu vyavhaar main unki purnataya upeksha kii gai
 Panchayats were formed in very few villages; Those who remained were also fully controlled by the government
 bharat sarkaar ke 1919 main adhinium ke anusaar prantiy sarkaron ko swashaasan ke kuch adhikaar die gaye or 1920 ke aasapaas sabhi praanton main gram panchayat adhinium banaae gaye
 About 4700 gram panchayats were established in the United States under the Panchayat Act of 1920

 They are maximum Rs 200
 Could take cases related to movable property and Rs
 50 in criminal cases
 Could be fined till
 inaki aay kaa mukhya saadhan jurmaana yaa daan tha
 But the reality was that these panchayats were totally ineffective compared to the ancient panchayats, their panches were nominated by the government without being elected by the people and their economic condition was bad due to lack of income
 duusari ore rashtriya andolan ke karnadhaar yah anubhav karte the ki gaanvon kaa aarthik or naitik patan keval panchayaton kii pun: sthapana dwaara hi roka ja saktaa he
 In the Dasutri program for Gandhi's villages, the main thing was to strengthen the panchayats
 ve panchayaton ko swantatra bharat kii shashanvyavastha kii aadharshila bananaa chaahate the
 This was the norm in 1937 in front of the Congress governments established in seven provinces
 uttar pradesh main anek graamon main jeevansudhar samitiyaan banaai gai jinhen gramvikas ke kaary saunpe gaye
 Thus until 1947 AD, there was lack of proper panchayat system in the villages
 swatantraprapti ke pashchaat is vyavastha ko punerjeevit karne ke sakriy prayaas aarambh hue
 Panchayat Raj Act was enacted in Uttar Pradesh in 1947
 samvidhan ke antargat "raajnneeti ke nideshak tatwon" main rajya kaa yah pramukh kartavya batalaaya gaya ki "vah gram panchayaton kaa sanghathan karne ke liye agrasar ho" tathaa "unako aisi shaktiyaan or adhikaar pradaan kare jo unhen swytt shashan kii ikaayiyon ke rup main kaary karne yogya banane ke liye aavashyak hon"
 According to this directive, steps were taken to implement the panchayat system in each state and a panchayat was established in each village or village group
 panchayat ke sadasyon kaa chunaav gaanv ke matadhikarprapt vyaktiyon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Gram Panchayats arrange village cleanliness, lighting, roads, dispensaries, wells cleaning and repair, public land, penetration, markets and fairs and pastures, accounts for births, deaths and farming, advancement of industries and businesses, diseases Also maintains cremation and cemeteries
 vriksharopan, pashuvansh kaa vikaas, gramsuraksha ke liye gramsevak dal kaa gathan, sahakaarita kaa vikaas, akaal peedito kii sahaayta, pulon or puliyon kaa nirmaan, skulon or aspataalon kaa sudhaar aadi inke aichhik kartavya hai
 Nyaya Panchayats are the other part of the panchayat system in the villages
 graamon main mukademebaaji kam karne tathaa janata ko sasta nyaay sulabh banane kii drushti se nyaay panchayaton kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 They have been given some rights in civil, criminal and goods matters
 prayek rajya main panchayaton ke adhikaar or daayitv newnaadhik rup se samaan he
 More steps have been taken towards fully implementing the decentralization regime
 panchayaton ke adhikaron or kartavyon kaa kshetra vistrut ho rahaa he
 In this way gram panchayats have again become an integral part of the life of our country

 aabhaar shabd kii vyutpatti latin shabd gratia se hui he jo kritagyata, shaleenta or krupa shabdaawalee se sambandhit he
 This Latin root word refers to "mercy, generosity and the beauty of giving and receiving gifts"
 aabhaar kaa anubhav aitihaasik rup se duniya ke vibhinn dharmon kaa centre bindu rahaa he, or adam smith jaise naitik darshanikon dwaara is par vyapak rup se vichaar kiya gaya he
 The systematic study of gratitude in psychology only began around the year 2000, presumably because traditionally psychology has focused more on the understanding of positive emotions than on understanding distress
 lekin, sakaaratmak manovigyaan chalan ke aagaman ke saath, aabhaar manovaigyanik anusandhan kaa mukhya centre bindu ban gaya he
 The study of gratitude under psychology emphasizes the short-term experience of gratitude, individual differences in how people often feel gratitude, understanding and the relationship between these two aspects
 aabhaar ek bhaavana he jo sahaayta milane ke baad logon ke madhya, is aadhaar par ki ve kis tarah sthiti kii vyakhya karte hai, utpann hoti hai
 Particular gratitude is experienced when the person receiving the help is valued, valued by their philanthropist, and given by the philanthropist with generous intentions
 jab aisi samaan sthitiyon kaa saamana karnaa pade jahaan unhone sahaayta pradaan kii ho, to alag alag log mulya, laagat or udaar iraadon ke sandarbh main sthiti ko alag alag tareeke se dekhte hai or yah bataata he ki sahaayta praapt hone ke baad log aabhaar kaa str bhinn kyon mahasoos karte hai)
 jo log aam taur par jivan main adhik aabhaar anubhav karte hai ve adatan sahaayta kii vyakhya adhik bahumoolya, adhik laabhadaayak or adhik laabhadaayak rup se abhisht ke rup main karte hai; or yah abhyast pakshpaat yah bataata he ki kyon kuch log dusron kii tulana main adhik kritagyata mahasoos karte hai
 Gratitude is not the same as indebtedness
 jabaki donon bhavanaaen sahaayta ke baad prakat kii jaati he, ringrastata tab prakat hoti he jab ek vyakti yah maanata he ki uskaa daayitv he ki vah sahaayta hetu mili muaavje kii kuch chukauti kare
 bhavanaaen vibhinn bhaavon kii ore agrasar karti hai: ringrastata sahaayta ke praptakarta ko sahaayta karne vaale vyakti se bache rahane ke liye prerit karti he, jabaki aabhaar praptakarta ko apane sangrakshakon kii talash karne or unke saath apane rishte main sudhaar hetu prerit karata he
 Future of gratitude patrons may also help to reinforce social behavior
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek prayog main paaya gaya ki ek gahane kii dukaan main graahakon ko bulaakar dhanyavad kehane se kharid main 70% vruddhi hui
 If compared, the customers who were thanked and told about the sale saw only a 30% increase in their purchases and the customers who were not called did not see any increase in their purchases
 ek anya adhyayan main paaya gaya ki ek restaurant ke niyamit graahak us samay zyada badi bakhshish dete hai jab sarwar unke check par "dhanyavad" likhte hai
 The relationship between spirituality and gratitude has recently become a popular subject of study
 jabaki ye do visheshtaayen nishchit rup se ek duusare par nirbhar nahin hai, adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki aadhyatmikta ek vyakti kii abhaari hone kii kshamta ko badhaane main sakasham he, isliye ve vyakti jo niyamit rup se dharmik sevaaon main bhaag lete hai yaa dharmik gatividhiyon main sanlagn rahete hai un vyaktiyon main jivan ke sabhi kshetron main aabhaar kii zyada adhik bhaavana hone kii 0nn1nsambhaavna he
 Gratitude has been seen as a valuable human trait in Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu traditions
 aise dharmon main bhagwaan ke prati aabhaar prakat karte hue puja karnaa ek aam baat he or isliye aabhaar kii avadharana dharmik granthon, shikshaaon or paramparaon main vyaapt he
 For this reason, it is one of the most common feelings that religions seek to instill and sustain among their followers and is considered a universal religious sentiment
 yahudee dharm main, aabhaar puja ke kaary kaa ek anivaary hissaa he or ek pujari ke jivan ke har pahalu kaa ek hissaa he
 According to the Hebrew worldview, all things came from God and because of this, gratitude is very important to followers of Judaism
 hebrew dharmagranth aabhaar ke vichaaron se purit hai
 The two examples included in the hymn are "O my God, i will thank you forever" and "I will give thanks to God with all my heart"
 Jewish prayer also often involves gratitude beginning with Shema, where worshipers complemented by gratitude say "you must love God with all your heart, soul and strength, eternal"
 Elinu, the concluding prayer, also speaks of thanking God for the special fate of the Jewish people
 in prarthanaaon ke saath saath, shraddhalu bhakt dinabhar sau se bhi adhik aashirwadon kaa vyaakhyaan karte hai jinhen berakhots kehete he
 It has been said that gratitude molds and gives shape to the entire Christian life
 isai dharmasudharak, martin luther, ne aabhaar ko "mul isai pravriti" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya he or aaj bhi ise "isa charit kaa dil" kaha jaataa he
 Since every Christian believes that they were created by an individual God, Christians are strongly encouraged to praise and thank their creator
 isai aabhaar main, bhagwaan ko sabhi acchhee chizon ke niswaarth daata ke rup main dekha jaataa he or is vajah se, vahaan ringrastata kii ek mahaan bhaavana he jo isaayiyon ko ek aam band share karne ke liye sakasham banaata he, jisase ek anuyaayi ke jivan ke sabhi pahaluon ko aakaar diya jaataa he
 Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgment of God's generosity that motivates Christians to build their own thoughts and actions around such ideals
 bas ek bhavuk bhaavana ke bajaay, isai aabhaar ko ek naitik gun mana jaataa he jo keval bhaawanaaon or vichaaron kaa hi nahin balki saath hi karm or kaaryon kaa bhi vikaas karata he
 According to 17th century theologian preacher and theologian Johann Edwards, one of his treatises on religious attachment love has gratitude and gratitude to God as characteristic of true religion
 is vyakhya ke kaaran, dharmik aadhyatmikta ke aadhunik upayon main parameshwar kii ore aabhaar or kritagyata kaa akalan shaamil he
 Alport has suggested that mature religious intentions stem from feelings of deep gratitude, and Edwards has claimed that "attachment" to gratitude is the best way to find God's presence in a person's life
 samuels or lester dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan kaa yah tark tha ki catholic bhaktinon or yajkon ke ek chote namoonay main 50 bhaawanaaon main bhagwaan ke prati aabhaar or pyaar kii bhaavana ko sabase adhik anubhav kiya gaya tha
 The Islamic holy book, the Quran is complemented by thoughts of gratitude
 yahudee or isai dharm kii paramparaon kii tarah, islam apane anuyaayiyon ko sabhi paristhitiyon main abhaari hone or parameshwar kaa dhanyavad karne ke liye protsaahit karata he
 Islamic teaching gives importance to the idea that those who are grateful will be rewarded
 a traditional Islamic says that "those who glorify God in all circumstances will be called heaven first" in Sura 14 of the Quran also states that those who are grateful will be given more by God
 Prophet Mohammad has also said, "the gratitude you have received for abundance is the best assurance that abundance will continue
" Many essential practices of Islamic faith also encourage gratitude
 dainik prarthana ke liye aahvaan karne vaale islam ke stambh vishvaasiyon ko ek din main paanch baar bhagwaan se prarthana karne ke liye protsaahit karte he jisase unhen unki achchhai ke liye dhanyavad kar sake
 The purpose of fasting during the month of Ramadan is to put the believer in a state of gratitude
 zyaadaatar naveenatam kaary aabhaar main manovaigyanik anusandhan aabhaar main vyaktigat antar kii prakruti or kam yaa adhik abhaari vyakti hone ke parinaamon par dhyaan kendrit karte he
 Three scales have been developed to evaluate individual differences in gratitude, each of which sets out somewhat different assumptions
 GQ6 is baat ke vyaktigat matbhedon kaa moolyankan karata he ki log aksar kaise or kitni tivrata se aabhaar ko mahasoos karte hai
 The Appreciation Scale evaluates 8 different aspects of gratitude: people's appreciation, possessions, present moment, rituals, feelings of fear, social comparisons, existential concerns, and behavior that expresses gratitude
 great duusare logon ke prati aabhaar, saamaanya rup main duniya ke prati aabhaar or aapke paas jo nahin he uske liye naaraazgi kii kami kaa moolyankan karata he
 a recent study has shown that each scale is in fact evaluating the same path to life; This suggests that individual differences in gratitude involve all of these components
 naveenatam kaary ke bade samooh ne suzav diya he ki jo log adhik abhaari hote hai unka kalyaan kaa str ucch hota he
 Grateful people are happier, less depressed, less tired, and more satisfied with their lives and social relationships
 Grateful people also have higher control levels for their environment, personal development, life purpose, and self-acceptance
 abhaari logon ke paas jivan main aane vaali kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye adhik sakaaratmak tareeke hote hai, unhen anya logon se samarthan milane kii sambhaavna adhik hote he, ve anubhav kii punah vyakhya karte he or usase aage badhate he or samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye yojana banane main adhik samay lagate hai
 Grateful people also have a less negative strategy to cope with, less likely to try to avoid the problem, deny that there is a problem, blame themselves, or use the substance
 abhaari logon ko behatar neend aati he or aisa isliye hota he kyonki ve sone se pehle nakaaratmak vichaaron ke bare main kam or sakaaratmak vichaaron ke bare main zyada sochate hai
 It has been said that gratitude has a strong association with mental health of any character trait
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki abhaari logon main khushi kaa str adhik or avsaad or tanaav kaa str kam hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 In a study related to gratitude, the participants were randomly prescribed six medical intervention conditions designed to improve the overall quality of life of the participant
 In these situations it was found that the greatest short-term effect came from a "gratitude conversation" where participants wrote letters to express gratitude and distribute it to someone involved in their lives
 is sthiti ne khushi score main 10 pratishat kii vruddhi or avsaad score main mahatvapurn giravat pradarshit kii he, parinaam baatcheet ke baad ek maheene tak vaid rahe
 The longest lasting effects in these six situations were caused by the act of writing a "gratitude journal" where participants were asked to write three things they were grateful for every day
 in pratibhaagiyon ke khushi score main bhi vruddhi hui he or har baar samay samay par prayog ke baad jaanch kii gai vruddhi jari rakhaa
 In fact, the greatest benefit was typically found six months after the start of treatment
 yah abhyaas itnaa safal hua ki haalanki pratibhaagiyon ko keval ek saptaah ke liye patrika ko jari rakhane ke liye kaha gaya, lekin kai pratibhaagiyon ne adhyayan ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi lambey samay tak jarnal jari rakhaa
 Emmons and mccullaugh and Lubomirsky et
 Al Similar results have also been obtained from studies conducted by
 jabaki bhaavnaayen or vyaktitv lakshan kalyaan ke liye mahatvapurn hai, is baat ke pramaan he ki aabhaar bhi vishisht rup se mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 First, a longitudinal study showed that those who were more grateful could cope with life transitions better
 vishesh rup se, jo log sankraman se pehle adhik abhaari the ve kam thake hue, kam udhaas or teen maheene baad bhi apane rishton ke saath adhik santusht the
 Second, two recent studies have suggested that gratitude may have a unique relationship with well-being and may explain aspects of well-being that other personality traits cannot explain
 donon adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki aabhaar big five or saamanytah adhikanshat padhe gaye vyaktitv lakshanon main se tees kii tulana main kalyaan kii vyakhya hetu aabhaar zyada sakasham tha
 Gratitude can also show improvement in a person's philanthropic tendencies
 david destano or monica bartlet dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki aabhaar aarthik udaartaa ke saath sahasambaddha he
 In this study, increased gratitude was shown to be directly mediated by increased monetary using an economic game
 in parinaamon se, yah adhyayan yah pradarshit karata he ki sampradayik laabh ke liye adhik vinamr log vyaktigat laabh kaa balidaan kar sakate he 
 mckullaugh, immons or tsang dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan main aabhaar or samanubhuti, udaartaa or asahaayta ke bich isi tarah paraspar sambandh hote he
 Given that gratitude has been shown to be a strong determinant for people's well-being, several psychological interventions have been developed to increase gratitude
 udhaaharan ke liye, watakins or sahakarmiyon ne vibhinn aabhaar abhyaason jaise ek aise jivit vyakti ke bare main sochna jiske ve abhaari the, kisi aise vyakti ke bare main likhnaa jiske ve abhaari the or aise vyakti ko vitarit karne ke liye patr likhnaa jiske ve abhaari the kaa pareekshan kiya
 Participants in the control condition were asked to describe their meeting
 pratibhaagi jo aabhaar abhyaas main bhaag le rahe the unhone abhyaas samaapt hone ke turant baad sakaaratmak bhaavana ke apane anubhavon main vruddhi pradarshit kii or yah prabhaav un pratibhaagiyon ke liye bahut majboot tha jinhen ek aise vyakti ke bare main sochane ke liye kaha gaya tha jiske liye ve abhaari the
 Participants who have a grateful personality to begin with show great benefit from these grateful practices
 siciro ke anusaar, "aabhaar keval sabase bada gun hi nahin he, balki anya sabhi kaa utpaadak he
 "several studies have shown a correlation between gratitude and well-being, not only for one person, but for all those involved
 sakaaratmak manovigyaan andolan ne in adhyayanon ko sweekaar kar liya he or ek samgr kalyaan ko badhaane ke prayaas main aabhaar abhyaason ko shaamil karne ke liye prayaas karne shuru kar die he jisase andolan main aabhaar ko badha sake
 Although gratitude was neglected by psychology in the past, much progress has been made in recent years in the study of gratitude and its positive effects

 Devils have less genetic diversity than other Australian marsupials and placental carnivores; This corresponds to a founding effect because the range of size of the options was low and almost constant across all subgroups measured

 According to a study by Mena Jones, "gene flow appears to be up to 50 km wide", meaning a favorable source of high activity data or a high specification rate with nearby neighboring populations
 At larger scales, gene flow is decreased, but there is no evidence for segregation due to distance

 Relative analysis of the body size of teeth-biting force of mammals shows that the devil's bite force is the highest among the mammals recorded so far at 5,100 pounds per square inch
 This power is equal to four times the power generated by a large dog, the bite force of a devil is stronger than that of a leopard in terms of biting the corpse, which also causes it to cut a thick metal wire

 Devils can climb trees of more than 40 cm in diameter to a height of about 2
5–3 m, which often do not have small branches to hold
 Minor devils can climb up to 4 m on bushes and up to 7 m on trees if not upright

 Tasmanian devils do not form herds, but once they stop drinking milk, they spend most of their time alone
 chir pratishthit rup se yah mana jaataa tha ki ye ekantavasi praani hai, inke saamaajik sambandhon ko kharaab samajha gaya tha
 However, a field study published in 2009 shed some light on this

 It turns out that all devils were part of the same vast contact network, with male-female interactions characterized by this during the confluence season, while female-female interactions were common at most other times, although frequency and patterns of contact were clearly The seasons did not vary between seasons
 pehle sochaa jaataa tha ki ve bhojan par ladate the, naron ne shaayad hi kabhi duusare nar se baatcheet kii thi
 Therefore, all devils in a region are part of a single social network

 The dense vegetation, thick grass clumps and caves near creeks are also used as dens
 vayask divil usee maand kaa puure jivan ke liye upyog karata he
 It is believed that because a safe den is prized, some may have been used by generations of animals for centuries

 While the diet and anatomy of dasyurids are similar, different body sizes affect temperature control and thus behavior
 In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 degrees, the devil was able to maintain body temperature between 37
4 and 38 degrees
 jab taapmaana 40 se badhaya gaya tha or ardrata 50% rakhi gai to 60 minute ke bheetar divil ke sharir kaa taapmaana do degree upar ho gaya, lekin iske baad dhire-dhire kam hota hua do ghante baad praarambhik str par pahunch gaya or do ghante tak ise banaae rakhaa

 a later study found that devils gasp, but do not sweat to remove heat
 In contrast, many other marsupials were unable to lower their body temperature

 Other unusual materials seen in the devil's feces include the animal's leash and tags, the echidna's secure spine, pencils, plastic, and jeans
 Although devils can cut metal nets, they protect their strong jaws to escape from bondage instead of encroaching into the food store
 apni apekshaakrit gati kii kami ke kaaran ve, ve wolebi yaa khargosh kaa peechha nahin kar sakate, lekin beemaari ke kaaran dhimen pad gaye jaanwaron par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 They sniff a flock of sheep from 10-15 meters away and attack a sheep if they become ill

 There are reports that despite the lack of extreme speed, they can run from 25 km / h to 1
5 km and it is estimated that before the introduction of European immigration and animals, vehicles and death on the road, they have to find food
 Other native animals had to be chased at the proper speed
 pemberton ne bataaya he ki ve prati saptaah kai raaton ko "vistaarit avadhi" main 10 kimi prati ghanta kii gati se daud sakate hai, ve sthir hokar baithne se pehle lambii duriyon tak daud sakate hai, aisa kuch jise ghaat laga kar hamalaa karne kaa pramaan mana gaya he
 They can also dig to find the corpse, in one case digging to eat the corpse of a horse that died of disease
 divil, jaanwaron ke shavon ko khate samay pehle, sharir rachana ke sabase narm bhaag, unke pachan tantra ko khaane ke liye jane jate hai or khate samay ve praayah banaai gai guha main rahete hai
 They consume an average of about 15% of their body weight per day; However, if given the opportunity, they can eat up to 40% of their weight in 30 minutes
 iskaa matlab yah ki ek bade bhojan ke baad yah bahut baari or sust ho saktaa he, is sthiti main yah dagamagaate hue dhire dhire jaataa he or let jaataa he or us tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 This has led to the belief that such eating habits have become possible due to the lack of predatory predator attacks on such bloated animals
 tasmanian divil ek chote jaanavar ke shav ke sabhi avshesh saaf kar saktaa he, jarurat padane par fer or haddiyaan tak nigal jaataa he
 In this regard, the devil has earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, the speed with which it cleans the carcass, helping to prevent the spread of insects that may harm livestock
 inamen se kuch mrit jaanwaron kaa nipataara tab hota he, jab divil atirikt bhojan ko baad main khaanaa shuru karne ke liye ghaseet kar apane nivas par le jate hai
 According to a study in Cradle Mountain, the devil's dose may vary by male, female and season, in winter, males prefer smaller mammals in the ratio of 4: 5 than in adults, but in summer they prefer 7: 2
 Prefer larger prey in proportion to
 unki khuraaq kaa 95% se adhik in do shreniyon se puraa ho jaataa he
 Females are less inclined to target less large prey, but seasonal bias also occurs in them
 sardiyon main bade or madhyam standhari 25 or 58% prayek tathaa 7% chote stanpayi or 10% pakshi khaae jate hai
 In summer, 61 and 37% are consumed respectively for the first two categories
 kishor divil kabhi kabhi pedo par chadhane ke liye jane jate hai; kasherukeey or aksherukiyon ke alaava, bhringkon evam pakshiyon ke andon ko khaane ke liye kishor divil pedo par chadhate hai
 Teens have also been seen climbing trees and catching birds from nests

 From February to July, juvenile devils derive 35
8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12
2% from small birds, and 23
2% from possum meat

0% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se praapt karti hai jisamen 26
7% posam or 8
9% vibhinn pakshi hote hai
 Not all of these animals were caught in the trees, but this elevated figure of females, which is higher than the spotted-tailed male quoll in the same season, is unusual, because the devil's skill at climbing trees is weak
 haalanki ve akele shikaar karte hai, samuhik shikaar ke apusht daawey kiye gaye hai jahaan ek shikaar ko uske awaas se baahar nikaalata he or uske saathi hamalaa karte hai, khaanaa tasmanian divil ke liye ek saamaajik ghatana he
 a solitary animal that collectively eats, this combination makes it unique among carnivores
 is jaanavar ke saath judaa hua adhikansh shor iske karkash samuhik khaane kaa parinaam he, jahaan 12 tak divil ikatthe hote hai, or aksar kai kilometak dur se suna ja saktaa he
 This is due to informing associates of their involvement in food so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is also saved
 shor kii maatra shav ke aakaar se sahasambaddha he
 Devils eat according to a system
 kishor godhuli bela main sakriy hote hai, isliye ve vayaskon se pehle strot tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Usually, the powerful animal eats until it is satisfied and leaves, fighting off any challenges in the meantime
 haare hue jaanavar khadey bal or poonch ke saath jhaadi main daud jate hai, unka vijeta peeche se kaat kar unhen khadedta he
 Fights are less common as the source of food increases, as they are aimed at getting enough food and not suppressing other devils
 When the quolls are eating a corpse, the devils try to chase them away
 chiththidaar poonch vaale quol ke liye yah ek mahatvapurn samasya he, kyonki ve apekshaakrit bade posam ko maarthe hai or dawilon ke aagaman se pehle khaanaa khatm nahin kar pate
 iske vipareet, chote purvi quol bahut chote shikaron kaa shikaar karte hai or dawilon ke aane se pehle khaanaa puraa kar sakate hai
 This is seen as a possible cause of the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls

 They usually establish dominance with voice and physical tone, although fighting also ensues

 Chemical signals are also used
 vayask purush sarvaadhik aakraamak hote hai, or kshatigrast karnaa aam he
 They can stand on their hind legs and push each other's shoulders with their front legs and head, like sumo wrestling
 Occasionally torn flesh near the mouth and teeth, as well as holes on the tendon, can be seen, although these injuries may have occurred during reproduction

 Devils are known to return to the same place for defecation, due to doing so at a community location, the place is called Devil Toilet
 yah mana jaataa he ki saamudayik shouch, sanchaar kaa ek saadhan ho saktaa he jise thik se samajha nahin gaya
 The size of the devil's wings is much larger than that of the body; It has an average length of 15 cm, but also a sample of 25 cm in length
 ve haddiyon ko pachaa vajah se rang main bhure rang ke visheshta he, yaa haddi ke tukade bhi shaamil hai
 Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between the Tasmanian devil and the thylacine is "close and complex", as they competed directly for hunting and perhaps also shelter, the thylacine hunted the devils and the devils ate the dead thylacine, and Devils ate the thylacine's baby
 Mena Jones hypothesizes that the two species share the role of Tasmania's top predator
 keel-poonch chil kaa laash aadhaarit aahaar dawilon ke samaan he isiilie inhen bhi ek pratiyogi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Quoll and Devil are also seen in direct competition in Tasmania
 jones kaa maananaa tha ki quol ne apane ko 100-200 pidhiyon ke baad lagbhag do varsh main viksit kiya he, jaisaa ki dawilon, sabase badi prajati, chiththidaar-poonch vaale quol, sabase choti prajati purvi quol par baraabar rikti prabhaav dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Females usually start breeding when they reach sexual maturity in their second year
 is bindu par, ve saal main ek baar upjau hoti hai or kamottejnaa main kai dimbon kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Since hunting is abundant in spring and early summer, the reintroduction cycle of devils begins in March or April so that weaning time coincides with the maximization of food supplies in the wild for newborn devils
 Occurring in March, mating occurs during both day and night in shelters
 prajnan ke mausam main nar maadaaon ke liye ladate hai or maadaa divil prabhutv paane vaale ke saath sahavaas karti he
 Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and intercourse can be five days; For example, a pair is recorded in a rati den for eight days
 dawills, ekapatnik nahin hote hai or maadaaen sambhog ke baad raksha nahin kii jaati he to kai naron ke saath sambhog karti hai; nar bhi mausam ke dauraan kai maadaaon ke saath punarutpaadan karte hai
 Females have been shown to be selective in an effort to ensure the best genetic progeny, for example by driving small males away

 nar, apane purna jivan main 16 bacchon kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he, jabaki maadaaon ke jivan main ausatan chaar sambhog mausam or 12 santaanen aati hai
 Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and overcome the species with high mortality

 Tasmanian devil children are called by various names, "paps", "joyce" or "imps"
 When young are born, competition fierce as they move from the vagina to the sac in a viscous flow of mucus
 ek baar thili ke andar aane par, unamem se prayek agle 100 dinon ke liye ek nipal se judaa rahata he
 The female Tasmanian devil's bag, such as the Wombat, opens backwards, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with the children inside the pouch

 Once the baby makes contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the enlarged nipple tightening tightly inside the newborn, ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch
 On average, females live longer than males, and up to 60% of puppies do not live to mature

 Brown also proposed that the El niño-southern Oscillation strengthened during the innovative era, and that the devil was highly sensitive to it, with a short life span as a scavenger

 The population of Tasmanian devils was calculated by Tasmania's Primary Industries and Water Department in 2008 in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 animals, with perhaps 20,000 to 50,000 mature animals

 The species was listed unprotected in 2005 under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and in 2006 under the Australian Environment Protection and Conservation Act 1999, meaning it is at risk of extinction in the "medium term"

 In earlier times, Valleby's hunting for Possum and Fur was a big trade — more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923 — and resulted in constant hunting of devils as they were considered a major threat to the fur industry

 This is not considered a sufficient problem for the devil to survive

 The decline in the number of devils is also seen as an ecological problem, with its presence in the Tasmanian forest ecosystem believed to be the reason for the establishment of red foxes, which were illegally introduced in Tasmania in the early 21st century Is, and because of the devils' eating of dead animals, it limited the number of foxes, wild cats and dogs, otherwise In den as killing adult foxes and young foxes that are their food
 In all other Australian states, foxes are a problematic invasive species, and in Tasmania, fox settling will disrupt the health of the Tasmanian devil and will be prey to many vertebrate species
 It is believed that young Tasmanian devils are insecure from eating red fox meat, and there will be direct competition for the den and habitat of those devils and foxes
 a common means of trying to prevent foxes is to use meat that is decorated with sodium fluoroacetate to trap
 As devils and other native animals can also be attracted to poisonous meat, which is placed inside the M-44 ejector device, adaptations have been made to the geometry of the device and the force and jaws required to open it
 Geometry, which fits the fox but does not fit the local species
 The foxes have not yet been fully established in Tasmania to intimidate Tasmanian devils

 At the same time, there was a greater increase in vehicular deaths along the new road; While there were no deaths in the last 6 months
 It is believed that most of the deaths occurred due to increase in speed in the closed part of the road
 It was speculated that it was more difficult for animals to see against black bitumen than light gravel

 In spite of the old beliefs and exaggeration of their nature, many, though not all, devils will remain in the same position as long as there is a human presence, some will also panic
 Due to fear of organized humans, they can bite and scratch, but a solid grip will keep them cool

 In focus, out of focus, the aperture adjustment of the measured lens opening, as the F-number controls the amount of light passing through the lens
 Aperture also has an effect on depth of field and diffraction - higher f number, smaller opening, less light, greater depth of field, and greater diffraction blur
 The focal length divided by the f-number gives the effective aperture diameter

 Psychoanalysis is mainly concerned with the study of human mental actions and behaviors, but it can also be applied to societies
 manovishleshan ke teen upyog hai: Psychoanalysis was founded by Zygmund Fried as a method of treating him by interacting with the psychopath and as an intellectual discipline
 samaaj-vigyaan ke kai anushasano par manovishleshan kaa gaharaa asar he

 After Fried, the credit for further development of the theory of psychoanalysis goes to Zac Lanka
 froid ko vishwaas tha ki manushya apni ichchhaaon, yon-kaamanaayon or aavashyaktaaon kii purti main naakaam rahane par hone vaali takaleef ke ehsaas ko dabaata he
 In the process, there is a feeling of guilt towards incomplete desires within him, leading to feelings of frustration, introspection and, after a period, self-inferiority and self-loathing
 yah tamaam kaary- vyapaar avchetan ke bheetar chalata he
 This subconscious is not always suppressed and comes across as dreams or spontaneous or rational responses to events
 froid maanas ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekhte hai
 He has divided ego into two forms that are realistic and give rise to narcissism

 The patriarchy reproduces only in this context
 froid kii vyakhya ke mutabik jivan or jagat ke saath vividh sambandhon main judane ke liye putr or maan ke bich kaa kaalpanik sutara bhang karnaa zaruri he or yah bhoomika pita ke hisse main aati he
 Under the father's intervention, the son has to give up his sexual desire to the mother
 vah dekhtaa he ki pita ke paas shishn he jo maan ke paas nahin he
 He is afraid that if he violates the authority of the father, then he may have to be castrated like the mother
 badhiyaakaran kii duschintaa ke tahat maatrumanogranthi naamak sankat kaa janm hota he jo froid kaa ek or mahatvapurn sutrikaran he
 Maternal menstrual crisis leads the son to abandon the mother

 zaak lakaan ne froid dwaara pravartit manovishleshan par punarvichaar karte hue sexual kaamana ke daayre se nikaal kar uski pratishtha bhashaa ke daayre main kii
 At the same time, he gave a better explanation of the ego that gave rise to narcissism, while Froyd did not pay much attention to this aspect
 lakaan ne dekha ki froid ke mutabik maatrumanogranthi kaa shikaar hote samay balak bolne kii umr main aa jaataa he
 That is, when the foundation of his subconscious is laying on the basis of primitive self-repression, at that time his steps as a doer fall in the language region
 yahi vah kshan he jab baccha bhashaa ke zariye kaamana ke janm or daman se vaakif hota he
 As the desire can never be fulfilled, he keeps searching for his lost object for a lifetime as a mother
 putr or maan kaa yugma todane ke liye lakaan ne mirar- image kii bhoomika rekhaankit kii he
 Seeing himself in the mirror, that is, while interviewing his own image, he realizes his difference with his mother
 is mukaam tak pahonchte samay pita dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon ke prabhaav main bhashaa ke pratikatmak sansar main balak kaa pravesh ho chukaa hota he
 This process of moving from fimbralism to symbolism takes place in the order of three decisive moments according to Lankan chah maheene se dedh saal kii aayu ke bich maan bachche ko jab sheesha dikhaati he to vah khud ko alag se pahchaan kar apane ekikrut or pruthak astitv se parichit hota he
 Lankan considers it to be the beginning of the moment of narcissism, that is, the place of the ego's self-immolation is born and the body becomes the target of love
 lekin isi kshan ek or ghatana hoti he
 Finding himself different from mother, he thinks two things
 pehali, yah main hoon or duusari, main maan ke saath ekmec na ho kar anya hoon
 This is where the feeling of strangeness is born
 baccha darpan main apni jis chhavi ko dekhtaa he, vah uski suchak he
 The first image is not his permission but his replacement image
 lakaan bataate hai ki isiilie mirar-image kaa charan ahan ke vikaas kii shuruyaat to banataa he, par yah buniyaad ek aisi samaj par rakhi jaati he jo yatharthamulak nahin hoti
 In the world of psychoanalysis, there is a lot of debate on whether the psychopath's mind can be reached through dialogue
 Is there no resistance to psychiatric inquiries within the psychiatrist? At the center of differences arising in the process of finding answers to these questions are issues related to maternal haemorrhage and infant-sexuality
 manorog ke rup main unmaad ko mahatva dene vaale manovishleshak maatrumanogranthi kii paidaaish ke kshan ko kuch zyaada hi ahmiyat dete hai, jabaki khandit manskta kaa vishleshan karne waalon kii taraf se ise bahut kam praathamikta milti he
