 But it was the custom in that area that the teenage bride had to live longer than her parents' house and her husband

 However, Gandhiji also experienced English customs such as going to dance classes for example
 phir bhi vah apni makaan malkin dwaara maance evam patta gobhi ko hajam
nahin kar sake
 He pointed to some vegetarian eateries
 apni mata kii ichchhaaon ke bare main jo kuch unhone padhaa tha use sidhe apnaane kii bajaay unhone bauddhikta se shaakaahaari bhojan kaa apana bhojan sweekaar kiya
 He joined the membership of the vegetarian society and was also selected for its executive committee where he laid the foundation of a local chapter

 They inspired Gandhi to read Shrimad Bhagwad Gita
 hindu, isai, buddha, islam or anya dharmon 
ke bare main padhane se pehle gandhi ne dharm main vishesh ruchi nahin dikhaayi
 He returned to India after being called back to the England and Wales Bar Association but did not have much success in advocating in Bombay

 But due to the stupidity of an English officer, he had to leave this business too
 apni aatmakatha main unhone is ghatana kaa varnan apane bade bhai kii ore se paroapkaar kii asafal koshish ke rup main kiya he
 It was for this reason that he accepted the practice of advocating a one-year contract with an Indian firm in 1893 in Natal South Africa, which was then part of the British Empire
 dakshin africa main gandhi ko bharatiyon par bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He was initially thrown out of the train for refusing to enter the third class compartment after having a valid first class coach ticket

 He faced many other difficulties in his journey

 Similarly, there was one of many incidents in which a court judge ordered him to take off his turban which he did not believe

 In view of the injustice being done to Indians in South Africa, Gandhi raised questions for the honor of his countrymen under the English Empire and for his own position in the country
 1906 main, zulu dakshin africa main nae chunaav kar ke lagu karne ke baad do angrej adhikariyon ko maar daalaa gaya
 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment
 is kor kii bagdor gandhi ne thami
 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents
 dakshin africa main bhartiya logon se indian opinian main apane cholemon ke madhyam se is yuddh main shaamil hone ke liye aagrah kiya or kaha, yadi sarkaar keval yahi mahasoos karti he ki arakshit bal bekaar ho rahe hai tab ve iskaa upyog karenge or asli ladaai ke liye bharatiyon kaa prashikshan dekar iskaa avasar denge
 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s " 
kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharatiyon se adhyadesh kaa virodh karne kaa aagrah kiya
 In his words, "even half the castes and Kafirs who are less modern than us have opposed the government
 paas kaa niyam un par bhi lagu hota he kintu ve paas nahin dikhaate hai
 Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915 to live in India
 unhone bhartiya rashtriya congress ke adhiveshnon par apane vichaar vyakt kiye, lekin unke vichaar bharat ke mukhya muddon, raajnneeti tathaa us samay ke congress dal ke pramukh bhartiya netaa gopal krishna gokhale par hi aadhaarit the jo ek sammanit netaa the
 Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1918 in the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, although the movements of indigo cash-paying food crops were also important, rather than the food crops necessary for his subsistence
 jameendaaron kii takat se daman hue bharatiyon ko nammaatr bharpai bhatta diya gaya jisase ve atyadhik garibi se ghir gaye
 Villages badly dirty and unhealthy; And was bound by liquor, untouchability, and veils
 ab ek vinaashkari akaal ke kaaran shahi kosh kii bharpai ke liye angrejon ne damankaaree kar laga die jinka boj din pratidin badhata hi gaya
 This situation was disappointing
 kheda, gujarat main bhi yahi samasya thi
 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized
 unhone gaanvon kaa ek vistrut adhyayan or surveykshan kiya jisamen praaniyon par hue atyaachaar ke bhayanak candon kaa lekhajokha rakhaa gaya or isamen logon kii anutpaadakeey saamaanya avasthaa ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 It was during this struggle that Gandhiji was addressed by the public in the name of Bapu's father and Mahatma
 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha
 As a result, Gandhi's fame spread across the country
 gandhi ji ne asahyog, ahimsa tathaa shantipurna pratikaar ko angrejon ke khilaaf shastr ke rup main upyog kiya
 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj
 pardi main sadsyta sankethik shulk kaa bhugtane par sabhi ke liye khuli thi
 To improve the discipline within it, a Padasopan Samiti was formed to make the party not a single elite organization but to make it a party of the national people
 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 The day was also celebrated by almost every Indian organization

 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted
 kerala rajya kaa janapad trishur dakshin bharat kii ek pramukh dharmik nagari he
 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words
 gandhi ji raaj ke liye kisi party kaa netritv karte hue prachaar dwaara koi aisa lakshya siddh nahin karnaa chaahate the jise raaj ke saath asthaayee taur par rajnatik vyavastha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya jaae
 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 The Manchester Guardian, February 18, 1948, was shown carrying through the streets

 gandhi ji ne apana jivan satya, yaa sachai kii vyapak khoj main samarpit kar diya
 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"
 haalanki gandhi ji ahimsa ke siddhant ke pravartak bilkul nahin the phir bhi ise bade paimaane par rajnatik kshetra main istemaal karne vaale ve pehle vyakti the
 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities
 gandhi ji ne apni aatmakatha da story of maay experiments wyeth truth " main darshan or apane jivan ke maarg kaa varnan kiya he
 He was told to say: jab main niraash hota hum tab main yaad karata hum ki haalanki itihaas satya kaa maarg hota he kintu prem ise sadaiv jeet letaa he
 There have also been atrocities and assassinations here and for some time they seemed invincible but in the end their downfall happens - always consider it
 " mritkon, anaath tathaa begharon ke liye isse kya fark padataa he ki swatantraaa or loktantr ke pavitra naam ke neeche sampoornavaad kaa pagal vinaash chipa he
 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple
 ahimsa kaa vigyaan akele hi kisi vyakti ko shuddh loktantr ke maarg kii ore le ja saktaa he
 The power based on love is a thousand times more permanent than the power produced by the fear of punishment
 yah kahana ninda karne jaisaa hoga ki ki ahimsa kaa abhyaas keval vyaktigat taur par kiya ja saktaa he or vyaktivaadita vaale desh iskaa kabhi bhi abhyaas nahin kar sakate hai
 The closest approach to pure anarchy would be a democracy based on non-violence; xxrep 5 ; any society organized and running based on total non-violence vaala samaaj hoga
 i also accepted that the need for a police force may be inevitable even in a non-violent state

 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he

 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer

 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he

 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God

 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha

is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 "
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke vishay ko lekar yah dohari sthiti rakhana, gandhi ne isse hinduon or musalamaanon donon taraf se aalochana ke aayam khol die
 Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis condemned Gandhi for undermining Muslim political rights
 vinayak damodar sawarkaar or unke sahyogiyon ne gandhi kii ninda kii or aarope lagaaya ki ve rajnatik rup se musalamaanon ko manaane main lage hue hai tathaa hinduon par ho rahe atyaachaar ke prati ve laaparvaah hai or pakistan ke nirmaan ke liye sweekruti de di he 
 yah aaj bhi rajnatik rup se vivadaspad he, jaise ki pakistani-amareeki itihaaskaar ayesha jalaal yah tark detii hai ki vibhaajan kii vajah gandhi or congress muslim lig ke saath satta baantne main icchhuk nahin the, dusre masalan hindu rashtravaadi rajaneta praveen togdia bhi gandhi ke is vishay ko lekar netritv kii aalochana karte hai, yah bhi ingit karte hai ki unke hisse kii atyadhik kamajori kii vajah se bharat kaa vibhaajan hua
 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct
 jo log hinsa ke jariye aazaadee hasil karnaa chaahate the gandhi unki aalochana ke kaaran bhi thodaa sa rajnatik aag kii lapet main bhi aa gayi bhagat singh, sukhdev, udam singh, raajaguru kii faansee ke kilaaf unka inkaar kuch dalon main unki ninda kaa kaaran bani
 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 ek atyaachaari ke haath main apni zaati ko dekar kiya
 Those who fear God are not afraid of the terror of death
 gandhi kii in vaktavyon ke kaaran kaafii aalochana huyi jinka jawaab unhone "yahudiyon par prashn" lekh main diya saath main unke mitron ne yahudiyon ko kiye gaye mere apil kii aalochana main samachar patr ki do kartane bhejin do aalochanaayen yah sanket karti hai ki maine jo yahudiyon ke khilaaf hue anyaay kaa upaay bataaya, vah bilkul nayaa nahin he
 


 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi
 ve kshtdaayak, gande or lagbhag pashuon kii tarah rahete hai
 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist
 is
 itihaas ke do profesar surendra bhaana or gulam vahed, jo dakshin africa ke itihaas par maharath rakhte hai, ne apane mulgranth da mekking of a polytical riformar : gandhi in saooth africa, 1893 - 1914 main is vivaad kii jaanch kii he
 
 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time
 " saath hi saath ve yah bhi kehete hai, "gandhi ke jail ke anubhav ne unhen un logon ki sthiti ke prati adhik samvedansheel bana diya tha
 

nd Gandhi became firm; They became much less decisive in their expression of bias towards Africans and began to see points of common cause on a larger scale
 johansburg jail main unke nakaaratmak drushtikon main dheeth africa kaidi the na ki aam africa
" Former South African President Nelson Mandela is a follower of Gandhi, despite Gandhi's critics attempting to stop the statue's unveiling in 2003, he unveiled it in Johannesburg
 bhaana or vahed ne anaavaran ke ird-gird hone vaali ghatnaon par da mekking of a polytical riformar : gandhi in saooth africa, 1913-1914 main tippanee kiya he
 In the section "gandhi's Legacy for South Africa" he writes "gandhi inspired generations of active South African activists to end white suzerainty
 yah viraasat unhen nelson mandela se jodatii hai
 
made that Mandela finished the short that Gandhi had started
 " ve jari rakhte hai un vivaadon kaa hawala dete hue jo gandhi ki pratimaa ke anaavaran ke dauraan uthe the
 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake
 On some occasions he has called himself a philosophical anarchist
 In his sense, an independent India exists with thousands of small self-sufficient communities that rule on their own without the hurdle of others
 iskaa yah matlab nahin tha ki britishon dwaara sthapit prashashnik dhaanche ko bharatiyon ko sthanantarit kar dena jiske liye unhone kaha ki hindustan ko ingalistaan bananaa he

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing
 is tarah ke tripal saamanytah se likhe gaye hai 
kuch prasiddh udhaaharan hai or ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, paaythagorian prameya ke parinaamon main se ek he ki taratamyaheen lambaai, jaise kii 2 kaa vargamul, banaaya ja saktaa he
 a right angle whose legs are equal to one unit has the square root of its hypotenuse length 2

 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a result
 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Boudhayan theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true

 Therefore, a2 + b2> c2
 jin trikon main ek obtyus kone hota he, α + β < γ hota he
 Therefore, a2 + b2 <c2 occurs

 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function
 atishyoktipurna trikonmiti main, sin ke kone kii samanta santusht karata he Thus, this equation takes the form jahaan a, b, and c samakon trikon ke parshvon kii ganaatmak dooriyaan hai 
 The distance between the points {and {in 3 dimensions is √2 + 2)] 2 + 2) = √2 + 2 + 2) and similarly for 4 or more dimensions

 The Apastamba Sulba formula contains numerical evidence of the general Pythagorean theorem, using a field computation
 Vonr Varden believes "it was certainly based on earlier traditions"
 According to Albert Burke, this is the original proof of the theorem
