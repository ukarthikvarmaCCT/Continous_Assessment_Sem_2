 Frequent formation of new castes, changes within castes, and extinction of castes are proved by shared morphological and biochemical traits in the evolutionary history of life
 jin jatiyon kaa haal hi main koi saajha purvaj tha, un jatiyon main ye saajhe lakshan zyada samaan hai
 We can make a family tree of life by observing the evolutionary relationship between these traits of existing species and fossils

 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn
 anuvanshik jaankaree diene ke madhyam se ek peedi se duusare ke paas ja sakate hai, ek anu jo anuvanshik jaankaree ko encode karte hai
 DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases

 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation

 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits

 Third, implicit traits with no explicit purpose are similar to functional ancestral traits and, finally, the use of these similarities can be classified into a category of nested groups — similar to a family tree
 haalanki, aadhunik anusandhan ne suzav diya he ki, kshaitij jin hastantaran ke kaaran, yah "jivan kaa vriksh" ek saral shakha ke ped kii tulana main adhik jatil ho saktaa he kyonki kuch jin dur se sambandhit prajatiyon ke bich swatantra rup se faile hue hai
 Previous species have also left records of their evolutionary history, with the comparative anatomy of current fossils constituting fossil, morphological, or anatomical records
 donon aadhunik or vilupt prajatiyon ke angon kii tulana karke, peleontologist un prajatiyon ke vansh ko anumaan kar sakate hai
 However, this approach is most successful for organisms that have difficult parts of the body, such as shells, bones, or teeth
 In addition, prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common forms, their fossils
 Do not provide information on their ancestors haal hi main, saamaanya vansh ke liye jeevon ke bich jaev rasinic samanta ke adhyayan se aaye hai
 For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids
 aanvik anuvanshiki ke vikaas ne jeevon ke jinom main vikaas kaa record prakat kiya he: dating jab muteshan dwaara nirmit aanvik ghadi ke madhyam se prajatiyaan alag ho jaati hai
 For example, comparisons of these DNA sequences have revealed that humans and chimpanzees hold 98% of their genomes and analyze some of the regions where they differ, highlighting the existence of the common ancestor of these species Helps mukhya lekh: jivan ke vikasvaadi itihaas or jivan ke vikasvaadi itihaas kii samayrekha vikasvaadi ped aadhunik prajatiyon ke madhya main unke saamaanya purvaj se bhinnata dikhaa rahaa he
 The three domains are colored, bacteria blue, archea green, and eukaryates red

 In the next few billion years, no clear change in morphology or cellular organization occurred in these organisms

 The next major change in cell structure occurred when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis

 Another reflex of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants
 jivan kaa itihaas 610 million varsh purv jab tak editokayan kaal main mahasaagaron main prakat hone lagi, tab tak ekekshiya eukeriots, prokerots or archia kaa tha
 Multicolority evolved in several independent phenomena, such as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, mud mold, and mycobacteria in diverse organisms

 Soon after the rise of these earliest multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared in about 10 million years, in a program called the Cambrian explosion
 yahaan, aadhunik jeevon ke adhikansh prakaar ke jeevashm record main dikhaai dete hai, saath hi adwitiya vansh jo baad main vilupt ho gaye the
 Several triggers have been proposed for the Cambrian explosion, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis
 lagbhag 500 million varsh pehle, paudhe or kavak bhoomi upnivesh karte the or jald hi aarthropod or anya jaanwaron dwaara peechha kiya gaya tha
 The insects were particularly successful and still form most of the animal species today
 amphibian pehle 364 million varsh pehle dikhaai die, iske baad lagbhag 155 million varsh purv donon pakshiyon ne lagbhag 12 9 million varsh purv stanadhariyon ko lagbhag 10 million saal pehle or aadhunik maanav lagbhag 2,50,000 saal pehle
 However, despite the evolution of these larger animals, the small organisms of the type that evolved early in this process continued to be highly successful and dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being Prokorites

 Oil ching rajvansh china kaa aakhri rajvansh tha, jisne china par san 1644 se 1912 tak raaj kiya
 The kings of the Ching dynasty were not actually of the Chinese race, but of a completely different Manchu caste who had seized the throne of China before taking over the Ming dynasty that came before it
 ching china kaa aakhri rajvansh tha or iske baad china ganatantric pranali kii ore chalaa gaya
 The Ching dynasty was founded by the Aisin Gyoro family of Jurchen people who were from Manchuria
 unke sardaar nurhachi ne jurachen qabeelon ko 16veen shatabdi main sangathit kiya
 In 1635, his son Hong Taiji declared that now Jurchen was an organized Manchu nation
 in maanchhuon ne ming rajvansh ko dakshin manchuriya ke liyaoning kshetra se baahar dhakelnaa shuru kar diya
 In 1644, rebel peasants stormed the Ming capital Beijing and seized and sabotaged it
 in vidrohiyon kaa netritv lee zicheng naam kaa purv ming sevak kar rahaa tha, jisane apane nae rajvansh kii ghoshnaa kar di jise usne 'shun rajvansh' kaa naam diya
 When the rebels came to dominate Beijing, the last Ming emperor, who had the title of 'chongzhen emperor', committed suicide
 phir lee zicheng ne mingon ke senapati, vu sangui, ke kilaaf kaarywahi kii
 The commander made a treaty with the Manchus to protect him and he got a chance to enter Beijing
 rajkumaar dorgon ke netritv main unhone beijing main daakhil hokar lee zicheng ke nae shun rajvansh kaa khaatmaa kar daalaa
 Now the rule of the Manchus started over China and by 1683 they had control over the whole of China
 vaise to ching samraat chiniyon se alag manchhu jati ke the, lekin samay ke saath-saath ve zaraa-bahut chini samskruti apnaane lage
 In China, there were tests for appointment to government service and the Ching dynasty continued
 maanchhuon ke saath-saath chiniyon ko bhi sarkari seva main sweekaar kiya gaya
 By the 18th century, they had spread the boundaries of China so much that the Chinese pride was never so big before it nor after that
 samay ke saath-saath ching vyavastha main bhrashtachar bad gaya or europe ke kai desh evam japan china main hastkshep karne lage
 They forcibly took control of many Chinese ports
 japan 1867-8 ke meiji punarsthaapan ke baad bahut tezi se aadhunikaran main laga hua tha or 1894-1895 ke pratham china-japan yuddh main japan ne china ko parajeet kar diya
 There was a revolution in 1911–1912 and the Ching dynasty withdrew from power
 aupchaarik rup se china ek ganatantr ban gaya haalanki fuj ke senapatiyon main aapasi jhadpen chalati raheen
 Pui, the last Ching emperor, was reinstated as emperor in Beijing for a few days in July 1917 but was then expelled
 1932 se 1945 main japaniyon kaa manchuriya par qabza rahaa or unhone use ek manchukuo naamak swatantra raashtra ke rup main vyavasthit kiya 
 He also made Pui its emperor
 lekin dwitiya vishwayuddh main 1945 main japan kii haar ke baad ching rajvansh hameshaa ke liya satta se hat gaya

 theva 17veen shatabdi main mogul kaal main rajasthan ke rajgharaanon ke sangrakshan main panpi ek bejod hastkala he
 The handicraft art of Theva is related to the manufacture of jewelery made of gold enamel and transparent glass for women
 iske ine gine shilpi-parivaar rajasthan ke keval pratapgarh jile main hi rahete hai
 In the making of theva-jewelery, vials of various colors are put into a frame made of fine filigree, and fine pieces of gold are carved on it, which are made by skilled and skilled hands with the help of small tools
 yah aabhushan-nirmaan kala apni moulikta or kalaatmakataa ke kaaran vishwa kii un ini gini hastkalaon main se ek he - jo antarrashtriya bazaar or vipanan ke abhaav main jaldi vilupt ho sakati hai| The name "theva" originated from the two main processes of making this art, 'tharana' and 'wada'
 is kala main pehle kaanch par sone kii bahut patali work yaa shit lagaakar us par baarik jaali banaai jaati he, jise tharana kaha jaataa he
 In the second stage the frame is made of silver fine wire to tighten the glass, which is called "wada"
 tatpashchaat ise tej aag main tapaaya jaataa he
 As a result, gold artwork and beautiful designs emerge on the glass to become an ornament of a unique and wonderful work
 kaanch par kanchan kaa karishma kahe jane vaali yah shilp kaanch par sunahari painting kii tarah he, jo chitrakaari kii neenv par janm leti he
 The composition of this craft is complex, difficult and laborious, but it is only a matter of these handful of artisans to make the craft painted on gold into glass
 shilp chithran ko 23 karet sone ke pattar par ‘taankal’ naamak ek vishesh kalam se ukera jaataa he or kushaltapurvak bahurangi kaanch par madh diya jaataa he
 When both substances combine with gold and glass become a single organism, then glass is visible in gold and gold in glass
 isi ko theva kala kehete hai
 In order to keep the glass content more effective and better, it has to go through a special process so that the gold work contained in the glass starts to rise and touches the mind of the beholder
 is prakaar shilp kaa prayek namoona paardarshee kaanch kaa ho jaataa he or us par maanik, panna tathaa neelam jaisi prabhaa dikhalaai padati he
 Special glass from Belgium used to be used to carve this art, but due to the unavailability of such glass, different types of glass are now used
 prarambh main theva kaa kaam laal, nile or hare rangon ke moolyawaan pattharon hira, panna aadi par hi hota tha, lekin ab yah kaam pile, gulabi or kaale rang ke kaanch ke ratnon par bhi hone laga he
 Earlier, religious motifs and popular folklore were carved on the boxes, plates, dishes, etc
, made from this art, but now this art is also made in jewelery as well as pendants, ear-rings, ties and pins of cuffs, cufflinks, photoframes etc
 Has become popular

 This distinctive ornamentation tradition of Pratapgadha is mentioned in the "P" subdivision of Encyclopaedia Britannica
 rajasthan kii is bejod aabhushan parampara ke sarkari sangrakshan ke prayaas aaj bhi aparyaapt hai | However, by the Government of India, the Theva Art Institute, Pratapgarh, the representative body of Theva art, has been awarded the Geographical Indication Number under the Geographical Display of Goods Act, 1999 for specialization in the preservation of this unique art
 ullekhneey he ki jeographical indication kisi utpaada ko uski sthaan vishesh main utpatti evam prachlan ke saath vishesh bhugolic gunvattta evam pahchaan ke liye diya jaataa he
 Mahesh Raj Soni, who is honored with the President's Award for Theva Art and a handicraft member of Theva Art Institute, is confident that this art will be able to retain its geographical identity well after getting the Geographical Performance Number

 hajaari prasad ek kanjus or laalchee kism kaa aadmi he jo din raat apane iklaute putr raja, ke liye kisi dhani ladki kaa sapana dekhtaa rahata he
 Raja is only interested in spending his father's money in expensive parties
 ek din college jate vakt, nikat se guzar rahi ek jeep raja par keechad oochaal jaati he
 Madhu, the jeep girl, is rude to the king
 raja andha hone kaa dhong kar madhu ko bevakoof banaata he
 When reality opens, it imitates it
 donon iske saath hi ek duusare ke dushman ban jate hai or ek duusare ko majaa chakhaane kaa bahaanaa dhundne lagate hai
 The king drops Madhu with his effort during the dance rehearsal
 uske baad madhu usko college ke champion boxr se ladane ke liye majaboor kar detii he
 The king wins in that fist fight
 udhar ladki dhundte dhundte hajaari prasad ko abhas hota he kii uskaa raddi or kabad kaa dhandha raja kii bhavy shaadi main aade aayega
 One day while on a trip to an expensive hotel, he encounters Mr
 Mehra, a millionaire who has only one girl
 hajaari bhaade ke kalakaar lekar apane staff ke taur par bhartee kar letaa he
 Like Mehra, he too, with two big dogs, reaches the beach early in the morning where Mehra is roaming
 mehara ke saath saath ghumte hue wo bhikhaariyon ko bahut se nakli rupaye lutaata he
 He soon becomes Mehra's friend
 mehara or hajaari apane bacchon kii shaadi ek duusare se karne ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 When the king meets his future wife, he learns that the girl is Madhu
 madhu or raja shaadi kii sambhaavna se hi inkaar kar dete hai
 Madhu overcame a weekend college tour when he falsely accused Raja of trying to rape her
 raja krodhit hota he ki uski pratishtha barbaad ho gai he or use beyimaani or vichaarheenta ke liye dandit karata he, yah bataate hue ki kai log apana badla lete lekin vah alag he
 Madhu immediately falls in love with the king
 sagaai kii party main, shri mehara ko hajaari kii sachhee vittiya paristhitiyon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Furious, he insults Hazari in front of everyone
 hajaari bahut zyada bura maanata he
 Raja and Madhu are refused by their parents to meet each other again
 phir bhi, donon gupt rup se milte rahete hai
 When Mr
 Mehra discovered this, he arranged for the king to be beaten by some thugs
 vah madhu ko dur bhejne kaa faisla karte hai jahaan vah raja se sampark nahin kar paaegi
 Before doing so, the king sneaks into Madhu's house and the two get married
 shri mehara ne madhu ko ghar se nikaal diya or ghoshit kiya ki vah unke liye mar chuki he
 Hazari also rejects the king when he finds out that he has married the daughter of his biggest enemy

 According to the theory of sun therapy, the cause of disease is the increase of colors in the body
 surya kiran chikitsa ke anusaar alag-alag rangon ke alag-alag gun hote hai
 The red color produces excitement and the blue color produces strength

 Dr
 Ajay Sehgal, secretary of the Indian Medical Association, says that nowadays, children who are suffering from jaundice as soon as they are born are put in sun rays at sunrise due to exposure of ultra violet rays to their body's pigment cells
 But the chemical reaction starts and there is benefit in the disease

 In 126 BC, Chinese Ambassador Chang Kien found the race of Yuvachi on the river Akshu
 euvachi kii mukhya shakha ne aage chalakar pun: shako ko haraaya or kapish par adhikaar kar liya
 From this time, the historical relationship of Yuvachi caste begins with India

 In opposition to this, some scholars find no connection between the Yuichi and Kushan dynasty
 unka kathan he ki kushaan vastav main shaq jati ke hi ek ang the or yuichi ne jab shakon ko haraaya to isi vansh ke kuch pramukh sardaar yuichi main mil gaye
 Later Chinese historians did not understand the separation of these two nations
 kushaanon ke atirikt chaar or jatiyon ne yuichi aadhipaty sweekaar kar liya tha
 In fact, Yuichi's struggle with those castes named Heungnu and Nusun and the bloodshed of each other does not seem appropriate with Kujul Cadficz assuming his 'satyadharma Pramukh' title

 mahabharat kaal main jab vanvaas kaal main jab pandavon kaa ghar jala diya gaya to vidura ke paraamarsh par ve vahaan se bhagkar ek duusare van main gaye, jahaan pili aankhon vaala hidimbsur rakshas raja jo maha daitya van naamak van ke rakshaso kaa raja tha, apni bahan hindiba ke saath rahata tha
 One day Hidimb sent his sister Hindiba to search for food in the forest, but there Hindiba saw her mother Kunti along with the five Pandavas
 is rakshasi kaa bhim ko dekhte hi usase prem ho gaya is kaaran isane un sabko nahin maaraa jo hidimb ko bahut bura laga
 Then Hidimb got angry and attacked the Pandavas, Bhima killed it in this battle and then both Hindiba and Bhima got married in the forest with the permission of Kunti
 inhen ghatotkach naamak putr hua
 After the burning of Laksha Griha, Pandavas went inside the forest with their mother after leaving Laksha Griha via the tunnel
 kai kos chalane ke kaaran bhimsen ko chhod kar shesh log thakaan se behaal ho gayi or ek vat vriksh ke neeche let gayi
 Mother Kunti was distraught with thirst, so Bhimsen went in search of a reservoir or lake
 ek jalashay drushtigat hone par unhone pehle swayan jal piya or mata tathaa bhaaiyon ko jal pilaane ke liye laut kar unke paas aaye
 They were all immersed in deep sleep due to fatigue, so Bhima started guarding them there
 us van main hidimb naam kaa ek bhayanak asur kaa nivas tha
 On finding the smell of humans, he sent his sister Hidimba to catch the Pandavas so that they could make them their own food and fulfill their apps
 vahaan par pahunchne par hidimba ne bhimsen ko paharaa dete huye dekha or unke sundar mukharavind tathaa balishtha sharir ko dekh kar un par aasakt ho gai
 He took the form of an incomparable Lavanmayi Sundari from her demonic Maya and went to Bhimsen
 bhimsen ne usase poocha, "he sundari! tum koun ho or raatri main is bhayanak van main akeli kyon gum rahi ho?" bhim ke prashn ke uttar main hidimba ne kaha, "he narshreshth! main hidimba naam kii rakshasi hoon
 My brother has sent me to bring you guys but my heart is enamored with you and i want to receive you as my husband
 meraa bhai hidimb bahut dusht or krur he kintu main itnaa samarthy rakhti hoon ki aapako uske changul se bachaa kar surakshit sthaan tak pahunchaa sakun
 " idhar apni bahan ko laut kar aane main vilamb hota dekh kar hidimb us sthaan main ja pahunchaa jahaan par hidimba bhimsen se vaartalap kar rahi thi
 Seeing Hidimba's courtship with Bhimsen, he became angry and pounced on Hidimba to punish him
 yah dekh kar bhim ne use rokte huye kaha, "re dusht rakshas! tuje stri par haath uthaate lajja nahin aati? yadi tu itnaa hi vir or parakramee he to mujhase yuddh kar
 "after saying this, Bhimsen started fighting with him, beating the rhythm
 kunti tathaa anya pandav kii bhi neend khul gai
 Seeing Bhima fighting with a demon there and seeing a beautiful girl standing, Kunti asked, "daughter! Who are you?" Hidimba shared everything with them
 arjuna ne hidimb ko maarane ke liye apana dhanush uthaa liya kintu bhim ne unhen baan chhodane se manaa karte huye kaha, "anuj! tum baan mat chodo, yah meraa shikaar he or mere hi haathon maregaa
 "having said this, Bhima grabbed Hidimb with both hands and swung it several times in the air and hit the ground with such intensity that his life and body flew away
 hidimb ke marane par ve log vahaan se prasthaan kii taiyaari karne lage, is par hidimba ne kunti ke charnon main gir kar prarthana karne lagi, "he mata! maine aapke putr bhim ko apane pati ke rup main sweekaar kar liya he
 Please accept me kindly
 yadi aap logon ne majhe sweekaar nahin kiya to main isi kshan apane praanon kaa tyaag kar duungi
 "seeing a feeling of strong love for Bhima in Hidimba's heart, Yudhishthira said," Hidimbe! i entrust you to my brother, but he will only stay with you during the day and stay with us at night
 " hidimba iske liye taiyaar ho gai or bhimsen ke saath anandpurvak jivan vyateet karne lagi
 After a year, Hidimba's son was born
 utpann hote samay uske sir par kesh na hone ke kaaran uskaa naam ghatotkach rakhaa gaya
 He turned very elusive and grew up as soon as he was born
 hidimba ne apane putr ko pandavon ke paas le ja kar kaha, "yah aapke bhai kii santaan he atah yah aap logon kii seva main rahegaa
 "hidimba left after saying so
 ghatotkach shraddha se pandavon tathaa mata kunti ke charnon main pranaam kar ke bolaa, "ab mujhe mere yogya seva bataayen
 The Hearing that, Kunti said, "you are the eldest grandson of my clan
 samay aane par tumhaari seva avashya lee jaayegi
 "on this Ghatotkacha said," Whenever you will remember me, i will be present in the service of you

8352 In the context of economics, the term elasticity is used to describe the amount of change in an economic variable when it is changed
 yadi ek char ke parivartan se doosraa char adhik parivartit hota he to kehete hai ki loch adhik he
 For example, if the price of a product is reduced then how much sales will increase, the term 'elasticity' is used for this
 arthshaastra main maang kaa niyam ek mahatvapurn niyam he jo kisi vastu kii keemat main hone vaale parivartan ke parinamswaroop us vastu kii maang main hone vaale parivartan kii disha ko bataata he
 This is a qualitative statement
 isse yah to gyaat ho jaataa he ki vastu kii keemat main kami hone par us vastu kii maang badhegi athwa keemat main vruddhi hone par us vastu kii maang kam hogi
 The assumption of information about the proportional change in demand resulting from the change in the price of a commodity is called elasticity of demand
 atah yah kahana uchit hoga ki maang kii loch ek parimanatmak kathan he
 The measure of the change in the quantity demanded of a commodity as a result of a change in the price of a commodity is called elasticity of demand
 aadhunik arthshaastri bolding evam shrimati jon robinsan ne maang kii mulya loch ko ganitiya main prakat kiya he
 According to Mrs
 John Robinson, elasticity of demand is obtained by dividing the proportional change of the quantity purchased as a result of a small change in price at a price or production
 ise nimna sutara ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Where e d { \ displaystyle E_ {d}} is elasticity, q d { \ displaystyle Q_ {d}} is the quantity demanded, and p { \ displaystyle P} is the value

 Due to the law having a close relationship with social changes, he could not remain unaffected by this changed attitude of human beings

 According to the Sociologists of Jurisprudence, it is necessary for the courts to emphasize more on its practical aspect by not giving special emphasis to the abstract and written form of the law, that is, they should examine the social needs and objectives which were responsible for passing the relevant law
 Huh
 samajashastreey vidhishastra ko america main prabal samarthan praapt hua he
 Renowned American scholar Dean Rasko Pound has called the school of 'social engineering'
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar vidhishastra ke antargat mukhyatah do baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- The adoption of a sociological approach to jurisprudence resulted in the emergence of realistic ideology in America under which the functional aspect of the law was given so much importance that it undermined the importance of abstract rules of codes and enactments and the principles embedded in them
 vidhi tathaa vidhishastra ke prati prayojnatmak drushtikon apanaate hue yathartwaadiyon ne vidhi ko kaalpanik siddhanton se ubarkar tathyon par aadhaarit vaastavik rup pradaan kiya or is prakaar vidhi ko saamaajik samasyaon ko sulajhaan vaala ek kriyaatmak saadhan mana
 Jerome Frank, a strong proponent of this ideology, believed that the rule of law is a hypothetical fact because the law is always variable and therefore no special importance should be given to the codification or pre-judgments of the law
 frank ke anusaar vidhi ke vikaas kaa saamaajik pragati se sidhaa sambandh rahata he
 Leviline considered the functional aspect of the law as a source of social progress
 unke anusaar vidhishastri kaa yah kartavya he ki vah vidhi kaa adhyayan or vishleshan sam-samayik saamaajik samasyaa ke pariprekshya main karen
 The method should move away from the theoretical realm and help in solving problems from the practical aspect of human life
 aitihaasik paripekshya main dekhen ta samaaj main prachlit rangabhed, daspratha, satipratha, asprishyata, balvivaah aadi kuprathaon ko kanoon dwaara samaapt kiya gaya

 According to him, law is beneficial to the society, welfare and to reduce the interests of individuals
 yadi vidhi upyogi athwa kriyasheel nahin he to uskaa samaaj ke liye koi mulya nahin he
 Law is a means for society through which social objectives like peace, happiness, prosperity and development can be achieved

 Law has an important role in the administration of justice, so the law should be constructed on the basis of social conditions, demands, wishes and needs

 Laws are always made for the progress of society, not for the progress of society

 In the absence of coordination in the common interests and selfishness of the people of the society, it can adversely affect the peace system of the society by taking extreme form

 Here we will show the proofs of the genealogy of Bhrigu, Angira, Manu, Maya, Tvashta, Shilpi and Daivejna etc
 on the basis of the texts by giving the pramams of scriptures
 pracheen dharm shastron main The craftsman, Vishwakarma Brahmins were addressed in the words Rathkar Vardhaki, Kavi, Moyavi, Panchal, Rathpati, Suhast Solar and Parasara
 us samay aajkal ke saamaan lohakaron, kashthakaron or swarnakaaron aadi sabhi ke alag-alag sahastron jati bhed nahin the
 In ancient times, craft work was considered to be very high, because in the search of scriptures, we find that the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya were the three varna chariot deeds i
e
 Shilp Karma
 ham yahaan vishwakarma brahmanon ke brahmantya vishyak kuch pramaan dene se purv yah uchit samajhate he ki rathkaar, pachal, narashas ityadi shabdon ke vishay main kuch thoda samajajha den
 Therefore, when we come to the evidence of the religious scriptures in the future, when any of these words come, then our readers will not have difficulty in understanding
 rathkaar This word has come at many places in ancient scriptures and has been used in place of Shilpi Brahmin
 arthath lokkar, kashtakaar, swarnakaar, silavat or tamrakaar sab hi kaam karne vaale kushal praveen shilpi brahman kaa bodh keval rathkaar shabd se hi karaayaa gaya he or yahi shabdon vedon tathaa puraanon main bhi shilpagya brahmanon ke liye likhaa gaya he
 In Skanda Purana Nagar Khand Chapter 6, the word Rathkar is used: sadyojataa di panchabhyo mukhebhyah panch nirbhaye
 
 vishwakarma sutaa hote rath karastu pachan c
 
 tasmin kaale mahabhaago parmo may rup bhak
 
 pashandaar kantkan sau varna dashakan tada

 arthh shankar bole ki he skand, sadyojat vamdev, tatpurush, adheer or ishan yah paanch brahm sajaank vishwakarma ke paanch mukhon se paidaa hue
 The chariot of these Vishwakarma sons is known
 anek rup dhaaran karne vaale us vishwakarma ne apane putron ko taanki aadi das shilp aayudh arthath das aujaar sona aadi nau dhaatu loha, lakdin atyadi diya
 The charioters who performed this act of his life started performing the holy deeds of the Panchanidha of the world

 Sagyan Yanche Anayate Beyond Tantuwayo Name worm: akrutrah ityev rathkaaron naam brahmanh paninisutra 4 / 1-151 krirvadibhyonyah
 The gotra words which denote the indicative meaning of the Brahmin caste are given in the Gana Sutra, it is: Kuru, Garg, Magunsh, Ajmar, Athakara, Babduk, Kavi, Mati, Kadhijal etc
, Kauravya, Brahmana, Margya, Manguya: Azamarya: Rathkarya: Vavdkya: Katya Kapijalya: Brahmana: Iti everywhere
 taatpary yah he ki vyakaran shaastra main bhi rathkaar shabd ko arya gotra, brahman jati bodhak siddh kiya hua he or uskaa udhaaharan bhi rathkaaron naam brahman diya he
 From which it has been proved that the word Rathkar is a Brahmin caste sign because Rathon karoti iti rathakara
 arthath rath nirmaan karne vaale brahman kaa bodh pracheen grathon main rathkaar shabd se hota he
 It is also necessary to write here that in the memories, charioteer is also written to a narrow caste, but where the description of holy deity etc
 comes
 vahaan shilpi brahman santati rathkaar kaa hi matlab hota he
 You had the same prestige in the ancient topic of scripture and the charioteer in ancient times, at that time Vishwakarma's chariot form was elaborate
 raaje maharaja sabhi vishwakarma rathkaaron ko aadar dete the kyonki kalakaar rashtran ke nirmaan karne me agrasar rakhten the yah brahman varg rathkaaron main tha
 Panchal rathkaar shabd ke vishay ke namoonay ke taur par upar udhaaharan dekar bataa chuke he
 Now, in the same way, by giving two examples about the word Panchal, we will tell that Vishwakarma Brahmins have also been called Panchal in ancient scriptures
 barah puraana main kaha haih Panchal Brahmanati Haas: Kathan
 
 Tatra Suvarnalankar Vyasinan Jeevan: Panchal Brahmana
 
 Saivagam states: panchalanaa c sarveshama charoreshpruth giyate
 Het karma vidyamanyi pachnalana smutanich
 
 In the Rudrayamala Vastu system, Shivaji Maharaj said that: shiva manumany stvashta taksha shilpi c panchmah
 
 vishwakarmasuta netan viddhi pravartkaan
 
 eteshan putr pautranampyete shilpino bhuvi
 
 panchalanaa c sarveshan shakhasyachmaun kyano
 
 panchalaste sadaa puujyah pratimaa vishwakarmanah
 
 rudravamal vaastu tantra vratyadi
 
 uparokt pramaanon main pachal shabd kaa prayog vishwakarmaake sthaan main kiya gaya he
 That is, the words Rathkara and Panchala are both Vishwakarma Brahmin
 sthapaty Somewhere in Yajna Karma and Dev Karma related work, Vishwakarma Pachanal Brahmana has also been said to have its architecture
 jaise bhagwat skanda 3 main sthapaty vishwakarm shaastra likhaa he, iskaa yahi arth he ki yajna sambadhi or dev sambadhi pavitra shilp karm karne vaale vishwakarma santaan brahman he
 This is also confirmed by the proof of Amar Kosh
 dekho - amar kosh a
 brahmavarg - saginshp toshtyya sthapatih Meaning: Brihaspati is known to Jupiter Guru, who performs these deeds with Jupiter consciousness and the other Jupiter has become vishwa-karma Kulottapanna Shilpacharya
 narashans Angira Maharishi is called Narashana in Rigveda, the proof of this is Rigveda a
 Look at 8 / 2 / 1 - Nara: Aginaras: Maharsaya: Man goes away boudhayan shrut sutara ke maha pravaradhyay main bhi likhaa he - vasisht shunikaatri bhrigu kanv waghrashchadhul rajanya vaisya iti narashansah
 
 gotra pravar darpan main bhi yah shabd paaya jaataa he - bhrigu gane twashtyah agne narashansan vyakhya syamh
 Vasistha Shunakatribhrigu Karmah Baghrushchadhul Iti
 
 The term Narashan is also used in Pitr Sajanas
 dekho rigdev adhyay 8 / 1 / 16 / 3 - manonva huwamuhe narashansen somene
 
 bhashya - nareh shasyate iti narashansah pitarah
 
 aashvalyan shrout sutara main bhi narashans kaa prayog miltaa he
 Look Sutra 5 / 6 / 30 - Aadayamayashishtimatan Saadayanti Te Narasana Bhavati
 
 By proofing the above many evidence, we have proved that by using the words Rathakar Panchal, Rathapatya and Narashan, all these are written in religious texts wherever
 waha vah shilpi brahmanon ke bodhak he
 Now further we will show by proving that more evidence of Vishwakarma dynasty being a Brahmin can be found by searching in the Sanatani Dharma texts
 uparokt khatkaar, paanchal, rathkaar, narashans yah sab stambh pramaan sagranh arthath vishwakarm - brahman - bhaskar se sangrahit kiye he
 This book is authored by Jayakrishna Manithia, Sharma, Gurudev, which has collected and published several columns in vishwakarma-vijay-prakash
