 plasi kaa yuddh 23 june 1757 ko murshidaabad ke dakshin main 22 mile dur nadiya jile main ganga nadi ke kinare 'plasi' naamak sthaan main hua tha
 In this war, on one side was the army of British East India Company and on the other side was the army of the Nawab of Bengal
 company kii sena ne robert clive ke netritv main nawab sirazuddaula ko haraa diya tha
 But this war cannot be considered as a victory of the company because before the war, Kalaiv had conspired with three generals of the Nawab, his courtier, and Amir Seth Jagat Seth, etc
 of the state
 nawab kii to puri sena ne yuddh me bhaag bhi nahi liya tha yuddh ke foran baad mir jaafar ke putr miran ne nawab kii hatya kar di thi
 War is considered very unfortunate for India, it is from this war that the story of India's slavery begins
 is yuddh se company ko bahut laabh hua wo ai to vyapaar hetu thi kintu ban gai raja
 Using the resources obtained from this war, the company decisively defeated the French company in the Third and Final War of Karnataka
 is yuddh ke baad bedara ke yuddh me company ne dch company ko haraaya tha
 Information about this war is available in the India House Library of London which is a very large library and there are 20 thousand documents of the time of India's slavery
 vahaan uplabdh dastavej ke hisaab se angrejon ke paas plasi ke yuddh ke samay maatr 300 sipaahi the or sirajudaula ke paas 18 hajaar sipaahi
 The commander of the British army was Robert Clive and the commander of Siraj-daulah was Mirzafar
 robert clive ye jaanata tha kii aamane saamne kaa yuddh hua to ek ghanta bhi nahin lagegaa or ham yuddh haar jaayenge or clive ne kai baar chitthee likh ke british parliament ko ye bataaya bhi tha
 Clive also has two letters in these documents
 jisame usne ye prarthana kii he ki agar plasi kaa yuddh jeetna he to mujhe or sipaahi die jaaen
 In response to this, a letter was sent from the British Parliament that we are currently fighting a war against Napoleon Bonaparte and this war is more important to us than Plassey and we cannot give you more soldiers than this
 robert clive ne tab apane do jasoos lagaaye or unase kaha kii ja ke pataa lagaao kii sirajudaula ke fuj main koi aisa aadmi he jise ham rishwat de laalach de or rishwat ke laalach main apane desh se gaddari kar sake

 or wo aadmi tha mirajafar or mirajafar aisa aadmi tha jo din raat ek hi sapana dekhtaa tha kii wo kab bengal kaa nawab banegaa
 When Robert Clive learned these things, he wrote a letter to Mirzafar
 company ne iske baad kathputli nawab mir jafar ko satta de di kintu ye baat kisi ko pataa na thi ke satta company ke paas he
 Till the Nawab's court, he was called the donkey of Clive, the company officials had fiercely bribed the business of Bengal completely destroyed, apart from this there was utter chaos in Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke kaaran or parinaam' The Plassey War has a great importance in the history of modern India
 is yuddh ke dwaara east india company ne bengal ke nawab siraajudadaula ko parajeet kar bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali
 Therefore, this war has a special place in the decisive wars of India
 bengal mughal samrajya kaa ek abhinn ang tha
 But after Aurangzeb's death, under it, he declared his independence in various provinces
 jisamen alvardi khan ne bengal par apana adhikaar kar liya
 He had no son
 sirf teen putriyaan thi
 The elder girl was a sixed Begum childless
 duusari or teesri se ek- ek putr the
 Which was named Shaukatganj, and Siraj-ud-daula
 ve sirajuddaula ko adhik pyaar karte the
 Therefore, during his life time he had declared his successor
 10 april 1756 ko alvardi kii mrityu hui
 And Siraj-ud-daula became the Nawab of Bengal but from the very beginning his struggle with the East India Company became inevitable
 ant main 23 june 1757 ko donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa jise plasi yuddh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There were many reasons for this war which are as follows
 aantarik sangharsh- Siraj-ud-daula faced the struggle of Shaukatganj as soon as he sat on the throne as Shaukatganj wanted to become the Nawab
 isamen chhasiti begum tathaa uske divaan rajwallaav or mughal samraat kaa samarthan use praapt tha is liye sirajuddaula ne sabase pehle us aantarik sangharsh ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Because of this, the interference of British in Bengal politics was increasing, the Nawab killed Shaukatganj
 or iske pashchaat usne angrejon se muqabla karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Conspiracy against the Nawab by the British prarambh se hi angrejon kii aakhen bengal par lagi hui thi
 Because Bengal was a fertile and rich province
 agar bengal par company kaa adhikaar ho jaataa to use adhik se adhik dhan kamaane kii aashaa thi
 Not only this, they joined the Hindu traders and started provoking them against the Nawab
 The Nawab did not like it
 vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa upyog- The British were allowed to do free maritime trade by the Mughal emperor but the British started misusing it
 ve apana vyaktigat vyapaar bhi ni:shulk karne lage or deshi vyapaariyon ko bina chungi die vyapaar karne ke liye protsaahit karne lage
 This caused economic damage to the Nawab
 nawab inhen pasand nahin karata tha jab, unhone vyapaarik suvidhaon ke durupyog ko band karne kaa nishchay kiya to angrej sangharsh par utar aae
 Forts were closed by the British is samay europe main saptavarshiya yuddh chhidane kii ashanka thi
 In which England and France were to fight against each other, so also in other country which were British and French
 unhe yuddh kii ashanka thi
 So to strengthen his position, he started fortifications
 nawab ise bardaast nahin kar saktaa tha
 The British did not recognize Siraj-ud-daula as Nawab
 bengal kii pracheen parampara ke anusaar agar koi nayaa nawab gaddi par baithta tha to us din darvaar lagati thi
 And the representatives of the kings, rich or foreign castes residing under him had to present and present gifts in the court
 ki ve naye nawab ko sweekaar karte hai
 But on the occasion of the coronation of Siraj-ud-daula, no British representative appeared in the court
 kyonki ve sirajuddaula ko nawab nahin maanate the iske chalate bhi donon ke bich sangharsh kii sanmbhaavna badhati gai
 Trying to change the Nawab angrej sirajuddaula ko hataa kar kisi aise vyakti ko nawab bananaa chaahate the jo uske ishaare par chalane ke liye taiyaar ho iske liye angrejon ne prayaas karnaa shuru kiya
 In such a situation, the struggle could not be avoided
 kalakatta par akraman- When the Nawab issued an order to stop the captivity of the fort, the British paid no heed to him and he continued to build the fort
 isapar nawab krodhit ho uthaa or 4 june 1756 ko kasimbazar kii kothi par akraman kar diya
 The British soldiers were frightened by this attack and the British were defeated and the Nawab took over the Qasim Bazar
 iske baad nawab ne shighr hi kalakatta ke fort wilia par akraman kiya yahan angrej sainik bhi nawab ke samaksh tik nahin paaya or isapar bhi nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In this war, many British soldiers were arrested
 kaali kothri kii durghatana- In the above battle, the Nawab imprisoned 146 British soldiers, then locked him in a small dark cell, its length was 18 feet and width was 14-10 feet
 yah angrejon ke dwaara banaaya gaya tha or isamen bhartiya aparaadhiyon ko band kiya jaataa tha
 Since it was a hot summer day and the culmination of the war, 123 soldiers died due to suffocation and 23 soldiers survived, including Yeswell, an English soldier
 usee ke is ghatana kii jaankaree madras ke angrejon ko di
 This accident is known as the black closet accident
 iske chalate angrejon kaa krodh bhadak uthaa or ve nawab se yuddh kii taiyaari karne lage
 The British re-occupied Calcutta
 apni paraajay kaa badla lene ke liye angrej ne sheeghra hi kalakatta par akraman kar diya
 At this time the Nawab appointed Manikchand as the king of Calcutta
 lekin vah angrejon kaa mitra or shubhachintak tha
 As a result, the British conquered Calcutta was freed from the clutches of the Nawab
 9 farvari 1757 ko donon ke bich ali nagar kii sandhi hui or angrejon ko phir se sabhi tarah ke vyavhaarik adhikaar uplabdh ho gaya
 British invasion of French angrejon ne francisiyon kii vasti chand nagar par akraman kar diya
 And took him under control

 Secret treaty with Mirzafar - isi samay angrejon ne nawab ko padchyut karne ke liye ek shadyantra rachaa
 Many people of the Nawab were also involved in this
 jaise- raidurlabh pradhan senapati mirajafar or dhani vyapakir jagat sevak aadi
 The British made a temptation to make Mirzafar the Nawab of Bengal and after this treaty of secret treaty with him, the Nawab was accused that he had violated the treaty of Ali Nagar and by making the same excuse, the British attacked the Nawab on 22 June 1757
 Attacked
 plasi yuddh ke maidan main ghamaasan yuddh prarambh hua mirajafar to pehle hi angrejon se sandhi kar chukaa tha falat: nawab kii jabardast paraajay hui
 The British won
 nawab kii hatya kar di gai or mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 Results of the Battle of Plassey plasi yuddh ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British were made Nawabs
 plasi kaa yuddh vastav main koi yuddh nahin tha yah ek shadyantra or vishwasghaati kaa pradarshan tha prasiddh itihaaskaar ‘panivkar’ ke anusaar plasi kaa yuddh nahin, parantu iskaa parinaam kaaphi mahatvapurn niklaa
 Therefore, it has a place in the decisive wars of the world
 kyonki isi ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 Clive has called this war a revolution
 vastav main yah ek kranti thi kyonki iske dwaara bhartiya itihaas kii dhara main mahaan parivartan aa gaya or ek vyapaarik sanstha ne bengal kii rajanithik bagdor apane haathon main le lee
 Different types of results are visible
 raajnneetik parinaam- Its political consequences proved fatal for India
 iske dwaara ek vyapaarik sanstha ke haathon main raajnneetik adhikaron kaa samavesh hua or bharat main angreji satta kaayam hua
 In fact, it was of great importance to the British nation, after this war Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 parantu yah k ayogy vyakti tha
 Taking the disqualification of its inefficiency, the actual ruler of Bengal became the British
 bengal par angrejon kaa prabhaav badhata gaya or dhire- 2 british samrajya ke vistaar kaa maarg saaf hota gaya
 With the withdrawal of siraj-ud-daula, the British had the advantage of increasing political dominance
 mughal samrajya ke liye bi plasi kaa parinaam ghaatak siddh hua bengal se prativarsh mughal shaasha ko acchhee aamadani hoti thi lekin ab yah aamadani samaapt ho gai
 The British came to know about the weakness of the Indian King
 bhavishya main usne uskaa kaaphi phayda uthaaya or uttari bharat kii vijay kaa maarg prashast hua
 Economic consequences is yuddh ke dwaara angrejon ko kaaphi aarthik laabh pahunchaa mirajafar ne company ko 1 karod 17 lakh rupee diye jisase company kii aarthik sthiti kaaphi majboot ho gai bengal kii lut se bi use kaaphi dhan haath laga
 The monastery employees of the company got Rs 12 and a half lakh
 clive ko do lakh 24 hajaar rupye mili
 After this war, the company gradually became the 2nd Diwan of Bengal
 is prakaar iske dwaara bharat main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British got the right to trade again
 Mirzafar provided 3 crore rupees to the company as an encroachment and the business also made a profit of 15 crores
 By- Mohammad Shahid a new political power emerged from this incident

 The weakness of the Mughal Empire was also cleared

 iskaa itihaas shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 It is a form of defined western Hindi
 'khadi boli' vartmaan hindi kaa ek rup he jisamen sanskrit ke shabdon kii bahulata karke vartmaan hindi bhashaa kii sristi kii gai or farsi tathaa arabi ke shabdon kii adhikta karke vartmaan urdu bhashaa kii sristi kii gai he
 In other words, the dialect that does not have the impression of Braj or Awadhi etc
 is cold Hindi
 khadi boli aaj kii rashtrabhasha hindi kaa purv rup he
 It is a form of defined western Hindi
 iskaa itihaas shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 At the time when the Muslims came and settled in this country, at that time they were required to accept one of the languages here
 ve praayah dilli or uske poorabi praanton main hi adhikta se based the or brajabhash tathaa avadhi bhashaayen, clisht hone ke kaaran apana nahin sakate the, isaliye unhone meerut or uske aasapaas kii boli grahan kii or uskaa naam khadi boli rakhaa
 In the same dialect, he slowly added Persian and Arabic words, which eventually led to the creation of the current Urdu language
 vikrami 14veen shatabdi main pehle-pahal amir khusro ne is prantiy boli kaa prayog karnaa aarambh kiya or usamen bahut kuch kavita kii, jo saral tathaa saras hone ke kaaran sheeghra hi prachlit ho gai
 For a long time, Muslims used to practice this dialect in the colloquial and literature, but later it started being propagated among Hindus as well
 15veen or 16 veen shatabdi main koi koi hindi ke kavi bhi apni kavita main kahin kahin iskaa prayog karne lage the, par unki sankhya praayah nahin ke samaan thi
 Most of the poetry continued to be in Awadhi and Vrajbhasha
 18veen shatavdhi main hindu bhi sahitya main iskaa vyavhaar karne lage, par padya main nahin, keval gadhy main; or tabhi se maanon vartmaan hindi gadhy kaa janm hua, jiske acharya munshi sadasukhlal, lallu ji laal or sadal mishra maane jate hai
 Just as Muslims created the current Urdu language by filling the words of Persian and Arabic etc
, similarly Hindus also introduced the current Hindi by increasing the number of Sanskrit words in it
 idhar thode dinon se kuch log sanskritprachur vartmaan hindi main bhi kavita karne lag gaye hai or kavita ke kaam ke liye usee ko khadi boli kehete hai
 a form of present-day Hindi in which a multiplicity of Sanskrit words has been created in the current Hindi language and by the excess of Persian and Arabic words, the present Urdu language has been created
 saahitiyik sandarbh main braj, avadhi aadi boliyon main sahitya kaa parthaky karne ke liye aadhunik hindi sahitya ko khadi boli sahitya ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 It is the most popular, simple and understandable language of India
 bihar, jharkhand, uttarapradesh, uttaranchal, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, himachal pradesh evam haryana hindi bhashabhashi rajya hai
 But apart from this, except for a few places in the far south, it is propagated in most of the country
 khadi boli anek naamon se abhihit kii gai he yatha-hindui, hindvi, dakkhini, dakhni yaa dakani, rekhta, hindostani, hindustani aadi
 Dr
 Grierson named it Vernacular Hindustani and Dr
 Suniti Kumar Chatterjee named it as Janpadiya Hindustani
 dow chatarji khadi boli ke saahitiyik rup ko sadhu hindi yaa nagari hindi ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 But Dr
 Grierson has given it the title of High Hindi
 isaki vyakhya vibhinn vidwaanon ne bhinn bhinn rup se kii he
 The following categories of opinions of these scholars are- atyant pracheen kaal se hi himalay tathaa vindhyas parvat ke bich kii bhoomi aryaavart ke naam se prakhyat he
 The region in between is called Madhya Pradesh, which is the focal point of Indian culture and civilization
 sanskrit, pali tathaa shauraseni praakrit vibhinn yugon main is madhyadesh kii bhashaa thi
 After the Shaurseni Prakrit in chronology, the Shaurseni Apabhramsa was propagated in this region
 yah kathy shauraseni apbhransh bhashaa hi kalantar main kadachit khadi boli ke rup main parinat hui he
 Thus the origin of the Khadi dialect is believed to be from the Shaurseni Apabhramsa, although the development of this Apabhransh is not found in literary form
 bhoj or hammirdev ke samay se apbhransh kaavyon kii jo parampara chalati rahi uske bheetar khadi boli ke pracheen rup kii jhalak dikhaai padati he
 After this, in the beginning of Bhaktikal, the saint poet of Nirguna stream used to treat Khadi Boli in his Sadhukkari language
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki musalamaanon ke dwaara hi khadi boli astitv main laai gai or uskaa mularoop urdu he, jisase aadhunik hindi kii bhashaa arabi farsi shabdon ko nikaalkar garh lee gai
 According to the opinion of the famous philologist, Dr
 Grierson, the standing dialect is a gift of the British
 mughal samrajya ke dhwans se khadi boli ke prachaar main sahaayta pahaunchi
 The way Ur, Urdu, Mir, Insha, etc
, many of the Urdu poets started coming towards the east, in the same way, the Hindu traders around Delhi started spreading to the eastern cities of Lucknow, Faizabad, Prayag, Kashi, Patna, etc
 for livelihood
 inke saath hi saath unki bolchaal kii bhashaa khadi boli bhi lagi chalati thi
 In this way, the language of the market of big cities also became very spoken
 yah khadi boli asli or swaabhaavik bhashaa thi, maulaviyon or munshiyon kii urdu-e-mualla nahin
 With regard to the first half of the 19th century, he writes that it was the time of the birth of the Hindi language, which was invented by the British and was first used as a literary prose by Lallu Ji Lal in his Prem Sagar under the command of Gilchrist
 lallu ji laal or pan sadal mishra ko khadi boli ke unnayak athwa isko pragati pradaan karanevaala to mana ja saktaa he, parantu inhen khadi boli kaa janmdata kahana satya se yukt tathaa tathyon se pramanit nahin he
 After careful consideration of the ancient tradition of Khadi Boli, the inaccuracy of this statement proves itself
 musalamaanon ke dwaara iske prasar main sahaayta avashya praapt hui
 Urdu is not an independent language, but only a genre of standing dialect, in which the majority of Persian and Arabic words are found and which are written in Persian script
 urdu sahitya ke itihaas par dhyaan dene se yah baat spasht pramanit he
 Many Muslim poets have written poetry in Persian mixed dialect, which they called 'rekhta'
 yah parampara 18veen 19veen shatee main dilli ke antim badshaah bahadurshah tathaa lakhanu ke antim nawab vaajibili shah tak chalati rahi
 Generally, Lallu Ji Lal, Sadal Mishra, Inshalla Khan and Munshi Sadasuklal are known as the founders of Khadi Boli prose but none of them have the privilege of revealing its tradition
 aadhunik khadi boli gadhy kii parampara kii pratishtha kaa shrey bhaaratendu babu harishchandra evam raja shivaprasad sitarehind ko praapt he jinhone apni rachanaaon ke dwaara ek saral sarvasammat gadhyshailee kaa pravartan kiya
 Later, people adopted the style of Bharatendu more
 vastut: aadhunik hindi sahitya khadi boli kaa hi sahitya he jiske liye devanagari lipi kaa saamanyat: vyavhaar kiya jaataa he or jisamen sanskrit, paali, praakrit aadi ke shabdon or prakrutiyon ke saath desh main prachlit anek bhashaaon or janboliyon kii chaaya apane tadbhav rup main vartmaan he

 serialkiller shabd ek us vyaktitv ko paribhaashit karata he jo ek samay antaraal yaa ek hi dhang ko apana kar teen yaa teen se zyada qatl kar chukaa ho yaa kar rahaa ho us vyaktitv ko ham serialkiller kehete hai

 3

 4

 Due to this, there is a lot of hate and hatred in his mind due to the exploitation done by the people around him or by the people around him and he gets himself safe by killing people because of this atrocity
 Understands unke ateet me kuch aisi koi ghatana jo unke andar us tareeke ke logo yaa us tareeke ke vyaktitv ke viruddh man me ghrinaa utpan karadet he or usee tarah ke vyaktitv ko dekhar unke man krodh aajaata he jisaki vajah se apane dimagi santulan ko kho dete he or vah ghatana ko anjaam de detaa he
 By doing what he does for his peace of mind and complacency, he is a belief in his mind which remains in the mind of the person only because of the exploitation with him, when he executes this incident
 He loses his mind balance at that time and he does not know whether he is doing right or wrong
 par ham yah har kesh me nahi kah sakate kyonki kuch vyakti ko yah karnaa sirf apane man kii khusi yaa santushti k liye karte he

 Parashurama was a Brahmin of Treta Yuga
 unhen vishnu kaa chatha avatar bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to the mythological accounts, he was born to Vaishak Shukla Tritiya from the womb of wife Renuka as a boon to Devraj Indra, pleased with the son's sacrifice performed by Bhrigushrestha Maharishi Jamadagni
 ve bhagwaan vishnu ke chathe avatar the

 Subsequently, after learning in the ashram of Lord Shankar, located on Kailash Girishringa, he received the specific Divyastra Vidyubhi
 shivaji se unhen shrikrishna kaa trailoky vijay kavach, stavraj stotra evam mantra kalpataru bhi praapt hue
 Pleased with the difficult austerity done in Chakratirtha, Lord Vishnu gave him the blessing to stay on tapasyarat bhooloka for the whole of Kalpanta after Tejoharan when Ramavatar in Treta
 ve shastravidya ke mahaan guru the
 He gave armaments to Bhishma, Drona and Karna
 unhone ekadash chhandyukt "shiv panchatwarinshnam stotra" bhi likhaa
 The intended fruit-provider Parshuram Gayatri is- "ॐ Jamadagnayya Vidmahe Mahavirai Dheemahi, Tannoparashurama: Prachodayat
 " ve purushon ke liye aaajeevan ek patnivrath ke pakshdhar the
 He also conducted the Virat nari-jagriti Abhiyan with the support of Atri's wife Anasuya, Agastya's wife Lopamudra and his beloved disciple Akitavana
 avshesh kaaryo main kalki avatar hone par unka gurupad grahan kar unhen shastravidya pradaan karnaa bhi bataaya gaya he
 Parashuramji has been mentioned in many books like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana and Kalki Purana
 ve ahamkaari or dhrist haihay vanshi kshatriyon kaa prithvi se 21 baar sanhaar karne ke liye prasiddh hai
 He wanted to spread the Vedic culture on the earth
 kaha jaataa he ki bharat ke adhikansh gram unheen ke dwaara basaaye gayi
 Which includes Konkan, Goa and Kerala
 puranic katha ke anusaar bhagwaan parashuram ne tir chalaa kar gujarat se lekar kerala tak samudr ko pichhe dhakel te hue nai bhoomi kaa nirmaan kiya
 And for this reason, Lord Parashurama in Konkan, Goa and Kerala is worshipable and Brahmins born of arrow sharpener are also called Brahmarshi Brahmins, in which Bhumihar Brahmins of Bihar, Chittapavan of Maharashtra, Mohyal of Punjab believe in their successor Lord Parashurama
 ve bhargav gotra kii sabase aagyaakaari santaanon main se ek the, jo sadaiv apane gurujanon or mata pita kii ajna kaa paalan karte the
 He always respected the elders and never disregarded them
 unka bhav is jeev sristi ko iske prakritik saundarya sahit jivant banaaye rakhana tha
 He wanted this whole world to live for animals, birds, trees, fruits and whole nature
 unka kahana tha ki raja kaa dharm vaidic jivan kaa prasar karnaa he naaki apni praja se ajnapaalan karwaanaa
 He was born as a Brahmin but was a Kshatriya by karma
 unhen bhargav ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is also known that Parshuram learned most of his knowledge from his mother's teachings in his childhood
 ve pashu-pakshiyon tak kii bhashaa samajhate the or unase baat kar sakate the
 Even many ferocious wild animals became their friends only by their touch
 unhone sainyashiksha keval brahmanon ko hi di
 But there are some exceptions like Bhishma and Karna
 unke jane-maane shishy the - Karna did not know that he is a Kshatriya by birth
 vah sadaiv hi swayan ko samajhataa rahaa lekin uskaa samarthy chupa na rah sakaa
 He did not tell Parashuram that he is a prince and got education from Lord Parashuram
 yadi karn unhe apane shudra hone kii baat bataa bhi dete to bhi bhagwaan parashuram karn ke tej or samarthy ko dekh unhe saharsha shiksha dene ko taiyaar ho jate
 But when Parashurama came to know about this, he cursed Karna that all his knowledge taught will not work for him when he needs it most
 isliye jab kurukshetra ke yuddh main karn or arjuna aamane saamne hote he tab vah arjuna dwaara maar diya jaataa he kyonki us samay karn ko brahmastra chalaane kaa gyaan dhyaan main hi nahin rahaa
 In ancient times, a king named Gadhi ruled in Kannauj
 unki satyavati naam kii ek atyant rupavati kanya thi
 King Gadhi married Satyavati to Bhrigunandan Rishiak
 satyavati ke vivaah ke pashchaat vahaan bhrigu rishi ne aakar apni putravadhu ko aashirwad diya or usase var maangane ke liye kaha
 Seeing this, Satyavati pleaded with the son of a son for his mother
 satyavati kii yachana par bhrigu rishi ne use do charu paatr dete huye kaha ki jab tum or tumhaari mata ritu snaan kar chuki ho tab tumhaari maan putr kii ichha lekar pipal kaa aalingan karnaa or tum usee kaamana ko lekar gooler kaa aalingan karnaa
 Then take these variables given by me with caution separately
 idhar jab satyavati kii maan ne dekha ki bhrigu ne apane putravadhu ko uttam santaan hone kaa charu diya he to usne apane charu ko apni putree ke charu ke saath badal diya
 In this way Satyavati consumed her mother's charu
 yogashakti se bhrigu ko is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya or ve apni putravadhu ke paas aakar bole ki putree! tumhaari mata ne tumhaare saath chal karke tumhaare charu kaa seven kar liya he
 Therefore, now your child will behave like a Kshatriya despite being a Brahmin and your mother's child will behave like a Brahmin despite being a Kshatriya
 is par satyavati ne bhrigu se vinati kii ki aap aashirwad den ki meraa putr brahman kaa hi aacharan kare, bhale hi meraa pautra kshatriya jaisaa aacharan kare
 Pleased, Bhrigu accepted her request
 samay aane par satyavati ke garbh se jamadagni kaa janm hua
 Jamadagni was very stunning
 bade hone par unka vivaah prasenjit kii kanya renuka se hua
 He had five sons from Renuka, whose names were Rukmavan, Sukhen, Vasu, Vishvanas and Parashurama
 shrimadbhagwat main drushtaant he ki gandharvaraj chitrarath ko apsaraon ke saath vihaar karata dekh havan hetu ganga tat par jal lene gai renuka aasakt ho gayi or kuch der tak vahiin ruk gayin
 Enraged by the lapse of the Havan period, Jamadagni ordered all the sons to kill Mata Renuka as a punishment for his wife's anti-arya conduct and mental adultery
 anya bhaaiyon dwaara aisa dussahas na kar paane par pita ke tapobal se prabhavit parashuram ne unki aagyaanusaar mata kaa shiroched evam unhen bachaane hetu aage aaye apane samast bhaaiyon kaa vadh kar daalaa
 Pleased with his work, when Jamadagni urged him to ask for the groom, Parashuram asked for the blessing of everyone being revived and the memory of his slaughter being destroyed
 kathanak he ki haihay vanshadhipati karttvirarjun ne ghor tap dwaara bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kar ek sahastra bhujaayen tathaa yuddh main kisi se parrast na hone kaa var paaya tha
 Coincidentally, he ventures into the forest to Jamadagnimuni's ashram and takes Kamadhenu by force, snatching Kamdhenu, disobeying Lobashish Jamadagni, at the wonderful hospitality of the entire army, assisted by Kapila Kamadhenu, provided to him by Devraj Indra
 kupit parashuram ne farse ke prahaar se uski samast bhujaayen kaat daaleen va sir ko dhad se pruthak kar diya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons killed his meditative father Jamadagni in the absence of Parashurama as a vengeance
 renuka pati kii chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 Parshuram, angry with this scandal, attacked the city of Mahishmati with full speed and took possession of it
 iske baad unhone ek ke baad ek puure ikkis baar is prithvi se kshatriyon kaa vinaash kiya
 Not only this, he filled the five ponds of Sthalat Panchak area with the blood of Haihay Vanshi Kshatriyas and performed the father's shraddha with the blood of Sahastrajun's sons
 ant main maharishi richik ne prakat hokar parashuram ko aisa ghor krity karne se roka
 After this, he performed Ashwamedha Mahayagya and donated the earth containing Saptadweep to Maharishi Kashyapa
 keval itnaa hi nahin, unhone devraj indra ke samaksh apane shastr tyaag diye or sagar dwaara ucchhisht bhubhag mahendra parvat par ashram banaakar rahane lage
 Parashurama is believed to have destroyed the Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas 21 times
 kshatriyon kaa ek varg he jise haihyavanshi samaaj kaha jaataa he yah samaaj aaj bhi he
 Sahastrajun was a king in this society
 parashuram ne isi raja or inke putr or pautron kaa vadh kiya tha or unhen iske liye 21 baar yuddh karnaa padaa tha
 Who was Sahastrarjun ?: Sahastrarjun was a Chandravanshi king whose ancestors were Mahishmant
 mahishmant ne hi narmada ke kinare mahishmati naamak nagar basaaya tha
 Later, after Durdum, Kritavirya, the eldest of the four sons of Kanak, assumed the throne of Mahishmati
 bhargav vanshi brahman inke raaj purohit the
 Kritavirya had a good relationship with Bhargava chief Jamadagni Rishi
 kritaviry ke putr kaa naam bhi arjuna tha
 Being the son of Kritavirya, he is also called Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ne apni aradhana se bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kiya tha
 Lord Dattatreya had given Kartavirajun a boon to receive the force of a thousand hands at the time of war, due to which he came to be called Sahastrajun or Sahasrabahu
 sahatrarjun ke parakram se ravan bhi ghabaraata tha
 Reason for the war: Sahastrajun was killed due to the curse of the sage Vasishta
 sahatrarjun ne parashuram ke pita jamadagni ke ashram main ek kapila kamdhenu gaay ko dekha or use paane kii laalasaa se vah kamdhenu ko balpurvak ashram se le gaya
 When Parashurama came to know about this, he thought of bringing back Kamadhenu for the honor of his father and fought with Sahastrajun
 yuddh main sahatrarjun kii sabhi bhujaayen cat gayi or vah maaraa gaya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons retaliated and killed his father Jamadagni in Parashurama's absence
 parashuram kii maan renuka pati kii hatya se vichlit hokar unki chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 This terrible incident enraged Parashurama and he vowed - "I will die by destroying all the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya dynasty"
 uske baad unhone ahamkaari or dusht prakruti ke haihyavanshi kshatriyon se 21 baar yuddh kiya
 Burning in anger, Parashurama first captured the Mahishmati city of the Haihayavans and then killed Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ke divangat hone ke baad unke paanch putr jaidhvaj, shurasen, shur, vrish or krishna apane astitv kii ladaai ladate rahe
 In the Brahmavaivarta Purana, the story is found that Parshuram tried to force his entry into Ganesh ji when he entered the harem of Lord Shankar at Kailash
 tab ganpati ne unhen stambhit kar apni sund main lapetakar samast lokon kaa bhraman karaate hue golok main bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa darshan karake bhootal par patake diya
 On coming into consciousness, one of Ganesha's teeth broke due to the blow of the ax made by the angry Parshuramji, so that he was called Ekadanta
 unhone tretayug main ramavatar ke samay shivaji kaa dhanush bhang hone par akaash-maarg dwaara mithilapuri pahunch kar pratham to swayan ko "vishwa-vidit kshatriya kul drohi" bataate hue "bahut bhanti tinh aankh dikhaaye" or krodhandh ho "sunhu ram jehi shivadhanu tora, sahasabahu sam so ripu mora" tak kah daalaa
 Thereafter, after clearing the doubt of his power, Vaishnav handed Dhanush to Shri Ram and returned to the forest for penance, apologizing "unjustly saying too much ignorance, forgiving forgiveness"
 ramcharita maanas kii ye panktiyaan sakshi hai- "kah jai jai jai raghukulaketu, bhrigupati gayi vanhin tap hetu"
 According to the story narrated in Valmiki Ramayana, Dasharathanandan Sriram worshiped Jamadagni Kumar Parashurama and Parashurama revolved around Ramachandra and proceeded towards the ashram
 jate jate bhi unhone shriram se unke bhakton kaa satat saannnidhya evam charnaravindon ke prati sudruth bhakthi kii hi yachana kii thi
 Amba came to Parashurama seeking vengeance and help as Bhishma did not accept it
 tab sahaayta kaa aashwaasan dete hue unhone bhishma ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 There was a fierce battle between them for 23 days
 kintu apane pita dwaara ichha mrityu ke vardaan swarup parashuram unhen haraa na sake
 Parashurama was donating his lifetime's earnings to the Brahmins, when Dronacharya reached him
 kintu durbhagyavash ve tab tak sab kuch daan kar chuke the
 Parshuram then kindly asked Dronacharya to choose any weapon
 tab chatur dronacharya ne kaha ki main aapke sabhi astr shastr unke mantron sahit chahta hoon taaki jab bhi unki aavashyaktaa ho, prayog kiya ja sake
 Parashuramaji said- "evamastu!" That is to be so
 isse dronacharya shastr vidya main nipun ho gayi
 Parashurama was also a guru of Karna
 unhone karn ko bhi vibhinn prakaar ki astr shiksha di thi or brahmastra chalaanaa bhi sikhaaya tha
 But Karna was the son of a sutra, yet knowing that Parashurama only donated his discipline to Brahmins, Karna tricked and tried to take the genre from Parashurama
 parashuram ne use brahman samaj kar bahut si vidyaayen sikhaayin, lekin ek din jab parashuram ek vriksh ke neeche karn kii godi main sar rakhke so rahe the, tab ek bhunra aakar karn ke pair par kaatane laga, apane guruji kii neend main koi avrodh na aaye isaliye karn bhunre ko sehta rahaa, bhunra karn ke pair ko buree tarah kaate ja rahaa tha, bhore ke kaatane ke kaaran karn kaa khun bahane laga
 He reached the feet of the bleeding Parshuram
 parashuram kii neend khul gayi or ve is khun ko turant pahchaan gayi ki yah khun to kisi kshatriya kaa hi ho saktaa he jo itani der tak bagaiyr uf kiye bahata rahaa
 Due to this incident Karna could not get the benefit of his weapon
 ek anya katha ke anusaar ek baar guru parashuram karn kii ek jangha par sir rakhkar so rahe the
 Just then a scorpion came from somewhere and started making wounds on Karna's thigh
 kintu guru kaa vishram bhang naa ho, isaliye karn bichchhu ke dansh ko sahataa rahaa
 Suddenly Parashuram's sleep broke and knowing that a Brahmin son could not have enough tolerance to bear the scorpion bites
 karn ke mithyabhaashan par unhone use ye shraap de diya ki jab use apni vidya kii sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi, tab vah uske kaam nahin aayegi
 Vishwavandya Mahabahu Parashurama was born on Vaishakh Shukla Tritiya from the womb of Renuka, as a boon to Devraj Indra, pleased with the soneshti yagya performed by Bhrigushrestha Maharishi Jamadagni
 ve bhagwaan vishnu ke aaveshavatar the
 According to the Kalki Purana, Parashurama would be the guru of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu and would teach him war
 ve hi kalki ko bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke unke divyastra ko praapt karne ke liye kahenge
 Lord Parashurama was a great knowledge of weapons education

 Vadakkan Kalari is the predominant style of weapons
 Earth-lighting-equinox pl
png In astronomy, the equinox is the moment of time on the basis of which the elements of an astronomical coordinate system are defined
 udhaaharan ke liye bhumadhyi nirdeshaank pranali aisi ek prakaar kii paddati he or isamen khagoleey madhya rekha, khagoleey dhruv or basant vishuv kii disha ko pehle se tay karke kisi bhi vastu kaa sthaan inke hisaab se lagaaya jaataa he
 Keep in mind that these all change with time, so in an astronomical coordinate system, one time is considered as the standard, and the coordinates are told based on the same
 'vishuv' yug se alag chiz he kyonki yug vah samay hota he ki jab kisi khagoleey vastu kii sthiti maapi gai ho
 a simple comparison can be made to understand 'equinox' and 'yuga'
 farz kijiye kii ek anant vistrut maidan par vyakti 'amit' khadaa he lekin vah nirantar chal rahaa he
 Also imagine that many other people 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', etc
 are also on that ground and they too are constantly moving from place to place
 ab agar ham chahen to 'amit' par aadhaarit ek aasaan-si nirdeshaank paddati bana sakate hai
 We can say that at exactly five o'clock on 15 March 2012, where 'amit' was, he is the center of our coordinate system
 yah kshan 'vishuv' kehalaayegaa
 Now we can tell the location of other objects at any other moment
 ham kah sakate hai ki 20 march 2012 ko thik nau baje vyakti 'kha' amit ke vishuv vaale sthaan se 10 meter mukh kii ore or 8 meter dai ore tha
 This time will be called 'yuga'
 dhyaan den ki 'yug' ke kshan main 'amit' vahaan se hill chukaa tha jahaan se nirdeshaank bataae ja rahen hai lekin spashtataa se sthiti bataane ke liye 'amit' ke 'vishuv' ke kshan vaale sthaan ko hi mul centre banaakar sabhi sthitiyaan bataai ja raheen hai
 The positions of objects in astronomy are stated in this way
 kaafii samay tak yah sthitiyaan bilkul thik to nahin lekin kaafii had tak thik hoti hai
 But after many years, it becomes so different that astronomers update their local tables by choosing the new equinox and epoch
 aamtaur par nae chune jane vaale vishuv or yug ke kshanon ko naam die jate hai
 The equinox currently used by astronomers is J2000
0 and is the 12 o'clock moment of 1 January 2000
 is se pehle prayog hone vaale maanak vishuv kaa naam B1950
0 tha

 It is said that when Atri Muni was doing penance just a few distance from here, his wife Ansuiya made his abode at this place following Pativrat Dharma

 According to the legend, then, these trudevi Goddess Anasuiya reach the ashram in the monk to take the test and she expressed her desire for food
 lekin unhone anusuia ke saamne pan rakhaa ki vah unhen god main baitaakar upar se nirvastr hokar aalingan ke saath bhojan karaayengi
 Anasuya got confused on this
 unhone ankhen band apane pati kaa samaran kiya to saamne khadey saadhuon ke rup main unhen brahma, vishnu or mahesh khadey dikhalaai die
 Anusuiya remembered her husband in her own mind and these trinity became six months old
 tab mata anasuia ne tridevon ko unke pan ke anuroop hi bhojan karaayaa
 In this way, Tridev began to enjoy childhood
 udhar teenon deviyaan patiyon ke viyog main dukhi ho gai
 Then at the behest of Narada Muni, she started praying to Anasuiya to bring her husbands in the original form
 apane satitv ke bal par anasuia ne teenon devon ko phir se purv main laa diya
 Since then, she became famous as Mother Sati Ansuiya
