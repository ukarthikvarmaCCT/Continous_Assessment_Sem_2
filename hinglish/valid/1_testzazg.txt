 The school is the place where education is imparted
 ""vidhyalay ek aisi sanstha he jahaan bacchon ke shaareerik,maansik,boudhik evam naitik gunon kaa vikaas hota he
 The word 'school' is used in anglo-english for the word 'school', which is derived from the Greek word 'skohla' or 'skhole', which means 'holiday'
 This meaning seems somewhat strange, but the reality is that in ancient Greece, only vacation spots were referred to as schools
 The holiday period itself was considered as 'self-development', which was practiced at a fixed place called 'vacation', gradually these holiday places became institutions that impart knowledge of a certain purpose and curriculum i

 Or history is the description of events related to mankind, coming from antiquity to newness

 jivan kii bahumukhi vyapaktaa ke kaaran swalp saamagree ke sahare vigat yug athwa samaaj kaa chitranirmaan karnaa du:saadhy he
 The more the material gets, the more proportionally it becomes possible to present the outline of the bygone era and society
 paryaapt sadhano ke hote hue bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kalpanamishrit chitra nishchit rup se shuddh yaa satya hi hoga
 Therefore, due to lack of appropriate attention, some scholars say that the entirety of history is irretrievable, yet if our experience and knowledge is abundant, our art is rationalized for the investigation of historical material and imagination is controlled and developed, then our picture of the past Can be more humane and authentic
 saransh yah he ki itihaas kii rachana main paryaapt saamagree, vaigyanik dhang se uski jaanch, usase praapt gyaan kaa mahatv samajhane ke vivek ke saath hi saath aitihaasak kalpana kii shakti tathaa sajiv chithran kii kshamta kii aavashyaktaa he

 us sab saamagree kii jaanch padtaal kii vaigyanik kala kaa bhi vikaas hota gaya
 The art of confusing the received knowledge into living language has made astonishing progress, yet for the philosophy of the past, imagination is somewhat practiced, but mostly dependent on the natural ability and subtle and revolutionary vision of the person
 yadhyapi itihaas kaa aarambh asia main hua, tathaapi uskaa vikaas europe main vishesh rup se hua
 It is a special credit to the Chinese in Asia, but more than that to the Islamic people, who knew the importance of chronology well
 musalamaanon ke aane ke pehle hinduon kii itihaas sambandh main apni anokhi dhaaran thi
 Instead of chronology, they were appeased by collecting some of the basic elements of the era of cultural and religious development or degradation and symbolically describing the propagation and symbolism of thoughts and feelings
 unka itihaas praaia: kavyarup main miltaa he jisamen sab kachi-pakki saamagree mili juli, uljhi or guthi padi he
 Some efforts are being made to resolve it, but due to lack of chronology, there are severe difficulties

 There are no thousands of streams of history

 The field of history is very wide
 prayek vyakti, vishay, anveshan andolan aadi kaa itihaas hota he, yahan tak ki itihaas kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Hence, it can be said that historical approach has its own special feature like other philosophical, scientific etc

 Historical knowledge of its development is considered essential for the study of each subject from the 19th century onwards

 History is often written of cities, provinces and special countries or eras

 Some scholars are of the opinion that if the study of world history and human tendencies were attempted to extract some universal principles, then history would lose its individual feature by turning into sociology
 yah bhay itnaa chintajanak nahin he, kyonki samajashaastra ke liye itihaas kii utani hi aavashyaktaa he jitani itihaas ko samaajashastra kii
 In fact, the creation of sociology is possible only on history

 In its "golden Age" in the 1960s and 1970s, it was a prominent subject among scholars, and still holds a good foothold in the departments of history
 1975 se 1995 tak do dashakon main, america itihaas ke prophessoron kaa anupaat saamaajik itihaas ke saath-saath 31% se badhkar 41% ho gaya, jabaki raajnneetik itihaaskaaron kaa anupaat 40% se 30% tak gir gaya

 He said that after 1945, the trend has reversed, now social history has replaced it

 ve is jaankaree ko puratathvik sakshya ke madhyam se khojate hai, jo bhutkaal main praathmik strot jaise pandulipi,shilaalekh aadi main likhe gaye hote hai jaise jagah, naam aadi
 In the list of historians, historians can be grouped in the order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the period in which they specialized in the Chronicles and Enlist, although they are not historically true
 , They are also frequently included
 chhadmaitihaas un lekhon / rachanaaon ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he jinaki saamagree kii prakruti 'itihaas jaisi' hoti he kintu ve itihaas-lekhan kii maanak vidhiyon se mail nahin khaati

 The army of Asuras won this battle

 Then the defeated deity proceeded to Brahma ji and went to the place where Shiva went to Lord Vishnu
 sari katha kah sunai
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu and Shivji were very angry, because of that anger Vishnu, a sharp one was generated from Shivji's body
 bhagwaan shankar ke tej se us devi kaa mukh, vishnu ke tej se us devi kii vaayen, brahama ke tej se charan tathaa yamraj ke tej se bal, indra ke tej se kati pradesh tathaa anya devtaa ke tej se us devi kaa sharir bana

 As a result, the goddess started a war with Mahishasura
 jisamen devi ki vijay hui or tabhi se devi kaa naam mahisasur mardani pad gaya
 The Jwalamukhi temple is one of the Shakti Peetha temples

 shiv ke sasur raja daksh ne yajna kaa aayojan kiya jisame unhone shiv or sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya kyonki vah shiv ko apane baraabar kaa nahin samajhate the
 Sati felt very bad about this and reached the yagna without calling
 yajna sthal par shiv kaa kaaphi apmaan kiya gaya jise sati sahan na kar saki or vah havan kund main kud gayin
 When Lord Shankar came to know about this, he came and removed Sati's body from Havan Kund and started doing Tandava
 jis kaaran saare brahmand main haahaakaar much gaya
 To save the entire universe from this crisis, Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati from his Sudarshan Chakra into 51 parts which became the Shakti Peetha where he fell

 akbar ne jab dhyanu se poocha ki vah apane gaanvvaasiyon ke saath kahaan ja rahaa he to uttar main dhyanu ne kaha vah jotavaali ke darshano ke liye ja rahe hai
 Akbar said what strength does your mother have? And what can she do? Then Dhyanu said that she is going to protect the whole world
 aisa koi bhi kaary nahin he jo vah nahin kar sakati he
 Akbar cut the head of the horse of Dhyanu and said that if your mother has power, then add the head of the horse and make it alive

 The term ecology, the first ecology, was used in 1866 by the German biologist Ernest Häckel in his book "general Morpology Late Organisms"
 beesvin sadi ke armbh main manushya or uske paryaavaran ke bich sambandhon par adhyayan prarambh hua or ek saath kai vishyon main is ore dhyaan diya gaya
 The result was the compilation of human ecology

 For example mankind builds on the earth and also affects vegetation

 Those plants continue to spread
 beesvin shatabdi sadi main ye gyaat hua ki manushyon kii gatividhiyon kaa prabhaav prithvi or prakruti par sarvada sakaaratmak hi nahin padataa rahaa he
 Then humans became aware of the serious impact on the environment

 From a living cell to organ, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome and biosphere, interactions between organisms and their environment have different forms and evolution
 atah paristhitikeey adhyayan ke staron main pramukh hai: Like other ancient religions, Vedic philosophy has also believed that nature is vibrated with life
 sampoorn charachar jagat arthath prithvi, akaash, swarg, aag, vaayu, jal, vanaspati or jeev-jantu sab main daivatv kii dhara pravaahit he

 The Vedic ethos refers to a holistic life in which the needs of the body, intellect, mind and soul are taken care of
 sharir kii moolbhoot aavashyaktaa he khaanaa, kapadaa, makaan or iske baad chikitsa va anya sabhi bhautik sukh-suvidhaayen
 The mind is the center of desires, which wants wishes to be fulfilled

 According to a paper presented by Mr
 Gulab Kothari in Melbourne, so-called educated people are responsible for the destruction of ecology and environmental harmony

 According to the document of the agreement on the partition of India, the kings of the princely states had the right to choose one of the two nations, but Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Kashmir, wanted to keep his princely state independent and refrained from joining any nation
 angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke baad riyasat par riyasat par pakistani sainiko or pashtuno ke kabeelai ladaako ne hamalaa kar diya
 Fearing that the princely army would not be able to face them, the Maharaja sought military assistance from India

 But Pakistan disagreed on the validity of this merger
 chunki jati aadhaarit aankade uplabdh nahin the isaliye maharaj ke bharat se vilay ke peeche kya kaaran the yah tay paanaa kathin tha
 Pakistan argued that the Maharaja did not have the right to call the Indian Army because before the arrival of the British there was no post of the Maharaja of Kashmir and this post was appointed by the British only
 isaliye pakistan ne yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya par uske sena pramukh duglas greysi ne is aashay ke pakistani pradhanmantri kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya
 His reasoning was that the Indian forces occupying Kashmir were representing the British state and hence they could not fight it

 The tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir were busy in looting after the initial successes, and they proceeded to delay attacking the easily occupied new territories, and the Indian army was flown in as soon as the Maharaja agreed to merge with India
 With the help, he gave a chance to reach the soldiers

 In physics, black body is an idealized state of matter, which absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it
 krishnika ek vishesh or satat varnakram main vikiran ko avashoshit or garm hone par phir se utsarjit karte hai
 Because no light is reflected or transmitted and when the object is cold, black appears
 haalanki ek krishnika taapmaana par nirbhar prakaash varnakram kaa utsarjan karata he
 This solar radiation emitted from the black body is called the black body radiation
 krishnika ke varnakram main tarang kii lambaai jitani choti hoti he, aavriti utani hi zyada hoti he or ucch aavriti ucch taapmaana se sambandhit hoti he
 Thus, the color of a hot object is closer to the blue end of the spectrum and the color of a colder object is closer to red

 This can also happen without regard to the wavelength of the radiation entering
 The hole will then form a close approximation to a theoretical black body and if the cavity is heated, the spectrum of radiation of the hole will be constant, although it will also be necessary to ensure that some of the almost completely black material is placed in the cavity and Also that the balance has been maintained and maintained, but with these provisions, it no longer depends on other materials of the cavity
 
 Calculating the rotation of the black body was a major challenge in theoretical physics during the latter part of the 19th century

 Planck's law states that jahaan The displacement law of wyne shows how the black body radiation is related to the spectrum at any other temperature
 agar hamen ek taapmaana par varnakram ke aakaar kaa pataa he to ham kisi anya taapmaana par aakaar kii gananaa kar sakate hai
 One consequence of Wayne's displacement law is that a wavelength at which the radiation intensity produced by the black body is maximum, λ max { \ displaystyle \ lambda _ { \ mathrm {max}}}, is simply a function of temperature

 agar ham surya or prithvi ke liye maapit mulyon kaa sthanapann nikaalen: If we determine the average emission of Unity, we can calculate that the Earth's "effective temperature" would be: prithvi kaa yahi taapmaana hoga agar yah greenhouse prabhaav kii andekhi karte hue or ek aparivartaneey albido kii sthiti main yah avarakt sthiti main ek purna krishnika ke rup main vikirn hoti he
 In fact, the Earth is radiated into the infrared as a full black body, which will raise the predicted temperature by just a few degrees above the effective temperature
 If we want to estimate what the temperature of the Earth will be if there is no atmosphere, then we have to take into account the emission of albedo and the moon as a good way of estimation

 is imaarat pe jo pathar kaa kaam kiya gaya tha wo vastav main anston tha
 It is a sand colored magnesium limestone
 jisaki khan dakshini yorkshaire ke anston gaanv main he
 This stone, however, soon began to deteriorate due to pollution and other low quality stones being used
 However, all these malfunctions were rectified as early as 1849 and nothing was done after that in the 19th century
 1900 ke dauraan ek chiz to bilkul saaf ho gayi thi ki pattharon kii nakkashi kaa kuch kaam ab badalanaa padegaa

 yah pariyojna 1930 main shuru hui thi, lekin duusare vishwa yuddh ke kaaran iskaa kaam ruuk gaya or 1950 main hi yah kaam samaapt ho paaya
 By 1960, pollution began to take effect again
 In 1981, a scheme for conservation of towers and stones of external elevation began
 The plan ended in 1994
 Since then, House officials have initiated plans for the exterior repair of several inner porches
 yah kaary san 2011 main bhi jari he

 This Victoria Tower was rebuilt many times and its height increased very rapidly
 By the time it was completed in 1858, it had become the largest secular building in the world

 Used by the king to enter this palace and to open the parliament

 On the occasion of Flag Day and the day on which the assembly of any one House of Parliament was held, the Union flag is hoisted at the top

 Generally, it is also called bigben
 jo ki anishchit udgamon ko diya gaya naam he, yah naam samay ke saath saath tower ke liye istemaal hone laga

 It was imposed at the request of Queen Victoria in 1885 so that they could also see from Buckingham Palace whether all the members were at work
 iskaa namakaran pehle kamisionar of work ekatan smi yraton ke naam par kiya gaya tha
 The octagonal central tower, the smallest of the three pillars of the palace) is in the very center of the building
 yah madhya kii lobby ke thik upar he
 This was added to the insistence of Dr
 David Boswell

 According to his plan, a large chimney was built in the center of the palace
 jiske liye inkaa kahana tha ki pales ke chaaron taraf kii chaaron se jagah jal rahi aag se utpann pradushit or garm hawa is chimney ke madhyam se baahar nikal jaaegi
 tower kii jagah banane ke liye bairi par is baat kaa jor diya gaya ki usne lobby kii uchee chhaton kii jo yojana banaai hui thi
 Those roofs should be kept low
