 The rifle faced a lot of problems in the initial stages of production, the first models it encountered were the receivers of the stamped metal sheet, its guides and ejector trail were also difficult to weld, due to which it got bigger The scale had to be rejected but instead of stopping production, a heavy mechanical receiver was put in it
 It was a costly solution but after doing it the product The speed of the day was increased, then no new mechanical revavers were being installed, only the receivers of the earlier Mosin Nagat rifles were being used, due to this problem, these rifles could not be distributed in mass in the Soviet Army until 1956
 , And during this time only SKS Rifle was given to the army, Once the production problem was resolved, a new model was started to be given to the AKM army
this new model was equipped with a stamped sheet metal receiver
 It also had a hammer marker so that a limited number of rounds could be run while the automatic shot was fired, and the weapon would not suffer any damage, it is also called round redioser
 The new model was 1 / 3 less heavy than the old model
 This model is the most popular today and its production has been the highest till date, although generally this distinction is not known to Kisii
