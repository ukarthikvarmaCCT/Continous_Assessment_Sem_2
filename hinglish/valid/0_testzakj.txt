 Dutt was the third economic thinker along with D

 apane gahan anusandhan or vishleshan se dutt ne dikhaaya ki british shashan na keval bharat kii bhautik sthiti sudhaarney main vifal rahaa, balki uske kaal main bharat kaa vi-udyogikaran hua
 As a result of British economic policy, India's handicrafts production fell drastically and industrial production did not increase as a compensation
 na hi bhartiya udyogon ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sangrakshan pradaan kiya gaya
 As a result, the Indian economy was forced to depend on agriculture more than ever before
 bhartiya samaaj kaa dehathikaran hota chalaa gaya
 Dutt said that India did not benefit from the perceived constructive steps of British colonialism
 angrezon dwaara shuru kiye gayi rail- parivahan ke kaaran parmparik parivahan sevaayen maari gayin or trainon kaa istemaal british kaarakaanon main bane maal kii dhulaai ke liye hota rahaa

 bangeey sahitya parishad ke sansthaapak adhyaksh rahane ke saath-saath unhone mahabharat or ramayana kaa angrezi main sankshipt kavyanuwaad bhi kiya
 Based on the evidence of Sanskrit literature, Dutt also composed the history of ancient civilization of India
 british aarthik niti ke dushprinaamon par prakaash daalane ke alaava aarthik vichaaron ke vikaas main dutt kaa doosraa pramukh yogadan yah tha ki unhone arthvyavastha main sarkari hastkshep kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii vakaalat kii
 He recommended this in the early twentieth century at a time when other Indian economists were seeking to reduce the government's interference in economic life
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko nijee pahalakadami ghataane vaale hastkshepon se bachanaa chahie, lekin khaas paristhitiyon main dakhsandaazi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie taaki asthai kism ke sankaton se bachate hue hiton kaa takaraav taala ja sake
 Dutt's method of estimating the reality was also different in that era
 vaastaviktaa ke anek kaarnon main ek ko pramukh or dusron ko uskaa prabhaav maan kar chalane ke bajaay dutt ne aarthik or raajnneetik tathyon kii paraspar nirbharta kii avadharana viksit kii
 He believed that everything in the system of society is interdependent, interconnected, so nothing should be done like disturbing the balance
 lekin, saath main dutt yah bhi samajhate the ki santulan hameshaa ek jaisaa nahin rahata he
 He is constantly changing
 isliye sarkaar ko hastkshep karte samay kii fori sthiti kii antarnihit gatishiltaa par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, varanaa uske hastkshepkaaree kadamon kaa parinaam vipareet bhi nikal saktaa he
 The publication of Dutt's works on economics began in 1900
 unki pehali pustak thi bharat main padane vaale akalon kaa adhyayan karne vaali 'femins and land acesment in india' jisaki saraahna roosi araajaktaavaadi darshanik prince kropatakin ne bhi kii thi
 His work showed how interested he was in the living conditions of the Indian farmer and how his economic thinking was focused on improving his condition
 dutt ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1858 ke baad se chalis saal kii avadhi main bharat kii janata ko das bheeshan akalon kaa saamana kyon karnaa padaa? unhone poocha ki is dauraan hukumat east india company ke bajaay samraji ke haath main thi
 During this time there was usually peace and only one war took place
 hukumat ke paas prashikshit prashaasak the jinhen bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa paryaapt anubhav tha
 The land was fertile, farmers were entrepreneurs and economists
 aisi anukool paristhitiyon ke baavjood aisa kyon hua ki in akalon ke dauraan kareeb dedh karod log bhukh ke shikaar ho kar jaan se haath se dho baithe? dutt yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki akalon kaa kaaran aabaadi main tej rakrataar se hui badhotaree he yaa bharat ke kisaan laaparvaah, kahil or fizoolsearch hai
 He also did not accept that farmers being trapped under the clutches of usurers could be the cause of famine
 dutt ne apane adhyayan main dikhaaya ki bharat main aabaadi badhane kii raftaar england ke mukaable na keval hameshaa kam rahi, balki unke adhyayan se pehle ke das varshon main is desh kii aabaadi main badhotaree ruk hi gayi thi
 According to Dutt, more hardworking and less spending farmers than India are nowhere else in the world
 unhone akaal ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaale aayogon kii rapaton kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkari rajasav kii kathortapurvak vasuuli ke kaaran hi kisaanon ko mahajanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Showing a mirror to the British government, Dutt demonstrated that despite the famine, there was no year when all the crops had fallen
 sarkari godaamon main anaaj hameshaa bharaa rahaa
 If the crop in one province has deteriorated, the crop has been good in another province
 kheti kaa vistaar hua he, vah saghan bhi hui he, pehle ke mukaable paidaavaar bhi badi he, khetihar upaj kii keemten bhi badi hai, par iske baad bhi kisaanon kii haalat lagaataar karaab hoti gayi he
 Dutt blamed British policies for this
 1902 main dutt ke mahaan granth 'da iconomic history of british india' kaa pehla khand prakashit hua
 It is known as the best text written on British rule
 isamen 1757 main angrezon kii satta kii sthapana se lekar samraji kii hukumat lagu hone tak kaa aarthik itihaas pesh kiya gaya tha
 It had an analytical account of policies related to farming and land settlement, trade and factory production policies as well as finance and administration policies adopted under the East India Company
 pustak ke british samikshakon ne bhi isaki nishpakshta or gaharaai kaa loha mana
 In 1904, the second volume of this epic was published
 unhone pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki british shashan ke praarambhik varshon main apanaayi gayi swarthpurna nitiyaan bhartiya udyogon ke patan ke liye zimmedaar rahi hai
 Dutt, highlighting the causes of poverty in India, proved that the British industry had to destroy the indigenous industries and handicrafts
 lakhon log berojgaar ho gayi jisase jivan-yaapan ke liye unke saamne kheti ke alaava koi or chaara nahin rah gaya
 In this way, the number of people living on the basis of agriculture increased and the standard of living of all fell
 iske saath-saath angrez bharat par hukumat karne ke liye baari dhan karchate rahe jiskaa mulk ko koi faaydaa nahin pahunchaa
 The fiscal policy and the land revenue system were made in such a way that only the surviving resources remained with the farmer
 dutt ke paas in samasyaon kaa ilaaj karne kaa nuskhaa bhi tha
 He recommended that the excise duty should be removed from the Indian mill industry, farmers should be rid of all taxes other than the soft taxation of low rates, military and royal expenditure in England should not be recovered from India and also in India Expenses should be reduced dutt ne jaise hi ye suzav diye, british hukumat or uske himytiyon ne unki chautarfa aalochana shuru kar di
 An attempt was made to dismiss his facts and analysis
 dhyaan rahe ki dutt indian civil services ke varisht adhikari the or british shashan kii seva karne ke daayitv se bandhe hue the
 However, he continued to argue with his opponents and urged the government to change the policies to improve India's economic condition
 inaki vilakshan pratibha keval prashasnic kaaryon tak hi simit nahin thi, varan ye moulik lekhak tathaa itihasajna bhi the
 At the beginning of his writing, he wrote in English, but later also composed in Bengali with the influence of Bankim Chandra

 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 16 agast ko subah saadhe saat baje jab ve anshan par jane ke liye taiyaari kar rahe the, tab dilli police ne unhen ghar se hi giraftaar kar liya
 Other people on his team were also arrested
 is khabar ne aam janata ko udwelit kar diya or vah sadakon par utarkar sarkaar ke is kadam kaa ahimsaatmak pratirodh karne lagi
 Delhi Police presented Anna before the magistrate
 anna ne reeha kiye jane par dilli se baahar raalegaanv chale jane yaa 3 din tak anshan karne kii baat asweekaar kar di
 He was sent to Tihar Jail for 7 days judicial custody
 shaam tak deshvyapee pradarshnon kii khabar ne sarkaar ko apana kadam waapas khinchne par majaboor kar diya
 The Delhi Police issued an order to release Anna conditionally
 magar anna anshan jari rakhane par drudh the
 He refused to be released until unconditionally allowed to go on hunger strike
 17 agast tak desh main anna ke samarthan main pradarshan hota rahaa
 Thousands camped outside Tihar Jail in Delhi
 17 agast kii shaam tak dilli police ramlila maidan main 7 dinon tak anshan karne kii ijaajat dene ko taiyaar hui
 But Anna refused permission to fast for less than 30 days
 unhone jail main hi apana anshan jari rakhaa
 Anna got permission for 15 days at Ramlila Maidan and from August 19, Anna Ram was determined to continue his fast for Jan Lokpal Bill at Leela Maidan
 24 agast tak teen muddon par sarkaar se sahmati nahin ban paayi
 Even after 10 days of fasting, the government could not get Anna's fast to end
 Hazare publicly announced three conditions to end his fast from ten days
 unka kahana tha ki tamaam sarkari karmchaariyon ko lokapal ke daayre main laayaa jaae, tamaam sarkari karyaalayon main ek naagarik charter lagaaya jaae or sabhi rajyon main lokayukta ho
 The 74-year-old Hazare said that he will end his fast if Parliament discusses the Jan Lokpal Bill and agrees within the House on these three conditions
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne dono pakshon ke bich jari gatirodh ko todane kii disha main pehali thos pahal karte hue loksabhaa main khuli peshkash kii ki sansad aruna raay or dow jaiprakash narayan sahit anya logon dwaara pesh vidheyakon ke saath jan lokapal vidheyak par bhi vichaar karegi
 The details of the discussion will then be sent to the standing committee
 25 may 2012 ko anna hajaare ne punah jantar mantar par jan lokapal vidheyak or visal blor vidheyak ko lekar ek din kaa sankethik anshan kiya
 Gandhi's legacy is his position
 kad-lathi main vah saadhaaran hi hai
 There is a Gandhi cap on the head and Khadi on the body
 aankhon par motaa chashma he, lekin unako dur tak dikhataa he
 The intentions are Fauladi and Atal
 mahatma gandhi ke baad anna hajaare ne hi bhukh hadtaal or aamaran anshan ko sabase zyada baar bataur hathiyaar istemaal kiya he
 Through this, they have forced the corrupt administration to step down and the governments to enact public beneficial laws
 anna hajaare ko aadhunik yug kaa gandhi bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Anna Hazare is ideal for all of us
 anna hajaare gandhiji ke gram swarajya ko bharat ke gaanvon kii samruddhi kaa madhyam maanate hai
 They believe that 'villages must stand on their feet for a strong India'
 ' unke anusaar vikaas kaa laabh samaan rup se vitarit na ho paane kaa kaaran gaanvon ko kendra main na rakhana rahaa
 From the person building to village building and then naturally he showed Gandhi's mantra of country building into reality and his campaign started from one village to 85 villages successfully today

 Micro-finance means providing financial services to customers of low income groups, including consumers and self-employed individuals

 If seen broadly, it has been accepted for a long time that the development of a healthy national financial system is an important goal and catalyst towards achieving the macro goal of national economic development
 However, after the Second World War, efforts by national organizers and experts to develop financial services for the majority of the population of their countries have failed, for a brief description of the reasons, Edams, Graham and von Pischke in their best analysis 'undermining Rural Development with Cheap Credit'
 in kathinaaiyon kii vajah se, jab garib log udhaar lete hai, to ve aksar apane rishtedaaron athwa sthaneey sahuukaar par nirbhar hote hai, bhale hi unka byaaj dar bahut adhik hi kyon naa ho
 An analysis of 28 studies related to informal lending rates has proved that 76% of moneylenders' lending rates exceeded 10% per month, including 22% crossing 100% per month
 saamanyat: sahuukaar, kam garib logon ke mukaable zyaada garib udhaarkartaaon se adhik dar vasuulate hai
 Although moneylenders are seen as demons and are accused of being usurers, their services are convenient and fast and when borrowers are in trouble, they can behave in a very flexible manner

 From pragmatic visionaries such as the Franciscan ascetics who established community-oriented mortgage shops in the fifteenth century to those who led the European Credit Union movement in the nineteenth century and the founders of the micro-lending movement in the 1970s, everyone in the previous centuries, the poor people Various financial opportunities and risks in the form of financial services at the threshold of Management instruments tested were created to provide methods and Organizations

 Theoretically, the scope of micro-finance may include efforts to provide greater amounts of financial services to poor people at the moment or to benefit from the benefits that they receive, or to improve their quality
 
 Poor people, for example, borrow from informal moneylenders and save on informal collectors
 unako daniyon se rin or anudaan miltaa he

 In addition, by increasing the number of financial institutions available to them and their capacity, the problem of financial access can be resolved
 haal ke kuch varshon se, in sansthaaon kii vividhta ko vyapak banane par adhik bal diya ja rahaa he, kyonki alag-alag sansthaaen, alag-alag qism kii zaruuratein puri karti hai
 In 2004, an advisory team formed to help the poor formulated some principles that summarized the development process adopted over a century and a half, and was supported by a team of eight leaders of the G8 summit held on 10 June 2004: vyashti-vitt kaa daan se bhi bhed kiya ja saktaa he
 It would be better to give a grant to poor families or to the poor who cannot even raise the cash required to repay the loan
 yuddh kii dasha main athwa prakritik vipadaa ke baad, aise halaat paidaa ho sakate hai
 Several important debates have arisen around micro-finance
 vyashti-vitt ke vyavsaayee or dani, aksar yah daleel pesh karte hai ki laghu-rin, utpaadak prayojanon ke liye, jaise laghu-udhyam shuru karne athwa uske vistaar tak simit kiya janaa chahie
 In response to this, private sector advocates argue that it is impossible to ban due to the existence of money and that under no circumstances should the rich people decide how the poor should spend their money
 sambhavat: soodiori ke bare main paramparaagat pashchimi vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar, paaramparik sahuukaar kii bhoomika kii, khaas kar aadhunik vyashti-vitt ke praarambhik daur main, kadi aalochana kii gai
 As more and more poor people started getting loans from micro-lending institutions, it became clear that the services of moneylenders were proving valuable
 udhaarkarta, twarit rin sanvitaran, gopneeyata or lacheele chukauti kaarykram jaisi sevaaon ke liye behad zyaada byaaj dar dene ke liye taiyaar the
 They have never felt that getting a lower rate of interest as adequate compensation is greater than the cost of attending training courses or monthly collateral contributions in terms of attending meetings, qualifying for disbursement
 jab ve duusare kaarnon ke liye aksar udhaar liya karte the, tab unako aisa bahaanaa karne par majaboor karnaa bhi aruchikar laga ki ve kaarobaar shuru karne ke liye udhaar le rahe hai
 Because of the greater emphasis on the overall financial system in the recent past, moneylenders will gain more legitimacy to argue in favor of regulation and to strive to increase competition among poor people to increase the options available to them

 tathaapi, kai deshon ke sarkari adhikariyon kii vichaardhaara alag he or ve vyashti-vitt bazaaron main hastkshep karne se baaj nahin aate hai
 There has been a long debate about the acuity of the compromising synergy between 'outreach' and 'stability'

 This applies not only to individual institutions, but also to governments engaged in developing the national micro-finance system

 In the case of interdependent lending, the outstanding debt amounted to 0
9% after 30 days, while 0
3% debt write-offs were done
 Since the lower the loan volume, the lower the operating margin, many micro-finance institutions believe that lending to men is more risky
 lekin kabhi-kabhaar mahilaon kii taraf bhi yahi sawaal uthaa
 vishwa bank dwaara prakashit srilanka ke laghu udhyamiyon ke haal main kiye gaye adhyayan main paaya gaya ki purushon kii milkiyat ke kaarobaar ke maamle main puunji par pratifal ausatan 11% rahaa, jabaki mahilaon kii milkiyat ke kaarobaar ke maamle main puunji par pratifal 0% athwa thoda nakaaratmak rahaa

 As Margaret Robinson described in the micro-finance revolution, in the 1980s it was proven that "micro-finance can lead to large-scale outreach in a profitable way
 ” or 1990 ke dashak main “vyashti-vitt, ek udyog ke rup main viksit hone laga”
2000 ke dashak main, vyashti-vitt udyog kaa lakshya he, puri na kii gai maang ko kaafii bade paimaane par puraa karnaa or garibi ghataane main bhoomika nibhaana

 The constraints or challenges in building a strong commercial micro-finance industry are as follows: • daniyon kii anupyukt sahaayta raashi • Poor supervision of micro-finance institutions accepting regulation and deposits • gini-chuni vyashti-vitt sansthaaen, jo bachat, preshan athwa beemaa sambandhi zaruuratein puri karen • Limited management capacity of micro-finance institutions • sansthagat adakshataayen • The need for greater dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural oriented micro-finance practices

 Because all the value is accumulated before the need, this money management strategy is called 'saving up'
 aksar logon ke paas zarurat ke mauqon par paise nahin hote hai, isliye ve udhaar lete hai
 a poor family can borrow from their relatives to buy land, from a money lender to buy rice, or from a micro-finance institution to buy a sewing machine
 chunki kharch uthaane ke baad ye rin bachat main se chukaane padate hai isliye rudarford ise ‘neeche kii bachat’ kehete hai
 Rutherford believes that only half the problem has been averted with micro-loans, and this part is of little importance
 laghu-rin sansthaaon ko apane rin, bachat khaaton ke jariye dene chahie, taaki garib log apane asankhya jokhim sambhaal saken
 Most needs are met with a mix of savings and loans

 a parallel example of this can be seen in the West, in which funds for family business mostly come from savings and especially at the outset
 haal main kiye gaye adhyayanon se bhi yah jaahir hua he ki bachat ke anaupchaarik tareeqe behad asurakshit hote hai
 For example, Uganda's study of Wright and Mutesaria concluded that 'those who have no way but to save in the informal sector will have to lose some money - probably about a quarter of their savings
 " rudarford, rhite or dusron ke kaary kii badaulat vyavsaayiyon ko laghu-rin kii misaal ke ek ahm pahalu par punarvichaar karan padaa he: yah ki garib log, udhaar lekar, laghu udhyam sthapit kar or apni aay badha kar garibi se baahar nikalate hai
 In the new example, the efforts of the poorer people to reduce many of their weaknesses, while making up their wealth by saving a large part of their income, have received greater attention
 unako rinon kii zarurat to hoti he, lekin unako laghu udhyamon kii tarah upbhog ke liye udhaar lenaa bhi utana hi upyogi lag saktaa he
 To handle household and family risks, a safe, flexible placement to save and withdraw money when needed is equally essential
