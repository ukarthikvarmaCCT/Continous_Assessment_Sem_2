 It became clear that it is absolutely necessary to have a good amount of protein in the diet

 There is a particular shortage of good protein in Indian diets, because many people do not eat meat etc
 and are unable to consume milk and curd due to their expensive cost
 parantu kai prakaar ke achche proteinon kaa khaadya hona main hona aavashyak he
 If possible, they should be obtained from different substances like milk, egg and meat

 Fluidity of blood also remains due to water
 bhinn-bhinn sthanon main lavenon kii bhinn-bhinn maatra upasthit rahati he
 a slight deficiency or excess of this quantity does not cause any deformity in physical processes, but due to a particular deficiency, various types of disorders arise
 ye lavan bhi sharir ke liye bahut mahatv ke hai
 Due to the release of certain salts from the body, such as through sweating or thin stools, the muscles of the extremities begin to relax and cramp

 Humans started domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is thought to have been widespread since 3000 BCE
 cabelas upaprajati main ghode paaltu banaaen jate hai, yadhyapi kuch paaltu aabaadiyaan van main rahati hai nirankush ghodo ke rup main
 These autocratic populations are not real wild horses, as the term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Shevalaski horse, which is a separate subspecies and the only real wild one left
 There are horses

 The scheme has two phases
 pehla charan yah nirdhaarit karke parivartanon ko kam karnaa he kii in donon main se kis vidhi se sabase kam parivartan hota he
 In both methods, the first bit is always encoded itself
 ek vidhi main, aath biton main se prayek duusari ko kutabaddh karne se pehle exenoring dwaara unase pehle sthit bit ko kutabaddh kiya jaataa he
 In the second method, the bits located before them are encoded by Xoring before each of the eight bits is encoded
 duusare charan kii ore badhane se pehle chaynit vidhi kuta shabd kii naunvi bit main darshai jaati he
 If this bit is a zero, it means that the XNOR / XNOR method was used
 anyathaa, eksoar / XOR vidhi kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The second step is to maintain the DC balance
 aisa karne ke liye, kuta shabd kii naunvi bit jo pehle charan main bani thi, ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he
 If this was done then the tenth bit is set to 1
 anyathaa, dasvin bit ko shunya par set kiya jaataa he
 The clock rate, as indicated in version 1

 The receiver should retrieve the fastest bit clock directly from the data lines using clock / data recovery techniques
 DVI provides a reference clock while other sequential data interfaces such as PCI / PCI Express and SATA / SATA do not because the bits transmitted by the DVI interface may change depending on the range of frequencies changing depending on the video format being sent

 Historically, the Liberals have been ranked to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party
 The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 69 years in the 20th century—more than any other party in a developed country—and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's "natural governing party"
 The party's signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, restoring balanced budgets in the 1990s, and making same-sex marriage legal nationwide
 During the beginning of the 21st century, the party lost a significant amount of support, to the benefit of both the Conservatives and the NDP
 In the 2011 federal election, the Liberals had the worst showing in its history, capturing only 19 percent of the popular vote and 34 seats — becoming the third-place party in the House of Commons for the first time
 In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2000 election, winning 39
5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, thus regaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons

 ] The story told by the seventh effigy Kaumudi is as follows- One day King Vikramaditya was sleeping in his bedroom
 achaanak unki neend karun-krandan sunakar tut gai
 When he listened attentively, the sound of crying was coming from the river and a woman was crying
 vikram kii samaj main nahin aayaa ki koun-sa dukh unke rajya main kisi stri ko itani raat gaye bilakh-bilakh kar rone ko vivash kar rahaa he
 He immediately wore the royal capital and hung the sword in the waist and walked in the direction of the voice
 kshipraa ke tat par aakar unhen pataa chalaa ki vah awaz nadi ke duusare kinare par based jangal se aa rahi he
 He immediately jumped into the river and swam to the other shore
 phir chalate-chalate us jagah pahunche jahaan se rone kii awaz aa rahi thi
 He saw a woman sitting in the bushes crying
 unhone us stri se rone kaa kaaran poocha
 The woman said that she had narrated her grief to many people, but to no avail
 raja ne use vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve uski madad karne kaa har sambhav praytn karenge
 Then the woman told that she is the wife of a thief and on being caught, the city policeman has her hanged upside down on the tree
 raja ne poocha kya vah is faisle se khush nahin he
 To this, the woman said that she had no objection to the decision, but she could not see her husband hanging hungry and thirsty
 chunki nyaay main is baat kii charchaa nahin ki vah bhookha-pyaasa rahe, isliye vah use bhojan tathaa pani dena chaahati he
 Vikram asked why he had not done this till now
 is par aurat boli ki uskaa pati itani oonchaai par tangaa hua he ki vah bagaiyr kisi kii sahaayta ke us tak nahin pahunch sakati or raja ke dar se koi bhi dandit vyakti kii madad ko taiyaar nahin hota
 Vikram then said that she could walk with him
 darasal, vah aurat pishaachini thi or vah latakane vaala vyakti uskaa pati nahin tha
 She wanted to eat him by climbing on the king's shoulder
 jab vikram us ped ke paas aae to vah us vyakti ko chat kar gai
 Satisfied, he asked Vikram to ask for anything he wanted
 vikram ne kaha vah annapurna pradaan kare jisase unki praja kabhi bhukhi na rahe
 At this she told the vampire that giving Annapurna is not in her control, but her sister can provide
 vikram uske saath chalakar nadi kinare aae jahaan ek jhopadi thi
 When the Vampire called, her sister came out
 bahan ko usne raja kaa parichay diya or kaha ki vikramaditya annapurna ke sachche adhikari he, at: vah unhen annapurna pradaan kare
 His sister gladly gave Annapurna to him
 annapurna lekar vikram apane mahal kii ore ravaanaa hue
 It was already dawn by then
 raste main ek brahman mila
 He asked the king for alms
 vikram ne annapurna paatr se kaha ki brahman ko pet bhar bhojan karaae
 In fact, many types of dishes came in front of the Brahmin
 jab brahman ne pet bhar khaanaa kha liya to raja ne use dakshina dena chaha
 The Brahmin had seen the miracle of the Annapurna vessel with his own eyes, so he said- "if you want to give Dakshina, then give me this vessel as Dakshina, so that i don't have to spread my hands for food in front of anyone
" " vikram ne behichak usee kshan use vah paatr de diya
 The Brahmin left the king and went back to his palace

 In the latter part of his life he became very tyrannical
 san 1747 main uski hatya ke baad uskaa samrajya jald hi teetar-bitar ho gaya
 Nadir was born into an ordinary family in the Afshar Qalbus clan in Khorasan
 uske pita ek saadhaaran kisaan the jinaki mrityu nadir ke balykaal main hi ho gai thi
 It is said of Nadir that his mother was enslaved by the Uzbeks with him

 Impressed by his service, he received the title of Thamasya Quli Khan
 yah ek sammaan tha kyonki isse use shahi naam mila tha
 But Nadir was not a commander to be so satisfied
 nadir ne iske baad heraat ke abdali afagaanon ko parrast kiya
 After consolidating his position in the court of Tehmashp, he planned to attack the Afghans who had captured the capital Isfahan in 1729
 is samay ek unani vyapaaree or paryatak besile vatatzes ne nadir ke sainya abhyaason ko aankhon se dekha tha
 He made a note - Nadir bowed his head in acceptance of his generals' greetings after entering the practice area
 uske baad wo apana ghoda roktaa tha or kuch der tak sena kaa nirikshan ekadam chup rahakar karata tha
 He allowed the practice to begin
 iske baad abhyaas aarambh hota tha - chakra, vyuh rachana or ghudsawaari ityadi

 By the end of 1729, he defeated the Afghans three times and took Isfahan back under his control
 usne afagaanon ko mahafooj tareeke se bhaagane de diya
 He then planned a massive military campaign
 jiske liye usne shah tahmaashp ko kar vasuulne par majaboor kiya
 Usmani Turks dominated from the west

 He drove the Osmanis from the west and soon after that he moved east towards Herat where he took control of Herat

 Nadir was agitated when he returned from Herat
 usne janata se apana samarthan maanga
 At the same time, one day in Isfahan, he explained to Tehmashp in a state of intoxication that he was unfit for governance and at his behest, the courtiers installed the young son of Tahamashp, Abbas
 uske rajbhishek ke samay nadir ne ghoshnaa kii ki wo kandahaar, dilli, bukhaara or istambul ke shaskaon ko haraayega
 The people present in the court felt that this was nothing but extreme self-sufficiency

 He prepared an army to attack the Osman in the direction of the west
 par apane pehle akraman main use paraajay mili
 Usman sent a heavy army to protect Baghdad, which Nadir could not answer
 lekin kuch maheenon ke bheetar usne sena phir se sangathit kii
 This time he defeated the Osmanis near Kirkuk

 Shia Islam and the atrocities perpetrated by the Sunnis are of great importance in Iran's religious history
 safavi shiya the or unke tahat shiya logon ko arabon ke julm se chhutkaaraa mila tha
 Today the people of Iran are Shia and there is a tradition of abusing the first three Caliphs
 nadir shah ne apni gaddi samhaalane vakt ye shart rakhi ki log un khalifaaon ke prati yah anadar bhav chhod denge
 It also benefited him
 iran main shiya sunni tanaav to kam hua hi saath hi iran ko islam ke duusare kendra ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Nadir also had a moderate religious relationship with the Armenians
 uskaa shashan yahudiyon ko liye bhi ek sukun kaa samay tha
 Within his empire, he made no attempt to inflict Sunni religion on the people, but outside the empire he became known as the Shah of the Sunni converted kingdom

 On reaching Delhi in March 1739, it was rumored that Nadir Shah was killed
 isse dilli main bhagdad much gai or farsi sena kaa katl shuru ho gaya
 To avenge this, he committed terrible bloodshed in Delhi and killed some 20,000 - 22,000 people in a single day

 It is said that on his return from Delhi he had so much money that he did not tax the public for the next three years
 dilli se lautne par use pataa chalaa ki uske bete raza quli, jise ki usne apni anupasthiti main waisarai bana diya tha, ne saafavi shah tahamashp or abbaas kii hatya kar di he
 This gave him a clue that Raza is also plotting against him
 isi dar se usne raza ko vysarai se padchyut kar diya
 He then went on an expedition to Turkestan and then went on to suppress the rebellion of Dagestan
 par yahan par use safalataa nahin mili
 The Lezgo adopted the Khandak war policy and attacked Rashad's caravan and disturbed Nadir
 jab wo dagestan main tha to nadir ko khabar mili ki raza usko maarane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 This angered him and he blinded Raza
 raza ne kaha ki wo nirdosh he par nadir ne uski ek na suni
 But a few days later Nadir regrets his mistake
 is samay nadir biimaar ho chalaa tha or apane bete ko andhaa karne ke kaaran bahut kshubdh
 Nadir Shah ordered that the heads of the warlords be blown to see the blows of his son Raza Quli
 nadir shah ne un saradaaron kii galati yah tehrai ki unamem se kisi ne yah kyon nahin kaha ki raza quli ke bajaaye uski ankhen phod di jaayen
 Dagestan's failure was also eating him
 dhire-dhire vah or atyaachaari banataa gaya
 After he returned empty-handed from Dagestan, he regrouped his army for a much older goal - the Osmanian Empire of the West
 us samay jab sena sangathit hui to uski ginati thi - 3,75,000 sainik
 Hardly any army had such an empire at that time
 iran kii khud kii sena itani badi 1980 - 1988 ke iran - iraq yuddh se pehle fir kabhi nahin hui

 Nadir understood that Usmani could not come under his control
 idhar nae osmani sainik uske khilaaf bheje gaye
 Nadir Shah's son Nasirullah defeated one of these, while Nadir defeated another in 1745 near Yerevan
 par yah uski aakiri badi jeet thi
 In this, the Usman gave him the right to rule at close quarters
 nadir kaa ant uski bimariyon se ghira rahaa
 He had become ill, persecuted and staunch for the day

 His military expenditure had increased considerably

 On 19 June 1747, he was killed by his own bodyguards near Mashhad
 nadir shah kii uplabdhiyaan adhik dinon tak tik nahin sakin

 usne apana naam adil shah rakh liya
 After Nadir died, the army dispersed and the empire began to rule independently by satraps

 Nadir had gained a reputation as a winner in Europe

 After his conquest of India in 1739, the British came to know about the weakness of the Mughals and tried to force the expansion of empire in India as an opportunity
 agar nadir shah bharat par akraman nahin karata to british shaayad is tarah se bharat main adhikaar karne ke bare main shaayad soch bhi nahin pate yaa itane bade paimaane par bhartiya shashan ko chunauti nahin dete

 divangat peshwa ke uttaradhikaar kaa prashn uthaa
 The company's government ordered the Bithur-based commissioner to inform Nanarao that the government considered him to be the heir of the Peshwa Dhan wealth and not the title of Peshwa or the political and personal facilities attached to it
 etdarth peshwa kii gaddi praapt karne ke sambandh main va koi samaaroh yaa pradarshan na karen
 But the ambitious Nanarao took all the property in his hand and took possession of the Peshwa's armory
 thode hi dinon main nanarav ne peshwa kii sabhi oopaadhiyon ko dhaaran kar liya
 Immediately he gave the application to the British Government and demanded a justification for the introduction of the Peshwai pension
 saath hi unhone apane vakil ke saath kharita aadi bhi bheja jo kanpur ke colector ne waapas kar diya tathaa unhen suchit karaayaa ki sarkaar unki peshwai oopaadhiyon ko sweekaar nahin karti
 Nanarao Dhupandant suffered a lot because he had to take care of many dependents
 naanaa sahab ne pension paane ke liye lard dalhousie se likhapadhi kii, kintu jab usne bhi inkaar kar diya to unhone ajimullah khan ko apana vakil niyukt kar maharani victoria ke paas bheja
 Azimulla made many efforts but failed
 lautate samay unhone france, italy tathaa rus aadi kii yatra kii
 After coming back, Azimullah made Nana Saheb aware of his failure, the real situation of the British and the freedom movements of Europe
 nanarav dhoondhupant ko angrej sarkaar ke rukh se bada ksht hua
 They were not silent
 unhone isi samay tirthayatra prarambh kii
 Nana Saheb's departure on a pilgrimage in this age seems somewhat mysterious
 san 1857 main vah kalpi, dilli tathaa lakhanu gaye
 In Kalpi, you met the famous Kunwar Singh of Bihar and imagined a future revolution
 jab meerut main kranti kaa shriganesh hua to naanaa sahab ne badi veerta or dakshata se kranti kii senaaon kaa kabhi gupt rup se or kabhi prakat rup se netritv kiya
 As soon as the revolution started, his followers received eight and a half lakh rupees and some war material from the English treasury
 kanpur ke angrej ek garh main kaid ho gaye or krantikariyon ne vahaan par bhartiya dhwaja fahraai
 All the revolutionaries gathered in Kanpur to go to Delhi
 naanaa sahab ne unka netritv kiya or dilli jane se unhen roak liya kyonki vahaan jaakar ve or khatra hi mol lete
 Nana Saheb declared war from Kalyanpur
 apane sainikon kaa unhone kai tukadiyon main baanta
 When all the British were going on boats from Satichora Ghat in Kanpur, the revolutionaries opened fire on them and many of them were killed
 angrej itihaaskaar iske liye naanaa ke hi doshi maanate hai parantu uske paksh main yathesht pramaan nahin miltaa
 
 1 july 1857 ko jab kanpur se angrejon ne prasthaan kiya to naanaa sahab ne purn swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kii tathaa peshwa kii oopaadhi bhi dhaaran kii
 Nana Saheb's indomitable courage never waned and he led the revolutionary armies equally
 fatehpur tathaa ang aadi ke sthanon main naanaa ke dal se or angrejon main bheeshan yuddh hue
 Sometimes the revolutionaries won and sometimes the British won
 tathaapi angrej badhate aa rahe the
 After this, Nana Saheb saw the rise of British forces and crossed the river Ganges and departed to Lucknow
 naanaa sahab ek baar phir kanpur laute or vahaan aakar unhone angreji sena ne kanpur va lakhanu ke bich ke maarg ko apane adhikaar main kar liya to naanaa sahab avadh chhodkar ruhelkhand kii ore chale gaye
 On reaching Ruhelkhand, he supported Khan Bahadur Khan
 ab tak angrejon ne yah samaj liya tha ki jab tak naanaa sahab pakade nahin jate, viplav nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 When the revolutionaries were defeated in Bareilly, then Nana Saheb suffered a lot like Maharana Pratap but he did not surrender before the Firangi and his friends
 angrej sarkaar ne naanaa sahab ko pakadvane ke nimitt bade bade inaam ghoshit kiye kintu ve nishphal rahe
 Truly Nana Saheb's renunciation and independence, his valor and military ability place him on the seat of a prominent figure in Indian history
