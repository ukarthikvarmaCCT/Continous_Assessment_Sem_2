 After considering the auspicious Nakshatra, Yoga and Karana, when the walls are formed, in the Rohini or Shravan Nakshatra, after the sunrise in the morning, the pillars should be set up by the hands of such great masters who had been fasting for the last three days till night
 rang ke anusaar stambh chaar varnon ke hote hai - brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra stambh
 Out of these, Kheer should be donated by worshiping and decorating white objects of the first Brahmin pillar, purified with ghee and mustard, red gudodan given to the Dwijs by worshiping and decorating with red garlands and red objects on the Kshatriya pillar
 pashchimottar disha main vaisya stambh kii sthapana karke pili vastuon se puja or sajaavat karke dwijon ko pilaa ghi or chaaval diya jaae, tathaa purvottar disha main shudra stambh kii sthapana karke neeli vastuon se puja tathaa sajaavat karke dwijon ko matar or chaaval kii masaaledaar khichdi di jaae
 First of all, put white garland and white sandalwood on the Brahmin pillar and put gold equivalent to Karnaful in its root
 isi prakaar laal maala se sajaakar kshetriy stambh kii jad main sone ke saath tanba, vaisya stambh kii jad main sone ke saath chaandi or shudra stambh kii jad main sone ke saath loha daalana chahie
 When this is done, you should bring pillars wrapped in leaf garlands with Swastivachan, Punyahavachan and Jaighosha, and the Brahmins should be satisfied with gems, cows and clothes, etc
, so that each pillar should be erect and unmoving
 , Do not stagger nor be crooked, because the stagger causes drought in the country, fear of death by being crooked
 or laplpaane se shatru ke akraman kaa bhay rahata he
 While setting up a Brahmin pillar, one should donate Dakshina and Gau along with the mantra in purity, provide food to the relatives of the creator, feed the priest and king with honey and emulsion and offer salty khichdi to all the artisans
 iske pashchaat ullas ke saath stambh ko abhimantrit karte hue kaha jaae "jis prakaar baari meru parvat tathaa vishaal himalay achal he or jaise raja kii jai achal hoti he vaise hi tum bhi achal bane raho"
 Similarly, pillars, gates, walls and naphthagriha should also be built by the classical method

 Pillars, pegs, windows and corners should not be made in front of the door or obstructing the door
 bhit par plasters karke us par chuunaa pot diya jaae or stri, purush, lata aadi ke chitra bana die jaaen
 The shape of the cave of the mountain and the two bhumitalwala should be made in which there are small windows, there is no wind, and the words do not resonate, ie there is a vacuum dramatum in which the tone of the choir will remain serious

 After measuring equal land from all four sides, divide the chunk with its chunk and then make a wall by making concrete bricks all around
 phir bheetar kii or rangapith ke upar mandap ke liye 10 khambhe khadey kiye jaaen
 Outside these pillars, for the seating of the observers, the steps should be made with brick and wood, which are raised one by one from the next posture, so that the color can be seen well
 stambhon ke vidhaan ke anusaar nirdisht dishaao main chah drudh khambhe khadey kar die jaaen jinpar aath haath lanbaa chaudaa peeth banaaya jaae
 Proper pillars should be erected for the base of the pavilion

 In relation to the Brahmin and Kshatriya pillars, Bharata did not explain where to erect them
 bharat ne likhaa he ki ek dwaar nepathygrih or rangashirsh ke bich main ho jisamen se hokar rangapith par abhinaytaon kaa pravesh ho or doosraa dwaar prekshagrih main janata ke pravesh ke liye rangamanch ke saamne kii ore ho
 According to the eight-handed color chart and the previously stated size, a Mathwari adorned with a square plane altar should be made with a four-pillared flat bar
 tryastr natyagrih tikona bananaa chahie or isi trikon ke bich ke kone main rangapith bananaa chahie
 From that angle one gate should be made to enter on the bench and the other from the back of the bench
 bharat ne prekshagrih ke nirmaan kii yah sab vyavastha itani adhuri di he ki iske aadhaar par bharat ke vichaare hue prekshagrih kaa puraa nirmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa, kintu itnaa spasht ho jaataa he ki unke prekshagrih kaa aadha bhaag rangamanch tathaa nepathygrih ke liye hota tha or aadha darshakon ke liye
 Some scholars have mistaken to consider the ancient color of the Vihara Shilavasam of Sitavanga and Jogimara caves in the hill of Sarguja region located in Vindhyamekhala, but they should remember that Bharata has described the land, measurements, prescriptions, darukrams, pillars and gates etc
 Legislation has been given that it is not possible in this type of inscription
 ye vastav main usee prakaar ke shilaveshm hai jinka ullekh meghdoot kumarasambhav ke darigrih main kiya gaya he or jiskaa ullekh saundaranand main bhi miltaa he
 Between the naphthagriha and the colony at the aforesaid Indian theater, there was a javanika or veil, which the characters used to remove
 kabhi-kabhi vimaan yaa chaowkee par baithe hue raja bhi pravesh karte the 
 At that time, acting was symbolic, so "rathavatharanam Natayati" or "ghatsechananam Natayati" is given in plays from place to place
 us samay na rath hota tha na ghat, varan uskaa natya maatr hota tha jaisaa ab bhi chini naatakon tathaa europe ke pratikatmak naatakon main hota he
 a detailed account of this type of performance is given in the Chitrabhinayaka episode of Natya Shastra of Bharata
 bharat ne rangamanch par kakshya kaa bhi nirdesh kiya he
 These orbits were three - the outer room adjoining the room, 2 - the middle room adjoining the napalm
 ye kakshyaayein rangamanch ke donon ore pashrv kii ore se aane or janevaale abhinaytaon ke liye kaam main aati thim
 How far the space of these rooms was determined by the rotation of the characters
 dur kaa sthaan nirdesh karne ke liye der tak parikrama karnaa padataa tha or sameep ke sthaan ke liye thodaa parikraman
 Bharata has told that the main character always lived in the meditative room and the secondary character used to come from the middle room and sit in the middle of the head
 apni baat kahanevaala paatr uttar ke dwaar se pravesh karke dakshin kii ore munh karke sandesh kahata tha or jis dwaar se aata tha usee dwaar se laut jaataa tha
 If he used to come back again, he would have come through the same gate through which he had gone

 It is clear from the elaborate legislation of the Indian theater that at that time only highly educated, skilled nuts could come to the theater, not others
 maharaj harsh ke pashchaat bhartiya rangamanch praaia: samaapt ho gaya
 First, in the 16th century, Goswami Tulsidas ji established an Indian theater in the form of Ramlila by cremating Indian rural theater performances which had four characteristics: lila khule maidan main hoti thi, For each theatrical space there were different locations; Like Ayodhya's Leela in one place, Lanka's Leela in another place, Dhanushyajna in third place
 aaj bhi ramnagar main usee paddati par ramlila hoti hai
 The forms of Rama, Lakshmana etc
 are duly worshiped and worshiped, and Hanuman, Sugriva etc
 also assume their roles by worshiping their masks
 ye leelaayen nishchit tithiyon ko hi hoti hai or unka aadhaar naatak na hokar mahakavy he
 In this category began the "yatras" of Ramlila and Bengal which are usually held on an open platform, but sometimes in temples or closed places

 In Bombay, the famous Indian actor Prithviraj in his Prithvi Theaters used a triangular theater which also used two-dimensional curtains
 san 1938 main mahaamanaa pan madanamohan malviya ji kii prerana se kaashi main abhinav rangashaala kii sthapana hui or uskaa petica rangamanch banaaya gaya jisamen rangapith ke teen ore or upar nile rang ke tipalli lakdi ke parden lage hue the
 There were two gates to the right and left and three wooden gates with a wooden curtain standing at some height in the back and the remaining top part was open
 jisapar aavashyaktaanusaar do khand kaa grih bhi banaaya ja saktaa tha
 Its curtains were wrapped with circular wheels above on round posts
 iske pashchaat akhil bhartiya vikram parishad ne san 1947 main prithvi theatre ke sahyog se bombai ke apera house main rupabaddh drishypeeth manch par "mahakavi kalidas" naatak khelaa jisamen bhawan aadi ke drishy un un aakaaron main kate hue, drishypithon ke dwaara banaae gaye the
 The third experiment was also conducted in Bombay in 1948, where a triangular open-view multilayered visual theater for the play "deity" was built on the grounds of Marin Drive, in which the entire scene of Bombay behind two buildings, street and garden in one scene was Marine Lines
 The station, the running electric trains, the grand palace of the city naturally remained the backdrop
 san 1949 main ek drishyaatmak rangapith par jo naatak khelaa gaya usamen triparimaniya drishy kii bhi anshat: yojana thi jaise "mira bai" or "jai somnath" main
 In 1955, the Central Central Theater was used at Bombay's Vallabhbhai Stadium for the play "jai Somnath" in which a five-foot-high and 80-foot-tall theater was built 100 feet in front of thirty thousand spectators sitting on the stairs of the stadium
 20 feet back 5 ft tall Somanatha's Tri-dimensional temple was built and Jai with the help of two thousand light lights and sounding instruments
 The play "somnath" was played
 19,20,21 disambar san 1926 ko lakhanu main akaash rekh samprukt rangamanch par "vikramaditya" naatak khelaa gaya jisamen aage kaa pardaa avashya tha kintu daayen baayein na pakhwaiyaan thim or na parden, varan drishy ke anusaar drishypeeth maatr the jinke mail se saikadon prakaar ke drishy banaae ja sakate hai or jo batti badhaakar lagaae or hataae ja sakate hai
 These theaters are of three types - 1
 Flat or bimanual benches, densely walled and stationary benches which are played in front of a paved building
 isi teesri "shrenee" main akasharekha swaabhaavik sthir manch bhi aata he jiskaa prayog san 1948 main baliya main "paras" naatak ke liye kiya gaya tha jiske drishy ko purnat: gramin banane ke liye ghar kii sthir prishthbhumi ke saath munj or sarapat kii jhopadi tathaa baade se yukt vaastavik vriksh, charani tathaa kuen kaa drishypeeth prastut kiya tha
 According to Bharata in the ancient Indian theater, there was a law to use the book, which according to many forms and evidences, there were three types - Sandhim, Vyjim and Veshtiya
 bhojaptr, baans aadi ke pattey tathaa charm se jo saamagree banaai jaati thi use sanghim, yantra ke dwaara sanchalit kii ja sakanevaali ko vyajim or lapetakar banaai janevaali kaa veshtim kehete hai
 These three types of books used to make beds, vehicles, planes, skin, worms, flag and mountains etc
 because according to them, the use of iron or material was prohibited due to heavy and painful use
 isliye lakdi, chamada, vastra, lakh, baans or patton se hi drishypeeth banaakar rangeen kapadon se yathaswaroop sajaa lenaa chahie
 Palm or Bhojpatra should be used in the absence of clothes
 inhen sab vastuon se astr-shastr tathaa sharir ke ang banaae ja sakate hai
 Mountains, paths, flowers, jewels and many different crowns were made from buffalo, garments, wax, lac, mango leaves, teesi, flax and mooncakes, because crowns and jewelery made of gold etc
 were a deterrent in war, dance and acting and Could have been fatal
 at:, taanbe yaa abarak ke pattaron or mom se hi aavaran bana liye jate the kyonki bharat ke anusaar rangamanch par shastron aadi se prahaar na karke keval unka bhav maatr dikhaa dena chahie
 Bharat has also told which weapon and how much finger should be made
 jarjar ke sambandh main bhi vidhaan diya gaya he ki uskaa aakaar prakaar kaisaa ho, kitni ganthavaala ho, kis nakshatra main laayaa jaae or kaise banaaya jaae
 Now-a-days, paper boards, canvases and plywood etc
 are cut as follows
 aaabharan aadi bhi isi prakaar banaae jate hai, yadhyapi kabhi-kabhi vaastavik abharanon kaa bhi prayog kar liya jaataa he
 Weapons are used as real as possible, but this use is undesirable and fatal
 bharat ke anusaar rangamanch par anek deep rakhe rahete the jinhen naatak prarambh hone par koi vyakti jalataa hua deepak lekar prajvalit kar detaa tha
 In the theater that went on in English in the English way, first the use of gas lights, then lime lights and then electric lights were used
 ab bhartiya rangamanchon par chakamak deep ke atirikt anek prakaar ke bijli ke prakashadipon ke dwaara mandak ke sahare kam yaa adhik prakaash dekar vibhinn rangon ke prakaash kaa bhi prayog kiya jane laga he or rangadipan kala swat: ek kala ho gai he
 Here some new experiments are also being done in connection with the theater, such as - in 1957, the Vrithrang Manch was used in Delhi, in the middle of which was the Gol Theater and the audience was sitting around it
 kalakatta kii "anamika" natya sanstha ne bhi isi prakaar ke akshavat rangamanch par apana "chhapate chhapate" naatak kiya tha
 Its stage feature is that the characters come in front of the audience to place and remove scenes and the lights are raised and the scene is changed
 europe main "masco arte theatre" yaa america ke "radio mujeec haal" main tathaa europe or america main jo anek prakaar ke rangamanch sambandhi prayog ho rahe hai us kshamta or vistaar ke saath hamaare desh main prayog nahin hue
 There are now open theaters from place to place on behalf of the Government of India and the Territorial Governments, behind which round-the-clock and step-up meetings are held for the audience
 dharti se lagbhag dedh foot unche rangapith par drishy ke anusaar kursi aadi laga lee jaati he kintu peeche kii prishthpithika kaa prayog nahin hota
 Acting on this type of open theater has increased more importance, less of the scene
 drishyasajja ke sambandh main bhi nirmanvadi, bhavvaadi, ativastuvaadi tathaa pratikwaadi aadi jo anek prakaar ke prayog ho rahe hai unamem se kisi kaa bhi anugaman bharat main nahin hua
 On the other hand, Ramlila etc
 which used to be in the form of an open theater, have started to be played in dramas in many places

 Long-term measures include investment in modern agricultural techniques such as fertilizer and irrigation, which have largely eradicated starvation in the developed world

 Definitions of famine are based on three different categories - on the basis of food supply, on the basis of food consumption and on the basis of mortality
 Some definitions of famine are: kisi aabaadi main khaadya padaarthon kii kami yaa to bhojan kii kami yaa phir bhojan ke vitaran main kathinaaiyon ke kaaran hota he; yah sthiti prakritik jalwaayu ke utaar-chadhaavon or damankaaree sarkaar yaa yuddh se sambandhit charam raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran or bhi badtar ho sakati he
 Ireland's horrific famine was proportionally one of the largest historical famines
 isaki shuruyaat 1845 main aalu kii beemaari kii vajah se hui thi or yah isliye bhi hua kyonki khaadya padaarthon ko ireland se england bheja ja rahaa tha
 Only the British were able to pay the higher prices

 The traditional explanation for the cause of famine until 1981 was as a hypothesis of decreased availability of food
 dharna yah thi ki sabhi akalon kii kendriya vajah khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami thi
 However the FAD could not explain why only a particular segment of the population such as agricultural laborers were affected by famine while others were untouched by famine
 haal hi ke kuch akalon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par ebedy kii nirnaayak bhoomika par sawaal uthaaya gaya he or yah suzav diya gaya he ki jald se jald bhukhmaree kii sthiti laane kaa kaaran banane vaali pranaaliyon main sirf khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami ke alaava bhi kai anya kaarak shaamil hai
 According to this view, famine is a consequence of rights, this proposed principle is called "failure of exchange rights" or FEE
 kisi vyakti ke paas vibhinn prakaar kii vasteen ho sakati hai jinaki adla-badali ek bazaar vyavastha main uski jarurat kii anya chizon ke badalen main kii ja sakati he
 Exchange can be done through trade or production or a combination of both
 in adhikaron ko vyapaar-aadhaarit yaa utpaadan-aadhaarit adhikaar kaha jaataa he
 According to this proposed approach, the state of famine comes due to the loss of ability of the person to exchange his rights
 epaii ke kaaran hone vaale akalon kaa ek udhaaharan kisi khetihar majdoor dwaara apane pramukh adhikaron kaa aadan-pradaan karne kii aakshamata he, jaise ki chaaval kaa majdoor jab uske rojgaar kii sthiti dawandol yaa puri tarah se samaapt ho jaati he
 Some elements make a particular area highly susceptible to famine
 inamen shaamil hai: In some cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China, in North Korea in the mid-1990s or in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, famine conditions may arise as an unintended consequence of government policies

 Historically, famine has been caused by agricultural problems such as drought, crop failure or epidemic
 mausam ke badalte mizaaj, sankat, yuddh or mahamari janit bimariyon jaise ki kaali maut se nibatane main madhya yugin sarkaron kii aprabhavashiltaa madhya yugon ke dauraan europe main saikadon akalon ko janm dene main sahaayak siddh hui jinamein britain main 95 or france main 75 akaal shaamil hai
 a hundred years of war, crop failures and epidemics in France had reduced its population by two-thirds

 Famine is often associated with subsistence agriculture
 ek aarthik rup se majboot kshetra main krishi kaa kul abhaav akaal kaa kaaran nahin banataa he; erizona or anya samrudh kshetra apane khaadya padaarth ke bahut adhik hisse kaa aayaat karte hai, kyonki is tarah ke kshetra vyapaar ke liye paryaapt aarthik samagriyon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The famine situation has also arisen due to volcanic event

 By late 2007, along with the increase in farming for use in biofuels, world oil prices reached nearly $ 100 per barrel, raising prices of food grains fed to chickens and dairy cows and other livestock
 Due to the increase, the prices of wheat, soyabean and maize have seen significant increase throughout the year

 These agricultural technologies had temporarily increased crop yields, but by at least 1995, there were indications that they could lead to a shortage of arable land
 Developed countries have partnered these technologies with developing countries with a famine problem, but relatively less developed countries have ethical limitations to promote these technologies

 Water levels are declining in many countries due to widespread overuse of powerful diesel and electric pumps
 pakistan, iran or mexico anya prabhavit deshon main shaamil hai
 This will eventually cause water shortages and grain crops to be cut
 Even with excessive pumping of its aquifers, China has developed a grain deficit that contributes to increasing pressure on grain prices

 Instead, Maddy is a complete crook, who is not serious about studying in her college and is notorious in college
 vah apane college main ladakiyon ko pareshaan karata he
 Opposite her arch rival is Sam, the perfect student with whom Maddy is constantly confronted
 sam snaatak kar college chhod detaa he, lekin madi se vaada karata he ki ek din, jo shuru hua tha wo puraa hoga 
 Two years later, Maddy took a job as a software instructor at a private company
 uske ravaiye main kuch dhilaai hui he, lekin wo badla nahin he
 On a trip to Delhi, he sees a girl in heavy rain, dancing with some children
 use keval garjan main uski ek jhalak milti he or uski sundarataa se wo maaraa jaataa he
 Later, he and his college mates attend another classmate's wedding, where, by luck, Maddy then sees him and learns that his name is Reena
 madi uske ore gaharaai se aakarshith he or uske bare main or jaanane kii koshish karata he
 However, fate reunites them when he sees her in Mumbai
 jald hi vah jaan jaataa he ki rina kii shaadi uske bachapan ke dost or enarai rajeev shyamrao ke saath pakki kii gai he
 Maddy also comes to know that Reena does not know what Rajiv looks like and Rajiv is coming to meet her next week
 madi, ab rina ke saath pyaar main he or apane pyaar ko khone ke vichaar se niraash he
 Maddy decides to pretend to be Rajiv when encouraged by her friends and especially her father
 samay sahi hone par wo use apni asli pahchaan batayega
 Maddy shows her love to Reena and they spend a good time together over those five days
 rina ko pehle wo keval ek dost ke rup main pasand aayaa tha, lekin ab wo bhi uske saath pyaar main padati he
 Everything goes well and Madina decides to reveal her identity when Reena confesses her love to him
 durbhagyavash isse pehle, asli rajeev waapas aata he or rina madi kaa raaj khulne se chaunk jaati he
 Reena decides to end her relationship with Maddy
 madi rina ko apane asli iraadon ke bare main bataane or manaane kii koshish karata he lekin vah usase baat karne se inkaar kar detii he
 Frustrated, Maddy decides to back the real Rajiv from the wedding
 madi yah dekhakar chaunk gaya ki rajeev uske college kaa pratidwandvi sam he
 Sam is even more upset to learn that his pretender is actually his old rival from college that he hated
 rajeev kaa maananaa he ki madi apni pratidwandvita ke kaaran is sab main shaamil ho gaya he
 Rajiv and Reena's wedding dates were fixed
 yahan, madi avsaad main jaataa he or pine lagata he
 Reena is no better without him, because it is becoming very difficult for her to forget him
 haalanki sam or madi ke bich shatruta kaa naveekaran ho gaya he, lekin sam dhyaan detaa he ki rina usase shaadi isaliye kar rahi he kyonki vah madi se bahut naaraaz he
 Eventually, Rajiv asks Reena if she loves him or Maddy
 is bich, madi san francisco, california jane ke liye apane vartmaan niyokta ke prastaav ko sweekaar karne kaa faisla karata he, jise usne shuruyaat main asweekaar kar diya tha
 When Rajiv realizes that Reena is still in love with Maddy, he takes her to the airport
 madi sochataa he ki rajeev ek baar phir use dandit karne aayaa he
 Rajiv hands over Reena to Maddy, at which the two confess their feelings for each other
 rajeev dil se dukhi unhen akelaa chhod detaa he
 Reena and Maddy reunite once more

 Thus the number of letters in the present mixed Sinhala is fifty four
 attharah akshar "swar" tathaa shesh chhattis akshar vyanjan maane jate hai
 When two letters are congruent, this process is called "pact"
 shuddh sinhal main sandhiyon ke keval das prakaar maane gaye hai
 But in modern Sinhala, the treaty or treaty of Sanskrit words is done according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar
 "ekakshar" athwa "anekaksharon" ke samooh padon ko bhi sanskrit kii hi tarah chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - namay, aakhyaat, upsarg tathaa nipaat
 Like Hindi in Sinhala, there are two words - "singular" and "plural"
 sanskrit kii tarah ek atirikt "dwivachan" nahin hota
 The distinction of this "singular" and "plural" is called number distinction
 jis prakaar "vachan" ko lekar "hindi" or "sinhal" kaa samya he usee prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki "ling" ke vishay main bhi hindi or shuddh sinhal samandharma he
 There are only three men - first man, middle man and best man
 teenon purushon main vyavahrut hone vaale sarvanaamon ke aath kaarak hai, jinaki apni-apni vibhaktiyaan hai
 The "karan" factor is often counted after "karma", but the "karta" factor between "karma" and "karan" is counted among the eight factors of Sinhala
 "sambodhan" kaarak nahin hone se "kartri" kaarak ke baavjood karkon kii ginati aath hi rahati he
 The head of the sentence assumes "action", because no statement is formed in the absence of a verb
 yon sinhal vyakaran adhikansh baton main sanskrit kii anukriti maatr he
 Even then, there are neither "parasmappad" nor "atmanapada" like Sanskrit nor ten lotus etc
 sinhal main kriyaaon ke ye aath prakaar maane gaye hai- At the time of speaking and speaking the Sinhala language, like our Bhojpuri dialects, it is very easy in terms of suffixes, but equally difficult in writing and reading
 bolne-chaalane main yanava kriyaapad se hi jaataa hoon, jate hai, jaataa he, jate ho, jaataa he, jate hai ityadi hi nahin, jayega, jaaenge aadi sabhi kriyaswaroopon kaa kaam ban jaataa he
 Gender discrimination is considered as a zigzag for Hindi students
 sinhal bhashaa is drushti se badi saral he
 There you can use the word "hond" synonymous with the word "good" for both "boy" and "girl"
 prayek bhashaa ke muhaavarey uske apane hote hai
 It is useless to find their exact synonym in other languages
 to bhi anubhav samya ke kaaran do bhinn jatiyon dwaara boli jane vaali do bhinn bhashaaon main ek jaisi milti-julati kahavatein uplabdh ho jaati hai
 There is sufficient uniformity in Sinhala and some idioms and proverbs in Hindi
 uttar bharat kii ek se adhik bhashaaon se milti-julati sinhal bhashaa kaa vikaas un shilalekhon kii bhashaa se hua he jo i
 pus
 duusari teesri shatabdi ke baad se lagaataar uplabdh he
 Two hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, Ashokaputra Mahendra reached Sinhala Island, according to "mahavansh" he preached in the island language to the people of Sinhala Island
 mahamati mahendra apane saath "buddhavachan" kii jo parampara laae the, vah maukhik hi thi
 That tradition must have been either a "magadhi" of Buddha's time, or a "prakrit" of two hundred years later that Mahendra Sthavira himself would have spoken
 sinhal itihaas kii manyata he ki mahendra sthavir apane saath na keval tripitak kii parampara laae the, balki unke saath uske bhashyon athwa uski atthakathaon kii parampara bhi
 Those chronicles were later translated into Sinhala

 Vital waters or carbonated waters, or 'phenyl drinks', are virtually non-alcoholic drinks, which are artificially saturated with carbonic gas or carbon dioxide at various pressures
 saamanyat: peya padaarthon ko lavan, sharkara tathaa swadasar evam sugandhsar padaarthon ke nishchit pariman ko mishrit karke banaaya jaataa he
 Phenyl drinks are used both as drugs and common beverages
 fenil peya ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he : ek varg ke fenil peya ko saamaanya fenil peya kehete hai
 It is usually a mixture of carbonic acid gaseous water and a small amount of salt and other mineral salts
 saamaanya fenil peya kaa swaad namak ke kaaran khaaraa hota he
 The phenyl drink of this class is commonly called soda water, or saline water
 swaad evam lavenon kii visheshta ke kaaran inamen tathaa prakritik khanij jal main saadrishy hota he
 In fact, the manufacture of common phenyl drinks has been possible due to efforts to generate natural mineral water in an artificial form
 duusare varg ke fenil ko saamaanya bhashaa main lemoned jal, yaa meetha pani, athwa mridupeya, kaha jaataa he
 In addition to carbonated water, aromatic and flavoring factors are specially used and small amounts of sugar or saccharin are dissolved

 fenil peya ko botalon main band karne ke samay 100 se 120 pound daab kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jisase bottle ke andar 45 se 55 pound tak daab utpann hoti he
 The opening of bottles of this type of phenyl beverage causes bubbling due to the pressure of the gas and the beverage emits most of the carbon dioxide gas
 is kriya main adhik samay nahin lagata
 Therefore, the demand for such beverages has increased, due to which this action of bubbling continues for a long time and the foamy condition on the upper floor of the phenyl drink will remain for a long time
 is dasha ko utpann karne main saponin naamak vanaspatik utpaada kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This substance is obtained from the extract of the bark of vegetation and tree plants and by mixing a small amount of it in a phenyl drink, the phenyl condition on the upper floor of the drink remains for a long time

 Therefore, they are used in limited quantities
 fenil peya ke carbonatikaran kii saamaanya reeti main bhare hue jal main bal pump kii sahaayta se carbon dioxide ko sampidit kiya jaataa he
 This method was first used in 1790 AD by a scientist named Paul, this method of manufacturing phenyl drinks is also called Geneva process
 nirmaan kii yah reeti ghaan prakram par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran adhik safal nahin ho saki or sheeghra hi vaigyanikon ne satatprakram ko viksit kar liya
 Hamilton is credited with discovering the method of producing phenyl drinks on a continuous basis on a commercial basis
 brahma naamak vaigyanik ke satatprakram main vishesh sudhaar kiya tha
 The low-cost and small-scale commercial manufacture of phenyl drinks still uses the condensation process, but the continuous process is used on a large scale

 In physics, black body is an idealized state of matter, which absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it
 krishnika ek vishesh or satat varnakram main vikiran ko avashoshit or garm hone par phir se utsarjit karte hai
 Because no light is reflected or transmitted and when the object is cold, black appears
 haalanki ek krishnika taapmaana par nirbhar prakaash varnakram kaa utsarjan karata he
 This solar radiation emitted from the black body is called the black body radiation
 krishnika ke varnakram main tarang kii lambaai jitani choti hoti he, aavriti utani hi zyada hoti he or ucch aavriti ucch taapmaana se sambandhit hoti he
 Thus, the color of a hot object is closer to the blue end of the spectrum and the color of a colder object is closer to red
 kamare ke taapmaana par, krishnika zyaadaatar avarakt tarangadairghy phenkate hai, lekin taapmaana ke kuch sau degree celsius bad jane par krishnika drishy tarangadairghy utsarjit karte hai, jo taapmaana badhane ke saath hi laal, naarangi, pile, ujle, nile dikhte hai
 It emits sufficient amounts of ultraviolet radiation until the object turns white
 "krishnika" shabd 1860 mengustav kirchaaf ke dwaara shuru kiya gaya
 When its compound is used as an adjective, the word is usually combined into a single term as "black body radiation" or "blackbody radiation"
 krishnika utsarjan ek nirantar jari rahane vaale kshetra ke saura santulansthiti kii antardrushti pradaan karata he
 In classical physics solar equilibrium must have the same energy in each different Fourier mode
 is drushtikon se ek virodhabhas paidaa hua, jise parabangnee aapadaa ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jisamen satat jari rahane vaale kshetra main urja kii ek apaar maatra hoti he
 The black body can test the properties of solar equilibrium, as those that emit radiation delivered by the sun's rays
 aitihaasik rup se krishnika ke niyamon kaa adhyayan karne se hi kwantum yantriki kii avadharana ai
 The radiation of the black body is the solar equilibrium with the black body at a particular temperature and the light radiating from it
 yah prakaash ke thermodynemics santulan kii sthiti ko sandarbhit karata he
 Experimentally it has been established as steady state equilibrium radiation in a rigid-walled cavity containing a black body
 prakruti main dridhtaa se koi vaastavik krishnika nahin hote lekin grafite ek acha saadrishy he or sthir sthiti par grafite deevaaron yukt ek band box krishnika ke adarsh vikiran kaa ek acha sanniktan he
 a cavity, which has no black body, is not capable of retaining black-body radiation in equilibrium conditions, a fact found experimentally by Kirchhoff, but neither its physical significance was understood by Kirchhoff nor by Planck
 chunki prakaash nirantaravidyut chumbakeey kshetra kaa ek dolyman rup he, krishnika ke vikiran-adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki satat kshetron main kaisaa taapmaana hota he, jo shastreey bhautikee se virodhabhas prakat karata he
 Because the solar state of light was so confusing before the advent of quantum mechanics, these 19th-century arguments were presented with great caution that light has a solar equilibrium state
 nirdhaarit taapmaana main tii main koi padaarth ek oven kii tarah chamakta hua dekha ja saktaa he
 The point at which all solids produce a dull red glow is named the Draper point
 1000 ke par ek oven laal dikhataa he or 6000 ke par yah safed dikhaai detaa he
 As long as the oven is not shiny enough it does not matter how the furnace is built, the color of the light depends only on the temperature
 chunki rang tarangadairghy kaa pratyaksh rup se darshneey upaay he, isliye yah kehane kaa matlab he ki alag-alag taapmaana par prakaash se alag-alag tarangadairghy ke bich bhinn-bhinn urja vitarit hoti he
 The amount of energy per unit volume e at λ wavelength at t temperature is called the state of black body rotation
 vistrut prayogon se pataa chalaa he ki krishnika ke ghumaav kii avasthaa keval taapmaana par nirbhar karti he, na ki utsarjit padaarth par
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki kisi bhi anya vastu kii tarah prakaash vastav main saura santulan se aata he or is prakaar tii taapmaana main prakaash kii avadharana samaj main aati he
 Two things can remain in equilibrium at the same temperature, such that a substance surrounded by a cloud of light at t temperature can radiate as much light into the cloud on average at t temperature as it absorbs, based on the exchange principle of the prevost, Which refers to the radiative equilibrium
 vistrut santulan kaa siddhant kahata he ki utsarjan or avasorana kii prakriya ke bich koi ajeeb kism kaa sah-sambandh nahin he, utsarjan kii prakriya avasorana se prabhavit nahin hoti balki yah keval utsarjan kar rahe padaarth kii saura sthiti se prabhavit hoti he
 This means that the total light emitted by matter at t temperature, whether it is a Krishna substance or not, is always equal to the total light that the substance absorbs, surrounded by light at t temperature
 krishnika ke liye avashoshit prakaash kii maatra utani hoti he, jitani vah sataha par padati he
 The light energy absorbed per unit time of any wavelength λ is essentially proportional to the curve of the black body
 iskaa matlab he ki krishnika kaa ghumaav krishnika dwaara utsarjit prakaash urja jitna he, jo iske naam ko upyukt tehraata he
 This is the Kirchhoff rule of solar radiation: the emission of a black body is a solar characteristic of light, which depends only on the temperature of the cavity walls, provided it is necessary to have the condition that the cavity contains some completely black material and that it is in radiative equilibrium
 Ho
 jab krishnika itnaa chota ho ki iske aakaar kii prakaash ke tarangadairghy se tulana kii ja sake to avasorana sanshodhit ho jaataa he, kyonki ek choti si vastu lambey tarangadairghy ke prakaash kaa ek kushal avasorak nahin ho sakati, lekin utsarjan or avasorana kii kathor samanta ke siddhant hameshaa sahi tehraye jate hai
 In the laboratory, the amount of radiation of a black body is estimated at the entrance of a large cavity through a small hole, a ahoeleram, which contains a black body, which is transported to equilibrium and retained
 
 is chhed main pravesh karne vaali prakaash kii kisi kiran ko nikalne se pehle guha kii deevaaron par kai baar pratibimbit hona hota he, jis prakriya main iskaa avashoshit hona lagbhag nishchit ho jaataa he
 This can also happen without regard to the wavelength of the radiation entering
 The hole will then form a close approximation to a theoretical black body and if the cavity is heated, the spectrum of radiation of the hole will be constant, although it will also be necessary to ensure that some of the almost completely black material is placed in the cavity and Also that the balance has been maintained and maintained, but with these provisions, it no longer depends on other materials of the cavity
 
 Calculating the rotation of the black body was a major challenge in theoretical physics during the latter part of the 19th century
 aakhir is samasya kaa hal 1901 main maiks plank dwaara krishnika vikiran ke plank niyam dwaara kiya gaya
 Keeping pace with thermodynamics and electromagnetism, he made changes to the radiation law of Wynne and found a mathematical formula suitable for experimental data in a satisfactory way
 apane formule kii bhautik vyakhya paane ke liye tab plank ne yah mana ki guha main dolan kii urja santulit ho gai he
 Einstein took this idea further and proposed quantization of electromagnetic radiation only in 1905 to explain the photo electric effect
 in saidhantik pragatiyon ke parinamswaroop antat kwantum electrodynemics ne clasical electromegatismo ko khatm kar diya
 Today, these quanta are called photons, and it can be thought that the cavity of a black body may contain photons

 Planck's law states that jahaan The displacement law of wyne shows how the black body radiation is related to the spectrum at any other temperature
 agar hamen ek taapmaana par varnakram ke aakaar kaa pataa he to ham kisi anya taapmaana par aakaar kii gananaa kar sakate hai
 One consequence of Wayne's displacement law is that a wavelength at which the radiation intensity produced by the black body is maximum, λ max { \ displaystyle \ lambda _ { \ mathrm {max}}}, is simply a function of temperature

 In fact, the Earth is radiated into the infrared as a full black body, which will raise the predicted temperature by just a few degrees above the effective temperature
 If we want to estimate what the temperature of the Earth will be if there is no atmosphere, then we have to take into account the emission of albedo and the moon as a good way of estimation

 However, there have been occasions in history when provincial governors have been given additional and full authority, especially in cases when the provincial legislature has been dissolved, then administrative powers fall directly under the governor's jurisdiction; As it had been in military rule since 1958, from 1972 and 1977 to 1985, military rule from 1999 to 2002

 In this book, he writes that he wrote "when Sargon II and Sardanapulus ruled over Assyria" and "he was at war with Syria, Egypt and Babylonia"
 As such, Wells suggests that the Aryans ultimately "possessed the entire ancient world, the Jews, the Aegean, and Egypt alike"
 In 1944, the World Map, prepared by Rand mcnally, listed the Aryans as one of the ten best groups of mankind

 In the 19th century, the science of mankind has been shown by some scholars to be a symbol of scientific racist tendencies, "aryan lineages" are seen as a subset of the indo-european race that originally belonged to the indo-european language language

 These and other ideas developed into the use of Nazi in the term Aryan race to refer to what they saw as people of the ruling caste of Northern European descent
 He worked through eugenics to maintain the purity of this caste

 After the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the Revised Nation in 1945, most neo-nazis expanded their conception of the Aryan race and moved away from the Nazi concept in which Northern Europe's Teutonics or Nordics were considered pure Aryans and Western or All the people originating from the European branch of the indo-european people adopted the idea of being pure Aryan

 It was envisaged that North America, a part of the Aryan Federation, would be a new nation for the euro-anglo American called Vineland which would now cover all of Canada except the northern United States and Quebec and use the Vineland flag

 Silicon and oxygen silicate minerals translate directly into the predominance which constitutes about 75% of the earth's crust
 Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties
 Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish different species and in turn the formation of these properties are influenced by the geological environment of the mineral
 Changes in the bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in temperature, pressure and its mineralogy, however, a rock can maintain its bulk composition, but as long as the temperature and pressure changes, its mineral content is as good as Can change
 khanij unki rasinic sanrachana or sanrachana se sambandhit hai jo vibhinn bhautik gunon dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 Common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and habit, hardness, luster, diaphaneity, color, streak, tenacity, crack, fracture, parting and specific gravity
 More specific tests for minerals include the reaction of acids, magnetism, taste or odor and radioactivity
 Minerals are classified by key chemical components, the two major systems are granule classification and STRUNZ classification
 The silicate class of minerals is divided into six subclasses by the degree of polymerization in the chemical composition
 sabhi silicket khanij kaa ek aadhaar ikai he ek 4 - silica tetrahedra he ki, ek chaturpashviya ke aakaar detaa he jo chaar oxigen anions, samanvit dwaara ek silicon katian he
 These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give subclasses: orthosilicates, disilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates and tectosilicates
 Other important mineral groups include basic elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates

 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

"aurangzeb did not expect this clever reply, but he was very pleased with this wise presence
 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
 with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out, "you are more than a man, you are sawa- ie, a hundred and twenty five per cent hero ' kuch duusare strot batalaate hai 'savai' kii oopaadhi aurangzeb dwaara nahin balki badshaah farrukh sier dwaara inhen di gayi thi

 When he had disobeyed many royal orders, the king eventually sent some of them to Amer to bring them 'forcibly'
 Annoyed by his absence, Emperor Aurangzeb did not take away the title of Amer Raja from him, but on 13 September 1701, he was 'demoted', making him a modest mansabdar of only 500 castes, 100 riders

 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made
 ' The irony is that Aurangzeb, who once honored him by calling him 'sawai', was later so annoyed and prejudiced that he issued this insulting command - "by not giving Jayasinha a seat on Masnad, laying on the ground below"

 At the end of the war, the king of Jai Singh Bundi met his brother-in-law Budhsinh Hada in the battle of victory, but he did not give them a special welcome
 , Jaisingh's younger brother Vijay Singh wanted to get his sister married to Emperor Bahadur Shah to please the emperor

 These soldiers of these two kings fought a fierce battle in Sambhar on October 3, 1708, in which the Mughals won
 yuddh ke baad vijay kii khushi main mughalon kii mehfil ho rahi thi
 At the same time, under the leadership of Rao Sangram Singh, the Naruka fighters reached there and climbed on a sand dune, under which Syed etc
 was making a great deal
 narrukon ne un par ekaek banduukon or tiron se bhayanak hamalaa kiya
 All the Mughal soldiers were killed in it and the winning stake of the Mughals went out of hand

 " badshaah bahadurshah jab dakshin se vaapis lautaa, to usne yah jaruri samajha ki kisi tarah jodhpur or amer donon raajaaon se samjhauta kiya jaae
 To bring them, he sent Budhsingh Hada king Bundi, against whom on 21 June 1710, he appeared before the emperor near Ajmer
 badshaah ne inke jabt kiye rajya waapas lautaa die or in donon ko 4000 jaat 4000 savaar ke mansab bhi diye
 Even at that time, the Rajputs had no faith in the Mughals, so when Sawai Jaisingh went to the Emperor's camp in Ajmer, all the mountains and valleys of Ajmer were filled with Rajput soldiers
 mansab badhane or ilaake waapas aane par bhi unhen bahadurshah kii niyat par kabhi bhi purna vishwaas nahin hua
 Something happened to Jaisingh's brother Vijay Singh too that after being disappointed, he finally left the Mughal court and came to Hindaun
 jaisingh ko bhai vijaisingh kii taraf se sashastr vidroh khatra to bana hua tha hi
 In 1713 AD, in the name of compromising Vijay Singh and 'meeting the Rajmata', he along with his armed soldiers and chieftains went to Sanganer and imprisoned them fraudulently and sent them to Jaigad Fort

 After Farrukh Sayar became the Mughal Emperor, Hussain Ali Syed summoned Shyamsingh Khangarot and after talking to him gave Jai Singh the mansab of 5000 Jat 4500 riders from the emperor

 Swords were drawn between the Sayyids and the Emperors
 jaisingh ne badshaah farrukh sier ko bahut samajhaayaa ki saiyadon se yuddh karke unhen hameshaa ke liye saaf kar dena chahie
 At that time, 20 thousand Rajput riders were present in Delhi and Buddha Singh Hada of Bundi was also with them
 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya
 Jaisingh warned the emperor that his departure would threaten the emperor's life, but this advice was not understood by the emperor
 13 farvari 1719 i0 ko jaisingh dilli se ravaanaa hue
 a few hours after that, Bhimsingh Kota Raja attacked Budhsinh Bundi

 He also called Chhatrasal Bundela for war

 Jaisingh too had prepared to face the Syed in full force, but before leaving for the war, he summoned the Brahmins and donated them to the Amer kingdom and, wearing a saffron bana, he left to fight the Syed
 ye amer se aage bad kar toda risingh tak pahunch gayi the
 But both Nizam and Chhabilaram did not stand in their favor as promised
 jaisingh ko niraashaa haath lagi
 Finally, At Singh took Jaisingh with him to Jodhpur where he married his daughter to Jaisingh
 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden
 Even at that time, Jai Singh did not believe in At Singh Jodhpur, so he wore Jirhabkhtar even in his marriage

 When he reached Delhi, the emperor sent his new groom Muhammad Amin Khan to his tent

 4000 riders were added to their mansab
 isi maukey par inhen do karod rupee inhen inaam / bakhshish main diye jinako inhone namratapurvak lene se manaa kar diya

 maharana mewar ne jajia hatwa dene kii safalataa par savai jaisingh ko apni or se prasann ho kar likhit badhai bheji
 After the fall of the Sayyids, Jaisingh's political importance began to grow rapidly
 rajasthan, malwa or bundelkhand ke raja har musiibat main unase sahaayta or salaah chaahate the
 There was nothing in these areas without their opinion
 1735 i0 ke baad to marahathe bhi inaki salaah lene tathaa inako aadar dene lag gaye
 Apart from Sawai, the other titles given by the Mughal emperors from time to time were - sarmade-raja-e-hind ' / ' Rajarajeshwar ' / ' Srirajadhiraj etc

 There was a large army of 50 thousand soldiers with them and many mansabdars were also with them
 shahi topakhana bhi inke saath tha
 Mohudam Singh, son of Chudaman Jat, was the leader of Jats at this time
 parantu chudaaman kaa bhatija badansingh jo usase naaraaz tha, jaisingh se aa kar mila
 He gave him a big welcome
 ek baar phir inhone thun ke kile par gheraa daalaa
 At Singh Joghpur sent an army to help Mohammad Singh, but she did not advance to Jobner
 vibhishana kii tarah badansingh kii salaah se thun ke kile kaa vijay hona nishchit dikh rahaa tha
 Frustrated, Singh left the fort by secret route and reached Jodhpur near Atar Singh
 kintu jaaton ke thun sthit kile par savai jaisingh kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 He gave the Jagir of Bharatpur to Surajmal's father Badansingh and tied his turban as a king

 Possibly the greatest and grand task of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh's tenure was the establishment of the Jaipur city in 1727
 isaki neenv pus vadi 1 vi
 san
 1784, i0 ko rakhi gai
 Rajguru Emperor Jagannath took out a muhurat to lay the foundation of the new city and got the Bhoomi worship done
 maharaja kii ajna ke anusaar nae nagar kaa nakshaa dewan vidyadhar ne banaaya jo bahut pratibhashali bengali brahman tha or inke lekha-vibhaag kii seva main naayab-ankekshak tha

 jaisingh ko mogul badshaah dwaara malwa kaa dubaara soobedaar banaaya gaya
 He left for Ujjain on 23 October 1729 AD
 jaisingh apane rajya kii suraksha ke liye vidrohi marahathon se samjhauta karnaa chaahate the
 This compromise proposal was accepted by the emperor
 inaki is vijay par sahu se likhaa padhi hui
 Sahu was ready for this, but the Peshwa people were not much in favor of this agreement
 inhone deepasingh kumbhani ko sahu ke paas satara bheja
 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
 isse rajasthan main jaipur or bundi ke bich lambe samay tak bada du:khad sangharsh chalaa
 With this mutual estrangement, the Marathas again got the opportunity to intervene in Rajasthan
 jaisingh ko 1730 i0 main malwa main ittala mili ki buddhasingh phir se bundi par adhikaar karne ja rahe hai
 He sent an army to Dalel Singh's help
 On 6 April 1730, the Jaipur Army fought with Budh Singh at Kushtal Pancholas in which five Rajawat chieftains of Jaipur, Fathas Singh Sarsop Khojuram, Sanvaldas, Achal Singh and Ghasiram Achre were killed
 
 Buddha Singh did not get victory in this war
 malwa se lautate samay maharaja savai jaisingh kushattal pancholas gayi
 He beheaded the killed chieftains and gave siropaav to their sons
 jaisingh disambar 1732 main teesri baar malwa praant ke soobedaar banakar ujjain gayi
 This time in Malwa also, the number of marhtas had increased so much that their efforts to remove the marines from Malwa failed
 1734 i0 main khandaura ek badi sena lekar raajapootaana hota hua malwa main marathon ke viruddh aage aayaa
 Many kings like Jai Singh, Abhay Singh etc
 were with him
 jab yah vishaal sena rampura pahaunchi to use maratha mili
 But after sparing battles, they ditched them and entered Rajasthan from behind
 vahaan unako rokane vaala koi nahin tha or ve marathe jaipur rajya main sambhars tak lutpaat karte chale gayi
 In 1735, Peshwa Bajirao's mother came to the north to do pilgrimage
 maharaja jaisingh ne uskaa bada aadar-satkar kiya tathaa maharana se bhi uskaa satkar karavaaya
 In Agra, his Naib Subedar sent his Diwan Aaymal's brother Narayandas to welcome him and accompany him to Poona
 janvari 1737 i0 ko peshwa uttar bharat main aayaa uske saath holkar, sindhiya, panvaar aadi sabhi the
 While coming from Udaipur, Maharaja Jaisingh met Peshwa on 25 February in Jhadli village of Malpura region
 unhone unako anek vastuen bhent di
 Bajirao went back to Delhi

 The new Peshwa became Bala Rao

 His and new Peshwa Bala Rao met in Dholpur
 inke prayaas se badshaah ne peshwa ko malwa kii naayab soobedaari de di
 When Nadirshah came to India, everyone was very skeptical
 peshwa, maharana anya raajaaon va bundelon ko mila kar jaisingh, nadirshah kaa sangathit muqabla karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 However, on 24 February 1739, he defeated the Mughal army badly in Karnal
 yah bhi afvaah thi ki nadirshah jaipur hota hua ajmer jayega
 This was also a big danger for Jai Singh
 sab chaukanne the, lekin ant main vah mathura se hi waapas apane desh laut gaya
 "when Nadirshah attacked India, Jaisingh did not go to Delhi for help
 is kaa kaaran yah tha- tab nizaam or kamruddin us samay samrajya main ucch padon par the or nadirshah ke hamale ke liye ve log inke uttaradaayi hone kaa shaq kar sakate the, kintu samraat baraabar inamen vishwaas rakh kar inase aavashyak paraamarsh karata rahaa
