 This interpretation of the map raises three questions: pehali samasya kaa samaadhaan kaagaj kii ek ikai duuri par prithvi kii kai ikai duuri ko pradarshit karke kiya gaya he, arthath kinhin bhi do vinduon kii bhaumik duuri ko nakshe par ek nishchit anupaat main pradarshit karte hai, jaise nakshe par 1 inch = 1 mile 2 mile, 4 mile yaa 50 mile ityadi, yaa 1 ikai = 1,000, 10,000, 25,000 50,000 ityadi
 It can also be written as a ratio of 1: 1,000, 1: 25,000 etc

 The second solution to the problem is by map interpolation, in which latitude and longitude are projected onto the plane to facilitate the use of the map
 prakshep kaa arth samajhane ke liye kalpana karen ki kaach ke ek gole par apaardarshee rang se akshansh tathaa deshaantar rekhaayen khinchi hai
 Surfaces that develop as a tangent plane or plane on a sphere, such as a cone or cylinder, are placed and have a point of light at the center of the sphere, in which case the shadow formed on the tangent surface will be called the projection of latitudes or longitudes

 The size of these icons depends on the scale of the map
 maanchitr ke paimaane jaise-jaise chote hote jate hai vaise-vaise kam mahatv ke vivaran chhod die jate hai or chihn bhi chote hote jate hai, jaise bharat ke bhugolic maanchitr, gaanv, choti nadiyaan, vanaspati aadi nahin dikhaae jate or nagar keval binduon yaa chote vritton se pradarshit kiye jate hai
 One thing is particularly noteworthy about the symbolic symbols is that it is not difficult to show other details with length and width, ie, two extended symbolic symbols, but it is of special importance to introduce hilly and raised land on the map

 This is the first copy of the map
 iske baad litho mudran dwaara vaanchit sankhya main pratiyaan taiyaar kar lee jaati hai
 The main reason for hand-drawing the first copy on the blue print is to remove hand-drawn errors on the panel, or aerial survey section, and make the map beautiful and elegant
 iske liye jo upkaran prayukt hote hai, ve nimnlikhit hai : Pure lines are drawn from the desired scale of the map to the diagonal scale, which is reduced by photography to obtain a map of the desired scale

 The definition of "international NGO" is first given in the 288 Resolution of the ECOSOC on 27 February 1950: it is defined as "any international organization not established by an international treaty"

 These include: gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke anek vargeekaran bhi hai
 The typology used by the World Bank divides them into operational and advocacy: ek parichaalanaatmak gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaa praathmik uddeshy vikaas-sambandhit pariyojanon ko dizin or karyanvit karnaa he
 One frequently used classification is the division into relief-oriented as opposed to development-oriented organizations; They may also be divided according to whether they put more emphasis on service delivery or participation, or whether they are religious or secular and they are more public or private oriented
 Operational ngos can be community-based, national or international
 ek pratipaalan gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaa praathmik uddeshy ek vishisht vishay ko badhaava dena yaa uskaa paksh samarthan karnaa he
 Unlike operational project management, these organizations generally seek to raise awareness, acceptance and information through publicity, press work and activist events
 USAID gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ko nijee svaichhik sanghathanon ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 However many scholars say that this definition is highly uncertain as many ngos are virtually funded by the state and companies and handle projects with professional staff
 gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kai kaarnon ke liye maujuud hai, aamtaur par apane sadasyon yaa muldharakon ke rajnatik yaa saamaajik lakshyon ko protsaahan dene ke liye
 Examples include: improving the state of the natural environment, promoting adherence to human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing the agenda of a company

 Not all persons working in ngos are voluntary
 The reason for this is that volunteers are not necessarily full benefactors, and with skill, experience and contacts can provide immediate benefits to themselves, as well as those they are serving

 The annual budget of a large NGO can be hundreds of millions or several merger dollars

 Most of the ngos have to make significant efforts to finance such big budget

 Mostly Christian missionary class and 3

 The people of the first class saw Indian literature in a fair and scientific way through linguistics and considered philosophical ideas inspiring
 This class mainly included August Schlegel, Friedrich Schelgal, Franz Baap, Rudolk Roth Hermann Brorvos Theodor Benfe etc

 But non-british writers made various meanings either from the Christian missionary spirit or from the lack of Vedadi chivalric knowledge or because of the ambivalence of relating Sanskrit to European languages
 ye sabhi britain kii tarah pakshpaati nahin the
 But it is obvious that all Western scholars were well aware that Vedas are the basic foundation of Indian religion, philosophy and culture, and their proper interpretation can be based on nirukta and panini grammar

 Till then, there was no system of Sanskrit education in England
 sabase pehle england main, 1811 main oxford univarsity main sanskrit bhashaa kii shiksha ke liye vyavastha kii gai
 a bitter Christian came forward for this
 vah tha karnal joseph boden jo ki east india company kii sena main bombay main leftinent-karnal rahaa tha
 This, after retiring, bequeathed all his wealth, which at the time was about twenty-five thousand pounds, to the establishment of a post of Sanskrit-professor at the University of Oxford; And the university also named it 'boden Chair of Sanskrit in gratitude
 boden chair kaa uddeshy, bharat ke gurukulon kii tarah, keval saahitiyik drushti se sanskrit bhashaa kaa padhanaa-padhaanaa nahin tha, balki britain ke rajaitik or isai mishnariyon ke dharmik hiton kii purti ke liye tha
 Colonel Boden's will, which was registered in the Court of Canterbury, UK on 15 August 1811, has its main excerpts and objectives as follows: arthath main apni samast oxford vishvavidhyalay ko daan detaa hoon
 They should use it in a university or a college, where they think it appropriate so that the people of its country can have a proper knowledge of Sanskrit language, which can help in understanding the scriptures of the indigenous people of India and their conversion to Christianity
 is prakaar 1811 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit chair kii sthapana ho to gai thi lekin us samay iske liye koi manachaaha vyakti na mil sakaa
 The first person to be honored on the Boden Chair was H

 Was Wilson
 vah bharat main medical profeshan ke ek sadsy ke rup main, 1808 main aayaa tathaa 1832 tak yahan rahaa
 During this period of his residence in India, he learned the Sanskrit language, with the hope and purpose that perhaps this language knowledge could help him to understand the Hindu scriptures and to distort when needed and convert Indians to Christianity
 is sanskrit gyaan ke aadhaar par hi vilson ko, 1832 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit kii boden chair kaa pratham adhishthata banaaya gaya
 Here he first wrote a book for the missionaries called The Religion and Philosophical System of the Hindus

 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
 " "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor H
 H
 Wilson, was a candidate for the Chair in 1832, his lexicographical labours were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of india, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great eastern dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India"

 This is the reason when my teacher and well-known former officer Prof
 H
H
 Wilson, who was a candidate for this chair in 1832, was presented as the main contender for the post due to his writing work
 nishchay hi ise ascharyajanak na samajha jaae ki yadi mere shraddhey guruuji ke charan chinhon par chalate hue maine apane vyavsaayik jivan kaa mukhay uddeshy bharatiyon ke dharm granthon kaa angreji main bhashya karne ke liye suvidha pradaan karnaa he tathaa bharat ke dharmon or ritirivaajon kii acchhee jaankaree ko badhaava dena he
 In 1860, after being elected to the Boden Chair, in his book The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India, he stated clearly like a missionary: arthath jab hindu dharm ke majboot kilon kii deevaaron ko gheraa jayega, un par surange bichaai jaaengi or ant main isamsih ke sainikon dwaara un par dhaava bolaa jayega to isaiyat kii vijay antim or puri tarah hogi It is clear from these above that both the scholars of the Boden Chair misused their official position of Oxford University in the name of Sanskrit education for the interests of Christianity
 unhone praachyavidyaon ke shodh kii aad main apane mishanri uddeshyon kii purti ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiya
 Max Müller also worked tirelessly since 1847 to serve the purpose of the Boden Chair; Also contested to get a distorted commentary and Boden chair of the Rigveda

 Recently, however, it has been argued that external conditions do not produce stress in any internal capacity, but rather how affected individuals mediate it with their thoughts, abilities, and understanding

 model tanaav kii avadharana karata he ki kaise ek vyakti apane tanaav kii vajah kaa moolyankan karata he or apane sansadhano ke dwaara tanaav par kaabo paata he
 The model proposes that if the stress factor - stress link is broken, a potential stressor is perceived as a threat rather than positive or challenging and if the stressor is confident that there is no reduction in stress coping strategies Rather adequately, stress does not necessarily follow the possible factors present
 The model proposes that stress can be reduced, helping people with stress to change their perception of stress-causing factors and to cope with stress, providing skills that can improve their confidence

 is model main, tanaav kaa kaaran he aise samay main apane aap kaa moolyankan karnaa jab asuraksha or nakaaratmakataa kii bhaavana kii paristhiti ho, aisi avasthaa main agar "shant dimag", "aantarik gyaan or saamaanya buddhi, ke drushtikon ke saath is model main, tanaav apane aap kaa moolyankan karne se or kisi aisi paristhiti kaa saamana karne se jahaan asuraksha or nakaaratmakataa kii bhaavana ho, aisi avasthaa main acha mahasoos tab kiya ja saktaa he jab duniya ke sameep bilkul "shant dimag","aantarik gyaan" or "saamaanya buddhi" ko kaayam rakhte hue jaayen 
 This model proposes that stressors should be helped by understanding the nature of their thinking - especially to give them the capacity to recognize when they are vulnerable to insecure thinking, to relieve them and to force them to Use your natural positive emotions - which will reduce their stress
 yahaan tanaav se muqabla karne ke kai tareeke hai
 Some time management techniques can help control a person's stress
 akruti main jab maang ucch ho to prabhavi tanaav prabandhan seekhney kii seemaa tay karne ke liye dusron kii kuch maangon ko "naa" kar dena chaiye

 "destressylizer" is a process by which a person's stress can be overcome
 tanaav prabandhan kii takanic saidhantik pratimaanake anusaran ke anusaar bhinn ho jaaegi lekin unamem nimnlikhit shaamil ho sakate hai: Stress levels can be measured
 ek tarika homes or reh stres scale ke prayog ke madhyam se tanaavpurn jivan kii ghatnaon kaa mulya nirupan kiya ja saktaa he

 Karma and its fruits have an essential relationship
 vyakti achche or bure jo bhi karm karata he uske anuroop bhavishya main use sukh athwa du:kha kii prapti hoti he
 This is called Karmasiddhanta or Karmism
 charvak ke atirikt anya sabhi bhartiya darshan karmwaad kaa ek swar se pratipaadan karte hai or isko jivan ke liye atyadhik mahatvapurn maanate hai
 The first experience of karmaism is in the legislation of Vedic Yajna
 vaidic vishwaas ke anusaar yadi yajna kaa vidhiwat sampadan kiya jaae to usase ek adrishy shakti utpann hoti he
 It is called unseen or apurva
 yahi uchit avasar aane par yajna ke vaanchit fal ko utpann karti he
 In this way, man definitely gets the fruits of Yajna
 is karm or fal ke sambandh kii saarvbhaum niyam ke rup main abhivyakti sarvapratham rugveda ke rut ke siddhant main milti he
 Rit pervades the whole world and operates and controls it
 yah jagat kii bhautik tathaa naitik vyavastha kaa aadhaar he
 Gods and humans all follow it
 varun rut ke adhishthata maane gaye hai
 He puts the sinners in the cavity of utter darkness from where they are not repatriated
 isi prakaar achche karm karanevaalon ko sarvottam sukhon kii prapti hoti he
 According to the Shatapatha Brahmin, after death, the organism has to pass through the middle of two fires
 ve ashubh karm karanevaalon ko jalaati hai par shubh karanevaalon ko nahin
 The eternal and universal law of karma is the basis of the moral system of the world
 iskaa or adhik spasht rup main pratipaadan upanishdon main kiya gaya he
 According to Brihadaranyaka, man's karma only goes with him
 aatma kaa jaisaa charitra evam vyavhaar hota he vah vaisaa hi ho jaataa he
 According to Chandogya, a person of beautiful character has a good vagina, such as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya vagina and a person of blasphemous character are born in lowly vagrants, such as dogs, pigs, Chandals etc
 kaushitki upanishad main karmaniyam kaa spasht ullekh he ki jeev apane karm or gyaan ke anusaar keede, patange, machhlee, pakshi, singh, sarp or manushya aadi yoniyon main janm lete hai
 Thus it becomes clear that there is no place for chaos and coincidence in life
 praaniyon kaa janm, unka vikaas, unke sukh du:kha aadi kii anubhuti karm ke dwaara niyantrit hoti rahati he
 They receive the fruits according to their order
 karmaniyam ke jivan kii naitik vyavastha kaa aadhaar hone ke kaaran usase anek samasyaon kaa hal bhi praapt ho jaataa he
 Life is sad vah anek prakaar kii buraaiyon tathaa vishmataaon se bharaa hua he
 What is the reason for all this? According to Indian philosopher Nagasen, not all humans are equal due to difference of actions
 kuch adhik ayuvale, kuch kam ayuvale, kuch swasth, kuch rogi, kuch dhani kuch nirdhan aadi hote hai
 According to Vedanta, God gives them various fruits according to the order of the living beings
 usamen uskaa koi pakshpaat nahin he
 Similarly, other Indian philosophies also solve problems of sorrow, inequality, rebirth, etc
 through karmasiddhanta
 karm or uske fal kaa anivaary sambandh maanane main ek taarkik kathinaayee upasthit hoti he
 That is, the difference of more time is often seen in karma and its fruit
 yah bhi sambhav he ki vartmaan jivan main kiye hue karmon kaa fal manushya ko duusare janm main bhogana pade
 Thus due to such a difference of time, how is the relationship of karma and fruit possible? Indian philosophy tries to present a solution to this problem by the principles of the unseen, inductive, ashrava and non-ignorant forms
 nyaay ke anusaar, vyakti dwaara kiye hue karmon se utpann punya or paap ke samooh ko adrusht kehete hai
 It is combined with the unseen soul and when the opportunity comes, it produces happiness, sorrow etc
 mimasakon ke anusaar, yajna aadi jo kiye jate hai ve yagyakarta kii aatma main ek adrishy shakti utpann karte hai jise apurv kaha jaataa he
 It resides in the uncommon soul and in time produces the desired fruit of the yajna
 jain darshan main karm or fal ke sambandh kii vyakhya jeev main pudgal karmon athwa karm pudgal ke ashrav ke siddhant ke dwaara kii gai he
 Similarly, according to Buddhist philosophy, a very subtle and invisible power keeps on working inside the beings, which is called ignorance form
 yahi unke dwaara kiye hue shubh ashubh karmon kaa tadnusaar fal utpann karti he
 In this way, the elements of the unseen, apurva, ashrava and ignorance form the bridge between karma and fruit
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki kya karm kaa siddhant manushya ke karmswatantray kaa virdohi he? kya manushya purvajanm main kiye hue athwa isi janm main kiye hue pehle ke karma se itnaa bandh gaya he ki vah swatantra rup se kaary nahin kar saktaa? bhartiya darshan is mat ko sweekaar nahin karte
 According to him, man is completely free to do work
 purv ke karm manushya ke andar vishesh prakaar kii pravritiyaan utpann kar sakate hai par use kisi vishesh prakaar kaa kaary karne ke liye baadhya nahin kar sakate
 In moral terms, he is fully responsible for whatever deeds a man does, good and bad
 is prakaar karmwaad athwa karmasiddhant kaa manushya ke sankalp kii swatantraaa tathaa uske karmaswatantray se kinchinmaatr bhi virdohi nahin he
 It is due to Karmasantantry that after following spiritual demands like yoga, man transcends the Karmaniyam at the end and is liberated forever from the bondage of grief and birth
