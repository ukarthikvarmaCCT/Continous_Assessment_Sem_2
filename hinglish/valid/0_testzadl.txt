 atisookshmdarshi ek aisa upkaran he jisaki sahaayta se bahut chote-chote kan, jo lagbhag anu ke aakaar ke hote hai or saadhaaran sookshmdarshi se nahin dikhaai dete, dekhe ja sakate hai
 Actually it is not a new device, only a good microscope, which is used in a special way
 jab saadhaaran sookshmdarshi sadhakar pargamit prakaash se vastuon ko ham dekhte hai to ve prakaash ke maarg main padakar prakaash ko roak detii hai, jisase ve prakashit prishthbhumi par kaale chitron ke rup main dikhaai detii hai
 But it is impossible to see very small particles through the transit light, because the light that stops a small particle reaches the eye from the points around that particle
 isse utpann chakachaundh ke kaaran kan adrishy ho jaataa he
 If the microscope is arranged in such a way that the particles are put into a transparent fluid, in which they are not washed and then these particles are lighted from side to side, then the light can collide with the particles and enter a microscope placed above it
 yadi is sthiti main rakhe hue sookshmdarshi se kanon ko ab dekha jaae to ve purnat kaali prishthbhumi par chamakate hue binduon ke rup main dikhaai dene lagate hai, kyonki drav ke kan paardarshee hone ke kaaran prakashit nahin ho pate
 This is the principle of the microscope
 aar
 zigamondi or ech
 sidentoff ne atisookshmdarshi kii reeti main bahut sudhaar kiye jisase atyant sookshm kanon ko dekhnaa sambhav ho gaya he
 Now instead of sunlight, intense light of pointolite lamps is used
 is lamp main dhaatu kaa ek sookshm gola ati tapt hokar shwet prakaash detaa he
 According to the theory of microscopes, there is also a limit to the resolution of the microscope, that is, if we keep reducing the size of the particles, then a state will come in which if the particle becomes smaller, the particle will not appear isolated in its true form
 sookshmdarshi ke abhidrishy taal kaa mukh vyas jitna hi adhik hoga or jitne hi kam tarang dairghy kaa prakaash kanon ko dekhne ke liye prayukt kiya jayega, utani hi adhik vibhedan kshamta praapt hogi
 In other words, we can say that the resolution of a microscope is proportional to the face diameter of its visual rhythm and the wavelength of the light used
 saadhaaran sookshmdarshi chaahe kitna hi badhiya bana ho, vah kabhi kisi aisi vastu ko vaastavik rup main nahin dikhaa saktaa jiskaa vyas prayukt prakaash ke tarangadairghy ke lagbhag aadhe se kam ho
 But with the help of a microscope, under favorable conditions, such small particles can be seen that have a diameter equal to 1,100 parts of the wavelength of light
 in kanon ko atisookshmdarsheey kan kehete hai
 If we try to see these particles by microscope in a normal way, then they do not appear, the reason for which has been stated earlier
 din ke samay akaash main taare na dikhaai dene kaa bhi kaaran yahi he
 If, as stated earlier, intense light is thrown on the microscopic particles from one direction and those particles are seen by keeping the axis of the microscope perpendicular to it, then being microscopic, each particle will send light to the eye through scattering
 tab vah chamakate hue vrittakar vivartan bandon se ghira hua hone ke kaaran prakashit gol chakti kii bhanti dikhaai dene lagegaa
 The virtual diameter of these plates is much larger than the actual diameter of the particles
 isliye in chakatiyon ke vyas se ham kanon ke aakaar ke vishay main koi nishchit gyaan praapt nahin kar sakate, parantu phir bhi unase kanon ke astitv ko samaj sakate hai, unki sankhya gin sakate hai or uske dravyamanon tathaa gatiyon kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 The example of the principle on which the microscope works is that we see in our daily life when the rays of sunlight enter the room through a hole and give the knowledge of the existence of innumerable superfluous particles flying in the air
 yadi aane vaali kirnon kii ore aankh karke ham dekhen to ye atisookshm kan dikhaai nahin dengen
 In 1899, Lord Rayleigh proved by calculation that the particles which cannot be seen separately by a good microscope in a normal way can be seen by illuminating them with more intense light, although we can see it in this manner
 We cannot get knowledge of their actual size
 atisookshmdarshi dwaara bahut se vilyanon kii pariksha se pataa chalata he ki un vilyanon ke bheetar yaa to thos ke chote-chote kan kalileey avasthaa) kaloid state) main tairte rahete hai yaa thos purna rup se vilyan main mila rahata he
 With his help, Brownian motion is also studied in the Kaliloy mergers
 yadi kaanch kii pattee par thodaa sa kamboj ragadkar us par pani kii do boonden daal di jaaen or tab atisookshmdarshi se pani kii pariksha kii jaae to asankhya chote-chote kan badi shighrata se bhinn-bhinn dishaao main idhar-udhar daudte hue dikhaai denge
 This motion was first introduced in 1827 AD by R
D
 Brown saw it, so it is called Brownian motion after his name
 yadi bijli se hawa main chaandi kaa arq jalaayaa jaae to usase bhi chaandi ke kalileey kan praapt hote hai, jinako pani main daalkar brounian gati dekhi ja sakati he
 In this motion, the particles appear to be moving around with surprising velocity, which can be compared to a mosquito community buzzing in the sun
 atisookshmdarshi dwaara dikhaai dene vaale kanon kii sookshmata prakaash kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The higher the intensity of light, the more microscopic particles will appear

 saanchaa:magazine Business process outsourcing is a type of outsourcing process in which a third party service provider is assigned the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process
 Originally, this process was used by production companies such as Coca Cola, which used outsourcing for a large segment of its supply chain
 In the contemporary context, this process is mainly used for outsourcing services
 bipio aamtaur par ] shaamil he | BPO in which a company is contracted outside the country is called offshore outsourcing
 The BPO in which a company from a neighboring country is contracted is called Nearshore Outsourcing

9 billion and revenue from IT and entire BPO is USD 30 billion
 Thus India's share in the total BPO industry is some 5-6 percent, but the major share in the offshore component is 63 percent
 This 63 percent share is less than the previous year when India's offshore share was 70 percent
 While India has grown by 38 percent over the previous year, many other places such as Eastern Europe, Philippines, Morocco, Egypt and South Africa have taken stakes in the industry
 China is also trying to grow in this industry from a small base
 However, it is expected that the BPO industry will continue to grow in India but its offshore market share is expected to decline
 Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and New Delhi are important centers in India
 nascom ke anusaar varsh 2006-2007 main bharat main bipio niryaatkon kii sheersh paanch company ] daksh or tisies bipio he | According to mckinsey, the estimated value of the BPO market in the world is $ 122–154 billion, of which 35–40 share is retail banking, 25–35 insurance, 10–12 travel / hospitality, 10–12 autos, 8–10 telecommunications, 8 pharma
 , 10-15 others and 20-25 is part of finance, accounting and human resources
 In addition, they estimate that only 8 percent of the capacity was used in the year 2006
 == bipio laabh or simaaen a major advantage of BPO is that it helps a company grow in its ability to adapt to the situation
 However, many sources view this capability from a different perspective
 Hence business process outsourcing helps in making an organization transformative in various ways

 Key employees can be used to work with more time and energy in the core business of the company by retiring from unnecessary or administrative processes
 The key is to know what the main task to focus on - customer intimacy, product leadership or operational excellence
 Focusing more on one of these tasks can create a competitive edge for the company

 BPO helped Nortel transform from a bureaucratic organization into an efficient competitor
 a company can maintain its growth goals while avoiding the constraints of standard business
 bpos help companies to maintain their entrepreneurial speed and efficiency, which might otherwise be lost in expanding and maintaining efficiency
 This can prevent untimely internal changes that result from a change in a bureaucratic methodology from the informal entrepreneurial phase
 ek company tej gati se vikaas kar saki he agar uskaa poonji vyay logo yaa upkaran par niyantrit naa ho jinka karj chukaane me kai saal lag sakate hai or ve baad main puraani pad sakate he yaa samay ke saath company ke liye uchit na rahe paye | Although the above argument assumes that BPO organizations have increased visibility, management should be careful with its implementation as some issues may work against these advantages
 Problems encountered during this operation are: failure in service levels, unclear contractual issues, change in requirements and unforeseen charges and dependence on bpos which reduces efficiencies
 Consequently, it is important to consider these challenges for any company that wants to engage in business process outsourcing

 For example, outsourcing of an information system can pose a security risk from the perspective of communication and privacy
 For example, it becomes more difficult to secure data from a North American or European company when it is used or controlled from a subcontinent
 From a knowledge point of view, outsourcing creates a different relationship between the organization and the contractors because of the changing attitudes of employees, low estimate of expenses and the major risk of losing independence

 bhautikee main saral yantra yaa saral mashin un sabhi yuktiyon ko kehete hai jinako chalaane ke liye keval ek hi bal kaa prayog karnaa hota he
 When a force is applied on it, there is mechanical work and displacement of a body for a fixed distance
 koi kaary karne ke liye aavashyak kaary kii maatra niyat hoti he parantu is kaary ke liye aavashyak bal kii maatra kam kii ja sakati he yadi yah alpatar bal adhik duuri tak lagaaya jaay; arthath samaan kaary karne hetu do vikalp hai- Generally, the following 6 tips are called 'simple machines' by Renaissance scientists - utpaadit bal evam lagaaye gayi bal ke anupaat ko yantric laabh kehete hai
 For example, the mechanical advantage of a lever is equal to the ratio of its two sides
 isi prakaar kisi nat tal kaa yantric laabh cos ke baraabar hota he jahaan theta nat tal kaa kshaitij se jhukaav kaa kone he
 Although the method of working of each simple machine is different, but the method of working them mathematically is the same
 dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki har mashin main koi bal f i n { \ displaystyle F_{in}}, mashin ke kisi sthaan par lagaaya jaataa he or yah mashin kisi anya sthaan par f o u t { \ displaystyle F_{out}}, bal utpann karte hue koi kaary karti he
 Some machines like pulley etc
 only allow to change the direction of force, but other machines work to increase / decrease the magnitude of the applied force by a coefficient
 isi gunank ko yantric laabh bhi kaha jaataa he jo mashin kii jyamiti se nirdhaarit hota he
 In simple machines there is no source of energy, so they cannot do more work than the work done by the charged force
 yadi mashin ke kalpurjon main lagale vaale gharshan bal ko naganya maane to mashin dwaara lod par kiya gaya kaary, mashin par kiye gayi kaary ke baraabar hogi
 Since work is equal to the product of force and distance, aise yantra jo do yaa adhik saral yantron ke samishran se bane hote hai, mishra yantra yaa sanyukt yantra kehalaate hai
 Such as scissors work using the principles of both the lever and the wedge
 aisi mashine jo kaam kar saktin hai vah kaary saral mashiinon dwaara karnaa kabhi-kabhi asambhav hota he
 Such machines, in which many simple machines are used, are sometimes called complex machines
 jaise cykil, automobile aadi
 Maharana Kumbha or Maharana Kumbhakarna was the king of Mewar from 1433 to 1468
 maharana kumbhakarna kaa bharat ke raajaaon main bahut unchaa sthaan he
 Before them Rajputs could only protect their freedom wherever and wherever
 kumbhakarna ne musalamaanon ko apane-apane sthanon par haraakar rajputi raajnneeti ko ek nayaa rup diya
 In history, they are more famous as 'rana Kumbha'

 san 1960 se 2010 ke chah dashak rajasthan kii aadhunik kala ke liye do kaarnon se mahatvapurn kahe ja sakate hai
 One is that in this interval the work of many notable painters came out and secondly that some of the painters here also developed their own original, very personal picture language to make their identity at the national level
 inhen varshon ke dauraan vishvavidhyalay-str par kala ke adhyayan-adhyaapan kii bhi shuruyaat hui
 Research and research in the field of art also came to the fore in this period
 aaj rajasthan main chote-bade ‘aadhunik‘ style ke shaayad teen sau se bhi adhik chitrakaar hai, kintu sarasare taur par aise kalakaaron kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he, jinaki rachanaaon main apni chaitrik-niztaa he agar 'kathy' main nahin, to ankan main to avashya hi
 There is not a large number of such painters in India, who have worked only with geometrical designs in their entire art life, but undoubtedly Mohan Sharma was replaced by such people
 chiteron ke kasbe nathdwara main janme mohan sharma kii kritiyaan jhilamilaati hui ek aisi ‘utopian‘ nagareey vyavastha ko darshaati raheen, jo phantasy kii divya roshni se aalokit he
 The geometric designs that Mohan Sharma laid down from 1966 till his final work, were able to echo the transparent metaphors of the metaphorical metropolis, whose Nilvarni dreamy atmosphere seemed to penetrate deep into Mohan Sharma's unconscious
 chitrankan kii buniyadi sachchaaiyon lambaai, chaudaai, gaharaai, duuri, prakaash or chaaya ke prati nirantar sachet rahete hue mohan sharma kii kritiyaan un chitrakarshak jyamithik akritiyon si sristi karti raheen-jinhen dekh kar ham thage se khadey rah sakate hai
 If we want to give some 'macro' identity to his work, then we can say that in the end these works are a new version of 'ghanism'
 1970 or iske baad mohan sharma ne ‘cosmik-crystalls‘ sheershak se jo shrunkhlaa pent kii thi, unke bahaane armbh se hi ham kalpana or kaarigari kii ek aisi duniya dekhte aae hai, jisamen aaj kaa mahanagar-bodh prakharata se ubhara he
 These are not just normal or moving expressions of walls, squares and streets, but are the living symbols of a metropolitan life filled with shapes
 yahan rajmargon, fliovers or pulon ke sanket hai, jahaan roshni or andheron kii ajeeb si aindrajalik jhilamilaahat he
 Somewhere the mist of light peeping through the eyes of the windows takes our hands and suddenly sinks, it is like a myalogical part, where the rags of color's mystique, want to bind the city-shapes in their arms
 acrelic rangon ko 'fus' karte, unki damak or ‘divyata’ ko surakshit rakhte or ek rangeen prabhamandal kii shakl main unako chitra-falak par failaate mohan sharma ek manje hue craftman kii tarah saamne upasthit rahe the
 The picture world of Mohan Sharma is so solitary and stunned that we do not think of any form of human vibrations while thinking about this creation filled with imaginative beauty
 ek seemaa ke baad unke chitron kii nistabdhta, jadta or sundar ekaant hamen bheetar se kachotata he kyonki unke saje-dhaje rangamanch par kahin koi paatr he hi nahin
 In this sense, Mohan Sharma was an architect of resonant loneliness
 mohan sharma ke chitron main nagar-bodh jitani prakharata se ubhara tha-utana shaayad rajasthan ke kisi chitrakaar kii rachanaaon main nahin
 He kept trying to take the finger of geometry in his small but meaningful life to take us to the soul of the metropolis
 mohan kaa maananaa tha ki ab gaanv kii duniya main, uske pavitra ateet main lautnaa jab hamaare nikat sambhav hi nahin he, to phir kala ke liye vartmaan-jivan ke bimb or aadhunik sabhyataa ke pratik hi rachana kii prerana kyon nahin bane rah sakate ? jab manushya dwaara nirmit vaastu kii jyamithik duniya samakaleen samaajon ke liye ek anivaary vaastaviktaa he, to phir ‘kaalpanik’ gaanv kii taraf kala ko jo le janaa kya ek tarah kaa maansik palaayan nahin ? It would also be a strange thing that Mohan Sharma was as sensitive and hopeful towards the physical creations of man, as indifferent and disinterested as he was in the art-man's presence
 vah manushya dwaara rache gaye sabhyataa ke sansar ko uski sarjanaatmak kshamtaaon kaa ek behtareen udhaaharan maanate the, par canvaason main unhen manushya kii maujuudagi kabhi upyukt nahin lagi
 Mohan believed that modern man is selfish, cruel and ugly from within
 uskaa sarvottam paksh abhi bhi uski srujanavritti hi he- jiskaa praturup vishaal jal-raashiyon ko tham kar banaae jane vaale baandhon, cement-kancreet ke anant failaav or akaash ko chooti hui shahari-pragati ke vividh roopon main dekha ja saktaa he
 "it is not that i am not interested in 'man', but i am so weary of my own image, despair and discontent that i am afraid that the presence of such a man in pictures does not make him ugly xxrep 4 
 " Mohan Sharma also wrote in one of his catalogs
 inke chitron main nagar-anubhavon ke alaava ‘achal-jivan’ kii anandadaayak maujuudagi bhi he - khidakiyon ke sahare rakhi chaay kii megen, guldaan, pyaale, kettliyaan, fal or duusari chijen jinaki chhavi bhi vah apane kenvaason main ubhaarte rahe
 It seems as if nothing is 'solid' here, everything is transparent and mingled with glass, which has beautiful frequencies of light and shadow
 is aashay main inkaa amurtan ‘niraakaar’ nahin he, kyonki kisi na kisi chakshush-yatharth se vah hamen sambaddh karke rakhana chaahate the
 Suza has written, in Mohan Sharma - "there is a remarkable understanding of cubic structures
 ‘‘ unke chitra dekh kar pehali baar main hemanth shesh ko leonal finanger kii kritiyaan yaad ain, par suja kaa yah maananaa he ki ‘‘20 veen sadi ke german ghanavaad kii bajaae mohan sharma ke kaam kii jaden solahavin shatabdi ke chamunda devi ke mandir basoli kii shilpakritiyon ke adhik nikat hai
 '' mohan sharma kii rachanaaon main sarvatra jis ‘kaarigari’ kii tarif kii gai he uskaa ek sabab he - rangaton kaa sadha hua aalep or jyamithik aakaaron kaa blade sa tikhaapan
 Some clear signs of change can be seen in his works from 1976 and later
 sabase bada to yah ki unke roopakar utane ghaneebhoot or thasathas gunthe nahin rahe, jinte purvavarti kala-daur main ve rahaa karte the
 The craft of his compositions after 1976 became relatively simple
 usamen isi kaaran gaharaai or pariprekshya ke kuch nae anubhav pravisht hue
 The technique of color fusion is also here, but in later works, Mohan Sharma used to look towards a specific kind of simplification
 yah baat kya antatah unki chitrakarm main ai or gahari ‘paripakvata’ kii ore hi sanket nahin karti? The second major thing is that after 1976, his plot has also changed a bit
 keval deevaaron or bhawanon kii punrariti se hat kar unhone chunaav kiya -prakritik duniya ke sairon yaa drishyon kaa, jinamein sabase pramukh hai-samudr or registan
 From the artist's eye, there is no difference between the sea and the desert
 kala-prayojanon ke liye ve donon paryaayavachi hai
 Both have an infinite sense
 ve donon hi dekhe jane ke sukh se hamen bandhate hai
 Here the expanse of the desert or the ocean extends to the horizon and at times it seems as if it is nissim or beyond the sight
 mohan sharma ke isi daur kii kritiyon main sairon or jahaajon ke sanket hai
 Incidentally, it would be relevant to write here that there was a conscious feeling in the mind of painting
 yahan canvas ke apane texchar ko bhi prayog main laane kii koshish kii gai he
 "I consider art as an expression of mental peace and balance xxrep 4 
 " Mohan used to say
 sachmuch hamaare paripakvatar kalakaaron main inaki rachanaayen vishay or uske nirvaah ko lekar kuch sadha hua or nafis dekhne kaa avasar pradaan karti hai
 The gracious use of colors and the precise brushwork were Mohan Sharma's personal qualities — with which he developed a different idiom
 shaayad isiilie suja ne mohan sharma ko bharat main ‘paig’ kii kala-chetana kii ‘ek agali kadi’ ke rup main hi dekha or baar-baar saraahaa
 It was unfortunate for contemporary painting that Mohan Sharma suddenly left us
 cancer jaise jaanaleva rog se ladate hue apni antim saans tak ve jivan ke prati ashanvit the or usase bhi zyada is baat ke prati ki vah thik ho kar phir se chitra bana sakenge
 But this was not enough to happen
 bhale hi mohan sharma aaj nahin hai, par jo kuch vah apane prashansakon or parichiton ke liye smriti main chhod gaye hai- ve kuch aisi kritiyaan hai, jinka sammohan aane vaale sambhaavnashil nae logon ke behtareen kaam se kam bhale ho jaae, puri tarah khatm to vah ho hi nahin saktaa
 Vidyasagar Upadhyaya's name is well known in the field of Indian modern art
 vah apni syah-safed amoort kritiyon ke kaaran pahachaane jate hai
 Vidyasagar has also been among those creators who have created an art-collector and observer class outside the state for their art due to stylistic distinction
 vidyasagar ne chitrankan kii shuruyaat pencil rekhaankanon se kii thi or 1968 se 1976 tak lagaataar sadhano or arthabhaav ke chalate vah keval pencil main hi rekhankan karte rahe the
 His favorite pencil during this period was 3-B, using which he developed a relationship with the soft sensitivity of his medium
 inke yahan kaagaj par kaale-safed aakaaron kaa failaav pencil ke lagaataar strokeon se upajataa he, jisamen lead kii baarikiyaan or sthultaayen to kahin-kahin dekhte hi banati hai
 Although it is not the only intention to display the colors of pencils, we often feel as if we want to arrest the 'weakness' of the pencil and its changing mood in its creations
 Are
 kaale ghataghope vaataavaran kii sarjana karne main vidyasagar kii pencil he bhi siddhhast
 She is well aware of how effective blackness can create on continuous paper
 bahut badi sankhya main banaae gaye apane pencil rekhaankanon main jo bhi roopakar vidyasagar ne kaagaj par upjaae hai ve amoort hai-kahin bhi vaastavik drishy-jagat ke prabhaavon kii tarah nahin, balki andhere kii un thos anubhutiyon kii tarah, jo achetan kii jatil duniya ke pratibimb paidaa karti hai
 Darkness and a constant mystery is the core of these underlines
 kaale roopakaron ke dwaara vidyasagar andhere kii sristi karte hai or prakaaraantar se hamen ek ajeeb tarah kii layaatmakataa, rahasyatmakataa or gahare andrik samvedan main le jane kaa prayaas bhi
 In his early work the tantra-paintings are explicit
 kahin inaki aisi kritiyon main ham yon pratikon athwa guptangon se saakshaatkaar kar baithte hai, to kabhi dabi-dhanki pratikatmakataa ke sahare un tak pahonchte hai
 Prakash does not arise from the unfettered sense of his works, but wherever he is present, constantly makes him aware of his existence
 andhkaar ke jaadui rahasy ke bich maddhim se maddhim roshni kii lau bhi jaise apane liye ek aakarshan paidaa karti he-isi tarah khaali chhuti safed jagah kaa ujalaapan inke rekhaankanon main ek vishisht samvednaa jagaata he
 Sometimes he has embossed textures from the back of the paper to use the "composition" of his composition, sometimes to amaze the observer with surprise
 atah texcharon main unki ruchi ke kai kaaran hai-‘vishay’ kii aantarik maang se le kar keval kaushal or atmamugdhata tak ke liye
 But it is remarkable that taxpayers never transgressed their boundaries to spoil the inner discipline of their paintings
 ve jahaan bhi hai shaleen or shisht hai or apane ’hone’ ke baavjood itane ‘vaachaal’ nahin he ki chitron kii aantarik takat ko kshati pahunchaayen
 In series of pencil illustrations, Upadhyaya, like many artists in Udaipur, preferred geometrical structure for himself and his early works are mostly composed in 'central-composition'
 1976 ke baad vidyasagar ne pancil se hat kar nae rang-madhyam acrylik kaa sahaara liya or aaj bhi vah isi main kaam kar rahe hai
 Their change in the medium informs that the feeling of 'medium' becoming rigid was in their unconscious, but almost the same statement, they are the same form and the same central combination, in their pictures, on the canvas rather than paper in the initial few years
 Get landed in is arth main 1978 tak vidyasagar kaa madhyam parivartan ‘rachanamulak’ parivartan nahin tha
 It was just a change of art and material
 1978 or iske baad vidyasagar ek nae rachana-lok ke saath hamaare saamne upasthit hue
 The new thing he brought out of his stereotypes and plot was nature
 chaahe ve parvaton, badalon, nadiyon or chattaanon ke bimb hon yaa duusare drishy, vah purv kii vishaywastu-tantra or jyamiti ko tyaag kar us pahari or patharile thethpan ko rekhaankit karte rahe hai-jinke bich lambe arase tak ve rahe hai
 "it is not necessary for me that any experience has come or used in art in the exact same shape
" ek anubhav duusare anubhav yaa bahut saare anubhavon ke saath judata or roopayit hota he
 Which thing is useful in composition and work and how is it very complicated
 maine ek hi cheez ko kai-kai baar kaha he
 Like portrayed 'pebbles' in many of his creations and after saying it wholeheartedly took up another experience
 machhliyon, jahaazon ke movement, 'flying bards' yaa 'flying rox' ke impraishan bhi meri paintingon main aate rahe hai
 Vidyasagar tells
 in mukt or nirbandh rachanaaon se, jahaan unki puraani vishaywastu sambandhi ekresata bhang hui he, vahiin ye kaale-safed rekhankan or tailchitr hamen le jate hai - un parvatiy anubhavon main, jo apane angarhpan or swatantra - astitv kii vajah se lubhaate hai
 In addition to pencils, we go close to the scenes in these pictures of acrylic colors - with the feeling that these mountains and rocks are abstract, dark and yet we have a sense of belonging
 yahan ham prakruti ko, jo inkaa naveenatam vishay rahi he- ek samajhadaar spes-sangyojan main ghatit hua bhi dekhte hai
 The skill of putting and leaving the white surface of paper or canvas for your leisure is also here
 kuch ek baar vah apane layaatmak yaa jaivakeey se dikh padane vaale roopakaron ko ek khaas tarah ke jamaav ke dwaara vyakt karne kii ichha main duube maaloom dete hai
 Holding round stones, sky spots and distant images of plateau along the banks of the river, their works give us the light or blur of nature's background, apart from the real story
 atah jo chijen mul-falak par ai hai, unki bhoomika ke taur par vidyasagar uski prishthbhumi ke ankan main bhi ruchishil hai or asal main yahi in drushyankanon kii sampoornataa kaa rahasy he
 It is not irrelevant to mention another feature of Upadhyay's paintings
 vah visheshta he- rangaton kaa adhyayan
 The taste of the monotony of black and white, what dissolves the monotony of the canvas, are the colors
 rangaton ke bahut se prakaar inamen hai-taral, madhyam, gahare or ghaney
 It is because of the colors that we connect with the diversity of a particular kind of experience in pictures
 vah drushyankanon main rangaton se hi pariprekshya or chizon ke bich saapekshik duriyon kaa ahsaas jagaate hai
 The commentary of the well-known narrator and critic Ashok Atreya on Vidyasagar Upadhyay's illustrations is also significant - '' 


 The Aravali series did not have any less important place in his childhood rites
 aisa lagata he ki vidyasagar ke nae chitra, pahaado ke antarang saakshaatkaar ke mohak drishy upasthit karte hai
 They have the ability to awaken hypnosis
 yon ye chitra kisi bhi str par pahaado kaa koi ‘rekhachitreey‘ anubhav nahin karaate, balki atyant niztaa ke str par unke gopan rahasyon kii paraten kholte prathit hote hai
 At some places it seems as if they have been created by cutting shapes like the stars of a huge black night
 vah apane madhyam kaa bharpoor upyog karte hai or kaagaj par tab tak ghiste hai jab tak usase apekshit gaharaa santosh praapt nahin kar lete
 By keeping the loyalty of a laborer in his style, he hypnotises that nature, despite creating its heavy posture, stands for a spontaneity, a mystery
 xxrep 4 
 vidyasagar main jahaan pahaad sa baari man he, vahaan vah akaash sa vishram bhi apane prekshak ko pradaan karte hai or yon lagata he ki vah kisi aisi yatra main akele nikal pade hai, jahaan ‘padaav‘ dhundne kii unki sharten hai
 The large cylindrical, round, triangular, sharp, curved, straight, and high-down of the pencils indicate Vidyasagar through his craft to many such stops, that the journey seemed to be tiring or boring
 xxrep 4 
 Once asked why he has been drawing only in black and white, Vidyasagar Upaghyay had said- "I believe that only colors do not create the personality of the artist
" main rangon ko us rup main prayukt nahin karata, jis tarah kalakaar aam taur par karte hai, par main kaale-safed kii tones ko hi prakruti ke rangon ke rup main dekhtaa or prayog karata hoon
 The pencil was initially held in a kind of creative compulsion, but gradually black and white became an integral part of my expression
 aaj bhi man isse bharaa nahin he, isliye isi main kaam karata ja rahaa hoon xxrep 4 
 ‘‘ But later, the hypnosis of colors also attracted a painter like Vidyasagar, who had only considered black and white as his first expression
 haalanki vidyasagar rangon ke anushaasan main ekaek pravisht nahin hue, par syah safed se hat kar rangon tak pahunchnaa unke liye ek bade krantikari mahatvapurn parivartan jaisaa rahaa he
 For example, in these colored canvas we can see the various postures of nature, like an old hypnosis, landed on the picture pane
 in chitron main vidyasagar ne pedo, pahaado, chattaanon, badalon or shilaon kaa roopantaran kiya he
 There are shades of brown, yellow, black and other light colors here
 apni taral samvednaa kaa jaise aashray lete hue ye rang ek prekshak ko prakruti ke virat or uski lagaataar badalane vaali sanshlisht akritiyon tak le jate hai
 Vidyasagar considers the selection of colors very energetic for his new picture series
 unka vichaar yah bhi he ki ‘‘in rangon main main ek aisi taral, paardarshee or samvedansheel sristi khoj saktaa hoon, jisaki abhivyakti duusare kisi madhyam main shaayad apekshaakrit kathin hoti
 He is in favor of saying his old story in a new way in these paintings
 is chitron kii ek khaasiyat yah bhi he ki inamen vidyasagar upaadhyaay kii parichit chitra-mudra, vishesh rup se kaale or safed ko lekar kiye gaye anveshan, yahan aa kar samaapt nahin ho jate
 They open very liquid and light colors and their colors while retaining their familiar eye-beauty
 chitravkash or prakritik roopon ke prati unke man main jo ek khaas aagrah uski vishalata ko lekar he, uski abhivyanjana vah bade aakaar ke canvas chun kar karte hai
 Here it is a lot of leisure - like a vacuum, in which nature's colors are emerging between colors
 unamem dur tak dikhne vaale drishyon or avaantar bimbon kii akritiyaan hai
 The vast nature of nature has been condensed here
 unamem pariprekshya kii gaharaai, kathanak kii banaavat or texchar kii ardrata dekhi ja sakati he
 Vidyasagar has been able to remain poetic and sensitive enough in this colorful creations
 in canvaason kii sanrachana main lagaataa maujuud he- ek jyamithik lay or gati, jo aakaaron main ho rahe uddaam badlaavon kii purv-soochna jaisi he
 Vidyasagar has been in the mind of Anurag Vidyasagar, who is obsessed with his passion for nature and nature
 apane naveen chitron main vah isi lagaav ke or nikat pahunch rahe prathit hote hai
 With the active presence of fine fibers and black lines, he also opens the small, but fine and active sensations that are present in the forms before us
 ab inke roopakar utane aupchaarik nahin rahe, ve bahut dur tak prakruti kii nirbaadh gatishiltaa or uske andruni sanvegon ko tatolte dikhalaai padate hai
 In such free shapes, where new surfaces have been born for the expression of nature, at times there have also been the danger of becoming more 'unconscious', but all these things of more importance in a becoming picture-world
 Are not
 lagaataar kaam karne vaale chitrakaaron main vidyasagar upaadhyaay ek pratishthit kalakaar ke rup main hamaari abhishansa ke hakdaar hai
 And we look forward to every new creation in his works
 suresh sharma ke tailchitr, ek hi rang kii rangaton or usamen atyant saavdhaanee se rachi gai jyamiti kaa udhaaharan hai
 He is a painter of painters seeking his own meaning in a vast space of canvas, in which intense paranoia or antecedence is present for the 'formless'
 vishuddh rangon or rangaton ko spray ke sahare utpann kii gai usee ek yaa kuch rangon kii rangaton main chipa bahut taral par prakat jyamithik aagrah suresh sharma ke chitron ko apana ek alag vyaktitv detaa he
 It is auspicious that even if some well-known foreign painters leave their pictures and equations, their work is different from the modern painters living in Rajasthan and also 'adventure'
 suresh sharma ne tailchitron ke alaava murtishilp or graphic chaape bhi banaae hai or unki kala-yatra ke vikaas main in teenon madhyamon main kaam karne kaa anubhav kuch is tarah judaa hua he ki use alag-alag karke dekhnaa kathin he
 However, for the last few years he has been making only oil paintings
 par unhone aarambhik varshon main graphic main jo kaam kiya he, vah unki is madhyam main kuch nae anveshan karne kii ruchi or rujhaan kaa parichaayak he
 Suresh Sharma's art is different in its meaning and influence from many other contemporary artists living in Rajasthan
 unki yah srujanaatmak swaittata hi unki sabase ullekhneey puunji he- haalaanki in par-‘amaulik‘ hone kaa yada-kala jo aarope lagaaya jaataa he- uski vajah yah he ki inaki rachanaayen dekhte hue hamen nai american kala-dhara ke aid ranhard or josef elbers sareekhe kalakaaron ke kaamon kii smriti achaanak ho aati he
 This influence is perhaps also so transparent and obvious that he has been in the United States for some time
 jaahir he ki vahaan kii kala-pravritiyon kii chhap un par gahari he
 The thing to remember about his paintings is that his abstraction is not an abstraction of shapes or distortion - but by creating a 'formless', he also opens the door to another sense of difference from time to time
 iske chitron kii do visheshtaayen or hai
 One is that he has a relatively large picture-leave here and secondly, he works only on 'rangat'
 rangaton ko ‘prayukt‘ karne kii style bhi in acrilik chitron main bhinn he
 It is with these characteristics that the goals of his canvas are different from others
 inke chitron main samvednaa se bhari rangaten hai, jo rangon ke spray se utpann saare falak par kuch is tarah chai rahati hai, jaise disambar main udata hua koharaa
 They can be of any color - blue, black, violet or any other dark color, but they keep unbroken kingdoms all over the canvas
 inke bheetar ek ghumdan or manthan kaa bhav maujuud he
 It seems as if clouds change their shapes upon seeing - perhaps these shades of canvas are also in the same process
 isamen nirantar ek spandan or kampan he
 Sometimes they want to 'envelop' the entire plank like a sheet of liquid
 suresh sharma canvas par kahin-kahin bahut halke or dhyaan se dekhne par hi najar aane vaale jamitik-pattern daal kar hamen rangaton kii ekresata se bachaana chaahate hai, par ye jyamithik-chaukhaane bhi itane viral or sankethik hai ki chitra kii taral samvednaa par ‘boj‘ nahin banate
 There is no concept like background and mainland in his work
 jo prishthbhumi he, vahi falak par hamaare saamne bhi upasthit he
 There is no distinction between who is ahead and who is behind
 aisa isliye he kyonki vah kisi ‘aakaar‘ kaa amurtikaran nahin
 Suresh Sharma wants us to be interviewed by a philosophical void, with the help of meaningful effects of colors
 isliye iske canvaason ke saamne khadey ho kar hamen kai baar yah apeksha hone lagati he ki shaayad is par koi ‘bold‘ rang-ghatana ghategi yaa hamen rangaton par kuch ‘thos‘ dekhne ko milegaa- par aisa kabhi hota nahin
 All his pictures take us to another type of silence
 yah rangaton ke gradation se bani khamoshi he, jis par koi rang-ghatana nahin ubhartee, sirf dhundh kii tarah udati hui rangaten canvas par ghumadati rahati hai
 Suresh Sharma's greatest achievement or 'adventure' is that he has used only colors as designs
 yah kahana unke saath shaayad jyaadati hogi ki ekaek vah apane vartmaan kala-muhaavarey par ‘kud‘ pade hai
 Some of his journeys have been behind this formless journey - in graphic and acrylic, where initially, like other artists, we used to get engrossed in trying to take him into a 'shakti Pradhan' Amartan
 unke graphic chhaapon main yah mudra kadaachit zyada mukhar thi
 But the color schemes, shapes and sensations commonly seen from their canvases, respectively, began to fade — and took their place — only by the colors and colors that were stripped of the entire canvas, through them a subtle 'perception' Perhaps you think of awakening in us
 ho saktaa he ham main se bahuton ko suresh sharma kaa yah sansar bahut seemaa tak sarlikrut lage, kintu mere apane vichaar main yah sarleekaran ek khaas prakaar kaa amurtikaran he
 An immortal that is not so acceptable and common in the first instance that we can appreciate it while walking or keeping a 'casual approach'
 aisa karne ke liye hamen unke chitra-darshan ke saath hi bahna hoga, kabhi samaanaantar, kabhi usase baahar or pare
 Like existential thinkers in his entire creation process, he does not consider the presence of others necessary at all
 isi se yah baat saaf hoti he ki kyon inaki sari kala nitant vaiyaktik or vishayparak he? vah adhikansh chitrakaaron kii tarah kyon kisi aakaarparak amurtan ke prati aagrahashil nahin? As far as the presence of geometric signs in Suresh Sharma's work is concerned, as we said earlier, the real meaning of this is that these squares, squares or parallel lines contradict the color monotony of the canvas and secondly that they are painting Are indicative of a conscious relationship of the artist to
 kala-rachana yahan ek aakasmik ghatana nahin rah jaati, balki vah srijan-vritti ko sayas kala-vastu main gadhane vaali koshish ban jaati he
 These lines, squares and geometric signs are not so clear and tangible as to emerge over the entire composition, but their blur and semiotics often evoke in us a hypnotism of a different taste
 jitna ham unki upasthiti se alag hatane kii koshish karte hai, yah viral, paardarshee jyamiti hamaare bheetar utana hi kutuhal upjaati he, yon is chitra-lok ko sidhe sapaat tareeke se saraah paanaa kathin isliye he ki usamen drishyaatmakataa, khaas taur par sthool roopakaron ke prati aagrah kahin he hi nahin or jaisaa ki ham kah chuke hai ‘niraakaar‘ ke prati unka sachet vyamoh hi unhen apni tarah ke alag muhaavarey kaa kalakaar banaata he
 Seeing his work, we feel that one of the ways of being modern in art is perhaps that apart from the current rhetoric, we should enter the vast world without color and let the formless of colors and colors find their own meaning
 shabbir hasan kaazi ke kaam kii abhi koi roodhi bani ho- aisa isliye nahin lagata kyonki vah abhi apni chitra-duniya ko pahchaanane kii prakriya main lage hue hai
 He is counted among the continuously working painters who are going through the creative experiment of seriously looking for a clear path for themselves
 unki yah koshish hi is baat ke liye haman prerit karti he ki unki kala par charchaa kii jaae
 He has been working since 1969 and till now has been the subject of his basic interest - fantasies of tantra or geometry
 gahare rang unhen sab se zyada bhaate hai
 At one time, he was a painter to open red, black and green on canvas
 sattar ke aasapaas ke chitron main unke yahan keval hare kaa saghan upyog tha
 There was greenness all over the face, on which some of the 'cycadelic' resembling black-stripes and waves were independent forms of white black and other dark colors
 shabbir ke shuruuaat ke kaam main adhiktar aankhon ko apil karne vaala ‘vyavsaayik‘ dhang kaa amurtan tha, jo kahin-kahin ‘dizin‘ ban jane ke khatre ke bahut kareeb hi tha
 He was so attentive to the shapes in his creations that the geometric shapes were seen on the canvas with a hesitant use
 unki bahut si praarambhik kritiyon main ek khaas tarah ke rahasy, uljhan or jhijak kaa bhav bana rahaa tha or kai baar lagata tha ki unki chintaa, chitra kii andruni sristi main kam or use aakarshak rang-sangyojan ke saath puraa kar apane daayitv se ‘mukti‘ paa lene main zyada he
 But playing with the double jeopardy of typographical portraiture and old themes like geometry or system, Shabbir entered the art by making a new and original, but not so perfect, projecting and engaging
 udaipur-skool ke anek noujvaan chitrakaaron kii hi bhanti shabbir ne bhi shuru shuru main jyamiti ko le kar apni baat kehani chaahi thi
 The fascination of geometry, however, still binds them in themselves — but the references to geometry in the work here are not old — they are probably altered and amplified
 uski jadta tut rahi he or ab vah chitron kii duniya kaa hi hissaa najar aati he
 Some of the most familiar symbols of work and spirituality in Shabbir's compositions of 1975 and the following years are the lotus, the vagina, the moon, the eye, the darkness, etc
, which are threaded in the discipline of geometry
 in chitron main shabbir ne yon-pratikon kaa upyog chitra kii apni compojishan ko banane yaa use badalane main kiya he
 Sometimes, seeing these, the memory of the old system of Ghulam Rasool Santosh's paintings used to be refreshed
 par ye sab baaten ek banate hue chitrakaar ke saath aam taur par ghatit hoti hi hai
 Shabbir Hassan Qazi's Tantric-symbolism is a craftsman's skill in these paintings
 unamem ek niyojan or sadhav he
 He is a champion of hard work
 unke in chitron main roopakar pehle kii apeksha adhik thos or ytaakar hai
 They are set between sharp colors in geometric structures
 unke bich kahin-kahin prakaash or ujaas kii bhoomika he
 Looking at them, it seems as if something solid is getting gray and liquid
 shabbir ke is daur ke kaam main koi spasht loukik-chhaviyaan dhundhana jyaadati hi hogi, par kalpana karen to unamem daine failaae hue pakshiyon yaa udaan bharte hawaii jahaajon kii si akritiyaan pahachaani ja sakati hai
 These neat parts of 'hard-age' are very poetic at some places
 unamem ushn rangon kii upasthiti ke baavjood bhi ek maarmik taralata he
 Shabbir Hasan, Mohan Sharma are definitely behind in making color fusions or shades - but they are also engrossed in trying to find that there is little in the consistency or inertia of a canvas that is very well filled with deep or original colors
 Light, but sensitive pink or yellow colors may appear 'grown' to create a stir
 ye rangaten hamaare liye kisi aakaar lete hue ujaale kii sanketak ho sakati hai, jo kam hote hue bhi apni taraf hamaara dhyaan aakarshith karne main sakasham he
 Apart from green and red, Shabbir has done a lot of work in black and purple as well
 inke shuru ke kaam main pariprekshya-chetana utani mukhar nahin he, par baad ke daur main vah is kala-yatharth ke bare main bhi sajag hone kaa abhas dene lagate hai
 The paintings took a different turn after the early folklore orchestrated discoveries of folk adornment or the cycadalic use of black-white squares and stripes, and he would seek any mystery, nostalgia or darkness through black
 ‘kaalaapan‘ to vidyasagar jaise chitrakaar main bhi bahut he, par shabbir ke chitron kaa andhera bahut romentic or rangeen he
 Looking at his pictures, it looks like someone in the dark room is burning
 unki chitra shrunkhlaa ‘shamaan‘ main aisi hi anubhutiyaan maujuud hai
 It is also interesting to see the style in which the designs were made here during canvas holidays
 pehle ve pattiyon yaa farsh kii si chhaviyon ke dwaara kisi rah aapas main sambaddh the- bich ke kala daur main ve ek duusare se swatantra or nirpeksh rahe, ab phir se ve kellingraphy yaa lipi-sanketon ke saath aapas main sanyukt ho rahe hai
 There are two special trends in his new compositions - one is that Persian calligraphy is entering here and secondly, now the mood of the colors has changed a lot
 rang utane bold or sidhe nahin he, varan unamem ek ghani udaasi kaa sanmishran he
 The process is similar to that of gelatin paper in front of the arclamp in the theater to change the stage light
 shabbir main aae is badlaav ko ham une chitron ke mizaaj kii nirantarataa main dekh sakate hai
 Change is easy and natural for an artist to come to work in a particular idiom and to derive his / her possibilities
 yahan bhi parivartan haalaanki dhimaa or krambaddh he or iske peeche chitron kii yatra he, par ise sahaj hi samaj janaa bhi aasaan he
 Especially for those who have come to know and know Shabbir as an artist who produces sparkling geometry and 'optical illusion'
 ‘‘ xxrep 5 
 farsi kii yah kellingraphy keval kellingraphy kii tarah chitron main nahin ai, par iske peeche mere kuch duusare anubhav bhi sambaddh hai
 i have tried to recognize the world of spirituality over the years
 main ek ‘bande‘ kii tarah sufi piron ke jivan-darshan or vyaktitv ko najadik se dekhne jaanane ko uthkanthit rahaa hoon‘‘ xxrep 5 
 shabbir kehete hai
 "I don't know how suddenly i got a deep interest in religion and spirituality and in this passion i have been in the company of Sufis for a long time 


 All the 'feeling' of Sufism is abstraction" 


 

the idea of shabbir Hasan
 vah apane kuch chitron main isi ‘bodh‘ ke nikatatar ja rahe prathit hote hai
 Green color has already been present in his compositions as Islamic religious convictions, but even in one of his picture series, he used green and black in all its brilliance and originality, now the brightness of colors gradually increased By reducing, he is moving closer to the depth of his plot
 andhera, inke anusaar, chitron main sristi yaa ‘agyaan‘ kaa pratik he, jisamen hi divya roshni chhipi he
 "the black color of my creations is not negative, but there is life in it as well
 ‘‘shabbir kaa vichaar he ki shuddh jyamiti main kaam karne par bhi unhen vah lutf nahin aayaa jo anand dharmik yaa ‘sufi‘ samvednaa ko le kar banaae gaye nae chitron main tha
 Having become aware of the limitations of geometry, Shabbir no longer has the zeal to use it in that old sense and is bringing a lot of free forms to his canvas
 aise hi chitron kii agali seedhi ke rup main ab shabbir ne shaayad ek baar phir se prakruti ke prati apni dilchaspee prakat karte hue vrikshon, phulon or aise hi duusare aakaaron ko chitrit karnaa prarambh kiya he
 If the subject of these paintings is nature, then for their expression here they try a combination of geometric and independent forms
 purv main rache gaye apane aadhyatmik vishyon kii hi tarah yahan jyamiti ke prati unke shuru ke aagrah haalaanki kamjor pade hai, par jyamiti se vah puri tarah mukt nahin hue
 Geological motifs with base-colors are also seen in this canvas designed for nature
 canvas main ye jyamithik aakaar, mukhya rangabhumi ke liye bas ek aadhaar hi hai, jyamiti kii sundarata ko khojna inkaa mantavya nahin he
 There is a deep palette of colors here, but with a skill
 shabbir hasan ke in chitron main ham dekhte hai kaale, hare, laal, nile or isi tarah ke kuch garam rang, jinaki khubi, ek sadhi hui prishthbhumi taiyaar karne or phir us par apane kathanak ko upyukt jagah dene ke sandarbh main mahatvapurn he
 It seems that he constantly wants to work with the original colors
 in chitron main akruti kaa ankan niojit or sadha hua he
 Flowers or trees made by Shabbir are part of the color, they may not be visible directly
 aisa lag saktaa he ham kisi andhere swapn yaa adhkhuli neend main in phulon ko dekh rahe hai
 This is a remarkable change and a new halt is being heard in their canvas
 maanav akritiyon ke khandit bimb unke haal ke kaam main aaye hai
 His remarkable features in attractive color experimentation and technique are notable features, with the help of which we can have deep hopes from painters like Shabbir Hasan Qazi
 sahitya kii tarah kala ke liye aanchalikta bhi ek badi prerana he
 Probably because people can find their best past in life itself
 hamaare nagar-chetana ke ped kii aadim jaden antat gaanvon main hi hai, isliye bhavanishankar sharma ke chitron or rekhaankanon main hamen gum phir kar kisi na kisi rup main graamy-sansar ke drishyon se saakshaatkaar karnaa padataa he to yah koi aswabhaavik ghatana nahin
 He interchangeably brings to us the imagery of a village in Rajasthan
 ye bimb ho sakate hai: moron ke, jhonpadiyon ke, unke alankrita daravaajon ke, baadon ke or khaparillon ke, aalon, khidakiyon or vrikshon ke
 Over the years, Bhawanishankar has been associated with a creative impetus towards the 'village' - while simplifying its illustrations, he urges us to at least take in the ubiquity of regional scenes in color
 vah canvas par sidhe kaali syaahi se rekhankan karte hai
 He fills a relatively large size of painted white canvas with an active drawing of ink
 yahan vanaspati yaa uljhi hui theth belon or vrikshavliyon kii maujuudagi to he hi, jo drishy ke nirmaan main bhagidaar hai, jhonpadiyon or tapt bhu-khandon ke prati kalakarmi ke ishaare bhi hai: gramin drishyon kii ek taral abhivyakti, jo kuch pahchaan main aa sakane vaale sugyaat pratikon se mil kar bani he
 Bhavani Shankar's picture is very different from PN Choyal of Udaipur, another familiar senior artist who portrays the rural world itself
 pi
en
choyal kii aanchalik duniya main jhonpadiyon, puraani barasaaton se pasiji hui deevaaron, pedo or daravaajon ke roopakar aapas main ghul mil kar ek vicitra rangamay dhundhalake main thahar gaye se lagate hai
 They appear to be stagnant, melting and flowing
 unamem ek texcharpurn ardrata he, kintu bhavanishankar utane pratikatmak or dhundhamay nahin
 He wants to make us aware of the zonal life directly in very few lines
 bhavanishankar ne graphic chaape bhi taiyaar kiye hai jinamein adhikanshtah moron kaa adhyayan he
 In these impressions created in the 1970s and around, we do not see things exactly as they are, but come out through our individual creations - they look a bit changed to us
 lekin us seemaa tak bhi nahin ki ve hamen begaani yaa ajanabi lagane lagen
 These raids have the shapes of peacocks and hens, their speed and different postures, with limited deformation
 vanasthali main, jahaan vah rahete or kaam karte rahe the-mor bahut hai
 Peacocks have been part of the ashram culture of Vanasthali Vidyapeeth
 rekhaankanon main bhavani shankar moron kii har ek ’adaa’ ko pakadaney kii koshish karte hai
 They dance, snort, love, fight and walk, marking the peacock postures
 moron kaa unka adhyayan kuch arthon main unke pita-chitrakaar devkinandan sharma se kinchit bhinn he
 In these compositions, he expresses in a non-traditional way, as distinct from his art-master and father, the chalk-chowand of peacocks, ready for flight or hurt by dog attacks in as short and meaningful lines as possible
 in rachanaaon main bade unmukt dhang se, aiching, oisat, lithograph yaa woodkat takneekon main mor kii gatiman akruti kaa amoort chithran kiya gaya he
 The speed of the lines and the simplicity of the technique can be called the characteristics of these impressions
 1975 or uske baad bhavanishankar kii kritiyon main ek ullekhneey badlaav dekha ja saktaa he
 That is, not only some other subjects have entered his interest, but in addition to the graphic in this era, he also makes the medium of oil paintings his medium of expression
 haalaanki unke is kaal kii rachanaaon main bhi mor kii upasthiti yada-kada barkaraar he, kintu vah iske alaava rajasthan ke jan-jivan, melon-thelon or aanchalik duniya ke rangon kii chata or ujaas bhi laate hai
 One notable feature of his paintings of this period is the use of painting
 bhavanishankar puure falak par ghatatope rachana nahin karte
 He also leaves a part of him unfinished for the observer's imagination
 canvas kaa yah khalipan koi khalipan nahin, par iske bheetar bhi ek adrushya rachana-lok maujuud he, jo saamne dikhalaai dene vaale moort kaa hi prasar yaa vistaar he
 We can feel hidden scenes even within an empty space
 jaise rajasthan ke melon se sambaddh chitron main unke liye maanavakritiyaan asal main keval rang-bodh hi rah gai hai
 The crowd gathered at the fair has been cultivated through little red, blue, yellow and black spots
 kisi nadi-tat par jude meley main sabase peeche khadey ho kar jaise koi chhayakaar samooche drishy ko 'wide angal' se dekhtaa ho, vaise hi vah 'duriyon' kaa sanket dete rajasthan ke melon kii sphit chhaviyaan rachana chaahate hai
 In some such paintings the whole part of the canvas was not used, but in the 'vacuum', the sense of 'being' is embodied
 inke chitravkash kii yah ek rachanaatmak puunji he
 In the past, Bhawanishankar Sharma started work on another series, in which he is still doing compositions today
 yahan vah do vipareet kahi jaani vaali samvednaaon kaa sangyojan upasthit karte hai
 Nature, as we said earlier, is a very meaningful concern for modern painters
 bhavanishankar bhi vanaspati yaa prakruti kii apni sanrachanaon se sphurti grahan karte hai
 Just as the vast and hard boulders of the jungle bails and free twigs do not prevent them from moving forward, so does the solid inertia of 'hard Age' continuously break out and make its presence felt in moving vegetation paintings
 kaale thos jyamithik block inke yahan ‘matter‘ yaa bhautik vastujagat kaa pratik hai, jinke madhya daraaron se adamya jivan kaa pratik vanaspati khud-ba-khud koi aakaar le rahi he
 Vegetation reflects consciousness or 'concussion' at this place
 ek aisi gatiman chetana, jisaki nirantarataa or samarthy isi main sannihit he ki vah apni jijivishaa ko barkaraar rakh sake, samast avarodhon ke baavjood! is shrunkhlaa ke chitra mishrit-madhyam main hai jinamein canvas par syaahi or telarangon kaa mila-jula istemaal he
 In one part of the canvas, where he skillfully marks the texture of the vegetation with the help of ink-drawing, most of the work is done directly by brushing it with rough and dark colors
 isse rachana kaa paramparaagat romantisism tuutata he vahiin yah baat rachana ke do bhinn dhruvon ko ek saath saamne rakhane kii koshish bhi he
 In these compositions, Bhawanishankar is not as insistent on human figures, but on trying, the observer can find images of man surrounded by birds and images of trees in their designs
 laghuchitra main kii gai kaarigari kii hi tarah vah bahudhaa canvas par kaali syaahi se rekhankan rachate hai
 Like the dense and tangled amarabells that want to dominate the power of the entire tree in each other, the vines and the branches of the trees seem to be moving as they move in their pictures
 vah adhiktar apane roopakaron ko pallavit karne main hi tallin dikhalaai padate hai
 Therefore, if the title of this series is 'flowering of Form' then it is not inconsistent
 ‘‘prakruti main milane vaale roopakaron se main apni baat shuru karata hoon
 The design changes according to the internal needs of the composition
 main bhi chitra-samvednaa ke anuroop inkaa sarleekaran yaa amurtikaran karata hoon xxrep 5 
 ‘‘ bhavani shankar kehete hai
 Here it may not be irrelevant to discuss such painters underlining contemporary art-trends, who are the creators of impressionist walks and naturalistic paintings
 vaash-takanic main swa

 agarwal, rajeev garg raghunatha or pradeep verma aadi prakruti ke alag-alag moods or uski samvedansheeltaa ko prabhaavvaadi dhang se pakadte rahe hai jinke yahan drishyaatmak bimbon kii uplabdhta he
 'moni Sanyal' has also been such an extraordinary painter of the senior generation, whose compositions provide earthy, tree-like, temperament of seasons and a comical, but very beautiful depiction of working women
 swa
 suresh rajoria rekhaankanon or jalarangon main vrikshon, badalon, chattaanon, ghaas or barsaat ke sarlikrut bimb paidaa karte the
 There are brown mountains in his creations, green fields somewhere, flowing waterfalls, deep forests and yellow spots of sunshine! Rajoria successfully tried to remove the slums, the working villages, the low-lying streets of the town, and the gloomy standing trees, leaving leaves on the paper in March with the help of its rustic smell
 kathakaar-chitrakaar ram jaisawaal ke jalarang-chitron main prakruti ke bhinn-bhinn swaroop aakaar grahan karte hai
 He is the author of five story collections and one poetry collection in the field of writing, especially story
 apane aarmabhik shikshak daur main vah pehle meerut gaye, baad main lakhanu ke college of art main adhyaapan se jud gayi
 In 1964, he came to the post of professor in Dayanand College, Ajmer, after teaching art at postgraduate level in Rajasthan and then he came here for the seasons, trees, local mountains, houses, animals, markets, streets and everyday scenes
 Illustrated in Wash-style
 unhone na keval bhartiya devi-devataaon ko hi rangon main utaara, par jaishankar ‘prasad‘ kii kuch kavitaaon par aadhaarit kalpanasheel chitra bhi banaaye
 He got a special place and recognition in the art world by taking his personal portraits
 ajmer main jaisawaal ne jalarang chithran kii bahut si baarikiyon kaa sparsh karte hue kai saire or portate rache, kintu ram jaisawaal kii pratibha par paramparaagat bengal or lakhanu gharaanon ke ankan kaa prabhaav hi zyada mukhar rahaa
 He has always been conscious of providing a handsome plank to the audience, even if he has also produced a portrait like 'street Singers' or 'ethics' in the name of perceived modernity
 parampara kaa naye sandarbhon evam myanon main roopaantaran, yahan kii vartmaan kala-pravritiyon kii ek ullekhneey visheshta he
 This quality can also be seen in the paintings of Shail Choyal
 rudh vargeekaran karnaa chahen to unki kritiyon main hamen mewar style kaa sarjanaatmak roopaantaran dekhne ko mil jaataa he
 He has been trying to take away the traditional pen building-crafts, vegetation and his interior
 inhone armbh se hi miniecharon kii prachlit or drushyavali ke prati ek sthai-anuraag viksit karte hue aankhon ko acha lagane sakane vaala aisa kaam kiya he, jise ham parampara ke ‘istemaal‘ ke rup main or bhi chitrakaaron main bhi dekh sakate hai
 The attractive color scheme and combination ability in his work is due to the fact that Shell has used the tradition as a ladder
 shail choyal ke chitron kii visheshta or kamajori donon yah he ki vah bhi miniechar style ke parmparik chiteron hi kii tarah hamen bas gum-phir kar ek ‘sthool‘ chakshush sukh se hi aabaddh karnaa chaahate hai
 Even if they are not as professional artists in traditional painting, Shail Choyal takes us mostly to his neo-commercial prowess, based on the shortness, aesthetic appeal and subjectivity of the miniatures
 jaisaa ki hamane pehle kaha, inke chitron kii anivaary shart he- drishyaatmakataa
 Whether they are the convergence moments of the hero-heroine or their bedroom differences; Shail Choyal often appears in his paintings as an exponential, but plot-retiring artist
 yah swa
 mohan sharma jaise chitrakaaron kii mahanagareey shilp-rachanaaon main aayaa sannata yaa prabhaa shah ke madhyakaalin mehalon kaa taral ekant nahin, balki shail choyal ke yahan antarang sannata, mewari khidakiyon or jharokhon kii kamaniyata, rajmahalon kii parbhasakata or hari-saghan vanaspati se mil kar bana he, jo ham laghuchitra parampara main bhi baraabar dekhte aae hai
 He often wants to hand us a colorful 'neo-feudal' world, preserving the visibility of the vents, stairs, munders and floors in his oil paintings and graphic impressions
 unki rachanaayen dekh kar bahudhaa aisa lagata he, jaise vah pariprekshya kii adla-badali se drishyon ke bheetar chhipe hue drishy hamaare liye khoj kar laana chaahate hon
 In the sense of definition, he is not only a painter of walks or sightings, but on the canvas, the Shail Choyals are richly marked by traditional Mewari buildings, Rajput chhatris and ornate gateways, revealing the lack of mountains, trees and vegetation
 lagbhag isi vishaywastu ke aasapaas prabhaa shah ke tailchitr prekshak ke liye laate hai- garimamay gumbajon, chhatriyon or nafis rajmahalon ke bimb! jyamiti kaa kalpanapurna upyog prabhaa shah main he
 She makes more and more use of colors of one or two colors - Rajasthan, which is unmatched in terms of its craft, typicality and architecture
 kahin na kahin udaipur unke gahare achetan main jarur chipa he
 She only embodies images of traditional chhatris, palaces and buildings of Rajasthan, in oil springs
 prabhaa shah ke chitron main rangaton main khoe prasaad or bhawan, prashanth or stabdh hai
 Here for some years none of his work has been shown in the performance
 udaipur ne ek chitropam shahar ke bataur bahuterey chitrakaaron ko chitra-rachana kii prerana di he
 Kiran Murdia, like Parmanand Choyal, Chhotulal, Prabha Shah, Shail Choyal, Abha Murdia, Charan Sharma, Hemant Chitrakar and many others, is influenced by the 'bhavan-geography' of his native city Udaipur, but the remarkable thing is that Each painter's marking approach is different from each other
 kehane ko to kiran murdia ke chitron main bhi mewari parvatamalaon, raaston, pedo or mehalon kii maujuudagi he, par kiran kii samvednaa utani 'saral' nahin
 Kiran Murdia in the pictures is very informal, composed and indigenous
 parvaton-khandon or un par based hue dhaval-bhawanon, aapas main gunthe hue ped-paudhon evam drushyavali ke chithran main vah chhotulaal, shail choyal yaa prabhaa shah or anyon se saghan, thasathas, aadhunik alankruti se yukt va bhinn hai
 Likewise, not as much as Shail Choyal about Udaipur, but yes, among the very artistic and sensitive painters of the older generation, their artist father PN Choyal

 Manasaram has carved a niche for himself in many fields
 mansaram ne keval canvas par rangon kaa aamayaham istemaal kar lene se hi santosh nahin kiya, unhone apane chitrakaar ko duusare madhyamon ke bheetar bhi gaharaai se jhaankne kaa mauka diya
 It is interesting to see that he started a permanent facility in his birthplace-mount Abu a few years ago as a painter-dwelling workshop
 paanchal mansaram ne rangon, photography, graphic, computer or photocopy mashin ke mili-jule upyog se bharat ko lekar behtareen rachanaaen desh-videshon main pradarshit kin
 Apart from the Aravali Mountains of Mount Abu, the congestion of Mumbai, the Ganges of Banaras, etc
, he has realized the common images of India with great skill and imagination
 mansaram ne apni kalakarmi patni tarunika ke sahyog se aravali kii vishaal chattaanon par vibhinn rangon se chitrakaari karke mount abu main bane apane ghar ‘meet‘ ko bahut dur se hi ek kalakriti kii tarah dekhe ja sakane laayak jagah main tabdeel kar diya he
 Every year he comes to his homeland and takes long trips to keep himself connected with the latest activities of contemporary Indian art
 narayan acharya ne graphic chaape or anyon ne tailchitr banaae hai to pi
 mansaram kii kala-sristi apekshaakrit vyapak he
 Narayan Acharya's contribution can be said to be important in selecting the graphic medium for its expression, as it was not so 'popular' when he adopted the medium
 charan sharma ne apni praarambhik kritiyon main syaahi or duusare mishrit madhyamon kaa upyog kiya par apane baad ke kala-daur main vah bahut bade aakaar ke acrelic rangon main sanyojit rajasthan ke shilp kii bahut si rochak-smritiyaan le kar upasthit dikhte hai
 In his latest work, we do not see Charan Sharma as constantly connected to the building memories of his city, as it is in the works of Prabha Shah and Shail Choyal
 charan kii ardhangini nimisha sharma ek bahut sakasham aadhunik kalakarmi hai
 In all the early sketches and oil paintings of Charan Sharma, Nathdwara was also present in a symbolic way
 aasapaas kii duniya chitrakaar kii samvednaa kaa atoot hissaa ho- yah baat sahaj or swaabhaavik he or isi se ham charan sharma ke praarambhik kaam main mewari-baavadiyon, kundon or thasathas based makaanaat dekh sakate hai
 Just like in the paintings of Bhawanishankar, the Rajasthani fair - the cart or the peacock of Vanasthali
 charan sharma ke praarambhik kaam main rajasthan kii bahut si smritiyaan hai
 Charan Sharma initially worked in graphs and water sports, later he ventured into oil sports and acrylic medium
 apane baad ke kaam main charan ne gautam buddha kii tapasvi chhaviyon ko ek vilakshan gaharaai se moort kiya he
 With his Rajasthani painter wife Nimisha Sharma, he has been living in Mumbai for several decades now making huge canvas sizes, which are also a creative adaptation of his photography experiences and as a subject, the gross reality of the Rajasthan world
 His vow to go further

 He wants to change all his old works and create new ones

 In the installation-series titled Tentua Daba Do, Chintan made a striking commentary on the typical Indian gullible mindset of female feticide

 Contrary to the above appeal, a court of cert is not a subject of authority
 cert ke ek pradesh ke liye yachika daayar kerani padati he, kyonki ucch nyaayalay is prakaar ke pradesh ko bandhan ke anusaar simit aadhaar par jari karata he jaise samay
