 Pali was the language of the people of ancient North India
 jo purv main bihar se pashchim main haryana-rajasthan tak or uttar main nepal-uttarapradesh se dakshin main madhyapradesh tak boli jaati thi
 Lord Buddha also continued to explain the religion to the people while going around in these regions
 aaj inhi pradeshon main hindi boli jaati he
 Therefore, Pali is ancient Hindi
 yah hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar main kii ek boli yaa praakrit he
 It is also known as the language of Buddhist Tripitaka
 paali, brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main likhi jaati thi
 Regarding the etymology of the word Pali, there are many opinions of scholars
 kisi ne ise paath shabd se tathaa kisi ne pid se utpann karne kaa praytn kiya he
 Max Valeser, a German scholar, has expressed the opinion that he refers to the ancient language of Pataliputra by referring to Pali as an abbreviation for 'patali'
 in vyutpattiyon kii apeksha jin do maton kii ore vidwaanon kaa adhik jhukaav he, unamem se ek to he pan vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa mat, jiske anusaar pali, pankti shabd se vyutpann hua he
 This view is strongly supported by an ancient Pali dictionary, Abhidhanappadipika, because in these words Tanti, Buddhism, Panthi and Pali, Pali also clearly means the line
 purvokt do arthon main pali ke jo prayog milte hai, unki bhi is arth se sarthakata siddh ho jaati he
 The meaning of the line of Buddhavachana or the line of the text sits in the experiments of Buddhaghosha
 tathaapi dhvanivigyaan ke anusaar pankti shabd se pali kii vyutpatti nahin baithai ja sakati
 It seems more appropriate to relate the word to the word Pali, Paththa, Padu, which is prevalent in the meaning of the line
 pali shabd peeche sanskrit main bhi prachlit hua paaya jaataa he
 The derivation of Pali in the Abhidhanappadipika, "paleti Rakhtati Pali", has been stated in this way also supports this view
 kintu "pali mahavyakaran" ke karta bhikshu jagadish kashyap ne pali ko pankti ke arth main lene ke vishay main kuch aapattiyaan uthaai hai or use mul tripitak granthon main anek sthanon par prayukt 'pariyay' shabd se vyutpann batalaane kaa praytn kiya he
 According to the Magadhi tendency in place of the word 'dhammapariya' of Tripitaka in the Bhabru inscription of Emperor Ashoka, the use of the word 'dhamma Paliyya' is found, which means Buddha-sermon or word
 kashyap ji ke anusaar isi paliyaay sharan se pali kii vyutpatti hui
 No name of the language is found anywhere in the original Tripitaka
 kintu buddhaghosh aadi aacharyon ne buddha ke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko magadhi kaha he
 In Visuddhimagga and Mahavansa this Magadhi has been called the root language of all beings
 uske sthaan par pali shabd kaa prayog praaia: 14veen shatee i
 ke purv nahin paaya jaataa
 Yes, Buddhaghosha has used the word Pali in his biographies, but not in the sense of language, but in the meaning of the text of Buddhavakha or Moolatripitaka and that too often to make that text look different from the story
 is prakaar kahin unhone kaha he ki isaki pali is prakaar he, kintu atthkatha main aisa he, athwa yah baat na pali main he or na atthkatha main ai he
 The word Pali is found to be used in these two meanings in some of the Deepavans written before the time of Buddhaghosh and also in the later works of Mahavans etc
 isi arthprayog se kramash: pali shabd us sahitya tathaa uski bhashaa ke liye bhi kiya jane laga
 In terms of language, Pali is a form of that medieval Indian Aryan language, whose development was around BC
 Considered from the sixth century
 usase purv kii adiugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa swaroop vedon tathaa brahmanon, upanishdon evam ramayana, mahabharat aadi granthon main praapt hota he, jinhen 'vaidic bhashaa' evam 'sanskrit bhashaa' kehete hai
 The distinction of medieval languages is more prominent in the following things than Vedic language and Sanskrit: vyakaran kii drushti se These features are common features of the medieval Indian Aryan language and are found in the lingua franca of the country whose propagation lasted for some two thousand years from the said period and whose literature is also available
 ukt saamaanya lakshanon ke atirikt in bhashaaon main apane-apane desh or kaal kii apeksha naanaa bhed paae jate hai
 Their three levels are considered from the point of view of time - in sab yugon kii bhashaaon ko ek saamaanya naam praakrit diya gaya he
 Its first level is found in the form of languages in Ashoka's commendations and Pali literature
 dwitiya str kii bhashaaon main magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni evam maharashtri praakrit bhashaayen he jinka vipul sahitya uplabdh he
 The third level languages are named apabhransh and avahath
 deshbhed kii drushti se madhyakaalin bhashaaon ke bhed kaa sarvapracheen parichay maury samrat ashok kii dharmalipiyon main praapt hota he
 There are three distinct distinctions - Eastern, Western and Western
 purvi bhashaa kaa swaroop dhauli or jogarh kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 In these, the inflection of the nominative singular of the words l and Shakanta is well established
 praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne in pravritiyon ko magadhi praakrit ke vishesh lakshanon main ginaya he
 According to the grammaticalization, the third special feature of this Magadhi Prakrit is the use of Sh in place of the three hot colors
 kintu ashok ke ukt lekhon main yah pravriti nahin pai jaati, kyonki yahan teenon ooshmon ke sthaan par s hi prayukt hua he
 For this reason, it is more appropriate to call this eastern nature of Ashoka as Magadhi and not the ancient form of Ardhamagadhi
 pashchimi bhashaa bhed kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaalon main girnaar kii prashastiyaan hai
 Among them, the distinction between Su and l is safe
 ooshmon ke sthaan par s kaa prayog he tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan rup o main ant hota he
 It is clear from these trends that this language is an ancient form of Shaurseni
 pashchimottar kii bhashaa kaa rup shahbajgadhi or mansera kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 Often, these three hot colors are safe in their place
 kahin-kahin kuch vyatyay drushtigochar hota he
 Rakarayukta samyavarna also appears, and the use of Ranj is found in place of Jya and Nyya
 ye pravritiyaan us bhashaa ko pashachi praakrit kaa purv rup ingit karti hai
 Some part of Pali Tripitaka must have assumed literary form during the time of Ashoka as seven episodes of his Lahuloism, Monayyasutt etc
 are mentioned in his praise of Bhabru
 kintu uplabdh sahitya kii bhashaa main ashok ke purvi shilaalekh kii bhashaa sambandhi visheshtaon kaa praaia: sarvatha abhaav he
 Broadly, the form of Pali language most closely matches the language of the Girnar commendation, and for this reason Pali is not primarily east, but central
 jis visheshta ke kaaran pali madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke pratham str kii gini jaati he, dwitiya kii nahin, vah he usamen madhyavarti aghosh vyanjanon ke lop tathaa mahapraan varnon ke sthaan par h ke aadesh kaa abhaav
 These trends are common features of second-level languages
 haan, kahin kahin k t jaise aghosh varnon ke sthaan par g d aadi saghosh varnon kaa aadesh dikhaai detaa he
 But this one is only in a small quantity and the other is indicative of the relatively later trend within the said dignity of the first level
 pali bhashaa evam madhyakaalin bhartiya aryabhashaon ke sambandh main dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki yah bhashavikas jo sanskrit se mana jaataa he vah thik nahin
 In fact, since the Vedic period, the lingua franca, along with the literary language, has taken the form of literary natural languages according to the country and time
 pali bhi apni puri viraasat sanskrit se nahin le rahi, kyonki usamen anke shabdarup aise paae jate hai jiskaa mail sanskrit se nahin, kintu vedon kii bhashaa se baithta he
 For example, in Pali and other Prakrit, forms like Deverbhi, Devehi, of Tritiya plural are found
 acarant sangyaaon ke aise roopon kaa sanskrit main sarvatha abhaav he, kintu vaidic main deverbhi, utana hi suprachilit he jitna devai:
 Therefore, the tradition of the above form can be considered as originating from the Vedic language in Pali and Prakrit
 usee prakaar pali main 'yamamase', 'maasre', 'kaatve' aadi anek rup aise hai jinke pratyay sanskrit main paae hi nahin jate, kintu vaidic bhashaa main vidyaman hai
 Literature written in Prakrit is not available before Pali texts and Ashoka's commendations and Prakrit grammars have done grammatical analysis of Prakrit language by considering Sanskrit as Prakriti for their convenience and hence the confusion has arisen that Prakrit languages originated in Sanskrit
 resulted from
 pali ke kacchan, moggallan aadi vyakaranon main yah dosha nahin paaya jaataa, kyonki vahaan bhashaa kaa varnan sanskrit ko prakruti maanak nahin kiya gaya
 Pali words are given below like some key words

 Narsi occupies almost the same place as Surdas in Hindi in Gujarati literature as Padpanrata
 vaishnav jan to taine kahie je peed paraai jaane re' pankti se aarambh honevaala suvikhyath pad narsi mehta kaa hi he
 Narsi, by compiling the essence of Vaishnavism in it, has introduced his insight and innate humanism
 narsi kii is udaar vaishnav bhakthi kaa prabhaav gujarat main aaj tak lakshith hota he
 In Pushtimarga, Narsi is considered "brides" but Narsi does not seem to be associated with any sect
 unki bhakthi bhagavatashrith thi
 Krishna's Raslila was a special favorite of Narsi as compared to the other Leelas, and he described himself participating in Raas by becoming "divitio" or Deepwakah in a situation of emotional identification
 ve gujarat ke sarvaadhik lokapri vaishnav kavi hai tathaa lokkalpana main unke jivan se sambhddha kinvadantiyon evam chamatkaarik ghatnaon ke prati sahaj vishwasabhaavna milti he

 After marriage, two children named Kunwar Bai and Shamaldas were born to wife Manikbai
 krishnabhakt hone se purv unke shaiva hone ke pramaan milte hai
 It is said that it was due to the blessings of Mahadev "gopinath" that he saw Krishna Lila who turned his life in a completely new direction
 grihasth jivan main chamatkaarik rup se apane aradhy kii ore se sahaayta praapt hone ke anek varnan unki aatmcharitaparak kai rachanaaon main uplabdh hote hai
 Similarly, God helped Narasila many times
 inamen "hundi", "jhaari", "mameru" or "haar" kaa prasang sarvapramukh he
 The "dheed" episode also holds a significant importance in the biography of Narsi, as a result of which she was socially boycotted
 ve stri or shudra ko bhakthi kaa adhikari samajhate the jiske kaaran samast nagar jati unase kshubdh ho gai thi
 Narsi did not let her intuition get frustrated with external influences

 At the request of Narasimhaji, Lord Shiva took you to show Ras Leela in Vrindavan
 aap raas lila dekhte hue itane kho gaye kii mashaal se apana haath jala bethe
 Lord Krishna raised his hand as before with his touch and blessed Narasimha Ji

 a village appeared at some distance
 us gaanv ke kuch log in donon ke paas aaye or kaha kii agar aap kahen to ham aap ke liye khaanaa le aate hai, par lekin ham shudra jaati ke hai
 Narasimha Ji told them that all are children of God, you are the people of Hari, i have no problem in eating your food
 narsingh ne khushi se bhojan khaaya lekin unke bhai ne bhojan khaane se inkaar car diya
 Before walking, when Narasimha woke up to thank the villagers, he could not see the village anywhere

 Once some sadhus going to Dwarka came to Narasimha ji and gave them five hundred rupees and said that you are very famous person, you should write a bill of five hundred rupees in your name and we will go to Dwarka and take the bill
 pehle to narsingh ji ne manaa karte hue kaha kii main to garib aadmi hoon, mere pahchaan kaa koi seth nahin jo tumhe dwarka main hundi de degaa, par jab sadhu nahin maane to unhon ne kaagaj laa kar paanch sau rupaye kii hundi dwarka main dene ke liye likh di or dene vaale kaa naam saanwal shah likh diya
 On reaching Dwarka city, the saints searched everywhere but Samwal Shah was not found anywhere
 sab kehane lage kii ab yah hundi tum narsila se hi lenaa
 On the other hand, Narasimha ji started bringing in the goods of those five hundred rupees
 jab sara bhandara ho gaaya to ant main ek vruddh sant bhojan ke liye aae
 Narasimha ji's wife made all the utensils which were empty and four loaves of flour which were left and fed them to that old saint
 jaise hi us sant ne roti khai vaise hi udhar dwarka main bhagwaan ne saanwal shah ke rup main pragat ho kar santon ko hundi de di
 Acharya ji also gives evidence of this in the small aarti of Anandev

 And in the Bharu Chowk gave sands of money to the saints

 Mysticism is the emotional expression in which a person or creation expresses their love with that supernatural, ultimate, latent entity; He wants to be immersed in that supernatural element
 And the person who experiences this extreme bliss, then he has a lot of difficulty in expressing it in the external world
 Cosmic language, things cannot express that joy
 Therefore, he has to resort to symbols to express the ecological joy, which becomes a mystery to the general public
 Mysticism in Hindi literature first appears in the medieval period
 Mysticism has been used here in Kabir in the saint or Nirgun Kavadhara, in the lovemaking or in Sufi poetry
 Both want to connect with the ultimate authority and get absorbed in it, through Kabir Yoga, through their love of love; hence Kabir's mysticism is introverted and sadistic mysticism; aadhunik kaal main bhi chhayavaad main rahasyavaad dikhaai padataa he | mahadevi verma ke kavy main rahasyavaad kii paryaaptta he ; lekin aadhunik kaal main rahasyavaad us amoort, alokik yaa param satta se judane kii chahat ke kaaran nahin utpann hua apitu yah loukik prem main aa rahi baadhaon kii vajah se utpann hua he |mahadevi or niraala main aadhyatmik prem kaa maarmik ankan miltaa he

 a laser is a device that emits light through a process of induced emission
 lager shabd prakaash pravardhan kaa prerit utsarjan ke dwaara vikiran kaa sankshipt shabd he
 Laser light is usually celestially powerful, which means that the light will either emit a narrow, low-flow beam, or be unified with the help of viewing devices such as lens lenses
 aamtaur par, lager kaa arth sankare tarangadairdhya prakashpunj se nikalne vaale prakaash se lagaaya jaataa he
 This meaning is not true for all lasers, although some lasers emit light like a wide photosphere, while some emit light simultaneously at a variety of specific wavelengths

 laabh madhyam aise gunon vaala padaarth hota he jo prerit utsarjan ke dwaara prakaash pravardhan kii anumati detaa he
 In its simplest form, an orifice consists of an arrangement of two mirrors in which the light bounces back and forth each time it passes through the gain medium

 It can occur at any state: gas, liquid, solid, or plasmas
 This gain absorbs the energy that is added to the medium, which increases some electrons to higher energy ")
 Quantum state I

 By itself, it makes an optical amplifier
 When an optical amplifier is placed inside a sympathetic radial cavity, it receives a laser

 The pore hole, a type of orifice resonator, consists of a coherent beam of light between the reflective surfaces so that the light gains pass through the medium more than once before the output is emitted from the orifice or lost in refraction or absorption
 The medium passes through the cavity, if the gain in the medium is stronger than the loss in resonance, the power of this diffuse light तीव्र There is a rapid increase
 But every induced emission event shifts the particle from the excited state to the cool state while decreasing the capacity of the gain medium for further amplification
 When this effect becomes stronger, the gain is assumed to be full
 Is
 The gain creates a balance between the balance of the pump power against the saturated and the reduced power present in the hole through the depletion of the hole; This balance establishes a center of laser power
 yadi chuni gai pump shkt bahut choti he, to pratidhwani ghate se ubarne main laabh paryaapt nahin hoga or lager bahut kam prakaash shakt utsarjit karegaa
 The minimum power required to initiate laser action is called the initial limit for laser emitting

 The light in the hole and the light emitted into the laser, if they originate in the free space and not in waveform directors such as the laser), are best at low levels
 gaussian prakaash haalanki aisa shaktishaalee lezaron ke maamle main kam hi hota he
 If the beam is not of a low-level Gaussian shape, the transverse method of light can be interpreted as the hermite-gaussian or laguerre-gaussian beam of extreme state
 Can be described
 On the other hand, unsteady resonance lasers reflect the output of the size of the pieces
 yah kiran ucch str kasanghanik ho saktaa he, yah bina jhukaav ke samanaantar hota he
 However, due to an absolutely condensed ray refraction, it cannot be created
 This ray is condensed to a distance that varies according to the square of the diameter of the beam and which is finally bent at an angle that is opposite to the diameter of the beam
 Thus, light produced by a small laser laboratory, such as a helium-neon laser, spreads to a diameter of 1
6 km if the Earth is lunar As shown, in comparison, the product of a typical semiconductor laser, due to its small diameter, tends to tilt as soon as it exits the hole, at any angle up to 50 °
 However, this Such tilted rays can be converted into condensed rays through a lens
 Conversely, rays from nonlaser light sources cannot also be carried by condensed optics

 These pulses are separated primarily in time such that a pulsing resonator completes a round circle in the orifice
 The Fourier limit
 Also known as the cause of), a pulsation of such short length consists of a beam that covers a wide range of wavelengths
 Because of this, there should be a substantial benefit profile of the laser medium in order to amplify all of them

4 wavelengths are often described as "safe for the eye"
 This is due to the intrinsic molecular vibrations of water that strongly absorb the light of this part of the spectrum and at this wavelength the laser light is completely It is found that there is no light focusing on the retina and the lens emanating from the cornea of the eyes
 The label "eye safe" is misleading
 Maybe, though, because it is only relatively low power is applied to the continuous wave and any high power or beam Q-switched can burn laser cornea at these wavelengths

 Eye contact with the laser The type, character, and duration of damage to the laser is comparable to the strength of the laser, wavelength, intensity of light, origin of light, and There is a difference in power
 a laser of a fraction of a watt in power can cause complete damage to the eyes in some circumstances, such lasers become less lethal but dangerous weapons
 Laser blindness is highly handicapped and less dangerous than a weapon
 Also, the use of laser makes it morally controversial

 Bajirao II was the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire from 1796 to 1818
 inke samay main maratha samrajya kaa patan hona shuru hua
 During his reign, conflict with the British began
 bajirao dwitiya aathvaan or antim peshwa tha
 He was the son of Raghunathrao
 apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se bajirao dwitiya sadaa nafrat karata rahaa
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, he himself wanted to take charge of the Maratha Empire
 bajirao dwitiya ek kaayar or vishwasghaatee vyakti tha, jisane angrezon kii sahaayta praapt karke peshwa kaa pad praapt kiya tha
 But even with the British, he was not proved to be true
 uski dhokhebaazi or beimaani ke kaaran angrezon ne use bandi banaakar bithur bhej diya, jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Bajirao II befriended the British and with his help received the post of 'peshwa' and gave many Maratha territories to the British for that
 bajirao dwitiya swaarthee or ayogy shaasha tha tathaa mahattvakankshi hone ke kaaran apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se irshyaa karata tha
 Fadnavis died in 1800 AD and Bajirao himself became anxious to take power
 lekin vah sainik gunon se rahit or vyaktigat rup se kaayar tha or samajhataa tha, ki keval chal kapat se hi apane lakshya ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, there was rivalry between Daulatrao Shinde and Jaswantrao Holkar for his vacant post
 bajirao dwitiya chal kapat se in donon ko hi apane niyantran main rakhana chahta tha, jisase maamla or ulajh gaya
 Shinde and Holkar started a war outside the gates of Poona to take the Peshwa under their control
 bajirao dwitiya ne shinde kaa saath diya, lekin holkar kii sena ne un donon kii sanyukt sena ko parajeet kar diya
 The frightened Peshwa Bajirao II fled to Basai in 1801 and took refuge in the British and signed Basai's treaty on 31 December 1802 on an English ship
 iske dwaara usne east india company kaa ashrith hona sweekaar kar liya
 The British pledged to re-incarnate Bajirao II in the capital Poona and to protect the Peshwa, he took the responsibility of having sufficient army in the state
 iske badale main peshwa ne company ko itnaa maratha kshetra dena sweekaar kar liya, jisase company kii sena kaa kharch nikal aae
 He also promised that he would not hire people from other European countries who had enmity with the British
 is prakaar bajirao dwitiya ne apni raksha ke liye angrezon ke haath apni swatantraaa bech di
 The Maratha chieftains expressed their indignation towards the treaty of Basai, as they felt that the Peshwa had sold all their freedoms due to their queerness
 at: un logon ne is aapattijanak sandhi ko samaapt karaane ke liye yuddh kii taiyaari kii
 This resulted in the Second anglo-maratha War, in which the British won and established their sovereignty over the Maratha territories
 sandhi ke dwaara lagaaye gayi pratibandh peshwa bajirao ko achche nahin lage
 He took advantage of the resentment and discontent prevailing among the Maratha chieftains and re-organized them against the British
 navambar 1817 main bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main sangathit maratha sena ne puna kii 'angrezi residensi' ko lootakar jala diya or khadki sthiti angrezi sena par hamalaa kar diya, lekin vah parajeet ho gaya
 Subsequently, he fought two more battles - Bhima Koregaon in 1 January 1818, in which the British defeated 27,000 Maratha soldiers of Peshwa by his army, which was less than the number of Marathas, including 500 Mahar soldiers
 Later defeated in the battle of Ashti
 usne bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin 3 june, 1818 i
 ko use angrezon ke saamne aatmasamarpan karnaa padaa
 The British abolished the post of Peshwa this time and overpowered Bajirao II and sent him as a prisoner to Bithoor near Kanpur where he died in 1853 AD
 maraathon kii swatantraaa nasht karne ke liye bajirao dwitiya sabase adhik jimmedaar tha
