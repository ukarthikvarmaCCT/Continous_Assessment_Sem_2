 On 14 August 1947, India split and Pakistan was born in a new country in the east and west
 pakistan ke kaayade aazam mohammad ali jinnah kaa sapana saakaar hua
 With the formation of a new country, the work of choosing different symbols and symbols for the country also started
 desh kaa jhanda pehle hi taiyaar ho chukaa tha, lekin raashtra-geet nahi bana tha
 At the time of independence, Pakistan had no national anthem
 isliye jab bhi dhvaj vandan hota " pakistan jindabad, azaadi pindabad" ke naare lagate the
 Jinnah did not accept this
 ve chaahate the ki pakistan ke raashtra-geet ko rachane kaa kaam sheeghra hi puraa karnaa chahie
 His advice cars suggested him the names of many famous Urdu poets who could have composed the song
 lekin jinnah kii soch kuch ore hi thi
 He felt that this is a good chance to establish the secular image of Pakistan before the world
 isliye unhone lahore ke mahanaurdu shaayar or mul hindu jagannatha azaad ko kaha ki "main aapako paanch din kaa hi samay de saktaa hu, aap pakistan ke liye raashtra-geet likhen"
 Jagannath Azad was also surprised and happy
 lekin pakistan ke kattarpanthi netaa isse bahut naaraaz hue ki ek hindu pakistan kaa raashtra-geet likhegaa
 But they were helpless before Jinnah's wish
 akhirkaar jagannatha azaad ne paanch dinon ke andar raashtra-geet taiyaar kar liya jo jinnah ko bahut pasand aayaa
 The lyrics were - i sarazami e pakjarre tere hai ajasitaro se tabanakaroshan he kehkashan se kahinaj teri khaak Jinnah recognized it as a national song and the song remained a national song till his death
 lekin is geet kii sweekruti ke mahaz 18 maheene baad hi jinnah kaa dehanth ho gaya or unke saath hi raashtra-geet kii manyata bhi khatm kar di gai
 Jagannath Azad later moved to India
 jinnah kii mrityu ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne ek raashtra-geet cameti banaai
 And asked for song samples from well-known poets
 lekin koi bhi geet raashtra-geet ke laayak nahi ban paa rahaa tha
 Finally, the government of Pakistan recognized the tune composed by Ahmed Chagla in 1950 as a national tune
 usee samay iran ke shah pakistan kii yatra par aae or unhone dhun ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 This tune seemed more westernized, but the rashtra-geet Committee believed that its form would be more accepted in Western society

 Dhruva means 'fixed'
 dhruvit tarang main kisi simit rup main hi dolan hote hai jabaki adhruvit tarang main sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dolan hota he
 The moving sound waves in a gas or liquid do not exhibit the properties of polarization because they have the same direction of motion and the direction of oscillation
 saadhaaran prakaash kii kiran sancharandisha ke saapeksh samamit hoti he, kintu vishesh avasthaaon main usamen asamamiti athwa ekapaksheeyata kaa gun utpann ho jaataa he
 This can be easily evidenced by a green natural crystal plaque called tourmaline
 jab saadhaaran prakaash is pattica main hokar nikalataa he, tab to pattica ke kiran ke aksh par ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main koi parivartan nahin hota, kintu jab taramaileen main se nikali hui yah kiran tourmaileen kii waisi hi duusari pattica ko ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main bahut adhik parivartan hota he
 The intensity is maximum when the axes of both tourmalines are parallel
 jyon-jyon in akshon ke bich kaa kone badhata jaataa he tyon-tyon tivrata ghatati jaati he or jab vah samakon ke baraabar ho jaataa he tab tivrata kaa maan shunya ho jaataa he
 It is clear that ascending from the first tourmaline, the light has produced such an asymmetry property that was not in ordinary light
 is gun kaa naam "dhruvan" he or is gunayukta prakaash ko "dhruvit" kehete hai
 From this point of view, ordinary light is called "overflow"
 vyatikaran tathaa vivartan kii ghatnaon ke dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki dhwani kii tarah hi prakaash kaa sancharan bhi tarangon ke rup main hota he or is sancharan ke liye madhyam ke rup main ether naamak ek padaarth kii kalpana bhi kar lee gai he
 The above phenomenon of polarization proves that light waves are not as longitudinal as sound waves, as the above type of asymmetry is not possible due to the direction of vibration transmission in longitudinal waves
 at: prakaash tarangen anuprastha hoti hai, arthath unke kampan sitar ke taar ke companon kii tarah tarangasancharan se samakonik disha main hote hai
 It is not necessary that the vibrational path of the particle of the medium in the transverse wave is simply linear
 aavashyak itnaa hi he ki kampanpath us samtal main avasthit rahe jisapar tarangasancharan kii disha abhilamb rup ho
 Therefore, the shape of this vibrator can be elliptical and circular in special cases
 jis tarang main kampan kii akruti or yadi kampan saral rekhaatmak ho to uski disha, aparivartin rahati he, use dhruvit tarang kehete hai or jisamen yah akruti yaa disha badalati rahati he use adhruvit kehete hai
 In this view, polarized light can be of the following three types: 1
 samtal dhruvit 2
 Ellipse Polarized 3
 vrutt dhruvit 
 It is known from mathematical studies that these different shapes of vibrations are obtained by combining two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 vipareetat: kampan kii akruti jo bhi ho, uske vighatan se do samakonik saral aavart kampan praapt ho sakate hai
 When the light enters a transparent crystal, such vibrations of its vibrations take place directly and two flat polar rays appear in the crystal
 inke kampan paraspar samakonik hote hai
 Generally they move in different directions and their velocities are not equal
 is ghatana kaa naam dwivartan he or isi ke dwaara higenz ne san 1960 main dhruvan kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 One of these two rays is absorbed into the crystal of tourmaline
 tourmaileen ke dwaara dhruvit prakaash kii utpatti kaa yahi kaaran he
 The direction of vibrations of this light depends on the direction of the crystalline axis of the tourmaline plate and rotating that plate also changes the direction of the vibrations
 kintu saadhaaran adhruvit prakaash main companon kii akruti athwa dish kshan-kshan main nirantar badalati rahati he, at: jab vah tourmaileen main se nikalataa he tab dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata bhi badalati to rahati he parantu uskaa ausat maan tourmaileen kii prayek sthiti main baraabar rahata he or yahi hamen dikhaai detaa he
 But when flat polarized light, which has amplitude, passes through the tourmaline, it remains polarized, but its amplitude decreases, where is the pointer angle of the position of the tourmaline
 q = 0 tab samajha jaataa he jab aayam mahattam hota he
 When q = 90 °, the amplitude becomes a = 0 and the transmitted light is lost, no matter how large the amplitude value of the incident light
 dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash ko bhi tourmaileen samtal dhruvit to kar detaa he or uski tivrata bhi tourmaileen ko ghumaane se badhati he, kintu uskaa purnat: lop kabhi nahin hota
 The reason for this is that this type of incident light consists of two components of mutually right, but different dimensions, and when one element is greatest in the case of q = 0, the other is lost and q = 90 degrees
 When the first dimension is omitted, the second dimension becomes the maximum
 vrutt dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata main tourmaileen kuch bhi parivartan nahin kar saktaa, kyonki iske donon avyav companon ke aayam baraabar hote hai arthath 
 Hence, it also has the property of symmetry like unfiltered light
 phir bhi yah dhruvit prakaash he
 The trick to identify it will be explained further
 isamen kampan saral rekhaatmak hote hai or unki disha achar rahati he
 Hence, it is also called line polarization
 samtal dhruvit naam kaa kaaran yah hai ki aise prakaash kii kiran ke samast vinduon ke kampan ek hi samtal main hote hai
 Other measures to generate flat polarized light are as follows: 1
 nikal prism - kailcite jaise crystal main vivartan to hota hai, kintu donon paraspar lambat: samtal dhruvit kirane itane paas-paas hoti hai ki unamem se keval ek ko praapt karnaa kathin he
 But the two prisms cut from the calcite special tip are connected to the Canadian balsam to form a parallel fruit prism, known as nickel prism
 isamen pravesh kar canada baalsam par pahunchne par ek kiran to purnat: paravartit hokar parshv main chali jaati he or vahaan nasht ho jaati he, kintu duusari kiran sidhi chalakar baahar nikalati he
 This prism is good transparent
 at: isse praapt samtal, dhruvit prakaash aaptit prakaash ke hi rang kaa hota he
 2
 Polaroid - In this, microscopic crystals of a mineral called hierapathite are deposited in a parallel position between the two planks of the celluloid in a special way, so that they can all work together to form one long broad crystal
 yah tourmaileen ke samaan hi samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann kar detaa he
 This is called a polyroid
 iske bahut lambey chaude takhte banaae ja sakate hai
 This color is light green
 san 1941 main isse bhi acchhee ek or yukti nikaal lee gai, jisase polivinil alcohol ke anuon ko samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he
 This is called polyuroid-h
 isamen jaraa bhi rang nahin hota or 99
99 pratishat prakaash dhruvit ho jaataa he
 3
 Reflection - In 1810, Malus testified that the properties of polarization are found partially in the reflected light from the surface of a transparent material such as water or glass, and it becomes perfectly flat when the incidence angle is of particular value
 
 is aapatan kone ko "dhruvak kone" kehete hai
 According to Brewster's rule, if the polar angle is i and the reflector of the reflective material is m, then sp

 patticganj - yadhyapi kaach kii pattica se dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash purnat: dhruvit hota he, tathaapi us main se pargamit prakaash kabhi bhi purnat: dhruvit nahin hota, vah keval anshat: dhruvit hota he, kintu uttarottar anek patticoon main se pargamit prakaash kaa dhruvan uttarottar badhata jaataa he or patticoon kii sankhya paryaapt ho jane par vah lagbhag purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 Such a group of many thin strips is called pattikapunj
 5
 prakirnan - jab prakaash kisi paardarshee madhyam main upasthit atyant chote-chote kanon par padataa he tab un kanon se prakirnit hokar chaaron ore failanevaala prakaash bhi saamanyat: anshadhruvit hota he
 But the light which is radiated in a right-angled direction from the primary ray is perfectly flat
 yah baat akaash ke nile prakaash main dekhi ja sakati he, jo vaayu ke anuon dwaara prakirnit surya kaa prakaash hi he
 Just as it is used to find out whether a light plane is polar or not and which is its polar surface, tourmaline is used, in the same way all the above mentioned means of generating polarization were also used for this purpose
 can go
 ise utpann karne kaa upaay yah he ki samtal dhruvit prakaash ko kisi dwivartak crystal, yatha abhrak kii pattica, par abhilambat: daalaa jaataa he
 This causes right-angled polar rays of two different dimensions to move in the crystal on the same path at different velocities
 usamen se duusari ore nikalne par in donon kirnon main kuch kalantar utpann ho jaataa he or donon ke sangyojan se dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash praapt ho jaataa he
 If the thickness of the crystal plaque is such that the time interval reaches 90 degrees, then the plate is called the quadrant wave plate
 is pattica ko ghumaane se ek kiran kaa aayam badhata he or duusari kaa ghatata he
 In the case where the two dimensions are equal, the transmitted light becomes circled
 aise dhruvanon kii pahchaan ke liye bhi chaturthaansh tarangapattica kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This decomposes the ellipsoidal or circular vibrations into two right-angled simple linear vibrations, and by rotating the fillet to the proper position, it reduces or increases their time point to 0 ° or 180 °
 at: pargamit prakaash pun: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he, jisaki pahchaan tourmaileen yaa nikal ke dwaara ho sakati he
 Flat polarized light cannot be obtained by this action from fractionated or depolarized light, because the fractionated light is a mixture of polar and flat polarized light and the tourmaline gate of the depolarized light can never be omitted
 samtal dhruvit prakaash main companon kii disha kaa gyaan hone kaa karna is disha kaa saket dene ke liye ek dhruvanatal kii kalpana kii gai thi or uski paribhaasha yon di gai thi : paravartan dwaara praapt purnat: samtal dhruvit kiran kaa dhruvanatal uskaa aayaat tal hota he
 Therefore, in the event of a tourmaline in which the intensity of this reflected ray is destroyed, a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate
 usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he or tab aise tourmaileen se kisi bhi dhruvit prakaash kaa dhruvanatal maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 The simplest way to know this is to move a thin beam of polarized light flattened in a dark room in a vertical direction
 kiran kaa maarg adrishy hi rahegaa, kintu yadi bahut patale kanon kaa dhunaa, kaagaj ko jalaakar, is kiran ke nikat utpann kiya jaae to un kanon se prakirnit prakaash ke kaaran kiran kaa maarg dikhaai dene lagegaa
 But by looking around, the ray will remain invisible in one particular direction
 spashtat: is disha main prakirnan nahin hota
 Thus, this is the direction of vibration, because the transverse wave cannot move in the direction of vibration
 is upaay se gyaat ho gaya he ki kampan kii disha dhruvan tal se samakonik hoti he, arthath dhruvak kone par paravartit kiran ke kampan apaat tal se samakonik hote hai
 The same thing has been proved by other measures
 prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke anusar prayek kiran main vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey donon prakaar ke kampan hote hai or ye paraspapar samakonik bhi hote hai
 This theory also shows that the electrical vibrations in the reflected light at the polar angle are equidistant from the emergency
 at: isse yah parinaam nikalataa he ki netron ko prabhavit karanevaale prakaash ke kampan vaidyut hai, chumbakeey nahin
 In light reflected at the polar angle, the vibrations of the vibrations are right-angled from the emergency plane, which obviously means that if the vibrations of the incident ray are in the emergency plane, its reflection will not be exactly at the polar angle
 at: jab aapatan kone dhruvak kone ke baraabar ho tab apattal main dhruvit prakaash kaa to paravartan ho saktaa he, kintu apattal se samakonat: dhruvit prakaash kaa paravartan nahin ho saktaa
 In geometry, it is necessary that the intensity of light can be reduced at will and also we can know accurately what is the ratio between this reduced intensity and the preceding intensity
 iske liye do nikal prismon kaa upyog kiya jaat he
 When both are in parallel phase, the intensity of the light passing through both of them progressively becomes the greatest, but if there is an angle between the positions of both, then the intensity decreases in proportion
 polaroid kaa bhi is kaary ke liye upyog kiy ja saktaa he
 The loam is a type of soil that is very fertile for crops)
 isamen lagbhag 40% silt, 20% chikani mitti tathaa shesh 40% baaluu hota he
 The fertility of crops is high due to penetration of water and air, which means more holes
 aisi mitti apane kul bhaar kaa 50% pani rokane kii kshamta rakhti he
 The amount of nutrients in this soil is also high

 Abhigyan Shakuntalam is a world-famous drama by Mahakavi Kalidas, which has been translated into almost all foreign languages
 isamen raja dushyant tathaa shakuntala ke pranay, vivaah, virah, pratyaakhyaan tathaa punarmilan kii ek sundar kahani he
 In the legend, Dushyant is realized by Akashvani, but in this drama the poet has made it known by Mudrika
 isaki naatakeeyata, iske sundar cathopakathan, isaki kavy-saundarya se bhari upmaayen or sthaan-sthaan par prayukt hui samyochit sukhtiyaan; or in sabase badhkar vividh prasangon kii dhvanyaatmakataa itani adbhut he ki in drushtiyon se dekhne par sanskrit ke bhi anya naatak abhigyaan shaakuntal se takkar nahin le sakate; phir anya bhashaaon kaa to kahana hi kya ! to yaheen sabase zyada acha he
 Kalidas did not choose Abhigyan Shakuntal's story as original
 yah katha mahabharat ke adiparv se lee gai he
 Thus the story of Shakuntala is also found in Padmapuran and it is more close to the story of Shakuntala than Mahabharata
 is kaaran vinternitz ne yah mana he ki shakuntala kii katha padmapurana se lee gai he
 But scholars have said that this part of Padmapurana was written after the creation of Shakuntala and later appears projectile
 mahabharat kii katha main durvasa ke shaap kaa ullekh nahin he
 The Mahabharata is very different from Dushyant, if not exactly the opposite
 mahabharat kii shakuntala bhi kalidas kii bhaanti salajj nahin he
 She narrates the story of her birth to Dushyant as a result of Vishwamitra and Maneka's relationship with her mouth
 mahabharat main dushyant shakuntala ke rup par mugdh hokar shakuntala se gandharv vivaah kii prarthana karata he; jis par shakuntala kahati he ki main vivaah is shart par kar sakati hum ki rajsinghaasana mere putr ko hi mili
 Dushyant at that time accepts and later returns to his capital and does not deliberately accept the shameful Shakuntala
 kalidas ne is prakaar aprishkrut rup main praapt hui katha ko apni kalpana se adbhut rup main nikhaar diya he
 By imagining the curse of Durvasa, he elevated the character of Dushyanta
 kalidas kii shakuntala bhi abhijatya, saundarya or karunaa kii murti he
 Apart from this, the manner in which Kalidas has performed the whole story, portraying emotions, etc
 is original and unique
 shakuntla raja dushyant kii patni thi jo bharat ke suprasiddh raja bharat kii mata or menka apsara kii kanya thi
 It is written in the Mahabharata that Shankutla was born from the womb of Maneka Apsara, who left it in the forest
 van main shankuton aadi ne hinsak pashuon se isaki raksha kii thi, isi se iskaa naam shakuntla padaa
 Kanva Rishi brought it out of the forest and kept it like a girl, keeping it in her ashram
 ek baar raja dushyant apane saath kuch sainikon ko lekar shikaar khilne nikle or ghoomte phirte kanv rishi ke ashram main pahunche
 The sage was not present there at that time; With this, the young woman Shakuntala welcomed King Dushyant
 usee avasar par donon main prem or phir gandharva vivaah ho gaya
 a few days later King Dushyant left his kingdom from there
 kanv muni jab lautakar aae, tab yah jaanakar bahut prasann hue ki shakuntla kaa vivaah dushyant se ho gaya
 Shakuntala was pregnant at that time
 samay paakar uske garbh se bahut hi balvan or tejasvi putr utpann hua, jiskaa naam 'bharat' rakhaa gaya
 It is said that the name 'bharat' was named after 'bharat'
 kuch dinon baad shakuntla apane putr ko lekar dushyant ke darbar main pahaunchi
 But Shakuntala had got the curse of Durvasa Rishi in the middle
 raja ne ise bilkul nahin pahachaanaa or spasht kah diya ki na to main tumhen jaanata hoon or na tumhen apane yahan aashray de saktaa hoon
 But on this occasion there was an All India Radio, which informed the king that this is my wife and this son is also mine
 unhen kanv muni ke ashram kii sab baaten samaran ho ain or unhone shakuntla ko apni pradhan rani banaakar apane yahan rakh liya
 'abhigyan Shakuntalam' mentions many touching episodes
 ek us samay, jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa pratham milan hota he
 Secondly, when Kanva leaves Shakuntala from her ashram for her husband's house
 us samay to swayan rishi kehete hai ki mere jaise rishi ko apni paalita kanya main yah moh he to jinaki oras putriyaan patigrih ke liye vidaa hoti hai us samay unki kya sthiti hoti hogi
 The third episode is Shakuntala's presence at Dushyant's meeting and Dushyant's refusal to recognize her
 chauthaa prasang he us samay kaa, jab machuaare ko praapt dushyant ke naam vaali anguthi usko dikhaai jaati he
 And the fifth episode of the union of dushyant-shakuntala in the ashram of Maarishi Maharishi
 shakuntala main kalidas kaa sabase bada chamatkaar uske dhvanyatmak sanketon main he
 In this, the poet has had a unique success in that he did not use any object anywhere
 koi bhi paatr, koi bhi cathope-kathan, koi bhi ghatana, koi bhi prakritik drishy nishprayojan nahin he
 All the events give a miraculous indication of the events ahead
 naatak ke prarambh main hi greeshm-varnan karte hue van-vaayu ke patal kii sugandhi se milakar sugandhit ho uthne or chaaya main letate hi neend aane lagane or diwas kaa ant romantic hone ke dwaara naatak kii katha-vastu kii mote taur par soochna de di gai he, jo kramshah pehle shakuntala or dushyant ke milan, uske baad neend-prabhaav se shakuntala ko bhul jane or naatak kaa ant sukhad hone kii suchak he
 Similarly, the initial song of the play by the illusors kissing the flowers of Shirish a little bit indicates that Dushyant and Shakuntala's union would be short-lived
 jab raja dhanush par baan chadaaye harin ke peeche daude ja rahe hai, tabhi kuch tapasvi aakar rokte hai
 It is said - 'maharaj' this is the stag of the ashram, do not shoot arrows at it
 ’ yahaan harin ke atirikt shakuntala kii ore bhi sanket he, jo harin ke samaan hi bholi-bhali or asahaay he
 'whereas the very fickle life of the stag and the hard arrow like your thunderbolt!' It also has a poignant indication of Shakuntala's helplessness and simplicity and the ruthlessness of the king
 jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa prem kuch or badhane lagata he, tabhi nepathy se pukaar sunai padati he ki ‘tapasviyo, ashram ke praaniyon kii raksha ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 The hunter king Dushyant has come here
 ’ isamen bhi dushyant ke haathon se shakuntala kii raksha kii ore sanket kiya gaya prathit hota he, parantu yah sanket kisi ke bhi kaan main sunai nahin diya; shakuntala ko kisi ne nahin bachaaya
 This increases the compassion of the situation even more
 chauthe ank ke praarambhik bhaag main kanv ke shishy ne prabhaat kaa varnan karte hue sukh or dukh ke nirantar saath lage rahane kaa tathaa priy ke viyog main striyon ke asay dukh kaa jo ullekh kiya he, vah dushyant dwaara shakuntala kaa parityag kiye jane ke liye pehle se hi prishthbhumi-si bana detaa he
 In the fifth issue, Rani Hanspadika sings a song, in which the king is praised for his sweet-heartedness
 dushyant bhi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone hansapadika se ek hi baar prem kiya he
 This gives the poet a serious indication that even though Shakuntala was forgotten by Dushyant because of Durvasa's curse, it was not new for him to ignore the queens once they were in love
 anya raniyaan bhi uski is madhukar-vritti kaa shikaar thim
 The incident of Shakuntala's abandonment seems even more cruel and harsh in the backdrop of this song from Hansapadika
 isi prakaar ke dhvanyatmak sanketon se kalidas ne saatven ank main dushyant, shakuntala or uske putr ke milane ke liye sukhad prishthbhumi taiyaar kar di he
 Indra King confers uncommon respect to Dushyant
 uske baad hemkut parvat par prajapati ke ashram main pahunchate hi raja ko anubhav hone lagata he ki jaise vah amrit ke sarovar main snaan kar rahe hon
 After such signs, the union of Dushyant and Shakuntala becomes even more delightful
 german kavi gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalan ke bare main kaha tha- Similarly, this verse is famous among Sanskrit scholars- iskaa arth he - kavy ke jitne bhi prakaar hai unamem naatak vishesh sundar hota he
 In plays also, Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top in terms of poetry
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 His fourth verse in Abhigyan Shakuntalam and fourth verse in this issue is very delightful
 abhigyaan shaakuntal main naatakeeyata ke saath-saath kavy kaa ansh bhi yathesht maatra main he
 Shringar is the main juice in it; And its coincidence and disconnection have matured beautifully on both sides
 iske atirikt hasya, vir tathaa karun ras kii bhi jahaan-tahaan acchhee abhivyakti hui he
 Beautiful and enchanting expectations from place to place not only amazes the reader, but also helps in increasing the intensity of the desired emotion
 saare naatak main kalidas ne apni upamaaon or utprekshaon kaa upyog kahin bhi keval alankaar-pradarshan ke liye nahin kiya
 Their simile or catalysis at each place has helped in making the expression of meaning juicy
 kalidas apni upamaaon ke liye sanskrit-sahitya main prasiddh hai
 In Shakuntal too, his power to choose the appropriate simile was well known
 shakuntala ke vishay main ek jagah raja dushyant kehete hai ki ‘vah aisa phool he, jise kisi ne suungha nahin he; aisa navpallav he, jis par kisi ke nakhon kii kharonch nahin lagi; aisa ratna he, jisamen chhed nahin kiya gaya or aisa madhu he, jiskaa swaad kisi ne chakhaa nahin he
 'through these similes, a unique glimpse of Shakuntala's beauty comes before our eyes
 isi prakaar paanchaven ank main dushyant shakuntala kaa parityag karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he tapaswini, kya tum vaise hi apane kul ko kalankit karnaa or mujhe patit karnaa chaahati ho, jaise tat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi tat ke vriksh ko to giraati hi he or apane jal ko bhi malin kar leti he
 'upma, given here by the river flowing through the river of Shakuntala, is particularly helpful in expressing the king's mood
 isi prakaar jab kanv ke shishy shakuntala ko saath lekar dushyant ke paas pahunchate hai to dushyant kii drushti un tapasviyon ke bich main shakuntala ke upar jaakar padati he
 By not giving a detailed description of Shakuntala's beauty there, the poet has only said to her mouth that 'who is that veiled beauty among these ascetics, which looks like a new spring in the midst of yellow leaves
 ’ is choti-si upama ne pile pattey or konpal kii sadrishyata ke dwaara shakuntala ke soundarya kaa puraa hi chitrankan kar diya he
 Similarly, looking at Sarvadamana, Dushyant says that 'this majestic child appears like the fire that is burning, looking for fuel to become a blazing fire
 ’ is upama se kalidas ne na keval balak kii tejaswita prakat kar di, balki yah bhi spasht rup se suchit kar diya he ki yah balak bada hokar mahapratapi chakravarti samraat banegaa
 Many examples of such delightful similes can be given from Shakuntal because 180 similes have been used in Shakuntal
 or unamem se sabhi ek se ek badhkar hai
 It is fine that Kalidas had special skill in the choice of Upma and it is also true that some of his beautiful analogies are rare in the compositions of other poets, yet Kalidasa's biggest feature is not upma-kaushal
 upama-kaushal to unke kavy-kaushal kaa ek saamaanya-sa ang he
 Kalidas knows many methods to express his mood or to perfect a rasa or to awaken the intense feeling of an emotion
 shabdon kaa prasangochit chayan, abhisht bhav ke upyukt chand kaa chunaav or vyanjana-shakti kaa prayog karke kalidas ne apni style ko vishesh rup se romantic bana diya he
 Where Kalidas has descended on Shakuntala's aesthetic narrative, he has not satisfied by merely drawing the form of Shakuntala by similes and incantations
 pehle-pehle to unhone keval itnaa kahalwaya ki ‘yadi tapovana ke nivaasiyon main itnaa rup he, to samajho ki van-lataaon ne udyaan kii lataaon ko maat kar diya
 Then he told Dushyant's face that 'it is like to plant such a beautiful girl in the rules of the ashram, like cutting the acacia tree from the petals of Neel Kamal
 ’ uske baad kalidas kehete hai ki ‘shakuntala kaa rup aisa manohar he ki bhale hi usne motaa valkal vastra pahana hua he, phir usase bhi uskaa saundarya kuch gata nahin, balki badha hi he
 Because whatever is given to a beautiful person becomes his ornament
 ’ uske baad raja shakuntala kii sukumaar deh kii tulana hari-bhari phulon se ladi lata ke saath karte hai, jisase us vilakshan saudarya kaa swaroop pathak kii ankhon ke saamne chitrit-sa ho uthta he
 After this, Kalidasa has brought a bhramar to bring that beauty to the climax; Who considers the face of Shakuntala as a beautiful blossoming flower and hovers over it to make it juicy
 is prakaar kalidas ne shakuntala ke saundarya ko chitrit karne ke liye anlakaaron kaa sahaara utana nahin liya, jitna ki vyanjanashkti kaa; or yah vyajana-shakti hi kavy kii jaan maani jaati he

 sabase pracheen vah ardhamagadhi sahitya he jisamen jain dharmik granth rache gaye hai tathaa jinhen samshti rup se jainagam yaa jainshrutang kaha jaataa he
 The ancient tradition of this literature is that the last Jain Tirthankara Mahavira was born in Videha region about 600 BC
 unhone 30 varsh kii avasthaa main muni diksha le lee or 12 varsh tap or dhyaan karke kaivalyagyan praapt kiya
 He then preached Jainism by giving his sermon first to the Rajgriha and then to other places
 unke upadeshon ko unke jeevankaal main hi unke shishyon ne 12 angon main sankalit kiya
 Their names are- in angon kii bhashaa vahi ardhamagadhi praakrit he jisamen mahavir ne apane upadesh die
 Probably this entry was not written at that time and was prevalent in oral form from the guru-shishya tradition and this is the significance of its being called Srutang

 527 main hua or uske pashchaat sheeghra hi ukt angon kii parampara main vipratipattiyaan utpann hone lageen
 The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that as the Shrutangas gradually deteriorated, some of the Acharyos retained some knowledge and based on this, they wrote a new form of theoretical texts, the oldest examples of which are the sutras called Karmaprakrit and Kashayaprakrit
 kintu shwetambar sampradaay kii manyata he ki ukt aagam granthon ko utpann hoti hui vikrutiyon se bachaane ke liye samay-samay par muniyon ne unki vaachanaayen kin or unhen surakshit rakhane kaa praytn kiya
 The first recitation took place 160 years after Mahavira Nirvana under the chairmanship of Sthalabhadracharya in Pataliputra in which 11 organs were compiled
 12wein ang kaa upasthit muniyon main se kisi ko bhi vyavasthit gyaan na hone se uskaa uddhaar nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Due to the constant movement of Jain sages and the continuous revolutions, except for the rainy season, and difficulties of that period, this enlightenment started to become disjointed again
 arya skandit ne mathura main munisangh kaa sammelan kiya or unheen 11 angon ko ek baar pun: vyavasthit karne kaa praytn kiya
 The Devardhigani apology led to the Municipal Conference in Valabhi Nagar and gave Jain Agam the form in which it is available today
 is vaachana main uparyukt 11 angon ke atirikt anya anek granthon ko suvyavasthit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya jo is kalavadhi tak rache ja chuke the

 The mention of Paadlaptasurikrta Taranvatikatha is found in many ancient texts
 yah mul granth padya aprapya he, kintu iske aadhaar se nirmit nemichandrakrut tarangalila namakarachana uplabdh he
 Its plot is a novel, in which the accounts of many births of the characters are intertwined and it commemorates Banakrit Kadambari
 praakrit gadhy sahitya main haribhadrasurikrut samaradityakatha kaa vishesh sthaan he
 This is a story in which the nine births of two conflicting men are described respectively
 vidweshi purush prayek janm main apane bairee se irshyaabhaav ke kaaran uttarottar adhogati ko praapt hota he or chatrinayak apane man tathaa charitrya ko uttarottar shuddh banaata hua antim bhav main samaraditya naam kaa raja hokar tapasya dwaara moksh praapt karata he
 The narratives of the nine Bhavans are independent and complete in their own form and they have a beautiful depiction of human emotions and different levels of society
 haribhadra kii duusari ullekhneey praakrit rachana he - dhurtaakhyaan
 In its five narratives, five rascals have narrated their own stories, which lead to sarcastic criticism of many mythological exaggerated accounts
 is prakaar yah padyatmak rachana praakrit main hi nahin, kintu pracheen bhartiya sahitya main vyangyakatha kaa ek apurv udhaaharan he
 a similar story is Udyotanasurikrit Kuvalayamala
 isamen nayika tathaa uske anya saathiyon ke teen-chaar janmantaron kaa varnan ati rochakata ke saath grathit kiya gaya he
 dhaneshwarsurricified Sursundaricharitra
 gaathatmak kathanak he jisamen anek sanyog or viyogtmak premakhyaan grathit hai
 The Mahesvarasurikrit Gyanpanchami Katha consists of the Dasha religious stories
 hemchandrakrut kumarpalacharit aath sargo kaa ek kavy he jisamen karta ke samakaleen gujarat ke raja kumarpal ke charitravarnan ke saath saath kavi ne apane praakrit vyakaran ke niyamon ko usee kram se udaahrit kiya he
 Thus it reminds Bhattikavya of Sanskrit in which examples of Paninian grammar are introduced, although here those examples are not as ordered as in Kumarapalacharitra
 devendrasurikrut shripalcharit, devandraganikrut ratnachudarycharit, sumatisurikrut jindattaakhyaan tathaa jinaharshganikrut ratnashekharikatha aadi anek praakrit kathanak jain sahitya main ulabdh hai tathaa inke atirikt vratakthaon ke rup main bahut si laghu kathaayen bhi praapt hai
 Dandi in his Alankara scripture called Kavyadarsha has called Maharashtri the language of Sethubandhi poems: isse praakrit bhashaa or sahitya ke sambandh kii do mahatvapurn baaten siddh hoti hai- ek to yah ki dandi ke samay main praakrit bhashaa kaa jo swaroop viksit hokar kavyrachana main utarane laga tha, usee kaa naam maharashtri praakrit prasiddh hua or duusari yah ki isi praakrit main sethubandh or usee ke sadrush anya bhi kuch rachanaayen us samay prasiddh ho chuki thim
 Fortunately, the Setubandha poetry mentioned by Dandi is still available and is considered to be an excellent composition of Prakrit
 iskaa ullekh vanbhatta ne bhi harshcharit ko utthanika main is prakaar kiya he : This proves that the doer of this bridge was named Pravarsena and by the time of Baan its fame had probably reached Lanka across the sea
 iskaa naam ravanavadh yaa dashamukhwadh bhi paaya jaataa he
 Kalidas has also been called its doer
 is sambandh ke samast ullekhon ke vivechan se yah baat pramanit hoti he ki is kavy ke karta vaakatkavanshi raja rudrasen ke putr pravarasen hi hai
 His father died during his childhood and his mother Prabhavati Gupta took over the affairs of the state
 prabhavati gupta samrat chandragupta vikramaditya kii putree thim
 That is why the Guptasamrat sent Kalidas, the great poet of his assembly, for his help for some time
 anumaanath: usee bich yah kavyrachana hui or kalidas ne uskaa kuch sanshodhan bhi kiya hoga
 We get some idea of this in the seventh saga of poetry itself
 in baton se yah rachana guptasamrat chandragupta dwitiya ke rajyakaal kii siddh hoti he
 There are 15 assurances in this poem and in the last verse of each assurance, the poet informs himself by the Anuragank or Anuragakhyan
 kavy kaa kathanak sita apharan ke pashchaat prarambh hota he, jab ram viyog kii vyathaa main hai
 Sita was traced to Lanka by Hunaman with Sugriva's help and then Rama Lakshmana set out to attack Lanka including Vanarasena, but a major problem was present on the beach crossing the sea
 bade praytn se us par sethu banaaya gaya, sena paar hui; yuddh main ravan maaraa gaya, tathaa sita kii agnipariksha ke pashchaat unhen saath le ram puspak vimaan dwaara ayodhya ko laut aae
 The story follows Valmiki's Ramayana, but the nature and events describe the poet's own
 style samaas or alankarprachur he
 The language of the Sethubandhi poems that Dandi has called Maharashtri, probably means Gathasaptashati, apart from the Sethubandha, which Bana mentions in Harshacharita as follows: iske anusaar satvaahan ne sundar subhashiton kaa ek kosh nirmaan kiya tha
 In the beginning, this dictionary was famous as Subhashitakosh or Gatakosh
 peeche kramash: saat sau gaathaon kaa samavesh ho jane par uski saptshati naam se prasiddh hui
 Satavahana, Shalivahana or Hal Naresh are as well-known in Indian narratives as Vikramaditya
 vatsyayan tathaa rajasekhar ne unhen kuntal kaa raja kaha he or somdevkrut kathasaritsagar ke anusaar ve narvahandat ke putr the tathaa unki rajdhani pratishthan thi
 In the Puranas, in the dynasty of Andhra frescoes, first the name of the king Satavahana and the name of the seventeenth king is specified
 in sab pramaanon se haal kaa samay i
 kii pratham do, teen shatiyon ke bich siddh hota he or us samay gaatha saptshati kaa kosh naamak mul sankalan kiya gaya hoga
 According to Rajasekhar, Satavahana had made the rule of using Prakrit language in his inner world
 ek janashruti ke anusaar unheen ke samay main gunanty dwaara pashachi praakrit main brihatkatha rachi gai, jiske ab keval sanskrit roopaantar brihatkthamanjari tathaa kathasaritsagar milte hai
 Each saga of Gathasaptashati is perfect in its form and portrays a human emotion, behavior or natural scene with the utmost simplicity and beauty
 shringaar ras kii pradhanta he, kintu hasya, kaarunya aadi rason kaa bhi abhaav nahin he
 Vindhyaparvat and the river Gola come again in nature painting
 gram, khet, upavan, jhaadi, nadi, kuen, talab aadi par purush striyon ke vilaspurn vyavhaar ev bhavabhangiyon kaa jaisaa chithran yahan miltaa he, vaisaa anyatra durlabh he
 This collection has had a major impact on later literature
 isi ke adarsh par jain kavi jayavallabh ne "vajjaalaggan" naamak praakrit subhashiton kaa sangrah taiyaar kiya, jisaki lagbhag 800 gaathaon main se koi 80 gaathaayen isi kosh se uddhrut kii gai hai
 In Sanskrit, Govardhanacharya composed Aryasaptashati on the emulation of this
 hindi main tulasisatsai or bihari satsai sambhavat: isi rachana se prabhavit hui hai
 In Prakrit, the fame of Setubandha has been known from the point of view of poetry, similarly the fame of Lilavati is found from the point of view of fiction
 bhojdev, hemchandra, vagbhatta aadi sanskrit ke alankaar shaastrakaron ne gadhimayi katha kaa udhaaharan kadambari or padyamayi katha kaa leelavati ko diya he
 Udyotanasuri, in his story called Kuvalayamala, has written a curious Prakrit language and has written a pure narrative of the Marhatta scripture, which proves the meaning of this composition
 usase iske karta kaa naam kautuhal or rachanakaal 778 i
 se purv kaa nishchay ho jaataa he
 This composition came to light only a few years ago, there are no navigation departments
 lagaataar 13000 se kuch adhik gaathaon main katha samaapt hui he
 In the 1330th saga, the poet himself states that he composed it in Maharashtri Prakrit
 is katha ke nayak asmak desh ke pratishthananagar ke raja satvaahan hai
 He was married to Princess Lilavati of Shilamegh king of Sinhala after a great event
 unke mantriyon ke naam yahan potsi or kumaril batalaaye gaye hai
 Both these names are also found in the Gathasaptashati and the authors of the gathas
 isse is baat kii bhi pushti hoti he ki is katha ke karta satvaahan, shalivahan yaa haal hi hai ye teenon hi naam is katha main yatra-tatra aae hai
 The story is described in a very simple and succulent style
 maharashtri praakrit kaa ek utkrisht kavy he gaudwaho jiske karta vaakpatiraj ne apane ko kanyabuj naresh yashoverma kaa samakaleen kaha he
 He has also mentioned poets like Bhasa, Sambandhu, Harich and Bhavabhuti
 in sab lekhon par se inkaa samay 8 veen shatee i
 anumaan kiya ja saktaa
 There is no passage even in this poem
 lagaataar 1200 se kuch upar gaathaayen hai, jinamein raja yashoverma ke pratap or unki jayyatra tathaa gouddesh ke raja ke vadh kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The tradition of Prakrit poetry is told till the 18th century
 is shatabdi ke prasiddh praakrit kavi hai rampanivad jinaki do praakrit rachanaayen suprasiddh hai
 One is Kansavho, whose four sergo accounts for Uddhav taking Krishna and Balarama from Gokul to Mathura on the pretext of Dhanushagya, and Kansa's death, based on the story of Bhagwat
 style main kalidas, bharavi tathaa magh kii rachanaaon kaa prabhaav spasht dikhaai detaa he
 Ushanirudham is another epic of Rampanism, in which Pradyumna's son Anirudh's marriage to the Banaki daughter Usha is described in four circles
 yah kathanak bhi bhagavtadi puraanon par ashrith he, kintu kavi ne apni kavypratibha se acha sajaayaa he
 These poems of pure Prakrit in the 18th century in remote Kerala are proof that Prakrit's reading and poetry flow may have been rapid and slow, depending on the situation, but it is not completely dry
 is prakaar praakrit sahitya apane rup evam vishay kii drushti se bada mahatvapurn he tathaa bhartiya samskruti ke sarvang parishilan ke liye uskaa sthaan adwitiya he
 It represents the lingua franca that has flushed the estuaries of the Mahanadi, Ganga, Yamuna etc
, from the Vedic period and possibly even earlier, to many parts of the country and made its literature land fertile

 purv chhathi shatee se lekar praaia: vartmaan tak praakrit bhashaaon main granthrachana hoti chali ai he, yadhyapi shastreey drushti se un bhashaaon kaa vikaas i
 san 1000 tak hi mana jaataa he, kyonki uske pashchaat hindi, gujarati, marathi, banglaa, aadi aadhunik bhashaaon kaa yug prarambh hota he
 From Magadh to Darad region and from Himalayas to Sinhala island, the variety of folklore is safe in Prakrit
