 One of the characteristics of language is that it is always moving, if the time never stops, then the language also never stops
 tabhi sant kabirdaas ne kaha -sansakirat he kupajal, bhakha bahata nir
 In fact, cognition prevalent in the consciousness has an impenetrable relationship with language, it can be explained in this way
 

jaada laganaa ek bahya bhashik anubhav he, jaada lag rahaa he us bahya bhashik anubhav kaa anubhav he yani kii anubhuti he, phir is anubhuti kaa anubhav kavi ke yahan kuch is prakaar sambhav hota he -shishir kii sharvari, hinsr pashuon bhari
 Therefore, experience is the experience or the language of experience
 or phir bhashaa or anubhuti ke advait rup ko sweekaar karte hue kavita yaa kii rachana kii paribhaasha is prakaar he -anubhav hone ke anubhav hone kaa anubhav kavita he
 In language, various experiences of human life are accumulated, this is the Adirjana of man, any experience of the world when embodied in consciousness occurs with language and is created even with language
 kavy yaa ki sahitya bhashaa ke aadhaar par hi sthir hota he
 Literature is more intellectual in its nature as compared to other arts, being language rather than color or tone
 vahaan vichaar or anubhav ek duusare main dub jate hai jabaki anya kalaon jaise -sangeet, chitra yaa murtikla main pradhanta anubhav kii he
 The synthesis of thought and feeling is the specialty of language that is why literature is composed in language
 vichaar or anubhuti ke sanshlesh se sahitya yaa ki kavy main arth kii sristi hoti he
 In this way, the evolutionary process of meaning goes on in literature, which touches the country and the person
 sunishchit pratimaanon yaa ki paimaanon ke sahare chaahe ve puraane hon yaa nae kavita kii nirantar viksonsheel prakriya ko samajha samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 If the poem is not written on the basis of models, it is not understood, in fact, understanding the poem is an extension of its creation process and it is possible to make this process of expanding the meaning of the poem as the prime function of the critic
 kisi aalochak kaa jab kisi kavita se saakshaatkaar hota he to pratham anubhav bhashaa se hota he phir bhashaa ke sahare uske arth kaa bodh karata he yah dwitiyak anubhav yaa ki kavyanubhav kaa anubhav he or phir arth ke sahare kavita ke aadhaar anubhav ko grahan karata he yah dwitiyak anubhav kaa anubhav yaa ki kavyanubhav ke anubhav kaa anubhav he or yahi aalochana he jisamen rachana kaa arthvistaar swatah hota rahata he
 Thus there is a visual harmony between poetic composition and criticism
 jahaan rachana yadi jivan kaa arthvistaar he to aalochana us rachana kaa arthvistaar he
 Ramswaroop Chaturvedi: This is the heart of the experience of experience of poetry, where understanding of poetry is necessary to understand poetry and not any ideology
 adhiktar vichaardhaara ke agrahi aalochak kavita main nihit anubhav or arth kaa vistaar karne kii bajaay swayan apni apni vichaardhaara kaa arthvistaar dete hai jo ki kavita yaa ki sahitya ke liye hanikar he
 Pyaar Ki Kahani is a 1971 Hindi language film
 praayah samajha jaataa he ki, vigyaan or takneekee kii padhai keval angreji main hi sambhav he
 It is also natural to have such a belief because it is taught in our education system that the study of science can be done only in English
 vigyaan or hindi ke sabhi vidwaan yahi bataate hue paae jate hai ki vigyaan kii paribhaasha keval angreji main hi karnaa sambhav he
 The scholars of Hindi who have received big prizes do not get tired of glorifying Hindi, but when it comes time to enroll their children in school, they give priority to English schools only
 duusari taraf vigyaan ke vidwaan jab bhi vigyaan kii baat karenge to unke jubaan se angreji hi haaavee rahegi
 Another argument is made that science originated in the English language of the west, so it is advisable to read and study science only in English
 isamen vigyaan vishay kii paryaapt maatra main saamagree na hone kaa bhi kutark diya jaataa he
 According to an article published on Wikipedia, there are 3500 Hindi writers who write on various subjects of science and the number of books around 8000 which are written on the subjects of science
 chandrakant raju kii pustak kya vigyaan kaa janm pashchim main hua he? pustak main spasht rup se bataaya gaya he ki kis prakaar bhartiya pracheen vigyaan ke sutara jo pehle sanskrit main the, kis prakaar angreji or anya bhashaaon main anudit kar use apane naam se prasaarit kiya gaya he
 Now we will consider the topic that in present time in India, is it possible to study science in Hindi and if possible, to which class, because it is possible to study science in Hindi, then it is possible to know more parents than most parents
 English mediums are sent to schools, because they feel that when they have to study further in English, since childhood they have got English Why not put Ji used
 lekin paalkon ko yah nahin pataa hota ki unke bacchon yadi bachapan main maatrubhaasha or hindi main vigyaan or ganit jaise katheen vishay padhenge to unki samaj badhegi or jatil sankalpanaaon ko ve or behatar dhang se samaj paaainge
 But technical and science books and studies of secondary, higher and university and university level are available in Hindi, then what is the need to carry the burden of English in school and childhood
 bacchon ke bastein or dimag par boj badhaane se acha he unhen maatrubhaasha or hindi main likhi gai vigyaan kii pustaken padhwai jaae, isse unki vigyaan sambandhi soch spasht hogi ore unke komal man or buddhi par videshi bhashaa kaa boj bhi nahin badhegaa
 Due to all the studies in English after secondary education, Indian students are also victims of inferiority complex, with no development of their science thinking or simply put, children are not directly comfortable with English
 , So that their ideas lack originality
 madhyamik str ke baad vigyaan, ejineering, medical or profeshnal corces kii bhashaa hindi main honi chahie tabhi vigyaan kaa sahi myanon main prasar hoga
 Science in Hindi will have to be made a language of employment along with educational level
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki agar koi chaatr hindi madhyam se vigyaan yaa ejineering aadi kii padhai karen to use bazaar bhi saport karen jisase ki use naukari mil sake
 She should not be discriminated against in terms of employment
 sarkaar ko iske liye ek vyavastha viksit kerani hogi tabhi hindi vigyaan kii bhashaa ban paayegaa
 Similarly, science communication in Hindi will have to be promoted by making it employable
 iskaa ek or phayda yah he ki mahavidhyalayan or vishvavidhyalay str kii padhai ko jo saamanyat: 4 se 5 varshe kii hoti he, use ghataakar 2 se 3 varshon kaa kiya ja saktaa he or angreji samajhane main lagane vaale samay or mehnat se bhi bachaa ja saktaa he
 It will also gain momentum in implementing the Official Language Policy of the Government of India as the young generation will study technical and science subjects in Hindi, then they will get employment in Central Government Offices through separate Hindi Training Scheme through the classes of Prabodh, Praveen and Pragya Will not even need to run and they are directly admitted into the 'advanced' course can go
 iske atirikt yadi snaatak or snatakottar str par karyalayn hindi bhashaa ko anivaary taur par ek vishay ke rup main lagu kiya gaya to isse bhi rajbhasha hindi ke prashikshan or karyanvayan ko or bhi gati milegi
 It is often seen that most of the people who are admitted in government offices come to read their technical and science subjects in English, so they are hard to do their work in Hindi, for which separate training programs are conducted for such employees
 Falls, which is only for making proficiency in official work in Hindi
 bharat ke kuch rajyon main vigyaan vishyon ko hindi main padhne or padhaane se achche parinaam saamne aane lage he
 The students who have topped most of the competitive examinations are seen getting good marks from Hindi mediums

 Along with school science, books on subjects related to secondary, higher secondary, college, graduate and postgraduate science and technology are also available in Hindi, which most people are not aware of
 jaise vigyaan kii sabhi shakhaon, takneekee, abhiyantriki, politechnic, itii, sie, sies, sieme, computer, iskar, spardhaa parikshawon kii taiyaari se sambandhit pustaken, dharm, vidhishastra, medical, nursing, aushadh nirmaan, bi pharmasi kii pustaken bhi hindi main uplabdh hai
 In the states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, etc
, science subjects can be easily taught and explained in Hindi
 isse spardhaa pariksha or anya parikshaon main bhi awwal sthaan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If a language lesson is added in computer courses like MS C, then training can be imparted on computer in Hindi and other Indian languages while getting training in computer
 vartmaan samay main praathmik, madhyamik, ucchtar, mahavidhyalayan, snatakottar, snaatak, vishvavidhyalay str kii vibhinn vishyon kii pustaken hindi main uplabdh he, jinaki jaankaree ham praapt karenge

 The iron pillar is a huge pillar located near the Qutub Minar in Delhi
 yah apneaap main pracheen bhartiya dhaatukarm kii paraakaashtha he
 It is reportedly constructed from King Chandragupta Vikramaditya, but some experts believe that it was built before, possibly in 912 BC
 stambh kii unchaai lagbhag saat meter he or pehle hindu va jain mandir kaa ek hissaa tha
 In the thirteenth century Qutubuddin Aibak destroyed the temple and established the Qutub Minar
 louh-stambh main lohe kii maatra kareeb 98% he or abhi tak jang nahin laga he
 For more than 1600 years it has stood motionless in all seasons for centuries under the open sky
 itane varshon main aaj tak usamen jang nahin lagi, yah baat duniya ke liye aashcharya kaa vishay he
 As far as the history of this pillar is concerned, it was built in the fourth century
 is stambh par sanskrit main jo khuda hua he, uske anusaar ise dhvaj stambh ke rup main khadaa kiya gaya tha
 It was erected as a flag pillar in front of the temple of Lord Vishnu built on the Vishnu hill in Mathura by Chandraraj
 is par garud sthapit karne hetu ise banaaya gaya hoga, at: ise garud stambh bhi kehete hai
 In 1050 this pillar was brought by the founder of Delhi, Anangpal

 Archaeological Survey of India Chief Chemist Dr

B
 Lal has come to the conclusion that this pillar is formed by adding pieces of 20-30 kg of hot iron
 mana jaataa he ki 120 kaarigaron ne dinon ke parishram ke baad is stambh kaa nirmaan kiya
 The technique of adding hot iron pieces sixteen hundred years ago is also a matter of surprise, because not a single joint is visible anywhere in the entire iron column
 solah shatabdiyon se khule main rahane ke baad bhi uske vaise ke vaise bane rahane kii sthiti ne visheshgyon ko chakit kiya he
 It contains high amount of phosphorus and low amount of sulfur and manganese

 In addition, 50 to 600 micron thick oxide layer also protects the column from corrosion
 itihaaskaaron ne mahrauli ke loh stambh ko samraat chandragupta dwitiya ke kaal main rakhaa he or loh stambh main varnit raja chandra ko chandragupta dwitiya se jod diya he
 Some historians believe that the article in that iron pillar is of the style of Gupta writings and some say that in the archer coins of Chandragupta II there is a pillar which has Garuda, but that pillar appears less and scepter more
 loh stambh ke anusaar raja chandra ne vang desh ko haraaya tha or sapt sindhu nadiyon ke muhane par vahliko ko haraaya tha
 Western historians such as James Ferguson believe that this iron pillar belongs to Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty
 kuch itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah stambh samraat ashok kaa he jo unhone apane dada chandragupta maury kii yaad main banwaaya tha

 Garuda is the child of Kashyapa Rishi and his second wife Vinata
 daksh prajapati kii kadru or vinata naamak do kanyaayein thim
 Both of them were married to Kashyap Rishi
 kashyap rishi se kadru ne ek hajaar naag putr or vinata ne keval do tejasvi putr vardaan ke rup main maange
 As a result of the boon, Kadru delivered one thousand eggs and Vinata gave two eggs
 kadru ke andon ke footne par use ek hajaar naag putr mil gayi
 But Vinata's eggs did not burst at that time
 utaavali hokar vinata ne ek andey ko phod daalaa
 The upper limb of the child coming out of it was complete but the lower limbs could not be formed
 us bachche ne krodhit hokar apni mata ko shaap de diya ki mata! tumne kachche andey ko tod diya he isaliye tuje paanch sau varshon tak apni sout kii daasi banakar rahanaa hoga
 Be careful to allow the second egg to burst from you
 us andey se ek atyant tejasvi balak hoga or vahi tuje is shaap se mukti dilaayegaa
 Saying this, that child named Arun flew into the sky and became the charioteer of the chariot of the Sun
 ek din kadru or vinata kii drushti samudr manthan se nikle huye ucchanshrava ghode par padi
 Kadru said that the tail of that horse is black while Vinata described him as white
 is par donon main shart hui ki jiskaa kathan galat hoga use duusare kii daasi bananaa hoga
 Both of them accepted the condition and went to see the tail
 kadru ne chupchaap apane putron ko us punch se lipat jane kii ajna di isse punch kaali dikhaai padane lagi
 Vinata accepted defeat and became Kadru's maid
 samay aane par vinata ke duusare andey se mahatejasvi garud kii utpatti hui
 His power and speed were unparalleled
 ek din kadru ne garud se kaha ki tum meri daasi ke putr ho isaliye tum mere putron ko ghamaane le jaao
 Garuda was very angry at this, but he obeyed the stepmother
 sarpon ko ghumaate huye garud ne unase apni mata ko daastaa se mukt kar dene ke liye kaha
 On this, the snakes said that if you bring amrit for us, we will free your mother from slavery
 garud ne indra sahit sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar amrit ghat unase chin liya
 Impressed by Garuda's might, Indra befriended Garuda
 mitrataa ho jane par indra bole, "mitra! aap is amrit ghat ko mujhe waapas de dijiye kyonk aap jinke liye ise le ja rahe hai ve swabhaavatah bahut dusht hai
 "garuda said to this," i know but i am taking it to them to get my mother free from slavery
 aap vahaan se ise waapas laa sakate hai
 He accidentally met Narayan
 narayan ne garud se prasann hokar var maangane ke liye kaha
 On this, Garuda took the oath to remain in his flag forever
 saath hi ve narayan ke vaahan bhi ban gayi
 After this, Garuda liberated his mother from slavery by giving nectar of nectar to snakes
 amrit ghat ko kushasan par rakh kar saare sarp pavitra hone ke liye snaan karne chale gayi
 Meanwhile, Indra took away that nectar from the theft
 ravan ke putr meghnath ne ram se yuddh karte huye ram ko nagapasha se band diya tha
 At the behest of Devarshi Narada, Garuda, who was a snakebite, ate all the snakes of Nagpash and rescued Rama from the bond of Nagpash
 ram ke is tarah nagapasha main bandh jane par ram ke parambrahm hone par garud ko sandeh ho gaya
 To remove the suspicion of Garuda, Devarshi Narada sent him to Brahma
 brahma ji ne unase kaha ki tumhaara sandeh bhagwaan shankar dur kar sakate hai
 Lord Shankar also sent Garuda to Kakabhusundi ji to erase his suspicions
 ant main kakbhushundi ji ram ke charitra kii pavitra katha suna kar garud ke sandeh ko dur kiya
 Garuda, Wat Chal Kham, Via Khum Kham Chia Mai bainkak ke ek hotel ke baahar garud or vishnu Bangkok's Vata Suthat Gate shiam commercial bank kii ek shakha par garud a branch of microbiology

 8 km away from this village, there is a city called Bhagwatgarh where every need related goods are available to the village and if seen, where can this village go to the backbone of Bhagwatgarh city, because the village of Jhopra from Bhagwatgarh would buy about 40 lakh rupees annually
 Which is more than the surrounding villages, while in second place comes the tied village of Lorwara Gram Panchayat, which does a turnover of about 25 lakhs from this city

 a lubricant is a material that is applied between two moving surfaces to reduce friction between them, improve efficiency and not wear out quickly
 It may have the function of dissolving or transporting foreign particles and the distribution of heat
 lubricant ke liye ekal sabase bade prayojanon main ek he, motor oil ke rup main, motor vaahanon or vidyut chaalit upkarnon main aantarik dahan ingine kii suraksha
 Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil and less than 10% additives
 kabhi-kabhi base oil ke rup main vanaspati tel yaa hydrogen se yukt polyolefins, aster, silicon, flourocarbon jaise synthetic drav or kai anya synthetic taral padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Additives cause less friction and wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion and oxidation, aging or contamination, etc
 2-saaikal oil jaise lubricant bhi kuch indhanon main milaae jate hai
 Sulfur impurities in fuels provide some lubricating properties, which have to be taken into account when changing to low-sulfur diesel; Biodiesel is a popular diesel fuel additive that provides additional smoothness
 gaiyr-taral lubricanton main shaamil hai greez, powder, nalsaazi main prayukt tefflon tepe, air kushan or anya
 grefite, molybdenum dicelphid, tungston dicelphid jaise sookhe lubricant, taral or tel-aadhaarit lubricanton kii sanchaalan kshamta kii tulana main ucch taapmaana chiknayee pradaan karte hai
 Limited interest has been observed in the low friction properties of solid oxide glaze levels formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, their practical use is many years away due to their physically unstable nature
 gharshan or ghisaav kam karne ke liye ek or drushtikon he ball bering, roller bering yaa air bering jaise beringon kaa upyog, jinke liye badale main aantarik chiknayee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yaa acustic lubrication ke maamle main, dhwani kaa upyog
 In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes
 anya upyogon main shaamil hai khaanaa pakaana, maanvon par jaev-chikitsiya prayojan, ultra-sound pareekshan, purushon or mahilaon ke liye aantarik pareekshan or yon prayojanon ke liye vyaktigat lubricant kaa istemaal
 Lubricants perform the following important functions
 aam taur par lubricant ko kisi pranali main gatisheel bhaagon ko alag rakhane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 This has the advantage of reducing surface labor while reducing friction and heat generation, operating noise and vibration
 lubricant ise kai tareekon se hasil karte hai
 The most common is by the formation of a physical barrier, ie the lubricant separates the moving parts
 ise hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 At high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid layer is very thin and some forces are transmitted to the surfaces through the lubricant
 ise elasto-hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 Generally lubricant-to-surface friction is less than surface-to-surface friction in any system of lubricant
 is prakaar lubricant kaa upyog samgr pranali ke gharshan ko kam kar detaa he
 The advantage of low friction is low heat generation and low formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency
 Lubricants may include additives called friction modifiers that chemically bind solid surfaces to reduce surface friction, even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant for hydrodynamic lubrication, e
g
 Protection of valve train in car engine at start-up
 donon gas or taral lubricant taap antarit kar sakate hai
 However, liquid lubricants are more effective due to their high specific heat capacity
 aam taur par taral lubricant pranali ke cooler bhaag se or usamen parichaalit hota he, haalanki lubricant kaa istemaal garm tathaa thande karne ke liye ho saktaa he jab niyantrit taapmaana kii aavashyaktaa ho
 yah parisanchari pravaah kisi niyat samay main ikai main dur jane vaale taap kii maatra bhi nirdhaarit karata he
 High flow systems can carry a lot of heat and also have the added benefit of reducing thermal stress on the lubricant
 is tarah kam laagat vaale taral lubricant kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary drawback is that large flows typically require large caps and large cooling units
 ek gaun dosha yah he ki ucch pravaah pranali jo lubricant ko thermal tanaav se bachaane ke liye pravaah dar par nirbhar karti he, achaanak pranali ke band hone par vipattipurna vifaltaa ke liye atisamvedansheel he
 a typical example is an automotive oil-cooled turbo charger
 terbocharger sanchaalan ke dauraan garm laal ho jate hai or unhen thanda karne vaala tel batch rahata he kyonki pranali main uskaa rahane kaa samay bahut kam he arthath ucch pravaah dar
 yadi pranali ko achaanak band kar diya jaae terbo charger main maujuud tel kaa turant oxikaran hota he or nikshep sahit tel margon ko avaruddh karegaa
 samay ke saath shitalan kam karte hue, ye nikshep tel margon ko puri tarah avaruddh kar sakate hai, jiske parinamswaroop jam beringon ke saath aam taur par terbo charger puri tarah band ho jaataa he
 Non-flowing lubricants such as grease and paste are not effective during heat transfer, although at first they contribute by reducing heat generation
 lubricant sancharan pranaaliyon se aantarik rup se janit malbe or pranali main aane vaale bahya dooshit padaarthon ko dur le jane kaa laabh he, jo filter main pahunchate hai jahaan se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Lubricants for machines that routinely generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically include detergents and dispersed additives to transport and remove debris and contaminants to the filter
 samay ke saath filter bhar jayega or safaai yaa use badalane kii zarurat hogi, atah sifarish kii jaati he ki car main tel badalte samay oil filter bhi badal daalen
 gear box jaisi band pranaaliyon main filter main chumbak anupoorak shaamil ho saktaa he taaki utpann baariq lohe ke chure aakarshith ho jaaen
 It is clear that oil in a communications system can only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that no industry standards exist that allow consumers to easily evaluate the filtering ability of various automotive filters
 Can
 Poor filtration specifically reduces the life of the machine as well as disables the system
 hydrolic taral ke rup main gyaat lubricant kaa upyog hydrostatic vidyut sanchaar main kaaryakari taral padaarth ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Hydraulic fluids comprise a large fraction of all lubricants produced worldwide
 swat: sancharan kaa anthan parivartak lubricant ke saath vidyut pareshan ke liye ek or mahatvapurn prayojan he
 Lubricants prevent rubbing by keeping the moving parts separate
 lubricant main ragad-rodhi yaa atyadhik dabaav vaale yojak bhi ho sakate hai jo ragad or shram ke prati unke nishpaadan ko badhaava dete hai
 Generally good quality lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces to prevent corrosion and rusting
 lubricant gatisheel hisson ke bich keshika bal ke zarie nikasi ko gherta he, jisase nikasi band ho jaati he
 This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts

 Typically lubricants are made with more base oil and some additives for the required characteristics
 taral lubricanton kii tulana main gasiy lubricant main bahut kam chipchipahat or adhik sampeden hoti he, lekin taral-jhilli siddhant gaison ke samroop lagu hote hai
 Some examples of gaseous lubricants are air, technical gases, steam or liquid-metal vapor
 taral lubricant ke lakshan kai alag tareekon se varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 One of the most common methods is by the type of base oil used
 The following are the most common types
 note: haalanki aam taur par lubricant ek yaa duusare prakaar ke base oil par aadhaarit hai, yah sambhav he ki nishpaadan apekshaaon kii purti ke liye base oil ke mishranon kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 a natural water repellent, lanolin is derived from sheep wool grease and is an alternative to the more common petrochemical-based lubricants
 yah lubricant zang nirodhak bhi he, jo zang, lavan or amlon se raksha karata he
 Water itself can be used, or in combination with any other base oil, as a major component
 saamanytah milling or leath terning jaisi ejineering prakriyaaon main prayukt hota he
 The term is used to describe lubricating base oil derived from crude oil
 american petroleum institute vibhinn prakaar ke lubricant base oil ko nirdisht karata he jinaki nimna rup main pahchaan kii gai he: Such as naphthenics, PAG, esters, etc
 lubricant udyog saamanytah is samooh shabdaawalee ko nimna shaamil karne ke liye vistrut karti he: Can be classified into three categories based on the prevailing structures: ye mukhya rup se paudhon or jaanwaron se praapt triglisride aster hai
 Vegetable derived material is preferred for the use of lubricant base oil
 aam telon main shaamil hai ucch oleik canola tel, arandi kaa tel, palm tel, surajamukhi ke bijon kaa tel, vanaspati se repasid tel or pashu sroton se tol tel
 kai vanaspati telon ko aksar amla kii upaj ke liye hydrlise kiya jaataa he jinhen baad main vishisht synthetic aster banane ke liye chuninda taur par sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Whale oil has historically been an important lubricant, being used as an abrasive modifier additive for automatic circulating liquid until the late 20th century
 tefflon PTFE aam taur par coating parat ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, khaanaa pakaane ke bartan non-stick sataha uplabdh karaane ke liye
 iskaa vyavhaarya taapmaana 350 °C tak vistrut he or rasinic niskriyata ise vishesh greezon main upyogi yojak banaati he
 Under extreme pressure, teflon powder or solid is of no value, as it softens and flows away from the contact area
 tab chini mitti yaa dhaatu yaa mishra dhaatu lubricant kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of materials that can be used as solid lubricants to much higher temperatures than normal
 kuch aisi saamagree kaa upyog kabhi-kabhi unke karaab oxikaran pratirodh dwaara pratibandhit ho jaataa he 
 Metal alloys, composite and pure metals can be used as grease additives or as a single component of sliding surfaces and bearings
 cadmium or sona, satahon par chadhaane ke liye istemaal hote hai jo unhen acha gharshan pratirodh or sarakan gun pradaan karte hai, sisa, tin, zinc mishra-dhaatu or vibhinn kaansya mishra-dhaatuon kaa upyog phisalane vaale bering ke liye istemaal hota he, yaa unke powder ko keval phisalane vaali satahon ko chikna banane ke liye, yaa greezon main yojak ke rup main prayog main laa sakate hai
 Another phenomenon on which research has been done in high temperature breakdown prevention and lubrication is 'layer climbing'
 It is the generation of a solid oxide layer, which normally accumulates at high temperatures, with metal surfaces sliding against each other to form a crystalline 'layer'
 Friction and wear can be reduced due to the avoidance of metal contact and adhesion by the production of oxides
 prabhavi rup se, is tarah kii sataha swa-chiknayee vaali hoti he
 Since the 'layer' is already an oxide, it can survive at very high temperatures in air or oxidizing environments
 tathaapi, aadhaar dhaatu ke liye zaruri hone kii vajah se ise asuvidha he ki paryaapt oxide malba utpann karne ke liye pehle ise tut-foot se guzaranaa hoga
 a large number of additives are used to provide performance characteristics to the lubricant
 yojakon ke mukhya parivaar hai: Note that many basic chemical compounds that are used as detergents also serve as the purpose of the first seven items in the list
 aam taur par aarthik rup se yaa takneekee rup se sab kaam ke liye ek yojak mishran kaa prayog vyavhaarya nahin he
 Oil has a high content of EP additives for hypoid gear lubrication
 greez lubricant main adhik maatra main grefite, molybdenum salphid, aadi jaise gharshan parivartak thos kan shaamil ho sakate hai
 The global lubricant market typically competes with many manufacturers and vendors

 Lubricant marketers generally follow any or many of the following strategies --- when doing business
 lubricant kathith taur par ek nishchit vinirdesh ko puraa karata he
 In the consumer market, this is often supported by a logo, symbol, or words that inform consumers that the lubricant marketer has done independent verification of conformance to the specification
 iske udaahranon main shaamil hai API kaa donot logo yaa NSF kaa tik mark
 sabase vyapak rup se dekha gaya he SAE chipchipaapan vinirdesan, jaise SAE 10W-40
 chiknayee ke vinirdesh santhaan or nirmaataa aadhaarit hai
 At the American Institute: API s for petrol engines, API C
 for diesel engines
 The current specifications for 2007 are API SM and API CJ
 The higher second letter indicates better oil properties, such as less engine failure supported by tests
 ACEA specifications are used in the European Union
 vahaan shreniyan maujuud hai A, B, C, e akshar kaa anusaran karti sankhyaon ke saath
 japan ne motorbike injanon ke liye JASO vinirdesan pravartit kiya
 In the industrial market, the specification may take the form of a legal contract that supplies the corresponding fluid, or the buyer can choose to purchase based on the manufacturer's own published specifications
 aksar vinirdesh ek nunatam sweekaarya nishpaadan str nirupit karte hai
 Thus many device manufacturers tighten the tolerance on a common specification to add to their specific requirements or to meet their needs
 This gives lubricant marketers the opportunity to differentiate their product by designing to meet the OEM specification
 aksar, OEM vyapak pareekshan karata he or anumodith utpaadon kii sakriy suchi kaa anurakshan karata he
 It is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant market
 motor oil label ke peeche paath main aam taur par kuch OEM vinirdeshnon kii suchi hoti he, jaise ki MB, MAN, Volvo, Cummins, VW, BMW yaa anya
 vinirmaataaon ke paas unke dwaara nirmit vividh injanon ke liye behad alag vinirdesh ho sakate hai; ek puri tarah se anya ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa he
 The lubricant marketer claims benefits for the customer based on the superior performance of the lubricant
 is tarah ke vipanan glamras vigyapanon, khaas khel kaaryakramon ke praayojan or andorsement dwaara samarthit hote hai
 Unfortunately widespread performance claims are common in the consumer market, making verification difficult or impossible for a specific consumer
 B2B bazaar main vipanak se saamanyatya unke daavon kaa samarthan karne vaale data ko darshane kii aashaa kii jaati he, jisase vyapak daavon kaa istemaal kam ho sake
 nishpaadan badhanaa, tut-foot or indhan kaa upbhog ghataana bhi baad ke API, ACEA or car nirmaataaon ke oil vinirdeshnon kaa lakshya rahaa he, jisase lubricant vipanak vyapak pareekshanon dwaara apane daavon kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 The market claims that their lubricant maintains its performance for a long period
 udhaaharan ke liye upabhokta bazaar main, ek theth motor oil parivartan antaraal lagbhag 3,000–6,000 mile ke aas-paas he
 Lubricant marketers can offer a lubricant that lasts 12,000 miles or more to persuade the user to pay a premium
 aam taur par, upabhokta ko lambey samay or lubricant nirmaataa dwaara prastut varantiyon ko sambhavya upkaran nirmaataa varantiyon kii kshati ke bare main samay-anusuchee kaa anupaalan na karne ke anusaran dwaara jaanchane yaa santulan karne kii zarurat hogi

5 specification oil up to 3x longer
 dhyaan den ki oil dren antaraal car nirmaataa vinirdesh ke anuroop indhan ke saath nae ingine ke liye maanya he
 When low grade fuel is used, or an older engine, the oil change interval should be reduced accordingly
 Common oils approved for extended use are of high specification and minimize spoilage
 audyogic bazaar main dderghaayu ko aam taur par samay kii ikaayiyon main mapa jaataa he or unke daawey pramanit na hone kii sthiti main lubricant vipanak ko baari vittiya jurmaana bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Lubricant marketers claim advanced equipment efficiency compared to anti-products or technologies, a claim that can generally be valid when comparing high-grade lubricants with previous grades
 In general, efficiency is proved by showing a reduction in the cost of energy to operate the system
 unnat dakshata kii guarantee dena, deazal injanon ke liye API CI-4 Plus jaise kuch tel pareekshan vinirdeshon kaa lakshya hota he
 Some car / engine manufacturers also request some higher efficiency levels of lubricant, especially for extended drain intervals
 lubricant ke liye daawa kiya gaya ki vah vishisht parichaalan pariveshon kii jaruraton se nipat saktaa he
 Some common environments include dry, wet, cold, hot, fire risk, high load, high or low speed, chemical compatibility, atmospheric compatibility, pressure or vacuum and various combinations
 The general thermal characteristics are outlined with SAE viscosities given for 100 ° c such as SAE 30, SAE 40
 kam taapmaana chipchipepan ke liye SAE xxw nishaan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example both markings can be joined together to form SAE 0W-60
 chipchipaapan suchakank taapmaana ke saath chipchipaapan parivartan ankit karata he, jahaan ucch VI sankhya adhik taapmaana sthirataa ke liye he
 Marketers offer either the same grade or a similar price at a lower price than rivals, which will serve the purpose for a lower price
 Alternatives are proposing a more expensive lubricant and may promise less spoilage, specific fuel consumption or return at longer drain intervals
 lubricant ko paryaavaran anukool kaha gaya he
 This is generally supported by qualifications of qualifying statements or generally accepted approvals
 duniya bhar main kai sanghathan, aam taur par sarkaar pryojit, aise lubricanton kii paryaavarniya jokhim ke liye unke moolyankan dwaara visheshta bataane or anumodith karne ke liye maujuud hai
 Generally, lubricant manufacturers are permitted to indicate such approval by showing some special mark
 udaahranon main shaamil hai german "blue angil", europea "dezi" paristhitiki label, vaishvik paristhitiki label "GEN mark", nordic, "white swen", japani "arth frendli mark"; sanyukt raashtra america "green sil", canadai "environmental choiz", chini "huaan", singapore "green label" or francisi "NF environment mark"
 Marketers claim a new structure of lubricant that will improve some concrete performance compared to its rivals
 The technology is generally protected through formal patents or other intellectual property protection mechanisms to prevent copying by rivals
 is kshetra main anek daawey bahut saral vipanan gunjaar shabd hai, kyonki unamem se zyaadaatar nirmaataa vishisht prakriyaaon se jude hai lekin pratispardhaa ke liye trademark kaa upyog nishiddh he
 The marketer claims extensive superior quality of its lubricant without factual evidence
 gunvattta prasiddh brands, khilaadi, racing team, kuch peshewar andorsement yaa kuch samaan vyaktiparak daawey ke sandarbh dwaara "siddh" he
 All motor oil labels have signs like "good quality" or "quality additive", the actual comparative evidence is not always there
 yah anumaan he ki sabhi lubricanton kaa 40% maahaul main jari hota he
 Disposal: Recycling, combustion, landfill and release into water can dispose of used lubricant
 saamanytah adhikansh deshon main zamin main bharaai or pani main chhod kar nipataane ke sambandh main sakht vinium hai kyonki lubricant kii choti maatra bhi pani ke bade bhandar ko dooshit kar saktaa he
 Many regulations allow minimum levels of lubricants that are present in waste streams and companies spend tens of thousands of dollars annually to bring their wastewater to acceptable levels
 lubricant ko maujuud yojak ke apekshaakrit ucch str ke kaaran aam taur par bijli utpann karne ke liye indhan ke rup main jalaana bhi viniyamon dwaara sanchalit he
 Burning produces ash enriched with both airborne pollutants and toxins, mainly heavy metal compounds
 Thus lubricant combustion occurs in specialized facilities with special markers for the removal of airborne pollutants and access to landfill with permits for handling of toxic ash
 durbhaagya se, adhikansh lubricant saamaanya janata dwaara zamin par, naalon main or bharaai vaali bhoomi main kachare ke rup main chhodane kii vajah se sidhe paryaavaran main pravesh karte hai
 Other direct contamination sources include falling off roadways, accidental scattering, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages
 Improvement in filtration technology and processes has now made recycling a viable option
 Generally, various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and obtain the base oil
 prakriya ke dauraan tel kaa parishkaran ho saktaa he
 This base oil is later processed in the same way as virgin base oil, although there is substantial reluctance to use recycled oils as they are considered inferior
 prayukt lubricanton se anshatah vaikum distild base stock ke gun sabhi prakritik telon se behatar hote hai, lekin unki laagat prabhaavashiltaa kai karkon par nirbhar karti he
 Used lubricants can also be used as refinery feedstock to be part of crude oil
 is upyog ke prati paryaapt anichhaa he kyonki yojak, kaalikh or toote-phute dhaatu is prakriya main gambhir vishaaktata / mahatvapurn utprerak ko niskriy banaati hai
 Restricts the cost to operate both, filtration and recrystallization

 Coins are usually made from a metal or a metal-like material and sometimes synthetic material, usually with a circular shape and are often issued by the government
 pratidin ke sikke ke sancharan se lekar badi sankhya main bullian sikke ke bhandaaran ke liye, vibhinn prakaar ke lenden main sikke kaa prayog paise ke rup main hota he
 In today's modern transactions, coins and banknotes are used as cash in modern money systems

 Over the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has generally exceeded the total value of the metal used to make them, but this has not always generally happened in the history of circulation of coins, sometimes circulation coins were made from precious metals
 Huh
 is apwaad se ki sikke kaa ankit mulya istemaal dhaatu ke kul mulya se adhik ho, kai baar "bullian sikkon" ko chaadeen or sone, moolyawaan dhaatuon main sangraahak yaa niveshak ke uddisht se banaae jate hai
 Examples of modern gold collector / investor coins include the American Gold Eagle printed by the United States, the Canada Gold Maple Leaf printed by Canada, the Krugerrand printed by South Africa
 american gold eagle kaa ankit mulya american $50 he or canada gold mapel lif sikke kaa ankit mulya nammaatr hi he ; lekin crugerrand kaa nahin he
 Historically, many coin metals and other materials have been used for practical, artistic, and experimentally produced circulation, collections, and metal investments, where bullion coins are often more for the quantity and purity of bullion coins than other bullions
 Collections are done in a convenient way
 lambey samay se sikke paise kii avadharana se jude hue hai, jaisaa ki yah tathy parilakshith he ki "sikaa" or "mudra" shabd samanarthak he
 Coins are also names in fictional currencies

 If a coin lacks all of these, it is unlikely that its value will be high
 bullian sikkon ke mulya in karkon par bhi aadhaarit hai, lekin mote taur par un main sone yaa chaandi ke mulya ke aadhaar par ise mahatv diya jaataa he
 Canada Maple Leaf and American Gold Eagle are sometimes monetized for values below the metal price, like non-monetized bullion coins, but these coins are never monetized for transmission purposes, these value numbers are not market but official values
 Are for vartmaan main adhiktar sikke aadhaar dhaatu se banaae jate he or unke mulya unke aadhikarik paise kii sthiti ke rup main aate hai
 This means that the value of the coin is ordered by the official official and thus in international trade arbitrage it is determined by the free market as national currencies
 yahi kaaran he ki kagaji mudra kii tarah sikke bhi maudrik token ke samaan hai, jabaki kagaji mudra sidhe dhaatu dwaara samarthit nahin hai balki saamaan yaa sevaaon ke antarrashtriya vinimay ke liye sarkaar isaki guarantee detii he
 Some people have suggested that such a coin should not be considered "real coin"
 However, due to official money being backed by government guarantees for certain goods and services, its value determines free exchange currency exchange rates, in the same way that international market exchange rates determine the value of a metal backed by commodity money
 , Practically there are very few economic differences between these two funds
 sikkon ko is tarah se mudrit kiya jaataa he ki iskaa aadhikarik mulya uske ghatak dhaatu ke mulya se kam ho, lekin sikke ke sancharan ke liye yah jaanboojhkar or praarambhik rup se nahin kiya jaataa or baad main sikke ke utpaadan ke itihaas main mudrasphiti ke kaaran, bazaar main dhaatu ke aadhikarik mulya sikke ke ghoshit ankit mulya se aage bad jate hai

 According to other numerologists, the earliest coins were the coins of Aegina Chelone which were minted by the local people of Aegina or King Fides of Argos around 700–550 BC
 a unique electrum of Aegina is the ancient Greek coinage at the Bibliothic National, Paris

 The ancient Greeks spread the Anatolia practice and extended it to commerce and trade
 Monetization took place only after Greek colonization and its impact first around the Mediterranean and later in North Africa, Syria, Persia and the Balkans
 pratham lidian sikkon ko electrum, sone or chaandi ke prakritik rup se paae jane vaale ek mishrit dhaatu se banaaya gaya tha jise aage chalakar atirikt chaandi or tambe ke saath mishrit kiya gaya
 Very soon Lydian and Greek coins undoubtedly began to be minted under the authority of private individuals and thus began to be used more for tokens or tamagas than for real coins, however, it is clear from the numbers that some of them were issued by the state official It is often mentioned that Lydia's king, Aliyatse, was the promoter of monetization
 
 Most early Lydian coins had no writing, only an image of a symbolic animal known as a "legend" or "inscription"

 Artemis of Anatolia was named Potnia Theron which translates to "mistress of animals" and its symbol was lion and tiger
 praarambhik lidian unani sikkon ke kuch pratishat main khyaati praapt vyakti hote the
 a famous early Electrum coin, currently considered to be the oldest inscribed coin, is from Caria near Asia Minor
 is sikke par unani khyaati praapt hai jise "phenos emi sema" padhaa jayega jiskaa anuwaad kuch isprakaar he "main phaness kaa billaa hum" yaa "main prakaash kaa sanket hum" yaa ho saktaa he "main prakaash kii kabr hum" yaa "main phaness kii kabr hum"

 Although only seven Phanes coins were found in the search, it is also notable that 20% of the early Electrum coins had lion signs and sun blossoms
 Alternatively it is stated that the excavated Phanes were probably soldiers of the Halicarnassian tenement of Amasis, as stated by Herodotus, who survived the Cambyses court and guided them in the invasion of Egypt in 527 or 525 BCE
