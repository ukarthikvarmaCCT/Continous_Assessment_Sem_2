 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1
 Satisfaction of curiosity or elimination of doubts about your familiar language
 2
 aitihaasik tathaa pragaitihaasik samskruti kaa parichay
 3
 Introduction to mental development of any caste or entire humanity
 4

 7
 Assistance in the development and manufacture of translation and self-typing and similar machines
 8
 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's age and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used
 parinamswaroop bhashavigyaan ke kshetra main ganitagyon, bhautikashastriyon or enginiaron kaa purna sahyog apekshit ho gaya he
 With the help of the artificial palate and artificial palate projectors, the pronunciation space of the unmarked swans is tested by the individual
 kaaymograph swaanon kaa ghoshnatv or pranatv nirdhaaran karne anunasikta or kaalamaatra jaanane ke liye upyogi he
 Laryngeal scope studies the position of the larynx
 endoscope laringoscope kaa hi sudhara rup he
 The waves of the oscillograph imprint the physical appearance of the swans on the screen or on the film with great clarity
 yahi kaam spectograph yaa sonograph dwaara adhik safalataa se kiya jaataa he
 The images that the spectrograph presents can be heard again by pattern playback
 spichstrechar kii sahaayta se ricard kii hui saamagree ko dhimi gati se suna ja saktaa he
 Apart from these, there are other small and large instruments, from which adequate help is being taken in linguistic studies
 francisi bhashavaigyanikon main ruiyo ne swanvigyaan ke prayogon ke vishay main granth likhaa tha
 In London, Prof
 Firth developed a special palate
 swaron ke maapan ke liye jaise swaratrikon yaa chatushkon kii rekhaayen nirdhaarit kii gai hai, vaise hi inhone vyanjanon ke maapan ke liye aadhaar rekhaon kaa nirupan kiya, jinke dwaara uccharan sthanon kaa thik thik varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc
 idhar ek nayaa yantric prayaas aarambh hua he jiskaa sambandh shabdaawalee, arthtatv tathaa vyakaranik roopon se he
 The use of electrical computers for mechanical translation is a special feature of the scientific era
 yah anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kaa atyant rochak or upadey vishay he

 We consider the following function sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if the second derivative is positive or negative at both points
 nimnlikhit falan ko lete hai- Let's find the first derivative of: falan kaa dwitiya avkalaj yah he: Keeping the first derivative zero, the value of x gives the following: x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}={ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan rinatmak he, atah x=x_1 par is falan kaa ucchisht he
 Similarly we see that the value of the second derivative of the function at x 2 = - 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = - { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 4 } is positive, so the function at x_2 The following is nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karen jiskaa graph saamne diya gaya he- First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki yah dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Therefore, we conclude that this function has neither high nor low

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 was amended in 1995, 1999 and 2002 to cater to the changing needs of the securities market and to respond to the developments in the securities market
 2 disambar 2002 ko sanyukt sansadeey samiti kii report ke aadhaar par sebi adhinium ke praavdhaanon main kuch kamiyon ko puraa karne ke liye is adhinium ko sanshodhit kiya gaya
 SEBI aims to make India one of the best securities markets in the world and SEBI as one of the most respected regulators in the world
 sebi ioessio / ethesaypi ke maanakon ko hasil karne kaa bhi prayaas karata he
 In this backdrop, an internal group constituted by SEBI consisting of senior officials had proposed some amendment in the SEBI Act
 sebi board ne in prastaavon par vichaar karne ke liye nyaayamurti shri em
 ech
 kania kii adhyakshata main ek visheshgy samooh kaa gathan kiya tha
 It has been introduced to receive public comment on the suggestions made in the report of this expert group
 dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki yah report anivaary rup se vibhinn prastaavon or sujhaavon par sebi ke vichaaron ko pratibimbit nahin karti he
 SEBI will consider comments received from various sources before taking any final decision on those suggestions
 world bank or international monatory fund ne imef kii dwipaksheeya chaukasee or world bank ke vittiya kshetra ke vikaas kaary ke sandarbh main vittiya pranaaliyon kii nigaraanee vyavastha ko majboot karne ke liye financial services acesment program naamak ek maandand sthapit kiya he
 The FSAP is designed to help countries increase their defenses against crises and cross-border effects and accelerate development by promoting financial system soundness and financial sector diversity
 sebi kaa lakshya bharat ko duniya kaa ek behtareen pratibhuti bazaar or sebi ko duniya kaa ek sabase sammanit niamak bananaa he
 SEBI strives to achieve the standards of IOSCO / FSAP
 pratibhuti kanoon or khaas taur par sebi adhinium main sanshodhan karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi jisase bharat or sebi ko uparokt uddeshy ko praapt karne main suvidha hogi
 It is in this backdrop that the SEBI Board has also identified the deficiencies / anomalies of the existing provisions of the SEBI Act and the SEBI Act more in keeping with the suggestions of the JPC as suggested by other expert groups constituted by SEBI from time to time
 An expert group is also formed to suggest new provisions that may be included in this Act to make it effective and investor friendly
 Had decided to
 5 agast 2004 ko yojit apni baithak main sebi board ne nimnlikhit sadasyon ko lekar visheshgy samooh kaa gathan kiya: a research paper with some suggestions for modifying the SEBI Act was prepared as a base material for the deliberations by the group
 kathith patr par sabhi hitdharakon or bazaar sahabhaagiyon ke pratinidhiyon kii tippanee or sebi adhinium main kiye jane vaale sanshodhano se sambandhit atirikt suzav praapt karne ke liye un pratinidhiyon ke paas is patr ko bhej diya gaya
 The names of the stakeholders who were asked to comment on this are given in its Annexure 'A'
 samooh ko praavdhaanon par kuch hitdharakon kii vistrut tippanee praapt hui jinke naam iske anulgnak 'bi' main die gaye hai
 Comments received from stakeholders on suggestions related to amendments of SEBI Act in various meetings held on 27 October 2004, 20 December 2004, 4 February 2005, 10 March 2005, 11 April 2005, 3 May 2005, 14 June 2005 and 15 June 2005 Keeping in mind the proposals related to the amendment of this Act were discussed
 I) sebi adhinium main nae praavdhaanon ko shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav
ii) maujuuda praavdhaanon main parivartan karne ke liye sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav
iii) anya adhiniyamon main parinami or sambandhit sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav
 '' first part ' pratibhutiyon main nivesh karne vaale niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha ke uddeshy se anya vishay-vastuon ke saath sebi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Investor education is more relevant in terms of the complexities associated with the various options and instruments of investments available in the securities market
 khudara niveshak is sthiti main nahin hai ki ve kuch sheyaron yaa yojanaon se jude jokhim karkon kii pahchaan or / yaa unki saraahna kar sake
 As a result they are not able to make known investment decisions
 chunki pratibhuti bazaar kaa vikaas kaaphi had tak niveshkon kii uchit shiksha par nirbhar karata he isliye sebi unamem jaagrukta failaane ke liye vachanabaddh he
 The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Securities Scam of 2001 suggested that the Investor Education and Protection Fund and rbi's Investor Education Resources set up under Section 205C of the Companies Act, to enable SEBI to run investor education and awareness campaigns smoothly
 SEBI should be provided and a joint campaign for investor education and awareness should be launched under the leadership of SEBI 
 samooh ke kaha ki zyaadaatar hitdharak sebi adhinium ke tahat ek alag niveshak sangrakshan kosh kii sthapana karne ke liye sahamat hai
 There has also been a suggestion from stakeholders that the said fund should be used exclusively for the purpose of investor education, organizing awareness programs and protecting the interests of investors
 samooh ne yah bhi kaha ki prastaavik niveshak sangrakshan kosh niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta ke uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye he
 With respect to the distribution of capital, transfer of securities and non-payment of dividends in the case of listed companies and companies desirous of listing their securities on the stock exchange, in terms of section 55A of the Companies Act, section 55A The provisions need to be put into effect
 iske alaava sebi ko niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha karne or soochibaddh companiyon dwaara niveshkon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye kiye jane vaale upayon ko lagu karne kii jarurat he
 Keeping in view the above provisions, the group also discussed the proposal related to payment of compensation to investors for the purpose of investor protection
 is sambandh main samooh ne dand swarup praapt raashi se niveshkon kii kshatipurti karne ke liye sanyukt rajya america ke sarbence oxle act 2002 ke tahat sthapit fere fund kii tarah ek fund kii sthapana karne ke suzav par bhi vichaar vimarsh kiya
 During the discussion another view was also held that equity market investors invest in risk capital and under the law no assured consideration or compensation can be given for non-fulfillment of every expectation
 haalanki companiyon yaa bichauliyon dwaara kii gai dhokhadhadi yaa galatabayani yaa jhuthe bayaan se sambandhit muaavje par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, the group said that PFRDA was allowed to set up a Subscriber Education and Protection Fund under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Ordinance 2004, which mandated the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority to protect the interests of the subscribers of pension fund schemes
 have provided
 kathith adhyadesh ke tahat us paise ko bhi vinirdeshit kiya gaya he jise kathith sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund main jamaa kiya janaa chahie
 According to the provision of the said ordinance, all the amounts recovered by the PFRDA as penalty under the ordinance will be deposited in the Subscriber Education and Protection Fund
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki niveshak shiksha or niveshak jaagrukta dwaara niveshak sangrakshan ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye sebi dwaara sanchalit karne ke liye piefardie adhyadesh 2004 ke tahat sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund kii tarah sebi adhium ke tahat ek alag fund kii sthapana kii ja sakati he or niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta ke liye sebi dwaara iskaa sanchaalan kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, small investors' compensation in relation to fraud or misrepresentation or false statements made by companies or middlemen may be considered as a subject of investor protection outside the alleged investor protection fund
 is sambandh main yah baat vaanchhneeya lag sakati he ki sebi chote niveshkon ke muaavje ke bhugtan or niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta ke uddeshy se niveshak sangrakshan kosh ke sanchaalan ke liye dishanirdesh or maandand nirdisht kar saktaa he
 In this regard, the guidelines issued by SEBI in relation to Investor Protection Fund of Stock Exchange can be adopted with necessary changes
 kathith niveshak sangrakshan kosh main jamaa kiye jane vaale paison ke sambandh ne samooh ne neshnal stock exange ke pratinidhitiv par dhyaan diya ki bade stock exange nirdhaarit uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye uchit tareeke se paison kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The group also said that the money lying in the IPF of small stock exchanges is not being used with full satisfaction
 mana jaataa he ki stock exenjon ke niveshak sangrakshan kosh main kaaphi samay se aprayukt pade hue paison ko prastaavit niveshak sangrakshan kosh main sthanantarit kar diya janaa chahie
 Unclaimed dividends and interest held in mutual funds and collective investment schemes or venture capital funds for more than 7 years and the unclaimed money or securities of customers with interest and middlemen should be used in a purposeful manner
 iske alaava sebi adhinium ke adhyay viie ke tahat nirnayan adhikari dwaara lagaae gaye jurmaane ke madhyam se vasuul kii gai sabhi raashiyon ko prastaavit niveshak sangrakshan kosh main jamaa kiya janaa chahie
 According to the Group's suggestion, SEBI Act, like the Customer Education and Protection Fund under the PFRDA Ordinance 2004 for the purpose of investor education and awareness and to compensate small investors in relation to fraud or misrepresentation or false statements made by companies or middlemen
 a separate Investor Protection Fund can be set up under it
 kathith kosh kaa sanchaalan sebi dwaara niveshkon kii raksha ke liye stock exenjon se sambandhit dishanirdeshon kii tarah sebi dwaara sthapit dishanirdeshon yaa nirdhaarit mandandon ke anusaar niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta or chote niveshkon kii kshatipurti kaa upaay karne ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 The amounts to be deposited in the said fund are: - a) Unclaimed dividend or interest lying in mutual funds and collective investment schemes or venture capital fund schemes for more than 7 years; b) Securities market for more than 7 years Any unclaimed money or securities of a customer lying with an intermediary of C; c) unutilized money in investor protection funds of stock exchanges; d) Chapter of SEBI Act All amounts recovered as monetary penalties under VIA

3 namakan suvidha namakan kii avadharana ko company adhinium 1956 kii dhara 109, banking niyaman adhinium 1949 kii dhara 45xede or utiai adhinium 1963 kii dhara 39e ke tahat manyata pradaan kii gai he
 Under the aforesaid provisions, the shareholder or debenture holder, depositor or unit holder candidate is entitled to the securities or money of the deceased, excluding all other persons, irrespective of any other law in force, including the law of will
 haalanki sebi adhinium main mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon ke unit dharakon ke liye is tarah kii namakan suvidha kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The Group stated that SEBI Regulations 1996 provide for nomination facility for unit holders
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki namakan kii suvidha kaa praavdhaan niveshkon ke liye anukool he lekin is tarah kaa praavdhaan mul adhinium main hona chahie na ki viniyamon main
 However, the group is not in favor of providing any overriding effect as provided under Section 109 of the Companies Act 1956 where the right of the candidate can defeat the claim of legal heir
 uparokt tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue samooh mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon ke unit dharakon ko namakan suvidha pradaan karne ke liye ek praavdhaan shaamil karne ke liye sebi adhinium main upyukt sanshodhan karne kii sifarish karti he
 The Group was informed that SEBI receives countless requests from various market participants for advance guidance on interpretation of the provisions of SEBI Act and Regulations
 chunki sebi adhinium main sebi ko agrim vinirnay pradaan karne kaa adhikaar dene ke liye iskar adhinium 1961 kii dhara 245bi se 245en kii tarah vishisht praavdhaan shaamil nahin he isliye sebi ne sebi yojana 2003 ke praavdhaanon ke tahat vyaakhyaatmak patr / 'koi karrwai nahin' patr pradaan karne kii ek pranali viksit kii he
 However, the guidelines under this scheme are not the same as the advance rulings given under the Income Tax Act as it is not binding on the SEBI Board
 pratibhuti bazaar ke liye agrim vinirnay se bazaar pratibhaagi ko vastav main prastaavit lenden se pehle uske liye pratibhuti kanoon ke vishesh praavdhaan kii prayojyata par baadhyatamoolak vinirnay praapt karne kii kshamta praapt karne kaa laabh praapt hoga
 The Group felt that the advance ruling system is certainly better than the informal guidance provided under the said scheme as the advance ruling provided by SEBI would be binding on its board
 badhyakaari prabhaav bazaar pratibhaagiyon ko keval adhik aaraam hi pradaan nahin karata he balki yah sampoorn kriyavidhi ko behatar kanoonee darja bhi pradaan karata he
 However, in view of the smooth and satisfactory functioning of the prevailing informal guidance scheme, the group felt that SEBI should analyze this option very carefully as a separate department like the Income Tax Act to take steps towards transfer of advance decisions from the scheme
 More infrastructure will have to be established
 samooh kaa suzav he ki chunki kanoonee taur par agrim vinirnay behatar he isliye uski sweekruti par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he or anaupchaarik maargdarshan yojana ko bhi jari rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The group said that Section 11 of the SEBI Act provides for the promotion and regulation of sros
 haalanki sebi adhinium main sadasyon ke pravesh ke liye vaidhanik shakti vaale upaniyamon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye esaro ke shashaktikaran kaa koi vishisht praavdhaan nahin he
 Further, despite being incorporated in the Companies Act 1956, the SEBI Act does not contain any provision relating to supersession of the Governing Board of the SRO by SEBI or limiting the franchisees of the members of the SRO
 sebi ko is tarah kii shakti pradaan karne ke liye is tarah ke sanshodhano kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 The group stated that SEBI has already formulated the Regulations i
e
 SEBI Regulations 2004 under Section 30 along with Section 11 of SEBI Act for regulation of sros for which sros along with all other entities are also required to get SEBI recognition
 Is required
 ye vinium esaro ko sebi ke anumodan ke saath niyamon or upaniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kii shakti bhi pradaan karata he
 Regulation 23 of the Regulations governing sros provides for the power to withdraw recognition to SEBI
 kathith shakti kii drushti se samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke paas pehle se hi esaro ko viniyamon ke anusaar apni gatividhiyon ko viniyamit karne ke liye majaboor karne kii apekshit shakti he
 Consequently, there is no need to amend the SEBI Act for this
 samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik sebi adhinium main prastaavit sanshodhan kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Regulations formulated by SEBI should be sufficient to address the concern of SEBI as a regulator of sros
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he jo sebi ko apane khud ke adeshon main spasht lipic yaa tankan trutiyon main sudhaar karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karata ho
 The view was also expressed that SEBI does not have the right to review its own orders even in cases when those orders are issued unilaterally
 samooh ne dekha ki "adeshon kii samiksha" un moulik shaktiyon ko pradaan karata hua prathit hota he jo aam taur par mul kshetradhikaar vaale praadhikariyon ke paas nahin hota he
 However, the Group felt that SEBI should be provided with the ability to correct clerical or typographical errors associated with its order, like Section 26 of the Rest of the Loan Amount Recovery Act, 1993
 bank evam vittiya santhaan baaki rin raashi vasuuli adhinium 1993 kii dhara 26 kii tarah sebi ko apane aadesh se judi lipic yaa tankan trutiyon ko thik karne kii kshamta pradaan karne ke liye isamen sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie
 The Group stated that the existing provisions of the SEBI Act do not entitle SEBI to enact retrospective effect regulations with limited purpose of providing relief to market participants
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko raahat pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se na ki nai dendariyon or jimmedaariyon kaa boj ladane ke uddeshy se iskar adhinium kii tarah prakriyaatmak maamalon yaa shulk prabhaar se sambandhit maamalon ke sambandh main purvyaapee prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kii shakti pradaan kii ja sakati he
 According to the group such a liberal provision may in some cases overcome the undue hardship of market participants and hence should be given positive attention
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar sebi ko simit raahat or laabh pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se na ki nai dendariyon or jimmedaariyon kaa boj ladane ke uddeshy se prakriyaatmak maamalon yaa shulk prabhaar se sambandhit maamalon ke sambandh main poorvvypit prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karne ke liye iskar adhinium 1961 kii dhara 295 ke anuroop sebi adhinium main sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 The group discussed the suggestion to reform the SEBI Act to provide an overriding effect to the SEBI Act on other laws in the case of securities
 is tarah ke sanshodhan kii jarurat kaa moolyankan karne ke liye samooh ne sebi adhinium ke un moulik praavdhaanon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kii jo ek adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak ho
 After due consideration, the group felt that there is no such fundamental provision in the SEBI Act that deserves an overriding effect
 samooh ne yah bhi kaha ki jahaan kahin moulik praavdhaan adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak the vahaan sebi adhinium ne pehle se hi gaiyr avine claj dwaara yah kaam kar liya he
 As per the recommendation of the group, the SEBI Act cannot be amended to provide an overriding effect to the SEBI Act over other laws
 samooh ne paripatron or dishanirdeshon ko jari karne ke liye sebi ko vaidhanik adhikaar pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium ke praavdhaanon main sudhaar karne ke prastaav kii jaanch kii
 The group said that SEBI has been issuing circulars and guidelines under section 11 of the Act
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke anternihit adhikaron ke strot dhara 11 ke maujuuda praavdhaanon ke tahat paripatron yaa dishanirdeshon ko jari karne main koi kanoonee dikkat nahin he
 As per the recommendation of the group, it cannot be amended to include a specific provision in the SEBI Act for issuing circulars and guidelines as SEBI already has the inherent right to do so under Section 11 of the SEBI Act 
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki pratibhutiyon ke kapatpurna nirgaman or pratibhutiyon ke atyadhik ke amurtikaran ityadi ke maamalon main sebi ko is tarah ke lendenon ko shunya ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 In the event of violation of any specific regulation, suitable provisions should be made in the SEBI Act like Section 9 and Section 14 of SCRA to declare such transactions void
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki is tarah kii shakti kaa prayog kisi swatantra nikaay khaas taur par naagarik adaalaton dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Such authority cannot be delegated to administrative bodies
 die gaye prastaav ke tahat sebi adhinium ko sanshodhit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Such power or authority should be left exclusively to the civil court
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki ioessio / ethesaypi ke vinirdeshon ke anusaar pratibhuti viniyamon kaa ek siddhant yah he ki niveshkon kii kshati or haani ko kam karne or vyavasthit jokhim ko shaamil karne ke liye bazaar ke kisi bichauliye kii vifaltaa se nipatane kii prakriya kaa intjaam hona chahie
 The group said that under the SEBI Act to take steps for winding up of such intermediaries if any middleman is deemed to be bankrupt or the continuation of such intermediary is detrimental to the interest of investors or customers of such intermediaries
 No special rights have been conferred on
 samooh ne kaha ki bhartiya reserve bank ke paas arabiai adhinium kii dhara 45 emasi ke tahat gaiyr banking vitt company ke khilaaf samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa adhikaar he
 The group felt that SEBI should have the equivalent right to file a winding up petition under the SEBI Act
 iske alaava samooh ne dekha ki is tarah kii madhyasth company ke samaapan ke maamle main anya daavon yaa karjon par arthath surakshit lendaaron or samprabhu praadhikariyon jaise iskar par bhi is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke daawey ko variyata di jaani chahie
 In this regard, the Group stated that under Section 43A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, there is a provision to give preference to preferential payment of depositors to all other debts of the assets of the banking company
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko kisi bichauliye ke diwalia hone yaa is tarah ke bichauliye kii nirantarata ko niveshkon yaa is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke hit ke liye hanikaarak maane jane par is tarah ke bichauliye ke khilaaf samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karte samay madhyasth companiyon ke graahakon ke daavon ke sambandh main bhi isi tarah ke praavdhaan kiye jane chahie
 As per the recommendation of the group, suitable provision can be made in the SEBI Act to enable SEBI to file a winding up petition in respect of intermediary companies on the lines of Section 45 MC of the Reserve Bank of India Act and Section 43A of the Banking Regulation Act
 samooh ne kaha pratibhuti bazaar viniyamon ke liye ek ioessio siddhant yah he ki niamak pranali ke madhyam se niveshkon ke dhan ko anya sansthaaon kii parisampattiyon se alag rakhana chahie
 In addition, investors should be protected from deceptive activities, manipulation or fraud, including insider trading, front running or trading in front of clients and misuse of client assets
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki pratibhuti kanoon vidheyak 2003, ek dhara 27bi ko pratibhuti anubandh adhinium main shaamil karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya tha jiske tahat ek niveshak apane paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko kisi aisi madhyasth company ko saunp sake jiske paas is tarah ke paise yaa pratibhutiyaan hongi or jo niveshkon ke nirdesh ke anusaar unka istemaal karegaa
 Such money or securities shall not be a part of the assets of the intermediary companies and such assets of the investors shall not be seized by any authority or any authority shall have any relationship with such assets
 haalanki pratibhuti kanoon adhinium 2005 main yah praavdhaan shaamil nahin tha
 The group stated that the money or securities handed over by an investor to an intermediary company should be held by the trusting intermediary company of such investors
 niveshkon ke aise paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko madhyasth company kii parisampatti kaa hissaa nahin banaaya janaa chahie or niveshkon kii in parisampattiyon ko kisi praadhikari dwaara jabt nahin kiya jayega yaa unke saath kisi bhi praadhikari kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin hoga jo aisi madhyasth company ke sangrakshan yaa kabje main ho
 As per the recommendation of the group, the SEBI Act should have a special provision under which the customers 'money or securities should be held by the intermediary companies as a trust and any possession of any authority over the investors' assets held by the intermediary company
 Or there will be no transaction
 is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye pratibhuti kanoon vidheyak 2003 main prastaavit praavdhaan ko pesh kiya ja saktaa he

 This is where the huge personality of Napoleon emerges
