 Ram is highly revered and an ideal man, especially in North India

 Sri Ram's father Dasharatha had pledged his step-mother Kaikeyi to fulfill any of his two wishes
 kaikeyi ne daasi manthra ke bahekaave main aakar in varon ke rup main raja dasharath se apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajsinghaasana or ram ke liye chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas maanga
 Rama happily accepted fourteen years of exile to protect his father's word

 Many festivals of Hinduism, such as Dussehra, Ram Navami and Deepawali, are associated with the life story of Rama
 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened

 At that time Rama's other two brothers Bharata and Shatrughna had gone to their maternal aunt Kaikeya

 If you are the beloved queen of the king then your child should become the king, but King Dasharatha wants Ram to be the king
 ram ke bachapan kii vistaar-purvak vivaran swami tulsidas kii ramcharitamanas ke balkand se milti he
 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata

 At the time of exile, Ravana killed Sita
 ravan ek rakshas tathaa lanka kaa raja tha
 According to the Ramayana, Sita got distraught after hearing the voice of a deer when Rama, Sita and Lakshmana were in the hut
 vah hiran ravan kaa mamaa marich tha
 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita
 Maricha takes Sri Ram too far
 mauka milte hi shriram ne tir chalaaya or hiran bane marich kaa vadh kiya
 While dying, Marich shouted "O Sita! o Laxman!" Made a sound of Sita got worried after hearing that voice and she asked Lakshmana to go to Shri Ram
 Laxman did not want to go, but could not deny his sister-in-law
 lakshmana ne jane se pehle ek rekha khinchi, jo lakshmana rekha ke naam se prasiddh he
 Rama, along with his brother Lakshmana, wandered in search of Sita
 tab ve hanuman or sugriv naamak do vaanron se mili
 Hanuman became the biggest devotee of Rama
 sita ko ko punah praapt karne ke liye bhagwan ram ne hanuman, vibhishana or vanar sena kii madad se raawan ke sabhi bandhu-baandhvon or uske vanshajon ko parajeet kiya tathaa lautate samay vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja banaakar achche shaasha ke liye maargdarshan kiya

 Samudra Manthan is a famous Hindu religious legend
 yah katha bhagwat puraana, mahabharat tathaa vishnu puraana main aati he
 Shri Shukdev Ji said, "O Rajan! In the kingdom of King Bali, demons, demons and demons had become very strong
 unhen shukracharya kii shakti praapt thi
 Meanwhile, Devraj Indra became powerless due to the curse of Durvasa Rishi
 daityaraj bali kaa rajya teenon lokon par tha
 The gods including Indra were afraid of him
 is sthiti ke nivaaran kaa upaay keval baikunthanath vishnu hi bataa sakate the, atah brahma ji ke saath samast devtaa bhagwaan narayan ke paas pahuche
 Praising him, he narrated his calamity to Lord Vishnu
 tab bhagwaan madhur vaani main bole ki is samay tum logon ke liye sankat kaal he
 Demons, demons and demons are getting uplifted and you people are getting downgraded
 kintu sankat kaal ko maitreepurn bhav se vyateet kar dena chaiye
 You befriend the demons and churn the Kshira Sagar and drink nectar from it and drink it
 daityon kii sahaayta se yah kaary sugamawa se ho jaayegaa
 Accept their every condition for this work and in the end take out your work
 amrit pikar tum amar ho jaaoge or tumme daityon ko maarane kaa samarthy aa jaayegaa
 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti
 vasuki ke netra se netag kaa udbhav hua
 Lord Vishnu himself took the Kachhap avatar and placed Mandarachal mountain on his back and became its base
 bhagwaan narayan ne daanav rup se daanvon main or devtaa rup se devataaon main shakti kaa sanchaar kiya
 By giving deep sleep to Vasuki Nag too, he defeated his suffering
 devtaa vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney lage
 The demons, demons, demons and demons with vomiting intellect thought that there would be some benefit in catching Vasuki Nag from his mouth
 unhone devataaon se kaha ki ham kisi se shakti main kam nahin hai, ham munh kii ore kaa sthaan lenge
 Then the gods took the place on the tail side of Vasuki Nag
 "samudr manthan armbh hua or bhagwaan kacchap ke ek lakh yojan chaudee peeth par mandarachal parvat ghoomane laga
 Hey Rajan! The first to speak of sea churning was the poison of water
 us vish kii jwaala se sabhi devtaa tathaa daitya jalane lage or unki kaanti feeki padane lagi
 Everyone prayed to Lord Shankar on this
 unki prarthana par mahadev ji us vish ko hatheli par rakh kar use pi gayi kintu use kanth se neeche nahin utarane diya
 Due to the effect of that Kalkut poison, Shiva's gorge turned blue
 isiliye mahadev ji ko nilkantha kehete hai
 a little poison had dripped from his palm on the earth, which poisonous animals like snakes, scorpions, took
 "vish ko shankar bhagwaan ke dwaara paan kar lene ke pashchaat phir se samudr manthan prarambh hua
 The second jewel came out the Kamadhenu cow, which was kept by the sages
 phir ucchanshrava ghoda niklaa jise daityaraj bali ne rakh liya
 After that Airavat elephant came out which was taken by Devraj Indra
 airavat ke pashchaat kaustubhamani samudr se nikali use vishnu bhagwaan ne rakh liya
 Then Kalpavriksha came out and Apsara named Rambha emerged
 in donon ko devloak main rakh liya gaya
 Next, Lakshmi came out from churning the sea
 lakshmi ji ne swayan hi bhagwaan vishnu ko var liya
 After that Varuni appeared in the form of a girl whom the demons assumed
 phir ek ke pashchaat ek chandramaa, parijaat vriksh tathaa shankh nikle or ant main dhanvantari vaidya amrit kaa ghat lekar prakat huye
 "the demons snatched the nectar from Dhanvantari's hand and started fighting for it among themselves
 devataaon ke paas durvasa ke shaapvash itani shakti rahi nahin thi ki ve daityon se ladakar us amrit ko le saken isaliye ve niraash khadey huye unka aapas main ladanaa dekhte rahe
 Seeing the despair of the Gods, Lord Vishnu immediately took the form of Mohini and reached the demons fighting among themselves
 us vishwamohini rup ko dekhakar daitya tathaa devataaon kii to baat hi kya, swayan brahmagyani, kaamdev ko bhasma kar dene vaale, bhagwaan shankar bhi mohit hokar unki ore baar-baar dekhne lage
 When the demons saw that new young girl coming towards them, then they forgot all their quarrel and started looking at the beautiful girl and looked at them
 ve daitya bole, "he sundari! tum koun ho? lagata he ki hamaare jhagade ko dekhakar uskaa nibatara karne ke liye hi ham par krupa kataaksh kar rahi ho
 Come on! You are welcome
 hamen apane sundar kar kamalon se yah amritpan karaao
 Vishnu as Vishnu Mohini said, "O gods and demons!" Due to being the son of Maharishi Kashyap ji, both of you are brother and brother, yet you fight with each other
 main to swechhacharini stri hoon
 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras became even more confident in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat down among the gods after making the form of a deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra
 amrit ke prabhaav se uske sir or dhad rahu or ketu naam ke do grah ban kar antariksh main sthapit ho gayi
 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred
 is tarah devataaon ko amrit pilaakar bhagwaan vishnu vahaan se lop ho gayi
 The demise of the demons ended soon after their disappearance
 ve atyant krodhit ho devataaon par prahaar karne lage
 The fierce Devasur war started in which Devraj Indra defeated Daityaraj Bali and withdrew his Indralok

 Tomar or Tanwar was a Gurjar Vansh of northwest India
 tomaro kaa maananaa he ki ve chandravanshi he
 He founded the present Delhi with the name of Dihilika
 puraanon se prathit hota he ki aarambh main tomaron kaa nivas himalay ke nearesth kisi uttari pradesh main tha
 But by the 10th century they had reached Karnal
 thaneshwar main bhi inkaa rajya tha
 At that time, there was the kingdom of Gurjara Pratihara Rajavansh of Kanyakubj in North India

 The timing of his authority in Delhi is uncertain

 tantrapal tomars chouhan vaakpati se parajeet hua
 Singharaj, the son of Vakpati, killed Tomresh Salvan
 kintu chouhan singhraj bhi kuch samay ke baad maaraa gaya
 It is possible that the Tomars had some involvement in the death of Singharaj
 aisa prathit hota he ki tomars is samay dilli ke swami ban chuke the
 The 12 villages of Tanwar Gurjaro are in the vicinity of Delhi Fatehpur The Tomar dynasty of delhi-thaneshwar was in a fairly advanced state during the initial invasions of the Ghaznavi dynasty

 In 1038 AD Mahmud's son Masood took over Hansi
 masood ke putr majdood ne thaneshwar ko hastgat kiya
 Preparations were started to attack Delhi
 aisa prathit hota tha ki musalmaan dilli rajya kii samaapti kiye bina chaiyn na lenge
 But the Tomars acted with courage
 tomarsraj mahipal ne keval haansi or thaneshwar ke durg hi hastgat na kiye; uski vir vahini ne kongde par bhi apni vijayadhvaja kuch samay ke liye fahraa di
 Lahore also survived fortunately
 tomaron kii is vijay se keval vidveshagni hi bhadki
 Tomars were attacked from here and there
 tanwaron ne inkaa yathashakti uttar diya
 From the Parshaanatharcharita of Sridhar Kavi, composed in Samvat 1189, it appears that the capital of the Tomars at that time was Delhi's prosperous city and Tanvaraj Anangpal was famous everywhere due to his bravery and qualities
 dwitiya anangpal ne mehroli ke louh stambh kii dilli main sthapana kii
 It was probably during this king that the towers changed their policy
 bisaldev tritiy na sanwat 1208 main tomaron ko haraa kar dilli par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, Tanwar ruled as the feudatories of the Chauhans in Delhi

 In Hindi, in the last letter, there is a practice of being halant without writing

 We do not need to put a halant at the end of the word because it is assumed that there is a halant at the end of the word

 Therefore, if the name of Thiruvananthapuram is transliterated from Malayalam, it is Thiruvananthapuram
 hindi main halant lagane kii aavashyakta to nahin he par chunki ye naam dakshin bhartiya he isliye isamen halant laga liya jaataa he
 In addition to this, some people use the long form, ie, Thiruvananthapuram instead of Harsva Ukaar, which is impure both in terms of transliteration and pronunciation
 dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon main t ke swar ko angrezi main Th se likhaa jaataa he, kyonki ise t likhane se, t kii maatra ke saath vibhed nahin ho paata he
 But many people transliterate this English word into Hindi and write it as "thiruvananthapuram" but it is wrong

 kisi ucch adhikari dwaara adhinsth adhikari ko vishisht satta evam adhikaar pradaan karnaa pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 This is one of the basic concepts of management
 dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki kaary ke parinaam ke liye vahi vyakti jimmedaar hota he jo us kaary ko sampadit karne ke liye apane adhikaar duusare ko saunpta he
 As a result of the delegation, the subordinate is able to make decisions
 duusari taraf adhikari kaa bhaar kuch kam ho jaataa he
 That is, delegation is an internal administrative process to prevent unnecessary stagnation of powers and responsibilities at various levels in an administrative organization
 ucchadhikari adhinsthon par niyantran, nirikshan or paryvekshan kaa praadhikaar apane hi paas rakhata he
 The officer transferring power cannot be free from his responsibilities and accountability
 duusare arthon main pratyaayojan adhinsthon ko kaary baantkar unase sampann karwaane kaa ek tarika he
 Delegation is an important feature of an administrative organization
 pratyaayojan ke abhaav main koi bhi prashasnic sanghathan sugamawapurvak apane nirdhaarit uddeshy kii prapti nahin kar saktaa
 Delegation is known by many names like transfer, deauthorization, repatriation, or subordinate delegation
 pratyaayojan, angreji shabd Delegation kaa hindikaran he jo Delegate se bana he
 It means 'representative'
 vartmaan samay bade sanghathanon kaa samay he
 Organizations are not only large, their work processes have also become complex
 sanghathan ke prayek str par karyrat karmchaariyon ke paas kaary kii aadhikyata hoti ja rahi he
 In particular, the workload at higher levels of organizational footing is becoming so high that the higher authorities are unable to dispose them according to the demands of the organization resulting in the problem of organizational delay
 sanghathan main pratyaayojan kaa siddhanth mulat: upar se neeche kii ore adhikaron evam dayitvon ke aavanton se sambandhit he
 Therefore, along with organizational complexity and development, the need for delegation is also increasing which is useful for every organization

 white ke anusaar, Scholars have periodically defined delegation as follows: moonay ke anusaar According to Millett, duglas si
 basil ke shabdon main, George R
 According to Terry, vibhinn paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par pratyaayojan ke bare main likhit kuch visheshtaon ko nirdisht kiya ja saktaa he jo nimnlikhit hai: Authorized to work independently: With the help of delegation, an administrator in the organization is given the opportunity to work independently while staying within the limits set by the senior officer
 lekin us seemaa main kaary kartesamay svachhnd tareeke se vyavhaar nahin kar saktaa
 With the help of delegation, the constitution, policy of organization, rules, bye-laws etc
 get the right to exercise discretion in the structure and limits
 pratyaayojan kala he : prashasnic sanghathan ke antargat kis adhikari ko, kab or kitni satta deni he tathaa kis prakaar niyantran sthapit kiya janaa he, iskaa nirdhaaran pratyaayojan karanevaala adhikari hi karata he
 Delegation is written or unwritten and of a specific or general nature: Delegation in an administrative organization can be either written or unwritten
 kaary kii drushti se sanghathan main pratyaayojan jitna likhit hota he utani hi spashtataa bani rahati he
 But most of the delegated part remains practically unwritten
 jab santhnik lakshyon ke liye vishisht kaarividhi nirdhaarit kar di jaati he to use vishisht pratyaayojan kaha jaataa he or jab lakshya nirdhaarit hote hue bhi kaarividhi nirdhaarit na ho to use saamaanya prakruti kaa pratyaayojan kaha jaataa he
 Not delegated full power: No person can delegate his entire authority, but only delegated in partial quantity
 doharaa swaroop : pratyaayojan apane kaary evam adhikaar dusron ko saunpta avashya he kintu bahut se adhikaar apane paas rakhata bhi he
 In the words of Terry, this process is the same as when sharing knowledge to others, others also get knowledge and the person sharing also has knowledge
 satta saunpane ke pashwaat kam-zyada kii ja sakati he or waapas bhi lee ja sakati he : pratyaayojan apni prakruti main sthaayee nahin hota he
 While it can be amended
 use kam yaa zyada kiya ja saktaa he yaa waapas liya ja saktaa he
 It all depends on the situation, task and requirement
 koi bhi ucch adhikari nimnaankit kaary pratyyojit nahin kar saktaa he – Mohit Bhattacharya has explained the process of delegation in this way - pratyaayojan vikendrikaran, hastantaran or visankendran se bhinn he, jinase praadhikaar ke sthaanantaran kaa arth bhi nikalataa he
 Decentralization is based on administrative proceedings, transfer political and judicial proceedings and decentralization is based on political legal and administrative proceedings
 jaise–panchayat raaj kaa arth vikendrikaran he, jabaki jila colector ke karyaalay kaa arth visankendran he, kendra se rajyon ko praadhikaar kaa sthaanantaran hastantaran he
 In order for any organization to operate effectively so that it can achieve its desired objectives, it is necessary that the powers it receives are divided and transferred among the various personnel working at different levels

 hwite ne likhaa he ki The following facts have greatly increased the need for delegation and these facts also explain the importance of delegation: sheeghra nirnay ke liye : prashaskeey sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kuch aise kaary hote he jinamein sheeghra nirnay lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The delegation of power simplifies this task as subordinates are also given the right to take decisions in a limited area
 chote–chote kaaryon ke sambandh main turant nirnay le liye jate hai
 Sometimes some emergency situations arise in administrative organizations that require emergency decision
 apane mukhyalay se aadesh praapt karne main itnaa samay lag jaataa he ki bahut der ho chuki hoti he, at: aisi paristhiti main pratyyojit adhikari sheeghra nirnay lene main samarth hote hai
 Economy and efficiency: Delegation leads to quicker decisions as administrative levels of decisions are reduced
 sheeghra tathaa prabhavi nirnyon se sanghathan main mitvyayta or kushalta main vruddhi hoti he
 Due to division of functions and rights, there is clarity of control and direction in front of the higher officer
 kaaryon kaa boj kam karne ke liye : vartmaan samay main vibhinn deshon main na sirf jansankhya main vyapak vruddhi hui he balki kaaryon kaa boj nirantar badhata hi gaya he
 The government administration has increased so much that it cannot do the work of any department by any one officer
 padsopan par sthit vibhinn praadhikaron main satta kaa hastaantaran aavashyak ho jaataa he taaki kaaryon ke boj ko halkaa kiya ja sake
 Saving time: High officials have important responsibilities of the organization or entity
 in jimmedaariyon main niti–nirdhaaran tathaa niyojan pramukh he
 Under delegation, in addition to the tasks of importance by the higher officer, other tasks are handed over to the subordinate, which makes it easier for the officer to take important decisions and the tasks are easily executed
 prashikshan kaa avasar pradaan karne hetu : jab kabhi bhi adhinsth karmchaaree ke upar pratyaayojan ke falswaroop naveen uttardaayitv soupe jate hai to ve puure uttardaayitv kii bhaavana ke saath kaam karte hai or is kaary se unhen prashikshan praapt hota he
 Subordinate employees get the opportunity to work as a result of delegation of power, their activity increases, experience increases and they get training for future responsibilities
 nirdesan, niyantran or paryvekshan kii suvidha ke liye : prashasnic sanghathan main pad–sopan ke vibhinn staron par satta ke pratyaayojan hone se nirdesan, niyantran evam paryvekshan kaa kaary sugam ho jaataa he
 The delegation of power takes place in a planned manner
 isamen yah spasht rup se nirdhaarit kar diya jaataa he ki kise koun–sa kaary kitni simaaon main rahakar puraa karnaa he
 The officer who delegates power to his subordinate, has the authority to direct, control and supervise the work
 agar prashaskeey kaary main kahin koi gadabadi, dohraan yaa avyavashtha hoti he to iske liye uttaradaayi vyakti kii khoj aasaani se ho jaati he
 For Organizational Flexibility: Rigidity, inertia and orthodoxy are an impediment to the efficiency and growth of any organization

 Inertia can be broken through innovation and delegation, and organizational objectives can be better achieved
 naitik str or manobal main vruddhi : pratyaayojan adhinsthon ke manobal main vruddhi karata he, kyonki adhinsthon ko adhikaar tathaa daayitv saupane se ve apane pad kaa mahatv samajhate he or purna lagan ke saath kaary karte hai
 It is natural to increase the moral level and morale
 uttaradhikaar main sahaayta : pratyaayojan or uttaradhikaar ke bich gaharaa sambandh he
 An administrator makes way for his successor through delegation
 arthath ek prashaasak ke hatane par doosraa uski jagah le sakegaa
 In the words of Irwin Haskell Schell, pratyaayojan uttaradhikari ke chayan va aadarshon kii nirantarataa main bhi sahaayak hai
 Every organization has some ideals and even after changing the administrators, they remain as they are
 kaary kii prakruti, praadhikaar kaa swaroop, aupchaariktaayen tathaa prakriya ityadi ke aadhaar par pratyaayojan ko kai prakaaron main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he jo nimna he – Written or oral delegation: Written delegation is done by methodical and written orders, which are often formal, important and permanent, while oral delegation is done orally about matters of little importance or of immediate nature
 saamaanya athwa vishisht pratyaayojan : jab kisi vibhaag kii samast kriyaaon kaa kaarybhaar ek vyakti ko soup diya jaataa he to ise saamaanya pratyaayojan kehete hai
 Conversely, when a person is assigned a specific task by not assigning the whole work, it is called a specific delegation
 purna yaa aanshik pratyaayojan : purna pratyaayojan main sattadhari apni puri satta kaa pratyaayojan kar detaa he
 The example of such delegation is the right of delegation to be sent to international conferences
 koi shashan purna adhikaar dekar pratinidhi mandal ko sammelan main bhejtaa he
 Whatever the delegation gives its approval, it is from the government itself
 parantu saadhaarant: pratyaayojan aanshik hi hota he
 The ruling delegates partial power instead of delegating its full authority
 pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh pratyaayojan : pratyaksh pratyaayojan vah he jisamen ub adhikari apni satta ke kuch bhaag sidhe rup main apane adhinsth ko soup detaa he
 There is no connecting link between them
 apratyaksh pratyaayojan main satta dene vaale or lene vaale ke bich ek athwa ek se adhik madhyasth hote hai or ucch adhikari apni satta ko un madhyasthon ke madhyam se hi satta paane vaale tak pahunchaata he
 Formal and informal delegation: When a delegation is made according to the written rules, bye-laws, orders or procedures of the organization, it is called formal delegation
 duusari ore sanghathan kii anaupchaarik paramparaon, reeti–rivaajon tathaa aapasi sadbhaav ke aadhaar par hone vaala pratyaayojan anaupchaarik pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 Permanent and Temporary Delegation: When power and work are given to a subordinate person or entity in a permanent manner, it is called Permanent Delegation
 saamaanya paristhitiyon tathaa kushal kaary sanchaalan kii sthiti main sthaayee pratyaayojan bhi ho saktaa he
 But when someone is delegated for some time and withdrawn, it is called temporary delegation
 sashart athwa shartaheen pratyaayojan : satta kaa pratyaayojan sarshat bhi ho saktaa he or ashart bhi
 Conditional delegation entails certain conditions with delegation of power and it becomes necessary for the subordinate to fulfill those conditions
 shartaheen pratyaayojan main koi shart nahin rakhi jaati he tathaa adhinsth adhikari ko nirnay le ne or kaary karneki puri swytta rahati he
 Simple or complex delegation: The last place in the classification of delegation is simple or complex delegation
 praaia: chote–chote sanghathanon main ucch adhikari apane kaaryon ke boj ko halkaa karne ke liye apane adhinsthon kaa sahyog lete hai or sahyog lene ke swaarth main unamem saral rup se bina kisi jatilta ke satta ko pratyyojit kar dete hai
 These organizations are so small and of little importance that it is not considered appropriate to adopt a complex process of transfer
 duusari taraf jatil prakriya kii aavashyaktaa bade sanghathanon main hoti he jahaan kaaryboj or adhikaar–kshetra kaaphi viksit or jatil hote hai
 In this, cheap delegation is not easily done but delegation has to go through complex set reactions
 terry kaa vargeekaran : terry ne teen prakaar ke pratyaayojanon kaa ullekh kiya he : When a higher officer transfers power to his subordinate, it is called 'downward delegation'
 jab adhinsth adhikari apane varisht adhikari ko satta saunpta he to ise 'upar kii ore kaa pratyaayojan' kehete hai, jaise– shareholder apane board of diarector ko satta saunpta he
 According to Terry, slant delegation is that which goes in parallel here and there
 pratyaayojan apane aap main na to sthaayee he or na hi aseemit kyonki ek satta praapt vyakti jab apane adhinsthon main satta kaa pratyaayojan karata he to vah apane moolbhoot daayitv evam javabdehita se mukt nahin hota he
 It is generally seen that the higher authority delegates as much power as the subordinate staff can easily access
 kisi bhi prashasnic sanghathan ke liye aseem satta kaa pratyaayojan avyavashtha evam akaryakushalta ko janm detaa he
 Hai Man has rightly written in this context that the problem is not whether the power is delegated or not, but the important thing is the extent to which the power is transferred
 pratyaayojan kii prakriya ne aanevaali baadhaaen tathaa simaaen nimnlikhit he : The main restriction on the delegation of power rests with the constitution of the country because if the constitution itself prohibits the delegation, then power cannot be delegated or the power will be delegated to the extent to which the law or the constitution grants permission
 satta kaa pratyaayojan sansadeey vidhiyon ke dwaara simit ho jaataa he
 Where, whom, how much, in what form the power is to be delegated, its determination is limited by parliamentary statutes
 satta kaa pratyaayojan adhinsth karmchaariyon kii yogyata or kshamta ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he
 Because the limited qualifications and competence of subordinate employees themselves limit the delegation of power
 sanghathan kaa aakaar bhi satta ke pratyaayojan ko kam yaa adhik bana saktaa he
 In a small organization, maximum opportunities for delegation of power are not available
 prashaskeey sanghathan kaa bhugolic kshetron main vibhaajan satta ke pratyaayojan par prabhaav daalata he, kyonki sanghathan ke kaary karne kaa kshetra bhugolic drushti se vistrut or failaa hua na ho to satta ke pratyaayojan kii maatra kam ho jaati he
 The means of communication also affect the delegation of power
 sanchaar–sadhano kii yadi kami he to pratyaayojan ke avasar kam hote hai
 The nature of some rights is such that the delegation is not possible
 kuch vidwaanon kii yah manyata he ki ek prabandhak apane samanvay ke adhikaar kaa pratyaayojan kar hi nahin saktaa he kyonki aisa karke vah apneko mahatvaheen bananaa nahin chahega
 Delegation of power is prohibited even in emergency situations
 sankatkaal kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke samay ucchadhikari hi adhiktar vichaar–vimarsh karte hai tathaa nirnay lene main apni buddhi kaa prayog kartehain
 The possibility of delegation of power in crisis situations decreases
 satta ke pratyaayojan par ek pramukh seemaa yah lag jaati he ki koi bhi ucch adhikari nai nitiyon or yojanaon ko sweekaar karneka adhikaar apane adhinsthon ko nahin dena chahta he
 Another type of limitation is imposed on the delegation of power, that higher officials cannot delegate the authority to make rules to their subordinates
 prabhavi pratyaayojan ke liye kuch sharton evam siddhanton kaa hona aavashyak he
 According to prominent scholars, the following conditions should be noted for the success of delegation: thomas jacob "jaik" blike ek america abhinayta, kamedi abhinayta, lekhak, nirmaataa or gayak he

 In Egypt, according to the account of the exodus, it was not long before the Hebrews arrived, the apes were the bull-headed and bull-headed minors, who, as some believe, were recaptured at the time of exile

 He left Israel for forty days and forty nights when Moses went on Mount Senai to receive ten divine orders
 Israel began to fear that they would not return and asked Aaron to make an idol of the God of Israel for them
 However, Aaron refused to become the representative of the God of Israel
 The Israelites had complained enough to overwhelm Aaron, so he complied and collected gold earrings from the ears of the Israelites
 He melted it and made a statue of a young gold bull
 Aaron also built an altar in front of the bull and announced that the people of Israel, this is your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt "
 And the very next day, the Israelites offered the gold calf Paid and celebrated
 When Moses saw them doing all this, he became angry with them, baad main, ishwar ne musa se kaha ki uske logon ne apane aap ko paap main lipt kar liya he, evam unhone unhen nasht kar dene kii yojana banaai he or musa se hi nae logon kii shuruyaat karenge
 haalanki, musa ne tark karte hue yah daleel di ki unhen chhod diya janaa chahie or ishwar ne uski yah vinati sweekaar kar lee

 922 BC In, when Jeroboam i established the northern kingdom of Israel, he built two golden calves and was replaced between Bethel and Dan
 raajaaon main se 1 raja 12
 c26-30 ke anusaar, yaarobaam baaliyon ke saapeksh israeliyon ke dharmik karmkandon kaa sarvokshan karata he
 26 Jeroboam thought in his own heart, "the kingdom will probably come to Dawood
 If the people of 27 go back to Jerusalem and do not offer earrings to the temple of God, they will revert the charges to their master
" The king of Judah will hand over to Rehoboam
 They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam
 " The king made two golden calves after taking advice
 He told the people, "going to Jerusalem is not a matter of your control
 Here is your God, Israel, who brought you out of Egypt
" " 29 ek ko usne bethel main sthapit kar diya or duusare ko daan main
 30 or yahi baat paap ho gai; log bethel main ek kii puja karne aae or duusare kii sudur daan main
 saanchaa:bible verse His main concern is his nature of sacrificing in Jerusalem, a deed that he experiences that people will return to the Lord to King Rehoboam who is in the southern kingdom
 vah svarnim bachade kii drushti nirodhak paddati ke rup main karata he taaki vah apni suraksha sunishchit kar sake or apni pahchaan ek raja ke rup main kaayam kar sake
 iske alaava, vah do bachade kii murtiyon khadi karata he, jisamen use jerusalem main raja sulaiman dwaara banawaye gaye karubon ke nikalp ke rup main chitrit kiya jaataa he
 The golden calf is also mentioned by Ezra in the ninth chapter of Nehemiah, verses 18–19
 16 "lekin ve, hamaare purvaj, ghamandi or abhimaani ho gaye or unhone tumhaare adeshon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 17 They also refused to listen and forgot whatever miracles you did among them
 They became arrogant and their rebels again appointed a leader for the purpose of returning to their slavery

 You did not snatch your divine food from their mouths and you burnt them to quench their thirst
 21 For forty years you constantly protected them in their helpless state; He was not short of anything, his clothes did not get ragged and his feet did not swell
 saanchaa:bible verse Ezra, speaking among the Israelites, reminds them of their history and tells them of the grace of God the Darmian as they attempt to worship God with the calf
 ajra kii bhashaa "ishwar" ke sandarbh main yah darshaati he ki israeliyon ke duusare maamalon or unka bachade ke upyog ke maamalon main kuch visangatiyaan hai
 There is a tendency to expose the betrayal of the Israelites, according to the account of the Exodus, and in the Kings 1 edition written by legal historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah
 yah asangati mukhyatah nirgaman 32
4 pai gai he jisamen "devataaon" ko bahuvachan ke rup main darshaya gaya he baavjood iske kii ek hi bachade kaa nirmaan hua
 When Ezra repeats the story, he only mentions God written in single, capital letters
 ek se dikhte sarlikrut bahaane ke baavjood, sone ke bachade kii katha jatil he
 According to Michael Coogan, it seems that the golden calf was not an idol of any other god and thus it was an inexact or false god
 ve pramanswaroop nirgaman 32:4-5 ko uddhrut karte hai: vah unalogon se sona le letaa he, ise pighla detaa he or bachade kii pratimaa garh detaa he; or unhone kaha, "ye tumhaare ishwar hai, o israel vaasiyon, yah hi tum sabko misr kii bhoomi se baahar nikaal laayaa he
 "when Aaron saw this, he made an altar in front of it; and Aaron declared," Tomorrow a festival will be held in the name of God
 "the important thing is that in this story, only one calf , While people refer to it in terms of their representation of "gods"
 jabaki yah zaruri nahin ki ekal ishwar kaa ullekh yahova ki puja ko hi sanderbhit karata ho, haalanki yah is sambhaavna ko bhi kaarij nahin karata ki yah yahova hi he jisaki log puja kar rahe hai, jaisaaki "devataaon" ke bahuvachan se sanderbhit hota ho
 saath hi saath chand 5 main "ishwar ke naam" par utsav kaa kabhi-kabhi anuwaad "yahova ke prati" hi kiya gaya he
 It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the ten God-commandments" people were not even given any god-command against the creation of sculpted idols when they used such behavior to help them to make a calf
 Till then there was clearly no illegal agreement
 sone ke bachade kii katha ke vivaran se jo duusari baat samaj main aati he vah yah he ki bachade ko yahova ke manch ke rup main maan liya gaya tha
 In the art of the Near East, the gods often held a rough throne
 By studying this account, it can then be accepted as logical that the calf of the source was only a substitute for the covenant of the covenant or the angel to whom the Lord was thrones
 is jatilta ke kaaran ko is rup main samajha ja saktaa he 1) haaron kii aalochana, yajkon ke grih ke pratishthata ke rup main jisane musa ke yaajak-awaas ke saath pratispardhaa kii, evam / athwa 2

 kugan ke anusaar, yah prakaran vidhi-vidhaan ke vivaran ke itihaas kaa ek hissaa maatr he, jise uttari rajya, jo uttari rajya ke pakshpaat ke khilaaf tha, uske patan ke pashchaat likhaa gaya
 Coogan states that the Jeroboam Jerusalem temple was meant to be offered only as an alternative to cherubim and therefore the calves do not imply non-yehovi worship

 After the collapse of the northern kingdom, when e and j join together, "the narrative is re-designed to represent the northern state in a negative light" and the worship of the calf is portrayed as "polytheism"
 Which also suggested "bare dancing with sex
 Narrative details are collected, p may have reduced Aaron's crime in this case, but associated with the calf Preserved negative
 israel kii ghatana or sone ke bachade kaa quran main taha 20
83 main punah ullekh kiya gaya he
 The Quranic version of this episode is similar to the original in most contexts, except that the gold calf was not made by Aaron but by a man named Sameeri
 The Samaris claim that Moses was impregnated and the Israelites were looking for a new God
 katha kaa ant is prakaar hota he samiri misr main laaye gaye swarna-aabhushanon se sone kaa bachhda gadhata he
 Aaron, who plays the leader in Moses' absence, tries to prevent people from worshiping the idol, but is unsuccessful
