 barason ke adhyayan ke baad jab 1916 main albert oinstin ne is siddhant kii ghoshnaa kii to vigyaan kii duniya main tahalaka much gaya or dhai-sau saal se qaayam ijak newton dwaara 1687 main ghoshit brahmand kaa nazariyaa hameshaa ke liye ulat diya gaya
 It had such a profound effect on physics that people began to describe modern physics as a subject different from classical physics and Albert Einstein came to be considered the father of modern physics
 dik sanskrit kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he ird-gird kii jagah
 It is called "space" in English
 manushya dik ke teen pahaluon ko bhaap sakane kii kshamta rakhte hai- upar-neeche, aage-peeche or daayen-baayein
 In ordinary life, humans do not see any change in problems
 newton kii bhautikee kahati thi ki agar antariksh main do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai or un donon main se koi bhi na hile, to ve ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hi rahengi
 Our ordinary life also shows us this
 lekin inastin ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 The problem may worsen and shrink
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki jo do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai ve swayan na hilen, lekin unke bich kaa dik kuch paristhitiyon ke kaaran fail kar sava kilometre ho jaae yaa sikud ke pauna kilometre ho jaae
 In Newton's classical physics, it was said that the speed of time is the same everywhere in the universe
 agar aap ek jagah tik kar baithe hai or aapkaa koi mitra prakaash se aadhi gati kii raftaar par das saal kaa safar tay kare to, us safar ke baad, aapke bhi das saal guzar chuke honge or aapke dost ke bhi
 But Einstein also said that this belief is wrong
 jab koi chiz gati se chalati he, uske liye samay dhire ho jaataa he or vah jitna tej chalati he, samay utana hi dhire ho jaataa he
 If your friend returned by traveling at half the speed of light for ten years according to his own, then ten years would have passed but eleven and a half years would have passed
 inastin ne saapekshata siddhant main dikhaaya ki vastav main dik ke teen or kaal kaa ek milakar brahmand main chaar pahaluon vaala dik-kaal he jisame sari vasteen or urjaayen sthit hotin hai
 This problem is not permanent - neither problem occurs without any change and it is not necessary that the flow of time is the same for every thing
 dik-kaal ko prabhavit kar ke use maroda, khinchaa or sikoda ja saktaa he or aisa hi brahmand main hota he
 The concept of time travel has been created through this principle
 dik-kaal main badlaav har vastu or har raftaar paidaa karti he lekin badi vasteen or prakaash ke sameep kii raftaarein adhik badlaav paidaa karti hai
 Humans are so small and their speed is so slow that they do not see the effects of the theory of relativity in their lives, but when they study more things in the universe, they find signs of relativity in many places
 jab vastu kaa veg prakaash ke veg kaa 5% bhi ho jaae, to saapekshata ke siddhanth ke chinh hame dikhaai dene lagate he
 Newton believed that every object had a force to pull towards itself, which he called gravity
 prithvi jaisi badi chiz main yah gurutvkarshan bahut adhik hota he, jisase ham prithvi se chipke rahete hai or anayas hi ud kar antariksh main nahin chale jate
 But Newton could not explain how the force of gravity actually works and why
 inastin ne kaha ki aapekshikta ke siddhanth ke anusaar yah vichaar ki bhautik vastuen ek doosar ko aakarshith karti hai, ek bhram he, jo prakruti sambandhi galat yantrik dharanaon ke kaaran paidaa hua he
 He said that the earth is large and because of that the time period around him has turned and folded over itself
 ham is khiche-mude dik-kaal main rahete hai or is mudan kii vajah se prithvi ke qareeb dhakele jate hai
 This can be compared to a sheet whose four corners have been pulled by four people
 ab is chadar ke bich main ek baari gola rakh diya jaae, to chadar bich se baith jaaegi, yani uske soot main bich main mudan paidaa ho jaaegi
 Now if we put a light ball on the corner of the sheet, it will roll towards the big circle
 inastin ne kaha ki koi anaadi aadmi yah dekh kar kah saktaa he ki choti gend ko bade gole ne khinchaa isliye gend uske paas gai
 But the real reason was that the ball wanted to go towards the ground and the shell created such a twist in the sheet that the ball went to him
 isi tarah se unhone kaha ki yah ek mithyaa he ki gurutvkarshan kisi aakarshan kii vajah se hota he
 The real reason for gravity is that every object which is moving in space, comes under the influence of such a problem of difficulty and starts moving towards something bigger
 vastut: gurutvkarshan jadta kaa ek bhaag maatr he, taare or grahon kii gatividhiyaan, unke swabhaavgat jadtv se utpann hotin hai or unka maarg dik-kaal-satati ke vrittiya tatwon par nirbhar karata he
 Just as there is a magnetic field around the magnet, the celestial object scatters a field in the sky around it
 jis tarah chumbakeey kshetra main ek lohe ke tukade kii gatividhi kshetra kii banaavat se nirdeshit hoti he usee tarah gurutveey kshetra main kisi vastu kaa maarg us kshetra kii jyamithik avasthaa se nirdhaarit hota he
 Einstein's law of gravitation gives information about the regional elements of the time constant
 mukhyat: is niyam kaa ek bhaag gurutvkarshanjanya vastu ke chaaron ore ke kshetra ke dhaanche se sambandh vyakt karata he
 a great proof of Einstein's spreading theory came from seeing the effect of gravity on light
 newton kii bhautikee main siddhant tha ki do vasteen ek-duusare ko donon ke dravyaman ke anusaar khinchati hai
 But there is no mass of light, that is, zero
 to newton ke mutabiq jis chiz kaa koi dravyaman yaa vazan hi nahin uskaa kisi duusari vastu ke gurutvkarshan se khichne kaa sawaal hi nahin banataa chaahe duusari vastu kitni bhi badi kyon na ho
 Light always moves in a straight line
 lekin agar inastin sahi he or kisi badi vastu kii vajah se dik hi mud jaae, to roshni bhi dik ke mudane ke saath mud jaani chahie
 That is, large objects located in the universe should act as lenses - just as the lens of glasses, binoculars or microscope turns light, the stars and planets should also bend
 1924 main ek orest khwolson naam ke roosi bhautikavigyaani ne inastin ke saapekshata siddhant ko samajhakar bhavishyavaanee kii ki aise gurutvkarshak lens brahmand main zarur honge
 Fifty-five years later, this was first noticed in 1979 when two images were seen, instead of one, of an object named twin quasar
 uske baad kaafii dur-daraaj vastuon kii aisi chhaviyaan dekhi ja chuki hai jinamein un vastuon or prithvi ke bich koi bahut badi anya vastu rakhi ho jo pehali vastu se aa rahi prakaash kii kirnon par lenson kaa kaam kare or uski chhavi ko yaa to marod de yaa aasmaan main uski ek se zyaada chhavi dikhaae

 Parasites can be of the following four types: anyonyashrayi - inamen paraseete or parposhi ek duusare se labhanvit hote hai, Symbiotic - these parasites and the host cannot survive without each other, sahabhoji - yah paraseete parposhi ko haani pahunchaae bina usase laabh uthaata he evam Parasite - It eats and digs the host
 parposhi vah praani he jo paraseete ko aashray detaa he
 There are two types of heterotrophs: nishchit parposhi vah praani he jisamen paraseete apana vayask jivan bitaata he, yaa langik janan karata he, An intermediate host is the animal in which the parasite's larvae or larvae live, or the lingering cycle of life
 parajeevijnya vikaron ke nimnlikhit rup hai : Damage - These are microscopic or macro mechanical shocks on cells and tissues, as do larvae of hookworms or laceworms, traveling between tissues
 sanlaayi - yah paraseete dwaara koshikaon tathaa utakon kaa kinv kii sahaayta se sanlay he, jaisaa andmoeba hystolitica karata he; Obstructive - In this there are obstructions in the internal passages of the body and many parasites are produced, such as obstruction of intestines or gallbladder by earthworms or laceworms; poshanhaari - parposhi ke aahaar main hissaa bantaakar paraseete use poshanheenata se peedit karte hai, jaisaa kentue, ankushkrimi, yaa feetakrimi karte hai; Substances - Substances of the metabolism of parasites can produce toxic effects on the host; allergys - bahya protein padaarth utpann hone ke kaaran paraseete parposhi main allergy ke lakshan utpann karte hai, yatha malaria main jaada dekar bukhaar aana, kentue ke kaaran judapitti nikalnaa; Antigens - Some parasites induce tissue to grow, such as the increase of macrophages in kala azar, or the proliferation of tissues in filariasis

 vyavsaay ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he : The business has the following characteristics: bharat kii saanskrithik dhrohar bahut samrudh he
 But perhaps few people would know that in ancient times India was a very developed country at the level of economy and business
 yah baat aitihaasik saakshyon, khudaai se praapt pramaanon, sahitya va likhit dastavezon se sidhi hoti hai
 Attracted by the immense wealth of India, most of these attacks from time to time by various foreign invaders also attest to this fact
 pracheen bhartiya sabhyataa na keval vrufashi aadhaarit thi, balki iske aantarik va bahya vyapaar va vaanijya bhi kaaphi unnat the
 India has immense contribution in various fields of business
 us samay ke anya deshon main prachlit vyavsaayon se tulana karne par ham pate hai ki bhartiya vyavsaay apni vilakshantaa, gatishiltaa ;gatyaatmakataaddh va gunatmakataa main in sabase kahin aage tha
 In the early days, the Indian economy was completely agricultural based
 log apane upbhog kii vastuon kaa utpaadan swayan karte the
 There was no need to sell or exchange goods
 lekin vikaas ke saath-saath logon kii aavashyaktaayen badhane lagi
 Due to which production of goods also increased
 logon ne dainik upyog tathaa vilasita sambandhi vibhinn vastuon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata arjeet kerani shuru kar di or is tarah se unke paas apane upyog kii anya vastuon ke utpaadan ke liye dakshataor samay kaa vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra abhaav hona shuru ho gaya
 In this way, their efficiency increased and they were able to produce more items than they needed
 atah apni anya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye apni adhki utpaadit vastuon ke vinimay kii pranali viksit ho gai
 This was the beginning of trade
 aaj zyaadaatar log yah maanate hai ki bharat main vyavsaay va vyapaar ke kshetra main itnaa vikaas swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat hi hua he
 India has become so capable in industrial production today that we can produce all goods using indigenous technology
 lekin isse yah parinaam nahin nikaal lenaa chahie ki bhoot kaal main bhartiya sabhyataa viksit yaa unnat nahin thi
 While we are still proud of India's rich commercial and commercial heritage
 aap yah jaanakar hairaan honge ki bharat ne vyapaar va vaanijya ke kshetra main apni yatra 5000 varsh i
pus
 shuru kar di thi
 It is proved from many historical evidences that at that time there were well planned cities in India
 bhartiya kapadon, aabhushanon or itra ityadi ke prati puure vishwa main aakarshan tha
 There has also been evidence that for a long time there was a trend among Indian traders to use currency for business
 vyapaariyon, shilpakaaron va utpaadakon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye sanghon ;hanpaskaddh kaa prachlan tha
 This indicates the complex development of trade and commerce in India

 bhartiya vyapaaree vishwa ke vibhinn bhaagon main apane utpaadon kaa niryaat karte the or vahaan se unke utpaadon kaa aayaat karte the
 It is a well-known fact that the British first came to India to do business, who later established their kingdom here
 bharat ne kai prakaar se vishwa vyapaar va vaanijya main yogadan diya he
 The numeral system for calculation, which we still use today, was already developed in India
 sanyukt parivaar pratha tathaa vyavsaay main shram vibhaajan kaa vikaas bhi yaheen hua, jo aaj tak prachlit he
 Today, consumer-centric business techniques used in modern times have been an integral part of Indian business since ancient times
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki bharat kii apni samrudhi vyavsaayik dhrohar he, jisane isaki unnati main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 All business actions are performed to serve certain purposes
 vyavsaay ke uddeshyon ko nimna prakaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he : The economic objectives of the business include all the necessary actions that serve the purpose of making profit, such as creating customers, regular innovation and better utilization of available resources, with the objective of making a profit
 laabh, vyavsaay ke liye jivan daayini shakti kaa kaary karata he
 Without this, no business can survive in the competition market
 vastav main kisi bhi vyavsaayik ikai ke astitv main aane kaa uddeshy hota he- laabh kamanaa
 Profit not only helps the businessman in earning his livelihood, but also helps in expansion of business activities by re-appropriating a part of the profit in the business
 laabh kamaane ke praathmik uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye vyavsaay ke kuch anya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai : Social objectives are the objectives of business which are necessary to be achieved for the interests of society
 atah har vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie ki vah kisi bhi prakaar se samaaj ko haani na pahunchaae
 The social objectives of business include production and fulfillment of good quality goods and services, adoption of proper business practices, contribution to the general welfare functions of the society and contribution to welfare facilities
 maanviya uddeshyon se abhipraay un uddeshyon se he, jinamein samaaj ke aksham tathaa viklang, shiksha athwa prashikshan se vanchit logon ke kalyaan tathaa karmchaariyon kii apekshaaon kii purti ke lakshya nihit hote hai
 Thus, the humanitarian objectives of business include economic security of employees, social and psychological satisfaction and development of human resources
 vyavsaay, desh kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he atah rashtriya lakshyon or aakankshaon kii prapti prayek vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 The national objectives of the business are: pehle bharat ke anya deshon ke saath bahut hi simit vyapaarik sambandh the
 The policies regarding import and export of goods were very stringent then, but nowadays liberal economic policies have largely eliminated the ban on foreign investment, and the duty on imported goods has also come down considerably
 in parivartanon se bazaar main pratiyogita kaaphi bad gai he
 Today, the whole world has transformed into a big market due to globalization
 aaj ek desh main taiyaar maal duusare desh main aasaani se uplabdh he
 Thus, due to increasing competition in the world market, every business has started working with some purpose in its mind, which can be called global objective
 log laabh arjeet karne ke uddeshy se vyavsaay chalaate hai
 But making profit alone is not the sole purpose of business
 samaaj kaa ek ang hone ke naate ise bahut se saamaajik kaary bhi karne hote hai
 It also bears the responsibility of looking after the nature and area and community of business, especially the owners, investors, employees and society in general in protecting their existence
 atah prayek vyavsaay ko kisi na kisi rup main inke prati jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah karnaa chahie
 For example, assuring investors a reasonable rate of return, providing good salaries, security, proper working conditions to their employees, providing good quality goods to their customers at reasonable prices, protecting the environment and so on
 Many tasks should be done
 haalanki aise kaary karte samay vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardayitvon ke nirvaah ke liye do baton kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhana chahie
 First of all, not every such action is a ritualistic action
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi koi vyavsaay kisi aspataal athwa mandir yaa kisi skool athwa college ko kuch dhanrashi daan main detaa he to yah uskaa saamaajik uttardaayitv nahin kehalaayegaa, kyonki daan dene se saamaajik uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah nahin hota
 Secondly, such actions should not be good for some people and bad for some people
 maan lijie ek vyapaaree taskari karke yaa apane graahakon ko dhekha dekar bahut sa dhan arjeet kar letaa he or garibon ke mufrat ilaaj ke liye aspataal chalaata he to uskaa yah kaary saamaajik rup se nyyochit nahin he
 Social responsibility means that a businessman should not do anything which is harmful to society while performing social activities
 is prakaar saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna vyavsaayee ko jamkhori va kalabazari, kar chori, milawat, graahakon ko dhekha dena jaisi anuchit vyaparik kriyaaon ke badale vyavsaayee ko vivekpurna prabandhn ke dwaara laabh arjeet karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 This is possible by providing appropriate work and residential facilities to the employees, providing appropriate after-sales services to the customers, controlling environmental pollution and protecting natural resources
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna tathaa iske mahatv ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar lene ke baad aaie jaane ki vyavsaay kaa iske vibhinn hit-samoohon, jin par yah ashrith he, ke prati kya uttardaayitv hai
 Business is often dependent on owners, disinvesters, employees, suppliers, customers and consumers, competitors, government and society
 inhen hit-samooh isliye kaha jaataa he, kyonki vyavsaay kii prayek kriya se in samoohon kaa hit, pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se prabhavit hota he
 Responsibilities of business owners: vyavsaay ke apane lendaaron ke prati uttardaayitv haih The business has the following responsibilities towards its employees: vyavsaay ke apane aapurtikarttaaon ke prati uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business towards the customers: vyavsaay ke apane pratiyogiyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : The following are the various business responsibilities of the government: ek samaaj, vyaktiyon, samoohon, sanghathanon, pariwaron aadi se milakar banataa he
 They are all members of society
 ye sabhi ek duusare ke saath milte-julate hai tathaa apni lagbhag sabhi gatividhiyon ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar hote hai
 There is a connection between all of them, whether direct or indirect

 For this, it is necessary to discharge certain responsibilities towards the society

 Kanthmala is a chronic disease of the lymph glands
 isamen gale kii granthiyaan bad jaati hai or unki maala si ban jaati he isliye use kanthmala kehete hai
 In Ayurveda its description is available with two names 'gandmala' and 'apachi', which can also be called two distinctions or two stages of Kanthamala
 choti ber, badi ber yaa aanwale ke pramaan kii gaanthen gale main ho jaati hai jo maala kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he unhen gandamala kehete hai
 But it is caries and its location is not only in the cervical region but also in other parts of the body, such as the glands in the room, chest, etc
 It can also grow or develop along with the glands
 gaanthon kii shrunkhlaa yaa maala hone ke kaaran ise gandamala kehete hai
 It is known that due to minor catarrh, ulcer etc
, these glands get distorted and enlarged, but the garland cannot be formed, so they do not have any effect in it
 in grathiyon kii maala main jab paak hone lagata he to use 'apchi' kehete hai
 Its main symptom is that one of the glands becomes pak and it bursts, but at the same time pak begins in the other gland and it also gets secreted
 is prakaar nai-nai grathiyon kaa badhanaa, footnaa or bahna laga rahata he or yah kram chalata hi rahata he
 But on filling the ulcer, its mark remains, so that its location remains to be known
 is prakaar baar-baar nai grathiyon kaa upachay hone ke kaaran ise apchi rog kaha gaya he
 In this context, many authors point out that Gandmala and Apachi are the same disease and have two stages
 parantu yah gyatavya he ki kuch granthiyaan aisi hoti hai jinamein kabhi paak hota hi nahin or kuch main hota he
 The cause, symptoms and treatment of these two are different, so they can also be considered as two different classes, one which is a ripener and the other a ripener
 parantu kanthmala main donon kaa antarbhaav ho jaataa he

 Human, 2
 Bovine
 isamen pratham prakaar ke keetanuon se fefde ke rog hote hai, duusare prakaar ke keetanuon se gale ke, aanton ke tathaa tatsasambandhi lasika grathiyon ke
 It is clear that Kanthamala originates from the germ of the bovine species
 yah ullekhneey he ki is prakaar ke keetanuon kaa sankraman gaay ke doodh ke dwaara hota he
 If the milk is boiled and drunk properly, there is no possibility of this disease
 jahaan tak iske lakshan evam chikitsa kaa prashn he, yah visheshkar gale ke agle bhaag main grathiyon ke rup main utpann hota he or kramash: pakataa evam footataa rahata he
 Also, all other symptoms of Rajayakshma, such as fever, loss of appetite, weakness etc
 are also found
 isaki chikitsa main saamaanya rup se streptomicine evam isoniyazid evam paas kaa prayog hota he

 parantu ye kaaphi vishakt the at: dhire-dhire inkaa prayog main aana band ho gaya he
 Nowadays, its easy treatment is done by penicillin and now in the era of penicillin, patients with partial lymph nodes of the cervix are also less visible
 hachakin dijiz, leukemia evam linfocarcoma mukhya rup se lasika grathiyon ke arbud hai
 Hachkin Disease is the chief among them
 limphosarchroma ek ashukaari vyaadhi he jisamen do teen hafte main hi mrityu ho sakati he or leukemia ek prakaar kaa rakt kaa cancer he jisamen plihavriddhi vishesh rup se hoti he
 This decision is made quickly by blood test
 hachakin dijiz mukhyatya noujvaan vyaktiyon main pai jaati he
 In this, various lymphatic glands of the throat grow at some rapid speed and gradually and they remain separate from the skin
 ye sparsh main lacheelee maaloom padati hai
 After a few days, the patient becomes very attenuated by blood and the patient also starts fever in an irregular manner
 sankshep main, yah smaraneey he ki greeva main honevaali sabhi lasika granthiyaan ek hi prakaar kii nahin hotin or unki chikitsa bhi bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 It is also not appropriate to address all the glandular words by word

 Islam is a monotheistic religion which, according to its followers, is based on the teachings of the Qur'an, the last divine book of Allah, delivered by Muhammad, the last Rasul and prophet of Allah
 quran arabi bhashaa main rachi gai or isi bhashaa main vishwa kii kul jansankhya ke 25% hisse, yani lagbhag 1
6 se 1
8 arab logon, dwaara padhi jaati he; inamen se lagbhag 20 se 30 karod logon kii yah maatrubhaasha he
 The Sharia, a book written purportedly from the mouth of Hazrat Mohammad Saheb and providing instructions to follow the book, are the only two resources that rightly identify the source of Islam's information
 islamic dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai: Muslims believe in a single God whom they call Allah
 akeshwarwad ko arabi main tauhid kehete hai, jo shabd vaahid se aata he jiskaa arth he ek
 In Islam, God is considered beyond human comprehension
 musalamaanon se ishvar kii kalpana karne ke bajaay uski prarthana or jai-jayakaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 According to Muslims, God is unique - there is no one like him
 islam main ishwar kii ek vilakshan avadharana par bal diya gaya he or yah bhi mana jaataa ki uskaa sampoorn vivaran karnaa manushya se pare he
 Say: na use kisi ne janaa or na hi wo kisi kaa janak he
 And there is no one like that
 ” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 lagbhag sansaar me 124,000 nabi ek khuda ko poojane kaa sandesh dene ke liye bheje gayi the
 These messengers were also among humans and called people towards God
 ishwar in duuton se vibhinn roopon se sampark rakhata tha
 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan, shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahab was also a part of this link
 unako jo dharmik pustak pradaan kii gayi uskaa naam quran he
 The Qur'an describes 25 other prophets of Allah
 swayan quran ke anusaar ishwar ne in nabiyon ke alaava dharti par or bhi kai nabi bheje hai jinka varnan quran main nahin he
 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all prophets sent by God and Muslims consider Muhammad the last prophet of God
 ahmadiyya samudaay mohammad sahab ko antim nabi nahin maanata tathaapi swayan ko islam kaa anuyaayi kahata he or sanyukt raashtra dwaara sweekaara bhi jaataa he haalanki kai islamic rashtron main use muslim maananaa pratibandhit he
 According to the Supreme Court of India, he is considered a Muslim in India
 musalamaanon ke liye allaah dwaara rasulon ko pradaan kii gayi sabhi dharmik pustaken vaid hai
 According to Muslims, the Quran is the last religious book provided by God to man
 quran main chaar or pustakon kii charchaa he: Muslims believe that Christians and Jews have changed the messages in their books
 ve in chaaron ke alaava anya dharmik pustakon kaa ishwariya hone kii sambhaavna se manaa nahin karte hai
 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar devdoot swayan koi vivek nahin rakhte or ishwar kii ajna kaa yatharoop paalan hi karte hai
 They are only abstract and flawless figures made of light, which are neither male nor female, but different from human beings in every sense
 haalanki devdoot agananeey hai, par kuch devdoot quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions of Central Asia, in Islam also, the end of the universe is considered by the doomsday
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 islam ke anusaar sabhi mrit logon ko us din punerjeevit kiya jayega or allaah ke aadeshaanusaar apana jivan vyateet karne waalon ko swarg bheja jayega or uskaa aadesh na manaane waalon ko nark main jalaayaa jayega
 Muslims believe in luck
 bhagya kaa arth inke liye yah he ki ishwar beete hue samay, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bare main sab jaanata he
 No event can happen without his permission
 manushya ko apni ichha se jeene kii swatantrata to he par isaki anumati bhi ishwar hi ke dwaara use di gayi he
 According to Islam, man is himself responsible for his misdeeds because God allows man to take them for himself or not
 uske kukarmon kaa bhi purv gyaan ishwar ko hota he
 There are two major classes of Islam, the Shia and the Sunni
 donon ke apane apane islamic niyam hai lekin aadharbhoot siddhanth milte-julate hai
 Many Sunnis do not consider Shias completely Muslims
 sunni islam main har musalmaan ke 5 aavashyak kartavya hote hai jinhen islam ke 5 stambh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Slightly different doctrines are called stanzas in Shia Islam
 sunni islam ke 5 stambh hai- Arabic: لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله Transliteration: La ilaha ilallah Muhammad Rasool Allah Hindi: There is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
 is ghoshnaa se har musalmaan ishwar kii akeshwarvadita or mohammad ke rasul hone ke apane vishwaas kii gavaahi detaa he
 This is the most prominent principle of Islam
 har musalmaan ke liye anivaary he ki vah ise sweekaare Islam has its own influence on every aspect of life for Muslims
 islamic siddhanth musalamaanon ke gharelu jivan, unke rajnatik yaa aarthik jivan, musalmaan rajyon kii videsh niti ityadi par prabhaav daalate hai
 The Shariah refers to a set of policies that is based on Islamic legal traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 sharia kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen panth kehete hai
 The major texts in Sunni Islam are- adhiktar musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron panth aadharbhoot rup se sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he
 Muhammad the Prophet attained the ultimate knowledge in the hills of Mecca around 610
 jab unhone upadesh dena aarambh kiya tab makka ke samrudh logon ne ise apni saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha par khatra samajha or unka virodh kiya
 Finally in 622 he had to travel from Mecca to Medina with his followers
 is yatra ko hijra kaha jaataa he or yaheen se islamic calendar kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The lives of the people of Madina were troubled by mutual fighting and the messages of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab made them very popular there
 630 main hazrat mohammad sahab ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath ek sandhi kaa ulanghan hone ke kaaran makka par chadhaai kar di
 The Meccans surrendered and converted to Islam
 makka main sthit kaaba ko islam kaa pavitra sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prophet Muhammad saheb died in 632
 par unki mrityu tak islam ke prabhaav se arab ke saare kabeeley ek raajnneetik or saamaajik sabhyataa kaa hissaa ban gayi the
 After this, the Khilafat phase began in Islam
 mohammad ke sasur abu bakr siddiq musalamaanon ke pehle khalipha 632 main banaaye gayi
 Many prominent Muslims accepted the mill to be their caliph
 sunni musalamaanon ke anusaar abu bakr siddiq kii khilaafat ke sambandh main koi vivaad nahin hua apitu sabhi ne unhe khalifaa swikaar kar liya tha, sunni manytaaon ke anusaar hazrat mohammad sahab ne swayan apane swargvaas se purv hi abu bakr siddiq ko apane sthaan par imamat karne kaa kaary bhaar dekar abu bakr siddiq ke khalifaa hone kaa kaa sanket de diya tha san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko hazrat ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 Keep in mind that Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan, that is, Bani Hashim Ali, wanted to be Khalifa
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 parantu shiya muslim ke anusaar mohammad ke chachaa jaad bhai, ali, jin kaa musalmaan bahut aadar karte the ne abu bakr ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But this controversy was averted in order to prevent the destruction of Islam, in fact, because of the wisdom of Hazrat Ali, the fighting of Muslim forces from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Iranian Empire took place during Abu Bakr's tenure
 yah yuddh mohammad ke jamaane se chali aa rahi dushmani kaa hissaa the
 Umar bin Khatab was made caliph in 634 after Abu Bakr
 unke kaarykaal main islamic samrajya bahut tezi se failaa or sampurna irani samrajya or do tihaai purvi roman samrajya par musalamaanon ne kabaja kar liya
 The entire empire was divided into various territories and a governor was appointed for each region which was under the Caliphate
 umr bin khattab ke baad usmaan bin afphan 644 main khalipha bane
 These were also among the prominent companions of Muhammad
 usmaan bin afphan par unke virodhiyon ne ye aarope lagane shuru kiye ki wo pakshpaat se niyuktiyaan karte hai or ki ali hi khalipha hone ke sahi hakdaar hai
 Then the spirit of rebellion arose in Egypt and from there an armed group of 1000 people came to Madina, the capital of Islamic Empire
 us samay tak sabhi khalipha aam logon kii tarah hi rahete the
 Therefore, this group succeeded in killing Usman in 656
 kuch pramukh musalamaanon ne ab ali ko khalipha sweenkar kar liya lekin kuch pramukh musalamaanon kaa dal ali ke khilaaf bhi ho gaya
 These Muslims believed that it was not right for Ali to become the Khalifa until the killers of Usman were punished
 yah islam kaa pehla grihayuddh tha
 Initially, a part of this group was led by Ayesha, Muhammad's wife
 ali or ashya kii senaaon ke bich main jang hooi jise jang-e-jamal kehete hai
 Ali's army conquered in this battle
 ab syria ke rajyapal muavia ne vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa
 Mu'awiya was also a relative of Usman, there was no result of war between Mu'awiya's army and Ali's army
 ali ne samrajya main faili ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye rajdhani madina se kufa main pehle hi badal di thi
 Mu'awiya's armies now spread throughout the Islamic Empire, and soon Mu'awiya was captured by the entire empire except the territory of Kufa
 tabhi ek kattarpanthi ne 661 main ali kii hatya kar di
 After Ali, however, Mu'awiya became the Khalifa, but there remained a section of Muslims who believed that the Khalifa of the Muslims could belong to the family of Muhammad
 unka maananaa tha ki yah khalipha swayan bhagwaan ke dwaara aadhyatmik maargdarshan paata he
 According to him Ali was the first Imam
 yah varg shiya varg ke naam se prasiddh hua
 The rest of the Muslims, who do not believe that only the family of Muhammad can be Khalifa, are called Sunni
 sunni pehle chaaron khalifaaon ko rashidoon khalipha kehete hai jiskaa arth he sahi maarg pe chalane vaale khalipha
 Khilafat became hereditary after Mu'awiya became the Caliph
 isse umayyad kilaafat kaa aarambh hua
 According to Shia history cars, Yazid, son of Mu'awiya, started working against the policies of Islam as soon as he got the Khilafat, religious Muslims became uncomfortable by his act, now Yazid needed to recognize his wrong policies from such a person Grant that all Muslims trust, for this work, Yazid gave the blessings of Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam and Hazrat Muhammad's only Hazrat Hussain, son of the daughter of Fatimah, wanted to sanction his Khilafat but Hazrat Hussain refused to give his approval because of his actions against the policies of Islam
 On the refusal of Hazrat Hussain, the soldiers of Yazid, Hazrat Hussain and his 72 Stopped water on the companions and took their housemates hostage by killing them with great disrespect, sunni mat ke bade vidhwano imam ahamed bin hambl, imam gajali vagairah ne yajid ko qatle hossain karne kaa zimmedaar nahin mana he
 Hussein attained martyrdom in this battle
 shiya log 10 muharram ke din isi kaa shok manaate hai
 The Ummayd dynasty remained in power for 70 years and during this period they occupied North Africa, South Europe, Sindh and many parts of Central Asia
 ummyad vansh ke baad abbasi vansh 750 main satta main aayaa
 Shia and Ajmi Muslims greatly assisted the Abbasids in rebelling against the Ummayd dynasty
 ummyad vansh kii ek shakha dakshin spain or kuch or kshetron par simat kar rah gayi
 The notion of only an Islamic empire now began to wane
 abbasiyon ke raaj main islam kaa swarna yug shuru hua
 The Abbasid Khalifa gave great importance to knowledge
 muslim duniya bahut tezi se vishav main gyaan kendra banane lagi
 Many scholars studied books related to literature, philosophy, science, mathematics etc
 of ancient Yunnan, India, China and Persian civilizations and translated them into Arabic
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is ke kaaran bahut bada gyaanakosh itihaas ke pannon main khone se rah gaya
 Muslim scholars did not just translate
 unhone in sabhi vishyon main apni chhap bhi chodi
 Many new discoveries related to anatomy and diseases in medical science were made in India, such as the difference between measles and smallpox was understood
 ibane seenaa ne chikitsa vigyaan se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin jo ki aage ja kar aadhunik chikitsa vigyaan kaa aadhaar baniin
 Therefore, Ibne Sina is also called the father of modern medicine
 isi tarah se al haitham ko prakaashiki vigyaan kaa pita or abu musa jabir ko rasayan shaastra kaa pita bhi kaha jaataa he
 Algebra got its English name from al-khwarizmi's book Kitab-al-jabar-val-muqabla
 al khwarizmi ko bijganit kii pita kaha jaataa he
 In Islamic Philosophy, the philosophy of ancient Greek civilization was developed with Islamic color
 ibane seenaa ne navaplatowad, arastuvaad or islamic dharamshastra ko jod kar siddhanton kii ek nai pranali kii rachana kii
 This created a new wave in philosophy known as Ibnisinism
 isi tarah iban rashud ne arestu ke siddhanton ko islamic siddhanton se jod kar ibnarashuwad ko janm diya
 The art of studying Islamic theology was developed with the help of dualism
 ise kalam kehete hai

 naveen sadi se hi islam main ab ek dharmik rahasyavaad kii bhaavana kaa vikaas hone laga tha jise sufi mat kehete hai
 Ghazali made some such arguments in the context of Sufism and the futility of philosophy that the emphasis of philosophy began to wane
 sufi kaavyatmakataa kii pranali kaa ab janm hua
 Rumi's masnavi is a prime example of this
 sufiyon ke kaaran kai musalmaan dharm kii ore waapas aakarshith hone lage
 Many people of other religions also accepted Islam

 1924 main turki ke pehle pratham vishwayuddh main haar ke baad osmani samrajya samaapt ho gaya or khilaafat kaa ant ho gaya
 Islam has also spread to Europe and America due to the migration of Muslims from other countries
 arab daishon main tel ke utpaadan ke kaaran unki arthvyavastha bahut tezi se sudhar gayi
 Many Renaissance movements took place in Islam in the 19th and 20th centuries
 in main se salfi or devbandi mukhya hai
 An anti-western sentiment also developed which led some Muslims to be attracted to fundamentalism

 Worship of Muslims is called Masjid
 masjid islam main keval ishwar kii prarthana kaa hi centre nahin hota he balkee yahan par muslim samudaay ke log vichaaron kaa aadan pradaan or adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Many amazing examples of Islamic architecture are often seen in mosques

 In Islam, there is a lot of emphasis on wearing shame while wearing clothes
 isaliye adhiktar striyaan burka pahenti hai or kuch striyaan nakaab bhi pahenti hai
 Islam's contact with other religions has been influenced by time and situation
 yah sampark mohammad ke samay se hi shuru ho gaya tha
 Apart from Islam at that time, there were 3 traditions in Arabia
 ek to arab kaa purana dharm tha jisaki vaidhata islam ne nahin sweekaar kii
 The reason for this was that religion did not believe in the unity of God, which was against the basic principles of Islam
 isai dharm or yahudee dharm ko islam ne vaid to sweenkar kar liya par islam ke anusaar in dharmon ke anuyaayiyon or pujaariyon ne inamen badlaav kar diye the
 After reaching Madinah from Mecca, Muhammad entered into a treaty with the Jews there, in which the religious and cultural autonomy of the Jews was accepted

 He was also accepted as legitimate
 in sabhi dharmon ke anuyaayiyon ko dhimmi kaha gaya
 Muslim Caliphs had to pay a fee called Jizya or Jiziya
 iske badale rajya unhen haani na pahunchane or suraksha dene kaa vaada karata tha
 Those who embraced Islam were often discouraged during the tenure of the Ummayads
 iskaa kaaran tha ki kai log keval rajnatik or aarthik laabhon ke liye hi islam kabool karne lage the
 By this, the jizya or jizya was beginning to decrease
 bharat main islam kaa aagaman to arab vyapaaree 7veen sadi main hi le aaye the
 But the early Muslim sultans arrived in India only in the 10th century
 ab tak aadhikarik rup se in sulatanon kaa islamic khalifaaon se koi sambandh nahin tha
 Therefore, all of them adopted their attitude towards Hindu religion according to their understanding

 Based on the electronic model, metals are a lattice of cations covered by electrons
 dhaatuon kii parmparik paribhaasha unke bahya gunon ke aadhaar par di jaati he
 Metals are generally shiny, elastic, shockproof and strong
 dhaatu ushma or vidyut ke achche chaalak hote hai jabaki adhatu saamanytah bhangur, chamakahin or vidyut tathaa ooshmaa ke kuchaalak hote hai
 Chemical elements were first divided into metals and non-metals, although the two groups could not be separated at all
 dhaatu kii paribhaasha karnaa kathin kaary he
 Broadly, we can say that if an element has the following complete or some properties, it will be called a metal: ham yah avashya kah sakate hai ki yadi koi tatv vishuddh avasthaa main chamakdaar or vidyut kaa chaalak nahin he, to vah adhatu he
 Rare metal is found in an unconnected state in nature

 For example - sankraman dhaatuon kaa oxikaran apekshaakrit dhire se hota he
 Metallic oxides form a layer on the metal, such as rusting in iron
 dhatvik oxaid kshareey hote hai jabaki adhatvik oxaid pradhanthya amleey
 Reactions with halogens make metal metallic halide salts
 udaahranarth - The more reactive metals react with water to form alkali and release hydrogen gas
 kam kriyasheel dhaatu saadhaaran taap par jal se abhikriya nahin karte balki ve tapt avasthaa main bhaap se abhikriya karke dhatvik oxaid banaate hai
 Reactions with acids make metal salts and release hydrogen gas - dhaatu aghatvardhaneey hote hai - inako hathode se petakar lambaa kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, an aluminum or copper wire is spread by striking it
 dhaatu tanya bhi hote hai, yani unhen khinchakar ek lambaa taar banaaya ja saktaa he
 This property is not found in non-metals

 kuch dhaatuen shadfalkeey pranali ke manibh banaati hai
 Sometimes atoms of the same metal are arranged in more than one system to form crystals in different forms
 inhen apararupata kahenge
 Metal atoms are electron donors
 crystal main inke dhanayan niyat sthaan main rahenge or mukt electron uske rikt sthanon main
 Thus, these electrons will remain independent and moveable, due to which the metal has high conductivity, reflectivity etc
 properties
 dhaatuon ke lagbhag sabhi gun unki parmaanu sankhya ke aabrt falan hote hai
 These frequencies are notable in atomic volume power and heat conductivity, malleability, tensile, latent heat of compaction, etc

 In 1478, the first book printed in Oxford, a version of Rufinus's Expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum, was printed by another anonymous printer

 Rood's printing included John Ankyville's compendium Totius grammatica that set new standards for the study of Latin grammar
 rud ke baad vishvavidhyalay se judi chapai lagbhag aadhi sadi tak chhitput rup main hoti rahi
 Records or lively works are simply a few numbered forms, and the printing of Oxford did not gain a strong foothold until the 1580s: it followed the efforts of the University of Cambridge which licensed its press in 1534
 crown or stationurs company dwaara landan ke baahar chapai karne par lagaai gai baadhyataaon ke pratikriyasvarup oxford ne vishvavidhyalay main press chalaane kaa aupchaarik adhikaar praapt karne ke liye elizabeth pratham se yachana kii

 The Chancellor of Oxford, Archbishop William Laud, consolidated the legal status of university printing in the 1630s
 laud ne ek vishwastareey ekikrut press kii pariklpana kii
 Oxford will establish it on university property, control its operations, appoint its staff, determine its printing work, and take advantage of the proceeds from it
 To this end, he petitioned Charles i for the rights with which Oxford would be able to compete with the Stationers' Company and the King's Printer, and received a succession of royal grants to aid it
 in sabkon 1636 main oxford ke "great charter" main shaamil kiya gaya jiske tahat vishvavidhyalay ko "har tarah kii kitaaben" chhapane kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Laud also received from the Crown the "privilege" of printing the King James or Authorized Version of Scripture at Oxford
 is "visheshadhikaar" se agle 250 saalon main kaaphi pratifal praapt hua haalanki shuru main yah prasuptavastha main tha
 The Stationers' Company was deeply concerned with the threat of its trade and wasted some of its time in establishing a "tolerance rule" with Oxford
 iske tahat stationurs ne vishvavidhyalay ko apane sampoorn mudran adhikaron kaa istemaal na karne ke liye ek vaarshik kiraye kaa bhugtan kiya - oxford ne un paison kaa istemaal chote prayojanon ke liye nae mudran upkaran kharidne ke liye kiya
 Laud also developed the internal organization of the press
 pratinidhi pranali kii sthapana karne ke alaava unhone "arqitypographes" naamak ek vyapak or vistrut paryvekshi pad kaa bhi nirmaan kiya: is shikshavid par chhapekhane ke prabandhan se lekar prufreeding tak vyavsaay se sambandhit prayek kaary kii dekharekh karne kii jimmedaari thi
 The post was largely an ideal rather than a practical reality but continued to exist in the loosely structured press until the eighteenth century
 vyaavhaarik drushti se oxford kaa warehouse-keeper hi bikri, lekhankan or chhapekhane ke karmchaariyon ko kaam par rakhane or unhen kaam par se nikaalane kaa kaam karata tha
 However, Laud's plans hit deep at both personal and political odds
 raajnneetik sajeesh main beyimaani kii vajah se 1645 main unhen maar daalaa gaya jis samay tak agrezi grihayuddh chhid chukaa tha
 Oxford became a stronghold of royalists during the conflict and many of the city's printers began to focus on political propaganda or the creation of sermons
 is dauraan kuch utkrisht ganitiya or praachya vidya vishaarad rachanaaen saamne ai jinamein hebrew ke rejius profesar edward pokoke dwaara sampadit pustaken ullekhneey hai lekin 1660 main rajshahi kii bahaali se pehle laud ke model vaala ek bhi vishvavidhyalay press sambhav nahin tha
 It was eventually founded by vice-chancellor John Fell, President of Christ Church, Bishop of Oxford and Representative Secretary
 fail laud ko ek shahid maanate the or unhone press se jude unke sapane ko sammaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Using the provisions of the Great Charter, Fell persuaded Oxford to refuse to accept any further payments from the stationers and established the functioning of all university printers in a set of campuses
 is vyavsaay ko nae sheldonian theatre ke tahkhaanon main sthapit kiya gaya jahaan fail ne 1668 main printing presun ko adhishthapit kiya or ise vishvavidhyalay kaa pehla kendriya chhapaakhana banaaya
 When Fell took over a large stock of typographical punches and matrices from Holland, a type foundry was added here named "fell Typees"
 He also persuaded two Dutch typefounders Herman Hermanz and Peter de Valpurgen to work in Oxford for the press
 ant main stationurs kii maaghon ko nakaarte hue fail ne vyaktigat rup se brasenoj ke principal thomas yet or jisas college ke principal sar leoline jenkins ke saath partnership karke 1672 main vishvavidhyalay ke chapai ke adhikaar ko patte par de diya
 Fell's plan was ambitious
 shaikshik or dharmik kaary sambandhi yojanaon ke alaava 1674 main unhone ek broadshit calendar ko chhapana shuru kiya jise oxford almanak ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Initial editions reflected the symbolic ideas of Oxford, but paved the way for realistic study of the city or university in 1766
 almanak ko fail ke samay se aaj tak bina kisi rukawat ke lagaataar har saal chapa jaataa he
 After the beginning of this work, Fell began the first formal program for university printing
 1675 se is dastavej ne saikadon rachanaaon kii pariklpana kii jisamen unani main bible, coptic gospells ke sanskaran or carch fadars kii rachanaaen, arabi or siriyak main paathya pustaken, shastreey darshan ke vyapak sanskaran, kavita, ganit, dher sari madhyayugin chaatravritiyaan or "ab tak prachlit anya kisi bhi rachana se adhik paripurna keedon kaa ek itihaas" bhi shaamil he
 Although some of these proposed titles were seen in Fell's lifetime, the printing of the Bible was the first on his mind
 scripchar kaa sampoorn bhinnrup unani paathya pustak asambhav sabit hua lekin 1675 main oxford ne fail ke shabdic parivartanon or vartanee ke saath aath prishthon vaale ek king james sanskaran ko mudrit kiya
 This work increased conflict with the Stationers Company
 javaabi karrwai main fail ne teen dusht stationurs moses pit, peter parker or thomas gaai ko vishvavidhyalay ke bible ko chhapane kaa kaam patte par de diya jinaki tikshn vanijyik pravritiyaan oxford ke bible vyapaar ko uttejit karne main kaaphi mahatvapurn sabit hui
 His involvement, however, led to a long legal battle between Oxford and the Stationers, and the litigation continued for the remainder of Fell's life
 1686 main unka dehanth ho gaya
 Yate and Jenkins had died before Fell, leaving no clear heir to oversee the raid after his death
 natijatan unki vasiyat ke anusaar trust main bhagidaaron kaa stock or patta oxford vishvavidhyalay ke liye chhod diya gaya or un par ek saath "mere press kii sansthaapak samagriyon" kaa bhaar daal diya gaya
 Fell's chief trustee was Delegate Henry Aldrich, Dean of Christ Church who took a keen interest in the decorative work of Oxford's books
 unhone or unke sahyogiyon ne parker or gaai ke patte ke ant or 1691 main ek nae samjhaute kii adhyakshata kii jiske dwaara stationurs ne apane na bike hue adhyayansheel stock sahit oxford ke sampoorn mudran visheshadhikaar ko patte par de diya
 This ended the friction between Oxford and the Stationers, despite the violent opposition from some of the Sheldonian printers, and effectively led to a stable university printing business
 1713 main eldrich ne cleyarendon bhawan main press ke sthanantaran kaa prabandh kiya
 It was named in honor of the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Edward Hyde, First Earl of Clarendon
 oxford vidya dwaara banaae rakhe jane vaale iske nirmaan kaary kaa vittaposhan unki pustak *da history of da rebelion and civil wars in england se praapt raashiyon se kiya gaya
 In fact, most of the money came from Oxford's new Bible printer John Baskett, and vice-chancellor William Dallon did not pay much of the proceeds from Clarendon's work
 kisi bhi paristhiti main iskaa vparinaam broad street main sheldonian ke alaava nicholas hoxmoor kii sundar lekin avyaavhaarik sanrachana thi
 The press worked here until 1830 and its functions were divided into different parts of the building between the so-called Learned Side and the Bible Side
 aam taur par kaha jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke armbh main press ke vistaar par viraam lag gaya tha
 This time there was a lack of a celebrity like Fell and it was the time of ineffectual or quarrelsome people like Archetypographus and the archivist Thomas Hieron, and the first Bible-like flawed plans of the basket which was a brilliantly crafted but misprinted section and called St
 The wine became known as the Bible after Luke noticed a typing error
 is samay ke anya mudran main richard olestery ke manansheel granth or thomas hanmar ke shakespeare kaa chah khandon vaala sanskaran shaamil tha
 Looking back, it all proved to be a relatively minor victory
 ve sab ek vishvavidhyalay press ke utpaada the jinamein badhati gadabadi, kshay or bhrasht pratha kaa samavesh tha or jo khud ko jivit rakhane ke liye zyada se zyada apni bible or prarthana pustak sambandhi kaaryon ko patte par dene par nirbhar tha
 This business was saved by the intervention of only one delegate, William Blackstone
 press kii arajak sthiti se naaraaz hokar or vaais chancelar jorge hadesford se dushmani mol lekar blackstone ne chhapekhane kii baariki se jaanch karwaai lekin iske uljhangrast sanghathan or dhoort prakriyaaon ke nishkarsh ke rup main unhen apane sahyogiyon ke keval "udhaas or tiraskaarpurn chuppi" yaa "zyada se zyada nistej udaseenta" kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 gusse main aakar blackstone ne may 1757 main hadesford ke uttaradhikari thomas randolf ko likhe gaye ek lambey patr ko prakashit karke vishvavidhyalay ko apni jimmedaariyon ko puraa karne ke liye majaboor kiya
 Here, Blackstone presented the press as a congenital institution that had omitted all the false pretense of serving a scholarship "while spending time in a slurry of lazy oblivion 


 overbearing mechanics"
 in sharmnaak maamalon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye blackstone ne andhadhundh sudhaar kii maang kii jo dailygeton kii shaktiyon or dayitvon ko sakhti se sthapit karegaa, aadhikarik rup se unke vichaaron or karypranali ko record karegaa or chhapekhane ko ek kushal aadhaar pradaan karegaa
 However, Randolph ignored the document and the change did not begin until Blackstone threatened to take legal action
 vishvavidhyalay ne 1760 tak blackstone ke sabhi sudhaaron ko apnaane kii disha main kadam uthaaya tha
 By the late 18th century, the press had gained more attention
 aarambhik copirite kaanoon ne stationurs ko kamjor bananaa shuru kar diya tha or vishvavidhyalay ko anbhavi printeron ko apana bible kaary patte par dene main ksht hone laga
 The lease became a very risky proposition when the American War of Independence deprived Oxford of its biblical significant market and forced delegates to offer press shares to those who "traded for mutual benefit" Take care and manage troubles "
 adtalis sheyaron ko jari kiya gaya jiske saath vishvavidhyalay ke paas ek niyantrak hissaa tha
 At the same time, traditional scholarship revitalized the works of Jeremiah Markland and Peter Elmsley, as well as texts edited by many academics in mainland Europe in the early nineteenth century - with August Emanuel Becker and Karl Wilhelm Dindorf being the most prominent
 donon ne 50 saalon tak ek dailygat ke rup main kaam karne vaale unani vidwaan thomas gasford ke aamantran par sanskarnon ko taiyaar kiya
 In his time, the developing press established distributors in London and employed bookseller Joseph Parker in Turl Street in Oxford for this purpose
 parker ne bhi press main apane share kharid liye
 The expansion pushed the press out of the Clarendon building
 1825 main dailygeton ne vorcester college se jameen karidaa

 Situated at the corner of Walton Street and Great Clarendon Street, northwest from Oxford City Center, the site retains the oup's main office in the twenty-first century
 press ne ab baari badlaav ke yug main pravesh kiya
 Even in 1830, it was a joint-stock printing business in the backward field of education offering scholarly creations to a relatively small group of readers, such as scholars and clerics
 ek itihaaskaar ke mutabik yah press "sharmile rogabhramiyon ke ek samaaj" kaa utpaada tha
 Its trade depended largely on the sale of cheap bibles and its delegates were symbols of Gasford or Martin Ruth

 The 1830s must have seen a restless departure of steam power for printing
 is samay thomas combay press main shaamil hue or 1872 main apni maut tak vishvavidhyalay ke mudrak bane rahe
 Coombe was a better businessman than most of the delegates but still no promoter: he failed to materialize India's vast commercial potential of paper which turned out to be one of Oxford's most profitable trade secrets in later years
 phir bhi, combay ko vyavsaay main apane sheyaron ke madhyam se kaaphi dhan praapt hua or volverkot ke diwalia paper mil kaa adhigrahan or naveekaran kaa kaam bhi mila
 He funded schooling in the press and the renewable fund of St
 Barnabas Church in Oxford
 combay kaa dhan itnaa bad gaya ki ve pre-rafelit broorahud ke pehle sangrakshak ban gaye or unhone or unki patni martha ne is samooh ke aarambhik kaaryon ke adhikansh hisse ko kharid liya jinamein wiliam holman hunt kaa da lit of da world bhi shaamil tha
 Coombe however had little interest in the production of a beautifully printed composition in the press
 unke chhapekhane se judaa sabase janaa mana granth elices adventures in vanderland kaa trutipurna pratham sanskaran tha jise 1865 main iske lekhak levis carol ke kharch par oxford dwaara mudrit kiya gaya tha
 The Royal Commission of 1850 and a new secretary Bartholomew Price were imposed on the functioning of the university to make radical changes in the press
 1868 main niyukt hone vaale price ne pehle hi vishvavidhyalay ko suzav diya tha ki vyavsaay kii "chaukas adheekshan" ke liye ek kushal kaaryakari adhikari kii jarurat thi jisamen alexander macmillan ke saath kii jane vaali saudebaaji bhi shaamil thi jo 1863 main oxford kii chapai ke prakaashak ban gaye or 1866 main saste or praathmik schuli pustakon kii cleyarendon press shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan karne main price kii madad kii - shaayad aisa pehali baar hua tha jab oxford ne cleyarendon chapai kaa istemaal kiya
 Under Price's leadership, the press began to take its modern shape
 1865 tak dailygasi kaa sarvakalik hona band ho gaya or isaki jagah paanch sarvakalik or paanch kanisht padon kaa vikaas hua jinhen vishvavidhyalay kii taraf se hone vaali niyukti ke madhyam se bharaa jaataa tha or iske saath hi saath vaais chancelar ek paden dailygat hota tha: jo gutbaji ke liye ek kaanchagrih tha jisaki rakhwali or niyantran price ne badi chaturaai se kii
 The university repurchased its shares because its holders either retired or died
 khaaton ke paryvekshan kaa kaam 1867 main navnirmit vitt samiti ko de diya gaya
 Major new lines of work started
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1875 main dailygeton ne fredrick maiks mular ke sampadakatv ke tahat secred books of da east shrinkhalaa ko anumodith kiya jisase ek vyapak pathakatv ko dharmik vichaaron kii ek bahut badi shrinkhalaa praapt hui
 Price similarly moved OUP toward publication in its own right
 1863 main parker ke saath press kaa rishta khatm ho gaya or 1870 main kuch bible rachanaaon ke liye landan main ek chote se jildasajikhana ko karidaa gaya
 Macmillan's contract expired in 1880 and was not renewed
 is samay tak, landan ke patternoster ro main bible ke bhandaran ke liye oxford kaa ek godaam bhi tha or 1880 main iske prabandhak henry fraud ko vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak kaa aupchaarik kitaab diya gaya
 Froud benefited from the book trade, not the university, and he remained an enigma to many
 oxford ke staff magazine "da cleyarendanian" ke ek mrityulekh ke anusaar "yahan oxford main hamamen se kuch logon ke paas hi unka vyaktigat gyaan tha"
 uske baavjood, vyavsaay main pustakon kii nai linon ko shaamil karke, 1881 main new testament ke sanshodhit sanskaran ke vishaal prakaashan kii adhyakshata karke or 1896 main britain ke baahar neuyork main press kaa pehla karyaalay sthapit karne main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaakar fraud oupi ke vikaas ke liye bahut mahatvapurn ban gaye
 Price converted OUP
 1884 main jab ve sachiv ke pad se ritair hue tab dailygeton ne vyavsaay ke antim sheyaron ko waapas kharid liya
 The press was now wholly owned by the university, including a paper mill, a raid, a bindbank and a warehouse
 schuli kitabon or aadhunik vidwaanon ke granthon jaise james clerk maxwell ke e treetaise on electricity and magnetismo ke shaamil hone se iskaa utpaadan bad gaya tha jo oinstin ke vichaar kaa mul siddhant sabit hua
 By simply establishing it without abandoning its tradition and quality of work, Price began to transform OUP into a cautious and modern publisher
 1879 main unhone prakaashan kaa kaam bhi apane haath main le liya jiske falswaroop vah prakriya apni charam seemaa par pahunch gai arthath vishaal pariyojna kaa aagaman hua jo oxford english dictionari bana

 The dictionary began to appear in printed form in 1884, but the first edition was not completed until 1928, 13 years after Murray's death, costing around £ 375,000
 yah vishaal vittiya boj or iske nihitarth price ke uttaridhikariyon ke kandhe par aa gaya
 The next secretary had to suffer a lot to solve this problem
 Philip Lightton Gayle was appointed in 1884 by Vice Chancellor Benjamin Jowett
 belleole main apni shiksha or landan prakaashan main apni prishthbhumi hone ke baavjood press ke kaary gail kii samaj se baahar the
 Delegates began working around him and eventually the university fired Gail in 1897

 " kannan ko apni nai bhoomika main saarvajanik buddhi kaa bahut kam avasar mila tha
 As a highly talented classist, he became the head of business which was traditionally successful but now moving into unknown territory
 khud-ba-khud visheshgy shaikshik rachanaaon or anirbharsheel bible vyapaar dictionari kii badhati laagat or uniwarsity chest ke liye press ke yogadanon se judi jaruraton ko puraa na kar sakaa

 vishvavidhyalay kii raajnneeti or jadta ko chaunkaate hue unhone fraud or landan karyaalay ko sampoorn vyavsaay kaa vittiya ingine banaaya
 In 1906, Froude acquired Oxford's World Classics and began to drive Oxford on the path of popular literature
 usee varsh unhone bacchon ke sahitya or chikitsa pustakon ke prakaashan main madad karne ke liye hoder and stafaton ke saath ek tathakthith "sanyukt udhyam" main pravesh kiya
 Cannan as Froude's assistant, his Oxford protégé Assistant Secretary Humphrey S
 Ensuring the continuation of these efforts by appointing Milford
 1913 main fraud ke ritair hone ke baad mileford prakaashak bane or 1945 main ritair hone tak aakarshak landan vyavsaay or ise report karne vaale shakha karyaalayon kaa shashan kaary sambhala
 press kii vittiya sthiti ko dekhte hue kannan ne vidwaanon ke pustakon yaa yahaan tak ki dictionari ko asambhav deytaon ke rup main mahatv pradaan karnaa band kar diya
 He commented that "I don't think the university can produce enough books to ruin us"
 unke prayaason ko chhapekhane kii kushalta se kaaphi madad mili
 Horace Hart was appointed to the post of Comptroller of the Press in Gayle's own time, but proved more effective than the Secretary
 With extraordinary energy and professionalism, he improved and expanded Oxford's printing resources and developed Heart's Rules as the first style guide for Oxford's proof-readers
 iske baad ye duniya bhar ke chhapekhane main maanak ban gaye
 In addition, he suggested the creation of the Clarendon Press Institute as a social club for employees in Walton Street
 jab 1891 main yah santhaan khulaa tab press ke paas isamen shaamil hone ke liye prashikshuon sahit 540 karmchaaree the
 Finally, his general interest in printing led Hart to list "failed types" and then used them in a series of Tudor and Stuart facsimile volumes for the press before his death in 1915 due to ill health
 tab tak oupi ek sankeern mudrak se vishvavidhyalay ke swaamitv vaale ek vyapak prakaashan pratishthan main badal chukaa tha jisaki antarrashtriya upasthiti badhati ja rahi thi
 Froud had no doubt that the press business in London had grown substantially and was appointed on contract with the start of the sale
 saat saal baad vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak ke rup main fraud ek chhap ke rup main apane khud ke naam ke saath-saath 'oxford uniwarsity press' kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 This style persisted until recent times and two types of impressions were originating from the London offices of the press
 'vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak' ke naam se jane jane vaale antim vyakti jon gilbert newton brown the jo apane sahakarmiyon ke bich 'bruno' ke naam se jane jate the
 The differences implied by the impressions were subtle but important
 kamishan par landan dwaara jari kiye jane vaale pustakon kii style par 'henry fraud' yaa 'hamphri mileford' kii chhap thi jis par oupi kaa koi ullekh nahin tha maano prakaashak unhen apane aap jari kar rahe the jabaki vishvavidhyalay ke sheershak ke adheen prakashkon dwaara jari kiye jane vaale pustakon par 'oxford uniwarsity press' kii chhap thi
 Both of these categories were mostly controlled by London, while the Oxford Clarendon Press looked after the books
 kamishan kitabon kaa makasad landan vyavsaay ke upree kharchon ko vittposhit karne ke liye kamdhenu gaay kii tarah kaam karnaa tha kyonki press ne is prayojan ke liye alag se kisi sansaadhan kii vyavastha nahin kii thi
 Yet Froud particularly noted that all commission books published by him received the approval of the delegates
 yah vidwaanon yaa puraavidon ke preson ke liye koi asaamaanya vyavastha nahin thi
 Price immediately prioritized Froud's joint publication with the Cambridge University Press of a revised version of the Bible to the extent that it was likely to be a 'bestseller' to keep all the resources of the press to keep pace with demand Work is required
 It was a complete revival of the Bible text from the earliest original Greek and Hebrew versions superseding the Authorized Version of 1611
 fraud kii agency ko thik samay par sanshodhit sanskaran ke liye sthapit kiya gaya jise 17 may 1881 ko prakashit kiya gaya or prakaashan se pehle or tab se ek khatarnaak dar par isaki ek million pratiyon kii bikri hui haalanki atyadhik utpaadan kii vajah se ant main laabh main kami aa gai
 Although Fraud was by no means an Oxford man and had no social pretense to be so, he was still a good businessman capable of striking the magic balance between vigilance and enterprise
 unke man main bahut pehle se hi press ke videshi vyapaar ko sabase pehle europe main or uske baad lagaataar america, canada, bharat or africa main unnat banane kaa vichaar hilor maar rahaa tha
 He was largely responsible for setting up depots in Edinburgh, Toronto and Melbourne along with the US branch
 fraud ne lekhakon se nipatane, jildasaji, vitaran or vigyaapan sahit oupi kii chhap vaali kitabon ke liye adhikansh prachaalan tantron ko niyantrit kiya or keval sampadakeey kaary or chapai kii dekharekh kaa kaam oxford dwaara kiya gaya
 Froud regularly sent money to Oxford but felt privately that the business had little capital and would soon vacate the university's resources if it did not find a commercial base
 unhen khud ek nirdhaarit seemaa tak vyavsaay main paison kaa nivesh karne kii adhikaar tha lekin paariwarik pareshaaniyon kii vajah se ve aisa nahin kar paa rahe the
 Hence his interest in foreign sales arose because there was an opportunity to make money in India during the decades of 1880s and 1890s, while the European book market was facing a recession
 lekin press ke faisle se fraud kii duuri kaa matlab tha ki jab tak koi pratinidhi unki tarafdaari nahin karata tab tak ve is niti ko prabhavit karne main asamarth the
 Froud spent most of his time working under the mandate given by the delegates
 In 1905, while applying for pension, he was the then Vice Chancellor, J
D
 R
 Wrote to mcgrath that during his seven-year tenure as manager of the Bible Warehouse, the London business had an average sales of around £ 20,000 and a profit of £ 1887 per year
