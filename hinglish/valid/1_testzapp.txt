 X-rays or X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is 10 to 0
01 nanometers
 yah chikitsa main nidaan ke liye sarvaadhik prayog kii jaati he
 It is a type of ionizing radiation, therefore dangerous
 kai bhashaaon main ise rontjan vikiran bhi kehete hai, jo ki iske anveshak wilhelm coored rontjan ke naam par aadhaarit he
 The Röntgen equivalent human is its classical measuring unit
 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form

 But the first conclusive results came from experiments with Lave, Friederisch and Kniping, and the wavelength of X-rays was proved
 is prayog ke pashchaat eksre kii tarangaprakruti suspasht karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parinaamon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parimaanon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke anek praytn hue
 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured

 In the words of Baan, this story has transcended the earlier two stories

 Probably these stories were the legend of Gunadhya and the legend of Subandhu

 Meanwhile, there is a story of King Chandrapid and his friend Vaishampayan by sage Jabali
 ujjayini main tarapid naam kaa ek raja tha jiskaa shuknas naam kaa ek budhimaan mantri tha
 The king received a son named Chandrapid and the minister's son's name was Vaishampayan

 Sanskrit prose has reached the sublime sense of poetry by coming to the arrow

 Even then, he has to face the roar of wildlife present as obsolete words
 webar kaa yah akshep sarvatha niraadhaar nahin he
 Kadambari gives the impression of being an object of intellectual luxury of the Pandits due to its inextricability, concordance, syllogism and long syllables
 vastutah koi vishay, bhav tathaa abhivyanjana-prakaar aisa nahin rahaa, jiskaa baan ne aadyant manthan na kiya ho
 The gentle critic has praised this achievement of the arrow by saying 'banocchishtam Jagatsarvam'

 Cassia refers to a fragrant leaf of bay laurel
 Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinct taste and aroma
 in patton kaa istemaal aksar soup, dampukht, brejon or pate jaise bumadhyasagariya vyanjanon main swaad ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The fresh leaves are very dim and do not develop their full flavor until they are broken and dried for several weeks

 Cassia is one of the most widely used herbs in cuisine in Europe and North America
 agar saabut khaaya jaae to, tej pattey tikt hote he or iskaa swaad tej, kadava hota he
 As with many spices and flavor-enhancing ingredients, the aroma of bay leaves is more notable than its taste
 sukhaye jane par, isaki khushboo jadi booti jaisi, thodi si pushp jaisi or kuch had tak ajvayan ke pattey or jalanim ke jaisi hoti he
 Michelin, which is a component of many aromatic oils used in making perfumes, can be extracted from bay leaves

 These leaves also spread their taste in many classical French dishes
 in pattiyon ko aksar inke puure aakaar main istemaal kiya jaataa he or parosane se pehle hataa diya jaataa he
 Bay leaves are often used in Indian and Pakistani cuisines as an ingredient in biryani and other spicy dishes, and in hot spices - though not in everyday household kitchens
 tej pattey ko khaanaa pakaane se pehle kuchlaa yaa pisa ja saktaa he
 Crushed leaves provide more of their desired fragrance than standing leaves, but are more difficult to remove and are therefore often used in a muslin bag or tea bag
 pisi hui pattiyon ko khadey pattey kii jagah istemaal kiya ja saktaa he or inhen hataane kii jarurat nahin hoti, lekin yah vardhit satahi kshetra ke kaaran apekshaakrit majboot hota he or kuch vyanjanon main banaavat vaanchhneeya nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Bay leaves can also be used in the pantry to ward off edible pests, flies and cockroaches
 yah bhi sach he ki roman log saint velentine diwas par apane takiye ke neeche ek sookhaa tej patta rakhte hai
 It was believed that because of this leaf, the user encounters his future spouse in a dream
 madhya yug main tej pattiyon ko garbhpaat karaane vaala or kai jaadui gunon vaala mana jaataa tha
 They were sometimes used to keep insect-mites away, due to the presence of loric acid in the leaf which gave it insecticidal properties
 tej pattiyon main kai aise gun hai jo unhen ucch rakt sharkara, migraine sir dard, bacterial or kavak sankraman or gastric ulcer ke ilaaj main upyogi banaate hai
 Bay leaves and berries have been used for their astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emetic and appetite-enhancing properties

 tej patta kavak-virdohi or jeevanu-virdohi bhi hota he or iskaa istemaal gathiya, rajorodh or pet dard ke ilaaj ke liye kiya gaya he
 Some members of the laurel family, as well as unrelated but identical mountainous laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are toxic to humans and animals
 jabaki in paudhon ko paak istemaal ke liye kahin bhi bechaa nahin jaataa he, tej pattey ke saath unki samanta ne is dharna ko bal diya he ki tej pattey ko khaanaa pakaane ke baad bhojan se hataa diya janaa chahie kyonki ve jahrile hote hai
 This is not true - bay leaves can be eaten without toxic effects
 haalanki, ve puri tarah se khaanaa pakaane ke baad bhi bahut kathor bane hue rahete hai or agar inhen sabut yaa bade tukdon main nigal liya jaae to ve pachan tantra main kharonch yaa ghutan kaa jokhim paidaa kar sakate hai
 Thus in most recipes using bay leaves it is recommended to remove them after the cooking process
 thand se mukt yaa halke thand vaale kshetron main mali yah pate hai ki zamin main rope gaye be laurel paudhe swechha se vishaal vriksh, 38 feet or unase bhi lambe ho jate hai; lekin chantai karte rahane par be laurel ped ek choti jhaadi kii tarah badhata he
 Bay laurel can also be grown in containers, the size of which prevents its growth as the final shape of the tree
 nae paudhon ko leering, yaa kalam ke dwaara ugaaya jaataa he, kyonki beej se ugaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 Bay trees are difficult to grow from seed, partly because of the low seed germination rate and long germination period
 The germination rate of freshly removed pods is typically 40%, while the germination rate of seeds including dried seeds and / or pods is even lower
 iske alaava, be laurel ke beej kii ankuran avadhi 50 din yaa usase adhik hoti he, jo ankurit hone se pehle beej ke sad jane ke khatre ko badha detaa he
 Treating the seeds with gibberellic acid can be as useful in increasing the yield of the seed as carefully monitoring the moisture level in the root circulation
