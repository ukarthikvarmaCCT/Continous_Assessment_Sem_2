 Shunkers Weekly was the first cartoon magazine published in India
 isaki aavriti saptahik hua karti thi
 The publication of Shankers Weekly was started by Shankar Pillai, a cartoonist in India who is called the father of cartoon art
 shankars vikali, shankar kaa sapana tha jo 1948 main saakaar hua
 Shunkers Weekly was released by the then Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 shankars vikali main bharat ke kai jane-maane cartooniston ke rajnatik or saamaajik cartoon prakashit hote the jinamein ranga, kutti, bal thakare or kaak-cartoonist jaise anek cartooniston ke cartoon shaamil hote the
 In its long tenure, this magazine provided a platform to new cartoonists as well as the publication of cartoons of popular cartoonists

 Renowned cartoonists Ranga and VG Narendra had started their cartoonist life only from Shunkers Weekly
 shankars vikali vishuddh bhartiya rajnatik cartoonon par aadhaarit saptahik patrika thi jisamen bharatbar ke cartooniston ke netaaon or sarkaar ke kriya-kalapon par tikhe cartoon hote the
 This was the reason that this magazine also faced trouble during the Emergency and due to pressure 27 years later in 1975, the publication of this unique and only magazine stopped

 The Japanese language is the main language and official language of Japan
 dwitiya mahayuddh se pehle korea, formosa or sakhaleen main bhi japani boli jaati thi
 Even now the number of Japanese is known enough in Korea and Farmosa, but gradually their number is decreasing
 bhashavid ise 'ashlisht-yogtmak bhashaa' maanate hai
 The Japanese language does not belong to the chinese-tibetan language family
 bhashavid ise khud kii japani bhashaa-parivaar main rakhte hai 
 These are written in a mixture of two scripts: Kanji script and Kana script
 is bhashaa main aadar-suchak shabdon kaa ek bada tantra he or bolne main "pich-system" zaruri hota he
 Many words have been taken from Chinese language in it
 japani bhashaa kis bhashaa kul main sammilit he is sambandh main ab tak koi nishchit mat sthapit nahin ho sakaa he
 But it is clear that Japanese and Korean languages have a close relationship and many scholars today believe that the Korean language should be included in the Altaic language
 japani bhashaa main bhi uccharan or vyakaran sambandhi anek visheshtaayen he jo anya altaai bhashaaon ke samaan hai parantu ye visheshtaayen ab tak itani kaaphi nahin samajhi jaati raheen jinamein ham nishchit rup se kah saken ki japani bhashaa altike bhashaakul main i ek he
 Haiku is its major poetic genre
 japani bhashaa kab se aarambh hoti he is sambandh main pramaan na hone ke kaaran nishchit rup se kuch bataaya nahin ja saktaa
 a Chinese book written in the third century gives the names of some places and people in Japan, from which it can be inferred that the Japanese language had developed at that time
 7 veen-8veen shatabdi me japani logon ne chini bhashaa or lipi sikhi or chini bhashaa main itihaas, bhugol aadi likhe gaye
 Gradually, a solution was found to write Japanese language in Chinese script
 japan main sabase puraani kavitaaon kaa sangrah maanayoshyu isi upaay se likhaa gaya tha
 Chinese words are singular
 is kaaran uske ek-ek lipichihn se japani bhashaa kaa uccharan prakat karnaa atyant saral tha
 These types of scripts are called "manyo" scripts
 in lipiyon ke adhyayan se gyaat hua he ki us samay kii japani bhashaa main aath prakaar ke swar or shabdon main swar anurupata hoti thi
 Even now, like the words Kokoro, Atama, etc
, there are many words made from the same vowel
 china ke saath gamnaagaman band ho jane ke kaaran japan kii api samskruti kaa vikaas hua
 Vowel conformity was omitted in the language and the number of vowels was reduced to only five
 chini lipi-chihnon ko saral karke japan kii apni do prakaar kii lipiyaan "hiraagaana" or "katakana" ban gayi
 Hiragana created by simplifying the Chinese script
 aarambh main yah lipi visheshtya striyon main lokapriy hui
 The language was written only in the same script, excluding the Chinese script
 katakana chini bhashaa main likhi pustak ko japani kii bhanti padhane kii drushti se banaai gai
 Often it was constructed with a part of the Chinese script icon
 aarambh se hi yah lipi chini lipiyon ke saath milakar likhi jaati thi
 At this time, the study of Sanskrit language and script had also started in Japan through China
 nai japani lipiyon kii varnmaala sanskrit kii varnmaala ke anukaran main banaai gai
 The political center of this time was Western Japan
 purvi japan ke sainikon ke aane se bhashaa main visheshkar uccharan main parivartan aa gaya
 During this time the power of the generals increased and for some time remain the Kamakura political center near Tokyo
 is kaal main anek ladaaiyaan hone ke kaaran pracheen bhashaa kii parampara tuutane lagi or uccharan tathaa vyakaran me bada parivartan aa gaya
 The people of Europe engaged in the last part of this period and studied the Japanese language for the purpose of spreading Christianity
 unke likhe vyakaran or shabdkosh uplabdh hai
 The condition of the Japanese language of that time is well known by many books written by him
 isi samay chapai kaa vikaas hua or buddha dharm, canafucheevaad, main bhi chikitsa shaastra aadi kii pustaken chhaapi gai
 But books written in Chinese were printed more and the number of books written in Japanese was less
 is kaal tak pracheen bhashaa kaa kaal kah sakate hai; parantu is samay ke ant main bhashaa kaa rup badalakar aadhunik bhashaa kaa rup dhaaran karne laga
 In this way, the people of the Tokugawa family began to rule in place of the emperor, Tokyo became the capital and the Jagirdari system became firm
 aarambh main osaka saanskrithik centre tha parantu 18 veen shatabdi ke antim bhaag se "edo" saanskrithik centre bana
 Literature was mostly written in the dialect of Edo
 desh jaagiron main vibhajit hone ke kaaran or logon ke jaagiron ke baahar aane jane kaa avasar bahut kam hone ke kaaran is kaal main anek boliyon kaa vikaas hua
 Pronunciation became like the modern language and the rules of conversion of verbs into grammar began to be simplified
 aarambh main edo main bhinn bhinn boliyaan bolanewaale ikatthe hue the parantu dhire dhire edo nagar kii apni boli kaa vikaas hua
 It has developed further and has become a common language nowadays
 is samay pracheen japani bhashaa tathaa sahitya kaa adhyayan bahut adhik kiya jane laga
 From this time the method of writing Chinese scripts more and more in Hirakana was preferred
 is kaal main samrat swayan rajya karne lage ore tokio rajdhani bana
 The dialect of this place started to be accepted as a common language
 europe ke saath sampark sthapit hua tathaa europe ke anek shabd chini lipi main anudit hokar jansadharan main prachlit hone lage
 Due to excessive use of Chinese scripts, many words with the same pronunciation became
 europe ke sahitya ke anuwaad se bhashaa main nai shaileyon kaa vikaas hua
 Literature in the colloquial language became increasingly popular from 1887 onwards
 gyaan vigyaan kii pustaken ab tak kii lekhan style main upar se neeche kii ore likhi jane ke badale bain se dayee ore likhi jane lageen
 This trend is increasing even more and after the Second World War, the government mandates are also written from left to right
 ab patrapatrika, radio, televijan aadi sadhano se sarvasaamaanya bhashaa kaa prachaar atyant teevrgati se bad rahaa he or desh ke kone kone main tokio kii boli samajhi tathaa boli jane lagi
 In order to make the language as simple as possible by reducing the more used Chinese scripts, writing the Chinese script in short form, the use of Hirakana and Katakana uniformly, studying the Roman script etc
 Is being tried 1946 main jab japan kaa nayaa samvidhan hirkaana or chini lipiyon ko milakar likhaa gaya tha us samay se praaia: samast patrapatrikaon main bhi yahi upaay apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Katakana is used when copying the pronunciation of foreign words
 kuch log tiperiter ke liye katakana kaa prayog karte hai parantu yah ab tak lokapriy nahin ho sakaa he
 There are many dialects in Japanese language because of the characteristics of Indian society in Japanese society and the language is very old
 jin main mukhya kyushyu he
 There is a clear difference in the dialects of western Japan and eastern Japan, especially in their pronunciation
 meji kaal se shiksha ke prachaar ke kaaran har kshetra main sarvamaanya bhashaa tokio kii boli, samajhi jaati he
 Apart from the regional dialects, different dialects are spoken by distinction of profession, male and female, upper class, lower class etc
 upar ke har prakaar ke bhedon ke saath saath prayek japani ko sunaanevaale ke bade chote ke bhedon ke saath saath prayek japani ko sunanevaale ke bade chote ke bhed se teen prakaar kii style main bolnaa padataa he
 When speaking to people who are smaller or equal to you, one has to make a sentence of type Da, while speaking with some elder, desu type and while talking with great respect, one has to make a sentence of type Gojaimasu
 likhit bhashaa main bhi aru or arimasu donon sheliyaan hai
 Vowel: a e u a o vyanjan : sadaa swar ke saath hokar uccharit hone ke kaaran keval vyanjan prakat karanevaali lipi nahin he
 Following is the consonant script: k ki ku ke ko cu kyo Gee Gee Gye Gye Gye Gyeo sa shi su se so shy shyu shyo xxwrep 8 j j t chi tsu te to c chyu jyo Give it na ni nu ne no nya new nyo Hoo hoo ha ho ha hoo hoo saghosh ke liye vishesh lipi chihn nahi hai
 Aghosha script has two marks placed on it
 jab japani lipi bani, kycu kyo jaise uccharan nahin the
 These have since been adopted by the influence of the Chinese language
 isaliye ye mul lipi ke baad chote akshar lagaakar prakat kiye jate hai
 In addition to the above written pronunciation, there are two more: n ke liye When sure, like a good word, i also think that k is a quantity
 is maatra kii prakat karne ke liye chote akshar tasu likhte hai
 The Japanese words are of musical accent
 swaraghaat ke prakaar bahut kam hai
 The following are only four types of distinctions in four-volume words
 japani bhashaa main ek hi uccharan or vibhinn arthvaale anek shabd hai
 Even in accent, those words do not have the power to distinguish
 kami or kami ke uccharan, swaraghaat main koi antar nahin he
 We can know the difference between the two only by looking at their Chinese script
 parantu yah swaraghaat vaakya main shabdasmooh ko acchhee bhanti bataata he
 Niwano sakuro mo minna chite shimta vatakushi va nihongo no benkyo o shite orimasu Thus, the place of words in a sentence coincides with Hindi a lot
 parantu japani bhashaa ke sanyogatmak na hokar yogtmak hone ke kaaran kuch visheshtaayen dhyaan dene yogya hai
 Nouns do not use fractions
 vaakya main sangya kaa sambandh bataane ke liye sahaayak shabd yaa sahaayak kriyaayein lagaai jaati hai
 There is no change in "vatakushi" to reveal "I" in the above sentence
 karta kaarak ko vyakt karne ke liye sahaayak shabd "va" lagaaya he
 There is no gender discrimination in noun, but there is some distinction between conscious, unconscious things like humans, animals etc
 sangya ke rup main koi bhed nahin hota parantu baad main aanevaali kriya main, ekvachan bahuvachan ke rup main bhed aa jate hai
 The prefix "o" is applied to the noun to show respect or humility
 jaise : tegaami xxrep 8 
 patr Otegami xxrep 7 
 Your letter aadaraaspad se, barabarwale se, chote darje ke logon se athwa namrata se kehane ke liye bhinn bhinn shabd hai
 It is very difficult to use these words properly like i do
 vatakushi hri visheshkar striyaan kahati hai
 Men also use this word to show humility in front of elders
 vaatashi Vashi, Boku, Ore, atai : choti ladkiyaan The verb has metamorphosis
 ek shabd do yaa adhik matraaon kaa hota he1 a feature in the verb is words like mieru kikएeru which are used only in relation to unconscious objects
 hindi kii bhanti sangya main suru lagaakar kriyaayein banaai jaati hai jaise- Shippetsu Suru But one of the features in relation to such verbs is that when such a verb comes at the end of the sentence, sometimes the sentence is completed by putting "suru"
 jaise rokuji kisho
 Shichiji Shippetsu
 
 There are two types of negatives like kuroi, akai, such as ikrant and shijukana, genkina
 visheshnon main bhi kriya kii bhanti rupaparivartan hota he
 The manner of counting human beings, animals etc
 animals and unconscious things is different: sahaayak shabd main rup parivartan nahin hota
 Forms of words are very small, mostly one volume
 teen matraaon se adhik lambey shabd bahut kam hai
 These words serve as the inflection and adverb of the genitive and conjunctive words of Hindi
 sambandhbodhak ga o ni no de paan shabd hai : Ram c Yuki Masu

 Asa wa hai shi, Yoru and Osoi shi, taihenda Have trouble swatantra shabd or paratantr shabd main vibhajit hote hai
 The term paratantra is mostly of one to four quantities but two three paratantras can also be applied simultaneously
 swatantra shabdon main chaar matraavaale adhik hai or mul bhaag chini lipi main tathaa rup parivartan karanevaale bhaag hirkaana main likhe jate hai
 Very large, large, sometimes 10-15 volumes of words can be formed by adding more Chinese scripts
 parantu teen chaar matraaon ke shabd adhik pasand kiye jane ke kaaran chini lipiyon ke kisi kisi hisse ko katkar laghu shabd bananaa pasand kiya jaataa he, jaise"nihon kyoshokuin kumhai" ke sthaan par "nikkyoso" is prakaar ke anek shabd banaae jane ke kaaran ek hi uccharan ke evam anek arth prakat karanevaale shabd bahut milte hai
 The words made in Japan have a place of utmost importance in the Japanese language by adding Chinese words or Chinese scripts
 aajkal ke samachaarpatron main prayukt shabdon main se koi 10 pratishat aise shabd hai
 a major difficulty in reading words written in Chinese scripts is that there are three different pronunciations for each script
 kaaran yah he ki china main "kaan" rajkul, "go" rajkul or "to" rajkul ke shasankalon main chini lipiyon ke uccharan bhinn the or in teenon kaalon main chini bhashaa kaa prabhaav japani bhashaa par padataa rahaa
 Thus there are three distinctions to read according to Chinese pronunciation
 iske atirikt jab ye lipiyaan japan ke apane mul shabdon ke liye prayukt kii jaati hai ye chini lipiyaan apane apane arth ke anusaar japani uccharan main padhi jaati hai
 Thus sometimes a Chinese script is read in seven eight ways
 meji kaal main jab japan main videshiyon kaa prabhaav padane laga, club, backet, blanket, romentic, tobaco jaise shabd yaa to unke uccharan ko lekar yaa unke artho ko lekar chini lipi main likhe jane lage
 But nowadays such words are mostly written in Katakana
 aadhunik japani bhashaa main kul shabdon ke paanch prati shat aise videshi shabd hai
 In these foreign words, the names of industrial-trade instruments, clothing, living-related words and sports are more
 inamen angreji or aajkal amareeki shabd sabase adhik hai
 More words have been taken from Germany in relation to medicine, philosophy, climbing of mountains, French in relation to art, Italid in relation to music
 chini bhashaa ko milakar videshi shabdon main rupaparivartan nahin hote
 When the verb is to be formed, such words are followed by the beginning, such as sine suru

 kisi reeti se ushma ke maapan ko ushmamiti yaa 'calorimiti' kehete hai
 Specific heat, heat capacity, latent heat, etc
 of substances or processes can be determined by measuring the amount of heat that is absorbed in a chemical reaction or phase change or in any physical or chemical change or any biological process that produces heat
 Can
 ooshmaamiti kaa armbh jul ke us prayog se armbh hua jo 'calories ke yantric tulyank' ke nirdhaaran ke liye kiya gaya tha
 In fact, this experiment was based on the principle of conservation of energy
 calorimiti ke liye jo upkaran upyog main laaye jate hai unhen 'calorimapi' kehete hai! Calorimetry Principle: When two different objects are interconnected, the heat flows from the object of high temperature to the object of low temperature! ushmamiti ushma ke kisi prabhaav par aadhaarit hoti he
 Thermodynamics can be done directly or indirectly

 The following methods of direct calorimetry are generally: taapaparivartan athwa taapamaneey ushmamiti, Substitution or latent heat calorimetry
 pratham paddati main ve reetiyaan hai jinamein taap parivartit hota he tathaa maapan taapaparivartan par nirbhar hota he
 Ultimately, this method only results in observation of heat
 at: in vidhiyon main taapmaana ke avlokan main parinat ho jaati he
 Thus temperature is a key tool in these methods
 is paddati main reno kii mishran vidhi tathaa dullang or peti kii sheetalibhawan vidhi hai
 The second method involves methods that rely on the liquefaction of solids or condensation of vapors
 inamen him tathaa vaashp ushma maan sammilit hai
 In these experiments the temperature is constant due to its dependence on liquefaction and evaporation, so there is no need for temperature in them
 ushma kaa ekak ushma kii vah maatra he jo ek ekak maatra jal ke taap main 1° celsius kii vruddhi karti he
 If the unit of mass is 1 gram and then the temperature is 1 ° C
 If the unit of heat is called a calorie
 kintu 1 gram dravyaman ke jal ke taap main 1° se
 vruddhi karne ke liye prayek taap par ushma kii aavashyak maatra samaan nahin hoti 
 Therefore, scientists used 1 ° C
 The aforesaid temperature of 14

 Till is considered
 at: ek calories ushma kii vah maatra he jo 14

 kar de
 The difference in the amount of heat required to increase one degree of heat at different temperatures is very small; Therefore, in normal experiments, 1 ° c in the temperature of 1 gram of pure water at any temperature
 One can consider the amount of heat required for growth of 1 kalari
 ushmadharita-kisi vastu kii ushmadharita ushma kii vah maatr he jo 1 sein
 tapavriddhi ke liye us vastu ko deni padati he, athwa 1 sein
 taappatan dwaara usase praapt hoti he
 The heat of a substance is called the specific heat of that substance compared to the heat of water
 arthath, padaarth ke kisi dravyaman kii kisi tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra tathaa samaan dravyaman ke jal kii usee tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii nishpatti ko us padaarth kii vishisht ushma kehete hai
 1 gram of water 1 ° c The heat required for heating is 1 unit of heat, so the heat of a gram of matter is the specific heat of that substance
 yadi dravyaman m kii kisi vastu kaa taap se tak badhaane ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra maa ho to purvokt paribhaasha ke anusaar vishisht ushma vi nimnlikhit sutara main praapt hogi: The mass of an object and the product of specific heat is called the heat capacity of that object
 ise us vastu kaa 'jal tulyank' bhi kehete hai
 Generally, when defining specific heat, it is necessary to specify the conditions in which the temperature changes have occurred
 udhaahrantaya, yadi sampeden se kisi gas ke taap main vruddhi ho to dt kaa maan shunya nahin hoga parantu dq =0
 Therefore the specific heat will be zero
 duusari taraf yadi ek gas main parimit maatra main ushma di jaae or uskaa prasaran is prakaar ho ki uskaa taap sthir rahe to is paristhiti main dt=0 hoga or dq shunya nahin hogi
 Therefore specific heat will be very high
 gas kaa prasaran is prakaar bhi karaayaa ja saktaa he ki kuch maatra main ushma to use di jaae parantu phir bhi uske taap kaa patan ho; is sthiti main dt ke rinatmak hone ke kaaran uski vishisht ushma kaa maan bhi rin hoga
 From this it appears that the specific heat value of the gas can be anything between + Eternal to - Eternal and this value is related to the circumstances
 is kaaran gas kii vishisht ushma ke vishay main taapaparivartan kii paristhitiyon kaa nirdesan atyant aavashyak he
 Therefore, there are two specific heat in the subject of gas: drav tathaa thos padaarthon main sampeden nune hone ke kaaran saadhaaran prayogon main aaytan parivartan nune tathaa naganya hote hai
 Hence only one specific heat remains
 prayek taap par thos tathaa drav kii ek nishchit vishisht ushma hoti he tathaa taap ke saath isaki vruddhi hoti he
 In this, the water is heated to a fixed temperature and the amount of heat is determined by the amount of water
 is paddati main nimnlikhit reetiyaan hai : Mixing method, sheetalibhawan vidhi, By this method Rayna discovered the ultimate pure fruit
 yadi do padaarth k tathaa kha ke dravyaman m1 tathaa m2 taap T1) tathaa T2 tathaa vishisht ushmayen S1 tathaa S2 hon or yadi ve ek-duusare ke saath rakhe jaaen to ushma ek se duusare main jaaegi tathaa falswaroop unka taap antatah T1 tathaa T2 ke bich ek saamaanya taap t hoga
 Consequently, if the regulation of heat is in a and B, then the heat given by a will be equal to the heat taken by B
 yahan hamane yah mana he ki taap ke sameekaran kii avadhi main k tathaa kha na to anya vastuon se ushma lete hai, na unhen dete hai
 In practice this stage is impossible
 saamanyatya anya vastuon se bhi ushma kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 There are special ways to correct or minimize such errors

 In addition to water, the mercury of the thermometer, diffuser and thermometer take the heat of the hot substance and their temperature also increases when a hot substance is put into the thermometer's water
 at: inaki ushmadharitaaon kaa lekha lenaa bhi aavashyak he
 The increase in temperature also leads to an increase in radiation purification; For this reason, it is appropriate that the amount of water in the thermometer be taken so high that the temperature does not increase much; But doing so reduces the precision of the experiment
 iske pratikaar ke liye sookshm tapamapi kaa vyavhaar aavashyak ho jaataa he
 This method is based on the assumption that when an object cools in an inclusivity, the heat dq emitted by it during that period of time depends on the inclusions of the object, the excess of heat, the nature of its plane, and the area of the plane
 Does
 at: In this equation the object is dependent on its plane, ie its area and radiation power, and f is the unknown function of the excess of heat which will be the same for each object
 at: yadi newton kaa sheetalibhawan niyam yarthaat he to yah falan keval taapantar dt he
 If the object is cooler than the temperature dt during dt period m vastu kii sanhati tathaa s vishisht ushma he
 Therefore yadi donon vastuon ke tal ke kshetrafal samaan hon to a = A' to nimnlikhit sambandh nikaala ja saktaa he- That is, the heat capacities of both the objects are the result of those periods which take them to cool by the same range of heat
