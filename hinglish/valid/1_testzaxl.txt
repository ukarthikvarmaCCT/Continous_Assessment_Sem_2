 In the early period of printing, there was a trend of instrumental division, but nowadays there is a great development in dyeing and coloring respectively, which has to form the basis of the division by which the color in the fabric is printed, or the color is established in printing
 rasinic athwa yantric kriyaaon ke aadhaar par in ritiyon ko alag-alag virgon main rakhaa ja saktaa he, jo prayek kii bhinn-bhinn hoti hai
 These are called printing practices
 bhaap chapai, ranjak chapai or kataav chapai aadi inke udhaaharan hai
 Traditional printing techniques of clothing can be divided into four main categories - yah aajkal kii sarvaadhik chapai kii pratha he
 It only uses dyes that have a direct affinity to the printed fabric, or which, by combination with chemicals, can produce such fraternities, such as acidic and chrome dyestuffs and alkaline alsian and soluble fur dyes on woolen and silk fabrics; Leuco esters of direct, coaxial, sulfuric, vat, soluble vat dyes or vat dyes, including azoic, beta-naphthal, naphthal AS, rapidfast, rapidogen, and paradizol, and aniline black, eigenrin chrome dyestuff and all those botanicals Colors that are mounted on the cloth by the colorist are appropriate for cotton clothes or rayons of similar quality
 rangasthapak vah rasinic padaarth he jo reshe or rang donon ke prati bandhuta rakhata he
 When it is installed on the cloth itself, then it also gives color
 is varg ke rangon main praaia: kapade ke prati sidhi bandhuta nahin hoti
 Dye and dyestrophic dyes, although not directly applied to cotton fibers, have been incorporated into this practice, as these dyes are printed with some chemicals whose dyes are previously inert, but activated by steaming and containing dyes
 Both of them climb on the fiber together
 is pratha main prayukt ranjakon kaa yoga bhi vibhinn varg ke ranjakon ke anusaar pruthak pruthak hota he
 For example, degradable substances with soda phosphate furrow dyes with direct dyes, such as sodium sulfoxylate formaldehyde, or ICI
 Formosal and alkali, such as potassium carbonate, are required to be used to give the complexion an active form
 isi prakar maadi ke atirikt anya ranjakon ke saath bhi uchit rasayanakon kaa hona nitant aavashyak he
 The importance of steam is prominent in this practice
 aazoik ranjakon ko chhodkar shesh anya ranjakon ke saath bhaap dena anivaary he
 The rapidezal of the azoic is also developed by steam
 repidogen ranjakon ko amleey bhaap se upachaarit karte hai
 Rapid fast dyes can be stirred by hanging the cloth in the air for two to three days after printing, or by steam, or by stirring in a boiling dilute organic acid solution
 ranjak or uske aanushanbik rasayak maadi main milakar kapade par haath thappe, screen, stencil yaa roller pinrtig yantra se chhap die jate hai
 After drying the cloth is steamed for one hour in a domestic steam and three to seven minutes in a speed pulverizer
 is prakaar kapade par rang chadhaakar phir usase lipta hua ranjak sabuniya kar nikaal diya jaataa he
 But sometimes it is necessary to perform oxidation or stabilization in basic dyes before kund dyes, otherwise the color will fade and will not remain firm
 ranjak varg ke anusaar hi rang pakkaa athwa kaccha hota he
 The cost of printing is also less or more according to the firm and raw color
 yah apane desh kii pracheenatam chapai pratha he, jo kuch samay purv sansar ke anek deshon main vyapak rup se prachlit thi
 Even today, the printing of "ramnami" cloth is done in Mathura and its adjoining districts by this method
 chapai ke pehle kapade par rangasthapak lagaana padataa he
 The dyestuff is washed after applying it with the appropriate chemicals, and installed on the cloth
 tadnantar geeli dasha main hi rangipatr main uchit yogon ke saath vaanchit rang diya jaataa he
 The dyestuff is applied according to the design, so the color climbs on the dyestuff design
 is prakaar chaar rang ke abhikalp ke liye chaar rangasthapak lagane padenge
 Their coating is colorless, so indigo is used as a demonstrator
 rangasthapak anek hote hai or lagbhag un sabase ek hi ranjak ke alag alag rang praapt hote hai
 Changing the color can also be done by mixing any two, because the color is according to the colorist and on mixing one character gets affected by the other
 vanaspatik ranjakon main "manjeeth" or "aal" kaa upyog is chapai main vishesh hota tha
 Nowadays, the analytical Eleazerine is used in place of Manjith
 in ranjakon ke sampark main fitkaree laal, sodium bichromet or stans chloride naarangi tathaa haraksis bangnee or kaala varna detaa he
 Combining alum and Harakis can be achieved from unnatural hue to enhancement of Kasis to chocolate color
 aajkal elizrin kaa hi vyapak upyog hota he
 The practice of Manjith has arisen at all
 rangasthapak chapai ke pashchaat rangai karke, sabun se bhalee prakaar dhokar tab kapade ko sukhaya jaataa he
 These colors are good for lighting and washing etc
 inamen chamak bhi acchhee hoti he, parantu prayukt rasayanakon main apdravya na hona chahie
 The use of hard water in this practice is beneficial for some special actions, but is harmful in ordinary other practices
 jo rang rangasthapak kii sahaayta se chadaaye jate hai, ve sabhi is pratha se chaape ja sakate hai
 In this way, coaxial dyes are also suitable for this, but generally they are not much in the free tones due to being light for light and washing
 krom rangasthapak ranjak bhi uparyukt siddhant ke anusaar uchit hai, parantu inamen sabhi abha ke rang uplabdh hone se inako praaia: sidhi chapai dwaara hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Chrome acetate is used for color stabilization along with other formulations in the printing of woolen or silk fabrics
 amleey madhyam hona aavashyak he
 In this printing, first the fabric has to be painted in some color
 rangai vaise hi kii jaati he jaise vastu rangai kala main prachlit he, arthath rang ghulaakar, ranjak jati ke anusaar uchit yogon ko lekar, rangapaatr main chalaanaa, pakaana aadi
 After the full color treatment, the fabric is applied according to the design of the erosion factor
 sukhai karke bhaap di jaati he, gharelu bhapayantra main ek ghanta or gativan pakvitra main teen se 10 minute tak samay diya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, the action of erosion takes place
 uske baad maal ko baahar nikaalkar hawa main sukhaya jaataa he or oxikaran aadi kriyaayein kii jaati hai
 Finally, the cloth is thoroughly cleaned by washing it with soap
 kapadaa rangeen hota he
 If only the addition of erosion is applied, there will be white designs on the colored background of the cloth, which will be visible in the form of round drops or ornaments
 ise shwet kataav kaha jayega
 It should be kept in mind that the expansion of ornamentation only in white markings can be very limited
 isliye rangeen prishthbhumi par kataav ke madhyam se ek shwet or kai ek rangeen kataav kiye jate hai
 For dyed erosion, such dyes are mixed in the appropriate proportion in the erosion which will evaporate the color of the fabric
 in mishrit rangon kii anya kriyaayein, jaise rangaubhad, avkaran evam oxikaran aadi waisi hi hoti hai jaisi unki nijee sidhi chapai main
 Many dyes of the same class, or dyes of several classes, can be taken as per these mixed dyes
 kintu ye keval aise hi hone chahie jo kataav kaarak se nasht na hon, reshe se uchit bandhuta rakhte hon tathaa kataav kaarak main unka varna bhi parivartit na ho
 The same chemical can be fatal for one pigment and beneficial for another
 kataav kaarak teen prakaar ke hote hai
 One is oxidizer, such as bichromate, nitrate, chlorate, bromate etc
 inke prabhaav ko badhaane yaa utprerit karne ke liye oxygen vaahakon evam utprerakon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Other erosive substances are refractory, such as stainous chloride, hydrosulfite, and sulfoxylate-formaldehyde ethanol
 Manufactured Business Formosal or I
G
 Manufactured rangolite c etc
 inke prabhaav ko badhaane ke liye anthraquinon lep or lukotrop dablyoo ko kataav kaarak main milaanaa padataa he
 The third type of erosive substances are acids, which are often used in the harvesting of mineral dyes
 ye rasinic padaarth alag alag rangajati ke kataav ke liye lagbhag nishchit se ho gaye hai, yadhyapi inkaa upyog duusare samakaksh ranjakon main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 These substances should be chosen in such a way that they do not oppose the basic dyes of mixed colors, such as potassium carbonate, burning soda, hydrosulfite, and formosal, etc
, in the background erosion of azoic pigments
 inhen padaarthon ko kunda ranjakon ke mul lep main, unki pratyaksh chapai main athwa unki rangai main upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Now the floor of azoic pigments can be harvested smooth by mixing the furrow dyes with these erosive substances
 inamen se koi bhi padaarth kunda ranjak ke vastra par chadhane main hanikaarak na hokar poorak hoga
 If the simple dyes are taken for color erosion in addition to the kundaranj, it would be unfair, because the simple dyes themselves will become colorless by cutting into these substances
 saral ranjakon main keval pilaa rang hi aisa hota he jo in yogon se nahin katataa
 It can be taken at the bottom of the azoic in yellow erosion
 nil tathaa anya kundaranjakon kii tal kataai ke liye oxykaarak padaarth upyukt hote hai
 But dyes that have found catalysts like anthraquinone coating, etc
, can also be cut with refractory materials
 saral ranjakon ke tal ko bhi aazoik rajakon kii bhanti hi kaata ja saktaa he, parantu yogon kii maatra or bhaap kaa samay kam hona chahie
 In erosion, the fabric is colored and then its color is cut, but in the practice of resistance, the resistor is already applied to the fabric, then dyed after drying
 pratirodhi lage sthalon par rang nahin chadhataa shesh sab kapadaa bhalee prakaar rang jaataa he
 Color should be painted in the resistor, then color is done, then color resistance will be obtained
 ye pratirodhan do prakaar ke hote hai- ek to yantric, jo aparivartit bhautik rup se bina kisi parivartan ke kaam karte hai, jaise mom, regin, chini mitti, zinc oxide, charbi, sis, beri sulphate aadi
 The printing of aerated and bonded falls in this category, but these substances are also mixed with chemical resistors, so that the active pigment elements cannot reach the fabric
 duusare rasinic dravya, jo kriyalap ke bich aisi dasha utpann kar dete hai ki rangaai ke samay yoga lage sthalon par kapadaa rang nahin pakadta, tathaa bilkul shwet rahata he
 There are four types of chemically resistant: inhibitors, such as sodium or potassium sulfite, sodium or potassium bisulfite, stannous chloride, hydrosulfite and formosal etc
, oxidizers, such as tutia, ammonium chlorate, soda bicromate, sodium chlorate, ammonium vanadate, etc
, alkali Dahk soda, ash and potassium carbonate etc
, acids such as citric, tannic, tartaric and coxalic acids etc
 inke atirikt kuch aise dhaatulavan bhi hote hai jo bhaap main vighatit hokar amla dete hai
 These can also be taken
 pratirodhiyon ko lagaakar sukhaana chahie
 If the resistor is white, the fabric is dried and colored by padding in such a way that the fabric only goes between the two cylinders, not the chamber, and a cloth is wrapped on the bottom roller
 anillin vaale maal ko bhaap seven karakar, saadhaaran oxikaran ke baad pani, sabun aadi se svachh kiya jaataa he
 When the vat color has been added to the resistor, it should be made permanent by steam after printing
 tatpashchaat yadi tal anillin ke kaale rang kaa ho, to uske anusaar rangaai paatr main yogon ke saath pading aadi karke anya kriyaayein kerani padati hai
 Similarly white or colored resistance of other colors is printed
 pratirodhi kaa upyog ranjak varg or uske gundharmanusaar kiya jaataa he
 Mechanical resistors are used independently in binding and printing of matter

 ant main belan chapai ke saamne yah kala tik na saki, visheshkar pashchim main or ab keval java iskaa centre rah gaya he
 Java has acquired the same proficiency in printing technology as other countries have in other printing practices
 yadhyapi siddhant kii drushti se kataav pratha kaa kuch anukaran kar kriya ko vistrut karne or alankaarita main visheshta laane kaa praytn kiya gaya he, phir bhi ab tak baatik chapai kaa kaary pratirodhan pratha kii seemaa ke bheetar hi hota he
 Wax, resin and rice, maida or starch madi are used to prevent the color from reaching the fabric
 ye padaarth thande hokar jamate or pratirodho kaa kaary karte hai
 They are applied on a variety of fabrics
 haath se lagane main alankaarita nune shrenee kii hoti he, at: vibhinn prakaar ke upkarnon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Particularly notable among these is a small copper lota which has many thin crooked tots
 isse kapade par mom dwaara bahut baariki se chitrankan kiya ja saktaa he
 Some also work with a brush
 kabhi kabhi kapade par mom lagaakar sui kii nok se chhidr banaate hue chitrit kiya jaataa he
 Pictures are also made with the help of various types of stencils
 aajkal lakdi ke thappon main taanbe kii pattiyaan lagaakar utpaadan badhaane kaa prayaas safal hua he
 These devices can be called the initial means of dyeing
 parantu rangaai chunki kai baar main puri kii jaati he, at: inkaa upyog baar baar hoti he
 Sometimes after picking color once, wax is also filled with the brush at that place, so that the color cannot reach there
 tab rangaai kii kriya bhi duharai jaati he
 In the ancient times, only botanical colors were available for rangai
 mom ghule nahin, is vichaar se is chapai pratha main rangaai thande main kii jaati thi
 Many species of Neel and Manjith etc
 were used in this way
 mom aadi se alankaarita ke pashchatra rangai kii reeti vahi hoti he jo saadhaaran kapadaa rangaai main vyavahrut hoti he
 By applying the oil, coloring, fixing, etc
 in the red rang, the ornamental was done with wax, and it was often healed

 Nevertheless these colors were limited in aura
 aajkal sanshleshik nil or elizrin kaa upyog adhik kiya jaataa he
 In addition to these, other suitable analytical dyes such as Azoic etc
 are also being used in this printing rangai
 adhikansh vanaspatik rang prakaash or dhulaai main kachche hote he
 For this reason also new colors have been adopted more
 inaki rangai kriyaayein bhi adhik suvidhajanak hoti he
 The method of potassium permanganate is more followed in matter erosion, that is, after washing the cloth in indigo and drying it, wax is applied as per design
 tatpashchaat oxykaarak kataav karke hydrosulphite ow soda ke tanu vilyan main chalaaya jaataa or dhulaai or dhulaai aadi kii jaati he
 The cloth where the wax remains, the cloth remains blue, the rest white
 prarambh main yah chapai pratha bade gharon main samay kaatane kaa saadhan thi, baad main, visheshkar java main, gharelu dhandhon ke rup main iskaa prachlan badi maatra main hone laga or aaj bhi vahaan jansankhya ke ek bade bhaag ke jivicoparjan kaa yah mukhya saadhan he
 Gold-silver wire is used in weaving of brocade
 aise vastron kaa mulya saadhaaran manushya kii krayshakti ke pare hota he, at: chapai dwaara is kami kii purti karne kaa prayaas chhipon ne kiya he
 Metal powder is used in this
 ye churna sona, chaandi, banaavati sona or aluminium aadi chamakdaar dhaatuon ke hote hai
 Some of the additives are used to paste them onto the fabric, such as lithaphon, natural photosynthetic resin, lacquer, boiled oil of real, varnish etc
 kapade kii yathochit rangaai karke, sukhaane ke baad yaa pital ke thappon se arsajakon kaa apekshit abhikalp lagaaya jaataa he uske upar patale kapade kii potli main baandhakar dhatuchurna ko dhire-dhire chhitakaaya jaataa he
 In this way, by applying metal powder on the adhesive, hanging the cloth in sunlight and shade for two to three days, the adhesive dries up and the powder becomes permanent and firm
 aajkal uparyukt asanjakon ke badale aise padaarth liye jate hai jinase kapade par sanshleshik rezin ban jaati he, jaise phenol or farmaldihide sodium isitate ke saath
 To make their effects more permanent, a little sericose is also added to them
 bhaap dene par is prakaar jo aviley regin banataa he usamen sabun kii dhulaai ke liye dhatuchurna bahut pakke sthapit ho jate hai

 Its printing is very beautiful and attractive on transparent textiles, such as oregandi or nylon, by stripping the powder through bundles or other means
 mashin ke dwaara kapade ke saath 90 degree kaa kone banaate hue reshen evam bade tukdon ko khadaa lagane kaa chalan bhi ho gaya he
 Such fabric is called pile fabric
 yah dekhne main vaisaa hi hota he jaise galeeche kaa kapadaa
 The machine by which they are applied on the cloth has a magnetic attraction, the fibrous group coming in contact with it will stand in the fabric and, due to the presence of the adhesive material there, the stand in it becomes fixed
 is kala main prayukt aasanjak aadhunik hote hai or ye sabun kii dhulaai ke liye to pakke hote hi hai, praaia: unamem se adhikansh shushk dhulaai ke liye bhi pakke hote hai, reshe, reshon ke tukade yaa churna, shwet athwa rangeen kaam main laae jate hai

 The transfer of heat from a hot body to a cold body is called heat transfer
 jab kisi vastu kaa taapmaana uske parivesh yaa anya vastu kii apeksha bhinn hota he to taap urja kaa sanchaar jise taap kaa bahaav yaa taap kaa vinimay bhi kehete hai, is tarah se hota he ki vah vastu or uskaa parivesh ooshm-samyata grahan kar lete hai; iskaa matlab he ki donon kaa taapmaana samaan ho jaataa he
 According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics or Clausius' statement, heat always transports from a warmer object to a colder one
 jahaan kahin bhi paas-paas sthit vastuon main taapmaana kii bhinnata hoti he, unke bich ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko kabhi roka nahin ja saktaa; ise keval kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Conduction of heat through direct contact with particles in matter is called conduction
 urja kaa sanchaar praathmik rup se sunamya samaghaat dwaara jaise dravon main yaa paraasaran dwaara jaisaa ki dhaatuon main hota he yaa phonon kampan dwaara jaisaa ki insulatoron main hota he, ho saktaa he
 In other words, when the surrounding atoms vibrate towards each other, or electrons move from one atom to another, heat is transmitted by conduction
 sanchaalan thos padaarthon main adhik hota he, jahaan parmaanuon ke bich apekshaakrit sthir sthanik sambandhon kaa jaal kampan dwaara unke bich urja ke sanchaar main madad karata he
 In a situation where the flow of fluid is not happening at all, the heat conductance corresponds directly to the osmosis of particles in the fluid

 As the density decreases, the operation also decreases
 isaliye, drav kam sanchaalak hote hai
 This is due to greater distance between atoms in the gas: less collision between atoms means less conduction
 The conductivity of gases increases with temperature
 The conductivity of gases increases with the increase in pressure from the vacuum to a critical point until the density of the gas is so high that the molecules of the gas collide with each other before transmitting heat from one surface to another
 After this point in density, conductance increases slightly with increasing pressure and density
 is baat kii gananaa karne ke liye ki koi vishesh madhyam kitni aasaani se sanchaalan karata he, ejeeniyar ooshm sanchaalakata kaa prayog karte hai, jise sanchaalakata constent yaa sanchaalan gunak, k bhi kehete hai
 The definition of k in thermal conductivity is - 'the amount of heat transmitted from a surface to a thickness in the general direction from the surface of a place in time due to the variation in temperature, Q'
 Thermal conductivity is a material property that is primarily dependent on the state of the medium, temperature, density, and molecular binding

 Whenever the internal heat operation of an object is much faster than the heat operation of its boundary, volatile operation can be estimated by mass system analysis
 yah upgaman vidhi asthir sanchaalan pranali ke ek pahalu ko uchit rup se gata detii he In this method, a term called the Beot number is calculated which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of the heat conduction at the boundary of the same protrusion to the temperature of an object and the internal conductor heat barrier of the object

 There are two types of conductive heat transmission: sanvaahan ko aantarik or bahya pravaah ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Internal flow occurs when the liquid is locked in a solid, such as the flow in a pipe
 External flow occurs when a liquid expands indefinitely without coming into contact with a solid surface
 ye dono sanvaahan, chaahe ve prakritik hon yaa balaat, aantarik yaa bahya ho sakate hai kyonki ve ek duusare se swatantra hote hai
 The rate of conductive heat exchange is given as: a taap sanchaar kisatah kaa kshetrafal he
 t s is the surface temperature and t b is the temperature of the liquid at the bulk temperature
 lekin t b sthiti ke anusaar badalata rahata he or sataha se ‘bahut dur’ sthit taral kaa taapmaana he
 h is a constant heat transmission multiplier that depends on the physical properties of the liquid such as temperature and the physical state in which the convection occurs

 Light colors and white objects and metallic materials reduce the absorption of light, and are therefore less hot, but otherwise at everyday temperatures, color has no specific effect on the heat communication between an object and its surroundings, as potent
 The emitted wavelengths are not near the visible spectrum, but rather far away in infrared
 in tarangadairdhyon par maujuud utsargataaon kaa dikhne vaali utsarjanataon se koi sambandh nahin hota; sudur infrared main adhiktar vastuon main ucch utsarjanataayen hoti hai
 Therefore, the color of clothing has no effect on heat, except in sunlight; Similarly, there is no difference in the color of the paint applied to the houses, except for the part on which sunlight falls

 a related theory, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is the rate of heat loss of an object in proportion to the difference between the temperature of that object and its ambient temperature
 This rule is given as a specific equation: taap hraas sutara kaa yah prakaar kabhi-kabhi adhik sahi nahin hota; bilkul sahi sutara ke liye asamroop yaa kam sanchaalak madhyam main taap sanchaar sameekaran par aadhaarit taap pravaah ke vishleshan kii jarurat hoti he

 By this ratio, it is found that the object has a relatively high internal conductivity, allowing the entire object to remain at the same temperature, although this temperature varies when the atmosphere is cooled from outside
 aisa hone par, ye paristhitiyaan vastu ke taapmaana main samay ke saath ghaatankeey hraas utpann karti hai
 In this case, the whole body is assumed to be a mass capacitance heat collector whose total heat volume is directly proportional to the simple total heat capacity c and the body temperature T, or q = CT
 The definition of heat capacity c gives the relation c = dq / dt

 is vyanjana ko upar is khand ke prarambh main diye gaye pehle sameekaran main dq / dt ke sthaan par prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Then, if t is the temperature of such a body at time t and the temperature of the atmosphere of the body is tenv: to: r = ha / c is a positive constant characteristic of a system that must be in the unit of 1 / time, and is therefore sometimes expressed as a specific time constant t0: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 In heating systems like this, t0 = c / ha

 The robbery of the Chambal Valley was shot in the ravaged ravines of the Bhind and Morena districts of the problematic areas under the security cover of the Madhya Pradesh Police, and the film at Mohan Studios, Mumbai, showcased Waheeda Rehman and Sunil Dutt's best acting talent

 Shooting in the Chambal Valley and shooting for the film was not a laughing joke but the audacity of those days, but Sunil Dutt, who was determined to his tune, did it well

 Mani Bhattacharya, the director of this film, had prior experience working as an assistant director in films like Do Bigha Zameen and Madhumati, so he paid special attention to seeing, understanding and filming the social problem of the robber from a human point of view

 On the basis of these balances a list is prepared which is called the remaining test or table or exam list
 is talapat main debit sheshon kaa jod credit sheshon ke jod ke baraabar hona chaiye
 If the sum of the two sides of the plane is not equal, it means that there is a mathematical inaccuracy in the articles that is discovered and removed

 The plan will be prepared before preparing the financial statement sheet
 talapat aisi suchi he jisamen khatabahi ke vibhinn lekha shirshon ke credit evam debit sheshon ko bataaya jaataa he
 Equality in the sum of debit and credit balances written in the table is to ensure mathematical correctness of behavior

 The board will be prepared in the format as follows: - talapat dinaank xxrep 25

 tak The following things have to be kept in mind while preparing the floor from the general ledger: - chunki har debit pravishti ke samatuly credit pravishti kii jaati he tadanusaar debit shesh ke vibhinn lekha shirshon kaa shesh, credit shesh ke samast lekhon ke shesh ke samatuly hoga
 While the floor is generally the first test of accuracy
 kabhi-kabhi donon pakshon arthath debit evam credit kaa jod baraabar hota he phir bhi trutiyaan hoti he
 The following errors are not known from the floor: yadi talapat kaa yoga baraabar na ho to galatiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu nimnanusaar kadam uthaae jate hai
 This is the list of longest rivers on earth
 isamen 1,000 kilometre se adhik vaale nadi tantra shaamil hai
 Calculating the length of a river can be very difficult
 isamen kai kaarak hote hai, jaise strot, muhane kii pahchaan yaa paribhaasha or strot or muhane ke bich nadi kii lambaai ke maap kaa paimaana, jo "nadi kii lambaai" ke sateek arth ko tay karte hai
 Consequently, the measurement of the length of many rivers is only approximation
 vishesh rup se, is baat ko lekar lambey samay tak asahmati bani rahi ki duniya kii sabase lambii nadi amejan he yaa nil
 nil ko paaramparik rup se lanbaa mana jaataa rahaa he, lekin haal ke kuch varshon main brazil or peru dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan kaa suzav he ki jab amejan nadi kii lambaai or uske bagal kaa para muhaana or sarvaadhik lambi jwariya nahar kaa maapan kiya gaya to use lambi paaya gaya
 To determine the maximum length of a river, the "actual source" of the river is considered to be the source of its tributary which is located farthest from the mouth
 is sahaayak nadi kaa naam mukhya nadi vaala hi ho saktaa he
 For example, the Mississippi River source is generally considered Lake Itasca, but the most remote source of the Mississippi system is the Jefferson River, a tributary of the Missouri River, then a tributary of the Mississippi River
 jab mississippi kii lambaai ko is muhane se lekar sarvaadhik dur ke is strot tak mapa jaataa he to ise mississippi-mizori-jeffrasan kaha jaataa he
 In addition, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly where the river originated, especially rivers that have been formed by ephemeral streams, marshes, or variable lakes
 is lekh main, lambaai kaa arth he, naam kii parvaah kiye bina ek die gaye nadi tantra main sabase lambey satat nadi channel kii lambaai
 It is difficult to determine the mouth of a river when the mouth of the river is large which gradually widens and opens into the ocean; For example the River Plate and the St
 Lawrence River
 Some rivers such as Okavango, Humboldt, and Cairn have no estuaries; Instead these rivers run with small amounts of water and eventually evaporate, or drain into aquatic rock layers, or diverted for agriculture
 in nadiyon ke samaapt hone kaa sateek sthaan mausam ke anusaar bhinn hota he
 It can be difficult to determine the origin of rivers that are formed by deposition in the trench of a water source coming from different farms, which only get water after rain
 isi tarah, chaak kshetra main shuru hone vaali nadiyon main, jaise dakshin england main chiltern, upree pravaah kii lambaai jo sukhi hoti he vah jal-str ke aadhaar par bhinn hoti he or yah str mausam ke anusaar badalata rahata he: sheetakaaleen dekhen
 The length of a river between the origin and estuary can be difficult to determine due to map scale issues
 chote paimaane ke nakshe aam taur par bade paimaanon ke naqshe kii tulana main samanyikaran karte hai, yaa rekhaon ko "chikna" kar dete hai
 Normally, the accepted length measurements should be based on maps that are large enough to show the width of the river, and the route that will be measured will be the path that a boat will take in the middle of the river
 yahaan tak ki jab vistrut nakshe uplabdh hote hai, lambaai maapan hameshaa spasht nahin hota he
 a river may have many branches or anabranches
 lambaai is baat par nirbhar ho sakati he ki nadi kaa madhya hissaa mapa ja rahaa he yaa uske kinare maape ja rahe hai
 How to measure the length through a lake can be unclear
 mausami or vaarshik parivartan nadiyon or jhiilon ko badal sakate he
 Other factors that can alter the length of the river include erosion cycle and flooding, dams, shoreline and channelization
 In addition, the length of the winding can change over time due to natural or artificial reductions, when a new channel crosses a large bend of the river through a narrow area of land
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1766 se 1885 ke bich 18 kataav ke kaaran mississippi nadi kii lambaai kahiraa, illinois se lekar orlians, louiciana tak 218 mile ghat gai
 These things make the exact measurement of the length of a river difficult, if not impossible
 sateekta or parishuddhta main bhinnata bhi vibhinn nadiyon ke bich lambaai kii tulana ko anischitata ke khatre ke saath kathin bana detii hai
 The above mentioned discussion should be taken care of while using the data given in the following table
 adhikansh nadiyon ke liye, vibhinn strot ek nadi pranali kii lambaai par paraspar virdohi jaankaree pradaan karte hai

 The earliest mention of the effort to make steam engines is found in the writings of the Hero of Alexandria
 hero us vikhyath alaxandreey sampradaay schwör bei koranka sadsy tha jisamen tolemi, euclid, iretosthanij jaise tatkaaleen vigyaan ke maharathi sammilit the
 In his article, Hero describes a device in which air was heated in a closed box and circulated down a pipe passage to a water-filled vessel
 isamen bartan kaa pani duusari nalee main chadhataa tha or ek nakli phuhaaraa ban jaataa tha
 Then after this, no details are found in this regard
 1606 i
 main, hero se lagbhag 2,000 varsh baad, nepolian academy ke sansthaapak or tatkaaleen europe main vigyaan ke agrani netaa marxev dela porta ne hero ke phuharevaale prayog main hawa kii jagah bhaap kaa upyog kiya
 He also suggested that in order to fill a vessel with water, it should be connected to a pond with water by a tube and then after filling steam in that vessel and then cooling it with water from above, the inner steam condensed Vacuum will generate and instead the water from the pond will be filled in the vessel
 1698 i
 main marxev dela porta ke is suzav kaa upyog tamas severy ne pani chadhaane kii ek mashin main kiya
 Thus Savory was the first person to create a steam engine for commercial use, which was used to pump water from the mines and to drain water from the wells
 severy ke ingine ke avishkaar ke baad bhaap ingine kaa aglaa charan newcomen ingine kaa avishkaar tha
 It was invented by Thomas Newcomen
 is ingine kaa khadaanon or kuon se pani nikaalane main 50 varshon tak upyog hota rahaa
 It also has historical significance, because this opened the way for James Watt's inventions
 is ingine main pehali baar silinder or piston kaa upyog kiya gaya jo ab tak bhaap injanon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Steam in the newcomen engine is only used to generate vacuum
 piston uthaane kaa kaam, jisase pani chadhataa he, vayumandaleey daab karata he
 But it only takes a lot of fuel waste to condense the steam
 james wat kaa mahatvapurn kaary bhaap ingine ko sarvshereshth rup dena he jisase manushya kii shakti das guni bad gai or vyavsaayik kshetra main brihad parivartan ho gaya
 James Watt was a clever scientific engineer in Glasgow and in 1763 he was ordered by a physics professor at the University of Glasgow to repair a Newcomen engine that never ran well
 marammat karke samay wat ko dhyaan aayaa ki isamen eendhan buree tarah se vyarth ho jaataa he
 Watt of thoughtful nature started the idea of making the best machine from it
 is prakaar unhone anek anveshan kiye or yantra banaae, jinase bhaap ingine ko uskaa vartmaan swaroop praapt hua or vah udyog or sabhyataa kii pragati main shaktishaalee saadhan bana
 The following are the main types of steam engines: ekakriya ingine main bhaap piston ke ek hi ore kaary karti he evam dvikriya ingine main bhaap piston ke donon ore kaary karti he
 If both these types of engines have the same condition in all other states, the power received by the two-way engine is twice the power received by the other type of engine
 yahi kaaran he ki in dinon ekakriya ingine kam hi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 The engine is called vertical or horizontal according to whether the cylinder's axis is vertical or horizontal
 kshaitij ingine urdhwadhar ingine se adhik jagah gherta he
 The vertical type engine has less friction etc
, due to which it can run for more days than horizontal engine
 bhaap ingine kii chaal vastut: iske crank shift parikraman prati minute kii chaal hoti he
 The average piston speed in an engine with four foot piston stroke and 80 revolutions per minute would be 640 feet per minute
 yah ingine nimna chaal ingine kaha jayega
 Generally, an engine running at a speed of less than 100 revolutions per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine running at a speed of more than 250 revolutions per minute is called a high speed engine
 100 or 250 parikraman prati minute ke bich kii chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko "madhyam chaal ingine" kehete hai
 The greatest quality of a high speed engine is that it is of very small size for equal power
 ucch chaal ke kaaran bhaap bhi kam hi kharch hoti he, kyonki is prakaar ke ingine main bhaap or silinder ke bich ooshmaa sthanantaran main bahut hi kam samay lagata he
 The compaction engine is a steam engine from which steam is discharged directly into the atmosphere and for this the pressure of steam in the cylinder should never be less than the pressure of the atmosphere
 sanghanan ingine main bhaap kaary karne ke baad sanghnitr main pravesh karti he evam vah vahaan vayumandal kii daab par jal main parivartit ho jaati he
 The behavior of the condenser allows steam to function more
 saral ingine main prayek silinder boyler se sidhe bhaap paata he evam sidhe vayumandal yaa sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 In a combustion engine, steam is transmitted to a lesser extent in a cylinder called a high pressure cylinder, and then to a larger cylinder, called a low pressure cylinder, and the propagation is complete here
 bahudhaa nimna daab silinder sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 Propagation can also take place in three or four cylinders and these engines are called triprasar engines or tetraspara engines
 ooshmaa ingine kii adhiktam dakshata / T1 hoti he jisamen T1 or T2 ooshmaa ingine chakra main adhiktam evam nunatam taap hai
 This suggests that the efficiency of the engine depends on both these temperatures
 bhaanp ingine kii dakshata utani hi badhati jaaegi jitani kaa mulya badhegaa evam kaa mulya ghatega
 To increase the value of steam, the pressure of steam coming into the engine from the boiler has to be increased, because the higher the pressure of steam, the higher the value
 ko badhaane kaa ek or upaay he
 That is superheating the steam
 atitapak kaa boyler main vyavhaar karke bhaap kaa adhitaap badhaayaa jaataa he
 To reduce the value of K, it becomes necessary to behave the condenser
 sanghnitr main thande jal dwaara bhaap jal main parivartit kii jaati he
 Therefore, the value of a good condenser can be equal to the temperature of cold water
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhaap ingine main adhik daab evam atitpt bhaap dwaara kaary karaane se evam kaary karaane ke baad bhaap ko sanghnitr main prapya thande jal ke taap ke baraabar taap par jal main parivartit karne se ingine adhik daksh hoga
 Steam from the boiler enters the steambox at high pressure
 piston jaise hi stroke ke ant main pahunchataa he, usee samay valve chalata he, jisamen bhapadwar khul jaataa he evam bhaap silinder main pravesh karti he
 The piston moves when pushed by steam pressure
 ise agr stroke kehete hai
 The crank, crank shaft and centrifuge move by piston movement
 utkendrak ke chalane se dwaar kuch or adhik khul jaataa he
 Steam continues to enter the cylinder until the door is closed
 is samay viched hota he evam iske baad silinder main bhaap kaa sambharan nahi ho paata
 The steam in the cylinder is now transmitted and in this expansion the volume of steam increases and the pressure decreases
 isi prakaar ke samay bhaap kaary karti he
 At the end of the front stroke, the valve opens the steam side towards the exhaust, releasing the steam
 nikali hui bhaap kii daab pasch daab ke baraabar ho jaati he
 After a few moments of release, the piston returns backward and is called the alternating stroke
 is stroke main lautate samay piston silinder main bachi hui bhaap kaa nikaas karata jaataa he
 When the piston reaches the end of this stroke, the valve closes the exhaust gate, stopping the flow of steam
 silinder sheersh or piston ke bich kuch bhaap batch jaati he, jo nirmukt nahin ho paati he
 Then the cycle is repeated
 dvikriya ingine main isi se sadrush chakra kii kriya silinder kii duusari ore hoti he
 The Rankin cycle is a theoretical cycle according to which the steam engine operates
 gati niamak kaa mukhya kaary ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karnaa he
 The speed-regulator of a steam engine keeps the speed of cruises constant with the help of these two methods: shakti kii maang ke anusaar bhaap kii daab ko badhaakar yaa ghataakar ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karanevaale gatiniamak ko avrodh gatiniamak kehete hai
 The actuator drives a barrier valve, which is placed in the main steam tube
 is prakaar ke gatiniamakon main mukhya gatipalak kanduk gatiniamak hota he
 The valve is of a balanced type, that is, the resultant force by the steam is zero
 jab ingine kii gati badhati he, gatiniamak kandukon ke paribhraman kii gati main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he, jisase kentrapasari bal bad jaataa he
 This increase of force forces them to move out against the forces of gravity and control
 iske chalate valve kuch ansh main band ho jaataa he
 The pressure of the steam acting on the piston decreases when the valve is blocked, which also reduces the power generated
 evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main vruddhi ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop gati badhkar saamaanya gati par aa jaati he
 a simple line will be obtained if the weight of the steam transferred per hour in the engine is measured with horsepower after the use of a regular steam engine by the barrier speed-regulator
 yah sambandh sarvapratham vilian ne paaya tha
 Hence, it is called "the line of Villian" in his name
 gatipalkachakr ko isha ke saath chaabi ke dwaara atakaya jaataa he
 Large propellants are fitted in low-speed carrier ships and these propellants make 80 revolutions per minute
 is tarah ke jahaajon main bhaap ingine bahut hi upyukt hai
 In high-speed vessels, steam turbines are being used instead of steam engines
 samudryaan main vyavhaar main laae janevaale bhaap ingine main triprasar prakaar ke ingine prasiddh hai
 The ship engine is always equipped with surface condensers, which are fitted with brass tubes
 pump ke dwaara samudr kaa jal sanghnitr main laayaa jaataa he
 It is the condensation of condenser from sea water that condenses
 yadhyapi aajkal samudrayanon main antardahan ingine, bhaap tarabine evam gas tarabine vyavhaar main laayaa ja rahaa he, phir bhi kuch khaas avasthaaon main bhaap ingine kaa vyavhaar atyant aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Richard Trevithick first used steam locomotives to manufacture rail engines
 kintu aarthik kathinaayee ke kaaran unka prayaas safal na ho paaya
 Eventually George and Robert Stevenson were credited with making a successful rail engine, Fig
 7, and driving the train between Lowerpul and Manchester in 1829 AD
 jalayanon ke liye bhaap ingine kaa pratham upyog 1812 i
 main rabart pulton ne kiya tha
 Ordinary rail engines have the behavior of a horizontal steam engine
 yah ingine rail ingine boyler ke paas thos aadhaar par laga rahata he
 Almost all the locomotives do not have condenser
 kaary karne ke baad bhaap ko sidhe vayumandal main chhod diya jaataa he
 There are two types of such engines: aadhunik dizine main in donon prakaaron ko jod diya jaataa he, arthath kuch silinder ingine ke frem ke andar rahete hai evam kuch silinder baahar rahete hai
 Several changes have been made to James Watt's steam engine, although the main principle is still the same
 parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa bhaap ingine ke anekanek kaayon main prayukt hone ke kaaran hui
 Watt used low pressure in a steam engine because he feared an explosion
 lekin aajkal sarvatra ucch daab ingine hi prayukt kiye jate hai kyonki inaki dakshata bhi nimna daab ingine kii apeksha adhik hoti he
 The condenser of a modern engine consists of a number of taps into which soft water is flowed by a pump
 ek or pump bhaap ke sanghanan se bane pani or hawa ko nikaalane ke liye laga hota he

 tapavidyut vah vidyut he jo do asmaan dhaatuon ke taron kii sandhi ko garm karne par in taron ke paripath main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Seebeck first invented this fact in 1821 by heating the treaty of copper and bismuth wires
 uparyukt paripath main utpann vidyutvahak bal nune hota he or isaki tivrata nimnlikhit baton par nirbhar karti he- The cold ends of wires of dissimilar metals are attached to the potentiometer to measure the electromotive force
 yadi paripath main kisi duusari dhaatu kaa taar shreneebaddh kar diya jaae to tapavidyut prabhaavon main parivartan nahin hota
 If the magnitude of the Seebeck electromotive force and the temperature of a cold joint and the temperature of a joint is zero degrees C, then the relation between e and t is known in the following formula: jahaan a or b tapavidyut sthiraank hai or inkaa maan paripath ke taron kii dhaatu par nirbhar karata he
 The thermodynamic constants of metals are given in the following table: bismuth or taanbe kii sandhi ke liye e = 45 t + 0
25T^2 microvolt he
 At low temperature, k is approximately proportional, but if it is very high, the value of k increases
 lohe or taanbe kii sandhi kaa e = 158 t - 0
0285T2 microvolt he
 Maximum e = 2,000 microvolts when the temperature is t = 275 Celsius
 ucch taap par e kaa maan ghatane lagata he tathaa 5500 sein degree yah shunya ho jaataa he 5500 sein
 se adhik taap badhane par kii disha badal jaati he or vidyutdhara vipareet disha main pravaahit disha main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Thus the flow of electric current in the opposite direction when the heat is increased is called reversal of thermodynamic flow and 550 ° c reversal heat
