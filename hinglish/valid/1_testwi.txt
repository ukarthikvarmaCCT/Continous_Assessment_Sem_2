19ve sadi ke andhkaarmay bharat main jin mahanubhaavon ne jagrati kii jyoti jagaai unamem rishi dayanand kaa san desh bahut vyapak tha
 He was an era-rishi who gave a message of new ideas in all areas of education, politics, social organization etc
 rishi dayanand ne apane samay main prachlit shiksha-paddati main anek dosha anubhav karpracheen arya shiksha-pranali kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The sage gave him the name of 'gurukul education system'
 unke samay bharat main shiksha kii mukhyatya do pranaliyaan prachlit thim - ek bharat cabritish shaskaon dwaara prarambh kii gai thi or duusari puraani parampara ke anusaar pandit-mandali main prachlit thi
 The system practiced by the government was a counter to the national and religious ideals of India
 usamen bharat kii bhashaa, dharm, sabhyataa, sahitya tathaa samskruti kii sarvatha upeksha kii gai thi
 The education system of the Pandit congregation did not meet the requirements of the time, in which the knowledge-sciences of the present era did not have any place, it nurtured the hypocrisies
 charitra nirmaan ke liye brahmacharya, tyaag, tapasya aadi jin aadarshon kaa paalan aavashyak he, unka donon pranaaliyon main mahatv na tha
 Rishi Dayanand felt that these defects should be removed by reviving the ancient Gurukul system in India
 unhone shiksha ke aadarshon or siddhanton kaa pratipaadan ‘satyarth prakaash' ke tisare samullas main kiya -nihsandeh rishi dayanand ke vichaar shiksha ke kshetra main atyant krantikari vichaar the
 Mahatma Munshi Ram, a prominent disciple of Rishi Dayanand in 1897, gave the following reasons for the need to start Gurukula - 19veen shatabdi main bharat main do prakaar kii shikshapaddatiyaan prachlit thim
 The first method was the system of government schools and universities developed by the British government to meet the requirements of its governance and the second was the school system of studying various disciplines of Sanskrit, grammar, philosophy, etc
, in the ancient traditional method
 donon paddatiyon main kuch gambhir dosha the
 In the first system, there was a great expectation of post-scriptural knowledge and it was completely national
 iske prabal samarthak tathaa 1835 i
 main apane suprasiddh smaranpatr dwaara iskaa pravartan karaanevaale lard mekale ke matanusaar 'kisi achche europea pustkaalay kii aalmari ke ek khaane main padi pustakon kaa mahatv bharat or arab ke samooche sahitya ke baraabar' tha
 Hence, the emphasis was on the study of English and Western literature and science of knowledge in the government education system, neglecting Indian poetry
 is shiksha paddati kaa pradhan uddeshy mekale ke shabdon main 'bharatiyon kaa ek aisa samooh paidaa karnaa tha, jo rang tathaa rakt kii drushti se to bhartiya ho, parantu ruchi, mati or achaar-vichaar kii drushti se angrej ho'
 Therefore, this teaching was contrary to the national and religious ideals of India
 duusari shiksha pranali, panditmandli main prachlit paathshaala paddati thi
 Although Indian poetry was studied in it, there was a gross neglect of knowledge science necessary for the new and present time
 us samay desh kii badi aavashyaktaa paurasty evam paashchaatya gyaan vigyaan kaa samanvayay karte hue donon shiksha paddatiyon ke utkrishth tatwon ke saamanjasy dwaara ek rashtriya shiksha pranali kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 Gurukul Kangri contributed immensely in carrying out this important work
 gurukul ke sansthaapak mahatma munshiram pichhali shatabdi ke bhartiya saanskrithik punarjagran main asaadhaaran mahatv rakhanevaale aryasamaj ke pravartak maharishi dayanand ke suprasiddh granth 'satyarth prakaash' main pratipaadit shiksha sambandhi vichaaron se bade prabhavit hue
 He started a strong movement for the revival of the Gurukul education system in 1897 by his letter 'saddharm Pracharak'
 30 oktober 1898 ko unhone isaki vistrut yojana rakhi
 In November 1898, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, the central organization of the Arya Samaj of Punjab, accepted the proposal to open a gurukula and Mahatma Munshiram pledged that he would stay in his house until he collected Rs 30,000 for this task
 Will not keep feet

 Gurukul was established on 16 May 1900 at Gujranwala in Punjab with a Vedic school

 He gave a mantra of Shukla Yajurveda 'upahvare Girinanam Sangme Ch Nadiyan'

 At this time Munshi Amansingh ji, a pious nobleman of Najibabad, donated 1,200 bighas of Kangri village to Mahatma Munshiram ji for this work
 himalay kii upatyaka main ganga ke tat par saghan ramnik wanon se ghiri kangri kii bhoomi gurukul ke liye adarsh thi
 Hence, some forests were made here after clearing the dense forest and on Monday, 4 March 1902, on the day of Holi, Gurukul Gujranwala was brought to Kangri

 On 24 September 1924, gurukul suffered a terrible disaster
 ganga kii asaadhaaran baadh ne gangatat par bani imaaraton ko bhayankar kshati pahunchaai
 On 1 May 1930 AD, Gurukul was moved from the eastern coast of the Ganges to the present location near Haridwar on the Ganges canal on the west coast for protection from future floods
 1935 i

 The salient features of the Gurukul education system are - students are in touch with the Gurus, to be part of their clan or family, to live a simple and ascetic life in a holistic manner, to pay full attention to character building and physical development like intellectual and mental development, to Sanskrit in education
 Making compulsory, emphasizing the study of Vedic poetry, making Hindi the medium of education, Sanskrit, Dar No, Veda, etc

 Following are some of the characteristics of Gurukul education: prarambh se hi gurukul main sab vishyon kii shiksha hindi ke madhyam dwaara di jaati thi
 The subjects of science, mathematics, western philosophy etc
 were also taught in Hindi
 jab san 1907 main mahavidhyalay vibhaag khulaa to usamen bhi hindi ko hi madhyam rakhaa gaya

 gurukul ne ise kaaryrup main parinat karke dikhaa diya
 At that time, modern scholarly books were not in Hindi

 Color is used to make the scene attractive, a variety of paintings are done on the walls, roofs and curtains and the actors' costumes and decor are also used in different colors and the stage is used for the convenience of the audience
 But the stage of the theater is somewhat higher than the floor
 darshakon ke baithne ke sthaan ko prekshagaar or rangamanch sahit samooche bhawan ko prekshagrih, rangashaala, yaa naatyashaala kehete hai
 In Western countries it is named theater or opera
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki natyakala kaa vikaas sarvapratham bharat main hi hua
 There are some dialogues of Yama and Yami, Pururava and Urvashi etc
 in certain sutras of Rigveda
 in sanvaadon main log naatak ke vikaas kaa chihn pate hai
 It is estimated that drawing inspiration from these dialogues, the people composed the play and the play developed
 yathasamay bharatmuni ne use shastreey rup diya
 Bharata Muni in his Natyashastra has described the process of development of plays as follows: naatakon kaa vikaas chaahe jis prakaar hua ho, sanskrit sahitya main natya granth or tatsambandhi anek shastreey granth likhe gaye or sahitya main naatak likhane kii paripati sanskrit aadi se hoti hui hindi ko bhi praapt hui
 Sanskrit plays are of excellent quality and were mostly written for acting purposes

 isi prakaar mahabharat main rangashaala kaa ullekh he or harivansh puraana tathaa ramayana main naatak khele jane kaa varnan he
 In spite of all this, it is not known for sure what kind of dramas were played and what were the forms of those pavilions
 abhi tak kii khoj ke falswaroop sitawanga gupha ko chhodkar koi aisa grih nahin mila jise sadhikaar natyamandap kaha ja sake
 Western scholars also believe that plays emerged from religious acts
 isse rangasthali ke praarambhik swaroop kii kalpana kii ja sakati he ki vah vrittakar rahi hogi
 Gradually, when more attention has been paid to the spectatorship, it must have been felt that in this circular theater only a few of the spectators can fully enjoy the view, those in the rear are required to raise their heads
 is drushti se katoranuma sthaan rangasthali ke liye adhik upyukt samajha jane laga hoga
 This was a good arrangement for religious acts and dances etc
 dhire-dhire jab naatakon kaa rup adhik viksit hua, tab yah anubhav hua hoga ki kathakaar or abhinaytaon ke saamne kii ore baithanevaalon ko hi dekhne or sunne kii acchhee suvidha hoti he

 shaayad isi kaa anukaran aparvatiy prishthbhumi prastut karata tha
 Perhaps this was followed by creating artificial theater in unconventional places, in which the staircase inside the circular wall was used for the audience to sit, which surrounded the high platform inside

 There was a backstage behind it

 prabal anyonya kriya prakruti kii chaar moolbhoot anyonya kriyaaon main se ek he, anya teen anyonya kriyaayein gurutvkarshan, vidyut chumbakeey anyonya kriya or durbal anyonya kriya hai
 At the nuclear level, this interaction is 100 times stronger than the existing magnetic interaction, so it is much stronger than weak and gravitational interactions
 is anyonya kriya ko protonon va neutronon ke bandhan bal ke rup main bhi pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Before the seventies physicists were unsure about the fastening process of molecular nuclei
 yah us samay bhi gyaat tha ki nabhik protonon va neutronon se milakar bana he jahaan proton dhanaveshit kan hai or neutron anaveshit kan hai
 Therefore, these effects were seen as opposing each other
 tatkaaleen bhautik gyaan ke anusaar, dhanaveshit kan ek dusre ko pratikarshith karte hai or atah nabhik kaa vighatan bahut hi jaldi hona chahie athwa nabhik asthitv main nahin hona chahie
 Although this was never observed
 atah is prakriya ko samajhane ke liye naye bhautikee kii zarurat thi
 Despite the mutual electromagnetic repulsion of the protons, a new strong attraction force was assumed to understand the molecular nucleus
 is kalpit bal ko prabal bal naam diya gaya, jise ek moolbhoot bal mana gaya jo nabhik par aropit hota he jahaan nabhik protonon va neutronon se bana hota he
 Here the carrier of this force was assumed to be π ± and π0
 saath hi in kanon ke dravyaman ke aadhaar par is bal kii paraas fermi koti kii maani jane lagi
 It was invented later that protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles but consist of their constituent particles quarks
 nabhikeey kanon ke madhya lagane vaala prabal aakarshan bal proton va neutron ke andar sthit quarkon ko baandhe rakhane vaale moolbhoot kan kaa parshv prabhaav maatr he
 According to the theory of quantum chroma dynamics, quarks have colored charges, although this color is not related to normal colors
 alag varna aavesh vaale quark prabal anyonya kriya ke prabhaav main ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai jiske vaahak gluon naamak kan hai
 The main reason for saying this interaction is strong is its predominance among all interactions
 yah bal vidyut chumbakeey balon se 102 guna, durbal bal se 106 guna or gurutveey bal se 1039 guna prabal hota he
 This force is studied mainly in quantum chroma dynamics, which is an important part of the standard model
 ganitiya rup se kwantum chromo gatiki samamiti samooh SU par aadhaarit akramavinimay amman siddhanth he
 Quarks and gluons are the only basic particles that have no extinction charge, and therefore take part in strong interactions
 prabal bal pratyaksh rup se keval quark va gluon se hi kriya karata he

 In the context of a wave, art is the length or distance expressed relative to a reference point of that wave
 kisi bindu kii kala se pataa chalata he ki vah bindu us tarang ke graph main kahan sthit hogi
 Often, art is expressed as the ratio of the periodicity of that wave and is often taken as the reference of the point on which the displacement is zero
 tarang ke ek aavartkaal ko 360 degree ke tulya maanate hue kala ko praayah anshon main bhi vyakt karte hai
 For example, the art of a point of a wave being 30 degrees means that the point is 30 / 360 = 1 / 12 of its periodic distance from the reference point

 Thermochemistry also includes the study of the physical changes that occur as a result of energy exploitation or emission, etc
)
 iske saath-saath ushma dharita, jvalan kii ushma, nirmaan kii ushma, inthalpi evam mukt urja kii gananaa bhi kii jaati he
 Typically, a reaction expresses the heat absorbed or absorbed by its equation
 udhaaharan ke liye : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories dwaara pakat hota he ki 1 gram-anu hydrogen gas tathaa 1 gram-anu chlorine gas se sangyojan se jab 2 gram-anu hydrochloric amla gas banati he, to 44,000 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 Similarly, see the following equation: H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories It is revealed that if 256 grams of hydrogen iodide gas is made by combining 2 grams of hydrogen and 254 grams of iodine gas, 11,860 calories of heat will be absorbed in this reaction
 yah to spasht he ki kisi bhi kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra usamen bhaag lenevaale padaarthon kii bhautik avasthaa par nirbhar rahegi; isiilie bhi likh jaati he
 The effect of the physical state on the reaction heat will be clear from the following example: tathaa In the second equation, the amount of heat dissipated is higher than in the first equations because it contains the amount of heat dissolved in 18 grams of steam being dissolved
 jin pratikriyaaon main pratikaarakon ke aaytan main bhi parivartan hota he, unke liye pratikriya-ushma is baat par bhi nirbhar hogi ki pratikriya sthir aaytan par kii gai he athwa sthir daab par
 If the volume is kept constant while reacting, the board does not have to do anything against the external pressure
 atev sthir aaytan par pratikriya kii yatharth urja kshepit yaa shoshit hoti he
 But if the volume is allowed to increase or decrease while keeping the pressure constant while performing the action, the exact value of the reaction heat will not be known
 udhaaharan ke liye; aaytan badhane main mandal bahya daab ke viruddh kaary karata he, jisamen urja vyay hogi; atev yadi pratikriya ushmakshepak he to is avasthaa main kshepit kii maatra kam ho jaaegi
 Normally the heat of reactions is measured at a constant volume
 ushmarsayan ke drushtikon se abhikriyaaon ko praaia: kai virgon main baant lete hai or abhikriya swabhaav ke anukool abhikriya-ushma ko naam de diya jaataa he - jaise vilyan-ushma, tanukaran-ushma, utpaadan-ushma, dahan-ushma tathaa shithilikaran-ushma 
 Heat dissipation often occurs when a solute is dissolved in a solvent
 jo lavan jal se kriya karke jalyojit lavan banaate hai unke ghulne par adhiktar ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The amount of heat absorbed in dissolving other salts is very small
 kisi padaarth ke ek gram-anu ko vilaayak main gholne par kshepit yaa shoshit urja kii maatra ko vilyan-ushma kehete hai
 In addition, there is also a change in heat in diluting the concentrated solution and this is called dilution-heat of the solution
 tanukaran-ushma kii maatra vilyanon kii tanuta ke saath kam haati jaati he or adhik tanu vilyanon ke liye ise shunya mana ja saktaa he
 In the thermochemistry of such dilute solutions, it is called "aqueous"
 udhaaharan ke liye; potacium nitrate jal main villin hokar ati banu vilyan banaata he, to uski vilyan ushma 8,500 calories hoti he
 This fact can be expressed by the following equation: avyav tatwon ke sanyog se kisi yogic ke ek gram-anu banane main jitani ushma shoshit yaa kshepit hoti he, use us yogic kii utpaadan-ushma kaha jaataa he
 For example, it is clear by the following equations that the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitric acid is thermally 94
4, 18
8 and 42
4 calories: utpaadan ushma rinatmak bhi ho sakati he, jaise : The compounds that heat dissolves in the formation of essential elements are called exothermic compounds, and the compounds in which heat is absorbed in formation are called thermodynamic compounds
 adhiktar yogic ushmakshepak hote hai, jaise hydrogen, chloride, jal, hydrogen salafid, salfar dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride aadi sab ushmakshepak yogic hai
 Examples of thermodynamic compounds can be given such as hydrogen iodide, carbon disulfide, acetylene, ozone etc
 ushmashoshak yogic ushmakshepak yogicon kii apeksha bahut kam sthaayee hote hai or sugamawa se apane avyaviya tatwon main vichchhedit ho jate hai
 The above distinction of durability of exothermic and exothermic compounds is due to the difference of energy inherent in them
 udhaaharan ke liye; 1 gram-anu carbon tathaa 1 gram-anu oxygen ke sanyog se jab 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide banataa he, to 94,300 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 It is clear that 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide will have 94,300 calories less energy than its constituents
 isi prakaar carbon dicelphide jaise ushmashoshak yogic main apen avyav tatwon kii apeksha 22,000 calories urja adhik hogi
 If the intrinsic energy of all elements is taken to be zero, then it is clear from the appropriate interpretation that the inherent energy of the compounds will be equal to their production heat; But if the output energy is negative then the underlying energy will be positive and conversely if the output is heat positive, the underlying energy will be negative
 udhaahrant: carbon dioxide tathaa carbon dicelaphid kii antarnihit urjaayen krmanusaar - 94,300 tathaa 22,000 calories ke baraabar hongi
 The amount of heat that is absorbed by burning one gram-molecule of an element y compound completely at a constant volume in oxygen is called combustion-heat of that element or compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnlikhit sameekaran se spasht he ki methen kii dahan-ushma 2,12,800 calories he : On burning carbon in oxygen, it is possible to form two compounds - yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki carbon kii dahan-ushma 94,300 calories he, 26,000 calories nahin, kyonki pratham kriya main hi carbon purnataya jalataa yaa oxykrut hota he
 In the second process, carbon is converted to carbon monoxide, but its combustion is not complete yet because carbon monoxide can be further combusted and oxidized to carbon dioxide
 dahan-ushma gyaat karne ke liye ek vishesh prakaar ke calorimapak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise bam-calorimapak kehete hai
 Scientific Barthels first built it in 1881
 yah ganmetal ispaat kaa bana rahata he or belan ke aakar kaa hota he
 a special type of enamel is placed on its inner plane, due to which there is no action of oxygen on it
 dhakkan dha ko dridhtaa se band karne ke liye isamen majboot pench lage rahete hai
 a certain amount of the substance to be combusted is taken into the platinum cup "P" and the oxygen is filled at about 20-25 atmospheric pressure in the bomb
 iske baad vam ko dridhtaa se band karke use saadhaaran calorimapak main rakhte hai
 a certain amount of water is taken in an ordinary colorimeter and by experiment it is already determined how much heat is required to increase the temperature of the water in this colorimeter by 1 degree centigrade
 bahya calorimapak main jal kaa taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now platinum wires a and a conduct electricity through a fine wire of iron
 vidyutpravaah se taar t garam hokar laal ho jaataa he or pyaali pa main rakhaa padaarth oxykrut hone lagata he
 In the burning of iron wire and in this process of oxidation, heat is absorbed, the amount of which is determined by an increase in the temperature of the water present in the external colorimeter
 is prayog se praapt ushma-maatra main se lohe ke jvalan main kshepit ushma ko ghataakar padaarth ke dahan dwaara kshepit ushma kii maatra gyaat kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that in this experiment the volume of the circle is constant; Therefore, combustion-heat of a substance can be determined by this method
 ek gram-tulya maatra kshar ko ek gram-tulya maatra amla dwaara shithil karne par ushma kii jo maatra lepit hoti he use shithilikaran-ushma kehete hai
 If acid and alkali are taken up in such dilute solutions that they are completely decomposed into ions, the action of relaxation will be the formation of undissociated molecules by simply combining hydrogen and hydroxyl ions
 atev tanu vilyanon main sab prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshaaron ke shithilikaran kii ushma samaan hogi
 The value of this heat is 13,700 calories by experiment
 at: prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshar ke shithilikaran ko nimnlikhit samikarnon dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : Where x is a radical and m is a metal, arthath Ie parantu yadi amla yaa kshar durbal ho, to vah tanu vilyan main bhi purnataya vighatit na hoga
 Therefore, the relaxing heat of such acids or bases will not yield 13,700 calories
 udhaaharan ke liye ammonium hydroxide kii ynikaran-ushma -1,500 calories he, atev ammonium hydroxide tathaa kisi prabal amla kii shithilikaran ushma 12,200 calories hogi
 To determine the heat dissipated by the experiment, a certain amount of alkali diluted solution in a thermos flask is then immersed into the flask with constant heat, so that radiation does not alter the temperature of the solution within the flask
 ab banu vilyan main amla kii samatuly maatra lekar uskaa taap kshar ke taap ke baraabar sthir kar lete hai
 Once the temperature of the acid is stable, it is quickly added to alkali
 kaach ke ek vilodak dwaara vilyan ko chalaakar uskaa ucchtam taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now if the quantity of the alloy solution, its specific heat, heat, the heat dissipation of the flask used, is known, then the amount of heat absorbed in the relaxation process can be easily determined
 isi vidhi dwaara lavenon kii vilyan-ushma bhi sugamawa se nikaal sakate hai
 The most important law of thermochemistry was formulated by Swiss scientist Germain Henry Hess in 1840
 is niyam ke anusaar, Hess's law has proved very useful in thermochemistry
 isaki sahaayta se pratyaksh rup se na kii ja sakanevaali pratikriyaaon main honevaale ushma-parivartanon ko bhi paroksh rup se nikaala ja saktaa he
 for example; Ordinarily, the production-heat of organic compounds cannot be extracted by direct action, but by determining the combustion-heat of the organic compound and its elements, the production-heat of the compound can be removed by Hess's law
 rasinic kriyaaon se praapt urja hi hamaare udyogon ko chalaane kaa saadhan rahi he
 Today, in the era of artificial satellites, when humans are trying to travel to the moon and other planets, it has become necessary to search for fuels whose micro to microscopic quantity can give more energy
 boran yogic is ore bahut upyogi siddh ho rahe hai, kyonki samaan maatra main carbon yogicon se unki dahan-ushma adhik hoti he or ve hamen adhik urja dene main safal hote hai
 Other uses of thermochemistry have been around for a long time
 udhaaharan ke liye ;pratham talika main aluminium auksaide kii utpaadan-ushma sabase adhik dikhaai gai he
 The same property has been used in Goldschmitt's heating method
