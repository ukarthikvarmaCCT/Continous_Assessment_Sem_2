 vaidic samay se hi vishnu sampoorn vishwa kii sarvocch shakti tathaa niyanta ke rup main maanya rahe hai
 Vishnu is one of the three main forms of God in the basic texts of Hinduism, according to the Puranic Purana
 puraanon main trimurti vishnu ko vishwa kaa paalanhaar kaha gaya he
 Brahma and Shiva are considered to be the other two forms of Trimurti
 brahma ko jahaan vishwa kaa srijan karne vaala mana jaataa he, vahiin shiv ko sanhaarak mana gaya he
 Originally Vishnu and Shiva and Brahma are also the same, this belief has also been generally accepted
 nyaay ko prashray, anyaay ke vinaash tathaa jeev ko paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg-grahan ke nirdesh hetu vibhinn roopon main avatar grahan karanevaale ke rup main vishnu maanya rahe hai
 According to the Puranas, Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi
 kaamdev vishnu ji kaa putr tha
 Vishnu's abode is Kshira Sagar
 unka shayan sheshnag ke upar he
 a lotus is produced from his navel in which Brahma ji is situated
 vah apane neeche vaale baayein haath main padam, apane neeche vaale daahine haath main gada ,upar vaale baayein haath main shankh or apane upar vaale daahine haath main chakra dhaaran karte hai
 The derivation of the word 'vishnu' has been considered mainly from the 'vishu' metal
 nirukt main yaskacharya ne mukhya rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko hi 'vyapti' ke arth main lete hue usase 'vishnu' shabd ko nishpann bataaya he
 Alternatively, 'vishwa Dhatu' is also taken to mean 'entry', 'because it is penetrated everywhere because of being an aspect
 aadi shankaracharya ne bhi apane vishnusahasranam-bhashya main 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth mukhyatah vyapak hi mana he, tathaa uski vyutpatti ke rup main spashtatah likhaa he ki "vyapti arth ke vaachak nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup 'vishnu' banataa he"
 He has also taken the 'vishwa Dhatu' option and wrote that "or the negative form of the 'vishva Dhatu' is Vishnu; as stated in Vishnupurana - 'the power of that Mahatma has entered this whole world
 ; Therefore he is called Vishnu, because ‘vish’ dhatu means to enter ”
 rugveda ke pramukh bhashyakaron ne bhi praayah ek swar se 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth vyapak hi kiya he
 In the interpretation of Vishnusukta, Acharya Saiyan means 'vishnu' is pervasive and omnipresent; So Shripad Damodar Satavalekar also takes its meaning related to the generality
 maharishi dayanand saraswati ne bhi 'vishnu' kaa arth anekatra sarvyaapee paramatma kiya he or kai jagah param vidvan ke arth main bhi liya he
 Thus it is clearly reflected that the word 'vishnu' is derived from 'vishu' metal and its meaning is vyapam
 vaidic dev-parampara main sookhton kii sankhyik drushti se vishnu kaa sthaan gaun he kyonki unka stvan maatr 5 sookhton main kiya gaya he; lekin yadi sankhyik drushti se na dekhakar unpar or pahaluon se vichaar kiya jaay to unka mahatva bahut badhkar saamne aata he
 In the Rigveda, he is read with adjectives like 'brihachhriar', Yuvakumar etc
 rugveda main ullikhit vishnu ke swaroop evam vaishishtyon kaa avlokan nimnanki binduon main kiya ja saktaa he :- The unique feature of Vishnu is his three foot-projections, which are mentioned twelve times in the Rigveda
 sambhavtah yah unki sabase badi visheshta he
 His three steps are said to be full of honey, which never diminishes
 unke teen pad-kram itane vistrut hai ki unamem sampoorn lok vidyaman rahete hai 
 'tredha Vichkramana' also transitions to three foot-projections
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad bhi ukt tathy ke parichaayak hai
 Out of his three rankings supplied with Madhu, two are visible, the third is completely imperceptible
 is tisare sarvocch pad ko pakshiyon kii udaan or martya chakshu ke us paar kaha gaya he
 Yask's predecessor Shakupani considers these three footprints to be the symbols of the Sun's movement in three parts of the Universe - Earth, Space and Duloka
 yask ke hi purvavarti aurnavabh unhen surya ke udai, madhyakash main sthiti tathaa ast kaa vaachi maanate hai
 Tilak Sir considers them as a sign of trifurcation of the year
 yadi dekha jaay to adhikansh vidvan vishnu ko surya-vaachi maan kar udaykaal se madhyahn paryant uskaa ek padprakshep, madhyahn se astkaal paryant dwitiya padprakshep or astkaal se punah agrim udaykaal tak tritiy paad-prakshep sweekaarte hai
 These aforesaid two foot projections have been called visible and the third one is unmarked
 lekin mcdanal sahit anya anek vidwaanon kaa bhi kahana he ki is arth main tisare charan ko 'sarvocch' kaise mana ja saktaa he? isliye ve log purvokt shakpuni kii tarah teen charnon ko saura devtaa ke teenon lokon main se hokar jane ke maarg ko maanate hai
 Supporting the idea of the Sun, mcdanal mentions the operation of his 90 horse by Vishnu, each of which has four names
 is prakaar 4 kii sankhya se gunikrut 90 arthath 360 ashwon ko ve ek saura varsh ke dinon se abhinn maanate hai
 In fact, the two terms of Vishnu indicate the control of the whole world and his attainment of the third post i
e
 His ultimate abode
 swayan rugveda main hi in teen padon kii rahasyatmak vyakhya kii gayi he
 Therefore, considering this verse as knowledgeable, it has been clearly stated in the Rigveda that the ultimate post of Vishnu is known only by the learned people
 vaise to vishnu ko vaani main nivas karne vaala bhi mana jaataa he, kintu unka param priy awaas sthal 'pathah' rugveda main bahucharchit he
 Acharya Sayan considered the term 'giri' to be a courtesy, along with its meaning 'vani', as well as figuratively 'advanced folk like a mountain'
 'giri' ko yadi in donon arthon main sweekrut kar liya jaay to samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Where Vishnu reaches the third position is his place of residence
 vishnu kaa lok ‘param pad’ he arthath gantavya roopen vah sarvotkrisht lok he
 The specialty of that 'param pad' is that it is highly illuminated
 vahaan anek shringon vaali gaayen sancharan kiya karti hai
 'gavah' is like a courtesy here
 shlesh se uskaa arth ‘gaayen’ karne par vahaan dugdh aadi bhautik pushti kaa prachurya evam ‘kirane’ karne par vahaan prakaash arthath atmik unnati kaa bahulya sahaj hi anumey he
 The 'param Pad' of Vishnu has a permanent emanation of Madhu
 yah ‘madhu’ devataaon ko bhi anandit karanevaala he
 Whatever meaning is given to this elegant verse, but it is a sign of bliss in every situation, for which all the creatures including the deity are also desirous and are also trying
 isliye ukt lok kii prapti kii kaamana sabhi karte hai
 In the same mantra, there are also mentions of virtuous people there, while experiencing fulfillment
 vishnu kii ek pramukh visheshta unka indra se maitribhav he
 Indra's companionship enforces his three footsteps
 indra ke saath milakar vah shambar daitya ke 99 kilon kaa vinaash karte hai
 In the same way, he also helps Indra in the battle with vrittra
 donon ko kahin-kahin ek duusare kii shaktiyon se yukt bhi batalaaya gaya he
 Thus Sompan by Vishnu and three foot projections by Indra are also described
 rugveda, mandal 6, sookt 69 main donon devon kaa yugmaroopen stvan hua he
 Similarly, in the verse 5, Sukta 87 of the Rigveda, he gets his help with Indra's fellow Marudagans
 vish dhaatu se vyutpann vishnu pad kaa shabdic arth ‘vyapak, gatisheel, kriyasheel athwa udhyam-sheel’ hota he
 They are praised by the people due to their force and disorder
 ve anant veeryavale hai
 Due to this quality, he is also considered as ‘vrishna’ symbolically
 apane veery athwa vir karmon ke kaaran ve shatruon ke bhay kaa kaaran hai
 People are afraid of them in the same way as a mountain lion
 ‘parameshwaradbhitih’ aadi shruti-vachanon se saamaanya janon kaa bhi unase bhay karnaa siddh ho jaataa he
 Being afraid of them is not without reason
 ve kutsiton kaa vadh aadi hinsakarm karne vaale hai
 It is important to note here that they kill the snotty violent person
 isliye unke liye kaha gaya he ki ve hatyare nahin hai
 Vishnu is wide-ranging, broad and of unrestrained speed
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad is tathy ke poshak hai
 The meaning of 'uruguay' is not even glorified by Acharya Sayan by 'mahajajans doing Stuyaman' or 'prabhutya Stuyaman'
 da
yadunandan mishra kaa kahana he ki is pad kaa arth ‘visteern gati vaala’ karne ke liye ham is liye aagrahvan hai, kyonki use ‘sabhi lokon main sancharan karne vaala’ kaha gaya he
 Their rankings are so long that they measure the three worlds with their three footprints
 vishnu ke teen pad yadi sristi karte hai, sthaapan karte hai, dhaaran karte hai to vahiin par ashrith janon kaa paalan-poshan bhi kiya karte hai
 People receive their bhagya annadi as a prasad of the same three order, so that they experience ultimate fulfillment
 jo log vishnu kii stuti karte hai, unka ve sarvavidh kalyaan karte hai, kyonki unke stavnadi karm se use param sphurti milti he
 In this way, everyone is eager to reach the praise of Lord Vishnu
 ve varisht daata hai
 Trinity is also reflected in the qualities of Vishnu
 ve teen pad-kram vaale, teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale, teenon lokon ko naap lene vaale or lokatray ke dharak hai
 Similarly, he is also the equated form of 'tridhatu' ie satta, raja and tama or containing earth, water and light
 vishnu parthiv lokon kaa nirmaan or param vistrut antariksh aadi lokon kaa prasthaapan karne vaale hai
 They are the three types of movement in self-constructed worlds
 unki ye teen gatiyaan udbhav, sthiti or vilay kii pratik hai
 In this way, they are also the creators of everyone, both spinach and destroyer
 ve 'lokatray kaa akelaa dharak' hai
 They measure all three worlds alone with their three footprints
 lokatray ko naap lene se bhi yah falit hota he ki lokatray arthath vahaan ke samgr praani unke purna niyantran main hai
 Vishnu is also an embryo-protector
 garbhasth beej kii raksha ke liye or sundar balak kii utpatti ke liye vishnu kii prarthana kii jaati he
 Due to the clear emphasis on his foster nature, he has been called 'vishnurgopa Paraman Pati 

' meaning the protector of all, even in the Ahoratra fire form in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan rugveda ke ashtum mandal ke pachchisven sookt ke barahawein mantra kii vyakhya main bhi vishnu ko spasht rup se 'paalan se yukt' maanate hai
 xxrep 4 
 isliye samgr pariprekshya main rugveda main vishnu ko param hitaishi kaha gaya he
 Despite being mentioned in most mantras, Indra is called 'sukrit' and Vishnu is called 'sukritara'
 'sukruttarah' kaa acharya sayan ne 'uttam fal pradaan karne waalon main shreshth' arth kiya he; shripad satavlekar ji ne 'uttam karm karne waalon main sarvshereshth' arth kiya he or maharishi dayanand saraswati ji ne bhi 'ativ uttam karm vaala' arth kiya he
 Indra is 'sukrit' and Vishnu is 'sukritarah'
 taatpary spasht he ki rugveda main hi yah maan liya gaya he ki vishnu sarvocch hai
 Similarly, despite being the king of Indra, the supremacy of Vishnu is also clear in the Rigveda that in it it is said for Vishnu that "he holds the whole world alone" and Indra is told that he States do
 taatpary spasht he ki sristi ke sarjak evam paalak vishnu ne sanchaalan hetu indra ko raja banaaya he
 In this well-defined perspective, Brahmin texts related to the supremacy of Vishnu and later mythological beliefs also spontaneously emerge
 brahman-yug main yajna-sanstha kaa vipul vikaas hua or iske saath hi devamandali main vishnu kaa mahatva bhi pehle kii apeksha adhiktar ho gaya
 At the beginning of Aitareya Brahmana, in order to give place in yagya, starting with fire, Vishnu's place has been called 'param'
 inke madhya anya devataaon kaa sthaan he
 In this way, Vishnu has been given a much higher place in the Vedic Samhita texts than the fire that attained the foremost place
 vastutah vishnu ko mahattam to rugveda main bhi mana hi gaya he, par varnan kii alpata ke kaaran vahaan unka sthaan gaun lagata he
 He has been given the highest rank by the explicit statement in the Brahmin texts
 yah shreshthata is katha se bhi spasht hoti he ki vishnu ne apane teen pagon dwaara asuron se prithvi, veda tathaa vaani sab chhinakar indra ko de di
 This is the narrative conversion of the three steps of the Vedic Vishnu into Brahmins; And with this, the superiority of Vishnu also became clear in the Brahmin era itself
 aitarey brahman spasht rup se vishnu ko dwarpal kii tarah devataaon kaa sarvatha sangrakshak maanata he
 The signs available in the Rigveda and the Brahmins have had substantial additions to the Puranas - narrative as well, descriptive as well as explanatory
 puraanon ne is jagat ke mul main vartmaan, nity, ajanma, akshay, avyay, ekares tathaa hey ke abhaav se nirmal parabrahm ko hi vishnu sangya di he
 He is devoid of instructions and adjectives like 'paranaam Par:', the divine located in the inner soul, the supreme superior and the form, varna etc
 ve janm, vruddhi, parinaam, kshay or naash -- in chah vikaron se rahit hai
 They are widespread and the whole world is inhabited by them; That is why scholars call him 'vasudev'
 jis samay din, raat, akaash, prithvi, andhkaar, prakaash tathaa inke atirikt bhi kuch nahin tha, us samay ekmaatr vahi pradhan purush param brahm vidyaman the, jo ki indriyon or buddhi ke vishay nahin hai
 At the beginning of the universe, the same sentiment expressed by Lord Vishnu as Chatur Shloki Bhagwat in the original knowledge of Brahma, - i was the only one before creation
 mere atirikt na sthool tha na sookshm or na donon kaa kaaran agyaan
 Where this is not a creation, i am the one and i am the one who seems to be in the form of this creation and i am the one who will survive
 in sandarbhon se vishnu kii sarvocchata tathaa sarvaniyanta hone kii bhaavana spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Vishnu is believed to have two forms
 pratham rup-- pradhan purush or doosraa rup 'kaal' he
 These both combine and separate both creation and holocaust, or nature and man
 yah kaal rup bhagavan anadi tathaa anant hai; isliye sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or pralay bhi kabhi nahin rukate
 In the context of the origin of creation in the Bhagavata Maha Purana, known as the Sirmour of the Vaishnavas and the 'tilak of Puranas', it is said that the lotus emerged from the navel of Vishnu, who slept in Ekarnava, and realized all the qualities in it
 With the entry of Vishnu himself, the Vedmaya Brahma automatically emerged
 isi prakaar adhikansh puraanon main vishnu ko param brahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The Puranas are full of stories related to them
 paalankarta hone ke kaaran unhen jaagtik drushti se yada-kada vividh prapanchon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Suggesting deception to be tricked by the Asuras, advising the gods on sea-churning for regaining sovereignty when the Asuras seize the kingdom; And by taking the form of erotic Mohini and enticing the Asuras to feed the nectar to the gods; Vishnu's deception in the stories mentioned in the sub-divisions like Devi Bhagwat and Shivpuran related to dissolving the essence of Tulsi for the slaughter of Shankhchud
 is sambandh main yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki paalankarta hone ke kaaran ve parinaam dekhte hai
 Due to the disenfranchisement of the asuras / unjust by any boon, if the end of the unjust and deceit is scandalized, they do not hesitate to cheat
 ramavatar main chhipakar bali ko maarna tathaa krishnavatar main mahabharat yuddh main anek chhalon kaa vidhayak bananaa unke isi drushtikon kaa parichaayak he
 Carpenters use these stories as an antidote to arbitrary interpretation
 parantu inhen sandarbhik gyaan kii drushti se dekhnaa isliye aavashyak he kyonki puraanon yaa tatsambandhi granthon main ye prasang vipareet sthitiyon main saamaanya se itar vishisht kartavya ke gyaan hetu hi upasthaapit kiye gayi hai
 It is important to note that in Puranas, elemental knowledge is called Brahma, God and God
 vishnu kaa sampoorn swaroop gyanatmak he
 In the Puranas, the jewelery and armaments worn by them are also considered symbolic: - is prakaar samast srujanaatmak upadan tattvon ko vishnu apane sharir par dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 a stanza related to the figure of Srivishnu is very famous: - shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshm
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrash Megha Varnam Shubhangam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam
 vande vishnu bhavabhayaharan sarvalokaikanatham
 
 bhavarth - jinaki akruti atishay shant he, jo sheshnag kii shaiya par shayan kiye hue hai, jinaki naabhi main camel he, jo devataaon ke bhi ishwar or sampurna jagat ke aadhaar hai, jo akaash ke sadrush sarvatra vyaapt hai, nilmegh ke samaan jinka varna he, atishay sundar jinke sampurna ang hai, jo yogiyon dwaara dhyaan karke praapt kiye jate hai, jo sampurna lokon ke swami hai, jo janm-maran rup bhay kaa naash karne vaale hai, aise lakshmipathi, kamalnetra bhagwaan vishnu ko main pranaam karata hoon
 Vishnu's superiority does not mean that Shiva or Brahma etc
 are inferior to him
 oonch-neech kaa bhav ishwar ke paas nahin hota
 It is just a priority to be virtuous in Leela for creation and operation
 isliye vaishnav ho yaa shaiva -- sabhi puraana tathaa mahabharat jaise shreshth granth ek swar se ghoshit karte hai ki ishwar ek hi hai
 It is said that the same Lord Janardhana holds these three nouns - 'brahma', 'vishnu' and 'shiva' - for the creation, condition and destruction of the world
 anekatra vishnu tathaa shiv ke ek hi hone ke spasht kathan uplabdh hote hai
 The word 'avatar' literally means the manifestation of God in the physical world through his independent power
 avatar kii siddhi do dashaon main maani jaati he -- ek to apane rup kaa parityag kar kaaryvash naveen rup kaa grahan; tathaa doosraa naveen janm grahan kar sambaddh rup main aana, jisamen mata ke garbh main uchit kaal tak ek sthiti kii baat bhi sannivisht he
 It does not involve changing the form for a short time or regaining the form of another
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke chaturth adhyay ke suprasiddh saatven evam aathven shloke main bhagavan ne swayan avatar kaa prayojan bataate hue kaha he ki -- jab-jab dharm kii haani or adharm kaa utthan ho jaataa he, tab-tab sajjanon ke paritran or dushton ke vinaash ke liye main vibhinn yugon main utpann hota hoon
 Apart from this, a specific and more lofty purpose has been said in the Bhagavata Mahapurana that God is beyond the nature of growth, destruction, etc
, is indestructible, eternal, nirguna
 to yadi ve avatar rup main apni lila ko prakat nahin karte to jeev unke ashesh gunon ko kaise samajhate? atah jeevon ke preranaroop kalyaan ke liye unhone apane ko tathaa apni lila ko prakat kiya
 Therefore, there are many odd situations in different avatar-stories so that the organism can understand what the proper path is according to the situation! vishnu ke avtaron kii pehali vyavasthit suchi mahabharat main uplabdh hoti he
 The total number of incarnations in Shantiparva of Mahabharata is stated to be 10: - hans: kurmashch matsyasch pradurbhava dwijottam 
 Varaho Narasimhash Vamno Ram & Ch
 raamo dashrathishchaev satvat: kalkirev c 
 That is, Hans Kurm Matsya Varaha Narasimha Vaman Parashurama Dasharathanandan Ram Yaduvanshi Shri Krishna and Kalki - all these are my avatars

 The description in the text is of six incarnations: 1

 Instead of counting the swan as an avatar, the number of the Dash is complete
 mahabharat ke dakshinatya paath main avatar kaa varnan is prakaar he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varahash Narasimhash Vamana: raamo ramashch ramashch krishna: kalki c te dash
 Here, from the aforesaid incarnations, leaving the swan and adding the third Rama i
e
 Balarama, the number of Dash is complete
 is vivaran se ek baat pramanit ho jaati he ki mahabharat-kaal tak dash se adhik avtaron kii kalpana bhi nahin kii gayi thi; anyathaa un dash avtaron ko 'bhoot or bhavishya ke bhi sabhi avatar' nahin kaha gaya rahata
 Later, other avatars were also conceived and the total number of incarnations reached twenty-four
 bhagwat mahapurana main 22 tathaa 24 avtaron kii gananaa ke baavjood avtaron kii bahumanya sankhya mahabharat vaali dash hi rahi he
 Many Puranas like Padmapuran, Lingapurana, Varahapuran, Matsyapuran etc
 have mentioned about the same avatars
 agnipurana ke varnan main bhi bilkul vahi kram he
 The following verses of this context are generally universal: matsayah kurmo varahashch narsinghoth vamanh

 sahvaag agar apane form main hon to kisi bhi akraman ko dhwast karne kii kshamta rakhte hai

 tritiy francisi ganatantr ne france par 1870 se lekar 1940 tak shashan kiya
 It was founded at the end of the Second French Empire at the time of the france-prussia War and came to an end with the defeat of France in 1940 by Nazi Germany
 1870 i
 main sidan ke yuddh main prasha ke haathon france kii sharmnaak paraajay hui thi jiske parinamswaroop france ko apane do bahumoolya pradesh alsaas evam loren prasha ko dena pade the
 After this defeat, the political situation of France became turbid and for the third time a republic was established, which is known as the Third Republic of France in history
 is paraajay ke baad napolian tritiy ko baadhya hokar aatm-samarpan karnaa padaa
 He was arrested
 jab agle din arthath 3 sitambar ko yah samachar france kii rajdhani paris pahunchaa to paris kii samast janata ke mukh par yah prashn tha ki ab kya hoga, kyonki unke dwaara 20 varsh purv sthapit raaj-satta akasmaat hi nasht ho gai
 The public now reached the decision that republican rule should be established in France
 us samay vyavasthapika sabha kaa adhiveshan ho rahaa tha
 At that time the people got the proposal passed by the House at the time that Napoleon III should be separated from the post of Emperor of France
 is prakaar napolian tritiy kaa patan hua or france main teesri baar ganatantric sarkaar kii sthapana hui
 The next day after the fall of Napoleon III, members of the House of Assembly gathered at the City Hall in Paris under the leadership of Gambetta, who decided to establish republican rule in France
 paris kii adhikansh janata ne uskaa saath diya
 At that time there were three party heads in France who were supporters of the Republic, but in some things there were enough differences among them
 kintu yah samay parsparik vaad-vivaad or ladaai-jhagade main vyateet karne kaa nahin tha, kyonki german sena badi teji ke saath france kii ore badi chali aa rahi thi
 Therefore, the people of all the parties collectively decided that the government should be formed at the earliest under the leadership of Gamebeta and Thiers
 prasha ne france par jo akraman kiya tha usamen france parajeet ho rahaa tha
 It was the desire of the gamebeta etc
 that the war should not be ended, but the royalist were in favor of ending the war
 yah vivaad itnaa teevr ho gaya ki iskaa nirnay karne ke liye ek raashtra pratinidhi sabha kaa aayojan karnaa padaa jisamen sanyog se rajasattavadiyon kii sankhya adhik thi jisase spasht hota he ki france kii janata is samay yuddh kii apeksha shaanti chaahati thi
 On 10 May 1871, a treaty was reached in France and Germany, according to which France had to lose its two prosperous provinces - Elsace and Laurent
 inkaa kshetrafal das hajaar vargamil tha or isaki jansankhya 16 lakh thi
 He had to pay a lot of money to Germany as a compensation for war
 france ko metj or strassvarg ke prasiddh durgo par germany kaa adhikaar sweekaar karnaa padaa
 After the treaty with Germany, fights started in various parties
 paris kii janata ne thiurs evam raashtra pratinidhi sabha ke viruddh vidroh kiya jiske kaaran nimnlikhit the- After harshly suppressing the Paris uprising, a serious situation arose in front of Theers
 is vidroh ke kaaran france kii dasha bahut hi shochaneey ho gai thi or abhi tak france main vah sena upasthit thi jo germany kii ore se yudhkshati purti praapt karne ke liye thahari hui thi
 That army could be evacuated from France by paying three billion rupees
 aisi paristhiti main itani badi rakam kaa praapt karnaa koi saral kaary nahin tha
 Theers did not panic from this horrific situation
 usne bade utsaah tathaa saahas ke saath dhan praapt karnaa aarambh kiya
 Within two years, by giving all the money to the German army, he evacuated France from them
 uske is kaary se france kii janata kaa us par vishwaas bad gaya or vah har sambhav rup se uski sahaayta karne ke liye udyat ho gai
 After this, Theyers' attention was drawn to what kind of government and governance should be established in France now
 thiurs ke netritv main jo samayik sarkaar nirmit kii gai thi vah ganatantr ke aadhaar par thi, vah uskaa raashtrapati tha
 But there was a majority of the royalists in the National House of Representatives
 desh main shaanti tathaa suvyavastha kii sthapana hone par rajasattavadiyon ne rajasatta kii sthapana ke liye praytn karnaa chaha
 Thayers was initially a royalist, but there was so much difference among the royalists that Thayers was forced to change his views
 ab vah ganatantr kaa samarthak ban gaya jiske kaaran rajasattavadi uske virdohi ho gayi or unhone rajasatta kii sthapana ke liye khule taur par aandolan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Thiers could not bear his act
 atah usne disambar 1872 i
 main ghoshnaa kii ki yadi france main rajasatta kii sthapana kaa prayaas kiya jaayegaa to france main punah rajyakranti ho jaaegi
 The clear result of this proclamation was that the royalists turned against him
 usko ganatantrvaadiyon kaa bhi samarthan praapt nahin ho sakaa, kyonki ve usko bahut naram vichaaron vaala vyakti samajhate the
 In May 1873, a motion was passed against him by the monarchists, which made it clear that the House of Representatives had no faith in him and he was forced to resign from his post due to this situation
 ab rajtantravaadiyon ne marshan maikmahome ko raashtrapati ke pad par asin kiya
 He was a partisan of the state and announced that he would relinquish the office of president at a time when a person would be appointed king
 rajasattavadiyon main is prashn par ki kis vyakti ko raja banaaya jaye, bada vaimnasy tathaa matbhed tha or ve kisi nishchit parinaam par nahin pahunch sake
 Now the constitution of the Third Republic began to be made
 29 may san 1875 i
 ke ek prastaav dwaara nishchit kar diya gaya ki ab france main rajtantr kii sthapana na hokar ganatantr kii sthapana hogi
 The motion passed by a majority of just one vote
 iske uparaant france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan banaaya gaya jiske anusaar The Republic Government, after strengthening its position, paid special attention to the progress of the country and made the following reforms- france kii ganatantr sarkaar ke samaksh carch kaa prashn bada mahatvapurn tha
 The question was what kind of relationship the state and the church should have
 yah keval dharmik prashn hi na hokar ek raajnneetik prashn bhi tha
 The reason for this was that the clergy of France was a supporter of the monarchy and opposed to the republic
 jitne bhi aandolan rajtantr ke samarthan main hue un sabamein padri varg kaa pratyaksh athwa paroksh rup se haath avashya tha
 For this reason the supporters of the republic began to attack the rights of the church
 1877 i
 main hi gembete ne yah spasht rup se kah diya tha ki 'padri varg ganatantr kaa kattar virdohi he
 'by this time, the Church had authority over all of France's education
 france kii adhikansh janata apane bacchon ko is shiksha se mukt karne ke paksh main thi
 After the Dreyfus case, the republicans began to attack the Church's rights
 unhone uski shakti ko kam karne ke liye nimna kanoonon ko paas kiya- The defeat of Napoleon III and the Treaty of Fernfurt caused a great blow to France's honor and prestige in the international world
 is samay europea raajnneetik rang-manch par germany ke chancelar bismark kaa bolbalaa tha, jisane aisi niti kaa anukaran kiya ki europe main france kaa koi mitra nahin ban paye
 Due to France's colonial policy, its relations with Great Britain were not good and Bismarck made political treaties with other important states
 jis samay tak germany kii shashan-satta par bismark kaa adhikaar rahaa vah apni niti main safal rahaa
 But later this situation could not remain
 bismark ke pad tyaagane par france or rus kii sandhi hui jo 'dwigut sandhi' ke naam se itihaas main prasiddh hui
 The reason for this treaty was that both of them feared Germany and now Germany began to openly favor Austria in the Balkan Peninsula
 iske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki akraman ke samay donon ek duusare kii sahaayta karenge
 After this, France tried to befriend great-britain
 england germany kii badhati hui shakti se ashankit rahane laga tha or usne bhi anubhav kiya ki usko kisi europea shakti se mitrataa kerani aavashyak he
 France and England ended their mutual quarrel and entered into a treaty called the Anta Cordial
 1907 i
 main rus bhi isamen sammilit ho gaya
 Thus established threesome friendship in Europe
 morocco ke prashn par europe ke vibhinn guton main sangharsh hone kii sambhaavna utpann ho gai thi, kintu aapasi samjhaute dwaara is prashn kaa nirnay kar liya gaya
 Thus, after sustained efforts, France gained its lost power and prestige in the international world and it was counted among the great nations of Europe

 The remaining provision of the glass-steagall Act - which was enacted after the Great Depression - prohibited banks from merging with insurance underwriters and meant that Citigroup had time between two and five years to recover any Disinvestment of prohibited property
 However, Weil said at the time of the merger that he believed "that the legislation will change after that time 


 We have discussed enough to gain the confidence that this will not become a problem"
 Indeed, the passage of the gramm-leach-bliele Act in November 1999 confirmed the views of Reid and Weil, which opened the way for the financial services organization to offer a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, insurance risk marking and brokerage

 In the context of mathematics, trigonometric substitution means replacing trigonometric functions in place of non-trigonometric functions
 inke upyog se kuch samakal saral ho jate hai
 Substitute 1
 If the integral contains a2 - x2, rakhen or yah sarvasamika prayog karen- Substitute 2
 If the integrand contains a2 + x2, let and use the identity 1 + tan 2 ⁡ θ = sec 2 ⁡ θ
 { \ displaystyle 1+ \ tan ^ {2} \ theta = \ sec ^ {2} \ theta
} pratisthaapan 3
 If the integrand contains x2 − a2, let and use the identity In the integral we may use Note that the above step requires that a > 0 and cos > 0; we can choose the a to be the positive square root of a2; and we impose the restriction on θ to be −π / 2 < θ < π / 2 by using the arcsin function
 For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change
 For example, as x goes from 0 to a / 2, then sin goes from 0 to 1 / 2, so θ goes from 0 to π / 6
 Then we have Some care is needed when picking the bounds
 The integration above requires that −π / 2 < θ < π / 2, so θ going from 0 to π / 6 is the only choice
 If we had missed this restriction, we might have picked θ to go from π to 5π / 6, which would give us the negative of the result
 In the integral we may write so that the integral becomes

 Being based on javascript, users do not need to download new versions of Gmail separately
