 yah jibraltar jal sandhi tathaa spain ke purvi tat se sudurvarti kshetron ko prabhavit karne vaale avadaabon se sambandhit teevr dakshini pashchimi hawa hai, jo praaia sheetkaal main teevr varsha karti hai Trita is the central and esoteric doctrine of Christianity related to the inward form of God, which is called trinity
 tritv kaa arth he ki ek hi ishwar main teen vyakti hai -- pita, putr tathaa pavitra aatma 
 These three are equally eternal, infinite and omnipotent because human wisdom can reach the existence of only one almighty creator God by reason of logic
 vastut: tritv ke dharmasiddhant par isiliye vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki uski shiksha isa ne di he
 The first half of the Bible shows that monotheism was given special emphasis in Judaism
 bible ke uttarardh main isa us akeshwar ko banaae rakhte hue bhi yah shiksha dete hai ki main or param pita parameshwar ek hi hai 
 Apart from this, he tells his disciples that i will send the Holy Spirit away and will be with you in a dark way
 us pavitra aatma ko bhi vah ishwariya gunon se samanvit maanate hai
 In this way Jesus clearly states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit exist in the same God
 baad main tryek ishwar kii is visheshta ko tritv kaa naam diya gaya he
 Christianity has tried to explain this doctrine of the Trinity with the help of Greek and Latin philosophical terms - three persons exist in the same divine nature
 teenon tatvat: ek hai
 Hence, all three have the same determination and the same intelligence
 phir bhi pita, putr or pavitra aatma main parsparik bhinnata he
 Father is not born to anyone
 putr adikaal se pita se paripurna ishwartv grahan karata he
 This origin of the son is called fertility
 pavitra aatma kii utpatti ko prajnan kehete hai
 The origin of the Holy Spirit is believed to be from both father and son and is called diffusion
 putr ke prajnan tathaa pavitra aatma se prasaran se teenon vyaktiyon kii parsparik bhinnata utpann hoti he, kintu tatvat: teenon ek hai or samaan rup se sabhi ishwariya gunon se samanvit hai
 
 shatabdiyon tak is dharmasiddhant par chintan kiya gaya he or tatvasambandhi anek dharanaon ko bhraamak tehraaya gaya he
 Trinityism, which assumes three distinct divine elements, is clearly misleading, since the existence of three independent deities is thus acknowledged
 modalism ke anusaar pita, putr or pavitra aatma ek hi ishwar ke teen pahalu hai jo sristi ke kaaran utpann ho jate hai -- pita srishtikarta he, putr hamaara uddhaar karata he tathaa pavitra aatma hamako pavitra karata he
 The church rejected this suit in the third and fourth centuries, stating that before creation, there were three persons in God
 nisea kii vishwasabha ne tritv vishyak un sabhi vyakhyaaon ko bhraamak tehraaya he jinke anusaar putr athwa pavitra aatma pita se gaun maane jate hai
 In that assembly it is clearly declared that father and son are essentially the same

 Rahim has chosen for example in poetry the scripts of texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita and has tried to explain the temporal life behavior aspect by him, which offers a glimpse of Indian culture
 abdurrarahim khaankhaana kaa janm sanwat 1613 i
 main itihaas prasiddh bairam khan ke ghar lahore main hua tha
 Incidentally at that time, Humayun was present with the military in Lahore to resist the invasion of Alexander Suri
 bairam khan ke ghar putr kii utpati kii khabar sunakar ve swayan vahaan gayi or us bachche kaa naam “rahim’ rakhaa
 Rahim's father Bairam Khan was the tantrum and guardian of thirteen-year-old Akbar

 He was the brother-in-law and intimate friend of Humayun

 When Rahim was five years old, his father Bairam Khan was killed in 1561 in Patan Nagar, Gujarat
 rahim kaa paalan-poshan akbar ne apane dharm-putr kii tarah kiya
 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'
 rahim ne baba jambur kii dekh-rekh main gahan adhyayan kiya
 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'
 san 1584 main akbar ne rahim ko khan-e-khaanaa kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim died in 1627 at the age of 71
 rahim ko unki ichha ke anusaar dilli main hi unki patni ke makbare ke paas hi dafna diya gaya
 These mausoleums are still present in Delhi
 rahim ne swayan hi apane jeevankaal main iskaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj
 bairam khan haj ke liye jate hue gujarat ke patan main tehre or patan ke prasiddh sahasraling sarovar main nauka-vihaar ke baad tat par baithe the ki bhent karne kii niyat se ek afgaan sardaar mubarak khan aayaa or dhokhe se bairam khan kii hatya kar di

 Not only did these fraudsters commit murder, but they also caused a lot of looting

 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture
 rahim kii shiksha samaapt hone ke pashchaat samraat akbar ne apane pita humayun kii parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue, rahim kaa vivaah bairam khan ke virdohi mirza ajij coca kii bahan mahabaanon se karvaa diya
 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen

 Emperor Akbar appointed his true and trusted character Amir Rahim as Mustakil Mir Arj to run this post smoothly

 Holding this position meant that the person is generally reliable both in public and the emperor

 praathmik pradooshak ve tatv hai jo sidhe ek prakriya se utsarjit hue hai jaise jwalamukhi visphot se raakh, motor gaadi se carbon mono oxide gas, kaarkaanon se nikalne vaali sulfur dioxide gas
 Secondary pollutants are not directly emitted
 balki jab praathmik pradooshak aapas main kriya yaa pratikriya karte hai jab ve vaayu main banate hai
 An important example of secondary pollutants is ground-level ozone - one of the many secondary pollutants that create photochemical fog
 dhyaan rakhen ki kuch pradooshak praathmik or dwitiyak donon ho sakate hai, yani ve sidhe bhi utsarjit ho sakate hai or anya praathmik pradooshkon se ban sakate hai
 Major primary pollutants arising from human activities include: dwitiyak pradooshkon main shaamil he: Micro air pollutants include: 
 The sources of air pollution indicate the various location, activity, or component that is responsible for the release of pollutants into the atmosphere

 Lohia believed that democracy is not possible without the lingua franca
 1957 se chhedi gayi is muhim main 1962-63 main jansangh bhi shaamil ho gaya
 But due to the demise of Lohia ji, anti-hindi movement in the south, political cravings of politicians, this movement could not succeed

 He said in the Lok Sabha: 1950 main jab bhartiya samvidhan lagu hua tab usamen bhi yah vyavastha di gai thi ki 1965 tak suvidha ke hisaab se angreji kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he lekin uske baad hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja diya jayega

 The ruling rulers introduced the issue of Hindi as an imperialist language and fought the dispute between Hindi and other Indian languages, calling it a threat to national unity and integrity
 ise desh jodak bhashaa nahin, desh todak bhashaa bana diya
 Lohia denied that in the freedom movement, Hindi has worked as a language connecting the country
 desh main ekta sthapit kii he, aage bhi is bhashaa main sambhaavna he
 At the same time, he also said that if Hindi does not want to be the language of government, administration, court-court then it should be replaced by any other Indian language
 jaruri ho to hindi ko bhi shaamil kar liya jaae
 But the dominance of English should not be replaced by the mother tongue of India
 lohia jab 'angareji hataane' kii baat karte hai, to uskaa matlab 'hindi laana' nahin he
 Rather, Lohia has a special understanding behind the slogan of removing English

 On 19 September 1962 in Hyderabad, Lohia said, unke liye swabhaasha raajnneeti kaa mudda nahin balki apane swabhimaan kaa prashn or lakhon–karodon ko hin granthi se ubarkar aatmavishvaas se bhar dene kaa swapn tha– During the anti-hindi agitations of the south, Lohia was agitating against English in the whole of South India and in favor of Hindi and other Indian languages
 hindi ke prati jhukaav kii vajah se durbhaagya se dakshin bharat ke kuch logon ko lohia uttar or brahman samskruti ke pratinidhi ke rup main dikhaai dete the
 In South India, the slogan of 'english Hatao' meant 'lao Hindi'

 It is clear from the "unadayo Bahumam" sutra that their position is not right - somewhere they have a tendency ie there is harmony with Dhatvartha, somewhere inattention means inefficiency, some kind of being somewhere else, sometimes some and sometimes some
 is "bahulam" shabd kii visheshta aacharyon ke shabdon main is prakaar he And the work of Unadi is done as follows- saath hi unadi ke vishleshan kaa niyam bataate hue kaha he- That is, find which metal can be in the noun that comes first, then search for the suffix, then contract it with the idea of the subject of the subject of longing, eligibility - this is the scripture of Unadi

 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 atah bismark ko yah vishwaas ho gaya tha ki germany ke ekikaran ke liye shakti kaa prayog anivaary he
 The main objective of Bismarck was to consolidate Germany under the leadership of Prasha by making Austria powerful from the German Union and ending its influence in Germany
 iske liye aavashyak tha ki rajya kii sabhi satta va adhikaar raja main kendrit hon
 Bismarck believed in monarchy
 atah usne rajtantr ke kendra bindu par hi samast germany kii rashtriyata ko ek sutara main baandhne kaa praytn kiya
 During his entire program, Bismarck took special care not to destroy the pride of Prussia for the unification of Germany
 vah prasha kaa balidaan karne ko taiyaar nahin tha, jaisaa ki peedmont ne italy ke ekikaran ke liye kiya
 He wanted to integrate Germany in the administration itself
 bismark neeche ke str se germany kaa ekikaran nahin chahta tha, arthath udaaravaadi tareeke se janata main ekikaran kii bhaavana jaagrit karne ke badale va vah upar se ekikaran karnaa chahta tha arthath kootneeti evam rakt evam lohe kii nitiyon dwaara vah chahta tha ki german rajyon kii adhinsth sthiti ho, prasha kii nahin

 bismark 1832 main austria kaa chancelar bana or apni kootneeti, sooyeeboojh rakt evam louh kii niti ke dwaara germany kaa ekikaran purna kiya
 After unification in 1870, Bismarck declared that Germany was a contented nation and was not interested in colonial expansion
 is tarah usne germany ke vistaar sambandhi ashankaon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Bismarck had to go through the internal problems of Germany

 There was a huge increase of workers in the factories, but their situation was low there, there was no proper arrangement for their living and eating
 aarthik or saamaajik sthiti kharaab hone ke kaaran samaajwaadiyon kaa prabhaav badhane laga or unhen apana prabal shatru maanata tha
 There were many types of laws throughout Germany
 ekikaran ke dauraan hue yudhon se aarthik sansadhano kii kami ho gayi thi
 As a result, the country's economic progress was being hampered
 bismark ko dharmik samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, the people of Prussia were followers of Protestant religion, while the subjects of other states of Germany were mostly followers of Catholicism
 catholic log bismark ke ekikaran ke prabal virdohi the kyonki unhen bhay tha ki protestant prasha unka daman kar degaa
 German Catholics were angered by Bismarck defeating Austria and France, as both were Catholic countries
 rome se pope kii satta samaapt ho jane se german catholic kurddh ho uthe or unhone bismark kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 For economic unity and development, Bismarck introduced the same type of currency throughout Germany
 yatayaat kii suvidha ke liye railway board kii sthapana kii or usee se telegraph vibhaag ko sambhddha kar diya
 Banks were established on behalf of the state
 vibhinn rajyon main prachlit kanoonon ko sthaagith kar diya gaya or aise kanoonon kaa nirmaan kiya jo sampurna german samrajya main samaan rup se prachlit hue
 To deal with the socialists, Bismarck passed a very stringent Act in 1878 prohibiting the gathering of socialists
 unke pramukh netaaon ko jail main daal diya gaya
 Newspapers and literature were strictly banned
 in damankaaree upayon ke saath-saath bismark ne mazdooron ko samaajwaadiyon se dur karne ke liye "rajya-samaajwaad" kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 Under this, he showed to the workers that the state itself is striving for the welfare of the workers
 usanke mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liye anek beemaa yojanaayen, pension yojanaayen lagu kii
 Working hours of women and children were fixed
 bismark kaa yah 'rajya samaajwaad' vaastavik samaajwaad nahin tha, kyonki vah janatantr kaa virdohi tha or poonjeevaad kaa samarthan tha
 Bismarck patronized German industries for industrial advancement, which increased industries and production
 taiyaar maal ko bechney ke liye nai mandiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 This need prompted Bismarck's adoption of colonial policy
 faltah 1884 i
 main bismark ne africa ke purvi ore dakshini-pashchimi bhaagon main anek vyapaarik chaukiyon kii sthapana kii or teen samraaton ke sangh se baahar ho gaya
 He said that Bismarck lost a friend by favoring one friend

 5 Russia's disappearance from Germany became a matter of concern for Bismarck
 use laga ki kahin rus france ke saath koi maitri sandhi na kar le
 Therefore, he immediately tried to improve relations with Russia
 1881 main use safalataa bhi mili
 Now there was a treaty between Germany, Russia and Austria
 5 ab bismark ne italy kii ore dhyaan diya or italy se sandhi kar france ko europea raajnneeti main bilkul alag kar dena chaha
 At the same time, both France and Italy were keen on seizing Tunis in Africa
 bismark ne france ko tunis par adhikaar karne ke liye protsaahit kiya taaki france main germany ke paksh main sadbhaavna fail jaae or france samrajyavad main ulajhaa jaae, jisase germany se badla lene kii baat dur ho jaae
 France took over Tunis in 1881, which angered Italy
 italy kii naaraazgi kaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne 1882 main italy, germany or austria ke bich trigut sandhi ko anjaam diya
 Bismarck gave birth to a new 'treaty system'
 sandhi kar usne vibhinn guton kaa nirmaan kiya
 The feature of this treaty system was that generally all the treaties that have happened in history took place during the war
 kintu bismark ne shaantikaal main sandhi pranali ko janm dekar ek naveen drushtikon saamne rakhaa
 Union of the Three Emperors: Bismarck was the first step under the treaty system in the field of foreign policy
 1872 main teen samraaton ke sangh kaa nirmaan kiya isamen austria kaa samraat francis joseph, rus kaa jaar dwitiya tathaa germany kaa samraat willian pratham shaamil tha
 Although it was not a written treaty between these three countries, some things were agreed upon
 ve is baat par sahamat hue the ki europe main shaanti banaae rakhane tathaa samaajawaadee aandolan se nipatane ke liye ve ek-duusare ke saath sahyog evam vichaar vinimay karte rahe
 This treaty was Bismarck's great diplomatic victory, because on the one hand he befriended the defeated power of Sedova, Austria and on the other hand, ended the possibility of friendship of Austria and Russia for France
 kintu kuch samay pashchaat yah sangh tut gaya kyonki balcon kshetra main rus or austria ke hit aapas takaraate the
 Therefore, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria
 1878 kii berlin kii sandhi main bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha, jisamen usne austria kaa paksh liya
 As a result, Russia became angry with him
 dharmik muddon se nitapane or rajya ko sarvopari banane ke liye bismark ne carch ke viruddh kai kanoon paas kiye
 In 1872, the Jesuits were boycotted and Prasha and the Pope broke up
 1873 main paarit kanoon ke anusaar vivaah rajya nyaayalayon kii ajna se hone laga jisamen carch kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin rah gayi
 The state got the authority over the educational institutions and the government assistance to the church was discontinued
 in kanoonon ke baavjood bhi catholic jhuke nahin
 Therefore, Bismarck considered the challenges of the Socialists more dangerous and compromised with the Catholics
 iske tahat catholic ke viruddh kanoon radd kar die gaye or pope se raajnneetik sambandh sthapit kiya
 After the reunification of Germany, the main objective of Bismarck's foreign policy in 1871 was to maintain Germany's dominance in Europe
 niti nirdhaaran ke taur par usne ghoshit kiya ki germany tusht rajya he or kshetreey vistaar main isaki koi ruchi nahin he
 Bismarck was most feared by France because he had obtained the territory of elsse-laurent from France, which made France very dissatisfied
 bismark ko vishwaas tha ki francisi apni 1870-71 kii paraajay or alses-lauren kshetra ko nahin bhuulenge
 Therefore, the main objective of his foreign policy was to keep France friendless in Europe so that it would not be in a position to fight Germany
 is tarah bismark kii videsh niti ke aadharbhoot siddhanth the- vyaavhaarik avasarwaadi kootneeti kaa prayog kar german virdohi shaktiyon ko alag-thalag rakhana evam france ko mitra viheen bananaa, udaarvaad kaa virodh evam sanyavad main aasthaa rakhana
 His treaty system gave rise to rivalries
 faltah europe main tanaavpurn vaataavaran ban gaya or is prakaar europe pratham vishwayuddh ke kagaar par pahunch gaya
 Bismarck's foreign policy encouraged militarization and armament in Europe
 is niti ne europe ko pratham vishwayuddh kii dahalij tak pahunchaa diya
 Bismarck signed all treaties with conflicting nations
 unke bich samanvay banaae rakhana atyant dushkar kaary tha, jise keval bismark jaisaa kootneetijna hi kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, after the resignation of the post in 1890, this method became fatal and groups like France, Russia etc
 were formed against Germany
 is prakaar bismark kii videsh niti ne prakarantar se pratham vishwayuddh kii prishthbhumi kaa nirmaan kar diya
 Bismarck's policy of factionalism led to the formation of a second bloc against Germany and eventually Europe was divided into two armed and powerful factions
 jisaki charam parinti pratham vishwayuddh main dikhaai padi
 In 1887, Bismarck signed a resettlement treaty with Russia, under which the two pledged to support each other
 yah sandhi gupt rakhi gai thi
 This was Bismarck's diplomatic victory as Germany simultaneously enjoyed the friendship of Russia and Austria
 bismark ne britain ke saath maitreepurn sambandh banane kaa praytn kiya
 Bismarck believed that Britain was a naval power and would not be hostile to any nation until its navy was challenged
 atah britain ko khush karne liye bismark ne german nausena ko badhaane ko koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 To please Britain, he declared that Germany was not an imperialist country
 duusari taraf england kii france ke saath aupniveshik pratidwandita thi jiskaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne britain ke saath madhur sambandh banaae

 Mahavidya is the ten forms of Goddess Durga, which is worshiped by most tantric seekers, but is also an incredible accomplishment to ordinary devotees
 inhen das mahavidhya ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The development of Mahavidya thought created a new chapter in the history of Shaktism, which nurtured the belief that all-powerful is a woman
 mahavidhya shabd sanskrit bhashaa ke shabdon "maha" tathaa "vidya" se bana he- "maha" arthath mahan, vishaal, viraat ; tathaa "vidya" arthath gyaan
 According to the Shakta devotees "there is an explanation of a truth contained in the ten forms - Mahavidya" which explains the ten cosmic personalities of Jagadamba
 mahavidhyaayein tantrik prakruti kii maani jaati hai jo nimna hai- Shakta Darshan associates ten Mahavidyas with the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu and explains that Mahavidyas are the sources from which the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu originated
 mahavidhyaon ke ye dason rup chaahe ve bhayanak hon athwa saumy, jagajjanani ke rup main puuje jate hai
 According to Sri Devi Bhagwat Purana, the Mahavidyas originated due to a dispute between Lord Shiva and his consort Sati, who was the former birth of Parvati
 jab shiv or sati kaa vivaah hua to sati ke pita daksh prajapati donon ke vivaah se khush nahin the
 He organized a huge yagna for the purpose of insulting Shiva, in which he invited all the gods and goddesses, but in spite of this he did not invite his son, Lord Shankar and his daughter Sati
 sati, pita ke dwaara yojit yajna main jane kii jid karne lageen jise shiv ne ansuna kar diya, is par sati ne swayan ko ek bhayanak rup main parivartit kar liya
 Seeing which Lord Shiva was determined to run away
 apane pati ko daraa hua jaanakar mata sati unhen rokane lageen to shiv jis disha main gayi us disha main maan kaa ek anya vigrah prakat hokar unhen roktaa he
 In this way, in ten directions, the mother had taken ten forms, she was called Ten Mahavidyas

 kushtarog yaa hansen kaa rog , chikitsak gerhard armor hansen ke naam par, micobacterium lepri or micobacterium leprometosis jeevanuon ke kaaran hone vaali ek dirghakaalik beemaari he
 Leprosy is primarily a granuloma-related disease of the mucous and external nerves of the upper respiratory tract; Skin lesions are its primary external sign
 yadi ise anupachaarit chhod diya jaae, to kushtarog bad saktaa he, jisase twachaa, nason, haath-pairon or ankhon main sthaayee kshati ho sakati he
 Unlike folklore, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall apart, although they can become numb and / or sick due to the disease
 kushtarog ne 4,000 se bhi adhik varshon se maanavtaa ko prabhavit kiya he, or pracheen china, misr or bharat kii sabhyataaon main ise bahut acchhee tarah pahachaanaa gaya he
 DNA taken from the remains of a shroud wrapped in the shroud of a man discovered in a mausoleum outside the city of Old Jerusalem shows that he is the first man to have confirmed leprosy
 1995 main, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anumaan ke anusaar kushtarog ke kaaran sthaayee rup se viklang ho chuke vyaktiyon kii sankhya 2 se 3 million ke bich thi
 In the last 20 years, 15 million people worldwide have been freed from leprosy
 haalanki, jahaan paryaapt upachaar uplabdh hai, un sthanon main marijon kaa balpurvak sangrodh yaa pruthakkaran karnaa anaavashyak he, lekin iske baavjood abhi bhi puure vishwa main bharat, china, romania, misr, nepal, somalia, liberia, vietnam or japan jaise deshon main kusht-bastiyaan maujuud hai
 There was a time when leprosy was thought to be highly contagious and sexually transmitted and treated by mercury — all of which the notion applied to syphilis, first described in 1530
 ab aisa mana jaataa he ki kushtarog ke shuruaati maamalon se anek sambhawatah syphilis ke maamle rahe honge
 ab yah gyaat ho chukaa he ki kushtarog na to yon-sampark ke dwaara sancharit hota he or na hi upachaar ke baad yah atyadhik sankramak he kyonki lagbhag 95% log prakritik rup se pratirakshit hote hai or isse peedit log bhi upachaar ke maatr 2 saptaah baad hi sankramak nahin rah jate
 The age-old social stigma associated with advanced forms of leprosy, in other words the stigma of leprosy, is still present in many areas and still remains a major obstacle towards self-information and early treatment
 1930 ke dashak ke ant main dapson or iske vyutpannon kii prastuti ke saath hi kushtarog ke liye prabhavi upachaar praapt hua

 Although annual expansion as a measure of transmission — the number of new cases of leprosy received annually — is important, leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, late diagnosis and early stages of the disease
 Leprosy is difficult to measure due to lack of laboratory equipment to be able to do this

 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 The reason for this annual identification number exceeding its prevalence at the end of that year can be explained by the fact that a part of new cases completed their treatment within a year and hence they are no longer on the register
 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

 Whenever there is talk of first revolution against the British in slave India in India, the picture of 1857 or so around in our mind starts to emerge but very few people will know that 58 years from 1857
 First in 1799, Nawab Wazir Ali Khan raised the flag of revolt against the British from Benares itself

 This rebellion began from 21 January 1799, when the British accused Nawab Wazir Ali Khan, the adopted son of Nawab asaf-ud-daula, of cheating and removed him from the throne and sent him to Benares
 vajeer ali ke jagah par unke chachaa saadat ali khan ko avadh kaa aglaa nawab chunaa gaya or vajeer ali ko ramnagar main najarband kar diya gaya

 baagiyon ne commander cheri,captain kanave,robert graham ,captain greg ivance sahit saat angrej sipaahiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya

 Davis hides his wife, children and two servants on the roof and comes out himself to fight the rebels

 The news of the British rebellion spread like fire and the British army reached Nadesar to save the magistrate
 haalaanki phir baagiyon ko peeche hatana padaa or in vakton main nawab ke saath or bhi hajaaron baagi jud gaye
 To crush the rebellion of the Nawab, General Arskin from Kolkata had to come to Benares with an army
 arsakin ke baari fuj ke aage baagi tik nahin paae
 Hundreds of people were killed, seeing no way to escape, they all planned to leave from there with mutual consent
 Wazir Ali also reached Butwal, Rajasthan to save his life
 tab jaipur ke tatkaaleen angrej parast raja ne unhipane yahan thaharne kii daavat di
 He betrayed the Nawab and handed over Wazir Ali to the British in 1799
 angrejon ne vajeer ali ko kolkata ke fort wiliam jail bhej diya
 The Nawab died in prison in 1817 after spending 17 years in prison

 ustad ali akbar khan jane-maane sarod vadak evam hindustani shastreey sangeet ke sadhak the
 Ustad Ali Akbar Khan was awarded the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan and for the last five decades he held the flag of Indian classical music in the world
 bhartiya shastreey sangeet ko pashchim main pratishthit karne ke kshetra main unka mahaan yogadan tha
 Ali Akbar Khan was born on 14 April 1922 in Shivpur village of Komila in East Bengal, undivided India, now in Bangladesh
 unhone shastreey gayikee or shastreey sangeet kii shiksha teen saal kii umr main apane pita baba allaudin khan se leni shuru kii thi
 He was also a protégé of his uncle Fakir Aftabuddin
 ali akbar khan ke pita ne unhen kai vaadyayantron main nipun banaaya
 But eventually he decided to focus on Sarod playing
 13 saal kii umr main unhone pehla saarvajanik kaarykram elahabaad main pesh kiya tha or lakhanu main unki pehali gramophone ricarding kii gai thi
 In 1956, Ali Akbar Khan established the 'ali Akbar Khan Music College' in Kolkata and made it his mission to teach and spread classical music in India and abroad
 khan sahab ne teen baar shaadi kii thi or unke 11 bete-betiyaan hai
 His son Ashish Khan is a famous sarod player
 tarayukt vaadya yantron main maharath rakhane vaale 88 varshiya ustad ali akbar khan ne hindustani shastreey sangeet ke liye amar rachanaaon kaa srijan kiya
 He was permanently residing in San Francisco, USA
 ustad allaudin khan ke is bete ko vaayalin vadak ehudi menuin ne ek dfa "duniya kaa mahaan sangeetkaar" kaha tha
 He was the first Indian classical seeker to give a long program of classical music in America and play sarod on American TV
 unke kareebi pan charanjit chaturlal ne unhen sant bataate hue kaha tha ki ustad jaise shastreey sangeet ke sadhak sadiyon main ek baar aate hai
 He said that his father and Guru Baba Alauddin Khan used to say that Ali Akbar Khan was born only for Sarod
 ekal kaaryakramon ke alaava bharat main apane gurubhai ravishankar or pashchim main yahudee menuin yaa jon handi jaise kalakaaron ke saath unki yugalabandi kaafii mashhoor he
 Ali Akbar Khan Sahab was conferred with the Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan awards by the Government of India
 iske alaava 1970 se 1998 ke bich unhen paanch baar grami puraskaar ke liye manonith kiya gaya tha
 Khan was the first classical musician to be awarded a Fellowship of the macarthur Foundation in 1991
 khan gremi award to nahin paa sake lekin 1970 se 1998 ke bich paanch dfa unka is pratishthit award ke liye namakan kiya gaya tha
 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reasons for this are the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material exceeds the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods
 parin ne mastic gond ke kalil par pariksha karke aavogadro niyatank kaa maan 6
510E23 nikaala he
 The radius of the appropriate mastic glue particles in the experiment was 6
5 x 10–4
 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method
 swarnakalil ko gelatin kii sookshm maatra se avakshipt kiya ja saktaa he kintu is protein kii adhik maatra is kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 According to Jigmondi, the gold content of a black preservative is the number of milligrams of the preservative in the presence of 10 cubic centimeters of gold in the presence of 1 cubic cm of sodium chloride
 Can be precipitated by a solution whose concentration is 10 percent
 kalil kaa sangrakshan vishesh mahatv rakhata he or atyant pracheen samay se iskaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 It has already been said that there is charge on the black particles
 kalil par aavesh kaa prakaar gyaat karne ke liye saral avasorana prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Positive compounds are absorbed by silica jelly and negative compounds by aluminum hydroxide
 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide
 kalileey tal par aavesh kii maatra or vibhav dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran dwaara parimapit kiye jate hai
 Saul is filled in a tube containing two platinum electrodes
 ab saul main disht vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaati he
 If the particles move towards the positive, there is a negative electric charge on them
 vidyut kshetra main kanon kii is prakaar kii gati dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran kehalaati he
 This speed can be conveniently measured by suitable optical methods
 veg ke maapan dwaara vidyudvibhav kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 This voltage is commonly called electrical-dynamic-voltage
 yah vidyutagtyatmk vibhav us samay bhi dekha jaataa he jab vidyudvishleshiya vilyan ko kisi sanrdhra tanupat se hokar bheja jaataa he
 Research has also been conducted on two other related verbs
 ye hai dharavibhav or avakshepan vibhav
 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
 is prakaar saadhaarant: saulon kii rasakarshan daab kam hi hoti he or jab rasakarshan daab adhik ho jaati he to vah mukhyat: ashuddhiyon ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Measuring pressure is measured with the help of a semipermeable membrane
 vidyudvishleshan ke asmaan vitaran se kuch kalilon main dononsantulan naamak kriya ke kaaran jatilta utpann hoti he
 The study of this balancing act has been studied on dyes, soaps, and many other collicular electrodynamics called Congo Red
 in sthitiyon main kalileey padaarth vidyudvishleshya ke samaan vyavhaar karata he
 When the shape of an ion is similar to the shape of the calculus, when the potential is created on both sides of the dilute, which is called the dilute potential
 kai protein saulon main tanupat-vibhav sadaiv hi utpann ho jaataa he or jivit selon par aavesh is tanupat santulan ke kaaran hi hota he
 The shape or form of the calculus cannot be seen by looking through a microscope
 phir bhi kalilkanon kii sankhya gini ja sakati he; tab vitarit padaarth ke purna aaytan ke maan se ek kan kaa ausat aaytan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But when a Saul is made, then many particles of particles are present in it
 kalilkanon kaa rup golakaar, dandakaar, dirghavrittakar yaa paratdaar ho saktaa he
 Several methods have been developed to find the form of Kalilakanas which are based on optical properties
 in kalilon kii visheshta he vitaran madhyam kii shyanta par prabhaav daalana
 Viscosity increases mostly and increases with the increase in volume of the delivered material
 ek vishesh sandran ke pahunchne par shyanta itani bad jaati he ki kalil jelly kaa rup grahan kar letaa he
 Jelly can also be obtained from precipitation of Saul
 jelly kaa upyog simit sa he or gelatin, aighar aighar, starch aadi ke saulon ko sheethal karke jo ardhapardarshak jeliyaan banaai jaati hai unhen hi jelly kii sangya di jaati he
 Most waterfowl cultivars make jelly upon cooling or heating
 kai acarbonic jalasantrasi kalil bhi vishesh paristhitiyon main jelly ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In this way, many aqueous hydroxides, insoluble phosphates, molybdates gels are made in the laboratory
 jelly saadhaarant: taralamochan kaa gun pradarshit karti he
 The jelly shrinks and cracks when kept for a long time, and the water tied in the jelly comes out
 jeliyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: pratyasth tathaa drudh
 Elastic gels are usually made from natural clays such as gelatin, agar, but most inorganic gels, which also contain silicic acid, show strong behavior
 kuch jeliyon kaa swabhaav vicitra hota he
 They are converted back into shawl when shaken, agitated, or by the effect of transcendental waves
 kintu yadi ab unhen sthir rakh diya jaae to ve phir jelly ban jaati hai
 This action can be repeated many times
 is kriya ko sparshabodh kehete hai
 Special discoveries have been made on the solutes of proteins in water-loving plants
 iskaa kaaran he inkaa shareerik rasayan shaastra main mahatv
 Proteins found in natural state are generally negatively charged
 adhikansh saul amleey banaae jane par dhanatmak aavesh praapt kar lete hai
 Thus at a particular ph there will be no charge on the solute of the protein
 ise samavidyut vindu kehete hai
 This leads to identification of proteins
 rasinic gunon main pracheen ubhaydharmee hota he kyonki isamen or bonon samooh rahete hai
 Due to this property, the protein acts as a buffer
 jantuon ke jivan main is gun kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Proteins have the ability to provide stability to the hydrological plants and their golden number helps in the diagnosis of many diseases
 kalilon ke samast upyogon kii gananaa sambhav nahin
 Most biological fluids, such as blood, etc
, are by nature
 calcium-sabun ke rup main calcium, swarna, louh, vang, manganeez, rajat ityadi dhaatuen, yaa unke aviley yogic, kalil ke rup main oshadhiyon main prayukt hote hai
 The dietary science has to consider the Kallikas
 humas or chikani mitti ke kalileey gun bhoomi kii urvartaa or uske bhautik gunon par vishesh prabhaav daalate hai
 Fibers are organic and the textile industry is also the industrial industry
 chheent ke nirmaan main prayukt honevaale rang or chapai kalileey gunon ke kaaran hi sampann hoti he
 In some reactants, the manufacture of synthetic silk is based on the scaly properties of the cellulosic material
 sabun or apkshaalak kalileey padaarth hai or anek vastu-samooh, yatha chikaanewaale padaarth, plastic, rabar, snehak padaarth, tel rang ityadi main kalileey gun paae jate hai
 The glass, clay and cement industries are particularly associated with the sciences
 hamaare adhikansh aahaar, jaise proteinein, starch ke rup main carbohydrate vasa aadi bhi gun main kalileey hai
