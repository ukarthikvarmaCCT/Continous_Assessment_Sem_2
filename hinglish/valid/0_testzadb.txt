 Kambuj or Cambose is the ancient Sanskrit name of Cambodia

 For nearly 600 years, Funan contributed significantly in promoting and propagating Hindu culture in this region

 The remains of this ancient splendor are still present today in places called Angkorvat, Angkorthom
 kamboj kii pracheen dantakthaon ke anusaar is upnivesh kii neenv 'aryadesh' ke raja kambu swayambhuv ne daali thi
 He came to the country of Kambose under the inspiration of Lord Shiva and with the help of the king of the Naga caste settled here, he established a new kingdom in this wild desert which culminated in the lush, beautiful region with the wonderful magic of Nagraj
 kambu ne nagaraj kii kanya meraa se vivaah kar liya or kambuj rajvansh kii neenv daali
 It is also possible that this colony located in Indochina was also related to Indian Kamboj
 teesri shatee i
 main bharat kii uttar-pashchimi seemaa par basanevo murundon kaa ek rajdoot phunaan pahunchaa tha or sambhavat: kamboj ke ghode apane saath vahaan laayaa tha
 The founder of the first historical dynasty of Kamboj was Shrutavarman who liberated the country of Kamboj from Funan
 iske putr shreshthavarman ne apane naam par shreshthpur naamak rajdhani basaai jiske khandhar laos ke watfu pahari ke paas sthit hai
 Thereafter, Bhavavarman, who belonged to both the Funan and Kambose dynasties, started a new dynasty and settled the capital named Bhavpur in his own name
 bhavavarman tathaa iske bhai mahendravarman ke samay se kamboj kaa vikasyug prarambh hota he
 The old kingdom of Funan was now dilapidated and soon merged into this new turbulent empire
 mahendravarman kii mrityu ke pashchaat unka putr ishanvarman gaddi par baitha
 This majestic king extended the boundaries of the kingdom of Kamboj far and wide
 usne bharat or champa ke saath rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye or ishanpur naam kii ek nai rajdhani kaa nirmaan kiya
 Ishaanavarman married his daughter to Jagadharma, the king of Champa, whose son Prakashadharma became king of Champa after the death of his father
 isse prathit hota he ki champa is samay kamboj ke raajnneetik prabhaav ke antargat tha
 After Ishanavarman, the names of the kambhoj kings are found in Bhavavarman II and Jayavarman I
 jayavarman ke pashchaat 674 i
 main is rajvansh kaa ant ho gaya
 Shortly after, the power of Kamboj began to wane and gradually in the 8th century AD, the Kamboj dominance of the Shalendra kings of Java was established over the country
 8veen sadi i
 kaa kamboj itihaas adhik spasht nahin he kintu 9veen sadi kaa aarambh hote hi is pracheen samrajya kii shakti maanon pun: jivit ho uthi
 The credit for this is given to Jayavarman II

 He probably called Hiranyadas from India and performed tantric activities for the protection of his kingdom
 is vidvan brahman ne devraj naamak sampradaay kii sthapana kii jo sheeghra hi kamboj kaa rajdharm ban gaya
 Jayavarman made his capital in the cities of Kuti, Hariharalaya and Amarendrapur respectively, making it clear that almost all of the territory of present-day Cambodia was under him and the center of the power of the state gradually moved from east to west and finally the territory of Angkor
 Was established in jayavarman dwitiya ko apane samay main kambujrajendra or uski mahraani ko kambujrajalakshmi naam se abhihit kiya jaataa tha
 From this time, foreign authors of Cambodia's ancient name Kambuj or Kambhoj also started using it

 main kamboj kaa raja rajendravarman tha jiske samay ke kai brihad abhilekh sundar sanskrit kavyastylee main likhe milte hai
 The period up to 1001 AD is significant in the history of Kamboj because during this period the borders of Kamboj touched the southern part of China, Laos was under it and its political influence extended to Syria and northern Malaya
 suryavarman pratham ne praaia: samast syam par kamboj kaa aadhipaty sthapit kar diya or dakshin brahmadesh par bhi akraman kiya
 He was a scholar of literature, justice and grammar and, despite being a Buddhist himself, was a lover and protector of Shaivite and Vaishnava religions
 usne rajacin hone ke samay desh main chale hue grihayuddh ko samaapt kar rajya kii sthiti ko pun: sudrudh karne kaa praytn kiya
 After conquering North Champa, Suryavarman made him a proud kingdom of Kamboj but soon had to give up to King Jaihari Varmana of South Champa
 is samay kamboj main grihayudhon or padosi deshon ke saath anban ke kaaran kaaphi ashaanti rahi
 Once again during the reign of Jayavarman VII, the ancient fame of Kamboj began to unfurl
 usne ek vishaal sena banaai jisamen syam or brahmadesh ke sainik bhi sammilit the
 Jayavarman also tried to conquer Anam by invading him, but due to the constant wars, the military power of the Shani Kambos began to decline, even in 1220 AD, the Kambos had to withdraw from Champa
 kintu phir bhi jayavarman saptam kii gananaa kamboj ke mahan rajyanirmaataaon main kii jaati he kyonk usame samay main kamboj ke samrajya kaa vistaar apnicharam seemaa par pahunchaa hua tha
 Jayavarman VII built his new capital at present Angkorthom
 iske khandhar aaj bhi sansar ke prasiddh pracheen avasheshon main gine jate hai
 The city had a high tower and a 110-meter-wide facade
 isaki lambaai saadhe aath mile ke lagbhag thi
 There were five lion gates of the city park, from which five huge Rajpaths used to go inside the city
 ye rajpath, beyon ke virat hindu mandir ke paas milte the, jo nagar ke madhya main sthit tha
 There were 66,625 persons employed in the temple and 3,400 villages had an income for its expenditure
 is samay ke ek abhilekh se gyaat hota he ki kamboj main 789 mandir tathaa 102 chikitsaalay the or 121 vaahni grih the
 After Jayavarman VII, many sites in the history of Kamboj are not very clear
 13veen sadi main kamboj main sudrudh raajnneetik shakti kaa abhaav tha
 According to some historians, Kamboj refused to assume the suzerainty of the Emperor Kuble Khan of China in the last phase of the 13th century

 In the 14th century, new political power was emerging in the neighboring kingdoms of Kamboj and the Thai people of Siamese and Champa were constantly trying to move towards Kamboj
 parinaam yah hua ki kamboj par do ore se baari dabaav padane laga or vah in donon deshon kii chakki ke paaton ke bich pisane laga
 Gradually, the ancient importance of Kamboj was gone and now this country became an ordinary backward state of Indochina

 In the war between Siamese and the French in 1904–41, some of the territory of Cambodia was given to Syam, but after the Second World War, in 1945 AD this part was regained
 is samay cambodia main swatantraaa andolan bhi chal rahaa tha jiske parinamswaroop france ne cambodia ko ek nayaa samvidhan pradaan kiya 
 But this did not satisfy the nationalists there and they forced the French to sign a new samanate in 1949, which allowed them to accept Cambodia's independent political power, but still kept the country under the French Union i went

 With their efforts, Cambodia soon became an independent nation and was elected the first Prime Minister of its country
 kamboj vaastavik arth main bhartiya upnivesh tha
 The religion of the residents there, their culture and civilization, literary traditions, architecture and language - all had an indelible mark of Indianness, whose philosophy is still spontaneous to the audience of Cambos

 For example, only a portion of a huge inscription of Rajendravarman is presented here in which Shiva is worshiped: puraane arab paryatakon ne kamboj ko hindu desh ke naam se thik hi abhihit kiya
 The official language of Kambuj was Sanskrit in ancient times, it was gradually replaced by Pali due to the propagation of Buddhism and even today it remains the main language in the religious region

 Rumor has been raised that the company is trying its best to not even count its stock prices by an inch
 maukey ki samaj rakhte hue, ek bear cartil jo ki kalakatta ke stock brokaron kaa samooh tha ne reliance ke sheyaron ki khudara bikri shuru kar di
 To prevent this, a group of stock brokers, until recently referred to as "friends of Reliance", started buying short-selling shares of Reliance Industries from the Bombay Stock Exchange
 bear cartil is vishwaas par kaary kar rahe the ki bulls lenden ko pura karne ke liye nakadi se kam honge
 And will be ready for agreement under the "badla" trading system that was in force at the Bombay Stock Exchange at that time

 lenden ko pura karne ke liye, ati aavashyak nakadi ko stock brokaron ko diya gaya, jinhonen kisi or se nahin balki dhirubhai ambani reliance ke shares khride the
 In case of no compromise, the Bulls demanded an "uncalled for" of Rs 35 per share

 The agreement created a stir in the market and Dhirubhai Ambani became the undisputed emperor of the stock market

 The situation was spiraling out of control
 is sthiti kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye, bombai stock exange ko teen vyavsaayik dinon tak band kar diya gaya
 The officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange intervened in this matter and brought 'ambdala' down to Rs 2, deciding that the beer cartel would have to provide shares in the coming days
 The beer cartel bought Reliance shares from the market at high prices and also came to know that Dhirubhai Ambani himself provided these shares to the beer cartel and made a good profit / healthy profit from the risk of the beer cartel

 The legend of Chidambaram begins with the legend of Lord Shiva wandering in Thillai Vanam, a species of Vayushif trees - presently found in the humid region of Pichavaram near Chidambaram
 mandir kii pratimaaon main un thilaai vrikshon kaa chithran he jo duusari shatabdi sei ke kaal ke hai)
 a group of sadhus or 'sages' lived in the forests of Thillai who believed in the power of Tilism and believed that the deity could be subdued by rites and 'mantras' or magical words

 Chitrakootam was sung by Kulasekara Alwar and Tirimangai Mannan Alwar
 donon alwaron ne kaha he ki chidambaram brahman hi vah brahman hai jo chitrakootem main bhagwaan kii vaidic evam uchit puja kar rahe the
 However, there are many controversies in this regard, as many believe that the Chitrakootam that Alwar people are pointing to may be the Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh where Rama spent time in the ashram of sages like Vishwamitra and Atri

 The symbolism behind the structure of a Shiva temple chidambaram mandir or uske pratik Saint Thirumoolar, whose legend is intricately linked to Chidambaram, says in his work Thirumanthiram திருமந்திரம் When written in the Hindi vocabulary, these words express the following: "arth: "shivlinga maanav sharir kaa ek rup he; isi prakaar chidambaram bhi, isi prakaar sadasivan bhi or unka pavitra nrity bhi"
 Symbols of Nataraja Swamy chidambaram main bhagwaan shiv ke niraakaar swarup kii puja kii jaati he

 Most of the temples in the south are 'living' samadhis, that is to say, these are places where prayers are offered from the very beginning, are regularly visited by devotees and are also regularly looked after
 puraanon main yah ullekh he ki sant pulikaalamuniver ne raja simmavarman ke madhyam se mandir ke anekon kaaryon ko nirdeshit kiya
 Among the Pallava kings, there were three kings named Simmavarman
 Since the temple was already famous during the time of the poet-saint Thirunavukkarasar, it is more likely that Simmavarman was in the period 430–458, ie Simmavarman II
 Pattayam or proclamations made on copper letters in Kottra Vankudi prove this
 haalanki, thandanthotta pattayam or pallav kaal ke anya pattayam is or sanket karte hai ki simmavarman kaa chidambaram mandir se sambandh tha
 Hence it is believed that Simmavarman was the prince of the Pallava dynasty who had renounced royal rights and came to live in Chidambaram
 chunki aisa paaya gaya he ki pulikaal muniver or simmavarman samakaleen the, isliye yah mana jaataa he ki mandir isi kaal ke dauraan nirmit hua tha
 However, the fact that saint-poet Manikavyasagar lived in Chidambaram and found supernatural knowledge, but his period is much earlier than that of saint-poet Thirunavukkarasar and did not compare Lord Nataraja and his unique posture and presentation to other works of the Pallava dynasty
 Because it is very superior, it is possible that the temple existed since the time of Simmavarman and no Pulikalamunivara in later times The Saints may have been
 samayik antaraalon par bade str par marammat or navinikaran kaary karaaye jate hai, nayi suvidhaayen jodi or pratishthit kii jaati hai
 Most of the ancient temples have also been 'developed' over time and by new facilities, the rulers who patronized the temple, their gates and more outer corridors and gopurams were built
 yadhyapi is prakriya ne puja sthalon ke rup main mandiron ke astitv ko bane rahane main sahaayta kii, kintu ek purna puratathvik yaa aitihaasik drushti se in navinikarnon ne bina manshaa ke hi amndir ke mul vavastavik kaaryon ko nasht kar diya - jo baad kii bhavy mandir yojanaon se samanta nahin rakhte the
 The Chidambaram temple is also no exception to this common practice
 atah mandir kii utpatti or vikaas kaaphi had tak saahitiyik or kaavyatmak kaaryon ke sambandhit sandarbh dwaara nishkarshith he, maukhik jaankario deekshitar samudaay dwaara or ab shesh rah gayi atyant alp pandulipiyon va shilalekhon ke madhyam se peedi dar peedi hastantarit hoti gayi
 Through Sangam literature we know that the rulers of the Chola dynasty were great devotees of this ancient religious site
 chol raja kochengannan ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki unka janm raja subhadevan or kamaladevi ke baad hua tha, jinaki thilaai swarna haul main puja kii jaati he
 Therefore, it is likely that this temple including the Golden Hall has existed since thousands of years ago
 mandir kii vaastukala - visheshkar pavitra garbh grih kii vaastukala chol vansh, pande vansh yaa pallav vansh ke anya kisi bhi mandir kii vaastukala se mail bhi nahin karti he
 To a extent, this form of temple has certain similarities that correspond to the temple forms of the Chera dynasty, but the earliest known reference to the Chera dynasty is of the era of the poet-saint Sundarar
 durbhagyavash chidambaram mandir yaa isse sambandhit kaary ke uplabdh pramaan 10 veen shatabdi or uske baad ke hai
 Several inscriptions related to the Chidambaram temple are available in the surrounding areas and also in the temple itself
 adhikansh uplabdh shilaalekh nimna kaalon se sambandhit hai: Dakshin Gopuram was built by King Pandya
 iskaa pramaan pandya rajvansh ke machhlee ke pratik dwaara miltaa he jo chat pat gadha gaya he
 Historically, it is believed that on completion of the construction of Gopiram, the Pandya dynasty had built two fish in front of each other
 The South Gopuram has a two-fish insignia of the Pandya dynasty

 Western Gopuram was built by Jadavavarman Sundar Pandyan i 1251-1268

 The Eastern Gopuram was first built by the Pallava king Koperunsingan II 1243-1279

 It is said that the golden roof of the Chitasabha was put up by the Chola king Parantaka I
 raja parantka II, rajraja chol I, kulothunga chol i ne mandir ke nimitt mahatvapurn daan kiya
 Rajaraja Chola's daughter Kundavai II is also known for donating gold and wealth to the temple
 baad main chol raja vikram chol ne bhi dainik sanskaron ke karne ke liye mandir ko kaaphi daan diya
 Gold and jewelery were donated to the temple by many kings, rulers and patrons - including Sheri Sethupathi, Maharaja of Pudukottai, British etc
 uttari bharat ke anekon mandir jin par anekon videshi akramanakariyon ne hamale kiye the, unke vipareet dakshin bharat ke mandiron kaa astitv kai yugon se shantipurna rahaa he
 This is often the reason behind the flourishing of temples in South India
 haalanki, yah shantipurna itihaas bhi halaki fulki muthbhedon se achoota nahin rahaa he
 An incident when the temple's Dixitar community received 1597 CE
 There is some historical evidence in connection with the problem of forcible expansion of the Govindaraja temple by the commander of the Vijayanagara Empire

 The incident is recorded by a traveler, the Jesuit Dharmacharya Pimenta

 beesvin shatabdi ke bich me achche vishvavidhyalayon me bhautik shaastra ko padhaaye jane ke tareeke par vivaad chal rahaa tha
 This dispute could be carried out by the same person as the finemen, because their status was considered by all
 unka sammaan isaliye nahin tha ki vah cyle tech me the par cyle tech duniya kaa sabase achachhaa bhautik shaastra kaa vishvavidhyalay isaliye mana jaataa tha kyonki finemen vahaan the
 Finemen taught physics to undergraduate students at cal-tech in 1961–63
 in teen saal ne bhautik shaastra ko padhaane kii nayi disha di or bhautik shaastra nayi tarah se naye vishyon ke saath padhaayaa jane laga
 These lectures were replaced by three books
 yah laal bainding me thim or 'lectures on Physics by Richard p Feynman ke naam se mashhoor huin
 Richard Phillips Fineman, was born on 11 May 1918 and died of cancer in 1988
 chhutpan main finemen aksar sochaa karte the ki vah bade hokar kya bane: vidooshak yaa vaigyanik
 Growing up, he played these two roles together
 log kehete hai ki vah itane mashhoor kyon huye par unke bare main vaigyanik thik hi kehete hai: 'finemen are historical persons, they are entitled to all the respect they received
 ' The finemen's father had his own way of telling things
 ek baar kaa kissa he ki pita or putr park me gum rahe the pita ne ek chidiya kii taraf vah ishaara karke bataaya ki yah chidiya duniya main alag-alag naamo se jaani jaati he
 It is not necessary that you know all those names, nor is it important
 par mahatvapurn yah he ki vah kya or kaise karti he
 They used to try to arouse curiosity in the mind of the child
 It is needless to say that the finemen were curious and curious since childhood
 skool main vah ganit main sabase achche or ganit team ke hero the
 But he gave up mathematics
 unhe laga ki ganit me ucch shiksha praapt karke ve dusron ko ganit padhaane ke alaava or kuch nahin kar sakate
 Thinking of doing something practical, he first went towards electrical engineering but later studied physics
 finemen ne snaatak kii shiksha masachuset institute of technology se puri kii
 He wanted to do research work there but then went to do research work in Princeton
 baad main ve kaha karte the, 'it was right
 maine vahaan janaa ki duniya bahut badi he or kaam karne ke liye bahut si acchhee jagahen hai
 ' prinkton me yuva finemen ko whealer ke saath shodh karne kaa mauka mila
 By that time, Wheeler had not received the Nobel Prize, but he had done the work on which he later received the Nobel Prize
 ve kuch aadambar priy the kuch apni ahmiyat bhi jataate the
 He allowed the finmen to meet at certain times of the day
 pehle din mulaakaat ke samay vah suut pahane the unhone apni jeb se apni sone kii viraam ghadi nikaal kar mej par rakh di taaki finemen ko pataa chal sake ki kab uskaa samay samaapt ho gaya he
 Fineman was a student at that time
 unhone ek bazaar se ek sasti viraam ghadi kharidi - unke paas manhagi ghadi kharidne ke liye paise nahin the
 On the next meeting, he kept his cheap watch near that gold watch
 whealer ko bhi pataa chalanaa chaiye ki unka samay bhi mahatvapurn he
 Wheeler understood the joke and laughed both openly
 donon ne ghadiyaan hataa lee
 Their relationship was not formal, they became friends, their talk turned into laughter and jokes into new fundamental ideas
 isi bich doosraa mahayuddh shuru ho gaya
 Atomic bomb was being made in Germany, Hitler was invincible if it was built there first
 america kii los elmos laboretary me duniya ke vaigyanik ikkatha hokar parmaanu bam banane ke liye ekajute ho gayi
 The finemen were also called there and worked there
 los elmos me suraksha kaa jimmaa sena kaa tha jinke apane niyam apane kanoon the
 This rule was often not understood by the finemen
 finemen taale kholane me maahir the
 They used to tease the officers of the army by opening the lab's chests and leaving guesses on the paper and leaving nothing out of the safes
 yah vah keval, sena ke adhikariyon ko bataane ke liye karte the ki unki suraksha pranali kitni galat he
 During the school days, the finemen fell in love with their classmate Arlene
 unhone shaadi tab karne kii sochi jab finemen ko koi naukari mil jaay
 Arlene received TB when the financers were doing research work
 Done, he had only a few years
 un dinon tii
bi
 kaa koi ilaaj nahin tha
 Arlene gets TB Due to this, the finmen could not even kiss him
 unhe malum tha ki arlin ke saath uske sambandh keval aadhyatmik hi rahengen
 Despite all this, the finemen wanted to marry Arlene
 unke parivaar vaale or mitra is shaadi ke khilaaf the
 He also became estranged from his father about this
 iske baavjood finemen ne arlin ke saath shaadi kii
 When the finmen were working in Los Almos, the director Robert Oppenheimer got Arlene admitted to a nearby sanatorium so that the finmen could meet her
 finemen ke los elmos rahane ke dauraan hi arlin kii mrityu ho gayi
 a picture has also been made on this event cycle, named Infinity), directed by Mathew Bourdwick
 finemen jivant the or aksar mouj masti ke liye kaam karte the
 In fun, he worked on the subject on which he received the Nobel Prize
 yah bhi ek rochak kissa he
 During the Second World War, at the Alumnus Laboratory, the alumnus befriended Beth with whom she was greatly touched
 beth kauranal main the, isaliye finemen bhi kauranal chale gayi
 One day, they were sitting in the snack house of Kaurnal
 vahaan ek vidhyaarthee ne ek plate ko phenkaa
 The plate was white in color and had a red colored symbol of the Cornel in the middle
 plate dagamagaa bhi rahi thi or gum bhi rahi thi
 It was a strange sight
 finemen iske dagamagane or ghoomane or ke bich main sambandh dhudhane lage
 It used to be very difficult mathematical equations
 isame unka bahut samay laga
 They found that both have a relation of 2: 1
 unke saathiyon ne unase kaha ki vah isame samay kyon bekaar kar rahe hai
 His answer was, 'iskaa koi mahatv nahin he main yah sab mouj masti ke liye kar rahaa hum
 ' par vah iske mahatv ke bare me thik nahin the
 When he started researching about the rotation of the electrons, he again remembered the mathematics in the staggered and rotating plate of the Cornel
 isi ne us siddhanth ko janm diya jiske kaaran unhen nobel purushkaar mila
 True, there is a lot in life that is necessary only for fun, whether it has any other importance or not - fun is a matter of importance in itself
 yadi aap mouj masti main hi apni jeevika dhurh sake to kya baat he, yadi yah nahin ho saktaa to shaayad jeevika main hi mouj masti dhurh paanaa duusari acchhee baat he
 Fineman was not only a great scientist but also a great teacher
 unhe malum tha ki apni baat duusare tak kaise pahunchaayi jaay
 The lecture hall was a theater for them, which also had drama and fireworks
 finemen ke dwaara bhautik shaastra par cyle-tech ke lekcharon kaa zikr maine is lekh ko shuruwat me kiya he
 He gave these lectures in September 1961-may 1963
 yah lacture khaas the isaliye inhen hameshaa ke liye surakshit rakhaa gaya or baad me ye teen laal kitabon ke rup main chaape gayi
 The finemen used to give only two lectures a week, the rest of the time he used to prepare these lectures
 lacture kii har line, har majaak ko pehle se soch vichaar kar rakhte the
 There were never lecture notes with him
 bas keval ek chota sa kaagaj rahata tha jisamen aage bataane ke liye kuch khaas shabd keval sanket dene ke liye rahete the
 These three years are unique in lectures on any subject, in any university in the world
 na kabhi aise huye na shaayad phir kabhi honge
 Because i do not know if such a person will come again
 finemen ke liye angreji - bekaar or darshan shaastra - tiraskrit vishay tha
 He had nothing to do with Religion
 chakkaron par baat karnaa unki phiza main nahin tha
 He always spoke directly
 unka matlab vahi hota tha jo ve kehete the
 They would get confused if their direct talk disturbed the other
 finemen ko log alag alag tarah se yaad rakhte hai - kuch log, Probably the most people remember him as the person who publicly told TV why the Challenger-accident happened
 28 janvari 1986 main chalanger spesship kaa visphot akaash main ho gaya tha, isaki jaanch karne ke liye ek kamishan baitha
 Finemen were in it as a scientist
 yah visphot, spesship main kuch ghatiya kism kaa saamaan lagane ke kaaran hua tha
 nasa's administration wanted to suppress it but scientists wanted to uncover it
 kamishan ne apane nishkarsh ko tivi ke saamne sidhe prasaaran me bataanaa shuru kiya 
 At that time on TV itself, in front of everyone, the finemen put substandard stuff inside cold water and showed why the explosion actually happened
 yah sidhaa prasaaran tha isaliye finemen kaa pradarshan roka nahin ja sakaa or yah do minute kii clip kuch ghanto ke andar duniya kii tivi par sabase zyada dikhaayi jane vaali news clip ban gayi
 Finemen often went to a restaurant in Passadina, where topless restaurants lived
 us restaraan main ve uske maalik ko bhautik shaastra bataate the or vah unhe chitrakaari
 Once, the police felt that something was wrong in the restaurant and prosecuted the restaurant owner for obscenity
 vastav main vahaan par is tarah kaa koi kaary nahin hota tha
 Many eminent people used to come to that restaurant
 The owner of the restaurant prayed to give them the most testimony
 sabane chuppe se kanni kaat lee, par finemen ne nahin
 He testified in favor of the restaurant owner and the next day appeared on the front page of newspapers as the most prominent news item
 'caltech's Feynman tells lewd case jury, he watched the girls while doing his equations' These are all worth reading

 From this point onwards, the development of the deck for cartomancy and for gambling diverged; "reading Tarot" is based on the symbolic design of the Tarot de Marseille, retaining old-style full-length character art, special meanings of 21 trumpets, and the use of Latin suits
 On the other hand, "playing tarots", especially from France and the Germanic regions, arrived by the end of the 18th century, which evolved to resemble modern cards, which had indices in their corners and whose numbers and court cards were easily identifiable
 Traditional special cards for trumps were largely removed due to unstable scenes

 isi varsh unhone apana pratham aalochanatmak lekh 'niraalaaji kii kavita' likhaa jo charchit patrika 'chaand' main prakashit hua
 After this, he was constantly oriented towards creation
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke baad dow ramvilas sharma hi ek aise aalochak ke rup main sthapit hote hai, jo bhashaa, sahitya or samaaj ko ek saath rakhkar moolyankan karte hai
 In their criticism process, there is not only literature, but they evaluate literature by taking society, meaning, politics, history together

 After Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma is established as a critic who puts language, literature and society together and assesses it
 unki aalochana prakriya main keval sahitya hi nahin hota, balki ve samaaj, arth, raajnneeti, itihaas ko ek saath lekar sahitya kaa moolyankan karte hai
 Like other critics, he has not evaluated a creator merely to test his writing skills, but his criterion of how judged the creator has been over his time
 itihaas kii samasyaon se jujhna maano unki pehali pratigya ho
 He was busy in finding a solution to every problem in Indian history
 unhone jab yah kaha ki arya bharat ke mul nivasee hai, tab iskaa virodh hua tha
 He said that Aryans have not come to India from West Asia or any other place, but the truth is that they have gone from India to West Asia
 ve likhte hai - ‘‘duusari sahastrabdi isa purv bade-bade jan abhiyaanon kii sahastrabdi he
 Meanwhile, Indian Aryan contingents spread from Iraq to Turkey

 By analyzing the structure of words and their origin, they come to the conclusion that the language of the Aryans has a profound influence on the languages of Europe and West Asia

 This belief is also in an Indian article by Marx
 ’’ Wishing for the liberation of the Indian public from British domination, he wrote in 1833, "we can certainly hope to see a revival of that great and interesting country in the most remote period, where the words of the gentleman resident Prince Saltykov i am more clever and efficient than the Italian people, whose subordination is also balanced by a quiet dignity, who despite their innate laziness Rays officials have been amazed by his bravery, whose country is our languages, is the origin of our religions and where the ancient German in the format race, the nature of ancient Greece reflect Brahyan
 ’’ Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma evaluates Indian contexts from a Marxist point of view, but he himself prides himself on these values, while simultaneously telling his readers that India is a very ancient nation in terms of language and literature and thinking
 ve angrejon dwaara likhwaaye gaye bhartiya itihaas ko ek shadyantr maanate hai
 He says that if we have to evaluate the history of India correctly, then we have to study our ancient texts

 Only by doing this they could rule this great nation

 sorle kaa vichaar he ki prakrutwad vah vichaardhaara he jiske anusaar swaabhaavik athwa nirmaan kii shakti manushya ke sharir ko nahin di ja sakati
 Naturalism appeared in front of the society as a reaction to the complexity of civilization
 ‘prakruti’ ke arth ke sambandh main darshanikon main matbhed rahaa he
 According to Adams, this word is very complex, due to its ambiguity, there are many mistakes
 ‘prakruti’ ko teen prakaar se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 In the first sense, nature refers to that special quality that helps in leading human life towards development and progress
 sarvapratham ruso ne hi prakruti ke is arth se avgat karaayaa
 On the basis of which Dr
 Hall developed the form of 'child centered education'
 atah pratham arth main prakruti kaa taatpary maanav swabhaav se liya jaataa he
 The second meaning of 'prakriti' was stated to be 'exactly opposite of design'
 arthath jis kaary main manushya ne sahyog na diya ho vahi prakritik he
 According to the third meaning of 'nature', 'the whole world' is nature and according to education it means studying the action of the world and bringing it into life
 kuch vidwaan aisa maanate hai ki manushya ko prakruti kii vikasvaadi shrunkhlaa main baadhak nahin bananaa chahie
 But it should remain separate
 chunki vikaas kisi vyakti ke bina nahin ho saktaa he, vyakti bina prayojan kaary nahin kar saktaa, isliye kuch vidwaan aisa maanate hai ki is vikaas ke niyam kaa adhyayan karnaa chaiye tathaa prakruti kaa anuyaayi ho janaa chaiye
 It is thus clear that there is no consensus regarding the meaning of 'nature'
 pracheen siddhanth ke anusaar vah maarg jisamen vyakti jivan main adhik mulyon kii prapti kar saktaa he, vah he- apane jivan kaa prakruti ke saath yatha sambhav nikat sambandh sthapit karnaa
 These ideas are in line with the ideas of Democrites, Epicurus and Lucretius
 ye sabhi vidwaan saamanytah aise jivan kii prapti kii kaamana rakhte the jo yatha sambhav ksht evam pidaa se mukt ho
 Most naturalists, considering the highest credit, have considered it superior and eternal happiness
 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prakrutwad kaa nitishastra sukhwadi he
 Philosophers have differed regarding the meaning of 'nature'
 adams kaa kahana he ki yah shabd atyant jatil he jisaki aspashtataa ke kaaran anek bhoolen hoti hai
 Nature can be explained in 3 ways - yah vichaardhaara padaarth vigyaan par aadhaarit he
 According to this, the molecule exists in all nature
 jagat kii rachana inhen anutatvon se hui he
 Life and mind are all formed by the combination of physical elements
 padaarth vigyaan keval bahya prakruti ke niyamon kaa adhyayan karata he or inhen niyamon ke aadhaar par anubhav ke prayek tathyon kii vyakhya karata he
 Hence laws of nature are paramount
 yah manushya ko bhi padaarth vigyaan ke niyamon ke anusaar samajhane kaa prayaas karata he
 It has no purpose with the inner nature of man, but education is a human process which is related to the inner nature of human
 atah shiksha ke kshetra main padaarth vigyaan ke prakrutwad kaa koi vishesh yogadan nahin he
 According to this community, the universe is a machine that is created by matter and speed
 is pranhin yantra main koi dhyey, prayojan yaa aadhyatmik shakti nahin he
 Although a human being is the best creature in this world, it does not have self-consciousness, its behavior is controlled due to external effects
 jyon-jyon maanav vahya vaataavaran ke sampark main aata he, maanav yantra sucharu rup se kriya karata rahata he
 In this ideology, it is not possible to explain the purposefulness, functionality of human beings, its spiritual qualities
 pashu kii sthiti, yantra kii sthiti tathaa manushya kii sthiti teenon main antar he
 Therefore, human education should be done differently
 isliye shiksha ke kshetra main yantravaadi prakrutwad kaa koi vishesh yogadan nahin he
 This ideology believes in 'principles of development'
 isliye is vichaardhaara kaa udgam darwin ke kramavikas siddhanth se hua he
 According to this belief, man is in the last stage in the evolution of organisms
 mastishk vikaas ke kaaran hi manushya ne bhashaa kaa vikaas kiya jiske falswaroop vah gyaan ko sanchit rakh saktaa he
 Can generate new ideas and develop social and cultural life
 anya sabhi drushtiyon se manushya anya praaniyon se bhinn nahin he
 His destiny and development prospects depend on the lineage and environment
 usamen kisi prakaar kii ichha shakti jaisi koi cheez nahin hoti
 In fact, by this naturalism one can know the former state of man
 kintu uske bhavishya ke aadarshon kii kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 Despite this deficiency, this naturalism can be considered a contribution to education
 prakrutwad ek darshanik vichaardhaara he jo padaarth ko aadhaar evam yatharth maanati he tathaa jagat, jeev or manushya sabhi usee se nirmit he
 The name of Rousseau is generally taken as the principal promoter of this ideology
 ruso ne yadhyapi prakrutwad ke naare ko joardaar dhang se unchaa kiya kintu vah bhi plato jaise vichaarvaadi darshanik se prabhavit tha
 Her thoughts were influenced by plates
 isliye ruso kii prakrutwad kaa swaroop adarshavaadi uddeshyon kii prishthbhumi par nirmit prathit hota he
 Brubaker thinks that Russo was a romantic naturalist
 balak kii ruchi tathaa yogyata, bandhan se dur, prakritik sthal par shiksha kii vyavastha ityadi baton ke aadhaar par ham ruson ko prakrutivaadee nahin kah sakate hai
 Because if Russia can be called a naturalist simply by emphasizing the child's natural interest and love for nature, then we must include Plato in the same category
 rask, doneld butler ityadi darshanik maanate hai ki harbart spencer vastav main prakrutivaadee hai
 Bacon and Comenius also appear to be associated with naturalist ideology
 kintu prakrutwad ko apni charam seemaa par pahunchaane kaa shrey spencer evam ruson ko hi diya ja saktaa he
 Expressing surprise in relation to the Russians, Robert Harbart has written that such an influence of a degenerate person like Rousseau is surprising
 chunki dooshit samaaj kaa ruson bhi ek ang tha, isliye uskaa naitik patan hona swaabhaavik tha
 Therefore, Rousseau made a universal statement about the society then, - 'human institutions are the body of anti-elements and mistakes
 tathaa samaaj dwaara sthapit niyamon ke viruddh kaary karne par sahi kaary sambhav ho sakegaa
 The Russians' slogan of 'return to nature' indicates that they wanted to take students away from the corrupt society into the natural umbrella of the village
 vastav main yah ‘vaad’ 18veen shatabdi kii europe kii saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik evam shaikshik kshetra main hone vaali ‘kranti’ ke parinaam swaroop hua
 This revolution was especially against religious institutions affected by the then orthodoxy and blind beliefs
 yantravaadi prakrutwad ne vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan ko janm diya jiske anusaar prayek manushya kuch sahaj kriyaayein lekar paidaa hota he
 When these spontaneous actions come in contact with the external environment, then related spontaneous actions are formed, these related spontaneous actions help human beings in various tasks
 isliye yantravaadi prakrutivaadee maanav main uchit tathaa upyogi sambaddh sahaj kriyaayein utpann karnaa hi shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 According to naturalists who believe in the principles of biology, the ultimate goal of education is to achieve happiness and joy, but Mr
 macdougall had proved that we work because of basic tendencies, happiness is a reward
 isliye shiksha kaa uddeshy mul pravritiyon kaa roopaantar tathaa shodhan karnaa he, taaki chaatr kii pravritiyon main punanirdesh tathaa ekikaran dwaara naveen saamanjasy utpann ho jaae jisase vah saamaajik evam naitik mulio ke anukool aacharan kar sake
 According to biologists every creature has a desire to live
 or apane jivan kii raksha ke liye use apane vaataavaran se sadaiv sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 Darwin has given two principles in this regard - the struggle of life and the existence of a capable
 isliye darwin manushya ko samarthyavan tathaa shaktishaalee bananaa chaahate hai, jisase jivan sangram main ve safalataa praapt kar saken
 But according to Lamarck, the appropriate purpose is to teach the qualities of change in accordance with the environment
 barnard sha jaise log prakruti kii vikasvaadi gati ko hi teevr karnaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, the aim of education has been to transmit and preserve the culture acquired as a social or ethnic heritage from one generation to another
 sukh env dukh ke siddhanth ke anusaar manushya sukh prapti vaale kaary karata he or dukh dene vaale kaaryon se bachane kaa prayaas karata he
 This is not true because man sometimes even dies for duty
 is sambandh main tii
pi
 nan mahoday kaa vichaar zyada samichin prathit hota he
 Although the nuns are more supportive of idealistic ideology, they have considered with regard to the purpose of education from the point of view of biologists and naturalists
 unke anusaar maanav ke vyaktitv kaa swatantra rup se vikaas karnaa hi shiksha kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 According to the nuns, personalization means self-realization and self-revelation
 is prakaar shiksha kaa uddeshy vyakti main nihit janmajaat shaktiyon ke swatantra tathaa avarodhhin vikaas main sahaayta pradaan karnaa he
 Two views are expressed in this regard
 pratham vichaar ke samarthak woodsaworth hai jinke anusaar balak swarg se prakaashmaan rup main aata he, parantu yahan aakar vah apane vaibhav ko kho detaa he,kyonki vah ek abodh balak hi hota he
 Therefore, education should be provided with its current pleasures
 doosraa vichaar jeremia ityadi vyaktiyon kaa he jo balak ko paap ke kaaran utpann maanate hai tathaa use keval kathor anushaasan main rakhkar, uski swaabhaavik pravritiyon ko samaapt karnaa hi shiksha kii vidhi tathaa ishwaronmukh karnaa shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 But this idea cannot be given much importance because this idea seems animalistic
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar balak kii shiksha uske swabhaav par ashrith honi chahie jiske mul main aadim samveg, moulik ichchhaayein tathaa prakritik manovritiyaan nihit hai
 Real education is that which is tailored to the child's interest, abilities and inclination
 balak ke liye anushaasan tathaa bandhan naam maatr ke hone chahie
 Naturalists consider the child to be a construction-oriented human rather than a miniature form of human
 uski prakruti satat viksit hoti rahati he
 Therefore, everyone should pay special attention towards the fulfillment of these objectives
 prakrutivaadee paathyakram kaa aakhyaan spencer kii pustak se praapt hota he
 The specialty of his curriculum is that the basis of the entire syllabus is considered to be science
 spencer ke anusaar vigyaan dwaara hi samgr jivan jeena sambhav he
 Spencer has offered the following courses to serve the purpose of a holistic life
 pracheen kaaleen shikshan paddati main adhyaaapak kriyasheel rahete the
 The place of boys was secondary, but more emphasis was placed on the activity of the boy by the naturalists
 ye ratane tathaa niskriy abhyaas kii vidhi kaa virodh karte hai tathaa ‘karke seekhney’ evam ‘anubhav dwaara seekhney’ ke siddhanton par aadhaarit vidhiyon ke prayog par bal dete hai
 In addition, the naturalist ideology gave birth to Project Method, Scout, Movement, School Union, Children Club etc
 prakrutivaadee shikshan vidhi ke nimnlikhit siddhanth par vishesh mahatv dete hai- In naturalist education, the teacher has a secondary position
 prakrutivaadee vichaarak prakruti ko hi vaastavik shikshika maanate hai
 In his view, the child should be given an opportunity to get education in the natural environment by keeping them away from society
 ruson ke anusaar shikshak par samaaj ke kusanskaron kaa prabhaav itnaa pad gaya hota he ki vah baalkon ko sadguni banane kaa prayaas bhale hi kar len, vah unhen sadguni bana nahin saktaa kyonki vah swayan sadguni nahin he
 Therefore the Russians do not want to give any place to the teacher in the early education of the child
 anya prakrutivaadee ruso ke atirek ko sweekaar nahin karte
 He considers the role of teacher in the education of children only as assistant and guide
 isliye shikshak ko manovigyaan kaa gyaata hona chaiye
 He should be aware of the wishes, needs, interests and mental development of the child
 shikshak ke liye balak kii swatah aatmasfoort kriyaaon kaa jaananaa aavashyak he
 Because the student does his education by these self-powers, the teacher does only a combination of appropriate conditions
 yadi seekhney kaa parinaam sukhad hota he to balak seekhney main anand letaa he
 And it frequents the said educational experience
 shikshak se yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah balak ke liye anukulit vaataavaran taiyaar kare
 According to Russo the school itself is a special type of society
 is samaaj ke dwaara baalkon ko bhavi samaaj ke yogya banaaya jaataa he
 Through this society, he learns the feeling of self-governance
 netritv karne tathaa prakrutivaadee uddeshyon kii purti karne hetu apane ko taiyaar karata he
 This type of school society is not rigid
 yadhyapi ruso ne skool main ek chaatr tathaa ek adhyaaapak kii kalpana kiya he
 Normally, naturalists oppose formal education in some way, hence it does not give any important place to the school, and asks the children to stay away from the contaminated environment and stay in the natural environment
 inhen vichaaron ke kaaran prakrutivaadee vichaarak skulon ko kritrim kathor evam drudh bandhanon vaali sanstha nahin chaahate
 According to the naturalists, representation of children is also necessary in the system of subjects related to curriculum and concomitant activities etc
 isliye unhen bhraman, deshaatan, khel kud, scouting, samaaj seva ityadi kaaryakramon kii swayan hi vyavastha karne kii swatantraaa deni chaiye
 Teachers should only discharge the role of pioneer
 prakrutivaadee vichaarak shiksha main anushaasan ko mahatv nahin dete he
 They believe in the law of 'cause and consequence'
 unke anusaar prayek vyakti jo karm karata he,uskaa parinaam vah avashya bhogata he
 These results are both pleasurable and painful
 is aadhaar par anushaasan sthapit karne ke do upanium dikhaai dete hai - According to Rousseau's theory, nature is punished for bad actions of a child
 isliye use kisi prakaar kaa dand na dekar prakritik dand dwaara anushaasit hone diya janaa chaiye, jabaki spencer ke siddhanth ke anusaar balak sukhadaayi kaaryon ko baar baar duhraana chahta he
 Because it gives him a feeling of happiness while he gives up sad things, because it makes him suffer
 is prakaar balak anushaasit dhang se vyavhaar karne lagata he or usamen swanushasan kii bhaavana viksit hone lagati he
 Some naturalist thinkers oppose any kind of 'repressive theory' for the establishment of discipline in the education system
 unka vichaar he ki baalkon par shikshakon kaa prabhaav vishesh rup se padataa he
 Therefore, to develop a sense of discipline in children, 'naturalistic principles should be resorted to, while many naturalist thinkers believe that it is better if discipline is established according to natural rules
 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prakrutivaadee baalkon main swanushasan kii bhaavana ke vikaas ke liye ‘mukttmak siddhanth’ par vishesh bal dete hai
