 In Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and western states, 'bayana' is done on Karva Chauth or other Chauth, Ahoi Ashtami, Haritalika, Diwali, Holi

 Bayana in Bihar means the distribution of dishes made on the occasion of the festival
 krishi pradhan samaaj main rishtedaariyon se 'sandesh' aane kaa bhi rivaaj tha
 There was so much material that even the whole family could not eat
 adhik saamagree gaanv main baantne ke liye hi bheji jaati thi
 When the message arrived, the women of the house would have a special task
 har ghar ke liye thodaa-thodaa nikaalkar sajaana or bhejnaa
 In sharing this 'bayna', mutual transactions were also taken care of
 jis ghar se jitani puriyaan ain hotin, us ghar main utani hin bheji jaatin
 Elderly women of the house used to keep track of Bayana from house to house

 The daughters of the house used to accompany them

 On asking the reason, the grandmother had told - what address anyone has seen from this point of view

 Bad food can also occur
 yani ki gaanvon kii samuhikta main bhi shaq kii gunjaaish to thi hi

 In the houses where the festival took place, there was exchange of food and fruits among themselves

 There was discussion in the village
 'byna' ke madhyam se ek duusare ke chauke-chuulhe kaa swaad maaloom hota
 The people of the village would have been waiting for 'bayana' when the message came to someone's house
 kabhi-kabhi 'byna' lautaa bhi diya jaataa tha
 This shows that the returning family is angry with the sending family
 unka maan manuval hota
 Sometimes people would get angry even if 'bayna' did not come

 The United Nations Population Fund has designated October 12, 1999 as the deadliest day on which the world's population reached 6 billion
 yah 1987 main vishwa jansankhya ke 5 arab tak pahunchne ke lagbhag 12 saal baad or 1993 main vishwa jansankhya ke 5
5 arab tak pahunne ke 6 saal baad hua
 However, in some countries like Nigeria and China, the population is not even known to be close to a million, so there is a lot of error in such estimates

 Population control is generally considered to reduce population growth by reducing birth rate
 pracheen greece dastavejon main mili uttarjivita ke record jansankhya niyantran ke abhyaas evam prayog ke sabase pehle udhaaharan hai
 This includes the colonization movement, in which Greek outposts were built around the Mediterranean and Black Sea in order to provide sufficient space for the greater population of individual states to settle
 kuch unani nagar rajyon main jansankhya kam karne ke liye shishu hatya or garbhpaat ko protsaahan diya gaya
 An important example of compulsory population control is the People's Republic of China's one-child policy in which having more than one child is considered very bad

 The birth of only 100 girls as compared to 114 boys in the country's sex ratio shows that infanticide is usually done according to gender choice
 yah baat upyogi hogi agar prajnan niyantran karne ko vyakti ke vyaktigat nirnay ke rup main or jansankhya niyantran ko sarkari yaa rajya str kii jansankhya vruddhi kii viniman niti ke rup main dekha jaae| prajnan niyantran kii sambhaavna tab ho sakati he jab koi vyakti yaa dampati yaa parivaar apane bachche paidaa karne ke samay ko ghataane yaa use niyantrit karne ke liye koi kadam uthaaye| ansale kole dwaara die gaye sanrupan main, prajnan main lagaataar kami karne ke liye teen purvapratibandh die gaye hai: prajnan ke maanya tatv ke rup main pariklit chunaav ko sweekruti, kam kiye gaye prajnan se gyaat laabh or niyantran ke prabhavi tareekon kaa gyaan or unka prayog karne kaa kushal abhyaas

 They can use these resources to delay childbirth, differentiate between childbirths, or prevent their births

 On the other hand, those individuals who can control themselves in terms of reproduction, such people can further accelerate the process of childbirth or make it successful
 saamaajik str par, prajnan main giravat hona mahilaon kii babbti hui dharmanirpeksh shiksha kaa ek anivaary parinaam he
 However, fertility control from moderate to high levels does not necessarily involve reducing fertility rates
 yahaan tak ki jab aise alag alag samaaj kii tulana ho jo prajnan niyantran ko acchhee khaasi tarah apana chuke he, to baraabar prajnan niyantran yogyata rakhane vaale samaaj bhi kaaphi alag alag prajnan str de sakate hai, jo ki is baat se judaa hota he ki chote yaa bade parivaar ke liye yaa bacchon kii sankhya ke liye vyaktigat or saanskrithik pasand kya he
 Unlike fertility control, which is primarily an individual-level decision, the government may make several attempts to control the population, such as by increasing people's access to contraceptive devices, or by other population policies and programs
 As defined above, "fertility control" is not involved in implementing 'population control' at the government or social level, as a state can control the population of a society even though the use of reproductive control in society is very less You go jansankhya niyantran ke ek pahalu ke rup main aabaadi badhaane vaali nitiyon ko angeekrut karnaa bhi zaruri he or zaruri he ki ye samajha jaae kii sarkaar jansankhya niyantran ke rup main sirf jansakhya vruddhi ko rokna nahin chaahati| jansankhya vruddhi ko protsaahit karne ke liye sarkaar na keval apravas kaa samarthan kar sakati he balki janm samarthak nitiyon jaise ki kar laabh, vittiya puraskaar, chhuttiyon ke dauraan vetan dena jari rakhane or bacchon ki dekh rekh main madad karne dwaara bhi logon ko atirikt bachche paidaa karne ke liye protsaahit kar sakati he
 For example in recent years such policies were adopted in France and Sweden
 jansankhya vruddhi badhane ke isi lakshya ke saath, kai baar sarkaar ne garbhpaat or janm niyantran ke aadhunik sadhano ke prayog ko bhi niyantrit karne kii koshish kii he
 An example of this is the ban in Romania in 1966 for contraceptive means and abortion on demand
 paristhitiki main, kai baar jansankhya niyantran puri tarah sirf parbhakshan, beemaari, paraseete or paryaavaran sambandhi karkon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In a continuous environment, population control is controlled only by the availability of food, water and security
 ek nishchit kshetra adhiktam kul kitni prajatiyon yaa kul kitne jivit sadasyon ko sahaara de saktaa he use us jagah kii dhaaran kshamta kehete hai
 Sometimes it also involves human impact on plants and animals

 The area from which the migration takes place is left for the next time to raise or produce food supplies for a large group of animals

The idols of these goddesses built in the houses of the barns are definitely found! Along with Karni Mata Charan, the Rathod clan of Rajput clan is also considered as Kuldevi!
