 The action of dilute acid on limestone is very easy, so this stone is not suitable for home construction near industrial cities

 Therefore, stone should be tested before home construction

 He was born in Perinaldo, near Imperia, in the county of Nice at the time
 samvidhan, mul siddhanton yaa sthapit naziron kaa ek samucchy he, jisase koi rajya yaa anya sanghathan abhishasit hote hai
 It is a code designed to operate an organization
 yah praayah likhit rup main hota he
 It is the method which is the basis of governance of a nation; Determines its character, organization, and explains its method of use, it is the ultimate law of the nation and consumes special statutory status
 All the prevailing laws must necessarily conform to the spirit of the constitution if they violate it
 They are declared unconstitutional
 bharat kaa samvidhan vishwa ke kisi bhi samprabhu desh kaa sabase lambaa likhit samvidhan he, jisamen, uske angrezi-bhashi sanskaran main 146,385 shabdon ke saath, 22 bhaagon main 444 anuchhed, 12 anusuchiyaan or 101 sanshodhan hai, jabaki monako kaa samvidhan sabase chota likhit samvidhan he, jisamen 97 anuchhedon ke saath 10 adhyay, or kul 3,814 shabd hai
 The term constitution is commonly used in two forms, compressed and expanded
 vistrut rup main iskaa prayog kisi rajya ke shashanprabandh sambandhi sab niyamon ke liye hota he
 Some of these rules are valid and enforced by the courts, but there are others which are not completely legal
 in vidhi se pare ardhvaidhanik niyamon kii utpatti roodhi, paramparaagat prathaon, prachlit vyavhaar evam vidhi vyakhya se hoti he
 Due to their impure form, these rules are not recognized in the courts, but still in the practicality of governance, their effect is constitution of pure rules
 england kaa vidhaan is kathan kaa sakshi he
 In other countries, the constitution means more narrowly, and only in relation to the special rules that are tied up in official documents for governance
 falat: samvidhan ek prakaar se kisi desh kaa vah ek yaa adhik lekhptr hota he jisamen us desh ke shashanprabandh main anushaasan ke mul niyam sankalit hon
 The United States and India's constitution are witnesses to this meaning
 'samvidhan' shabd kaa aashay koi bhi mana jaae kintu mul vastu yah he ki kisi desh ke samvidhan kaa purna adhyayan keval kuch likhit niyamon ke avlokan ke sambhav nahin
 Because, they are only a part of the discipline related to governance
 sampurna sanvaidhanik parichay shashanprabandheey sab angon ke adhyayan se hi sambhavit ho saktaa he
 For example, in the Constitution contract, only the main organs of governance - the executive, the legislative assembly, the judiciary - are mentioned
 kintu in sansthaaon kii rachana, padaadhikariyon kii niyukti kii reeti ityadi kii vyakhya saadhaaran vidhi dwaara hi nishchit hoti he
 Similarly, in many countries, the electoral rules, the number of members per constituency and per region, the composition of government departments and the organization of the judiciary, all these important functions are not explained in the Constitution; Even if it is, in a very simple way, it is mainly described and controlled by ordinary method
 iske atirikt sampurna vidhirachana vidhanmandal ke kshetra main hi simit nahi hoti, nyaaypalika dwaara mulavidhi kii vyakhya dwaara jo niyam prasphutit hote hai unase samvidhan main nity sanshodhanatmak naveenta aati rahati he
 Again, state-related stereotypes and attitudes are also no less influential and important
 atev in sab anshon kaa adhyayan hi sarvang vaidhanik parichay purna kar saktaa he
 But within the purview of the word 'constitutional scripture' only pure legal rules come, all others are considered constitutional practices
 samvidhan ke do prakaar hai : likhit evam alikhit
 Written constitutions are mostly a lekhya or some compiled lekhya
 kintu jis rup main samvidhan kriyanvit hota he uski vyakhya na kahin purnataya likhit hoti he, na purnataya alikhit
 The Constitution of England is considered unwritten but there are also Acts of Settlement in 1701, several Representations of People's Acts, the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 by which the powers of the Lord House were limited, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 1816 and 1862, and 1947 The Crown Proceedings Act was created in AD
 in likhit niyamon kaa mahatv england ke samvidhan main, alikhit roodhi, parampara tathaa vyavhaar se tanik bhi kam nahin he
 In contrast, in the written constitution of India, some unwritten rules are found in complementary form, such as privileges of legislatures and members, relationship of President and Governor to Council of Ministers, constitutional crisis and the position of Governor, in relation to all these subjects of the Constitution
 Additional unwritten rules only apply
 samvidhan sambandhi anya bhed hai - namansheel evam paridrudh, bahudhaa inhen kramshah: alikhit evam likhit ke paryaayavachi rup main bhi prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Lord Bryce has used the words humbly in place of writing and soft words in place of the unwritten
 kintu is prakaar kaa mishrit prayog uchit nahin
 In fact, the constitution can be written but flexible and can be unwritten but landscape
 siddhantat: england kii sansad nimish maatr main england ke samvidhan main manonith parivartan kar sakati he tathaa vahaan kaa pradhan mantri mantrimandal ko aamantrit na kar mantrimandaleey shashanpaddati kii itishree kar saktaa he, kintu aise aakasmik parivartan kabhi vyavhaar main kriyaatmak nahin hote
 If we look at the history of England, it would seem that changes have always taken place in the form of gradual development; There is no possibility of contingency
 matpradaan, swatantraaa sudhaar, lard sabha kii satta ke hanan sambandhi niyam, tathaa yudhoparant adhirajya swashaasan adhikaar in sabake hote hue bhi ek shatabdi ke abhyantar main england kaa samvidhan alikhit hokar bhi kam parivartan hue hai
 As a result, the constitution of England, despite being unwritten, is not a salutary one
 iske vipareet bhartiya samvidhan paridrudh kaha jaataa he, kaaran ki isaki sanshodhanakriya badi jatil he, jahaan kisi kisi vishay main sanshodhan ke liye keval kendriya sansad kaa bahumat hi paryaapt nahin varan samast rajyon ke vidhanmandalon kaa bahumat praapt karnaa bhi anivaary he
 Even after such a complex system, many amendments have been made in the Indian Constitution in the last several years
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki sanshodhan parivarttan evam sanshodhan kaa sambandh keval sanshodhanakriya kii likhit vyavastha se nahin varan desh kii pramukh prabhavatmak raajnneetik dalbandiyon ke santosh yaa asantosh se hota he
 Changes do not occur if they are satisfied with the statutory framework and the distribution of political power through it, otherwise amendments, rotations, changes are inevitable
 sanvaidhanik sanshodhano kaa kaaran congressi sarkarein thim jinke niyantran main kendriya tathaa lagbhag samast rajyon ke shashan kii bagdor thi
 Therefore, the form of any constitution is salutary or scenario, it can only explain the constitutional history of that country
 yadi kahin parivartan sahaj rup se hote rahe hai to us desh kaa samvidhan namansheel he, anyathaa paridrudh
 Following the example of the United States of America, the practice of written constitution has become prevalent in most countries
 likhit samvidhan kahin vidhayika dwaara nirmit hote hai jaise 'american articalj ov kanfaderation' ne america main tathaa austrio hungarian sangh ne 1867 main austria main kiya
 Despite the desire, many emperors and kings also made constitutions in their countries in the nineteenth century
 france main 1814 tathaa 1830 i
 main tathaa 1848 i
 main sardenia main isi prakaar vahaan ke samraterchit samvidhan ghoshit hue
 Other constitutions were mostly made by the legislatures of the country, such as the United States of America in 1787 AD and India in 1949
 adhikanshtya un samast deshon main jahaan likhit samvidhan upasthit he, samvidhan ko desh kii anya vidhiyon se adhik manyata di jaati he
 The reason for this is that the constitution itself originated from the feeling that autocracy can be disciplined and limited in governance
 shashanprabandh samvidhan ke bandhanon se kitna niyantrit hoga athwa samvidhan ke bandhanon se kitna niyantrit hoga, athwa samvidhan kitna ucch mana jayega, yah samvidhannirmaataaon ke uddeshy evam drushtikon par nirbhar karata he ki vah kis vishay main samvidhan kii kitni manyata evam suraksha ke icchhuk the
 At the time of the creation of the Indian constitution, there were many basic questions before the framers, such as the protection of the basic rights of the citizens, a clear explanation of the scope of the Center and the states, so that both confine their legal practice within their prescribed limits, the form of the constitution should be kept in perspective, and the states In mutual commerce business, protecting freedom etc
 desh main karypalika yaa vidhayika ke samast kaaryon kii shuddhta tathaa auchity isi par nirbhar karata he ki vah desh ke sanvaidhanik uddeshy bandhanon ke anukool he athwa nahin, yadi koi kaary in mul uddeshyon ke pratikul hota he to vah shakti bahya kaha jaataa he
 Where there is legal application and interpretation in the Supreme Court of the state, most of the time there is also a certainty as to whether such a statute is out of power or not
 amareeki samvidhan ke ek pramukh rachayita hamiltan ke anusaar samvidhan vastav main mul vidhi he tathaa nyaayadhishon ko sadaa is tathy ko sweekaar kar manyata deni chahie
 When there is opposition in the ordinary statutes and constitution made by the legislatures, then the constitution should be given higher and primary recognition
 kaaran yah he ki samvidhan swayan desh kii janata ke aantarik uddeshyon kii abhivyakti he jab ki anya vidhi us janata kii pratinidhi sabhaaon kii bhaawanaaon kii pratik hoti he
 Naturally the constitution is original and superior
 america ke pradhan nyaayadhish marshall ne 1803 main marbaro banaam medisson kaa nirnay isi niyam ke anusaar kiya tha
 Where there is an unwritten constitution, there is no need for a constitutional rule on governance, but this kind of control and discipline is instinctively carried out by fear of public opinion and election-action, traditions and stereotypes

 sheet helium, jisaki shyanta shunya hoti he, kaa vicitra vyavhaar hota he ki yah apane main aarpaar aa ja saktaa he
 This behavior is due to its bosonic properties, since its nucleus is boson and is not bound to follow the poly exclusion principle, so it can pass through itself

 Of these, Boson is named after Satyendra Nath Basu

 haanazi athwa chini bhavchitra chini bhashaa or japani bhashaa likhane ke liye istemaal hone vaale bhavchitra hote hai
 When they are used for sugar, they are called Hanzhi and when used for Japanese, they are called Kanji
 puraane jamaane main inkaa prayog korian bhashaa or vietnami bhashaa ke liye bhi hota tha
 Chinese image is the oldest ongoing writing method of the world
 vaise to chini main dasiyon hazaar bhavchitra hai, lekin in main se adhiktar keval aitihaasik likhaaiyon main dekhne ko milte hai
 Studies have shown that it is enough to know three to four thousand images to be literate in ordinary Chinese
 har chini bhavchitra ke saath ek uccharan or ek arth judaa hota he or zyaadaatar chini shabd do bhavchitron ke saath likhe jate hai 
 Note that pronunciation varies with the language and language
 yah devanagari lipi ki tarah nahin he ki kisi akshar kaa har jagah vahi uccharan ho
 To understand this, think that if one sees the picture of a mountain, then everyone will understand it, but the Hindi-speaking person will say 'mountain', the Persian-speaking will say 'koh' and the English-speaking will say 'mountain'
 chini bhavchitron ke aksar do yaa teen rup hote hai: Over time, a lot of images had become popular and many of them were complicated to write, so the governments of Japan and China have made some standardizations and simplifications
 is se chini bhashaa ke bahut se shabdon ke do rup hote hai - parmparik chini rup or sarlikrut chini rup
 Japanese and Chinese forms of many words are also similar but slightly different
 chini bhavchitron kii kai shreniyan hoti hai: These were once used to be pictures, but to ease writing and standardize, their appearance has changed a bit
 udhaaharan swaroop, 人 yani 'vyakti', 日 yani 'suraj', 月 yani 'chaand' or 木 yani 'vriksh'
 About 4% of Chinese images belong to this category
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'pictogram' kehete hai
 This gives them other meanings by slightly tweaking the pictures
 jaise ki jahaan 木 kaa arth 'vriksh', vahaan do vrikshon ko jodakar 林 banataa he, jiskaa matlab ' jhuramut' he
 If three trees are written together, it means 'forest'
 usee tarah 刀 kaa matlab to 'chaaku' he lekin isaki dhar par nishaan lagane se 刃 banataa he, yani ' dhar'
 Words with new meanings have been created by making marks from zara-zara
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogram' kehete hai
 Words with new meanings are created by adding more than one picture or motif to them
 jaise ki 日 yani 'suraj' or 月 yani 'chaand' ko jodakar 明 yani 'roshan' banataa he
 If a person is attached to a tree, then 休 is formed, which means 'rest'
 isi tarah se 女 or 子 jodne se 好 banataa he, jiskaa arth 'acha' nirdhaarit hua he
 Although some linguists dispute this, another example of this is to combine the 安 sign for 'roof' with the 女 sign for 'woman', which means 'peace'

 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogramic Compounds'
 kabhi-kabhi aisa hua he ki kisi chiz ke liye chihn nahin tha lekin us shabd kaa uccharan kisi or shabd se miltaa tha jiske liye bhavchitra tha, to vah chihn donon ke liye hi istemaal hone laga
 For example, in many Chinese languages, the word 'zee' also meant 'nose' and 'self'
 'naak' ke liye chihn 自 tha or vah 'swayan' ke liye bhi prayog hone laga
 With the passage of time, the meaning of the 'nose' has been forgotten and in modern Chinese script its meaning is left only to 'itself'
 is shrenee kaa naam 'reebus' angrezi se liya gaya he
 Most of the words in Chinese script belong to this category
 inamen ek yaa ek se adhik chihn aise hote hai jo shabd kaa arth bataate hai or ek bhavchitra aisa hota he jiskaa arth se koi lenaa-dena nahin lekin yah kisi aisi chiz kaa chihn hota he jiskaa uccharan is shabd se miltaa-julata ho
 With this, both the pronunciation and the meaning of the word are known
 udahaaran ke liye 'nadi', 'jhil', 'jharnaa', 'bahut jabardast pani kii dhar, yaa flash kiya gaya pani' or 'phislan' 
 Consider that there are three small ridges on the left side of each sign, which is made by simplifying the picture of 'river'
 is se sanket miltaa he ki shabd 'pani' se sambandhit he
 The right side of the word tells only the sound
 沖 ke dai taraf 中 he, jiskaa arth chini main 'bich' hota he or uccharan 'jhong' hota he
 It can be seen that 沖 is saying 'word related to water, which is pronounced from Zhong', ie 'chong'
 angrezi main aise bhavchitron ke arth bataane vaale hisse ko 'radical' bolte hai or is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'phono-simantic compoundj' kehete hai
 The expressions in this category were first developed during the Shang dynasty and have been found scratched on the bones found in the ruins of that time
 kabhi-kabhi do bhavchitron se ek shabd banataa he jisamen arthbhaag donon bhavchitron par lagu hota he
 For example, there is a Chinese musical instrument, 'beeva' and a fruit is 'lokat'
 in donon ke aakaar dekhne main milte hai
 Biwa was written as 批 把, in which the sign of a hand moving up and down on either side of the two signs is indicated, that is, playing the instrument by moving the hand up and down
 ab isamen 'haath' kaa arthbhaag badalakar 'ped' kaa radical lagane se 枇杷 kaa chihn bana 
 This new two-faced word meant 'fruit of the laukat'
 samay ke saath biva vaadya ke chihn swayan hi badal gaye or aadhunik chini main 琵琶 hai 
 Homogeneous words in languages are those that were once the same but over time their vowels have diverged and sometimes meanings have also changed
 udhaaharan ke liye sanskrit kaa 'pati' shabd or angrezi kaa 'potent' shabd ek hi aadim hind-europea bhashaa ke shabd se utpann hue hai, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or arthon donon main zaraa fark aa gaya he
 This has happened in the Chinese language also
 masalan 'kaao' or 'lao' kabhi ek hi shabd hua karte the, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or bhavchitra donon ek-dusre se bhinn ho gaye hai
 The expressions in this category are few in Chinese script and in English this category is called 'transformed Cognates'

 Jaisalmer was founded in the desert of Dhar in the far west of India by raval-jaisal, a descendant of Yaduvanshi Bhati, around 1178 AD at the beginning of the medieval period of Indian history
 rawal jaisal ke vanshajon ne yahan bharat ke ganatantr main parivartan hone tak bina vansh kram ko bhang kiye hue 770 varsh satat shashan kiya, jo apane aap main ek mahatvapurn ghatana he
 The state of Jaisalmer has witnessed and endured many periods of India's history
 sultanate kaal ke lagbhag 300 varsh ke itihaas main gujarata hua yah rajya mughal samrajya main bhi lagbhag 300 varshon tak apane astitv ko banaae rakhane main sakasham rahaa

 At the time of the dissolution of the Indian Republic, its geographical area was spread over an extensive land area of 16,062 square miles
 registan kii visham paristhitiyon main sthit hone ke kaaran yahan kii jansankhya binsavin sadi ke prarambh main maatr 76,255 thi
 The land area of jaisalmer district was famous as 'maddhara' or 'vallabhamandal' in ancient times
 mahabharat ke yuddh ke baad badi sankhya main yadav is ore agrasar hue va yahaan aa kar bas gayi
 There are many beautiful havelis and clusters of Jain temples which were built between the 12th to 15th centuries
 jaisalmer rajya bharat ke pashchim bhaag main sthit thar ke registan ke dakshin pashchimi kshetra main failaa hua tha
 The state of Jaisalmer in the map is 20001 to 20002 North latitude and 69029 to 72020 East longitude
 parantu itihaas ke ghatnakram ke anusaar uski seemayen sadaiv ghatati badhati rahati thi
 According to which the area of the state was also more or less used
 jaisalmer kaa kshetra thar ke registan main sthit he
 Here, there are high and high mounds of permanent and temporary sand, which change their location along with wind, storms
 inhen retile tilon ke madhya kahin-kahin par patharile pathaar va pahadiyaan bhi sthit hai
 The slope of this entire area is towards the west of the Sindh River and the Rann of Kutch
 bhumijaisalmer rajya kaa sampurna bhaag retila va patharilaa hone ke kaaran yahan kaa taapmaana may-june main adhiktam 47 centegrade tathaa disambar-janvari main nunatam 05 centegrade rahata he
 There is no permanent source of water in the entire state
 varsha hone par kai sthanon par varsha kaa meetha jal ekatra ho jaataa he
 Here the water of most wells is saline and the collected water of rain is the only water source
 janvari-march tak yahaan thand padati he or taapmaana shunya degree celsius tak pahunch jaataa he
 It heats very well till april-june and the average temperature is 45 degrees Celsius

 To enjoy such an enchanting view, tourists do not even care about the scorching heat and roam around here
 oktober se disambar tak monsoon or thand ke bich ke mausam main yahaan aap thand or barish donon tarah ke mausam kaa anand uthaa sakate hai
 Jaisalmer's high-rise luxurious palaces and havelis with narrow streets remind the tourists of the medieval monarchy
 shahar itane chote kshetra main failaa he ki sailaani yahan paidal ghoomte hue marubhumi ke is sunahare mukut ko nihaar sakate hai
 Jaisalmer is believed to have been founded by Bhati, Rao Jaisal in the 12th century
 itihaas kii drushti se dekhen to jaisalmer shahar par khilji, rathore, mughal, tughlaq aadi ne kai baar akraman kiya tha
 Despite this, the royal buildings of Jaisalmer are true emblems of the Rajput style
 jaisalmer rajya bharat ke maanchitr main aise sthal par sthit he jahaan iskaa itihaas main ek vishisht mahatv he
 Due to the vast area of this state on the northwestern border of India, the initial attacks of Arabs and Turkey were not only tolerated by the rulers here, but also by pushing them back firmly with the rest of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Central India from these external invasions for centuries
 Protected until rajasthan ke do rajput rajya, mewaai or jaisalmer anay rajyon se pracheen maane jate hai, jahaan ek hi vansh kaa lambe samay tak shashan rahaa he
 Although the state of Jaisalmer has gained little fame in comparison to the history of Mewar, the main reason is that during the Mughal period, where the Maharanas of Mewar remained independent, the Maharawals of Jaisalmer reconciled the Mughals like other rulers
 It went on till the end
 aarthik kshetra main bhi yah rajya ek saadhaaran aay vaala pichhadaa kshetra rahaa jiske kaaran yahan ke shaasha kabhi shaktishaalee sainya bal sangathit nahin kar sake
 As a result, its neighboring states suppressed its vast land and formed new states including Bikaner, Khairpur, Mirpur, Bahawalpur and Shikarpur

 This state remained almost cut off from the other provinces of the country due to lack of easy means of transport for centuries
 is kaaran baahar ke logon ke jaisalmer ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree rahi he
 Generally, in the imagination of people, this place is just a desert surrounded by dust and intestines
 parantu vastusthiti aisi nahin he, itihaas evam kaal ke thapede khate hue bhi yahan pracheen, samskruti, kala, parampara va itihaas apane mul rup main vidhman rahaa tathaa yahan ke ret ke kan-kan main pichley aath sau varshon ke itihaas kii gaathaayen bhari hui hai
 The state of Jaisalmer maintained the original Indian culture, folk style, social beliefs, production, music, literature, architecture, etc
 jaisalmer rajya kii sthapana bhartiya itihaas ke madhyakaal ke aarambh main 1178i

 Cigars are made from three types of tobacco leaves whose variations determine smoking and flavor characteristics: cigar ke sabase bahari pattey yaa raper paudhe ke sabase chaude hisse se taiyaar hote hai
 The wrapper determines most of the properties and flavor of the cigar, and even its color is often used to describe the entirety of the cigar
 nirmaataaon dwaara 100 se adhik raparon ke shades kii pahchaan kii gayi he lekin sabase halake se lekar sabase gahare saat sabase aam vargeekaran is prakaar hai: ' Some manufacturers use an alternate name: aam taur par gahare raper ek mithaas kaa sparsh jod sakate hai jabaki halake raper swaad main sookhepan kaa sanket dete hai
 It is generally accepted that the wrapper contributes 40 percent to the flavor, while the filler and binder contribute another 60 percent
 aam taur par yah sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki maduro cigar kaa swaad halake raper main isi cigar kii apeksha kahin adhik kadaa hota he lekin yah sabhi cigaron par lagu nahin hota
 Most parts of a cigar are made of fillers that are flakes of leaves wrapped inside the wrapper

 In the cigar industry, it is referred to as "blend"
 kai cigar nirmaataa dhumrapaan karne vaale vyakti ko sabase adhik anand dene vaala sateek bland taiyaar kar khud par garv mahasoos karte hai
 The more oil present in tobacco leaves, the faster the filler

 This can inhibit the entire spectrum of easily detectable flavors
 istemaal ke samay ligero ko hameshaa philler ke bich se modaa jaataa he kyonki yah dhire-dhire jalataa he
 Fillers may be long or short; Long filler uses whole leaves and is of a better quality, while shorter filler called "mixed" uses chopped leaves, stems and other bits
 haal hi main kuch utpaadakon ne aise cigaron ko banaaya he jise unhone "medium philler" kaa naam diya he
 They use relatively large leaves instead of small filler with no stems which are of better quality than smaller filler cigars

 Little cigars are quite different from common cigars

 In response to the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act in the United States from 1971 to 1973, sales of Little Cigars increased fourfold, the act banned the transmission of cigarette advertisements, and mandated compulsory writing of health warnings on cigarette packets

 To smoke a cigar, the person who smokes first cuts it, burns it and then puts the un-lit portion in the mouth and draws the smoke inside the mouth
 kuch dhumrapankarta dhuen ko fefdon ke andar lete hai, vishesh rup se little cigaron ke maamle main, lekin yah abhyaas anyathaa asaamaanya he
 The smoker can make rings inside the mouth before the smoke is removed from the mouth and can expel some part of the smoke out of the nose to get a better aroma and flavor

 Is pasted
 cigar ko thik se pine yogya banane ke liye iske cap vaale sire ko anivaary rup se kaat diya jaataa he
 It is a round end in which tobacco does not come out, and it is the tip that must be cut off by the smoker at all times
 If the cap is cut off either inadvertently or inadvertently, the other end of the cigar will not burn evenly and the potable tobacco will be wiped out
 Some cigar manufacturers deliberately add different varieties of tobacco from one end to the other to give the smoker a feel of different flavors, torso and power from beginning to end
 galat sire se cigar pine kaa parinaam ek bure anubhav ke rup main saamne aa saktaa he
 There are three basic types of cigar cutters

 Cigars can be lit using butane filled lighters
 beauten rangahin or gandhhin hota he or yah acchhee tarah bahut halke flavor, agar koi ho, ke saath jalataa he
 Use of matches in fluid-filled lighters and papers is not recommended as they can affect the taste

 They are treated with sulfur and not soaked and hence smoke is not affected by chemicals
 dhaatu kii nalikaaon main pack kiye gaye cigaron ko aam taur par deodaar kii ek patali parat se lapeta jaataa he
 It can be used to burn cigars, which removes the problem of lighters or matches that affect the flavor
 cigar ke prayek brands or prakaar kaa swaad alag-alag hota he
 Since the wrapper does not completely determine the flavor of the cigar, darker wrappers have a sweetness to them while lighter wrappers generally have a "relatively dry" flavor
 cigar chaahe halkaa, madhyam yaa puraa bharaa hua ho, gunvattta ke saath iskaa koi sambandh nahin hota he
 Some of the words used to describe the flavor and color of a cigar include: spicy, papy, sweet, harish, burnt, green, earthy, woodsy, cocoa, roasted, aged, nutty, creamy, sedar, oak, chevy , Frutti and leather
 cigar kaa dhuaan jise shaayad hi kabhi saans ke jariye andar liya jaataa he, yah tambaaku ke swaad ke saath-saath anya swaadon kii baarikiyon kaa ehsaas detaa he
 The aroma of cigar smoke is influenced by many different things: the type of tobacco, the quality of the cigar, the taste involved, the age and humidity, the method of production and many other things
 a better cigar tastes completely different from the cigarette smoke inhaled
 jab dhuen ko saans ke jariye andar liya jaataa he, jaisaa ki aam taur par cigarette ke maamle main hota he, tambaaku ke swaad ko dhuen kii uttejnaa kii tulana main kam mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he

 kai logon ko cigar ke dhuen kii gandh naapsand hoti he or ek cigar pine vaale ko unhen thes pahunchaane se bachane ke prati vishesh rup se saavdhaan rahanaa vinamrata kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 This smell settles in the smoker's breath which needs consumer products that can give breath to freshness
 Smoke is produced by incomplete combustion of tobacco during which at least three types of chemical reactions occur: pyrolysis breaks down organic molecules into normal molecules, pyrosynthesis converts these newly formed particles into such chemicals
 Which are basically non-existent and distillation converts compounds like nicotine from tobacco to smoke
 tambaaku ke prayek gram ke dhumrapaan ke liye ek cigar takreeban 120-140 milligram carbon dioxide, 40-60 milligram carbon monooxide, 3-4 milligram isoprin, hydrogen synide or asitaldihide main se prayek kii 1 milligram maatra or choti-choti matraaon main volatile en -nitrasamins or volatile carbonic compounds ke large spectrum ke saath agyaat chizon kii vistrut sanrachana kaa utsarjan karata he
 Cigar smoke contains pyridines, arguably the most responsible for odor-causing chemicals and stimulant odors

 Cigar smoke is much more alkaline than cigarette smoke and therefore quickly dissolves and is easily absorbed by the mucous membrane of the mouth, allowing the smoker to easily absorb nicotine without inhaling it
 cigaron ko ardrata ke jis str par rakhaa jaataa he uske anusaar kaaphi had tak iske swaad main bhinnata hoti he
 The taste of a cigar is believed to be best developed when it is stored at a relative humidity of about 68–74% and a temperature of 64 F
 An ideal rate of humidity helps the cigar burn evenly
 iske vipareet shushk cigar najuk hote hai or teji se jal jate hai jabaki nam cigar ek samaan rup se nahin jalaate hai or inkaa swaad bahut adhik amleey ho jaataa he
