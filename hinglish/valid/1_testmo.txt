 Varuna is a major deity of Hinduism
 pracheen vaidic dharm main unka sthaan bahut hi mahatvapurn tha par vedon main uskaa rup itnaa amoort hai ki uskaa prakritik chithran mushkil he
 It is believed that the status of Varuna is ancient compared to other Vedic deities, that is why in the Vedic age, Varuna is not a sign of any natural contribution
 agni va indra kii apeksha varun ko sambodhit sookhton kii maatra bahut kam he phir bhi uskaa mahatv kam nahin he
 Indra is known as a great warrior, so Varuna is considered to be a great feeder of moral strength, he is a nurturer of Rit

 In most of the verses of the Rig Veda, forgiveness has been prayed for the sins committed by Varuna
 varun ko anya devataaon jaise indra aadi ke saath bhi varnit kiya gaya he
 The culmination of devotional spirit is seen in prayers related to Varuna

 He was given the title of "asura", meaning that he was different from the group of "gods"

 He is considered by historians that the Asura Varuna is called "ahura Mazda" in Zoroastrianism

 Such an old and so rich tradition of music is found in only a few countries

 After the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, a stage of Vedic music began in which the worship of God was performed with the chanting of hymns and chants in the style of music
 iske atirikt do bhartiya mahakavyon - ramayana or mahabharat kii rachana main sangeet kaa mukhya prabhaav rahaa
 There has been a tremendous change in the style and method of music in India from the Cultural period to the modern era
 bhartiya sangeet ke itihaas ke mahaan sangeetkaaron jaise ki swami haridas, tansen, amir khusro aadi ne bhartiya sangeet kii unnati main bahut yogadan kiya he jisaki kirti ko pandit ravi shankar, bhimsen gururaj joshi, pandit jasraj, prabhaa atre, sultan khan aadi jaise sangeet premiyon ne aaj ke yug main bhi kaayam rakhaa hua he
 In Indian music, it is believed that the original motivators of music are Shiva and Saraswati
 iskaa taatpary yahi jaan padataa he ki maanav itani ucch kala ko bina kisi daivi prerana ke, keval apane bal par, viksit nahin kar saktaa
 In the Vedic era 'music' had made a place in the society
 sabase pracheen granth ‘rugveda’ main aaryo ke aamod-pramod kaa mukhya saadhan sangeet ko bataaya gaya he
 The invention of many vadas is also told in the time of Rigveda
 ‘yajurveda’ main sangeet ko anek logon kii aajeevika kaa saadhan bataaya gaya, phir gaan pradhan veda ‘samaveda’ aayaa, jise sangeet kaa mul granth mana gaya
 'samaveda' mentions three accented vowels and seven musical vowels
 ‘samaveda’ kaa gaan mesopotamia, faildia, akkad, sumer, baveru, asur, sur, jerusalem, iran, arab, phinishia va misr ke dharmik sangeet se paryaapt maatra main miltaa-julata tha
 In the 'ramayana' text of the later Vedic period, there is a description of the songs of instruments like bheri, dundabhi, veena, mridang and ghada, etc
, then in the 'mahabharata' everyone is affected by the magical effect of Krishna's flute
 agyatavaas ke dauraan arjuna ne uttara ko sangeet-nrity sikhaane hetu brihannalaa kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 In addition to texts from the mythological period like 'taittiriya Upanishad', 'aitareya Upanishad', 'shatapatha Brahmana', 'yajnavalkya-ratna Pradipika', 'pratibhashyapradeep' and 'naradaiya Shiksha' also give us an introduction to the music of that time
 chauthi shatabdi main bharat muni ne ‘naatyashaastra’ ke chha: adhyyon main sangeet par hi charchaa kii
 In this, the description of various instruments, their origin, the ways of playing them, vowels, verses, rhythms and various periods have been written in detail
 is granth main bharat muni ne gayakon or vaadakon ke gunon or dosha par bhi khulkar likhaa he
 Later six ragas 'bhairav', 'hindol', 'kaishik', 'deepak', 'shrirag' and 'medha' came in the campaign
 paanchavin shatabdi ke aasapaas matang muni dwaara rachit mahatvapurn granth ‘vrihadadeshi’ se pataa chalata he ki us samay tak log raagon ke bare main jaanane lage the
 Matang Muni called the ragas sung by the people and played the 'rhaga Rashdi' to explain the rules of the indigenous ragas
 matang hi pehle vyakti the jinhone acchhee tarah se soch-vichaar kar paaya ki chaar yaa paanch swaron se kam main raag ban hi nahin saktaa
 Panini's 'ashtadhyayi' also mentions many musical instruments like mridang, jhajhar, hukaak and many things related to singers and dancers
 saatvin–aathvin shatabdi main ‘naradiya shiksha’ or ‘sangeet makrand’ kii rachana hui
 In 'sangeet Makaranda' they are divided into different sections according to the vocals used in the raga and the ragas are also thought of seriously at the time of singing
 gyarahavin shatabdi main musalmaan apane saath faras kaa sangeet laae
 The combination of his and our music practices changed Indian music significantly
 us daur ke raja-maharaja bhi sangeet-kala ke premi the or duusare sangitagnon ko aashray dekar unki kala ko nikhaarane-sanvaarane main madad karte the
 There were 36 musicians in the court of Emperor Akbar
 usee daur ke tansen, baijubaavaraa, ramdaas va tanrang khan ke naam aaj bhi charchit hai
 In the court of Jahangir, there were musicians named Khurramdad, Makkhu, Chattar Khan and Vilas Khan
 kaha jaataa he ki shahjahan to khud bhi acha gaate the or gayakon ko sone-chaandi ke sikkon se taulwakar inam diya karte the
 Another emperor of the Mughal dynasty, Muhammad Shah Rangeela, is still found in many old songs
 gwalior ke raja maansingh bhi sangeet premi the
 It was during his time that the special style of music 'dhrupad' developed
 12veen shatabdi main sangitajna jayadev ne 'gitgovind' naamak sanskrit granth likhaa, ise sakaaran ‘ashtapadi’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the thirteenth century, Pandit Sharngadeva composed 'sangeetratnakara'
 is granth main apane daur ke prachlit sangeet or bharat va matang ke samay ke sangeet kaa gahan adhyayan miltaa he
 Being composed in seven chapters, this useful text is also called 'weekly'
 shaarangdev dwaara rachit ‘sangeet ratnakar’ ke atirikt chaudaavin shatabdi main vidyaarany dwaara ‘sangeet saar’, pandrahavin shatabdi main lochan kavi dwaara ‘raag tarangini’, solahavin shatabdi main pundaree vitthal dwaara ‘sadragachandroday’, ramamatya dwaara ‘swarmel kalanidhi’, satrahavin shatabdi main hridaynarayan dev dwaara ‘hriday prakaash’ va ‘hriday kauthukam’, vyankatmakhi dwaara ‘chaturdardiprakashika’, ahobal dwaara‘sangeet parijaat’, damodar pandit dwaara ‘sangeet darpan,’ bhavabhatta dwaara ‘anup vilaas’ va ‘anup sangeet ratnakaar’, somnath dwaara 'ashtottarashttal lakshanam' or atharahavin shatabdi main shrinivas pandit dwaara ‘raag tatv vibodah’, tuljendra bhonsle dwaara ‘sangeet saramritam’ va ‘raag lakshaman’ granthon kii rachana hui
 Many saint poets-musicians such as Swami Haridas, Vitthal, Krishnadas, Tyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dixitar and Shyama Shastri also gave countless compositions to the music of North and South India
 kaha ja saktaa he ki bhartiya sangeet shatabdiyon ke prayaas va prayog kaa parinaam he
 The initial form of Indian music is found in the Vedas
 veda ke kaal ke vishay main vidwaanon main bahut matbhed he, kintu uskaa kaal isa se lagbhag 2000 varsh purv tha - isapar praaia: sabhi vidvan sahamat he
 Therefore, the history of Indian music is at least 4000 years old
 vedon main wan, veena or karkari ityadi tantu vaadyon kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the Avanandha instruments, Dudumbhi, Gargar etc
 are mentioned, Aghan or Aghati in the Ghanvadyas and Bakur, Nadi, Tunava, Conch etc
 in the Sushir instruments
 yajurveda main 30wein cond ke 19wein or 20wein mantra main kai ] bajaanewaalon kaa ullekh he jisase prathit hota he ki us samay tak kai prakaar ke vaadyavadan kaa vyavsaay ho chalaa tha
 The most ancient music throughout the world is found in the Samaveda
 us samay "swar" ko "yama" kehete the
 Sama was so closely related to music that Sama began to be considered synonymous with vocals
 chhandogopanishad main yah baat prashnottar ke rup main spasht kii gai he
 "ka samno gaitriti? Swar iti hovach"
 arthath jo sam ke swar ko jaanata he use "swa" praapt hota he
 "self" is the voice of the material
 vaidic kaal main teen swaron kaa gaan 'samik' kehalaata tha
 It is known from the word "samik" that earlier "sam" was sung with three tones
 ye swar "ga re sa" the
 Gradually the songs began to be four, five, six and seven
 chah or saat swaron ke to bahut hi kam sam milte hai
 More "sam" are found in three to five vowels
 sam ke yamon kii jo sangyaayen hai unase unki prapti ke kram kaa pataa chalata he
 As we have said, the materialists apparently got the first "gods" of these three yams
 inkaa naam hua - pratham, dwitiya, tritiy
 These were all in descending order
 inke ananthar ni kii prapti hui jiskaa naam chaturth hua
 Most of the items are found in these four vowels
 in chaaron swaron ke naam sankhyatmak shabdon main he
 The names of the vowels found in them are expressed by descriptive words
 isse is kalpana kii pushti hoti he ki inaki prapti baad main hui
 a high tone "medium" was also derived from "gandhara", which was named "krushta"
 nishad se ek neeche kaa swar jab praapt hua to uskaa naam "mand" padaa
 When another voice below it was received, its name was "atishvara or Atishvaraya"
 iskaa arth he swaran karne kii antim seemaa
 The set of possible order of possible vowels is called "sama" in music
 europea sangeet main ise "scale" kehete hai
 We can see that gradually the whole gram of material developed in this way- yah ham pehle hi kah chuke hai ki sam kaa gram avarohi kram kaa tha
 Below we give the contents and their modern nouns in a table: samgaan ke praaia: saat bhaag hote hai - hunkaar athwa hinkaar, prastaav, aadi udgith, pratihaar, updrav or nidhan
 Its lead singer is called Udgata
 udgaata ke do sahaayak gayak hote hai jinako prastota or pratiharta kehete hai
 The anthem begins with a hinkar or hunkar, which is chanted by the originator, presenter and participant
 uske mukhya bhaag ko udgaath kehete hai
 It is sung by Udgata
 iske ananthar ek bhaag hota he jise pratihaar kehete hai
 It is sung by the defendant
 iske ananthar jo bhaag aata he use updrav kehete hai
 It is sung by Udgata
 nidhan yaa antim bhaag ko udgaata, prastota or pratiharta teenon ek saath milakar aate hai
 In the end, everyone chants together Pranav i
e
 Omkar
 samgaan kii apni vishisht swarlipi he
 There is a misconception among the people that Indian music did not have a melody and it is the delivery of European music
 sabhi vedon ke saswar paath ke liye udaatt, anudaatt or swarit ke vishisht chihr hai kintu samaveda ke gaan ke liye rishiyon ne ek puri swarlipi taiyaar kar lee thi
 This was the oldest vocal script written around the world
 sansar bhar main yah sabamein puraani swarlipi he
 Some lyrical scripts of Sumer's anthem are also found here
 kintu uskaa koi sahitya nahin miltaa
 Therefore, nothing specific can be said about it
 kintu sam ke saare mantra swarlipi main likhe milte hai, isliye ve aaj bhi usee rup main gaae ja sakate hai
 Valmiki Ramayana finds mention of instruments and caste songs such as Bheri, Dundubhi, Mridang, Patah, Ghat, Panava, Dindim, Adanwar, Veena etc
 jati, raag kaa adirup he
 In the Mahabharata, there is mention of Sapta Vowels and Gandhara Gram

 usamen "yaal" naamak tantri vaadya kaa bhi ullekh he

 dakshin ke ek buddha naatak silappadigaran main bhi kuch sangitvishyak baton kaa samavesh he
 It mentions instruments like veena, yal, flute, patah, etc
 us samay ke prachlit raagon kaa bhi isamen ullekh he
 In the same time a Jain dictionary called "tivakaram" has also given some information about music
 isamen sampurna shadav or odav raagon kaa ullekh tathaa he tathaa shrutiyon or saat swaron kaa bhi varnan he
 The discussion of music in Kalidasa's plays has come up in this way
 malvicagnimitra main to sangeet main do shishyon kii puri pratiyogita hi dikhalaai gai he
 The most ancient treatise on Indian music is Bharata's Natyashastra
 bharat ke kaal ke vishay main vivaad he
 It is a collection book
 isliye iske kaal kaa nirnay karnaa or kathin ho gaya he
 Its time was around B
C
 500 to 400 AD
 naatyashaastra main shruti, swar, gram, moorchana, jati or taal kaa vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 Bharata considers the Srutis to establish the vowel
 unhone 4 shrutiyon ke antaraal par shadj rakhaa he, uske ananthar 3 shrutiyon ke antaraal par rishabh, 2 shrutiyon ke antaraal par gandhar, 4 shrutiyon ke antaraal par madhyam, phir 4 shrutiyon ke antaraal par pancham, 3 shrutiyon ke antaraal par dhaivat or 2 shrutiyon ke antaraal par nipad rakhaa he
 Thus, the total number of Shrutis is 22
 bharat ne shadjagram or madhyamgram aise do gram maane hai
 The interval given to Shrutis above is that of Shatj Gram
 yah gram shadj se prarambh hota he
 Therefore, it got the name Sambhajagram
 jo gram madhyam se prarambh hota he uskaa naam he "madhyam gram"
 The middle village consists of Madhyam Chatu: Shruti, Pancham Trishruti, Dhaivat Chatushruti, Nishad Dwishruti, Conspiracy Chath: Shruti, Rishabh Trishruti, and Gandhara Dishruti
 gandhar gram bharat ko maanya nahin he
 Sculpting means emergence or brightness
 saat swaron ke kramyukt prayog kii sangya moorchana he 
 Bharata has considered seven statues in both Sikhj and Madhyam villages
 moorchanaayen "jati" gaan kaa aadhaar thim
 Specific vowels were called "castes" in particular types of cognition
 jisamen grah, ansh, taar, mandra, nyaas, apanyaas, alpatv, bahutv, shadvatv or auduvatv ke niyamon dwaara swarasannivesh kiya jaataa tha, vah "jati" kehalaata tha
 Jatigan is an indicator of the very advanced stage of music
 bharat ke samay main jatigaan paripurna avasthaa kaa suchak he
 In Bharata's time, the caste anthem had reached a perfect state
 jati hi raag kii janani he
 Bharata has also enumerated seven gramragas and states that they are born out of caste
 naatyashaastra main chachchatput, chachput athwa chanchuput, shatpitaputra athwa panchpani, sampatkeshtak, udbaddh athwa udghat taalon kaa ullekh he
 These were the rhythms of the 8, 6, 12, 12 and 6 quantities respectively
 tamilnadu ke kudumiumalai sthaan main ek utkeern lekh mila he jo sambhavat: 7veen i
 shatee kaa he
 It mentions seven castes, seven vowels and some Srutis, and the difference Gandhara and Kakli Nishad
 isse yah siddh hota he ki bharat main saatvin shatee tak sangeet kii paryaapt unnati ho chuki thi or uske mukhya vishay uttar se dakshin tak prasiddh or grahya ho chuke the
 Some people also consider Narada teachings around the 7th century
 is granth ke dekhne se to yahi pataa chalata he ki yah bharat ke naatyashaastra se adhik pracheen he
 There is mention of Shruti, Swar, Gram in it, Vedic music and Gatravina also have a detailed description
 naatyashaastra main vaidic sangeet kaa varnan nahin he

 In the 18th century, the houses were in some way the centers of formal music education, but with the emergence of the British rule, the outline of the houses started to relax somewhat because the administrators of Western culture gave more recognition to scientific progress than art and this culture rather than spirituality
 Materialism was dominant

 Then Moses came to the people to a halt and in front of them said these things which the Lord had commanded Moses
 sab logon ne ek saath musa ko uttar diya- 'prabhu kii sab aajnaaon kaa ham paalan karenge
 ' tab ishwar ne musa se kaha ki vah logon ko tisare din ke liye taiyaar hone ko kahe
 That day God was going to give the Ten Commandments to the people
 logon ne apane vastra dhoe or khud ko taiyaar kiya or tisare din ve sinai parvat ke neeche aa gaye
 Then the thunder roared in full swing, lightning struck
 parvat hilne laga or ek sanghan megh pahaad par utraa or sara parvat dhank gaya
 God spoke to him from the cloud and gave him the Ten Commandments
 jab logon ne ishwar ko bolte suna to ve dar gaye or musa se chillaakar kaha- 'aap ham se baat kiijie anyathaa ham log mar jaayenge
 'moses replied-' Do not be afraid, God does not want to harm you
 vah chahta he ki tum uski aajnaaon ko maano or uske viruddh koi paap na karo
 'then Moses went to God on the mountain
 vahaan ishwar ne pathar kii do shilaon par das aagyaaen likhin or musa ko deen
 Following are the commands given by God: 1
 main prabhu tera ishwar hoon
 The Lord worships his God, no one except him
 2

 The village of Golabai provides evidence of a view of the Chilika region culture in three stages: the Neolithic Age, the Tamerlan Age and the Iron Age, the King of Kalinga, was known as the "lord of the Sea"
 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure situated outside of the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at ‘chhatragarh’ on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town's people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seat that had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 kimi north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important center of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra"
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed
 Fateh Muhammed in turn was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block
 Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and paints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects
 “gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train
 He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty
 It is because of the beauty that arrests him much”
 The lake is a tidal delta type ephemeral lake in an environment with changing climate

 Sharp changes in the direction of the coast in the north of the lake, strong winds blowing sand on the coast, long turn, the presence and absence of strong tides and river waves in various sub-regions are the reason for the development of this sea land

 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack, feed the lake
 61%) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non–perennial accounts for 39% )
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1
76 ghankilo meter including direct precipitation over the lake contributing 0

 Because of its rich biodiversity, Chilka Lake was chosen as a wetland of international importance in 1981 according to the Ramsar Manifesto, as the facts have shown: in varshon main, jhil ke paristhitiki tantra ko kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or iname se kuch khatre nimnlikhit he: The rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture of prawn has contributed significantly to the decline of the lakes fisheries and bird population
 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have "undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action ”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes

 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the Authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people’s representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the Government of India, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of “special problem grants” recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million 
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, bharat sarkaar, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was completed after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake ' s fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometers
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 Detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in preserving the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species are identified green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one –fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species identified are:
 Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent
 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, bharaten roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997–98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were spotted in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officials counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island in the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 km 2
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority’s updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk evolved exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British Rule, in 1897–98, the fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen’s cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulting in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 mass in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11, 878 mass during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha has issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Indiaand one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return towards the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were spotted in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 km 2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 October – January and May – June are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum of 600–700 per day during December – January
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanised boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands
 It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973
 It's the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season
 The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again
 The vast lake harbours 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants
 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector
 Chilka Lake is one of the best bird watching spots in India, and is also popular for fishing and angling
 Puri: This holy city is famous for the late 11th century built Jagannath temple
 The other major attraction here is the beach, from where you can witness the glorious sunrise and equally mesmerising sunset
 It’s said that a visit to Puri is incomplete without visiting Chilika Lagoon
 The Nirmaljhara Waterfall: This is an ideal place for pitching your picnic tent
 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 kimi from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake's natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata through National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 kimi by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 kimi from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake
 There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon
 Before entering into the Nalbana Bird Sanctuary one has to obtain an entry permit
 The entry permit has to be produced at entry / exit points, at check gates as and whenever requested by officers

 Without plate tectonics, Venus undergoes a cyclic process to disperse heat from its mantle in which the mantle temperature rise continues until it reaches the peak level necessary for the weakening of the layer
 Then, over a period of about 10 million years, pressure occurs on a large scale that completely recycles the crust

 Above the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets
 ye badal lagbhag 90% surya prakaash ko paravartit va bikherte he jo ki waapas antariksh main un par girtaa he or shukr kii sataha ke drishy prekshan ko rokte he
 The permanent covering of clouds means that even though the planet Venus is closer to the Sun than the Earth, the surface of Venus is not well lit
 badalon ke sheersh par kii 300 kimi / ghanta kii shaktishaalee hawaaen har chaar se paanch prithvi divaso main grah kaa chakkar lagaati he
 Venus's winds are up to 60 times its rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% of its rotation speed

 " 1967 main venera 4 ne shukr ke chumbakeey kshetra ko prithvi kii tulana main bahut kamjor paaya
 This magnetic field is induced by an interplay between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than an internal dynamo, like the inner core of the Earth
 shukr kaa chota sa prerit chumbakeey kshetra vayumandal ko brahmadia vikiran ke khilaaf naganya suraksha pradaan karata he
 This radiation may be the result of lightning discharge from cloud to cloud

 One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not currently cold, so the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature
 ek or sambhaavna ki iskaa kor pehle se hi puri tarah jam gaya he
 The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is currently unknown
 shukr ke irdagird durbal chumbakeey aavaran kaa matlab he saura vaayu grah ke bahya vayumandal ke saath sidhe sampark karti he
 Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are formed by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation

 This degradation process results in the loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, while maintaining high-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, in much the same way
 saura vaayu dwaara vayumandaleey ksharan grah ke gathan ke baad ke arabon varshon ke darmyaan jal ke khone kaa shaayad sabase bada kaaran bana
 This corrosion has increased the ratio of high-mass deuterium to low-mass hydrogen in the upper atmosphere by 150 times the ratio in the lower atmosphere

 In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported the Moon orbiting Venus, which was named from the Neith
 After the next 200 years, many sightings were reported
 But most were determined to be nearby stars

 When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, it is at its largest size and presents its "nav Kala"
 iske vayumandal ko grah ke chaaron ore ke apavartit prakaash ke prabhamandal dwaara ek doorabeen main dekha ja saktaa hai
 Venus's orbit is slightly tilted relative to the Earth's orbit; Therefore, when this planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun

 Transit could be viewed directly from multiple online outlets or locally with appropriate equipment and conditions
 pargaman kii purvavarti jodi disambar 1874 or disambar 1882 main hui; aagaamee jodi disambar 2117 or disambar 2125 main ghatit hogi
 Historically, the transit of Venus was important, as they have allowed astronomers to directly determine the size of the astronomical unit, as well as the size of the solar system, as seen by Horrocks in 1639 by Captain Cook's Eastern Australia
 The discovery of the coast was made possible when he traveled to Tahiti in 1768 after a voyage to observe Venus transit

 The planet Venus was recognized by ancient civilizations in both the "morning star" and "evening star" forms
 naam se hi purv samaj jaahir hoti he ki wein do alag-alag vasteen thi | ammisaduka kii shukr patalika, dinaankit 1581 ipu, unani samaj dikhaati he ki donon vastu ek hi thi
 Venus is referred to in this table as the "bright queen of the sky" and this view has been supported with detailed observations

 The Romans have designated the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer and the evening aspect as Vesper
 shukr ke pargaman ke pratham darj avlokan kaa sanyog 4 disambar 1639 ko yirmayaah horokes dwaara, unke mitra wiliam crebtry ke saath-saath, bana tha
 In the early 17th century, when the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei made his first observation of the planet, he found it showing the moon-like arts, from crescent to ornate to full moon and vice versa
 jab yah surya se sarvaadhik dur hota he apana ardhachandra rup dikhaata he or jab surya ke sabase najadik hota he yah arddh chandrakaar yaa poornachandra kii tarah dikhataa he
 This was possible only if Venus orbited the Sun and was one of the first observations to explicitly refute Ptolemy's geocentric model, in which the solar system was centered and the Earth was at the center
 shukr ke vayumandal kii khoj 1761 main roosi bahushrut mikhail lomonosov dwaara hui thi
 The atmosphere of Venus was observed in 1790 by the German astronomer Yohan Schroter
 shroter ne paaya ki grah jab ek patala ardhchandra tha, katori 180° se adhik tak vistaarit hui
 He correctly surmised that this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere

 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 20 veen sadi tak shukr ke bare main thodi bahut or khoj hui thi
 Its nearly featureless DSK gave no clue as to what its surface might be

 The first ultraviolet observations were made in the 1920s when Frank E
 Ross found that ultraviolet photographs showed much more detailed detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation
 unhone suzav diya aisa nichle pile vaataavaran ke saath uske upar ke pakshabh megh ke atyadhik ghaneypan kii vajah se tha
 Spectroscopy observations in the 1900s gave the first clue about the rotation of Venus
 vesto slifer ne shukr se nikle prakaash ke dopler shift ko maapne kii koshish kii, lekin paaya ki vah kisi bhi ghurnan kaa pataa nahin laga sake
 He speculated that the planet must have a very long rotation period
 1950 ke dashak main baad ke kaary ne dikhaaya ki ghurnan pratigaami tha
 The Venus's radar observations were first made in the 1960s, providing the first measurements of the rotation period, close to modern values
 1970 ke dashak main radar prekshanon ne pehali baar shukr kii sataha ko vistrut rup se ujagar kiya
 Pulsions of radio waves were transmitted to the planet using a 300-meter radio telescope at the Eresibo Observatory, and the echoes detected two highly reflective regions designated from the alpha and beta regions

 In fact, Mariner 5 was originally created as a backup to Mariner 4, which is related to Mars
 But when the mission was successful, the vehicle was converted for the Venus mission
 Its equipment pairs were more sensitive than those on the Mariner 2
 vishesh rup main iske radio prachhaadan prayog ne shukr ke vayumandal kii sanrachana, dabaav or ghanatv ke data preshit kiye
 The combined data of the Venera 4-mariner 5 were analyzed over the next year in a series of formal conversations by a joint soviet-american science team
 yah antariksh sahyog kaa ek praarambhik udhaaharan he
 Following the lessons learned from Venera 4, the Soviet Union launched the twin vehicles Venera 5 and Venera 6 in a five-day interval in January 1969
 shukr se inkaa saamana usee saal ek din ke aad main 16 va 17 may ko hua
 The crushing pressure limit of the vehicle was increased to 25 bars and equipped with small parachutes to achieve a faster descent
 baad ke, shukr ke haal ke vayumandaleey modelon ne sataha ke dabaav ko 75 or 100 baar ke bich hone kaa suzav diya tha
 Therefore, there was no hope for these vehicles to survive on the surface
 After transmitting atmospheric data for a short interval of 50 minutes, both the ships were destroyed at an altitude of about 20 km before hitting the surface of the night side of Venus
 venera 7 ko grah ke sataha se nikle data ko waapas laane ke prayaas ke liye pesh kiya gaya
 It was manufactured with a strong descent module capable of withstanding 180 bar pressure
 modul ko pravesh se pehle thanda kiya gaya, saath hi 35 minute ke tej avataran ke liye ise ek vishesh rup se sametane vaale parachute ke saath las kiya gaya tha
 It continued to enter the atmosphere on 15 December 1970, while the parachute is believed to have partially exploded and the probe hit the surface with a loud, but not fatal

 The Venera program continued with Venera 8
 After entering the atmosphere on 22 July 1972, it sent data from the surface for 50 minutes
 Venera 9 entered the atmosphere on 22 October 1975
 Whereas Venera 10 entered the atmosphere exactly three days after that on 25 October and sent the first pictures of Venus landscape
 Both vehicles presented very different scenarios in their immediate vicinity

 Meanwhile, the United States sent Mariner 10 on a gravitational catapult trajectory whose path traveled through Venus to the planet Mercury
 5 farvari 1974 ko meriner 10 shukr se 5,790 kimi najadik se gujara or 4,000 se zyada tasveeron ke saath waapas lautaa
 It had achieved the best pictures ever, showing Venus almost featureless in visible light

 Both Venera 13 and 14 analyzed on-board soil samples with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and attempted to measure soil compaction with enthalpy collisions
 venera 14 ne, haalanki, khud se alag ho chuke apane hi cameren ke lens kaa dhakkan gira diya or isaki pravishthi mitti ko chhune me vifal rahi
 The time to close the Venera program came in October 1983, when Venera 15 and Venera 16 were placed in orbit for mapping the terrain of Venus with synthetic aperture radar
 1985 main soviet sangh ne, shukr or usee varsh andruni soramandal se hokar guzar rahe heley dhoomaketu, se mili avasar kaa sanyukt abhiyaanon se bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 On 11 and 15 June 1985, two spacecraft of the Vega program on the road to Haley dropped one Venera-style entry and a balloon-supported aerobot was released within the upper atmosphere
 gubbaaron ne 53 kimi ke kareeb ek santulit oonchai hasil kii, jahaan dabaav or taapmaana tulanaatmak rup se prithvi kii sataha par jitna hota hai
 Both remained operational for about 46 hours and found Venus's atmosphere more turbulent than previously believed
 The turbulent atmosphere here refers to high winds and powerful convection chambers

 Pioneer Venus and Venera provided better solutions
 sanyukt rajya america ke magalan yaan ko radar se shukr ke satahi maanchitran ke liye ek mishan ke saath 4 may 1989 koprakshepit kiya gaya tha
 The high-clarity images obtained during its 41⁄2-year activities surpassed all earlier maps and were comparable to visible light photographs of other planets

 Settlement negotiations take place in trade, non-profit organizations, government branches, legal proceedings, between countries and in personal situations such as marriages, divorces, raising children and everyday life
 is vishay ke adhyayan ko samjhauta vaarta kaa siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Professional negotiators are often experts, such as union negotiators, leverage procurement negotiators, peace negotiators, hostage negotiators, or they may also work under another designation, such as a diplomat, legislator, or broker
 angrezi kaa shabd "nigociation" ko latin abhivyakti, "negotiatus" se liya gaya he, jo negotiare kaa bhoot kridant he jiskaa arth he "vyapaar ko aage badhanaa"
 "negotium" kaa vastutah arth he "fursat nahin"
 Conciliation negotiations typically reveal themselves with a trained negotiator acting on behalf of a particular organization or position
 isaki tulana madhyasthata ke saath kii ja sakati he jahaan ek tatasth tritiy paksh donon pakshon ke tarkon ko sunata he or donon dalon ke bich ek samjhauta karaane main madad karne kaa prayaas karata he
 It also relates to the panchayat, as in a legal proceeding, with both parties arguing for the merits of their "case" and then a panch decides the outcome for both parties
 samjhauta vaarta ke aavashyak bhaagon kii behatar samaj viksit karne ke liye, use vibhajit karne ke kai bhinn tareeke hai
 a perspective of negotiation involves three basic elements: process, behavior and substance
 The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties in the negotiations, the strategy and sequence used by the parties, and the stages in which all these will flourish
 Behavior reflects the relationship between these parties, the dialogue between them and the styles they adopt
 padaarth kaa taatpary us chiz se he jiske liye ye dal samjhauta vaarta karte hai: agenda, mudde, vikalp or samjhauta jis par ant main pahunchaa jaataa he
 Another approach to negotiation involves 4 elements: strategy, process and tools and tactics
 The strategy includes the top level goals - usually which include relationships and end results
 Processes and tools include the steps to be taken and the roles to be adopted both during the preparation and negotiation of negotiations with other parties
 The device includes more detailed statements and actions and reactions given to the statements and actions of others
 Some people add persuasion and influence to it, saying that they have become integral to the success of modern-day settlement negotiations and therefore should not be left out
 kushal vaartakar, vibhinn kismon kii yuktiyon kaa prayog kar sakate hai, jisaki vyapak seemaa vaarta sammohan se lekar maangon ko sidhe-sapaat tareeke se prastut karne tak yaa adhik bhraamak drushtikon ke antargat, jaise cheri picking, purv shart kii sthapana tak faili ho sakati he
 Threats and salute tactics can also play a role in turning the outcome of settlement negotiations
 ek anya samjhauta vaarta yukti he bura aadmi / acha aadmi he
 Bad guy / good guy tactic is when a negotiator uses anger and intimidation as the bad guy
 doosraa vaartakar ek achche aadmi ke rup main vichaarsheel or samajhadaar kii tarah kaam karata he
 The good man blames the bad guy for all difficulties in trying to get concession and compromise from his adversary
 vakaalat drushtikon main, ek kushal vaartakar aam taur par samjhauta vaarta main ek dal ke vakil ke rup main kaary karata he or us dal ke liye sabase anukool sambhavit parinaamon ko praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In this process, the negotiator tries to determine the minimum result that the other party is willing to accept and then adjusts their demands accordingly
 vakaalat drushtikon main, ek safal samjhauta vaarta tab maani jaati he jab vaartakar, anpane dal dwaara icchit sabhi yaa adhikansh parinaamon ko, duusare dal ko samjhauta vaarta ko khandit karne ke liye bina bhadakaae, praapt karne main sakasham hota he, jab tak ki samjhauta vaarta kaa sarvottam vikalp sweekaarya naa ho jaae
 Traditional settlement negotiations are sometimes called win-lose because of the notion of a fixed "pie", that is, one person's gain results in another person's loss
 yah keval tabhi sach he, jab keval ek hi mudde ko hal kiye jane kii zarurat he, jaise ki ek saral bikri samjhauta vaarta main keemat
 During the 1960s, Gerard I
 Nirenberg recognized the role of negotiation in resolving disputes in personal, business and international relations
 He published The Art of Negotiating, in which he states that the negotiators' philosophy determines which approach the negotiation will take
 His Everybody Vince philosophy assures that all parties benefit from the negotiation process, which produces far more successful outcomes than the opposing view of "the winner takes away everything"
 gating tu yas, harvard vaarta pariyojna ke hisse ke rup main roger fisher or wiliam uri dwaara prakashit kii gai
 The approach of this book, referred to as theoretical negotiation, is sometimes called mutual benefit bargaining
 aapasi laabh drushtikon ko prabhavi dhang se paryaavarniya sthitiyon main or saath hi saath shram sambandhon main lagu kiya gaya he jahaan dal samjhauta vaarta ko "samasya samaadhaan" ke rup main swaroopit karte hai
 If many issues are discussed, differences in the preferences of the parties make the "sabki jai-jai" negotiation possible
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek shram samjhauta vaarta main shram sangh, vetan vruddhi kii bajaay jeevika suraksha ko zyaada tarjeeh de sakate hai
 If the employer has opposite preferences, then there is a possibility of a deal which would be beneficial for both the parties
 Therefore such negotiation is not an anti-zero-profit game
 saidhantik samjhauta vaarta vidhi, chaar mukhya charnon se nirmit he: samasya se logon ko pruthak karnaa, hiton par dhyaan dena, na ki padon par, kuch karne kaa faisla lene se pehle vibhinn sambhaavnaaon ko utpann karnaa or jor dena ki parinaam, vastuparak maanak par aadhaarit hon
 There are many more scholars who have contributed to the field of negotiation, including Holly Schroth and Timothy Deonotte at UC Berkeley, Gerard E
 Watzke at Tulane University, Sara Kobb at George Mason University, Len Riskin at the University of Missouri, Harvard Howard Rifa, Robert Mersey and Lawrence Susskind at MIT and Adil Najam and j at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Swald Salacuse
 samjhauta vaarta ke sabase prasiddh drushtaant main shaayad naarangi par hui ek charchaa shaamil he
 The most obvious approach was to cut it in half and each person would get their fair share
 But, when the negotiators started talking to each other about their interests, a better solution to the problem became apparent
 apane naashte ke liye naarangi ke ras ke icchhuk vyakti ne vah bhaag le liya or murabba banane ke icchhuk vyakti ne chhilka vaala hissaa le liya
 Both sides got more in the end
 Neither of the two agreements is particularly constructive
 naarangi kaa drushtaant tab rachanaatmakataa kii ek kahani ban jaataa jab donon paksh naarangi kaa ek ped lagane yaa ek bagichaa lagane main sahyog karne kaa faisla karte
 thik isi tarah, bowing apane nae 787 drimliner ke liye mishrit plastic ke daine kharidta he jise japani aapurtikartaaon dwaara dizine or banaaya gaya he or phir purna kiye hue 787 ko japani sarkaar dwaara pradutt acchhee sabsidi ke saath waapas japani airlinon ko bechata he
 This is what creativity means in dialogue
 In modern business schools, much is being learned about creative processes
 shaikshanik sammelnon or companiyon ke bordroom main "navachaar" ko charchit shabd bana kar paathyakram pesh kiye ja rahe hai or shodh-nibandho kaa prastaav kiya ja rahaa he
 And, the more it is heard about innovation and creative processes, the more it is appreciated and which the Japanese approach to negotiation, naturally, uses all the techniques on which, in general, any creative process Emphasis is given in dialogue
 beshak, is tathy kaa ek gahari buniyadi vyakhya pradaan kii jaati he ki prakritik sansadhano kii kami or apekshaakrit algaav kii sthiti ke baavjood, kyon japani is tarah ke ek safal samaaj kaa nirmaan kar sake
 haalanki japani samaaj main bhi, beshak rachanaatmakataa ke raste main apni kuch baadhaaen hai - padanukram or samashtiwad do hai - tathaapi unhone samjhauta vaarta kii ek aisi style viksit kii jo kai myanon main is tarah kii anaavashyak pratikulata ko mitaa detii he
 In fact, the ten new rules advocated by Hernandez and Graham for global negotiations correspond well to the approach that is naturally seen in the Japanese: japani logon kii prathaon ke alaava, un vibhootiyon ko bhi shrey diya janaa chahie jinhone samjhauta vaartaon main rachanaatmakataa kii hameshaa se vakaalat kii he
 The advice of Howard Rifa and his colleagues is: 


 teams should think and plan informally together and jointly brainstorm what can be considered "dialogue" or "forethought"
 is praarambhik charan main pai ko kaise vibhajit karen, ise lekar donon paksh koi bhi samanvay, patibaddhta, yaa tark nahin karenge
roger fisher or wiliam uri ne gating tu yas main apane chauthe adhyay kaa sheershak diya, "inventing opshans for mutual gen"
 david lax or james sebenius, apni mahatvapurn nai kitaab 3d-nigociations main, gating tu yas se aage nikal jate hai or "rachanaatmak samjhaute" or "mahaan samjhaute" ke bare main charchaa karte hai
 Lawrence Susskind and his colleagues recommended "parallel informal negotiations" to build constructive dialogue outcomes
 These ideas should be kept at the forefront while talking about negotiation negotiations
 Talking of "making deals" and "solving problems" the sector is generally still stuck in the past
 yahaan tak ki "vin-vin" jaise shabdon kaa prayog, puraane pratispardhi soch ke avshesh ko hi pradarshit karata he
 The point is that a dialogue is not something that can be won or lost and the competitive metaphor restricts creativity
 samasya-samaadhaan roopak bhi yahi karata he
 Thus, the first rule of negotiation is: Accept only constructive results! Linda Lawrence of ideaworks, a Newport Beach consulting firm, has developed a most useful list of ways to generate more ideas during negotiations: japani pathakon ke liye, isamen se kaaphi kuch parichit hoga
 japaniyon ko shaareerik nikatataa main laana aasaan he, ve sahasrabdiyon se usee prakaar rah rahe hai
 Japanese companies do not have so many marketing experts who are different from engineers and who are different from finance analysts
 prayek prabandhak ne ho saktaa he kai kaaryaatmak kshetron main kaam kiya ho, jo "chimney prabhaav" ko simit karata he jise aksar upekshajanak lahaze main america fermon ke saath joda jaataa he
 Physical movement - portrays the beginning of the day in the typical Japanese factory
 aisa prathit hota he ki japani, chote samoohon main sabase acha kaam karte hai
 Silence is definitely fine
 The Japanese invented karaoke
 It is difficult for Japanese to criticize others, especially foreigners
 The use of visuals and overall thinking occurs naturally in the Japanese
 Gaps are also a common process for Japanese
 The Japanese will work better with people they are familiar with
 yah bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki inamen se kuch takneekein japani vaartakaron ko videshi lagengi
 udhaaharan ke liye, japaniyon ke liye vividhta majboot saathi nahin he - uddeshypurna tareeke se mahilaon or vividhta ke anya tatwon ko unke samoohon main jodna ajeeb prathit hoga
 baharhaal, ve do pramukh chizein jise japani log, samjhauta vaarta main karte hai jise anya log bhi sikh sakate hai or unhen siikhnaa chahie: pehla, is grah par japani, jaankaree shoonyata ke champion hai
 They keep their mouth shut and let everyone else talk
 is prakaar, kisi bhi anya samaaj kii tulana main, ve kaaphi had tak apane antarrashtriya sahyogiyon kii vividhta kaa upyog karte hai
 It is often criticized as copying and borrowing, but being open to everyone's ideas has always been important to creativity and human progress
 haalanki, duniya bhar ke baaki logon kii tarah japani bhi jati-kendrit hai, ve abhi bhi videshi vichaaron kaa bahut adhik sammaan karte hai
 Second, the Japanese will only work with the dolphins when they have a choice
 Confidence and creativity are concomitant
 or, ve apane videshi samakakshon ko adhik sahyogaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karne ke liye prashikshit karte hai taaki unhi kaa bhala ho sake
 freemont, CA main choti kaaron ke nirmaan ke liye toyota or general motors ke bich 25 saal kaa sanyukt udhyam ko ek pramukh udhaaharan ke rup main dekhiye
 Compliance with the principles of creativity would be appropriate in at least three points during negotiations
 Howard Rifa's suggestion above mentioned that they should be used in pre-negotiation meetings
 Second, others advocate their use in case of deadlock
 udhaaharan ke liye, peru main rio urubamba prakritik gas pariyojna sambandhit samjhauta vaarta main shaamil companiyaan or paryaavaran gut ek aise mode par pahunche jo us samay ek na sulajhane vaali vikatsthiti jaan padi - pracheen jangal se guzarane vaali sadaken or ek vishaal pipeline, paristhitiki aapadaa hogi
 rachanaatmak hal kya he? ek apatati manch ke rup main doordaraj ke gas kshetra ke bare main sochie, pipe line ko bhumigat le jaaie or aavashyaktaanusaar karmiyon or upkarnon ko vayumarg se le jaaie
 Finally, even when negotiators arrive at a "yes", a scheduled review of the agreement will actually lead from "yes" to constructive results
 Perhaps such a review can be scheduled six months after the implementation of the agreement
 lekin, mudda yah he ki is vishay par rachanaatmak charchaa ke liye alag se samay avashya rakhana chahie ki sambandhon ke liye taiyaar logon ko kaise sudhara jaae? is tarah ke kisi satr kaa jor hameshaa nae vichaaron ko saamne akhane par hona chahie - is sawaal kaa jawaab ki "hamane kis bare main nahin sochaa?" Shell has identified five styles / responses to the negotiations
 Individuals may often have a strong inclination towards multiple styles; The style used during a settlement negotiation depends on the context and the interests of the other party, among other factors
 iske alaava, samay ke saath style bhi badal sakati he
 Clearly, these two methods are fundamentally different from negotiation, and will require a different approach
 Ignoring it can be disastrous for results, but it is all too often
 kyonki vitaran drushtikon main prayek vaartakar, pai ke sabase bade sambhav tukade ke liye sangharsh karata he, yah bilkul uchit ho saktaa he - kuch khaas simaaon ke bheetar - ki duusare paksh ko ek saathi kii bajaay ek virdohi ke rup main dekha jaae or apekshaakrit thodaa kathor rukh apanaaya jaae
 lekin yah rukh us haalat main anuchit hoga jab prayaas aisi kisi vyavastha par muhar lagane kaa ho rahaa ho jo donon pakshon ke sarvshereshth hit main ho
 yadi donon jitate hai, to is baat kaa mahatv goud he ki kise adhik phayda hua
 a good agreement is not one that has maximum benefits, but one that has optimal benefits
 But the implication of this is not at all that we should leave our profits just like this
 But a collaborative attitude will pay dividends regularly
 The benefit that is gained is not at the cost of the other, but with him
 samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya main jazbaat ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate he, haalanki yah haal ke varshon main hi hua ki unke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya ja rahaa he
 Emotion has the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation
 vaartaon ke dauraan, yah faisla ki ab samjhaute par muhar lagaai jaae yaa nahin, aanshik rup se bhaavnaatmak karkon par tikaa hota he
 Negative emotions can lead to intense and even irrational behavior and can result in conflict, ruining settlement negotiations, but can be helpful in getting concessions
 duusari ore, sakaaratmak bhavanaaen aksar ek samjhaute tak pahunchane ko aasaan kar detii hai or sanyukt laabh ko adhiktam karne main madad karti hai, lekin yah riyaayaten hasil karne main bhi sahaayak ho sakati hai
 Positive and negative discrete emotions can be demonstrated to affect actions and relational outcomes, and may play a different role across cultural boundaries
 bhav prabhaav :swabhaavgat bhav, samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ke vibhinn charnon ko prabhavit karte hai: kin ranneetiyon ke prayog kii yojana banaai gai he, koun si ranneetiyaan vastav main chuni gayi, vah nazariyaa jisase anya dal or unke iraadon ko dekha jaataa he, ek samjhaute par pahunchane kii unki ichha or vaarta kaa antim parinaam
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek yaa ek se adhik pakshon kii sakaaratmak prabhavakaarita or nakaaratmak prabhavakaarita, bilkul bhinn parinaamon ko janm de sakati he
 Before the negotiation process begins, people with a positive attitude have more confidence, and a higher tendency to plan the use of a collaborative strategy
 samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan, jo vaartakar ek sakaaratmak manobhaav main rahete hai ve is sahabhaagita kaa adhik anand lete hai, vivaadaaspad vyavhaar kam dikhaate hai, kam aakraamak ranneeti kaa upyog karte hai or adhik sahyogaatmak ranneetiyon ko apanaate hai
 This increases the likelihood of the parties reaching their key goals and enhancing the ability to find integrated benefits
 beshak, nakaaratmak yaa prakritik prabhavakaarita vaale vaartakaron kii tulana main sakaaratmak prabhavakaarita vaale vaartakar, adhik samjhauton tak pahunche or unhone un samjhauton ke liye sammaan kii pravriti ko adhik darshaya
ye anukool parinaam, nirnay lene kii behatar prakriya ke kaaran upje, jaise lacheelee soch, rachanaatmak samasya samaadhaan, dusron ke nazariye kaa sammaan, jokhim lene kii ichha or ucch aatmavishvaas
samjhauta vaarta ke baad bhi sakaaratmak bhav ke laabhadaayak parinaam hote hai
 This increases satisfaction with the results achieved and affects a person's desire for future participation
 ek samjhaute tak pahunchane se ubhara PA dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko aasaan karata he, jo prabhavakaari patibaddhta ko badhaata he jisase baad kii sahabhaagita kaa maarg prashast karata he
 PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts the notion of self-performance, in such a way that performance is perceived as relatively better than it actually is
 is prakaar, praapt parinaamon par khud ke report vaale adhyayan pakshpaati ho sakate hai
 Negative expressions have a detrimental effect on various stages of the negotiation process
 haalanki vibhinn nakaaratmak bhavanaaen vaarta ke parinaamon ko prabhavit karti hai, abhi tak krodh par sarvaadhik shodh hua he
 Angry negotiators plan to use competitive strategy more often before negotiations begin and cooperate less
 ye pratispardhi ranneetiyaan ghatit sanyukt parinaamon se sambandhit hai
 Anger disrupts the process, reducing the level of trust during negotiations, tarnishing the parties 'focus, narrowing the parties' focused attention, and changing their central goal of reaching agreement against the other party
 Makes reactive
 krodhit vaartakar pratidwandvi ke hiton kii ore kam dhyaan dete hai or ve unke hiton kii pahchaan karne main kam sateek hote hai, is prakaar unhen kamatar sanyukt laabh praapt hota he
 Furthermore, since anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their priorities, it increases the likelihood that they will reject a profitable offer
 Anger also does not help in achieving negotiation goals: it Reduces joint gains and does not help increase personal gains, as angry negotiators do not succeed in making more claims for themselves
 In addition, negative emotions lead to accepting agreements that are not positive utilitarian actions but have negative utility
 haalanki, samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti kabhi-kabhi laabhprad ho sakati he: jaays tareeke se vyakt krodh apni patibaddhta, eemaandaaree or zaruuraton ko darshane kaa ek prabhavi tarika ho saktaa he
 Furthermore, although NA reduces the benefit in integrated tasks, it is a better strategy than PA in distribution tasks
 In his work on negative sentiment generation and white noise, Sednor found support for the existence of a negative emotion generation mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers of other ethnic origins
 " samjhauta vaarta, badale main, ek jaateey samooh yaa ling samooh ke prati dabe vidwesh dwaara nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit ho sakati he
 Research shows that negotiators' feelings do not necessarily affect the negotiation process
 Albrasin and others suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to ability and motivation: is model ke anusaar, bhaawanaaon ke vaarta ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna keval tab rahati he jab ek adhik he or doosraa kam he
 When both ability and motivation are low, emotion cannot be identified and when both are high, emotion can be identified but it will be considered irrelevant for judgment
 For example, one possible implication of this model is that Is that pa's positive effects on negotiation can be seen only when either motivation or ability are low
 samjhauta vaarta main bhaavana par kiye gaye adhikansh adhyayan, prakriya par vaartakar kii khud kii bhaawanaaon ke prabhaav par kendrit hai
 However, what the next party thinks can be equally important, we know that group emotions affect processes at the individual level and group level
 jab baat vaarta kii aati he, to duusare dal main vishwaas, uski bhaavana ko prabhavit karne ke liye aavashyak he or drishyata prabhaav badhaati he
 Emotions contribute to the negotiation process in such a way that it signals what the person feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in disruptive behavior and indicate what the next step is
 Should: PA also indicates the same, while NA indicates that mental or behavioral adjustment is required
 Can have two basic effects on defeat: mimetic / reciprocal or complementary
 For example, disappointment or sadness will inspire kindness and greater cooperation
 In a study by Butt and others that mimicked actual multi-stage settlement negotiations, most people reacted in a reciprocal rather than complementary way to the partner's feelings
 It was seen that the feelings of the antagonist and the specific strategies on the selected strategies differed -different effects occur: samjhauta vaarta ek jatil anyonyakriya he
 It is a very difficult task to cover all its complexities, only some aspects of it are isolated and controlled
 is kaaran, samjhauta vaarta ke adhikansh adhyayan prayogshaala sthitiyon ke tahat kiye jate hai or ye kuch hi pahaluon par prakaash daalate hai
 Although laboratory studies have their advantages, they have some major drawbacks when studying emotions: is bhaag kaa praathmik uddeshy he samjhauta vaarta main saanskrithik bhinnataaon kii seemaa ko pradarshit karnaa or yah darshana kii kaise ye bhinnataayen antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon main samasyaon kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Readers will see that national culture does not determine the behavior of the settlement negotiations
 balki, rashtriya samskruti kai karkon main se ek he jo vaarta mej par vyavhaar ko prabhavit karti he, yadhyapi mahatvapurn tareeke se
 udhaaharan ke liye, ling, sanghathanaatmak samskruti, antarrashtriya anubhav, udyog yaa kshetreey prishthbhumi, ye sabhi mahatvapurn prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Of course, all forms of stereotypes are dangerous, and international negotiators must know the people they are dealing with, not just about their country, culture, or company
 yahaan saamagree, pichley teen dashakon ke antarrashtriya samjhauta vaarta vyavhaar ke vyavasthit adhyayan par aadhaarit he jisamen udyog jagat se jude 17 deshon ke 1500 se adhik logon kii samjhauta vaarta shaileyon par vichaar kiya gaya
 The work included interviews with experienced officials and comments from people participating in the field, as well as behavioral science laboratory work that included surveying and analyzing videotaped talks
 Countries that were studied included Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Russia, Israel, Norway, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Britain, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the United States
 These countries were chosen because they constitute the most important trading partners of America's present and future
 kai samskritiyon main mote taur par dekhte hue, do mahatvapurn sabak nikaale ja sakate hai
 The first is that regional generalizations are often not correct
 udhaaharan ke liye, japani or korian samjhauta vaarta kii style kuch myanon main kaaphi samaan he, lekin anya tareekon se ve adhik bhinn lag sakati hai
 The second lesson revealed by the research is that Japan is an extraordinary place: Japanese people end up on or near the scale, on almost every dimension of the negotiation style
 udhaaharan ke liye, adhyayan kii gai samskritiyon main, japani log nunatam chakshu sampark kaa upyog karte hai
 Sometimes, Americans are at the other end
 lekin vastav main, adhikansh samay america bich main kahin hote hai
 The reader will see that this is evident in the figures presented in this section
 japani drushtikon, haalanki, sabase alag he, yahaan tak ki anokhaa 
 Cultural differences give rise to four types of problems in international trade negotiations, at the following levels: kram mahatvapurn he; suchi par neeche kii ore kii samasyaayein gambhir hai kyonki ve adhik sookshm he
 For example, two negotiators will immediately notice if one is speaking Japanese and the other is German
 The solution to this problem can be simplified by hiring a translator or speaking in a common third language, or it can be as difficult as learning a language
 samaadhaan ke baavjood, samasya spasht he
 Cultural variation is nonverbal behavior, on the other hand, it is almost always hidden in the pages of our awareness
 ham kah sakate hai, ki ek aamane-saamne kii samjhauta vaarta main pratibhaagi amaukhik rup se - or adhik sookshm tareeke se - kaaphi zyaada jaankaree lete or dete hai
 Some experts argue that this information is more important than oral information
 lagbhag yah sab sanket, hamaari chetana ke str se neeche chalaa jaataa he
 When the non-verbal signals of foreign partners are different, the negotiators are very close to misinterpreting it and in that case they are not even aware of the mistake
 For example, when a French client continues to cause disruption, Americans feel very uncomfortable without seeing why this is actually the case
 is tareeke main, parsparik takaraav, aksar vyapaarik sambandhon par asar daalata he, adrishy rah jaataa he or, falswaroop sudhara nahin ja paata
 mulyon or soch or nirnay lene kii prakriya main antar or bhi gahare chhipe hote hai or isliye inkaa nidaan karnaa kathin ho jaataa he jisaki vajah se inkaa sahi ilaaj nahin hota
 in matbhedon kii charchaa neeche kii gai he, jise bhashaa or amaukhik vyavhaar ke saath shuru kiya gaya he
 Translation problems are often important in international negotiations
 or, jab bhashaaen, bhashaayi taur par pruthak hoti hai, to adhik samasyaon kaa purvanumaan lag janaa chahie
 vishesh rup se vaishvik samjhauta vaarta chunauteepurn kaam ho sakati he
 The English language is often used, but on the table it can be spoken as a second language by most authorities
 vastav main, england, bharat or america ke deshi vaktaaon ko aksar ek duusare ko samajhane main pareshaani hoti he
 Accurate translation into international engagements is a goal that has almost never been achieved
 iske alaava, bhashaa kii bhinnataaon ko kabhi-kabhi rochak tareeke se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Many senior officials in foreign countries speak and understand a little English, but prefer to speak in their "strong" native language and use an interpreter
 is prakaar, hamane ek varisht roosi vaartakar ko roosi main sawaal poochhate dekha he
 The interpreter then translated the question to his American counterpart
 jab dubhashiya bol rahaa tha to america kaa dhyaan dubhashiye kii ore tha
 However, the direction of the Russian gaze was towards the American
 isliye, roosi, bade dhyaan se or bina koi dakhal die america ke chehre ke haav-bhav or amaukhik pratikriyaaon par gaur kar saktaa tha
 Additionally, when the American was speaking, senior Russians had twice the time to respond
 kyonki vah angrezi samaj rahaan tha, vah anuwaad prakriya ke dauraan apni pratikriya taiyaar kar saktaa tha
 What is the importance of this extra time to react in a strategic settlement negotiation? What are the benefits of being able to carefully observe the non-verbal reactions of your top level counterpart in a high-stakes trade negotiation? Simply put, bilingualism is not a common trait for Americans, and therefore high-skill competitors in language gain a natural advantage in international commerce
 iske atirikt, america prabandhakon se suni gai ek aam shikaayat, videshi graahakon or saajheedaaron dwaara apni deshi bhashaa main aapas main charchaa se sambandhit he
 Frankly, this is considered rude and often American negotiators are likely to see some ominous qualities in this foreign conversation - "they are planning or telling secrets
" " yah ek aksar kii jane vaali america galati he
 The general purpose of such mutual discussions is to improve the translation problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek korian duusare korian se jhuk kar puch saktaa he "usne kya kaha?" yaa, aapasi charchaa, videshi dal ke sadasyon ke bich ek asahmati se sambandhit ho sakati he
 Both situations should be viewed by Americans as a positive sign - that is, understanding the translation accurately, enhances the ability to participate, and often leads to internal disagreements
 par chunki zyaadaatar america keval ek hi bhashaa bolte hai, donon hi sthitiyon ke saraahaa nahin jayega
 vaise, duusare deshon ke logon ke liye yah salaah di jaati he ki ve apni pehali kuch aapasi charchaaon kii vishaywastu kaa ek laghu vivaran americanyon ko de den taaki kisi apriy dharna kaa vikaas na ho
 But, beyond translation and interpreters, there are some problems at the language level
 chhadam vaarta ke aankade jaankareepurn hote hai
 In the study, the oral behavior of interlocutors from 15 cultures was videotaped
 pradarsh 1 ke khand main sankhyaayein, bayanon ke pratishat ko darshaati hai jinhen prayek soochibaddh shrenee main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 That is, 7 percent of statements made by Japanese negotiators were classified as promises, 4 percent as threats, 7 percent as recommendations
 chhadam vaarta ke dauraan vaartakaron dwaara prayukt maukhik saudebaaji vyavhaar ascharyajanak rup se sabhi samskritiyon main samaan sabit hue
 sabhi 15 samskritiyon main samjhauta vaarta mukhya rup se soochna-sahyog ranneeti se nirmit thi - sawaal or swa-khulaase
 dhyaan den ki israeli, swa-khulaase ke kram main nune ant par hote hai
 Their 30 percent was the lowest among all 15 groups, implying that they were the most reluctant to give information
 kul milakar, haalanki, prayukt maukhik ranneetiyon kii paddati, vividh samskritiyon main ascharyajanak rup se samaan thi
 Go to Exhibit 1, Oral Talks Tactics in 15 Cultures: maanav vigyaani re el
 bardvicel ne pradarshit kiya ki samvaad main sandesh ke 35% se bhi kam ko bole gaye shabd dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he jabaki anya 65% ko amaukhik tareeke se sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 Albert Mehrabian, a UCLA psychologist, has also interpreted the meaning from which face-to-face interaction originated
 vah khabar dete hai: Of course, some people can heave with exact percentages, but our work also supports the notion that nonverbal behaviors are important - how things are said is often more important than what is said
 
 pradarsh 2, 15 video tepe samoohon ke kuch bhashaai pahaluon or amaukhik vyavhaar kaa vishleshan pradaan karata he, arthath, chizon ko kaise kaha jaataa he
 While these efforts only scratch the surface of this type of behavior analysis, they still provide clues to substantial cultural differences
 dhyaan den ki, ek baar phir japani, vyavhaar ke soochibaddh lagbhag har aayam par is kram ke ant par yaa uske nazadik hai
 In these 15 groups, their facial disguise and touch are minimal
 keval uttari chini logon ne shabd kaa aksar upyog kiya or japani kii apeksha keval roosiyon ne adhik khamosh avadhiyon kaa prayog kiya
 Go to Exhibit 2, Linguistic aspects of language and nonverbal behavior in 15 cultures: pradarsh 1 or 2 main aankadon kaa ek vyapak pareekshan ek adhik sarthak nishkarsh kaa khulaasa karata he: vaarta kii maukhik saamagree par vichaar karne kii tulana main bhashaa ke bhashaai pahaluon or amaukhik vyavhaaron kii tulana karne main samskritiyon main bhinnata adhik milti he
 For example, consider the huge difference between Japanese and Brazilians in Exhibit 2 compared to Exhibit 1
 video tepe kiye gaye 15 saanskrithik samoohon main se prayek ke vishisht pahaluon kaa atirikt vivaran aage he
 Certainly, statistically significant differences between individual cultures cannot be drawn without large samples
 However, it is worthwhile to briefly consider the cultural differences mentioned
 japan japani vaarta vyavhaar ke adhikansh vivaran ke anuroop, is vishleshan kaa parinaam yah darshata he ki sahabhaagita kii unki style sabase kam aakraamak he 
 dhamkee, aadesh or chetavaniyon ko, adhik sakaaratmak vaade, siforeeshon or patibaddhtaon ke paksh main hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 a special indication of his polite style of communication is not his and the lack of use of you and facial expressions, as well as periods of silence
 korea vishleshan kaa shaayad ek adhik dilachasp pahalu he asian vaarta style kaa vaishamy
 gaiyr-asian, purvi deshon ke bare main aksar samanyikaran karte hai; nishkarshon se yah pradarshit hota he ki yah ek galati he
 Korean negotiators exercised significantly more impunity and order than Japanese
 korianyon ne japaniyon kii tulana main teen guna adhik nahin shabd kaa istemaal kiya or hastkshep kiya
 Also, there was no period of silence among Korean negotiators
 china 
 uttari china ke vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar, prashn poochne main sabase ullekhneey tha 
 beshak, chini vaartakaron dwaara die gaye bayanon ke 70 pratishat ko jaankaree vinimay ranneeti ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 Other aspects of his behavior were quite similar to those of the Japanese, especially not the use of the TUM and the silent period

 taiwan main udyog jagat ke logon kaa vyavhaar china or japan se kaaphi bhinn tha magar korea ke samaan tha
 The Chinese on Taiwan were extraordinary at face time - 20 or 30 minutes on average approx
 They asked fewer questions and provided more information than any other Asian group
 rus
 kisi bhi anya europea samooh se roosi style kaaphi alag thi or, vastav main, kai myanon main japani style ke kaaphi samaan thi
 They used no and Tum less and used the silence period more than any other group
 keval japani hi chehre kii bhav bhangimaaon ko kam dekhte hai or keval chini hi adhiktar prashn poochhate hai
 The behavior of Israeli Israeli interlocutors was specific in three respects
 jaisaa ki upar ullekh kiya gaya he, unhone nijee-khulaase ke sabase kam pratishat kaa upyog kiya, jaahir taur par apane card ko apekshaakrit pakade rakhaa
 vaikalpik rup se, vaadon or siforeeshon kaa sarvocch pratishat kaa istemaal kiya, manaane kii in ranneetiyon kaa asaamaanya rup se baari upyog kiya
 With 5 percent they were at the end of the percentage scale of authentic appeal where the competitors had the most reference to offer
 shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki israeli vaartakaron ne kisi bhi anya dal ke vaartakaron kii tulana main ek-duusare ko aksar baadhit kiya
 Indeed, it is only for this critical nonlinear behavior that he is presumably given the stereotype of "dhekelu" often used by Americans to describe Israeli partners in their settlement negotiations
 germany germanon ke vyavhaar ko chihnit karnaa mushkil he kyonki ve lagbhag sabhi kram main madhya main sthaan rakhte hai
 The Germans, however, were exceptional with a high percentage in terms of private-disclosure and a low percentage in questions
 united kingdom british vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar ullekhneey rup se sabhi maamalon main america ke logon ke samaan tha
 Most British negotiators have a strong sense of right and wrong in negotiating settlement
 protocol kaa bahut mahatv hota he
 Digga is perhaps a good metaphor for the Spanish approach to the Spain settlement negotiations, which appears in our figure
 jab aap madrid main ek phone kol karte hai, to aam taur par duusare chor se milane vaali pratikriya hola nahin hoti he, balki, diga hoti he
 It is therefore not surprising that Spanish used the highest percentage of orders and provided relatively less information than any other group, even in videotape talks
 In addition, they often created more obstacles than any other group and they used the word no and tum fairly
 frans 
 france ke vaartakaron kii style, sabhi samoohon main shaayad sabase aakraamak thi
 In particular, they used the highest percentage of threats and warnings
 anya samoohon kii tulana main unhone hastkshep, chehre par nigaah or nahin or tum kaa bhi aksar istemaal kiya or ek francisi vaartakar ne chhadam vaarta ke dauraan apane saathi ke haath ko bhi chuaa
 Brazil The people of the Brazilian industry were quite aggressive like the French and Spanish
 sabhi samoohon main unhone adeshon ke duusare sabase ucch pratishat kaa istemaal kiya
 On average, the Brazilian used the word 42 times, 90 times you, and touched each other's hands 5 times during the 30-minute settlement negotiations
 The eyes were also high on eyes
 mexico
 hamaari samjhauta vaarta main mexican vyavhaar kii paddati kshetreey yaa bhashaa-samooh ke samanyikaran ke khataron ke achche anusmarak rahe hai
 Both their verbal and non-verbal behavior differed significantly from their Latin America or continental cousins
 darasal, mexico ke log telephone kaa jawaab adhik dakshatapurna buno se dete hai 
 kai maamalon main, mexican vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar bahut kuch sanyukt rajya america ke samaan tha
 French-speaking Canadian French-speaking Canadians treated their continental brothers fairly
 france ke vaartakaron kii tarah, unhone ne bhi dhamkiyon or chetavaniyon ke ucch pratishat kaa upyog kiya or apekshaakrit adhik hastkshep or chakshu sampark kiya
 The aggressive style of such reconciliation does not match the peaceful style of other English speakers, including some Asian groups or English-speaking Canadians
 angreji bhashi canadow angrezi ko pratham bhashaa ke rup main bolne vaale canadaayiyon ne, sabhi 15 samoohon ke bich manaane kii aakraamak ranneeti ke sabase kam pratishat kaa upyog kiya 
 shaayad, jaisaa ki samvaad shodhakartaaon kaa suzav he, aise shailigat matbhed aatanrik-nrijaateey kalah kaa bijaropan karte hai, jaisaa ki kai varshon ke dauraan canada main dekha gaya
 In relation to international negotiations, English-speaking Canadians apparently exercised more and no more interventions than both the US and Japan, Canada's major trading partners
 sanyukt rajya america 
 german or british kii tarah, america bhi adhikansh kram main madhya main rahete hai
 They undermined each other less than others, but that was the only difference
 in tamaam samskritiyon main bhinnataayen kaaphi jatil hai or swayan is saamagree kaa prayog videshi samakakshon ke vyavhaar kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 iske bajaay, rudh praaroop ke purvakthith khataron ke sambandh main vishesh saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 yahaan yah mahatvapurn he ki is prakaar kii bhinnataaon ke bare main pataa hona chahie, taaki japani khamoshi, brazilian "nahin, nahin, nahin


," yaa francisi dhamkee ko galat na samajha jaae
 In addition to the 15 cultures discussed, below is an excerpt on the approach to settlement negotiations in the Mediterranean region
 "bumadhya samskruti puri tarah garmjoshi vaali he
 Warm greetings and social aspects
 There is a lot of use of currencies and gestures
 samjhauta vaarta ko kisi vishesh saudon main yaa samjhauta vaarta ke vishesh charnon main spasht vyakhya karnaa kathin he
 In some areas, the deal requires 'lubrication'
 vastav main, 'snehan' kaa yah sawaal bumadhya deshon kii kuch samskritiyon ke liye mahatvapurn he
 It is seen as a common practice and does not have the repulsive character of 'bribery'
 in samskritiyon main samjhauta vaarta karne ke drushtikon ke liye aise anushaasan kii zarurat hoti he jisaki ham charchaa kar rahe the; or tab bhi snehan kii jarurat ke prati jaagruk rahanaa chahie
 chunki koi bhi sammanjanak pashchimi company, rishwatakhori ke abhyaas se judana chaahegi, zarurat ek sthaneey agency ko praapt karne kii he or yah sunishchit karne kii he ki vah agency snehan ko sambhaal rahi he
 " chaar prabandhkeey mulyon ko - nishpakshta, pratispardhaa, samanta or samay kii pabandi, jise adhikansh americanyon dwaara majbootee se pakadaa jaataa he, vah antarrashtriya vyapaar vaartaon main aksar galatchhemiyon or buree bhaawanaaon ko janm detaa hua dikhataa he
 "americans make decisions based on hard points, cold ends and cold facts
 " "america bhai-bhatijawad nahin khelte hai
 "" Economics and performance have value, not people
 "" Trade is business
 " aise kathan nishpakshta ke mahatv ke america vichaaron ko acchhee tarah se pratibimbit karte hai
 The single most successful book on the subject of settlement negotiations, Getting to Yes, is highly recommended to both foreign and American readers
 videshi na sirf vaarta ke bare main seekhenge balki, shaayad adhik mahatvapurn rup se yah janenge ki america log vaarta ke bare main kya sochate hai
 The author is very firm on "separating the person from the problem" and states that, "each negotiator has two types of interests: in substance and in relationship"
 This advice is probably quite meaningful in the US or in Germany, but in most parts of the world such advice is nonsense
 duniya ke adhikansh sthanon main, vishesh rup se samooh-unmukhi, ucch sandarbh samskritiyon main, vyaktitv or padaarth alag mudde nahin hai or unhen alag kiya bhi nahin ja saktaa
 For example, consider how important nepotism is in Chinese or Hispanic cultures
 visheshgy bataate hai ki badhate "chini rashtramandal" main kaarobaar, kathor paariwarik niyantran kii seemaa or sambandhon se pare nahin badhate
" spain, mexico or philippines main bhi isi tarah se kaam hota he
 And, naturally, negotiators of such countries will not only take things personally but will also be personally affected by the results of the negotiations
 His experience at the negotiating table will also affect business relations, no matter how much meaning is involved
 chhadam vaarta ko prayogtmak arthshaastra ke ek prakaar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he jahaan bhaag le rahe prayek saanskrithik samooh kaa mulya, lagbhag aarthik parinaamon main pratibimbit hota he
 This simple pseudo-action, used in this part of our work, represents the essence of commercial negotiation - it includes both, competitive and collaborative aspects
 prayek samskruti ke udyog jagat ke kam se kam 40 logon ne, vahi khariddaar-vikreta khel khelaa or teen utpaadon kii keemton par samjhauta vaarta kii
 antim samjhaute ke aadhaar par, "vaarta kii pai" ko, kharidaar or vikreta ke bich ise vibhajit kiye jane se pehle, sahyog ke madhyam se or bada kiya ja saktaa he 
 parinaamon ko pradarsh 3 main sankshepit kiya gaya he
 Go to Exhibit 3, Cultural differences in competition and equality in the negotiation results of 20 cultures: pai ko bada karne main japani champion the
 Among the 21 cultural groups involved, their combined gain in proxy talks was the highest
 Chinese and British businessmen in Hong Kong also acted cooperatively in our negotiation game
 check or german ne adhik pratispardhi rup main vyavhaar kiya
 American pie was more of an average size, but at least it was divided relatively evenly
 In contrast, Japanese merchants, particularly Japanese and South Korean, divided their pies in a bizarre manner, with buyers receiving a higher percentage of profits
 The result of these pseudo-trade negotiations is entirely consistent with other authors' comments and the adage that the buyer in Japan is the "kinger"
 khariddaaron kii ichchhaaon ko puraa sammaan dene ke japani abhyaas kii samaj americanyon main bahut thodi hi he
 Things don't work like this in America
 america vikreta, america kharidaaron ko ek baraabar ke rup main adhik vyavhaar karte hai or america samaaj ke samtawadi mulya is vyavhaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 The American emphasis on individualism and contestation, reflected in these findings, is highly consistent with Geert Hofstad's work, indicating that Americans on the individualist scale scored higher than all other cultural groups
 Furthermore, values of individualism / collectivism have been seen to have directly influenced the practices of negotiation in many other countries
 ant main, na keval japani kharidaar america kharidaaron se adhik parinaam praapt karte hai, balki america vikritaon ke saath tulana main, japani vikritaon ko vanijyik pai kaa bhi bada hissaa miltaa he
 Interestingly, when these results are shown, Americans still often prefer the role of American salespeople at executive seminars
 duusare shabdon main, bhale hi america vikreta, japani kii tulana main kam laabh kamaate hon, kai america prabandhak jahiraa taur par kam laabh pasand karte hai agar vah laabh, kisi sanyukt laabh ke samaan vibhaajan se upja ho
 "just make them wait
" Everyone else in the world knows that no other settlement negotiation strategy with the Americans is more useful, because no one values so much time, no one is so impatient when things slow down, and more often than not Americans stick their wrist Does not look at the clock
 Edward T
 Hall, in his seminal writings, has best described how different cultures have seen the passing of time and how these differences hurt Americans the most
 yahaan tak ki america bhi apane laabh ke liye, samay main herpher karne kii koshish karte hai
 As a case in point, Solar Turbine Incorporated once sold a $ 34 million industrial gas turbine and compressor for a Russian natural gas pipeline project
 donon pakshon main sahmati hui ki vaarta, kisi ek tatasth sthaan par yojit kii jaaegi, france ke dakshin main
 pichhali vaartaon main, rus kathor tha lekin uchit tha
 But in Nice, Russia was no good
 ve adhik kathor ho gaye the or vastav main, solar ke shaamil adhikariyon ke anusaar puri tarah se anuchit the
 The Americans spent a few hard days diagnosing the problem, but once done, an important call was made back to the San Diego headquarters
 roosi kyon itane ruukhe ho gaye the? ve nise main garm mausam kaa anand le rahe the or ek twarit saude ko antim rup dekar waapas masco jane ke icchhuk nahin the! california ko bulaanaa is samjhauta vaarta main mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 The people at Solar's headquarters in San Diego were so sophisticated that they allowed their interlocutors to take enough time
 From that moment onwards, the routine of negotiations became brief, including a 45-minute meeting in the morning, a golf course in the afternoon, a beach, or hotel, calling and paperwork
 ant main, chauthe saptaah ke dauraan, roosiyon ne riyaayaten dena shuru kiya or lambey samay kii baithkon kii maang kii
 kyon? ve bumadhya par chaar saptaah guzaarane ke baad, bina ek hastakshrit anubandh ke masco waapas nahin ja sakate the
 This strategic pressure of time gave Solar a wonderful contract
 jab samjhauta vaarta ke kisi jatil kaary kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, to adhikansh pashchimi log vishaal kaaryon ko chote kaaryon kii ek shrinkhalaa main vibhajit kar lete hai
 Issues such as prices, repayments, warranties and service contracts can be resolved one issue at a time, where the final agreement will be the sum of the sequence of smaller agreements
 In Asia, however, a different approach is adopted in which all issues are discussed together in no apparent order, and concessions are given on all issues at the end of the negotiations
 pashchimi anukramik drushtikon or purvi samgr drushtikon, acchhee tarah nahin mil pate
 Which means, that American managers often report major difficulties in measuring progress in negotiations, especially in Asian countries
 After all, in America, when half of the issues are settled, you are half sure
 lekin china, japan, yaa korea main kuch bhi sulajhaata nahin dikhataa he
 Then you will be surprised if you are done
 Often, Americans make unnecessary concessions just before the agreement is announced by the other party
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek america departmental store ke kaaryakari ne jo apni shrinkhalaa ke liye chah alag upabhokta utpaadon ko kharidne ke liye japan kii yatra kar rahaa tha, pachhtaawaa vyakt kiya ki pehle utpaada ke liye samjhauta vaarta main puraa ek saptaah lag gaya
 In the United States, such a purchase is finalized in one afternoon
 to, uski gananaa ke anusaar, use laga ki use apni kharid ko puraa karne main japan main chah saptaah lag jaayenge
 usne prakriya ko tej karne kii koshish main kharid keemton ko upar uthaane par vichaar kiya
 But before he was able to make such a concession, the Japanese soon agreed to five other products in just three days
 is vishesh prabandhak ne, apni khud kii sweekaarokti ke anusaar, japani saudebaajon ke saath apni pehali muthbhed main khud ko bhaagyashaalee mana
 Almost a major mistake of this American executive reflects something more than a difference in decision-making style
 americanyon ke liye, ek vyapaarik samjhauta vaarta, ek samasya-samaadhaan gatividhi he, donon dalon ke liye samaadhaan, sabase acha sauda he
 On the other hand, for a Japanese businessman, negotiating a trade agreement is the time to develop trade relations for the goal of a long-term mutual benefit
 aarthik mudde vaarta kaa sandarbh hai, saamagree nahin
 is prakaar, kisi ek mudde kaa samaadhaan, vastav main itnaa mahatvapurn nahin he
 Once a viable, harmonious business relationship is established, such details will be resolved automatically
 And, as in the case of the buyer of retail items above, once the relationship was established - first marked by agreement - other "details" were quickly resolved
 america saudebaajon ko asian samskritiyon main aam is tarah ke ek samgr drushtikon kaa purvanumaan hona chahie or jahiraa taur par avyavasthit kram main sabhi muddon par ek saath samjhauta vaarta karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 vaarta main pragati kaa maapan isse nahin karnaa chahie ki kitne muddon kaa samaadhaan hua he
 Rather, Americans should try to measure the quality of business relationships
 Important signs of progress can be: bhinn samskritiyon ke bich hone vaali vaartaon main sambhavit samasyaon par vichaar karne par, vishesh rup se jab aap sambandh-unmukhi samskruti ke prabandhakon ko, soochna-unmukhi prabandhakon se milaate hai, to aashcharya hota he ki koi bhi antarrashtriya vyapaar puraa ho jaataa he
 Clearly, the economic imperatives of global trade benefit from this despite potential losses
 lekin saanskrithik bhinnataaon kii saraahna karne se or bhi behatar antarrashtriya vanijyik lenden falit hota he - antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon kaa lakshya sirf vyapaarik saude nahin balki rachanaatmak or atyadhik laabhadaayak vyavsaayik sambandh hai jo vaastavik lakshya hin
 Due to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation as parties is being widely adopted
 ek jatil samjhauta vaarta ko sulajhane main dal, prabhavi dhang se sahyog kar sakate hai
 More knowledge and information are scattered in a team than a single person
 lekhan, shravan or charchaa, vishisht bhoomikaayen hai jise dal ke sadasyon ko santusht karnaa chahie
 ek dal kaa kshamta aadhaar, galatiyon kii maatra ko kam kar detaa he or ek samjhauta vaarta main antarangta ko badhaata he

 adhikarik rup se bhartiya videsh mantralay ne ise shantipurna parmaanu bam visphot bataaya, lekin vaastavik rup se yah twarit parmaanu kaarykram tha
 India started its nuclear program at the "tata Institute of Fundamental Research" in 1944 under the leadership of Homi Jahangir Bhabha
 bhautikashastri raja rammana ne parmaanu astron ke nirmaan sambandhi kaarykram main apana sakriy yogadan diya, unhone parmaanu hathiyaaron kii vaigyanik takanic ko adhikadhik unnat kiya or baad main pokharan -1 parmaanu kaarykram ke liye gathit pehali vagyaniko kii toli ke mukhiya bane
 After the independence of India from the British in 1947, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru entrusted the responsibility of nuclear program to the capable hands of Homi j Bhabha
 1948 main paas hue "parmaanu urja act " kaa mukhya uddeshy iskaa shantipurna vikaas karnaa tha

 The nuclear project was moving towards its fulfillment when in 1960, Nehru thought of turning it into construction and, in India, envisioning its vision of a nuclear power plant, the US company Westinghouse Electric was India's first nuclear power house, Task of making in Tarapur
 kenneth nicols joki america sena main abhiyantaa the ne nehru se mulaakaat kii, yahi wo vakt tha jab nehru ne bhabha se nabhikeey hathiyaaron ko banane main lagane vaale vakt ke bare main puchha tab bhabha ne 1 varsh kaa anumaanit samay maanga
 By 1962, the nuclear program was progressing slowly but rightly
 nehru bhi bharat-china yuddh ke chalate jisame bharat ne china se apni jameen khoyi thi, parmaanu kaarykram se vichlit ho gaye the
 Nehru appealed to the Soviet Union for help but expressed his inability to help in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis

 Bhabha was now aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and gave several speeches on Indian radio
 1964 main, bhabha ne bhartiya radio ke madhyam se bhartiya janata ko bataaya ki "is tarah ke parmaanu hathiyaar ullekhneey saste hote hai" or america parmaanu pareekshan kaarykram kii kifayati laagat kaa hawala dete hue apane tark kaa samarthan kiya
 The nuclear program slowed down partially when Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister
 1965 main, pradhanmantri shastri ji ko pakistan ke saath ek or yuddh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Shastriji appointed physicist Vikram Sarabhai as the head of the nuclear program, but because of his Gandhian beliefs, Sarabhai directed the program towards peaceful objectives rather than military development
