 The way in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the learner is called teaching method

 Tips can be part of a method, not a complete method
 ek hi yukti anek vidhiyon main prayukt ho sakati he
 There can be two ways of presenting the text
 ek main chaatro ko koi saamaanya siddhant bataakar uski jaanch yaa pushti ke liye anek udhaaharan die jate hai
 In the second, a general rule is extracted from the students by giving several examples first
 pehali vidhi ko nigamanaatmak vidhi or duusari ko aagamanaatmak vidhi kehete hai
 This method is considered most suitable for grammar teaching
 duusare drushtikon se shikshan vidhi ke do anya prakaar ho sakate hai
 If the method of presenting the text is such that by first giving the knowledge of the organs and then the knowledge of the complete object is made, then it is called the synthesis method

 One of the well-known sources of teaching is "from the tangible to the intangible"
 vastav main hamen bahya sansar kaa gyaan apni gyanendriyon ke dwaara hota he jinamein netra pramukh hai
 When we see an object, we get a general introduction to it
 at: moort vastu gyaan pradaan karne kaa sabase saral saadhan he

 phir unamem do goliyaan or milakar sabko ek saath ginate hai tab teen or do paanch spasht ho jaataa he
 Another form of the object is parable
 vastuvidhi main jis prakaar vastuon ke dwaara gyaan pradaan kiya jaataa he drushtaantvidhi main usee prakaar drushtaanton ke dwaara
 Parables can be visual as well as audible
 isamen chitra, maanchitr, chitrapat aadi ke sahare vastu kaa spashtikan kiya jaataa he
 Also the subject can be clarified by simile, example, story, jokes etc
 vastu evam drushtaantvidhiyon se gyaan praapt karte karte jab bacchon ko kuch kuch anumaan karne tathaa apratyaksh vastu ko bhi samajhane kaa abhyaas ho jaataa he tab, kathanvidhi kaa sahaara liya jaataa he

 Planning method is the result of the combined efforts of famous American academics Duvie, Kilpatrick, Stevenson, etc

 To teach with this method, first a problem is taken, which is often raised by the students and they are planned by them to solve that problem and the plan is completed in a natural environment

maragadhavalli saint baayen se Template: Education in Tamil Nadu: Education in India gaison kii sahaayta se weldon kii kriya ek si hoti he, lekin unka vibhaajan upyog main aanevaali gas ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 These gases are often a mixture of oxygen and acetylene, coal gas and hydrogen etc
 inamen se oxi-asitilin weldon sabase adhik prachlit he
 Commercial companies producing weld gases sell the gas in welded steel cylinders for welding at the pressure of several atmospheres
 weldon ke bade-bade kaarkaanon main nijee gas janitron dwaara calcium carbide or pani ke mishran se yah gas kam dabas par taiyaar kii jaati he
 Dissolving acetylene in acetone does not cause explosion
 chaahe kisi bhi prakaar kii gas kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae, weldon ke liye use kisi prakaar kii phunkani ke dwaara hi weldon ke sthaan par pahunchaaya jaataa he, jinamein lage ek balve kii sahaayta se gas ke bahaav par niyantran kar uchit aakaar kii lau bana lee jaati he
 Figure 4
 The figure of a is shown in the shape of a fingertip on the mouth of a blower and in b the shape of a flame
 lau ko choti, badi, patali yaa moti banane ke liye vibhinn naapon ke jet phunkani par adal badalakar lagaae jate hai
 The jet's measurement means that its strength is determined according to the gas cost per hour
 sabase chote jet dwaara ek ghante main ek ghan foot or sabase bade jet dwaara lagbhag 200 ghan foot gas kharch ho jaati he tathaa phunkani main gas kii daab 2 se 8 pound prati varg inch tak rakhi jaati he
 During the experiment, the acetylene gas is first opened and burnt at the mouth of the jet, then the valve of the oxygen cylinder is slowly opened so that the proper type of flame is formed
 jalanevaali gas ke mishran main adhik asitilin hone se uski lau carburikar hokar kuch moti pad jaati he, lekin vah aarambh se ant tak ek si tej chamakdaar bani rahati he
 If there is an excess of oxygen in the mixture, the flame becomes oxidizing and the trunk becomes long and bright, but by making appropriate adjustments in the amount of both types of gases, the bright part of the trunk that forms the flame is small
 And is clearly shaped and has the highest temperature at its tip, as shown in Figure 4
 at: jhaal lagaate samay dhaatu ko galane ke liye lau ko dhaatu kii sataha se lagbhag 1 / 8 inch se 1 / 16 inch tak dur rakhaa jaataa he
 When welding, the collisions of the objects to be welded are melted at the joint by a flame of gas from above, which mixes the metals of the two parts together, and at the same time some of the same kind of surplus metal, which is thin
 It is in the form of lights and also called as filler or light, it is filled in the throat and after it gets cold, a solid joint is formed
 phunkani ko chalaane kii do tarkiben hoti hai, ek to baayein haath kii or duusari daahine haath kii
 In left-handed action, Weldon's work moves from the right to the left, causing the flame to tilt towards the flattened part, and holding the flicker with the right hand and holding the light with the left hand
 weldon karte samay phunkani weldon kii janevaali vastu se 60 se 70 ansh kaa kone or dhaatu kii batti 30 40 ansh kaa kone banaati he
 In the action of the right hand, the mouth of the flame is inclined towards the jagged part and the process of welding increases from right side to right side
 baayein haath se beldon karte samay phunkani kaa pani kii laharon jaise chalaaya jaataa he or daahine haath ke weldon main phunkani ko bahut hi kam yaa bilkul hi nahin laharaaya jaataa, lekin batti ko gol chhallon ke aakaar main ghumaate hue, chalaaya jaataa he
 The diameter of the light should be in proportion to the thickness of the welded object and the size of the blower
 patali batti swayan to jaldi gal jaaegi or weldit kiya janevaala jod garam hokar galit avasthaa main aane bhi nahin paaegaa
 If the light is too thick, it will itself be a late hug and will quickly cool off the already sore parts of the object
 is prakaar kii phunkani kaa rivaaj aajkal badhata ja rahaa he
 In this, two flames come out together, the forward flame serves to heat the metal in advance, which costs a little more acetylene, but the advantage is that it keeps the plates from oxidizing by carbureting, because at that time Due to the absorption of carbon in the plates, their lowering point decreases and the last small flame makes it work easily as soon as it reaches there
 is prakaar kii lau se welding kiye janevaale bhaagon main sikudan or anthan ke dosha kaa bhi parihaar ho jaataa he tathaa weldon kaa kaam bhi shighrata se hota he

 gajani or uske gunde tod-phod karte hue kalpana ke apartment main ghus jate hai or uske laut aane kii pratiksha karte he jabaki kalpana andar hi mil jaati he
 Coincidentally, Sanjay reached there to meet Kalpana

 sanjay kii aankhon ke saamne antim drishy kaundh jaataa he, ki gajani ke lohe kii chad ke krur prahaar se hi kalpana kii hatya hui thi
 Sunita now realizes the truth about the shock, she meets Sanjay and tells him what the truth is
 gusse se bekaabu hokar vah ji-jaan se gajani kaa peechha karata he
 Upon reaching Ghazni's den in Mumbai, Sanjay brutally kills all the Ghazni's retainers one by one in a planned manner and falls behind Ghajni
 durdamy dhang se khadedta hua vah uske paas pahunch kar ladaai main bhid jaataa he
 He wants to kill Ghazni so that his memory cycle disappears again and he forgets the present
 gajani mudata he or chura bhonk detaa he
 While mocking Sanjay, he narrates the gruesome tale of how he murdered Kalpana, when suddenly Sanjay overcomes his power with the ultimate boil
 sanjay gajani ko thik usee tarah martha he jis tarah gajani ne kalpana kii hatya kii thi
 The film progresses to its end, with Sanjay still working as a volunteer in an orphanage suffering from a memory loss

 There are three major parameters of a sine wave - its own amplitude, its phase and its frequency, all of these communication signals can be modified based on low frequency to obtain a modulated signal
 jo upkaran adhimishran ko anjaam detaa he modulator kehalaata he or jo upkaran vipareet kriya karata he demodulator kehalaata he
 The device that can do both types of tasks is called a model

 ek saamaanya udhaaharan : ek telephone line ko shravan yogya dhwani ko sthanantarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ek tone ko len, yah ankiy bits nahin he
 This is why computers can connect to the telephone via modems, which represent digital bits by tones, called symbols
 agar vahaan chaar vikalp ke pratik hai, pehla pratik bit seqvence 00 kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isi tarah doosraa 01 ko, teesraa 10 or chauthaa 11
 agar kisi modem main 1000 tone prati second vaala sangeet bajataa he, to iskaa pratik dar 1000 pratik / prati second, yaa bod hoga
 chunki is udhaaharan main harek tone do ankiy bits vaala ek massej kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, isliye bit dar pratik dar kaa duguna yani 2000 bits prati second hota he
 According to one definition of a digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal, but in another definition, modulation is also called the conversion from digital to analog
 zyaadaatar pathyapustakon main ankiy adhimishran skim ko ankiy transmishan ke rup main, data transmishan kaa hi paryaay maan liya gaya he, bahut kam pathyapustakon main ise anuroop transmishan kaha gaya he
 The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are as follows: QAM main, ek infez sanket or ek kshetrakalan charan aayam ek parimit sankhya main abhivyakt hoti he
 This can be seen as a two-channel system, with each channel using ASK
 parinamswaroop sanket PSK or ASK donon ke sammishran ke baraabar hota he
 In each of the above methods, each phase, frequency or amplitude is dictated by an amazing double beats pattern
 aamtaur par, harek charan frequency yaa aayam kii saamaan sankhya ke beats kaa kutalekhan karti he
 The symbol included in this number of bits is represented by a particular phase
 yadi varnmaala main m = 2 n { \ displaystyle M=2^{N}} vaikalpik pratik ke rup main shaamil he to harek pratik n bits ke sandesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If the symbol rate f s { \ displaystyle f_ {S}} is the symbol per second, the data rate is n f s { \ displaystyle Nf_ {S}} beats per second
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varnmaala jisame 16 vaikalpik pratik hai, harek pratik 4 bits kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Therefore the data rate will be four times the baud rate
 PSK, ASK yaa QAM, jahaan adhimishrit sanket kii carrier frequency sthir he vahaan adhimishran varnmaala aksar aasaani se raashi rekhachitr kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, harek sanket ke liye aayam ke i sanket ko x-axis or q sanket ko y-axis dwaara darshata he
 PSK and ASK using the principle of QAM, but sometimes FSK are also frequently generated and detected
 i or q sanket ko jatil-maan sanket i +jq main joda ja saktaa he
 Consequently the actual value known as the equivalent low-pass signal or the equivalent baseband signal is the complex signal physical value representing the complex value
 modulator dwaara data sanchaarit ke liye upyogi nimnlikhit saamaanya kadam hai : The de-modulator usually performs the following on behalf of the receiver: sabhi ankiy sanchaar vyavastha main yah aam he ki modulator or di-modulator donon kaa dizin ek hi saath kiya janaa chahie
 ankiy adhimishran yojanaayen sambhav hai kyonki preshak-praapak donon pakshon ko pehle se jaankaree honi chahie ki kis tarah data kaa kutalekhan kiya jaae or sanchaar vyavastha kaa kaise pratinidhitiv kiya jaae
 sabhi ankiy sanchaar pranaaliyon main, preshak ke aaparivartak or praapak ke di-modulator donon ko is tarah banaaya jaay ki apane kaam ke alaava ek-duusare kaa bhi kaam kar saken
 In the incompatible modulation method, a receiver does not need the reference clock signal that occurs in the same phase with the sender carrier wave
 In such a case, the modulation moves asynchronously in the signal
 iskaa vipareet anukool adhimishran he
 The most common digital modulation techniques are as follows: MSK or GMSK satat charan adhimishran ke vishesh maamlen hai
 Indeed, the MSK of the subcumbus of CPM is a special case, which is also known as a symbolic-time period of continuous phase frequency-shift keying, which is a rectangular frequency pulse
 OFDM frequency divijan multiplexing par aadhaarit he, lekin iskaa upyog ek ankiy adhimishran yojana ke taur par kiya jaataa he
 The bit stream is divided into several parallel data strings and each stream is transferred to its subcarrier using the traditional digital modulation scheme
 OFDM sanket ek adhimishrit sab-carrier kaa sankshipt rup he
 OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multidimensional technique, as it transfers a bit stream to a communication channel using a sequence of so-called ofdms
 OFDM kaa vistaar chanelle acces paddati se orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces or MC-CDMA skim se multi-eusar channel main kiya ja saktaa he, taaki bahut saare upyog kartaaon ko vibhinn sab-carrier yaa kai upyog kartaaon ko code dekar ek hi madhyam kaa upyog karne kii anumati den saken
 The two types of RF power amplifier, the switching expander, are low-cost and use less battery power than the liner amplifier with the same output power
 baharhaal, ve keval apekshaakrit sthir aayam adhimishran sanket jaise ki koniya adhimishran or CDMA ke saath kaam karata he, lekin QAM or OFDM ke saath nahin
 haalanki swichan vistaarak ek saamaanya QAM samooh ke liye bhi puri tarah se anupyukt he, baavjood iske aksar QAM adhimishran siddhant kaa istemaal swichan vistaarakon ko in FM or anya weveform ke saath chalane main kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi QAM di-modulation kaa istemaal in swimming vistaarakon dwaara sanket praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term baseband modulation is synonymous with line code or symbol
 ye ankiy beet stream kaa anuroop besaband main sthanantaran karne kii paddati he, jiskaa istemaal ek pulse train, jo ki asatat sankhya vaala sanket level he, kaa prayog pratyaksh rup se modulatting ke jariye cabel main voltage or curent main kiya jaataa he
 Common examples are Unipolar, non-return-to-zero, Manchester and Alternate Mark Inverson coding
 pulse adhimishran yojana kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket kaa sthaanantaran anuroop besaband main do str ke sanket ke rup main adhimishran ke jariye pulse wave main karnaa he
 Some pulse modulation scheme narrowband analog signal to a numerical signal a fixed bit rate; Which can be transferred as an embedded numeric sender method, for example some line codes, allowing transfer
 aupchaarik myne main ye adhimishran yojana ke tahat nahin aate, kyonki ye chanelle kutalekhan yojana nahin hai, lekin inhen strot kutalekhan yojana kii tarah liya janaa chahie or kuch maamalon main anuroop se ankiy roopantaran takanic ke rup main
 Analog-over-analog methods: analog-over-digital paddatiyaan: Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga jyotish or kaal gananaa ke anusaar hindu dharm main vibhinn yoga varnit he They are as follows: How to remove the wedding auspicious sahi vivaah nahi milan hone se var ne aatmahatya kar lee aaj computer kaa jamaana he jise dekho apane apane computer main koi na koi software jyotish vaala daalkar baitha he,jaise hi kisi bhi var kanya kii vivaah vaali baat kii jaati he sidhe se var or kanya kii janm taarikh samay aadi ke saath kundali bana lee jaati he or unhe sidhe se vivaah milan ke liye dekha jaataa he,gun chakra nadee dosha or bhakut dosha aasaani se computer kaa software nikaal kar de detaa he,mangal chaahe vakri ho ast ho kam degree kaa ho use mangali dosha lagaate der nahi lagati he,chandramaa chaahe bal ho vruddh ho ast ho neech ho use raashi milan karte der nahi lagati he,kanya kaa guru bal chaahe bahut hi kamjor ho var kaa surya bal chaahe bilkul hi nahi miltaa ho lekin computer ke anusaar gun chakra bataane me katai der nahi lagati he or fataafat faisalaa bhi ho jaataa he,chaahe dono kaa chandra bal bahut hi acha ho
 In this way, how many meanings are lost, people who are not really aware of astrology at all, they easily start blaming the virtues of the bride and the girl and when something is asked from them, they hope to show their virtues as supreme

 Lagan Shuddhi: - Saturn is the twelfth Saturn in the tenth Mars and the third Venus is not good
 Moon and cruel planets are not good in the eighth house
 No planet is auspicious in the seventh house

 argala bhav yaa grah ke fal ko nishchit karti he arthath majbootee se sambhalati he
 Therefore, the position of the planet that keeps the emotion and the fruit of the planet from melting and eroding is called argala
 jis bhav yaa grah kii argala dekhni ho, usase 2, 4, 11 bhaavon main yadi grah ho to argalakaarak hote hai
 These places have 12, 10, 3 argala obstructions respectively
 yadi baadhak grah, argalakaarak se nirbal hon yaa kam sankhya main ho to ve baadhak sthaan hote hai
 But if there are three Papagrahs in the third, it is never interrupted and it is called opposite Argala
 is tritiy bhav vaali argala se bhi fal pusht hota he
 The fifth place is also the Argala place and the ninth place is its barrier place

 Distance from the Sun has an effect on their speed, due to which their speed is sometimes faster and sometimes slower
 doosraa prabhaav prithvi kaa padataa he
 We see their movements relative to the Earth which is orbiting the Sun itself, so when both are in the opposite direction, they appear to be running at a fast speed and the Earth moves forward when the Sun is on the same side, Due to which the stars are seen moving towards the west and also towards the east
 atah yah gati ‘vakr gati’ kehalaati he
 Virtually no planet is 'retrograde', but is seen to reverse due to the movement of the Earth
 ise ‘abhaasi gati’ kehete hai
 At other times, when these planets are seen moving from west to east of the stars, their motion is called 'margie motion'

 barahawein bhav main shani or ketu ke yoga se va shani or mangal ke yoga se adith tumor hota he
 The part of lagna clearly 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and till the seventh house is clear, it is called invisible cycle
 puraatan kaal se hi bharat main ‘saura varsh’ tathaa ‘chandra varsh’ prachlit hai
 One of them has been described in the Rig Veda and the other in the Atharvaveda
 saura varsh se rituon kaa gyaan hota he
 Most of our festivals and festivals are celebrated with lunar dates, months
 is kaaran hamaare purvajon ne in donon kaa samanvay kar ek varsh banaaya jise chandra-saura varsh kehete hai
 But every two or three years, a month is increased, which is called 'malamas', 'purushottammaas' or 'adhikamas', there are 13 Chandramas in that lunar year
 donon varshon kaa samanvay karne ke liye niyam banaaya gaya ki jab ek saura maas main do baar amavasya kaa ant hota ho, tab us maas ke naam ke do chandra maas ho jate hai or vah chandra-saura varsh 13 chandramaada kaa ho jaataa he
 The movement of Sun from one zodiac sign to another is called Sankranti
 ise ‘saura maas’ kehete hai
 The zodiac signs are 12, so the solar year also has 12 months, the value of which is 365
2422 days
 chandra varsh 354
372 din kaa hota he
 There is a difference of about 11 days in these
 saamanyatya 32 maas 16 din 4 ghadi bitne par ek maas kaa antar aa jaataa he
 In this way, when there is no Sankranti in two sides, it is called more mass
 ek hi naam ke do maason ke bich kaa maah shuddh hota he
 First Krishna Paksha and last Shukla Paksha 'more
 baishakh, jyeshtha, asadha, shravan, bhadrapada tathaa asina adhimaas ho sakate hai
 Mitton dated to 433 BC
 i saw that in 235 Chandramas and 19 solar years, ie 19 * 12 = 228 solar months, time is almost the same - there is a difference of about 1 hour
 19 saura varsh = 228 saura maas = 19 * 365
25 tra 6939
75235 chandra maas = 235 * 29
531 = 6939
785is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki prayek19 varsh main 228 saura maas or lagbhag 235 chandra maas hote hai arthath 7 chandra maas adhik hote hai
 In this way, you have to do more than 7 times in every 19 lunar-solar years
 yadi surya se chandramaa kendra main ho to jataka kii dharmik shiksha, gyan, buddhi or dhan neech prakaar kaa hota he
 Similarly, if the moon from the Sun is in position like Panfar i
e
 2, 5, 8 and 11, then in the above mentioned qualities the native is of ordinary type
 punah yadi surya se chandramaa apoklim arthath 3, 6, 9 or 12 main ho to jataka main uparyukt gunon kii prakharata hoti he
 If the moon is in its navamsa or is a friend-house or if it sees Jupiter or Venus, then the native is rich and happy
 mataantar se brihaspati se drusht hone par dhani tathaa shukr se drusht hone par sukhi hota he
 It has also been said that if a planet is not sighted on the moon, the person is lonely and dear
 aise jataka ke liye dhanoparjan main kathinaayeeyaan hoti he or uske sabhi kaaryon main vighn-baadhaayein hua karti he
 If there is no sight of any planet on the moon and there is no planet in the tenth place, then difficulties become unbearable
 karkesho vyayan swasmat lagnesho lagnto vyayam
 Vekshate Chetchacha Balo Spendsilo Bhavedhdruvam
 
 If the owner of an astrological planet is in the zodiac, if the lord of that zodiac looks at Dwadash, then the native is of an expensive nature
 varahamihir ke matanusaar yadi janm-sthit chandramaa arthath chandra-lagn se jab brihaspati, shukr evam budh shashth, saptam evam ashtum gat ho to vaise sthaan main ‘adhiyog’ hota he
 But the other sages also say that if Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are born in the seventh, seventh and eighth, then 'adhyayag' occurs
 kisi kisi rishi ne iskaa naam ‘adhyaksh-yoga’ bhi kaha he
 According to one scholar, 'lagna-adhiyoga' is called by him, when sitting in auspicious place 6, 7, 8 from the lagna, they are neither full of sin nor visible and there is no sinful place in fourth place
 mataantar se yah bhi uplabdh hota he ki chandra-lagn evam janm-lagn se 6, 7, 8 sthaan main yadi shubhagrah ho to adhiyog hota he
 If the sin is sitting, then 'sin-adhiyog' and if there is sin-eagle with the auspicious words written above, then it is 'mishra-adhiyog'
 is kaaran ‘adhiyog’ chah prakaar ke honge
 That is, three types of lagna and three types of moon lagna
 yahan dhyatavya he ki brihaspati, shukr evam budh 6, 7, 8 sthanon main ek-ek ho athwa do hi kisi sthaan main ho athwa teenon kisi ek hi sthaan main ho to bhi adhiyog hoga
 The result of this Adhiyog is that such a person is entitled to a throne according to the strength of the planets due to the 'auspicious Adhiyog'
 nirog, dirghajivi, shatruon par vijay praapt karne vaala tathaa sansaarik sukhon se yukt hota he
 On being a 'mishra Adhiyog', the person is a minister, head of office, a hero and a high official
 ‘paap-adhiyog’ hone par yuddh vibhaag kaa nayak evam padaadhikari athwa police vibhaag kaa adhikari hota he
 The result of 'lagna Adhiyog' is as follows - Such a person is the author of many types of scriptures, ie books related to science
 naanaa prakaar kii vidyaon kaa jaanane vaala, sena kaa nayak, nishkapat, mahatma evam sansar main yash or gun se sukh paane vaala hota he
 If there is a planet dotted with the moon, but if the second place planet is zero then it is called 'anfa Yoga'
 yahan surya ko chhod kar anya grahon kii upasthiti apekshit he
 According to the statement of 'yavana', if there is any planet in the tenth from the moon, then there is an 'uncountable yoga'
 ‘anpha’ yoga vaala jataka sheelven, kirtti-khyaati vaala, sansaarik vishyon se sukhi, santoshi, sharir se pusht or swasth hota he
 In Unfa Yoga, the planet of the planets placed from the moon, if the moon is in the moon from the moon, then the person is the chief of Ranotsuk, Krodhi, Mani and the bandits
 parantu uskaa rup aakarshak hota he
 If Mercury, then he is honored with painting, lecturer of music, scholar, celebrity, handsome and king
 yadi brihaspati ho to jataka atyant medhaavi, gambheer, gunajna, shuddh vyaavhaarik, dhani evam maani or raja se sammanit hota he
 If Venus is there then the person is attractive to women
 atyant budhimhan, dhan se sampann or bahuterey pashuon kaa swami bhi hota he
 If Saturn is a native, then the person is the master of virtues, leaders, pashwadis, and the voice of such a person is omnipotent but it is married to a wicked woman
 lagn, dwitiya, chaturth, pancham, saptam, ashtum, navam tathaa dwadash bhaavon ko ‘anupachaay’ yaa ‘peedrksh’ kehete hai
 The planets whose orbit is smaller than the Earth's orbit and in the middle of the Sun and the Earth's orbit are called internal or inward
 budh, shukr or prithvi ye aantarik grah hai
 Antaruti or infeasible form: When an internal planet is between the Sun and the Earth, that is, the Sun on one side of the planet and the Earth on the other side, and both the Sun and the planets have the same proportion of food, it is the Antutruti of that planet
 antargrah kaa sanyuti kaal koi grah ek prakaar kii yuti se chalakar punah usee prakaar kii yuti tak aane main jitna samay letaa he, vah us grah kaa sanyuti-kaal kehalaata he
 We can understand the conjugal period of Mercury in this way - Mercury's constellation period is 87
969 days and Earth's 365
256 days
 budh prithvi kii apeksha kaaphi tej koniya gati se chalata he
 See the following figure - Sun is in the middle of this shape
 iske sameep vaala vrutt budh kii kaksha usase baahar vaala prithvi kii kaksha or sabase baahar vaala vrutt bhachakra he
 Mercury and Earth are rotating in the direction of the arrow and the bhakthas of the cycle are increasing
 jab prithvi kaa kendra k par he, us samay budh kaa kendra k1 par he or surya kaa kendra, budh kaa kendra va prithvi kaa kendra ek rekha main he
 At this time, Mercury is passing away
 prithvi or budh donon apane-apane path par bhraman kar rahe hai
 After 87
969 days, Mercury completed a cycle and came back to K1, but the earth went ahead of the point, traveling at its slow speed
 ab budh or aage chalata hua bindu kha1 par pahunchataa he jahaan bindu kha par prithvi hoti he
 Again b, b1 and the sun came in a line i
e
 Mercury and Sun's offerings became equal i
e
 Mercury was again put to death
 jitna samay budh ne k1 se chalakar ek chakra puraa kar or aage chalakar kha1 tak aane main liya vah budh kaa sanyuti-kaal hua
 It can also be said in this way that the time taken by the earth to move from a to b is the conjunct of Mercury
 budh kaa sanyuti kaal 115
88 prithvi din he tathaa shukr kaa 583
92 prithvi din he
 Interiors have arts like the moon
 anrtgrah tab vakri hote hai jab prithvi ke sameep hote hai
 The reflected light of the planets comes on Earth, it is called the brightness of that planet
 yah prakaash do chizon par nirbhar karata he
 At a distance from the planet Earth
 jais-jaise grah prithvi ke paas aata jaataa he, chamak adhik hoti jaati he or dur jane par kam
