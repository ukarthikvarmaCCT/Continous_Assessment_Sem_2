 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure located outside the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at 'chhatragarh' on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town’s people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seathat had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 km north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important centre of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra" 
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed
 Fateh Muhammed in turn was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block
 Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and Saints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects
 “gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train
 He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty
 It is because of the beauty that arrests him much ”

 The three hydrological sub-systems control the hydrology of the lake
 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack,feed the lake
 61% ) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non – perennial accounts for 39%)
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1
76 cubic meters including direct precipitation over the lake about 0
87 cubic meters All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about 0
375 million cubic meters of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake
 On the north east a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal
 a tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake
 The lake experiences South–west and North-east monsoons during June to September and November to December respectively with average annual rainfall of 1,238
8 mimi, with 72 rainy days
 The maximum temperature of 39
9 °se
 and minimum temperature of 14 °se

 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have “undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes
 In summary, upstream silt led to a serious negative impact on habitat for wildlife and fishery resources, all of which led to shrinkage of the water surface area, salinity and lack of prolific growth of invasive freshwater aquatic weeds
 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority 
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people's representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the bharat sarkaar, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of "special problem grants" recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake's fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometre 
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in increasing the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species identified are green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, Spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat 
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one – fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species are identified:
 Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent
 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, india n roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997-98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were seen in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officers counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island In the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 kimi2 
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority's updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk developed exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British rule, in 1897–98, fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen's cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson 
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 dravyaman in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11,878 dravyaman during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India and one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were seen in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 kimi2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 october–january and may–june are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum 600-700 per day during december–january
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanized boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands
 It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973
 It’s the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season
 The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again
 The vast lake harbors 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants
 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector
 Chilka Lake is one of the best bird watching spots in India, and is also popular for fishing and angling
 Puri: This holy city is famous for the late 11th century built Jagannath temple
 The other major attraction here is the beach, from where you can witness the glorious sunrise and equally mesmerizing sunset
 It's said that a visit to Puri is incomplete without visiting Chilika Lagoon
 The Nirmaljhara Waterfall: This is an ideal place for pitching your picnic tent
 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 km from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake’s natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata via National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 km by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 km ॰ from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake
 There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon
 Before entering into the Nalbana Bird Sanctuary one has to obtain an entry permit
 The entry permit has to be produced at entry / exit points, at check gates as and whenever requested by officials

 Onions and garlic are vegetarian, but they stink, so they are not used on happy occasions
 yadi koi manushya anjaane main, bhulvash, galati se yaa kisi ke dabaav main aakar maansaahaar kar letaa he to bhi use shaakaahaari hi mana jaataa he
 Sanatana Dharma, the oldest religion in the whole world, is also based on vegetarianism

 Semi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods, but may include fish or eggs, or occasionally other meats
 ek packeterian aahaar main machhlee hoti he, magar maance nahin
 Those whose food consists of fish and poultry may define "meat" as mammal meat and identify themselves as vegetarians

 The Vegetarian Society, founded in 1847, wrote that it coined the term "vegetarian" from the Latin "vegetatus" meaning "lively"
 oxford english dictionari or anya maanak shabdkosh kehete hai ki "vegetable" shabd se yah shabd banaaya gaya he or pratyay ke rup main "-arian" joda gaya
 The OED writes that the term came into general use after the formation of the Vegetarian Society in 1847, although it provides two examples of usage from 1839 and 1842
 shaakaahaar ke praarambhik record isa purv 6thi shatabdi main pracheen bharat or pracheen greece main paae jate hai
 In both instances, diet is intimately linked to the idea of non-violence towards beings, and religious groups and philosophers promote it

 In 1847, the first vegetarian society was established in England, followed by Germany, the Netherlands and other countries
 rashtriya socitiyon kaa ek sangh, antarrashtriya shaakaahaari sangh, 1908 main sthapit kiya gaya he
 In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism has increased as a result of nutritional, ethical and, more recently, environmental and economic concerns during the 20th century
 shaakaahaar ke anek prakaar hai, jinamein vibhinn khaadya padaarth shaamil hai yaa hataa die gayi hai
 Protestant vegetarians discard products that use animal ingredients to make, or which use animal products in their production, even if they are not mentioned in their labels; For example cheese contains the animal rennet, gelatin
 kuch chini ko haddiyon ke koyale se safed banaaya jaataa he or alcohol ko gelatin yaa ghonghe ke chure or sterjion se saafe kiya jaataa he
 Some people describe themselves as "vegetarian" by consuming a semi-vegetarian diet
 anya maamalon main, ve khud kaa varnan bas "flexiterian" ke rup main kiya karte hai
 Such foods are consumed by people who are reducing their consumption of animal meat during the transition to a vegetarian diet or for health, environmental or other reasons

 Anhinga anhingaanhinga melanogasteranhinga rufaanhinga novaehollandiae family-level:anhinginae Ridgway, 1887plotidaeplottidaeplotinae Rafinesque, 1815plottinae Ptynginae Poche, 1904 Genus-level: Plottus Scopoli, 1777 Plotus Linnaeus 1766ptinx Bonaparte, 1828ptynx Möhring 1752 darter yaa snakebard, enhingide parivaar ke mukhya rup se ushnkaribandheey jalpakshi hai
 It has four living species, three of which are very common and widespread, while the fourth species is relatively rare and classified by the IUCN as nearly-extinct
 "snakebard" shabd kaa istemaal aam taur par kisi sangyojan ke bina kisi bhi ek kshetra main paayi jane vaali puri tarah se allopatric prajatiyon ke bare main bataane karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This refers to their long thin necks, which become snake-like when they swim by submerging their bodies in water or when fellow couples twist it during their persuasion
 "darter" kaa prayog kisi vishesh prajati ke bare main bataane ke kram main ek bhugolic shabdaawalee ke saath kiya jaataa he
 This indicates their way of obtaining food as they trap the fish in their thin, pointed beak
 american darter ko anhinga ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is called water turkey in South America for an apparently direct reason; Although the American darter is largely unrelated to wild turkeys, they are large and dark-colored with a long tail that is sometimes hunted for food
 "anhinga" tupi ajeena se vyutpann he jiskaa sandarbh ek sthaneey dharna ke anusaar ek dusht rakshasi junglee jeev se he; iskaa anuwaad aksar "shaitan pakshi " ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The name changed to Anhanga or Anhinga as it was transferred to the tupi-portuguese lingua geral
 haalanki 1818 main ek angreji shabd ke rup main iske pehle dastaveji istemaal main ise ek old water darter bataaya gaya tha
 Since then it has been used for the modern genus Anhinga as a whole
 enhingide, ling ke aadhaar par dvirupi pankh vaale vishaal pakshi hai
 They measure about 80 to 100 cm in length, with wingspan around 120 cm and weighing about 1,050 to 1,350 grams
 naron ke pankh kaale or gahare bhure rang ke hote hai, gardan ke peeche ek choti khadi kalgi or maadaa kii tulana main ek lambii chonch hoti he
 Females have a much more slender wing, especially on the neck and inner parts, and overall they are slightly larger
 donon main skandhasthiyon or gupt pankh par lambey bhure rang ke bindiyon vaale chitra paae jate hai
 The extremely sharp beak has a jagged edge, a desmognathous palate and no external nostrils
 dartron ke paas puri tarah se jhillidaar pair hote hai, inaki taangen choti hoti hai or sharir main kaaphi peeche vyavasthit hoti hai
 There is no impactless wing but the color of bare parts varies throughout the year
 haalanki prajnan ke dauraan unke chote gular kosh gulabi yaa pile rang se kaale rang main badal jate hai or nangi chehre kii twachaa anyathaa pile yaa pile-hare rang se firoza rang main badal jaati he
 The color of the pupil of the eye varies between yellow, red or brown colors according to the season
 bachche nagn rup main nikalate hai lekin jaldi hi safed yaa bhure roendaar ho jate hai
 The sound of the darter becomes a tick or rattle when flying or sitting
 ghonslon kii coloniyon main vayask tarataraane, ghurghuraane yaa khadkhadaane kii aawaaj main samvaad karte hai
 During reproduction, adults sometimes make a whining or deep breath or hissing sound
 navjaat shishu chillaahat yaa cheekhney kii aawaaj main samvaad karte hai
 The spread of darters is mostly in the tropics which are found in subtropical to nominal warm temperate regions
 ye aam taur par mithe pani ke jhiilon, nadiyon, daldalon, pani se bhare gaddhon main rahete hai or samudri taton ke paas khaare samudri jalaashyon, khadiyon, lagunon or mangrovon aksar kam hi paae jate hai
 They mostly remain sedentary and do not migrate; However birds living in extremely cold parts of the extension can migrate
 udaan kaa pasandida swaroop bahut ooncha udana or gliding karnaa hota he; fadafadaahat vaali udaan main ye apekshaakrit bojhil hote hai
 On dry ground, darters move with swift steps, often spreading wings for balance, just as pelicans do
 ye jhund main rahanaa chaahate hai - kabhi-kabhi lagbhag 100 pakshi - aksar sarason, bagulon yaa ibison ke saath mil jate hai; lekin ghonsle main atyadhik kshetreey hote hai: samoohon main ghonslaa banane vaale hone ke baavjood prajnak jode - vishesh rup se nar - aise kisi bhi anya pakshi ko konchenge jo unki lambii gardan or chonch kii pahunch ke daayre main aayega
 oriental darter ek lagbhag viluptpraaya prajati he
 Excessive use of other human interventions along with the destruction of natural habitats are the main reasons for the low number of darters
 darter mukhya rup se madhyam aakaar kii machhliyon ko khaakar jivit rahete hai; kabhi-kabhaar ye anya jaleey merudandadhari or bade merudanderhit jeevon ko apana bhojan banaate hai
 These birds are pedestrians who dive stealthily and ambush their prey; Then they use their sharp pointed beak to snatch food from that creature's body
 cervical vertebra 5-7 kii bhitari ore ek keel hota he jo mansapeshiyon ko jodakar ek kabje-jaisi pranali banaata he, yah gardan, sir or chonch ko bhaalaa phenkane kii tarah aage dhakelne main madad karata he
 After injuring their prey, they return to the ground where they bounce their food into the air and hold it back so that it can swallow its head first
 Like cormorants, they have an underdeveloped preen gland and their wings become wet during diving
 ghota lagane ke baad apane pankhons ko sukhaane ke liye darter ek surakshit sthaan par chale jate hai or apane pankhons ko failaa lete hai
 Predators of darters are mainly large carnivorous birds including Passerines such as the Australian Raven and House Crow and Predatory Birds such as Marsh Harriers Complex or
 crocodise magaramachhon dwaara shikaar kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 But many potential predators are better known for catching the darter and trying it
 lambii gardan or nukili chonch ke saath-saath "darting" pranali pakshiyon ko apekshaakrit bade maansaahaari stanadhariyon se bhi khatarnaak bana detii he or kisi atikaramanakari ke saamne niskriy hokar bachaav karne yaa bhaag jane kii bajaay ve hamalaa karne ke liye unki ore aage badhate hai
 They usually breed in colonies, sometimes mixing with cormorants or herons
 darter ke jode kam se kam ek prajnan kaal ke liye ek hi saathi se joda banaate hai
 a variety of demonstrations are used for persuasion
 nar apane pankhons ko uthaakar unhen baari-baari se lahraane kii style main, chonch ko jhukaakar yaa chatkaakar yaa sambhavit saathiyon ko samaj main aane vaale ishaare kar maadaaon ko aakarshith karne kaa pradarshan karte hai
 To strengthen the pair's bonding, fellow couples rub or wave their beak, lift it upward or tilt their neck uniformly
 jab ek saathi duusare ko raahat dene ke liye ghonsle main aata he, nar or maadaa vahi pradarshan kaa prayog karte hai jiskaa prayog nar premalap ke dauraan karte hai; parivartan ke dauraan pakshi ek duusare par "jamhai" bhi lete hai
 Breeding is seasonal at the northern end of their spread; In other places they can be found breeding throughout the year
 ghonsle ped kii daaliyon se bane hote hai; ye aamtaur par pani ke paas pedo yaa narkat par banaae jate hai
 Males usually collect nesting materials and bring them to the female which completes most of the actual construction work
 ghonslaa banane main keval kuch hi dinon kaa samay lagata he or jode ghosle kii jagah par maithun karte hai
 The size of the clutch is two to six eggs, which is light green
 andey 24-48 ghanton ke bheetar die jate hai or 25 se 30 dinon tak inhen sene kaa kaam kiya jaataa he, jisaki shuruyaat pehla anda dene ke baad se hoti he; ye asamakaalik rup se bachche nikaalte hai
 To heat the eggs, the parents cover them with their large flabby feet, as they lack an egg hatching patch like their relatives
 antim rup se nikaalane vaale bachche ko aam taur par thode se uplabdh bhojan ke saath varshon tak bhookha rahanaa padataa he
 Bi-paternal care is performed and young children are considered helpless by parental care
 choti umr main inhen aanshik rup se pache hue bhojan ko ulti ke rup main pet se nikaal kar khilaayaa jaataa he, jaise-jaise ye bade hote hai inhen is tarah kaa puraa bhojan khilaa kar paala jaataa he
 After being flyable, the young bird is fed for another two weeks when they learn to hunt for themselves
 ye pakshi lagbhag 2 saalon main yon paripakvata tak pahunchate hai or aam taur par lagbhag 9 saalon tak jivit rahete hai
 The maximum possible lifespan of a darter is about 16 years
 darter ke andey khaane laayak hote hai or kuch log ise swaadisht maanate hai; log inhen sthaneey str par bhojan ke rup main jamaa karte hai
 Adults are also eaten occasionally because they are relatively fleshy birds; However, like other fish-eating birds, such as cormorants or sea ducks, they do not taste particularly good
 bacchon ko paalane ke liye kuch jagahon par darter ke andon or ghonslon ko bhi ikattha kiya jaataa he
 This is sometimes done for food but some strollers in Assam and Bengal train pet darters to be used in capturing cormorants
 haal ke dashakon se ghumkkadon ke ek jagah bas jane kii badhati sankhya ke saath unki saanskrithik viraasat par lupt hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 On the other hand, as evidenced by the etymology of "anhinga" in detail, it seems that Tupi is considered an American darter, a type of ominous bird
 yah parivaar suuli upasamooh ke anya pariwaron yani phalocrocoracidy or sulidi ke kaaphi nikat he
 Cormorants and anhingas are largely the same in terms of their body and foot skeletons and may possibly belong to the same class
 vastav main anhinga ke kai jeevashmon ko pehle jalkaag yaa shig mana jaataa tha 
 pehle ke kuch lekhakon ne darter ko upapariwaar anhingine ke rup main phalocrocoracidy main shaamil kiya tha lekin aajkal aam taur par ise overlamping mana jaataa he
 However, as it is very well agreed with fossil evidence, some people place Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidi jointly in the superfamily Phalacrocoracoidea
 suuli ko bhi unke lakshanik pradarshan vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ekajute kiya jaataa he jo shaareerik banaavat or diene anukram data dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye anusaar filogeni ke saath sahamat hota he
 Because the lack of multiple display behaviors in the darter is compared with gannets, all of these are simplexomorphies that are not found in frigatebirds, tropicbirds, and pelicans
 jalkaagon kii tarah lekin anya pakshiyon ke vipareet darter apni hywide haddi kaa prayog pradarshan main gular thili ke failaav main karte hai
 Whether pairwise gesture displays are other synapomorphies of darters and cormorants that were once again abandoned by later people, or whether it evolved independently into do-it-yourself darters and cormorants, is not clear
 nar dwaara pankh-uthaakar kiya jane vaala pradarshan suuli kii ek sinapomorphi prathit hoti he; lagbhag sabhi jalkaagon or shaigon kii tarah lekin lagbhag sabhi ganeton or boobij ke vipareet, darter pradarshan main apane pankhons ko uthaate samay apni kalaayiyon ko modakar rakhte hai, lekin unka baari-baari se pankh laharaana, jiskaa pradarshan ve udne se pehle bhi karte hai, yah adwitiya he
 That they often balance themselves with their outstretched wings during a walk is probably an otomorphy of darters that is required to be fleshy compared to other crosses
 suuli ko paramparaagat rup se pelecaniformes main or uske baad "ucchstareey waterbard" ke ek parafilatic samooh main shaamil kiya jaataa tha
 Possible signs of jointing them, such as all webbed toes and a bare gular sac, are now known to be convergent and the pelicans are apparently closer relatives to the stork than to the cross
 isliye suuli or fregaterds - or kuch pragaitihaasik sambandhiyon ko - phalocrocoraciforms ke rup main teji se alag-alag kiya ja rahaa he
 Four surviving species of darters are identified, all falling into the genus Anhinga, although the Old World was once more often referred to as A
 Melanogaster used to be kept together as subfamilies
 ve adhik vishisht america darter ke sandarbh main ek superspesij bana sakate hai
 The extinct porters of Mauritius and Australia known only from bones were described as Anhinga Nana and Anhinga Parva
 lekin vastav main ye lambii poonch vaale jalkaag kramshah or chote dhabbedaar jalkaag se sambandhit rahe ho sakate hai jinhen microcarbo africans nainas kaha janaa chahie tha - badi vidambnaa he ki latin shabd nainas kaa matlab hota he "bouna"
 antim plastosin kaal kaa "anhinga laticepse" australian darter se bahut adhik alag nahin he; yah sambhawatah antim him yug kaa ek vishaal peleosbaspesij rahaa hoga
 The fossil record of Anhingidae is relatively dense but already very apomorphic and appears to be lacking in its base
 phalocrocoraceforms main rakhe gaye anya parivaar kramagat rup se puure eosin kaal main dikhaai dete hai, sabase alag - frigaterds - jinhen lagbhag 50 maa se janaa jaataa he or sambhawatah peleosin mul ke hai
 Fossil gannets have been known since the mid-eocene period, and fossil cormorants appear shortly thereafter, with the darter's origin as a distinct link possibly around 40–50 Ma, probably earlier
 jeevashm anhingidi praarambhik meosin kaal se jane jate hai; inke jaise kai pragaitihaasik darter ke saath-saath kuch or vishisht peedi jo aajkal vilupt ho gaye hai inkaa varnan abhi bhi jivit ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The diversity was highest in South America and therefore it is possible that this family originated there
 kuch peedhiyaan jo antat vilupt ho gayi he, ve bahut badi thim or inaki ek udaan rahit hone kii pravriti kaa ullekh pragaitihaasik dartron ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Their uniqueness has been doubted, but this is likely due to "anhinga" Fraleyi being relatively similar to Macranhinga, not because of their similarity with living species
 anhinga ke pragaitihaasik sadasyon kaa prasar sambhawatah aaj ke samaan jalwaayu main hua tha jiskaa vistaar apekshaakrit garm europe se lekar apekshaakrit thande miosin tak hua tha
 Because of its considerable stamina and continental expansion capabilities, the younger species lived more than 20 Ma
 jaisaa ki bumadhya rekha ke aasapaas kendrit jeevashm prajatiyon ke jaev bhugol se pramanit hota he, jisamen yuva prajatiyon kaa vistaar america se baahar purab kii ore hua tha, aisa lagata he ki hadlee cell is jinas kii safalataa or astitv kaa pramukh kaarak rahaa tha
 Protoplotus, a small paleogene phalacrocoraciform from Sumatra, was considered an early darter in olden times
 haalanki ise apane swayan ke parivaar protoplotidi main bhi rakhaa jaataa he or sambhawatah yah suuli kaa ek aadhariya sadsy or / yaa jalkaagon tathaa dartron ke aam purvaj ke kareeb ho saktaa he

 From England, he wrote a letter to Dasababu and expressed his desire to work with him
 rabindranath thakur kii salaah ke anusaar bharat waapas aane par ve sarvapratham mumbai gayi or mahatma gandhi se mili
 Gandhi lived in Mani Bhavan in Mumbai
 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe
 san 1934 main jab subhash austria main apana ilaaj karaane hetu tehre hue the us samay unhen apni pustak likhane hetu ek angreji jaanane vaale typist kii aavashyaktaa hui
 a friend of his met an Austrian woman named Emily Shankel

 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose
 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Anita is still alive
 uskaa naam anita bose phalf he
 Anita Faf sometimes comes to India to meet her father's family
 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine

 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia

 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan

 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya

 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he

 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity

 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha

 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready

 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed
