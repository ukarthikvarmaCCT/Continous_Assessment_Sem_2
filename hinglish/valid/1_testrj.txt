 o
 henry yaa wiliam sidney porter prasiddh american lekhak the
 He was born on September 11, 1862 in Greensboro, North Carolina and died on June 5, 1910 in New York
 pichley varshon main vah apana bich kaa naam 'sidney' hi likhaa karte the
 He left school at the age of sixteen, but his acuity to read and write was not lost
 bachapan main unhone greensbaro kii ek dawaaiyon kii dukaan main kaam kiya tha, jahaan ab tak uski jainti manaayi jaati he
 At the age of nineteen, he went to live in the area of texas to improve his health
 vahaan usne ghudsawaari sikh lee or junglee, adiyal ghodo ko bhi vash main karne laga
 Then he got a job in a farm office in Austin
 aapane aas-paas ke chitramay jivan kii jin vastuon kaa bhi use parichay hua, ve sab kii sab uski kahaniyon main chhan aayin
 This is the reason why his stories occur mostly in pasture territories, Central America or New York
 shahari jivan kii kahaniyon main jinke liye vah prasiddh he, jivan kii vidmbanaaon kisvikrati hai
 They are a reflection of their own bitter experiences
 apane pandraa varsh ke jis texas pravaas main unhone vivaah kiya or ek putree ke pita bane, usee main khedjanak ghataanaon ne unki umango ko dhank liya
 He got the job of counting the notes in a bank, but within a few days he came to know of a mess of a few thousand dollars in his account, he also missed the job
 aansa lagata he ki uske maalik use sajaa dilaanaa nahin chaahate the, isliye vah bina roak-tok, lagbhag ek varsh tak huston shahar ke ek akhbaar main kaam karata rahaa
 Then, perhaps he moved to New Orleans to avoid arrest, from where he took tickets for Tojillo and Honduras
 'cabejas and kings' naamak uski sarvapratham pustak main varnit, saahas or jeevat kii sari kahaniyon kaa ghatnasthal yaheen se mila he
 His wife's illness called him back to Austin
 unke lautate hi vah mar gayi
 Then he was tried and convicted for the crime of Khayanat
 wiliam porter, teen varsh or teen maheenon tak jail main rahe
 He was an ardent prisoner with an enthusiastic conviction
 lekin uske jivan par is kaal kii kaali chaaya hameshaa dikhaai padati rahi
 It was here that he developed compassion for the poor and this led to many of his best stories, out of which a play called 'alias jimmy Ballantine', based on the story 'heart Transformation', proved to be the best drama of the time
 jail casipaahiyon ke oran henry naamak captain ne hi uske upnaam ko khoj nikaala gaya he
 Porter thought that 'O Henry' was enough to sign
 unhone jab likhnaa shuru kiya to sampadakon se apana naam gupt rakhane kii bhi prarthana kii
 In New York, O
 Henry lived in the rooms of the neighborhoods of Madison Square and Irving Place and struggled fiercely to pay rent, earning money from his stories
 rabart ech0 davis, bartlet maaris, irvin es0 kaab aadi mitron ne or duusare kai likhkon or sampadakon ne unke kamaron kaa varnan kiya he
 They lived in an outside room
 jisaki khidkiyaan farsh tak faili hui thim,
 Sitting here, he would stare at the passersby and weave around them a net of creatures
 unhone ashaavadi, ekanki saamaanya vyaktiyon ko apni kahaniyon ke paatr bananaa shuru kiya
 Imagined girls who roam the cities to find business and love; Those young men who seek more advantages than others and drunken and unworthy men, who also suffer misfortune with arrogance and sometimes display sentimentality like the characters of the stories, become the storyline
 yadi kathavstu dukhaant hui to o0 henry usamen sthaneey boliyon kaa namak-mirch laga detaa
 No incident was so dull for him in which he could not shine
 thik isi jagah aakar usne us charam bindu yaa mode kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase uski anek kahaniyon kaa ant apratyaashit banane laga
 This is evident in short stories such as "decorated room," "roof room" and "spring menu", some larger stories also show this element
 america ke shrotao me, puraane jamaane ke aag ke chaaro ore baithkar kahaniyaan sunne ke yug se, is prakaar ke kisson ke prati vishesh lagaav rahaa he
 The stories of O
 Henry seem to be elaborate replicas of these traditional stories
 kathanak ke to vah jaadugar the or ansi-ansi kalpanarmya paristhitiyaan nirmaan karane main vah siddhhast the, jahaan uske paatr jeevanajite nahin balki usase khilwaad karte prathit hote he
 It was his intention to entertain the readers and to get his curiosity awakened, he has done various types of slapstick by his students
 ve romance ke bhukhe, bure vakt kaa himmat se muqabla karne vaale, kuleenata kaa dhong karne vaale or aadhunik 'alif-laila' kii rangeen duniya main vicharne vaale chitrit kiye gayi hai
 He has hardly done any detailed and sagopang analysis of man
 unhone to manushya kaa, aadhunik shahari jivan ke bhavar main fase hue, asahaay vyakti ke rup main hi, darshan karaayaa
 Nansi of the 'sneh Deep' story simply refuses to accept a shopkeeper as a girl because she works in a shop and says, "there is no such thing
" aaj ke bhrasht samaaj ko kism khojane kii aadat pad gayi he
 "he may have depicted a man so fallen that he is not even ashamed of his weaknesses
 uski sab kahaniyon ke neeche sahrudayta or sahanubhuti kii anterdhara bah rahi he
 He was always ready to give a place in the wider family of humanity to every ill-fated or backward person in life
 kabhi-kabhi ve uskaa manoranjan karte hai, kabhipane jivan kii vidmbanaaon se use dukhi kar dete he or kabhi vah bhavuk bhi ho uthta ahi parantu har haalat main, vah bhagya kii har chhedchhad ko sweekaar kar letehai or uske khalanaayak bhi haasyaaspad hi ho pate hai- dusht nahin
 O
 Henry's art flourished in his second book, The Four Million, which also gained him much popularity
 pratham baar prakashit hone ke chalis varsh baad, uski 'uphaar' naamak kahani kaa chalchitr bana
 Many compilations of his other stories were published such as 'sneh Deep', 'spirit of the West', 'voice of the City', 'bhagyachakra', 'choices', 'dhandhe Ki Baat', 'life Cycle'
 uski mratyu ke baad teen kitaaben or chhapin- 'safedposh thag', 'aawaara' or 'bhuule-bhatke'
 The stories of O
 Henry remained very famous during his lifetime, and it can be said that he tried to get into the depths of the heart, expressing displeasure with the vow of human nature in both his creations and his ideology
 vah manushya ke sachche rup ko chhipaane vaale, roodhi or vishwaas ke har parde ko cheer kar satya ke darshan karana chaahate the
 He used to say that the true feeling of truth can only be in the narrative
 apane nijee anubhav se is nishkarsh par pahunch kar, o0 henry ne vidwaanon ke is vishwaas ko fir se sthapit kar diya ki aitihaasik tathy kii apeksha, kalpana hi soundarya kaa adhik prabhaavshaalee avishkaar karti he
 Storytelling was also being changed by professional storytellers
 manushya ke bartaav ko prabhavit karne vaale har hetu ke mul, maansik or shaareerik kamiyon main dhunde jane lage the or vyakti ke jivan par saamaajik prabhaavon kaa moolyankan kiya jane laga tha
 If o had survived, where would Henry have reached- it is difficult to say, but his contribution would have been considerable
 aaj o0 henry kii kahaniyaan, uske yug ke pratik ke rup main hi padhi jaati he
 Just as the stories of Bret Hart revive the mine workers, gamblers and contractors of the western frontier, the stories of O
 Henry set the world around 1900
 jab usne ghudsavaaron kaa majaak udaaya, tab spain kii ladaai ke ghudsavaaron kii yaad jaataa thi
 Americans find the small states of Central America as bizarre as the Achuria described in its story! He was self-conscious and reticent by nature
 apane kuch ghanisht mitron- jo mukhyat: akhabaaron ke sampadak the- kii sohabat or jaraa si sharaab use priy thi
 He always had a shortage of time, because his stories were very short and everything he would get in his change would immediately end
 sampadakon kii nirantar maang ke neeche vah pisataa rahaa
 For him, life was a chaotic business, in which the manner of award was very cynical
 fir bhi usne, is vyavhaar hi har ghup-chhaanv kaa swaagat muskaara kar kiya
 Luck and coincidence play an important part in his stories
 du:kha or pidaa bhi paryaapt maatra main he, parantu kadavaahat kahin nahin ghusane paayi he
 By the time she was finished at the young age of 47, her best works might not have been written by then, but what she wrote will remain indelible in her narrative and some of her stories will remain immortal

4 gurushadi nagar farrukhabad, farrukhabad, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, philosophical terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very useful and useful
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects

 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 The state government has taken this decision

 'bharata-bharati' can be said to be a successful experiment of finding solutions to overcome the present and future plight by Maithilisharan Gupta, reflecting indigenous love
 bharat darshan kii kaavyatmak prastuti 'bharat-bharti' nishchit rup se kisi shodh se kam nahin aanki ja sakati
 Maithilisharan Gupta has written 5 original plays - 'anagh', 'chandrahas', 'tilottama', 'passive Resistance' and 'immersion'
 unhone bhaas ke chaar naatakon- ‘swapnvasavadatta’, ‘pratimaa’, ‘abhishek’, ‘avimaarak’ kaa anuwaad kiya he
 In these plays 'anagh' is a play written in a poem based on the story of the Bodhisattva related to the Jataka story
 nitant takneekee drushti se ise ‘kavy naatak’ nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 'chandrahas' is a drama that evokes history

 Tilottama is a mythological drama
 ye naatak pehle prakashit ho chuke hai, parantu ‘niskriy pratirodh’ or ‘visarjan’ pehali baar prakashit ho rahe hai, is arth main naye hai
 Gupta has also taken care of diversity in Bhasa's selection of translated plays

 Maithlisharan Gupta's first standing dialect poem titled 'hemant' was printed in Saraswati
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan vyakaran kehalaata he
 Grammar is the discipline through which to speak, speak, read and write in a pure language
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke likhane, padhane or bolne ke nishchit niyam hote hai
 It is necessary to follow these rules to maintain the purity and beauty of the language
 ye niyam bhi vyakaran ke antargat aate hai
 Grammar is an important part of language study
 kisi bhi "bhashaa" ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "vyakaran" kehalaata he, jaise ki sharir ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "sharirshastra" or kisi desh pradesh aadi kaa varnan "bhugol"
 That is, the grammar does not rotate a language by its command, it manifests the position tendency of the direct language
 "chalata he" ek kriyaapad he or vyakaran padhe bina bhi sab log ise isi tarah bolte hai; iskaa sahi arth samaj lete hai
 Grammar will analyze this term to show that it has two components - "walks" and "is"
 phir vah in do avyavon kaa bhi vishleshan karke batayega ki "chalata" or "he" ke bhi apane avyav hai
 Two characters are evident in "chal"; But the grammar will make it clear that "ch" has two letters "ch" and "A"
 isi tarah "l" main bhi "l" or "a"
 These letters can no longer be fragments; These are the "letters"
 vyakaran in aksharon kii bhi shrenee banayega, "vyanjan" or "swar"
 "ch" and "L" are consonants and "A" vowels
 chi, chi or li, lee main swar hai "i" or "i", vyanjan "ch" or "l"
 This type of analysis is very useful; It is not a waste business
 yah vishleshan hi "vyakaran" he
 The other name of grammar is also "shabhanushasana"
 vah shabdasambandhi anushaasan karata he - batalaata he ki kisi shabd kaa kis tarah prayog karnaa chahie
 The tendency of words in the language remains its own; Words do not work in the language of grammar
 parantu bhashaa kii pravriti ke anusaar vyakaran shabdaprayog kaa nirdesh karata he
 It does not rule the language, it does its teaching according to its position
 yadhyapi bahu nadhishe tathaapi path putr vyakaranam
 Swajno Shwajno Mahabhutsakalam Shakalam padho taaki 'swajan' 'shwajan' na bane or 'sakal' 'shakal' na bane tathaa 'sakrut' 'shakrut' na ban jaay
 ) sansar main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm kahaan hua? The linguists of the world have unanimously accepted that the most ancient Vedas in the literature available on this earth
 rugveda sansar kaa pracheenatam sahitya he
 When a language starts to glow with the richness of literature, then its grammar is needed
 "veda" kaisaa mahatvapurn sahitya he, yah isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki ise itane dinon tak manushya ne gale se lagaakar praanon kii tarah isaki raksha kii he
 It is not a simple task to keep each of his mantras memorized in the form and keep his "sound" safe
 sookhe chane chaba chabaakar tapasvi brahmanon ne vedon kii raksha kii he
 That is why he remained
 veda jaise mahatvapurn sahitya ke vyakaran kii jarurat padi
 With the help of grammar, Jnanpipasu of far-off regions can understand the literature originating elsewhere and people are able to understand it even after the passage of eternity
 veda jaisaa sahitya deshkal kii seemaa main bandhaa rahanevaala nahin he; isliye prabud "dev" janon ne apane raja se prarthana kii-"hamaari bhashaa kaa vyakaran bananaa chahie
 You make grammar of our language
 " tab tak vedbhaasha "avyaakruta" thi; use yon hi log kaam main laa rahe the
 Indra accepted the prayers of the Devas by saying "varam" and then breaking the posts between them to distinguish the nature suffix etc
 - became grammar
 is prakaar bharat main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm hua
 Grammar does not stop the movement of language, as stated earlier; And neither does it change with grammar
 kisi desh pradesh kaa bhugol kya vahaan kii gatividhi ko roktaa badalata he? bhashaa to apni gati se chalati he
 Grammar is neither its regulator nor its inhibitor
 haan, sahasron varsh baad jab koi bhashaa kisi duusare rup main aa jaati he, tab vah vyakaran is ke liye anupayogi ho jate he
 Then it will have a separate grammar
 vah purana vyakaran tab bhi bekaar na ho jayega; us puraani bhashaa kaa yatharth parichay detaa rahegaa
 This is not an ordinary utility
 haan, yadi koi kisi bhashaa kaa vyakaran apane agyaan se galat bana de, to vah hi galat hoga
 The language will not follow it and even if it violates the rules of that grammar, the language will not be called wrong
 sanskrit ke ek vaiyaakaran ne "punsu" ke saath "punkshu" pad ko bhi niyambaddh kiya; parantu vah vahiin dharaa rah gaya
 Nobody ever said "punkshu"
 panini ne "vishram" shabd sadhu batalaaya; "shram" kii hi tarah "vishram"
 But "rest" continued in Sanskrit literature; Running and going on
 bhashaa kii pravriti he
 When Panini could not stop the flow of language, then what is the number of others? vyakaran tathaa bhashavigyaan do shabdashastra hai; donon kaa kaaryakshetra bhinn-bhinn he; par ek duusare ke donon sahyogi hai
 Grammar considers mere usage; While linguistics describes the origin of the original form of "verse" as the method of etymology or evolution
 vyakaran yah batalaayegaa ki "na" kaa rup "a" yaa "an" ho jaataa he
 Vyanjanadi words have "A" and Swaradi has "an" - "unique", "unique"
 jab nishedh main pradhanta ho, tab samaas nahin hota - ayan brahmano naasti", "asya upama naasti"
 Elsewhere "abraham: Vedadhyayan Mandadara: Santi" and "anupam Kashmirsundarya Darsham" etc
 will be compounded; Because prohibition is not positive
 vyakaran samaas bataa degaa or kahan samaas thik rahegaa, kahan nahin; yah sab batalaana "sahitya shaastra" kaa kaam he
 The consonant from the "N" becomes "A" and the alphabet becomes "A"
 isi "an" ko saswar karke "an" rup main "samaas" ke liye hindi ne le liya he - "anhoni", "anjaan" aadi
 These diverse forms of "no" do not make grammar; He fills the "narrative" of the created forms
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he ki vah "na" ke in roopon par prakaash daale
 The grammar will show that by adding the suffix "no" to a metal, adding the Hindi noun "aa" to it becomes expressive nouns - coming, going, getting up, sitting, etc
 parantu vyakaran kaa kaam yah nahin he ki aa, ja, uth, baith aadi dhaatuon kii vikasapaddati samajhaae
 This work is of linguistics
 sanskrit main aisi sangyaayen napunsak varg main prayukt hoti hai - aagamanam, gamnam, utthanam, upaveshnam aadi
 But in Hindi there is a pamprayoga- "when did you come?" The grammar will not tell why Hindi has used
 vah anvakhyaan bhar karegaa -"aisi sangyaayen punwargeey rup rakhti he" bas! yah bataanaa bhashavigyaan kaa kaam he ki aisa kyon hua! When a language takes a word from another language, it rules it out - governs its speed according to its grammar
 hindi kaa "dhoti" shabd angreji main gaya, to vahaan ise angreji vyakaran ko shirodharya karnaa padaa
 It is used in English - "brining our dhoties"
 vahaan "dhoti" kaa bahuvachan "dhotiyaan" na chalegaa
 The "bring Our Dhots" experiment will be misunderstood there
 isi tarah angreji kaa "foot" shabd hindi ne liya or apane shashan main rakhaa
 The plural of "foot" in English is "feet"; But English grammar will not work in Hindi
 prayog hota he - "chaar foot oonchaai", "chaar feet oonchaai" galat he
 "height" is also incorrect; "height" is pure
 "nichaai unchaai" hota he; "nichai oonchaai" nahin
 In Sanskrit, the dialects of unambiguous words become interchangeable - "poet samagatau"; This will not happen in Hindi
 "do kavi aae" kaha jayega
 Similarly "sanskriti samagatau" in Sanskrit
 hindi main "rajdampati" sarvatra
 It is also a process of assimilating testamentary words to cut the mismatched form and make it into your mail
 hindi kaa "ganga ji" shabd angreji main gaya; par "genzis" banaakar
 English took the word "lantern" from Hindi; But by making "lantern" and "hospital" by "hospital"
 "hospital" bhi hindi main galat he
 Forms like "hospital" and "doctor" are not acceptable to Hindi
 hindi kaa vyakaran niyaman karegaa ki hindi main vah uccharan he hi nahin, jise swar par ulta top rakh kar prakat kiya jaataa he
 Here "doctor" runs like "master"
 haan, nagari lipi main angreji bhashaa likhni ho tab vah ulataa top kaam aayega - da doctor vaaz phulish"
 In the same way, if you want to write a language like Persian in Nagari, then "market", "need", etc
 forms; But there will be no dot below in Hindi - "there is a market for essential things
 " urdu ke sher aadi likhane hon to bhi neeche vindi lag jaaegi
 This form of words will be from the grammatical case of grammar
 mirza vazeer ali khan, chauthe nawab vazeer al mamalik e evadh the
 Within four months of his reign, he was separated by both the British and his subjects, and was eventually remanded and imprisoned in the fort of Chunar and died there
 jab bhi hindustan main gulam bharat main angrejon ke khilaaf pehle kranti kii baat hoti he to eka ek hi hamaare jehan main 1857 yaa uske aas paas ke saalon kii tasviir ubharne lagati he par shaayad bahut kam logon ko hi pataa hoga kii 1857 se bhi 58 saal pehle 1799 main nawab vazeer ali khan ne angrejon ke khilaaf banaras se hi baghawat kaa jhanda buland kar diya tha

 unhen angrej penson ke taur pe dedh lakh rupee salaana diya jaataa rahaa tathaa tatkaaleen governor general sar jon shor ne hukum diya kii vajeer ali ko kahi ghumne yaa kisi se milane se naa roka jaye
 At the age of 18, Wazir Ali was hated by the British for taking the plank on the basis of the false accusation and swore to rebel against the British



 is bich angrejon kaa aglaa hukum aayaa jisame unhen banaras se british mukhyalay kolkata bhejne ko kaha gaya
 This further ignited the fire of hatred of Wazir Ali, and he summoned his loyal warlords, Izzat Ali and Waris Ali, and secretly prepared the Lashkar of 200 soldiers
 14 janvari 1799 ko is jang kaa aagaaj ho gaya
 Wazir Ali expressed his desire to meet the then Commander George Frederick Cherry against the decision to remove himself from Benares
 is par cheri ne hami bhar di
 Wazir Ali along with his warlords Izzat Ali and Varis Ali arrived at their home at Cherry's Mint House with their Lash Lashkar
 baatcheet ke dauraan ho unhone hamalaa bol diya nawab kii fuj jo pehle se taiyaar thi usne commander camp ko gherkar santariyon ko kabje main le liya
 The rebels killed seven British soldiers, including Commander Cherry, Capt
 Kanway, Robert Graham, Capt

 Davis in the Nadesar area, the rebels also attacked here and killed several sentries
 patni ,bacchon or do naukaron ko davis ne chat pe chipa diya or baagiyon se ladane ke liye khud baahar aa gaya
 Sitting behind the staircase leading to the terrace, Davis held the rebels for a long time
 british ke baghawat kii khabar aag kii tarah fail gayi or magistrate ko bachaane ke liye british fuj nadesar pahuch gayi
 However, the rebels then had to retreat and thousands of rebels joined the Nawab at these times
 nawab ke baghawat ko kuchalane ke liye kolkata se general arsakin ko fuj lekar banaras aana pad gaya
 The rebels could not stand in front of Arskin's heavy army
 saikado log maare gayi bachane kaa koi rasta naa dekh sabane aapasi sahamati se vahaan se nikal jane kii yojana banaai vajeer ali bhi jaan bachaate bachaate rajasthan ke butwal pahunche
 Then the then British emperor of Jaipur gave him a banquet to stay here
 nawab ke saath dhokaa karke usne 1799 main vajeer ali ko angrejon ke hawaale kar diya
 The British sent Wazir Ali to Fort William Jail in Kolkata
 17 saal jail main gujaarne ke baad 1817 main nawab kii jail main hi maut ho gayi
 The tomb of Wazir Ali still exists in the Cassia Bagan of West Bengal

 Shree Shukdev Muni said, "O Parikshit! When Kamdev was consumed by Lord Shankar's curse, his wife Rati became very distraught in her husband's disconnection
 usne apane pati kii punah praapatti ke liye devi parvati or bhagwaan shankar ko tapasya karke prasann kiya
 Parvati ji blessed her that your husband will be born in Yadukul as the son of Lord Krishna and you will find it at Shambarasur
 isiliye rati shambrasur ke ghar mayawati ke naam se daasi kaa kaary karne lagi
 "here Kamadeva is situated in Rukmani's womb
 samay aane par rukmani ne ek ati sundar balak ko janm diya
 The beauty, modesty, virtue etc
 of that child were all similar to Shri Krishna
 jab shambrasur ko pataa chalaa ki meraa shatru yadukul main janm le chukaa he to vah vesh badal kar prasutikagrih se us das din ke shishu ko har laayaa or samudr main daal diya
 a fish was swallowed by the infant in the sea and a fish was swallowed by a crocodile
 vah magaramchh ek machuaare ke jaal main aa fasaa jise ki machuaare ne shambrasur kii rasoi main bhej diya
 When that crocodile's stomach was torn, a very beautiful child came out of it
 usko dekh kar shambrasur kii daasi mayawati ke aashcharya kaa thikaana na rahaa
 She started raising that child
 usee samay devarshi naarad mayawati ke paas pahunche or bole ki he mayawati! yah tera hi pati kaamdev he
 It originated in Yadukul and was brought into the Shambarasura sea
 tu iskaa ytn se laalan-paalan kar
 After saying this, Narada went away from there
 us balak kaa naam pradhyumna rakhaa gaya
 Pradyuman became young in a short period of time
 pradhyumna kaa rup lavanya itnaa adbhut tha ki ve saakshaat shri krishnachandra hi prathit hote the
 Rati used to look at him with great emotion and glee
 tab pradhyumna ji bole ki tumne mata jaisaa meraa laalan-paalan kiya he phir tumme aisa parivartan kyon dekh rahaa hoon? tab rati ne kaha - "saying so, Mayawati Rati gave her great knowledge and made her adept in all the disciplines like bow and arrow, weapons and weapons
 yuddh vidya main praveen ho jane par pradhyumna astr shastron se susajjit hokar shambrasur kii sabha main gayi
 Shambarasur was pleased to see them and told the councilors that i have raised this child by raising them
 is par pradhyumna bole ki are dusht! main tera balak nahin varan tera vahi shatru hoon jisko tuune samudr main daal diya tha
 Now you fight with me
 "pradhyumna ke in vachanon ko sunakar shambrasur ne ati krodhit hokar un par apane bajra ke samaan baari gade kaa shambrasur kiya
 Pradyuman cut that donkey from his donkey
 tab vah asur anek prakaar kii maaya rach kar yuddh karne laga kintu pradhyumna ne mahavidhya ke prayog se uski maaya ko nasht kar diya or apane tikshn talwaar se shambrasur kaa sir kaat kar prithvi par daal diya
 Seeing this power of his, the gods praised him and showered flowers from the sky
 phir mayawati rati pradhyumna ko akaash maarg se dwarikapuri le ai
 The beauty of Pradownam ji with Gauravarna's wife was indescribable
 " They arrived at the interpolation of the newly-married Shri Krishna
 rukmini sahit vahaan kii samast striyaan saakshaat shri krishna ke praturup pradhyumna ko dekhakar aashcharyachakit rah gayi
 They started wondering whose son is this male superior? Do not know why my enthusiasm is rising by seeing this
 meraa balak bhi bada hokar isi ke samaan hota kintu use to na jane koun prasutikagrih se hi uthaa kar le gaya tha
 At the same time Shri Krishna also reached there with his parents Devaki and Vasudev and brother Balarama
 shri krishna to antaryami the kintu unhen nar lila kerani thi isaliye ve balak ke vishay main anjaan bane rahe
 Then Devarshi Narada came there and told the story of Pradyumna to everyone and spread happiness in the hearts of all the people present there
 sukhsagar ke saujany se The realization of two conflicting or totally different styles of personality in the same unit, while securing their separate power, is dualism
 ek hi vyakti ke ghere main rahakar bhi ye apane main susambaddha evam vyavasthit hote hai; ek duusare ke prati tatasth evam vismrit rahete hai
 When one personality block remains active on the surface of consciousness, the memory of the other is no longer available, although there are exceptions in the case of memory
 apane hi bhinn svaroopbodhon kii asampruktata vyavhaar main prakat hokar logon ko achraj main daal detii he
 Her social relations are constantly interrupted and distorted due to outright anti-conduct
 dvivyaktitdharee, maansik chikitsa kaa ek naidanik vishay ban jaataa he
 These personality blocks are also more than two
 inke kai naam bhi chalate hai- bahuvyaktitv, khandit vyaktitv ; asamprukt vyaktitv, ekantarit tathaa sthanantarit vyaktitv aadi
 Parables of such personality changes are found in folklore and literature
 rabart lui sativenson ke prasiddh upanyaas 'dow jokil and mi

 In Chinese folklore a person falls asleep in the forest; As soon as sleeping, it becomes a lion and kills its own brother
 apane purv rup main aane par bina is baat ke gyaan ke ki yah uskaa hi krity he, bandhu kii mrityu par afsos karata he
 Conflicting circles or getting them in the same person is psychology, not even a new thing for general knowledge
 yung kaa 'antarmukh' evam 'bahirmukh' vyaktitv-prakaar tathaa bluelar kathith 'antarbahirmukh' vyakti kii vritti - 'dwaidhbhav', aadi prasiddh hi hai
 Even in psychiatry, in the formulation of the Kraschamar conscience 'sijaid' and 'cyclaid', the Kreplin alleged enthusiasm, sadness, psychosis and psychosis or psychosis etc
, confirms the same fact that the legislative attitude of the individual to associate the mind power with the external world
 And both the prohibitive instincts of pulling from the external world like a turtle and shrinking into the intestine, both work
