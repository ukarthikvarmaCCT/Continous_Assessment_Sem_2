 Banke Bihari Temple is located at Raman Reti in Vrindavan Dham in Mathura district, India
 yah bharat ke pracheen or prasiddh mandiron main se ek he
 Banke Bihari is a form of Krishna which is depicted in it
 iskaa nirmaan 1864 main swami haridas ne karavaaya tha
 Shridham Vrindavan, this is such a holy land, on which the land comes to destroy all sins
 aisa akhir koun vyakti hoga jo is pavitra bhoomi par aana nahin chahega tathaa shri bankebihari ji ke darshan kar apane ko krutharth karnaa nahin chahega
 This temple is situated in a beautiful area of sri Vrindavan Dham
 kaha jaataa he ki is mandir kaa nirmaan swami shri haridas ji ke vanshajo ke samuhik prayaas se samvath 1921 ke lagbhag kiya gaya
 At the beginning of the temple construction, no donor's money was put into it
 sriharidas swami vishay udasin vaishnav the
 Pleased with his bhajan-kirtan, Shri Bankebihariji appeared from Nidhivan
 swami haridas ji kaa janm samvath 1536 main bhadrapada mahine ke shukla paksh main ashtami ke din vrindavan ke nikat rajapur naamak gaanv main hua tha
 His worshiper was shyam-saloni Surat Bale Sribakebihari ji
 inke pita kaa naam gangadhar evam mata kaa naam shrimati chitra devi tha
 Haridas ji was a disciple of Swami Ashudhir Dev ji
 inhen dekhte hi aashudhir devji jaan gayi the ki ye sakhi lalitaji ke avatar hai tathaa radhashtami ke din bhakthi pradaayani shri radha ji ke mangal–mahotsav kaa darshan laabh hetu hi yahan padhaare he
 Haridasji is considered the incarnation of Rasnidhi Sakhi
 ye bachapan se hi sansar se oobe rahete the
 As a teenager, he took a couple's mantra initiation from Ashudhir ji and started meditating at a lonely place in Nikunj near Yamuna
 jab ye 25 varsh ke hue tab inhone apane guru ji se virakthavesh praapt kiya evam sansar se dur hokar nikunj bihari ji ke nity lilaon kaa chintan karne main rah gayi
 It was in Nikunj forest that Swami Haridasji had a dream to remove the statue of Bihariji
 tab unki aagyaanusaar manohar shyamvarn chhavi vaale shrivigrah ko dharaa ko god se baahar nikaala gaya
 This beautiful idol became famous in the world by the name of Sribakebihari ji
 This idol was removed on the fifth date of Margashirsha, Shukla
 atah prakatya tithi ko ham vihaar panchami ke rup main bade hi ullas ke saath maanate he
 Due to the combined image or integrated image of the couple Kishore Sarkar's idol Radha Krishna, there is a feeling of supernatural light between the image of Banke Bihari ji, which is the symbol of Radha element in Banke Bihari ji
 swami haridas Shri Bankebihari Ji had been serving by Swamiji for a long time in Nidhivan itself
 phir jab mandir kaa nirmaan kaary sampann ho gaya, tab unako vahaan laakar sthapit kar diya gaya
 The Sanadhaya dynasty should be able to maintain the enjoyment and other service arrangements of Shri Krishna Yati Ji, Bihari Ji
 phir inhone samvath 1975 main hargulal seth ji ko shribihari ji kii seva vyavastha sambhaalane hetu niyukt kiya
 Then this Seth established Sribakebihari Trusts at places like Verry, Kolkata, Rohtak, etc
 iske alaava anya bhakton kaa sahyog bhi isamen kaaphi sahaayta pradaan kar rahaa he
 It is a matter of joy when many Deities were transferred due to the fear of the rise of Kala Pahad
 parantu shribankevihari ji yahaan se sthaanantarit nahin hue
 Even today, he is being worshiped here with love
 kaalaantar main swami haridas ji ke upasna paddati main parivartan laakar ek naye sampradaay, nimbark sampradaay se swatantra hokar sakhibhaav sampradaay bana
 According to this method, service and festivals etc
 are celebrated in all the temples of Vrindavan
 shribankebihari ji mandir main keval sharad poornima ke din shri shribankebihari ji vanshidharan karte hai
 Only on the day of Shravan Teej, Thakur ji sits on the swing and only on the day of Janmashtami is his Mangala-aarti
 jiske darshan saubhagyashaalee vyakti ko hi praapt hote hai
 And Charan Darshan occurs only on the day of Akshaya Tritiya
 in charan-kamalon kaa jo darshan karata he uskaa to bedaa hi paar lag jaataa he
 Swami Haridas ji was a famous singer of music and a mentor of Tansen
 ek din praatavkaal swami ji dekhne lage ki unke bistar par koi razaai odhakar so rahaa hai
 Seeing this, Swamiji said - who are sleeping on my bed? vahaan shribihari ji swayan so rahe the
 On hearing the word, Bihari ran out
 kintu ve apane chuda evam vanshi, ko vistar par rakhkar chale gayi
 Swami ji, due to chronic vision in old age, he could not see anything
 iske pashchaat shri bankebihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir ke kapaat khole to unhen shri bankevihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir main kapat khole to unhen shribankebihari ji ke palane main chuda evam vanshi najar nahin aayi
 But the door of the temple was closed
 aashcharyachakit hokar pujari ji nidhivan main swami ji ke paas aaye evam swami ji ko sabhi baaten bataayi
 Swamiji said that someone had slept on my side in the morning
 wo jate vakt kuch chhod gaya hai
 Then the priest directly saw that Sibankebihari ji's wounds are lying on the wall
 isse pramanit hota he ki shribankebihari ji raat ko raas karne ke liye nidhivan jate hai
 For this reason, there is no mangla-aarti in the morning
 kaaran–raatri main raas karke yahaan bihari ji aate he
 Therefore, it is a crime to interrupt their sleep in the morning
 swami haridas ji ke darshan praapt karne ke liye anekon samraat yahan aate the
 Once Emperor Akbar of Delhi came here to see Swamiji
 thakur ji ke darshan praatah 9 baje se dopaher 12 baje tak evam saayam 6 baje se raatri 9 baje tak hote hai
 Changes in time are made according to the special date
 shribankebihari ji ke darshan sambandh main anekon kahaniyaan prachlit hai
 One and two of which are the following - Once a devotee persuaded her husband to go to Vrindavan after much persuasion
 donon vrindavan aakar shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 After seeing Sribihari ji for a few days, when her husband tried to return to Swagriha, she started crying thinking that Sribihari ji would be deprived of the benefit of Darshan
 sansar bandhan ke liye swagrih jaayenge, isliye wo shribihari ji ke nikat rote–rote prarthana karne lagi ki– 'he prabhu main ghar ja rahi hun, kintu tum chirkaal mere hi paas nivas karnaa, aisa prarthana karne ke pashchaat ve donon railway stesan kii ore ghodagadee main baithkar chal diye
 At that time Sribankevihari ji, assuming the appearance of a cow boy, came behind the horse cart and started praying with devotion to take him along
 idhar pujari ne mandir main thakur ji ko na dekhakar unhone bhaktimati ke premayukt ghatana ko jaan liya evam tatkaal ve ghoda gaadi ke peeche daude
 The child in the car started praying to Sribakebihari ji
 donon main aisa vaartalap chalate samay wo balak unke madhya se gaayab ho gaya
 Then the priest returned to the temple and started seeing Sribakebihari Ji again
 idhar bhakt tathaa bhaktimati shribankebihari ji kii swayan krupa jaanakar donon ne sansar kaa gaman tyaag kar shribankebihari ji ke charnon main apane jivan ko samarpit kar diya
 For many such reasons, there are Jhalak Darshans of Shree Bankebihari ji
 shribihari ji mandir ke saamne ke daravaaje par ek pardaa laga rahata he or wo pardaa ek do minute ke antaraal par band evam kholaa jaataa hai or bhi kinvadanti hai
 Once a devotee kept watching that Sribakebihari ji ran away due to his devotion
 pujari ji ne jab mandir kii kapaat kholaa to unhen shribankebihari ji nahin dikhaai diye
 It is learned that he has gone to Aligarh to give testimony of one of his devotees
 tabhi se aisa niyam bana diya ki jhalak darshan main thakur ji kaa pardaa khulata evam band hota rahegaa
 Many similar stories are popular
 swami haridasji ke dwaara nidhivan sthit vishakha kund se shribankebihari ji prakatit hue the
 In this temple, Sriradhika Deity was not established with Krishna
 baishakh maas kii akshay tritiya ke din shribankebihari ke shricharanon kaa darshan hota he
 Earlier he was sitting in Nidhivan itself
 baad main vartmaan mandir main padhaare hai
 Sribakebihari ji remained secretly in Vrindavan at the time of disturbance of the Yavanas, did not go out
 shribankebihari ji kaa jhaanki darshan vishesh rup main hota he
 The reason for the tableau philosophy here is his devotion and rapture
 ek samay unke darshan ke liye ek bhakt mahanubhav upasthit hue
 He kept staring at them for a long time

 Although some also consider it as the Soro Sukkshetra
 rajapur uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot jila ke antargat sthit ek gaanv he
 There lived an eminent Sarauparin Brahmin named Atmaram Dubey
 unki dharmapatni kaa naam hulsi tha
 Tulsidas was born here in the same nakshatra moola nakshatra on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Shravan month of Samvat 1511
 prachlit janashruti ke anusaar shishu baarah maheene tak maan ke garbh main rahane ke kaaran atyadhik hrisht pusht tha or uske mukh main daant dikhaayi de rahe the
 As soon as he was born, he pronounced the name Rama, which gave him the name Rambola
 unke janm ke duusare hi din maan kaa nidhan ho gaya
 The father handed over the child to a maid named Chuniya to avoid any further evils and disabused himself
 jab rambola saade paanch varsh kaa hua to chuniyaan bhi nahin rahi
 He was forced to live like an orphan wandering the streets
 bhagwaan shankaraji kii prerana se ramshail par rahanevaale shri anantanand ji ke priy shishy srinaraharyanand ji ne is rambola ke naam se bahucharchit ho chuke is balak ko dhund nikaala or vidhivat uskaa naam tulsiram rakhaa
 Thereafter, he took him to Ayodhya and performed his yagyopavit-sanskar there in 1561 Magh Shukla Panchami
 sanskaar ke samay bhi bina sikhaaye hi balak rambola ne gayatri-mantra kaa spashth uccharan kiya, jise dekhakar sab log chakit ho gayi
 After this, Narhari Baba, after performing the five rites of Vaishnavas, gave the child the initiation of Ram-mantra and made him study while staying in Ayodhya
 balak rambola kii buddhi badi prakhar thi
 What he would hear from Guru-mukha in one go, he would become memorized
 vahaan se kuch kaal ke baad guru-shishy donon shukarakshetra pahunche
 There Narhari Baba narrated the story of Rama to the child but he did not understand it well
 jyeshtha shukla trayodashi, guuruuvaar, sanwat 1583 ko 29 varsh kii aayu main rajapur se thodi hi dur yamuna ke us paar sthit ek gaanv kii ati sundari bharadwaj gotra kii kanya ratnavali ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Since Gauna was not done, he went to Kashi for some time and stayed there with Seshasanatan ji and started studying ved-vedang
 vahaan rahete hue achaanak ek din unhen apni patni kii yaad aayi or ve vyakul hone lage
 When he was no more, he returned to his birthplace Rajapur with permission from Guruji
 patni ratnavali chunki maayke main hi thi kyonki tab tak unka gauna nahin hua tha at: tulsiram ne bhayankar andheri raat main ufanti yamuna nadi tairkar paar kii or sidhe apni patni ke shayan-kaksh main ja pahunche
 Ratnavali was surprised to see her husband alone that night
 usne lok-lajja ke bhay se jab unhen chupchaap waapas jane ko kaha to ve usase usee samay ghar chalane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Fearing his unexpected stubbornness, Ratnavali taught him through a couplet composed by Tulsiram, which made him Tulsidas
 ratnavali ne jo doha kaha tha vah is prakaar he: Hearing this couplet, he left his wife's house there at the same time and returned back to his village Rajapur
 rajapur main apane ghar jaakar jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unki anupasthiti main unke pita bhi nahin rahe or puraa ghar nasht ho chukaa he to unhen or bhi adhik ksht hua
 He paid obeisance to his father lawfully and started living in the village and narrating the story of Lord Rama to the people
 kuch kaal rajapur rahane ke baad ve pun: kaashi chale gayi or vahaan kii janata ko ram-katha sunaane lage
 During the story, he found a phantom in the guise of a man, who told him the address of Hanumanji
 hanuman ji se milakar tulsidas ne unase raghunathji kaa darshan karaane kii prarthana kii
 Hanumanji said- "you will see Raghunathji in Chitrakoot
 " is par tulsidas ji chitrakoot kii ore chal pade
 After reaching Chitrakoot, he set his posture at Ramghat
 ek din ve pradakshina karne nikle hi the ki yakaayak maarg main unhen shriram ke darshan hue
 He saw that two very handsome princes were riding on horses and carrying bows and arrows
 tulsidas unhen dekhakar aakarshith to hue, parantu unhen pahchaan na sake
 Then when Hanumanji came from behind and told him the whole secret, he started to repent
 is par hanumanji ne unhen satvana di or kaha praatavkaal phir darshan honge
 Lord Shri Ram reappeared in front of them on Wednesday on the Mauni Amavasya of Samvat 1607
 unhone balak rup main aakar tulsidas se kaha-"baba! hamen chandan chaiye kya aap hamen chandan de sakate hai?" hanuman ji ne sochaa, kahin ve is baar bhi dhokhaa na kha jaayen, isaliye unhone tote kaa rup dhaaran karke yah doha kaha: Seeing that wonderful image of Tulsidas Shri Ram, he forgot his own mind and mind
 antatogatva bhagwaan ne swayan apane haath se chandan lekar apane tathaa tulsidas ji ke mastak par lagaaya or antardhyaan ho gayi
 In Samvat 1628, he took Hanuman's orders and proceeded towards Ayodhya
 un dinon prayag main magh mela laga hua tha
 They stayed there for a few days
 parv ke chah din baad ek vatvriksh ke neeche unhen bharadwaj or yajyavlky muni ke darshan hue
 There had been the same story, which he had heard from his master in Sukrkshetr
 magh mela samaapt hote hi tulsidas ji prayag se pun: waapas kaashi aa gayi or vahaan ke prahladghaat par ek brahman ke ghar nivas kiya
 While living there, poetry-power emerged in him and he started writing poetry in Sanskrit
 parantu din main ve jitne padya rachate, raatri main ve sab lupt ho jate
 This incident happens every day
 aathven din tulsidas ji ko swapn hua
 Lord Shankar ordered them to compose poetry in their own language
 tulsidas ji kii neend uchat gayi
 He got up and sat down
 usee samay bhagwaan shiv or parvati unke saamne prakat hue
 Tulsidas ji prostrated him
 is par prasann hokar shiv ji ne kaha- "tum ayodhya main jaakar raho or hindi main kavy-rachana karo
 With my blessings, your poem will flourish like Samveda
 " itnaa kahkar gaurishankar antardhan ho gayi
 Tulsidas ji, following his orders, went straight from Kashi to Ayodhya
 sanwat 1631 kaa prarambh hua
 In that year yoga came on the day of Ram Navami in the same way as it was on the day of Rama's birth in Tretayuga
 us din praatavkaal tulsidas ji ne shriramcharitamanas kii rachana prarambh kii
 This wonderful book was completed in two years, seven months and twenty six days
 sanwat 1633 ke margshirsh shuklapaksh main ram-vivaah ke din saaton kand purna ho gayi
 After this, Tulsidas came to Kashi by the command of God
 vahaan unhone bhagavan vishwanath or mata annapurna ko shriramcharitamanas sunaaya
 At night the book was kept in the vishwanath-mandir
 praat:kaal jab mandir ke pat khole gayi to pustak par likhaa hua paaya gaya-satyam shivan sundaram jiske neeche bhagavan shankar kii sahi thi
 At that time, the people present there also heard the voice of "satya Shivam Sundaram" with their ears
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ko jab yah baat pataa chali to unke man main irshyaa utpann hui
 They started making a team and condemned Tulsidas ji and tried to destroy that book
 unhone pustak churaane ke liye do chor bhi bheje
 The thieves went and saw that two youths were guarding the bow with a bow around the Tulsidas ji's hut
 donon yuvak bade hi sundar kramash: shyaam or gaur varna ke the
 As soon as they saw him, the thieves' intelligence became pure
 unhone usee samay se chori karnaa chhod diya or bhagwaan ke bhajan main lag gayi
 Tulsidas ji looted all the things of his life and suffering for God, and kept the book with his friend Todarmal
 iske baad unhone apni vilakshan samaran shakti se ek duusari prati likhi
 On the basis of this, other copies were prepared and the promotion of the book started increasing day by day
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ne or koi upaay na dekh shri madhusudan saraswati naam ke mahapandit ko us pustak ko dekhakar apni sammati dene kii prarthana kii
 Madhusudan Saraswati ji was very happy to see him and wrote his comment on it - iskaa hindi main arth is prakaar he-"kaashi ke anand-van main tulsidas saakshaat chalata-phirata tulsi kaa paudha he
 His poetry is very beautiful, on which the temple of Shriram always hovers
 " The Pandits were also not satisfied with his comment
 tab pustak kii pariksha kaa ek anya upaay sochaa gaya
 In the Vishwanath-temple of Kashi, the Vedas were placed at the top in front of Lord Vishwanath, the scriptures under them, the Puranas under the scriptures and the Ramcharitmanas under them
 praatavkaal jab mandir kholaa gaya to logon ne dekha ki shriramcharitamanas vedon ke upar rakhaa hua he
 Now all the priests were very ashamed
 unhone tulsidas ji se kshamaa maangi or bhakthi-bhav se unka charanodak liya
 When Tulsidas ji started living on the famous ghat Aseighat of Kashi, one night Kali Yuga came to him in physical form and started tormenting him
 tulsidas ji ne usee samay hanuman ji kaa dhyaan kiya
 Hanuman ji appeared visually and asked him to create a prayer post, after which he wrote his last work Vinaya Patrika and dedicated it to the feet of God
 shriram ji ne us par swayan apane hastakshar kar diye or tulsidas ji ko nirbhay kar diya
 Shravana Krishna Tritiya on Saturday in 1680, Tulsidas ji gave up his body, saying "ram-ram"
 tulsidas ji kii hastlipi atyadhik sundar thi lagata he jaise us yug main unhone calography kii kala aati thi
 a copy of the Ayodhyakanda of Sriramcharitmanas is preserved in a temple of his birthplace, Rajapur
 usee prati ke saath rakhe hue ek kavi madanlaal verma 'krant' kii hastlipi main tulsi ke vyaktitv va krititv ko rekhaankit karte hue nimnlikhit do chand bhi ullekhneey hai jinhen hindi academy dilli kii patrika indraprastha bharti ne sarvapratham prakashit kiya tha
 The first verse in these is the overview, which is the feature that each step begins with the word that ends with it
 pratham va antim shabd bhi ek hi rahata he
 It has been called a wonderful verse in poetry
 yahi chand ek anya patrika sahityaparikrama ke tulsi jainti visheshank main bhi prakashit hue the vahiin se uddhrut kiye gayi hai In his long life span of 126 years, Tulsidas composed the following classics in chronological order - inamen se ramcharitamanas, vinay-patrika, kavitawali, gitavali jaisi kritiyon ke vishay main kisi kavi kii yah arshvani sateek prathit hoti he - pashy devsy kavyan, na mrinoti na jiryati
 That is, see the poetry of devpurus, which does not die or become old
 lagbhag chaar sau varsh purv tulsidas ji ne apni kritiyon kii rachana kii thi
 Even in that period devoid of modern publishing facilities, Tulsidas's poetry had reached the masses
 yah unke kavi rup main lokapriy hone kaa pratyaksh pramaan he
 By reading a large book like Manas, the normal educated people were also becoming famous for their purity and knowledge
 ramcharitamanas tulsidas ji kaa sarvaadhik lokapriy granth rahaa he
 He has not mentioned anything in relation to his works, hence there is a lack of in-depth evidence regarding authentic works
 nagari prachaarini sabha kaashi dwaara prakashit granth is prakaar hai : Grierson also mentions the first twelve texts above in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics
 yah sanskaar geet he
 Certain references in this song are different from the story of ram-vivah
 vairaygy sandipani ko mataprasad gupt ne apramanik mana he, par acharya chandravali pandey ise pramanik or tulsi kii aarambhik rachana maanate hai
 Solid evidence can be found by the availability of some more ancient copies
 sant mahima varnan kaa pehla soratha pesh he - Scholars have declared it a creation of Tulsi
 style kii drushti se yah tulsidas kii pramanik rachana he
 Only a fragmented copy of it is edited in the bibliography
 yah tulsi kii pramanik rachana prathit hoti he
 Its poetic maturity is compatible with the Tulsi theory
 kavita saral, subodh rochak or saras he
 "" Jagat Matu Pitu Sambhu Bhavani "" is not even a little bit of the aesthetic efforts
 lok reeti itani yathasthiti se chitrit hui he ki yah sanskrit ke shiv kavy se kam prabhavit he or tulsi kii mati kii bhaktyaatmak bhoomika par virachit katha kavy he
 The poet has carefully noted the solidity of behaviors, the exclusivity of love, and the plausibility of the matrimonial program
 tulsidas apni is rachana se atyant santusht the, isiilie is anasakt bhakt ne keval ek baar apni mati kii saraahna kii he - Scholars have placed it in the authentic compositions of Tulsidas
 par isamen bhi kshepak he
 Before the Tulsi Manas, the story of Valmiki Ramayana was popular
 kaashi ke panditon se maanas ko lekar tulsidas kaa matbhed or maanas kii prati par vishwanath kaa hastakshar sambandhi janashruti prasiddh he

 jab yah samachar bhartiya media tak pahunchaa to vah pratidin ise sirmaur banaakar pesh karne laga
 The opposition also used this 'breaking news'
 usne janata tak yah sandesh pahunchaaya ki 60 karod kii dallali main rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar jaanch se bhaag rahi thi
 Indian Court was also given a clean chit by Rajiv Gandhi

 It became clear to the Indian public that if the Bofars guns were not Vishwanisyan, the deal would have been brokered
 aise main nishaanaa rajeev gandhi or unki sarkaar ko hi bananaa tha
 Here, VP Singh made up his mind to play the role of Vibhishan when he was expelled by the Congress in 1987

 Now it is needless to say here that the purpose of VP Singh's propaganda towards Rajiv Gandhi was to reach power
 is chunaav main sachai or eemaandaaree kii bali chadhaai gai tathaa jhooth ne logon ko gumraah kar diya
 This is also the psychology that if a lie repeatedly falls in your ears, then one day you believe it to be true
 yahi baat boforce saude ke maamle main bhi hui
 The Indian public accepted this as true

 Ashtavakra is the sage of Ashtavakra Gita, the important text of Advaita Vedanta
 ashtavakra gita advait veydant kaa mahatvapurn granth he
 Ashtavakra means 'twisted from eight places'
 kehete hai ki ashtavakra kaa sharir aath sthanon se tedha tha
 The name of the son of the sage Uddālaka was तvetaketu
 uddalak rishi ke ek shishy kaa naam kahod tha
 After giving the knowledge of the entire Vedas to Kahod, Uddālaka sage married Sujātā, his beautiful and quality girl with him
 kuch dinon ke baad sujatha garbhvatee ho gai
 One day when he was doing Vedas, the child said from inside the womb that father! You are misreading Veda
 yah sunate hi kahod krodhit hokar bole ki tu garbh se hi meraa apmaan kar rahaa he isaliye tu aath sthanon se vakr ho jaayegaa
 After a day Kahod reached the court of King Janak
 vahaan bandi se shastrarth main unki haar ho gai
 As a result of defeat, they were immersed in water
 is ghatana ke baad ashtavakra kaa janm hua
 Due to the absence of a father, he considered his grandfather Uddālaka as his father and his maternal uncle तvetaketu as his brother
 ek din jab vah uddalak kii god main baitha tha to shwethaketu ne use apane pita kii god se khinchate huye kaha ki hat ja tu yahan se, yah tere pita kaa god nahin he
 Ashtavakra did not like this and immediately came to his mother and inquired about her father
 mata ne ashtavakra ko sari baaten sach-sach bataa deen
 After listening to his mother's words, Ashtavakra, along with his maternal uncle Shvetaketu, reached the yagyashala of King Janak to discuss the sentence
 vahaan dwarapalon ne unhen rokte huye kaha ki yajyashala main bacchon ko jane kii ajna nahin he
 On this Ashtavakra said that hey! a person does not become a big person only because the hair turns white or gets more
 jise vedon kaa gyaan ho or jo buddhi main tej ho vahi vastav main bada hota he
 Having said this, he went to the meeting of King Janak and challenged the captive for debate
 raja janak ne ashtavakra kii pariksha lene ke liye poocha ki vah purush koun he jo tees avyav, baarah ansh, choubees parv or teen sau saath aksharon vaali vastu kaa gyani he? raja janak ke prashn ko sunate hi ashtavakra bole ki rajan! choubees pakshon vaala, chah rituon vaala, baarah maheenon vaala tathaa teen sau saath dinon vaala sanvatsar aapaki raksha kare
 Hearing the correct answer of Ashtavakra, King Janak again asked that who is he who does not keep his eyes closed even in dormancy? Who is unable to walk even after taking birth? Who is heartless? And who is going to grow fast? Ashtavakra replied, o father! Fish do not keep their eyes closed while sleeping
 janm lene ke uparant bhi anda chal nahin saktaa
 The stone is heartless and is a fast growing river
 ashtavakra ke uttaron ko sukar raja janak prasann ho gayi or unhen bandi ke saath shastrarth kii anumati pradaan kar di
 The captive told Ashtavakra that one sun illuminates the whole world, Devraj Indra is the same hero and Yamraj is also one
 ashtavakra bole ki indra or agnidev do devtaa hai
 Narada and Parvat are two devarshi, Ashwanyakumar is also two
 rath ke do pahiye hote hai or pati-patni do sahchar hote hai
 Bandi said that the world bears birth in three ways
 karmon kaa pratipaadan teen veda karte hai
 There is a Yajna in all three periods and there are three worlds and three lights
 ashtavakra bole ki ashram chaar hai, varna chaar hai, dishaayein chaar hai or onkaar, aakaar, ukaar tathaa makaar ye vaani ke prakaar bhi chaar hai
 Bandi said that there are five types of Yajna, five types of fire of Yajna, five are Gyanendrias, five are the Apsaras in the five directions, five are the holy rivers and five verses in the line verses
 ashtavakra bole ki dakshina main chah gauen dena uttam he, rituen chah hoti hai, man sahit indrayaan chah hai, kritikas chah hoti hai or sadhsk bhi chah hi hote hai
 The prisoner said that domestic animals are seven good and wild animals are also seven, seven are good verses, seven are seven and the strings are only seven in Veena
 ashtavakra bole ki aath vasu hai tathaa yajna ke stambhak kone bhi aath hote hai
 Bandi said that in Pitru Yajna, samidha is left nine, nature is of nine types and in the great verses there are only nine letters
 ashtavakra bole ki dishaaen das hai, tatvajna das hote hai, baccha das maah main hota he or dahaai main bhi das hi hota he
 The captive said that there are eleven Rudras, there are eleven pillars in the Yajna and eleven senses of animals
 ashtavakra bole ki baarah aditya hote hai baarah din kaa prakruti yajna hota he, jagati chand main baarah akshar hote hai or varsh bhi baarah maas kaa hi hota he
 The captive said that Trayodashi is good, there are thirteen islands on earth
 xxrep 6 
 itnaa kehete kehete bandi shloke kii agali pankti bhul gayi or chup ho gayi
 On this, Ashtavakra completed the verse and said that the thirteen-letter verses in the Vedas are called extreme verses and that fire, air and sun prevail in all the thirteen-day yagna
 is prakaar shastrarth main bandi kii haar ho jane par ashtavakra ne kaha ki rajan! yah haar gaya he, atev ise bhi jal main dubo diya jaye
 Then the captives said that, o Maharaj! i am the son of Varuna and i have sent all the lost Brahmins to my father
 main abhi un sabko aapke samaksh upasthit karata hoon
 As soon as the captive had said so, after losing the captive to the scriptures, the sars immersed in water came to the meeting of the Brahmin Janak, which included Ashtavakra's father Kahod
 ashtavakra ne apane pita ke charansparsh kiye
 Then Kahod was pleased and said that son! You go and bathe in the Samanga River, because of that you will be freed from my curse
 tab ashtavakra ne is sthaan main aakar samanga nadi main snaan kiya or uske saare vakr ang sidhe ho gayi
 Narayan Guru was a great saint and social reformer of India
 kanyakumari jile main marutvan pahaado kii ek gupha main unhone tapasya kii thi
 Gautama Buddha attained Bodhi under the Peepal tree in Gaya

 narayan guru kaa janm dakshin kerala ke ek saadhaaran parivaar main 26 agast 1854 main hua tha

 unhen nahin pataa tha ki unka betaa ek din alag tarah ke mandiron ko banavaayega
 Will play a role in changing the society
 us param tatv ko paane ke baad narayan guru aruvippuram aa gayi the
 At that time there was a dense forest
 vah kuch dinon vahiin jangal main ekantavaas main rahe
 One day a shepherd saw him
 useene baad main logon ko narayan guru ke bare main bataaya
 His name was Parameswaran Pillai
 vahi unka pehla shishy bhi bana
 Gradually Narayana started becoming famous as Guru Siddha Purush
 log unase aashirvadke liye aane lage
 Then Guruji got the idea to build a temple
 narayan guru ek aisa mandir bananaa chaahate the, jisamen kisi kism kaa koi bhedbhaav na ho
 Neither religion nor caste nor man and woman
 dakshin kerala main naiyar nadi ke kinare ek jagah he aruvippuram
 It is a special shrine in Kerala
 narayan guru ne yahaan ek mandir banaaya tha
 At a glance, it looks similar to temples and temples
 lekin ek samay main us mandir ne itihaas rachaa tha
 The temple of Aruvippuram is perhaps the first temple in this country, where anyone could worship without any caste discrimination
 us samay jati ke bandhanon main jakade samaaj main hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya tha
 The Brahmins there described him as a great sin
 tab narayan guru ne kaha tha - ishwar na to pujari he or na hi kisaan
 He is in everyone
 darasal vah ek aise dharm kii khoj main the, jahaan aam se aam aadmi bhi judaav mahasoos kar sake
 He wanted to see people from low castes and castes live with pride
 us samay kerala main log dheron devi-devataaon kii puja karte the
 The lowly and the caste people had their own primitive gods
 oonchi jati ke laag unhen nafrat se dekhte the
 He discouraged people to worship such deities
 uski jagah narayan guru ne kaha ki sabhi manushyon ke liye ek hi jati, ek dharm or ek ishwar hona chahie
 At the same time, Mahatma Gandhi was trying to eradicate untouchability at another level in society
 vah ek baar narayan guru se mili bhi the
 Guruji praised him for his service to the common people
 narayan guru murtipuja ke virdohi the
 But he wanted to build a temple where there is no idol
 vah raja rammohan raay kii tarah murtipuja kaa virodh nahin kar rahe the
 He was trying to connect his God with the common man
 aam aadmi ko ek bina bhedbhaav kaa ishwar dena chaahate the

 koran, quran yaa koran islam kii pavithratam kitaab he or isaki neenv he
 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai

 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man

 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts

 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai

 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha

 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations

 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632

 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha

 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death

 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran

 islamic or kuranik sandarbhon main prakashitvaakya kaa matlab he ki ishwar kaa kaary kisi vyakti ko sambodhit karnaa, praptakartaaon kii ek badi sankhya ke liye sandesh bhejnaa

 " quran aksar apane paath main jor detaa he ki ise ishwariya rup se niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Some verses in the Quran indicate that even Arabic-speaking people will understand the Quran if they are recited
 quran ek likhit purv-paath, "sangrakshit tablet" ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ise bhejne se pehle bhi bhagwaan ke bhaashan ko record karata he
 The issue that the Quran is eternal or created became a religious debate in the ninth century

 Sufi philosophers frame this question as artificial or incorrect
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa vartmaan shabd mohammad ko pataa chalaa he, or quran 15: 9 kii unki vyakhya ke anusaar, yah bhrashtachar se sangrakshit he 
 Muslims consider the Quran a guide, a sign of Muhammad's prophecy and the truth of religion
 quran kaa anokhaapan yah vishwaas he ki quran se kisi maanviya boli yaa koi saamagree se tulana nahin ho sakati
 The Quran is considered by Muslims to be an incomparable miracle, effective until the day of Yaum al-qiyama, and thus, providing central evidence to Muhammad in the certification of his prophetic status
 quran main aprihaaryta kii avadharana utpann hoti he, jahaan paanch alag-alag chhandon main virodhiyon ko quran kii tarah kuch utpann karne ke liye chunauti di jaati he: "yadi maanav or jinn is quran kii tarah vaani paidaa karne ke liye ek saath bandha bhi jaaen to ve kabhi bhi aisa nahin kar paayenge, yadi vah aapas main kitna bhi samarthan karke dekh len
 "so the suggestion is that if there are doubts related to the divine authorship of the Quran, then come forward and create something like that
