 The story narrated by the ninth pupil Madhumalati reflects Vikramaditya's spirit of sacrificing his life
 katha is prakaar he- ek baar raja vikramaditya ne rajya or praja kii sukh-samruddhi ke liye ek vishaal yajna kaa aayojan kiya
 The yagna continued for several days
 ek din raja mantra-paath kar rahe, tabhi ek rishi vahaan padhaare
 The king saw them, but it was impossible to leave the sacrificial fire
 unhone man hi man rishi kaa abhivadan kiya tathaa unhen pranaam kiya
 The sage also considered the intent of the state and blessed him
 jab raja yajna se uthe, to unhone rishi se aane kaa prayojan poocha
 The king knew that the sage runs a gurukula in the forest, some distance outside the city, where the children go to study
 rishi ne jawaab diya ki yajna ke punit avasar par ve raja ko koi asuvidha nahin dete, agar aath se baarah saal tak ke chha: bacchon ke jivan kaa prashn nahin hota
 The king asked him to explain everything in detail
 is par rishi ne bataaya ki kuch bachche ashram ke liye sukhi lakadiyaan binane van main idhar-udhar gum rahe the
 Just then two demons came and captured them and took them to the high hill
 rishi ko jab ve upasthit nahin mili to unki talash main ve van main bechaini se bhatakane lage
 Then a roaring sound was heard from the top of the hill, which was definitely one of them
 rakshas ne kaha ki un bacchon kii jaan ke badale unhen ek purush kii aavashyaktaa he jisaki ve maan kaali ke saamne bali denge
 When the sage wanted to surrender himself to him for sacrifice, he disagreed
 unhone kaha ki rishi boode hai or kaali maan aise kamazor buudhe kii bali se prasann nahin hogi
 a very healthy Kshatriya is needed for the sacrifice of the black mother
 rakshason ne kaha he ki agar koi chal yaa bal se un bacchon ko swatantra karaane kii cheshtaa karegaa, to un bacchon ko pahari se ludhaka kar maar diya jayega
 Sage's trouble was not being seen by King Vikramaditya
 ve turant taiyaar hue or rishi se bole- "aap mujhe us pahari tak le chale
 i will present myself for sacrifice in front of Kali
 main swasth hoon or kshatriya bhi
 The demons would have no objection
 " rishi ne suna to hatprabh rah gaae
 He wanted to celebrate a million, but Vikram did not change his decision
 unhone kaha agar raja ke jivit rahete uske rajya kii praja par koi vipatti aati he to raja ko apane praan dekar bhi us vipatti ko dur karnaa chahie
 The king reached the hill with the sage
 pahari ke neeche unhone apana ghoda chhod diya tathaa paidal hi pahaad par chadhane lage
 The hill path was very difficult, but they did not care for the difficulty
 ve chalate-chalate pahaada kii chotii par pahunche
 As soon as they reached him, a demon said that he recognized them and started to ask whether they knew the condition of the release of the children
 unhone kaha ki ve sab kuch jaanane ke baad hi yahan aae hai tatha unhone rakshason se bacchon ko chhod dene ko kaha
 a demon took the children in his arms and brought them down safely
 doosraa rakshas unhen lekar us jagah aayaa jahaan maan kaali kii pratimaa thi or balivedi bani hui thi vikramaditya ne balivedi par apana sar bali ke hetu jhukaa diya
 They did not get distracted at all
 unhone man hi man antim baar samaj kar bhagwaan kaa samaran kiya or vah rakshas khadg lekar unka sar dhar se alag karne ko taiyaar hua
 Suddenly that demon flattened Khadg and hugged Vikram
 vah jagah ekaek adbhut roshni tathaa khushboo se bhar gaya
 Vikram saw that Indra and the gods of wind were standing in place of both demons
 un donon ne unki pariksha lene ke liye yah sab kiya tha ve dekhnaa chaahate the ki vikram sirf sansaarik chizon kaa daan hi kar saktaa he yaa pranotsarg karne kii bhi kshamta rakhata he
 He told the king that upon seeing him perform the yajna, the feeling of this test was born in his mind
 unhone vikram ko yashasvi hone kaa aashirwad diya tathaa kaha ki unki kirkitt chaaron ore failegi

 The specific nature of the consonant produced depends mainly on three things - pronunciation space, pronunciation method and phonation
 mukh guha main 'achal uccharak' mukhyatah mukhaguha kii chat kaa koi bhaag hota he jabaki 'chal uccharak' mukhyatah jihva, neeche vaala oth, tathaa shwasadwar hai
 a consonant is a sound in which the air does not move at an uninterrupted speed, moving either through a complete block from any part of the mouth, or by friction with a narrow passage or emanating from the side

 vyanjanon ke utpann hone ke sthaan se sambandhit vyanjan ko aasaani se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 From this point of view, the classification of Hindi dishes is as follows- uccharan kii prakriya yaa praytn ke parinaam-swaroop utpann vyanjanon kaa vargeekaran is prakaar he- Touch: The sounds that are pronounced when the components are touched and opened suddenly are called touch
 k, kha, ga, gha, t, tha, da, dha, t, tha, da, dha, pa, pha, ba, bha or qa- sabhi dhvaniyaan sparsh hai
 Ch, Ch, H, j were formerly called 'touch-struggling' but now keeping in mind the simplicity and brevity, they are also placed in the category of tactile consonants
 inke uccharan main uccharan avyav sahasaa khulne ke bajaae dhire-dhire khulte hai
 Oral and nasal sounds: The second category of consonants include oral and nasal sounds
 hindi main ng, na, na, na, m vyanjan nasiky hai
 In their pronunciation, the breath exits through the nose, leading to nasalization of the sound
 inhen 'panchamakshar' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Use of Anusvara in place of them is considered convenient
 in vyanjanon ko chhodkar baaki sabhi vyanjan maukhik hai
 Lateral: In the pronunciation of these consonants, the breathing air originates from both sides of the tongue
 'l' aisi hi dhwani he
 Ardha Vowel: In the pronunciation of these sounds, there is no complete touch anywhere in the pronunciation components and the breath is blocked
 hindi main ya, va ardhaswar hai
 Lundit: In the pronunciation of these consonants, the tongue rises towards the varsity part
 hindi main 'r' vyanjan isi tarah kii dhwani he
 Concealed: The consonant sounds in which the tongue tip comes down with a hard palate colliding with a strong palate, is called utterance
 d or dh aise hi vyanjan hai
 The position of the phonemes is also considered important in the classification of consonants
 is drushti se vyanjanon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - ghosh or aghosh
 The consonants that have vibrations in the vocal cords are called Ghosh or Saghosh
 duusare prakaar kii dhvaniyaan aghosh kehalaati hai
 The phonetic position of the vocalists means that there is no vibration in the pronunciation, it is called a consonant consonant
 pranata ke adhar par bhi vyanjanon kaa vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 Prana means breathing air

 yah purush pradhan nrity he
 Usually this dance is performed on Baisakhi festival
 sutauli, someshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Public literature means the literature that the folk creates
 lok-sahitya utana hi pracheen he jitna ki maanav, isliye usamen jan-jivan kii prayek avasthaa, prayek varg, prayek samay or prakruti sabhi kuch samahit he
 According to Dr
 Satyendra- "lok Man is that class of society which is void of the consciousness or arrogance of the classical culture and erudition and which survives in the flow of a tradition
 " Literature related to the general public should be called folk literature
 saadhaaran janajivan vishisht jivan se bhinn hota he at: janasahitya kaa adarsh vishisht sahitya se pruthak hota he
 The folklore of a country or region is a symbol of all those trends from the beginning to the present, which fall under ordinary public nature
 is sahitya main janajivan kii sabhi prakaar kii bhavanaayen bina kisi kritrimata ke samaai rahati hai
 Therefore, if you want to study the entire culture of somewhere, then you will have to do special observation of the folklore
 yah lipibaddh bahut kam or maukhik adhik hota he
 However, efforts have been made to script Hindi folklore for some years and many texts have also appeared in edited form, but oral oral literature is still largely unorganized
 lok jivan kii jaisi saralatam, naiysargik anubhutimayi abhivyanjana kaa chithran lokgeeton va lok-kathaon main miltaa he, vaisaa anyatra sarvatha durlabh he
 People's heart speaks in folk literature
 prakruti swayan gaati-gunagunaati he
 The evaluation of beauty inherent in folk literature is purely cognizant
 adikaal se shruti evam smriti ke sahare jivit rahanevaale loksahitya ke kuch vishesh siddhant hai
 In this literature, only those compositions are accepted or found to be life which, after being formed in many forms from many larynx, take a common form
 yah rachanakram adikaal se abtak jari he
 Many such literary material is still prevalent today, which has not yet acquired uniformity
 paramparaagat evam samuhik pratibhaaon se nirmit hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne loksahitya ko "apaurushey" kii sangya di he
 Certainly traditional folklore is not the result of any one person's creation
 vaise to iske kai pramaan die ja sakate hai ki ek hi geet, katha yaa kahawat ek sthal par jis rup main hota he duusare sthal par pahonchte-pahonchte uskaa vah rup badal jaataa he kintu ek acha pramaan yah hoga ki saikadon varsh se gaae janevaale lokmahakavy aalh-khand ko aaj tak ekarupata nahin praapt ho saki
 In this work, folk propagation does not accept any restriction
 sfoot geeton main to keval panktiyaan hi idhar udhar hoti hai kintu prabandh geeton evam kathaon main ghatnaayen bhi badalati rahati hai
 Despite all this, almost no change is accepted in the results of those arrangements and stories
 parinaam evam lokprachlit satya tathaa tathy ko aadhaar maanakar ghatnachakra manamaane dhang se chalaae jate hai
 Take the story of Ram
 "naanaa bhanti ram avtara, raamaayan sat koti apaara" vaali baat shat pratishat satya he
 If all of the variations related to Ramkatha are prevalent in the folklore, then if all of them are collected, then this strange type of "lokramayana" will be prepared which will be of a different existence from all the Ramakhyas till date
 ghatnachakron ko dekhte hue kabhi-kabhi to unki sangati baithaana bhi kathin ho jayega
 For example, in folklore, there are many reasons for the birth of Ram, but a very simple reason is that once when Maharaj Dasaratha was going to bathe in Saryu in the morning, he appeared early in the morning to Helin, who sweeps in the street
 usne taana maaraa ki aaj praat: kaal hi satanheen vyakti kaa darshan hua, pataa nahin din kaise beetegaa
 Dasaratha realized this and then he went to do penance in the forest for his son's attainment with the queen
 is prakaar kaaran doosraa dikhaate hue bhi lokkthakaar dasharath ko phir tapasyawale sthal par le aata he jahaan katha anya ramaayanon kii katha se mil jaati hai
 Many such examples can be found which are not in the result but not in the case of events
 aise parivartanon evam sanshodhano ko loksahitya bahut hi aasaani se sweekaar kar letaa he
 The biggest feature of this literature is that despite its many forms, it has a sense of unity in diversity
 bhashaa ke kalevar ko badalakar bhi bhavapaksh main koi parivartan nahin dikhta
 The same composition which is found in the dialect there at some place, is also found in the other dialect too far
 sfoot geeton ke bhaavon evam prabandhon kii kathaon kii yah yatra kabhi kabhi to itani lambii hoti he ki aashcharya hota he
 Even though humans may set the boundaries of regions and countries, public literature does not accept it
 aisa shaayad isliye sambhav hua hoga ki yatrakaal main pracheen maanav jab kabhi dur gaya hoga to apana sahitya saath letaa gaya hoga or gantavy sthaan par uski chhap chhod aayaa hoga jise vahaan ke logon ne sweekaar kar liya hoga
 This sequence continues even today
 jab koi gramya naihar se sasuraal jaati he to swabhaavat: vah naihar kii un lokrachanaon ko apane saath leti jaati hai jo use samaran rahati hai
 It does not matter if she is married in the dialect area of maike, but when married in another dialect area, she adapts the songs of Naihar to the accents of the local dialect
 us is kaary main sasuraal kii graamyaon dwaara bhi sahaayta milti he
 In this way, the spoilage continues to go on
 lokagayak evam gayikaon kaa yah swabhaav bahut dinon se chalaa aa rahaa he ki yadi unhen kisi kavi kii rachana pasand aa gai to use tod marodakar apni boli ke anukool bana leti hai
 While doing so, sometimes the poet's name is removed and sometimes he is allowed to remain
 pramaan ke liye aaj bhi aise loakgeet sune ja sakate hai - jo sur, kabir, tulsi evam mira ke prakashit granthon main jis tarah milenge lokgayakon ke kanth par unka vah rup nahin hoga
 In some folklore, their names have been spontaneously inserted
 yah pravriti hindi hi nahin anya bhashaaon ke loksahitya main bhi pai jaati he
 Some scholars say that such hymns and songs have been composed by the folk folk themselves and to increase their usefulness, the names of high and erudite poets were added so that most people remember such songs
 par yah baat he nahin
 The folk poet is moderate at this place
 aise bahut se bhajan lokajeevan main na jane kab se chale aa rahe hai jinke rachanakaaron ke bare main pataa hi nahin chalata
 The truth is that the number of such hymns is much more than the number of hymns and they are not inferior in name to the hymns
 lokgayakon kii ek pravriti yah bhi hoti he ki ve sthaneey ghatnaon ko turant bhavabaddh kar lete hai, jaisaa 1934 ke bihar bukamp ke samay hua tha
 Zonal narrative materials that have been around for a long time are the result of this trend
 ghatnapradhan prabandh evam lokkathaayen is pravriti se janm to paa jaati hai kintu deergh jivan maatr unako miltaa he jo janamanas ko adhik kushalta ke saath chooti hai
 The language of folk literature is not the elegant and literary language but the language of ordinary people and its content is limited to the characters, emotions and influences acquired in public life
 yah to lok-sahitya kii pehali maryaada hui
 Its second dignity is not the contribution of the individual but the entire society
 yahi kaaran he ki lok-sahitya par vyakti kii chhap na hokar samgr vyakti-lok kii chhap hoti he
 When we talk about these two main limitations when it comes to craftsmanship, then it becomes clear that no practice or skill for craftsmanship can be reflected in it, because if the law of craft shows us it is social Owing to the compulsion of harmony itself
 vaise prachlit arth main shilp-vidhaan kii baat yahan nahin uthaayi ja sakati he
 People understand that a pre-anxious trade is embedded behind the craft and since there is no possibility of such a trade in folk literature, there is no question of its craft
 par tattvik drushti se dekhne par shilp-vidhaan kaa arth he abhivyakti ko abhivyajya se jodna
 Craftsmanship in folk literature is at its peak, because it is here, at most, resolute, uninterested and disinterested
 lok-sahitya ke mukhyatah chaar bhed kahe jate hai; lok-geet, lok-gaatha, lok-katha or lok-natya
 The distinction between folklore and folklore is so much that folklore operates as a long narrative song and it has a rhyme-oriented rather than a management-narrative saga, while folklore being proselytizing -satha is predominant or in other words event-oriented
 lok-natya jansulabh rangamanch ko drushti main rakhkar angik or vaachik abhinay par aadhrut swang yaa lila tak simit rahata he
 It does not have the ability to make a lasting impact due to special attention being given to timeliness
 lok-kathaon or lok-gaathaon main katha-shilp hi pramukh rahata he, keval lok-gaan aisa prakaar he, jisamen apane samgr rup main shilp-vidhaan viksit ho saktaa he, in chaaron prakaar ke roopon main shilp-vidhaan ke ye ang samaan rup se apekshit hai
 Some of its special trends of folklore are as ancient as this ancient literature
 in pravritiyon kii pushti ko hi vishaal evam vibhinn rachana karaane kaa shrey he
 For convenience, they can be divided into the following types: adikalin maanav ke prakrutipradutt vibhinn kalyankari parinaamon se prabhavit hone ke kaaran unpar jo vishwaas aropi kiya isse sambhddha sahitya iske antargat aata he
 Both the feelings of devotion and fear are embedded in it
 devi devataaon kii puja ke liye rachit tathaa andhvishwaason se sambhddha sahitya isi ke antargat he
 Some of these beliefs are zonal and some are given wide importance
 sthaneey uplabdhiyon par sthaneey or vyapak par vyapak rachanaayen milti hai
 Mantras or songs prevalent on the earth, sky, well, pond, river, stream, deeh, doyara, mari masan, tree, crop, plant, animal, demon, demon, deity, totem, brahma and pilgrimage etc
 are part of it 
 jab bhi gramin koi shubh kaary prarambh karte hai to usase sambhddha devi-devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye jin geeton athwa mantron kaa prayog hota he ve sab is sahitya main aate hai
 For the diagnosis of diseases, instead of the songs and mantras of Oshadhi are used
 udhaaharan ke liye sheetala mata ke geeton ko liya ja saktaa he
 For different Gods and Goddesses, the contents of different mantras, songs, worship and indulgence etc
 have not been determined since when
 kisi ko kuch pasand hota he parantu brahm ko in sab ke sthaan par janeu chahie
 According to these songs and mantras change, as well as priests keep changing
 iske antargat aachaar vichaar evam vyaavhaarikta tathaa vibhinn lokmanyataon se sambhddha sahitya aata he
 There is a penetration of feelings and beliefs in literature composed for ethics, but this is rarely seen in literature composed for behavior
 vyavhaar kii visheshta loksahitya main mukhya rup se dekhne ko milti he
 Let us talk about mutual behavior
 yahan saanp ko bhi doodh pilaayaa jaataa he
 The tree is also called Baba and the transferee and rivers assume the form of sister
 isi tarah anek amanviya tatwon se tathaa hinsak jantuon se sambandh jodakar sari sristi ko ek rup main bandha gaya he
 In this context, the basic purpose of composed literature is to lead a simple and happy life on the basis of practicality
 yahi kaaran he ki janajivan ek rishte main bandhaa hua he or jaateey bhedbhaav, jo bheeshan rup se vyaapt hai, uski diwaar ko tod nahin sake hai
 The relationship of grandparents, siblings etc
 is carried out in the entire village without any caste discrimination
 vibhinn avasaron ke liye prachlit lokachar bhi isi vidha ke ang hai
 Under this literature, literature related to meteorology, health science, agronomy, and Shakun etc
 comes
 lokajeevan main is prakaar ke sahitya ko aadhunik vaigyanik yug main kaaphi mahatvapurn sthaan praapt he
 These include the experiences, rules set by the foregoing and preaching things related thereto
 yah manyataayen praaia: pariksha kii kasuti par khari utarati he kintu saath hi kuch apwaad bhi hai
 Under meteorology, indications have been made for the causes of hypertrophy, drought and hypoglycemia, and exudative losses and measures to avoid them
 is prakaar ke vaigyanik sahitya ke aadhaar paramparaagat anubhav hi hote hai
 Since those experiences are very strong, the chances of their becoming spoiled like in folk songs are less
 yahi dasha krishivigyaan ke liye rache gaye sahitya kii he
 Under this, essential things related to farming have been said
 khet kii jutai kis tarah ho, kis prakaar ke khet main kis prakaar kii buaai kii jaae, beej kii maatra kitni ho, sinchai kab kii jaae, nirvaahee evam gudayi kab kii jaae tathaa kis samay fasal kii kataai ho, yah sab baaten to vaigyanik sahitya ke antargat aati hi hai, inke atirikt fasal sambandhi rogon tathaa upachaaron kaa bhi varnan miltaa he
 a large amount of literature has also been written on the identification of equipment and bulls used in agricultural work
 belon ke atirikt anya paaltu pashupakshiyon ke bare main bhi prachur sanket milte hai
 Public literature after the bulls is received regarding the identification of horses
 chunki aadhunik vaigyanik vaahanon ke kaaran ab ghode kam rakhe jate hai isliye is prakaar ke sahitya kaa dhire dhire abhaav hota ja rahaa he
 With the arrival of tractors in the village, the literature written about the identity of bulls will probably be the same
 anya paaltu pashuon main gaay, bhens evam kutton kii characha aati he kintu inpar naam maatr ke liye sanket kiya gaya he
 In birds, signs about parrot, myna, crow, munis, peacock, cuckoo and pigeon etc
 are indicated
 graminon ke upyog main jitne prakaar ke pashupakshi aate hai un sabaki pahichaan evam unase honevaale laabehani ke bare main is sahitya ke antargat sanket praapt hote hai
 In health science, signs of various diseases and ways to avoid them and medicines are indicated
 koun sa rog kyon utpann hota he tathaa kin aacharnon se rog utpann nahin hota yaa dur ho jaataa he aadi baaten ise antargat aati hai
 Also, some orders have also been given for health care routines
 jadi bootiyon kii pahchaan, unke upyog tathaa isse utpann laabehani kii charchaan bhi is vibhaag ke vishay hai
 Such signs are often presented as commands and are in verse
 yahi vidha krishivigyaan evam shakunvigyaan ke liye rache gaye sahitya main bhi apanaai gai he
 In order to start the journey mainly in Shakun ideation literature, according to chronological auspicious signs, orders have been given or forbidden for yatra due to waste
 yadi yatra bahut hi aavashyak ho or dinon kii gananaa main uskaa samay anukool na padataa ho to usase vachane ke liye upaay bataae gaye hai
 Shakun ominous information is also given by the various antics of seasons, human traits and animal husbandry under this type of literature
 jaise varsha kaal main ghar nahin chhodana chahie, mundere par yadi praat: kaal kaag bole to use kisi priy jan ke aagaman kii soochna samajni chahie, ityadi
 There is a common form of total folk literature, but at the same time there is literature based on traditional culture of different castes
 inamen un jatiyon ke nijee devi devtaa, kul devtaa ke aadesh tathaa aacharyon evam sant mahatmaon dwaara bataae gaye niyam, upanium or unki vaani shaamil hoti he
 Different cultures of different castes like - Nai, Dhobi, Ahir, Chamar, Kurmi, Koyri, Noni, Bar, Bhat etc
 and wild and other castes are under the ethnic folk culture
 yadi yah kaha jaae ki kahin kaa sampurna loksahitya vahaan kii vibhinn jatiyon kii samuhik samskruti kaa pratik hota he or anupyukt nahin hoga
 The form of folklore that survives after the removal of ethnic literature will not be a true representation of it
 is sahitya kii rachnasthali vishisht sahitya kii rachnasthali se bhinn hoti he
 It is the specialty of folk literature that none of its forms are built in isolation
 praaia: ve sabhi sthal ukt sahitya ke rachanakendre hote hai jahaan samay samay par use premi athwa aavashyaktaaon se prerit graamy jan juta karte hai
 That is why it can never be said that the form of the part of folklore today was the same yesterday and will continue to be so
 yadi ham kahen ki loksahitya kii pramukh rachnasthali chaoupal evam aangan he to beja nahin hoga
 The villagers often congregate in the chaupalas at leisure
 tarah tarah kii baaten chalati hai
 Discussion of rituals, religion discussion, story-telling, farming talk and folk songs etc
 keep on chaupalas from time to time
 vartmaan kaal kii sthaneey pramukh ghatnaayen bhi kuch dinon tak vaarta ke liye aadhaar bani rahati hai
 The material that gets life in the form of all these squeezes, they join the local literature after a few days
 yadi mahatv adhik hua to aisi rachanaaon kaa prachaar bad jaataa he or ve ek chaoupal se duusari main tathaa ek gaanv ke duusare gaanv main jaakar apana kshetra vyapak banaati rahati hai
 In this way, those compositions get included in the store of elaborate folklore in a few years
 yahi baat ogan main rache gaye sahitya par lagu hoti he jahaan gramyaayein samay samay par ekatra hoti hai
 In this way, the literature of men and women is separate from birth itself
 chaoupaalon evam aanganon ke atirikt bhi kuch aise sthaan hai jahaan is sahitya kii vibhinn vidhaayen nirmit hoti hai
 While doing nirvah or katiyas in the fields, carrying the bundles of stalks, while doing other collective wages, in pilgrimage or fair journey, near evening bonfires in winter, during festivals and ceremonial events or in short, say that when and where rural women There is an opportunity for the mobilization of men and then there is the creation of folk literature
 aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki bhootkaal main rachaa gaya sabhi loksahitya jivit he or aaj jinka nirmaan ho rahaa he unka ant kabhi nahin hoga
 The truth is that the genres of this literature change their form by accepting the effect of age
 idhar pachaas varsh ke bheetar rache gaye sahitya ko dekhne se yah baat spasht bhi ho jaati he
 Most of the scientific achievements achieved by the villages during this period have been incorporated in public literacy
 pracheen loksahitya main aae jaadu ke udan khatole ko chhodkar is yug ke loksahitya ne sidhe sidhe hawaii jahaaj ko sweekaar kiya he
 By the way, vehicles such as bullock cart, horse, camel, elephant and boats are still alive in the folklore, but motor and train have also made their way
 vartmaan kaal main honevaale nav nirmaanon ko bhi ukt sahitya main sthaan miltaa ja rahaa he
 These literary works are also associated with all the characteristics which give them long life
 praaia: vidvan log yah kaha karte hai ki yadi vistrut loksahitya kaa sangrah nahin kar liya gaya to unka lop ho jayega
 This is true because due to the impact of the era, ancient creations seem inappropriate and then slowly disappear, as is happening at this time
 cinema ke geeton ne gaanvon main apana sthaan bana liya he jisase loakgeet kshinta ko praapt ho rahe hai
 Due to the spread of education, there is a lack of men and women singing songs in the dialects of villages
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kuch dinon main vibhinn sanskaron ke avasar par gaae janevaale pracheen lokgeeton kaa lop ho jayega or unke sthaan par naveen geet sthaan paayenge yaa yadi ichha hui to loksahitya ke sangrahon kaa dekh-dekh kar padhi likhi striyaan geet gaakar kaam chalaengi
 The flour grinder has reached the village tomorrow and many more instruments are proliferating, so "zantasar" and some other labor related songs are becoming scarcity
 isi tarah vartmaan yug kii ghatnaayen bhi isamen sweekaar kii ja rahi hai
 Rani of Jhansi, Kunwar Singh, Gandhiji, Subhash Chandra, Bhagat Singh, Khudiram and Chandrashekhar Azad etc

 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir

 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar

 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent

 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war

 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch

 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan

 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time

 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly

 With this occupation Pakistan came into being

 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be

 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack

 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away

 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision

 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill

 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries

 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat

 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar

 After this, this place came to be known as Patton Nagar over the Pakistani tanko named Patton made in America

 The ratio of India and Pakistan Air Forces during the conflict was 5: 1

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha
 The Pakistan Air Force's F-104 Starfighter was the fastest flying fighter aircraft in the subcontinent at the time and was often called the "pride of the Pakistan Air Force"
 lekin sajaad haidar ke anusaar ve vimaan is sammaan ke laayak nahin the kyonki ye "40,000 feet se adhik kii oonchai par udne vaale soviet bamavarshakon ko rokane va muqabla karne ke udeshy" se bane the, naa ki kam oonchaai par tej tarraar fiter vimaanon ke saath ladane ke liye
 Therefore, they were not suitable for the atmosphere of that time

 Yet with the supersonic pace in the feud battle between Saber and Nats, Saber was far more successful

 The Pakistani Air Force claimed that it dropped 104 aircraft from India and lost 19 of its aircraft, while the Indian Air Force claimed that it dropped 73 aircraft from Pakistan and lost 35 of its aircraft

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war
 swatantra sutron ke anusaar, pieef ne kuch 20 vimaan kho die the jabaki bharatiyon ne 60-75 vimaan kho diye the
 Pakistan lost 17 percent of its front-line strength by the end of the war, while India's losses were less than 10 percent

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded

 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena In solid state physics, the band gap is the range of electron energy in which no electron state exists

 In 1958, it was merged with Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favour of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed,
 These manuscripts are edited by the Principal of the College and published in book form
 The series of books are known as Sarasvati Bhavana Texts
 More than 400 books have been published in the series 

 From 1791 to 1844 the college was governed by the Administrative officers of the city
 Later British officers decided that Indians should also obtain knowledge of European literature and Philosophy
 Therefore they ordered the appointment of a Principal for the college
 The qualification laid down was the Principal must be a scholar of Sanskrit with knowledge of European literature and philosophy
the Principals from 1844 were: Mukut Bihari Lal Agarwal, MLA in the Second Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India

 Jain philosophy is based on seven truths or fundamental principles, which are called tattva
 yah maanav durgati kii prakruti or uskaa nidaan karne kaa prayaas he
 According to the first two truths, it is axiomatic that Jiva and Ajiva exist
 teesraa satya he ki do padaarthon, jeev or ajeev ke mail se, jo yoga kehalaata he, karm dravya jeev main pravaahit hota he
 It clings to the organism and turns into karma
 chauthaa satya bandha kaa kaarak he, jo chetana kii abhivyakti ko simit karata he
 The fifth truth states that the stopping of new deeds is possible through self-restraint through adherence to right character, right philosophy and right knowledge
 gahan aatmasanyam dwaara maujuuda karmon ko bhi jalaayaa ja saktaa, is chhatwein satya ko "nirjara" shabd dwaara vyakt kiya gaya he
 The final truth is that when the Jiva is freed from the bondage of deeds, Moksha or Nirvana is attained, which is the goal of Jain education
 jain dharm ke anusaar aatma ek vaastaviktaa ke rup main maujuud he
 The soul has a separate existence from the body in which it lives
 chetana or upyog jeev ke lakshan hote he
 Although the creature realizes both birth and death, it does not actually create and destroy
 mrityu or janm keval jeev ke ek avasthaa ke khatm hone or agali dasha ke shuru hone ko darshaati he
 The influx of deeds is called asrava
 yah tab hota he, jab man, samvaad or sharir kii gatividhiyon dwaara utpann spandan ke kaaran karm kan aatma kii ore aakarshith hote hai| tattwarthsutra 6:1-2 ke anusaar, "man, samvaad or sharir kii gatividhiyon ko yoga kehete hai
 Due to these three actions there is an influx of Asravas or deeds
 " Deeds only affect the consciousness
 chetana ke saath karmon ke is bandhan ko bandha kehete hai
 However, there is no bonding only through yoga or activities
 bandha ke kai kaarnon main se, raag mukhya kaaran he
 In fact, the reason for sticking to karma is the stickiness of the soul, which is due to the existence of various ragas and mental nature
 karmon kii roak ko sanvar kehate hai
 The first step towards liberation or self-realization is to ensure that the paths through which karma is entering the soul are closed and new karma is not gathered
 ise karmon ke antarvah ko rokna yaa sanvar kaha jaataa he
 It is said to destroy or clear the already collected karma
 nirjara do prakaar kii hoti hai- Salvation of soul or redemption from deeds is called moksha
 yah aatma ke astitv kii aanandit avasthaa he, jo karmon ke bandhan se, sansar se or janm maran ke chakra se puri tarah mukt hoti he
 a liberated soul attains its true and original nature - infinite happiness, infinite knowledge and infinite philosophy
 aisi aatma ko siddh yaa paramatma kaha jaataa he or sarvocch aatma yaa bhagwaan maani jaati he

 Its ancient name in the south was "nandinagari"
 ho saktaa he "nandinagar" koi sthansuchak ho or is lipi kaa usase kuch sambandh rahaa ho
 It may also be that "nagar" people used to write in it, hence "nagari" was written and when Sanskrit texts were also written in it, "devanagari" was also called

 Brahmi and Devanagari script: The practice of writing the language in scripts started in India itself
 bharat se ise sumerion, babyloniyan or unani logon ne siikhaa
 Brahmi and Devanagari script was practiced in ancient times
 brahmi or devanagari lipiyon se hi duniyabar kii anya lipiyon kaa janm hua
 The Brahmi script is an ancient script from which many Asian scripts have developed
 brahmi bhi kharoshtee kii tarah hi puure asia main faili hui thi
 It is said that the Brahmi script is 10,000 years old but it is also said that this script is even older than that
 samraat ashok ne bhi is lipi ko apanaaya : mahaan samraat ashok ne brahmi lipi ko dhammalipi naam diya tha
 The Brahmi script is also considered ancient than the Devanagari script
 kaha jaataa he ki yah pracheen sindhu-saraswati lipi se nikali lipi he
 People of Harappan culture used this script in addition to the Indus script, when Sanskrit language was also written in this script
 bhashavaigyanik drushti se devanagari lipi aksharatmak lipi maani jaati he

 paashchaatya or anek bhartiya bhashavigyanvigyon ke mat se lipi kii aksharatmak avasthaa ke baad alphabetic avasthaa kaa vikaas hua
 The most developed stage is considered to be the phonetic script
 "devanagari" ko aksharatmak isliye kaha jaataa he ki iske varna- akshar hai- swar bhi or vyanjan bhi
 The consonants "a", "b", etc
 are recitation - are inaccurate
 ve keval dhvaniyaan nahin hai apitu saswar akshar hai
 Hence, there are alphabets like Greek, Roman etc
 parantu yahan yah dhyaan rakhane kii baat he ki bharat kii "brahmi" yaa "bharti" varnmaala kii dhvaniyon main vyanjanon kaa "panini" ne varnsamamnay ke 14 sutron main jo swaroop parichay diya he- uske vishay main "patanjali" ne yah spasht bataa diya he ki vyanjanon main saniyojit "akar" swar kaa upyog keval uccharan ke uddeshy se he
 It is not essentially a part of the varna
 is drushti se vichaar karte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki is lipi kii varnmaala tatvat: dhvanyatmak he, aksharatmak nahin
 The alphabet of Devanagari has 12 vowels and 34 consonants
 shunya yaa ek yaa adhik vyanjanon or ek swar ke mail se ek akshar banataa he
 The following vowels are given for modern Hindi
 sanskrit main inke uccharan thode alag hote hai
 In Sanskrit, Ai is a combination of two vowels and is spoken like "A-I" or "A-I"
 isi tarah ou "a-u" yaa "aa-u" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, these alphabets in Hindi and Sanskrit are also considered vowels: jab kisi swar prayog nahin ho, to vahaan par 'a' mana jaataa he
 The absence of a vowel is indicated by a plow or a pause
 jaise ki k kh g gh
 In Hindi, mainly from Arabic and Persian languages, to write in Devanagari, the letters below some characters are used
 kintu hindi main bhi adhikansh log nukton kaa prayog nahin karte
 Apart from this, nukes are also not used in writing Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali and other languages in Devanagari
 ji kaa prayog mukhyatah pahari bhashaaon main hota he jaise kii dogri main "aansu" ke liye shabd he "adru"
 e and d in Hindi are not derived from Persian or Arabic, nor are they found in Sanskrit
 asal main ye sanskrit ke saadhaaran da or dha ke badale hue rup hai
 Devanagari numerals are written as follows: devanagari lipi main do vyanjan kaa sanyuktakshar nimna rup main likhaa jaataa he : In the Brahmi family scripts, the Devanagari script supports the most conjunctures

 Acharya Vinoba Bhave was the author of many scripts of the world
 unki spasht dharna thi ki devanagari lipi bharat hi nahin, sansar kii sarvaadhik vaigyanik lipi he
 If it is practiced for all the languages of India, then all Indians will come very close to each other

 Similarly Vinoba Bhave thought that- buddha samskruti se prabhavit kshetra nagari ke liye nayaa nahin he
 China and Japan treat hieroglyphs
 in chitron kii sankhya bahut adhik hone ke kaaran bhashaa seekhney main bahut kathinaayee hoti he
 Being a vessel of Devvani, Devanagari can also go beyond India's borders and offer a suitable option for China and Japan
 bhartiya mul ke log sansar main jahaan-jahaan bhi rahete hai, ve devanagari se parichay rakhte hai, visheshkar marishas, surinam, fiji, gayana, trinidad, tubago aadi ke log
 In this way, the Devanagari script can not only bind all the provinces in India in love, but can also make 'bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay' and make different countries a more smooth and scientific One can claim the title of 'vishwa Nagari' in the twenty-first century by providing an alternative
