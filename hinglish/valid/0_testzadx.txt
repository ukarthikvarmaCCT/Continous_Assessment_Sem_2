 He has been an outstanding contributor to the folk singing of Gujarat, the songs sung by him still hum the women of the state

 Diwali Ben was born on 2 June 1943 in Dalkhania village of Ghari tehsil of Amreli district
 unke pita punja bhai railway main naukari karte the
 In 1952, Punjabhai's family moved to Junagadh
 uske baad unhone uskaa vivaah rajkot main kar diya
 Here, due to a dispute with his father, Punja Bhai, he broke this marriage
 sasuraal main keval do din hi rahane ke baad ve maayke aa gai, uske baad ve kabhi rajkot apane sasuraal nahin gai
 He never married again

 The languages related among themselves are called language families
 koun bhashaayen kis parivaar main aati hai, inke liye vaigyanik aadhaar hai
 There are three stages in the languages of the world at this time
 vibhinn deshon kii pracheen bhashaayen jinka adhyayan or vargeekaran paryaapt saamagree ke abhaav main nahin ho sakaa he, pehali avasthaa main he
 Their existence is still preserved in the ancient inscriptions, coins and handwritten books available in them
 mesopotemia kii puraani bhashaa ‘sumereey’ tathaa italy kii pracheen bhashaa ‘etrascan’ isi tarah kii bhashaayen hai
 In the second stage, there are modern languages, which have not been able to study and divide despite the abundant material in the absence of proper research
 bask, bushman, japani, korian, andamani aadi bhashaayen isi avasthaa main hai
 There is enough material in the languages of the third stage and they have been studied and classified
 greek, arabi, farsi, sanskrit, angreji aadi anek viksit evam samrudh bhashaayen iske antargat hai
 Language is related to person, society and country
 isliye prayek bhashaa kii nijee visheshta hoti he
 On the basis of these, she establishes equality with some languages on one hand and inequality with many languages on the other
 mukhyatah yah vaishishtagat samya-vaishamy do prakaar kaa hota he–akritimulak or arthtatva sambandhi
 Under the first, the similarity of the shape of the words i
e
 the composition of words and sentences is seen
 duusare main arthtatva kii samanta rahati he
 According to them, there are two methods of classification of languages - morphological and family or historical
 is vivechan kaa sambandh aitihaasik vargeekaran se he isliye uske aadhaaron ko thodaa vistaar se jaan lenaa chahie
 In addition to morphological similarities, it should also have the following similarities
 bhugolic drushti se praayah samipsth bhashaaon main samanta or duurastha bhashaaon main asamanta paayi jaati he
 On this basis, the languages of the world are divided into African, Eurasia, Pacific and oceanic sections
 kintu yah aadhaar bahut adhik vaigyanik nahin he
 Because two adjacent languages can be different from each other and two remote languages are mutually similar
 bharat kii hindi or malayalam do bhinn parivaar kii bhashaayen hai kintu bharat or england jaise duurastha deshon kii sanskrit or angreji ek hi parivaar kii bhashaayen hai
 The languages in which similar words prevail are kept under a clan
 yah samanta bhashaa-bhashiyon kii sameeptha par aadhaarit he or do tarah se sambhav hoti he
 Equality comes when words of the same society, caste or family are treated equally
 iske atirikt jab bhinn desh athwa jati ke log sabhyataa or sadhano ke viksit ho jane par raajnneetik athwa vyavsaayik hetu se ek-duusare ke sampark main aate hai to shabdon ke aadan-pradaan dwaara unamem samanta sthapit ho jaati he
 The first type of conformity is useful for family classification
 kyonki aise shabd bhashaa ke mul shabd hote hai
 In these also, the words nouns, pronouns etc
 used in the family life of Nityaprati are more useful
 is aadhaar main sabase badi kathinaayee yah hoti he ki anya bhashaaon se aaye hue shabd bhashaa ke viksit hote rahane se mul shabdon main aise ghulmil jate hai ki unako pahchaan kar alag karnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 The solution to this difficulty is semantic equality to a extent
 kyonki ek parivaar kii bhashaaon ke anek shabd arth kii drushti se samaan hote hai or aise shabd unhen ek parivaar se sambandhit karte hai
 Therefore, semantic similarity is also an important basis
 prayek bhashaa kaa apana dhwani-siddhanth or uccharan-niyam hota he
 This is why she is not as quickly affected by the sounds of other languages and, as far as possible, replaces them with their nearest sounds according to phonemes
 jaise farsi kii k, kha, fa aadi dhvaniyaan hindi main nikatavarti k, kha, pha aadi main parivartit hoti he
 Hence the basis of phonology is more reliable than syllogism
 vaise kabhi-kabhi ek bhashaa ke dhvanisamooh main duusari bhashaa kii dhvaniyaan bhi milakar viksit ho jaati hai or tulanaatmak nishkarshon ko bhraamak kar detii hai
 The Aryan languages did not have idyllic sounds before the Vedic period, but developed further under the influence of the Dravidian language
 vyakaranik aadhaar sabase adhik pramanik hota he
 Because it does not change quickly due to language discipline
 vyakaran kii samanta ke antargat dhaatu, dhaatu main pratyay lagaakar shabd-nirmaan vyakaranik prakriya dwaara shabdon se padon kii rachana tathaa vaakyon main pad-vinyas ke niyam aadi kii samanta kaa nirdhaaran aavashyak he
 Classification of languages is done on these four grounds, ensuring maximum equality
 is sambandh main spashtrup se samaj lenaa chahie ki yah samya-vaishamy saapekshik he
 While on the one hand, the languages of the European family are different from those of the other family languages and on the other hand, on the other hand, the Indian languages of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek etc
 are also different from each other on the same basis
 vargeekaran karte samay sabase pehle bhugolic sameeptha ke aadhaar par sampurna bhashaayen uresia, prashantmahasaagar, africa or america khandon athwa chakron main vibhakt hoti hai
 Then different families are made by keeping the languages with mutual similarities in a clan or family
 avesta, farsi, sanskrit, greek aadi kii tulana se pataa chalaa ki unki shabdaawalee, dhvanisamooh or rachana-paddati main kaaphi samanta he
 Therefore, an Indian family has been made of such languages of India and Europe
 pariwaron ko virgon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 Shatam and Cantum are similar classes in the indo-european family
 virgon kaa vibhaajan shaashaon main hua he
 The 'iranian' and 'bharatiya Arya' are the main branches of the Shatam class
 shakhaon ko upashakha main baanta gaya he
 Grierson has divided modern Indian Aryan languages into inner and outer subdivisions
 atah main upashakhaayen bhashaa-samudaayon or samudaay bhashaaon main bantate hai
 In this way language is a unit of family-classification
 is samay bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaaon kaa adhyayan itnaa ho chukaa he ki yah purna prakriya us par lagu ho jaati he
 There may be slight manipulation of these names, but there is usually no difference in the stages of this process
 unnisvin shatee main hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan sansar kii bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii ore aakrisht hua or aaj tak samay-samay par anek vidwaanon ne apane alag-alag vargeekaran prastut kiye hai; kintu abhi tak koi vaigyanik or pramanik vargeekaran prastut nahin ho sakaa he
 There is a big difference among linguists regarding this problem
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan ek ore federikh mular in pariwaron kii sankhya 100 tak maanate hai vahaan duusari ore rice vishwa kii samast bhashaaon ko keval ek hi parivaar main rakhte hai
 But most scholars consider them to be twelve or thirteen
 duniya bhar main boli jane vaali qareeb saat hazaar bhashaaon ko kam se kam das pariwaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he jinamein se pramukh pariwaron kaa zikr neeche he : Main article indo-european language family yah samooh bhashaaon kaa sabase bada parivaar he or sabase mahatvapurn bhi he kyonki angrezi,roosi, pracheen farsi, hindi, punjabi, german - ye tamaam bhashaayen isi samooh se sambandh rakhti hai
 It is also called 'indo-european language family'
 vishwa jansankhya ke lagbhag aadhe log bhaaropee bhashaa bolte hai
 Classical languages like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin also belong to this group
 lekin arabi ek bilkul vibhinn parivaar se sambandh rakhti he
 The ancient languages of this family were extroverted scholastic-yogic
 isi samooh ko pehle arya-parivaar bhi kaha jaataa tha
 According to the population, the largest language in the world, Mandarin belongs to this family
 china or tibet main boli jane vaali kai bhashaaon ke alaava burmi bhashaa bhi isi parivaar kii he
 His voice is the same
 ek hi shabd agar unche yaa neeche swar main bolaa jaay to shabd kaa arth badal jaataa he
 Mr
 Rajendra Singh has named this language family 'nag Bhasha Parivar' in the context of India
 ise 'ekakshar parivaar' bhi kehete hai
 The reason is that its root words are often monosyllabic
 ye bhashaayen kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttaranchal, nepal, sikkim, pashchim bengal, bhutan, arunachal pradesh, assam, nagaland, meghalaya, manipur, tripura or mizoram main boli jaati hai
 Its major languages included Arami, Asseri, Sumeri, Akkadi, and Canaanite, but the best-known languages of the group today are Arabic and Hebrew
 in bhashaaon main mukhyatah teen dhaatu-akshar hote hai or bich main swar ghusaakar inase kriya or sangyaayen banaayi jaati hai 
 The Dravidian family of languages is interesting in the sense that although these languages are spoken in the southern regions of India, they have no connection with the languages spoken in the northern region
 isliye urdu yaa hindi kaa angrezi yaa german bhashaa se to koi rishta nikal saktaa he lekin malayalam bhashaa se nahin
 Some 26 languages of the Dravidian group are spoken in southern India and Sri Lanka but the more famous among them are Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada
 ye ant-ashlisht-yogtmak bhashaayen hai
 Other names based on the major languages - 'turani', 'sidian', 'phony-tatarik' and 'turk-mongol-manchu' are also clans
 iskaa kshetra bahut vistrut he, kintu mukhyatah siberia, manchuriya or mongolia main hai
 The major languages are Turkish or Tatari, Kyrgyz, Mogul and Manchu, of which the most prominent is Turkish
 saahitiyik bhashaa osmanali he
 Arabic and Persian had a great influence on Turkey, but nowadays its vocabulary has a lot of its own
 dhwani or shabdaawalee kii drushti se is kul kii ural or altaai bhashaayen ek-duusare se kaaphi bhinn hai
 Therefore some scholars are also in favor of keeping them in two separate clans, but of course on grammatical similarity, they are languages of the same clan
 pratyayon ke yoga se shabdanirmaan kaa niyam, dhaatuon kii aparivartaneeyata, dhaatu or pratyayon kii swaranurupata aadi ek kul kii bhashaaon kii mukhya visheshtaayen hai
 By form, the meaning is that when the word suffix is applied to the object, the words are masculine, but in general the words of larger size and higher strength are masculine and masculine and feminine are indicative of weak and small size objects

 shishugrah un thos vastuon ko kehete hai jo kisi taare ke ird-gird ke aadigrah chakra yaa malba chakra main ban rahi hoti hai
 Although astronomers have not really seen any infantile till date, but the idea of planetary formation is that there is a circle of celestial dust orbiting around a star in the beginning
 phir is chakra ke kan ek-duusare se takaarte he or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke kaaran kabhi-kabhi ek-duusare se chipak jate hai
 Gradually things start to form
 kuch vastuen jab bada aakaar kar leti hai to unka gurutvkarshan bhi bad jaataa he or ve or tezi se kanon ko apni ore khinch kar aakaar badhaane lagati hai
 At this stage they are called Shishugraha because they soon have the gravitational ability to draw other objects and debris to form the shape of the planet
 badhate-badhate kuch samay main inkaa aakaar hamaare chandramaa jitna ho jaataa he or bhayankar gurutvkarshan kii sikudan se iskaa rup bhi golakaar hone lagata he
 Then, orbiting its star, it merges all the objects located in its orbit and clears its path
 antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh ke niyamon ke tahat yah parikrama kaksha main sthit vastuon or malbe ko saafe kar lene kii prakriya hi grah kaa darja paa lene kii paribhaasha he

 In the sixth text of the Natya Shastra, the author Bharata writes in Sanskrit "vibhabanubhava vyabhichari saayogichari nishpathihi" meaning the union of vibhava, experience and adulteration produces juice

 This feeling is then called 'natya Ras'
 kuch logo kii raay he ki ras or bhav kii uthta unke milan ke saath hoti he
 But this is not true, because the cook is born with emotions, but the spirit is not born of the cook
 isi kaaran ke liye bhaavo ko raso kaa mul mana jaataa he
 Just as the taste or juice can be made with spices, vegetables and good, in the same way juice can be made with permanent expressions and other expressions and there is no permanence which does not increase the juice and likewise, permanence, effect, feeling and adulteration Emotion leads to growth of juice
 bhav darshak ko arth detaa he

 Permanent emotion is made up of emotions and adultery is ancillary
 When permanent adulterous combination is combined with emotion and experience, juice is formed
 The Natyasastra states that "a good taste is produced when different spices are mixed together, by the way
 Only the lasting taste enhances the taste of the juice
 " yah gaur kaa baat he kii bhav bhavukta ke utpaadan main ek mukh bhaag karata he

 Then it cleans the ante of the surface and put it in an acid solution
 phir use baahar nikaalkar sukhaane ke baad jhanva tathaa surkhi se ragad kar chikanahat paidaa kar dete hai
 After this action, a thin layer of mercury crosses the surface, then pours it in water for some time and thus it becomes gold-pliable
 sone kii baarik pattiyaan chipkaane se ye paare se mil jaati hai
 As a result of heating, the mercury flies away and the gold remains in a state of brownness, rubbing it with agate varnish to make it shiny
 is vidhi main sone kaa praaia: duguna paara lagata he tathaa paare kii pun: prapti nahin hoti
 Chemical gilding involves methods in which the gold used remains as a chemical compound in some form or the other

 prithviraj raso hindi bhashaa main likhaa ek mahakavy he jisamen prithviraj chouhan ke jivan or charitra kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Its author Rao Chand Bardai Bhatt who was from the Kaladi Gautra of Chandisa Rao and was a childhood friend and prince of Prithviraj and also encouraged the army with poems of Veer Ras during his war travels
 1165 se 1192 ke bich jab prithviraj chouhan kaa rajya ajmer se dilli tak failaa hua tha
 Prithvirajasso is a huge treatise of two and a half thousand pages which has 69 times
 pracheen samay main prachlit praayah sabhi chhandon kaa isamen vyavhaar hua he
 The main verses are Kavitta, Duha, Tomar, Trotak, Gaha and Arya
 jaise kadambari ke sambandh main prasiddh he ki uskaa pichhlaa bhaag baan bhatta ke putr ne puraa kiya he, vaise hi raso ke pichley bhaag kaa bhi chand ke putr jalhan dwaara purna kiya gaya he
 According to Raso, when Shahabuddin Ghori imprisoned Prithviraj and took him to Ghazni, then Chand went there a few days later
 jate samay kavi ne apane putr jalhan ke haath main raso kii pustak dekar use purna karne kaa sanket kiya
 The handing over of Rasohan to Raso and its completion is mentioned in Raso - raso main die hue sanwaton kaa aitihaasik tathyon ke saath anek sthanon par mail na khaane ke kaaran anek vidwaanon ne prithvirajraso ke samasamyik kisi kavi kii rachana hone main andeh karte he or use 16veen shatabdi main likhaa hua granth tehraate hai
 The oldest copy of this composition is found in the official library of Bikaner, there is a total of 3 copies
 rachana ke ant me prithviraj dwaara shabd bhedi baan chalaa kar gauri ko maarane kii baat bhi kii gayi he
 Prithvirajasso is a poet of the Rasak tradition
 jaisaa iske naam se hi prakat he, dilli ke antim hindu samrat prithviraj ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko lekar likhaa gaya hindi kaa ek granth jo raav chandvardaai bhatta kaa likhaa mana jaataa rahaa he
 Earlier, Hindi was familiar to only one form of this poem, which incidentally was the most elaborate form of composition, it contained about eleven thousand metaphors
 uske baad rachana kaa ek usase chota rup kuch pratiyon main mila, jisamen lagbhag saadhe teen hajaar roopak the
 After that, a form was obtained in few copies, in which the total metaphor did not exceed twelve hundred
 tadnantar do pratiyaan uski aisi bhi praapt hui jinamein kramash: chaar sau or saadhe paanch sau roopak hi the
 All these copies presented various complete forms of composition
 rachana ke kuch khandon kii pratiyaan bhi praapt hui hai, jinka sambandh uparyukt pratham do roopon se rahaa he
 Thus, naturally a dispute arose as to how the various complete forms mentioned above developed
 kuch vidwaanon ne isse sarvatha bhinn mat prakat kiya
 He said that the biggest form must have been the original form of the composition and from that only progressively smaller forms would have been presented as abbreviations
 inhone iskaa pramaan yah diya ki rachana kaa koi rup, yahan tak ki sabase chota rup bhi, anaitihaasikta se mukt nahin he
 But this dispute was then abandoned here and no attempt was made to resolve it for a long time
 iskaa pratham ullekhneey prayaas 1955 main hua
 When a scholar wrote the article titled The Relation of the Three Texts of Prithviraj Raso, it showed that the numbers that represent the forces of Prithviraj and his opposition are found in three different texts of composition: the largest, the smaller and the smaller
 And if looked at as a whole, the quantity of exaggeration in relation to these numbers is also reduced progressively in the above mentioned sequence
 yadi ye paath brihatmadhyamalaghulaghutam kram main viksit hue hote, to sankshep kriya ke kaaran balaabal suchak sankhyaon main koi antar na miltaa
 Therefore it is evident that the sequence of development of the obtained forms is the shortest
 prabandh kii drushti se yadi ham rachana kii uktishrinkhalaaon or chandashrankhalaon tathaa prasangashrinkhalaaon par dhyaan den to vahaan bhi dekhenge ki ye shrinkhalaayen laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat kram main hi uttarottar adhikadhik tuuti hai or bich bich main isi kram se adhikadhik chand or prasang prakshepakartaataon ke dwaara rakhe gaye hai
 But even the smallest form of composition is not completely free from these series of errors, so it is clearly known that the original form of 'raso' must have been smaller than the shortest form
 'prithvirajraso' kii katha sankshep main is prakaar he : prithviraj jis samay dilli ke singhaasana par tha, kannauj ke raja jayachand ne rajasuya yajna karne kaa nishchay kiya or isi avasar par usne apni kanya sanyogita kaa swayamvar bhi karne kaa sankalp kiya
 He sent the invitation of Rajsuya to far-flung kings and invited Prithviraj to join him
 prithviraj or uske saamanton ko yah baat khali ki bahuvachanon ke hote hue bhi koi anya rajasuya yajna kare or prithviraj ne jayachand kaa nimantran asweekaar kar diya
 Even then Jaichand determined to perform the Rajasuya Yajna and installed a statue of Prithviraj as the gatekeeper at the door of the Yagyamandap
 prithviraj swabhaavat: is ghatana se apmaan samajhakar kshubdh hua
 Meanwhile, she also got the news that Jaichand's daughter Sanyogita has resolved to disguise Prithviraj as a husband, ignoring the father's words, and Jaichand is enraged at this and has sent her to a different Gangsattar residence
 in samaacharon se santapt hokar vah rajdhani ke baahar akhet main apana samay kisi prakaar bitaa rahaa tha ki uski anupasthiti se laabh uthaakar uske mantri kaivas ne uski ek karnaati daasi se anuchit sambandh kar liya or ek din raat ko uske kaksh main pravisht ho gaya
 When Pattaragini came to know about this, he immediately called Prithviraj and Prithviraj came to the Raj Bhavan in two clocks at night
 jab use ukt daasi ke kaksh main kaivas ko dikhaaya gaya, usne raatri ke andhkaar main hi unhen lakshya karke baan chode
 The first arrow missed but as soon as the second arrow started, the canvas collapsed
 rato raat donon ko ek gadde main gadwakar prithviraj akhet par chalaa gaya, phir duusare din rajdhani ko lautaa
 When the woman from Kaivas prayed to Chand to get her dead husband's body, Chand requested Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne chand kaa yah anurodh is shart par sweekaar kiya ki vah use apane saath le jaakar kannauj dikhayega
 Both friends hugged and cried
 prithviraj ne kaha ki is apmaanpurn jivan se maran acha tha or uske kavimitra ne uski is bhaavana kaa anumodan kiya
 His widow became Sati by taking the dead body of Canvas
 chand ke saath thawitt ke shesh main prithviraj ne kannauj ke liye prayaag kiya
 He also took hundred brave Rajput feudal soldiers together
 kannauj pahunchakar jayachand ke darbar main gaya
 Jaichand welcomed him a lot and asked him about Prithviraj's age, form etc
 chand ne uskaa jaisaa kuch vivaran diya, vah uske anuchar thawitt main dekhakar jayachand kuch sashankit hua
 He called a maid along with other maids, who had previously served Prithviraj, on the pretext of offering a drink to the poet
 usne prithviraj ko thwitt ke vesh main dekhakar sir dhank liya
 But someone said that Chand was an integral part of Prithviraj, so the maid covered her head after seeing her and the matter ended there itself
 kintu duusare din praat: kaal jab jayachand chand ke dere par usase milane gaya, thawitt ko singhaasana par baitha dekhakar use pun: shankaa hui
 Chand tried to alleviate his doubts by making excuses and asked Thawitt to offer him a drink
 paan dete hue thawitt veshi prithviraj ne jo vakr drushti phenki, usase jayachand ko bhalee bhanti nishchay ho gaya ki yah swayan prithviraj he or usne prithviraj kaa saamana datakar karne kaa aadesh nikaala
 Here Prithviraj went out to revolve around the city
 jab vah ganga main machhliyon ko moti chuga rahaa tha, sanyogita ne ek daasi ko usko thik thik pahchaanane tathaa uske prithviraj hone par apana premanivedan karne ke liye bheja
 When the maid decided that she was Prithviraj, she pleaded for coincidence
 prithviraj tadnantar sanyogita se mila or donon kaa us gangatatavarti awaas main panigrahan hua
 At that time he left from there, but at the behest of his feudal lords, he again came to know and brought with him coincidence
 jab usne is prakaa sanyogita kaa apharan kiya, chand ne lalkaakar jayachand se kaha ki uskaa shatru prithviraj uski kanya kaa varan kar ab usase daayaj ke rup main yuddh maang rahaa tha
 As a result, conflict started on both sides
 do dinon ke yuddh main jab prithviraj ke anek yoddha maare gaye, saamanton ne use yuddh kii vidha badalane kii salaah di
 He suggested that he proceed towards Delhi with Sanyogita and that he should prevent Jaichand's army from proceeding in the path of Delhi till he reached Delhi with Sanyogita
 prithviraj ne is sweekaar kar liya or anek saamanton tathaa shur veeron yauddhaon kii bali ne ananthar sanyogita ko lekar dilli gaya
 Jaichand returned to Kannauj with his army
 dilli pahunchakar prithviraj sanyogita ke saath, vilasamagn ho gaya
 He did not get out of the house for six months, which resulted in resentment in his Guru, Bandhav, Bhatia and Lok
 praja ne raajaguru se ksht kaa nivedan kiya to raajaguru chand ko lekar sanyogita ke awaas par gaya
 Together, they sent Prithviraj a magazine listing of Ghori's attack and sent it to the messenger maid: 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anurat
 ' raja kii vilasanidra bhang hui or vah sanyogita se vidaa hokar yuddh ke liye nikal padaa
 Shahabuddin had brought a huge army this time
 prithviraj ke anek shur yoddha or samant kannoj yuddh main hi maare ja chuke the
 As a result, Prithviraj's army returned from the battlefield and Shahabuddin emerged victorious
 prithviraj bandi kiya gaya or gazani le jaaya gaya
 After a few days there Shahabuddin got his eyes removed
 jab chand prithviraj ke kashton kaa samachar mila, vah gazani apane mitra tathaa swami ke uddhaar ke liye avadhoot ke vesh main chal padaa
 He met Shahabuddin
 vahaan jane kaa kaaran poochne par usne bataaya ki ab vah badarikashram jaakar tap karnaa chahta tha kintu ek saadh uske ji main shesh thi, isaliye vah abhi vahaan nahin gaya tha
 He took birth with Prithviraj and they played together in childhood
 usee samay prithviraj ne usase kaha tha ki vah singini ke dwaara bina fal ke baadh se hi saat ghadiyaalon ko ek saath bedh saktaa tha
 He could not see this skill of his, and now seeing that he wanted to complete his practice
 gori ne kaha ki vah to andhaa kiya ja chukaa he
 Chand said that he could still show the same skill, he believed it
 shahabuddin ne uski yah maang sweekaar kar lee or tatsambandhi sara aayojan karaayaa
 Disappointed with life on Chand's encouragement, Prithviraj also accepted his request to kill the enemy on the pretext of showing his confederation skills
 prithviraj se sweekruti lekar chand shahabuddin ke paas gaya or kaha ki vah lakshyavedh tabhi karne ko taiyaar hua he jab vah swayan apane mukh se use teen baar lakshavedh karne kaa ahvaahan kare
 Shahabuddin accepted it as well
 1 Shah gave two orders, then the third one gave as soon as he got hit by Prithviraj's arrow and he was dashed
 prithviraj kaa bhi ant hua
 The gods inflicted wreaths on him and the earth exulted after getting a descent from Mlechha Ghori
 yahan par 'prithvirajraso' kii katha samaapt hoti he
 There has been a huge controversy over the historicity of 'raso', especially since famous scholar and archaeologist Vuilar got a fragmented copy of Sanskrit poetry called 'prithviraj Vijay'
 yah vivaad uske brihat paath ko lekar chalaa he, kintu rachana kaa laghutam paath tak aisa nahin he jo anaitihaasikta se sarvatha mukt ho
 For example, Jaichand mentions that Karna of Dahl was defeated and imprisoned twice, but he was about one hundred hundred years before Jaichand
 jayachand se hue kahe gaye prithviraj ke yuddh ke sambandh main koi nishchit aitihasika samarthan abhi tak nahin praapt ho sakaa he
 Prithviraj was the ruler of Ajmer; The ruler of Delhi was a Govindarai or Khanderai who fought both the wars on behalf of Prithviraj and was killed in another war
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar gori se prithviraj ke keval do yuddh hue the, 'raso' ke anusaar kam se kam chaar yutra hue the3⁄4 jinamein se teen main shahabuddin parajeet hua tha or bandi kiya gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj was captured and killed near Saraswati, after being defeated, while according to 'raso' he died by killing Shahabuddin in Ghazni as mentioned above
 ye anaitihaasik ullekh or vivaran 'prithvirajraso' ke samast roopon main paae jate hai or inamen se adhikartar uske taane bane ke hai, isaliye uske kisi bhi punarnimit rup main bhi paae jaanenge
 Therefore one has to believe that none of his forms can be a contemporary creation of Prithviraj
 prashn yah he ki 'raso' kis samay kii rachana maani ja saktaa he
 Some time later, the famous investigative scholar Muni Jinvijay found a copy of two 'jain Prabandha' collections in Jain Bhandars, comprising 'prithviraj Prabandha' and 'jaichand Prabandha'
 in prabandhon main jo chand uddhrut the unamem se kuch 'prithviraj raso' main bhi mili, yadhyapi in uddharanon kii bhashaa main 'raso' kii bhashaa kii apeksha pracheenta adhik surakshit thi
 In both the copies, 'prithviraj' management was often integral and one of the arrangements was copy no
 It was 1528
 inase munijee ne yah parinaam nikaala ki chand avashya hi prithviraj kaa samakaleen or uskaa raajakavi tha
 But this result will not be a logical conclusion
 in tathyon ke aadhaar par ham itnaa hi kah sakate hen ki chand ko rachana kaa koi na koi rup sanwat 1528 ke pehle praapt tha, jisase lekar ve chand ukt 'prithvirajprabandh' main uddhrut kiye gaye
 That form no
 In relation to how much pre-1528 would have been built, it can be said from some estimates, for which the following grounds can be taken: uddhrut chhandon main se ek 'raso' ke laghutam paath kii pratiyon main nahin miltaa he usamen kainvas ko 'vyas' or vashishtha kaha gaya he, jabaki 'raso' ke samast roopon main uske karnati daasi ke saath anuchit prem kii katha di gai he, jisase prakat he ki yah chand mul rachayita uparyukt aadharbhoot prabandhlekhak ko praapt thi, vah prakshipt tha; rachana kaa mul rup uske bhi purv kaa hona chahie
 If the above projected form of the composition is to be about 50 years after its original form, the original ancestral collections would have been prepared about 25 years after that and the copies received were about twenty five years after the preparation of both the above collections
 If it is original poetry no
 Around 1400 can be considered
 samay ke is anumaan main kahin par udaartaa nahin barti gai he, isaliye mul rachana kii tithi iske bahut baad nahin tal sakati he
 The form of the language of composition is found in the examples of arrangements and in the copies of the shortest forms of composition, it is also no
 Around 1400 is known, so the evidence of language also confirms the above result
 'prithvirajraso' vir ras kaa hindi kaa sarvshereshth kavy he
 a vivid imagination of heroic characters in Hindi literature was never seen later in this poem
 pathak rachana bhar main utsaah kii ek umadti hui sarita main bahata chalata he
 The pictures of Anurag and Viraha of Sanyogita before the Kannauj war and the union of Prithviraj Sankhyarita of the said war and the paintings of Kelli Vilas are very attractive
 anya rason kaa bhi kavy main abhaav nahin he
 The description of the composition is extraordinary; The narrator's description of the heroine's mating time provides beautiful examples of synthetic nature painting somewhere
 bhashastyli sarvatra prabhaavapurn he or varnya vishay ke anuroop kavy bhar main badalati rahati he
 If we look at all these qualities of the composition, then it is a beautiful epic and it is undoubtedly a typical work of the modern era of modern Indian Aryabha literature
