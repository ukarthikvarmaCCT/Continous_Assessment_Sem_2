 There the Greek and Iranian forces stood face to face for the final decision of power
 gaugamela kaa yuddh sansar ke nirnaayak yudhon main se he
 After the conquest of Egypt, it was almost evening when Alexander reached about three miles from Dara's camp in the field of Gaugamela
 parmenio ne sikandar ko sujhaayaa ki raat ke andhare hi main iraniyon par hamalaa kiya jaay kyonki din ke ujaale main irani sena kii gananaatit sankhya dekh, bahut sambhav he ki hamaari sena saham jaay
 Sinkadar tells him in the north that he does not steal the victory, fighting and making it possible
 sambhav he, jaisaa kuch itihaaskaaron ne kaha he, raat main sikandar kaa hamalaa na karne kaa kaaran vastut: yuddh kii vah takanic thi jiskaa upyog vah raat ke andhere main na kar paata
 Alexander visited the surrounding areas with a few horsemen in a few hours and formed an array of his army
 daahine or baayein baaju phaalanks ke ghudsavaron ke teen divijan jamaa die gaye
 Behind his avantage he raised the reserve of two attacking columns, one behind each of the two arms, so that if the enemy tried to break the rear arms, they could attack the enemy
 or yadi isaki aavashyaktaa na pade to ve ghumkar pradhan sena kii sahaayta karen
 In front of the horsemen on the right side he placed the archers and the Malladharis in front of the Iranian chariots
 greek itihaaskaaron ke anusaar sikandar kii sena main 7 hajaar ghudsavaar or 40 hajaar paidal the, jab ki iraniyon kii sena sankhya main isse paanchaguni thi
 Alexander saw the opportunity and attacked himself
 vah iraniyon ke baayein baaju par is tarah tutaa ki daara ko samtal chhod unchi nichi bhoomi par sarak janaa padaa
 When Dara saw that his chariots would become useless on high ground, he ordered the horsemen of the left arm to attack and stop Alexander's right arm
 donon ore ke ghudsavaaron main ghamaasan chhid gaya
 Now Dara extended the chariots, but they could never be put to proper use, and the Iranian chariots of the arrows of the Greek people began to hunt
 thik tabhi sikandar ghumkar chaar divijanon ke saath irani ghudsavaaron dwaara chodi jameen se hokar iraniyon ke baayein baaju par tutaa or swany daara kii ore badha
 The attack was so strong that Dara's feet were uprooted and he fled the field

 The rift between Alexander's army that had been created by his attacks, the Iranians and Indians rushed in and attacked the tents filled with Greeks
 tabhi daara ke daahine baaju ke ghudsavaaron ne sikandar ke baayein baaju ghumkar parmeniyon ke parshv par akraman kiya
 When the Parmen were badly engulfed, Alexander reported his terrible situation
 sikandar tab baayein baaju tuuti irani sena kaa peechha kar rahaa tha
 He suddenly returned with his cavalry and broke on the right side of the Iranians
 irani ghudsavaar ab bhaagane ke liye peeche laute par unke peeche kii raah jab is tarah ruk gai, tab ve saamne ke shatru se ghamaasan karne lage
 He neither sought refuge nor gave shelter to the enemy
 sikandar ne unhen kuchal diya or ek ek irani ghudsavaar maaraa gaya
 Alexander's army kept pursuing Dara till Arabella but could not catch him
 daara bhaag niklaa or usne bakhtri main jaakar sharan lee
 Arian writes that three lakh Iranians were killed when Alexander's total one thousand horsemen were killed
 prakat he ki is aankade par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This was the second war after the Battle of Issus in which Iran had to be defeated and after this war the Iranian Empire collapsed

 While giving a narrative touch on the way humans move towards disorganization by considering themselves as independent, and the state of various anomalies and irony arising from it, Tolstoy expresses the tentative idea of how the difficulty of astronomy assumes the motion of the Earth
 There was a direct feeling of stability and a refusal of similar sensations of planetary motion, Thus, it is difficult for history to believe that every person is subject to problems, periods and reasons, because in order to do so, he must deny the direct feeling of freedom of his personality
 parantu, jaisaa ki khagolashastra main nayaa drushtikon kahata tha : "sach he ki ham prithvi kii gati ko mahasoos nahin karte, par uski sthirataa ko maanakar ham anargalata par pahunchate hai, jabaki gati ko maanakar, jise ham mahasoos nahin karte, niyam pate hai", -- isi prakaar itihaas main bhi nayaa drushtikon kahata he : " yah sach he ki ham apni adheenta ko mahasoos nahin karte, par apni swatantraaa ko maanakar ham anargalata par pahunchate hai, jabaki bahya jagat, kaal or kaarnon par apni nirbharta ko maanakar ham niyam pate hai
 " pehle maamle main dik main astitvaheen sthirataa ke bodh se inkaar karke us gati ko maananaa tha jiskaa ham bodh nahin karte; or is maamle main -- thik isi tarah astitvaheen swatantraaa se inkaar kar ke us adheenta ko sweekaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jise ham mahasoos nahin karte

 'intaraashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan, jise adhiktar ISO kaha jaataa he, vibhinn rashtron ke maanak sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon se gathit ek anterrashtriya maanak-vinyas sanstha he
 It was established on February 23, 1947, to declare worldwide industrial and commercial standards
 iskaa mukhyalay geneva, switzraland main sthit he
 Although ISO calls itself an NGO, its ability to set standards, which often become law, either by agreements, or national values; This makes it more powerful than ngos
 vaise vyavhaar main yah ek sankaay yaa alpakaaleen sanghathan jaise karyrat he, jisaki sarkaron se majboot kaniyaan hai
 
 is sanghathan kaa logo yaa chihn do aadhikarik bhashaaon main he amareeki angreji evam french
 It also contains ISO characters, which it is often known as, which is its abbreviation
 balki yah sankshipti unani / greek shabd ἴσος se bana he, jiskaa arth he baraabar
 Assuming that the organization will have a different concatenation in different languages, it decided to run an all-encompassing universal name ISO
 yah swayan main is sanghathan kaa uddeshy siddh karata he
 The main products of ISO are international standards
 ISO dwaara hi prakashit hai : takneekee report, takneekee vishesheekaran, saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran, takneekee shuddhipatr, evam and pathpradarshak
 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included
 ASTM International ke sahyog se viksit maanakon main ASTM ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 The use of dates and iss is incompatible for incomplete or unpublished standards, and in some circumstances the title of a published work may also be omitted
 takneekee report jari hoti he, jab koi takneekee samiti yaa up-samiti ne saamanyatya prakashit anterrashtriya maanak se bhinn prakaar kaa koi aankana sangrahit kiya ho, jaise ki sandarbh yaa vyakhyaayein
 Their naming conventions are similar to the standards, only TR is applied instead of IS, before the report name
 udhaahrantah The technical specialization can be composed when "the subject concerned is still in development, or for some other reason there is a possibility of consent to publish an international standard in the future"
 saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran koi "madhyavarti vishesheekaran ho sakate hai, jo ki purna anterrashtriya maanak ke vikaas se purv hi prakashit hua ho", yaa, IEC main 'dwicihn' prakaashan, jo ki kisi bahari sanghathan ke sahyog se prakashit hua ho " donon ke hi namakaran takneekee report kii bhaanti hi kiya jaataa he
 For example ISO kabhi kabhi takneekee / paribhaashik shuddhipatr bhi jari karata he
 These are amendments to the current standards, which are made for petty technical / technical errors, usability improvements, or limited applicability
 praayah inhen is aashaa ke saath jari kiya jaat he ki prabhavit maanak yato uddhrut yaa waapas liya jayega, apane agle anusoochna panravlokan tak
 ISO guides are quasi-standard, with subjects related to international standardization

 vaise adhiktar ke mulya keval electronic roopakar main hi liye jate hai
 Although useful, but using these documents, it is worth noting that they are also likely to change in abundance, before it becomes a standard
 ISO evam iske aadhikarik sanyukt rajya pratinidhi evam anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog dwaara kuch maanak ni:shulk uplabdh karaae jate hai
 ISO has 157 national members, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO kii teen sadsyta shreniyan hai: Participating members are called "P" or p members, while the compliant members are called "O" or o members

 riyasaton se hue sahaayak sandhiyon ke tahat rajyon par british taj adhipaty tha or rajyon ke videshi maamalon or suraksha ke liye zimmedaar tha
 The treaty gave territorial autonomy to the rulers of the princely state, but this autonomy was only theoretical, in fact, the British had considerable influence and interference in the internal affairs of the princely states

 Similarly, world average wheat yield increased from 1 ton per hectare in 1900 to 2 in 1990
 5 ton prati hectare ho gai he
 The average wheat yield of South America with irrigation is about 2 tons per hectare, less than 1 ton per hectare of Africa, 3 of Egypt and Arabia

 Roundup ready seed contains a herbicide gene, which has been added to the plant's genome for its tolerance to glyphosate
 rounssop ek vyapaarik naam he jo glifoset aadhaarit utpaada ko diya gaya he, jo kritrim he or khar patavaar ko nasht karne ke liye kaam main liya jane vaala achayanit shaak vinashi he
 Roundup Ready Seed gives the farmer a crop that can be sprayed with glyphosate to destroy weeds and does not harm the resistant crop
 shaak vinashi-sahishnu fasalon ko duniya bhar ke kisaanon ke dwaara upyog kiya jaataa he
 Today, 92% of soybean in the US is grown with genetically modified herbicide-tolerant plants
 shaak vinashi-sahishnu fasalon ke badhate hue upyog ke saath, glifoset aadhaarit shaak vinashi chhidkav ke upyog main vruddhi hui he
 In some areas glyphosate anti-weeds have developed, due to which farmers have started using some other herbicide

 Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which contain a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that produces a specific toxin for insects; Pest-resistant crops protect plants from damage by pests, a similar crop is Starlink
 ek anya he beati kapaas, jo america kapaas kaa 63% bhaag banaati he
 Some believe that similar or better insect-resistant traits can also be achieved by traditional breeding methods, and that resistance to different pests can be achieved by hybridization or pollination with wild species

 Genetic engineers may someday develop transgenic plants that will be able to increase or sustain irrigation, drainage, conservation, sanitation engineering and production, and have less fossil fuel derived investment requirements than traditional crops
 aise vikaas vishesh rup se un kshetron main mahatvapurn honge jo saamanyatya shushk hote hai or nirantar sinchai par nirbhar rahete hai or bade paimaane ke kheton se yukt hote hai
 However, genetic engineering of plants has proved controversial
 khaadya suraksha or paryaavaran prabhaavon ke bare main GMO prathaon se sambandhit bahut se mudde utpann hue hai
 For example, some environmentalists and economists question GMO practices in relation to GMO practices such as terminator seeds
 jo ek anuvanshik sanshodhan he jo bandhya beej nirmit karata he
 At present, Terminator seed is being strongly opposed at the international level and constant efforts are being made to put a world-class ban on it
 ek or vivaadaaspad mudda he un companiyon ke liye patent sangrakshan jo anuvanshik abhiyantriki kaa upyog karte hue nae prakaar ke beej viksit karti hai
 Since companies have intellectual ownership of their seeds, they have the right to enforce the terms and conditions of their patented product
 vartmaan main, das beej companiyaan, puri duniya kii beej kii bikri ke do tihaai se adhik bhaag kaa niyantran karti hai
 Vandana Shiva argues that these companies are guilty of exploiting the organism for profit and bio-piracy by patents of life
 patent beej kaa upyog karne vaale kisaan agali fasal ke liye beej ko bachaa nahin sakate hai, jisase unhen har saal nae beej kharidne padate hai
 Since seed saving is a traditional practice for many farmers in both developed and developing countries, GMO seeds force farmers to change this practice of saving seeds and buy new seeds every year
 sthaneey anukulit beej bhi vartmaan sankarit bijon tathaa gmos kii tarah hi sakasham hote hai
 Locally adapted seeds, also called land species or crop ecological types, are important because over time they are adapted to the specific micro-environment of the area under cultivation, soil, other environmental conditions, area design and ethnic preference
 Go

 Once the transgenic material is added to the seed, it makes the seed company subject to conditions that have a patent for the transgenic material
 mudda yah bhi he ki gmos junglee prajatiyon ke saath par-paragan kar lete hai or mul aabaadi kii anuvanshikta ko sthaayee rup se badal dete hai; aise kai junglee paudhon kii pahchaan kii ja chuki he jinamein transgenic jin paae gaye hai
 The transfer of the GMO gene to the weed species is also a concern, which is also due to pollination with non-transgenic crops
 chunki kai GMO fasalon ko unke beej ke liye kaata jaataa he, jaise repasid, parivahan ke dauraan or punaravarti kheton main swayamsevi paudhon ke liye beej ke spillage kii samasya hoti he
 Food safety issues also coincide with food security and food labeling issues
 vartmaan main ek vishwa sandhi, di baio sefti protocol, gmos ke vyapaar ko niyantrit karti he
 Currently the EU requires all GMO foods to be labeled, while transparent labeling of GMO foods is not required in the US
 isliye GMO khaadya padaarthon se sambandhit jokhim or suraksha ke muddon par kai prashn hai, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki janata ko apane liye khaadya padaarth chunane kaa adhikaar hona chahie, use gyaan hona chahie ki vah kya kha rahi he or iske liye sabhi GMO utpaadon ko label kiya janaa jaruri he
 Agriculture imposes many external expenses on society through pesticides, nutrient leaks, excess water usage and other mixed problems
 britain main 2000 main krishi par kiye gaye ek akalan main pataa chalaa ki 1996 ke liye kul bahari laagat 2343 million british pound yaa 208 pound prati hectare thi
 a 2005 analysis in the United States concluded that cropland imposes approximately $ 5–16 billion, while livestock production imposes $ 714 million

 Pesticide use has increased since 1950, annually 2 worldwide
 5 million ton tak pahunch gaya he
 Nevertheless, crop damage due to pests remains relatively stable
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne 1992 main anumaan lagaaya ki salanaa 3 million kitnashak vishikaran hote hai, jinke kaaran 220,000 mautein hoti hai
 Pesticide selection for pesticide resistance in pest populations leads to a situation known as the 'pesticide treadmill', in which pesticide resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide

 The dependence on oil and the risk of America's food supply has triggered a conscious consumption movement, in which consumers count the "food miles" that a food product has fixed during the journey
 sthaayee krishi ke liye leopold centre ek khaadya mile ko nimnanusaar paribhaashit karata he:"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The journey of food from the place of growing to the place of purchase ultimately by the consumer or end user
 " Researchers at the Leopold Center found a comparison of locally grown and grown food at far-off locations found 44 to have local food reach their destination
 6 mile kii duuri tay kari hoti he or sudur sthanon par ugaaye jane vaale jahaajon se sthanantarit kiye jane vaale bhojan ko 1,546 mile kii duuri tay kari hoti he
 Consumers in the new local food movement who count food miles call themselves "locavores" links; He advocates a return to a locally based food system, in which food is grown as close as possible, whether it is organic or not
 lokavorce kaa tark he ki california main mul rup se ugaai jane vaali salad, jo jahaajon ke dwaara new yark laayi jaati he, abhi bhi asthaayee khaadya strot he kyonki yah apane sthaanantaran keliye jeevashm eendhan par nirbhar he
 In addition to the "locavores" movement, the issue of dependence on oil-based agriculture has led to further trends in home and community gardening

 Prakrit gas is used as its substitute when oil production is greatly reduced
 or parivahan main hydrogen kaa upyog bad jaataa he, prakritik gas adhik mahangi ho jaayegi
 If the Haber process cannot be commercialized using renewable energy, or if other sources of hydrogen are not available enough to replace the Haber process, enough to require transportation and agriculture, then fertilizer This main source will either become very expensive or not available
 yah yaa to bhojan kii kami laayegaa yaa khaadya keemton main naatakeey dhang se vruddhi kar degaa
 One effect of the shortage may be that agriculture returns to fully organic agriculture

 It has been suggested that rural communities can obtain fuel from biochar and sinfuel processes, using fuels and agricultural waste to provide food and charcoal fertilizers, rather than the usual food versus fuel database
 jab sinful kaa sait par upyog kiya jaayegaa, prakriya adhik prabhavi ho jaayegi or isse carbonic-krishi sangalan ke liye paryaapt eendhan uplabdh hogaagi
