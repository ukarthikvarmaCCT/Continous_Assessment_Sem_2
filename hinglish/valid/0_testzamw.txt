 The telescopic-looking cinematic scene in which two partially overlapped eight-figure shells do not occur in reality
 prijmon ko thoda hilaa dula kar galat sanrekhan ko aksar doorabeenon ko khole bina pech ghuma kar thik kiya jaataa he athwa aisa objective kii sthiti badal karke bhi karte hai, jiske liye objective kii sataha ke baahar vikendrit chudiyaan hoti hai
 Alignment is usually done by a professional, although instructions for identifying and aligning alignment errors are also found on the Internet
 kisi saadhaaran doorabeen main 6 se 10 prakaashiya tatva prayukt hote hai jinka vishisht prayog hota he, tathaa kaanch se hawa ke sampark vaali satahen 16 tak ho sakati hai, isliye doorabeen nirmaataaon ko takneekee kaarnon se vibhinn prakaar kii optical coating kaa prayog karnaa hota he jisase upkaran se praapt chhavi kii gunvattta badhaai ja sake
 The loss of light due to reflection on each surface is minimized by anti-reflective coating
 anti-recolactive coating ke madhyam se doorabeen ke andar "lupt" prakaash, jo ki praapt chhavi ko dhundhala bana saktaa he, ko kam kiya jaataa he
 An 8x40 telescope with good optical coating can produce a better and brighter image than an 8x50 telescope without a coating
 ek paaramparik lens coating saamagree magnesium fluoride he jo paravartan ko 5% se 1% tak kam kar detaa he
 Modern lens coatings consist of complex multi-layers and reflect only 0
25% or less, as well as give a good image with maximum brightness and natural colors
 ruf prism vaali doorabeenon main prakaash do raaston main vibhajit ho jaataa he jo ruf prism kii peeth ke kisi bhi taraf se paravartit hota he
 Half the light is reflected from surface 1 to surface 2 of the roof
 prakaash kaa bachaa hua aadha hissaa sataha 2 se sataha 1 par paravartit hota he
 This causes the light to partially polarize
 Its polarization vector changes with the changes occurring next to it but it changes like the Foucault pendulum in each path
 alag alag pathon par ja rahaa prakaash jab miltaa he, tab prayek path ke polaraise sadish mail nahin khate hai
 The angle between polarized vectors is called phase shift or geometric phase or berry phase
 bhinn jyamitiya fez vaale alag pathon ke takaraane par chhavi main ghatati-badhati tivrata kaa vitaran praapt hota he, jisase praapt hone vaala contrast va rizolution poro prism pranali ke mukaable kam ho jaataa he
 To reduce these unwanted interference effects on the roof surface of a roof prism, certain special electrolyte coating materials are vaporized, these substances are called phase-correction coating or P-coating
 yah coating do pathon ke bich jyamitiya fez main antar ko thik karke donon pathon se aa rahe prakaash ko ek hi fez main parivartit karti he jisase takaraav ke kaaran chhavi karaab nahin hone paati he
 Telescopes using schmidt-pechen Roof Prism or abbey-könig Roof Prism particularly benefit from the phase coating
 poro prism aadhaarit doorabine alag alag path se aa rahi prakaash kirnon ko punah ekatrit nahin karatin atah inhen fez coating se koi vishesh laabh nahin hota
 Telescopes using schmidt-pechen Roof Prism mirror coat the surfaces of the roof prism so that the light falling on one of its surfaces is less than the marginal angle, so that its total internal reflection does not occur
 Without mirror coating most of the light will be damaged
 schmidt-pechen Roof Prism uses aluminum mirror coating or silver mirror coating
 puraane dizin main rajat darpan coating kii jaati thi parantu sil na kii gayi doorabeenon main iskaa oxikaran ho jaataa tha tathaa ye paravartaneeyata kho detii thim
 Later aluminum mirror coating was used in unsealed designs as it does not tarnish, although it gives lower reflectivity than silver
 aadhunik dizin yaa to aluminium yaa chaandi kaa upyog karte hai
 Silver is used in modern high quality designs, filled with nitrogen or argon and sealed so that the silver mirror coating never tarnishes
 poro prism tathaa ruf prism vaali doorabine jo ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog karti hai, inako darpan coating kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa kyonki ye prism 100% paravartaneeyata sampoorn aatanrik paravartan se praapt kar lete hai
 Die-electric mirror coating is used to produce the effect of die-electric mirrors in schmidt-pechen Roof Prism
 saanchaa:jargon adhatvik daai-electric darpan coating ko banane ke liye ruf prism kii paravartaneey sataha par ekaantarit rup se ucch tathaa nimna apvartan suchakank vaale tatwon ko nickshepit kiya jaataa he
 Each single multilayer light reflects a thin frequency beam so many layers, so multiple multilayer light adjusted to different colors is needed to reflect white light
 yah bahuparat coating prism kii sataha par vitarit brag parivartak kii tarah kaary karte hue paravartaneeyata ko badha detii he
 a well-designed die-electric coating provides more than 99% reflectivity in the visible light spectrum
 yah paravartaneeyata aluminium darpan coating athwa rajat darpan coating se kahin behatar he
 Telescopes with poro prisms and roof prisms that use the abbe-könig roof prism do not have to use a die-electric coating because these prisms achieve very high reflectivity using complete internal reflection
 kisi coating kii upasthiti ko aamtaur par nimnlikhit shabdon dwaara doorabeen par chihnit kiya jaataa he: Handheld binoculars range from 3X10 opera glass used in theater to 7 to 12 m diameter magnification and 30 to 50 mm objective lenses
 kai paryatak sthalon par sikaa-chaalit doorabeen, stand par lagi hoti hai, jisaki sahaayta se ve us paryaton-aakarshan ko nikat se dekh pate hai
 In the UK, 20 pence usually allows two minutes of viewing with a telescope, while in the United States one or two quarters are allowed for one and a half to two and a half minutes
 kai doorabeenon main range khojane ke liye retical drishy kshetra main hi dikhataa he
 This scale helps in estimating the distance of the object being viewed when the height is known
 navikon kii saadhaaran 7X50 doorabeen main paimaane ke chinhon ke bich kii duuri lagbhag 5 mil ko vyakt karti he
 a mill, when viewed from a distance of 1000 meters, is called the angle formed between the top and base of a meter high object
 is prakaar ek gyaat oonchai par sthit vastu se duuri kaa anumaan lagane ke liye sameekaran is prakaar hoga: where: ek saadhaaran 5 mil paimaane par, ek prakaash-stambh jo ki 3 chinh ooncha dikh rahaa ho, vastav main 120 meter ooncha tathaa 8000 meter dur hoga
 The military use of binoculars has a long history
 19veen sadi ke ant tak gallilian dizin vyapak rup se prayog main tha tathaa uske pashchaat poro prism dizine kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 Telescopes designed for general military use are made much stronger than their civilian counterparts
 sainya upyog main najuk kendriya focus ke sthaan par swatantra focus kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, isse doorabeen ko vaataavaran ke lihaaz se abhedya banane main aasaani hoti he tathaa prabhaavshaalee vaataavaran anukulan pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 The prisms of military binoculars are coated with an additional aluminum coating so that they are not degradable even when drenched
 doorabeen kaa ek or prayukt rup "trench doorabeen" hota he jo darasal doorabeen va periscope kaa mishran hota he, iskaa prayog topakhane kaa pataa lagane main kiya jaataa he, iskaa prayog karte samay sainik apana sar munder ke neech rakhte hue dekh saktaa he, jisase use suraksha praapt hoti he
 Military telescopes of the Cold War period were often fitted with passive sensors to make them visible to active infrared emissions, while modern telescopes have performers that prevent them from using laser rays as weapons
 iske atirikt sainya prayog ke liye dizine doorabeenon main range kaa anumaan lagaaye jane hetu stediametric ritical bhi hoti he
 Separate telescopes are available for military and civilian uses for use at sea
 haath main pakad kar prayog kii ja sakane vaali doorabine 5X athwa 7X hoti hai parantu inamen kaaphi bade prism ke saath hi aise ipis hote hai jo ankhon ko kaaphi aaraam pradaan karte hai
 This optical combination prevents the telescope from blurring or obscuring the image when it is vibrated relative to the eye
 bade, ucch aavardhan vaale model jinamein bade objective lens hote hai, unhen stand par laga ke prayog karne yogya banaaya jaataa he
 Very large naval range-finder telescopes have been used, but the technology of the late 20th century made their application unnecessary
 doorabeenon kaa prayog shaukia khagol-shastriyon dwaara vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he; unka vistrut drishy kshetra dhoomaketu tathaa supernova dekhne waalon ke liye tathaa saamaanya avlokan ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi banaata he
 Some telescopes of 70 mm and larger range are suitable for Earth observation; In the design of real astronomical telescopes, prisms are used to accurately display the image by increasing light transmittance
 aisi doorabeenon main badalane yogya ipis hote hai jinase aavardhan ko badhaaya yaa kam kiya ja saktaa he tathaa inkaa dizine jal-rodhi athwa visham prayog ke liye nahin hota he
 Ceres, Neptune, Pallas, Titan, and Jupiter's Galilean moon, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, can be easily seen with the help of binoculars
 haalanki pradooshan rahit akaash main bina kisi sahaayta ke dekhe ja sakane vaale urenus tathaa vesta ko doorabeen kii sahaayta se sahajata se dekha ja saktaa he
 The 10X15 binoculars are limited to a value of +10 to +11 and also depends on the position of the sky and the experience of the observer
 saamanyatya uplabdh doorabeenon se grahikaayen jaise ki interemnia, davida, europa tathaa asaadhaaran paristhitiyaan hone par haijia, badi mushkil se nazar aati hai
 Similarly, except for Galilean and Titan, the moons of the planets and the dwarf planets Pluto and Iris are barely visible with most telescopes
 gahare akaash kii vastuon main khule samooh bhavy dikhte hai, jaise ki parasyus taramandal main brit dabl cluster, tathaa golakaar samooh, jaise harculis kaa em13, badi saralata se dekhe ja sakate hai
 Among the nebulae, the M17 in Sagittaria and the North American nebula NGC 7000 in Cygnus can also be easily seen
 kam prakaash tathaa khagoleey darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn tathy aavardhan shakti tathaa optical lens ke vyas kaa anupaat he
 At low magnification, the field of vision is enlarged, making it easy to see deep celestial objects, such as the sky, the Ganges, the impractical, and the star clusters, although the light from the large exit pupil is not fully seen by the aged investigator because 50 years Eyes older than 4 rarely spread more than 5 mm
 bada exit pupil se raatri main akaash kii prishthbhumi main vaishamy kam ho jane ke kaaran dhundhlee vastuon ko pahchaanana kathin ho jaataa he, un kshetron ko chhod kar jahaan prakaashiya pradooshan naganya ho
 Telescopes designed for astronomical use show a very satisfactory view with large aperture objective
 Astronomical telescopes are usually of magnification of 12
5 and above
 haalanki, mesier katalog ke athwa aathven pariman tathaa usase zyada kii khagoleey vastuein 30 se 40 mimi range kii, haath main pakad ke prayog karne yogya gharelu doorabeenon se badi aasaani se dekhi ja sakati hai
 However, for astronomical use, only large objective telescopes are good because blurred objects are also easily visible due to the high amount of light received from them
 unke ucch aavardhan or baari vajan ke kaaran, in doorabeenon ko sthir chhavi dekhne hetu stand par laga kar prayog karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Typically binoculars up to ten magnification can be used by holding them in hand, there is no need to place them in a stand
 Much larger telescopes are made by amateur telescope makers than two astronomical telescopes, refraction or reflection

 These include: vidyut evam electranik kaary ke liye bahut se upkaran lagate hai jo maapan, jaanch, signal paidaa karne, signal kaa swaroop dekhne aadi ke kaam aate hai
 The following items are used for basic measurement of voltages, currents, and components in the circuit under test
 nimnlikhit upkarnon kaa prayog jaanch kiye ja rahe paripathon ko input dene ke liye kiya jaataa he- The following analyze the response of the circuit under test: And connecting it all together: Diagnosing the root cause of any problem starting with external symptoms is called diagnosis
 nidaan kii vidhi 'vilopan' par aadhaarit he
 The term diagnosis is used in all fields: in therapeutics, science, technology, justice, business, and management etc
 nidaan kaa bahut mahatv he
 Until the disease is accurately diagnosed, treatment in the right direction is impossible
 isliye puraane ayurveda granthon main nidaan adhyay bahut vrihad hota tha or upachaar adhyay simit
 The reason is that if the diagnosis were accurate then the treatment would also be accurate
 yah sahi he ki anek rog swayamev achche ho jate hai or prakruti kii nivarak shakti ko kisi kii sahaayta kii apeksha nahin hoti, parantu anek rog aise bhi hote hai jinamein prakruti asamarth ho jaati he or tab chikitsa dwaara sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Accurate and accurate therapy requires that the diagnosis be correct

 People who have had special experience and study of this discipline have become a different category
 armbh main rog kaa kaaran daivi prakope, pretbadha yaa kudrushti samajha jaataa tha or ilaaj tha- jaadu, tona, jantar-mantar aadi
 Later Ayurveda emerged and was diagnosed based on the Tridosha theory
 yahi siddhaat pashchim main jaakar 'chaturdosh siddhanth' ban gaya
 When modern science began to emerge, many new theories began to appear: ungodly environment, impurities, poisons, viruses, etc
, but all of them were half-truths

 All these methods are based on different principles, so they should not be compared
 aadhunik nidaan ke chaar charan hote hai : Problem, tathyasangrah : Discussion and nirnay To find out why the patient has come to the doctor, his question is - what is the problem? If the patient is conscious, then he talks about painful symptoms, if he is unconscious, then the people accompanying him will tell
 ye lakshan kab se hai or kaise aarambh hue, yah poocha jaataa he
 Thus, the doctor understands the form of the problem, what has happened to this patient, for three days, there is severe pain in the head and before that there was no problem

 Other scientists prefer to use the term "gelatinous zooplankton" when referring to them, with soft-bodied animals in the water column
 jelifish ke samooh ko kabhi-kabhi bloom yaa jhund bhi kaha jaataa he
 "bloom" is generally used for large groups of jellyfish that congregate in a small area, but may also include the time component, which is seasonal or greater than expected

 The global increase in jellyfish eruption frequency can be caused by human impact
 kuch sthanon par jelifish paristhitik aalon ko bhar sakate hai jis par pehle ab adhik machhliimaar jeevon kaa kabja tha, lekin note kiya gaya he ki is pariklpana main samarthak data kii kami he
 Jellyfish researcher Marsha Youngbluth further clarifies that "jellyfish nourish the same types of young and adult fish, so if the fish are removed from the equation, the jellyfish is likely to take place
" " Some jellyfish populations, which have shown a clear increase over the past few decades, are of other "invasive" species coming from natural habitats: examples include the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, the eastern Mediterranean beaches of Egypt and Israel, and Mexico
 American coast of the Gulf of
 Invasive species populations can expand rapidly as there are often no natural predators present in new habitats to prevent their growth

 In the second stage, small polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as medusa
 chote jelifish polip se dur tair kar jate hai or phir plavak par badhate or poshit hote hai
 The medusa has a spherically symmetrical, umbrella-shaped body called a bell, usually consisting of small tentacles, such as bordered tentacles, on the side of the bell that hold the prey
 jelifish kii kuch prajatiyon ke jivan chakra main polip bhaag nahin hota he, lekin ve jelifish se nishechit andon ke sidhe vikaas ke madhyam se jelifish kii agali peedi main jate hai

 In 1961, Osamu Shimomura of Princeton University, while studying the photoproteins that were the cause of the biopolarity by this species of jellyfish, extracted the green fluorescent protein from the large and abundant Hydromedusa equorea victoria and another bioremediated protein called equorin
 Three decades later, Douglas Prasher, a post-doctoral scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP
 sheeghra hi colombia vishvavidhyalay ke martin chelfi ne pataa lagaaya ki kaise GFP ko anya koshikaon yaa angon main jin ke fluoroscent marker ke rup main sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Roger Sian of the University of California, San Diego later chemically manipulated GFP to acquire other fluorescence colors to be used as markers
 In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfi and Sian won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP
 maanav nirmit GFP kaa ab saamanytah pradipt tag yah darshane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he ki koun-si koshikaayen yaa utak vishisht jeenon ko vyakt karte hai
 Genetic engineering techniques combine the preferred genes with the GFP gene

 When a nematocyst is induced by contact with a predator or prey, it quickly pressures up to 2,000 lbs / square inch until it explodes
 a lance inside the nematocyst pierces the skin of the prey and begins to poison the inside of the prey
 jelifish ko choona yaa uske dwaara chuaa janaa bahut hi asahaj ho saktaa he, kabhi-kabhi jiske liye chikitsa sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; dank kaa prabhaav, bina koi prabhaav se lekar atyadhik dard or maut tak ho saktaa he
 Due to the wide variation in response to jellyfish stings, it is prudent not to come into contact with jellyfish from exposed skin
 yahaan tak ki samudratati or marane vaala jelifish bhi chhue jane par dank maar saktaa he
 Scyphozoi jellyfish stings are often inconvenient, although not generally fatal, but some species of class Cubozoa, such as the well-known and particularly virulent Irukandji, or box jellyfish can be fatal
 dank kii vajah se tivrograhita ho sakati he, jo maut kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 Therefore, the victims must immediately run out of water
 chikitsa dekharekh main vishrodhi khuraaq bhi shaamil he
 Three goals of first aid for non-complicated jellyfish stings are protection from injury to rescuers, neutralizing nematocysts, and removal of patient-associated tentacles
 Rescuers should wear restrictive clothing, such as panty hoods, wet suits or full-body sting-impermeable suits
 Inactivating nematocysts or sting cells and prevents toxin ingestion
 sirka se box jelifish dank main madad milti he, lekin portugali yoddha dankon se nahin
 For stings on or around the eyes, soak a towel in vinegar and dab it around the eyes, but avoid the eyes
 If vinegar is unavailable, salt water can also be used
 yadi namakeen pani main dank laga ho to tazaa pani kaa istemaal naa karen, kyonki tanaatmak parivartan atirikt vish chhod saktaa he
 Avoid rubbing the wound or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine that encourage the release of venom
 jagah se jelly, sparshak or nami saafe karne se, nimatocist uttejnaa or bhi kam ho jaati he
 Shaving the affected skin with a knife edge, razor or credit card can also remove the remaining nematocysts
 praathmik chikitsa-sahaayta ke alaava, difinhydermine jaise histaminarodhi twachaa kii jalan ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 To remove the toxin in the skin, apply baking soda and water to the sting and cover it with a cloth
 If possible, apply the coat again every 15-20 minutes
 Up to the achievement of any one of these snow can prevent the poison from spreading

 So he passed in 1920, securing fourth place in the preference list
 iske baad subhash ne apane bade bhai sharathchandra bose ko patr likhakar unki raay janani chaahi ki unke dilo-dimag par to swami vivekananda or maharishi aravind ghosh ke aadarshon ne kabja kar rakkha he aise main isies banakar vah angrejon kii gulaami kaise kar paayenge? 22 april 1921 ko bharat sachiv i0es0 montague ko isies se tyaagptr dene kaa patr likhaa

 From England, he wrote a letter to Dasababu and expressed his desire to work with him
 rabindranath thakur kii salaah ke anusaar bharat waapas aane par ve sarvapratham mumbai gayi or mahatma gandhi se mili
 Gandhi lived in Mani Bhavan in Mumbai
 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe
 san 1934 main jab subhash austria main apana ilaaj karaane hetu tehre hue the us samay unhen apni pustak likhane hetu ek angreji jaanane vaale typist kii aavashyaktaa hui
 a friend of his met an Austrian woman named Emily Shankel

 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose
 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Anita is still alive
 uskaa naam anita bose phalf he
 Anita Faf sometimes comes to India to meet her father's family
 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government
 parantu rajya sarkaar ne ise hastkshep ke yogya na maanate hue maamle kii file hi band kar di
 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi
 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous
 unki aatmakatha yadhyapi apurna hi rahi, lekin use purna karne kii unki abhilaashaa rahi thi, jiskaa pataa mul pandulipi ke pratham prishth par banaayi gayi yojana se spasht roopen chalata he
 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
