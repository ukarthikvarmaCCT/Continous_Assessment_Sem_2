 unke pita adityadas surya bhagwaan ke bhakt the
 He taught astrology to Mihir
 kusumpur jane par yuva mihir mahaan khagolgy or ganitagya aryabhatta se mili
 This inspired him so much that he made astrology and astronomy the goal of his life
 us samay ujjain vidya kaa centre tha
 Many centers of art, science and culture were flourishing there under the Gupta rule
 mihir is shahar main rahane ke liye aa gayi kyonki anya sthanon ke vidwaan bhi yahaan ekatra hote rahete the
 When the time came, his astrological knowledge came to know about Vikramaditya Chandragupta II
 raja ne unhen apane darbar ke navratnon main shaamil kar liya
 Mihir traveled to distant countries, even to Greece

 Around 550 AD, he wrote three important books Brihajatakata, Brihatsamhita and Panchasiddhantika
 in pustakon main trikonmiti ke mahatvapurn sutara die hue hai, jo varahamihir ke trikonmiti gyaan ke parichaayak hai
 The Panchasiddhantika describes the five principles prevalent before Varahamihira
 ye siddhant hai : polishsiddhant, romakasiddhant, vasishthasiddhant, suryasiddhant tathaa pitamahasiddhant
 Varahamihira has also written the important things of these pre-eminent principles and directed a rite called 'beej' on his behalf, so that planets enumerated by these principles can be seen
 inhone falit jyotish ke laghujatak, brihajjatak tathaa brihatsamhita naamak teen granth bhi likhe hai
 Brihatsamhita includes topics like architecture, building construction art, the nature of the atmosphere, Vrikshayurveda etc
 apni pustak ke bare main varahamihir kehete he: It was not bland
 is pustak ko ab bhi granthratn samajha jaataa he
 Barahamihira was a scholar of the Vedas but did not believe in the supernatural with his eyes closed
 unki bhaavana or manovriti ek vaigyanik kii thi

 He also wrote a lot
 sanskrit vyakaran main dakshata or chand par adhikaar ke kaaran unhone swayan ko ek anokhi style main vyakt kiya tha
 Due to his vivid knowledge and succulent presentation, he has also made dry subjects like astronomy interesting which earned him much fame
 unki pustak panchasiddhantika, brihatsamhita, brihajjathak ne unhen falit jyotish main vahi sthaan dilaayaa he jo raajnneeti darshan main kautilya kaa, vyakaran main panini kaa or vidhaan main manu kaa he
 The following trigonometric formulas have been proposed by Varahamihira
 varahamihir ne aryabhatta pratham dwaara pratipaadit jya sarini ko or adhik parishuddht banaaya
 Varahamihira defined the algebraic properties of zero and negative numbers
 varahamihir 'sankhya-siddhanth' naamak ek ganit granth ke bhi rachayita hai jiske bare main bahut kam gyaat he
 There is no complete information about this book because only a small fraction of it has been found
 praapt granth ke bare main puraavidon kaa kathan he ki isamen unnat ankaganit, trikonmiti ke saath-saath kuch apekshaakrit saral sankalpanaaon kaa bhi samavesh he
 Varahamihira discovered the famous numbers known as Pascal Triangle at the present time

 Varahamihira also contributes to optics
 unhone kaha he ki paravartan kanon ke prati-prakirnan se hota he
 He has also explained refraction

 ganit main kisi vaastavik sankhya kaa nirpeksh maan yaa 'nirpeksh mulya' yaa 'mapank' |a| us sankhya ke chihn ke bina uske aankik maan ke baraabar hota he
 For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3
 kisi sankhya ke nirpeksh maan ko us sankhya kii shunya se duuri ke baraabar samajha ja saktaa he
 The above definition of absolute value for real numbers has been generalized to many other mathematical areas
 udhaaharan ke liye samishra sankhyaon ke liye bhi nirpeksh maan paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 In addition, absolute values are also defined for quaternions, ordered rings, fields, and vector holidays
 vaastavik sankhya a kaa nirpeksh maan | a | nirupit kiya jaataa he
 And its definition is as follows: is paribhaasha se spasht he ki kisi bhi raashi kaa nirpeksh maan yaa to dhanatmak hoga yaa shunya hoga ; yah rinatmak kabhi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Since the square root without the sign indicates the positive square root of that amount; This means that- yahi kabhi-kabhi nirpeksh maan kii paribhaasha ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties: nirpeksh maan ke anya mahatvapoornn gun nimnlikhit hai- If b> 0, then two other useful properties related to inequalities are: uparokya sambandhon kaa prayog un asamtaaon kaa hal nikaalane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jinamein nirpeksh maan kaa prayog hua ho
 for example, kisi samishra sankhya, Where x and y are real numbers, the modulus of z | z | Is displayed by
 isko nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit karte hai- The modulus of the complex number has all the properties mentioned above that are in the modulus of the real number
 yadi, Be and z kaa samishra yugma ho to, And z ke mapank kaa varg nimnlikhit he- 2721 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2721 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he

 Tannenbom - The Trovalds Dialogue was a debate between Andrew Tannenbom and Linus Trovalds
 yah bahes linaks or karnal architekchar ke bare main tha
 Tuttenbom started this debate in 1992 in Usenet's discussion group comp
os
minix
 unhone yah tark diya kii microkarnal monolithik karnal se behatar hai isliye us samay 1992 main bhi linaks obsolit hai
 Other well-known hackers who participated in the debate were David S
 Miller and Theodore Tso
 yah bahes main pehle to sirf karnal dizine ko lekar maamuli baaten ho rahi thi
 But as the debate progressed, more detailed and complex things started happening
 karnal dizine ke saath saath yah bahes duusare vishyo par bhi chali gayi, jaise kaunsa microprocesar architekchar bhavishya main dusro se aage rahegaa vagairah
 Many others involved in this conversation with Tannenbom and Trovalds were Peter macdonald and David S
 Miller and Theodore Tso, a North American Linux Colonel developer
 is bahes ko pehali baar 29 ,janvari ,1992 ko record kiya gaya jab tannenbom ne comp
minix
os main linaks karnal kii aalochana karte hue ek post kiya tha
 In it, he wrote that how monolithic Linux kernels harm its capabilities
 is post kaa sheershak unhone linaks is obsolit rakhaa tha
 In the beginning of the debate, he did not go into the technical details, he said that he feels that microcernal designs are better than monolithic kernels
 iskaa kaaran unhone portability bataaya, or yah bhi kaha kii linaks karnal x86 processors se kuch zyaada hi judaa hua hai
 He did not find the future of x86 processors to be bright
 apane tark ko rakhane ke liye unhone yahan tak kaha kii, 1991 main monolithik karnal likhnaa " ek bada kadam peeche hai -- 1970 ke dashak ke taraf "
 This criticism was posted in a public newsgroup so Linus could give a direct answer to it
 agle din linas ne yahi kiya, linas ne tark diya kii MINIX ke dizine main kuch andharuni khamia hai isliye tannenbom ko unke koshisho par aapatti nahin honi chahie
 Linus then explained how he specifically designed the Linux Intel 80386 processor and was also a part of Trowald's exercise
 trowalds ne yah kaha kii aisa karne se linaks karnal MINIX se kam portable ho gaya hai
 Linus claimed that this was an acceptable design principle as it made the application programming interface more simple and portable
 isliye trowalds ne yah bhi kaha kii " linaks minix se zyaada portable hai"
 Following Linus' reply, Tannenbom argued that as a professor he had to put some boundaries in MINIX
 MINIX ko unhen ek saadhaaran student ke paas uplabdh hardware ke anusaar bananaa tha, jo kii us samay INTEL 8088 procesar vaala computer tha
 These computers sometimes did not even have a hard drive
 us samay linaks khaskar INTEL 80386 procesar vaale computer ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 This processor was more powerful
 tannenbom ne yah bhi likhaa " ek saal pehle tak minix ke do varshan the ek PC ke liye or ek INTEL 286 / 386 procesar ke liye
 PC version was selling twice as much as 286 / 386 "
 tannenbom ne yah bhi likhaa kii linaks free software zarur tha, lekin zyaadaatar vidhyaarthee iskaa upyog nahin kar paaenge kyunki ve ise istemaal karne ke liye zyaada mahangaa hardware nahin kharid paaenge or minix "ek regular 4
77 mhz procesar vaale bina hard drive ke mashin par bhi istemaal kii ja sakati hai "
 To this, another USENET user Kevin Brown responded to Tannenbom that Linux being associated with the 386 architecture was the designer's choice not to have knowledge of the operating system
 unhone likhaa tha " linaks ke dizine kaa ek lakshya tha kii 386 procesar ke visheshtaon kaa phayda uthaanaa tha
 So what do you want to say? Different design goals will give you different designs "
 brown ne yah bhi kaha kii saste hardware ke liye vishist system dizine bananaa bhavishya main us system kii portability mushkil banaati hai
 Although Minix did not support the new hardware, Tannenbom argued that the x86 architecture would be overtaken by other architectures in the future, so they did not need to do anything about it
 tannenbom ne kaha " 5 saal baad paristhiti alag hogi sab apane 200 MIPS ,64 sparcstation 5 par free GNU oparating system istemaal kar rahe honge

 lui braille france ke shikshavid tathaa anveshak the jinhone andhon ke liye likhane tathaa padhane kii pranali viksit kii
 This method is known as 'braille'
 france main janme lui braille andhon ke liye gyaan ke chakshu ban gaye
 Louis Swayam, who eased the reading difficulty of the blind with the creation of Braille script, was also blind
 louis braille kaa janm 4 janvari 1809 main france ke chote se gram kupre main ek madhyam vargeey parivaar main hua tha
 His father Simon Rayle Braille used to make saddles and jean for royal horses
 paariwarik aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop paryaapt aarthik sansaadhan nahin hone ke kaaran simon ke atirikt mehnat kerani hoti thi isiliye jab balak louis maatr teen varsh ke huye to unke pita ne use bhi apane saath ghodon ke liye lathi or jin banane ke kaary main laga liya
 In keeping with his temperament, the three-year-old boy spent his time playing with the items available around him, so the items of play of the child Louis were the same as those used by his father in his work such as hard wood, rope, iron pieces, Horseshoe, knife and handy iron tools
 kisi teen varshiya balak kaa apane najadik uplabdh vastuon ke saath khelnaa or sharaarton main lipt rahanaa nitant swaabhaavik bhi tha
 One day, a knife used to cut wood for a saddle suddenly bounced into this little boy's eye and blood flowed from the child's eye
 rota hua balak apni aankh ko haath se dabaakar sidhe ghar aayaa or ghar main saadhaaran jadi lagaakar uski aankh par pattee kar di gayi
 Perhaps it would have been assumed that the injury would be cured automatically soon
 balak louis kii aankh ke thik hone kii pratiksha kii jane lagi
 a few days later, the boy Louis complained of appearing less than his other eye, but it must have been the inferiority of his father Simon, or the negligence that caused the eye of the child could not be properly treated and slowly the little boy was eight years old
 By the time the vision was completely lost
 rang birange sansar ke sthaan par us balak ke liye sab kuch gahan andhkaar main dub gaya
 Louis, keen in his father's leather industry, lost his eyes in an accident
 yah durghatana lui ke pita kii kaaryshaala main ghati
 Where at the age of three, an iron swab entered Louis's eye
 yah balak koi sadhran balak nahin tha
 He had a strong will to fight the world
 usne haar nahin maani or forns ke mashhoor padri belantin kii sharan main ja pahunchaa
 Due to the efforts of Pastor Bainantine, in 1819, this ten-year-old boy was admitted to the Royal Institute for the Blinds
 yah varsh 1821 tha
 The boy Louis was twelve years old by now
 isi dauraan vidhyalay main balak louis ke pataa chalaa ki shahi sena ke sevanivruth capten charlas barbar ne sena ke liye aisi kutalipi kaa vikaas kiya he jisaki sahaayta se ve tatolkar andhere main bhi sandeshon ke padh sakate the
 The purpose of Captain Charles Barber was to reduce the difficulties faced by soldiers during the war
 balak louis kaa mashtishk sainikon ke dwaara tatolkar padhi ja sakane vaali kutalipi main drushthiheen vyaktiyo ke liye padhne kii sambhaavna dhund rahaa tha
 He expressed to Pastor Balentine that he wanted to meet Captain Charles Barber
 padri ne louis kii capten se mulaakaat kii vyavastha karaayi
 During his meeting, the child proposed some modifications to the couplet suggested by Captain
 capten charlas barbar us andhe balak kaa aatmavishvash dekhakar dang rah gayi
 He finally accepted the amendments made by this disciple of Pastor Balentine
 kaalaantar main swayan louis braille ne aath varsho ke athak parishram se is lipi main anek sanshodhan kiye or antat 1829 main chah binduo par aadhaarit aisi lipi banane main safal huye
 The confidence of Louis Braille was yet to be tested, so the script invented by him was not recognized and mocked by the then academics
 sena ke sevanivruth capten charlas barbar ke naam kaa saaya lagaataar is lipi par mandaraata rahaa or sena ke dwaara upyog main laaye jane ke kaaran is lipi ke sena kii kutalipi hi samajha gaya parantu louis braille ne haar nahin maani or padri belantin ke samvednaatmak aarthik evam maansik sahyog se is shishy ne apni avishkrut lipi ko drushthi hin vyaktiyon ke madhya lagaataar prachaarit kiya
 He prayed to the government to recognize it as the language of the visually impaired
 yah louis kaa durbhaagya rahaa ki unke prayaason ko safalataa nahin mil saki or tatkaaleen shikshashashtriyon dwaara ise bhashaa ke rup main manyata diye jane yogya nahin samajha gaya
 Convinced by his efforts to gain social and constitutional recognition, Louis finally lost his life in 1852 at the age of 43, but his courage did not die even after his death
 unka dehant 6 janvari 1852 ko hua
 The script, based on the six points invented by Louis Braille, became increasingly popular with the visually impaired after his death
 louis kii mrityu kii ghatana ke baad shikshashashtriyon dwaara unke kiye gayi kaary kii gambheertha ko samajha jane laga or drushthihinon ke madhya lagaataar manyata paati ja rahi lipi ke prati apane purvagrahpurn dakiyanoosee vichaaron se baahar nikalaten huye ise manyata pradaan karne kii disha main vichaarit kiya gaya
 Eventually, on June 20, 1952, his day of honor was set in France, a full hundred years after Louis's death
 is din unke grah gram kupre main sau varsh purv dafnaye gayi unke parthiv sharir ke avshesh puure rajkeey sammaan ke saath baahar nikaale gayi
 Like that day he was reborn in the village of Cuppre, Louis
 sthaneey prashasan tathaa sena ke aalaa adhikari jinke purvajon ne louis ke jivan kaal main unke lagaataar upekshit kiya tathaa drushthihinon ke liye unki lipi ko gambheertha se na lekar uskaa makhul udaaya apane purvajon ke dwaara kii gayi galati kii maafee maangane ke liye unki samadhi ke chaaron ore ikattha huye
 The remains of Louis's body were honorably removed

 The national tune was played and after all this, according to the instructions given by the bishops, Luis was prayed to regain sleep in honor and was buried with national honors in the place made for it
 sampoorn vaataavaran aisa anubhav de rahaa tha jaise louis punah jivit ho uthe he
 In this way, his historical mistake was repented by a nation, but the work done by Lewis was useful not for any nation alone but for the blind mankind of the whole world, so only by giving honor by one nation, that wise Could not be true worshiper

 Studies the properties of the flow of fluids under liquefaction
 praudyogiki main draviki kaa upyog anya kaaryon ke alaava sanket, bal yaa urja ke sancharan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The idea of engineering elements in fluids comes under which water, air and oil and other chemical solutions are used in natural conditions or under pressure
 in dravon ke prakritik gunon kaa, jaise ghanatv, shyanta, pratyasthata or prishth tanaav aadi, ke upar ejiniyari ke samast abhikalp nirbhar hote hai, kyonki saare dravon kaa aadharbhoot vyavhaar ek sa hi hota he
 There are many more specialized parts of water engineering, details of which can be found under those special organs
 jal ejiniyari main mukhyat: jal kaa sthir dabaav, uski gati tathaa uskaa prabhaav, uske dwaara chaalit yantra jal kaa maapan aadi vishyon kaa vichaar aa jaataa he
 With regard to water engineering, it is necessary to first study the permanent pressure of water
 yah sthaayee dabaav kaa vishay dravasthiti vigyaan kehalaata he
 When any kind of motion occurs in the water, the problem becomes complicated
 anyaanya dravon kii bhanti jal kii bhi yah visheshta hoti he ki vah prithvi ke gurutv ke kaaran swayan chaalak ho jaataa he or yah gun sthiti ke anukool ghatata badhata rahata he
 The thinking of the engineer is different from the thinking of the mathematician in this regard
 ganitagya bahut si baton kaa nidaan kaalpanik paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahakar karte hai
 In the view of engineers, depending on the actual conditions
 ejiniyaron ke vichaar main vaastavik sthitiyon kaa jal sambandhi samasyaon par bada prabhaav padataa he
 Many basic facts are calculated to solve these problems, such as energy indestructibility, conservation of mass, conservation of solvation etc
 jal ejiniyari kaa koi bhi prashn ho, vah inamen se do aadharbhoot tathyon par avashya hi nirbhar hoga
 In the 18th century, the Swiss engineer, Daniel Bernuli, proposed that the particles of any fluid in the path of motion have the same energy or the sum of motion energy and potential energy is the same
 is siddhanth se bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 For example, one pump extracts one cubic foot of water per second
 uske ek sire par pani kaa veg 10 foot prati second he or duusari ore pani kaa veg 20 foot prati second he, pehle sire par veg kaa dabaav 1
56 foot he or duusare sire par 6
24 foot he
 Therefore, the pump put additional pressure 50
68 feet above the water
 maap 46 foot hi dikhaai padati he, kyonki baaki kaa dabaav veg dabaav main parivartit ho gaya
 Bernuli's fact solves many problems
 pani ke bahaav main or bhi bahut si baton kaa nidaan karnaa padataa he, jaise chote-bade nikaason se pani kaa viratan, nikaas maarg ke sankuchit hone se bahaav kii sthiti main ghataav-badhaav, nikaas maarg kii banaavat tathaa uske aakaar kaa jalanissaran par prabhaav, niksaa maarg main chote bade bhanvar paidaa ho janaa, in sab baton kaa lagaav naharon ke liye, yaa jal-prasadan-kendron main jalavitaran ke liye kiye gaye sadhano par hota he
 Designs of great works are made by considering these things in the canals
 vastav main jal ejiniyari main aisi bahut si baton kaa samanvay hota he jinka ganit ke dwaara samaadhaan hona sambhav nahin
 Hence, many problems are solved by making small models ie small size samples
 in namoonon yaa modelon main pani pravesh karakar or uski chaal ko maapkar yah baat nirdhaarit kii jaati he ki vibhinn abhikalpon se banaae kaaryon par pani ke vyaavhaarik bahaav se kya prabhaav padegaa
 From these experiments, it can be estimated that with the pressure of water or by the flow of water, the work created by a particular design starts to stagnate or become stable
 vaise to jal sambandhit kaaryon kaa nirmaan drav ejiniyari ke mul siddhanton par hi nirbhar hota he, kintu un kaaryon kii vyaavhaarik sucharutha evam sampannataa or sthirataa kaa thik anumaan model ke prayog dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the navigational work where large ships are built, the efficiency and traffic ability of ships are estimated by small models
 pani ke bahaav main gharshan dwaara bahut se dabaav kaa kshay hota he
 For this reason, water is not able to get out of favorable pressure at water supply sites at high or distance places
 vaise khuli naharon main bhi gharshan dwaara dabaav kaa kshay hota he
 Many means are presented by water engineering in such a way that the pressure decay is minimized
 isaliye pani ke margo ko pakkaa yaa chikna karne ke saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 There is a loss of pressure in the tubes where there are joints or turns or where the tubes are the smallest
 dabaav ke is kshay kaa anumaan barnuli ke sameekaran dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 In large ponds or reservoirs or in fulfillment of special works, water erosion occurs by planting in the ground
 iske liye bhi jal ejiniyari ke siddhanton dwaara aise saadhan jutaaye jate hai jinase yaa to sarpan bilkul band ho jaay athwa sanrpan dwaara pani itane hi veg se bahe, jisase bhoomi ke kan hatane na paaen
 If the ground particles start to move, then the result is that inside the work based on the design, there is a pole and the stability of the work is at risk
 is sambandh main bahut sa kaary bhinn-bhinn deshon main ho chukaa he
 a lot of work has been created based on the "draining" principle laid down by Bilai
 is siddhant kaa mul yah tha ki yadi sanrpan kaa maarg lanbaa kar diya jaay to usase nikaas kaa veg kam ho jaayga
 After this, Indian engineer Khosla declared another fact, on the basis of which a lot of works were created
 jal ejiniyari kaa mahatvapurn kshetra bade-bade band tathaa nadiyon main roak yaa baraaj banane kaa he
 Where dams are built to store water, there is a big search to check the stability of dams
 saadhaarant: jitna unchaa band ho uski ek tihaai tal kii chaudaai honi chahie
 For this, the mathematics-line-diagnosis is performed and its performance is shown in Figure 3
 yah saadhaaran bhu-aakarshan par sthit kancreet baandh kaa abhikalp he
 In addition to the weight of water in these designs, the effect of waves, the effect of earthquake, the effect of wind and many other things also have to be considered
 phir, aajkal vyay main bachat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ye band bhi vividh prakaar se banane lage hai or band kaa nirmaan jal ejiniyari kii vishesh shakha ban gai he
 When water comes out under very high pressure, the capacity of the same canopy increases greatly
 badi badi chattaane uske kaaran cat jaati hai
 Therefore, the problem of drainage of excess water on very large dams is very serious
 uske nikaas sthal ko vishesh rup se pakkaa banaaya jaataa he
 Somewhere, in order to expend the power created in water, a shape of a spherical plane has to be made
 is prakaar neeche girakar jal kuch upar uthta he or usamen nihit shakti kaa hraas ho jaataa he; iske uparaant us jal kii kataanakshmata kam ho jaati he
 Many other resources are used to spend power created in water

 This is the trick in progress in the production of hydroelectric power
 iske dwaara jal ke dabaav se panbizli ke janitr ko ghumaya jaataa he
 Due to its operation, electricity is generated
 uske do praturup hai
 One is where the turbine's rotating fans are such that they rotate under water pressure
 inako pratikriya tarabine kaha jaataa he
 They are especially used where water is high
 duusare prakaar ke tarabine aaveg tarabine, yani chot khaakar chalanevaale tarabine hote hai
 In these, the wheel of the turbine rotates with a water blade and it rotates the generator which generates electricity
 ejiniyari ke kshetra main jal ejiniyari kaa sthaan mahatvapurn he
 There is a large use of water in the field of industry
 baari se baari dabaav utpann karne ke liye jalprerit press kaam main laae jate hai
 These are called hydraulic presses
 in preson kaa vistaar bade se bada ho saktaa he
 Steam engines are made by running water from it
 railgadee kaa ingine jal kii bhaap se hi chalata he
 Although it is not a full-fledged field of water engineering, steam and water are governed on almost the same principle as both remain in liquid state
 jal yaa bhaap main jitna adhik dabaav hota he usee maatra main unamem shakti sanchit hoti he
 Whether the pressure is caused by a natural high position or by artificial means
 jal ke dabaav ke kaaran hi kahin-kahin jal ke jeton dwaara bahut se kaam kiye jate hai
 In many cities, water jets are used for cleaning etc
 is prakaar ke dabaav se kheti-baari main bhi bauchhaar dwaara pani kaa vitaran kiya jaataa he or ek prakaar kii varsha kii jaati he
 Scientifically, by creating excessive pressure, so much power is created in the water stream that it can cut even big things
 yathesht dabaav dwaara yah dhar steel kii paraton tak ko bhi kaatane kii kshamta rakhti he
 a pressure of about 10,000 pounds per square inch is required for that

 People with Asperger Syndrome, unlike self-expression, usually go to others themselves, even if shy and shy
 For example, a person with a PD can speak for a long time on a topic of their choice without recognizing the feelings or reactions of others
 This social clumsiness has been called "active but odd"
 unke samajikaran ke prati chalati asafalataa ke kaaran, dusre log ise apni bhaawanaaon kaa niraadar samaj sakate he
 However, a person from s to PD does not take the initiative in talking to others

 According to more evidence, PDT survivors hunt themselves, instead of being hunters
 According to a 2008 review, a large number of reported violent offenders with AS had AS as well as psychiatric and schizoaffective diseases
 
 People with Asperger's syndrome often exhibit restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities, and are sometimes unusually intense or focused

 Rude and repetitive behavior is a major part of the diagnosis of this disease
 ve log sammishra baanh yaa puure sharir kii besangi kii harkato kaa pardarshan karte hai
 They often do these responses over a long period of time, and they tend to be more voluntary and ritualistic than the self-reacting responses that are faster and less symmetrical and deliberate

 sanwat, samayganana kaa bhartiya maapdand
 There are many popular cultures in Indian society
 mukhya rup se do sanwat chal rahe hai, pratham vikram sanwat tathaa doosraa shaq sanwat
 Vikram Samvat BC Started 58 years
 yah sanwat malvagan ke samuhik prayatnon dwaara gardbhill ke putr vikram ke netritv main us samay videshi maane janevaale shaq logon kii paraajay ke smarak rup main prachlit hua
 It seems, the people have always used it to keep the patriotism of the Indian public and their feelings towards foreigners, because the Indian emperors have used their own culture
 itnaa nishchit he ki yah sanwat malvagan dwaara janata kii bhaavana ke anuroop prachlit hua or tabhi se janata dwaara grahya evam prayukt he
 In the early period of this Samvat, it became k कृतसंसंत्त्a, later Malvāsvāt and finally 'vikram Samvat'
 yahi antim naam is sanwat ke saath judaa hua he
 Regarding Saka Samvat, Budua is of the opinion that it was practiced by Kshatrap Chesthan of Ujjayini
 shaq rajyon ko chandragupta vikramaditya ne samaapt kar diya par unka smarak shaq sanwat abhi tak bharatvarsh main chal rahaa he
 Saka era started in 78 AD
 vikram sanwat i
 pus
 57 varsh prarambh hua
 It became popular as a commemoration of the defeat of the Shakas, who were considered foreign at that time, by the collective efforts of Samvat Malav Gana, led by Gaddabhilla's son Vikram
 jaan padataa he, bhartiya janata ke deshprem or videshiyon ke prati unki bhaavana sadaa jaagrit rakhane ke liye janata ne sadaa se iskaa prayog kiya he kyonki bhartiya samraaton ne apane hi sanwat kaa prayog kiya he
 It is so certain that this Samvat became popular in accordance with the sentiments of the people by Malav Gana and has been accepted and used by the public since then
 is sanwat ke praarambhik kaal main yah krit, tadnantar maalav or ant main vikram sanwat rah gaya
 This last name is associated with this era
 rashtriya shaake athwa shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya kalandar he
 It started in 78 years BC
 caitra 1, 1879 shaq samvath ko ise adhikarik rup se vidhivat apanaaya gaya
 After 500 AD, all the astrological texts written in Sanskrit started using Shaka Samvat
 is samvath kaa yah naam kyon padaa, is vishay main vibhinn ek mat hai
 It was run by the Kushan king Kanishka or by someone else, nothing could be said in the end about it
 yah ek kathin samasya he jo bhartiya itihaas or kaal nirnay kii atyant kathin samasyaon main maani jaati he
 Varahamihira has called it saka-kaal and saka-bhupakala
 utpal ne brihatsamhita kii vyakhya main kaha he - jab vikramaditya dwaara shaq raja maaraa gaya to yah samvath chalaa
 Its years began with Chaitra for solar-solar-calculation and Aries for solar calculation
 iske varsh saamanytah beete hue hai or san 78 i
 ke 'vaasanthik vishuv' se yah armbh kiya gaya he
 The oldest inscription, which clearly mentions the Shaka Samvat, is of the 'chalukya Vallabheshwar', dated 465 Shaka Samvat i
e
 543 AD
 kshatrap raajaaon ke shilalekhon main varshon kii sankhya vyakt he, kintu samvath kaa naam nahin he, kintu ve sankhyaayein shaq kaal kii dyotak hai, aisa saamanytah logon kaa mat he
 Some people consider Kushan king Kanishka to be the founder of Shaka Samvat
 pashchaatkaaleen, madhyavarti evam vartmaan kaalon main, jyotirvidaabharan main bhi yahi baat he, shaq samvath kaa naam 'shalivahan' he
 But in the form of Samvat, Shalivahana form has come in the inscriptions of 13th or 14th century
 yah sambhav he ki satvaahan naam 'shalvahan' bana or 'shalivahan' ke rup main aa gaya
 The Saptarshi Samvat used in Kashmir is another Samvat, also known as the cosmic era
 rajtarangini ke anusaar loukik varsh 24 gat shaq samvath 1070 ke baraabar he
 Centuries are not given in the usage of this era
 yah chandra-saura samvath he or caitra shukla kii pratipada ko i
 pus
 april 3076 main armbh hua
 Brihatsamhita mentions a tradition that the Saptarshis have lived in a constellation for a hundred years and were in Aries when Yudhishthira was ruling
 sambhavtah yahi sau varshon vaale vritton kaa udgam he
 There were many other Samvatas also, such as Vardhamana, buddha-nirvana, Gupta, Chedi, Harsha, Lakshmanasen in Bengal, Kollam or Parashurama in Malavar, which were once very prevalent at least in cosmic life
 maanavtaavaadi manovigyaan ek manovaigyanik drushtikon he 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main prasiddh hua
 This theory emerged in response to the psychoanalytic theory of Sigmund Fried and the behaviorism of BF Skinner
 vyaktitv ke adhyayan ke liye manovaigyanikon ne kai siddhanton ko pratipaadit kiya he
 In the twentieth century, ideas related to personality studies emerged as three important theories
 maanavtaavaadi siddhanth kii vyakhya anya siddhanton se bilkul hi bhinn prakaar se kii gai he
 In this theory, it is especially believed that a person is basically good and respectful and if his ambient conditions are favorable, then he develops his modesty positively
 yah siddhanth vaiyaktik vikaas, swa kaa parimarjan, abhivruddhi, vyakti ke mulyon evam arthon kii vyakhya karata he
 The proponent of this theory was Abraham Maslow
 maslo kaa janm roodhiwaadee jaivis parivaar main neuyark main hua
 He received his ph
d
 in Psychology from the University of Colombia in 1934
 Has received the title of
 'maanavtaavaadi manovigyan' naamak is siddhanth ke vikaas main astitvvaadi manovigyaan kaa bhi yogadan he
 Existentialism and humanism both explain the human consciousness, subjective sensations and aspirations and personal experiences of the person and try to relate it to the world
 maslo ke is siddhanth main yah dharna he ki abhipreranaayen samgr rup se manushya ko prabhavit karti he
 Based on this belief, Maslow propounded the hierarchical principle of motivation
 maanavtaavaadi siddhanth ke manovaigyanikon ne maanav vyavhaar evam pashu vyavhaar main saapeksh antar mana he
 They refute behaviorism because behaviorism starts with animal behavior
 maslo evam unke saathiyon ne maanav vyavhaar ko sabhi prakaar ke pashu vyavhaaron se bhinn mana
 He therefore rejected the similarity of animal behavior with human behavior
 unhone maanav vyavhaar ko samajhane ke liye pashuon par kiye jane vaale shodh kaaryon kaa khandan kiya kyonki pashuon main manvochit gun jaise adarsh, mulya, prem, lajja, kala, utsaah, ronaa, hansanaa, irshyaa, sammaan tathaa samanta nahin paye jate
 These qualities do not develop in animals and cannot perform special brain functions such as poetry, songs, art, mathematics etc
 maanavtaavaadiyon ne maanviya vyavhaar kii vyakhya main maanav ke antarang swaroop par vishesh bal diya
 According to him, there is an intimate form of a person which is natural, permanent and unchangeable for him in some quantity
 iske atirikt unhone maanav kii srujanaatmak kriyaaon ko vyisht kriyaayein mana he
 Maslow and other humanists hold the view that psychologists in other theories did not describe any aspect in studying human behavior, which could describe the function, way of life and goals of a perfectly healthy human being
 maslo kaa yah vishwaas tha ki maansik swasthya kaa adhyayan kiye bina vyakti kii maansik durbalataaon kaa adhyayan karnaa bekaar he
 Maslow said that studying only the abnormal, underdeveloped, handicapped and unwell is only giving rise to 'handicapped' psychology
 unhone manovaigyanik rup se swasth evam swa-vaastavikrut vyaktiyon ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya
 Therefore, in humanistic psychology, 'soulful' is considered the value of human life

 Gauss' deletion method in linear algebra is a method of solving a body of linear equations under which all other variables, except one, eventually become extinct when performing some operations in sequence
 raikhik samikarnon ke nikaay ko hal karne ke alaava gouse kii vilopan vidhi kaa upyog kisi matrix kii rank praapt karne ke liye, kisi matrix ke ditorminant kaa maan nikaalane ke liye, tathaa kisi varg matrix kaa vyutkram nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This method is named after the German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss, although this method was known even before him
 gouse kii vilopan vidhi ko sambandhit samikarnon kii matrix par kram se kii jane vaali sankriyaaon ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he
 That is, there is no need to carry equations with their variables, but the matrix which is left after dropping the variables, all operations have to be done on the same sequence
 is vilopan vidhi main keval panktiyon kii saral sankriyaayein kii jaati hai taaki mul matrix aisi matrix main parivartit ho jaay jiske baayein nichle kone ke adhik se adhik avyav shunya hon
 For this, three types of row-operations are done - in teen sankriyaaon ko samuchit dhang se karne par kisi bhi matrix ko upree trikoniya matrix main badla ja saktaa he jo vastav main 'pankti-sopanak swaroop' main hogi
 For example, following the following row-operations, the third and fourth matrices have come as row-ellipses and the last matrix is in a unique miniaturized row-ellipse format
 pankti-sankriyaayein karke kisi matrix ko laghukrit pankti-sopanak rup main laane kii prakriya ko kabhi-kabhi gouse-jordan vilopan kehete hai
 Some authors call the process 'gauss deletion' until the matrix is transformed into an upper triangular matrix
 jab raikhik samikarnon ke nikaay kaa hal nikaalnaa hota he tab kabhi-kabhi matrix ke purnatah laghukrit hone ke pehle hi pankti-sankriyaaon ko roak dena adhik suvidhajanak hota he
 Let us find the solution of the body of the following equations
 neeche kii sarini main sari prakriya dikhaai gai he jisamen teen chijen dikhaai gayi hai: Keep in mind that often entire equations are not shown to be changing, but only carry on the augmented matrix and its transformed forms
 computer ke liye bhi yahi suvidhajanak he
 { \ displaystyle \ left} jaise hi teesri pankti se y vilupt ho jaataa he, samikarnon kaa nikaay ticone rup main badal jaataa he
 The first part of this algorithm ended here
 gananaa kii drushti se charon kaa maan ulte kram main nikaalen to kaam jaldi ho jaataa he
 This is called post-replacement
 hal nimnlikhit he: That is, there is a unique solution to the body of the given equations
 matrix ke pankti-sopanak rup main aane ke baad hi na rukkar matrix ke laghukrit pankti-sopanak rup main badalane tak prakriya ko jari rakhaa ja saktaa he
 
 shuru se lekar yahan tak kii prakriya ko kabhi-kabhi gouse-jordan vilopan kaha jaataa he
 The following equations have to be solved: { x − y + 2 z = 5 3 x + 2 y + z = 10 2 x − 3 y − 2 z = − 10 { \ displaystyle \ left \ {{ \ begin{array}{*{7}{c}}x&-&y&+&2z&=&5 \ \ 3x&+&2y&+&z&=&10 \ \ 2x&-&3y&-&2z&=&-10 \ \ \ end{array}} \ right
} The first step of the Gauss-deletion method is to write the matrix
 pivot 1 he
 - 1 2 5 3 2 1 10 2 - 3 - 2 - 10) { \ displaystyle \ left & -1 & 2 & 5 \ \ 3 & 2 & 1 & 10 \ \ 2 & -3 & -2 & -10 \ end {array}} \ right)} pehali pankti main -3 se guna karke duusari main jodne se shunya miltaa he
 Similarly, multiplying by - in the first row and adding to the third row gives zero
 nayaa dhuree 5 he: - 5 - 5 0 - 1 - 6 - 20) { \ displaystyle \ left & -5 & -5 \ \ 0 & -1 & -6 & -20 \ end {array}} \ right)} duusari pankti main 1 / 5 se guna karne par: - 1 - 1 0 - 1 - 6 - 20) { \ displaystyle \ left & -1 & -1 \ \ 0 & -1 & -6 & -20 \ end {array}} \ right)} ab duusari pankti ko pratham pankti tathaa tritiy pankti main jodate hai
 New Axis-7 is: − 21 ) { \ displaystyle \ left&-21 \ end{array}} \ right)} Divide the third line by -7: 3 ) { \ displaystyle \ left&3 \ end{array}} \ right)} The matrix obtained by subtracting the third row from the first row and adding the third row to the second row has 1 on the diagonal on the left side of the upward line
 { \ displaystyle \ left} The solution to the equation is out, which is: { x = 1 y = 2 z = 3 { \ displaystyle \ left \ {{ \ begin{array}{ccc}x&=&1 \ \ y&=&2 \ \ z&=&3 \ \ \ end{array}} \ right
