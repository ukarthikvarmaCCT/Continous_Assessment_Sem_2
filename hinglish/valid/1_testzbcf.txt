 Ever since the two-party system was strengthened in 1910, there have been only two hung parliaments, in 1940 and 2010
 In the 1940 federal election, outgoing Prime Minister Robert Menzais received the support of two independent independents and remained in power, but during the parliamentary term, independent members lent their support to Labor and John Curtin rose to power

 Actually, this temple was built for the idol of Lord Rama, but it did not move from its place when the idol was installed
 is murti ko madhukar shah ke rajyakaal ke dauraan unki rani ganesh kuvar ayodhya se laai thim
 It was installed in the palace for some time before the Chaturbhuj Temple was built
 lekin mandir banane ke baad koi bhi murti ko uske sthaan se hilaa nahin paaya
 Believing it to be a miracle of God, the palace itself was given the shape of a temple and was named Ram Raja Mandir
 aaj is mahal ke chaaron ore shahar basaa he or ram navami par yahaan hajaaron shraddhalu ikattha hote hai
 By the way, Lord Rama is considered to be Lord here and is also considered the king here, because the face of that idol is not towards the temple but towards the palace

 The queen sent a message to the king that she was coming to Orchha with Ramraja
 raja madhukarshah ne ramraaja ke vigrah ko sthapit karne ke liye karodon kii laagat se chaturbhuj mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 When the queen reached Orchha, she kept this idol in her palace
 yah nishchit hua ki shubh murut main murti ko chaturbhuj mandir main rakhkar isaki praan pratishtha kii jaaegi
 But this Deity of Rama refused to go to the quadrilateral
 kehete hai ki ram yahaan bal rup main aae or apni maa kaa mahal chhodkar wo mandir main kaise ja sakate the
 Rama still sits in this palace and the quadrangular temple built for him is deserted even today
 yah mandir aaj bhi murti viheen he
 It is also a coincidence that the writing of Ramcharit Manas was also completed on the same day in 1631, when Ramaraja arrived in Orchha
 jo murti orchha main vidyaman he uske bare main bataaya jaataa he ki jab ram vanvaas ja rahe the to unhone apni ek bal murti maa kaushalya ko di thi

 Kalyanji Anandji has composed the music in the film, and the lyrics of the film have been penned by Anjan and Indivar
 amitabh bachchan ne film main anderworld bos 'don' kii, or uske hamshakl 'vijay' kii dohari bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The story of the film revolves around Vijay, a resident of Bombay's slums, who is incidentally a don's rival
 bombay police ke disipi di'silva vijay se don kaa rup lene ko kehete hai, taaki vah police ke mubir ke rup main kaam kar sake, or saath hi don ke aapraadhik network kaa bhandaphod karne main police kii madad kar saken
 'don' is an underworld criminal in Mumbai, who is looking for both the Mumbai Police and Interpol
 interpol kii 'most wanted' aparaadhiyon kii suchi main shaamil don har baar police ko chakma dekar bhaag nikalne main safal ho jaataa he
 Due to his ruthless nature, Don has other enemies besides the police
 pramukhtah don ne ek baar apane hi ek sahakarmi, ramesh kii hatya kar di thi, jiske baad uski mangetar 'kamini' tathaa bahan 'roma' don ke dushman ban gaye
 Kamini tries to seduce Dawn, so that the police come and capture Dawn, but Dawn manages to escape by taking Kamini hostage, and Kamini dies in this entire development
 kamini kii bhi mrityu se acroshit roma apane bal kataa leti he, or judo tathaa karate sikhkar don ke giroh main shaamil ho jaati he, taaki mauka paakar vah don ko maar de
 After several unsuccessful attempts to capture Dawn, the police finally succeed, and DCP d'silva is almost caught by Dawn, that Dawn dies, and d'silva's attempt to reach Dawn's boss
 The dream remains incomplete
 iske baad di'silva don ko vahiin dafna detaa he
 Vijay, who lives in a Mumbai slum, is a simple man who dances in Mumbai and is trying to raise his two children
 disipi di'silva kii mulaakaat ek baar vijay se hoti he, jisase unhen pataa chalata he, kii vijay don kaa hamshakl he, or vah vijay se don banane ko kehete hai, taaki vijay police kii mukhabiri kare, or uske raste di'silva is aapraadhik network kii tah tak pahunch paaen
 Vijay accepts them, and becomes a don and goes back to his gang, where he pretends to have lost his memory
 isi bich jasjit 'jeje' jail se chhot jaataa he
 Jasjeet was arrested by DCP d'silva; The reason jj's wife died, and her two children went missing
 uske donon bacchon, deepu tathaa munni kaa laalan-paalan isi bich vijay kar rahaa tha
 Vijay takes a 'red diary' of Don, and goes to meet DCP d'silva
 roma bhi uske saath jaati he, or vahaan use akelaa paakar vah us par hamalaa kar detii he
 d'silva arrives at the moment and tells Roma the reality of Vijay, and after this Roma also joins Vijay
 vijay vah diary di'silva ko de detaa he, or use padhakar unhen pataa chalata he ki don ke bos kaa naam varadhan he, parantu uske bare main isse adhik jaankaree us diary main nahin likhi hoti
 Slowly, Vijay learns more about Don, and one day with Roma's help, he announces that his memory has returned
 isi kushi main ek party hoti he, jisamen police kii red pad jaati he
 In this raid, DCP d'silva is badly injured in the shootout, and the police apprehend Vijay as a don
 vijay un logon ko sach bataata he, jiske baad police vaale use disipi di'silva ke paas hospital le jate he; kintu kuch bol paane se pehle hi disipi di'silva kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Vijay is being sent to a high-security prison by a truck, and he manages to escape from the truck
 iske baad vah swayan ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye roma kii madad se khud koi tarkeeb sochane lagata he
 Vijay gets badly involved in this development, as the police refuse to believe that he is Vijay, and at the same time, Don's underworld gang realizes that he is not really Don
 upar se vah laal diary, jo usne disipi di'silva ko di thi, use jasjit chura le jaataa he
 Vijay succeeds in dodging both the police and Narang, the current ringleader of the underworld gang, with the help of Roma, and attempts to return to his old life
 vijay interpol ke afasar, aar ke maalik se milane kaa aagrah karata he, or unase kuch samay kii maang karata he, taaki vah apni begunaahi kaa pramaan laa sake
 He then discovers that what he perceived to be the boss of the Interpol officer r until now, is actually the boon, who kidnaps the real R's boss and is disguised by them
 use yah bhi pataa chalata he ki disipi di'silva kii hatya bhi varadhan ne hi kii thi
 Vijay tries to tell this to other police officers, but they do not believe his words
 iske baad vijay varadhan ke sabhi gundon se swayan ladata he, or isi bich roma bhi vah laal diary dhundhakar le aati he
 In the same battle, a goon snatches the diary from Roma and burns it

 Jai is a rich young man
 ek din, vah apni dost, anitha ke saath bahere bacchon ke skool main jaataa he, jise vah pryojit kar rahaa he
 There, he meets Tia, a teacher, and develops his feelings for her
 vah jahaan bhi kar saktaa he uski madad karata he or uske paas rahane kii koshish karata he - yah maanate hue ki tia bhi uske liye kuch mahasoos karti he
 On the other hand, Tia sees him as a good friend
 jab vah antat apni bhaawanaaon ko sweekaar karata he, to tia apane mangetar, raaj ke astitv kaa khulaasa karti he
 Tia marries Raj and they have a son named Anshu
 teenon ek saath ek garib lekin khushhaal jivan jite hai
 Jai is devastated, as many of his attempts to win Tia's heart fail
 doston ke saath ek raat ko jai behad nashe main ho jaataa he or anitha ke saath ghar gaadi chalaata he
 He gets into a serious car accident and it is revealed that Tia and Raj were in another car
 anitha or raaj turant vahi mar jate hai
 Tia herself survives but loses her memory
 jai tia kii dekhbhaal karnaa chahta he, kyonki vah uski haalat ke liye zimmedaar he or tia or uski maa ko dakshin africa main uske saath rahane ke liye prastaav detaa he
 Tia's mother accepts this for Tia's sake, though she considers Jai the murderer of her son-in-law and the cause of her daughter's memory loss
 tia ko bataaya jaataa he ki anitha uski sabase acchhee dost thi, jo car durghatana main mar gai thi or anshu jai or anitha kaa betaa he
 Tia is told that Anshu loves her "aunt" very much and should take care of the child so that she doesn't miss her mother too much
 dakshin africa main, tia kii maa ko pataa chalata he ki tia jai ko pasand karne lagi he or jai ko chetavanee detii he ki vah use protsaahit na kare
 Jai looks after Tia, but whenever she tries to get close to him, he keeps a distance
 jai ke pita unhen ek saath karne kii koshish karte hai
 In the end, Tia's mother accepts the fact that her daughter is in love with Jay
 haalanki, jai abhi bhi tia ke saath rishte main pravesh karne ke liye anicchhuk he kyonki vah durghatana ke kaaran khud ko doshi mahasoos karata he
 When Tia threatens to commit suicide, Jai is forced to admit that Anshu is Tia's son
 anitha keval uski mitra thi or uskaa pati bhi durghatana main mar gaya
 Jay's father, who arrives with Tia's mother, reveals that Jay loves Tia very much, but he hopes he will be punished by Tia for what he did
 haalanki, tia jai ko maaf kar detii he, bhale hi vah apni yaaddaasht waapas nahin laa paati
 She says that when Jai does not want to be with her, she will take her son
 jai use roktaa he or bataata he ki vah usase pyaar karata he or usase usase shaadi karne ke liye kahata he, jise vah khushi se sweekaar karti he
