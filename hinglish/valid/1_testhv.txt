 The system of education continued for the first time

 america rus The two wars fought between China and mainly Britain in the mid-nineteenth century are called the Opium Wars
 unnisvin shatabdi main lambe samay se china or britain ke bich chal rahe vyapaar vivaadon kii charmavastha main pahuchane ke kaaran hue
 The first war lasted from 1839 to 1842 and the second from 1856 to 1860
 duusari baar frans bhi britain ke saath-saath ladaa
 China was defeated in both wars and the Chinese regime had to endure the illegal trade of opium
 china ko nanjing kii sandhi tathaa tiyangin kii sandhi kerani padi
 The conflict began with Britain's lack of trade with China and Britain's smuggling of opium from India to China
 china ke kanoon ke anusaar afim kaa aayaat karnaa pratibandhit tha
 But China was angered by the smuggling of opium manufactured by the British East India Company in Patna and auctioned in Calcutta
 lekin british samrajya ke badhate kharch tathaa china se resham or chaay ke bhugtan ke liye afim ek aisa dravya tha jisaki chini janata main bahut maang thi
 But the Ching rulers were against it due to its intoxicating effect
 yudhon ke parinamswaroop china ko apane paanch bandargah videshi vyapaar ke liye kholane pade
 Britain was controlled by Hong Kong Island and the opium trade continued
 yuddh kii vajah se ching rajvansh ke khilaaf chini janata ne vidroh kiye - in vidrohon main ching vansh kaa paaramparik haan bahumat se alag samskruti or mul kaa hona bhi shaamil tha
 Manchuria was not a part of China at the time of the previous dynasties

 After the Portuguese colonized Goa in India, Macau soon followed, colonizing southern China
 spain ne jab philipino par adhikaar kar liya tab tab china or pashchim desho ke bich len-dein badi tezi se or bade natkeey tareeke se badha
 The Manila Galleons used to bring as much silverware to China as they did to the ancient soil of Asia
 ching rajvansh bahaari sansar se simit sampark hi rakhana chahta tha taaki koi unke bhitari maamlo me dakhal naa de
 Ching only allowed trade from the port of Canton
 bade kathin kanoon ke saath sirf anugna-praapt ekadhikario ko hi vyapaar karne kii anumati thi
 As a result of this, the huge prices and taxes of imported retail material which the common man could not afford
 isaki vajah se aaayaatit saamaan kii simit maang thi
 Instead, silk and tea were exported from China
 lekin afim kii kami ke kaaran iskaa daam adhik tha or china ko vparik munaafaa kam
 China banned the consumption of aphin in a 1798 order
 chini parampara main sampurna sansar paanch sankendriya vritton main banta tha
 Adar's three circles were inhabited by the Chinese and their neighbors, and the outer two circles lived outside and "distant barbaric castes"
 parampara ke anusaar andar ke teen vrutt ke logon ko hi swarg se shashan kaa adhikaar mila he
 Thus, in terms of British, Chinese rule and public, soldiers were considered inferior in terms of military
 lekin jab chini samraat ne unke vyapaar ko semik or pratibandhit karnaa chaha to angrezon ne uskaa pehle rajanyik or phir sainik virodh kiya
 Diplomatic protests were at times unheard of - sometimes thinking that the British were barbarians
 lekin san 1839 ke baad dhaare dhire sainik sangharsh aarambh ho gaya
 In 1838 the Chinese Emperor Daogang, known for his suppression of rebellions, put the charge of the affairs of the canton
 canton dakshin-purvi china kaa pattan tha jahaan se macau or honkong nikat the - or videshiyon ko keval yaheen se vyapaar kii ijaajat thi
 Lin opposed the British policy of sending local people into opium by bribing them
 isse angrez naaraaz hue
 But Lynn did not stop - she threatened the British captain Charles Eliot to cease trading
 iske baad aliot ne samjhaute ke mutabik opium kaa vyapaar roka - or 2000 ton afim samudr main bahaane ke liye raji hua
 Lynn took the poppy boxes and threw them into the sea
 iske baad jab british jahaaz nemesis aayaa to chiniyon kii sainik dhamkiyaan bekaar ho gayi kyonki ab angrejon ke paas behatar hathiyaar or jahaaz the
 The British started fighting
 hazaron chini mar gaye
 The Chinese emperor recalled Lin from his post
 iske baad baat ko aage na badhata dekh kar angrejon ne bhi charles aliot ko bula liya or uski jagah henry pottinger ko niyukt kiya
 Pottinger changed the direction of the war
 centon par akraman 1841 main hua
 This was followed by the invasion of Shanghai and Nanjing along the Yangtze River
 20 hajaar chini sainik mare lekin british kshati saikadon main thi
 In the autumn of 1842, a treaty was signed between the representative of the new Ching Commissioners and the British
 sharton ke mutabik british paanch pattan par vyapaar karne ko sweekrut kiye gaye
 After the Treaty of Nanjing, British trade in Canton was allowed, but after the British invasion of 1841–42, there was a rage against the British in the local population
 shahar main gum rahe british or bhartiya sainikon ke saath bura bartaav kiya gaya
 After this, the British Army started the invasion again in 1856, after the encouragement of English News Papers, British Parliament and other European powers
 isamen beijing ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya or chini samraat apane bhai ko uttardayatv saunp kar uttar kii disha main bhaag niklaa
 After the defeat and escape in the Afghan wars, it gained a moral force
 saath hi british or pashchim kii nazaron main china ko vyapaar ke liye khol diya gaya
 The heroes of this war, Ching commander Lin Xisu, are still remembered today as a great patriot in China and presented as an example in opposition to the West
 is sandhi kii mukhya sharte :-british logo ko na keval canton me ,apitu phucho ,ningpo or shanghai me bhi basane or vyapaar karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho

 This is a list of English language words that are native to Indian languages or a list of English words originating from Indian languages
 Hindi is an indo-aryan language that evolved from the Sanskrit language, and is thus a much simpler version of it
 It is also called "standard Hindi" the language spoken in the northern belt of India
 Standard Hindi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India
 English language took many words from Hindi Some of them are as: - 1)- Jungle:- and Indian word taken directly as it is pronounced with the same meaning " Forest" Both the language share the same meaning 2) - Juggernaut: - which is the name of Lord Krishna as he is worshiped in one of the 4 major Dham named jaggan Nath Puri in India
 It was taken with a different meaning a slightly different meaning
 First was a force which could ruin anything or ravage, devastate anything that comes in it's way
 Second meaning is a Blind devotion that needs cruel sacrifices in any form
 3)-bangalore :- To fire a worker because his or her job is getting outsourced to an offshore company overseas
 It's a City in India by the name Banglore, which was taken verbatim as a verb
 This city has most numbers of IT engineers and it started outsourcing American IT jobs
 4) -trignometry: - This is an argument that this word is taken from Indian word trikonmiti that stands for trignometry and is an ancient word found in sthapatya upveda one of the oldest books written in the world
 So it's but natural that it was the most ancient origin of this word
 But it might have migrated in other languages to move in English 5)- Bandana:- It comes from Indian word Bandhna that means to tie anything; a verb
 6) - Shampoo: - There is a Hindi verb chumpi which means a head massage with oil, a proper treatment of hypertension
 It results in a noun Chumpoo the one who gets such a message or as in a derogatory term one who used excessive oil on hairs or is fond of his hair
 It gives a very fashionable word in English which we can use freely
 7)- Sentry:- In Hindi as in Sanskrit Santri is prime minister of any state, one who is subordinate only to king and no one else, one who is advisory of the king and plans action of the state
 That word is called to derive the word sentry meaning a guard, especially a soldier posted at a given spot to prevent the passage of unauthorized persons
 8) - Aryan: - is derived from the Sanskrit 'arya'
 It is also present in Latin and Greek, but is believed to ultimately root from Sanskrit
 In the 18th century in Sanskrit, the word meant 'speaker of the North Indian language'
 In the 1830s Aryan was expanded to mean 'speaker of indo-european languages' since it was discovered that Iranians also used the same word for the same meaning
 In Nazi Germany, the main meaning of Aryan was considered to be 'non-jewish' and Aryans were recognized by features such as blonde hair and blue eyes
 Hindu religion today is only the leftover of the most ancient civilization of the world, note the word the most, Aryan
 Even Swami vivekanand did not want that religion to die uselessly therefore he founded an organization called Arya Samaj
 see http: / / en
wikipedia
org / wiki / Aryan for more information 9)-cheetah:- This is again taken as on base word
 It has the same meaning as Hindi word Cheetah Tiger
 10) - Chit: - This word is taken from Indian word Chitthi which means letter
 In english it means a short letter or a note by someone
 11)-bangles:- This is a form of Indian ornaments that are very famous in India
 you can see all the women wearing them
 and they are so long rooted in indian civilization that you can trace them in Indian rituals, traditions, and sacred customs too
 It comes from the word Bangdi with the same meaning a bracelet
 12) -juggernaut: - Something, such as a belief or an institution, that elicits blind and destructive devotion or to which people are ruthlessly sacrificed
from the name of the Hindu deity Krishna - Juggernath / Jaganath 13)-pariah :- a social outcast

 His reputation as a city-planner settling the new city of 'sawai Jayanagar', Jaipur, in 1727, a very beautiful, well-organized, convenient and based on the principles of craftsmanship, six miles south of Amber, is immortalized in Indian history

 Aurangzeb gave him the title of 'sawai' - which symbolically means that he was 'sawaiya' from his contemporaries
 suna jaataa he jab dilli badshaah aurangzeb ke darbar main yuva savai jaisingh pehle-pahal hajir hue, to pataa nahin kyon aurangzeb ne ekaek balak jaisingh ke donon haath pakad liye or poocha "ab bataaiye, aap kya karenge?" is par pratyutpannmati jaisingh hothon par muskaan liye nihaayat shant swar se bole, "alampanaah ! hamaare yahaan hinduon main vivaah par ek parampara he

Today, the King Salamat himself is not one of my hands, when i have taken both my hands in my hand, then what do i care about? "aurangzeb did not expect this clever reply, but he was very pleased with this wise presence
 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
 with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out, "you are more than a man, you are sawa- ie, a hundred and twenty five per cent hero ' kuch duusare strot batalaate hai 'savai' kii oopaadhi aurangzeb dwaara nahin balki badshaah farrukh sier dwaara inhen di gayi thi
 But this fact is associated with Aurangzeb in most texts

 When he had disobeyed many royal orders, the king eventually sent some of them to Amer to bring them 'forcibly'
 Annoyed by his absence, Emperor Aurangzeb did not take away the title of Amer Raja from him, but on 13 September 1701, he was 'demoted', making him a modest mansabdar of only 500 castes, 100 riders
 kathin maarg or varsha se avaruddh raaston se jujhate burhanpur main padaav daal kar oktober 1701 main inke dakshin main pahunchne par inhen aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke paas panhala kii suraksha ke liye unka sainya-sahyogi niyukt kiya gaya

 is khilanaa-vijay par badshaah aurangzeb dwaara inkaa mansab badha kar pehle ek hazaar, phir shah bidarbakht ke anurodh ke baad 2000 kaa kar diya gaya
 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made
 ' The irony is that Aurangzeb, who once honored him by calling him 'sawai', was later so annoyed and prejudiced that he issued this insulting command - "by not giving Jayasinha a seat on Masnad, laying on the ground below"
 Ask to sit on Sujani! " isi bich i0 1704 main do baadashahi faujadaaron ne sthaneey madad le kar thakur kushal singh rajaavat se savai madhopur main aaj sthit jhilaay thikaane kii jaagir chin kar 13 navambar 1704 ko jaisingh ko saunp di

 At the end of the war, the king of Jai Singh Bundi met his brother-in-law Budhsinh Hada in the battle of victory, but he did not give them a special welcome
 , Jaisingh's younger brother Vijay Singh wanted to get his sister married to Emperor Bahadur Shah to please the emperor

 badshaah ne inke jabt kiye rajya waapas lautaa die or in donon ko 4000 jaat 4000 savaar ke mansab bhi diye
 Even at that time, the Rajputs had no faith in the Mughals, so when Sawai Jaisingh went to the Emperor's camp in Ajmer, all the mountains and valleys of Ajmer were filled with Rajput soldiers
 mansab badhane or ilaake waapas aane par bhi unhen bahadurshah kii niyat par kabhi bhi purna vishwaas nahin hua
 Something happened to Jaisingh's brother Vijay Singh too that after being disappointed, he finally left the Mughal court and came to Hindaun

 jaisingh ne badshaah farrukh sier ko bahut samajhaayaa ki saiyadon se yuddh karke unhen hameshaa ke liye saaf kar dena chahie

 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya

 Finally, At Singh took Jaisingh with him to Jodhpur where he married his daughter to Jaisingh
 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden
 Even at that time, Jai Singh did not believe in At Singh Jodhpur, so he wore Jirhabkhtar even in his marriage

 He gave him a big welcome

 inhone deepasingh kumbhani ko sahu ke paas satara bheja
 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
 isse rajasthan main jaipur or bundi ke bich lambe samay tak bada du:khad sangharsh chalaa

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg akshapaad, nyayasutra ke rachayita acharya
 The name of the creator of the famous jurist is named Maharishi Gautam or in the judiciary of Padmapuran, Skandapuran and Vishwanath
 iske vipareet nyaaybhashya, nyaayavarthik, taatparytika tathaa nyaayamanjari aadi vikhyath nyaayashastreey granthon main akshapaad in sutron ke lekhak maane gaye hai
 According to Mahakavi Bhasa, the name of the creator of jurisprudence is Medhatithi
 in vibhinn maton kii ek vaakyata siddh kii ja sakati he
 According to Mahabharata, Gautama Medhatithi is not one of two different people but one person
 gautam spashtatah vanshabodhak akhya he tathaa medhatithi vyaktibodhak sangya he
 Akshapada's semantics is - 'feet in the eye'
 faltah is naam ko sarthakata siddh karne ke liye anek kahaniyaan garh lee gai hai jo sarvatha kalpit, niraadhaar or pramaan shunya hai
 Many scholars have written about Naiyayik Gautama
 mahamahopadhyaay pan
 harprasad shastri kaa kahana he ki chini bhashaa main nibaddh pracheen bhartiya granthon ke anuwaad ke aadhaar par gautam, buddha ke pehle ho gaye the parantu unke naam par prachlit nyayasutra isa kii duusari shatabdi kii rachana he
 Satishchandra Vidyabhushan is of the opinion that the Gautami Dharmasutra and the Nyasutra Karta must have been the same Gautamnamdhari
 ye buddha ke samakaleen rahe honge tathaa inkaa samay 6thi shatabdi isa purv ho saktaa he
 But Vidyabhushan also believes that this Gautama may have composed only the first chapter of the Nyasutra
 baad ke chaar adhyay kisi or ne bahut baad main likhe honge
 Pro
 According to Yakobi, the Nyasutra must have been written after Nagarjuna was founded by nihilism and before the growth of scienceism because it denies nihilism but does not deny scienceism
 parantu pro
 sherwatski ke anusaar nyayasutra main vigyaanavaad kii ore bhi sanket kiya gaya he
 Hence, it will be composed after 500 AD
 parantu sherwatski kaa yah mat nyayasutra ko na samajhane ke kaaran bhramamoolak he
 According to Athalle and Bodas, the editors of Tarkasangraha, Gautama's Nyasutras precede Kanad
 shabaraswami ne upavarsh se uddhran diya he jisase lagata he ki upavarsh nyaay se parichit the
 If this is the minister of Mahapadma Nanda this year, then Gautam should be 400 BC
 Will have to believe pro
 suali ke anusaar ye sutara 300-350 i
 ke kaal ke hai
 According to Richard Garvey, justice is the oldest in theistic philosophies because there is no mention of it before the beginning of the year AD
 at: ye sutara 100-300 i
 ke bich likhe gaye honge
 It is absolutely impossible to say which of these opinions is correct
 nyaysutron kii rachana tathaa gautam kaa kaal in do prashnon par alag alag vichaar hona chahie
 As far as the Nyasutras are concerned, surely these sutras are written after the development of Buddhism
 itnaa or bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki is nyayasutra main samay-samay par sanshodhan tathaa parivardhan hote rahe hai
 But the name of Gautama is not related to these sutras because all these sutras in their present form are unfamiliar with Gautama
 gautam ko ham sirf nyaayashastra kaa pravartak kah sakate hai, sutron kaa rachayita nahin
 It may be that Gautama has written some sutras, but those sutras have become so mixed in other sutras that it is impossible for us to separate them
 in drushtiyon se hamen vidhyabhushan kaa mat adhik maanya lagata he
 Gautama is also known as Akshpad
 vidhyabhushan gautam ko akshapaad se pruthak maanate hai
 The commentators and other lecturers of the Nyasutra consider Akshpad and Gautama to be one
 'akshapaad' shabd kaa arth hota he 'jiske pair main ankhen hon'
 Grammar is familiar with the principles of Mahabhashya Gautama
 nyaysutron main paanch adhyay hai or ye hi nyaay darshan ke mul aadhaar granth he
 Their review shows that the judiciary was spiritually predominant in the beginning, that is, it was the objective to make a real decision on the nature of the soul
 tark tathaa yukti kaa yah sahaara avashya letaa tha, parantu aatma ke swaroop kaa parichay in sadhano ke dwaara karana hi iskaa mukhya taatpary tha
 The theory of that era was that the process which can gain knowledge of self-realization is right and valid
 usase vitarip maanya nahin hoti: But later, in the philosophy of justice, that logic system was specially introduced by which the soul's separation from the soul can be understood well and in which the means of litigation, jalp, vitanda, deceit, caste etc
 are used
 in tarkpradhan nyaysutron ke rachayita akshapaad prathit hote hai
 There is a clear reference to the achievement of the thoughts of both the eras in the current judgments
 nyaayadarshan ke mul rachayita gautam medhatithi hai or uske prati sanskrit-naveen vishyon kaa samavesh kar mul granth ke sanshodhak-akshapaad hai
 The famous treatise of Ayurveda, Charaka Samhita is also the culmination of this ritual system
 mul granth ke praneta maharishi agnivesh hai, parantu iske pratisanskarta charak maane jate hai
 Nyayasutra is likewise a text recited by Akshpad
 gautam nyaayashastra ke pravartak hai
 Examining the meaning on the basis of the evidence is called 'justice', hence it is mainly the evidence
 prameya kaa bhi is darshan main vichaar kiya gaya he par vah gaun ho gaya he
 What is knowledge, how it is produced, how many sources are there for its origin, who are the faults of those sources, their discussion is a matter of justice
 bhartiya parampara main 'nyaay' shabd angreji logic yaa tarkshastra kaa paryaayavachi he
 Buddhists and Jains have also practiced their rationale and they are also called Buddhnanya and Jaina
 par jahaan keval nyaay shabd kaa prayog hua he vahaan 'nyaay' se sampradaay dwaara pratipaadit siddhanton kaa hi grahan hota he
 The original book of this sect is Nyasutra which has five chapters and each chapter is divided into two temporals
 saare sutron kii sankhya 530 he
 The first chapter generally describes the 16 subjects which are detailed in the subsequent four chapters
 duusare adhyay main sanshay tathaa pramaanon kaa vivechan he
 The propounding themes of the third chapter are soul, body, senses, subjects of senses, knowledge and mind
 chaturth adhyay ichha, dukh, klesh or moksh ke swaroop kaa vivechan karte hue bhram ke swaroop tathaa avyav evam avyavi ke sambandh par bhi prakaash daalata he
 The fifth chapter discusses caste and exile
 pramaan, prameya, sanshay, prayojan, drushtaant, siddhant, avyav, tark, nirnay, vaad, jalp, vitanda, hetvabhaas, chal, jati, or nigrahasthaan in 16 vishyon ke tatvagyan se ni:shreyas kii prapti nyaayashastra main maani gai he
 Knowledge arises from these four evidences, direct, inference, subhuman and word
 vaisheshik darshan main sweekrut saat padaarthon kaa prameya main atanrbhaav ho jaataa he
 That is why the later lawyers have associated justice with Vaishyasik
 nyaay main mukhyat: vadavivaad kii paddati kaa varnan he
 How a theory is presented, how many objections can be made to the theory, how they can be avoided, these are the main manifestations of justice, it is said that Gautama was the first to prescribe a sentence with five components of inference
 Used
 greek darshanik arestu ke anusaar anumaan teen hi vaakyon main sampann hota he
 According to Vidyabhushan, the imaginary of the sentence in Indian justice has arisen from the influence of Aristotle
 parantu professor kith kaa mat he ki nyaay kii praarambhik avasthaa main greek vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav maanane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Gautama's imagination of the Panchavayava sentence is a product of his brain
 bhartiya darshan prasthaanon main nyaay sambhavat: sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee prasthaan rahaa he
 The principles propounded in the Nyasutras were refuted by the Buddhist Acharya Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kaa uttar dene ke liye vatsyayan ne nyaysutron par bhashya kii rachana kii
 Udyotkar wrote judicially to refute the objections made by Buddhist naïveté Dinang over Vatsyayana
 nyaayavarthik par nyaayavarthik taatparytika tathaa usapar tikaparishuddhi kii rachana kramash: vachaspati mishra or udayan ne kii
 Apart from these texts, Nyayamanjari is an independent interpretation of the Nyasutras
 navyanyay ke pravartak gangeshopadhyaay ne tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne bhi gautam dwaara pradarshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hue anek granth likhe
 The judiciary has influenced many Indian philosophies and inspired them by offering a rationale
 nyaay hi ek aisa sampradaay he jisapar aaj bhi panditon main vishad rup se charchaa chal rahi he
 It is difficult to say whether Gautama was an theist or not because there is no clear instruction of God in his sutras
 baad main ishwar kaa pratipaadan nyaay kii ek visheshta hi ho gai
 According to justice in salvation, the soul devoid of all its qualities and remains in its pure form
 buddhi, sukh, du:kha, ichha, dwesh, praytn or sanskaron se pare aatma jab du:khabhaav rup anand kii avasthaa main avasthit ho jaati he, use mukt kehete hai
