 The Mahar Scouts and their forces were recruited by the Maratha king Shivaji as soldiers in the fort
 unka ek bada hissaa banane company ke bombay sena ke chathe hisse main east india company company dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 The Bombay Army favored the Mahar soldiers for their bravery and loyalty to the flag and also because they could be trusted during the anglo-maratha War
 ve kai safaltaaon hasil kii he, koregaanv kii ladaai, jahaan mahaar bahul company sainikon ko ek bahut bada peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main parajeet main bhi shaamil he
 The battle was celebrated by an obelisk, the Koregaon Pillar, which went on to raid the summit of the Mahar Regiment until Indian independence
 bombay sena kii mahaar sainikon ne 1857 ke bhartiya vidroh] main karrwai ko dekha, or do regimenton main shaamil ho gaye is regiment ke british yuddh tahat vidroh "bolo hindustan kii jai" he
 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon ke liye antim jhatka, 1892 main aayaa jab yah "varg regimenton" santhaan ko bhartiya sena main nirnay liya gaya
 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools

 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai

 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors

 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai

 From these events, it is known that butterflies that are not distasteful to their predators take the form of butterflies that are known to be uninteresting in eating their enemies
 pranivigyon kaa kahana he ki aruchikar titliyon ke pankhons kaa chatak rang abhidrishy chihri tathaa vishesh chitrakaari unke pitraikon par prakritik chunaav ke prabhaav ke kaaran viksit hui he

 The butterfly Hastia lidocono of Philippine islands is white and black and has wings similar to paper
 philipine kii ek duusari titali palileyon edides iskaa rup dhaaran karti he
 In the same way, the butterfly Opliais Midamus is followed by Papilio paradoxus

 These tropical butterflies have the same shape and size as the butterflies of the eastern Danainian dynasty, and some species of butterflies from North America and Africa follow them
 yah dekha gaya he ki nar kii apeksha maadaa adhik anuharan karti he
 When both males and females follow, females are more similar to males than males
 is sambandh main yah samaran rakhane yogya baat he ki maadaa titali main nar kii apeksha parirvanshkyata adhik pai jaati he
 It is clear that as the female has greater variability, the function of natural selection becomes more palpable and the result is more satisfactory, that is, the simulator is more similar than the simulator
 uparilikhit udhaaharan betsian anuharan ke hai
 The name is derived from the fact that it was first known by Sarpratham Batesi

 yah spasht he ki jo jatiyaan swayan aruchikar or hanikar hai unhen kisi duusari hanikar jati kii nakal karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It was observed that the butterflies of the Ethomyini and Heliconini lineages, which are both called distasteful, were satisfactorily interpreted by Fitts Müller
 mular ne bataaya he ki is prakaar ke anuharan main jitani jatiyon kii titliyaan bhaag leti hai un sabko jeevanasgharsh main laabh hota he
 It is clear that many butterflies are killed by the butterflies' sutras to gain the experience that such colored butterflies are harmful
 jab kai ek aruchikar jati kii titliyaan ek samaan rang yaa rup dhaaran kar leti hai to shatruon kii shiksha ke liye anivaary jivanash kai jatiyon main bant jaataa he or kisi ek jati ke liye jeevanahaani kii maatra kam hoti he
 According to Wallace, there should be five things in each passage
 yah nimnlikhit hai: The simulating caste is to be found in the same area and at the same place where the simulated caste is found
 anukaran karanevaale anukrit se adhik asurakshit hon
 Followers should be less in number than followers
 anukaran karanevaale apane nikat sambandhiyon se bhinn hon
 The simulation should always be external
 yah kabhi aantarik sanrachanaon tak na pahunche
 The first thing is fulfilled in most situations, but not always
 araginnis hikebinyas naamak titali danise plaxippas kaa rup ghaaran karti he
 Both meet in Lanka, but in different places
 yah kaha jaataa he ki iskaa kaaran yah he ki inke shatru pravraji pakshi hai, jo ek sthaan duusare sthaan ko jate rahete hai or ek jagah praapt anubhav kaa prayog duusari jagah kar sakate hai
 Similarly, the butterfly named Hypolimnus missippus is found in Africa, India and Malaya
 iske nar kaa anuharan athima packteta or limenitis elbomaculata karti hai, kintu ye donon jatiyaan china main pai jaati hai
 Its interpretation is also dependent on the fact that their enemies are Pravaji birds
 duusare niyam kii bhi lagbhag sabhi sthitiyon main purti hoti he
 The third rule is only fulfilled in certain situations, not always
 pepiliyon politas apane anukrit kii donon jatiyon kii apeksha sankhya main adhik hoti hai
 Similarly, the butterfly and the condition called Arconias terrias are interpreted on the basis that these events are of Mulerian following, not of Batesian avoidance
 anuharan karanevaali titliyon par janan sambandhi kuch prayog bhi kiye gaye hai
 The simulated form of papilio polytas develops due to a paired pyrrhc, which suppresses normal pyrrhino
 yah nar main bhi vartmaan rahata he, kintu iskaa prabhaav nar main vidyaman ek anya damankaaree pitraik ke kaaran anuharan nahin he
 According to them, such an analogy arises from the influence of environment or sexual choice in the descendants of a place, or due to the perception of mental experience
 par in aadhaaron par antarvasheey saadrishy kii sab ghatnaon kii vyakhya nahin kii ja sakati
 When unnecessary due to excessive rules and controls, it is called red tape

 avasthaa sameekaran kaa taatpary us ganitiya sutara se he jiske dwaara kisi samshti kii avasthaa main kisi vastu ke aaytan, daab or taap ke sambandh kaa bodh ho
 If two of these quantities are known, then the third will depend on both of them in a certain way and its value can be known from the state equation
 byal or charles ke niyamon seium=rt sambandh praapt hota he, jo adarsh gas ke liye avasthaa sameekaran he
 Gases closely follow this under high temperature and pressure conditions, but in normal circumstances this equation does not accurately describe the behavior of any real gas
 vaastavik gaisen adarsh gas sameekaran se bahut vichlit hoti hai, isaki pushti baad main or adhik daab par prayog karke nateror, sendrus or keine ne kii
 Andrews' experiments are of fundamental importance because they throw much light on the actual behavior of gases and are the basis of the critical state equation that has been presented by vandarwals
 vandervals kaa avasthaa sameekaran nimna he- Where a { \ displaystyle a} and b { \ displaystyle b} are constants which depend on the particular gas
 inkaa maan krantik gundharmon se nikaala ja saktaa he
 pc, t c { \ displaystyle p_ {c}, T_ {c}} and v c { \ displaystyle V_ {c}} ise is prakaar bhi likh sakate hai- This equation, proposed in 1873, produced much better results than the ideal gas equation
 is sameekaran main a { \ displaystyle a} aakarshan parameter or b { \ displaystyle b} pratikarshan parameter athwa prabhavi aanvik aaytan kehalaata he
 This equation resolves most of the deviations from the ideal gas state
 anek anya avasthaa samiran pratipaadit kiye gaye hai
 Some of them are more true than the vanderwals equation between specific limits
 phir bhi is sameekaran kii saralata ko dekhte hue, yah saamanyat: vaastavik gaison ke vyavhaar se paryaapt sannikat he

 In electrical equipment, unwanted short circuits usually occur when the insulation of a wire is removed, or when another conductive material is used, which causes the electric charge to flow through a different path rather than flowing through its specified path

 Such short circuits are more likely to result in very high current and therefore in such a situation, a large number of overflow protection devices are quickly activated

 Because of these differences, the terminology can be confusing, referring to a textbook depiction that a "virtual open circuit" may be just as appropriate because no current flows

 These powerful classes later became the basis of feudalism

 While affirming some of these grounds, Dr
 Satish Chandra opined that "feudalism in Europe was related to two systems, one of which was the agricultural slave system and the other was the military organization
 ’’ is aadhaar par krishi daasatv evam sainik sanghathan donon samantvaad ke mukhya aadhaar he
 On the basis of this analysis, it can be said that feudalism was an administrative system based on decentralization related to the land system in Europe in which feudal was the bridge between the supreme power and the peasants, which were connected to both the parties through fixed contracts
 europe main rajya seva karne ke puraskaar swaroop saamanton ko bhoomi di jaati thi or un saamanton kii prashasnic dekh-rekh main jitna kshetra hota tha, uskaa puraa rajasav unheen ko praapt hota tha kintu vah apane adhinsth logon ke praapt kar main se apane prabhu ko niyamit rup se kuch nazar bhejtaa rahegaa
 The king used to give land to the officers for cash
 jameen un anya logon ko bhi di jaati thi jinako raja puraskrit karnaa chahta tha
 Hence, in European feudalism, peasants had to work for landlords or individuals who were given land and who were called feudal lords

 Prof
 Sijvik has considered feudalism to be the result of four different tendencies
 pehali pravriti ek manushya kii duusare manushya ke saath, jo usase ucchtar str kaa tha, vaiyaktik sambandhon kii thi
 From the point of view of their security, they established a relationship with a powerful person who was personal rather than citizenship
 sarankshak or ashrith ek duusare ke saath vaiyaktik sambandhon ke judaav ke kaaran bandhe hue the
 The guardian used to protect his dependents and his strength increased due to the increasing number of dependents
 duusari pravriti manushya ke adhikaar, rajnatik sthaan tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti ke nirdhaaran karne kii pravriti thi
 In feudalism, the political relationship and social status of a person depends on how much land he owned
 teesri pravriti yah thi ki bade-bade bhupati apane pradeshon main raajnneetik satta kaa prayog karne lage
 This change happened gradually
 unhen yah adhikaar prarambh se praapt nahin tha, kendriya satta kii durbalata ke kaaran jaise-jaise unki shakti badi, unhone apane pradesh kii suvyavastha ke liye apane adhikaron ko badhaayaa or un par shashan karne lage
 The fourth trend was the tendency of segregation of social classes, there were two types of people dependent on the king or feudal

 War was the main principle of the feudal system

 The condition of the lower class was also very lamentable
 ’’ prastut drushtikon main vyakti kii suraksha kii bhaavana par adhik bal diya gaya he evam saamanti sambandhon tathaa anubandhon kii dridhtaa kii ore sanket kiya gaya he
 The lord from whom the person benefited, had to demonstrate his masterly devotion to him
 vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati thi
 According to Henny S
 Lucus, "the feudal organization had an important place in the feudal organization
 prayek saamanti rajkumaar ke adheen anek vesols hote the, jo use apni salaah tathaa yuddh main sahaayta dene ke liye pratibandhit the
 '' shri lukas ke matanusaar raja or samant donon kii parsparik anubandhta siddh hoti he, jiskaa aadhaar parsparik aadan-pradaan tha
 The feudal provided military aid to the king, was entitled to receive the king's advice by giving critical advice to the king
 bewstor mahoday ne apane kosh main samantvaad ke swaroop main prakaash daalate hue likhaa he ki ‘‘yah ek aisi raajnneetik vyavastha thi jo raja or samant ke bhoomi se sambandhit parsparik sambandhon par adhrith thi tathaa jisamen bhoomi praptakarta dwaara seva or aadar-bhaavana swaamitv, sahaayta, vivaah aadi kii ghatnaayen pramukh thi
 '' chambers insaclopeediya main samantvaad vishyak manyataon main swami bhakthi or ajna-paalan par bal dete hue likhaa gaya he ki ‘‘samantvaad shabd yadhyapi samaaj vyavastha kaa ek prakaar he tathaa mukhya rup se un vyakti sambandhon kii vyakhya karata he jo jameen ke adhikaar or vyaktigat sampati ke aadhaar par ek vyakti kii duusare vyakti ke prati adheenta prakat karte he, tathaapi yah vyaktigat sambandhon or niyamon kii us vishisht paddati kii ore sanket karata he jisamen ek ore suraksha tathaa nirvaah he tathaa duusari ore seva tathaa ajna paalan he
 Thus, the responsibility of the security of the feudal subsistence and feudalism: social and economic development process was on the Lord
 saath hi samant prabhu kii ajnapaalan or seva bhakthi se anubandhit tha
 On non-compliance, the king could only in principle remove him from the land by withdrawing it

 This system changed over time

 Then he also provided the land received on the same terms on which he had received it from the king
 is prakaar saamanti vyavastha vanshanugat rup se chalane lagi
 That view can be seen in the context of the confirmation of the aforesaid opinion
 ‘‘saamanti pratha vanshanugat thi
 After the death of Samanta, his successor was made his lord, who used to visit the state court and presented his lord's devotion to the king by offering something
 ’’ Thus by the king giving land to the feudal and by the feudal lords to the chieftains below him, hereditary and a new level of feudalism ie sub-feudalism was born
 krishakon kaa sambandh sidhe raja se na hokar ek madhyasth kuleen ucchvarg se hone laga
 Although the practice of money was not completely abolished, it was rarely used, land was used as money
 saamanti vyavastha kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn siddhanth anuvanshikta kaa tha
 The main conclusions that can be drawn when analyzing the views of the aforesaid scholars regarding Western feudalism
 kahin to prabhu or samant ke anubandhatmak sambandhon main nihit kanoonee paksh par bal diya gaya he, kahin saamaajik paksh par kahin aarthik paksh par, kintu kuch aise saamaanya tatv bhi he jinka lagbhag sabhi vichaarkon ke maton main sanket miltaa he
 These common elements include land grants by the Lord and service and obedience by the feudal lords
 inke saath europea samantvaad ke swaroop nirdhaaran main krishi daasatv pratha bhi ek mahatvapurn tatv he
 Under this, the peasants were tied to the land and the real owners of the land were the zamindars who worked as the link between the real tenants and the king

 ’’ There is no broadly accepted modern definition of feudalism
 shabd samantvaad yaa saamanti vyavastha purv aadhunik kaal main gadha gaya tha or aksar raajnneetik or mat prachaar sandarbh main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 By the mid-20th century, François Louis Ganshoff's Fudilism, 3rd ed
, Became a traditional definition of feudalism
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se jab mark bloch ke fudal sosayadi iskaa samavarti hua jab ise pehali baar angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya, kai madhyakaalin itihaaskaaron ne ek vyapak saamaajik pahalu ko isamen shaamil kiya, isamen jameendaari ke band ko joda, jise kabhi-kabhi "saamanti vyavastha" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Since the 1970s, when Elizabeth A
R
 Brown published The Tyranny of a Construction, with many re-examining the evidence and concluding that feudalism is an incurable term and should be removed from scholarly and academic discussion altogether or at least only for serious merit and warning
 It should be used together
 europea sandarbh ke baahar, samantvaad kii avadharana kaa saamaanya taur par saadrishy ke dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he, shogun ke tahat sabase adhik baar japan main charchaa kii jaati he or kabhi-kabhi madhyayugin or gondarine ithiopia
 haalanki, kuch saadrishy samantvaad ko aage liya gaya he, pracheen misr, parthian samrajya, bhartiya upmahadweep or america ke dakshin ladaai ke pehle vividhta ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 The term feudalism is also used — often inappropriately or even predominantly — those applied to medieval Europe — often inappropriately or blasphemously — in non-western countries where institutions and practices were considered to be the same with medieval Europe
 kuch itihaaskaaron or raajnneetik siddhanton kaa maananaa he ki kai myanon main samantvaad shabd kaa prayog iske vishisht arth ko vanchit karne ke liye kiya gaya he jiske chalate samaaj ko samajhane main is upyogi avadharana ko asweekaar kiya gaya he
 The feudalistic version of François Louis Ganshoff describes the mutual legal and military obligations between major wars and revolves around three important concepts of God, vassal, and ownership
 ek prabhu vyapak arth main ek mahaan sandarbh he jo jameen par kabja karata tha, ek jagirdaar bhagwaan ke dwaara jameen ko apanaataa tha or bhoomi ko jaagir ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In exchange for the use of ownership and protection of the lord, the vassal will provide some form of service to the lord
 vahaan kaarykaal saamanti desh ke kai kismein the, jisamen sainya or gaiyr sainya shaamil the
 The form of feudal feudalism was based on the relationship between the lord and the jagirdar, between the obligations and its authority
 isse pehle ki prabhu kisi ko bhoomi anudaan kar sake, unhen us vyakti ko ek jagirdaar bananaa padataa tha
 It was performed in a ceremonial and symbolic ceremony called the Commendation Ceremony and this oath and tribute act was divided into two parts
 shradhanjali ke dauraan swami or maatahat ek anubandh main aate hai jo jagirdaar ko apane aadesh main prabhu ke liye ladane ke li pravesh karnaa hota tha, haalanki prabhu ko bahari takaton se jagirdaar kii raksha karne kaa vaada ke liye sahamat hona padataa tha
 The Shraddhanjali comes from the Latin word Fidelitas and the lord Earth feudal was a vindication of himself by a vassal
 "shrandhanjali" bhi shapath ke liye sanderbhit karata he or adhik spasht rup se shradhanjali ke dauraan kiye gaye jagirdaar kii patibaddhtaon ko pushti karata he
 Such an oath was followed by tribute
 ek baar prashasti samaaroh puraa kiya gaya, prabhu or jagirdaar ke saath ek saamanti sambandh aapasi dayitvon par ek duusare par sahamat the
 The principal responsibility of the lord was "aid", or vassal for military service
 jo bhi upkaran kaa upyog kar jagirdaar milkiyat se rajasav ke aadhaar par praapt kar saktaa he, maatahat ko kol karne ke liye prabhu kii ore se sainya seva karne ke liye uttar jimmedaar tha
 The primary reason for this security of military help was to enter into the feudal lord's relationship
 iske alaava, jagirdaar ko apane prabhu kii anya daayitv ho sakate hai, jaise court main pravesh, chaahe jaagirgari, saamanti yaa raja ke khud ke court main upasthiti
 yah bhi "salaah" pradaan karne ke jagirdaar shaamil saktaa he, isliye yadi prabhu ek bada faisla vah apni sari jagirdaar ko bulaane or ek concil yojit karenge saamana karnaa padaa he
 This agricultural policy at the jagir level may be a fairly mundane matter, but it also involved the handing down of punishment from criminal to criminal offenses, including capital punishment in some cases
 raja kii saamanti adaalat ke sambandh main, is tarah ke vivechna yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke sawaal shaamil ho sakate hai
 These examples are in Europe depending on location and period of time, customs and feudal practices varied, see examples of feudalism

 Feudalism has traditionally emerged as a result of decentralization of an empire

 The cavalry troops came to encompass a more secure area as well as social, political, judicial and economic areas over their allotted land and a system of hereditary rule over their power

 Only when the centralized power to maintain the existence of infrastructure with European monarchies vanished as feudalism eventually began to yield organized power and new power

 Feudalism became a popular and widely used term in 1748,) thanks to the law of Montescui de l'sprit the ruling class of the Lois power of des souls
 His definition is classic feudalism today is the most widely known and the vassal is also an easy way to understand, simply put, when a lord granted a lord, the vassal provided return service to the military

 'antu da last' kaa arth he - is antavaale ko bhi
 Sarvodaya means the rise of all, the development of all
 sarvoday bharat kaa purana adarsh he
 Our sages have sung- "survey Sukhin: Santu"
 sarvoday shabd bhi nayaa nahin he
 Jain monk Samantabhadra says - Sarvapadamantakaram Nirantam Sarvodayam Tirthamidam Tawaiv
 "sarv khalvidan brahm", "vasudaiv kutunbakan", athwa "soham" or "tatvamasi" ke hamaare puraatan aadarshon main "sarvoday" ke siddhant antarnihit hai
 Sarvodaya Samaj was a society of Gandhi's imagination, with the Indian village system at its center
 vinoba ji ne kaha he, sarvoday kaa arth he - sarvaseva ke madhyam se samast praaniyo kii unnati
 We can see the practical nature of Sarvodaya for a very long time in Vinoba's Bhoodan movement
 subahavaale ko jitna, shamwale ko bhi utana hi-pratham vyakti ko jitna, antim vyakti ko bhi utana hi, isamen samanta or advait kaa vah tatv samaaya he, jisapar sarvoday kaa vishaal prasaad khadaa he
 1 self-restraint 2 shoshanheen samaaj 3 all-round development 4 lokaneeti ke aadhaar par shashan 5 decentralization of power "sarvoday" kaa adarsh he advait or uski niti he samanvay
 He wants to end humanized inequality and reduce natural inequality
 jeevamaatr ke liye samaadar or prayek vyakti ke prati sahanubhuti hi sarvoday kaa maarg he
 When this unconquerable flow of sympathy for the living, flows in life, then the lush of Sarvodaya blossoms into a beautiful Suman
 darwin ne kaha-"prakruti kaa niyam he, badi machhlee choti machhlee ko khaakar jivit rahati he
 "huxley said — live and let live
 " sarvoday kahata he-"tum dusron ko jilane ke liye jio
 "to make others yours, love has to expand, non-violence will develop, and end the exploitation and change today's social values
 " "sarvodaya" seeks to establish a classless, casteless and exploitative society in which every individual and group gets the means and opportunities for their all-round development
 vinoba kehete hai-"jab ham sarvoday kaa vichaar karte hai, tab oonch-neech bhaavshaalee varnavyavastha diwaar kii tarah samaane khadi ho jaati he
 Sarvodaya will not be installed without breaking it
 sarvoday ko safal banane ke liye jatibhed mitaanaa hoga or aarthik vishmata dur kerani hogi
 Sarvodaya society will be created only by erasing them
 " "sarvodaya wants such a structure
 Gym should not be destroyed or boycotted by any community on the basis of varna, class, religion, caste, language etc
 sarvoday kii samaajarachna aisi hogi, jo sarv ke nirmaan or sarv kii shakti se sarv ke hit main chale, jisamen kam yaa adhik shaareerik samathrya ke logon ko samaaj kaa sangrakshan samaan rup se praapt ho or sabhi tulya paarishramik ke hakdaar maane jaaen
 In this era of science and democracy, the revolution has the value of everything and it is the standard of all development
 sarv kii kranti main poonji or buddhi main paraspar sangharsh kii gunjaaish nahin he
 They are mutually complementary powers at the same level
 swabhaavat: sarvoday kii samaajarachna main antim vyakti samaaj kii chintaa kaa sabase pehle adhikari he
 Sarvodaya Samaj can be created only on the purification of personal life
 jo vrath niyam vyaktigat jivan main "mukti" ke saadhan hai ve hi jab saamaajik jivan main bhi vyavahrut honge, tab sarvoday samaaj banegaa
 Vinoba says- "the society that will be created from the point of view of Sarvodaya will have to start with its life
 nijee jivan main asaty, hinsa, parigrah aadi hua to sarvoday nahin hoga, kyonki sarvoday samaaj kii vishmata ko ahimsa se hi mitaanaa chahta he
 The aim of the communist is also to remove asymmetry, but for this good purpose, whatever means one can use, but for Sarvodaya, means of purification are also necessary
 " Gandhiji also says- "socialism starts with socialist first
 agar ek bhi aisa samaajawaadee ho, to usapar shunya badaye ja sakate hai
 Every zero will increase its value tenfold, but if the first digit is zero, then how many zeros are increased before it, its value will still remain zero
 " That is why Gandhiji used to emphasize truth, non-violence, astheya, aparigraha, celibacy, taste, bodywork, fearlessness, sarvadharma samvayya, untouchability and observance of Swadeshi etc
 paarishramik kii samanta - jitna vetan nai ko utana hi vetan vakil ko
 This element of "unto This Last" is fully accepted in Sarvodaya
 samyawad bhi paarishramik main samanta chahta he
 This element is the same in both
 pratiyogita kaa abhaav - pratiyogita sangharsh ko janm detii he
 For communists, the struggle is the ultimate element
 parantu sarvoday sangharsh ko nahin, sahakaar ko maanata he
 There is violence in conflict
 sarvoday kaa sara bhawan hi ahimsa kii neenv par khadaa he
 Instrumentation - Communism does not consider instrumentation necessary for the attainment of the practicable
 sarvoday main sadhanshuddhi pramukh he
 The practicable is also pure and the means pure
 anuvanshik sanskaron se laabh uthaane ke liye trustiship kii yojana - vinoba kehete hai-""sampatti kii vishmata kritrim vyavastha ke kaaran paidaa hui he, aisa maanakar use chhod bhi den, to manushya kii shaareerik or bauddhik shakti kii vishmata puri tarah dur nahin ho sakati
 This disparity can be reduced to some degree by teaching and regulation
 kintu adarsh kii sthiti main is vishmata ke sarvatha abhaav kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore, whoever gets the body, intelligence and property of these three, should understand that he has got it for everyone's benefit
 yahi trustship kaa bhav he
 As a trustee, you should use your power and property for the benefit of mankind
 trustiship main aparigrah kii bhaavana nihit he
 There is no place for heredity in communism
 uski niti to abhijatya ke sanhaar kii rahi he
 Decentralization - Sarvodaya wants decentralization of power and property so that exploitation and suppression can be avoided
 kendrikrut audyogikaran ke is yug main to yah or bhi aavashyak ho gaya he
 When this process of decentralization is applied in the matter of power, then it results in a rule-free society
 samyavaadee kii kalpana main bhi rajasatta tej garmi main rakhe hu ghi kii tarah ant main pigal janevaali he
 But before that he should be solid and strong, not just like frozen ghee, but like a hammer struck on Trotsky's head
 
 But Gandhiji has spoken of decentralization and de-independence in all three, middle and end situations
 yahi sarvoday kaa maarg he
 Currently, two methods of ownership of the means of production are prevalent in the world - private ownership and government ownership
 nijee swaamitv poonjeewaad he, sarkaar swaamitv samyawad
 There is exploitation in capitalism, repression in communism
 bharat kii parampara, uski pratibha or uski paristhiti, teenon kii maang he ki vah raajnneetik or aarthik sanghathan kii koi teesri hi paddati viksit kare, jisase poonjeewaad ke "nijee abhikram" or samyawad ke "samuhik hit" kaa laabh to mil jaae, kintu unke dosha se bachaa ja sake
 In Gandhiji's elaborate scheme of "trusteeship" and "gramswarajya" and Vinoba's "gramdan-gram Swarajaya" based on this imagination, both the faults are avoided and the properties are used
 yahan swaamitv na nijee he, na sarkaar kaa, balki gaanv kaa he, jo swytt he
 In this way, this revolution of Sarvodaya is presenting a new system to the world

 sristi kaa saratatva jad padaarth nahin apitu mul chetana he
 Idealism presents the opposite form of inertia or materialism

 The existence of scientific suffixes like number, quality, quantity, etc
 is unquestionable, but the existence of moral suffixes is a matter of dispute
 ham kehete hai- 'aaj mausam bahut acha he'
 Here we describe goodness and with it point out the lack of goodness
 isi prakaar kaa bhed karmo ke sambandh main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Moral suffix is also called ideal
 adarsh ek aisi sthiti he, jo- Some people attribute the value to human imagination
 jo vastu kisi kaaran se hamen aakarshith karti he, vah hamaari drushti main moolyawaan yaa bhadra he
 In contrast, in the idea of aflatun, only suffixes or ideals have a real existence, the existence of sight objects is only a shadow
 ek tisare mat ke anusaar, jiskaa pratinidhitiv arestu karata he, adarsh vaastaviktaa kaa aarambh nahin, apitu 'ant' he
 At the beginning of 'niti', he says that all things are moving towards the ideal

 It is called 'disinterested'
 pracheen yunaan or bharat ke liye nickshreyas yaa sarvshereshth mulya ke swaroop kaa samajhnaa hi niti main pramukh prashn tha
 Regarding the nature of the Disinterested or Supreme Ideal, everyone agrees that it is related to consciousness, but as soon as we want to know which part of consciousness is mediocre, then differences arise
 kuch log kehete hai ki sukh kaa upbhog aisa mulya he
 Some assign this designation to knowledge, intelligence, love or Shiva Sankalpa
 kuch is vikalp main ekwad ko chhodkar anekavaad kii sharan lete hai ore kehete hai ki ek se adhik vastuen sadhymoolya hai kisi vastu ke sadhymoolya hone yaa na hone kaa nirnay karne ke liye doctor moore ne nimnlikhit suzav diya haih kalpana karo ki do vikalpon me purna samanta he, sivaay is bhed ke ki ek vishesh vastu ek viplav main vidyaman he
 Whose existence in these two viplavas seems more appropriate? The object that makes one pandemonium more suitable than the other in such a situation is moderate
 mulyon kaa astitv, unamem shreshthata kaa bhed ore sarvshereshth mulya kaa astitv adarshavaad kii moulik dharna he
 Some other assumptions related to this are also valid for idealists

 Self-interest started with selfishness, but soon selfishness took its place in its cause

 On the other hand, Kant also said that in terms of absolute order, all human beings are equal, no human being is merely a means
 mrityu kii tarah naitik jivan sabhi bhedon ko mitaa detaa he
 No human being above duty, no human being deprived of rights
 is vishay main kaant kaa kathan prasiddh haih jagat main ore iske pare bhi ham shivasankalp ke atirikt kisi vastu kaa bhi chintan nahin kar sakate, jo bina kisi shart ke shubh yaa bhadra ho
 Sukhvadis like John Stuart Mill also said, it is better to have an uncultivated Socrates than a satisfied boar
 mil ne yah nahin dekha ki is sweekruti main vah apane siddhant se hatakar adarshavaad kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Socrates has a spiritual part that is not present in the boar
 tamas hill green ne vistaar se yah bataane kaa ytn kiya he ki aadhunik naitik bhaavana pracheen yunaan kii bhaavana se in do baton main bahut aage badi he-manushya or manushya main bhed kam ho gaya he or jivan main aadhyatmik paksh agrasar ho rahaa he
 In Kant's view, the major part in human nature is the 'moral sense', he realizes that the demand for duty has more authority than all the rest, the moral order is the 'absolute order'
 is sweekruti ke saath naitik swadhinata kii sweekruti bhi anivaary ho jaati he
 'you must, so you can
 ' yogyata ke abhaav main uttardaayitv kaa prashn uth hi nahin saktaa
 Here a difficult situation is presented: is the moral ideal the accomplishment of the best or to go towards it? On attaining the state which we consider to be the best, we only get the best
 jahaan kahin bhi ham pahunche, truti ore apurnataa bani rahati he
 Kant himself has said that our ultimate aim is perfection and it requires eternity for its accomplishment
 kuch vichaarak to kehete hai ki apurnataa kaa kuch ansh rahanaa hi chahie
 Sorto says in his famous book 'moral Values':' Imagine that all values have been attained
 aisa hone par niti kaa kya banegaa? aage badhane ke liye koi adarsh rahegaa hi nahin
 Success will put an end to all efforts and in this way the moral ideal achieved will end in fulfilling life
 is kathinaayee ke kaaran breadle ne kaha ki naitik jivan main aantarik virodh haih saare naitik praytn kaa ant isaki apni hatya he
 Education has been influenced by various philosophical ideologies since time immemorial, but idealism has had the greatest effect on it
 shiksha ke kshetra main adarshavaad ko pramukhataa dene waalon main sarvapratham plato, comenius, pastalogy tathaa frobel ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 According to the idealists, education is a 'consciousness' or 'intellectual process' that develops virtues in a child and makes him a natural being from a natural being
 saanskrithik paramparaayen evam gyaan is kriya ko sampann karne kaa saadhan hai
 The 'goal of accomplishment' of this action is to provide the student an opportunity to feel self-centered and to build their character
 is prakaar adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shiksha vah chetnapurna evam bauddhik prakriya he jisamen guru ke dwaara shishy ko aatmanubhuti karaayi jaati he
 This concept of education shows that education is not a one-way process but a process running between two poles in which one is a polar learner whose basic nature is refined and the other is the polarity teacher who is the basic nature of the child
 By refinement and conversion, it makes him aware of eternal values and ideals so that he moves from a natural being to a spiritual being
 Iwartit possible
 adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar manushya-jivan kaa antim uddeshy aatma-paramatma ke charam swaroop ko jaananaa he, isi ko aatmanubhuti, adarsh vyaktitv kii prapti, ishwar kii prapti tathaa param anand kii prapti kaha jaataa he
 According to the idealists, to know the extreme nature of the soul-god, a man has to cross four steps
 pratham sopan par use apane ‘prakritik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 On the second step, he has to develop his 'social self'
 tisare sopan par use apane ‘maansik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he tathaa antim sopan par use ‘aadhyatmik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 According to the idealistic ideology, human beings are the best creation of God, to whom he has given unlimited powers
 inhen vibhinn shaktiyon evam kshamtaaon ke yoga se vyaktitv kaa nirmaan hota he
 That is why the idealist thinkers consider raising the personality or the manifestation of the various supreme powers and abilities contained in it and taking it towards a good path
 spasht he ki vyakti kaa vyaktitv mahatvapurn hota he or vyakti ke bhautik sharir kii apeksha ‘aatma’ kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Therefore, according to idealism, the aim of human life is to realize this 'soul'
 aatmanubhuti ke liye aatm-prakaashan bhi aavashyak he
 It is necessary to develop the 'social self' for self-publishing
 saamaajik swa ke vikaas kaa arth he-manushya samaaj dwaara sweekrut niyamon kaa paalan karata he, uski pasand saamaajik sweekruti-asweekruti par nirbhar karti he
 Idealists believe that man's greatest feature is his culture, living, customs, language literature, art music and values
 ye hi use prakritik ‘swa’ se saamaajik swa kii ore agrasar karte hai, samaaj evam vaataavaran ke saath bhaleebhanti samaayojan sthapit karne ke liye vyakti ko ‘aatm prakaashan’ kaa avasar milanaa aavashyak he
 Development of 'intellectual self' is necessary for self-publishing
 yah vah sthiti hoti he jab manushya kaa vyavhaar saamaajik sweekruti-asweekruti se niyantrit na hokar uski buddhi evam vivek se niyantrit hota he
 Plato is of the view that a man's intelligence and conscience are the basis of all his ideals, acts and spiritual efforts
 bina buddhi ke gyaan nahin ho saktaa, bina gyaan ke vivek nahin ho saktaa or bina vivek ke satya-asaty, shiv-ashiv evam sundar-asundar main bhed nahin kiya ja saktaa he tathaa satyam shivan sundaram kii prapti nahin kii ja sakati he
 With self-realization, we see the real truth
 adarshavaadiyon kaa vishwaas he ki jab manushya apane ‘prakritik swa’ evam ‘saamaajik swa’ se upar uthakar apane ‘bauddhik swa’ main niyantrit hone lagata he to vah dhire-dhire swatah ‘aadhyatmik swa’ ke kshetra main pravesh karne lagata he
 Plato is of the view that man's tendency is inclined towards Satya, Shiva and Sundaram
 vah sadaiv satya kii khoj main tatpar rahata he or jo kalyankari evam sundar he, use sweekaar karata he tathaa jo kalyankari evam sundar nahin he, uskaa tyaag karata he
 Idealists insist on training humans in this process
 uparyukt lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye shaniah shaniah drushtikon main parivartan laana aavashyak he
 The goal of education should be to get rid of the objectivity of this material world
 kaha bhi gaya he- That is, education is the one who provides liberation
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki aise vyaktitv kaa charam vikaas hi adarshavaadi shiksha kaa uddeshy he jisamen vyakti aatmanubhuti kar satyam, shivan tathaa sundaran kii prapti kar sake
 Realization of self realization is not a natural gift, so one should try to achieve it through constant practice and effort
 adarshavaadi vichaaron ne shiksha ke uddeshyon kaa hi nirdhaaran nahin kiya he apitu uske liye upyukt paathyakram ke swaroop ko bhi nirdhaarit kiya he
 Because achieving the objectives of education is possible only when the curriculum is also according to it
 adarshavaad vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa utkarsh athwa aatmanubhuti ke shaashvat aadarshon kii prapti tathaa saanskrithik bhautik jagat ko antim satya nahin maanata kintu satya kaa abhas to maanata hi he isi bhautik jagat main rahakar evam bhautik vaataavaran ke sahyog se hi adarshavaad charam satya ko praapt karne kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 The spiritual environment of man is more important but natural environment cannot be ignored
 vyakti sharir or man kaa sanyog hota he or isamen man adhik mahatvapurn hota he
 But idealists believe that if physical needs are not met, mental activity will also become painful
 vyakti aatmanubhuti kii ore tabhi bad saktaa he jab uskaa shaareerik vikaas ho chukaa hota he
 Therefore, knowledge of the physical world is necessary
 unani darshanik plato ke anusaar shiksha kaa charam lakshya ishwar kii prapti he
 Therefore, emphasis should be given on including the same subjects in the curriculum through which the said goal can be achieved
 is lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye sarvapratham satyam, shivan tathaa sundaran in teenon tatwon ko praapt karnaa aavashyak he
 These three spiritual values are attained by the intellectual, moral and artistic activities of man respectively
 atah plato paathyacharya main unheen vishyon evam kriyaaon ke samavesh par bal dete hai jo maanav ko uparyukt kriyaaon main dakshata pradaan kare
 He has said that language, literature, history, geography, mathematics and physical science are important for intellectual activities
 naitik kriyaaon ke liye dharm, nitishastra, tathaa aadhyatmashaastra kaa or kalatmak kriyaaon ke liye vibhinn kalaon tathaa sangeet kaa samavesh kiya tha
 Idealist thinker Horn sir looks for solid grounds in determining the character of a person under ideal society
 atah unke anusaar ve sabhi anubhav, kriyaayen tathaa jivan kii paristhitiyaan aadi jo adarsh kii purnataa kii ore hamen le jaati hai
 They should give important place in the syllabus
 unka vichaar he- In other words, he has recommended inclusion of subjects related to earning and earning
 german shikshashasthri harbart manushya kii aadhyatmik unnati ke liye charitra evam naitik vikaas par bal dete hai or uske liye paathyacharya main bhashaa, sahitya, itihaas, kala tathaa sangeet ko mukhya sthaan dete hai
 According to him, geography, mathematics and science should be given secondary place in the curriculum
 yadhyapi tii0pi0 nan mahoday ne shiksha ke vyaktivaadee uddeshy kaa prabal samarthan kiya he kintu paathyakram-nirmaan ke sambandh main ve adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke samarthak hai
 He is of the view that the duty of the school is not merely to impart a certain type of formal education but it is his duty to support the advancement of the spiritual power of his society and nation
 uske aitihaasik kram evam samskritiyon ko surakshit rakhe or uske bhavishya ko nirantar ujjwal banane kaa safal praytn karen
 Therefore, the child should be trained in school for two major activities - one is the actions which will advance the personal and social life of the child and the other are those activities which determine the initial nature of human civilization
 saranshtah yah kaha jaataa he ki adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shiksha ke paathyakram main sthirataa na hokar gatishiltaa honi chahie, jisase baalkon kii aavashyaktaanusaar unamem parivartan kiya ja sake
 From this point of view, while on the one hand idealists give importance to physical education in their curriculum, on the other hand they also give importance to subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Earth Geography, Astronomy, Geology, Botany, Biology etc
 for the knowledge of the natural environment
 balak ke atmik vikaas ke liye kala, sahitya nitishastra, dharm-darshan, sangeet ityadi vishyon ko adarshavaadi adhik mahatvapurn maanate he
 It is often thought that idealism determines the goals and objectives of education, not the teaching method
 parantu vaastaviktaa yah he ki adarshavaad shiksha ke uddeshyon evam aadarshon par adhik bal dete hue bhi shiksha paddati kii avhelnaa nahin karata he
 According to the idealist ideology, the teaching method should be such that the personality of the child can be developed
 kisi bhi shikshan paddati ko uttam tabhi kaha ja saktaa he jabaki vah baalkon ko apni buddhi, yogyata, ruchi, shakti, samarthy evam aavashyaktaa ko drushti main rakhte hue inhen gyaan pradaan karne main sahaayak siddh ho sake
 According to idealism, once a person has clearly defined the purpose of education, then it becomes secondary that by which methods he will achieve those objectives
 atah jab jo pravidhi shikshak athwa shikshaarthi ke liye upyukt ho, tab use angikaar kar lene main koi haani nahin
 That is why he does not hesitate to adopt the game system
 frobel ne shikshan paddati ko multah ‘aatm-prerit kriya’ mana he
 Education by sport is also a distinction of education through self-action
 khel ke vishay main frobel ne likhaa he- 'khel balak ke liye uske antarjagat evam vahya-jagat kaa darpan he
 This is a tendency to express life and passion
 ' Idealists respect ancient literature
 ve maanate hai ki hamaare pracheen sahitya main purvajon dwaara khoja hua gyaan bharaa padaa he, hamen usase laabh uthaanaa chaiye
 He favors the 'swadhyaya Vidhi' for the study of ancient literature
 parantu is vidhi kaa prayog shiksha ke ucch str par hi ho saktaa he
 Western idealist thinkers have developed many teaching methods
 aajkal ‘prashnottar-vidhi’ kii vishesh charchaa rahati he
 Idealists such as Socrates used this method 450 years before Christ
 sucraat kii shikshan – vidhi upyukt prashnon dwaara vaartalap par aadhaarit thi
 Socrates' disciple Plato also followed the Socratic method
 plato ne prashnottar vidhi ke aadhaar par samvaad vidhi kaa vikaas kiya
 Plato also wrote most of his compositions in dialogue form
 plato ke shishy arestu ‘aagaman’ evam nigaman vidhiyon par bal dete the
 In the incorporation method, 'from the general to the special' and in the arrival method 'from the special to the general'
 aadhunik adarshavaadi darshanikon main hegal ne ‘tark-vidhi’, pastalogy ne ‘abhyaas vidhi’ tathaa rene decort ne ‘saral se jatil’ kii ore chalane main apni ruchi pradarshit kii
 The idealist does not consider the 'lecture method' or study method to be unacceptable
 saakshaat anubhav shreshth he, kintu vishwa kii sabhi vastuon kaa gyaan pratyaksh anubhav dwaara praapt karnaa maanav ke liye asambhav he
 Therefore, the idealist sees no harm in benefiting from the experience of another
 isliye wahi-kahin par vyaakhyaan vidhi ko apnaane main bhi adarshavaadi nahin hichakataa he
 He also takes shelter of collective discussion and advises to take refuge in the debate method to clarify important topics
 jahaan shishuon ko ‘katha vidhi’ dwaara shiksha dene kaa adarshavaadi prastaav karata he vahiin kishoron ko ‘naatak-vidhi’ evam ‘vaartalap- vidhi’ se shiksha dene kii vakaalat karata he
 Harbart has taken shelter of 'panchapadi' to bring new knowledge to the students
 prasiddh adarshavaadi pastalaji ke anusaar shikshan 44vidhi mastishk ke vikaas ke anuhvap honi chahie or unhone apni vidhi ko ‘aanshang’ ke naam se pukaara he
 Pastology has given its method of abstract number, form and language
 prakrutivaadee shikshak ko shikshan-prakriya main naganya samajhate hai or unhen parde ke peeche hi rahane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Idealist thinkers say the opposite
 adarshavaad ke anusaar shikshak kaa sthaan shikshan prakriya main sarvopari he
 The teaching process is not mechanical
 isamen ek vyaktitv kaa duusare par prabhaav padataa he
 The child who is ultimately a person - not a body, his development is possible only through an impressive personality
 isliye shikshak kaa vyaktitv prabhaavshaalee hona chaiye
 At birth, the child has many powers latent
 shikshak kaa kaary in sushupt shaktiyon ko jaagrath karnaa he
 In Indian idealism, giving the best place to the teacher, calling him 'tridev', it has been said that - 'gururbrahma, Gururvishnu, Gurudevo Maheshwara' means Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar
 isi prakaar atharvaveda ke ‘brahmacharya sookt’ main acharya ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki ‘aacharyon mrityurvarunah, som oshadhyah-praayah
 'that is, the Guru destroys the old rites and imparts new samskaras and gives new life to the child, hence he is called the mortuary
 guru man ke kusanskaron ko dho detaa he isliye use varun kaha gaya he
 He leads the way to peace
 isliye som ke samaan tathaa kathinaayee rupi rogon se dur karne ke kaaran use aushadhi kii sangya di gayi
 Therefore, idealistic thinkers emphasize the need of a teacher for the internal or spiritual development of the child
 shiksha-vyavastha main shikshak chaatr ke jivan kaa maarg-darshak hota he
 He gives them the opportunity to develop their natural powers in the right direction by following proper guidance
 shikshak shikshan-prakriya kii dhuree he
 Without it, the teaching process will be incomplete
 adarsh evam lakshya tathaa jivan ke mulya pehle se hi vidyaman hai
 According to Plato, they already exist
 shikshak kaa yah daayitv he ki vah baalkon ke sarvonmukhi vyaktitv ke vikaas kaa prayaas kare taaki ve apane lakshyon ko saralata se praapt kar saken
 In this way, idealistic thinkers emphasize the need for a teacher to convert a child from a natural being to a social and spiritual being
 suprasiddh adarshavaadi frobel ne vidhyalay rupi upavan main balak rupi sukomal paudha ke sarvottam vikaas ke liye shikshak hvapi mali kii ati aavashyaktaa bataaya he
 According to idealism, for proper development of 'learner', representing the place of 'teacher' has written- shikshak ke atyadhik mahatv ke kaaran hi adhikansh vidwaan adarshavaadi shiksha ko ‘shikshak kendrit shiksha’ kii sangya dete hai
 In idealism, discipline is considered necessary for appropriate education
 adarshavaadi vichaarak shiksha main anushaasan ke kathor pakshpaati hai
 According to this ideology, the child should not be given complete freedom
 is sambandh main adarshavaad evam prakrutwad main bhinn mat hai
 Naturalists believe more in freedom of education
 jabaki adarshavaadi shiksha- anushaasan main
 In this regard, Thomas and Lang wrote - "the slogan of naturalists" is freedom
 jabaki adarshavatiyon kaa naaraa anushaasan he
 "idealist thinkers believe that giving complete freedom to a child is more likely to harm, less to gain
" atah balak ko simit swatantraaa hi pradaan kii jaay
 Idealism emphasizes discipline, but is not in favor of repressive discipline because the discipline established by rigorous control and established by oppressive means is often terrible
 isliye anushaasan kaa swaroop prabhavatmak hota he
 For this, idealism gives importance to the development of moral qualities
 naitik gunon ke vikaas ke liye namrata, eemaandaaree, samay kii paabandi, aagyaakaarita, satyavadita ityadi gunon kaa vikaas aavashyak he jo anushasanpurn vaataavaran main hi sambhav he
 In idealistic conception, the establishment of discipline in the child is possible only by the development of 'self-motivated interest', because the child who has his own interest, accepts the same interest
 The interest arises from within the person due to a certain tendency
 is
 chunki anushaasan ruchi par aadhaarit hota he
 Hence, its inspiration also comes from within
 vyakti, jis kaary ko aatm vibhor hokar karegaa vahaan uchhrikhanlata, udandta athwa anushaasanheenataka koi sthaan nahin he
 Discipline will naturally be established there
 anushaasan ke sambandh main adarshavaad kii ek anya manyata yah he ki yah puraskaar athwa dand se sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The child does not do any good work in the greed of the prize
 sadgunon ke liye puraskaar kii vyavastha bhi vidhyalay main nahin honi chaiye
 There is no need to ask for any truth
 yah to maanav kartavya hi he
 It must be done
 balak koi kaary isliye karata he ki uski us kaary main vaastavik ruchi hoti he tathaa usase use vaastavik anand kii prapti bhi hoti he
 In this way the foundation of 'atmanushasan' is laid in the child and in the course of time he remains disciplined
 adarshavaadi pastalogy ke anusaar balak ke prati sahanubhuti barti jaye
 According to Froebel, control over the child should be done on the basis of knowledge of his interest and by publishing sympathy and love, because the inspiration of discipline comes from within
 is mat kii pushti main horn mahoday kaa yah kathan uchit prathit hota he ki ‘anushaasan kaa prarambh vahya rup se hota he kintu ant aatm-niyantran dwaara aantarik rup main ho
 ' kisi vastu, kriya athwa vichaar kaa moolyankan kinhi purv nishchit mandandon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 These standards can be personal as well as social, psychological as well as scientific as well as inferior and multifaceted
 jo mandand jitna adhik vastunishth hota he or jitne adhik vyaktiyon ko maanya hota he
 That is considered to be a good criterion
 yahan aisa hi prayaas kiya gaya he or adarshavaadi shiksha kaa moolyankan bhartiya samaaj kii vartmaan paristhitiyon or bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon evam aakankshaon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 If we evaluate the idealism in relation to the ideas presented by the idealists in relation to the various organs of education mentioned above, then we get to know many of its merits and demerits
 shiksha ke sandarbh main adarshavaad ke prabhaav, gun athwa yogadan nimnlikhit hai- The objectives of education proposed by the idealists build the best character of children
 unhone shiksha kaa ek ullekhneey uddeshy baalkon main satyam, shivan evam sundaran aise gunon kaa vikaas mana he jo achche charitra ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Idealism has played a very important role in determining the objectives of education
 adarshavaadi vichaarkon ke anusaar balak ek shastreey praani ke rup main kuch mul pravritiyon ko lekar janm letaa he or use samaaj kaa susanskrit sadsy banane ke liye shiksha hi ek mukhya saadhan he
 Therefore, they consider the objectives of education in detail
 adarshavaad shiksha main shikshak ko sarvopari sthaan pradaan karata he
 This gives the teacher a proud place in the education world as well as is essential for the benefit of both the child and society
 adarshavaad ne ‘aatmanushasan’ evam ‘aatmaniyantran’ ke aise siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jinka anugaman kar aaj chaatro main badhati hui anushaasanheenata evam tanaav kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In keeping with the interests of both the individual and society, ideal and personal values have been given equal importance in idealistic education
 adarshavaad ne apni shiksha-yojana main balak ke vyaktitv kaa aadar kar shiksha prakriya ke donon dhuravon arthath shikshak evam shikshaarthi ko mahatv diya he
 Influenced by idealism, all people today emphasize the 'ideal personality' of children
 adarshavaadi shiksha aadhyatmik, dharmik tathaa naitik gunon ke vikaas par adhik bal detii he
 In addition to the above qualities in idealistic education, some defects are also found
 adarshavaad ne shiksha ke jo uddeshy nirdhaarit kiye hai ve itane adhik ‘amoort’ tathaa sookshm hai ki ek saamaanya buddhi ke vyakti ko unako samajhnaa ati kathin he
 These intangible and subtle objectives are related to the future and not to the present
 yah darshan balak evam uski prakruti kii apeksha shikshak evam adarsh ko pradhanta detaa he or is prakaar ‘bal kendrit shiksha’ ‘bal kendrit paathyakram’ tathaa ‘bal kendrit shikshan paddati’ se sambandhit aadhunik vichaaron kii upeksha ho jaati he
 Which is not at all fair for today's era
 adarshavaad paathyakram main aadhyatmik vishyon par adhik mahatv detaa he or vyaavhaarik jivan se sambandhit vishyon par adhik dhyaan nahin diya he
 Such a course may prove beneficial for ancient ideal societies, but in today's industrial age, such a course is of no importance
 adarshavaad ne shiksha ke uddeshyon evam lakshyon kaa nirdhaaran to kiya kintu kisi nishchit shikshan vidhi kaa pratipaadan nahin kiya
 The methods mentioned in this also give more emphasis on rote
 ye vidhiyaan avaigyanik hai
 From the above discussion it became clear how this philosophical ideology considers 'mind', 'thought' or 'ideal' as true and real and considers this material world as an illusion or pattern
 shiksha ke sandarbh main adarshavaad ke vishay main kaha ja saktaa he ki anek gunon se paripurna hote hue bhi aaj ke bhautikwaadi drushtikon se purna dosha rahit nahin mana jaataa he, phir bhi aaj ke bhautikwaadi yug main vyaapt sangharsh, kalah evam vaimnasy kii samaapti ke liye punah adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ko jivan ke vibhinn kshetron main apnaanaa hoga

 Coral reefs or coral reefs are rocks within the ocean composed of calcium carbonate released by corals

 The coral-rock-ranges, generally located in the warm and shallow seas, especially in the Pacific Ocean, are found abundantly in the proximity of many warm or subtropical islands

 The depth and temperature of the ocean has a great impact on the bed of the coral ranges, as the rock-forming organisms can survive only in places where the water is clear, shallow and warm

 Coral reefs: This type of rock reef is found slightly off the coast, leaving shallow lagoons between these and the coast
