 haritaki ko vaidyon ne chikitsa sahitya main atyadhik sammaan dete hue use amritopam aushadhi kaha he
 According to Raj Ballabh Nighantu- do prakaar ke harad bazaar main milte hai - badi or choti
 The big one has a hard kernel like a stone, the smaller one has no kernels, the fruits that fall from the tree before they are produced or broken and dried, are called small hari
 ayurveda ke jaankaar choti harad kaa upyog adhik niraapad maanate hai kyonki aanton par unka prabhaav saumy hota he, teevr nahin
 Apart from this, according to botanists, 3 different types of Harad can be made - Ripe fruit or Badi Hara, Half fruit, Yellow Hara, Unripe fruit, which is mentioned above as Choti Harad

 fal ke swaroop, prayog evam utpatti sthaan ke aadhaar par bhi harad ko kai varg bhedon main baanta gaya he par choti syah, pili jard, badi kabuli ye 3 hi sarv prachlit hai
 Only fruits are used for drug use and in them too, loaded with a weight of one and a half toes, small holes without holes and a large shell with a hard root are considered good
 bhav prakaash nighantu ke anusaar jo harad jal main dub jaae vah uttam he
 Harad contains receptors, tannic acid, gallic acid, chebulinic acid and mucilage

 According to the scientists of the Wealth of India, glucose, sarbitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose and arabinose are the major carbohydrates of Harad

 Some benefits of eating myrrh are as follows: - harre kaa fal a branch of Advaita Vedanta Vedanta
 ahan brahmasmiadvait vedant yah bharat main pratipaadit darshan kii kai vichaardhaaraon main se ek he, jiske aadi shankaracharya puraskarta the
 There are many ideologies about the nature of Parabrahma in India
 jisamen dwait, advait yaa keoladvait, vishishtadvait, shuddhadvait, dwaitadvait jaisi kai saidhantik vichaardhaaraein hai
 The Acharya described the form in which Brahma came to know
 itani vichaardhaaraein hone par bhi sabhi yah maanate he ki bhagwaan hi is sristi kaa niyantaa he
 The founder of the Advaita ideology is Shankaracharya, also known as Shankaradvaita or Kevaladvaita
 shankaracharya maanate hain ki sansar main brahm hi satya he
 Everything else is false
 jeev keval agyaan ke kaaran hi brahm ko nahin jaan paata jabaki brahm to uske hi andar virajman he
 He has stated Advaita principle in his Brahmasutra by saying "ego Brahmasmi"
 vallabhacharya apane shuddhadvait darshan main brahm, jeev or jagat, teenon ko satya maanate hai, jise vedon, upanishdon, brahmasutra, gita tathaa shrimadbhagwat dwaara unhone siddh kiya he
 The Advaita principle also permeates the pasture world
 jab pair main kaanta chubhta he tab aakhon se pani aata he or haath kaanta nikaalaneke liye jaataa he
 This is a perfect example of Advaita
 shankaracharya kaa ‘ecobrahm, dwitiyao naasti’ mat tha
 Parambrahm existed before creation
 brahm sat or sristi jagat asat he
 By Shankaracharya's opinion, Brahman is nirguna, passive, sata-asat, separate from work-cause
 brahm ankhon se nahin dekha ja saktaa, man se nahin janaa ja saktaa, vah gyaata nahin he or na gyey hi he, gyaan or kriya ke bhi ateet he
 Due to Maya, the living being is not able to know 'ego Brahma'

 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has done so much work for Hindi literature that he became more an institution than a person
 unhone maanas sukhthawali, sankshipt ramayana, hindi nibandhmala, sankshipt padmavali or hindi niabandh ratnavali kaa sampaadan bhi kiya
 He prepared high level text books for the students
 is tarah kii paathya pustakon main bhashaa saar sangrah, bhashaa patrabodh, pracheen lekhamala, hindi patr-lekhan, alok chithran, hindi primer, hindi kii pehali pustak, hindi grammer, hindi sangrah, government of india, balak vinod, nutan-sangrah, anulekh maala, hindi reader, hindi sangrah, hindi kusum sangrah, hindi kusumavali, hindi-suman, hindi proj sillection, gadhy ratnavali, sahitya pradeep, hindi gadhy kusumavali, hindi praveshika padyavali, hindi gadhy sangrah, saahitiyik lekh 
 Shyam Sundar Das was active in literary service till the last moment of his life
 swatantraaa se thik pehle or baad kii hindi kii puri peedi hi babuji ke kandhon par baithkar hi badi hui
 From time to time, the number of his statements given in conferences on various subjects are countless
 is samast chintan par drushti daalane par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki ve kis tarah hindi sahitya ko anek vishyon se jodakar aage badhanaa chaahate the
 Even today Babuji's great contribution is the authentic composition of the text and the wisdom of the field of study
 vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tazaa saamagree laane ke unke har kshan ke prayaas kaa nateeja yah hua ki ve sangrahakaar banate rahe
 It is criticized that this is why his writing became profound and lacked originality
 lekin dekhne kii baat yah he ki unki samanvayvaadee buddhi anek gyaan- kshetron kii saamagree-sangrah main nimagn rahi
 Even in practical-criticism, Babuji established the beauty of harmony

 He also wrote on many untouched subjects, poets are discovered and their talent is seen in historical essays
 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae
 Never use difficult words in foreign languages like Persian
 babu shyaam sundar das ne mukhyatah do prakaar kii shaileyon main likhaa he- 1

 2
 gaveshnatmak style- gaveshnatmak nibandhon main gaveshnatmak style kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The sentences are relatively few long
 bhashaa ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he
 Due to the intensity and dryness of the subject it is somewhat dry and devoid of style
 is prakaar kii style kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- 'this life struggle is beginning to seem even more intense and painful due to the attrition of two different civilizations
 is avasthaa ke anukool hi jab sahitya utpann hokar samaaj ke mastishk ko protsaahit or prati kriyman karegaa tabhi vaastavik unnati ke lakshan dekh padenge or uskaa kalyankari fal desh ko aadhunik kaal kaa gaurav pradaan karegaa
 Decoration of ornaments is not found in any type of style of Babu Shyam Sunderdas

 ramchandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main likhaa he : Shyam Sundar Das was not only an institute-maker, but was also unmatched in management
 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das
 ’ nagari prachaar ke andolan ne hindi-premiyon main nayaa utsaah paidaa kiya or bahut se log sahitya kii shrivriddhi main samarpit bhav se lag gayi

 In communication between parties, These are the karmas which provide knowledge and experience, give advice and orders and ask questions
 This karma can take many forms, among the many forms of different manners of communication, that form is group no
 Depending on the capability of transmission, communication, elements and forms together create messages that are sent to the destination
 The target itself, the other person or person, can be another entity

 Language is an organized system of intervertebrate signs such as speech sounds, character gaps, or written symbols that transmit thoughts or expressions
 If a language calls a conversation through signs, speech, sound, expressions or written signs, what animals Can communication be known as a language? Animals have no written form of language, but use language for conversation
 is myne main, pashu bhashaa ko sanchaar kaha ja saktaa he Human dialect and written language are known as the system of signs and the grammatical rule that enumerates the symbols is the word 'language', used to consider the same properties of language

com / watch?v=-p7kthrgoeg Dashakumarcharit is a Sanskrit prose written by Dandi
 isamen dash kumaron kaa charit varnit hone ke kaaran iskaa naam "dashakumarcharit" he
 The discovery of the prose called "avantisundari Katha" composed by Dandi has further compounded the problem of Daskumarcharit
 ye vikalp upasthit hote hai ki kya dashakumarcharit or avantisundari katha donon ke rachayita dandi ek hi hai athwa bhinn-bhinn hai; or yadi in donon ke lekhak ek hi dandi maan liye jaaen, to kya ye donon gadhykavy ek duusare ke poorak hai athwa do swatantra gadhykavy hai
 Some scholars are in favor that the Avantisundari Katha is the lost part of the original Dasakumarcharit and both are the same prose
 vidwaanon kaa doosraa varg is vichaar se bilkul sahamat nahin he
 Dashakumarcharit's handwritten and published editions often have three parts - inamen se granth kaa madhya bhaag hi, jo aath uchhvaason main vibhakt he, dandi kii moulik kriti mana jaataa he, parantu kyonki inamen rajvahan kii asampurn katha evam saat mitron kii kathaayen hai at: vah asampurn he
 The remaining parts, ie, puratheetika and uttarpeethika are compositions of other authors, which have been added to the beginning and end of the original book respectively
 vidwaanon kii dharna he ki dandi ne pehle avashya purna granth kii rachana kii hogi, kintu baad main karanvash ve bhaag nasht ho gaye
 In the eight extracts of the original book of Dandi, only eight kumaras are told
 kintu purvapithika main di gai do kumaron kii katha milakar das kumaron kii sankhya puri ho jaati he
 Similarly, the incomplete Vishrit Charit mentioned in the eighth extract of the original book is completed in the Uttarapeethika
 bhoj ne apane saraswati kanthabharan main purvapithika kaa stuti shloke uddhrut kiya he
 So this part was in the eleventh century
 Must have already been joined
 uttarpithika ke kari sanskaran hai- ek chakrapani kaa, doosraa narayan kaa, or kuch bhaag padmanabh ke
 Because the things mentioned in the main story have found opposition at many places in the antechamber and antechamber, it is easy to prove the antecedent and antecedent
 udhaahrant: mukhya bhaag main arthpal tathaa pramati kampal ke putr hai jinaki maataaon ke naam kramash: kantimati tathaa taravali he, parantu purv-peethika main arthpal, taravali kaa putr he or pramati, sumati naamak mantri kaa
 Similarly, in the main part, the name of Vishruta's father is Sindhudatta, but in the foreground, his name is Padmodbhav
 punasch mukhya bhaag main rajkumaar rajkumaari ke anuj kii sahaayta se ant:poor main pravesh paata he parantu purvapithika main ek sahakaari vidyadhar kii sahaayta se
 Similarly, there are many opposition and opposition in the book
 mul dashakumarcharit ke pratham uchhvas kaa aarambh ekaek mukhya nayak rajkumaar rajvahan ko ek bandi ke rup main prastut karte hue hoti he
 Later, in the campaign of Champa, Rajavahana finds all his forgotten wandering companions who tell their thrilling and curious incidents in the remaining seven exiles to Rajavahana
 duusare uchanvaas main uphaar verma kii katha aati he jo atyant vistrut ev vinodpurn hai
 The deception of a sage named Marichi and a superior named vastu-pal is very interesting
 nayak ke dyutshala main anubhav tathaa gharon main send lagaana aadi hasyapurna ghatnaayen hai
 From the third exorcism to the best exorcism, there are stories of the gifts Verma, Arthapal, Pramati and Mitragupta respectively
 tisare uchhavas main uphaar verma kii katha he
 He showed the right of Rajyapahari on the mind and suggested about the power of his amazing beauty
 is prakaar soundaryashakti ke bahaane se unki hatya kar di tathaa apane pita ke khoe hue rajya ko waapas liya
 In the fourth exile, Arthapal is said to have lost his father's lost mantripad and a princess named Manikarnika
 pancham uchhavas main pramati shravasti kii rajkumaari kaa panigrahan karata he
 In the description of Yuvraj's journey, many types of references to rural and civil life are found
 pashtha uchhavas main mitragupta ke dwaara khunh desh kii rajkumaari kii prapti kaa varnan he
 In this, Dandi has described the courage done on the sea
 saptam uchhavas main mantragupta kii katha he
 This feature of this sigh is remarkable in that the characters of the upper class from the lips have not been used due to the slit of the narrator's lips by his beloved
 ashtum uchhavas main vishrut ke saahasik kaaryo kaa varnan he jo vidarbha desh ke rajkumaar ko uskaa khoyaa hua rajya dilaataa he
 It has a sophisticated satire on political science
 anand evam sugam jivan kaa shashakt pratipaadan trutipurna hetu par adhrith he
 Like a sudden start, the work ends here suddenly
 sanskrit sahitya main dashakumarcharit kaa anupam sthaan he
 In fact, this Sanskrit prose is very close to modern novels
 yah tatkaaleen samaaj kaa sarvangin yatharth chitra upasthit karata he
 Dashakumarcharit slyness is called complete poetry
 dyutkrida, send lagaana, chaalaaki, dhoortta, pravanchanaa, hinsa, hatya, jaalsaji, apharan evam avaidh prem ek-ek athwa samuhik rup main sab kathaon main milte hai
 The behavior of the writer towards society is very important
 brahran, sanyasi, raja, rajkumariyaan evam pavitra saadhuon kaa uphaas kiya gaya he
 The gods were also not released
 parantu iskaa uddeshy aniatikta kaa samarthan karnaa nahin he
 Their main aim is to analyze the false beliefs of the people and present them to the society
 mukhya kathavstu ko avaantar kathaon ke saath badi kushalta se piroyaa gaya he
 The flow of the story, which runs smoothly from the beginning to the end, is interesting and intriguing
 uplabdh pracheen sanskrit gadhykavyon main dandi kaa dashakumarcharit hi ek aisa gadhykavy he, jo saral evam swaabhaavik gadhy style main likhaa gaya he
 The characterization of Dandi is very impressive
 unhone marichi rishi, ganika kammanjari, tathaa dhatri shringaalika tathaa sipaahiyon ke afasar kantak ke jivan-chitra pradarshit kiye hai
 Humor and satire abound in the entertainment situations presented by the poet
 nissandeh dandi kaa bhashaa par adhikaar he parantu vah badha chadhaakar vastuon kaa varnan nahin karte or apni kavyakala kii praudhata kaa sookshm drushti se pradarshan kar pathak ke hriday par prabhaav daalate hai
 Sanskrit critics appreciate his excellent word beauty
 vidwaanon main yah prasiddh ukti prachlit he 'dandinah padlaalityam' or iske dandi adhikari bhi hai
 Fine use of alliteration produces pulsating amusing sound effects
 ve lambe samaason kaa prayog karte hai parantu arth kii vyakti main aspashtataa nahin aane dete
 Their narratives are impressive and heartwarming, but they keep the reader's heart attracted because there is an artistic balance between the use of their ornaments and the subject
 dandi ke padlaalitya ke udhaaharan rup prastut hai- Or is prakaar ke udhaaharan praaia: prachurya se milte hai or 'dandinah padlaalityam' kii ukti ko siddh karte hai
 Dandi's design is a matter of pride
 unki bhashaa main sukumaartha, parishkar, pranjalata, prasad or maadhurya gun praapt hote hai
 On reading Dasakumarcharit, the reader realizes that he is tasting some succulent composition
 jivan kii anubhutiyaan aankhon ke samaksh utar aati hai or vah kavi ko apana ek atarang mitra sa anubhav karata he
 There is neither a plan for 'pratyakshalya' like Subandhu nor an artificiality of the 'sarsasirvarnapada' like the arrow in Dandi's poetry
 usamen dainik vyavhaar kii pravaahashil bhashaa he
 Short words and sentences are visible, playing like novices and they suddenly attract the heart
 kathaon or upanyaason main prayukt manish style kaa isamen antarbhaav dikhta he
 The plausibility, sweetness and spontaneous beauty of the language give the feeling of plungibility even in the dull
 raja rajhans or unki patni basumati ke varnan main padlaalitya or maadhurya darshneey he : Sherlyn Haywood is a former female cricketer of the Australian women's cricket team, who played one-day internationals and Test cricket matches for Australia in the 1980s

 Devloka was captured by Asura king Bali
 bali virochan ke putr tathaa prahlaad ke pautra the or ek dayaalu asur raja ke rup main jane jate the
 It is also said that through his austerity and vigor, Bali gained suzerainty over Trilok
 vaaman, ek boune brahman ke vesh main bali ke paas gayi or unase apane rahane ke liye teen kadam ke baraabar bhoomi dene kaa aagrah kiya
 He had a wooden umbrella in his hand

 Vamana increased his size so much that he measured the entire land in the first step

 After this, Brahma washed the feet of Vamana with the water of his kamandal

 Schwah deletion is a response in which it is necessary to discard the sound of shwa contained in the consonants of their scripts for correct pronunciation in Hindi, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Maithili and many other modern indo-aryan languages
 yah vilopan karnaa un bhashaaon ke maatrubhaashiyon ke dwaara samajhe jane ke liye or bolne vaale kaa lahaza sahi prathit hone ke liye bahut zaruri he
 Without this autopsy, the reader either seems unambiguously non-lingual or may have difficulty understanding it
 shwa vilopan computer dwaara likhit samagri ko padhane main or bhashaaon ko seekhney waalon ke liye chunauti hoti he kyonki in bhashaaon kii lipiyaan aksar yah spasht nahin karti ki shwa kahan rakhana chahie or kahan tyaagna chahie
 The Devanagari script is used to write modern Hindi, in which the sound of 'A' is added if there is no halant formally at the end of each consonant
 lekin hindi ke sahi uccharan ke liye hindi kaa 'shwa vilopan niyam' kahata he ki shabdon ke ant main or kuch or paristhitiyon main aksar yah shwa hataa diya jaataa he
 It is sometimes written as: 'a -> ø | Vowel consonant _vision vowel '
 iskaa arth he ki agar lipi ke anusaar kisi swar ke uparant aane vaale vyanjan ke baad shwa aata he or uske baad ek vyanjan aata he jiske peeche bhi ek swar laga ho, to us bich ke shwa ko tyaag diya jaataa he
 For example, if you look at the word 'dragon', it is 'A + j + a + g + a + r + A' but at the end of the word 'A' and between 'A + J' and 'G + A'
 a 'both are removed, due to which the correct Hindi pronunciation of the word' Ajgar 'is' Azgar'
 aksar yah baat angreji main lipyaantaran karne main spasht ho jaati he
 If we look at the city of Patna, according to the script it is 'p + a + t + a + n + a', which will be written 'patanā' in English
 lekin shwa vilopan niyam bich kaa shwa hataa detaa he, isliye vastav main sahi uccharan 'p+a+t+n+aa' he, yani 'pat
nā'
 Similarly 'uttar Pradesh' should be 'uttara pradesha' if it is seen as per formal script, but due to Schwah elimination it becomes 'uttar pradesh'
 dhyaan dijiye ki shwa vilopan ke kaaran kuch aksharon ke guton kaa uccharan unki shabd main paristhiti ke anusaar badal jaataa he
 The pronunciation of 'saral' is 'S + a + o + a + L', in which the ending is deleted
 lekin 'sarala' main niyamanusaar bich ke 'r' kaa 'a' hataa diya jaataa he, yani 's+a+r+l' 
 Similarly, in 'spinach' and 'palanquin', the middle 'L' is placed first but removed from the second word
 usee tarah 'dil kii dhadkane' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadkane' he, yani 'd' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 But in 'dil Dhadak Laga' the correct pronunciation of 'dhadakne' is 'dhadakne', ie this time the breath of 'D' was kept but the body of 'A' was removed
 hindi ke maatrubhaashi in shabdon ko bina soche aaraam se sahi uccharit karte hai, lekin gair-matibhashiyon or computaron ke liye yah kathinaayee paidaa karte hai
 Often their wrong pronunciation makes their speech 'strange' and 'hard to understand for the hearer'

 Astronomy The study of the light, origin, structure and behavior of celestial bodies located in the universe is a matter of astronomy
 ab tak brahmad ke jitne bhaag kaa pataa chalaa he usamen lagbhag 19 arab akaash gangaaon ke hone kaa anumaan he or prayek akaash ganga main lagbhag 10 arab taare hai
 The diameter of Akash Ganga is about one lakh light years
 hamaari prithvi par aadim jeev 2 arab saal pehle paidaa hua or aadmi kaa dharti par avatan 10-20 lakh saal pehle hua
 According to scientists, the universe originated from the explosion of a superpower
 surya ek ausat tara he jiske nau mukhya grah hai, unamem se prithvi bhi ek he
 Every star in this universe is like the Sun
 bahut-se taare to aise hai jinke saamne apana surya anu ke baraabar bhi nahin thahartaa he
 Just as there are planets of the Sun and we all call them together in the name of Solar family, similarly each star has its own family
 bahut se log samajhate hai ki surya sthir he, lekin sampurna saura parivaar bhi sthaneey nakshatra pranali ke antargat prati second 13 mile kii gati se gum rahaa he

 Its flow is from north to south

 In view, the stars of the Ganges seem to be interconnected, but this vision is illusion
 ek duusare se sate hue taron ke bich kii duuri arabon mile ho sakati he
 When this is the condition of contiguous stars, then the distance between the wires located far away is such a calculation that it is difficult to say
 isi kaaran se taaraon ke bich tathaa anya lambii dooriyaan prakashavarsh main maapi jaati hai
 a light year is the distance that the distance light travels in a year at a speed of one lakh twenty six thousand thousand miles per second
 udhaaharan ke liye surya or prithvi ke bich kii duuri sava nau karod mile he, prakaash yah duuri sava aath minute main tay karata he
 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them
 is sthiti main hamen in duriyon ko milon main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin hoga or na kuch samaj main hi aayega
 That's why scientists have used the unit of light year
 maan lijie, brahmad ke kisi or nakshatron aadi ke baad bahut dur dur tak kuch nahin he, lekin yah baat antim nahin ho sakati he

 If you get the screen of this light, then the tilt of the screen is more towards red color
 is prakriya ko dopalar prabhaav kehete hai
 Many people will be familiar with the sound related Doppler effect
 jab ham prakaash ke sandarbh main dopalar prabhaav ko dekhte hai to dur se aanevaale prakaash kaa jhukaav nile rang kii ore hota he or dur jane vaale prakaash strot ke prakaash kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore hota he
 Thus Hubble's observations revealed that the sky Ganges is going away from us
 habal ne yah bhi bataaya ki unki prithvi se dur hatane kii gati, prithvi se unki duuri ke anupaat main he
 Astronomers have observed the extinction of the galaxy from the telescope of a 200-inch diameter lens located at Mount Polomer Observatory
 doorabeen se brahmad ko dekhne par hamen aisa prathit hota he ki ham is brahmad ke centrebindu hai or baaki chijen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 If observers are sent to other sky Ganges, they will also find that they are the focal point of this universe, the rest of the sky Ganges are running away from us
 ab jo sahi chitra hamaare saamne aata he, vah yah he ki brahmad kaa samaan gati se vistaar ho rahaa he
 And any point of this huge format is moving away from other objects
 habal ke anusandhan ke baad brahmad ke siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aavashyak ho gaya tha
 This was the time when Einstein's theory of relativism was in its infancy
 lekin phir bhi ainstin ke siddhant ko soramandal sambandhi nirikshanon par aadhaarit nishkarshon kii vyakhya karne main newton ke siddhanton se adhik safalataa praapt hui thi
 According to Newton, the transpiration force between the two bodies has an immediate effect on each other, but Einstein proved that the speed of reciprocal transpiration power cannot be as fast as the speed of light
 aakhir yahan par ainstin ne newton ke patr ko galat pramanit kiya
 People liked Einstein's theory

 Theory of steady state 2

 oscillation principle

 According to this belief, the universe has originated from the explosion of a Mahapind and that is why the Ganges of the sky is running away from us
 is brahmad kaa ulataa chitra aap apane saamne rakhie tab aapako brahmad prasaarit na dikhaai dekar sakunchit hota hua dikhaai degaa or akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui na dikhaai dekar aati hui prathit hogi
 Therefore, it means to say that at some time there must have been a Mahapind and due to its explosion, the Akash Ganges are running away from us
