 In addition, turkey can be reared in clean and semi-scavenging conditions
 kalil yaa colide ek rasaynic mishran hota he jisame ek vastu duusari vastu me samaan rup se parikshepit hoti he
 The particles of the dispersed object remain suspended only in the mixture and not as a solution
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki kalil me kanon kaa aakaar vilyan me upasthit kanon ke aakaar se bada hota he - yah kan itane chote hote hai ki mishran me puri tarah parikshepit ho kar ek samroop mishran taiyaar karen, lekin itane bade bhi nahin hote hai ki prakaash ko prakirnit karen or naa ghulein
 Due to this reflection, some of the solutes look like solution
 kisi kalil pranali kii do pruthak pravasthaayen hoti hai: pehali parikshepan pravastha or duusari satat pravastha 
 a particle system can be solid, fluid or gaseous
 neeche kii talika me ek samroop or asamroop mishran me kalil ke kanon kaa vyas kaa tulanaatmak vishleshan he
 : isliye, kalileey nilamban, samroop or asamroop mishranon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 The word colloid is used in English for Kalil
 yah shabd greek bhashaa ke cola shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'sares' hota he
 In 1861, an English scientist, Thomas Graham, observed that albumin, glue, glue, demand, silicic acid, and other similar substances were not able to filter through the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water
 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil
 kintu ab yah siddh ho gaya ki sharkara or sodium chloride aadi crystalia padaarth bhi upyukt madhyam main kalil ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the foliage, the fissile particles are scattered in a continuous medium
 is prakaar kalilon main do sanghatak rahete hai
 In the list below, first name is of medium and second name is of distributed substance: kalilkanon kaa aakaar vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The particles are larger in size than molecules, but they are smaller in size than all particles that can be seen under a microscope
 inkaa vistaar 10-5 sein
me
 se 10-7 sein

 tak hota he
 Although the copies of each mail in the above list can be obtained, there are more types of types used and these have been studied in more detail
 jal ke madhyam main vitarit thos yaa drav ke kalil ko saul kaha jaataa he
 Both organic and inorganic substances are found in many forms in the mumps
 vaigyanik yaa pravidhik, kadachit hi koi aisi shakha ho jisamen kalilon kaa mahatvapurn upyog na hota ho
 Due to its superiority, science has become especially special
 kalilon ke gunon main bhed hone kii drushti se unhen do pradhan virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The first class has metallic types of plumes, such as gold plumes etc
, and the second class has protein types of plumes, such as gelatin
 inke vishesh gun nimnlikhit hai : The words which have special use for both these types of plumes are hydrologist and water lover
 inhen angreji main krmanusaar lyophobic or lyophilic bhi kaha jaataa he
 This classification cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, since some properties of certain clades are intermediate to the unreduced properties of both extreme classes
 is prakaar ke jalakalilon main kuch dhatviya oxiden yaa hydroxiden, kuch aviley fasphet, molibdet, tungstate ityadi hai
 Some people divide the Kalils into two classes of Alambabh and Payasabha
 inke atirikt kalilon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo ab vishesh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 This class is called the Kaliyala Vidyutulasi
 sabun kaa jalakalil iskaa lakshanik udhaaharan he
 These waterways also have electronegativity
 parishkarakon ke rup main ab inkaa adhik upyog hone laga hai
 Brown motion can be seen with the help of a microscope in the buds
 vilyanon main yah kriya nahin hoti
 When a skin is sent through the center of the waterway by focusing the beam, the beam becomes milky and the outgoing rays acquire fluidity
 iske kaaran hai kalilkanon ke aakaar or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa vitarit padaarth ke vartanaank or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa viparit padaarth ke vartanaank kaa avichhinn madhyam ke vartanaank se adhik hona
 With the help of powerful microscopes, the talcus can be seen by the effect of the Tyndall
 is prakaar dekhe jane par kalilkan prakashit taron kii bhanti dikhaai padate hai
 Also their speed is quick, irregular and continuous
 is gati ko hi brounian gati kehete hai
 At the same speed, the ideas of the theory of dynamics of substances have been experimentally confirmed
 aavogadro niyatank ko is siddhant ke anusaar nikaalane par yah siddh ho gaya he ki praayogic truti kaa vichaar karke is vidhi se nikaale gaye aavogadro-niyatank ke maan anya vidhiyon ke nikaale gaye is niyatank ke maan se samya rakhte hai
 Perrin has taken the value of Avogadro constant 6

 For many technical methods, it is necessary to create a color
 jalasantrasi kalil hi saralata se banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki jalpremi kalil utkramntic hai
 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
 arq ke ucch taap par dhaatu vashpikrut ho jaati he
 Then the superfluous particles of vapor get integrated and form the shape of the particles
 vastav main vibhaajan dwaara kalil banane kaa pramukh saadhan kalil-mil he
 In this device, two plates, which are very close to each other, rotate in opposite directions
 vitarit kiya janevaala padaarth uchit madhyam ke saath in donon platon ke bich se bheja jaataa he
 In this way, the particles become smaller and take the shape of darker particles
 donon main se kisi bhi vidhi se nirmit kalilon ke shodhan ke liye unhen manibhabh padaarth se apohan dwaara pruthak kriya jaataa he
 To do this Kalil is placed in a parchment or cellophane bag
 is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein
me
 vilyan dwaara, jiskaa sandran 10 pratishat ho, avakshipt kiya ja sake
 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 The uneven distribution of electrosynthesis leads to complexity in some buds due to an action called dononsantulation
 is tanupat santulan kii kriya kaa adhyayan congou red naamak rang, sabun tathaa anya kai kalileey vidyudvishleshyon par kiya gaya he
 In these conditions the collicular substance behaves like an electrodynamic
 jab kisi aayan kaa aakaar kalilkanon ke aakaar ke samaan hota he jab tanupat ke donon ore vibhav kaa srijan hota he, jise tanupat vibhav kehete hai
 In many protein cells, dilution-potential always arises and charge on living cells is due to this equilibrium balance
 ati sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se kalilkanon kaa aakaar yaa rup nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Nevertheless the number of calculus can be counted; The average volume of a particle can then be determined by the value of the absolute volume of the distributed matter
 kintu jab saul nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab usamen kai aakaar ke kan upasthit rahete hai
 The form of the calculus can be spherical, lanceolate, elliptical or flaky
 kalilkanon kaa rup gyaat karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan viksit kii gai hai jo prakaashiya gunon par aadhaarit hai
 These plumes are characterized by having an impact on the viscosity of the delivery medium
 shyanta adhiktar bad jaati he or vitarit padaarth kii maatra kii vruddhi ke saath shghrita se badhati jaati he
 Viscosity increases so much when a particular concentration is reached that Kalil takes the form of jelly
 saul ke avakshepan se bhi jelly praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of jelly is limited and the semipermeable gels that are made by cooling the gelatine, agar agar, starch, etc
 are called jelly
 adhikansh jalpremi kalil sheetaleekaran par yaa garm karne par jelly banaate hai
 Many inorganic hydrological plants can also be obtained as jelly under special conditions
 is prakaar se kai jaleey hydraxidon, aviley faspheton, molibdeton kii jeliyaan prayogshaala main banaai jaati hai
 The jelly generally exhibits the properties of liquid release
 adhik samay tak rakhane par jelly sikudti tathaa chatak jaati he or jelly main bandhaa hua jal baahar nikal aata he
 Jails can be divided into two classes: elastic and rigid
 pratyasth jeliyaan saadhaarant: gelatin, aighar aadi prakritik kalilon se banati hai, kintu adhikansh acarbonic jeliyaan, jinamein silisik amla bhi rahata he, drudh vyavhaar dikhaati hai
 Some jails have a strange nature
 ve hilaane par, andolit karne par yaa karnathit tarangon ke prabhaav se pun: saul main parivartit ho jaati hai
 But if they are kept stable then they become jelly again
 yah kriya kai baar duharai ja sakati he
 This action is called tactile sense
 jalpremi kalilon main proteinon ke saulon par vishesh khojein hui hai
 The reason for this is their importance in physical chemistry
 proteinon ke jo saul prakritik avasthaa main paae jate hai ve saadhaarant: rinatmak aveshwale hote hai
 Most solutes achieve positive charge when made acidic
 is prakaar ek vishesh pi ech par protein ke saul par koi bhi aavesh nahin hoga
 This is called isocele point
 isi se protein kii pahchaan haati he
 The chemical properties are ancient amphoteric because it has more bona fides
 is gun ke kaaran protein bafar kaa kaam detaa he
 This quality has special significance in the life of animals
 proteinon main jalasantrasi kalilon ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa samarthy rahata he or inaki swarnsankhya kii sahaayta se kai rogon ke nidaan main sahaayta milti he
 It is not possible to calculate all the uses of the plants
 adhikansh jaivik taral padaarth, jaise rakt aadi, swabhaav ke hote hai
 As calcium-soap, metals such as calcium, gold, iron, gold, manganese, silver, etc
, or their insoluble compounds, are used in medicine in the form of kalil
 aahaar vigyaan main kalileey padaarthon par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 The humic and clayey soil properties have a special effect on soil fertility and its physical properties
 reshe carbonic kalil hai or kapadaa udyog bhi kalileey udyog hi he
 The color and printing used in the manufacture of chintz is done only because of the color properties
 kuch abhikaarakon main celulosiya padaarth ke kalileey gunon par kritrim resham kaa nirmaan aadhaarit he
 Soaps and detergents are the waste materials and many substances, such as lubricants, plastics, rubber, lubricants, oily dyes, etc
, are found to have scleenic properties
 kaanch, mrittika tathaa cement udyog kalileey vigyaan se vishesh rup se sambhddha hai
 Most of our diets, such as proteins, carbohydrate fats in the form of starch, etc
 are also lax in properties
 kalil rasayan kii takanic hamaare anek bhojya padaarth banane main aavashyak hoti he jaise pavaroti, makkhan, jelly, jam, peya, icecream aadi
 The Battle of Jama was fought on 19 October 202 BC and was the last and decisive war of the Second Punic War
 is samar ne waterlu ke samar kii hi bhanti tatkaaleen vishwa-itihaas ko prabhavit kiya tha
 In this battle, General Hannibal of Carthage was defeated for the first time in his valiant life
 africa ke aakraamak or romanon ke hitaishi skipiyo ne dakshin italy ke aparajit yoddha hanibal par akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 Hannibal concentrated his tactical power in a place called Lepti
 aisa karke usne skipiyo kii samrik sthiti ko sankatapann kar diya
 But at such a time, Scipio decided to bring his army far enough to the enemy's side, without giving any notice to his opponent, instead of waiting for Hannibal
 hanibal ko apane raksharth puure sainya dal ke saath kooch karnaa padaa kintu is bhaag-daud main skipiyo hi laabh main rahaa
 The chief heroes of both the armies initially had a negotiation, but the dispute was finally decided to be resolved by war
 skipiyo ne apni sena ke madhya bhaag main badi sankhya main teen panktibaddh sainikon kii tathaa unke donon siron par shashakt ashwarohi dal ko rakhaa
 The opposing party equipped its vast military power in a different way, but repeated the same error that the Indian King Puru had made in operating his army while fighting against Alexander
 karthej sena main 80 hathi the jinhen shatru ko bhaybheet karne ke uddeshy se pehali pankti main khadaa kiya gaya or unke parshv main vetanbhogi paidal sainikon kii panktiyon khadi kii gayi
 The second relatively powerful front of the army retreated slightly and the third front, led by Hannibal, was 200 yards behind the other fronts
 sangharsh kaa aarambh hasti sainya dwaara kiye gaye akraman se hua kintu iske pehle ki roman sena shrinkhalit hoti, unhone bheeshan turyanad dwaara hastidal ko atyaadhik bhayakrant or veikshipt kar diya
 As a result, the whole of the handcuffs turned back and forth with panic and started demolishing their own army
 is avasar kaa laabh roman sainikon ne bhalee prakaar uthaaya or haathiyon ke pairon tale kuchli jaati hui sena par tut pade
 The whole earth became wet and smooth with blood, due to which an unexpected obstruction occurred in the victory path of the Romans
 yah sthiti hanibal ke paksh main thi or romanon ko peeche khadedane main use safalataa bhi mili kintu sheeghra hi romanon ne apane ko sanbhaal liya
 Skippy encouraged his army to strike fiercely at the enemy by efficiently concentrating and organizing the power efficiently
 dhamasaan yuddh hua
 Hannibal's soldiers fought valiantly, but at the same time Hannibal was eventually defeated as Scipio's army gained strong support from the new cavalry
 skipiyo aage bada or usne karthej par adhikaar kar liya
 With this, a long struggle between Rome and Carthage to establish power on the Mediterranean came to an end
 safadarajang vimaanashetra kii terminal imaarat kaa bahari drishy Safdarjung Airport is an airport or airport built in the region of the same name in the southern part of the Indian capital, New Delhi
 british raaj ke samay sthapit yah hawaii adda tab wellingdon airfield ke naam se aarambh hua tha
 Operations started here in 1929 when it became Delhi's first and India's second airport
 south atlantic air feri maarg main aane ke kaaran iskaa bharpoor upyog dwitiya vishwa yuddh main, tathaa kalantar main bharat paak yuddh 1974 main hua
 Once situated at the southern end of Lutyens Delhi, this airport is now almost in the middle of the entire city of New Delhi
 1962 tak yah shahar kaa pramukh hawaii adda bana rahaa or dashak ke ant tak puraa prachaalan naye hawaii adde palam vimaanashetra ko sthanantarit hua
 The main reason for this was the inability of the aircraft to take off large aircraft such as jet aircraft
 1928 main yaheen dilli flaaing club kii sthapana hui
 Then there used to be 2 de Haviland moths named Delhi and Roshanara
 hawaii adde par prachaalan 2001 tak chalaa, kintu janvari 2002 se sarkaar ne 9 / 11 kii ghatana ko dekhte hue uraksha kii drushti se is hawaii adde par prachaalan ko purna viraam diya
 Since then the club only runs aircraft maintenance and repair courses here
 aajkal iskaa prayog maatr raashtrapati evam pradhan mantri sahit anya viviipi helicopters kii palam hawaii adde tak kii yatraaon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Within the premises of this 190-acre airport, the Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan complex is built, where the Corporate Headquarters of the Ministry of Civil Aviation of India and the Airports Authority of India are established
 is vayukshetra kaa naam pehle wellingdon airfield hua karata tha
 The name was derived from Lord Willingdon, the then Viceroy and Governor General of India
 tab yah hawaii adda vishaal ghaas ke maidan main maatr kuch choradaariyon kaa samooh hua karata tha
 The first airmail flight landed here on 30 November 1918
 isi varsh landan-dilli-kahiraa kii bhi ek udaan yahaan aayi thi
 However, it took the next full decade for the airport to take its shape and then the first commercial flight landed in 1927
 aage aane vaale samay main is vayukshetra kaa naam aadhikarik rup se badalakar wellingdon airport ho gaya, saath hi yahaan dilli flaaing club kii bhi sthapana hui
 In 1941, when the British Indian Army planned to set up its own airborne / parachute unit, the Royal Indian Air Force's Air Landing School started in the southwest corner of the same airport
 yaheen bharat ke pratham paratrupar ko prashikshan mila tha
 In this group, the first Indian paratrooper was Lt
 AG Rangarajan of the Indian Medical Service, Mahavirchakra holder and Regimental Medical Officer of 152 Parachute Battalion
 1947 main bharat kii swatantraaa uparaant is hawaii adde kaa naam badalakar safadarajang ke makbare ke naam par safadarajang vimaanashetra kar diya gaya
 This mausoleum appears in the background of the airport
 isane dilli shahar ke mukhya hawaii adde rup main do dashakon tak sevaayen deen, jab tak kii dakshin-pashchimi dilli main tatkaaleen dilli ke bahari kshetra main palam gaanv naamak kshetra main ek nayaa sthaan nahin sweekrut kar liya gaya
 This new station was named after the village as the first Palam Air Force Station in World War II
 aaj yahi vimaanashetra kaafii vrahat kshetra main faila hua he or indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adda kehalaata he
 In 1962, there was an operational relocation due to increasing passenger traffic
 haalanki safadarajang vimaanashetra kaa prayog abhi bhi saamaanya vimaanan uddeshyon evam chote propeller yanon ke udaan bharne tathaa avataran karne hetu kiya jaataa he
 Over the years, due to the formation of a flyover near the eastern end of this flight, the vehicles are cautioned for landing
 naye vimaanashetra indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde kaa aakaar isaki tulana main kaafii bada he evam vahaan 3 udaan pattiyaan tathaa 60 se adhik antardeshiy evam anterrashtriya yanon kii suvidha he
 After the 9 / 11 incident in 2001, the Ministry of Civil Aviation of India has reserved for the emergency evacuation of the President and Prime Minister and some other special flights
 baad main 2002 se suraksha kii drushti se is hawaii adde ko sabhi udaan gatividhiyon hetu band kar diya tathaa, diolli flaaing club kii sabhi udaanon ko haryana ke hisar shahar main sthanantarit kar diya gaya he
 Since then, this airport has been confined to helicopter flight mainly to the VVIP community to the international airport
 iskaa mukhya kaaran suraksha hi rahaa he, saath hi unke avaagaman ke dauraan shahar kii sadakon ko band karne tathaa yatayaat avrodh se bachanaa bhi he
 Since the early 2000s, the Prime Minister has departed from the international airport instead of visiting cabinet members and other dignitaries who have gone abroad
 iske saath hi ye hawaii-pattee punjab tathaa haryana rajyon ke mukhya mantriyon ke avaagaman hetu chote vimaanon ke liye prayog hoti he
 Due to this there are about 80 to 90 helicopter movements per month
 kai baar yahaan bhartiya vimaanapttan praadhikaran tathaa helicopter seva company pavanhans bhi iskaa prayog karti rahati he
 On many occasions Pawan Hans also makes helicopter service reservations for Vaishno Devi from here
 haal ke samaacharon ke anusaar bhartiya pradhanmantri ke karyaalay, 7 rescorse maarg se yahaan tak ek bhumigat surang kaa kaam bhi hone kaa vichaar tha jiskaa vimaanan mantralay dwaara kadaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 This airport is maintained and managed by the Airports Authority of India, and it is controlled by the Indira Gandhi International Airport
 terminal imaarat vaayu kshetra kii ore se Terminal building imaarat ke andar Interior decoration terminal imaarat kaa portico The Corporate Headquarters of the Airports Authority of India functioning under the Ministry of Civil Aviation is located in Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan along with the Ministry
 yah bhawan safadarajang vimaanashetra kii bhoomi par hi bana he tathaa iske nirmaan purv bhoomi vimaanashetra parisar main hi aati thi

 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle, when it came to the selection of the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, a song written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur, was given preference over Vande Mataram
 isaki vajah yahi thi ki kuch musalamaanon ko "vande maataram" gane par aapatti thi, kyonki is geet main devi durga ko raashtra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Apart from this, he also believed that the Anand Math novel from which this song was taken was written against Muslims
 in aapattiyon ke maddenjar san 1937 main congress ne is vivaad par gaharaa chintan kiya
 The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, found that the first two verses of the song are said to be in praise of the motherland, but later verses mention Hindu deities; Therefore, it was decided that only the first two verses of this song will be used as national songs

 dow rajendra prasad kaa samvidhan sabha ko diya gaya vaktavy is prakaar he) : There are also some controversies about the Anand Math novel, some staunch people consider it anti-muslim
 unka kahana he ki isamen musalamaanon ko videshi or deshadrohi bataaya gaya he
 The song Vande Mataram is also being debated
 is geet ke pehle do band, jo ki praasangik hai, main koi bhi muslim virdohi baat nahin he or na hi kisi devi yaa durga kii aradhana he
 But these people say that- haalaanki aisa nahin he ki bharat ke sabhi musalamaanon ko is par aapatti he yaa sab hindu ise gane par jor dete hai
 It is also worth mentioning that a few years ago, the famous music composer AR Rahman, himself a Muslim, had prepared a music album about Vande Mataram which became very popular

 However, at this time these soldiers only want to implement the Sixth Pay Commission and give equal pension to the soldiers who have served the same post and same time, even if both have retired in any year

 It is to be wondered whether Shaurya is the only 3% of the army officers' fraternity? Are 97 percent of the army men and soldiers not brave? Does this country only recognize the martyrdom or valor of officers? kya jab bhi sena kaa ek vir desh ke liye apratim veerta or kaushalya dikhaata he to use medal ke liye ricomend hi nahin kiya jaataa? medal kya sirf kechap karnal ko hi die jate he? doston medal vaapasi gang or bhartiya sashastr senaao main medalon ke aabantan main paardarshita kaa abhaav ke bich kaa mail milaap aaiye milakar samaje

 police ne inhen shaam tak kaa samay diya
 It did not go away
 phir jantarmantari gurgo ko agle din subah tak kaa ultimatum de diya gaya
 The children of some of these retired colleagues are television journalists
 inhone agle din ke liye obi wain live tivi kawarej ke liye taiyaar rakhwai
 On the morning of August 14, the police once again pleaded for the national security to give them the waiters
 baad main unhen haath pakad kar police wain main baitaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Now he got handgun from the police
 us halki jhadap ko inke faujee brett prestitute bacchonne aise live tivi par cover kiya or dikhaaya jaise kii is desh kaa chunaa huwa pradhanmantri saare purv sainiko kaa ek maatr dushman he xxrep 4 ! a colonel Chaudhary, in his Facebook post immediately after the incident, channeled all the serving and retired soldiers, calling them their neighbors and families and saying
 “jantar mantar se hate nahin, vaapis hamalaa karen or police ko maar bhagaaen
 In support of ORP, prevent Modi from hoisting the national flag at the Red Fort
 turant hi kaarywahi karen, der na hone paae
 Inqualab Zindabad! Jai Hind!!" are bhai ! yah koun sa inkilab he tumhaara??? agar shahid e aazam bhagat singh in dogale logon ko inqilab jindabad ke us amar naare ko kuch rupayon ke phaayde ke liye raashtra se gaddari karte vakt istemaal karata dekhte to unka sar zarur shame se jhuk jaataa
 Truth of one rank one pension kya yahi he? van rank van pension ke jantar mantar vaale dharne kaa sach!! phir to yah van rank van pension aap afasaron ko mubarak
 Fudu military cannot betray his soil for a few rupees
 jai jawan! vaala sammaan jo medal jalaao gang kii vajah se hamane khoyaa he
 How to get it back ?? How did the situation of the former soldiers improve today? samaan military sarvice pe or samaan disability pension On the second day of the surgical strike, in October 2016, a special disciple of Genset Shri Satbir Babu wrote an article in rediff dot com, "the government's gift to the soldiers after the surgical strike cuts the disability pension !!" meri samaj main ye nahin aa rahaa he kii jab phaayde kii baat aati he to kuch khaas afasar bandhu apane aap ko “sainik” “jawan” in sab naamo se ullekhate he
 And when it comes to equality, he came to the civil service himself
 e
 s
 adhikariyon sang tolate he
 During the commissions, who call themselves jawans, they break the back of real men
 javaanon kii vidhwaaen silaai mashin chalaake jaise taise apana guzar basar kar rahi he
 Disabled soldiers are destitute and are eating at rates
 or yahan afasaron ke lobh or laalach ne maanavtaa kii sari simaaen laangh di he
 In the new pay commission, the pension of the officer brothers has now been exceeded
 kuch logon ne disability pension ko basic se jodakar lakhon rupaye kamaane kaa nayaa tarika irzad kiya tha
 In some of our former officers, this trend is very dangerous that as soon as the opportunity is available, heat the market of Afwans, and howsoever you can distort things only for the financial benefit of the officers
 purv sainik bhaaion yah ladaai keval “ek samaan military sarvice pe” or “ek samaan disability pension” kii hi nahin he
 This is the battle of millions of soldiers and former soldiers like me, who we have to fight every day continuously, with the hope that one day the true soldier Swaraj will come
 sampoorn sainikswaraj gandhiji ke shabdon main My dear officer brother, ‘aap usee kaa fal paa rahe he jo aapane aaj tak boyaa he
 ' kya he purna swaraj? swaraj matlab kya azaadi sirf angreji hakumat se??? baapu ne kaha he, apni pustak hind swaraj main
 Gandhi's Swaraj to commemorate the complete independence of soldiers
 1
 azaadi ghulaami kii angreji maansikta se
 2
 Swaraj High Low Officer Officer Hindu Muslim with these discrimination
 3
 swaraj maang rahe ham
 Do others have the will to give swaraj to our lower classes
 4
 kuch cese ladane or jitne se kya sampoorn sainik swaraj kii prapti hogi?? shaitan ko pankh hote he
 But goodness slowly emerges its existence
 kya ham sainik swaraj ke liye lambii ladaai ko taiyaar he??? 5
 What complete Swaraj was received by the going of the British completely
 nahin angreziyat aaj bhi zindaa he
 Particular behavior from Hindustani under his belt
 6
 mitti kaa gadaa takaraav se tuutata he
 If not one or the other stone will break it
 mitti ke ghade ko tuutane se bachaane ke liye use agni main taapana utana hi zaruri he, jitna zaruri he use pathar se dur rakhana
 7
 Sainik Swaraj is that every less educated senior junior soldier should get as much respect as every Indian should get
 "tera bhi vatan meraa bhi vatan" 8
 Sainik Swaraj is an honor for all Indians, whether they are soldiers or if the officer gets the same amount of promotion
 vetanmanon main bhedbhaav na ho
 9
 The officers who get very high pay scale and pension should stop looting the country with new methods like NFU, OROP, TIMESCALE
 jab ek purv sainik kii vidhwaa 3500 ₹ main apana guzar basar kar rahi he tab ye luutere angarez 65000 se le kar 15 xxrep 4 0 rupaye main bhi santosh nahin paa rahe
 10
 The officers call themselves soldiers xxrep 5 ! Then if you are a soldier then why discrimination against soldiers xxrep 4 ? On one side, all these honors pension OROP medal should become a soldier
 11
 phir jab pension,oropi,pe kamishan sevedari MSP NFU TIMESCALE in sabake samay tumhaara andar kaa sainik mar jaataa he
 The fallen devil thinks that what has gone to my father's money is the tax payer's money
 jitna khasot sakate ho khasotalo
 12
 Dead person, my officer, still have time to wake up
 zyaada paisa chahie tab apane aap ko ai
 a

 And you talk to the leaders
 phir achaanak aapke andar kaa girggit rang badalata he or desh prem ke jhumale yaad aate he
 13
 When it comes to providing basic and statutory rights to the soldier, communist salary, equal civil facilities such as clubs and golf courses in the canteen and a line one to the government quarters and facilities in the hospital, the rank of the youth and their families
 Remind them of their status
 14
 sainikswaraj main afasar bhaaiyo kii bhi utani hi bhagidaari he jitani hamaari
 If the officers leave the British and embrace Hindustaniyat, as well as adopt the companionship of their soldiers in Singapore United States of America like Mulco's army o and the officer of Waha
 15
 sabhi sainiko ko seva ke dauraan di jaarhe shiksha or pramaan patro main bhedbhaav karke unhen farzi pramaan patr na die jaye
 All these evil intentions of the officers are to keep the soldiers away from their greatest education
 sainikswaraj kaa arth he bharat main manyata praapt shiksha sansthaanon se saare senaao ke abhyaaso ko hi talim main gina jaye
 16
 Swaraj is the empowerment of every Hindustani
 swaraj he skill india
 Swaraj is an honor for 60 percent of soldiers to be promoted by promotion
 17
 sainikswaraj he sainik or afasar donon ke yuddh yaa anya samay main ghayal yaa aahat hone par samaan sammaan mili
 Whether the Gallantry Award, medal allocation, disability pension or pension allocation to the widow of a martyr is discriminatory in these places is unforgivable
 yahan swaraj turant hi laayaa jaye
 18
 Bapu said that unless we remove the British from inside India, then even if the English go away, what is the use ?? 19
 ye bhedbhaav jhooth aadambar asaty chori bhrashtachar ek ek bhartiya ke man se dur hoga tabhi aayega sachcha sainikswaraj
 20
 Gandhiji had said that if the British adopt Indian cultural values such as respect and coordination then we will accept them as Indians
 21
 dar se mili chiz tabhi tak kaayam rahegi jab tak dar rahegaa
 Give us the power of mind and win the mind
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind
 bhedbhaav, bhedbhaav apane dil se saafe kar saken
 Forgive me if you forget from friends
 jhooth se bache rahen, sach kaa dam bhare
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena man vijay karen
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena
 If there are difficulties, do so much work on us, if we support you with religion, if we go on religion, be encouraged by ourselves, do not be afraid of bad things
 ham ko man kii shakti dena, man vijay karen
 Hail yourself before the victory of others

 Your native gorwal vetan ayog or visangatiyaan In the Army, from the time of the Third Pay Commission, ie from 1974 to the seventh Pay Commission of 2016, the pay scales of the soldiers and jcos have always been discriminated against because we are always silent as a disciplined soldier and yes our top officers are very sensitive to our problems and salary discrepancies
 Always remain indifferent 


 Why? Because his post-retirement ambition could only be overcome when he himself remained silent and kept his subordinate soldiers in the name of discipline and suppressed their voice
 The soldiers had a problem and the soldiers could not open their mouths, so whatever these top level officers, given by the government to the army soldiers, considered and accepted more than their status, that is, they considered the status of a soldier as less than a civilian employee and It is a matter of fact that the salary of a soldier is much less than the salary of the constables of the police of Delhi and Chandigarh
 Should the level of army soldiers be lower than the level of constables xxrep 4 
 After all, at what level did the pay commission undermine the army below the level of police 


 If this situation prevails, then the next level of the army will be equal to home guards 
 The truth is that in the last nearly five Pay Commission recommendations, they completely distanced themselves from the army level and their pay discrepancies, due to which the army was disillusioned with these pay commissions
 Today, soldiers are forced to retire at a young age to live the life of Mufalis and are forced to sit at Jantar Mantar with their legitimate demands
 With the help of some blurred memories, i am writing below the brief details of the salary discrepancies of the last five Pay Commission due to the trivial thinking and indecision of the army personnel

 jahaan tak mujhe tisare vetan ayog se lekar saatve vetan ayog kaa sena ke vetan or bhatte evam civillian karmchaariyon ke vetan ke antar ke bare me thodaa sa gyaan he us par thodi roshni daalana chahta hum or kyon sena ko civillian se downgrad kiya gaya
 sabase pehle to mai kaaran vatata hum kyonki sena or anya police force sanghathan ek anushaasit sanghathan he or hameshaa upar ke nirdeshon kaa aksharsh: paalan karne ke liye krit sankalpit hote he or iske liye unhone apni jaan kaa bhi balidaan karne ke liye bachan de rakhaa he aisa deshvasi maanate he xxrep 5 
 kyonki ham kisi bhi haalat me apana munh nahi khol sakate
 iskaa phayda sarkaar or dhoort kism ke byorocretas or sarkaar ke mantriyon ne hamaari teenon senaaon ke javaanon or jesio rank ke sainiko ke vetan or pension ko tisare vetan ayog ke samay hi lagaataar kam karte huye hi ajmakar dekh liya jab ek jawan kaa muulavetan vetanman maatr 175 rupaye rakhaa or ek loar dibijan clerk kaa 235 rupaye prati maah or vaarshik briddhi 5 / - rupaye hamaare sena ke sheersh adhikariyon ne jawaano ke vetanman kii itani badi visangati par koi dhyaan nahi diya
 yahaan tak kii javaanon kii kam sarvice or jaldi ritairement hone kii bajah se unako antim vetanman kaa 75% par pension fiks kiya jaataa tha vah bhi ghataakar civillian karmchaariyon ke antim muulavetan ke baraabar hi 50% par kar diya vah bhi 33 barsh sarvice karne par xxrep 5 
 fouj phir bhi khamosh rahi magar vetan ayog ne yah jaanane kii koshish nahi samajhi ki ek jawan jisaki kul sarvice hi 15 barsh hoti he vah antim pension kaa 50% kaise paayegaa nateeja jo jawan ko 75% mil rahaa tha vah 35% par pahunch gaya or civillian karmchaaree 35% letaa tha vah 50% pahunch gaya
 agar hamaari sena ke sheersh adhikariyon ne us samay is anyaay ke khilaaf birodh jataayaa hota to aaj yah sthati nahi hoti
 ab chate vetan ayog ne sarkari karmchaariyon kii antim mul vetan kaa 50% ko 33 barsh kii seva ke niyam se mukt kar diya or sabhi civillian sarkari karmchaariyon ko to pension me phayda hua or arier bhi praapt ho gaya lekin sena me alag se koi notification nahi nikaala jisaki bajah se sena ko purana 33 barsh kii seva par 50% pension kaa formula hi ab tak lagu he yani jo 15 se 20 barsh kii seva karne par ritair kar diye jate he unako apane mul vetan kaa 30 se 35% hi pension diya ja rahaa he xxrep 4 
 or yahaan tak ki is visangati ko dur karwaane ke liye garib javaanon ko supreme court kii sharan me janaa padaa tab majaboor hokar sarkaar ne apni galati ko mana or abhi yah aadesh sidie elahabaad ko lagu karne ke liye sarkaar se baankshit he
 In the Fourth Pay Commission which came into force in 1986, there was an attempt to make the army personnel and civilian employees almost equal, like the pay scale of the jawan also started from 935 / - and the Betan of the Lower Division Clerk was also from 950 / - but then Another game was played that the annual increase of the jawan was 15 / - while the lower division of the clerk was kept at 25 / - i
e
 the army and civilian employees were given an equal pay scale, but the army was free
 Are not open have been significant differences in habit led to repeat their allowances and annual increase has gone down significantly in the pension he compared the time civilian employees retirement led to or were too far behind in Punrribijn
 Because at that time this discrimination was limited only to the salaries of the jcos and jawans of the army, so the officers did not pay much attention to it
 In today's date, when the government and the bureaucrats played together with the officers and lowered the level of the army officers from the officers of the police and paramilitary, now the top officers of the army started having severe pain
 And from the Minister of Education to the Prime Minister, they are roaming around
 magar paanchave vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ne to phir se sena ke javaanon or jesio kii puri tarah se qamar tod di 


jiskaa mere paas rircard he or jiskaa birodh bhi yadpi dar or anushaasan kii bajah se thal sena ke jawan to nahi kar paye magar vaayu sena ke padhe likhe evam ucch vayuyan takneekee gyaan praapt javaanon ne kiya or badale me vayusena ne aise sabhi vaayu sainikon ko munh kholane kii sajaa ke taur par court marshall karke naukari se nikaal baahar kar diya or isi tarah sena me apana bhavishya andhakaarmay sonchakar anya sargent str ke kai vayusainiko ne is ghatana ke vaag primaor ritairement le liya uname se 90% khushkismat nikle jo adhiktar rashtriyakrut bainko me clerk -kam- kaisier se lekar branch manager tak ban kar puure 60 varshon tak naukari karte rahe
 khayr baad me jab thal sena or jal sena me bhi iskaa birodh hone laga to phir sarkaar chenti or sena ke jawan se jesio str tak sainiko ke liye ek bishesh vetan punarsanshodhan cameti banaakar pun: sanshodhit bethanman ko dubaara 10 Oct 1996 se lagu kiya jabaki pehle yah 01 Jan 1996 se vetan ayog ne lagu kiya
 lekin isame jesio ke naive soobedaar ko police ke sab inspector ke samaan rank kaa mana gaya or soobedaar ko inspector ke str kaa or soobedaar major ko maatr ek atirikt bethan briddhi dekar soobedaar ke samaan hi rakhaa lekin jab police ke samaan vetanman kii baat aayi to phir sarkaar yah to maan gayi ki sena kaa vetanman police se kam nahi hona chaiye balki us ke samaan yaa adhik hona chaiye or us samay ke mananeey rakshaamantri mulaayam singh ne to sena ko hameshaa ucch praathmita dene ke liye kaha or unke vyaktigat prayaas ke kaaran sena ke javaanon ko civil karmchaariyon yaa police ke mukaable vetanman zyada rakhaa gaya jisaki bajah se paanchave vetan ayog ke pun: sanshodhit vetanman me jesio or jawaano ko civil ke samaan str ke karmchaariyon se zyada vetanman milanaa shuru ho gaya or ek sainik kaa nimnatam vetanman 3250 / - ho gaya jabaki loar dibijan clerk kaa 3050 / - tha magar phir bhi yah byorocrates apni chaal khilne me peeche nahi hate or unki chaal kii bajah se naayab soobedaar y group kaa vetanman yaddapi 5620 / - se or soobedaar y group kaa 6600 / - se shuru tha jabaki police ke sab inspector kaa 5500 / - or inspector rank kaa 6500 / - se shuru kiya gaya lekin fouj ke naayab soobedaar ko vaarshik briddhi 140 / - rupaye rakhi or sab inspector kii 175 / - rakh di isi tarah soobedaar kii vaarshik briddhi 170 / - rupaye rakh di jabaki police inspector kii 200 / - kii gayi xxrep 4 
 xxrep 5 ! As a result of all these results, in the Pay Commission's decision to be held after every ten years, we soldiers always went further down in our pay scale and the pension received and our officers did not understand at that time
 This will prove to be very fatal for our army and it happened also where the soldiers continued to get frustrated about their salary and allowances and the reason for this is that they have their own Irsh officers seals and indifference jcos and believed to be desperate to own this ambition means Snbadhanik office receives award after retirement
 ab bhi samay he ki jaag jaaon or swaarth se upar uthakar puure sainik sanghathan kii aawaaj ko majbootee do
 tino senadhyakshon ne vetan ayog kii report ko maujuuda sthati me asweekaar kar diya he tathaa sarkaar se ek baar phir bisangatiyon ko dur karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 hame apni ladaayee khud milakar ladani hogi kyonki yah bhi ek karm yuddh he or mahabharat ke shrikrishna kaa dharmayuddh he jahaan par dhoort or beyimaan logon kaa sarvanaash nishchit he
 hame dukh is baat kaa nahi he ki hamaare vetan visangatiyo ko sarkaar ne kyon nahi dur kiya hame dukh tab hota he jo sarkaar desh par jaan qurbaan karne ko taiyaar sainikon kii jaij maango par adiyal rabaiya apanaatihai wohi sarkaar civillian karmchaariyon kii anushaasanheenata or hadtaal karne kii dhamkee ke aage ghutane tech detii he or unki jaij or nazaij maange sab maan leti he
 aakhir sainik kaa bhi apana ghar or parivaar hota he jisaki bhi usee tarah kii jaruratein hoti he jaisi anya civil karmchaariyon kii hoti he
 Discrimination even in ration !! aakhir kyon nahi ham bhartiya sena me angrejon kii banaayi huyi dwi stareey bhojan vyavastha badal sake jabaki desh aaazaad huye bhi 70 barsh ho chuke he or ham abhi bhi angrejon kii banaayi huyi vyavastha ko hi aage dhote chale ja rahe he
 Perhaps Indian military officers do not even know why the kitchen and residence of British officers were different from Indian soldiers
 mai isi mudde ko is forum me uthaanaa chahta tha ki aakhir ghar me chaaron ore se khidkiya band karke parde daal kar dhakne se baahar ke logon kii najar se andar kii cargujariyon par to pardaa daalaa ja saktaa he lekin andar ke logon kii haalat najarband gulaamon se badtar hoti jaati he
 Till such time the system is not transparent then such problems will come again and again
 aakhir hamaari sena ke andar kaig dwaara audit kyon nahi karaayaa jaataa
 After all, why did our system become the reason for the cag's warning despite the three-tier audit
 hamaari tristareey audit vyavastha kisi he or koun si he
 Unit Audit, Local Audit and Test Audit These three fail completely because there have been big scams and are happening continuously
 duniyaan ke paanch deshon ke alaava kisi bhi desh me sena me teen tarah ke alag alag bhojanalay nahi hote or na hi sainik yaa sainik adhikariyon ke rashan kii maatra or gunvattta me bhedbhaav nahi he par yahaan he
 Even where there was discrimination, this system was abolished in those countries, but in India, this system made according to the convenience of the British continues even after seventy years of independence of the country
 isse bhedbhaav or asantosh failata he
 Just consider why the officers' restaurants were different from the restaurants of the soldiers
 uske do mahatvapurn kaaran the jinako aaj ke samay me auchitypurna nahi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 The first reason was that the British were officers and the Indians were low level officers and soldiers and the food and habits of the British were different
 jaise vah bread vater yani unka bhojan 70% radimaid or packed food hota tha jo bidesh se yaa britain se hi aata tha or jinka pement khud angrej afasar apane vetan se karte the royal indian army ke bajet se pement nahi hota tha
 But the food and eating habits of Indian soldiers were completely Indian and they needed fresh food which could be made mainly in Indian kitchens
 duusari baat yah he ki angrej adhikari gaay or suar donon kaa maance khate the jo bhartiya sainiko kii rasoi me nahi ban saktaa tha
 The third thing was that they had a separate restaurant because their food was not free, whereas the ration of the soldiers was absolutely free, and because of the arrangement that no officer from the free ration could manage food for himself, so an on duty officer Except an official was prohibited from going to Indian kitchen
 aaj k paristhitiyon me jabaki saare adhikari or sainik bhartiya he, khaane kii aadate bhi bhartiya he or rashan bhi bhartiya he tathaa dono ko bilkul muft he to bhojan kii maatra or gunvattta donon ko ek jaisi honi chaiye or ek jagah hi sabakaa bhojan bananaa chaiye or beshak khaane kaa dining teble alag alag ho
 
 
 
 jaise kisi bhartiya restaurant me miltaa he
 Is such a system possible and not possible in the Indian Army, at any time, the cries of unity in this country will remain confined only to the speeches or even in the manifestos
 yah mere nijee bichaar he tathaa ho saktaa he ki kuch logon ko yah vyavastha parivartan pasand na aaye

 Karl marx vartmaan bhartiya sainya samaaj Sitting yesterday, i was wondering what was lacking over time despite our multi-million year old culture that some people from European and Arab countries, who have complete food in their area, have also been reduced in the last thousand years, especially last 300 years ago
 It was not and the weather was such that even the struggle to live kept on robbing us and our systems were destroyed according to the system, symbols of our Aan, Shaan and Faith
 He and our daughters-in-law and daughters plundered the land and kept us slaves in our house
 kuch aatmanirikshan ke baad do chaar khaas baat saamne aati hai jo is sabake liye jimmedaar rahi
 1) The people of society, religion and government should fulfill their responsibility and duty and do not work and concentrate on how to make the whole system so that all the rubbish will continue to come to them and whatever they want
 No matter how unworthy he may be the successor, for this, he has to do anything and by crossing all the limits of greed to become in control of the whole system to such an extent that the whole system is heap Danced 2) jatigat vyavastha kaa sthaayee ho janaa jisame kaam badalane kii thodi bahut bhi swatantraaa naa ho
 Just like if ever there was a war, only two percent of the men would not make any sense to fight
 kisi samaaj main jati pratha apane shoshan ke krurtam rup main he yaa nahin ye kaise janenge
 It has some dimensions, such as 1) pehali nishaani ye hoti he ki unchi or nichi jati ke rahane, khaane ,khilne or samaaroh kii alag alag jagah hoti he
 2) The lower caste people will cook food, put tent, place banquet in their ceremony etc
 They will see their financial arrangements but cannot attend the ceremony
 lekin agar k bhi nashe main dhut manodasha main ki si unchi jati vaale ne kabhi kisi samaaroh main kaam karne vaale ko daaru yaa khaane ke liye puch liya to puure samaaj main taareef karata rahegaa
 3) The lower caste person will have a crate of responsibilities on his head and his legs will be wide but he will not have the rights
 agar wo yatha sambhav tareeke se bhi apni jimmedaari nibhaa rahaa to bhi kya he paise puure nahin le rahaa he kya? lekin agar galati se bhi galati ho jaye tosarvajaanik taur pe gaali galoch ke saath dhamkaaya ja saktaa he
 4) Even if a family gathering was organized, it would be ensured that separate arrangements for access, seating, utensils etc
 would be maintained for both groups
 kisi bhi saamaajik prasang main unchi jati vaala kisi baat yaa bina baat dhamka saktaa he jiske do parinaam honge ek to us samay wo sahamaa hua apamaanit mahasoos karegaa dusre uskaa aatmavishvaas sadaa ke liye kam rahegaa or saamaajik prasango main vah bechaara konaa dhundta or bagale jhaankta nazar aayega ki koi kahin kuch suna na de
 It will be expected from the lower caste that as he comes, he will bow with salute and not only his hands but his whole body will stand together
 5) unchi jati vaale ko agar apana kaam bhi naa pataa ho to bhi jhuthe bharose main rahaa jo desh or samaaj ke liye bhaar hi rahaa jabaki sambhavit kshamta ke saath usamen purnataa kaa tha
 Despite being low-caste capable, he remained a discouraged productive capacity holder for the system and system
 or apane vajood ko lekar kabhi suvidha main nahin balki duvidha main hi rahaa
 6) The result of all this is that a large part of our society continued to be less fertile and jugular and the entire country society and system suffered its brunt

 What can be such a great objective


 for which even anti-national activity is acceptable to these beings 

 That is the only reason to stop the truth from appearing 

 The only objective of all these unified beings is to prove Narendra Modi unsuccessful


 and this Truth has to be taken beyond public eyes
 How much change

 public interest is possible through the use of loyalty and honesty of the resources of the nation 


 Once the polices of the systematic corruption system of his time were exposed, it is impossible to return to power
 The existential crisis is an unsuccessful exercise to prevent these traitors from revealing their malpractices 

 and to save their political

 Disciples, collaborators and family environment, two reasons for the creation of Tantralok, two reasons inspired Abhinavagupta to write Tantralok
 He was a very firm and reverent request by his disciples and classmates, and under the command of his mentor 'somasambhu' or Shambhunath as a complete scriptural Tantraloka
 Began to write for abhinav tantralok upsanhaar main tantralok kii rachana sahaayak sadhanrup apane pradhan shishyo kaa ullekh kiya he
 Among them, his brother Manorath comes first

 Among these, the names of Sauram's sonamandra, Kshem, Utpal Abhinav, Chakrak, Padyagupta and Ramgupta are mentioned in detail
 kuch or logon ne abhinav se krupa kii yachana jise krupaluhridayvaale acharya abhinav asweekaar nahi kar sake, kintu unke naam kaa kahin varnan nahi miltaa he
 The names of Manorath, Karna and Utpal are taken in the epilogue shlokas of paratriatha description
 abhinav ke bhai manorath sarvashaastravetta tathaa shiv kii parabhakti se yukt the
 Karna was still young, however, he got away from worldly attractions and got serious entry into Shaiva discipline
 karn ne mandra ke saath abhinav se yah nivedan kiya tha ki ve ‘malinivijyottar’ tantra par ek tikaa likhe
 There was also a son named Yogeshwaridutt, far away from Karna's worldly instinct and with the same qualities as his name

 Although she was older than Abhinav, she considered Abhinav to be a guru and not a wise man
 aage ham ramgupta kaa varnan pate he jinhe abhinav ‘paratrinshika vivaran’ main ramdev kehete he
 According to Paratrinshika description, Ramdev was a master of grammar, epistemology and logic
 abhinav ke pancho chachere bhai jinka varnan abhinav ne upsanhaar shloke main kiya he ve sabhi samast vishyakarshanon ko nirast karte hue shiv kii purna bhakti main pravesh paa chuke the
 We are not able to prove clearly that the author of many famous texts and commentaries 'shebhraj' is his cousin Kshem or someone else, but some circumstantial evidence confirms this fact

 Vatsalika, who was the wife of Kisauri, Abhinav is called Bhandra's aunt and who was full of gracious personality
 abhinav ne inhi kii kripapurna vyaktitva se yukt thi
 Abhinav has graciously looked after him, considering his residence in a town a suitable place for his literary creation
 in sabhi longon kii samavet prarthana ne hi abhinav ko tantralok kii rachana hetu vivash kar diya us prarthana ko thik usee prakaar asweekaar nahi kar sake jaise ek nartki jo ki nartan kii icchhuk he kisi vaadyayantra ke vaadan ke samay apane upar niyantran nahi kar sakati
 Tantralok, the collection site of Tantralok, was written in the house of a temple located in a town where his aunt Vatsalika, while convincing her name, succeeded in writing her own superlative text for her
 acharya abhinav kaa kavi hriday, unke kavy kaa prayek shabd batsalika ke pratikritagyata se paripurna hokar vatsalika ke upar barasata he
 Vatsalika was the wife of Sauri's wife, who was the minister of state, and who later resigned after completing her devotion to Shiva
 abhinavgupt yadhyapi apane jeevanavrutt or paristhitiyon ke sambandh main paryaapt vivaran dete hai tathaapi ve apane samay ke sambandh main koi bhi pratyaksh sanket nahi dete hai
 Abhinav's position is clearly definite

 Karna was certainly a contemporary of Abhinav

 Abhinav was an eyewitness to Karna's death
 karn, abhinav ke niwat sambandhi hone ke saath saath abhinav ke atyant jigyaasu shishy thi
 Karna died at a relatively young age when his son Yogeshwari Dutt had grown up
 ‘paratrinshika vivaran’ main vaarnit tathyon kii putr the jo samraat yashaskar kii sabha main varisht athwa pradhanmantri the
 Yashkar is definitely known that his reign was in 939 AD
 abhinavgupt samarat yashaskar ke tritiy peedi ke samay main tantralok kaa lekhan kaarykar rahe the
 At that time he was in a very mature state
 tathaa uski sweekrut tithi 950 se 1025 i0 main samaanveet hoti he
 The form of Tantralok is a demonstration that Tantralok is probably the most serious and original work of Abhinavagupta
 jabaki anek mahatvapurn tathaa samakaleen athwa purvavarti kritiyon par unki tikaayen hai
 Here the above facts can be seen in a mirror like a system like this - tantralok kaa vaishishty tantralok ke antahpraant tathaa chaturdik drushtipaat se hamen gambheer antajryaan se atyant deept uskaa vividh swaroop drusht hota he
 The author of the Rijuvimarshini of about the 12th century called it 'trikashastra' or 'trikasara Shastra' and as its illustration, he cites only the lines of Tantraloka
 atev aisa prathit hota he ki yah granth us samay tak trik parampara kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala sarvaadhik mahatvapurn granth ho gaya tha
 The famous disciple of Abhinavagupta, Kshemraj, tells two important facts about this book - abhinavgupt ne tantrasar main sankshepatah varnan karte hue kaha he ki tantralok main vaidic vidhi, nishedhon se lekar shaiva, tantra, kul or trik parampara ke mat uplabdh hai
 This fact is repeatedly described in detail in Tantraloka
 antat tantralok kaa yah swaroop spasht ho jaataa he ki ‘‘trik-parampara’’ par abhinavgupt dwaara prastut yah ek maatr ativishisht or adhikrut granth he
 According to 'tantrasara', Tantraloka is not only the corpus of the Agam tradition, but it is a critical treatise for analyzing Tantra's mutual distinction of knowledge and inward distinction
 dhvanyalok kii lochan-tikaa main aa0 abhinav ke anusaar tantralok kaa kendriya bhav us paramsatta ke chaturdik ghumta he jise ‘anuttar’ kaha gaya he
 The main purpose of Tantraloka is to reveal and analyze it, defining the subject
 is prakaar tantralok ek tikaa kaa rup le letaa he
 Therefore, it has been called pratik, shloka pratik and conspiratorial
 sambhavtah aa0 abhinavgupt ko vaarthik naam dene kii prerana katyayan ke vaartikon se mili
 Where talk is defined as a reflection of the meaning of the above, the meaning and the meaning
 yah spasht dikhaayi detaa he ki tantralok is paribhaasha ko purnataya aatmsaat karata he kahin-kahin aa0 abhinavgupt ne tantralok ko agmadhaarit samast tikaa prakaaron kaa mishrit rup kaha he
 In this way, Tantraloka takes the form of simultaneous speech and instinct
 sambhavtah yahi kaaran he ki kinhi vishisht vishyon ke vyakhya or vishleshan ke sandarbh main tantralok pramanik granth kaha gaya he
 This Tantraloka is sometimes called 'tantraloka'
 abhinavgupt ne tantralok kii rachana vividh drushtiyon se kii
 The first and most influential reason was the classification of available Tantric literature and traditional tantra
 atah takneekee drushti se tantralok ek sangrah granth he
 The basic purpose of the work of A
 Abhinavagupta was to collect not only the tantric sources but also the three-dimensional tradition from the Agama literature
 Abhinav himself has considered in this context
 unka spasht uddeshy apane vichaaron ko aagam parampara ke saar ke rup main prastut karnaa tha jisamen ve sarvatha upyukt siddh hue
 Which Jayarath has endorsed by calling Abhinavagupta a collector
 aa0 abhinav dwitiya kintu atyant mahatvapurn uddeshy prakriya athwa paddati ko prastut karnaa tha
 Abhinavagupta was saddened by the absence of any method and process scripture in the a अनुडāक्रमaraडadhārākramā tradition, best recognized among the various principles and methods
 This vacancy was a matter of concern
 isaki sampoorti hetu aa0 abhinav ne prayek drushti se purna prakriya granth ke rup main likhane kaa nishchay kiya
 However, both Abhinavagupta and Vivek commentator Jairath of Tantraloka do not provide clear knowledge in terms of the style of process book
 tathaapi jayrath aa0 abhinavgupt ke prakriya granth rachanarup uddeshy kii soochna se paripurna hai
 In this context, 4 conclusions are available
 ab tantralok kaa prakriya se taatpary kya he ? yah dekhte hai
 If we look at the 14th and 15th verses of the first verse of Tantraloka, we find that the words process and method indicate the same meaning and the other noticeable fact is that both words refer to the texts of a particular class
 swaabhaavik rup main yahan vaiyakarnon kaa prakriya shabd kaa vyutpattiparak arth anakanksh he
 According to the Vachaspatyam, the word process means a chapter or a serialized episode
 jabaki shabdakalpadrup ke anusaar prakriya shabd kaa arth niyatvidhi he is prakaar yahan paddati ek nishchit bhavarth bodhak granth kaa rup le leti he
 Both the Vachspatyam and the Shabdakalpadrup agree with this fact and cite Hemachandra's name for support
 in shabdkoshkaron ke anusaar prakriyagranth kisi vishay ke mulabhipraay ko vyakt karne hetu uski prakriya kaa prakaton karata he
 From the subtle study of Tantraloka, it becomes clear that the process theory of A
 Abhinav is very close to the definition of the said process
 abhinavgupt tantralok main ‘paratrishika’ ko anutarprakriya kehete hai
 This statement alone is sufficient to consider the paratroika details as well
 aa0 abhinavgupt anya sthanon par ‘prakriya’ shabd kaa prayog ‘sadhana’ ke artho main bhi karte he
 This fact becomes even more convincing when Abhinav Swachata Tantra quotes this statement as 'there is no better knowledge than process'
 jayrath prakriya bhed ke kaaran tantro me paraspar bhed ko spasht karte hue samast andeh nirast kar dete hai
 In this way, it can be clearly said that the text presenting the specific cultivation methods of law-prohibitive and method-prohibitive is called process texts
 jaisaa ki gyaat he abhinav is prakriya arth main dwitiya shabd paddati kaa prayog karte he
 But what was the ideal form of his method? It is unknown however, that he cites a method of 'ishanasiva' which presents the basic motif of the method and which is described in the Devyamala Granth
 yah ishanshiv nischitarup se gurudev paddati athwa tantra paddati ke rachayita apane samanaam ishanshiv se bhinn hai
 Which certainly happened after 1073 AD
 da0 ramachandra dvivedi ke anusaar ‘karmkandawali’ granth ke lekhak somashmbhu ‘ishanshiv’ ke paramguru the
 According to Kshemraj, Shiva, a teacher of Abhinav, wrote a method which Abhinav has quoted but did not mention his name, starting indirectly in this tradition
 yah sambhav he ki vibhinn paddatiyon tathaa unamem se ek kaa bhi unki parampara ko prastut na karnaa aa0 abhinav ke dukh kaa kaaran thi
 The famous text of the 'nath-sampradaya', 'siddhasiddhantapaddhati', which is very conservative, is full of quotations from the 'pratibhagya' sect and refers to the texts of the tradition in general
 is prakaar yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa tarksangat he ki tantralok prakriya athwa paddati granth he or ‘trik’ jeevandarshan kaa sarvangpurn niamak granth he
 Abhinava's third objective was to present Tantraloka as a perfect scripture or rule
 jaisaa ki parvarti samay main yah asandigdh rup se prakriya shaastra ke rup ko uplabdh ho gaya tha
 Hence Jayarath reminds Abhinavagupta as a frequent scribe
 jayrath apane adhivaakya tathaa vivek tikaa ke prarambh main tantralok ke shastreey swaroop ko nimnavat prastut karte hai
 Since the contract of any scripture is quadrangle, Jairath also establishes contractual contraction which is - 1
 Subject, 2
 Purpose, 3
 Officer, 4
 Relation
 inkaa kramik vivaran is prakaar he- Apart from this, Ganesh and Batuk have also been praised in the form of causal Mangalacharan form for the beginning of the dissolution of each scripture
 abhinav apane chaturth antim prayaas ke antargat ‘tantralok’ ko purnatah stuti granth ke rup main kendrit karte hai
 They do not leave any kind of doubt at the end of their undertaking sentences and initial preamble verses, and likewise in the epilogue verses
 unhen jab bhi avasar praapt hota he ve tantralok bhakthi tathaa samarpan bhaavon ko vyakt karte hai
 The Tantraloka in their eyes attains meaning with a holistic appearance when they are oriented towards Shaktipotik, the Shaivism
 tantralok is alolik bhavoplabdhi ke maarg tathaa prakriya donon kaa varnan ati spasht sahajata ke karata he
 With just as much ease, as a person's style of routine keeps on completing automatically, effortlessly
 ve sahjavastha ke charam shikhar par arudh hokar, agyanadhwant rahit apane anubhutiyon ko vakprasun ke madhyam se bekhari dharaatal par vikirnit karte hue kehete hai-‘‘jab koi is shaivi bhav se yukt ho jaataa he tab uske hriday ke sandehon ke megh swayammev chhin-bhinn ho jate hai or hridayakash main paramshivaroop gyaan kaa surya udit athwa prakaashmaan ho jaataa he
 This highly expressive statement of the Tantraalakara communicates faith in the hearts of the innovators and leads them to full attainment, who rise above the universe and are engrossed in the essence of metaphysics
 maatr isi gahanbhaktipurna bhaavana dwaara hi tantralok ke prakriyaatmak swaroop kii vivechna kii ja sakati he
 Probably this approach has been glorified in the undertaking and epilogue of Tantraloka
 tantralok ke sookshm adhyayan se hamen is rachana ke peeche aa0 abhinavgupt ke uddeshy kaa spashtatah bodh hota he
 a new all-purpose objective is the attainment of Bhairava Bhavavavabhada or Bhairava identification
 aa0 abhinav yah sagarv udghoshnaa karte hai ki tantralok ke 37 ahnikon main vanart vishay kaa nirantar abhyaas karanevaala saakshaat bhairav swaroop ho jaayegaa aa0 abhinav samast tantralok main is uddeshy se ranch-maatr bhi skhlit nahin hote hai aa0 abhinav anuswaroop jeev ke chaitanya ke vikaas kaa path nirdisht karte hue uske anutv ke vilay purvak swatmapratyabhigyaan dwaara brahmandswarupata kii prapti ke madhya aanevaale samast sopanon kaa kramik vishleshan karte hai
 A
 Abhinav does not get tired of calling his priorities time and again
 ve kehete hai ki tantralok main unki vaastavik patibaddhta anuttarajipti kii prastuti ke saath he
 The enlightenment that is the cause of liberation is designed for the rise of all belief and full spirit
 aa0 abhinav dhvanyalok kii lochantika main yah uddhrut karte hai ki tantralok kaa kendriya bhav us advay parmeshwar bhav kii siddhi he
 According to A
 Abhinav, the only force of power is the driving force of Mumukha
 ve bandhan se mukti kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke prati sarvaadhik sachet hai
 As the Abhinavas go ahead by clarifying that Tantraloka is basically a self-knowledgeist form, a genius
 is pratibh samvedan ke abhyaas ke samanantar sampoorn bodh hone ke kaaran vyakti ‘pratibh guru’ ho jaataa he jiske ‘krupa-kataaksh’ maatr se samast jagat bhairav taadaatmayata ko praapt ho saktaa he
 Both Abhinav and Tantralok commentator Jairath do not consider it to be praise for their work, but say that the above statement is true
 tantralok kii prastuti antim adhikrut granthrup anya uddeshy ko saamne laata he
 Self realization is the ultimate goal of all spiritual communities and the most important reason for this is introspection
 is sarvocch vaiyaktik uplabdhi main tantralok se bhinn kii anya granth kii kaaranta sakasham nahin he
 The autonomy of A
 Abhinav, the unfailing reasoner in Hayopadaya's decision, the absolute authority over all theology and the deep knowledge of the triad-tradition, all of them are oriented towards the same unanswered element, and all are interconnected, the deep seriousness and the very elaboration of the rendering of A
 Abhinav
 Provide
 koi bhi gyaan anubhuti str ko praapt karne tak teen str ko praapt hota he
 Jairath gives an indirect indication that the intellectual and spiritual splendor of Aat Abhinav, his sastramukhagam-nijanubhavibasiddha Swatam Sanvishit form reveals the cosmic personality with full knowledge
 katipay paristhitiyon vash nahin, varan yatharthatah tantralok ek adarshapurna tathaa pramanik granth he jo ki trik-parampara kaa prastota he
 A
 Abhinav considers the simple presentation of tantric methods and knowledge by Tantraloka as the third objective
 is bindu ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhone unheen vishyon or avadharanaon ko apni vivechna kaa vishay banaaya
 So that everyone can benefit
 inhone vivaadit vishyon ko prastut karte hue uski saral vyakhya kii
 Careful observation of Tantraloka has another objective view of Abhinav in the background of the compilation which has been established very carefully
 ‘vah trik tantra parampara kaa niyaman or suraksha he
 'out of his three examples, the first at the beginning of Tantraloka' Sampradayochitzhitai 'and the remaining two' Vidambita 'in the Madhyas and the corrupt ones are clearly explained by his view
 prarambh se aa0 abhinav yah suchit karte hai ki kuch log jo shastron main pandit the parantu parampararahit hone ke kaaran trikgyanopalabdh nahi ho sake
 The second example implies that there were some people who neither studied the scriptures nor waited or searched for the mentor
 is prakaar saralata se digbhramit ho gaye
 The third quotation indicates that specific and essential parts of some traditional knowledge have either disappeared or become distorted such that the exploration of their original form was impossible
 pratham tathaa dwitiya avasthaa main aa0 abhinav ne apane parmparik gyaan or medha kaa prayog kiya tritiy avasthaa main unhone anya vikalpon ke rup main ‘nyaas-vidhi’ kaa prayog kiya jise ‘malini’ kaha he
 Jairath Tantralok testifies that wherever Abhinav quotes a forward tradition and opinion, he contradicts the contrary and illusory concept and installs it in its true form by its unique merit
 Huh
 is prakaar ukt strot se sanmbandhit gyaan ko or samrudh karte he
 Under this discussion, we come to the conclusion that one of the aims of Abhinav was to make available and safeguarding the future for the future by reviving traditional Tantric literature and practice
 is sandarbh unki style or vidhiyo kaa pareekshan karte hue kuch or tathy kahe ja sakate hai
 By focusing on the facts mentioned earlier, we can divide the purpose and efforts of Abhinav into two categories
 First 1
 Declared 2
 Second undeclared, which can be called briefly as follows
 kaaran 1
 Announced - 1
 sarabhag ke rup main 2
 As a process book 3
 stuti ke rup main Underlined uddeshy - 1
 swatm pratybhigyaan or dusro ko bhi isi hetu unmukh karnaa Declared - Presentation of the enlightenment due to the accomplishment of liberation 2
 parmparik tantragyan kaa saral vivechan Announced - Presentation of the last authorized book of literature and literature of Tantric tradition 1

 gulam vansh ke samay main yah bhoomi kilokari kile main hua karti thi or nasiruddin ke putr tatkaaleen sultan kekubad kii rajdhani hua karti thi
 The main building here is the mausoleum of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and it also has graves of many other royal people including Humayun's tomb
 yah samooh vishwa dharohar ghoshit he, evam bharat main mughal vaastukala kaa pratham udhaaharan he
 This tomb has the same Charbag style that gave birth to the Taj Mahal in future
 yah makbara humayun kii vidhwaa begum hamida bano begum ke aadeshaanusaar 1562 main bana tha
 The architect of this building was Syed Mubarak ibn Mirak Ghiyathuddin and his father Mirak Ghuiyathuddin who was specially summoned from Herat city in Afghanistan

 This building underwent a major change in Mughal architecture, whose main part was Charbagh style gardens
 aise udyaan bharat main isse purv kabhi nahin dikhe the or iske baad anek imaaraton kaa abhinn ang banate gayi
 This tomb was completely different from the tomb Bagh e Babur in Kabul of Humayun's father Babur, built by the Mughals earlier
 babar ke saath hi samraaton ko baag main bane makbaron main dafn karne kii parampara aarambh hui thi
 This building, based on the mausoleum built in Samarkand of his ancestor Timur Lang, became the inspiration for the tombs of Mughal architecture going forward in India
 ye sthapaty apane charam par tajmahal ke saath pahunchaa
 The site was chosen for the mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna river because of its proximity to Hazrat Nizamuddin
 sant nizamuddin dilli ke prasiddh sufi sant hue hai va inhen dilli ke shaskaon dwaara kaafii mana gaya he
 His then residence was also located in the chilla-nizamuddin Auliya, in the north-east direction from the place of the tomb
 baad ke mughal itihaas main mughal samraat bahadur shah zafar ne teen anya rajkumaron sahit 1857 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan yahaan sharan lee thi
 He was subsequently arrested by Captain Hodgson of the British Army from here and was later imprisoned in Rangoon
 dilli se apane vidaa hone ko bahadur shah zafar ne in shabdon main baandha he: As Shama wept, she left this anjuman
 —bahadur shah zafar, Under the rule of the Ghulam dynasty, the area was located in the Kilokari Fort, which used to be the capital of the then Sultan Kekubad, the son of Naseeruddin
 20 janvari 1556 ko, humayun kii mrityu uparaant use pehle to dilli main hi dafnaaya gaya or baad main 1558 main khanjarbeg dwaara punjab ke sarhind le jaaya gaya
 Later, the Mughal emperor Akbar saw his father's tomb in 1571
 makbare kaa nirmaan hamida bano begum ke aadeshaanusaar 1562 main humayu kii mrityu ke 9 varsh uparaant aarambh hua tha
 Then it cost 15 lakh rupees

 According to abd-el-qadir Badanyuni, a contemporary historian, the tomb was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, who was specially called for this building from Herat, Bukhara
 inhone heraat kii or bharat kii bhi kai imaaraton kii abhiklpana kii thi
 He passed away before the completion of this building, but his son Syed Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyathuddin completed his father's work and the tomb was completed in 1571

 Other monuments located outside the main boundary in this complex are prominent: the tomb of Bu Halima and its gardens
 ye makbara ab dhwans ho chukaa he or avasheshon se gyaat hota he ki ye kendra main sthit nahin tha
 This suggests that it may have been added later
 iske baad aati he arab sarai jise hamida begum ne mukhya makbare ke nirmaan main lage kaarigaron ke liye banwaaya tha
 The officer's tomb is also built in this complex, which was built for a Nawab of Akbar

 Its name is derived from the sky region where it appears, the Andromeda constellation and is named after the legendary princess Andromeda
 andromeda sthaneey samooh kaa sabase bada tarapunj he jisamen andromenda tarapunj, akashganga tarapunj, triyangulam tarapunj or 30 anya chote tarapunj shaamil hai
 However, the largest Andromeda is not very large, as recent discoveries have shown that there are many hidden cases in the galaxy and which may have even more giant forms

 At the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda galaxy at 3
4, it is one of the brightest messier planets that can be seen easily with the naked eye, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution
 However when its image is taken by a large telescope, it is visible six times as compared to the full moon, then only its bright part can be seen with naked eyes or small telescope

 Andromeda Tarapunja The earliest recorded observations were made in 964 BCE by the Persian astronomer, Abad al-rahman al-sufi, who interpreted it as a "small cloud" in his epistemological book
 us samay ke anya tara chitron main ise little cloud ke rup main ankit kiya gaya tha
 The first description of the planet was made in 1612 by German astronomer Simone Marius, based on observations made by binoculars
 charles mesir ne ise 1764 main M31 grah ke rup main soochibaddh kiya or iskaa khojakarta ke rup main shrey galati se marius ko diya gaya, jo sufi al ke pehle kaary se anbhigya the
 In 1785, astronomer William Herschel noted the blurred red color in the core area of M31
 unka maananaa tha ki yah "mahaan nebula" main sabase nikatatam he or nebula ke rang or aakaar ke aadhaar par unhone galat anumaan lagaaya ki yah sirius kii duuri kii tulana main 2000 guna se adhik bada nahin he
 In 1864, William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and found it to be different from the gaseous nebula
 M31 ke spectra aavritiyon kii nirantarata ke liye pradarshit gahari avasorana rekhaon kaa nirmaan parat ke rup main karti he jo kisi padaarth ke rasinic mishran kii pahchaan karne main madad karte hai
 The Andromeda Nebula was very similar to the spectra of different stars that originated in which the M31 had a stellar nature
 1885 main, supernova ko pehali baar M31 main dekha gaya, jise is tarapunj main keval ek hi baar dekha gaya
 M31 was thought to be the closest planet at the time, so the object was close to an idea, so this fantasy could not gain much popularity, and this unrelated event was called Nova and named it "nova 1885"
 Gone
 M31 kii pehali tasviir 1857 main, isaac robert dwaara apni nijee vedhashala, sasex, england main lee gai thi
 The spiral structure of Tarapunja was first noticed after a long period of revelations
 haalanki, us samay ise hamaare tarapunj main aamtaur par nebula samajha jaataa tha or robert ne galati se sochaa ki M31 or isi tarah ke sarpilaakaar nebula vastav main saura mandal kii sanrachana kaa hi swaroop he jise satellite necent planets kii madad se liye gaye the
 The radial velocity of this planet in relation to our solar system was measured by Westo Slifer in 1912 at the Lowell Observatory, using spectroscopy
 jiske parinamswaroop us samay surya kii disha 300 kilometres per second main iskaa veg bahut adhik tej record kiya gaya
 In 1917, the American astronomer Heber Curtis saw the Nova in M31
 Searching for photo records, he discovered 11 more novels
 curtis ne dekha he ki un novon kaa ausatan aakaar tarapunj main sthit novon ke aakaar se 10 guna dhundhala tha
 As a result, he could be seen from an estimated 500,000 light years away
 isliye vah tathakthith "dweepiya brahmad" pariklpana prastaavak ban gaya, jo is sarpilaakaar nebula tha vastav main vah swatantra tarapunj tha
 In 1920, a great debate began between Harley Sharpley and Curtis concerning the galaxy, the spiral nebula, and the dimensions of the universe
 mahaan andromeda nebula bahya tarapunj tha, daawey ke samarthan main curtis ne hamaare tarapunj main dhundhale badalon se milti julati gahari rekhaon kii banaavat dekhi evam vishesh dopalar shift ko dekha gaya
 In 1922, Ernest Opik presented a very beautiful and simple astronomical method of estimating the distance of M31
 usne hamaare tarapunj ko andromeda se lagbhag 450 kepisi rakhaa, jo lagbhag 1500 keelvai he
 Edwin Hubel began this debate in 1925 when he first identified various cepheid stars beyond the Akash Ganga for an astrophysical image of M31

 As a result of which his measurements demonstrated that his feature was not the mass of stars and gas in our galaxy, but he was located at a completely different special distance from our galaxy
 andromeda ne mandakaniyon ke adhyayan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai, kyonki yah sabase nikatatam sarpilaakaar akashganga he 
 In 1943, Walter Bade was the first to find a solution of stars in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy

 Andromeda galaxy radio emission was detected in 1940 by radio astronomy major Grote Reber
 akashganga kaa sabase pehla radio maanchitr 1950 main johan baldwin ne cambridge radio khagol vigyaan samooh ke sahyog se banaaya tha
 The core of the Andromeda galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C Radio Astronomy Handbook
 2009 main, pehle grah ko andromeda akashganga main khoja ja sakaa
 The planet was detected using a technique called microlensing, which arises due to the optical reflections of giant planets
 andromeda akashganga kii maapi gai duuri 1953 main doguni thi jab ise khoja gaya ta vah mandakini kaa doosraa dhimaa prakaar he
 In the 1990s, both standard red giant and red mass stars were used to measure the distances of galaxies in the measurement of the Hipparcos satellite

 It is revealed that M31 may have had a great composition phase in the past but it is quieter than before but the star formation seems to be more active than it is in the galaxy
 kya yah chalata rahegaa, to akashganga kii chamak bhavishya main M31 kii tulana main adhik tej ho sakati he
 Based on its design in visible light, the Andromeda galaxy is classified as sab and the spiral galaxies system as de vécoleurs-sandéz
 However, data from Survey 2MASS showed that the structure of M31 emerged from a box
 Which means that the galaxy is actually seen to be linearly reflected almost as its vertical axis
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne kek telescope kaa upyog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki taron kaa timatimaana akashganga ke baahar kii ore badhata jaataa he jo vastav main mukhya discs kaa hi ek hissaa he
 This means that the spiral disk of stars in Andromeda is three times larger than the previous estimate
 nirantar saakshyon se pataa chalata he usamen ek vishaal taarakeey discs he jo akashganga ke vyas ko 220,000 prakaash varsh se adhik badhaati he
 Previously, the size of Andromeda was estimated to be around 70,000 to 120,000 light years
 akashganga prithvi kii tulana main ek taraf lagbhag 77 ° jhuki hui he 
 akashganga kii tiryak kaat ke aakaar kaa vishleshan use samtal discs kii tulana main ek ati spasht, S-aakaar jhukaav ko darshata he
 Possible reasons for such an inclination may be satellite galaxy gravity near M31
 akashganga M33 main M31 ke kaaran kuch jhukaav sambhav he, haalanki yah uski yathavat duuri or trigyakaar vegon par nirbhar karata he
 In the section of the spectroscopy study, different rotational velocity measurements of M31 are explained
 uske antarvaaag ke nazadik, vibhinn 1,300 prakaash varsh prakaash varsh kii trigya par 225 kilometres per second kii ucchata vaale ghurnankaree veg main dekhe gaye hai or tab usamen 7,000 prakaash varsh kii nunatam giravat dekhi gai he jiskaa ghurnankaree veg 50 kilometres per second tak ho saktaa he
 Thereafter, its velocity steadily increases to a radius of 33,000 light years, reaching a peak of 250 kilometres per second
 duuri badhane ke saath-saath iske veg main giravat aati chali jaati he, jisamen 200 kilometres per second se 80,000 prakaash varsh kii giravat sambhav he
 These velocities measure the concentric mass in the navel to be approximately 6 × 109 M☉
 akashganga ke kul dravyaman main rekhiy rup main 45,000 prakaash varsh vruddhi hoti he or uske baad isaki trigya main kami hoti jaati he
 Andromeda's spiral arm extends to the h II region, which Bade has interpreted as "scattered beads of beads"
 ve aapas main bahut adhik sate hue dikhaai padate hai, haalanki ve hamaari akashganga main dur-duure tak faile hue hai
 Refined images of the Milky Way clearly depict a two-arm galaxy rotating clockwise
 isaki do anugami poonch ke samaan bhujaaen ek duusare se kam se kam duuri 13,000 prakaash varsh par ek duusare ko alag karti hai
 They appear to be spread over a distance of about 1,600 light-years from the core
 iske sarpilaakaar ko mukhya rup se M32 ke sampark main aane ko mana jaataa he
 It can be seen migrating from the neutral hydrogen clouds of stars
 1998 main, european antariksh vedhashala chhaviyon europea antariksh agency infrared spes oborbetary chhaviyon kaa pradarshan valyakaar akashganga main pargaman kar sakati he
 In Andromeda, gas and dust form many annular forms, which form a ring especially with a radius 32,000 light years from its core
 yah valay akashganga ke drishyman prakaash chhaviyon se chipa hua he kyonki yah mukhya rup se thandi dhul se bana dhul se bana he
 On examining the inner region of Andromeda, small particles have been detected in its ring and it is thought that this may have occurred as a result of exposure to M32 200 million years ago
 iskaa anukaran karne par pataa lagata he ki choti akashganga uttararddh ke dhruviya dhuree ke saath andromeda kii discs guzari
 isaki takkar ke kaaran chote M32 ke aadhe se adhik pindon ko alag kar diya or andromeda main valyakaar sancharana kii rachana hui
 Studies of the enhanced halo of M31 showed that it is not possible to compare it to the Milky Way because the aura of stars usually contains "insufficient metals" that increase as the distance increases
 in saakshyon se pataa chalata he ki donon akashganga samaan vikasvaadi path kaa anusaran karti hai
 They have assimilated or incorporated 1-200 low-mass galaxies during the last 12 billion years
 M31 ke vistaarit prabhamandal main taron or akashganga main do akashgangaon ko alag karne vaali lagbhag ek tihaai duuri main vruddhi sambhav he
 M31 is known as a dense and small star cluster at its center
 ek badi doorabeen main adhik vistaarit vruddhi main sannhit taare ke drishyman prabhaav ko banaata he
 The brightness of the nucleus is more of a brightly spherical swarm
 1991 main, tod aar lair ne WFPC kaa upyog kiya he or use baad main hoobal antariksh telescope ko andromenda ke bhitari cendrak kii chhaviyaan lene ke liye sthapit kiya gaya
 The nucleus has two valencies separated by 1
5 parsecs
 chamakili sanyojaktaa ko P1 main dizine kiya gaya he, vah akashganga centre ke samakaksh he
 The misty valency of P2 is located in the center of the galaxy and a 3–5x107m☉ black hole
 scot tramene ne suzav diya ki dekhe gaye dabl cendrak kii vyakhya sambhav he ki yadi P1 kendriya blike hole main taron ke aas-paas utkendrak kaksh main taron ke bimb kaa prakshepan hota he
 Its eccentricity is such that the stars are attached to the orbital aposcenter, which increases the orientation of the stars
 P2 main garm varnakrameey varg a taron kii saghan chakrika he
 a star redness filter is unclear but in blue and ultraviolet light they affect the nucleus due to which P2 appears to be more effective than P1
 jabaki, isaki aarambhik khoj ke samay, yah pariklpana kii gai thi ki dabl cendrak kaa chamkila bhaag andromenda ke paas choti akashganga "kenibeliced" kaa shesh bhaag tha, jiske baad uski koi spasht vyakhya nahin kii gai
 The basic reason for this is that this type of nucleus has a very short lifetime due to the fluctuating disruption of the central black hole
 jabaki iskaa aanshik rup se samdhaan sambhav he yadi P1 ke paas uskaa apana sthir karne vaala blike hole ho P1 main uthal-puthal kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uske centre main blike hole he
 In particular, no X-rays of the galaxy were taken until the end of 1968
 20 oktober 1970 ko, M31 se pataa lagaae jane yogya mushkil eks-re kii upari seemaa nirdhaarit kii gai
 After that, a number of X-ray sources have been detected in the Andromeda galaxy using orbits from esa's XMM – Newton orbital observatory

 The reflection of neutron stars is similar to that of a hypothetical black hole but can be distinguished by their bodies
 andromeda akashganga se lagbhag 460 golakaar punj sambandhit he
 Among these masses, Mayol II was identified as the largest giant, nicknamed the globular one, with a more massive cluster than any other common cluster of galaxies
 isamen kai million taare hai or isaki chamak omega senturi ke tulana main doguni he jo akashganga main sabase chamkile golakaar punj ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Globular 1 has many stellar numbers and is too dense for the normal spheroid
 jiske parinamswaroop, kuch log G1 ko choti akashganga kaa chota bhaag maanate hai jise kuch samay pehle M31 mana gaya tha
 The most pronounced glare of the globular is similar to that of the G76, which is located in the southeastern part of its eastern part
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne M31 main tara punj ke ek puri tarah se bhinn prakaar kii khoj kii
 The discovered New Star Punja consisted of millions of stars and in these same circular stars a similar number of other stars can be discovered
 unhen vartulakaar samoohon se bhinn kya karata he jisase ki ve adhik - kai sau prakaash varsh bade hai - or unase kai guna kam ghaney hai
 Therefore, the distance between the wires is much higher in the recently discovered extended masses
 akashganga ke samaan, andromeda akashganga main upgrah akashganga hai jinaki sankhya 14 choti akashganga he
 The best known and most visited satellite galaxies are M32 and M110
 vartmaan sakshya ke aadhaar par, aisa lagata he ki M32 kaa M31 ke saath bada hi nazadiiki saamana hua
 The M32 would have been a much larger galaxy ever since, after which the M31 removed its stellar image, and the formation of a star in its core grew rapidly, ending after that
 M110 bhi M31 ke sampark main aayaa hoga or khagolavidon ne M31 ke prabhamandal main dhaatu se bharpoor taron ke kii khoj kii jo in upgrah akashgangaon se rekha ke rup main dikhain detii hai
 There is no dust of the M110 which points towards recent and current star design
 2006 main, yah khoj kii gai ki inamen se nau akashganga samanaantar hai jo andameda akashganga ke antarbhag vibhajit karti hai bajaae iske ki unke swatantra sampark ko betarativ rup main vyavasthit kiya jaae
 yah upgrahon ke liye saamaanya jwariya udgam kii taraf sanket de saktaa he
 The Andromeda galaxy is moving rapidly towards the galaxy from 100 to 140 kilometres per second, so it is one of the shifting blue galaxies
 andromeda akashganga or akashganga aapas main shaayad 450 karod varshon ke baad aapas main takaraane kii ummid he, haalanki iskaa vivaran anishchit he kyonki andromeda kaa praasangik veg kii tulana akashganga se keval ek yaa do ghatak ke aadhaar par hi kii ja sakati he
 As a result of this collision, these galaxies will transform into a giant elliptical galaxy
 Such phenomena are common among galaxies in a galaxy cluster
 prithvi or saura mandal ke bich takkar kii abhi tak koi jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 If the galaxies do not merge themselves, the solar system may be excluded from the galaxy or connect to Andromeda

 In the 2009 general election, Thirumavalavan was elected to parliament from Chidambaram Lok Sabha constituency
 thirumavalwan kii raajnneeti tamil rashtrawaad ko punarparibhaashit karne par aadhaarit he, jo ise jati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke liye ek bal ke rup main parivartit karnaa chaahati he
 The oppression of Dalits, he says, is institutionalized in India, including in Tamil Nadu
 haalanki dravid partiyaan jo tamilnadu kii raajnneeti par haaavee hai, ve jaati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke liye vaicharik rup se patibaddh hai, thirumavalwan kaa tark he ki ve log vyavhaar main dravid andolan ke mul aadarshon se dur ho gaye hai
 They say that their policies have mainly benefited the middle castes and actually increased the oppression of Dalits where the Brahmins have been replaced by the middle castes in a tyrannical form

 a Commissionerate Apostolic is a cancerous, appointed by the Pope, hence the preferential Apostolic

 Sometimes the Apostolic Commissions are formed permanently by the Holy See
 The various Roman churches headed by the Cardinal are as follows cmanderij ke adhikaar kii purna seemaa apostolic ko unki niyukti ke diploma se siikhnaa chahie
 However, the general authorities who hold them are defined in the Church's common law
 aayogon ko na keval nyaayik ke liye balki kaaryakari uddeshyon ke liye bhi shashakt kiya ja saktaa he jab ek pope kamishan spasht rup se kuch vyaktiyon or kuch chizon kaa ullekh cmandari ke adhikaar ke adheen karata he, or phir saamaanya taur par kaha jaataa he ki "anya vyaktiyon or anya chijen" bhi shaamil hai, yah samajha jaataa he ki uttararddh vaakyansh keval un vyaktiyon or chizon ko sanderbhit karata he jo spasht rup se namit kiye gaye logon kii tulana main samaan yaa nimna mahatv ke hote hai, or koi bhi paristhiti main kamisari kii shakti ucch yaa adhik sammanit nahin he agar ek bishap ko apane saamaanya adhikaar kshetra se sambandhit maamalon main alpsankhyak apostolic niyukt kiya jaataa he, to vah aisa adhikaar nahin detaa jiske adhikaar main vah pehle se hi paas tha; aisa ek apostolic ayog ko 'uttejit' kaha jaataa he, use badalanaa nahin, uskaa saadhaaran adhikaar kshetra
 As a commissioner apostolic is a representative of the Holy See, the Pope can be appealed against his decisions or administrative acts
 jab ek hi maamla ke liye kai kamishnar niyukt kiye gaye hai, to ve ek ke rup main ek saath kaary karnaa he; lekin agar mrityu yaa kisi anya kaaran se, ek yaa anya commissaries ke abhinay se baadhit hona chahie, shesh sadasyon ko apane ayog ko nishpadit karne kii purna shakti he
 If the commission number is two in number and disagrees with the decision to be given to them, then this decision should be taken by the Holy See
 ek alpsankhyak apostolic ko uske liye patibaddh kaaran ke liye kisi anya vyakti ko kam karne kii shakti he, jab tak ki use apane diploma main spasht rup se na kaha gaya he ki, is mudde ke maamle ke mahatv ke kaaran, vah apane adhikaar kshetra main vyaktigat taur par vyaayaam karnaa he
 By the fullness of their power, the pope can constitute a layman apostolic for matters of civilization, but according to common principle law, only clerics of pre-ex or higher orders should receive such a commission
 council of trent prayek bishap ko pavitra ko sanchaarit karne ke liye chaar vyaktiyon ke naam dekhen jo unke bishap ke liye is tarah ke pratinidhimandal ko praapt karne main sakasham hai
