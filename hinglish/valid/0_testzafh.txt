 But some part of it was organized or written in Buddha's lifetime, it is difficult to say
 yadhyapi tripitak main hi kuch aise ullekh milte hai jinase buddha ke jeevankaal main hi dharm ke kuch prakarnon ke vyavasthit paath kiye jane kaa pataa chalata he
 For example, there is a description in Udaan that once God himself asked a monk named Sina, how did you understand religion? In response, the monk heard 16 octaves in full voice
 isaki bhagwaan ne prashansa bhi kii
 Vinayapitaka etc
 texts use adjectives such as Bahushruta, Dharmadhar, Vinayadhar, Matrikadhar and Panchannayik, Bhanak, Sutantik, which clearly shows that the tradition of Parana, holding of the teachings of the Buddha, had been in existence since his lifetime
 is parampara ke aadhaar par buddha ke upadeshon ko suvyavasthit saahitiyik rup dene ke liye teen baar sangeetiyaan kii jane ke ullekh chullavagg, dipavansh, mahavansh aadi granthon main milte hai
 The first association took place in the Rajgriha only four months after Buddha-nirvana in which 500 monks participated, due to which he is also famous as Panchashatika
 isaki adhyakshata mahakashyap ne kii or unhone buddha ke saakshaat shishy bhikshu upali se vinay sambandhi tathaa sthavir anand se sutt sambandhi prashn puch-poochkar anya bhikshuon ke anumodan se ukt vishyon kaa sangrah kiya
 The second such type of music took place in Vaishali 100 years after Buddha Nirvana, in which 700 monks joined and that is why she became known as Saptashtika
 isamen vaishali ke bhikshuon ke aacharan main anek dosha dikhaakar unhen vinay ke viruddh tehraaya gaya or anumaanath: vinayapitak main vishesh vyavastha laai gai

 The theme of the theme is Sutpitaka, in which a simple, interesting narrative style is adopted to make the teachings of God heartening to the audience

 The aim is to make new things adaptable to the general audience and that is why the main part of the sermon has been repeated again and again
 prasangvash in sutton main tatkaaleen dharmik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa chithran bhi aa gaya he jo pracheen itihaas kii drushti se bada mahatvapurn he
 For example, the Buddhist contemporaries of the contemporary religions like Mankhaligosal, Pakudhikayan, Ajit Kes Kambali, Sanjay Balattiputt Niganthanatattu, etc
 and Buddhism of the religious sects promoted by them are found in Buddhist view in the Samphal Sutt, Brahmjala Sutta and Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Dighi Nikaya
 And at the same time, the rendering of Buddhist beliefs on those subjects is also found
 saamaajik chithran suttapitak main bikharaa padaa he, tathaapi khuddak nikaay ke antargat jaatakon main isaki prachur saamagree uplabdh he
 In the Sutas, the kings of the 16 districts of Magadha, Videha, Kosala, Kashi, etc
 of Buddha period are filled with mention of their interrelations and fighting and fights
 sutton ke upadeshon main jis buddha aachaar ke sanket paae jate hai, unheen kii bhikshuon ke yogya sadachaar ke niyamon ke rup main vidhi-nishedh-pranali se vyavastha vinay pitak main bhi kii gai he
 Likewise, the seeds of metaphysics embedded in sutas have been theoretically rendered in philosophical terms and interpreted in Abhidhamma Pitaka
 is paraspar aanushanbikta ke kaaran bauddhadharm kaa puraa sangopang evam suvyavasthit parigyaan bina tripitak ke avlokan ke nahin ho saktaa
 This Pali is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha himself from the point of view of Tripitaka
 uplabdh granth rachana kii drushti se i
 purv tritiy shatabdi se pashchaat kaa siddh nahin hota
 According to the Buddhist tradition, during the time of Ashoka emperor, his son Mahendra himself became a Buddhist monk and took this literature to Lanka and there he got the written form during the reign of King Battagamani in the first century AD which we find today
 tathaapi usamen aisi koi baat hamen nahin milti jo bich kii do teen shatabdiyon ke kaal main lanka kii paristhitiyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran usamen ai kahin ja sake
 The subject of the Vinayapitaka, according to his name, is to present the rules of virtuous morality of monks
 iske teen avaantar vibhaag hai - suttavibhang, khandhak or parivaar
 Suttavibhang again has two subdivisions - Mahavagga and Chullavagga
 is prakaar apane in upavibhaagon kii apeksha vinayapitak paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Sutapitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka in terms of its subject, detail and composition
 isamen aise sutton kaa sangrah kiya gaya he jo paramparanusaar yaa to swayan bhagwaan buddha ke kahe hue hai yaa unke saakshaat shishy dwaara updisht hai or jinka anumodan swayan bhagwaan buddha ne kiya he
 The Sanskrit formulation of Sutta is done
 kintu prastut sutton main sutara ke ve lakshan drushtigochar nahin hote jo sanskrit kii pracheen sutararachanaon, jaise vaidic sahitya ke shrout sutara, gruhm evam dharmasutra aadi main paae jate hai
 The special feature of the sutra is to convey more and more meanings in shortest words
 usamen punarukti kaa sarvatha abhaav avidhyman he
 But here, in contrast to the brief style, the style of elaborate lectures and repeated repetitions of key points has been adopted
 is kaaran sutt kaa sutara roopaantar uchit prathit nahin hota
 By considering, it is inferred that the meaning of the Sutta is originally from Sukta
 vedon ke ek ek prakaran ko bhi sookt hi kaha gaya he
 It is perfectly appropriate to call the rendering of one thing as Sukta
 suttapitak ke paanch bhaag hai jinhen nikaay kaha gaya hai - dighanikaay, majjhimanikaay, sanyuktanikaay, anguttaranikaay or khuddakanikaay
 The longevity is divided into three classes
 pratham silkkhandhavagg main 13 sutt hai, duusare mahavagg main 10 tathaa tisare patikavagg main 11
 Thus there are 34 suttas in longevity
 ye sutt anya nikaayon main sangruhit sutton kii apeksha vistaar main adhik lambey he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 Majjhimnikaya has 152 spans of moderate expansion divided into 15 sections - inamen se 14wein varg vibhang main 12 sutt hai or shesh sab main das-das
 There is a collection of all types of sutas in the Samyutanikayaya and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 isamen kul 56 sutt yaa sanyutt hai jo in paanch virgon main vibhajit hai - Anganwasa body has its own specialty
 isamen sutton kaa sangrah ek vyavastha ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 In the beginning there are such Sutras in which Buddha is a collection of precepts related to a numerical substance of God, followed by Sutras concerning two substances and then three, four etc
 isi kram se is nikaay ke bheetar ekakanipat, dukanipat evam tik, chatuvak, panchak, chakk, sattak, atthak, navak, dasak or ekadask in naamon ke gyaarah nipaton kaa sankalan he
 These drops are divided into reclasses, which are numbered 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 and 3
 is prakaar 11 nipaton main kul virgon kii sankhya 169 he
 There are many sutas within each class whose number is at least 7 and maximum 262 in one class
 is prakaar angutar nikaay se sutton kii sankhya 2308 he
 The Kundak body consists of 15 compositions, completely independent in terms of subject and composition, whose names are - pali tripitak ke tisare bhaag abhidhammpitak main bhagwaan buddha ke darshanatmak vichaaron kaa vishleshan or vargeekaran kiya gaya he tathaa tathvik drushti se unki suchiyaan or paribhaashaayen upasthit kii gai hai
 This Pitaka consists of the following seven texts - dhammsangani uski matika ke anusaar do bhaagon main vibhakt he
 The first part has 22 topics, in each of which three subjects are discussed
 duusare vibhaag main 100 duk hai or prayek duk main vidhaan ore nishedh rup se do do vishyon kaa prarupan kiya gaya he
 These shops are divided into 12 classes, namely - is prakaar dhammsangani ke tikon or dukon kii sankhya 122 he
 The first of these is the skilled, unskilled and uneducated theologian, which is the most important and its theme has been depicted in Chittupapad form Nyakshap and Atthadhar in these four scandals
 vibhang kii vishaywastu 18 vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are 216 q & A's within 23 chapters in Kathavatthu which contradict the doctrines of the opposing sects
 puggalpannati main 10 adhyay hai jinamein kramash: ek ek prakaar ke, do do prakaar ke aadi badhate kram main dasven adhyay main 10, 10 prakaar ke pudgalon arthath vyaktiyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 Individuals have been divided by separation, Samyak Sambuddha, each Buddha, Shayakshi, Ashakshiya, Arya, Anarya etc
 dhatukatha kii rachana kaa muladhar vibhang he, kyonki usee ke pratham teen arthath skandh, aaytan or dhaatu vibhangon kaa hi yahan adhik sookshm vivechan kiya gaya he
 For this reason, the second name of this book is also found in khamb-ayatan-dhatukatha
 granth main inhen teen kaa sambandh dharmon ke saath baitaakar bataaya gaya he
 According to Matik, these religions number 125 which are as follows - inkaa paraspar sambadh prashnottar kii style se 14 adhyyon main kiya gaya he
 Relation of religions in Yamak is explained in a contradictory style with particular subjects, and because of this couple's questionable manner, the Yamak name of this composition is meaningful
 jaise kya sabhi kushaldharm kushalmul hai? kya sabhi kushalmul kushaldharm hai? ityadi
 By this method, an attempt has been made to give a definite explanation of the terminology used in Abhidhammapitaka in Yamak
 yah rachana in 10 yamakon main vibhakt he - The basic ideology of Buddhist metaphysics has been discussed in great detail in a special style in the Puttana
 granth ke mukhya chaar bhaag hai - The relation of the 22 stanzas and the 24 suffixes of the 100 dukas referred to in Dhammasarini in these four parts is explained by the following six pieces: tik pak duk pak shop pik-dik pak-pik-dik pak and shops P
 in chah patthanon kaa purvawat chaar vibhaagon main prarupan hone se sampurna granth 24 patthanon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The compilation of the above mentioned Tripitaka literature is often done in BC
 The third century was completed, but the creation of Pali literature continued even after that
 yadhyapi yah anupali sahitya vishay kii drushti se praaia: purnat: tripitak ke antargat gyaan kaa hi anukaran karata he, tathaapi apan swaroop evam style main samay kii gati ke anusaar usamen vikaas dikhaai detaa he
 BC Around the first century, a book called Nettpikaran was written in which the subject of Abhidhammapitaka has been discussed with some more precision
 isamen 16 haar, 5 nay or 18 mul padon ke dwaara buddha darshan kii paribhaashaon ko samajhane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 The name of its doer is Kachchan
 isi prakaar kii ek duusari rachana isi kaal ke lagbhag kii petkopadesh he jisamen nettiprakaran kii hi vishaywastu ko kuch duusari reeti se upasthit kiya gaya he, jisamen pradhanta un chaar arya satyon kii he jo buddha ke upadeshon ke muladhar hai
 Often, the third composition of this period is milind-panho, which has its specialty in Pali literature and is also very important from historical point of view
 isamen sakal ke naresh milind or bhikshu nagsen se bich hua vaartalap varnit he
 Milind is considered to be a variation of the name of that Yavan Naresh Minadar, who b
c
 In the middle of the second century, India invaded and established its kingdom in the state of Punjab
 prastut granth ke anusaar yah raja bada vidvan or darshanik vishyon main ruchi rakhanevaala tha
 He posed many philosophical questions to the monk Nagasena, to which Nagsen has cleverly answered by affirming his beautiful illustrations
 granth main saat adhyay hai - Of these, the first three chapters are considered to be the original parts of the book
 shesh chaar adhyay peeche jode gaye prathit hote hai
 There are several reasons for this - one is the information about the restart of the book in the third chapter; Secondly, the incarnation of Buddhaghosha is usually taken from only three chapters and thirdly the Chinese translation of this book was done around 400 AD, only these three chapters are found in it
 yah rachana style main badi rochak tathaa buddha siddhant ke gyaan ke liye apane dhang kii adwitiya he
 After these compositions, the era of storytelling begins
 shrut paramparanusaar jab mahendra or sanghmitra dwaara pali tripitak lanka main pahunchaa or bauddhadharm kaa prachar badha, un mul granthon par sinhalai bhashaa main tikaa rup atthakathaayen likhi gai
 These fables are no longer available
 anumaanath: iskaa kaaran un atthakathaon kii rachana ho jane se kramash: un mul atthakathaon kaa adhyayan adhyaapan chhot janaa hi he
 The name of Acharya Buddhaghosha, the author of these new Pali chronicles, is very famous in Pali literature
 unhone jin sinhalai atthakathaon kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa jinke avataran apni atthakathaon main liye hai, unamem mukhya hai- The last four chronicles appear as special lectures on bodies or any of their subjects
 in mul atthakathaon ke abhaav main yah kahana to kathin he ki kitne ansh main buddhaghosh ne unka anukaran kiya or kitna moulik rup se kiya, tathaapi unki rachanaaon ko dekhne se spasht prathit hota he ki unhone mul atthakathaon ko apane tripitak ke vishaal gyaan dwaara bahut hi pallavit kiya hoga
 His chronicles are found on most parts of Vinayapitaka, Sutpitaka and Abhidhammapitaka, numbering 16
 in atthakathaon ke atirikt buddhaghosh kii ek vishisht rachana he visuddhimagg, jise buddha darshan kaa gyaanakosh kaha ja saktaa he
 According to Buddhaghosa himself in the eight stories, he has filled the essence of these four bodies in Visuddhimagga, Digha, Majjhim, Samyutta and Angusad
 shrut paramparanusaar unhone visuddhimagg ko apni atthakathaon se purv unki rachana ko apni yogyata siddh karne ke liye hi likhaa tha
 There are a total of 23 passages in this book
 pratham do parichchhedon kaa vishay he "samadhi" or shesh parichchhedon main "pragna" kaa vyaakhyaan kiya gaya he
 After Buddhaghosha, the tradition of storytelling was reaffirmed by his two contemporary scholars, Buddhadutt and Dhammapala
 buddhadutt ne buddhaghosh krit samantapasadika naamak vinayapitak kii atthkatha kaa saar apni uttaravinishchay or vinayavinishchay naamak do padyatmak rachanaaon main upasthit kiya tathaa buddhaghosh kii abhidhamm kii atthakathaon ke aadhaar par abhidhammavatar naamak gadhy-padya-mishrit granth kii rachana kii
 The originality in this is that where Buddhaghosha has discussed religions through the five wings of Rupa, Vedanadi, Buddhadatta has adopted this four types of classification as Chittar, Chetasik, Rupa and Nirvana
 isi vargeekaran ko unhone apni rooparoop vibhaag naamak rachana main rakhaa he
 Another creation of Buddhadutt is Madhurutha Vilasini, a story of Buddhavans
 dhammpal ne saat atthakathaayen likhi he
 Buddhaghosha did not write anecdotes on the texts named Uddan, Itishutakat, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Theragatha, Therigatha and Chariapitaka under Khuddakanikaya, on which Dhammapala has written a story called Paramatthadipani
 isi prakaar nettiprakaran par atthasanvaneena or usee par linatthavannana naamak tikaa, visuddhimagg par paramatthamanjusha, buddhaghosh kii chaar nikaayon kii atthakathaon par leenatthapakasini naamak tikaa, jatakatthakatha kii tikaa tathaa buddhadutt krit madhuratthvilasini kii tikaa likhi
 The most famous of these works is his commentary
 shesh rachanaaon main koi vaishishty nahin he
 Although the above is not after the creation of Tripitaka and his stories
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat buddhavachan ke sambandh main adhik kuch kahana shesh nahin rahaa, tathaapi is atthkatha naamak tikaa sahitya kii rachana buddhaghosh yug main baraabar hoti rahi
 Some of these compositions are as follows: anandakrit abhidhamm mul tikaa, chulldhammpal krit 'sachch sankshep', upsen krit saddhammppajotik mahanam krit sadshammppakasini, kassap krit mahvichedni or vimatichhedni, vajrabuddhi krit sammtavpasadika kii tikaa, kshem krit khemppkaran, aniruddh krit abhidhammaththsangaho paramatthavinishchay or namrupapariched, dharmashri krit khuddakasikkha or mahaswami krit mulsikkha
 From 12th century onwards, the creation of commentaries started in Magadhi language itself
 is kaary kii suvyavastha ke liye lanka naresh parakrambahu pratham ke kaal main sinhalai sthavir mahakssap dwaara ek sangeeti kii gai, jiske falswaroop samantapasadika aadi atthakathaon par deepani, manjusa, pakasini aadi naamon se aath tikaayen likhi gayi, jinamein se ab keval vinayapitak kii samantapasadika atthkatha par likhi gai saratthdipani tikaa maatr milti he
 Three other commentaries of its subject Sariputta are also found
 sumangala, saddhammajotipal, dhammakirti, buddharavikhat or meghankar - in sabhi ne bhinn-bhinn atthakathaon par tikaayen likhi he
 In these, ten commentary texts like the original Sikha Tika of Wachissar Ther alone are found
 13veen shatee main sthavir videh, buddhapriy or dharmakirti dwaara samantakutavannana aadi anek granthon kii rachana hui
 Four poetic texts are famous among the works of the 14th century - baad kii teen rachanaaon ke kartaaon ke naam agyaat hai
 After the 14th century, the field of Pali-literature-creation rose from Lanka and reached Brahmadesh
 yahan ke sahityakaron ne abhidhamm ko vishesh rup se adhyayan kaa vishay banaaya
 Some compositions of the 15th century are 16veen shatee main saddhammalankar ne patthan prakaran par patthandipani naamak tikaa likhi tathaa mahanam se anandakrit abhidhamm-mul-tikaa par madhusaaraty dipani naamak anutika likhi
 In the 17th century, Tripitakalankar composed the three texts on the eightyasalini, Visastivanna, the commentary on the Sariputitika Vinayasagraha called Vinayalankara and Yasavaddhanavatthu
 trilokguru ne chaar granth rache- The other two compositions of this Shati are the Dhatukthayajana by Saradassi and Abhidhammatthaganthipada by Mahakasap
 18veen shatee kii gnanamivanshnamak brahmdes ke sangharaaj kii teen rachanaayen prasiddh hai- Some of the creations of the 19th century Brahmadesh- Nalatdhatu Vans, Sandes Katha Boundedism, decision etc
 is shatee ke chhakesadhatuvans, gandhavans or sasanavans naamak rachanaaon kaa parichay vans sahitya ke antargat diya gaya he
 Other notable works of this century are the monk Ledisdav's Abhidhammamsarah's Paratthadipani Tika and the Pali essay on Yamak which he wrote to address some of Mrs Raise Davids's doubts
 pali-sahitya-rachana kii avichhinn dhara ke pramanswaroop 20veen shatee kii do rachanaaon kaa ullekh karnaa anuchit na hoga
 These are Visuddhimagdipika composed by Bhandat Dharmanand Kosambi and Navneet Tika of Abhidhammatthasangra in India
 is parichay ke aadhaar se kaha ja saktaa he ki paalisahitya-nirmaan kii dhara dhai hajaar varsh ke pashchaat bhi abhi tak vicchhinn nahin hui
 At the time when Tripitaka was being composed in Sri Lanka, historical interest in some of the writers was aroused at the same time, resulting in the creation of Deepavansha
 in granthon main lanka kaa itihaas, pracheenatam kaal se lekar raja mahasen ke rajyakaal tak, varnan kiya gaya he
 This work has been used by Buddhaghosha abundantly in his books and has also given its revision in some places
 is prakaar dipawans kaa rachanakaal i
 chauthi paanchavin shatee ke bich siddh hota he
 Along with the kings of Sinhala, the details of the life of Buddha, the tradition of his disciples and all the three musicians etc
 have been exaggerated
 anumaanath: iske vishay kaa aadhaar uparyukt sinhalai atthakathaayen rahi hai
 This composition is poly-prose-mixed, the style is very relaxed, the repetitions are also many and the composition is not free from defects of language, verses etc
 ye lakshan uski pracheenta ke dyotak hai or is baat ke pramaan hai ki usamen vishaywastu anek sroton se sankalit kii gai he tathaa usamen sampadakeey vyavastha laane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya gaya
 But historically in Lanka, it has a great respect from the beginning
 kaha jaataa he ki i
 5veen shatee main hi sinhal raja dhatusen ne ek varshikotsav ke avasar par rashtriya gaurav ke saath iskaa paath karaayaa
 Deepavans is naturally the oldest work in Indian historical works
 dipavansh kii rachana se kuch kaal pashchaat mahanam ke dwaara mahavansh kii rachana hui
 Its base is also the Sinhala story and the deep dynasty
 yahan vishay kaa pratipaadan dipavansh kii apeksha adhik vishad or vyavasthit he
 Language is also more refined and the style reminds us of the method of epics somewhere
 mahavansh kaa mul bhaag 37 parichchhedon kaa he or vah dipavansh ke samaan mahasen ke shasankaal par samaapt hota he
 The earliest passages, which mention the religious conditions of the country before the arrival of Buddhism in Lanka, are historically significant
 udaahranarth, pandaskamay naresh kaa rajyakaal mahendra dwaara lanka main bauddhadharm ke pravesh se 60 varsh purv tak rahaa kaha gaya he
 This king ruled for 70 years and established the city of Anuradhapura only in the 10th year of the state
 isse aage is rachana main samay-samay par parivardhan kiya gaya he
 From the 50th saga of the 37th passage to the 79th passage, the composition is Sthir Dharmakirti and gives the lineage of 78 kings from the time of Mahasena to Parakramabahu I
 mahavansh kaa yah tathaa isse aage ke pariched chulvansh kehalaata he
 The Buddhist monk, the author of 11 passages from Chulvansh 80 to 90, described the next 23 kings who came to Parakramabahu IV
 91 se 100 tak ke 10 pariched sumangala ther dwaara rache gaye or unamem bhuvnekbahu tritiy se lekar kirtishree rajsingh ke kaal tak ke 24 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya
 The propagation of Christianity in Lanka is also reported here
 aglaa 101vaan pariched sumangalacharya tathaa devarakshit dwaara rachaa gaya
 Thereafter, there is also information about the state going into the hands of the British
 mahavansh kaa antim parivadharn bhikshu pragyanand nayak dwaara 1936 main prakashit hua or isamen 1815 se 1935 i
 tak kaa lanka kaa itihaas samavisht kiya gaya he
 Thus the composition of the Mahavansha has the hand of six authors by whom the history of Lanka from Lord Buddha to about two and a half thousand years has been inscribed unceasingly
 yah granth is baat kaa bhi pratik he ki ukt deergh kaal tak lanka main pali bhashaa ko kis prakaar jivit rakhaa gaya or usamen saahitiyik rachana kii dhara ko kabhi sookhne nahin diya gaya
 Deep Vansh and Mahavansha creations awakened intense historical instincts
 parinamat: anek anya vansh naamak granth rache gaye
 Historical facts are often taken from both the above mentioned texts, but the tradition of the various themes which have been collected in them is important
 inamen vishay ko mahatv dene ke liye bahut kuch atishyoktiyon or kalpanaaon kaa bhi aashray liya gaya he, jiske kaaran kahin kahin itihasajna ko udvaig yaa ashraddha utpann hone lagati he
 The main compositions of this type are - ukt granthon main adhikansh bhaag pracheen tripitak, unki atthakathaon tathaa mahavansh ke antargat vaarta kii sakshep yaa vistaar se punrariti maatr he
 But still they have some originality of their own subject, on the basis of which we get some history of the above mentioned subjects from the Buddha period till now
 yah pali sahitya kii apni visheshta he jo sanskrit praakrit main nahin pai jaati
 Classical texts have also been composed in Pali from time to time
 vyakaran ke kshetra main kacchan or moggallan krit, vyakaran evam unki tikaayen prasiddh hai
 In 1154 AD, there is a grammar of Pali language based on the grammar of Kachchan, Saddaniti, monk of Brahmadesh
 iske teen bhaag hai- padmala, dhatumala or suttamala
 Based on this, there is a rhymed metallist called Dhatvarthadeepani, a Jinratna monk pali vyakaran vishyak anya kuch rachanaayen hai- saddhammaguru krit saddabutti, mangalakrut gandhatthee or samner dhammadassi krit vachhvachak, arievansh krit gandhabharan, brahmadesh ke narsh kychha kii putree krit vibhaktyarthprakaran, jambudhvaj krit sanvaneenanay-dipana or niruttisangah, raajaguru krit karkpupfamanjari 
 The "abhidhanappadipika" and "ekkkara Kosh" of the Pali are well-known books
 pali chand:shaastra par bhi anek rachanaayen hai, jaise vrittoday, chandovichiti or kavibharprakaran aadi
 Among them, the most famous is the Thar Sangharvikrita
 isapar vachanatvajotika naamak tikaa bhi likhi gai
 The only work on these poetic poems is the same composition - Subodhalankar

 sidhe va unche margon par parvatarohan va skiing kii kalaon kaa ek saath prayog kar chadhaai karnaa or utarana ek prakaar kaa khel he jise ski parvatarohan kehete hai
 To climb the ice slope safely, it is necessary to use the ice ax and various handling techniques developed in the last century for ascending
 sabase kam dhalaan se sabase sidhi chadhaai ke dauraan sabase pehle pair ko oonchai kii disha main uthaaya jaataa he, phir thokar maari jaati he or phir crempon ko aage kiya jaataa he
 In the ice ax mode, he is used first as a hand wrench, then as a peg, then his front part is used as a knife from below and above the shoulder and finally he is used as a knife
 The top is rotated and thrown in the direction of the slope
 ye vibhinn takneekein is baat par nirbhar karti hai ki barf kii kulhadi kaa dizin kaisaa he, tathaa parvatarohi ek kulhadi kaa istemaal kar rahaa he ki do kaa
 barf main rassiyon ke liye lungar ke rup main istemaal kii jane vaali vastuen kabhi-kabhaar avishwasaneey hoti hai; unamem barf kii khunti, aluminium se bane deadman upkaran shaamil hote hai; yaa unhen dabi hui chizon jaise barf kii kulhadi, ski, chattaane evam anya vastuon se bhi banaaya jaataa he
 from hard ice , called bollards
 himand par chalate samay barf kii khaiyaan sabase adhik khatarnaak hoti hai
 These huge cracks in ice are often not seen because a thin layer of ice forms a snowbridge on them
 kai baar yah snobrij keval kuch inch hi mote hote hai
 Climbers use a system of ropes to protect themselves from such dangers
 himand yatra ke liye buniyadi rup main barf kii kulhadi tathaa crempon aavashyak hai
 Teams of two to five climbers are tied equally spaced in a rope
 agar ek parvatarohi girane lagata he to anya sabhi apane sthaan par sthir ho jate hai or sabaki shakti use girane se roak leti he
 Other team members take out the fallen partner from the crack
 jami barf par surakshit yatra ke liye kai vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 If the climb is tough
 parantu utani sidhi nahin, to arohi barf kii keel gaad kar unamem rassi laga kar apni suraksha karata he
 Each ascending climbs using the same nail anchors and takes out the last ascending anchor
 kabhi kabhi bollard yaa himalambon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is very useful in that case when all the teams start falling together
 This technique is known as simul-climbing and is sometimes used on steep ice and easy rock
 yadi chadhaai atyant kathin or khadi ho to maanak takanic hi upyukt rahati he
 In this, everyone climbs one by one and after reaching one place, he waits for the follower
 sabhi ke ek jagah ekatrit hone ke baad hi kafila aage badhata he
 Climbers use different shelters depending on the circumstances
 pahaado main mausam bahut apratyaashit ho saktaa he isliye aashray parvatarohi ke liye suraksha kaa bahut mahatvapurn pahalu he
 High mountains may require camping for several days
 "aadhaar shivi" kaa istemaal shikhar par jane ke prayaas ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Base camps are built in places protected from the difficult conditions above
 kai lokapriy yaa khatarnaak pahaado par aadhaar shivi sthit hai
 Where the summit cannot be reached in a single day, more than one base camp is made
 udhaaharan ke liye, everest ke dakshin-purv rij vaale raste main aadhaar shivi ke alawa 4 anya shivi bhi maujuud hai
 There is a network of mountain huts, especially in the European Alpine regions
 france main inhen refuges, italy main rifugi, switzraland main kabanes, germany or austria main hatin, slovenia main coca, spain main refugios, tathaa norge main hitt ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Such huts are present at many different elevations, including high mountains, although more remote shelters exist in more remote areas
 parvatiy jhopadiyaan vibhinn aakaar or kismon kii hoti hai, lekin prayek main aam taur par ek saamaajik bhojan kaksh hota he or unamem gadde, kambal yaa duwaits tathaa takie se las sone kii suvidhaayen hoti hai
 Guests are expected to bring their own beds
 The facilities are usually basic, but in such a difficult environment they provide the most important shelter
 iske atirikt ve margon ko adhik vyapak rup se sulabh banane kaa kaam bhi karti hai kyonki arohi yahan ruk kar yatra main vishram kar pate hai tathaa baari upkaran uthaane se bhi unhen chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he
 Hence, they are considered to be an invaluable place in mountaineering
 europe main sabhi jhopadiyon main garmi ke mausam ke dauraan karmchaaree upasthit rahete hai or kuch main vasant ritu main bhi
 anya sthanon par yah patjhad main bhi jhopadiyaan khuli mil jaati hai
 In some huts a part is always open
 yah maanav rahit hoti hai or inhen winter hat kehete hai
 These huts are run by paid employees when they are open, although some of them are also run by voluntary employees who are members of Alpine clubs such as the Swiss Alpine Club and the Club Alpine Française
 The managers of the hut, called guardians or wardens in Europe, also usually serve refreshments and food
 yah suvidha raat bhar rukne waalon tathaa keval din main rahane vaale, donon ke liye uplabdh hoti he
 Given that most of the items, including water, are often brought by helicopter, the food is quite elaborate
 isamen glucose yukt aahaar, vahin banaayi gayi kek tathaa pastery, bear or sharaab sahit garm or thande peya or raatri bhoj ke liye ucch carbohydrate yukt aahaar sammilit hai
 Not all huts however provide this facility, and some have to make their own arrangements
 udhar kuch jhopadiyaan donon prakaar kii suvidhaayen pradaan karatin hai
 Visitors can use their food items and cooking equipment to keep expenses down, or cooked food is also available for those who spend more
 raat bhar ke liye aarakshan anivaary samajha jaataa he, tathaa kuch lokapriy sthanon par to yah aavashyak bhi hota he kyonki achche mausam yaa saptahanth par 100 bistar vaali suvidhaayen bhi bhar jaati hai! ek baar kiye gaye aarakshan ko radd karwaanaa shisht mana jaataa he, kyonki in jhopadiyon ke karmchaaree bade parishram se har arohi ke raste evam chadhaai ke plan kaa ricard rakhte hai taaki arohi kii suraksha sunishchit kii ja sake
 sab jhopadiyon main telephone dwaara sampark kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sabamein bhugtan ke liye credit card sweekaar kiye jate hai
 In the context of mountaineering, a halt or bivy is a resting or sleeping temporary arrangement, in which the climber gets less than the full facilities of stay, eating and equipment available in the traditional place of camping
 isamen keval ek sleeping bag or padaav kii bori lenaa or sona bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Sometimes small partial shelter areas such as glacial crevices, rock erosions, and snow ditches are used to protect against wind
 in takneekon kaa prayog asal main apatkaal main kiya jaataa tha; yadhyapi jab barfili gufaaon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye samay or upyukt barf sthiti uplabdh na ho, to kuch parvatarohi padaav ke liye vishesh yojana ke rup main lagaataar alpine style kii ore samarpit rahete hai taaki tamboo kaa vajan batch sake
 in padaavon se sambandhit mukhya jokhim, adhik maatra main thand kii chapet main aane kaa rahata he
 Tents are the most commonly used shelters in the mountains
 ye saadhaaran tarplin ke tukdon se lekar atyadhik baari dijin vaale ho sakate hai jo parvat kii dushkar paristhitiyon se bachane main madad karte hai
 In the event of exposure, it may be necessary to place the tent behind snow or rock
 tamboo lagane kaa ek khatra yah he ki tej hawaaen or baari barfabaari khatarnaak ho sakati he or is kaaran se tamboo karaab hokar tut saktaa he
 In addition, the continuous flutter of the tent cloth can disrupt sleep and increase the fear of shelter safety
 ek tamboo kaa chayan karte samay, arohi vishesh parvatarohan tenton par bharosa karte hai jo vishesh rup se tej hawaaon or bhari barfabaari ko jhelane ke liye banaaye jate hai
 Tent pegs can also be pressed into the snow for extra protection
 
 Where conditions are favorable, ice caves are also another way of shelter on the mountain
 kai parvatarohi bahut oonchaai par tab tak tent kaa prayog nahin karte hai jabatak barf kii sthiti barf kii gupha main rahane kii ajna detii he, kyonki barf kii gufaaen tent kii tulana main kaaphi zyada garm or shant hoti hai
 They can be made relatively easily by giving enough time using an ice shovel
 thik tarah se banaai gayi barf kii gupha kaa taapmaana shunya ke aasapaas mandaraata rahegaa, jiske saapeksh bahari taapmaana garm ho saktaa he
 They can be dug in any place where there is at least four feet of snow
 Quinzi is another type of shelter, which is made by reinforcing snow piles
 kuch parvatarohiyon dwaara iglu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin ise bananaa kathin he or iske liye kuch vishesh barfili paristhitiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Many times in mountaineering, hazards are divided into two categories: objective hazards that are present even when the climber is not present, such as rock fall, avalanche and bad weather, and subjective hazards that are only related to the factors initiated by the climber 
 asaavadhaanee ke kaaran upkaran kii kharabi or tootna, thakaan evam aparyaapt takanic vyaktiparak khatre ke udahaaran hai
 Routes that are constantly altered due to storms and avalanches are considered to have high levels of objective danger, while technically more difficult routes that are relatively safe from these hazards may be considered to be objectively safe
 sankshep main, parvatarohiyon ko in khataron kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie: girti chattaane, girti barf, himaskhalan, parvatarohi kaa girnaa, barfili dhalaanon se girnaa, barfili dhalaanon kaa girnaa, barfili daraaron main girnaa or oonchaai tathaa mausam ke khatre
 in khataron ko kam karne ke liye apane kaushal or anubhav kaa prayog karke ek raste kaa chayan or anusaran karne main hi parvatarohi ke kaushal kii pariksha hoti he
 Each rock is slowly shattered due to erosion, a process that is particularly fast above the ice-line
 chattaanon kaa aakaar pattharon ke girane ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hota rahata he, jis kaaran se dhokhaa ho saktaa he
 Falling rocks form pits on the mountain and these pits have to be climbed very carefully, their edges are often safe while stones fall on the central part
 tazaa mausam ke anusaar chattaane kisi anya chiz kii tulana main zyada girti hai
 Nocturnal snow may temporarily bind the rocks above, but the rising heat or melting of snow during the day can remove these rocks
 aise raaston par girti chattaanon kaa pataa lagane ke liye sthaneey anubhav moolyawaan siddh hote hai
 The direction of the tilt of the rock layer often indicates the severity of the hazard at a specific position; The nature of the rock must also be considered
 Where stone falls frequently, pieces of it will be found below, and falling stones on ice form large pits which are seen from far away
 kisi nae shikhar yaa ek aparichit maarg par chadhane kii yojana banane main parvatarohiyon ko aise nishaanon par vishesh dhyaan dena chahie
 jab girte pathar bahut adhik sankhya main keechaddaar barf yaa pani se milte hai to keechad ke skhalan kaa nirmaan hota he 
 is prakaar kii sambhavit dhalaanon main camping karne se bachanaa chahie
 Locations with a high probability of snow fall can be accurately predicted
 yah himandon ke toote bhaagon main or sakari parvatashrenee ke shikhar par nirmit latakate kinaaron se girti he
 Large icebergs are formed on hard rocks and fall more in good weather withstand cold and stormy days
 girte pattharon kii tarah inase bhi bachanaa zaruri he
 Glaciers form very slowly and reach a state of unstable equilibrium slowly
 They usually fall in the hottest part of the day or shortly thereafter
 ek kushal or anbhavi arohi aamtaur par girti barf ke sabase jatil raste ke bich sabase surakshit maarg kaa chintan karegaa parantu phir bhi garm dinon kii dopaher main aise sthanon se bachanaa chahie
 latakate himand praayah khadi chattaanon par se ek nishchit samyantaral ke baad hat jate hai
 They can always be identified by their debris lying beneath
 inke raste se sadaa bachanaa chahie
 The efficiency of a rock climber is demonstrated by its choice of position and hand, and the skill of holding them after selection
 yah kaaphi had tak us chattan kii kshamta kaa anumaan lagane kii kaabiliyat par nirbhar karata he, jisapar vah khadaa he
 Many weak rocks are strong enough to bear the weight of a person, but experience is needed to know who to trust and skills are required to move the weight without twisting
 kuch kamazor chattaanon par rassi lagaate samay vishesh dhyaan kii zaroorat hoti he, kyonki inase pathar ke neeche girane kii sambhaavna prabal rahati he
 Similarly, proper attention should also be given to them while keeping feet and hands on them
 While crossing the restrictor from quite complex rocks, a dangerous situation may escalate unless both conditions of the restrictor are fixed
 Mutual support has great importance on hard rocks
 do yaa teen arohi ek duusare kii sahaayta se aage badhate hai, athwa duusare dwaara pairon ke liye lagaai gayi barf kii kulhadi par pair rakhkar
 aapasi sahyog kaa sabase pramukh siddhant yah he ki dal ke sabhi sadsy ek duusare kii sahayata se chadhaai karen na ki ek swatantra ikai ke rup main; iname se aage badhate prayek sadsy ko yah pataa hona chahie ki aage or peeche vaala arohi kya kar rahaa he
 a layer of snow is often found on steep rocks after inclement weather, which makes it even more inaccessible
 aisi sthiti main crempon atyant laabhakaari hai
 Avalanche is the lowest risk hazard in the mountains
 log aam taur par yah sochate hai ki ve in khataron ko pahchaanane or isse bachane main sakasham honge
 sachai asal main kaaphi bhinn he
 Every year 120 to 150 people are killed in small icebergs only in the Alps
 inamen adhiktar 20 se 35 kii aayu varg ke anbhavi purush skirs hote hai, lekin isamen ski nirdeshak or guide bhi shaamil hote hai
 There is always danger pressure in crossing the ice plateau
 waapas jane main kaaphi samay or prayaas, behtareen netritv lagata he or sabase mahatvapurn kadaachit himaskhalan hota he jo yah sabit karata he ki sahi nirnay liya gaya tha
 Making the decision to turn becomes even more difficult when other people are crossing the slope as well, but one can become the next person
 himaskhalan ke kai prakaar ke hote hai, lekin do prakaar sabase adhik chintaa ke vishay hai: Hazardous slippery blocks are the place most favored by skiers: tall and wide open, some trees or large rocks, angles of 30 to 45 degrees, just full of fresh snow, big storms Later, on the stormy slope
 Solar radiation can also cause ejaculation
 ye adhiktar bindu relies yaa geela keechad prakaar ke himaskhalan honge
 geeli slide skhalan main judaa vajan shila skhalan kaa chaalu karata he
 Ninety percent of avalanche victims are initiated by them themselves or by other mountaineers of their group
 alpayin raaston par of-pist safar karte samay vaqt dalon ko hameshaa in vastuon ko le jane kii salaah di jaati he
 Avalanche training is also advised to climbers
 vidambnaa yah he ki himaskhalan main hui mauton main sabase pratishat un visheshgy skirs kaa he jinhone himaskhalan prashikshan kiya hota he; shaayad isliye ki ve himaskhalan ke kshetron main ski karnaa zyada pasand karte hon or shaayad isliye kyonki kuch log tej or uyukt muktak banane ke liye apane upkarnon ke saath paryaapt abhyaas nahin karte hai
 Even with the proper rescue equipment and training, one in five is likely to die if trapped in a large avalanche and half are likely to be alive when buried for a few minutes
 iskaa sabase acha samaadhaan yah he ki yah siikhaa jaye ki kis prakaar se jokhim bhari paristithiyon se bachaa jaae
 When traveling on slopes with snow or hard snow, creampons are a standard part of mountaineer's equipment
 jabaki madhyam kone kii barfili dhalaanon par kai baar step-kating kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, phir bhi yah ek dhimi or thakaaoo prakriya he, jo crempons kii ucch suraksha pradaan nahin karti he
 However, in soft ice or powder, crumpons are easily trapped, due to which their effect is reduced
 anya sthiti main, barf kii kulhadi na keval madad karti he balki arohi ko girane yaa phisalane kii sthiti main khud ko samhaalane kii madad bhi karti he
 Yet on a real snowy slope, the ice ax is rarely effective in catching itself
 barf kii dhalaan par khadey rahane ke liye suraksha ke atirikt ehithiyat ke rup main, barf main dabe barf ke pench parvatarohan kii rassi se bandhe hone chahie
 Real icy slopes are rare in Europe, although quite common in tropical regions, where the newly fallen snow melts on the surface soon and flows down, so the next night's cold, the whole fluid converts into a cold-hardened ice cold it happens
 barf kii dhalaane aam hai or inpar chadhaai karnaa bhi aamtaur par asana hota he
 Beneath the slope of the snowpad or ice there is usually a large ice crack, called Bergskrund, where the last slope of the mountain originates from the ice-field or glacier
 aisi barkscrand chalakar paar karne ke liye bahut chaudee hoti hai or inhen barf ke pul se paar karnaa chahie, jiske liye dhynapurvak parikshan or udhyam purvak rassi ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a slippery hall of steep snow slopes can be dangerous because the entire portion of its ice can begin as an ejaculation
 yadi aisi dhalaanon par tedha chadhane ke sthaan par sidhaa chadha jaae to ye zyada surakshit hoti he, kyonki tirchhe yaa kshaitij raste inhen kaatane lagate hai or inkaa drav bahna armbh ho jaataa he
 New snow falling on frozen ice is particularly dangerous
 barf kii sandehaaspad sthiti hone par pragati kii saadhyataa kii jaanch kar lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Snow on the rocks often worsens until it hardens; Ice feels a bit on ice
 ek do din kaa saafe mausam barf ko acchhee sthiti main laa degaa
 barf bahut khadey kone main padi nahin rah sakati he, yadhyapi ankhen isaki dhalaan se dhokhaa kha sakati he
 The snow slope may be inclined to 40 degrees
 sakht jami barf zyada kone tak tik jaati he
 In the morning the snow slopes are hard and safe, but likewise in the afternoon some become soft and dangerous; So there is an advantage in walking quickly
 him daraar ve daraaren yaa gahari khaiyaan hai, jo kisi himand ke padaarthon ke asmaan tal se guzarane par nirmit hoti hai
 They may be open or hidden
 himand ke nichle bhaagon main him daraaren khuli hoti hai
 Above the snow line, they are often hidden by the arched accumulation of winter snow
 chuphi daraaron kaa pataa lagaana badi saavdhaanee or anubhav kaa kaam he
 They can be detected by the sound of an ice ax rod after fresh snow falls, or by looking to the right and left where a partially covered ice crack corner may be open
 durghatana ke khilaaf rassi hi suraksha he or kisi ko bhi kabhi bhi barf se dhakaa himand tabatak paar nahin karnaa chahie jabatak uske paas rassi na ho, yaa phir do saathi ho to or acha he
 Anyone crossing the crevices should also be proficient in protecting from snow cracks
 karaab mausam ke kaaran barf or chattan ki sthitiyon main hone vaale parivartan mukhya rup se khatarnaak hote hai, saamaanya paristithiyon ki tulana main achaanak ghatit hone vaali ye ghatnaye zyada dubhar or hanikaarak hoti hai
 It is difficult to re-locate a path in a white sheet of snow, while rain also prevents the easiest path in dry conditions
 toofaan main keval anubhavyukt paryvekshakon ki tulana main disha ke liye compass kaa prayog karne vaale parvatarohiyon ko zyada laabh hota he
 Of course, in large icy areas, it is more common to go on the wrong track than on a rock, but intelligence and experience are the best aids to escape safely from past threats
 garmi kii aandhi teevr bijli kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakati he
 If climbers are on or near the summit, there is a danger of being killed
 aise kai cese hai, jiname parvat chadhate samay bijli se maare gaye
 In most mountainous regions, localized storms occur after dawn and before dawn
 adhiktar arohi "alpine shuruyaat" lete hai; jo subah se pehle yaa pehali kiran se hota he taaki toofaan kii gatividhi or bijli tej hone par or anya mausami khataron se surakshit rahen
 tej hawaaen hypothermia ke akraman ko baadha saktin hai, saath hi upkarnon ko habi nasht kar sakati hai jaise ki aashray ke liye upyog hone vaala tent
 kuch vishisht sthitiyon main, toofaan jalprapaat kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakate hai, jis kaaran se parvatarohan ki prakriya dhimi yaa band ho sakati he
 The windy winds are a living example of this on the Mount Eijer
 tezi se chadhaai karne se 'atitude sickness' ho sakati he
 The best treatment for this is to come down immediately
 The slogan of ascending at very high is "climb higher, sleep less", which means that the patrons climbed higher to get acclimated but came down to sleep
 In the Andes of South America, coca leaves have traditionally been chewed to avoid acute sickness disease
 atitude sickness ke saamaanya lakshanon main sakht sirdard, sone kii samasya, matlee, bhukh kii kami, susti or badan dard he
 Mountain weakness can increase to hese and hep, both of which can cause death within 24 hours
 oonche parvaton main, vayumandaleey daab kam hota he or is kaaran se saans ke liye oxijan kii kami hoti he
 This is the underlying cause of Attitude Sickness
 har kisi ko abhyast hone kii aavashyaktaa he, yahan tak ki un anbhavi parvatarohiyon ko bhi jo itani oonchaaiyon par pehle bhi chadh chuke hai
 Generally, climbers use bottled artificial oxygen while climbing above 7000 meters
 kuch vishesh parvatarohi oxijan ke bina hi 8000 meter tak kii chotii par chadh jate hai, jiske liye hameshaa abhyaas kaa suniyojit aayojan hota he
 Solar radiation increases significantly in altitude because the atmosphere becomes thinner as it rises, which causes it to absorb less ultraviolet radiation
 barf kaa aavaran vikiran ko paravartit karke baadha saktaa he jis kaaran se dhup main jhulasane or barf ke andhepan kaa khatra 75% tak bad jaataa he
 In 2005, researcher and mountaineer John Sample proved that higher-than-average ozone concentrations in the Tibetan Plateau could pose an additional risk for climbers
 kuch parvat sakriy jwalamukhi hote hai jaise ki sanyojit jwalamukhi jo dweep khandon kii sabase oonchi chotii or andes ke kuch bhaagon main banate hai
 The explosion of these volcanic mountains can pose many hazards, such as lehre, pyroclastic flows, falling rocks, lava flows, large amounts of tephra falling, volcanic eruptions and toxic gases

 Europe and North America, in the middle of Mohimechya style, there is a thunderstorm, due to the many mountain air migration, by carving the pohochu shaktat, te kami, high uneven and tearing, one day and two days
 The differences between the two embarkation styles, and the benefits and dangers are as follows: === Expedition ascension === * Many trips had to be made to carry goods from the lower camps to the upper camps
 Arohan Style Mileage Advantage Matter riskier or both configurations
 * The crew size is also larger due to the need for more supplies between the camps than the Alpine style
 * alpine shailishi tulana kelyas, shibiradarmyaan adhik puravathyachi garaj yamule sanghacha aakaar adhik mothaa asato
