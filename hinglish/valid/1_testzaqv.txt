 Acro dance is a style of dance in which the elements of acrobatic are subtly associated with classical dance techniques
 yah hrisht-pusht charitra dwaara paribhaashit, apni anuthi nritykala, jisame nrity or kalabaji kaa bejod mishran he or isamen kalabaji kaa upyog nrity ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he
 It is a popular dance form of amateur competitive dance as well as professional dance theater and contemporary circus productions such as the Circue du Soleil
 yah talbaddh or kalatmak jimnastic ke vipareet he, jo aise khel hai jiname jimnastic ke sandarbh main nrity ke tatwon ko kriyanvit kiya jaataa he, jisame harek nrity ko shaasi jimnastic
sanghathan or ankon ke code dwaara viniyamit kiya ja rahaa he
 Acro dance is known by a variety of other names, including acrobatic dance and gymnastic dance, although it is usually referred to simply as dance by dancers and professionals
 acro nrity style ke rup main nartkiyon ke liye ek vishesh rup se chunauti kyonki unke liye nrity-kala or kalabaji-kaushal donon main prashikshit hone kii aavashyaktaa he
 Acro dancers must possess excellent physical abilities, as acro demands physical activity
 haalanki acro ek lokapriy nrity style he, fer bhi kai nrity skulon main yah nahin sikhaaya jaataa he, aksar acrobtic prashikshan ke liye aavashyak suvidhaon yaa visheshgyata kii kami ke kaaran
 Acrobatic dance originated in the early 1900s in the United States and Canada as a form of performance performed at Wadeville
 haalanki 1900 se purv kai dashakon se vyaktigat nrity or acrobetic ang-sanchaalan ke kaary wadevil main pradarshit kiye jate rahe hai, yah 1900 tak aakar yah nrity or acrobetic ang-sanchalanon ke sanyukt mishran kaa lokapriy pradarshan ho gaya
 Acrobatic dance did not appear abruptly in Wadeville, but rather, it gradually appeared over time in several variations of its format, and as a result no single artist has been cited as its originator
 sharman kots, jisane watermelone trust ke saath 1900 se 1914 tak pradarshan kiya, use saathi nartkiyon ne abtak kii pehali acrobetic nartki

 In 1914, Kalabaz Lulu Coats formed Krackjackets, a popular vaudeville troupe that featured colorful acrobatic dance in their performances, but the troupe dispersed in 1952
 gens bros sahit kai anya lokapriy wadeville companiya unke sho main main kalabaji or nrity kaa pradarshan shaamil karti thim
 Since the fall of the Vaudeville era, acrobatic dance has come into its present form following a multidimensional development process
 is vikaas kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu nrity andolanon ke liye neenv ke rup main baile takanic kaa ekikaran he, is prakaar acro nrity main farm or ang-sanchaalan kii parishuddhta laai gayi jo wadevil acrobetic nrity main anupasthit thi
 In addition, Wadeville acrobatic dances were often little more than acrobatic sets of music, while modern acro dances are fundamentally mere dances, more than the determined acrobatics of organ movements performed in the context of dances
 acro kii paribhaashit visheshta nrity or acrobetic ang-sanchalanon ke bich nirbaadh, sundar sankraman he
 Also, in terms of its acrobatic content, a dance should have a significant percentage of dance movement, so that it can be classified as acro
 For example, gymnastic floor exercise is not considered acro because it lacks dance movements compared to its acrobatic material, and also because it lacks a smooth transition between dance and gymnastics movements
 acro main ang-sanchalanon ko baile, jaij, gitatmak or aadhunik nrity shaileyon main santhaapit kiya gaya he
 Movement in acro dance is not prohibited in these dance styles, but the complete absence of these styles will generally lead to the birth of a dance that can be classified as something different than acro
 goes
 kai karaamaat saamanytah acro nrity main pradarshit hote hai, jatilta or unhen karne ke liye aavashyak kaushal vyapak rup se badalte rahete hai
 In addition to the obvious requirement that dancers require for performing the required skills, there are types of tricks that can be performed in an acro dance that depend on the number of dancers
 ekal kartabon ko swatantra nartkiyon dwaara ekal yaa samuhik nrity main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Examples of this are: dohare kartab bhi nartak- nartkiyon ke bhagidaari vaale kartab ke rup main jane jate hai---jise nartak-nartkiyon kii ek jodi dwaara hi pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 An example of this is the pitch tuck, in which a dancer holds the shape of a jean with her hand with a 'saddle'
 lathi par duusari nartki apane kadam rakhti he or phir pehali nartki lathi
ko urdhvamukhi kar detii he
 The second dancer, who is automatic with upward-back rotation, lands on foot after a full orbit in the air
 ekaro parteners kabhi kabhi ekal yaa dabl kartabon ke alaava nartki ko shobhaneey tareeke se upar uthaa lene ko pradarshit karenge
 Group tricks usually require three or more dancers
 iske udhaaharan hai: Acro dances are usually performed on widely varying hard surfaces
 is tarah ke farsh vastutah jimnastic farsh se kaaphi alag hote hai, jinka nirmaan gaddedaar fom or spring ke farsh ke upar maanak sataha bichhaakar kiya jaataa he
 While gymnasts perform barefoot and rely on standard gymnastics floors for stretch and flexibility, acro dancers rarely dance barefoot, instead relying on shoes such as acro shoes or leather-striped thongs So as to provide necessary tension and traction to the feet
 sabhi prakaar ke saamaanya acro juute khinchaav or lacheelaapan donon pradaan karte hai
 In addition, the surfaces of the acro display are often rough, so the foot soles must be protected from skin friction through acro shoes
 Protection from friction is necessary, especially for the padded toes of the foot, as they have to endure considerable friction from jumps and rounds during very fast dances
 parshv phislan se bachane ke liye karshan aavashyak he anyathaa kathor farsh par girnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 The cushioning of the tux and layout has a soft comfortable effect, as in performing these tricks the dancer's feet can hit the floor at high speeds
 jab marle farsh anuplabdh he, aisi sthiti main gaddi lagaana vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he, kyonki is prakaar kii pradarshan kii khuli satahen jinpar gaddi nahin lagi hai ve atyant kathor or mushkil paidaa karne vaali ho sakati he
 Acro dancers often wear jazz dance shoes, which acro dancers commonly call acro shoes
 acro juute ke vibhinn nirmaataaon ne inke alag-alag naam die hai: jaaj boots, jaaj takhne boots, jaaj bootis or anya
 ve aam taur par feeton ke bina hote hai, slip-on shoes, jinke upree hisse chust chamade se bane aisi dizin ke hote hai ki nartki ke pairon ko juute ke andar sthanantaran se roka ja sake
 unke patale, komal upree chamade or alag-alag talvon kii vajah se, acro juuton main utkrisht lacheelaapan hota he, is prakaar ye nartkiyon ko achche nrity rup or acrobetic niyantran paane main sakasham karte hai talavaa mulaayam, thos rabad se bana hota he taaki ucch karshan or gaddedaar lacheelaapan donon hi mili or chunki yah pair ke nichle hisse ko puri tarah dhanke rakhata he atah yah twachaa gharshan se utkrisht sangrakshan pradaan karata he
 Less commonly, acro dancers wear foot thongs, called by various names such as dance paz and foot undies, depending on the producer
 foot thongs - jo slip-on hai, pair ko aanshik dhankati hai ve pair ke keval gaddidaar panje kii raksha karti hai---saundarya kaarnon ke liye kabhi kabhi acro juute se adhik pasand kii jaati hai
 In particular, fleshy colored thongs give the wearer the impression of being barefoot, while traction, cushioning and abrasion protection are provided by acro shoes only
 acro nartkiyon aamtaur par suraksha or saundarya kaarnon se lacheele, tan par chust vastra pahenti hai
 Tight-fitting clothing is preferred over loose-fitting clothing because loose clothing is unable to keep pace with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control
 yah khaskar tab mahatvapurn he jab ek nartki kartabon kaa pradarshan kar rahi hoti he kyonki niyantran kho jane se gambhir chot lag sakati he
 In addition to the safety aspect, tight clothing on the body embodies the shape of a dancer's body, which helps to make the scene of an acro dance performance quite effective
 pratiyogi acro nartkiyon jab nrity pratiyogitaaon main pradarshan karti hai aksar veshbhusha dhaaran karti hai
 Acro costumes often consist of loose small pieces of clothing such as short skirts, but these pieces are measured carefully to ensure that they do not pose a risk to safety
 ek atirikt suraksha upaay ke rup main, scurts ko peeche se kabhi kabhi qamar ke neeche pin kar diya jaataa he yaa silaai kar di jaati he taaki nartki jab ulate latake tab puri lambaai main ye na jhul jaaen jaisaaki handwaking main yah skirt ko roktaa he-- anyathaa yah nartki ke bal yaa topi se ulajh jayega---nartki ke sir se sampark saadhe bina
 Acro dance is not equally defined within the competitive dance industry
 kuch nrity pratispardhaa companiyon ko acro niyamavali ke liye adhiktam pachaas pratishat acrobetic saamagree ke saath kam se kam chaar yaa paanch kartabon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Other companies require fifty percent or more of acrobatic material to fix an acro manual
 iske alaava, kuch pratiyogitaaon main ek acro nrity spasht rup se paribhaashit "acro nrity" ke pradarshan kii shrenee main feet baithta he, jabaki dusron main, yah "acro / gym," kii shrenee main aata he yaa ek vaikalpik varg, jiseki "open" main aa saktaa he
 Because of these differences, it may be necessary to set a specific acro manual for different performance categories in different competitions

 It is said that in India, Shvetketu first established the dignity of marriage
 china, misr or yunaan ke pracheen sahitya main bhi kuch aise ullekh milte hai
 On the basis of these, Western scholars like Lord Avbury, Fisson, Howitt, Taylor, Spencer, Geelankov Levsky, Lyert and Shurts etc
 considered the primitive condition of marriage to be in the working condition
 kropatakin vlakh or vrafalt ne pratipaadit kiya ki praarambhik kaamchaar kii dasha ke baad bahubharyata yaa anek patniyaan rakhane kii pratha viksit hui or iske baad ant main ek hi nari ke saath panigrahan karne kaa niyam prachlit hua
 But Charles Darwin strongly refuted this notion of a primitive form of marriage on the basis of pranics, with the Westermark, Clove Grass and Krale Prabhriti sociologists confirming this view
 prasiddh samajashastri rirkh ne likhaa he ki hamaare paas is kalpana kaa koi pusht pramaan nahin he ki bhootkaal main kabhi kamachar kii saamaanya dasha prachlit thi

 In Hindu society, from the Vedic era, the belief is prevalent that the wife is half of the human being, the man remains incomplete until he gets a child by producing a wife

 Marriage is a religious affair

 In the Vedic era it was compulsory for everyone to perform a yajna, but the yajna cannot be complete without a wife, so marriage was religiously necessary for everyone

 They cannot marry anyone outside that class
 duusare prakaar ke niyamon ke anusaar prayek vyakti ko ek vishisht samooh se baahar ke vyaktiyon ke saath hi, vivaah karnaa padataa he

 In societies where marriage is considered a religious rite, marriage is often considered to be inseparable relationship
 hindu evam roman catholic isaai samaaj iske sundar udhaaharan he
 But even though there is a lot of difference in terms of rules of divorce or divorce, there are some fundamental principles in common
 vivaah mukhya rup se santanprapti evam daanpaty sambandh ke liye kiya jaataa he, kintu yadi kisi vivaah main ye praapt na hon to daanpaty jivan ko naarkeey yaa vifal banane kii apeksha vivahaviched kii anumati di jaani chahie
 In order to avoid misuse of this system, the right to divorce is given at a special stage with many restrictions
 talaak kaa mukhya aadhaar vyabhichaar he kyonki yah vaivaahik jivan ke mul par hi kutharaghaat karanevaala he
 Apart from this, there is some other reason also
 plato ke samay se vichaarak vivaah-pratha kii samaapti kii tathaa rajya dwaara bacchon ke paalan kii kalpana kar rahe hai
 There is no dearth of people predicting the disappearance of the institution of marriage on the basis of the industrial and scientific changes of the present times and the increasing number of searches in Western countries

 vivaah or talaak ke naveen kanoon daanpaty adhikaron main narnari ke adhikaron ko samaan bana rahe hai
 Faith in religion and the invention of the means of contraception have deepened the old marriage-related beliefs, pre-matrimonial chastity and purity
 kintu ye sab parivartan hote hue bhi bhavishya main vivahapratha ke bane rahane kaa prabal kaaran yah he ki isse kuch aise prayojan puure hote hai, jo kisi anya saadhan yaa sanstha se nahin ho sakate
 The first purpose is to increase the family
 yadhyapi vigyaan ne kritrim garbhaadhan kaa avishkaar kiya he kintu kritrim rup se shishuon kaa prayogshaalaon main utpaadan or vikaas sambhav prathit nahin hota
 The second purpose is the rearing of children, no matter how much the state and society should develop the nurseries and the balodiyans, the system of all round proper development is not possible in them, as is done in the institution of marriage and family
 teesraa prayojan sachche daanpaty prem or sukhprapti kaa he

 yah charitra 1997 kii sarviver siries main, montrial scrujob ke baad kushti ke prashansakon main macmohan ke liye asal jindagi kii ghrinaa se ubhara tha
 Many other trios have become an integral part of mcmahon's on-camera personality, such as a special awe-inspiring voice from his throat "you're Fired!" And his "power Walk" —a exasperated stride towards the ring, sideways with a large cocky manner, flapping his head and jerking his head
 This is usually accompanied by a comment by Jim Ross, such as "the only man i know who can walk like this
 " power vaak kaa prayog darshakon se ek pratikriya paane ke liye kiya jaataa he,, lekin saath hi yah ek haasyatmak sukun bhi detaa he
 WWE Superstar John Cena said in a joke on the WWE Exposed Special before WWE Homecoming that mcmahon "moves as if he has a sweep stick in his anus"
 According to Jim Cornette, the Power Walk was inspired by Dr
 Jerry Graham, one of Vince mcmahon's favorite wrestlers as a child

 In Memphis, Tennessee), Lawler was seen as a prominent innocent-faced character in contrast to the personality in which he appeared as a timid bastard), while mcmahon's Memphis audience Appears as a contented bastard who lowered Lawler from the unshakable chair of the "emperor of Professional Wrestling"

 During this angle, mcmahon never directly disclosed that he was the owner of the WWF and the feud between Lawler and mcmahon was also not shown on WWF television, and even the two teamed up for the television show Superstars
 The commentary continued
 lollar or macmohan ke bich jhagade ne 1993 main summerslam main heart ke viruddh lollar ke match kii ore maahaul banane main madad kii
 The angle reached its peak when Tatanka defeated Lawler and won the United World Championship when mcmahon stared Lawler wearing a championship belt

 heart ne iskaa pratyuttar dene se manaa kar diya
 However, mcmahon rose up and ordered the referee to ring the bell so that Hart was screwed out of the competition and Michaels could be declared champion
 is ghatana ko baad main "montrial scrujob" kaa naam diya gaya
 On Raw Is War in December 1997, the night after d-generation X: In Your House, Vince mcmahon spoke about the behavior and attitude of Stone Cold Steve Austin, as Austin battled with wwf's official commissioner Sloter
 And the way he attacked WWF announcers, such as Jim Ross and mcmahon himself
 mistar macmohan ne yah maang kii thi ki austin dubaara yojit match main da rock ke viruddh apane intercantinental championships ko bachaa le
 jaisaa ki pichley match main, stone cold ne da rock or nesan of domination gang ke viruddh apane pikup trek kaa istemaal ek hathiyaar ke rup main kiya tha
 Austin had decided to snatch the title from The Rock, but then Austin gave The Rock a stone cold stunner and threw Vince mcmahon off the ring's ropes
 jab ro hawa main uchhal gaya, to mistar macmohan ne austin ko agbabula hokar dekha, vins ne ek steel kii kursi uthaai or phir aisa laga ki donon ladane hi vaale hai, lekin referi or dablyoodablyooeff ke adhikariyon ne donon vyaktiyon ko roak diya
 This was the beginning of the austin-mcmahon rivalry

 When asked by Kevin Kelly if he wanted to see Stone Cold Steve Austin as WWF Champion, he said it would be a commercial public relations nightmare
 jab unase dubaara poocha gaya ki haan yaa nahin, to unhone kaha "yah sirf ek nahin kii baat nahin he, yah ek bahut bura nahin he or austin, yahi ekmaatr aakiri kaaran he kyonki vins macmohan ne aisa kaha, bahut bahut dhanyavad

 Austin responded to this as another stunner and told the crowd of viewers "what you just saw is a difficult way of doing the work
