 The word "spreadsheet" comes from "spread" which is derived from the sense of a newspaper or magazine object consisting of two pages face to face, which extends from the center of the middle to both sides of both pages and Considered a big page

 a batch 'spreadsheet' is indistinguishable from a batch compiler with added input data, which produces an output report
 However, this concept of electronic spreadsheet was outlined by Richard Matesich in the 1961 paper "budgeting Model and System Simulation"
 a computerized spreadsheet applied by Matesich for subsequent work and its companion edition, Matesich accounting and budgeting systems
 These batch spreadsheets were primarily concerned with the addition or subtraction of entire columns or rows and not individual 'cells'

 Important inventions in the development of electronic spreadsheets Rene
 Pardo and Remy Landau, who in 1970 entered the spreadsheet automated natural order recalculation algorithm in 1971 US Patent 43,98,249
 jabaki patent ko shuru main ek vishuddh ganitiya avishkaar hone ke kaaran, 12 varshon kii apil ke baad, patent karyaalay dwaara asweekaar kar diya gaya, pardo or landau ne CCPA main ek ugantkaari mukadmaa jeeta jisane 1983 main patent karyaalay ke nirnay ko palat diya - or yah sthapit kiya ki "koi chiz keval isliye patent kii yogyata nahin kho sakati kyonki naveenta kii bindu ek elgorithm main he
 "however, in 1995 the US Appellate Court for the Federal Circuit declared this patent unenforceable
 
 The actual software was called LANPAR - Language for Programming Arrays at Random
 It was conceived and developed in the summer of 1969, after Pardo and Landau recently graduated from Harvard University
 sah-avishkaarak rene pardo yaad karte hai ki unhone mahasoos kiya ki bel canada ke ek prabandhak ko bajet prapatron ko banane or sanshodhit karne ke liye programmer par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie or unhone upyogkartaaon dwaara prapatr ko kisi bhi kram main tip karne kii kalpana kii jiske parinaamon kii gananaa computer sahi kram main karegaa
 is software ko 1969 main viksit kiya gaya
 LANPAR was used by Bell Canada, AT&T and 18 operating telcos across the country for their local and national budget operations
 LANPAR was also used by General Motors

 Without natural order recalculation, users will have to recalculate the spreadsheet manually as needed until the values of all fields are changed
 LANPAR pranali ko, GE400 or honeywel 6000 online timecering system par lagu kiya gaya jisase upyogkarta, computer terminlon or modem ke madhyam se program banane main sakasham ho gaye
 Data can be entered dynamically either by paper tape, specific file access, online, or even via external data bases
 Sophisticated mathematical expressions, including logical comparisons and "if / give" statements, can be used in any field, and mines can be presented in any order

 This application has been used successfully for many years to develop various applications, such as financial and cost models for the US Congress and Conrail
 APLDOT was dubbed a "spreadsheet" because financial analysts and strategic planners used it to solve the same problems they solved with paper spreadsheet pads
 spredshit avadharana, dan briclin or bob francston dwaara visicalc ke karyanvayan ke chalate 1970 ke dashak ke uttarardh or 1980 ke dashak ke purvardh main vyapak rup se jaani gai
 visicalc was the first spreadsheet that incorporated all the necessary features of all applications of modern spreadsheets, such as the WYSIWYG interactive user interface, automatic recalibration, status and formula lines, range copying with relative and absolute references, formulas choosing context fields 
 PC World magazine called visicalc the first electronic spreadsheet

 Lotus 1-2-3, with its rival Borland Quattro, soon displaced visicalc
 Lotus 1-2-3 was released on January 26, 1983, and it surpassed the most popular visicalc in sales that year and was the leading spreadsheet for DOS for many years

 kai companiyon ne, bilkul bhinn pratimaan par aadhaarit program ke saath spredshit bazaar main daakhil hone kaa prayaas kiya
 For example Lotus started a program that was most successful, Lotus Improv, which had some commercial success, particularly in the financial world where its powerful data mining capabilities are still respected today
 spredshit 2000 ne sutara nirmaan ko naatakeey rup se saral karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin aam taur par safal nahin rahaa
 An "eat" can be thought of as a box containing a figure
 ek ekal khaane ko aamtaur par iske stambh or pankti se sandarbhit kiya jaataa he 
 saamagree ke anusaar iske aakaar ko badalane ke liye aamtaur par isaki lambaai yaa chaudaai ko milan rekhaon ko khinch kar kiya ja saktaa he box 
 The array of mines is called a "sheet" or "worksheet"
 paaramparik computer program main yah char kii ek vyuh rachana ke anuroop he 
 adhikansh prayogon main, kai kaaryapatrak ko ek ekal spredshit ke bheetar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 a worksheet is simply a subdivision of a spreadsheet that is divided for clarity
 kaaryaatmak rup se, ek spredshit sampoornataa main sanchalit hoti he or spredshit ke bheetar sabhi khaane vaishvik char ke rup main sanchalit hote hai 
 a cell can contain a value or a formula, or it can simply be left blank
 parampara ke anusaar, sutara aamtaur par = sanket ke saath shuru hote hai
 a value can be entered from a computer keyboard or typed directly into a field
 vaikalpik rup se, ek maan kisi sutara par aadhaarit ho saktaa he, jo ek pariklan kar saktaa he, vartmaan dinaank yaa samay dikhaa saktaa he, ek bahya data ko praapt kar saktaa he jaise stock kot yaa database mulya
 Spreadsheet value rule
 Some initial spreadsheets required manual requests for recalculation, because large or complex spreadsheet calculations often reduced data entry speed
 kai aadhunik spredshits abhi bhi is vikalp ko barkaraar rakhe hue he
 This feature requires updating the contents of a cell periodically when its value is taken from an external source - such as a field in another "remote" spreadsheet
 For shared and web-based spreadsheets, this applies to the "immediate" update field that has been changed by another user
 sabhi nirbhar khaanon ko bhi adhyatan kiya janaa hota he
 Once entered, the selected fields can optionally be "closed" to avoid accidental rewrite
 aam taur par yah un khaanon par lagu hota he jisamen sutara hote hai, lekin un par bhi lagu ho saktaa he jisamen "sthiraank" hote hai jaise ek kilogram / pound roopantaran kaarak 
 vyaktigat khaane ko band chihnit kiye jane ke baavjood, spredshit ke aankade tab tak surakshit nahin hai jab tak is suvidha ko fil variyataon main sakriy nahin kiya jaataa
 a field or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value will be displayed
 The default display format is usually determined by its initial content, if it has not been specifically pre-determined, so for example "31 / 12 / 2007" or "january 31, 2007", the "date" of the field The format is the default
 isi prakaar, ek sankhyatmak maan ke baad ek % sanket jodne se vah khaanaa pratishat cell formet ke rup main tag hoga
 khaane kii saamagree is praaroop se parivartit nahin hogi, keval pradarshit maan badalegaa
 Some food formats such as "numeric" or "currency" can also specify the number of decimal places
 " This may allow illegal operation, leading to illogical results without proper warning
 spredshit anuprayog kii kshamta par nirbhar karte hue, prayek kaksh ko pruthak rup se swaroopit kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye yaa to saamagree kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he yaa kaksh kaa 
 ek spredshit kii pathneeyata main vruddhi karne ke liye, kaksh swarupan ko sashart data par lagu kiya ja saktaa he - udhaaharan ke liye, ek rinatmak sankhya ko laal rang main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The formatting of a cell generally does not affect its contents and depending on how the cells are referenced or copied to other worksheets or applications, formatting may or may not be done with the content
 adhikansh prayogon main, ek kaksh, yaa ek stambh yaa pankti main kakshon ke samooh kaa "namakaran" kiya ja saktaa he jisase upyogkarta us kaksh ko grid sandarbh ke bajaay naam dwaara sandarbhit karne main sakasham hota he
 Names must be unique within a spreadsheet, but when a spreadsheet file uses multiple sheets, a similarly named cell range can be used on each sheet if it is identified by adding the sheet name
 is prayog ke liye ek kaaran he macrose kaa nirmaan yaa parichaalan jo kai shit main ek aadesh ko doharaata he
 Another reason is that the formulas containing the named variables are tested quickly against the algebra they implement
 The use of named variables and named verbs also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent
 kisi namit kaksh ke sthaan par, ek vaikalpik drushtikon he kaksh sandarbh kaa prayog
 adhikansh kaksh sandarbh, samaan spredshit main ek anya kaksh kaa sanket dete hai, lekin ek kaksh sandarbh ek samaan spredshit ke bheetar ek alag kaksh ko sandarbhit kar saktaa he, yaa puri tarah se kisi anya spredshit main ek kaksh ko, yaa ek duurastha anuprayog se kisi maan ko
 a typical cell reference in the "A1" style is made up of one or two case-sensitive letters to identify the column followed by the row number
 Either part can be relative, or absolute
 The optional "R1C1" reference style consists of the letter R, the row number, the letter C, and the column number; The relative row or column number is indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets
 sabase haal ke spredshit A1 style kaa upyog karte hai, jinamein se kuch ek sangatta vikalp ke rup main R1C1 style pradaan karte hai
 When a computer calculates a formula to update the displayed value of that cell in a cell, the cell references in that cell that designate another cell prompt the computer to fetch the value of the named cell
 samaan "shit" main ek kaksh ko aamtaur par is rup main sambodhit kiya jaataa he:- a cell on a separate sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as: - kuch spredshit karyanvayan, ek kaksh sandarbh ko ek hi computer yaa ek sthaneey network par anya spredshit main anumati dete hai 
 yah, ek hi computer yaa network par kisi anya khuli or sakriya spredshit main ek kaksh ko sandarbhit kar saktaa he jise saajha-yogya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 These references contain the complete filename, such as: - ek spredshit main, kakshon ke liye sandarbh swatah navinikrut ho jate hai, jab nai panktiyon yaa stambhon ko sammilit yaa nasht kiya jaataa he
 But special care must be taken when adding a row in front of a column sum to ensure that the value of the additional rows is displayed in the sum - which is not often! ek vrittiya sandarbh tab hota he jab ek kaksh ke sutara main aisa sandarbh hota he jo pratyaksh-yaa paroksh rup se, sandarbhon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se, prayek kaksh anya kaksh kii ore ishaara karata he jisamen agle kaksh ke liye shrinkhalaa par sandarbh he - ek kaksh kii ore sanket karata he
 Several common types of errors induce such circular references
 haalanki, aisi kuch vaid takneekein hai jo ki is tarah ke vrittiya sandarbh kaa upyog kar rahi hai
 Such techniques converge to the correct values for those cells after several recalculations of the spreadsheet
 isi tarah, kakshon kii namankit shrenee kaa upyog karne ke bajaay, ek shrenee sandarbh kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 a reference to a range of cells is common to a form that specifies all cells in the range A1 through A6
 "= SUM " jaisaa ek sutara sabhi nirdisht kakshon ko jod saktaa he or parinaam ko sutara vaale kaksh main hi rakhata he
 In the initial spreadsheet, the cells were a simple two-dimensional grid
 samay ke saath, model ko vistaarit karte hue ek tisare aayam ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya or kuch maamalon main namit grid kii ek shrinkhalaa ko, jise shits kaha jaataa he
 The most advanced example is data allowing rotation and inverse operations that can present and sort data sets in various ways
 ek sutara us pariklan kii pahchaan karata he jisaki aavashyaktaa parinaam ko us kaksh main rakhane ke liye hoti he jisamen vah nihit hota he
 The performance of a cell containing a formula therefore has two components; That formula itself and the resulting value
 That formula is normally shown only when a particular cell is selected by "clicking" that cell, otherwise it contains the result of the calculation
 ek sutara kisi kaksh yaa kakshon kii shrinkhalaa ke liye maan detaa he or aam taur par iskaa praaroop he: Where the expression includes: jab kisi kaksh main koi sutara shaamil hota he, to usamen aksar anya kakshon ke liye sandarbh shaamil hota he
 Such a cell is a type of reference variable
 iskaa maan, sandarbhit kaksh yaa isaki kisi vyutpatti kaa maan he
 If that cell in turn refers to another cell, the value depends on their value
 sandarbh, saapeksh ho saktaa he, nirpeksh yaa mishrit pankti-waar yaa stambh-waar nirpeksh / saapeksh 
 The options available for valid formulas depend on particular spreadsheet implementations but, in general, most arithmetic operations and fairly complex nested conditional operations can be executed by most commercial spreadsheets today
 aadhunik karyanvayan, custom-nirmit kriyaaon, duurastha data or anuprayogon ke abhigam ke liye bhi sankriyaayein pesh karte hai
 a formula may include a condition - without or with actual calculation - and is sometimes used solely to uncover and identify errors
 neeche die gaye udhaaharan main, yah mana gaya he ki pratishat ke stambh ke yoga ko vaidhata ke liye jaancha jaataa he or ek spasht sandesh ko asann dayee taraf ke kaksh main daalaa jaataa he
 a spreadsheet does not need to hold a formula and in that case it would be considered just a collection of data organized into rows and columns such as a calendar, timetable, or simple list
 Many spreadsheets are used for this purpose only because of its ease of use, formatting, and hyperlinking capabilities
 spredshit main aamtaur par kai aapurti kii gai kriyaayein shaamil hoti hai, jaise ankaganit sankriyaayein trikonmiti sankriyaayein, sankhyikeey kriyaayein or isi tarah anya
 iske alaava vahaan aksar prayokta-paribhaashit kriyaayein ke liye ek praavdhaan he
 In Microsoft Excel, these functions are defined using Visual Basic in the provided Visual Basic Editor and such actions are automatically accessible on the worksheet
 iske atirikt, aise program ko likhaa ja saktaa he jo kaaryapatrak se jaankaree khinche, kuch pariklan kare or parinaamon ko waapas kaaryapatrak main suchit kare
 chitra main, sq naam prayokta-pradutt he or kriya sq ko Excel ke saath pradaan kii kiye gaye Visual Basic ke prayog se pesh kiya gaya he
 The name manager displays spreadsheet definitions of named variables x and y
 kriyaayein khud kaaryapatrak main nahin likh sakati, balki keval apana moolyankan lautaati hai
 However, in Microsoft Excel, a subroutine can write values or text found in a subroutine directly to a spreadsheet
 yah aankada, ek sabaroutine ke liye Visual Basic code ko darshata he jisamen namit stambh char x ke prayek sadsy kaa naam he, apane varg kii gananaa karata he or us maan ko namit stambh char y ke tatsthani tatv main likhata he
 The y-column has no formula because its value is calculated in the subroutine, not on the spreadsheet and written only inside
 jab bhi ek kaksh yaa kakshon ke samooh ke liye ek sandarbh banaaya jaataa he jo vartmaan bhautik spredshit fil ke bheetar sthit nahin hai, to ise ek "duurastha" spredshit ke abhigam ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The contents of the referenced cell can be accessed on the first reference with a manual update or, as recently as in the case of web-based spreadsheets, as a real-time value with a specified automatic driven refresh interval
 kai spredshit anuprayog, chart, rekhankan yaa histogram kii anumati dete he jise kaksh ke nirdisht samoohon se utpann kiya jaataa he jo kaksh saamagree ke parivartan ke saath gatisheel rup se nirmit hote hai
 The generated graphic component can either be contained in the current sheet or added as a separate object
 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh or 1990 ke dashak ke purvardh main, pehla Javelin Software or baad main Lotus Improv saamne aae or paaramparik spredshit main ek model ke vipareet, ve un model kaa upyog karte hai jinhen char kahi jane vaali vastu par banaaya jaataa he, na ki ek report ke kakshon main nihit data par

 udhaaharan ke liye, Javelin ke upyogkarta ek aarekh par charon ke bich ek conection se hote hue gum sakate the or saath hi aisa karte hue prayek char kii shakhaon or taarkik jadon ko dekh sakate the
 This is an example of the primary contribution of early Javelin - which was the concept of traceability of a user's logic or model structure through its twelve views
 a complex model can be divided and understood by others who have no hand in its construction and it remains unique even today
 Javelin kaa istemaal mukhya rup se vittiya modelling ke liye kiya gaya tha, lekin iskaa prayog college ke rasayan vigyaan ke paathyakramon main anudeshaatmak model ke nirmaan main, duniya kii arthvyavasthaaon ko swaroopit karne main or sena dwaara aarambhik star waar pariyojna main bhi kiya gaya
 yah aaj bhi un sansthaaon dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he jinke liye model akhandta mahatvapurn mishan he
 In these programs, a time series, or any variable, was a goal in itself, not a collection of cells that appears only in a column or row
 char kii kai visheshtaayen ho sakati hai, jisamen shaamil hai anya sabhi charon ke saath unke sampark kii puri jaankaree, data sandarbh or text or chhavi note
 gananaa ko in vastuon par sampadit kiya gaya, jo kakshon kii shrenee ke vipareet tha, isliye do samay shrinkhalaa ko jodne se ve swachaalit rup se calendar samay main jud jate hai, yaa ek prayokta-paribhaashit samay seemaa main
 data, kaaryapatrak-char se swatantra the or isliye data ko ek pankti, stambh yaa sampurna kaaryapatrak ko mitaane ke dwaara bhi nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 udhaaharan ke liye, janvari kii laagat ko janvari ke rajasav main se ghataya jaataa he, isse koi fark nahin padataa ki donon kaaryapatrak par dikhte hai yaa nahin
 isse un kriyaaon kii anumati milti he jise pivat teble main istemaal kiya gaya tha, sivaay iske ki report saarini kaa lacheela her-pher un tamaam kshamtaaon main se ek tha jo char dwaara samarthit tha
 In addition, if costs are recorded by week and revenue by month, Javelin's program can allocate or interpolate in the right direction
 is vastu dizin ne char or puure model ko prayokta paribhaashit char naam ke saath ek duusare ko sandarbhit karne main sakasham banaaya or bahuaiami vishleshan ko or bade paimaane ke aasaani se sampadit kiye jane yogya samekan ko pradarshit kiya
 Spreadsheets, which have a formula language based on logical expressions rather than arithmetic expressions, are called logical spreadsheets
 aise spredshits ko unke kaksh maan ke bare main nigamanaatmak tareeke se tark dene ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Just as early programming languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts, programming techniques themselves have evolved so much that they can process data tables more efficiently in the computer itself
 vikaas karte hue spredshit ne VBA jaisi shaktishaalee programing bhashaaon kaa upyog karnaa shuru kiya; vishesh rup se, ve kaaryaatmak, drishyaatmak or bahu-pratimaan bhashaaen hai
 Many people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than to write similar sequential programs
 aisa spredshits ke do gunon ke kaaran he
 a 'spreadsheet program' is designed to perform general computing tasks for which it uses spatial relationships rather than time as the primary organizing principle
 
 It is often convenient to view a spreadsheet as a mathematical graph, where the nodes are the cells and edges of the spreadsheet are references to other cells specified in the formulas
 This is often called the dependency graph of a spreadsheet
 kakshon ke bich sandarbh ko sthanik avadharanaon kaa laabh mil saktaa he jaise saapeksh sthiti or nirpeksh sthiti, saath hi saath namit sthaan, taaki spredshit sutron ko samajhnaa or prabandhit karnaa adhik aasaan ho sake
 Spreadsheets usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells on which they depend have been changed
 aarambhik spredshit main saral takneekon kaa prayog hota tha jaise ek vishesh kram main kakshon kaa moolyankan, lekin aadhunik spredshit, nirbharta graph se ek nunatam pun:sanganana kram kii gananaa karti he
 Subsequent spreadsheets had a limited ability to propagate the values in reverse, changing the source values in such a way that a particular answer reached a certain cell
 chunki spredshit ke kaksha sutara aamtaur par vyutkramntic nahin hai, phir bhi, is takanic kaa kuch had tak simit mahatv he
 Many concepts, common in sequential programming models, correspond to them in the spreadsheet world
 udhaaharan ke liye, anukramit loop ke anukramik model ko aam taur par samaan sutron ke saath kaksha kii ek talika ke rup main darshaya jaataa he, 
 While spreadsheets are a major step forward in quantitative modeling, they also have drawbacks
 samgr prayokta laabh ke str par, spredshit main kai pramukh kamiyaan hai, vishesh rup se alpha newmeric khaanon ke paton ke amithravat hone se sambandhit
 Other problems associated with spreadsheets include: jabaki desktop ke liye antah nirmit or tisare paksh upkaran jo in kamiyon, jaagrukta or upyog ko sambodhit karata he aam taur par kam hote hai
 
 a good example of this is that 55% of capital market professionals do not know how to audit their spreadsheets; Only 6% invest in third party solutions
 "hriday kii vifaltaa" kaa sidhaa sa arth he aapkaa hriday jitna aavashyak he, utane achche tareeke se rakt kii pumping nahin kar rahaa he
 Heart failure does not mean that your heart has stopped functioning or that you are having a heart attack
 hriday kii vifaltaa ko kanjestive heart felyar bhi kaha jaataa he
 "congestive" means the amount of fluid in the body is increasing, because the heart is not pumping properly
 dipawans ek pracheen granth he jisamen shri lanka kaa pracheenatam itihaas varnit he
 'deepavans' is an apostrophe of the 'island dynasty' which means 'history of the island'
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki is granth kaa sankalan atthakatha tathaa anya sroton se teesri-chauthi shatabdi main kiya gaya tha
 Many incidents of ancient history of Sri Lanka and India are recorded from Mahavans and Deepavans itself
 yah keval itihaas kii drushti se hi mahatvapurn nahin he balki yah buddha tathaa pali sahitya kaa mahatvapurn pracheen granth bhi he
 Undoubtedly, Sinhala's "mahavansa" is more revered as a historical epic, but in terms of creation, Deepavans is not only the oldest than Mahavansa and in some respects different from the material used
 george turnar ne kisi samay apana yah mat prakashit kiya tha ki "dipawans" or "mahavans" donon do bhinn rachanaayen na hokar ek hi rachana ke do naam hai
 This is his opinion only
 yadi anuradhapur ke mahavihar ke "aththkatha-mahavans" kaa or dipawans kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaae to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki "dipawans" ke rachayita ne apane granthsampadan ke liye "attakthamhavans" se na keval yathesht saamagree hi lee, balki abhivyakti kii style or kahin-kahin vaakya ke vaakya jyon ke tyon apana liye hai
 Much of "deepavans" is such that it appears not to be an independent composition but a collection of extracts from the Adhakatha-like text or other texts
 yah ek prakaar se sinhal main praapt saamagree kaa kachi pakki pali main anuwaad maatr he
 The period of which the historical account "deepavans" has preserved is parallel to the time of Mahavansa
 donon granth mahasen naresh kii mrityu ke samay hi apane apane varnan kii "iti" karte hai
 One of the major reasons for this similarity is that both texts have selected their original gift material from one place and that site is Mahavihara's "adhakatha Mahavansa"
 " One possible reason for the termination of "deepavans" and "mahavans" on the death of Mahasen Naresh is that Mahavihara's opponents had demolished the Mahavihara after getting Mahasen's permission
 puure nau varsh tak mahavihar mahaviharavasiyon se shunya rahaa
 We cannot take the creation period of Deepavans before AD 302, because it mentions events up to that time
 duusari dhyaan dene laayak baat yah he ki mahaan atthakathacharya buddhaghosh "dipawans" se athwa uske kisi ansh se avashya parichit rahe hai
 Then the Mahasthavir who has taken "mahavansa" forward has also given us information that Dhatusen Naresh had given permission to recite "deepavans" in the festival which was done to show the pride of the idol of Mahasthavir Mahendra
 
 in baton par vichaar karne se ham isi parinaam par pahonchte hai ki dipawans kii rachana chaturth shatabdi ke aarambh or paanchavin shatabdi ke tritiyansh ke pratham bhaag main hui hogi
 As far as the creation period is concerned, the fixed composition of "mahavans" is unknown
 kintu, "dipawans" jahaan kavy kii drushti se ekadam dhyaan na dene laayak lagata he, kahin kahin padya bhi vidyaman he, vahaan "mahavans" ek shreshth mahakavy he
 It is especially noteworthy that just as the Sri Lankan Pali Mahakavis of Sri Lanka kept the tradition of "mahavans" updated, the story of Pandit Ahungall Vimalakitti Mahan Sthavir has just extended the present "deepavanshak Kathak"

 Kumarasambhavaam Mahakavi Kalidasa is an epic related to the birth of Virchita Karthikeya, which is counted in the Sanskrit ‘panch Epics’
 yah mahakavy 17 sargon main samaapt hua he, kintu lok dharna he ki keval pratham sarg hi kalidas rachit he
 The other nine cantos of the latter are the creation of another poet
 kuch logon kii dharna he ki kavy aath sargon main hi shivparvati samagam ke saath kumaar ke janm kii purvasuchana ke saath hi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Some say that Kalidasa got leprosy and could not write due to describing Shivparvati's sexual intercourse in the eighth canto
 ek mat yah bhi he ki unka sambhogvarnan janamanas ko ruchi nahin isliye unhone aage nahin likhaa
 The narrative described in it is summarized as follows - parvataraaj himalay ke mainaak naamak putr or gauri naamak kanya hui
 The girl also became famous by the name Parvati and Uma
 jab kanya hui to ek din uske ghar naarad aae or bhavishyavaanee kii ki kanya kaa vivaah shiv se hoga
 Hearing this prediction, the Himalayas were relieved
 udhar shiv himalay ke shikhar par tap kar rahe the
 The Himalayas sent Uma with a friend to take care of her and Uma began to serve Shiva with devotion
 unheen dinon tarakasur se yuddh main devtaa log parajeet ho gaye
 The monster started committing many kinds of tricks
 tab indra sahit saare devtaa brahri ke paas aae
 Demanded a commander worthy of Tarakasura
 tab brahri ne kaha ki shankar ke veery se utpann purush hi tumhaara yogya senapati ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you people should try and be enamored with Shiva Parvati
 yadi shiv ne parvati ko sweekaar kar liya to parvati se jo putr hoga to uske senapati banane par tumhaari vijay hogi
 Thereafter, Indradi gathered to think of a way to remove the deprivation of Lord Shiva
 jab madan us sabha main aae to indra ne unase annurodh kiya ki ve apane mitra vasant ke saath shiv ke tapasya sthaan par jaayan or shiv ko parvati ke prati aasakt karen
 Accordingly, Madan arrived at Shankar's ashram with his wife Rati and friend Vasant
 jab parvati kamalbies kii maala arpan karne shiv ke nikat pahaunchi or shiv ne use lene ke liye haath badhaaya, tab madan ne apane dhanush par mohanastra chadhaaya
 Immediately Shiva's mind was distracted
 shankar ne is prakaar man ke aksmaat vikrut hone kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye chaaron ore drushti daudai
 He saw Madan doing the grooming
 use dekhte hi shiv aag babula ho gaye; unke tritiy netra se agnijvaala prakat hui or madan usamen bhasma ho gaya
 On seeing her husband devouring like this, Rati started mourning and asked Vasant to prepare a pyre and agreed to give up her own life
 tab akashwani hui ki thodaa sabra karo tumhe tumhaara pati punah praapt hoga
 On the other hand, Shiva entered into an obstacle to avoid feminization
 madan ke bhasma hone or shiv ke antardhan ho jane se parvati ne apana sara manorath vifal hote dekha or yah sochakar ki yah rupasaundarya vyarth he, ve shiv ko prasann karne ke liye ek parvat shikhar par ja kar ugr tap karne lagi
 After sometime, Shiva's mind melted, he thought of accepting Parvati
 kintu isse purv unhone parvati kii pariksha karne kaa nishchay kiya or ve ek tapasvi ke ashram main pahunche
 Parvati received him as a guest
 tadantar us tarun tapasvi ne parvati se jigyaasa kii ki kiski prapti ke liye itani ugr tapasya kar rahi ho
 On hearing the question of the guest, Parvati was ashamed and hesitated to express her feelings, then her sakhi spoke of the desire to attain Shiva
 yah sunakar tapasvi veshdhari shiv, shiv ke durgunon or kurupata aadi kaa ullekh kar unki ninda karne lage
 Parvati did not condemn this Shiva and started scolding her
 tab shiv apane swaroop main prakat hue or unka haath pakad liya
 After that Shiva called Saptarshi and sent it to the Himalayas
 unhone unase jaakar bataaya ki shiv ne parvati kaa panigrahan karne kii ichha prakat kii he
 Then the marriage was decided and preparations for marriage started
 saptamatrikas duulhe ke yogya vastra lekar ai par shiv ne un sab ko sweekaar nahin kiya or nandi par savaar hokar hi chale
 After that, all the marriages took place
 vivaah sampann hone par shiv sahit parvati ne brahri ko pranaam kiya
 Brahma blessed
 tumhen vir putr ho
 The Apsaras came and presented a play in front of the bride and groom
 naatak samaapt hone ke baad indra ne shiv se madan ko jivit karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Finally the solitary union of Shiva and Parvati is discussed in detail
 is mahakavy main anek sthalon par smaraneey or manoram varnan hua he
 The Himalayavarnas, the penance of Parvati, Shivninda of Brahmachari, the arrival of spring, the marriage of Shivparvati and the description of Rathikriya produce wonderful sensations
 kalidas kaa bala parvati, tapaswini parvati, vinayavati parvati or pragalbh parvati aadi roopon nari kaa chithran adbhut he

 usne chikitsa vigyaan main bhi degree praapt kii thi tathaa jeevigyaan main atyant paarangat tha
 The name of Hermann Latse is very famous among German philosophers after Hegel
 uske chikitsakeey adhyayan vaigyanik manovigyaan ke kshetra main agraganya the
 Latse was born to a doctor in Bougain, Saxony, Germany
 vidhyaarthee kaal main usne vigyaan or saundarya shaastra kaa bishesh adhyayan kiya or is adhyayan ne uske darshanik drushtikon ko nirnit kiya
 He accepted facts, rules and values as part of power
 vigyaan main vah anubhavvaadi tha; darshan main prayojanparak pratywadee tha or dharm main ishwarwadi
 According to him, the world is the field of facts; Whatever happens in it is subject to the rule and is for the purpose of production and protection of values

 What is the meaning of the existence of an object? George Berkeley said that the existence of an object is to be known
 lotse ke anusaar kisi vastu kaa astitv uskaa anya vastuon ke saath sambhddha hona he
 Two relations are prominent: the causal-causal relationship in events and the reciprocal connection in organisms
 yah sambandh vidyaman to hai, parantu vivechan ke liye samasya yah he ki koi do pruthak padaarth ek duusare par prabhaav daal kaise sakate hai
 Lautse says that matter is not separate from each other - all these are just the same entity, God
 kriya-pratikriya yaa jeevon ke sansarg main hota yahi he ki ishwar main koi parivartan hota he or uskaa pratifal koi doosraa parivartan prakat ho jaataa he
 In philosophical discourse, Lötse was anist, but when he considers policy and religion, he supports God and many living beings
 hegal or uske anuyaayi anya vastuon kii tarah jeevon ko bhi abhasamaatr maanate the; latse jeevon ko swadhin karta maanata he
 With this, he sees the absolute as male special
 vah kahata he ki satta main moulik tatv mulya he or mulyon main sarvottam mulya atmachetana he
 This self-consciousness is fully present in God; It looks incomplete in organisms
 lotse ekwad or anekavaad main chun nahin sakaa - darshanik vivechan ne use ekwad kii ore khinchaa, naitik vichaar ne anekavaad kii ore khinchaa

 abbaas ko shiya musalamaanon dwaara unke bhai hazarat hossain, ke parivaar ke prati sammaan or karbala kii ladaai main unki bhoomika ke prati sammaan ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he
 Hazrat Abbas was buried at the Roza of Hazrat Abbas in Karbala, Karbala Province, Iraq, where he was martyred during the Battle of Karbala on Ashura
 
 Hazrat Abbas Hazrat Ali ibn Abi Talib was the son
 abbaas ke teen bhai the - abdulla ebn ali, jafar ebn ali, or osman ebn ali
 Abbas married Lubaba
 unke teen bete the - fadal ebn abbaas, mohammad ebn abbaas, or ubydulla ebn abbaas
 One of the main conflicts in 657 AD was between Abbas' father Hazrat Ali and Mu'awiyah I, the governor of Syria, Hazrat Abbas started as a soldier in the Battle of Siffin
 apane pita ke kapade pahane hue, jo ek mahaan yoddha hone ke liye jane jate the, abbaas ne kai dushman sainikon ko maar daalaa
 Muawiya's army actually mistook him for Ali
 isliye, jab hazarat ali khud yuddh ke maidan par dikhaai die, to muavia ke sainik use dekhakar aashcharyachakit hue or duusare sainik kii pahchaan ke bare main uljhan main the
 Ali then introduced Abbas as saying: vah abbaas he, hashimiyon kaa chandramaa he
 
 hazrat abbaas ko apane pita ali dwaara yuddh kii kala main prashikshit kiya gaya tha, jo mukhya kaaran tha ki vah yuddh ke maidan par apane pita jaisaa dikhataa the
 Hazrat Abbas showed his loyalty to Hazrat Hussain at the Battle of Karbala
 lekin muavia ko khalipha ke rup main safal hone ke baad, atyaachaari yajid ne ninda kii ki hazarat hossain ne unke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya he, lekin hazarat hossain ne isse inkaar kar diya, Yazid is an alcoholic, a womanizer unfit for leadership
 chunki ye vyavhaar islam main nishiddh the, yadi hazrat hossain ne yajid ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya tha, to unke is kaary se islam kii moolbhoot baaten barbaad kar di hongi
 An agreement was reached by Hazrat's elder brother Hazrat Imam Hasan, that he would be responsible for religious decisions and would not interfere in other matters
 lekin yaazid dharmik aadhikaar niyantran lenaa chahta tha
 With the help of Ubaid Allah, Yazid conspired to kill Hazrat Hussain by sending him a letter in the name of the people of Kusa
 haalanki adhikansh itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki patr vastav main kupha ke logon dwaara bheje gaye the, jinhone baad main unase dhokhaa diya jab muslim ebn akel ke sharir ko yajid kii sena dwaara kupha ke centre main ek imaarat se phenk diya gaya tha, jabaki kupha ke log chup khadey rahe the
 60 In Hijri, Hazrat Hussain left Medina for Mecca with a small group of companions and family members to travel to Kufa
 unhone apane chachere bhai, hazrat muslim ko salaah ke baad apana nirnay lene ke liye bheja
 But, by the time Hazrat Hussain reached Kufa, his cousin was murdered
 jis tarah se hazrat hossain or uske samooh ko roak diya gaya tha
 Hazrat Abbas was given a horse named "ukb"
 
 shiya sutron kaa kahana he ki is ghode kaa istemaal hazarat mohammad sahaab or hazarat ali ne kiya tha or yah ghoda abdul mutalib ke madhyam se yaman ke raja saf ebn zee yaazani dwaara mohammad ko prastut kiya gaya tha
 The king considered the horse very important, and its superiority over other horses was evident from the fact that its genealogical tree was also maintained

 ek muslim bahul praant kaa srijan karne ke uddeshy se hi bharat ke bengal ko do bhaagon main baant diye jane kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 The partition came into effect from 16 October 1905 
 itihaas main ise bangbhang ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It was a part of the British "divide - rule" policy
 at: iske virodh main 1908 i
 main sampoorn desh main `bang-bhang' aandolan shuru ho gaya
 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division
 bengal praant kaa kshetrafal 489,500 varg kilometre or jansankhya 8 karod se zyada thi
 East Bengal was geographically and almost isolated from West Bengal due to less communication means
 1836 main, upree praanton ko ek leftinent governor ke shashan ke antargat kar diya gaya or 1854 main governor general-in-council ko bengal ke pratyaksh prashasan se mukt kar diya gaya
 Assam was separated from Bengal, including Sylhet, in 1874 to form a separate chief-commissioner, and later in 1898 Lushai Hills was also included
 bengal jaise bade or itani adhik aabaadi vaale praant kaa prabandhan bahut kathin tha
 The partition of Bengal was first thought in 1903
 chittagong tathaa dhaka or maimansingh ke jilon ko bengal se alag kar assam praant main milaane ke atirikt prastaav bhi rakhe gaye the
 Similarly, Chota Nagpur was also to be merged with the Central Province
 san 1903 main hi congress kaa bhi 19vaan adhiveshan madras main hua tha
 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported imminent mutilation on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Henry John Stedman Cotton, who was Chief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, opposed the idea
 congress ke agle adhiveshan main sabhapati pad se bolte hue sar henry coton ne bhi yah kaha ki yadi yah bahaanaa he ki itane bade praant ko ek rajyapal sanbhaal nahin saktaa to yaa to bombai or madras kii tarah bengal kaa shashansutra saprishad rajyapal ke sipurd ho yaa banglaa bhashiyon ko alag karke ek praant banaaya jaae
 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa
 par british sarkaar ne na to congress kii parvaah kii, na janamat kii
 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit
 vah swayan purv bengal main bhi gaye, par mutthi bhar musalamaanon ke atirikt kisi ne is prastaav kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge
 1905 main 16 oktober ko bharat ke tatkaaleen waisarai lard karjan dwaara bengal kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France
 aisa sochaa gaya ki purvi kshetra upekshit or uchit rup se shasit nahin tha
 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal
 prabal saarvajanik virodh ke baavjood 20 july 1905 ko vangbhang ke prastaav par bharat sachiv kaa thappa lag gaya
 The Rajshahi, Dhaka and Chittagong Commissioners were merged with Assam to form a province, which was named as Poorvang and Assam, and the rest, ie Presidency and Vardhaman Commissioners, Bihar, Udha and some base
 is avasar par hinduon or musalamaanon ko yah kahkar ladaane kii cheshtaa kii gai ki is vibhaajan se musalamaanon ko phayda he kyonki purvavang or assam main unheen kaa bahumat rahegaa
 The Nawab of Dhaka had earlier protested, but he became in his favor when he became disenchanted
 sar jojeff bamfield fuller purvavang or assam ke nae leftinant governor bane
 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites
 is kathan kaa aashay spasht tha
 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin
 The new province included the hill states of Tripura, Chittagang Mandal, Dhaka and Rajshahi and the Malda district was merged into Assam province
 bengal ko na keval in bade purvi pradeshon ko chhodana padaa, balki paanch hindi bhashi rajyon ko bhi madhya praant ke liye ganvaana padaa tha
 On the west side, it was awarded Sambalpur and five small Oriya-speaking states from the Central Province
 bengal ke paas141,580 varg mile kshetrafal or paanch karod chalis lakh kii jansankhya hi bachi thi, jisamen chaar karod bees lakh hindu or nabbe lakh muslim the
 The new province was named East Bengal and Assam respectively, with Dhaka, the capital of East Bengal, and Chittagong, the subordinate headquarters of Assam
 iskaa kshetrafal 106,540 varg mile tha or jansankhya teen karod das lakh thi, jisame ek karod assi lakh muslim or ek karod bees lakh hindu the
 There was a Legislative Council and a two-member Revenue Board for administration and the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court was not changed
 sarkaar ne ingit kiya ki purvi bengal or assam ke bich ek sahi dhang se nirdhaarit pashchimi seemaa hogi or suparibhaashit bhugolic, nrikul vigyaani, bhashiya evam saamaajik visheshtaayen hongi
 The Government of India publicized its final decision with the accepted resolution of 19 July 1905 and the partition of Bengal came into force from 16 October of the same year
 1911 main radd kiye jane se purv, vibhaajan bamushkil aadhe dashak tak chal paaya tha
 However, the UK policy behind Partition was Divide et Impera, which continued to influence the reorganized province
 1919 main, musalamaanon or hinduon ke liye alag-alag chunaav vyavastha sthapit kii gayi
 Prior to this, many members of both communities advocated national unity for all Bengalis
 ab, alag-alag samudaayon ne apane-apane rajnatik mudde viksit kar liye
 Muslims also dominated the Legislature on the strength of their overall numerical strength, which ranged between two crore twenty lakh and two crore eight million

 Muslims now wanted to make the entire province a part of the Muslim state, Pakistan
 1947 main bengal duusari baar, is baar dharmik aadhaar par, vibhajit hua
 It became East Pakistan
 haalaanki, 1971 main pashchimi pakistani sainya shashan ke saath ek safal mukti yuddh ke baad purvi pakistan bangladesh naam kaa swatantra rajya ban gaya
 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal
 isane ek bada raajnneetik sankat paidaa kiya
 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time
 bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara kiye gaye virodh kaa netritv sar henry jon stedman coton ne kiya jo purv main assam ke mukhya ayukta the, parantu karzan adig rahe
 Later, Cotton, now a liberal MP from East Nottingham, successfully campaigned for the removal of Sir Bemfield Fuller, the first lieutenant-governor of East Bengal

 An electric generator is a device used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
 iske liye yah praayah maikel farade ke vidyutchumbakeey preran ke siddhanth kaa prayog karti he
 The electric motor, in contrast, works by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
 vidyut motor evam vidyut janitr main bout kuch samaan hota he or kai baar ek hi mashin bina kisi parivartan ke dono kii tarah kaary kar sakati he
 The electric generator forces the electric charge to flow through an external circuit
 lekin yah aavesh kaa srijan nahin karata
 It is like a water pump which works only to make water flow, not to produce water
 vidyut janitr dwaara vidyut utpaadan ke liye aavashyak he ki janitr ke roter ko kisi bahari shakti-sreet kii sahaayta se ghumaya jaay
 For this, the use of reciprocating engine, turbine, steam engine, water falling on a turbine or water cycle, an inlay engine, wind turbine or man or animal power can be used
 kisi bhi strot se kii gai yantric urja ko vidyut urja main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 This energy can be obtained from the falling water of a waterfall or by the heat generated by burning coal, or from a petrol or diesel engine
 urja ke nae nae strot upyog main laae ja rahe hai
 Primarily, nuclear power has also been used extensively for electrification in the last few years and nuclear power-powered power stations have been built in many countries
 jowar bhaaton evam jwalamukhiyon main nihit aseem urja kaa upyog bhi vidyutsakti ke janan ke liye kiya gaya he
 The use of all these power tools to produce electric power is achieved only by giant electric generators, which is basically based on Faraday's' magnetic field on the conductivity principle of conductivity
 farrade kaa yah siddhant nimnlikhit rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Thus, three main things are required for the generation of electric power: 1
 chumbakeey kshetra, jisamen chaalak ghumaya jaae, 2
 Driver and 3
 chaalak ko chumbakeey kshetra main ghumaanevaali yantric shakti
 It is also clear that to make the production of electric power practical, the driver induced VVB
 The amount should be sufficient
 isaki maatra, chaalak kii lambaai, chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata or chaalak ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 In fact it can be expressed by the following equation: jahaan, E= vidyutvahak bal, B=chumbakeey abhivah kaa ghanatv, l =chaalak kii lambaai tathaa v=chaalak kaa veg This makes it clear that in practice both the length and velocity of the conductor must be very high and the magnetic flux density should also be maximum
 chumbakeey kshetra kii adhiktam ho
 The maximum limit of a magnetic field is determined by its saturation
 chaalak kii lambaai badhanaa bhi vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin, parantu ek se adhik chaalak ko is prakaar samyojit kiya ja saktaa he ki unamem prerit vi
vaa
ba
 judakar vyaavhaarik ban jaae
 In fact, the generator consists of a system of conductors in place of a conductor, which are connected to each other according to a set scheme
 in chaalkon ko dhaaran karanevaala bhaag armechar kehalaata he or inaki sangyojan vidhi ko armechar kundalan kehete hai
 As the velocity is high, the centrifugal force on the rotating conductors becomes very high, which may cause their arrangement on the armature to be disturbed
 at: inhen armechar par bane khaanpon main rakhaa jaataa he
 The armature holds the drivers and rotates them, for which its shaft is coupled to the shaft of the mechanical energy feeder
 yah yantra pani se chaalanevaala tarabine, yaa bhaap se chaalanevaala tarabine yaa ingine, ho saktaa he
 The available mechanical energy in any form can be used to rotate the shaft of the armature
 is prakaar vibhinn prakaar ke yantra janitr ko chalaane ke liye prayukt kiye jate hai
 These are called prime drivers
 vibhinn prakaar ke ingine, jaise vaashp ingine, dijal ingine, petrol ingine, gas tarabine ityadi mashine, pradhan chaalak ke rup main prayukt kii jaati hai or inaki yantric urja ko janitr dwaara vidyut urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 The armature is made of magnetic material, allowing it to carry a magnetic field
 saamanyat: yah ek vishesh prakaar ke ispaat kaa bana hota he, jise armechar ispaat hi kehete hai
 Electricity is also used practically to generate magnetic fields, because it can generate magnetic fields of far greater intensity than permanent magnets, and the field can be moved easily by varying the field current
 is prakaar janit voltata kaa niyantran saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Fields are magnets to generate magnetic fields, on which the field coil turns
 in kundaliyon main dhara ke pravaah se chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti hoti he
 For a single sphere, the field magnets are shaped somewhat, and the armature rotates between them

 Current flow in the field coil is called excitation
 yah uttejan kisi bahari strot se sanyojit karne par kiya ja saktaa he athwa swayan usee janitr main utpann honevaali dhara kaa hi ek ansh uttejan ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 a generator that is excited from an external source is called an external excited generator and a generator that uses part of the current generated in the same generator itself is called an automatic excited generator
 swat: uttejan kii pranaliyaan bhi kshetra kundali or armechar ke sayojanon ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti hai
 If the fields are connected to the coil armature in the range, it is called the range generator
 yadi donon main parshv sambandhan ho, to use shant janitr kehete hai
 If some spheres in the field of the field are related to the armature and some lateral to it, then such a generator is called a joint generator
 uttejan kii in vibhinn vidhiyon se vibhinn lakshan praapt hote hai
 The field current in the external excited generator does not depend on the armature current or the load current
 at: usamen janit voltata bhaar vicharan se swatantra hoti he
 If the field current is kept the same and the voltage generated in the generator will also remain the same
 shant janitr main bhi lagbhag aisa hi lakshan praapt hota he or bhaar vicharan kaa prabhaav janit voltata par adhik nahin hota
 In the range generator, the load current flows in the armature and field coils
 at:, yah kshetradhara bhaar par nirbhar karti he or is prakaar janit voltata bhaar badhane ke saath badhati jaati hai
 Combined generators have characteristics between shunt and range generators
 kshetra kundali ke shant or shrenee varton kaa vyavasthaapan kar unke bich kaa koi bhi lakshan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In practice only joint generators are used more
 chumbakeey kshetra main ekasmaan veg se ghoomanevaale chaalak main janit voltata, chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ko kaatane kii gati par nirbhar karti he
 This speed, in fact, depends on the position relative to the magnetic conductance of the conductor at any given moment
 jab chaalak ekasmaan veg se gum rahaa ho, to vah ek chakkar main do baar abhivah ke lambavat hoga or is sthiti main vah adhiktam abhivah kaatega, tathaa jab vah koi bhi abhivah nahin kaatega, do baar uske samaantar hoga
 Thus the voltage generated in a circle twice will vary between zero and maximum, as shown in Figure 3

 is prakaar ke vicharan ko prayavarti vicharan kehete hai
 a similar alternating voltage is produced in armature drivers, and a dichotomy is used to direct it
 dikparivartak armechar ke shaft par hi aropit hota he
 There are many copper blocks in it, which are insulated from each other
 armechar ke vartan ke antyasangyojan in khandon se sanyojit hote hai
 There are two burruses connecting with the transformer, which connect the current flowing through the voltage generated in the armature to the external circuit
 armechar chaalkon kaa dikparivartak se sangyojan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki donon burushon dwaara ikatthi kii janevaali dhara ek hi disha kii hoti he
 Thus one Burush collects positive current and the other one negative
 is aadhaar par burushon ko bhi dhanatmak evam rinatmak kaha jaataa he
 In fact, Burush is the terminal of the electric current, which relates the load to the generator
 ye burushdharak par aropit hote hai or dikpavirthak par inaki sthiti burush dharak dwaara vyavasthaapit kii ja sakati he

 yah kalpana karnaa aavashyak nahin he ki koi yugal saadhy falan ke ek sankhyatmak maan ko nirdhaarit karata he; parantu yadi koi sankhyatmak sambhavyata he, to usko nimnlikhit chaar abhidhaaran ko santusht karnaa chahie : a / h 3 0; h / h = 1 a / h + / h = 1 Principal of complementarity; And / h=a / h ́ b / , vyapak gunan mooldhan
 The first, second and third assumptions indicate that the entire probability name is located in the interval 0 to 1, when it is assumed that both 0 and 1 are included in the interval
 chaturth kii sahaayta dwaara tritiy se vyapak yoga siddhant / h = a / h + b / h - / h ko siddh kar sakate hai
 If a and b are interceptive options, the probability of their joint occurrence is zero
 is bhanti paraspar nivarak a or b ke liye / h = a / h + b / h
 isko vishesh yoga siddhant kehete hai
 If a / h = n / , then we say that a is independent of b
 kalan ke aage ke vikaas ke liye swatantraaa kii kalpana ati mahatvapurn he
 The definition of fourth concept and independence proves that parity for independent a and b / h=a / h ́b / h true
 isko vishesh gunan siddhant kehete hai
 In cosmic language the probability of a specified h is the relative frequency with which event a occurs, while the restrictions h are fulfilled
 duusare shabdon main kisi nirdisht h kii sambhavyata un h kii saadhy he, jo a kii hai
 This principle can be explained in the simplest way as follows: ham h kaa vaikalpik pratibandh kii sankhya n main vishleshan karte hai
 h becomes perfect, meaning that either h1 or xxrep 4 
 or hn becomes perfect
 isamen se kuch vikalp, mana m, a kii ghatana kaa anukram bandhan karte hai
 The remainder binds the sequence of events of -a minus
 ek parsparik shabdaawalee ke aadhaar par ham vikalp ke pratham varg ko a kaa anukool or dwitiya ko a kaa pratikul kehete hai
 The probability ratio to a given h is m: n, that is, the ratio of the number of favorable choices to the number of all alternatives
 kisi saadhy ke liye satya vikalp ko paraas kahana swaabhaavik hi he
 The aforementioned everlasting definition can now be broadened as follows
 kisi nirdisht h kii sambhavyata h- or -a ke parags kii maap or keval h ke parags kaa maap kaa anupaat he; arthath The main difficulty in the range theory of probability is due to measurement of the range
 yah kathinaayee is prashn ke saath sanshrit he ki kis prakaar se saadhy kaa vikalp main vishleshan kiya jaae
 Generally, there are many possibilities of analysis in the choice of measurement and choice of data
 anadhimaan ke siddhant kii chirpratishthit paraas paribhaasha ke, jiskaa aavashyak poorak yah parampara se samajha jaataa rahaa he, sambandh main vyakhya kii gai he
 Both Vernouli and Laplace were of the view that each event has a sufficient cause, about which we may be ignorant
 prakruti kii anirdhaarit nahin apitu manushya kii agyanta sambhavyata ko mukhya kamaani he
 This is why Bernoulli called probability a measure of confidence
 iskaa manovaigyanik athwa vyaktinishth aashay he, jiske kaaran vishay main sambhranti adhik maatra main ai
 This suggests that theories of probability are mathematic rules related to psychological facts, that is, the type in which man 'distributes' his predictable event of belief
 saapeksh barambharataa ke rup main sambhavyata kii paribhaasha spasht rup se vastunishth he
 Similarly, the definition of probability as a relative measure is objective, if it does not direct the direction of measurement method knowledge, like the established principle of indifference
 kalpana karen ki h ke kisi avasar par ghatit ghatana a kii sambhavyata h ke purv avasar par ghatit hone vaa na hone se aprabhavit rahati he, arthath a kii ghatana ek duusare kii sambhavyata se swatantra he
 Imagine that the probability is p
 vishesh gunan tathaa yogafal ke siddhant kaa prayog h ke n avasar par ghatana a ke antaraal p ± e main, kisi saapeksh barambharataa ke saath anubhav hone ke sambhavyataganan me, kar sakate hai
 From the result of this second probability, we can prove that: n avasaron par ghatna kii saapeksh barbartaa kaa adhiktam sambhavya maan vah maan he, jo uski sambhavyata p ke nikatatam he
 The relative frequency of an event on n occasions is its probability of a number of से from p, no matter how small, the probability of a deviation of less than the quantity is 1, when n is randomly increased
 is bhanti, loukik bhashaa main, ant main ghatana uski sambhavyata kii saapeksh barambartaa ke saath lagbhag nishchit rup se anubhav hogi
 The asymptotic property of the increasing probability can be explained by the following example: kisi sikke ko upar phenkane par chitt or pat kii sambhavyata 1 / 2 he
 The result is independent of probability: no accumulation of mind and septum obtained in a previous throw will affect the probability of having a mind or septum the next time it is thrown
 is mahatvapurn prameya ko vernuli kaa prameya kehete hai
 As a matter of fact, it is the first member of the proviso of the class which is called the law of large numbers
 is naam kaa sarvapratham prayog pason ne 1830 i
 main kiya
 In 1763, Tomas Waze proved that if n is the relative frequency m: n of an event on an independent occasion, then the maximum probability of the probability of the event will also be m: n, if any value of this probability is as probable as Any other value
 1774 i
 main laplus ne bhi is prameya ko swatantra rup se siddh kiya tha
 Laplace also proved that if the imagery described is true, it will eventually become almost certain that probability has its own relative frequency
 beze-laplas prameya bernuli ke prameya kaa pratilom he or barambharataa ke aadhaar par sambhavyata-prakkalan kii pratilom sambhavyata ke chirpratishthit siddhant kaa madhya prastar he
 Laplace and his followers developed this theory and used it in many experiments
 pratilom sambhavyata kii ekiliz edi purvagrihit sambhavyata par uski nirbharta he
 Inverse probability is still a controversial subject
 aar
e
 fisher aadi shodhakartaaon ne isko purnataya asweekrut kar diya he
 In the past, it has often been predicted that due to Bernoulli's theorem, event probability will eventually occur in a proportional number, but this is a serious error
 prameya keval yah kahata he ki barambharataa kii sambhavyata se sampaat kii sambhaavna adhikadhik ho jaati he or yah, apane aapse, ant main bhi vaastavik barambharataa ke vishay main kisi nishkarsh kaa samaashwaasan nahin detaa
 The Bernoulli theorem of the subjective concept of the fixed probability probability of error hidden in this hypothesis combines with the objective concept in terms of frequency
 ise sarvapratham aar
 lesuli elice ne 1843 i
 main samajha tathaa nirnaayak rup se isaki samalochna kii
 Nevertheless, there is another method for using Bernoulli's theorem and other asymptotic theories of probability to combine numerical frequencies with probability without logical error
 isko nimnlikhit rup main abhivyakt kar sakate hai : Imagine that we hypothesize the probability of an h from the observation of frequency, or from the returns of the range, or from some other source
 is pariklpana se ham pariklan karte hai ki yah lagbhag, athwa bernuli ke shabdon main naitik rup se, nishchit he ki n pareekshan kii shrenee main ghatana kii saapeksh barambharataa apni sambhavyata se ek bhinn se kam se vichlit hogi he
 Now we can take the fact for ourselves that most unlikely events are almost excluded or that moral destiny should be treated like absolute destiny
 is swayan tathy kaa vastav main bernuli ne suzav diya tha or is kaaran isko benunli ke drudh nishchay kaa naitik siddhant kah sakate hai
 Its adoption seems to be well entrenched with the actual use of probability calculation in scientific and applied purposes
 yadi prekshit barambharataa naitik drudh nishchay ke siddhant ke virodh main ho, to pariklpana main sanshodhan kar dete hai, athwa uski asweekrut kar dete hai
 In fact, the limit of moral determination is value-neutral and its provisional fixation on any one, or other value, will depend on the set of conditions specific to each situation
 in paristhitiyon kaa vishleshan evam moolyankan sankhyikeey siddhant kaa vrihat kaary he
 Does probability have one or more meanings? Compare the following uses of probability: ek saamaanya chah pakshavale thappe ke 'chathe' paksh ke upar aane kii sambhavyata 1 / 6 he
 The probability that Shakespeare himself wrote the play, which is written by him, is very high
 frenel ke prayogon ne prakaash ke urmil siddhant kii sambhavyata main briddhi kar di
 Do the probability of the three statements have the same meaning? barambharataa siddhant kaa vartmaan kaal kaa mukhya prastaav karanevaale, hens rakenbek, ke anusaar sambhavyata kaa keval vaigyanik arth he
 The statement of the form of the aforesaid second example, which is related to an individual event, is literally meaningless, but in a similar situation can usually be reinterpreted as a statement of condition
 tritiy prakaar ke kathan ko, jo sambhavyata kaa saamaanya saadhy se sambandh lagaataa he, yaa to safal bhavishyakathan ke anupaat ko, athwa ek varg main satya siddhant ke anupaat ko, nirdesh karanevaali barambharataa kii vyakhya di ja sakati he
 Jm Kenge also took a monotonous form of probability, albeit on a vastly different basis
 kange ke anusaar, purvokt dwitiya or tritiy udhaaharan ke rup ke kathan ke dwaara prastut kathinaayee nidarshit karti he ki sambhavyata kii kalpana barambharataa siddhant kii, athwa kisi anya siddhant jiske anusaar sambhavyata kii maap raashi hona aavashyak he, sankalpana se adhik nyaapak he
 Broadly, probability is a fraction of rational belief
 jinhone sambhavyata ke dohare arth kii vakaalat kii he, unhone aisa saadhaarant: tritiy prakaar kii sthiti, athwa prakruti ke niyam kii sambhavyata tathaa anya prakaar kii sambhavyata, main vishmata dikhaane kii ichha se kiya he
 Jacob Freedish Frees called 'probability of rule' a philosophical probability to distinguish it from 'mathematical probability'
 yah bhed 19veen sadi ke anek tarkikon evam darshanikon ne apanaaya
 'philosophical probability' was theoretically considered uncountable
 rudolf karnaap ne kuch bhinn prakaar kii sambhavyata ke dohare arth kaa vikaas kiya
 The first of the two hypotheses of probability is the probability of the sense of the range theory
 donon sankalpana ganatiya hai or amoort kalan kii vaikalpik vyakhya samajhi ja sakati hai
 Carnap set appropriate areas of application of both concepts of probability to address the opposing claims of both theories
 to bhi kathinaayee kii drushti se, jo donon siddhanton ko sambhavyata ke prastaavit vishleshan main uthaani padati he, yah satya nahin samajha ja saktaa ki samaadhaan purnataya santoshjanak he

 This new branch of physics has given a new and revolutionary twist to the scientific ideology and social science and philosophy have also been significantly affected by it
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 The word Jataka is made of mass metal
 iskaa arth he bhoot athwa bhav
 This word is formed by adding the suffix 'kat' to the 'jan' metal
 dhaatu ko bhoot arth main prayukt karte hue jab arth kiya jaataa he to jatbhoot katha evam rup banataa he
 jat-jani-janan-janam meaning is used when used in the Bhava sense
 is tarah ‘jataka’ shabd kaa a rth he, ‘jaat’ arthath janm-sambandhin
 'jataka' is the stories related to the pre-birth of Lord Buddha
 buddhatv praapt kar lene kii avasthaa se purv bhagavan buddha bodhisattva kehalaate hai
 They are candidates for enlightenment at that time and practice the ten perfections or perfections of charity, piety, friendship, truth, etc

 In this way, they perform the ability of intelligence
 bodhisattva shabd kaa arth hi he bodhi ke liye udyogshil praani
 For Bodhi, Sattva, which is also said by some scholars
 pali sutton main ham anek baar padhate hai, ‘‘sambodhi praapt hone se pehle, buddha na hone ke samay, jab main bodhisattva hi tha‘‘ aadi
 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ‘‘pannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo ‘jataka’ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh but it does not seem to be right
 sambhavtah ve chaturth shatabdi isvi ke kavi the
 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE
 isamen se kuch pali jataka ke samaan hai or ku chha aisi bhi hai, jo pali jataka main nahin pai jaati
 Raees Davids states that the collection and execution of the Jataka took place on the basis of ancient folklore in the middle country
 vinternitj ne bhi praayah isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 Most of the people are Buddhakalins
 sanchi or bharhut ke s tupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par unke drishyon kaa ankit hona unke purv ashokakaleen hone kaa paryaapt sakshya detaa he
 In relation to the time and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the past is linked with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter who hunted from the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 Jatakathakatha's Nidan Katha tells about three Nidas of Buddha life, Dure Nidan is the story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part under Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the plot is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All of this leads to the conclusion that the Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant
