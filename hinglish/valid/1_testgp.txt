 1933 main adolf hitler germany kii satta main aayaa or usne ek naslvaadi samrajya kii sthapana kii, jisamen yahudiyon ko sab-human qaraar diya gaya or unhen insaani nasl kaa hissaa nahin mana gaya
 In 1939, after Germany incited World War, Hitler began to implement his final solution to eradicate the Jews
 uske sainik yahudiyon ko kuch khaas ilaakon main thunsane lage
 Special camps were set up to get them working, to gather and kill them at one place, the most notorious being Auschwitz
 yahudiyon ko in shiviron main laayaa jaataa or vahaan band kamaron main jahrili gas chhodkar unhen maar daalaa jaataa

 The central belief of the system they were tied to was that the Jewish people represent everything that is against the Germans and therefore the Jews should be exterminated
 yah dharna duniya ko dekhne ke ek nasli nazariye se bhi judi thi, jo germanon ko master res kaa hissaa maanati thi or yahudiyon ko vinaashkari bhautik gunon vaale anti res kaa
 When the geographical elimination of the Jews could not be possible, then they took the most radical route, which was the final solution
 itihaas main is tarah kii or bhi ghatnaayen milti hai, lekin holocost kii kuch baaten use vilakshan banaati hai
 Apart from Nazi Germany, many governments have resorted to camp systems and technology, and Jews have been murdered for much of history
 lekin do mukhya vajahon se holocost ko sabase alag kaha ja saktaa he
 1
 Apart from their policies towards other groups, the Nazis undertook to kill every Jew
 iske liye unhone umr, ling, aasthaa yaa kaam kii parvaah nahin kii
 He especially used a modern bureaucracy to accomplish this objective

 Uddālaka was one of the greatest philosophers of the Upanishad era
 ye gautam gotreey aruni rishi ke putr the or isiilie 'aaruni' ke naam se vishesh prakhyat hai
 In the Mahabharata, he has been described as a disciple of the sage Dhaumya and an ideal disciple for his singular gurus service
 
 It is generally believed that the Greek Saint Thales was the pioneer of science
 kintu prasiddh itihaaskaar debiprasad chattopadhyaay ne siddh kiya he ki vastav main thels nahin balki uddalak pratham chintak the jinhone gyaan prapti ke liye prayog kii aavashyaktaa kaa pratipaadan kiya tha
 Many students lived in Rishi Dhaumya's ashram
 vah unhen puri tatparta se padhaate, saath hi unki kadi pariksha bhi lete rahete the
 In these exams, different criteria were set and it would be seen how loyal the student was to the learning and master
 ek din musaladhar varsha ho rahi thi
 The Guru told one of his students Aruni, 'son! The water is being drained out due to the breaking of the ridge of the field, so go and tie the weir
 ' aaruni tatkaal uth khadaa hua or khet kii ore chal diya
 The flow of water was fast
 aaruni ne mitti jamaane kii koshish kii par bahaav rukaa nahin
 Seeing no solution, Aruni lay down at that place
 is prakaar usne pani ko roak diya magar bahaav or varsha ke veg se vah behosh ho gaya
 Even after many nights passed, when he did not return, Dhaomya was worried
 vah khet par use dhundne pahunche
 On seeing it, Aruni stopped the water and lay near the ridge
 dekhte hi guruji bhavvibhor ho gaye
 a detailed discussion of the spiritual ideas of Aruni has been done in a very interesting way in the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads
 tatvavettaon ke itihaas main aaruni kaa pad yajyavlky ke hi samakaksh mana jaataa he jo inke shishy hone ke atirikt upanishatkaaleen darshanikon main ni:sanshay sarvshereshth maane jate hai
 Regarding psychological facts, Aruni believes that for the main purpose of sleep is 'labor', and in the state of sleep, the organism takes on communion with the soul
 mrityukalin chetana ke vishay main aaruni kaa kathan he ki jab manushya marataa he, tab uski vaakman main antarleen ho jaati he; ananthar man praan main, praan tej main tathaa ant main tej devtaa main antarleen ho jaataa he 
 Yajnavalkya has taken this theory from here and has elaborated it
 tatvagyan ke vishay main aaruni ke siddhant ko ham 'pratyayvaadee' addhait kaa naam de sakate hai, kyonki inaki drushti main advait hi ekmaatr sat tathaa tathy he
 The theory of Aruni is the connotation of metaphysical sentence, which he explained and proved by his son Shvetketu through many entertaining illustrations
 'idan sarv tat satyam sa aatma tatvamasi shwethaketo'-aaruni ke advaitvaad kaa yah mahneey mantra he 
 The basic element is the 'sat' form, not the non-discrete form, because there can be no origin of any kind from discrete
 yah sat apane main se pehle agni ko, peeche jal ko tathaa ant main prithvi ko isi kram se utpann karata he
 This 'trinity' element of the universe is the self-realized principle of Aruni
 vishwa ke prayek dravya main ye teenon tatv vidyaman rahete hai
 All substances are immaterial
 padaarthon apeksha tatwon kii satyata sarvatha maanya he or in tatwon kii apeksha satyatar he vah sat jo inkaa mul kaaran he 
 It is an astral and base microcosm in all systems of the world
 iskaa purna gyaan acharya ke dwaara di gai shiksha ke dwaara or shraddha ke dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 'acharyavan Purusho Veda' = Only the man who is assigned by the Guru knows the ultimate element; This sermon of Aruni is the cornerstone of gurutva
 aatma vishwa ke prayek padaarth main usee prakaar vyaapt rahata he, jis prakaar us jal ke prayek kan main lavan vyaapt rahata he jisamen vah daalaa jaataa he 
 This spiritual vision of Uddālaka Aruni is a complete reflection of the monotony and comprehensiveness of the soul

 yahan ke nivaasiyon ne 1857 ke viplav main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Chief revolutionaries among them were - Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan
 britaniyon ke viruddh kranti main sanlagn hone ke kaaran choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan ko unke samarthakon ke saath mrityudand diya gaya
 But the residents of Hapur still remember their martyrdom
 hapur main 1857 main shahid hone vaale krantikariyon kii yaad main 1975 i
 se prativarsh shahid meley kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Which starts from May 10 and lasts for a month
 sampoorn desh main 1857 se sambaddh is prakaar ke meley kaa aayojan anyatra kahin nahi kiya jaataa
 Chaudhary Jatir Khan's family was originally from the village of Asauda, who, due to their zamindari, later resided in Hapur's Muhalla Bhanda Patti
 choudhary jabardast khan, samast khan, ulfat khan, amjad khan, duulhe khan sahit saat bhai the, ek bahin bhi thi
 There was a friendly relationship between Nawab Walidad Khan of Malagarh and Chaudhary Zahit Khan
 "nawab validaad khan ke putr kii shaadi nawab mujffarnagar kii iklauti putree ke saath hui thi
 The procession left from Malagarh for Muzaffarnagar
 hapur raste main hone ke kaaran baraat yahan se hokar jaani thi
 On coming here, Nawab Walidad Khan sent Chaudhary tremendous Khan as the head of the procession and returned himself
 is ghatana se donon ke madhya dostana sambandhon kii pushti hoti hai
 The Nawab Muzaffarnagar gave a grand welcome to the procession and Chaudhary Jatri Khan
 baraat do maah se adhik samay tak nawab mujffarnagar ke yahan ruki rahi, jo vyakti baraat kii soochna praapt karne jate unhen bhi vaapis nahin aane diya jaataa, is kaaran baratiyon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho gayi
 In place of Nawab Validad, Chaudhary tremendous Khan performed the responsibility of the groom's father
 nawab mujffarnagar kii putree iklauti thi isliye nawab ne apni sampoorn jaaydaad apni ladki evam damaad ke superd kar di
 " hamaara anumaan he ki validaad khan kisi gupt evam ati mahatv ke kaary main lage hone ke kaaran putr kii shaadi main na ja sake honge or yah bhi ki yah kaam pehle se nirdhaarit nahin rahaa hoga balki achaanak lag gaya hoga
 If this particular work had been foreseen, the Nawab could have withdrawn the date of Validad Shah
 saath hi kaary itane adhik mahatv kaa hoga ki shaadi ke ain vakt par ve na to shaadi taal sakate the or na hi kaam ko wilimbit kar sakate the
 Finally, the question arises what exactly was this work? We believe that this work, and nothing else, must have been related to its plan or its planners before the revolution of 1857
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main sakshya samooh isi anumaan ko bal pradaan karata he ki shaadi kaa samay 1857 kii basant ritu ke aas-paas hoga
 By considering this one can easily guess
 itihaaskaar is par ekamat hai ki 10 may 1857 ko meerut se achaanak kranti prasphutit hui thi
 Therefore, it would not be evidenced that its eruption has a prior perception to Validad Khan
 atah saralata se is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki shaadi kii tithi 10 may se kuch purv nahokar hi kaaphi pehle rahi hogi
 On assuming this, father Validad Khan, instead of wasting precious time in his son's wedding, would have thought it appropriate to contact the planners and discharge their role in the revolution
 nawab validaad khan ek doordarshee vyakti the
 Contemporary historical sources confirm this
 1857 ke samay nawab validaad khan kaa malagarh riyasat main shashan tha tathaa mughal darbar main unhen vishesh sthaan praapt tha
 At the time of revolution, Emperor Bahadur Shah also handed over to him the responsibilities of Bulandshahr, Aligarh and adjoining areas
 1857 main mughal badshaah dwaara krantikariyon kaa saath dene ke kaaran validaad khan ne bhi unka saath diya tathaa angrejon ke viruddh apane kshetra kaa netritv kiya
 Chaudhary Zahir Khan, having close ties with Nawab Walidad Khan, fully supported the rebellion and led the revolutionary villagers of Hapur on a regional basis
 hapur tehsil main kai maah tak markat machi rahi
 The revolutionaries cut all the telephone wires between Hapur and Bulandshah

 kehete hai ki isaki charam smriddhi ke samay vahaan lakhon vyapaaree rahaa karte the
 To the newcomer who came there, the family settled in the state used to give one rupee and a brick as help, thus the newcomer would get millions of rupees and bricks to establish himself so that he could start his business without worry
 Used to do it
 mata mahalakshmi kii krupa se maharaja agrasen ne apane rajya ko 18 ganraajyo main vibhajit kar ek vishaal rajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha, jo inke naam par agrey ganraajya yaa agroday kahalaaya
 
 maharishi garg ne maharaja agrasen ko 18 ganadhipatiyon ke saath 18 yajna karne kaa sankalp karavaaya
 Seventeen-and-a-half gotras of the Agrawans were established in the name of these 18 Ganadhipatis sitting in yagyas
 us samay yagyon main pashubali anivaary rup se di jaati thi
 The priests of the first yajna themselves became Garg sages, initiated the eldest prince Vibhu and chanted them from the Garga gotra
 isi prakaar doosraa yajna gobhil rishi ne karavaaya or dwitiya ganadhipati ko goyal gotra diya
 Third Yagya Gautam Rishi got Goin gotra, in fourth Vatshi got Bansal gotra, in fifth Kaushik Rishi got kansal gotra, in sixth Shandilya Rishi was Singhal gotra, in seventh seventh Mangal Rishi got Mangal gotra, in eighth Jamin got Jindal gotra Tandya Rishi had Tingal gotra, Tenth in Aurvish Rishi, Aryan gotra in Gyarave, Dhaumya Rishi in Gyarawan got Dharan gotra, Mudgal Rishi in twelfth got Mandal gotra, Vasantha Rishi in thirteenth l'gotra, in the fourteenth, Maitreya Rishi gave the Mittal gotra, the fifteenth Kashyap Rishi gave the Kuchal gotra
 17 yajna purna ho chuke the
 At the time when live animals were being sacrificed in the 18th Yajna, Maharaj Agrasen was disgusted by seeing that scene
 unhone yajna ko bich main hi roak diya or kaha ki bhavishya main mere rajya kaa koi bhi vyakti yajna main pashubali nahin degaa, na pashu ko maaregaa, na maans khayega or rajya kaa har vyakti pranimaatr kii raksha karegaa
 Impressed by this incident, he embraced non-violence religion
 idhar antim or athaharwe yajna main yagnacharyo dwaara pashubali ko anivaary bataaya gaya, naa hone par gotra adhuraa rah jayega, aisa kaha gaya, parantu maharaja agrasen ke aadesh par atharaven yajna main nagendra rishi dwaara nangal gotra se abhimantrit kiya
 This gotra is considered half due to lack of animal sacrifices, thus even today 18 and a half seventeen gotras are prevalent in Agarwal society

 Jay Shri! maharaj ne apane rajya ko 18 ganon main vibhajit kar 18 guruon ke naam par 18 gotron kii sthapana kii thi
 Despite each tribe being different, they all remained part of the same family
 isi kaaran agroha bhi sarvangin unnati kar sakaa
 He established a democratic state by taking one representative each from the same 18 counties of the state, whose form is seen in the present democracy system as well
 agarawalon ke 18 gotra nimnlikhit hai - Yagna was considered a sign of prosperity, splendor and prosperity at that time
 maharaj agrasen ne bahut saare yajna kiye
 Once the horse brought to the sacrificial fire was very restless and frightened, he got an idea that what is the benefit of such prosperity which is filled with the blood of silent animals
 usee samay unhone apane mantriyon ke naa chaahane par bhi pashu bali par roak laga di
 That is why even today, the leading society remains away from violence
 maharaj agrasen ke raaj kii vaibhavta se unke padosi raja bahut jalte the
 So they kept attacking Agroha again and again
 baar-baar munhaki khaane ke baavjood unke kaaran rajya main tanaav bana hi rahata tha
 Due to these wars, Agrasenji was disturbed in the work of the welfare of the subjects
 log bhi bhaybheet or roj-roj kii ladai se trast ho gayi the
 Along with this, a huge fire broke out in Agroha once
 us par kisi bhi tarah kaabo naa paaya ja sakaa
 Thousands of people became homeless due to that fire and went to different states of India in search of livelihood
 par unhone apni pahchaan nahin chhodi
 All of them still like to be called Agarwal and maintain their identity with the same 18 gotras
 aaj bhi ve sab maharaj agrasen dwaara nirdeshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hai
 The capital of Maharaja Agrasen was Agroha
 unke shashan main anushaasan kaa paalan hota tha
 The public devoutly performed their duties with freedom
 maharaj agrasen ne 108 varshon tak raaj kiya
 a balanced harmony of tradition and experimentation is seen in the life values he embraced
 unhone ek ore hindu dharm grathon main kshatriya varna ke liye nirdeshit karmkshetra ko sweekaar kiya or duusari ore deshkal ke pariprekshya main nae adarsh sthapit kiye
 There are basically three ideals of his life - democratic governance, economic equality and social equality
 ek nishchit aayu praapt karne ke baad kuladevi mahalakshmi se paraamarsh par ve agrey ganraajya kaa shashan apane jyeshtha putr vibhu ke haathon main saunpkar tapasya karne chale gaye
 Towards the end of his life, Maharaj handed over all the responsibility to his eldest son Vibhu and adopted the Vanaprastha Ashram
 aaj bhi itihaas main maharaj agrasen param pratapi, dharmik, sahishnu, samaajwaad ke prerak mahapurush ke rup main ullekith hai
 Hospitals, schools, stepwells, Dharamshalas etc
 are the basis of Agrasen's life values in the country and these values are the symbol of human faith

 yahaan kul baarah blox yaa khand hai:- Other places of business in Delhi: 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya rene dekart ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers are Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a point in three dimensions
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi

 The heated or evaporated liquid is extracted and used in various processes or for heating, such as water heat, central heat, steam-based power generation, food preparation and cleaning
 europe ke itihaas main byleron kaa ullekh yunaan or rome ke samrajyon ke samay se hi dekhne main aa rahaa he, lekin unka aadhunik rup main vikaas bahut dhire dhire hua he
 The use of steam to produce power began in the 19th century, but when Trevithick used high pressure vapor in his engines, no matter how strong the boiler was and what metal it was
 Was
 unnisvin shatabdi ke aarmabhik dinon tak jo log kisi bhi kaam ke liye boyler banaate the, ve yaa to apane uplabdh sadhano or suvidha ke anusaar, athwa jahaan use baithaana he us jagah ke anusaar, uski akruti bana lete the
 Initially, the boilers were made from copper sheets and later the iron was made
 majbootee or daab sahan karne kii drushti se boyler kii sarvottam akruti gol hi honi chahie, lekin ise bilkul sahi banane, sthirtapurvak tikaakar baitaane or aag kii garmi ko adhik se adhik maatra main pani tak pahunchaakar pani ko vaashp banane main badi jhanjhaten or kathinaaiyaan padati hai
 The second best shape is cylindrical after the spherical in terms of strength
 at: jab se vaashp kaa upyog shakti utpaadan ke liye hone laga tab se byler belanaakaar hi banaae jate hai, chaahe ve akele ek hi dhol ke rup main hon athwa anek dholon ke sanyukt rup main, athwa dholon or anek naliyon ke sanyukt rup main
 For the purpose of making and operating boilers, a separate scripture has been made in terms of safety of the public and efficiency of boilers, some of whose essential scientific rules have also come in the legislation of the states
 inkaa paalan karne ke liye boyleron kaa prayek prayogkarta baadhya he
 Boilers are divided into two main classes according to their design: agni-nalika boyleron main cornesh boyler sabase puraane prakaar kaa he
 Its texture is very simple, due to which it is still used today
 isamen ek hi dhoomravahini nalika hoti he, jiske aage ke bhaag main bhatthi bani hoti he
 Nowadays this boiler is made in many measurements, from small to large
 isaki choti se choti maap vyas main chaar foot ke lambaai main 10 foot hoti he or badi se badi maap 6 foot 6 inch vyas main tathaa lambaai main 24 foot hoti he
 It has only one furnace and fumes, so in a large size boiler, the coal does not burn properly and its hot surface ratio is also low
 isliye cornesh prakaar ke boyler main do bhatthiyaan baraabar baraabar bana dene se vahi lankashair boyler kahalaane lagata he
 Their other designs are the same
 chote se chote lankashair boyler kaa vyas 5 foot, 6 inch or lambaai 16 foot hoti he, tathaa bade se bade kaa vyas 10 foot or lambaai 30 foot hoti he
 Many times three kilns are also made in it
 cornesh or laikashair boyleron main saadharantaya vashp kii daab 180 pound prati varg inch tak hoti he
 Both these types of boilers can also be termed as ignited boilers, although the flames of fire swirl from the back of the furnace and heat the boiler from the outside
 cornesh or lankashair boyleron main ek se adhik bhatthi or bade bade vyas kii dhoomravahini laga dene par bhi unka tapt dharaatal icchaanusaar nahin badhane paata
 Therefore, in order to serve this purpose, many types of boilers are replaced with many small diameter smoke tubes instead of installing large fire channels, due to which the boilers are called multicolored boilers
 yah bahyat: prajvalit or ant: prajvalit, donon hi prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Externally ignited boilers are used in forest-dominated areas where sawing machines are used in the forest

 Nowadays in the industrial sector, the cost of steam in engines, turbines and other types of equipment and processes is so high that ordinary boilers are unable to meet that requirement
 yaaro or sterling boyler, jinka hamane upar varnan kiya he, thode bahut parivartanon ke saath bade kaarkaanon or bijli gharon ke liye kuch adhik upyogi to ho gaye, kyonki sudhaar karne se unamem koyale kii bukani, tel or loha galane kii bhatthiyon se khaarij honevaali gaisen bhi jalaai jane lageen
 Even then, they lagged behind modern areas, because the steam vapor of 575 pounds per square inch, which has a high temperature of 399 ° C, for shipping works
 Ho is quite understood
 yadi yaaro or sterlig boyleron main do lakh pound vaashp ukt daab or taap par prati ghanta bhi bana den, to ise kaaphi samajha jaataa he, lekin sthaliy kaarkaanon or bijli gharon main 1,000 pound prati varg inch or kabhi kabhi isse unche daab kaa vaashp bhi paanch lakh pound prati ghanta se bhi adhik maatra main kharch ho jaataa he
 Therefore, instead of drums and dilapidated boilers, some of the most dilapidated instruments are being made, in which the drum is applied only for nominal vapor accumulation
 inaki or puraane boyleron kii akruti main ab koi samanta nahin rahi, at: inhen bhaapajanitr hi kehete hai
 Transport of pure distilled water in steam generators by the use of pumps in thin tubes and evaporation in them also takes place
