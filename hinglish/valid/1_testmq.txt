 Most of the water in the Earth's atmosphere and crust comes from the ocean's salty seawater, while freshwater accounts for 2
5% of the total

 Since water is denser than any gas, this means that water will flow into a "depression" as a result of the high density of the ocean
 
 Since the low density rocks of the continental crust contain readily poor amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals, salt, over billions of years, evaporation results in fresh water returning to the ground as rain, as snow

 Rust has an important role in iron corrosion
 agar shuddh loha shuddh pani yaa shuddh oxigen ke sampark main ho to zang nahin banataa
 Instead, a thin layer of iron oxide is formed by the reaction in iron and oxygen which tightly clings to the iron and covers it completely
 is parat ko nishkreey parat kaha jaataa he
 The iron inside this layer is safe
 lekin salfar diaoxide, carbon diaoxide yaa anya ashuddhiyon kii upasthiti main yah parat zang kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he jo lohe se chipakata nahin balki alag chhilane lagata he

 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses

 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse

 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe

 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company

 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army
 bombay, madras or bengal presidensi kii apni alag sena or senapramukh hota tha
 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the
 The army of Bombay and Madras Presidency, being a people of different regions, these forces were full of diversity and did not have the dominion of the people of any one region
 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made compulsory to work abroad for some time
 sipaahi dhire-dhire sena ke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon se asantusht ho chuke the
 The salary of the army was low

 And after winning Awadh and Punjab the sepoys' allowance was also abolished
 enfield bandook ke bare main faili afvaahon ne sipaahiyon kii ashnka ko or badhaa diya ki company unki dharm or jati parivartan karnaa chaahati he
 The revolt began due to a gun
 sipaahiyon ko pattesion 1853 enfield bandook di gayin jo ki 0
577 calibar kii bandook thi tathaa puraani or kai dashakon se upyog main laayi ja rahi brown bas ke mukaable main shaktishaalee or achook thi
 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai

 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences

 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor

 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati

 Nagar Brahmins were adept at explaining and interpreting the meaning of religion and had special knowledge and did not take any remuneration in return, so they were given land by the kings, mostly their habitat was around Vadnagar and Anandnagar
 These people of the Nagar Brahmin community used to travel to remote areas
 In countries like Egypt, Babylon, Brazil, Kabul, India, China and Cambodia, these people established faith in Shiva and Shaivism

 kathboli yaa slang kisi bhashaa yaa boli ke un anaupchaarik shabdon or vaakyanshon ko kehete hai jo bolne vaale kii bhashaa yaa boli main maanak to nahin maane jate lekin bolchaal main sweekaarya hote hai
 Linguists believe that puppets have always existed in every standard language, and almost everyone uses them
 aksar ek hi bhashaa samudaay ke vibhinn virgon kii apni bhinn kathboliyaan hoti hai or kisi vyakti dwaara kathboli kaa prayog uskaa kisi vishesh varg main sadsyta kaa sanket hota he
 For example, a Hindi-speaking policeman from Delhi is called 'thulla' in slang while in Mumbai she is called 'mama'
 kabhi-kabhi kathboli bahut lambe arase tak maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag na hote hue bhi prachlit rah sakati he, masalan samaaj ke kuch virgon main thanedaar yaa darogaa ke liye 'thulla' shabd kathboli ke rup main punjab kshetra ke kuch samudaayon main san 1880 main bhi prachlit paaya gaya tha
 Slang is also often used as euphemisms when the standard word for something is considered unpleasant or derogatory to hear, for example 'urine' is called 'susu' in many Hindi-speaking slang
 kabhi-kabhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki koi shabd maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag he yaa kathboli he
 The linguists Bethany Dumas and Jonathan Lighter listed some signs of slang for a word or phrase that slang is probably if a word has at least two of these characteristics: kathboli kisi vyavsaayik kshetra main boli jane vaali visheshgy boli se alag hoti he
 Classification is the technical terminology of a particular profession and its words meet only the second criterion from the list above, so slang cannot be called, although they can be used to keep a person outside the profession separate from the group
 
 kuch kathboliyon kaa prayog keval ek vishesh kshetra main hota he, udaharantah fiji hindi main 'kya' kii jagah kabhi-kabhi 'konchi' bolaa jaataa he, jo 'koun chiz' kaa sikuda rup he
 In contrast slang nouns are often associated with a particular subculture such as music or video games rather than territory
 phir bhi kathboli kii abhivyaktiyaan apane vaastavik kshetron se baahar jaakar "kool" or "jive" kii tarah aam taur par istemaal karne laayak ho sakati hai
 While some words eventually lose their status as slang, the use of other words continues to be treated in a similar way by most speakers
 jab kathboli mul rup se iskaa istemaal karne vaale samooh yaa up-samskruti se pare nikal jaati he to iske vaastavik upyogkarta samooh kii pahchaan ko kaayam rakhane ke liye isaki jagah duusare, kam-manyata praapt shabdon kaa prayog karne lagate hai
 One use of slang is to circumvent social prohibitions as mainstream language tries to shy away from appropriating certain realities
 isi kaaran se kathboli kii shabdaawaliyaan kuch khaas kshetra jaise ki hinsa, aparaadh, drugs or sex main vishesh rup se samrudh hai
 Alternatively, slang can only get out of familiarity with the things described
 udhaaharan ke liye californian sharaab ke kadaradaanon main se caburnet sauviganon ko aksar "cab so" ke rup main, cardone ko "card" ke rup main or isi tarah se janaa jaataa he; iskaa matlab yah he ki alag-alag sharaabon kaa namakaran iske anaavashyak prayog ko kam karata he; saath hi yah sharaab ke saath upyogkarta ke apanepan ko darshane main bhi madad karata he
 Even in a language community, slang and the extent to which it is used vary widely across social, ethnic, economic and geographic areas
 kathboli kaaphi samay ke baad prayog se baahar ho ja sakati he; haalanki kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog adhik se adhik saamaanya ho jaataa he jab tak ki yah kuch kehane kaa ek prabhaavshaalee tarika nahin ban jaataa he, jab aam taur par ise mukhyadhara kii sweekaarya bhashaa ke rup main samajha jane lagata he, haalanki nishedhaatmak shabdon ke maamle main aisi koi abhivyakti nahin bhi ho sakati he jise mukhyadhara yaa sweekaarya bhashaa samajha jaataa ho
 Many slang words enter informal mainstream dialogue and sometimes in formal dialogue, although this can also include a change in meaning or usage
 kathboli main aksar maujuuda shabdon ke liye aupnyasik arthon kaa srijan shaamil hota he
 It is common for those novel meanings to diverge substantially from the standard meaning
 is prakaar 'kool' or 'hot' donon kaa matlab "bahut acha," "prabhaavshaalee," yaa "sundar" ho saktaa he
 Slang words are often known to be used only within a group or intergroup
 udhaaharan ke liye lit mul rup se keval kuch vishesh internet up-samskritiyon jaise ki pataakhon or online video gamers ke bich lokapriy the
 However, during the 1990s and in the early 21st century, lit has begun to take more and more common space on the Internet and has now spread beyond Internet-based dialogue and conversational languages
 kathboli ke anya prakaaron main shaamil hai mobile phone par istemaal hone vaali esemes kii bhashaa or "chatspea," ", jo "jor se hansane" yaa "joardaar hansee" yaa aroefel, "hansate-hansate jameen par lot janaa" kaa ek vipareet arth he), jiskaa istemaal internet par twarit samvaad bhejne ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some linguists make a distinction between the use of slang and the use of slang
 ghilad jukarman ke anusaar "kathboli kaa sandarbh ek vishisht saamaajik samooh, udhaaharan ke liye kishoron, sainikon, kaidiyon or choron dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik shabdic samagriyon se he
 Slang is not the kind of colloquial language that is an informal, easy dialect used by the speaker on some occasion; Which may include words such as "yours" and the use of other colloquial words
 The use of common colloquial is a lexical material used in informal dialect whereas in the broad sense "colloquial" terminology may include slang use, not in its narrow sense
 kathboli kaa prayog aksar bolchaal kii bhashaa main kiya jaataa he lekin sabhi bolchaal kii bhashaayen kathboli nahin hoti hai
 One way to do between slang and colloquial language is to ask if most local speakers understand the term; If they do, then it is a colloquial language
 haalanki samasya yah he ki yah ek alag, pramaathran pranali nahin he balki ek nirantarata kii pranali he
 However, most slang are short-lived and often used by newcomers, some of which achieve non-slang colloquial status as 'bliss, fortune' and the first name of a Jewish woman, Zelda) and even a formal position "
 kathboli ko kai bhashaaon main 'slang' kaha jaataa haibhashavaigyanikon ko is shabd kii jaden abhi gyaat nahin hai
 It is related to the khubhasa of thieves, and its earliest authentic use is "the vocabulary of inferior or non-eminent people, though other than that its origin is not clear
