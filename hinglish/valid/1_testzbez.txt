 But in the light of modern facts, there is no message now that Indian mathematicians had done very important work in this field long before Diophants
 diophanteey samasyaon main samikarnon kii sankhya charon kii sankhya se kam hoti he 
 The coefficients of the variables in these equations are integers and the integer values of the variables have to be obtained that satisfy these equations
 isliye un sabhi samikarnon kaa naam diophanteey sameekaran pad gaya jinamein charon ke gunank purnank hote hai
 Mathematical study of diophantic problems is now called diophantic analysis

 The following questions are often considered in diophantic analysis - 800 isapurv se 500 isapurv rachit shulbasutron main diophanteey samikarnon kaa purnank hal miltaa he
 Around 800 BC, Boudhayan obtained the solution of simultaneous diophantic equations as a set of two positive integers
 unhone chaar agyaat raashiyon se yukt yugapat diophanteey samikarnon kaa hal nikaalane kii bhi koshish kii thi
 In 600 BC, Apastamb tried to solve the diophantic equations with 5 unknown sums
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhartiya ganitagya a x + b y = c { \ displaystyle ax+by=c} prakaar ke samikarnon kaa purnank hal khojane kii disha main karyrat rahe hai
 Although nowadays they are called 'diophantic equations', but long before diophants there is a detailed discussion of such mathematical problems in the Shulbasutras
 shulbasutron kaa kaal 800 isapurv yaa usase bhi pehle he
 Aryabhata has named the solution of such problems as 'kuttak'
 bhaskar ne aryabhatiy kii tikaa main nimnlikhit kuttak diya he- Namely, carry out the integer n { \ displaystyle N} where n = 8 x + 5 = 9 y + 4 = 7 z + 1 { \ displaystyle n = 8x + 5 = 9y + 4 = 7z + 1}

 The word 'kuttak' literally means 'hearer'
 kuttak vidhi vastav main ek punaravarti vidhi he
 At present, this method, with interpretation by Bhaskar in 621 AD, is called 'aryabhata algorithm', which has become the standard method for solving first-degree diophantic equations

 In common language, it can be called the limit of "return impossible", that is, the gravity beyond it becomes so fierce that nothing, whether object or light, can get out of here
 isaki sab se adhik di jane vaali misaal "kaala chhidr" he
 If light arises from an object inside the event horizons of black holes, it remains within the boundary of the event horizon forever - the person outside it can never see it
 yahi vajah he ki kaale chhidr kaale lagate hai - unase koi roshni nahin nikalati
 When something starts falling towards the black hole in its gravitational chapel, as it starts to come close to the boundary of the event horizon, the terrible effects of gravity start showing amazing effects of the theory of relativity
 dur se dekhne waalon ko aisa lagata he ke us vastu kii kaale chhidr ke taraf girane kii gati dhimi hoti ja rahi he or uski chhavi main laalimaa badhati ja rahi he
 The viewers never see that the object crosses the event cycle
 lekin us vastu ko aisa koi prabhaav mahasoos nahin hota - use lagata he ke vah tezi se kaale chhidr kii taraf girakar ghatana kshitij paar kar jaati he
 Because of relativity, the speed of time of the observer and that object becomes very different

 Belief in a common impersonal power is called Pranavism
 ise 'sapranavad', 'sachetanwad', 'jeevatmavad' aadi bhi kehete hai
 The term 'animism' was used by the British anthropologist Robert Marrett for the above belief
 darshanik bhashaa main pranavad vah siddhant he jiske anusaar bhautik padaarthon evam prakritik ghatnaon ke antsthal main bhi ichhashakti ke astitv par vishwaas kiya jaataa he
 Some people do not accept the existence of spirits or souls in root matter or natural substances, but in them also consider a type of personality and willpower or samiha
 udaahranarth, ve yah to nahin kahenge ki keet pantagon, ped paudhon grah upgrahon yaa taragan aadi main manushya kii jaisi atmaaen hai, parantu ve yah vishwaas avashya karte hai ki is prakaar ke padaarthon main bhi ichhashakti yaa samiha hoti he
 Such belief of human beings is called Pranavism
 kuch vichaarkon evam aadhunik vaigyanikon kii drushti main sarvajeevad yaa jadsamihavad maanav kaa ek praarambhik vishwasamaatr he, pramanpusht siddhant nahin
 According to him, he is one of the mental efforts of man to understand the activities of the root world in the infancy of his intellectual life
 chunki usne apni anek shaareerik kriyaaon ko apni vyaktigat samiha se samudbhoot yaa sanchalit hoti hui anubhav kiya tha, at: yah uske liye swabhik hi tha ki vah samay samay par ghatanevaali yaa satat honevaali prakritik ghatnaon kaa bhi udgam ek prakaar kii vyaktigat samiha yaa ichhashakti ko hi maane
 But this belief or belief in human actions and natural phenomena being insufficient and based only on external analogy is not considered logically expedient and can also be said to be guilty of non-inspection of essential and related facts
 jab swayan manushya ke sharir kii bhi anek kriyaayein, jaise hriday kii gati, rakt kaa sancharan, pachankriya aadi, uski aichhik kriyaayein nahin kahi ja saktin, to phir yah kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki vrikshadi ke vikaas evam grahon ke gamanadi kii kriyaayein samihapurvak sanchalit hoti hai?

]] An overdraft occurs when there is a withdrawal in excess of the available balance from the bank account
 aisi sthiti main us vyakti ko "overdron " kaha jaataa he
 If there is a prior agreement for overdraft protection scheme from the account provider and the additional amount withdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then interest is charged at the agreed rate only
 yadi yah shesh raashi sahamat sharton se adhik ho jaati he to shulk evam ucchtar byaaj dar adhiropit ho saktaa he
 The first known overdraft was awarded in 1728 when the merchant William Hogg was granted a withdrawal of £ 1000 which exceeded the amount available in his account
 yah overdraft da royal bank of scotland ke dwaara pradaan kiya gaya tha jo pichley varsh edinburgh main khulaa tha
 Overdrafts occur for a variety of reasons
 in main shaamil hai: Banks in the UK often provide a basic overdraft facility with a pre-arranged limit

 When customers exceed their authorized overdraft limit, they are overdrawn without authorization, resulting in one or more charges from the customer on the amount by which they have exceeded their authorized overdraft limit but a higher rate of credit goes
 bainkon dwaara liye jane vaale shulk bhinn ho sakate hai
 If an item is presented by the customer even after the rejection by the issuing bank due to insufficient funds, it may also incur a charge, that is, the bank decides not to allow the customer to carry out unauthorized overdrafts
 punah aise shulk kaa str or prakruti bhinn bainkon main bhinn hoti he
 Typically, the bank sends a letter informing the customer and after that point requests to operate his account within the prescribed limit
 is prakriya par bibisi ke ek kaarykram vicellabloar main yah note kiya gaya ki ek bank se anadhikrut overdraft kii vaastavik raashi do pound se bhi kam thi
 No major UK bank has completely removed unauthorized overdraft fees
 tathaapi, kuch bank ek 'bafer jone' pradaan karte hai, jisamen yadi graahak ek nishchit raashi se kam se apni seemaa paar karte hai to graahakon se shulk nahin liya jaataa
 anya bank overdraft ke str kii maatra kii parvaah kiye bina overdraft shulk vasuul karte hai jise kuch log anuchit maanate hai
 In response to the criticisms, Lloyds TSB has changed its fee structure, instead of a single monthly fee on unauthorized overdrafts, they now charge daily

 One situation that has caused much controversy is that by rejecting the check / direct debit, the bank imposes a fee which causes the customer to be overdrawn and then charge a fee for being overdrawn
 haalanki, helifax jaise kuch bainkon main "shulk par shulk nahin" kii niti he jiske antargat ek khaataa yadi purnatah abhukt shulk ke kaaran adhi-aaharith ho jaataa he to usase atirikt shulk nahin liya jaataa
 In 2006, the Office of Fair Trading issued a statement concluding that when customers exceeded their maximum spending limit / were late payments to their accounts, credit card issuers were fined for late payments from them Fees were raised
 bayaan main, o epa tii ne sifarish kii thi ki credit card jarikarta aisa adhiktam shulk 12 british pound nirdhaarit karen

 anadhikrut overdraft shulk dene vaale anek graahakon ne is bayaan kaa istemaal shulk kii raashi vasuuli hetu apane bainkon par mukadmaa karne ke liye ek manch ke rup main kiya he
 It is currently thought that such claims have been flooded in England and Wales county courts
 daavedaaron ko akrasar da kanjumar ection group jaisi web citon se sahaayta mil rahi he
 To date, many banks have not appeared in court to justify their unauthorized overdraft fee structures and many customers have fully recovered such charges

 Overdraft protection is a financial service provided primarily by banking institutions in the United States
 jab kisi graahak ke khate main nikasi kii raashi ko cover karne ke liye paryaapt kosh uplabdh nahin hota, to overdraft yaa kartsi pe program protection us graahak ke khate main prastut kiye gaye madon kaa bhugtan karata he
 Can cover overdraft protection, ATM withdrawals, purchases made with debit cards, electronic transfers and checks
 gaiyr purv-adhikrut madon jaise check yaa asietch nikasi ke maamalon main overdraft protection unako bina bhugtan kiye lautaane yaa bouns karne kii apeksha in madon ke bhugtan kii anumati detaa he haalanki, atm nikasi or debit card athwa check card se kii gai kharid ko purv-adhikrut mana jaataa he or jab use prastut kiya jaae to bank ko uskaa bhugtan karnaa chahie, chaahe yah overdraft hi kyon na ho
 Traditionally, a bank manager would have to monitor the bank's overdraft list every day
 If the manager sees that a preferred customer has made an overdraft, it is their discretion to pay the overdraft in favor of the customer
 Banks traditionally did not charge for this ad hoc coverage
 chunki, yah puri tarah se vivekadhin tha atah is par nirbhar nahin rahaa ja saktaa tha
 With the advent of large scale interstate branch banking, traditional ad hoc coverage has practically disappeared
 iskaa ek apwaad tathakthith "anivaary bhugtan" suchi he
 At the beginning of each business day, branch managers often ask for a computerized list of items still pending for rejection, for accounts held in their specific branch, city, or state
 aam taur par, yadi ek graahak nakadi ke saath shakha main aa jane main safal ho jaataa he yaa asweekruti hetu lambit mad kii raashi ko cover karne ke liye koi hastantaran karata he, to manager us mad kaa "anivaary bhugtan" kar sakate hai
 Furthermore, if the situation is weak or the referenced item is from an account held by a regular customer, managers may take a risk by paying the item, but this is very uncommon
 bainkon kaa ek cat of samay hota he jiske andar yah karrwai ho jaani chahie, us samay ke baad mad swachaalit rup se "lambit asweekruti" se "asweekrut" kii suchi main chalaa jaataa he or us par aage koi karrwai nahin kii ja sakati
 This form of overdraft protection is a contractual relationship in which the bank promises to pay the overdraft to a certain dollar limit
 ek upabhokta jo overdraft credit line chahta he, use ek aavedan ko purna karke us par hastakshar karnaa chahie
 iske baad bank graahak ke credit kii jaanch karata he or aavedan ko manjuur yaa naamanzoor kar detaa he
 Overdraft credit lines are loans and must conform to the Truth in Lending Act
 On associated accounts, banks usually charge a nominal fee per overdraft and also charge interest on the outstanding balance
 kuch bank is baat kaa dhyaan rakhe bina ki credit line kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa nahin, ek chota sa masik shulk lete hai
 This form of overdraft protection is available to consumers who meet the creditworthiness criteria established by banks for such accounts
 ek baar credit line sthapit ho jaati he, to uplabdh credit graahak ke uplabdh shesh rakam ke rup main dikhaai de sakati he
 Also referred to as "overdraft transfer protection", a current account can be linked to another account, such as from a savings account, credit card, or credit line
 Once the relationship is established, when an item is presented to the current account and is overdrafted, the funds are transferred from the associated account to the current account to cover the overdraft
 prayek overdraft sthanantaran ke liye ek maamuli shulk liya jaataa he or yadi sambhddha khaataa ek credit card yaa credit line he to graahak ko us khate kii sharton ke antargat byaaj chukaana hota he
 The main difference between an associated account and an overdraft credit line is that an overdraft credit line can usually only be used for overdraft protection
 overdraft sangrakshan ke liye sambhddha alag khate apane aap main swatantra khate hai
 a more fresh product is being offered by some banks known as "dishonor protection"
 chote bank trittiya paksh companiyon dwaara prashasit yojanaayen pesh kar rahe hai jinase bainkon ko atirikt shulk aay praapt karne main sahaayta milegi
 bade bainkon kii pravriti anadaran suraksha yojana pesh karne kii nahin he, lekin iske bajaay ve apane khaaton ke niyam or sharton ke anusaar overdraft ko sansaadhit karte hai
 In either of the two cases, the banks may decide to cover the overdrawn item at their discretion and levy an overdraft fee, the amount of which may or may not be disclosed
 Unlike traditional ad hoc coverage, this decision to pay or not pay for overdrawn items is automatic and the average balance of the customer, the account's overdraft history, the number of customer's accounts in the bank and the period since the opening of those accounts, Like is based on subjective criteria
 haalanki, swachaalit maandand puure hone par bhi, bank overdraft ke bhugtan kaa vaada nahin karte hai
 The dishonor protection scheme has some similarities with the superficial credit line of superficial and ad hoc coverage of overdrafts, but works under separate rules
 ek overdraft credit line kii tarah, anadaran suraksha yojana kii shesh raashi ko bhi graahak ke uplabdh shesh ke saath dekha ja saktaa he, tab bhi bank ek adhi-aaharith mad ke bhugtan se inkaar karne kaa adhikaar surakshit rakhata he, jo ki paramparaagat tadarth kawarej ke samaan he
 Banks usually charge a lump sum fee for each paid overdraft
 ek bank us prayek din ke liye jis dauraan khate main nakaaratmak shesh rahata he, aavarti dainik shulk bhi le saktaa he
 Critics argue that because the money is given to the customer as an advance and is expected to be repaid, dishonor security is a type of loan
 kyonki bank overdraft ko cover karne ke liye kisi anubandh ke tahat baadhya nahin hai, "anadaran suraksha" truth in lending act se viniyamit nahin hoti jiske antargat bhraamak vijyapanon par roak he tathaa rin kii sharton ko prakat karnaa aavashyak he
 Historically, dishonor protection can be added to a customer's account without their permission or knowledge
 may 2005 main, bachat adhinium main satya ke viniman didi main sanshodhan kiya gaya ki "anadaran suraksha" yojana pradaan karne vaale bainkon ko apane graahakon ke saamne kuch nishchit khulaase karne honge
 in sanshodhano main shaamil hai, anadaran suraksha ko aarambh karne vaale len-dein kaa khulaasa karne kii aavashkata, anadaran suraksha se sambhddha shulk, lagaae gaye shulkon kii sankhya bataane vaala alag vivaran or bhraamak vigyapanon ko rokane ke liye anadaran suraksha yojana ke vipanan par pratibandh lagaana
 bade bank, jo apane niyam evam sharton par overdraft ko sansaadhit karte hai, pehle se hi in khulaason ko kar rahe hai
 US banks are estimated to collect $ 38
5 billion from overdraft fees in 2009, nearly double that in 2000
 overdraft shulk sambandhi vivaad kaa kshetra vah kram he jisamen bank ek graahak ke lenden khate main chadhaata he
 This is controversial, as the largest to smallest resource will maximize the incidence of overdrafts in the customer's account
 This situation arises when the account holder makes several small debits for which sufficient funds are available in the account at the time of purchase
 baad main, khaataa dharak ek bada debit karata he jo khate ko adhi-aaharith kar detaa he 
 yadi khate se bhugtan hetu sabhi mad ek hi din prastut hon or bank sabase bade len-dein ko pehle sansaadhit karata he, to parinaam swarup ekaadhik overdraft ho sakate hai
 "biggest Investigation First" policy is common in large US banks
 bainkon kaa tark he ki aisa isliye kiya jaataa he jis se ek graahak ke mahatvapurn lenden ke abhukt lautaaye jane ko rokane ke liye kiya jaataa he, baavjood iske ki aise kuch lenden guarantishuda hote hai
 This could have been true if the bank had in fact refused a lower fee, rather than letting them go so that the customer would be charged a fee
 Consumers tried to sue to stop the practice, arguing that banks rigged the order of transactions by using the "largest check first" to collect more overdraft fees to artificially generate more overdrafts
 
 Most banks in the United States are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal agency that has formally approved this process, although this process has recently been challenged under several private state deceptive laws
 bank jamaa samjhauton main aam taur par yah praavdhaan he ki bank apane vivek ke aadhaar par len-dein ko kisi bhi kram main samashodhit kar saktaa he
 The HR 946 introduced in the US House of Representatives on 8 February 2007 would increase regulation of the overdraft loan program
 The proposed bill would amend Regulation z of Truth in the Lending Act to clarify that overdraft fees are covered, requiring written consent prior to enrollment in the overdraft loan scheme, when an ATM withdrawal will cause an overdraft to be carried out by its financial institutions
 The need to give information to the customer and clearing the financial institutions just for the purpose of increasing the overdraft fee Changing positions of the new Czech or stop offering deposit accounts to delay the goal of this bill

 The first five-year plan was launched in 1951 and after that two more five-year plans were drawn up until 1965, after 1965, the war with Pakistan was interrupted by conflict planning

 Due to the rapidly changing political scenario at the Center, the Eighth Plan could not be started in 1990 and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were considered as annual plans
 sanrachanaatmak samaayojan kii nitiyon kii shuruuaat ke baad, aakhirkaar 1992 main aathvin yojana ko shuru kiya gaya
 In the first eight schemes, the main thrust was on the fast-growing public sector and during this time huge investments were made in infrastructure and heavy industry, but since the introduction of the Ninth Plan of 1997, the emphasis on public sector was slightly less, ayog ke sangyojan main apni sthapana ke baad se kaaphi parivartan aayaa he

 Aranyakanda is a part of Valmiki's Ramayana and Goswami Tulsidas's Shri Ram Charit Manas
 kuch kaal ke pashchaat ram ne chitrakoot se prayaag kiya tathaa ve atri rishi ke ashram pahunche
 Atri praised Rama and his wife Anasuya explained the merits of Pativrat Dharma to Sita
 vahaan se phir ram ne aage prasthaan kiya or sharbhang muni se bhent kii
 Sharabhang Muni was residing there only by wishing to see Rama, so having fulfilled his desire for Rama's darshan, burnt his body with yogagni and made Brahmaloka move
 or aage badhane par ram ko sthaan sthaan par haddiyon ke dher dikhaai pade jinke vishay main muniyon ne ram ko bataaya ki rakshason ne anek muniyon ko kha daalaa he or unheen muniyon kii haddiyaan hai

 Shurpanakha asked for help from khar-khoan and he came to fight with his army

 Shurpanakha went and complained to her brother Ravana
 ravan ne badla lene ke liye marich ko swarnamrig bana kar bheja jisaki chaal kii maang sita ne ram se kii
 After ordering Laxman to protect Sita, Rama went after him to kill the golden form of Maricha
 marich ke haathon maaraa gaya par marate marate marich ne ram kii aawaaj bana kar 'ha lakshmana' kaa krandan kiya jise sun kar sita ne ashankavash hokar lakshmana ko ram ke paas bhej diya
 After Laxman's departure, Sita alone deceived Ravana and took him with him to Lanka
 raste main jataayu ne sita ko bachaane ke liye ravan se yuddh kiya or ravan ne uske pankh katkar use adhamra kar diya
 Not getting Sita, Rama was very sad and started mourning
 raste main jataayu se bhent hone par usne ram ko ravan ke dwaara apni durdasha hone va sita ko har kar dakshin disha kii ore le jane kii baat bataai
 After telling all this, Jatayu gave up his life and Rama cremated him and proceeded inside the dense forest in search of Sita
 raste main ram ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran rakshas bane gandharv kabandh kaa vadh karke uskaa uddhaar kiya or shabari ke ashram ja pahunche jahaan par ki uske dwaara diye gayi jhuthe beron ko uske bhakthi ke vash main hokar khaaya| is prakaar ram sita kii khoj main saghan van ke andar aage badhate gayi

 Many other parts of this statue were also broken in the Aurangzeb period and dumped in the nearby sun well, which are found after excavation of the sun well in 1985

 Like its predecessor, it was directed by Richard Linkletter
 haalanki, ab linclator screenple kaa shrey is film ke do kalakaaron, ethan hoque or juli dalpi ko bhi dete he
 Linkletter also credits the original screen writer Kime Krejn of Before Sunrise for the story
 yah film bifor sunrise se kahani ko vahaan se chunati he jahaan ek america yuvak ek francisi yuvati se train main miltaa he or vienna main ve ek puri raat bitaate hai
 Their paths collide after nine years at Bifor Sunset
 aisa thik samay par hota he kyonki ve paris main ek dopaher saath-saath bitaate hai
 The film was a commercial and critical success, with the screenplay collecting the Academy Award for Best Transformed Screenplay
 bifor sunrise kii ghatana ko hue nau saal biit chuke hai, jab jesi or celin vienna main mili the
 Inspired by his time spent with Celine in this interval, Jessie has written a novel This Time and the book has become a bestseller in America
 europe main bikri ko badhaava dene ke liye jesi book tour karata he
 The final stop of the tour is Paris and Jaise is teaching at a bookstore called Shakespeare and Company
 jaise hi jesi darshakon ke saath baat karata he, usko or celin ko flash back main vienna main dikhaaya jaataa he; nau varsh biit jane ke baavjood ek saath kii raat kii smritiyaan uske jehan main maujuud hai
 Three journalists are present in the bookstore interviewing Jessie, one of the romantic Khayal who believes that the main characters of the book will meet again, one jealous who believes they won't meet and the third who wants it It is in doubt that they will be able to do it again
 Talking to the audience, his eyes turn to the window and he can barely believe it: Celine smiles upon seeing him
 prastuti ke khatm hote hi kitaab kii dukaan kaa manager use yaad dilaataa he ki use hawaii jahaaj pakadani he or lagbhag ek ghante main use hawaii adde ke liye nikalnaa chahie or jaisaa ki bifor sunrise main hua tha, usee tarah jesi or celin kaa punarmilan samay ke haathon majaboor ho jaataa he
 Just like in the first film, the characters are forced to make the best use of a short time together, making their interactions easier so that they can get closer, often with themes of work, politics and more, obsession
 Enhancing, capturing their love for each other, just as the time is spent with them
 apni baatcheet ke prarambh main, ve is vishay ko uthaate hai ki pehali mulaakaat ke chha: maheene baad hi milane kaa vaada kar ke bhi ve kyon nahin mili
 aisa lagata he ki vaade ke mutabik jesi vienna lautaa tha, lekin celin nahin lauti thi, kyonki unke milane kii tay taarikh ke pehle hi uski daadi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Because Jesse and Celine had not taken each other's addresses, there was no way to contact each other, resulting in their loss of contact
 baat karte hue donon apni pehali mulaakaat ke baad hui ghatnaon kaa zikr karte hai
 Both are now in the first half of their 30s
 jesi ab shadisuda he or uskaa ek betaa he
 Celine has become an environmental advocate, currently living in the US and has a boyfriend, a photo journalist
 unki baat ke dauraan yah spasht ho jaataa he ki donon apane jivan ke badalte vistaar se asantusht hai
 Jessie explains that it is only because of his son's love that he lives with his wife
 celin kahati he ki vah apane premi se bahut mil nahin paati kyonki vah aksar kaam par rahata he
 He is talked about in various places, including a roaming cafe in Paris, a garden, batu mouches and a mercenary car taken by Jaisi during his stay in Paris
 ek-duusare ke liye unki puraani bhavanaaen dhire dhire dubaara jaag rahi hai, pehali mulaakaat ko kho dene ke tanaav or pachhataave ke saath, kyonki ve mahasoos karte hai ki duusari koi bhi cheez unke jivan main vienna main bitaai gai us raat ke saath jam nahin pai
 jesi antat sweekaar karata he ki yah kitaab usne ek din celin se mil paane kii durasha main likhi he
 She replies that this book has brought back her sad memories
 ek bindu par, bhaade ke car main, ek tanaav vaale kshan main, jab jesi apane prem viheen or kaamahin vivaah kii baat sweekaar kar rahaa hota he, celin jesi ko sparsh karne ke liye apana haath badhaati he lekin waapas khinch leti he, kyonki vah uski ore mud jaataa he
 In the closing scene, Celine and Jessie arrive at Celine's apartment
 jesi jaan chukaa tha ki celin guitar bajaati he or use apane liye voltj gaanaa bajaane ke liye uksaata he
 Talk of their momentary union is revealed through the song Waltz
 uske baad jesi sterio system par nina simon sidi bajaata he
 Celine automatically dances to the song "just in Time" and Jessie keeps watching
 chunki celin simon kaa nakal karti he, jesi se budbudate hue kahati he, "baby 


tum apni jahaaj miss karne vaale ho
" jaise hi camera dhire-dhire neeche ghumta he, jesi apni shaadi kii anguthi ke saath ghabrahat or bechaini main muskuraataa he or anekaarthi dhang se jawaab detaa he," main jaanata hum,"yah anumaan darshakon par chhodte hue ki vah rah jaataa he yaa chalaa jaataa he, thik un teen patrakaron kii tarah jinalogon ne film kii shuruuaat main jesi se saakshaatkaar liya tha
 The film was shot over 15 days with approximately US $ 2 million
 hoque ne film banane ke kaaran par tippanee kii: The film was recorded due to using the camera as long as the static camera for a tracking shot and the longer it takes at 11 minutes
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki film vaastavik samay main ghatit hoti he, arthath kahani main vyateet samay film kaa bhi ran time he
 In addition, released nine years after the sequel Before Sunrise, the same amount of time has been spent in the plot since the incident of the first film
 hoque ne is shrinkhalaa main aage kii filmon kii sambhaavna kaa suzav diya tha
 He said that it would be wonderful to develop a chain ahead of their relationship
 The film appears as a result of Hawke's divorce from Uma Thorman, and some commentators compare the film's Jessie's character with Hawke's own life
 atirikt tippaniyon main ullekh kiya gaya he ki hoque or depli donon ke apane jivan ke tatv patakatha main nigamit kiye gayi hai, jaise ki yah tathy he ki delpi bahut varshon se neuyark shahar main rahete the
 Delpy also wrote two featured songs in this film
 a third includes the film's sound and closing credits

 mul film ke saath isaki tulana karte hue film aalochak roger abert ne likhaa,"bifor sunrise achche samvaad ke sammohan kaa ullekhneey utsav tha
 But before Sunset is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy have written dialogues on their own

O
 What Scott noted was "sometimes insane," but "hypnotic, in short because of its careless indifference to the common imperative of screenwriting
" He went on to elaborate, "can't they just say what they want? You can say that
 After all, language is not just about intent and meaning
 It's a medium of contact, but it's avoidance, Misdirection is also a medium for self-defense and outright confusion, all of which are the themes of this film, capturing a truth that has rarely been marked in a book or a film
 saanchaa:richard Linklater Suned is a village in Chamoli district of Garhwal division under the state of Uttarakhand in Tharali tehsil of India
 nayi kavita bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad likhi gayi un kavitaaon ko kaha gaya, jinamein paramparaagat kavita se aage naye bhavabodhon kii abhivyakti ke saath hi naye mulyon or naye shilp-vidhaan kaa anveshan kiya gaya
 It can also be said that the new stream of Hindi poetry developed after experimentalism is a new poem
 nayi kavita naam azaadi ke baad likhi gai un kavitaaon ke liye rutes ho gaya, jo apni vastu-chhavi or rup-chhavi donon main pragativaad or prayogwaad kaa vikaas hokar bhi vishisht he
 The new poetry movement is believed to have originated from the magazine "new Poetry" published in 1954 under the editors of the poet writers of Jagadish Gupta, Ramswaroop Chaturvedi and Vijayadevanarayan Sahi of the literary institution of Allahabad, Parimal
 isse pehle agyeya ke sampadan main prakashit kavy-sangrah 'doosraa saptak' kii bhoomika tathaa usamen shaamil kuch kaviyon ke vaktavyon main apni kaviton ke liye 'nayi kavita' shabd ko sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 For the new poem, no situation, relation, sentiment or thought related to world life is relevant as a story
 janm se lekar maran tak aaj ke maanav-jivan kaa jin sthitiyon, paristhitiyon, sambandhon, bhaavon, vichaaron or kaaryon se saahchary hota he, unhen nayi kavita ne abhivyakt kiya he
 The new poet has not considered any of the stories to be sacrilegious
 kathy ke prati nayi kavita main swanubhuti kaa aagrah he
 The new poet wants to present his story in the form in which he feels it
 nayi kavita vaad-mukti kii kavita he
 Earlier poets too often resorted to some debate
 or yadi kavi vaad kii parvaah na karen, kintu aalochak to uski rachana main kavy se pehle vaad khojataa tha-vaad se kavy kii parakh hoti thi
 But the situation of the new poem is different
 nayaa kavi kisi bhi siddhant, matvaad, sampradaay yaa drushti ke aagrah kii kattarta main fasane ko taiyaar nahin
 In short, the new poem is not an argument, limited in its narrative and vision
 kathy kii vyapaktaa or sristi kii unmuktata nai kavita kii sabase badi visheshta he
 The new poem does not follow the tradition
 manushyon main vaiyaktik bhinnata hoti he, usamen achchhiyaan bhi hai or buraayeeyaan bhi
 Man is beloved in all these forms to the poet of the new poem
 uskaa uddeshy manushya kii samagrata kaa chithran he
 The new poem maintains faith in life
 aaj kii kshanavaadi or laghumanavvaadi drushti jivan-mulyon ke prati sweekaaratmak drushti he
 In the new poem, there is a desire to enjoy life by accepting it fully
 jivan kii ek-ek anubhutiyon ko, vyathaa ko, sukh ko, satya maanakar jivan ko saghan rup se sweekaar karnaa kshamon ko satya maananaa he
 The new poem neither saw life as one-sided or not only in critical form, he saw life as life
 isamen koi seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii
 Like- grief begs everyone and, even if we do not know how to liberate ourselves, but - whoever asks for it, teaches them to keep everyone free
 nai kavita main do tatv pramukh hai- anubhuti kii sachai or buddhimulak yathartwaadee drushti
 That feeling of the moment or of an entire period, of a common man or of a specific man, of hope or of despair, is invaluable for poetry in its truth and also for life
 nai kavita main buddhivaad naveen yathartwaadee drushti ke rup main bhi he or naveen jivan-chetana kii pahchaan ke rup main bhi
 This is why neutral experimentation is the hallmark of both poetry and genre
 nayaa kavi apane kathy ke prati tatasth vritti rakhata he, kyonki uskaa praytn vaadon se mukt rahane kaa rahata he
 Due to this feature, there is no single circumference of the statements in the new verse
 isamen to kathy se kathy kii nai paraten ughadati aati hai
 Sometimes he even refutes his own statements - because of honesty
 nayaa kavi duubakar bhogata he, kintu bhogate hue dub nahin jaataa
 The new poem considers each moment of life to be true and supports to enjoy that truth with full heart and full consciousness
 anubhuti kii sachai, jitna vah le paata he, utana hi uske kavy ke liye satya he
 The new poem seeks to capture sensual deep moments, passions, business or any truth with its inner poignancy
 is prakaar jivan ke saamaanya se saamaanya deekhanevaale vyapaar yaa prasang nai kavita main nayaa arth paa jate hai
 In the new poem, many poignant poems have been written about the sensations of moments
 jo aakaar main choti hoti hai kintu prabhaav main atyant teevr
 The new poem does not follow the tradition
 in kaviyon ne paramparawaadi jadta kaa virodh kiya he
 Progressive poets have opposed the inertia of tradition because it makes people a victim of exploitation and hinders the laborers and Dalits of the world from gathering under one flag
 nayaa kavi uskaa virodh isliye karata he ki uske kaaran maanav-vivek kunthit ho jaataa he
 The new poem attempts to examine social reality and the role of the person in it
 iske kaaran hi nai kavita kaa saamaajik yatharth se gaharaa sambandh he
 But the realist vision of the new poem, not saturated with imaginary or idealistic humanism, seeks the value of life, its beauty, its light in life itself
 nai kavita dvivedi kaaleen kavita, chhayavaad yaa pragativaad kii tarah apane bane-banaaye moolyalaadi nuskhe pesh nahin karti, balki vah to use jivan kii sachhee vyathaa ke bheetar paanaa chaahati he
 Therefore, in the new poem, there is a rejection of old values in the form of satire, and somewhere a belief in the possibility of new values rising from within the truth of pain
 nai kavita ne dharm, darshan, niti, aachaar sabhi prakaar ke mulyon ko chunauti di he
 The tone of the new poem is bursting with life experience of its surroundings
 nai kavita main shahari jivan or gramin-jivan-donon pariveshon ko lekar likhanewaale kavi hai
 Agnay has written on both
 jabaki baalkrishna raav, shamsher bahadur singh, girijakumar maathur, kunvaranarayan singh, dharmaveer bharti, prabhakar machave, vijayadevnarayan saahi, raghuveer sahay aadi kavi kii samvednaayen or anubhutiyaan shahari parivesh kii hai to duusari ore bhavaniprasad mishra, kedarnath singh, shambhunath singh, thakurprasad singh, nagarjun, kedarnath agarwal aadi aise kavi hai jo multah gaanv kii anubhutiyaan or samvednaa se jude hai
 Apart from this, where there is suffocation, futility, boredom, defeat, inferiority, resentment, there are also self-inflicted feelings
 nai kavita kaa parivesh apane yahan kaa jivan he
 But there is an attack on him that he has additional disgust, despair, individualistic frustration and morbidity which is born out of imitation of the West
 nai kavita main pidaa or niraashaa ko kahin-kahin jivan kaa ek paksh na maanakar samgr jivan-satya maan liya gaya he
 There, pain has become a hindrance to stagnate, not becoming a creative force of life
 lok-sampukti nai kavita kii ek khaas visheshta he
 She is trying to get closer to easy folk life
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaaon kii samiksha karte hue professor mahavir saran jain kaa kathan he ki "hindi kii nai kavita par sabase bada akshep yah he ki usamen atirikt anasthaa, niraashaa, vishaad, hataasha, kuntha or marandharmita he
 After reading it, the urge to live ends, the person becomes discouraged, the mind becomes pessimistic and moribund
 yah ki nai kavita ne pidaa, vednaa, shok or niraashaa ko hi jivan kaa satya maan liya he
 The new poem does not draw inspiration from the land of India
 iske vipareet yah pashchim kii nakal se paidaa hui he
 The poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra demolish all these allegations
 mishra ji gandhivaadi he
 Gandhi's patriotism does not have a destination
 gandhi ji kii desh-bhakthi vishwa ke jeev maatr ke prati prem or uski seva karne ke liye unki jivan yatra kaa ek padaav he
 There is no sense of despair anywhere in his view
 usamen aashaa, vishwaas or aasthaa kii jyoti aalokit he
 Due to this light, the mass movements that Gandhiji started in South Africa and India filled the whole society with new awakening, new consciousness and new resolve
 unke jivan darshan se vishaad, niraashaa or maran-dharmita nahin apitu iske sarvatha vipareet nai aashaa, nai aasthaa or nai umang paidaa hoti he
 From it flows the trinity of truth, non-violence and love
 
 The poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra are the reason why the poor are helpless, weary, tired, dashed in the society and motivate them all to support them, encourage them to take up "
 nai kavita ne lok-jivan kii anubhuti, saundarya-bodh, prakrutti or uske prashnon ko ek sahaj or udaar maanviya bhoomi par grahan kiya
 At the same time, he made himself highly sensitive and alive by choosing from the images, symbols, words and epithets of folk life
 kavita ke upree aayojan nai kavita vahan nahin kar sakati
 It differs from the rest of the assumptions about the craft of poetry in its sphere, image, new symbol-scheme, use of new adjectives, new epithets
 nai kavita kii bhashaa kisi ek paddati main bandhakar nahin chalati
 The use of colloquial language for strong expression has been more in it
 nai kavita main keval sanskrit shabdon ko hi aadhaar nahin banaaya he, balki vibhinn bhashaaon ke prachlit shabdon ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 New words have also been created
 toye, bhabhake, khinchaa, siti, thithuran, thasakna, chidchidi, thunth, viras, siraaya, phunagiana – jaise anek shabd nai kavita main dhadlle se prayukt hue hai
 Which gives an openness and refreshment in its language
 isaki bhashaa main lok-bhashaa ke tatv bhi samahit hai
 The new poem has a plethora of symbols
 jaise- saanp tum sabhy to hue nahin, na honge, nagar main basna bhi tumhen nahin aayaa
 Ask one thing? Will answer Then learned how to laugh? Where did you get the poison? Bimb is also available in large quantities in the new poem
 nai kavita kii vividh rachanaaon main shabd, arth, takneekee, mukt aasang, divaswapn, saahchary, puranic, prakruti sambandhi kavy bimb nirmitt kiye gayi hai
 Just like - in front of me in winter, after covering the sack, one or her own hands and feet, shivering, shaking, - he will die
 nai kavita main chand ko keval ghor asweekruti hi mili ho- yah baat nahin, balki is kshetra main vividh prayog bhi kiye gayi hai
 The new poets have neither raga nor injustice towards any medium or craft
 gatishalata ke prabhaav ke liye sangeet kii lay ko tyagkar nai kavita dhwani-parivartan kii ore badhati gai he
 The old style of writing a long poem or an entire poem, presenting a sangopang description of it with the help of a veritable subject or sentiment, has been abandoned by the new poem
 nai kavita ke kaviyon ne lambii kavitaayen bhi likhi hai
 But they are not parallel to the old management poetry

 Speech interruption is a condition of a human being in which he has difficulty in interacting in a simple way
 isamen haklaana, tutlana or anya prakaar kii vakbadhaayen shaamil hai
 Note that a speech alone cannot be called a different accent
 yadi koi vakbadha purna rup se yaa kaafii had tak kisi ko bolne main asamarth kare to use 'goongaapan' kaha jaataa he
 Speech constraints are common in humans - even if they are, people can lead successful and happy lives and many treatments are also available

 Numbers determine the way we live
 kelvin ne sankhyaon ke bare main kaha he ki aap kisi parighatna ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate yadi aap use sankhyaon ke dwaara abhivyakt nahin kar sakate
 Numbers are also important in some areas of life that are not considered so common
 kisi dhaavak ke samay main 0
001 sekkind kaa antar bhi use swarna dilaa saktaa he yaa use isse vanchit kar saktaa he
 The difference of a wheel in the diameter of a thousandth of a centimeter can make it useless for a watch
 kisi vyakti kii pahchaan ke liye uskaa telephone number, rashan card par padaa number, bank khate kaa number yaa pariksha kaa role number madadgaar hote hai
 The numbers are as old as human civilization

 From this record which dates back to 3400 BC, it is known that in ancient times people knew to write large numbers
 beshak sankhyaon kii shuruuaat misravasiyon se bhi bahut pehle hui hogi
 Adivaman did not have much to do with counting
 rahane ke liye uske paas gupha thi, bhojan ped-paudhon dwaara yaa phir hathiyaaron se shikaar karke use mil jaataa tha
 But about 10,000 years ago, when the Adivans settled in villages and started farming and animal husbandry, their life became more complicated than before

 They needed numbers to count cattle, keep track of agricultural produce, land measurement and time information

 They would dig cone-shaped emblems on wet clay with thin-edged sticks, later giving them the shape of bricks

 By repeating these symbols, they would display a number such that they used the symbol to write 1000
 yaa phir 100 kii sankhya ko das balikhte the
 The Babylonian count large numbers only through the number of 60, as we nowadays count ourselves through the number 10
 misr ke pracheen nivasee bhi badi sankhyaon kii ginati karnaa jaanate the tathaa saal main 365 din hone kii jaankaree unke paas thi
 Originally the meaning of numbers was derived from 'natural numbers'

 ☆★sanjeev kumaar 03:17, 27 sitambar 2018 Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the king of the Sikh Empire
 ve sher-e punjab ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Maharaja Ranjit was a man who not only kept Punjab united as a powerful province, but also did not allow the British to wander around his empire
 ranjit singh kaa janm san 1780 main gujranvala sandhawalia jat maharaja mahaan singh ke ghar hua tha
 In those days, Punjab was ruled by Sikhs and Afghans, who divided the whole area into many examples
 ranjit ke pita maha singh sukarchakia misal ke commander the
 Located in western Punjab, the area was headquartered in Gujranwala
 choti si umr main chechak kii vajah se maharaja ranjit singh kii ek aankh kii roshni jaati rahi
 It was only 12 years old when his father passed away and the entire burden of the Rajpat fell on his shoulders
 12 april 1801 ko ranjit ne maharaja kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 He was crowned by a descendant of Guru Nanak
 unhone lahore ko apni rajdhani banaaya or san 1802 main amritsar kii ore ruukh kiya
 Maharaja Ranjit fought many battles against the Afghans and drove them towards West Punjab
 ab peshawar samet pashtun kshetra par unheen kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 This was the first time Pashtuns were ruled by a non-muslim
 uske baad unhone peshawar, jammu kashmir or anandpur par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 He is also credited with forming the first modern Indian Army - the "sikh Khalsa Army"
 unki saraparasti main punjab ab bahut shaktishaalee suba tha
 This powerful army kept Britain from grabbing Punjab for a long time
 ek aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab punjab hi ekmaatr aisa suba tha, jis par angrejon kaa kabja nahin tha
 According to British historian JT Wheeler, if he had been a generation older, he would have conquered the whole of India
 maharaja ranjit khud anpadh the, lekin unhone apane rajya main shiksha or kala ko bahut protsaahan diya
 He established law and order in Punjab and never gave death penalty to anyone
 unka suba dharmanirpeksh tha unhone hinduon or sikhon se vasule jane vaale jajia par bhi roak lagaai
 Never forced anyone to adopt Sikhism
 unhone amritsar ke harimandir sahib gurudware main sangemarmar lagavaaya or sona madhvaaya, tabhi se use swarna mandir kaha jane laga
 The prized diamond Kohinoor was a treasure trove of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit kaa nidhan ho gaya
 His mausoleum was built in Lahore, which still remains there
 unki maut ke saath hi angrejon kaa punjab par shikanja kasnaa shuru ho gaya
 After the british-sikh War, Punjab was made part of the British Empire on 30 March 1849 and the Kohinoor was introduced at Huzur in Queen Victoria
 ranjitsingh kaa janm san 1780 i
 main hua tha
 He was a proud king of the society, Ranjitsingh became the leader of Misl Sukrachakia at the age of twelve after the death of Mahan Singh
 san 1798 i
 main jamaan shah ke punjab se laut jane par unhone lahore par adhikaar kar liya
 Gradually, from the Sutlej to the Indus, he controlled all the Muslims who were ruling
 satluj or yamuna ke bich phulakiyon misl ke shaasha rajya kar rahe the
 In 1806 AD, Ranjitsingh also tried to subdue them, but was not successful
 ranjitsingh main sainik netritv ke bahut saare gun the
 He was a visionary
 ve saanwale rang kaa nate kad ke manushya the
 One of his eyes was lost due to Sheetla's wrath
 parantu yah hote hue bhi vah tejasvi the
 So as long as he was alive, all the missiles were buried
 us samay angrejon kaa rajya yamuna tak pahunch gaya tha or phulakiyaan misl ke raja angreji rajya ke prabhutv ko maanane lage the
 The British forbade Ranjitsingh from doing this
 ranjitsingh ne angrejon se ladanaa uchit na samajha or sandhi kar lee ki satluj ke aage ham apana rajya na badhayenge
 Ranjitsingh summoned the French troops, prepared his army in a military manner, in his military command
 ab unne punjab ke dakshini, pashchimi or uttari bhaagon par akraman karnaa prarambh kiya or das varsh main multan, peshawar or kashmir tak apane rajya ko badha liya
 Ranjitsinh had captured Peshawar in his possession, but he had to fight hard for many years to take full authority over that province
 vah puure punjab kaa swami ban chukaa; or use angrejon ke hastkshep kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 But at the time when the British asked for help from the Sikhs against the Napoleonic forces, they did not receive it
 ranjitsingh ne san 1808 i
 main apni mahatvakankshini saas sadakor ke naam peshawar kaa rajya parivartit kar diya tha
 Because it was a British agent woman
 ranjitsingh ne apni kuchakrapriy saas se jhagada karke use kaid kar liya tha or hvadani ke garh ko apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 a contingent of the British army rescued the captive widow Sadakaur and recovered the authority
 british sena ke saath ranjitsingh kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin chaahate the
 The British could be accused of breaching the terms of the treaty
 isliye chupchaap maun rahakar usne taiyaariyaan prarambh kii thim phir bhi 1809 i
 main lard minto se sandhi kar lee
 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs
 uparyukt sandhi ke kaaran punjab ke afgani rajya tathaa afghanistan ko kuch had tak aantkit kar sake the
 In 1802, 1806 and 1810 AD, conquered Multan and took possession and made a treaty with Shah Shuja and kept it there and obtained a 'cohenoor diamond' for a glass of water from it
 1811 i
 main kabul ke shah mahmud ke akraman kii baat sunakar or yah jaankaar ki mahmud kaa iraadaa kashmir ke shaasha par akraman kaa he, usne kashmir par akraman kar diya taaki mahmud ko waapas janaa sambhav ho jaae or uski mitrataa bhi ise mil jaae
 After Kashmir it marched on Peshawar in 1822, Yarmuhammad Khan fought bravely leading the Afghans but was defeated in the end
 is yuddh main sikhon kaa bhi bada nuksaan hua
 Fearing Ranjitsingh's authority over Peshawar in 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan Kabulnaresh became very frightened and befriended Russia and Iran
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar angrejon ne swayan ranjitsingh tathaa shahshuja ke saath ek trigutsandhi karai
 Maharaja Ranjitsingh was becoming unwell
 1838 main lakva kaa akraman hua, yadhyapi upachaar kiya gaya or angrej doctoron ne bhi ilaaj kiya, lekin 27 june 1839 i
 ko uskaa pranant ho gaya
 It was also generous
 kaashi vishwanath mandir par jo swarnpatr aaj dikhaai detaa he vah uski kaashiyatra tathaa udaartaa kaa parichaayak he
 He set aside a property worth Rs 47 lakh for charity
 jagannathamandir par bhi vah kohenur hira chadhaanaa chahta tha lekin us heere ko to videsh main jaakar chhin-bhinn hona tha
 After the Maharaja, the Sikh state disappeared due to the inability of the Sikhs to respond to mutual disharmony, treason and English diplomacy
 baat san 1812 kii he
 Punjab was ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 us samay maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ke soobedaar atamohammad ke shikanje se kashmir ko mukt karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 Fearful of this campaign, Atma Mohammed left Kashmir
 kashmir abhiyaan ke peeche ek anya kaaran bhi tha
 Shahshuja, who was defeated by Mahmud Shah by Atamohammad, was imprisoned in the fort of Shergarh
 use kaidakhane se mukt karaane ke liye uski begum vafa begum ne lahore aakar maharaja ranjit singh se prarthana kii or kaha ki meharbaani kar aap mere pati ko atamohammad kii kaid se reeha karvaa den, is ahsaan ke badale beshkeemtee kohinoor hira aapako bhent kar duungi
 After Shahshuja was imprisoned, Wafa Begum was the ruler of Afghanistan in those days
 isi kohinoor ko hadapney ke laalach main bharat par akraman karne vaale ahamed shah abdali ke pautra jamaan shah ko swayan usee ke bhai mahmud shah ne kaidakhane main bhayankar yatnaaen dekar uski ankhen nikalava lee thim
 Zaman Shah was the son of Ahmad Shah Abdali's son Timur Shah, whose brother was Mahmud Shah
 astu, maharaja ranjaiti singh swayan chaahate the ki ve kashmir ko atamohammad se mukt karavaaen
 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli
 par vafa begum apane vaade ke anusaar kohinoor hira maharaja ranjit singh ko bhent karne main vilamb karti rahi
 Even several months passed
 jab maharaja ne shahshuja se kohinoor heere ke bare main poocha to vah or uski begum donon hi bahaane banane lage
 When more emphasis was given, he handed over a fake diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which proved to be a fake test of jewelers
 ranjit singh krodh se bhar uthe or mubarak haveli gher lee gai
 Food was not served there for two days
 varsh 1813 kii pehali june thi jab maharaja ranjit singh shahshuja ke paas aae or phir kohinoor ke vishay main poocha
 Shattered Shahshuja hid Kohinoor in his turban
 kisi tarah maharaja ko iskaa pataa chal gaya
 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri
 hindu mandiron ko manon sona bhent karne ke liye ve prasiddh the
 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi
 parantu jagannatha bhagwaan tak pahunchane kii unki ichha koshadhyaksh beliram kii kuniti ke kaaran puri na ho saki
 After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British attacked the Sikhs in 1845
 ferozepur kshetra main sikh sena veertapurvak angrejon kaa muqabla kar rahi thi
 But the commander of the Sikh army, Lalsingh, betrayed and left the front and fled to Lahore
 is kaaran vijay ke nikat pahunchakar bhi sikh sena haar gai
 The British took the Kohinoor diamond from the Sikhs
 saath hi kashmir or hajaaraa bhi sikhon se chin liye kyonki angrejon ne dedh karod rupye kaa jurmaana sikhon par kiya tha, arthabhaav-grast sikh kisi tarah keval 50 lakh rupye hi de paae the
 Lord Harding brought the Kohinoor diamond to London to please Queen Victoria of England, which was handed over to Queen Victoria by the "east India Company"
 un dinon maharaja ranjit singh ke putr dilip singh vahiin the
 Some people say that it was from Dilip Singh that the British annexed the Kohinoor in London
 kohinoor ko 1 maah 8 din tak johariyon ne taraasha or phir use rani victoria ne apane taj main jadwa liya

 Sati was the daughter of Daksha Prajapati and the consort of Lord Shiva
 inaki utpatti tathaa ant kii katha vibhinn puraanon main vibhinn roopon main uplabdh hoti he
 Due to the predominance of Lord Shiva in the Shaiva Puranas, Shiva is said to be the ultimate element and power as his follower
 isi ke samanaantar shakt puraanon main shakti kii pradhanta hone ke kaaran shakti ko paramashkti tathaa bhagwaan shiv ko unka anugami bataaya gaya he
 The Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana has a relatively neutral description
 isamen daksh kii swymbhuv manu kii putree prasuti ke garbh se 16 kanyaon ke janm kii baat kahi gayi he
 14 girls have been mentioned in Devipuran and sixty girls of Daksha have been mentioned in Shivpuran out of which 27 were married to Moon
 in kanyaon main ek sati bhi thi
 According to Shiv Puran, Brahma ji was worried about Lord Shiva's marriage, then he praised Lord Vishnu and Vishnu ji was pleased and told Brahma ji that if Lord Shiva is to get married then worship Goddess Shiva
 unhone bataaya ki daksh se kahie ki vah bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karen or unhen prasann karke apni putree hone kaa vardaan maange
 If Goddess Shiva is pleased then all the work will be successful
 unke kathananusaar brahma ji ne daksh se bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karne ko kaha or prajapati daksh ne devi shiva kii ghor tapasya kii
 Pleased with his penance, Shiva gave him a boon that i will be born as your daughter
 main to sabhi janmon main bhagwaan shiv kii daasi hoon; atah main swayan bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke unhen prasann karuungi or unki patni banungi
 At the same time, he also told Daksha that when your respect will be reduced to me, then at the same time i will abandon my body, get absorbed in my form or wear another body
 prayek sarg yaa kalp ke liye daksh ko unhone yah vardaan de diya
 Accordingly, Bhagwati Shiva takes birth as the daughter of Daksha in the name of Sati and pleases Lord Shiva by performing intense penance and is married to Lord Shiva
 iske baad kii katha shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main varnit katha ke kaaphi had tak anuroop hi he
 In Prayag, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of the Prajapati, all the gods stand and honor him, but Lord Shiva is also sitting with Brahma
 loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan maanane ke kaaran daksh unke khadey na hokar apane prati aadar prakat na karne ke kaaran apana apmaan mahasoos karata he or isi kaaran unhone bhagwaan shiv ke prati anek katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue unhen yajna bhaag se vanchit hone kaa shaap de diya
 After this, Manomalinya was born in Daksha and Lord Shiva
 tatpashchaat apni rajdhani kankhal main daksh ke dwaara ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya gaya jisamen unhone na to bhagwaan shiv ko aamantrit kiya or na hi apni putree sati ko
 Sati saw Rohini going with the moon by plane and after Sakhi came to know that they were going to take part in her father Daksha's Virat Yajna, Sati's mind was also disturbed to go there
 bhagwaan shiv ke samajhane ke baavjood sati kii vyakulata bani rahi or bhagwaan shiv ne apane ganon ke saath unhen vahaan jane kii ajna de di
 But not seeing the sacrifice of Lord Shiva going there, Sati objected and Sati consumed her body with Yogagni because of the utmost disrespectful things being said by Daksha to her and her husband Lord Shiva
 shivganon ke dwaara utpaat machaaye jane par bhrigu rishi ne dakshinagni main aahuti di or usase utpann rubhu naamak devataaon ne shivganon ko bhaga diya
 Very upset with this news, Lord Shiva produced Veerabhadra with his hair and Veerabhadra went with Gana and destroyed Daksha Yagya; Punished Shiva's adversary gods and sages as appropriate and cut Daksha's head and burnt it in the Havan Kund
 tatpashchaat devataaon sahit brahma ji ke dwaara stuti kiye jane se prasann bhagwaan shiv ne punah yajna main hui kshatiyon kii purti kii tathaa daksh kaa sir jal jane ke kaaran bakre kaa sir judwa kar unhen bhi jivit kar diya
 Then the yagna was completed by his grace
 shakt mat main shakti kii sarvapradhanta hone ke kaaran brahma, vishnu evam shiv teenon ko shakti kii krupa se hi utpann mana gaya he
 It is described in the Devi Purana that Purna Prakriti Jagadambika created three Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and appointed them in the works of creation
 unhone hi brahama ko srujankarta, vishnu ko paalankarta tathaa apni icchaanusaar shiv ko sanhaarkarta hone kaa aadesh diya
 Before obeying the order, these three started doing penance to get those divine power as their wife
 jagdambika dwaara pareekshan main asafal hone ke kaaran brahma evam vishnu ko purna prakruti ansh rup main patni banakar praapt hui tathaa bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya se param prasann hokar jagdambika ne swayan janm lekar unki patni banane kaa aashwaasan diya
 Accordingly, on being inspired by Brahma ji, Daksha meditated on the same Purna Prakriti Jagadambika and pleased with his austerity, Jagadambika gave his boon to be born as his daughter and also told that when the virtue of Daksha diminishes that power After destroying the world, she will return to her abode
 ukt vardaan ke anuroop purna prakruti ne sati ke naam se daksh kii putree rup main janm grahan kiya or uske vivaah yogya hone par daksh ne uske vivaah kaa vichaar kiya
 Daksha did not understand the influence of Lord Shiva with his cosmic intelligence and considered his disguise immortal and did not consider him worthy of Sati
 atah unhone vichaar kar bhagwaan shiv se shunya swayamvar sabha kaa aayojan kiya or sati se aagrah kiya ki ve apni pasand ke anusaar var chun le
 Seeing Lord Shiva not present, Sati put the Varmala on the Earth by saying 'shivaay Namah' and Maheshwar Shiva himself attended and received that Varmala and returned to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 daksh bahut dukhi hue
 With Sati choosing her husband as her husband against her will, Daksha's mind was filled with anger towards them both
 isiilie baad main apni rajdhani main yojit viraat yajna main daksh ne shiv evam sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya
 Yet Sati stubbornly refused to go to the yagna of her father and showed him his terrible form by being extremely angry when repeated by Shiva
 isse bhayakrant hokar shivaji ke bhaagane kaa varnan hua he or unhen rokane ke liye jagdambika ne 10 rup dhaaran kiya
 Then on Shiva's asking, he introduced his ten forms
 phir shiv ji dwaara kshamaa yachana karne ke pashchaat purna prakruti muskura kar apane pita daksh ke yajna main jane ko utsuk hui tab shiv ji ne apane gamon ko kah kar bahusankhyak singhon se jute rath mangvakar us par asin karwaakar bhagwati ko sasamman daksh ke ghar bheja
 The rest of the story is often in line with the predetermined story with certain differences, but in this tale, the enraged Sati Chasati gets interrupted by ordering Leela and the talk does not end when that Chasati is consumed, but Shiva is pleased with the yagna of perfection
 After giving the hint, the corpse of Chasanti is safely and resplendently reunited in the Yajshala of Daksha and then by Goddess Shakti in the east
 Despite being told as Ishywani Cosmic Men like Shiva mourning and wandering like neurotic holding zombies head of Sati
 isse trast devataaon ko traan dilaane tathaa paristhiti ko sanbhaalane hetu bhagwaan vishnu sudarshan chakra se sati kii laash ko kramshah khand-khand kar katate jate hai
 In this way, due to the falling of various parts of Sati and ornaments at different places, those places became full of the glory of Shaktipeeth
 is prakaar 51 shaktipeethon kaa nirmaan ho gaya
 When Sati's body was no longer there, when Lord Shiva worriedly asked the gods, the gods told him everything
 is par nirishwaas chhodte hue bhagavan shiv ne bhagwaan vishnu ko treta yug main suryvansh main avatar lekar isi prakaar patni se viyukt hone kaa shaap de diya or phir swayan 51 shaktipeethon main sarvapradhan 'kamrup' main jaakar bhagwati kii aradhana kii or us purna prakruti ke dwaara agali baar himalay ke ghar main parvati ke rup main purnavatar lekar punah unki patni banane kaa var praapt hua
 Thus, in the next birth, Sati became the daughter of Himalayas in the form of Parvati and Lord Shiva again got her wife
