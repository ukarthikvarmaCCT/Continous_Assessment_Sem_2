 He has been engaged in the research of political relations between China and India for thirty years
 shri maa ja lee ne pichley bharat-china sambandhon ke 55 varshon ko paanch bhaagon main vibhajit kiya he
 According to him, the relations between China and India were in the best period of history in the 1950s
 donon deshon ke sheersh netaaon ne tab ek-duusare ke yahaan kii anek yatraaen kin or unki janata ke bich bhi khaasi awajahi rahi
 The two countries then had close political ties
 lekin, 1960 ke dashak main china va bharat ke sambandh apane sab se sheet kaal main pravesh kar gayi
 Despite this, the friendly relations of the two are several thousand years old
 isliye, yah sheetkaal ek aitihaasik lambi nadi main ek choti lahar kii tarah hi tha
 By the mid-70s, they had once again come out of winter

 From the 1980s to the mid-1990s, relations between China and India had warmed up
 haalanki varsh 1998 main donon deshon ke sambandhon main bharat dwaara paanch misile chhodane se phir ek baar thandapan aayaa
 But it ended immediately after the Indian Foreign Minister's visit to China in 1999 with the efforts of both governments
 ab china-bharat sambandh kadam ba kadam ghanishtha ho rahe hai
 The sino-indian relations are steadily improving over the years
 china va bharat ke varisht adhikariyon ke bich awajahi badi he

 These principles have been accepted by many countries of the world and are recorded in international conferences and documents on bilateral relations

 bharat va myenmar ne swatantraaa praapt kii or baad main china ko bhi mukti mili
 Being the first to achieve independence in Asia, he found it imperative to maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries, and he needed the principle of directing the relations of different countries
 isliye, in teen deshon ke netaaon ne milakar panchasheel kaa aahvaan kiya
 Panchsheel made constructive contributions to the theoretical and real proceedings of international relations
 purv bhartiya raashtrapati narayanan ne panchasheel kii mahatvata kii charchaa is tarah kii

 In British culture, most traditional units start with a large number of counties which contain small divisions
 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties

 pehali pariyojna kii IRR kam ho sakati he lekin uski en pi ve adhik ho sakati he or isliye isko duusari pariyojna ke badale apnaanaa chahie During the project the IRR looks to consume positive cash flow
 agarsakaratmak poonji pravaah, pariyojna main waapas nivesh kar saktaa he, to ek upyukt punarnivesh dar kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki punarnivesh poonji pravaah ki gananaa karegaa or isliye poonji pravaah ke saath IRR kaa punarnivesh hota he
 When the calculated IRR is different from the actual reinvestment rate for the interim cash flow, the annual equivalent return will reflect the assessment more accurately
 The company may have additional projects that are exactly the same for investing interim cash flow
 May have attractive expectations ye iiar ko udhyam puunji ke aankalan or anya nijee equity nivesh ke liye upyukt banaata he
 Such strategies usually require a lot of cash investment during the entire project
 lekin ant main ye keval ek hi nakadi bahirpravaah ko dekhati he Since IRR does not consider the cost of capital, it should not be used to compare projects with different periods
 sanshodhit aantarik pratifal dar puunji kii laagat ko maanata he or form kii chhot nakadi pravaah ke yogadan main ek pariyojna kii kshamta kaa ek behatar sanket detaa he
 In the case of positive cash flows, behind which negative cash flows persist, the IIR may have multiple values
 is maamle main ek chhut dar kaa upyog nakadi pravaah ko uddhrut karne ke liye or IRR kii gananaa ko nivesh nakadi pravaah ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This example applies when a customer makes a deposit before making a specific machine
 nakadi pravaah kii shrinkhalaa main, jaise ki ek shuruuaati nivesh kii gayi dhan raashi, isliye adhik dar vaala pratifal sabase acha hota he, lekin phir usapar ek se adhik logon kaa adhikaar hota he
 So one is indebted to someone else's money, so now low rate returns are the best
 is maamle main ye baat spasht nahin he ki adhik IRR behatar he yaa kam irr
ek pariyojna main anekon IRR ho sakate hai, jaisaa kii udahaaran main 0% bhi he or 10% bhi he
 Examples of such projects are block mines and nuclear power plants, where there is usually a large cash outflow at the end of the project
 saamanytah, IRR kii gananaa bahupad samikar ko hal karke kiya ja saktaa he
 If there is a truly unique solution to the equation, the Starm formula can then be used
 saamanytah IRR sameekaran kaa vishleshnatmak tareeke se hal nahin dhundha ja saktaa he lekin isko punraritiya ke tareeke se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 When a project has multiple irrs, it can be even easier to calculate the project with the benefit of its reinvestment, according to the MIRR, which has an estimated reinvestment rate, usually this rate is equal to the cost of the project
 Is equal
 en pi ve kii majboot shaikshik pasand ke baavjood, surveykshanon se sanket miltaa he ki adhikari IRR ko NPV kii jagah zyada mahatv dete hai
 Generally, managers find it easier to compare investments of different sizes, if they are about the percentage of return rate from dollars of NPV
 However, NPV is still "more accurate" in terms of trade value
 ek nivesh kushalta ke parimaap ke rup main, IRR, poonji niyantran karne jaisi halaaton main behatar antardrushti rakhata he
 However, when comparing mutually specific projects, NPV is the appropriate measure
 ganitiya nivesh ke mulya main vaapasi kii kuch dar ke hisaab se guzarana laga, ganit ke anusaar nivesh ke mulya kaa upyog kuch pratifal daron ke anusaar ghaateey vruddhi yaa kshay kaa anumaan lagane ke liye kiya jaataa he 
 yah anumaan nakadi pravaah asatatyata ke saath chalati he or kisi shrinkhalaa kii nakadi pravaah kii IRR ko kisi bhi tarah kaa pratifal dar jiskaa parinaam shunaya shuddh vartmaan mulya ho ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 Thus the internal rate or rates follow the net present value as a function of the rate of return
 is prakriya nirantar he
 If we move towards the rate of return of -100% net present value, the net present value moves towards infinity with the sign of the previous cash flow and the positive infinite of the rate of return, the net present value goes towards the first cash flow
 Therefore, if there are different signs of the first and last cash flows, then there is an internal rate of return
 bina IRR ke samay shrinkhalaa kaa udhaaharan : The total value of cash flows changes as the time between positive and negative cash flows after positive series, especially in the case of negative cash flows
 pratifal dar ke parinaam kaary, sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak anant se nirantar or ek saamaan tareeke se kam hote rahete hai, isliye ek adwitiya pratifal dar he, jiske liye yah shunaya heisaliye IRR bhi adwitiya he
 However, it is not necessary in its entire field that NPV is also decreasing in a similar way on IRR
 isi prakaar, vishesh rup se sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah or vishesh rup se nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main IRR bhi adwitiya hota he Veerchand Gandhi was a nineteenth-century Jain scholar who became a Jain representative at the famous Dharma Sammelan in Chicago, which earned Swami Vivekananda fame

 ab caliph ne hathiyaar daalane kii sochi lekin mongolon ne baat karne se inkaar kar diya or 13 farvari ko baghdad shahar main ghus aaye
 Thereafter, they murdered, raped and looted there for a week

 tikoni frem ke banane main dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uski naliyon kii madhya rekhaayen ek hi samtal main rahen
 The front steering end of the frame, the handle stalk, and the front lines of the front tongs should coincide
 donon taru ke chimaton kii bhujaayen bhi unki madhya rekha se samamit tathaa samaantar honi chahie

 Third nerve palsy in relatively common conditions related to diabetic neuropathy; Mononeuropathy; Mononeuropathy multiplex; Diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; Autonomic neuropathy; And thoracoabdominal neuropathy
 madhumehi neuropathy kaa asar sabhi paridhiy nason: dardakaari fibre, motor neurons, autonomik nason par padataa he
 Therefore, it may necessarily affect all organs and mechanisms because all are connected through nerves
 prabhavit ang tantron or sadasyon ke aadhaar par kai spasht syndrome hote hai lekin ve anany katai nahin hai
 a patient may have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination
 prabhavit nason ke aadhaar par lakshanon main antar hota he or unamem soochibaddh lakshanon ke alaava anya lakshan bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Symptoms usually develop gradually from year to year
 lakshanon main nimna shaamil ho sakate hai: It is believed that four factors are involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy: sanvahani or tantrika rogon kaa aapas main bahut gaharaa or najdiki sambandh he
 Blood vessels depend on normal nerve function and nerves depend on adequate blood flow
 microwasculechar main pehla pathological parivartan vaisoconstriction he
 As the disease progresses, the relationship of neuronal dysfunction deepens with the development of vascular abnormalities such as thickening of the capillary basement membrane and endothelial hyperplasia that contribute to reduced oxygen tension and hypoxia
 neuronal iskemia madhumehi neuropathy kii ek supratishthit visheshta he
 Vasodilator agents can result in substantial improvement in neuronal blood flow and accordingly improve nerve conduction velocity
 is prakaar, microwascular disfunction madhumeh ke aarambhik daur main neural disfunction kii pragati ke saath hota he or yah madhumehi neuropathy main dekhe jane vaale sanrachanaatmak, kaaryaatmak or clinical parivartanon kii gambhirtha ko sahaara dene ke liye kaaphi ho saktaa he
 High intracellular levels of glucose result in non-enzymatic covalent bonding with proteins that alter their structure and hinder their function
 inamen se kuch glycosilated protein madhumehi neuropathy or madhumeh kii anya dirghakaalik jatiltaaon kii pathology main shaamil hai
 PKC is involved in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy
 glucose ke str main vruddhi ke falswaroop antarkoshikeey diacilglaiceral main vruddhi hoti he jo pikisi ko sakriy karata he
 PKC inhibitors in animal models will increase nerve conduction velocity by increasing neuronal blood flow
 sorbital / eldose ridctes maarg ke naam se bhi jane jane vaala poliol maarg madhumehi jatiltaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he jisaki vajah se tantrika utak or retina or kidney main bhi microwascular kshati kaa parinaam bhugatna padataa he
 Glucose is a highly reactive compound and needs to be converted by metabolic activity or it will get the tissue present in the body to react
 Like in cases of diabetes, increased levels of glucose activate this biochemical pathway, which results in a decrease in glutathion and an increase in reactive oxygen radicals
 yah maarg anzime eldose ridctes par nirbhar karata he
 The inhibitors of this enzyme have been shown to be effective in animal models in preventing the development of neuropathy
 jabaki koshika main pravesh paane ke liye adhikansh shaareerik koshikaon ko glucose ke liye insulin kii kriya kii jarurat padati he, retina, kidney or tantrika utakon kii koshikaayen insulin par nirbhar nahin karti hai
 Therefore, regardless of insulin action in the eye, kidney and neurons, there is a free exchange of glucose from the inner part of the cell to the outer part
 koshikaayen saamaanya rup se urja ke liye glucose kaa istemaal karegi or urja ke liye na istemaal kiya jane vaala glucose poliol maarg main pravesh karegaa or sorbetol main badal jayega

 However, in the hyperglycemic state there is an increase in the similarity of the aldose reductase to glucose which means that the level of sorbitol increases significantly and the level of NADPH decreases which is a compound that is used when this pathway is used
 Gets activated
 sorbetol koshika jhilliyon ko paar nahin kar saktaa he or jab yah ekatra ho jaataa he to yah koshika main pani khinchakar koshikaon par osmotic dabaav utpann karata he
 Fructose does basically the same thing and is formed and further in the chemical pathway
 maarg ke sakriy hone ke dauraan istemaal kiya jane vaala enedipiech nitric oxide or glutathian utpaadan ko badhaava dene kaa kaam karata he or maarg main iske roopantaran ke falswaroop pratikriyasheel oxigen anuon kaa parinaam dekhne ko miltaa he
 Glutathian deficiency may result in hemolysis due to oxidative pressure, and we already know that nitric oxide is an important vasodilator of blood vessels
 NAD+, iskaa bhi istemaal hota he, koshikaon ko banane or nasht karne se pratikriyasheel oxigen prajatiyon ko alag rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 In addition, elevated levels of sorbitol are believed to decrease the cellular uptake of another alcohol, myoinsitol, by further decreasing the activity of the Na + / k + attenuate pump, the plasma membrane required for nerve function, which further contributes to neuropathy
 sankshep main poliol maarg ke atyadhik sakriyan ke falswaroop sorbetol or pratikriyasheel oxigen anuon kaa str bad jaataa he or nitric oxide or glutathian kaa str ghat jaataa he or iske saath hi saath koshika jhilli par osmotic dabaav bad jaataa he
 Any one of these elements can promote cell damage, but here we see several elements active together
 vibhinn tantrikas yaa nasen alag-alag tarah se prabhavit hoti hai Larger nerve fibers have a much greater effect than shorter nerve fibers because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to nerve length

 Autonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems
 madhumehi main sabase aam taur par manyata praapt autonomik disfunction orthostetic hypotension yaa khadey hone ke dauraan behoshee he
 In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, this is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to correctly adjust the heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood flowing continuously and completely to the brain
 is lakshan kaa saath aam taur par saamaanya shwaas ke saath dekhe jane vaale hriday dar main saamaanya parivartan kii haani detii he
 Both of these findings suggest autonomic neuropathy

 Again, urinary tract infections often result in urinary obstruction
 mutr avarodhan kii vajah se blader divertikula, stone, reflux nephropathy kaa parinaam bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Oculomotor neuropathy is most common when cranial nerves are affected
 okulomotor tantrika sabhi mansapeshiyon ko niyantrit karti hai jo parshv rectus or behatar tirchhi mansapeshiyon ke apwaad ke saath aankh ko andolit karti hai
 It also works to narrow the pupil and open the eyelid
 madhumehi tritiy tantrika pakshaaghaat kaa akraman aam taur par achaanak hota he jisaki shuruyaat frontal or periorbital dard se or uske baad diplopia se hoti he
 All oculomotor muscles delivered by the third nerve can be affected, but the muscles that control the size of the pupil are generally already well preserved
 aisa isliye he kyonki putali ke aakaar ko prabhavit karne vaale CNIII ke bheetar parachimpathetic tantrika tantu tantrika kii paridhi par paae jate hai jo unhen isckemik kshati ke prati kam samvedansheel banaate hai

 There may be mononeuropathy of the nerves of the thoracic or groin and can result in painful syndromes that resemble myocardial infarction, cholecystitis, or appendicitis
 diabetec yaa madhumeh ke rogiyon main entrapment neuropathy kii ghatana bahut zyada hoti he jaise carpal tunnel syndrome
 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is largely similar to the diagnosis of someone with diabetes who has pain in the feet or legs, although it may also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or osteoarthritis
 jarnal of da american medical association kii "rashnal clinical ejamination siries" main haal hi kii ek samiksha main madhumehi paridhiy neuropathy ke diagnosis main clinical pariksha kii upyogita kaa moolyankan kiya gaya

 yah isvi samvath se 300 varsh purv kii ghatana he
 These stories attempt to explain policy and religion through entertainment
 jataka khuddak nikaay kaa dasavaan prasiddh granth he
 It would be more appropriate to call Jataka as the book of texts rather than as a text
 uskaa koi-koi kathanak puure granth ke rup main he or kahin-kahin uski kahaniyon kaa rup sankshipt mahakavy-sa he
 The word Jataka is made of mass metal
 iskaa arth he bhoot athwa bhav
 This word is formed by adding the suffix 'kat' to the 'jan' metal
 dhaatu ko bhoot arth main prayukt karte hue jab arth kiya jaataa he to jatbhoot katha evam rup banataa he
 jat-jani-janan-janam meaning is used when used in the Bhava sense
 is tarah ‘jataka’ shabd kaa a rth he, ‘jaat’ arthath janm-sambandhin
 'jataka' is the stories related to the pre-birth of Lord Buddha
 buddhatv praapt kar lene kii avasthaa se purv bhagavan buddha bodhisattva kehalaate hai
 They are candidates for enlightenment at that time and practice the ten perfections or perfections of charity, piety, friendship, truth, etc
 bhoot-dayaa ke liye ve apane praanon kaa anek baar balidaan karte hai
 In this way, they perform the ability of intelligence
 bodhisattva shabd kaa arth hi he bodhi ke liye udyogshil praani
 For Bodhi, Sattva, which is also said by some scholars
 pali sutton main ham anek baar padhate hai, ‘‘sambodhi praapt hone se pehle, buddha na hone ke samay, jab main bodhisattva hi tha‘‘ aadi
 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ‘‘pannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo ‘jataka’ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh but it does not seem to be right

 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE

 In relation to the time and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the past is linked with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter who hunted from the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 Jatakathakatha's Nidan Katha tells about three Nidas of Buddha life, Dure Nidan is the story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part under Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the plot is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All of this leads to the conclusion that the Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant
 bhashastyli kii bhinnata dikhaate hue or kuch anya nishedhaatmak kaaran dete hue dow tii
 dablyoo rais davids ne buddhaghosh ko jatakatthawannana kaa rachayita yaa sankalankarta nahin mana he
 Introducing himself in the subtraction of the scripture, the author has said, " xxrep 4 
 Shantichitta Pandit Buddhist monk Buddhadev will explain xxrep 8

 The eight chronicles Buddhaghosa has written are based on the teaching method of pure monastic monks
 atah jatakatthakatha ke lekhak ko acharya buddhaghosh se milaanaa thik nahin
 Probably it was some other Sinhalese monk, whose period can be considered as fifth century AD
 isamen nimnlikhit kathaayen sammilit hai: Tripitak jataka-kathaayen bhagwaan buddha ke purvajanmon se sambandhit hai
 The descriptions of the bodhisattva are described in them
 atah ve sabhi praayah upadeshaatmak he
 But his literary form has also flourished
 upadeshaatmak hote hue bhi ve puure arthon main kalatmak he
 There is a nidan-katha in the beginning of the Jataka, in which the description of the first 24 Buddhas of Lord Buddha, as well as a biography of Lord Gautama Buddha, till the donation of Latavan Vihar has been approved

 From the point of view of chronology, the story of Shunshape of Vedic literature, yama-yami dialogues, Pururva Urvashi dialogues, etc
, can be the story of pre-buddha era
 chaandogya or brihadaaranyak aadi kuch upanishdon kii aakhyayikaaye bhi buddha purv kaal kii maani ja sakati he, or isi prakaar aitarey or shatapath brahman ke kuch aakhyaan bhi buddha purv kaal kii maane ja sakate hai

 isi prakaar sinhalai vidwaan malalsekar kaa kahana he ki jataka kaa sambandh bhartiya sahitya kii us aakhyaan-vidha se he, jisase uttarkalin mahakavyon kaa vikaas hua he
 While comparing the Jataka with Ramayana and Mahabharata, we should keep in mind that not all the portions of these two texts belong to the pre-buddha era
 ramayana ke vartmaan rup main 2400 shloke paye jate hai
 It has been said in the Ramayana, 'chaturvinsh Sahasrani Shlokanam said vaan sage
 kintu buddha mahavibhasha-shaastra se siddh he ki dwitiya shatabdi isvi main bhi ramayana main keval 12,000 shloke the

 The Buddhist adjective Chaturmaharajik has also come there
 romak logon kaa bhi varnan he
