 Prabandhchintamana was composed on the full moon date of Vaishakhamas of 1361 Vikram Samvatsar
 is granth ke rachanaakaar merutung hai
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhchintamani that the son of Mlechharaj attacked Prithviraj, the ruler of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha, in order to save his father from insulting him
 ghori ne purnsajjataa ke saath prithviraj ke rajya par akraman kar diya
 But fearing the arrogance of archers of Prithviraj's army, Ghori ran away with his army
 prithviraj ne ghori kaa peechha kiya
 On the way, some officer of the food department said to Prithviraj, o Rajan! Please donate seven hundred camels
 uskaa vachan sunakar prithviraj ne pratyuttar diya ki, sarvapratham mlechhraj ko markar uske ooton ko apane adheen karuunga, tatpashchaat tumhaari ichhaapoorti hogi
 Then the king was determined to try further, so a prince named Someshwar told Prithviraj not to go after Mlechraj
 someshwar ke vachanon se cruddh prithviraj ne uske kaan kaat liye
 Someshwar, defeated by Prithviraj, became active in favor of Mlechraj
 someshwar ne ghori ke saath dirghakaal tak yojana banaakar uskaa vishwasarjan kiya
 He continues to give Ghori the confidence that he will win in front of Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat ghori ne ekadshi tithi ko prithviraj kii sena par akraman kar diya
 When the army of Mlechraja attacked the kingdom of Sapadalaksha, Prithviraj was in Ghadnidra after Parana
 ghori ke sainikon ne un par akraman kar unako bandi bana liya
 Prithviraj, who was made a prisoner by Ghori, lived in Ajmeru-prasada as a prisoner till Ekmas
 ek maas ke pashchaat ekadshi tithi par prithviraj jab poojamagn the, tab mlechhraj ne unako pakvamance khaane ke liye bheja
 Prithviraj was still worshiped at the time of meal, so his attention was not on the meat
 parantu bahukaal vyateet ho jane par ek kukkur prithviraj ke shibir main pravisht hua
 The cook ate that meat
 kukkur ko maance lekar ja rahaa dekh shibir ke pratihaari ne prithviraj ko puchha, kyon aapane bhojan kii raksha nahin kii?
 Prithviraj replied that, whose food was unable to carry even seven camels, such is the condition of his food
 ye sab main ananukool hokar dekh rahaa hoon
 After that a Pratihari asked Prithviraj with anger, is there still so much power left? Answering him, Prithviraj said, if i reach my place, then i should tell my physical strength
 prithviraj ke saath pratihaari kii jo charchaa hui, us charchaa ke samachar ghori ko bhi mili
 Enraged, he took Prithviraj to ajayameru-prasad
 usne prasaad ke rajsinghaasana par baithne ke liye prithviraj ko aadesh diya
 Thereafter, Ghori suffered from seeing the pictures around the throne
 rajsinghaasana ke chaaron or prithviraj ne mlecchon ko maarthe hue shukaron ke chitra prasthaapit kiye the
 Then, in anger, Ghori shook the Prithviraj, located on the throne from Parshu

 In this book, Ajmeru has been described as the place of death of Prithviraj

 It is mentioned that, ghori ne pehle jitne bhi yuddh prithviraj ke saath kiye the, un yudhon kaa samaran karte hue ghor ne prithviraj ko dekha or sochane laga ki, "jaise mrigon se singh ajey hota he, vaise hi ye hamaare liye ajey hai"
 So at night, Ghori sent his confidants to Prithviraj's ashwala
 jinhone ashwadhipati ko or tooryavadak ko utkoch ke rup main aseemit suvarnamudra di
 Even in the last night of the night, the soldiers of Prithviraj attacked the soldiers

 Seeing the status of the sangram, Bharteshwar mounted on the horse of the theater, sent by Prithviraj Ashwapalak

 Prithviraj started a war with many Yavanayanikas

 After that, all the soldiers came together and attacked Prithviraj

 Prithviraj's interest in his life and food disappeared after his arrest
 kisine mlechhadhipati ko nivedan kiya ki, "bharateshwar prithviraj ne tuje anek baar chhod diya tha, kya tum unhen ekbar bhi nahin chhodoge?"
 Hearing that person's words, Kudd Ghori said, "that is why these Hindus are inferior to political secrets"
 tatpashchaat ghori ne prithviraj ko anya durg ke karagaar main bhej diya
 Krur Yavan blinded Prithviraj in prison

 skanda or vaaman
 Skanda and Vamana were members of Prithviraj's cabinet
 skanda senapati tha or vaaman sandhivigrahakarta
 Lakshmidhar, the Vamana's protagonist in Virudhvidhyavidhyavansa, writes that, when Ghori had the first Narayan war with Prithviraj, Skanda gave an extraordinary performance
 dwitiyayuddh main jab prithviraj parajeet hue, tab sindhivigrahakarta vaaman ne ajmeru ke rajkosh se 2,002,000 dramm-mudraaen chori kar lee or bhaag gaya

 'kanhad de Prabandh' is Padmanabha, the author of poetry
 i
 1455 main is kavy kii prastuti hui thi
 Padmanabha was a Brahmin of the Visalanagara-sect
 ye padmanabh jalaur pradesh ke shaasha kanhadadev ke paanchaven vanshaj akhairaj ke raajakavi the
 By the order of Akhairaj, he composed a poem called "kanhad de Prabandha"
 is kavy kii bhashaa 'gurjarrajasthani' hi
 The battle that took place in 1368 Vikram Samvatsar with the king of Jalore state, Kanhad de Chauhan, with King Alauddin Khalji of Dehli, is counted among the important and famous wars of history
 yadhyapi 'kanhad de chouhan' jaanata the ki, yavansainikon ne jalauradurg ke upar chaaron disha se akraman kiya he or vijay kaa koi bhi maarg shesh nahin he, tathaapi kulparampara ke rakshanarth 'kanhad de chouhan' ne apane putr viramdev ke saath durg se baahar nikalakar yuddh kiya
 Both of those father-son died outside Jalaurdurga
 allaudin khalji ke kanhad de chouhan ke saath jo yuddh kiya, uskaa kaaran "kanad de prabandh" naamak granth main prapya hota he
 Padmanabha mentions in his poem titled "kanhad de Prabandha" that Sitai, the daughter of Alauddin Khalji, loved Veeramdev
 vah viramdev ke saath hi vivaah karnaa chaahati thi
 But marriage with an alien woman was unfit for Viramdev
 kyonki vah sochataa tha ki, is prakaar vijaateey vivaah karne se purvajon kaa apmaan hoga
 Although Feroza knew why Veeram Dev was repeatedly rejecting his request, Feroza wrote letters to Veeram Dev several times
 firoza kaa kathan tha ki, main purvajanm main prithviraj kii padmavati naamak raji thi
 So we both love not only this birth, but also many births
 to kripaya mere pranaynivedan ko asweekaar na karen
 The following is what Firoja said to Veeramdev

 After removing the uterus of that cow, he had done his mechanical method on that uterus

 'javaami ul hikaayat' granth kii rachana moulana nasruddin mohammad uphi ne kii thi
 AD 1211 is considered to be the creation of that book
 usne ullekh kiya he ki, jab donon senaayen ranangan main sameep pahuchin, tab donon senon ke sainikon dwaara shibiron kaka nirmaan kiya gaya
 But Ghori had already ordered his soldiers to collect many wood
 kyonki uski yojana thi ki, shibir ke sammukh ham agni ko prajvalit rakhkar shatruon ko bhramit karengen
 We will reach the enemy's backyard at night by another route
 tatpashchaat brahmamuhoort main hi upar akraman kar denge
 Ghori's plan was successful, and the soldier, who was situated in Shibir, remained seated on the night before Shibir
 jisase prithviraj ke sainikon ne sochaa ki, turksena saamne kii shibir main hi he
 Ghori, along with his soldiers, traveled to Puri night and reached the back of the 'cola' shibir
 tatpashchaat aksmaat hi ghori ne prithviraj kii sena ke upar akraman kar diya
 yavansanis killed many Hindusanis in that attack

 But then the elephants of his army became uncontrolled and a situation of disturbance arose in the army
 phir cola ko ghori ne bandi bana liya

 Ajayameru Rai was freed, but he had a grudge for the youth in his heart

 When Ghori became aware of his conduct, he ordered the slaying of Ajayameru Raj
 tatpashchaat motiyon se jadit talwaar se ajayameru raay kaa shirishchhed kiya gaya
 By the order of Ghori, Ajaymeru Rai's head was sent to his son
 'tabakaate nasiri' granth kaa lekhak abu umr minhazuddin osman bin sirajuddin mohammad jujajani tha
 The creation of that book is believed to be AD 1259-60

 But there he was imprisoned by the civilians

 Govindarai of Dehli was also arrested and his head was presented to Ghori in front of him

 But Prithviraj did not reject 'bait', then Ghori murdered him
 
 The author of the book 'futuhussalatin' was Isami

 Ghori ordered his coronation
 phutuhussataleen granth main keval itnaa hi varnanan praapt hota he
 But in it, description of the Kavachan called 'karva' and the names of the generals of Ghori are also obtained

 His ancestors belonged to the 'hindu Shahia' dynasty of the border regions of Panjab region and Afghanisthan region

 But in the year 1582 AD, Angel went with her father to the Raj Bhavan of Murtaza Nizam Shah, the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmednagar, Maharashtra
 tab vah baarah varshiya tha
 There, Farishta's father was appointed as a teacher

 farista 'shiya' naamak panth kaa yavan tha
 He did not have many friends in Ahmed-nagar

 While living in Bijapur, he composed a book called Tawarikh by the order of Ibrahim shah-ii
 i
 1606 varsh main vah granth purna purna hua
 The book in which the description of the Narayan war is received is named 'gulshane-ibrahimi'
 vah granth 'tarikhe farista' ke naam se hi prasiddh he
 It is mentioned in the book that, Pithorarai Kichitta had gone away, when the Turksanis arrested him
 phir ghori ne uskaa vadh kar diya
 In the Akbari text, it is mentioned that in the end, the king was imprisoned in battle
 uske pashchaat ghori unako lekar gazani pradesh chalaa gaya
 Chandrabardayi also reached there to maintain his loyalty
 chandabaradaayi ne ghori kaa vishwasarjan karke uski seva main niyukt hua
 Chandbaradiyi learned about the work of Prithviraj by his efforts and by consoling with Prithviraj, he consoled Prithviraj
 chandabarayi ne prithviraj ko bolaa ki, "main ghori ke sammukh aapaki dhanurvidya kii prashansa karunga or use aapkaa kaushal dekhne ke liye sajj karunga
 At that time, you should kill him by chance "
 chandabaradaayi kii yojana kaa samarthan karte hue prithviraj dhanurvidyakaushal kaa pradarshan karne ke liye sajj ho gayi
 Then he killed Ghori with only one arrow
 ghori kii hatya dekhakar uske sainikon ne chandabaradaayi or prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 In the end, they killed both of them
 bhartiyarot main jaise sabhi lekhakon kaa varnan bhinn he, vaise hi farsibhasha ke lekhakon kaa varnan bhi bhinn hi he
 Many writers in the Persian texts believe that Prithviraj died in the battlefield
 bhartiyalekhakon dwaara or farsi-lekhakon dwaara jo kuch bhi varnan apane granthon main upasthaapit kiya gaya he, us varnan kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya gaya or un kathanon ko teen bhaag main vibhakt kiya gaya
 Each author gives different details about the death of Narayana Yuddha, Prithviraj's death and Ghori's death
 bhartiyalekhak or farsilekhak apane varnananusaar teen vibhaag main vibhakt hai
 In the description of the Narayana war, which Indian writers and Persian writers have given various descriptions, those narratives are divided into three divisions
 narin yuddh kaa varnan karne vaale ek varg kaa can he ki, prithviraj bandi avasthaa main gazani pradesh main the
 Then his friend Chandbaradayi reached there
 un donon ke sammilit prayaason se ghori kii mrityu hui
 Then both of them committed suicide
 prithviraj raso kavy kaa kathanak yahi he
 The description of 'aine Akbari' is akin to Prithviraj Raso poetry, but in that poetry the writer has not given any description of the situation
 surjancharitamahakavy main prithviraj raso kavy ke sadrush varnan praapt hota he
 But there seems to be more segregation than Rasokavya
 surjancharit ke anusaar ghori ke vadh ke pashchaat chand or prithviraj gazani pradesh se sakushal palaayan karne main safal hue
 Then both of them died in Sapradalakshtra
 ek varg he jiskaa kathan he ki, prithviraj kii mrityu narin yuddh ke samay ranangan main hi gai thi
 Prominently in that category are the texts of Persian language 'tabakate Nasiri', 'futuhussalatin' and 'gulshane Ibrahimi'
 bhartiyarot main keval do granth hai
 Virudhvidhyavidhyavansa and ‘kanhad de Prabandha’
 narin ke yuddh main prithviraj ko bandi karke ghori unako ajayameru ke prasaad main le gaya, phir prithviraj ne ghori ke viruddh yojana banaai, jiskaa gyaan ghori ko ho gaya
 At that time, Ghori ordered the slaughter of Prithviraj, the texts in which these descriptions are found, are included in this class
 'tajul masir', 'jamiul hikaayat', 'miraate masudi' or 'jammu kii tawaarikh' ityadi farsigrantho main esa varnan praapt hota he
 In the Indian texts, the ancient epics, Prabandha Chintamani: The meaning of both these texts is the same, but according to the description of Jainatmanyayan Nayanchandasuri, Prithviraj gave up his life in a prison in Ajayameru
 vibhinn granthon ke varnan ke anugun siddh nahin hota ki, kiski mrityu ?, kahan ?, kaise ? or kab ? hui thi
 But only on the basis of the evidence can be proved, whose death ?, where ?, how? And when? It was then
 atah kram se ghori kii or prithviraj kii mrity ke pramaan kaa vishleshan kiya gaya
 Ghori did not die at the hands of Prithviraj in the Ghazni region, but fourteen years after the death of Prithviraj, there is evidence of Ghori's presence
 ghori kii mrityu hindooon ne hi kii thi
 Numerous evidences are found regarding Ghori's death
 'tajul masir' granth kaa lekhak hasan nijaami tha
 He mentions in his book that, after suppressing the hollows, Ghori had been living in India and going back to Ghazni region
 jab vah dhamek pradesh ke sameep pahunchaa, tab vahaan kumud or chamelichameli jaise pushpon se sugandhit udyaan main shibir banaai
 When Ghori was engaged in evening prayer, some people came there

 In that Shibir, when Ghori was under sleep in the mid-term, some Hindus attacked the Shibir by crossing the river

 So they were waiting for an opportunity to kill Ghori for a long time for vengeance

 Therefore, according to Ghori's order, the shibir covers were kept open by the soldiers, so that the airflow in the shibir remained uninterrupted
 phir ghori ke sevakon dwaara jab aavaran anaachhadit kiya gaya, tab hindooon ne us suavasar ko jaan liya
 The Hindu group then sat in hiding at some place near the army at night

 When Hindus entered Ghori's Shabir, Ghori was under sleep

 But seeing the weapon in the hands of Hindus, they sat idolized
 phir hindooon ne nidramagn ghori ko maar diya

 All the trauma could be seen directly on Ghori's body

 Some say he was decorating for a military visit, some say he was engaged to visitors

 The essence of the opinion of various authors is that Ghori was killed by twenty people originating in a dynasty from among Hindus, Gakkhs, Mulhida, Fidaiyan, Khokhar, Ismaili, Karamata etc
 ukt itihaaskaar ke varnanon main kiskaa varnan satya he or kiskaa asaty? ye gyaan to pramaanon se hi praapt hota he
 Historians are of the opinion that a group of 20 people killed a king like Ghori in this matter

 There is evidence in the dhi-rajavali that Ghori ruled the Indian states till 1192 + 14 = 1206 AD
 phir sindhunadi ke tir par hindooon ke dwaara maaraa gaya 
 Combined currencies of Prithvirajatari and Ghori are available
 itihasvid sandeh karte hai ki, antim kaal main prithviraj ne ghori ke saath sandhi kar lee thi kya? parantu ant main paaya gaya ki, un donon kii sanyuktamudraayen prithviraj ke paraajay ke anantar ghori ne praja ke vidroh se rakshan praapt karne hetu prakashit kii thi
 The joint publications of Prithvirajasya and Ghori were first published by the eminent numerologist named Edward Thomas
 unke kathananusaar unako vishwaas hi nahin tha ki, prithviraj kii ghori ke saath sanyuktamudra ho bhi sakati he
 Because of the defeat of Prithviraj in the Narayan war, Ghori took him to Ajayameru, then Ghori murdered him by giving him a physical anguish in prison
 atah sandehshil edward thoms ne general kaningham ko praapt mudraayen bataai
 General Cunningham read the existing letters in the obverse and back of that pose
 us samay general kaningham ke paas waisi hi mudraayen anuplabdh thim
 But the currencies given by Edward Thomas made available joint currencies
 general kaningham or edward thoms ke paas jaisi mudraayen thim, waisi hi mudraayen nelson rit ke paas bhi thim
 Although all three had joint currency of Prithviraj and Ghori, the weight of those postures was different
 1
 edward thoms dwaara sangruhit mudraayen :- bhaar - 36 gren, agrabhag – ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag – nandi mahamad sam 
 2
 Mudra adopted by General Kanigham: - Vyas 55 ”, weight 55 grains, front part - Ashwarohi Prithviraj, back page - Nandi Mahmad Sama
 3
 nelson rit dwaara sangruhit mudraayen :- vyas 55”, bhaar 55 gren, ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag – nandi mahamad sam Thoms, presenting the findings after studying the said Samudra Mudras, said that these postures were published by Govand, son of Prithviraj
 usne apni satta kii manyata ke liye apane pita tathaa tatkaaleen shaasha ghori ke naam se mudraayen prakashit kii 
 According to the conclusion of General Kunningham, Prithviraj was a feudal lord of Ghori till the time
 atah sanyuktamudraayen prakashit kii gai
 
 nelson rit ke nishkarsh anusaar prithviraj ke paraajay ke pashchaat ghori ne ajayameru par swadhipaty sthapit karnaa chaha
 Therefore, he himself published these postures
 kaningham or nelson ke nishkarsh ke saath swamat yojit kar kunvaradevi singh mandava bhi "ghori ne wein mudraayen prakaashik kii thi" aisa ullekh karti hai
 Kunvaradevi argues that Ghori must have published the Samudra Mudras to change the mood of the subjects and to spread the message "prithviraj is his subordinate king"
 usamen uskaa rajnatik laabh ye tha ki, "prithviraj ne ghori ke shashan ko angikaar kiya" ye sandesh kisi vidroh kii sthiti ko janm nahin degaa
 She further states that, as the currency was circulated in the name of mughal-king Shah Alam II by the 'east India Company' to gain the benefit of the subject's mind, it led to the belief in the rule of the Mughal Empire in the subjects
 
 vaise hi tab hua hoga 
 According to Dr
 Dasharatha Sharma, the combined money presented by Edward Thomas is the main reason that Ghori wanted to give power to Prithviraj as the feudal kingdom of Sapradalaksh
 dow dineshchandra ne apane ko mudra ke sandarbh main vaastavik nishkarsh kaa pramaan dene main asamarth bataaya parantu unhone mat diya ki wein mudraayen aadhikarik rup se rajkeey mudranalayon main nahin, api tu anya swaichhak santhaaon dwaara mudrita kii gai hongi
 In various texts, it is said that Prithviraj was killed in the battlefield of Narayan
 parantu aitihaasik prishthbhumi, yudhoddesh or ghatnakram ke aadhaar par yudhakshetra main prithviraj kii mrityu ke samband main nirnay apramanikat mana jaataa he
 Ghori's invasion of India had two main motives
 prapratham to bharat ke dhan kaa lunthan or apane dharm kaa vistaar
 Ghori's victory in the battle of Narayan fulfilled his first wish
 parantu prithviraj ke 'islam' dharm angikaran kaa uskaa dwitiya uddesh avshisht tha
 Therefore Prithviraj's life was inevitable
 ghori kii dwitiya ichha ke pramaan vibhinn granthon main prapya hai
 The book named tajul-masir mentions that, when Ghori reached Lahore with his army, he sent an envoy named Kawamulmulk Ruknuddin Hamza to Ajayemaru Prasad
 ghori ne sandesh bheja tha ki, tum apane kaanon main daastaa ke aabhushan pahan kar meri rajsabha main upasthit ho jaao or 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karo
 It is mentioned in the angel that when Ghori reached Lahore, his trusted envoy, named Kavamulmulk Ruknuddin Hamza, sent him to Ajayemaru Prasad
 uske saath sandesh bheja tha ki, 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karo
 It is further mentioned in the angel that Prithviraj was very angry after hearing the message from the messenger
 atah prithviraj ne apshabdon se 'islam' dharm re anuyaayi raja ko sambodhik kiya tha
 Returned the messenger with that message
 atah ghori kaa uddesh bharat vijay ke pashchaat prithviraj kaa yavanikaran tha
 For him, the life of Prithviraj was also mandatory
 yadhyapi narin yuddh kshetra main ghori chahta to prithviraj kii hatya kar saktaa tha, tathaapi vah prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru chalaa gaya
 Because he wanted ismali-karan of Prithviraj
 ghori kaa mukhya sainik abak tha
 After the Narayan war, he told the events of the entire war to two members of his Rajya Sabha
 wein do sadsy najaami or uphi the
 He created his book according to the statement of Aibak, a direct observer of the Narayan war
 un donon ke tathyon kaa adhyayan kar pro
 mohammad habib or prau
 Khalik Ahmed Nizami established the essence
 nijaami ne likhaa he ki, ghori prithviraj ko ajayameru le gaya
 When Prithviraj then conspired against Ghori, Ghori killed Prithviraj as soon as he got the news
 tajul masir naamak granth main praapt vivaran kaa samarthan bhartiyarot bhi karte hai
 Hasan Nizami has also discussed some misdemeanors, but nothing is known about him
 us shadyantra ke falswaroop ghori ne prithviraj kii hatya kar di aisa uske dwaara ullikhi he
 Pro
 Esch Hodiwala in his book has written that, when Prithviraj's paramitra and assistant Udayaraja got news of Prithviraj's prison, he was saddened by self-aggression
 usne sochaa ki, yadi ksht sah rahe swami kaa tyaag kar palaayan kar jaaon, to meraa gaudvansh kalankit hoga
 Therefore, he attacked Delhi and attacked the fort of Delhi from all around
 us samay ghori kii sabha main kisi ne ghori ko kah ki, "in prithviraj ne tuje anek baar chod diya, kya tu ekbar bhi unako nahin chhodega?"
 Hearing that promise, Ghori said, "the kingdom will be destroyed in consultation with people like you
" phir ghori ne prithviraj ko ajayameru ke durg main bhej diya
 Pro
 According to Hodiwala's statement, the person who advised the liberation of Prithviraj was a person of Prithviraj
 apni chaaron ore anisht kii ashanka ke chalate ghori prithviraj ko ajayameru ke prasaad le gaya
 Thus, after the Ghori Narayan war, Prithviraj was taken from Delhi to Ajayemaru and killed Prithviraj there
 hasan nijaami ne jis shadyantra kaa varnan kiya he, us vishay main puratanprabandhsangrah naamak granth main ullekh praapt hota he
 It is mentioned there that, when Mlechharaj left Prithviraj, then Prithviraj planned for vengeance
 parantu unke vishwasghaatee mantri ne ghori ko yojana bataa di
 In Prabandhchintamani, composed by Merutung, one gets a description that Ghori was enraged at seeing the muggers killing the 'muslims' in the Chitrashala
 uske pashchaat usne prithviraj kaa shirishchhedan kar diya
 But in that description, the soundness is not considered
 kyonki ghori jaanata tha ki, na keval prithviraj, api tu chouhanvansh ke sabhi raja gaubhakshi muslimon se ghrinaa karte the
 Nizami has described that, Ghori took Prithviraj to Ajayameru and left him
 prabandhchintaman main bhi ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ajayameru ke rajsinghaasana par arurh hue
 According to the statement of Jainacharya named Jinprabha Suri, Ghori killed Prithviraj in Ajayameru
 11 / 3 / 1192 dinank ko prithviraj kii mrityu hui thi
 According to the Indian Panchang, Prithviraj died on the Krishna Ekadashi date of 1249 Vikramaswatsar's Chaitramas
 prithviraj kii mrityu kahan or kab hui thi iskaa vivaran vibhinn granthon main bhinn hi praapt hota he
 But Prithviraj died in Ajmeru 9, but he has tried to prove this scholar
 
 Ghori somehow wanted to force Prithviraj to accept 'islam' religion
 atah vah prithviraj ke saath sah raaj naitik sambandh sthapit karne ko tatpar tha
 But Prithviraj was determined to reject the 'islam' religion
 dow hemachandra raay likhte hai ki, "chouhan vanshiyon kaa itihaas or swabhimaan ko dekhakar prithviraj ke liye bandijiwan yaa dasjivan charitranukool nahin ho saktaa tha"
 Hence Prithviraj had two routes
 rajnatik vyaavhaarikta kaa upyog kar sandhi athwa swabhimaan kaa rakshan
 Prithviraj chose the second route
 prithviraj se nakaaratmak pratyuttar paakar ghori krodhagni main jal uthaa
 Therefore, he started torturing them physically and mentally to get Prithviraj to do his desired work
 ghori ke dwaara di gai maranantik peeda ko sahakar prithviraj uske vash main nahin hue
 Therefore, he conspired to diplomatically convince Prithviraj of 'islam' religion
 bahut varshon se ghori kii seva karanevaale deshadrohi mantri pratapsingh ko ghori ne prithviraj ke sameep bheja
 Pratapsingh's aim was to punish Prithviraj in any way for pursuing the 'islam' religion
 atah vah prithviraj ko kuch din paryant samajhaata rahaa
 Prithviraj believed in Pratap Singh and told him the agony of his mind and also told him the plan of Banvedh
 banvedh kii yojana ko hi nijaami naamak pustak main shadyantra ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Banvedh is confirmed in many texts and historical events also point towards it
 ghori ke aadesh par prithviraj ke mantri pratapsingh ne prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karne ke liye samajhaayaa
 Prithviraj said to Pratapsingh "I want to kill Ghori"
 prithviraj ne aage kaha ki, main shabdavedh baan chalaane ko sakasham hoon
 i am ready to demonstrate my knowledge
 tum kisi bhi prakaar ghori ko meri vidya kaa pradarshan dekhne ke liye tatpar karo
 After that, tell me where Ghori is located at the time of the performance of Shabdwedhaan in the Rajya Sabha
 main shabdavedhi baan se ghori kaa vadh kaaanpana pratishodh loonga
 But instead of helping Prithviraj, Pratapsingh informed Ghori with reference to Prithviraj's plan
 prithviraj kii yojana ke vishay main jab ghori ne suna, to uske man main krodh ke saath kautuhal bhi utpann hua
 He did not even imagine that any blind person could hear the sound and be able to penetrate the target
 parantu mantri ne jab baaran baar prithviraj kii nipunata ke vishay main kaha, tab ghori ne shabdavedh baan kaa pradarshan dekhnaa chaha
 Ghori had installed an iron or stone statue in his place
 tatpashchaat pratapsingh ne sabha main prithviraj ke haath main dhanushkand diye
 When Ghori ordered the target to be pierced, then Prithviraj fired an arrow
 us baan se us murti ke do bhaag ho gayi
 Due to the treason, Prithviraj's last attempt also failed
 hasan nijaami ke varnan anusaar, uske pashchaat krodhit ghori ne prithviraj kii hatya kar dene kaa aadesh diya
 After that, a Muslim soldier murdered Prithviraj from a Ratnagadit Suvarnayak Aasin
 is prakaar ajayameru main prithviraj kii jeevanalila samaapt ho gai 
 After that, his orthodox rituals took place in Ajayameru's own Hariraj's lips

 Dr
 Bindhyaraja is of the opinion that Prithviraj often followed the said verse till his last time
 aathsau varshon ke pashchaat bharat main hindu shashan punah sthapit hua he ye ashok singhal mahoday ne kaha tha 
 The Bharatiya Janata Paksha won in the elections held in India in 2014
 uske pashchaat narendra modi pradhanmantri bane
 During the analysis of that victory, Ashok Singhal had said the above conclusion
 pruthvraj chouhan ke samay arthath 800 varsh pashchaat narendra modi pratham hindu shaasha hai
 Sher Singh Rana announced that he had brought back the bones of Prithviraj by going to Afghanistan
 kyonki prithvirajrasokavy main prithviraj kii mrityu gazani-pradesh main ullikhit he, atah anekon kii manyata he ki, vahiin prithviraj kaa samadhisthal he
 Sher Singh is also among those who follow that belief
 pehle ye phulannadevi kii hatya main dosha main tihaad karagaar main tha
 But after that, when he came to know that the tomb of Prithviraj is still in the Ghazni region and even today the Muslims insult his tomb, he escaped from the prison
 uske pashchaat vah kram se nepal, bangladesh or dubai hote hue kabul pahunchaa
 He took the ashes of Prithviraj from him and returned to India and surrendered
 yadhyapi itihasvidon ke matanusaar prithviraj kii mrityu ajayameru main hui thi or prithviraj ke anuj hariraj ne unki antyeshti vidhi kii thi, tathaapi prithviraj kii mrityu gazani-pradesh main hui thi ye bhi anekon kii dharna he
 According to that belief, the followers of Islam at Prithviraj's tomb were insulting Prithviraj, the last Hindu Hindu king of Hinduism
 shersingh ne 'jail diary – tihaad se kabul or kandhar tak' naamak apane pustak main apni yatra ke anubhav likhe hai
 He has also made a film of his journey

 1829 ke basant main unhone nathalya se vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 Puskin was married to Natalya in 1831, despite many obstacles
 pushkin kaa vivaahit jivan sukhi nahin rahaa
 a glimpse of this is found in the letters written by him, Pushkin encounters a Frenchman named d'antes of Natalya Goncharova, the courtier of Czar Nicholas
 kaha jaataa he ki da'antes nathalya se prem karne laga tha
 d'antes proposed marriage to Natalya's sister Catherine
 phir vah or nathalya chhupakar mili, sthitiyaan or bigadin
 This was not tolerated by Pushkin and he invited d'antes to fight a duel

 Toxin is harmful only when there is too much in the body, but when taken with other things properly, it can also be used as a medicine

 These natural things are used not only by humans as well as other animals as well, like a butterfly baby who hatches eggs and cuts it and gives them eggs in it, which starts eating from inside then the butterfly's children To kill, they start eating a little toxin so that they remain, the vegetarian organisms eat the poisonous plants and get the necessary nutrients like protein and vitamins
 And at the same time they also destroy the kitanu and insects inside their stomach, for example some wild animals like cows, deer, monkeys etc
, chew this naturally obtained poison and rub it on their body so that they attack other organisms
 For example, thorny rats of Africa, who chew on toxins from trees and plants, rub feces on their thorns so that dogs and leopards do not attack them

 The concept of the Pashtun people being descendants of the ancient Israelis has been the subject of much controversy among Western historians since the 19th century
 pashtun lok manyata ke anusaar yah samudaay israel ke un das qabeelon kaa vanshaj he jinhen lagbhag 2,800 saal pehle asyrian samrajya ke kaal main desh-nikaala mila tha
 The fact of Israel being made of Pakhtuns is also found in the book "magazane Afghani" written during the period of Jahangir in the sixteenth century AD
 angrez lekhak alexander bern ne apni bukhaaraa kii yatraaon ke bare main san 1835 main bhi pakhtunon dwaara khud ko bani israel maanane ke bare main likhaa he
 Although Pakhtun calls himself Israel, but religiously, he is a Muslim, not a Jew
 alexander bern ne hi punah 1837 main likhaa ki jab usne us samay ke afakhaan raja dost mohammad se iske bare main poocha to uskaa jawaab tha ki uski praja bani israel he isamen andeh nahin lekin isamen bhi andeh nahin ki ve log musalmaan hai evam aadhunik yahudiyon kaa samarthan nahin karenge
 William Moorecraft also wrote in the travelogue of many countries including India, Punjab and Afghanistan between 1819 and 1825 that the color of Paktuns, nose-map, body etc
 is like all Jews
 je bi freizer ne apni 1834 kii 'faras or afghanistan kaa aitihaasik or varnankaree vrittant' naamak kitaab main kaha ki pakhtun khud ko bani israel maanate hai or islam apnaane se pehle bhi unhone apni dharmik shuddhta ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Joseph Fierre Ferrier, in a book written about his Afghan history in 1858, said that he was forced to consider the Pakhtuns as Beni Israel when he came to know that when Nadir Shah passed from Peshawar before the conquest of India, the chief of the Yusufzai clan He presented him with a Bible written in Hebrew and many articles used in ancient worship

 In the paper published in 1861 by George Moore about the ten lost nations of Israel, he also clearly states that the ten lost nations of Israel can be traced to Afghanistan and other parts of India

 He writes that the naming of the civilization culture of Pakhtun, their and their villages, etc
, is all the same as that of Israel

 thomas ledle ne Calcutta Review, main ek lekh likhaa jo usne do bhaago main prakashit kiya
 In which he writes that Europeans confuse themselves when they talk about the fact that Afghans call themselves Israelis but at the same time deny being of Jewish origin
 usee ke shabdon main dekhen
 "the Europeans always confuse things, when they consider the fact that the Afghans call themselves Bani Israel and yet reject their Jewish descent
 Indeed, the Afghans discard the very idea of any descent from the arguments
 They, however, yet claim themselves to be of Bani Israel
 " Ledley, trying to explain this, writes that out of the Israel of David after being separated from the house of David, only the house of Judah was named Jewish and since then they have a different history from their other Israelites
 Writes as follows
 "israelites, or the Ten Tribes, to whom the term Israel was applied – after their separation from the House of David, and the tribe of Judah, which tribe retained the name of Judah and had a distinct history ever after
 These last alone are called Jews and are distinguished from the Bani Israel as much in the East as in the West
" aadhunik itihaas va shodh
 Along with many other contemporary history cars, Dr
 Alfred Edersheim writes that modern research has proved that the Afghans are descendants of the lost houses of Israel
 "modern investigations have pointed the Afghans as descendants from the Lost Tribes
" sar thomas holdic apni kitaab The Gates of India main kahata he ki ek bahut mahatvapurn qaom he jo khud ko bani israel kahati he
 This nation describes themselves as descendants of the Israeli Khays and Ham
 inke reeti rivaajo va naitik niyamo main rahasyamay tareeke se musa kii sharia kii baaten shaamil hai
 They also celebrate a festival which is completely similar to Moses' Passover,



 koi bhi isaki vajah iske alaava kuch nahin bataa saktaa jo yah log daawa karte hai
 These people are residents of Afghanistan

 "but there is one important people who call themselves Bani Israel, who claim a descent from Cush and Ham, who have adopted a strange mixture of Mosaic Law in Ordinances in their moral code, who keep a feast which strongly accords with the Passover,


 and for whom no one has yet been able to suggest any other origin than the one they claim, and claim with determined force, and these people are the overwhelming residents of Afghanistan
 " - Sir Thomas Holditch, The Gates of India, 49
 In 1957, Itzhak bin Zvi, who was the second President of Israel, writes that the ancestors of Pashto were Israelis, they have maintained their traditions
 
 There are many castes who renounced their previous faith while adopting Islam
 udhaaharan ke liye arab multah ek murtipujak qabeela the, unhone murtipuja chhod di
 Iranians worshiped fire, they abandoned it after adopting Islam
 syria ke logo ne islam apnaane ke baad apana isai mat tyaag diya
 Many people, both Jewish and non-jewish, have gone to Afghanistan, and have seen their traditions

 This was particularly so in the case of the nations and the communities of the Levant
 The people of the Arabian Peninsula, for example, derived all their knowledge of an original pagan cult, which they abandoned in favor of Islam, from such verbal tradition
 So did the people of Iran, formerly worshipers of the religion ofzoroaster; the Turkish andmongol tribes, formerlybuddhists and Shamanists; and the Syrians who abandoned Christianity in favor of Islam
 Therefore, if the Afghan tribes persistently adhere to the tradition that they were once Hebrews and in course of time embraced Islam, and there is not an alternative tradition also existent among them, they are certainly Jewish

 In contrast, their ancestral traits or characteristics are stable and unchangeable
 kisi bhi jeev ke pitraagat lakshan or parivesh kii antakriyaaon ke falswaroop uski vruddhi or parivardhan hota he
 Therefore, the putative traits determine the 'norms of response' of organisms, that is, the manner of their response to the environment

 Many scientists believe that genetic study of humans is not a simple task
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya jaataa he ki manushya kii santan ke janm main lagbhag 10 maas lag jate hai or ise purna vayask hone main kam se kam 20 varsh lagate hai
 Therefore, genetic study of humans is complicated due to the time it takes 20,22 years to study only one generation
 iske saath hi manushya ko ek baar main saadharantaya ek hi baccha utpann hota he, isse bhi adhyayan main kathinaayee hoti he
 Despite these difficulties, the study of external structure of human body, diseases, their symptoms and causes etc

 There are provisions in these languages that are helpful in writing programs that do many tasks simultaneously
 Assembly languages which statically link data inline with instructions can also be considered data-structured, in the most primitive way
 These languages are suitable for describing a problem and not for a solution or solution
 ye bhashaayen duusari programmen bhashaaon kii seemaa kii jaanch ke liye dizin kii gayi hoti hai
 These languages are designed to write 'embedded' programs in another program
 ye bhashaayen sabhi prograamon evam sabarotinon ko function ke rup main paribhaashit karti hai
 Interactive mode languages act as a kind of shell: expressions or statements can be entered one at a time, and the result of their evaluation is seen immediately
 Interpreted languages are programming languages which programs may be executed from source code form, by an interpreter
 Theoretically, any language can be compiled or interpreted, so the term *interpreted language* generally refers to languages that are commonly interpreted rather than compiled
 Iterative languages are built around or offering generators
 List-based languages are a type of data-structured language that are based upon the list data structure
 Little languages serve a specialized problem domain
 Logic-based languages specify a set of attributes that a solution must have, rather than a set of steps to obtain a solution
 Examples: Machine languages are directly executable by a computer's CPU
 They are typically formulated as bit patterns, usually represented in octal or hexadecimal
 Each group of npatterns causes the circuits in the CPU to execute one of the fundamental operations of the hardware
 The activation of specific electrical inputs, and logical settings for CPU state values, control the processor's computation
 Individual machine languages are processor specific and are not portable
 They are always defined by the CPU developer, not by 3rd parties
 The symbolic version, the processor's assembly language, is also defined by the developer, in most cases
 Since processors come in families which are based on a shared architecture, the same basic assembly language style can often be used for more than one CPU
 Macro languages embed small pieces of executable code inside a piece of free-form text
 Scripting languages such as Tcl and ecmascript have been embedded into applications so that they behave like macro languages
 Metaprogramming is writing of programs that write or manipulate other programs as their data or that do part of the work that is otherwise done at run time during compile time
 In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually
 Multiparadigm languages support more than one programming paradigm
 They allow a program to use more than one programming style
 The goal is to allow programmers to use the best tool for a job, admitting that no one paradigm solves all problems in the easiest or most efficient way
 Class-based Object-oriented programming languages support objects defined by their class
 Class definitions include member data
 Message passing is a key concept in Object-oriented languages
 Polymorphic functions are parameterized by the class of some of their arguments are typically called methods
 In languages with single dispatch, classes typically also include method definitions
 In languages with multiple dispatch, methods are defined by generic functions
 There are exceptions where single dispatch methods are generic functions
 Prototype-based languages are object-oriented languages where the distinction between classes and instances have been removed: Off-side rule languages are those where blocks are formed, indicated, by their indentation
 Procedural programming languages are based on the concept of the unit and scope 
 a procedural program is composed of one or more units or modules, either user coded or provided in a code library; each module is composed of one or more procedures, also called a function, routine, subroutine, or method, depending on the language
 Examples of procedural languages include: Reflective languages let programs examine and possibly modify their high level structure at runtime
 This is most common in high-level virtual machine programming languages like Smalltalk, and less common in lower-level programming languages like C
 Languages and platforms supporting reflection: Rule-based languages instantiate rules when activated by conditions in a set of data
 Of all possible activations, some set will be selected and the statements belonging to those rules will be executed
 Examples of rule-based languages include: "scripting language" has two apparently different, but in fact similar meanings
 In a traditional sense, scripting languages are designed to automate frequently used tasks that usually involve calling or passing commands to external programs
 Many complex application programs allow users to implement custom functions by providing them with built-in languages
 Those which are of interpretive type, are often called scripting languages
 More recently many of these applications have chosen to "build in" traditional scripting languages, such as Perl or Visual Basic, but there are quite a few "native" scripting languages still in use
 Many scripting languages are compiled to bytecode and then this platform independent bytecode is run through a virtual machine 
 Stack-based languages are a type of data-structured language that are based upon the stack data structure
 Synchronous programming languages are optimized for programming reactive systems, systems that are often interrupted and must respond quickly
 Many such systems are also called realtime systems, and are found often in embedded uses
 Examples: These languages assist with generating lexical analzyers and parsers for conttext-free grammars
 Visual programming languages let users specify programs in a two--dimensional way, instead of as one-dimensional text strings, via graphic layouts of various types
 Some dataflow programming languages are also visual languages
 Computer scientist Niklaus Wirth designed and implemented several influential languages
 These are languages based on or that operate on XML
 Although the big-boy equivalents of Oracle / postgresql / MSSQL don't yet exist for XML, there are languages to navigate through it and its more tree-oriented structure
