 bhautikee ko paribhaashit karnaa kathin he
 According to the opinion of some scholars, this is a science of energy and it discusses the conversion of energy and its material relations
 iske dwaara praakrit jagat or uski aantarik kriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Location, time, speed, matter, electricity, light, heat and sound etc
 fall within its periphery
 yah vigyaan kaa ek pramukh vibhaag he
 Its principles are valid throughout science and apply in every part of science
 iskaa kshetra vistrut he or isaki seemaa nirdhaarit karnaa ati dushkar he
 All scientific subjects come under this in a small amount
 vigyaan kii anya shakhayein yaa to sidhe hi bhautik par aadhaarit hai, athwa inke tathyon ko iske mul siddhanton se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage
 Gradually this science kept progressing and at this time seeing the rapid pace of its development, even the leading physicists are surprised
 dhire-dhire isse anek mahatvapurn shakhaon kii utpatti hui, jaise rasinic bhautikee, tara bhautikee, jeevbhautikee, bhubhautikee, nabhikeey bhautikee, akashiya bhautikee ityadi
 The main principle of physics is "law of conservation of energy"
 iske anusaar kisi bhi dravyasamudaay kii urja kii maatra sthir hoti he
 It is not possible to increase or decrease this quantity by internal actions of the community
 urja ke anek rup hote hai or uskaa roopantaran ho saktaa he, kintu uski maatra main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass can also be converted into energy
 is prakaar urja sangrakshan or dravyaman sangrakshan donon siddhanton kaa samanvay ho jaataa he or is siddhant ke dwaara bhautikee or rasayan ek duusare se sambhddha ho jate hai
 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest
 ' vartmaan me ilectatronix bishay ek kendra bindu mana ja rahaa he jiske sahare samoochaa vishwa chalyman he! Karma Misir is a village in Aurangabad district of Magadh division under Bihar state of India
 yah maanav bhugol kii ek pramukh shakha hai
 Under this branch, human behavior, decision-making and geographical effects falling on it are studied keeping in mind the regional and spatial characteristics

 It is now quite common that cios are appointed from the business of the organization, especially if they have project management skills

 Another type of CIO role that is changing is the increased focus on service management

 main pakade gaye brihat dhaval bak ke bare main miltaa he, jisaki taang main dhaatu kaa challa padaa tha
 a few years later a similar ring was found on a bird named Turkey, which was of silver
 1804 i
 main dach prakrutivaadee brugaman ne kai safed bagulon ko yah jaanane ke liye patbandhit kiya ki ve apane janmasthan par phir se lautakar aate hai yaa nahin, parantu in pakshiyon ke phir se praapt na hone ke kaaran yah prayog asafal rahaa
 Thereafter there is mention of Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, a resident of a place called Weiborg in Denmark
 inke man main patbandhan kaa vichaar ek prakashit samachar dwaara aayaa
 He read that a swan, which had a ring of bronze inscribed in the neck in the year 1800, became accepted after 35 years
 iske pashchaat hi inhone pakshipatbandhan kaa kaary prarambh kiya
 Mortensen is said to be the originator of this field, as he made biases a useful branch of science through his regular studies
 udaahranarth, inhone pratham baar prayek pakshi ko ek sankhya pradaan kii, jo ve challe par sthaayee rup se khod dete the tathaa apni diary main bhi note kar lete the or jiske falswaroop pakshi, chaahe kitni hi samay baad athwa duuri par kyon na hastgat hua ho, sadaiv pahachaanaa ja saktaa tha
 Then they used to patrol not in a few birds but in more and more birds, so that the fruits of their experiment could be confirmed with greater certainty
 iske atirikt unhone apane tathaa anya deshon ke samachaarpatron tathaa patrapatrikaon main apane uddeshyon ko prakashit karke antarrashtriya sahyog praapt karne kaa pratham sahi prayaas kiya, kyonki aise prayogon main bina antarrashtriya sahyog ke purnat: safal hone kii sambhaavna nahin hoti
 Mortensen's experiments gave a major impetus to partisanship throughout Europe
 1903 i
 main germany main 1911 i
 main sweetsraland or 1912 i
 main belgium evam finland main pakshipatbandhan par kaary prarambh ho gaya
 Between 1904 and 1916, a number of government and non-government partisan projects started in Britain as well, and by the first World War there were about 17 lakh birds in Europe
 america main pakshipatbandhan kaa pratham udhaaharan san 1803 main miltaa he, jab kalakaar prakrutivaadee, jon james audubon, ne chaandi ke taar ke challe kuch pakshiyon ke bacchon ke pair main daale or duusare vasant main unamem se do ko phir se praapt kiya
 In 1902–1903, Paul Barch patrolled about 101 black-plumed herons in Colombia

 He gave birth to the 'american Bird Badging Association' in 1909

 Meanwhile, in India too, the work of partisanship started under the Bombay Natural History Society

 By the end of 1944 AD, seven lakh birds were fenced in Britain and 50 lakh in America
 pakshipatbandhan do dhangon se, pakshiyon kii taang main dhaatu ke bane challe daalkar yaa unke paron ko rang kar yaa vishesh dhang se kutar kar, kiya jaataa he
 The pattern of the rings, due to its standing, is more recoverable
 paron ko rangane yaa kutarne kaa dhang pehle tareeke kaa poorak maatr hi hota he, athwa isko us samay prayog main laate hai jab kisi pakshi kii alpakaaleen, sthaneey gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The ring is made of a light metal and is of the shape of a bandage
 isapar prayogkarta kaa naam, pataa or anya aavashyak suchnaayen khudi rahati he
 At the time of patching, this bandage is folded around one leg of the bird and pressing both its ends and thus giving it the shape of rings
 bahudhaa donon siron ko aapas main fasaa dene kaa prabandh rahata he
 The size of the rings is smaller than the measurement in the leg of the bird
 is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki challa bahut ksaa na rahe jisase pakshi kii taang main ghaav ho jaae, athwa nahaate samay vah sthaan dhul na sake
 The rings of the rings are sanded and kept smooth, so that they do not produce any further runoff

 Birds also keep their favorite food in the cage to encourage them

 Apart from this, the partisan bond has proved useful in acquiring knowledge of many things in the study of birds, the main of which are the following: 1
 pravajan panth kii jaankaree, arthath pakshi lambey path apanaate hai yaa chote, samudr ke upar hokar jate hai yaa dharaatal ke upar, nirdhaarit path se jate hai athwa prayek varsh path badalte rahete hai

 Robert Owen was a social reformer and entrepreneur
 unki gananaa samaajwaad evam sahakaarita aandolan ke sansthaapakon main kii jaati he
 Before saying anything about the father of cooperative Robert Owen, we have to remember that he was not a fundamental thinker of the theory of cooperatives
 usase pehle bhi aarthik sansadhano ke vikendrikaran ke paksh main anek arthshaastri apana paksh rakh chuke the
 Even the word of companionship, synonymous with cooperative, had already emerged
 kintu isse rabart oven kaa yogadan kam nahin ho jaataa
 uski mahatta is baat main he ki usne sahakaar ko vyaavhaarikta ke dharaatal par saakaar karne kii koshish apni puri eemaandaaree or samathrya ke saath kii
 Always worked devotedly for his thoughts
 haalanki use antat asafalataa hi hasil hui; magar tab tak duniya sahakaar ke samathrya se puri tarah parichit ho chuki thi
 Oven was born on 14, May 1771, in Newtown, a simple town in Centralvale
 saat bhai-bahanon main se ek oven ke pita saadhaaran vyapaaree the
 His shop was for the sale of iron tools
 While the mother belonged to a thriving farming family
 oven kaa bachapan ghaney abhaavon ke bich beetaa
 uski shiksha kii shuruyaat to thik-thaak hui magar vah puri ho usase pehle, maatra nau varsh kii avasthaa main hi use skool chhodkar naukari kerani padi
 kaam kii talash main vah apane sabase bade bhai wiliam ke saath landan chalaa gaya
 He got his first job as a tailor in Lancashire
 kuch varshon tak oven vahaan par kaam sikhta rahaa
 Owen spent nine years ahead of him working
 Gradually he accumulated some money and some dreams too
 is bich mahattvakankshaayen jo paristhitivash kuch samay ke liye dab gai thim, ve phir se sir uthaane lageen
 The steam engine was invented only a few years before that, because of the steam powered looms revolutionized the textile industry
 isi kaaran manchester ke kapadaa udyog kaa un dinon bada naam tha
 In the last months of 1790, Owen borrowed a hundred pounds from his elder brother William
 apni mahattvakankshaon kaa khubasurat sapana man main sajaae ek din vah manchester pahunch gaya
 With his modest capital, he started a small factory to weave a thread shoe together with Joan
 jone usase pehle maikenic kaa kaam karata tha
 Given the work, the capital of a hundred pounds was very less
 badi companiyon ke saath kathin spardhaa main oven kii mil tik nahin pai
 In the meantime, there were problems with the partnership with Joan
 isliye maatra teen maheene ke antaraal main jone ke saath apane saajhedaari todakar oven ne apane alag kaarkaane kii neenv rakhi
 Owen was struggling to keep him running when he was reported to be vacant as manager in a large factory in Manchester
 usne apni mil kaa laalach chhod diya or us naukari par ja laga
 At that time he was only twenty-one years old
 vah ek prakaar se satat sangharsh evam safalataa kii shuruyaat thi
 He was hardworking and diligent
 chah maheene ke alp samay main hi vah mil maalik ke dilo-dimag par apni kaaryastylee kaa sikaa jamaane main safal ho gaya
 Five hundred laborers worked in that factory at that time
 oven ke liye yah badi uplabdhi thi, kintu uski safaltaaon kaa sahi myne main to yah prarambh hi tha
 Own night-hard work, talent and dedication, Owen brought the factory to Britain's best in just a few years
 oven udhyamshiltaa kaa anumaan maatra ek udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki usne apane kaarkaane ke liye america dwipon se rooyee kaa aayaat kiya
 It was the first cotton import from the southern states
 yahi nahin oven ne rooyee katai ke kaary main bhi ullekhneey dakshata praapt kii
 Undeniably his factory was one of the best spinning factories in the then Britain; Whose success can be attributed to anyone, it was only Owen
 ikis varsh kaa tarun oven 1795 main menchester ke ek ore badi kapadaa mil kalrton twist company kaa prabandhak or hissedaar ban chukaa tha; jisase uskaa naam vahaan ke sarvaadhik safal udhyamiyon main gina jane laga
 At the same time Owen had to move to New Lanark from his factory work, which was a very suitable place for the textile industry due to its geographical location
 tab tak vah ek sudarshan yuvak ban chukaa tha
 In fact, Owen was told that David Dale, a famous New York textile businessman, wanted to deal with his textile mills
 david del kii khyaati doordarshee evam kaamyaab udhyamiyon main hoti thi
 Owen's fame had reached him
 uski bejod pratibha or laganshiltaa se del chamatkrit the
 Upon arriving in New Lenark, there was another pleasant twist in Owen's life
 david del kii ek beti thiμkarolina del
 yuva oven uske pyaar main pad gaya
 Carolina also could not escape her attraction
 david del ne oven ke haathon na keval kapadaa milon ke ek hisse kaa sauda kiya, balki apni kanya kaa vivaah bhi uske saath kar diya
 It was the event of September 1799, which brought Owen to many achievements simultaneously
 vivaah ke pashchaat oven vahiin apana ghar banaakar rahane laga
 The factory in New Lenark was started in 1784 by Dale and Richard Arcaride
 factory us samay new lenark kii sabase badi kapadaa milon main se ek thi; jise chalaane ke liye jal-shakti kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 More than two thousand employees worked in it; Of which about five hundred were children of poor families
 bacchon main bhi adhikansh kii aayu paanch se chah varsh ke bich thi
 The same situation was prevalent in most textile mills in those days
 david del yadhyapi balshramikon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhte the, lekin koi kargar vyavastha na hone ke kaaran mazdooron, visheshkar balshramikon kii dasha shochaneey bani hui thi
 Most of the workers belonged to extremely poor, uneducated families
 ashiksha, kuntha or hataasha ke kaaran chori, jua, sharaab or nashakhori jaisi anek kureetiyaan unke jivan main pravesh kar chuki thim
 In the name of household, they all had a room, small and dirty, in which clean air was impossible
 bacchon kii padhai kii vyavastha to dur bimaaron ke ilaaj ke liye bhi koi intjaam nahin tha
 By that time, Owen had attained great prosperity and prosperity
 vivaah ke pashchaat uske aatmavishvaas main vruddhi bhi khub hui
 But Owen's ambitions were yet to end
 uske bhavishya kii ruparekha isi aatmavishvaas ke aadhaar par tay honi thi, kyonki yah uskaa aatmavishvaas hi tha jisane use kathor faisle lene kii prerana di, jisase vah aaajeevan apane vichaaron evam uddeshyon ke liye sangharshrat rah sakaa
 Owen corrected criticisms of his government and industrialists for his revolutionary decisions
 His partners left him and left
 karodo rupee kii sampatti jo usne kathin parishram se arjeet kii thi, dhire-dhire uski kalyankari yojanaon kii bhant chadh gai
 But it is not new for the great men to walk separately in history, to do new work, to set new standards for the coming generations
 itihaas kaa darbar aisi hi chunautiyon ko paar karne vaale mahapurushon ko sahejane main garvanubhuti karata he
 Owen Cora was not a businessman
 uske paas khubasurat or samvedansheel maanas bhi tha, jo dusron ko ksht main dekhte hi vichlit ho uthta tha
 He himself came from a poor family
 is kaaran garibi kii vivashtaaon or kashton se vah bhalee-bhaanti parichit tha
 In those days, where there was an abundance of big factories in New Lenark, there were also many small settlements of poor laborers around it
 vahaan kaa jivan naarkeey tha
 Owen felt that the expected increase in productivity would not be possible without improving the living and conditions of the artisans and laborers
 isliye usne apane jivan ke agle das varsh mazdooron kii haalat sudhaarney ke naam kar die
 He saved the laborers' settlements
 un bastiyon main swayan ja-jaakar mazdooron kii gandi aadaton ko chhudaane kaa prayaas kiya
 By reducing the working hours of the child laborers, arranged their education and entertainment
 mahila mazdooron ke liye alag vishramghar or prasuti-kendron kii vyavastha kii
 On one hand, the life of the laborers was improved due to these efforts, yet the views of those workers who viewed industrialization with suspicion also changed
 nai vyavastha ke prati unka aakrosh kam hone laga
 As a result production increased, Owen also benefited
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara apane karmchaariyon ke kalyaan ke liye jitne bhi kadam uthaae gaye unke peeche uski vishuddh vyavsaayik drushti thi
 Like a skilled entrepreneur, he was adept at turning situations in his favor
 karl macrs ke sahyogi or macrsvaadi vichaarak fradrik anglas ne apane charchit lekh—socialism: Utopian and Scientific main spasht rup se ullekh kiya he ki— This is what Owen thought
 tulanaatmak rup main usne apane karmchaariyon ko behatar vaataavaran uplabdh karaane ke prayaas to kiye, magar ve unke vyaktitv evam buddhi ke chahumunkhi vikaas se kaaphi dur the
 They were allowed to use their discretion limited to very few, specific contexts
 oven par sudhaarwadiyon kaa prabhaav padaa tha
 He was an honored member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester
 scottish navajagaran andolan se prabhavit oven kaa maananaa tha ki manushya kaa vyaktitv uske vaataavaran se prabhavit evam vinirmit hota he
 Hence, personality can be refined by improving the environment
 ‘shiksha naitik jagat se sampark karaane vaala ingine he
 He was a supporter of this dictation of a historian, underlining the importance of education
 vyaktitv nirmaan ke liye shiksha kii anivaaryta darshaate hue usne kaha tha ki— In those days most of the factory owners used to pay their laborers on the basis of commodity exchange rather than cash wages
 tadnusaar mazdooron ko token de die jate the; jinaki kaarkaana maalikon ke samooh se baahar koi keemat na thi
 In exchange for those tokens, laborers could buy essential goods from the designated shops
 mazdooron kii vivashtaa kaa laabh uthaane ke liye un dukaanon par bhi unka khulaa shoshan hota tha
 The goods found there were cheap and expensive compared to the market
 us kuriti ke viruddh aawaaj uthne lagi to, british sansad ne gaiyrkanoonee qaraar dete hue usapar roak laga di thi
 Owing to the problem of laborers, Owen started a consumer center where good quality goods could be obtained by paying just above the cost price
 usne mazdooron ke charitrik vikaas ke liye bhi aavashyak kadam uthaae
 Knowing that laborers spend a large part of their earnings on alcohol and other intoxicants, Owen puts their sales under tight control
 yahi nahin oven ne apane kamgaaron ko upabhokta bhandaron se thok kharid ke liye bhi protsaahit kiya; jisase ve adhik bachat kar saken
 bachat par jor dete hue usne mazdooron ko kathin samay ke liye apni aay kaa ek hissaa anivaary rup se bachaane ke liye kaha
 balshramikon ke liye usne behatar paristhitiyon kaa srijan kiya
 Ensured their working hours and opened schools for compulsory education
 Owen's consumer stores had substantial success
 usee ne aage chalakar sahakaari kshetra ke upabhokta andolan ko prerit kiya
 However, cooperative consumer-led consumer centers were successfully launched almost four decades after the Rochelle Pioneers established the first consumer center in the Todlane area of london
 un dinon mil mazdooron ko pratidin kam se kam gyaarah ghante lagaataar kaary karnaa padataa tha
 Owen cut it to an hour per day
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main yah kadam sahaspurn hone ke saath-saath chamatkaarik bhi tha
 His move was strongly opposed by other industrialists
 puunjipatiyon dwaara poshit samachaarpatr-patrikaon main oven ke is kadam kii aalochana karne vaale lekh chaape gaye
 Owen prohibited the work of children younger than ten years in his mill without being afraid of it
 mil-mazdooron ke liye kalyaan suvidhaon kaa vistaar karte hue usne unhen kaarkaane main hi awaas suvidhaayen pradaan kin
 Also established hospitals, restrooms and recreation houses
 un dinon kaam ke dauraan hui galatiyon kaa khamiyaja mazdooron ko hi bhugatna padataa tha, jisase unke vetan kaa bada hissaa nuksaan kii bharpai main hi nikal jaataa tha
 Owen ended the tradition of fines, which were strongly opposed by other industrialists
 magar oven apane nirnay par atal rahaa
 Owen's most important contribution was to manage children's education
 usne shishu paathshaalaon kii sthapana kii or sahakaar kaa janmdata hone ke saath-saath vah shishu shiksha kaarykram kaa prarvattak bana
 He launched a revolution, making education compulsory for five-year-old children
 yah sab oven ne keval apni aantarik prerana ke aadhaar par shuru kiya tha; jiskaa majdoorvarg kii ore joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 It is worth noting that Owen was spending a lot of money on the construction of housing settlements for the workers, construction of hospitals, restrooms, recreation houses and baby schools
 majdoor kalyaan kaaryakramon par usase pehle itnaa bada nivesh kisi ne nahin kiya tha
 So initially people thought Owen's behavior was madness
 virdohi oven kaa majaak udaate, apane purvaagrah se bhare mastishk main uske ek din diwalia hone ke mansoobey sajaate
 kintu samay ke saath-saath logon ko sab samaj main aane laga
 Despite spending millions of pounds in labor welfare programs, Owen's factories were continuously generating profits, rather their profits were steadily increasing
 saath hi uski lokapriyata or prasiddhi main bhi nirantar ijapha ho rahaa tha
 Some of Owen's plans proved too expensive
 jisase uske hissedaaron ne virodh karnaa prarambh kar diya
 The partners wanted to run the factory in a normal way
 unase tang aakar oven ne ek nai company kii shuruyaat kii, jisamen usne vyavastha kii thi ki munaafe kaa beesvaan hissaa tayshuda lokahitaishi kaaryakramon par kharch kiya jayega
 jeremi bantham, wiliam ellen nai company main oven ke saajhedaar bane
 Owing to such thinkers, Owen's public programs were sure to get public acclaim
 is bich main oven vaicharik rup main bhi paripakv hua tha
 He was already influenced by Bentham's ideas
 apane vichaaron ko abhivyakti dete hue usne ek lanbaa lekh New View of Society, Or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character, and the Application of the Principle to Practice likhaa
 Owen's socialist views were very clear in that article written in several installments
 samaajwaad ke prati oven kii aasthaa aage bhi badhati hi gai
 Bentham was a supporter of the free market system
 uskaa maananaa tha ki mazdooron ko yah adhikaar ho ki ve apane liye apane pasandida vyapaaree yaa utpaadak ko chun saken
 usapar kisi pratyaksh athwa paroksh dabaav nahin hona chahie
 By then Owen's fame had grown
 saath main sthaneey prashasan par uskaa prabhaav bhi
 sudhaar kaaryakramon kaa udyogpatiyon kii ore se nirantar hote virodh se bhi vah vichlit nahin hua
 On the contrary, it intensified its efforts to make legal arrangements for the protection of labor rights
 balshramikon ke kaary-ghanton ko ghataane ke liye bhi oven ne bharpoor prayaas kiye
 But the only failures in this work were his hands; Because by then the industrialists and their supporting officials, who were in favor of maintaining the status quo, had become strong opponents of Owen
 tab tak oven kii khyaati britain kii simaaon ko langhakar baahar ja chuki thi
 Countries wishing for labor welfare wanted to implement the public welfare programs of Owen
 rus, halend, prasha ke tatkaaleen shaskaon ne oven ke paraamarsh ke anusaar majdoor sudhaar-kaarykram shuru kar die the
 Owen's reform programs were heavily supported by the working class
 uske kaarkaanon kaa munafa ascharyajanak rup se badha tha
 Another industrialist who was describing Owen's reform programs as his suicidal move, Owen stopped speaking by earning sixty thousand pounds in a single year
 usne dikhaa diya ki dhanarjan ke liye shoshan, beyimaani athwa galakat pratiyogita hi aavashyak nahin he
 If forward-looking work is done, it is possible to achieve the goal of progress through cooperation and mutual sympathy
 oven dharm ke naam par thopi ja rahi jad manyataon se bhi kshubdh tha
 He believed that the excessive interference of religion in life prevents man from making a logical decision that the pathetic condition of the working class is due to the stereotypes which he has brought up in the name of religion
 isliye apane lekhon main usne dharmik manyataon kii jamkar aalochana kii thi
 As a result, infinitely other influential people began to mobilize against the clergy and religion
 apane kalyaan kaaryakramon ke kaaran vah puunjipati varg ko pehle hi naaraaz kar chukaa tha
 So selfish entrepreneurs and religious contractors started a campaign against Owen
 prakarantar main isse oven kii pratishtha ko dhakka laga
 The oven was truly a great dreamer
 ek behatar duniya kaa sapana uski ankhon main sadaiv jhilamilaataa rahata tha
 In the early years of his life, his faith in religion had ended
 uskaa maananaa tha ki swarg jaisi sthitiyaan dharti se pare sambhav hi nahin he
 If big people use a little renunciation and foresight, then this earth can be made like heaven
 uske soch kaa aadhaar yah tha ki manushya apana vyaktitv swayan nahin, apitu swayan ke liye banaata he yani uski uplabdhiyon evam vyaktitv ke nirmaan main kisi na kisi prakaar dusron kaa bhi yogadan hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of human beings to cooperate fully with the rest of the people so that maximum people can benefit
 swapndrushtaa hone ke saath vah sankalpavaan bhi tha
 He acted on his plans regardless of his criticism
 majdoor kalyaan ke kaaryakramon ke atirikt usne bacchon ke liye shiksha ko anivaary ghoshit kar bal shiksha sansthaanon kaa aadi pravatrthak hone kaa shrey liya
 He did many other experiments for the betterment of society; Which took valuable time as well as capital
 haalanki virodhiyon ke kaaran oven ko yadhyapi apekshit safalataa nahin mil saki, magar asafal rahakar bhi usne un raaston kaa anveshan kiya jis par bhavishya kii anek vikasgaathaayen likhi jaani thiμor aage jinka anusaran puri duniya ko karnaa tha
 The economic depression took place in 1815
 It became difficult for Owen to pursue reform programs
 isliye usko apane kaarykram kuch dinon ke liye sthagit karne pade
 tab tak oven ke vyavastha kii khaamiyon se parichit ho chukaa tha
 He felt that capitalist system and exploitation are two sides of the same coin
 poonjivadi vyavastha ke paravaan chadhane ke liye jaruri he ki samaaj me asantosh or dishaheenata ho
 Hunger, unemployment, poverty and illiteracy that make the common man helpless, help a successful industrialist build a palace of profit
 janata kii agyanta or digabhramata poonjeevaad ke vistaar ke liye utprerak ban jaati hai
 Seeing the socio-economic disparity of his time, he was getting bored and frustrated with the system responsible for him
 use vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki behatar kal ke liye vyavastha main amul parivartan atyaavashyak he
 Because the present system is promoting centralization of capital and exorbitant exploitation
 oven kii manahosthiti usee ke in shabdon se sahaj ujagar ho jaati he- These were the thoughts of a struggling, dreamy, diligent and visionary entrepreneur who had proved his entrepreneurial spirit in India and abroad
 vah bhi apane adwitiya sudhaar-kaaryakramon ke chalate, jisamen usne apane dhan or sansadhano kaa vyay kiya tha
 It is clear that Owen had all the flaws in the capitalist system
 usko vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki jis pragatigami samaaj kaa bimb uski ankhon main he, vah poonjivadi vyavastha ke dwaara athwa uske samarthan se sambhav hi nahin he
 a system that rests on self-exploitation and abnormality cannot be a carrier of socialism based on exploitation-free and equality
 He believed that a human is affected by his environment, so a change in his personality is possible with the change of environment
 haalanki uske vichaaron main kahin-kahin antarvirodh bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 Criticizing capital-driven supremacism, the French scholar Furrier stated that - vyapaarik mandi ke daur se guzarate hue oven dwaara 1816 main kii gai tippanee uski poonjivadi manovriti kaa pratik he
 He said that- ‘hamaara sarvottam graahak yuddh, ab samaapt ho chukaa he
 ' oven ko tatkaaleen factory system se ghrinaa thi
 He believed that this production system gave rise to social irresponsibility, destructive competition and heartless individualism
 uskaa vichaar tha ki saamaajik tanaav kaa ek kaaran maanviya shram or mashiinon kii avaanchit, aniyantrit spardhaa bhi he
 The solution to this is that human beings get organized and take production of machines and do production work
 isliye usne apane shramikon jivan-str main sudhaar laane ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 Not only this, while acknowledging the importance of high quality, he started giving special benefits and incentives to those employees who were skilled in making goods of better quality
 uske kaarkaane main prayek mashin ke baraabar main vibhinn rangon ke ghanaakaar tukade rakh die jate the
 The quality of the material made from the color of the cube was determined
 isse karigar ko apane kaam ke str kaa pataa hota tha
 Incentives were paid on the same basis
 spasht he ki us samay oven ke kaarkaanon main kaary kaa str or uski paristhitiyaan duusare kaarkaanon ke apeksha behatar, lagbhag adarsh avasthaa main thim
 Owen's influence on New Lenore was decreasing
 uske hissedaar bhi chhodkar ja chuke the
 But Owen's faith in morality and symbiosis did not diminish
 uski nigaah ab europe se baahar ke deshon par lagi thi
 Meanwhile, Owen's fame reached America and Owen received an invitation from America to go to New Harmony
 oven ne new lenark chhodane kaa faisla kar liya
 This decision was also indifferent to the new experiments of the British
 yun to sahjivan par aadhaarit bastiyaan basaane ke liye scotland, ireland aadi praanton se bhi prastaav aae the
 But Owen did not see any difference in the conditions there
 1824 main oven atlantic mahaasaagar paar karke hormani ;tauvadaladdh pahunchaa vahaan uskaa joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 In 1825 he bought several acres of land at a place called New Harmony, Indiana for thirty thousand pounds to carry on the experiments of New Lanark
 jahaan usne new lenark ke prayogon ko aage badhaane ke dhyey se ek nai basti kii sthapana kii
 Within a few months the fame of New Harmony spread around the world
 vahaan mili safalataa se utsahit hokar oven ne oribiston ;vtpaipejavadaddh naamak sthaan par waisi hi ek or basti kii aadharshila rakhi
 Encouraged by the initial successes, Owen also settled in some other places
 Their names are Queen Wood; Funmad Lawyer, Rallatine; Tansanjpadam etc
 ve sabhi bastiyaan sahjivan ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai thim
 Owing to these settlements as before, Owen's dream was to exploit and establish a class-free society
 vah aise samaaj kii kalpana karata tha jahaan sabhi parsparikta par aadhaarit jivan-yaapan karen
 a colony should have 300 to 2000 members, who have arable land ranging from one thousand acres to 1500 acres
 basti ke sadasyon ke awaas ko chhodkar rasoighar, bhojanalay, sabha bhawan, skool, pustkaalay, aataa chakki, kaarkaane aadi samuhik haa or inke liye ek samachatubhuj ke aakaar kii vishaal imaarat ho
 Owen thought that such a system would reduce the value of money in life - which is the main reason for the habit of collection in humans
 san 1825 se 1829 tak oven ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai kul solah bastiyon main new haaramani sabase pehali or prasiddh thi
 But due to regional conditions problems started running the settlements
 darasal new haaramani jaise chote se praant main ek saath anek virgon ke log rahete the
 They all had different problems
 isliye new haaramani kaa prayog adhik lanbaa na khinch sakaa
 Owen's experiments in the US first met when one of his American partners parted ways with Owen
 ullekhneey he ki in sabhi kaaryon main oven kii dher sari puunji lagi thi; jisase uskaa vyavsaay buree tarah prabhavit hua tha
 Three-fourths of its total capital had already been spent in the settlement of New Harmony
 oven kaa maananaa tha ki sahjivan par aadhaarit vyavastha kii safalataa uske prayasaan kii vyapaktaa main hi sambhav he
 Any person has limitations, so for the success of such efforts, other people of the society also have to come forward
 sarkaar bhi to sabase adhik jimmedaari he hi
 Thinking the same, he also sought help from the government
 maamla sansad-patal par bhi rakhaa gaya
 But the proposal was rejected, considering it impractical
 oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon kii khaasiyat thi ki vahaan kaa jivan samuhik evam sahyog par aadhaarit tha
 The entire colony was like a large family; Whose members' joys and sorrows were shared
 mahattvakankshaon main barabari thi
 Even collectivism had an influence on their dreams and resolutions
 oven kii spasht dharna thi ki aadarshonmukhi samaaj main saamaajik sambandhon kaa aadhaar laabh ke sthaan par seva hona chahie
 There should be transparency and co-operation in the work business, only then is it possible to get rid of exploitation
 oven un bastiyon ko sahjivan ke adarsh ke rup main sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 Owen's group of pro-socialists can easily see the glimpses of symbiosis in the anthem
 yah geet oven dwaara sthapit bastiyon main bade hi manoyog se gaaya jaataa tha-‘bhaaiyo utho! athulaneey prem se sarabor or paramasatya se abhasith din ke darshan karo
 Look up, humanity is eager to enjoy and bless community life in place of competition
 ab nyaay kii jeet hogi
 The suppression of the powerful will end, the bliss of universal bliss
 ’1 For twenty years he continued to work for the success of the collective life
 magar dhire-dhire asafalataa saaf najar aane lagi, kaaran ki in bastiyon main basane pahunche logon main adhikansh log aise the jinhen oven ke siddhanton main koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 Many criminals were of a mental attitude to him and the search for a safe haven took him to those settlements
 naakaara or kaamchor kism ke logon ko sir chhipaane ke liye oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyaan bahut anukool thim
 The second problem was that of dedicated workers there
 un bastiyon ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye jis prakaar ke swayan sevakon kii aavashyaktaa thi, unka vahaan saraasar abhaav the
 However, some of the people who came to the settlements had arrived there, truly devoted to Owen's ideas
 magar adhikansh keval shaukia, vakt bitaane ke liye vahaan chale aate the
 Some members of the New Harmony came out of the democratic tradition and wanted to open up the system
 unhen oven kaa ekadhikaar sweekaar nahin tha
 It is noteworthy that Owen's position in those settlements was similar to that of the head of the family
 parinaam yah hua ki oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon main samasyaayein aane lageen
 In the words of John Curl ‘basti kaa gathan uske sadasyon ke utaavlepan ke saath hua tha
 Due to this, he had already announced his downfall
 shaayad unka aapas main milanaa hi durbhagyapurna tha
 In fact, the group formed on the basis of cooperatives was far from its spirit
 nau sau se adhik logon ke us samooh kaa sabase bada durbhaagya to yahi tha ki sahjivan kii shuruyaat karne se ve ek-duusare ko jaanate tak nahin the
 They included a wide variety of people from different places, different professions, surroundings, including working families, middle class intellectuals, and nomadic intellectuals who call themselves progressive
 samuhik bastiyon kaa gathan baari anubhavheenata kaa shikaar tha
 The result of which was seen in the form of fighting and quarreling
 People belonging to different backgrounds, castes had fought amongst themselves and fueled a feeling of disharmony in others, which was impossible to diagnose
 unke aapasi manmutav itane bad chuke the ki ant main jab samuhik bastiyon kaa prayog asafal hone kii ghoshnaa hui or log waapas lautne lage, to bhi unke parsparik jhagade lambey samay tak chalate rahe
 antat jameen kaa bantwaaraa kar, new haaramani ke nivasee anek sahakaar bastiyon, pariwaron main bant gaye
 ' new haaramani kaa prayog asafal hone ke pashchaat oven ne mexico main nae sire se phir koshish kii
 Due to the high poverty ratio there, he had high chances of success
 lekin aashaa ke vipareet mexico main uskaa saamana paramparawaadi carch se hua, jiskaa vahaan kii garib janata par atyadhik prabhaav tha
 The result was that Owen was boiling from America
 san 1828 main vah waapas england ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
