 The topography of Las Angeles is quite heterogeneous, with a total area of about 498
3 sq
 M, consisting of 469
1 sq
 m of land and 29
2 sq
 m of water
 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 The first light of Guru Granth Sahib was on 16 August 1604 at Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar
 1705 main damdama sahib main dashamesh pita guru govind singh ji ne guru tegbahadur ji ke 116 shabd jodakar isko purna kiya, isame kul 1430 prishth he

 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai
 Sometimes his procession is also taken out and always try to walk accordingly

 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc
 The entire religious life of the Sikhs is influenced by the book

 The language of Sri Gurugranth Sahib is closer to the Hindi language than the modern Punjabi language and the meaning of guru-vyans is more perceptible to the Hindi-speaking than the Punjabi-speaking one

 In addition, he was the longest reigning king in the history of Thailand
 
 Psychiatry or psychiatry is a specialization in the medical field that studies psychiatrists
 manovikar vigyaan aadhunik yug kaa ek naveen vigyaan he
 In the 20th century itself, discoveries of importance have been made in various parts of this science
 19veen shatabdi tak vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar aise rog maane jate the jinka saadhaaran chikitsak se koi sambandh nahin tha
 In the state of complex psychosis, the patient was kept in mental hospitals, so that he could not do any harm to other people of the society
 in chikitsaalayon main bhi uskaa koi vishesh upachaar nahin hota tha
 The doctors did not really have clear knowledge about his treatment and how to do the medicine
 ab paristhiti badal gai he
 Psychology is not considered a blind cell, which deals with a small number of demented people, but this science is considered to be a matter of such importance that a proper knowledge of it is not only for skilled physical therapists, but also every servant and worker of society, It is also necessary to be a teacher, social reformer and political leader
 itnaa hi nahin, iske gyaan kii aavashyaktaa prayek sushikshit naagarik ko bhi he
 If a strong psychologist comes to mind and we do not know it, then we will not be able to seek the help of any expert to get rid of it
 koi bhi vyakti, jo purna swasth he or jisaki buddhi kii sabhi log prashansa karte hai, apane man kaa santulan kisi samay khokar veikshipt ho saktaa he
 Then it becomes useless for the society
 manushya ko chahie ki vah aisi paristhitiyon kaa gyaan kar le jisase vah kisi prakaar kii asaadhaaran maansik avasthaa main na aa jaay, arthath maansik rog se peedit na ho jaay
 Then it is necessary to have reverence in psychiatry even for getting mental medicine
 maanav kii vishesh aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye manovikar vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 This is the result of a special gift of the 20th century
 is shatee main manushya kii kaaryakshmata or uski sukhsamagriyon main kalpanaateet abhivruddhi hui he
 His logical power and scientific miracles have increased immensely
 iske saath saath uski maansik kriyaayein bhi pehle se kai guni bad gai he
 It is not Corey that talent and madness complement each other
 buddhivikas ke saath saath veikshiptata kaa bhi vikaas hota he
 Science increases pleasant materials, and also creates sad conditions
 vah bahya paristhitiyon ke suljhaav paidaa karne ke saath saath nai maansik ulajhanein bhi utpann kar detaa he
 On the one hand, science increases the security of human beings, on the other hand it also creates unintentional concerns
 atev yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki 20veen shatabdi veikshiptata kii shatabdi he
 If it has increased insanity, then it is also the task to find special measures to mitigate it
 jo desh jitna hi sabhyataa main pragatisheel he, usamen veikshiptatanivarak chikitsak or chikitsaalay bhi utane adhik hai
 Therefore, many types of psychological discoveries are being made in various fields of anthropology for the prevention of psychosis
 doctor frid ke purv maansik rogon kii chikitsa ke liye doctor log bhautik oshadhiyon kaa hi upyog praaia: karte the
 Some people used mechanism to calm these diseases
 tantropchaar kaa aadhaar vishwaas or nirdesh rahata he
 Even today this method is mostly used in rural illiterate people
 belgium ke prasiddh monsopchaarak da mesumar ne sammohan or nirdesh kaa vyapak upyog maansik rogon ke upachaar main kiya
 Manojat physical diseases were also prevented by this
 france ke bran hime or sharako naamak vidwaanon ne sanmohan kii upyogita monsopchaar main bataai
 The patient used to relieve the mental feeling suppressed in his condition and in this type of catharsis, he also got rid of the disease
 france ke nenson ke doctor imil kuye ne maansik rogon ke upachaar main nirdesh kaa upyog kiya, parantu in sabhi vidhiyon se manovikar vigyaan kii vishesh unnati nahin hui
 For this, serious experimental study of the mind was necessary
 yah kaam doctor frid ne kiya
 Now it is believed that no person can be freed from his dementia without knowing the variations of the mind and knowing the processes going on in them
 doctor frid ke anusaar man ke teen str hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 The mind also performs three types of tasks: the creation of desires, their control and their satisfaction
 pehla kaam bhogashrith man kaa he, doosraa kaam naitik man kaa he or teesraa kaam ahankaar kaa he
 Desires are often born on a subconscious level, they are controlled on the subconscious and their satisfaction is on the conscious level
 manushya ke bhogecchhuk man or naitik man main praaia: sangharsh chalata rahata he
 When this struggle goes on in the human consciousness, then no matter what the cause is, it does not cause disease, but when a strong desire is suppressed by a strong will, through the moral mind, then the level of the mental consciousness But instead of being in the unconscious mind of man
 is sangharsh kaa hona hi maansik rog he or vyakti ko is sangharsh se mukt karnaa uski maansik chikitsa he, jo manovikar vigyaan kaa dhyey he
 For this, the patient is brought into a state of mental dysfunction and then he is instructed to remember his unpleasant or immoral experiences
 iske liye kuch log ab bhi sanmohan vidhi kaa upyog karte hai, parantu frid rogi kaa manovishleshan karte the
 In this method, by bringing the patient to a calm and relaxed state, all the thoughts and pictures that come to mind are asked to speak
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi rogi bahut puraane apriy anubhavon ko kah daalata he
 When those experiences become fully alive and the patient feels ashamed, guilt, joy and sadness in the same way as he did the first time, then his feelings are cathartic and many symptoms of the disease cease
 rogi kaa laabh kori bauddhik smriti se nahin hota, varan puraane anubhavon kii sajiv smriti, arthath bhavpurn smriti, se hota he
 When a repressed emotion is created, it is first charged to the mental doctor
 bhav ke baahar aane ke liye rogi kaa chikitsak ke prati sneh kaa rukh hona nitant aavashyak he
 Unless there is unity of heart between the patient and the physician, repressed desire does not come to the level of subconsciousness
 phir yah sneh din prati din badhata jaataa he
 As the patient's trust in the doctor increases, his disease decreases
 apane rog se mukt hote samay rogi chikitsak ko bahut pyaar karne lagata he
 The growth of this love and cure are two aspects of the same fact
 ab chikitsak kaa karttavya hota he ki vah rogi ke prem ke aaveg ko uske uchit paatr par mode de, athwa uskaa upyog kisi rachanaatmak kaary main karaae
 The doctor keeps trying to get the patient to get emotional composition
 vah use apane aapkaa gyaan badhaane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 The patient can be considered as disease free only if he has not only been free from all the symptoms of the disease, but has received emotional self-reliance and self-suggestion
 manovikar vigyaan isi manodasha kii prapti kaa saadhan he
 In addition to psychology, new discoveries of mental therapeutics have also taken place in other directions
 inamen se do pradhan hai : Due to the struggle going on in the mind of a mental patient, he becomes a victim of insomnia
 ab yadi aise vyakti ko kisi prakaar neend laai jaay, tab sambhav he ki uskaa rog halakaa ho jaay
 The mental patient always has to fight at two places, one inner and the other outer
 use bahari or bhitari chintaayen sataati rahati hai
 Due to this he experiences an extraordinary interruption
 isse vah apni neend kho detaa he
 Loss of sleep increases his tiredness even more and then he goes into a state of insanity
 yadi use neend aane lage, to uski maansik shakti bahut kuch sanchit ho jaay or vah apni bahari samasyaon ko hal karne main samarth ho jaay
 After this, the fierceness of his internal problems also reduces
 atev jo bhi oshadhi rogi ko neend laa de, vah use laabhprad hoti he
 For this, the Indian Ayurvedic medicine is serpagandha, or the sleeping cup made of allopathic method
 jatil maansik rogon se peedit vyakti ko kabhi kabhi achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 For this, he is given an injection of insulin
 iske dene ke baad rogi idhar udhar chatpataata he or shaareerik anthan vyakt karata he
 On repeated injections, the patient has a tendency to rupture, beat and calm
 uskaa man shithilikaran kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 Then the patient naturally recovers
 isi prakaar kaa upachaar bijli ke jhatkon se bhi hota he
 By this, the patient is brought into a semi-conscious or unconscious state
 uski cheshtaayen pratik rup se damit bhaavon kaa rechan karti hai
 In the treatment of complex patients, often electric shocks are employed
 jab inkaa prayog pehle pahal hua tha, tab is upachaar vidhi se badi aashaa hui thi, par ye sabhi aashaaen puri nahin huin
 Some mental diseases are also treated in a natural way
 rogi apane jatil kaamon ko chhod jab prakruti main bhavalin hone lagata he, tab use maansik samya swat: praapt ho jaataa he
 In our current civilization, opportunities for social tension have increased enormously
 jab manushya apni saadhaaran dincharya ko chhod apane man ko aaraam dene lag jaataa he, tab use swasthyalabh ho jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Yung's disease, the person comes to show the need for rest
 vah use apni ichchhaaon ko vash main laane kaa sabak sikhaata he
 According to Edward Carpenter, our present civilization is mental illness
 yah hamen prakritik jivan se dur hataati he
 It increases our desires so much that we always drown ourselves in fulfillment of them
 jis vidhi se in vyarth kii ichchhaaon main kami ho, vahi maansik swasthya kii sarvottam oshadhi he
 Therefore, natural life is the best way to cure psyche
 manovikar vigyaan main na keval prakritik jivan kaa sthaan he, varan dharm kaa bhi he
 Many mental disorders arise from the increase of craving and the lack of restraint
 dharm trishna kii vruddhi ko roktaa or sanyam ko badhaata he
 Therefore, he does not allow many types of psychosis to arise
 duusare, dharm kaa sambandh sahitya or kala se anivaary rup se rahata he
 Through them, the desires of the lower class of human beings are melancholy
 iske kaaran manushya kii in ichchhaaon or naitik buddhi main sangharsh nahin hota or maansik grathiyon ke banane kaa avasar hi nahin aata
 Psychological science thus shifts our vision to those old ways of life and values prevalent in human society, due to which the human suffering has to suffer many kinds of mental afflictions
 is gyaan ke sahare saamaajik mulyon or samskruti kaa jo nirmaan hoga, vah manushya ke jivan ko sthaayee swasthya pradaan karegaa
 With this hope, this science is expanding not only by mental practitioners, but by all social welfare-thinkers
 bharat main manorog vigyaan abhi tak alp viksit avasthaa main he
 The common man's information about psychiatrists is full of misconceptions
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main bhi bhoot-pret, upree saaya, devi-devtaa, mausam, nakshatra, bhagya, bure karmon kaa fal aadi ko in rogon kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 Hence, the exorcists, priests, clerics, monks, fake vaidyas, neem-hakims, untrained sex-experts, etc
 are acting as unscientific psychiatrists
 saamaanya chikitsak evam chikitsa-visheshgy manorogon ko sahi samay par pahchaanane tathaa rogiyon ko manorog chikitsak ke paas bhejne main praaia: asamarth hai
 There are several reasons for this; The main ones are: money greed, insufficient information, inadequate training, lack of psychiatrists, poverty, non-acceptance of psychosis by the patient or his relatives, etc
 samachar-patr tathaa anya prachaar-prasar madhyam bhi logon ko manorogon ke bare main sahi jaankaree dene main asafal rahe hai
 As a result, the misconceptions of fear and ignorance about these diseases have not gone away in people
 bharat kii 100 karod se adhik aabaadi par maatr lagbhag 4000 manorog chikitsak hai
 This number is very low
 bharat main 42 manorog ke aspataal hai jinamein lagbhag bees hajaar bistar hai
 Recently, it has been planned to provide psychiatric treatment in all government hospitals so that psychiatrists can be provided medical treatment in general hospitals only

 Rocka Redonda or Round Rock is one of the smallest islands in the Galápagos Islands

 Unlike its name, its shape is long rather round, whose length is 308 meters and width 136 meters

 The island is not an important breeding area but it is a very popular destination among the scuba diving enthusiasts

 The process of using intense acid or mordant to harvest unprotected parts of a metal surface to form a design in a metal shape is called deposition
 As an intaglio method of producing prints, it is the most important technique for old master prints with cartography and is used extensively today
 shuddh rup se nakkashi main ek dhaatu ke plate ko ek mom kii sataha ke dhank diya jaataa he jo acid ke liye pratirodhi hota he
 The artist then scraps the surface with a pointed carving needle where he wants to get a line to show in the finished piece, from which the exposed metal emerges
 Echop, a device with an oblique oval section, is also used for "puffed" lines
 iske baad plate ko acid ke ek tub main dubaaya jaataa he jise takneekee taur par moredent yaa achent kaha jaataa he, yaa phir ise acid se dhoyaa jaataa he
 The acid "cuts" the exposed portion of the metal, and only the dipped lines remain in the plate
 iske baad shesh sataha ko plate se saafe kar liya jaataa he
 The entire plate is inked and after some time the ink is removed from the surface, thus leaving only ink in the carved lines
 iske baad plate ko paper kii ek shit ke saath ek hai-pressure printing press ke andar rakhaa jaataa he
 The paper absorbs the ink from the carved lines and a print is formed
 is prakriya ko kai baar doharaaya ja saktaa he, plate dwaara ghis jane kaa paryaapt sanket dene se pehle aam taur par kai sau chaape print kiye ja sakate hai
 The work done on the plate can also be added repeating the whole process; This creates an etching that exists in different conditions
 eaching ko aksar anya integleo takneekon ke saath shaamil kiya gaya he jaise ki engraving yaa equatint 
 Etching was practiced by goldsmiths and other metal workers in order of decoration in metal objects such as guns, armor, cups and plates from around the Middle Ages or even before
 vaise bhi germany main kavach kii alankrita sajaavat ek aisi kala thi jo sambhawatah 15veen sadi ke ant ke aas-paas - eaching ke ek print taiyaar karne vaali takanic ke rup main viksit hone se kuch samay pehle italy se laai gayi thi
 It is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hofer of Osburg, Germany, as a process used in preparing prints
 hoper ek shilpkaar the jinhone kavach ko is tareeke se alankrita kiya tha or lohe kii platon kaa upyog karte hue is vidhi kaa print taiyaar karne main prayog kiya tha 
 apane print ke alaava kavach par unki kalakriti ke do pramanit udhaaharan maujuud hai: 1536 kii ek dhaal jo ab madrid ke real armeria main maujuud he or ek talwaar jo neuramberg ke germanishes rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he
 The German Historical Museum, Berlin, has an Augsburg horse armor dated between 1512 and 1515 that has been embellished with Hofer's etchings and figures made of wood pieces but no evidence exists that Hofer himself Worked because their ornate prints were mostly drawn as patterns for other craftsmen in various media
 tambe ke platon ke liye switch sambhawatah italy main banaaya gaya tha or uske baad eaching jald hi print taiyaar karne vaale kalakaaron ke liye sabase adhik lokapriy madhyam ke rup main engraving ke saamne ek chunauti banakar aa gaya
 Its biggest advantage was that unlike engraving, which required special skills for metal carving, etching is a relatively easy-to-learn art for an artist trained in drawing
 loren main sthit nancy ke jaik calot ne eaching kii takanic main mahatvapurn takneekee pragati kii thi
 He developed a type of etching needle, the echop, with a slanted oval part at the end which helped to form a thick line for engravers that was possible for engravers
 aisa lagata he ki unhone mom aadhaarit formula kii bajaay been banane waalon ke varnish kaa istemaal karte hue eaching kii sataha ke liye ek sanshodhit, sakht, nuskhaa bhi taiyaar kiya tha
 This enabled the lines to be cut deeper which increased the lifespan of the printing as well as substantially reduced the risk of "mal-cutting" where the acid would reach the surface where it was not
 Should have reached, which could have created spots or grains on the picture
 pehle echar ke dimag main hameshaa kharaab-kataai kaa khatra maujuud rahata tha jisase vah ek single plate par bahut zyada samay nahin laga saktaa tha, kataai kii prakriya main yah khatra hameshaa ke liye dur ho gaya he
 Now Etcher can do a much more elaborate job that engravers previously had a monopoly and Calot made it possible to fully exploit new possibilities
 unhone pehle ke echron kii tulana main kai "stoppings-out" kaa vyapak or parishkrut upyog kiya
 It is a technique of lightly acid-cutting the entire plate, followed by a stop-out of the parts of the artwork that the artist wishes to keep in a light tone, covering with the ground before dipping it into acid again
 is prakriya ke saavdhaneepurvak niyantran se unhone duuri or lit evam shed ke prabhaav main abhootpurv sookshmata hasil kii
 unke zyaadaatar print apekshaakrit chote the - unke sabase lambey diemension main lagbhag chah inch yaa 15 semi tak, lekin vistaar ke saath pack
 One of his followers, Abraham Bose of Paris, spread Callot's inventions throughout Europe with Etching's first published manual which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English
 17veen sadi eaching kaa mahaan yug tha jisamen rembrant, giovani bennedato castiglione or kai anya maharathi kalakaar hue the
 Taipolo and Daniel Chodowiecki were the best of a small number of the finest achers in the 18th Piranesi
 19veen sadi or 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main eaching ke punaruddhar ne kuch kam kam mahatva ke kalakaaron ko utpann kiya lekin vastav main koi bada naam nahin shaamil tha
 Etching is still widely practiced today
 ek momyukt acid-pratirohak jise ek ground ke rup main janaa jaataa he, ise dhaatu ke ek plate par lagaaya jaataa he jo aksar tambe yaa jaste kaa hota he lekin steel plate vibhinn gunvatttaon ke saath ek anya madhyam he
 There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground hard ground ko do tareekon se prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The solid hard ground comes in a hard waxed block
 is kism par hard ground kaa prayog karne ke liye nakkashi kii jane vaali plate ko ek garm plate par rakhaa jaataa he, jo ek tarah kii dhaatu kii kaam kii jane vaali sataha jise garm kiya jaataa he
 The plate is heated and the ground is applied by hand, melting on the plate
 ground ko jitna adhik samaan rup se sambhav ho roller ke jariye plate par failaayaa jaataa he
 Once applied, the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool, which hardens the ground
 ground ke sakht ho jane ke baad kalakaar plate ko adarsh rup se teen madhumakhiyon ke mom vaale teparon se "phunkta" he jisase lau plate par laga kar ground ko kaala kar detii he or yah dekhnaa aasaan ho jaataa he kii plate kaa koun sa bhaag ujagar he
 Smoke not only makes the plate black but also a small amount of wax is added to it
 baad main kalakaar ek nukile upkaran kaa istemaal kar ground ko kharochtaa he or dhaatu ujagar ho jaati he
 Another method of applying hard ground is by liquid hard ground
 yah ek peepe main aata he or ise nakkashi kii jane vaali plate par ek brush ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 Hard ground hardens when exposed to air
 kuch mudrakatil / tarkol aadhaarit asphafaltem yabitumen kaa hard ground ke rup main upyog karte hai, haalanki bitumen kaa istemaal aksar steel platon ko jang se or tambe ke platon ko purana hone se bachaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Soft ground also comes in liquid form and is dried but it is not dry like hard ground and can leave its effect
 soft ground ko sukha liye jane ke baad mudrak isapar kuch samagriyon kaa upyog kar saktaa he jaise kii pattey, vasteen, haath ke print or isi tarah kii chijen jo soft ground main chhed kar detii he or iske neeche kaa plate baahar nikal aata he
 The ground can also be applied in a fine mist using powdered rosin or spray paint
 is prakriya ko equatint kehete he or yah rangon ke tone, shadow or thos kshetron ko taiyaar karne main madad karata he
 The design is then made with an etching needle or epc
 "echap" point, ek saadhaaran temprd steel kii eaching sui se 45-60 degree ke kone par ek carbrandam pathar ke peeche ghiskar taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 "acup" works on the same principle that the line of a fountain pen looks much more attractive than at a ballpoint: a slight difference in swelling is due to the natural movement of the hand that "warms" the line, and although It is rarely found in an individual line, leaving a very attractive impression overall on the final plate
 ise ek saadhaaran sui ke rup main usee tareeke se taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The plate is then completely immersed in an acid that cleans the exposed metal
 tambe yaa jaste kii platon par eaching ke liye ferick chloride kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jabaki nitric acid kaa prayog jaste yaa steel ke platon par eaching ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Special types of solutions contain 2 parts fecl3 to 2 parts water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water
 acid kii kshamta eaching prakriya kii gati ko nirdhaarit karti he
 During the etching process the printers use the bird's feathers or similar to remove the bubbles and erosions prepared in the dissolving process, the plate can be removed from the surface or by periodically dipping the plate in an acid tub
 is
 agar bulbule ko plate par rahane diya jaataa he to yah acid ko plate main kataai karne se roak detaa he jahaan par bulbula ise choota he
 Zinc produces bubbles far more rapidly than copper and steel, and some artists use it in their prints to create an interesting spherical bubble-like sphere for a Mickey Way effect
 zinc or adhik bulbule adhik tambe or ispaat or kuch kalakaaron kii tulana main teji se utpaadan kaa upyog yah unka ek akashganga prabhaav ke liye print ke bheetar rochak daur bulbule kii tarah halkon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye
 Aparad is a powdery molten metal that fills the carved grooves and prevents acid from being uniformly cut across the exposed surfaces of the plate
 aparad ko plate se hataane kaa doosraa tarika plate ke nakkashi kiye gaye hisse ko neeche acid ke andar plasticine gendon yaa pathar par rakhana he haalanki is takanic kii ek kami bulabulon kaa baahar nikal aana or unhen tatkaal hataa paane main aksham hona he
 Printers often use a test strip of metal about one centimeter to three centimeters wide for aquatinting
 strip ko ek vishisht sankhya ke minute yaa second tak acid main dubaaya jaataa he
 After this the metal strip is removed and the acid is washed with water and cleaned
 pattee ke ek hisse ko ground main dhank diya jayega or phir pattee ko dubaara acid main dubaaya jayega or yah prakriya phir se doharaai jaayegi
 iske baad ground ko pattee se hataa diya jayega or pattee par syaahi daali jaaegi or print kiya jayega
 isse mudrak ko nakkashi kii gayi akruti ke alag-alag digriyon yaa gaharaai kaa pataa chal jayega or isiliye syaahi ke rang kii kshamta is baat par nirbhar karti he kii plate ko kitni der acid main rakhaa gaya he
 The plate is removed from the acid and washed with water to remove the acid
 ground ko tarpin jaise ek vilaayak se hataaya jaataa he
 Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits because turpentine is smooth and can affect ink use and plate printing
 spit-biting ek aisi prakriya he jisase mudrak plate ke kuch khaas kshetron main ek brush ke jariye plate par acid kaa prayog karte hai
 For this purpose the plate can be aquatinted or exposed to acid directly
 is prakriya ko "spit-biting" isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen laar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jiskaa upyog kabhi acid ko dilut karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha haalanki ab aam taur par gam arbik yaa pani kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a plastic card, a piece of mat board or a bunch of cloth is often used to make the ink enter the incised lines
 iske baad sataha ko steeff fabric ke ek tukade se saafe kar diya jaataa he jise tarlatan kehete hai or phir ise newsprint paper se saafe kar diya jaataa he, kuch mudrak apane anguuthe ke aadhaar par apane haath yaa hatheli ke blade bhaag kaa upyog karnaa pasand karte hai
 By cleaning, the ink remains in the incisions
 antim safai ke liye aap organja resham ke ek mude hue tukade kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 If copper or zinc plates are used, the surface of the plate becomes very clean and that is why it is white in print
 agar steel ke plate kaa prayog kiya jaataa he to plate ke swaabhaavik daant print ko equatinting ke prabhaav ke saamaan ek chikani prishth bhoomi dete hai
 As a result, steel plates do not require aquatinting because gradual exposure of the plate will give the same result when immersed continuously in acid
 kaagaj kaa ek nam tukdaa plate par rakhaa jaataa he or ise press ke madhyam se chalaaya jaataa he
 Growing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents led to the development of less toxic methods of etching in the late 20th century
 An early invention for the coating was the use of floor wax as a hard ground
 mark jafraun or kith harvard jaise anya mudrakon ne ground ke rup main acrylik polimar or eaching ke liye ferick chloride kaa upyog karne vaali pranaliyaan viksit kii
 polimaron ko solvaints kii bajaay sodium carbonate se hataaya jaataa he
 When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas like acid, thus eliminating the second danger of conventional etching
 paramparaagat equatint, jo powder yukt regin yaa anamel spray paint kaa upyog karata he, isaki jagah par acrelic polimar hard ground ke ek airbrush aplicoshan kaa upyog hota he
 Also, no solvent is required other than soda ash solution, although a ventilation hood is required due to the air brush spray acrylic materials
 paramparaagat soft ground, jisamen plate se hataane ke liye solvaints kii aavashyaktaa hoti he isaki jagah jal-aadhaarit relif printing syaahi kaa prayog hota he
 The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists ferric chloride etchant, yet it can be cleaned with hot water and soda ash solution or ammonia
 audyogic prakriyaaon main anodic eaching kaa upyog ek sadi se bhi adhik samay se kiya ja rahaa he
 Etching is a source of power direct current
 nakkashi kii jane vaali saamagree ko iske dhanatmak dhruv se jod diya jaataa he
 a receiver plate is attached to its negative pole
 donon ko thodaa alag-alag rakhaa jaataa he or ise ek upyukt electrolite ke ek upyukt jaleey ghol main dubaaya jaataa he
 The electricity pushes the metal out of the anode into the slurry and deposits it as a metal at the cathode
 1990 se kuch hi samay pehle swatantra rup se kaam karne vaale do samoohon ne integleo printing platon ko taiyaar karne main iske upyog ke alag-alag tareeke viksit kiye
 The patented electrotech system, invented by Marion and Omri Behr, can be reworked on a carved plate as many times as the artist wishes, in contrast to some of the non-toxic methods of etching
 yah pranali 2 volt se kam bijli kaa istemaal karti he jo nakkashi kiye gaye hisson main dhaatu ke asmaan crystalon ko ujagar karti he jiskaa parinaam syaahi kaa utkrisht pratidhaaran hota he or jisaki mudrit chhavi ke swarup kii gunvattta paaramparik acid vidhiyon ke samanaantar hoti he
 The polarity, as opposed to the minimum voltage, provides a relatively simple way of preparing mezzontint plates as well as "steel facing" copper plates

 Nevertheless, learning from the failures of Dieppe's action, the British tried a number of new methods - most notably Hobart Funnies - innovation, which undoubtedly saved soldiers from Commonwealth countries during the Normandy descent

 san 1948 tak unhen british samrajya se swatantra ho rahe bharat ke nireekshak pad kaa kaarybhaar saunpa gaya
 Mountbatten's instructions insisted that India remain organized in the transfer of power, but also instructed to have a favorable view on the rapidly changing situation so that Britain's withdrawal would not harm its fame
 jab swatantraaa kaa masauda or praaroop taiyaar hua to donon pakshon, hindu or musalamaanon, ke bich inhi praathamiktaaon ke chalate hi mul prabhaav dikhaa
 Mountbatten was close to Congress leader Nehru, liking his liberal thinking for India
 vah muslim netaa jinna ke prati alag vichaar rakhte the lekin vah jinna kii takat bhaleebhanti pahachaanate the

 Noting that the British government was determined to grant independence immediately, Mountbatten concluded that independent India was an unachievable goal and accepted the plan of partition of independent India and Pakistan
 Mountbatten demanded that on a certain day the British should transfer power to the Indians, for example, with a deadline, the Indians could be assured that the British government was sincerely striving towards this quick and efficient freedom and for some reason it The process should not stop
 He has also concluded that he will not wait until 1947 to deal with this unresolved situation
 This had disastrous consequences on people living on the Indian subcontinent

 lekin jab mountbeton kii seemaa ne jald swatantraaa praapt karne kii sambhaavna par muhar lagaayi tab logon ke mat badal gaye
 In view of Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's failure in any compromise with the Muslim League and Jinnah's stubbornness led all leaders to accept Jinnah's plan of partition, which made Mountbatten's appointments easier
 This led to such an adverse effect that Jinnah's bargaining rating was elevated which in the end caused more concessions to him
 mountbeton ne un bhartiya rajkumaron ke saath majboot rishta bhi banaaya, jo bharat ke un hisson par raaj kar rahe the jo sidhe british shashan ke antargat nahin aate the
 Historian Ramachandra Guha in his book 'india After Gandhi' says that Mountbatten's intervention was decisive in showing the benefit of a large majority of those princes opting to join the Indian Union
 Hence the unity of various princely states can be seen as a positive aspect of their contribution

 In such situations, employees are committed to the organization and develop their behavior in desired conditions

 There is no exaggeration that the role of cultural components in organizational effectiveness is now being given major attention by experts
 vibhinn rashtron ke madhya badhati anternirbharta aaj sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ko anterrashtriya pariprekshya main manyata evam sweekruti pradaan karti he
 The structure of organizational behavior consists of five elements
 vyakti sanghathanon main kaary karte he tathaa vyakti hi sanghathan main saamaajik vyavastha sthapit karte hai
 Individuals can be isolated and in groups
 samooh bhi alag-alag aakaar ke arthath chote-bade, bahut bade, bahut chote ho sakate hai
 Some groups are formal which are formed under the rules of organization structure of the institution
 kuch anya anaupchaarik bhi hote he jo kaary karne vaale vyakti swany bana lete hai yaa swatah ban jate hai
 Groups of individuals are dynamic
 inaki gatishiltaa nirantar bad rahi he kyonki vyakti ab adhik sajag, jivant, vichaarsheel evam bhavpurn hote ja rahe hai
 It is these individuals who form organizations so that they can accomplish collective objectives more efficiently
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kaa doosraa tatv samooh tathaa samooh prakriyaayein he
 Groups are made up of individuals and groups can be small and large
 samooh prakriyaayen sampreshan, nirnayan, shakti evam net tv ke madhyam se sanchalit kii jaati hai
 Person, work and technology are all intimately connected
 praudyogiki kaary karne ke saadhan uplabdh karti mashine, upkaran, bhawan, utpaadan pranali aadi sabhi prodyogiki main hi sammilit hai
 By these means, the people working in the organization are able to complete their tasks with more convenience and efficiency
 prabandhakon ko is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hota he ki vyaktiyon kii kaary sthal kii prodyogiki evam swany ke kaary ke prati pratikriya kya he
 Physical and economic resources, work techniques, equipment, methods of work etc
 are highly affected
 sahi praudyogiki karmchaaree ke kaary main sahaayak hoti he kintu kathin praudyogiki kaary nishpaadan kii bhautik evam maansik laagat main vruddhi karti he
 Organization design defines work relationships
 yah vyaktiyon ke madhya dayitvon va adhikaron ke vitaran tathaa unke parsparik sambandhon kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 The more effective the organization structure, the better the behavior and performance of employees can be coordinated and controlled

 There are also many sub-systems of external environment such as: Government, Society, Consumer, Employees Organization, Competitive Institutions etc

 This affects the behavior of the people working in the organization, the production system marketing policies of the organization are also affected
 sanghathanon main maanviya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karte samay samast vaataavaraniya dhatakon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 To understand the nature of organizational behavior well, we are discussing its key features: - 1
 adhyayan kaa kshetra -sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar adhyayan kaa ek kshetra he
 This is a relatively new field but it is a separate subject of study

 6
 vaataavaran se sambaddh -sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar sanghathan ke aantarik evam bahya vaataavaran kaa adhyayan karte hue maanviya vyavhaar ko samajhane par bal detaa he
 The individual's personal and group behavior has an impact on the environment, policies, mutual views as well as external conditions and values
 7
