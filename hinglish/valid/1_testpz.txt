 Cobb then proposed to Milford that the press should be included in a group of companies to send commercial travelers around South America to which Milford theoretically agreed

 Hodder and Stoughton exited the venture but OUP went ahead and contributed to it

 Music publishing ventures were thus far fewer: "in the nineteenth century Oxford did not value the idea that music could be educational in some sense" and that some representatives or former publishers themselves were related to music or had a considerable background

 Foss was originally hired as an assistant to educational manager VH Collins
 us kaam main phos ne apni urja or kalpana kaa parichay diya
 However, according to Sutcliffe, Foss "was not particularly interested in education as an ordinary musician and talented pianist; he had a keen interest in music
" uske baad bahut jald jab phos ne mileford ko radio par aksar bajaai jane vaali rachanaaon ke sangeetkaaron par jane-maane sangitagnon ke nibandhon ke samooh ko prakashit karne kii yojana ke bare main bataaya tab mileford ne shaayad ise shiksha kii tulana main sangeet se kam sambandhit mana hoga

 Maybe Milford would not have fully understood what he was doing
 1973 main sangeet vibhaag dwaara pachaasavin saalagirah par prakashit pustika se pataa chalata he ki oupi ko "sangeet vyapaar kaa koi gyaan nahin tha or uske sangeet dukaanon main apni rachanaaon ko bechney ke liye koi pratinidhi bhi nahin tha or aisa lagata he ki use is baat kaa bhi ilm nahin tha ki shit sangeet pustakon se kisi bhi tarah se ek alag cheez thi
 "however Milford deliberately or unknowingly took three steps leading to OUP launching a major task
 unhone anglo-french mujeec company or iske sabhi kendron, sambandhit vastuon or sansadhano ko kharid liya
 He hired a moderately famous musician named Norman Peterkin as a full-time sales manager for music

 Milford then largely transferred Foss to his own equipment, in addition to general support
 phos ne iskaa jawaab avishwasaneey urja ke saath diya
 He produced "the largest possible list in the shortest possible time" and began to include titles at the rate of about 200 titles per year; Eight years later that list had 1750 titles

 In fact in 1927 the plan of the essays presented by Foss to Milford for publication appeared as the Heritage of Music
 Likewise, Percy Scholes's Listeners Guide to Music was introduced to the new department as the first of a series of books based on music appreciation to be heard by the public

 Perhaps most importantly, Foss probably had a habit of searching for new composers of compositions that he recognized as uniquely English music that was more dear to the public

 According to Hinnel's proposal AK, the music department's initial "mix of scholarship and cultural nationalism" in the field of music with largely unknown commercial possibilities was motivated by its sense of cultural philanthropy and its desire to promote "national music outside the German mainstream"
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki phos ne sakriy rup se is kaary ko badhaava dena shuru kar diya or ralf vughan williams, wiliam walton, constont lambert, alan rosthorn, peter warlock, edmund rubbra or anya angrezi sangeetkaaron ke sangeet ke prakaashan kii ichha prakat kii
 In the context of what the press called "the most durable gentleman's agreement in the history of modern music", Foss guaranteed the publication of any music that Vaughan Williams would like to offer him
 In addition, Foss took steps towards securing not only oup's rights to music publishing and live performances, but also the "mechanical" rights to recordings and broadcasts
 It was not entirely clear how important all this would have proved at that time
 darasal phos, oupi or kai sangeetkaaron ne pehle parfomming rhit socity main shaamil hone yaa uskaa samarthan karne se inkaar kar diya tha kyonki unhen dar tha ki nai media ke kshetra main hone vaale is tarah ke pradarshan par isaki fees kaa bura asar padegaa

 Whatever the development of the music department in terms of the magnitude and breadth of the music offering and its reputation in the hearts of both musicians and the general public, the question of financial returns was finally the most prominent in the 1930s

 However, the pressure of the Oxford delegates, concerned with the constant expenses incurred on them, increased, which seemed to them to be an unprofitable enterprise

 The London office "remained a source of money for the Clarendon Press to fund the promotion of education
" In addition, OUP considered its book publications to be short-term projects: any unsold book was recalled from the market within a few years of its publication
 In contrast, the music department's pressure on music for performance was relatively long-term and sustained, particularly because income from it would come from repeated broadcasts or recordings, and because it was associated with new and upcoming musicians Was engaged in building their relationship
 pratinidhigan phos ke nazariye se sahamat nahin the: "mujhe abhi bhi yahi lagata he ki yah shabd 'nuksaan' ek jhootha shabd he: kya yah vastav main puunji kaa nivesh nahin he?" yah vaakya phos ne 1934 main mileford ko likhaa tha
 Thus until 1939 no profit appeared in the music department in any year

 This was well-matched with the increasing demand of British schools for music education aids which was the result of government reforms in education in the 1930s
 press ne nae sangitagnon or unke sangeet kii talash karne or unhen prakashit karne kaa kaam band nahin kiya lekin vyavsaay kaa swarup badal gaya tha

 His teachings as a religion theology are characterized by a divine doctrine of introvert and love devotion and socially he is associated with an egalitarian doctrine which is against the caste system of Hinduism and Hinduism
 It is also against the difference of Muslim

 'sant Mat' means 'the path of saints', 'the path of truth', 'the path of right and optimism' or 'opinion of saints'
 The word 'saint' is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'sad' and is used in many ways
 Its original meaning is' one who knows the truth 'or' one who has experienced the ultimate truth
 ' 'sant' shabd se arth aam taur par ek achche vyakti se liya jaataa he lekin iskaa vishesh arth madhyakaalin bharat ke sant kaviyon se hi liya jaataa he
 The Sant Mat movement was not uniform and involved its own socio-religious behavior of saints which was based on the devotion described in the Bhagavad Gita a thousand years ago
 unki apni sajhi kuch roodhiyaan aapas main or un paramparaon ke anuyaayion main bhi sajhi thim jinhen unhone chunauti di thi
 Thus, the saint opinion seems to be such a diverse group of spiritual personalities rather than a specific religious tradition that accepts a common spiritual origin
 is andolan kii seemayen sambhavat: sampradaiwaadee nahin thim or isamen jati or puja-paddati kii brahman avadharanaayen bhi nahin thim
 The saint poets wrote their speech in spoken language which they addressed to the common people in local languages like Hindi and Marathi
 unhone ishwar naam ko sachcha rakshak kaha or dharmik aadambaron ko moolyaheen kah kar khaarij kar diya
 He established the idea that religion is a matter of devotion to God that dwells in the heart
 "
 The first generation of North Indian sages including Kabir and Ravidas were born in Benares in the middle of the 15th century
 Before him, the two main personalities were Namdev and Ramananda in the 13th and 14th centuries
 According to the Sant Mat tradition, Ramananda was a Vaishnava monk who donated names to Kabir, Ravidas and other saints
 ramanandi bhikshuon kii parampara, uske baad ke anya sant or baad ke sikhon dwaara ramanand kii katha ko alag-alag tarah se bataata he
 There is so much information that Ramanand accepted disciples from all castes, a fact which was opposed by orthodox Hindus at that time
 sant mat ke anuyaayi maanate hai ki ramanand ke shishyon ne santon kii pehali peedi taiyaar kii
 These saints developed a culture that was close to the marginalized human beings in the society, which included women, Dalits, untouchables and the extreme
 kuch adhik prasiddh santon main namdev, kabir, nanak, surdaas, mira bai, tulsidas or tukaraam shaamil hai
 
 santon kii panrapara gaiyr-sampradaiwaadee rahi yadhyapi mana jaataa he ki kai sant kaviyon ne apane sampradaay sthapit kiye
 Many of these have saints associated with their names, but their disciples later carried on cults like Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advaita Matha, Science of Spirituality and Radhaswamy

 But this tradition has a great impact on all sects and castes

 Medieval and modern Bharata is the only saintly tradition that has successfully broken Hindu and Muslim boundaries

 lipnor ne jor de kar kaha he ki santon kii dharmik shikshaaon ne kai hinduon ke jivan kaa utthan kiya he or usne use swatantraadaayini kaha he
 In the Sant Mat tradition, importance is given to the living Guru, which is addressed with respectful words like Satguru or 'purna Guru'
 mana jaataa he ki madhyakaalin sufi kaviyon yatha jalaal al-deen mohammad rumi or sindhi kaviyon or sant mat kaviyon ke bich bahut samanta he
 The Radhaswami movement of North India considers itself to be the main endowment of saintly tradition and religious endeavor and presents itself as a living embodiment of the saintly tradition
 sabase adhik ullekhneey radhaswami satsang beas he, jo beas nadi ke kinare par sthit he or jiske vartmaan jivit guru gurinder singh hai
 According to Mark Jürgansmeyer, such a claim is also made by Kabir Panthi, Sikhs and other movements who are gaining insights from today's legitimate Sant Mat tradition

 yah desh ke pashchimottaree bhaag main mikong nadi ke kinare par sthit he jo is sthaan par laos kii thailand ke saath antarrashtriya seemaa bhi nirdhaarit karti he
 The name "vynchan" originated from Pali, the religious language of Buddhism, which was an indo-aryan language
 isamen "vyin" kaa arth lao bhashaa main "nagari" hota he jabaki "chan" kaa arth sanskrit ke "chandan" shabd se ubhara mana jaataa he, arthath "vyinchan" kaa arth "chandan kii nagari" tha
 Ancient Lao inscriptions also confirm this
 aadhunik kaal main kai lao logon main yah bhi manyata he ki "chan" vastav main sanskrit ke "chandra" shabd se upja tha, yani shahar ke naam kaa arth "chaand kii nagari" he
 This has happened because both "chandra" and "chandan" in Sanskrit have the abbreviation "chan" in modern Lao language
 lekin is nagar ko pracheen thai bhashaa sroton ne "เวียงจันทน์" or cambodia ke khmer bhashaa sroton ne "វៀងចន្ទន៍" likhaa he, jin donon kaa arth "chandan" hota he, isliye "chandan kii nagari" hi shaayad sahi arth tha
 The city is spelled "vientiane" in English

 rawal, rajasthan ke sirohi, paali, jalor jilon kaa nivasee brahman samudaay he
 'rawal' was a title given to the priest or Rajguru, the best scholar among the Brahmins
 yah padavi rajasthan ke sirohi jile main basane vaale brahmanon ko di jaati thi
 Later, he started adopting his surname caste 'rawal' and later called 'rawal Brahmin'
 sirohi ,paali tathaa jalor main based rawal brahaman samaaj ek swatantra samooh he jaati nahin he
 In the Brahmin castes of India, a group called Rawal Brahman is neither mentioned in Jati Bhaskar nor is there any such mention in the Brahmins Uttapati Martand, but from the depths it is known that when the establishment of Saraneshwarji after Shri Sthal
 It was then that the Brahmins who passed from Siddhpur went to a village called Gol which is presently near Sirohi and there was a Jagiri rate which in time Gorwal Brahman One group of the same group called Gautama gotra became Rawal Brahmin as the focal point of the group which is commonly called Vadakiya
 usee prakaar siddhapura se padhaare brahamanon ke ek varg ko jise harishchandra ke putr rohit ke naam se vikhyath rohitpur main basaaya gaya jo kalantar main rodwal brahaman kahalaaye uname se ek samooh kaa rawal brahaman samudaay main vilinikaran ho gaya jinhen krishnatraiya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Similarly, the Kashyapa gotra brothers from Pali area merged into the Raval community, which was later called Lurkiya, Shanai: Kapil Tilua and other advanced Brahmin gotras got merged in this community which later became a separate identity called Raval Brahman
 rawal brahaman naamak jaati kaa ullekh kahi bhi nahin miltaa he parantu rawal shabd atak kaa ghotak he rawal se taatpary he rajyakul raja ke guru ko rawal kehete he
 Similarly, from the Sirohi royal family, it was received as Rawal title and also as many villages were received as Jagiri, so it is right here that rawal shabd padavi kaa ghotak rahane ke kaaran ek varg ne inhen pruthak rup de diya jo kalantar main rawal brahman naam se pruthak pahchaan ban gai
 But in all this, the Vadakiya group became the first citizen of Rawal Brahmin group, this is reflected here which came as the priest of Lord Saraneshwarji
 avantak jise ham atak kehete he shabd se taatpary tha karm

 Some vapors also run on solar energy, nuclear energy or geothermal energy, which was discovered in 1763 vaise to bhaap ke ingine kaa itihaas bahut purana he 
 But the earlier tips were not practical in terms of power generation
 baad main inaki dizin main bahut sudhaar hua jisase ye audyogic kranti ke samay yantric shakti ke pramukh strot banakar ubhare
 Although now steam-powered trains and other machines have faded, almost half of the world's electric power is still being generated with the help of steam turbines
 bhaap ingine banane ke ytn kaa sabase pracheen ullekh alexandria ke hero ke lekhon main miltaa he
 Hero was a member of the famous Alexandrian sect schwör bei koran which included masters of erstwhile sciences such as Ptolemy, Euclid, Eratosthenes
 hero ne apane lekh main ek aisi yukti kaa varnan kiya he jisamen ek band baks main vaayu garm kii jaati thi or ek nalee ke maarg se neeche pani bhare bartan kii ore failati thi
 The water of the vessel used to flow into the second tube and it became a fake shower
 phir iske baad is sambandh main kahin koi vivaran nahin miltaa he
 In 1606 AD, some 2,000 years from Hero, Marquesave della Porta, founder of Napoleon's Academy and then a pioneer of science in Europe, used steam instead of air in Hero's sprinkling experiment
 unhone yah bhi sujhaayaa ki kisi bartan ko pani se bharne ke liye yadi use ek nalee dwaara pani se kisi talab se sambandhit kar diya jaay or tab us bartan main bhaap bharkar phir use upar se pani ke dwaara thanda kiya jaay to bheetar kii bhaap sanghanit hokar nirvaat utpann karegi or uski jagah talab se pani bartan main bhar jayega
 In 1698, this suggestion of Marquesve della Porta was used by Thomas Savory in a water dispenser
 is prakaar severy pehla vyakti tha jisane vyavsaayik upyog kaa ek bhaap ingine banaaya, jiskaa upyog khadaanon main se pani ulichane or kuon main se pani nikaalane main hua
 The next stage of the steam engine was the invention of the Neocomain engine after the invention of the engine of Savory
 iskaa avishkaar tamas newcomen ne kiya
 This engine has been used for 50 years to extract water from mines and wells
 iskaa aitihaasik mahatv bhi he, kyonki isi se james wat ke avishkaron kaa maarg khulaa
 Cylinders and pistons were used for the first time in this engine, which are still used in steam locomotives
 newkamen ingine main bhaap keval nirvaat utpann karne ke kaam aati he
 Piston lifting, which causes water to rise, exerts atmospheric pressure
 lekin bhaap ko keval sanghanit karne main bahut eendhan vyarth kharch hota he
 The important work of James Watt is to give the best form of steam engine, which increased the power of human beings ten times and made a huge change in the commercial field
 james wat glassgo main ek chatur vaigyanik yantrarachayita the or 1763 main glassgo vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke professor se unhen ek newkamen ingine kii marammat kaa odash mila jo kabhi thik na chalata tha
 By repairing it, Watts noticed that the fuel wasted badly
 vichaarsheel swabhaav ke wat ne isse shreshth mashin banane kaa vichaar prarambh kar diya
 In this way, he made many discoveries and instruments, from which the steam engine got its present form and became a powerful instrument in the progress of industry and civilization
 bhaap ingine ke nimnlikhit mukhya prakaar hai : In a single-engine engine, the steam acts on one side of the piston and in the two-way engine the steam works on both sides of the piston
 yadi in donon prakaar ke injanon main anya sabhi avasthaaen samaan hon, to dvikriya ingine dwaara praapt shakti duusare prakaar ke ingine dwaara praapt shakti kii dooni hoti he
 This is the reason that an action engine is rarely used these days
 silinder kii dhuree ke urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij hone ke anusaar ingine urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij kaha jaataa he
 The horizontal engine occupies more space than the vertical engine
 urdhwadhar prakaar ke ingine main gharshan aadi kam hota he, jiske kaaran yah kshaitij ingine kii tulana main adhik din tak chal saktaa he
 The speed of a steam engine is in fact its crank shaft rotation per minute
 chaar foot piston stroke evam 80 parikraman prati mintewale ingine main ausat piston chaal 640 foot prati minute hogi
 This engine will be called the low speed engine
 saadhaarant: 100 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se kam chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko nimna chaal ingine kehete hai evam 250 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se adhik chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko ucch chaal ingine kehete hai
 An engine running between 100 and 250 revolutions per minute is called a "medium speed engine"
 ucch chaal ingine kii sabase bada gun yah he ki samaan shakti ke liye yah bahut hi chote aakaar kaa hota he
 Steam is also less expensive due to the high speed, as heat transfer between steam and cylinder takes a very short time in this type of engine
 asanghnan ingine vah bhaap ingine he jisase bhaap kaa nikaas sidhe vayumandal main hota he evam iske liye silinder main bhaap kii daab vayumandal kii daab se kabhi kam nahin honi chahie
 After working steam in the condensing engine, it enters the condenser and converts it into water at atmospheric pressure there
 sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karne se bhaap adhik kaary kar paati he
 In simple engines, each cylinder receives steam directly from the boiler and exhales directly into the atmosphere or condenser
 sanyoji ingine main bhaap ek silinder main, jise ucch daab silinder kehete hai, kuch had tak prasaarit hoti he or uske baad usase kuch bade silinder main, jise nimna daab silinder kehete hai, pravesh karti he evam yahan prasar kii kriya purna hoti he
 Often the low pressure cylinder exits the condenser
 prasar teen yaa chaar silinder main bhi ho saktaa he evam in injanon ko triprasar ingine yaa chatushprasar ingine kehete hai
 The heat engine has the maximum efficiency / T1 with T1 and T2 being the maximum and minimum temperatures in the heat engine cycle
 isse pataa chalata he ki ingine kii dakshata in donon tapon par nirbhar karti he
 The efficiency of the steam engine will increase as the value of it increases and the value of it decreases
 ke mulya ko badhaane ke liye byler se nikal kar ingine main aanevaali bhaap kii daab ko badhanaa hoga, kyonki bhaap kii daab jitani hi adhik hogi kaa mulya utana hi badhegaa
 There is another way to increase
 vah he bhaap ko atitapit karnaa
 The superheat of steam is increased by treating the superheat in the boiler
 ke maan ko kam karne ke liye sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The condenser is converted into steam water by cold water
 at: achche sanghnitr main kaa maan thande jal ke taap ke baraabar ho saktaa he
 This suggests that the engine will be more efficient by having more pressure in the steam engine and the work done by the superheated steam and converting the steam to water at a temperature equal to the temperature of the cold water obtainable in the condenser
 boyler se bhaap ucch daab par bhapapeti main pravesh karti he
 As soon as the piston reaches the end of the stroke, at the same time the valve moves, in which the steam opens and the steam enters the cylinder
 bhaap kii daab dwaara dhakka die jane se piston aage badhata he
 This is called front stroke
 piston kii chaal dwaara crank, crank shaft evam utkendrak chalate hai
 The entrance of the fender opens the door a bit more
 silinder main bhaap tab tak pravesh karti rahati he jab tak dwaar ekadam band nahin ho jaataa
 At this time, there is a breakup and after this the steam is not stored in the cylinder
 silinder main ai hui bhaap ab prasaarit hoti he evam is prasar main bhaap kaa aaytan bad jaataa he evam daab kam ho jaati he
 Steam works at similar times
 agr stroke ke ant main valve bhapadwar ko nikaas kii ore khol detaa he, jisase bhaap nirmukt hoti he
 The pressure of the ejected steam becomes equal to the back pressure
 nirmochan hone ke kuch kshan ke baad piston peeche kii ore lautataa he evam ise prayaavartan stroke kehete hai
 The piston exhausts the remaining steam in the cylinder while returning to this stroke
 jab piston is stroke ke ant par pahunchataa he, valve nikaas dwaar ko band kar detaa he, jisase bhaap kaa pravaah band ho jaataa he
 There is some steam left between the cylinder top and the piston, which is not released
 phir chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 In this two-way engine, the action of the same chakra is on the other side of the cylinder
 rankin chakra ek saidhantik chakra he, jiske anusaar bhaap ingine kaary karata he
 The main function of the speed regulator is to regulate the speed of the engine
 bhaap ingine ke gati-niamak in do tareekon main se ek hi sahaayta se paribhraman kii gati sthir rakh paata he: The speed regulator, which regulates engine speed by increasing or decreasing the pressure of steam according to the demand of power, is called a barrier regulator
 gatiniamak ek avrodh valve ko chalaata he, jo mukhya bhaap nalee main rakhaa hota he
 In this type of gait regulator, the main motile condyle is the motile regulator
 valve santulit prakaar kaa hota he, arthath bhaapadaab dwaara parinami bal shunya hota he
 When the engine speed increases, the speed of the revolutions of the accelerating condensates also increases, which increases the centrifugal force
 bal kii yah vruddhi unhen gurutvkarshnabal evam niyantran kamaani ke viruddh baahar chalane kaa baadhya karti he
 This causes the valve to close in part
 valve dwaara avrodh hone par piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main kami ho jaati he, jiske kaaran utpann shakti bhi kam ho jaati he
 And as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and the pressure of the steam acting on the piston increases, which in turn increases the speed to normal speed
 But it comes
 avrodh gati-niamak dwaara niyamit bhaap ingine main prayog ke baad yadi ingine main prati ghante vyavahrut bhaap kii taul ko ashwashakti ke saath aankaa jaae, to ek saral rekha praapt hogi
 This relationship was first found by Willian

 All these blockages are removed by angioplasty
 bypass surgery kii tulana main angeoplasty adhik surakshit he or aankadon ke anusaar is prakriya ke baad hone vaali jatiltaaon ke kaaran 1% se bhi kam log marate hai
 Complications that occur during or after angioplasty include the following: angeoplasty se upje jokhim 75 saal se adhik umr vaale rogiyon main adhik hote hai

 Overall, the risk in most cases is low and acceptable when comparing the expected benefit with the expected risk
 dil kaa daura padane par kisi bhi rogi ko bachaane ke liye angeoplasty ke mahatv ko kai adhyayanon main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 But studies have not been successful in reducing rigid endpoints for angioplasty versus medical treatment in stable angina patients
 dhamni kholane kii prakriya, asthaayee rup se seene main dard ko kam kar sakati he, lekin lambi umr ke liye yogadan nahin karti
 Most heart attacks do not arise due to obstructions that constrict the arteries

 Typically, patients are given medication that relaxes the arteries against spasms
 is prakriya ke baad rogi aamtaur par do se chah ghante ke bheetar chalane main sakasham ho jate hai or agle saptaah tak apni saamaanya dincharya main waapas aa jate hai
 To overcome the effects of angioplasty, it is necessary to avoid physical activity for several days after the procedure
 marijon ko ek saptaah tak kisi prakaar kaa saamaan uthaane, pote-potiyon kii dekhbhaal yaa anya baari shaareerik gatividhi se bachane kii salaah di jaati he
 Patients need to avoid any physical fatigue or prolonged sports activities for up to two weeks after a delicate balloon angioplasty

 After this, it started being used in the medical world as well
 batal pachisi pachchis kathaon se yukt ek katha granth he
 Its author is said to be Betalabhatta, who was one of the nine jewels of King Vikram, famous for justice
 ye kathayen raja vikram kii nyaay-shakti kaa bodh karaati hai
 Betal narrates a story every day and finally asks the king that the king has to answer it
 usne shart laga rakhi he ki agar raja bolegaa to vah usase ruuthakar phir se ped par ja latakegaa
 But knowing this, the king does not remain silent when questions arise
 batal pachisi kii kahaniyaan bharat kii sabase lokapriy kathaon main se hai
 Their source is given to a book called "bud Kaha", composed by the king "gunadhya" of King Satavahana, which was composed in 495 AD
 kaha jaataa he ki yah kisi puraani praakrit main likhaa gaya tha or isame 7 lakh chand the
 Today, no part of it is received anywhere
 kashmir ke kavi somdev ne isko phir se sanskrit main likhaa or kathasaritsagar naam diya
 The majority of Barkaha's stories have been compiled in Katha Saritsagar, which we still have today
 “vetal panchavinshati” yani vetaal pachchisi “katha sarit sagar” kaa hi bhaag he
 Over time, the fame of these stories reached many countries and these stories were translated into many languages
 vetaal ke dwaara sunai gai yo rochak kahaniyaan sirf dil bahalane ke liye nahin hai, inamen anek good arth chhipe hai
 If we understand what is right and what is wrong, then all the administrators will be able to like justice like King Vikram and leave the trick and malice and walk on the path of karma and religion
 is prakaar ye kahaniyaan nyaay, raajnneeti or vishan paristhitiyon main sahi nirnay lene kii kshamta kaa vikaas karti hai
 Literature is a reflection of society
 jyon-jyon samaaj badalata jaataa he sahitya bhi apana nayaa rup grahan karata jaataa he
 Language changes with the change of age and literature changes with the change of language and society
 us par tatkaaleen samaaj ke prayek ang kii chhap padati jaati he The 'pali' language is the ancient language of our country
 yah ek dirghakaal tak rajya bhashaa ke rup main bhi gauravanvit rahi he
 Lord Buddha preached in Pali language itself
 ashok ke samay main isaki bahut unnati hui
 At that time it was also propagated in various foreign countries
 ashok ke samay sabhi lekh pali bhashaa main hi likhe gaye the
 Pali language was at its peak in India, but with the decline of Buddhism in India, Pali language started to decline
 yah kai desho jaise lanka, burma aadi deshon kii dharm bhashaa ke rup main sammanit hui
 But in India this language was marginalized
 ‘paali’ bhashaa kaa udbhav gautam buddha se lagbhag teen sau varsh pehle hi ho chukaa tha, kintu uske praarambhik sahitya kaa pataa nahin lagata
 Each language has its own literature in the form of fiction, songs, puzzles, etc
 in its initial stage and its outline is kept in the memory of the people till it is written or written
 is kaal main pali bhashaa kii jaise utpatti hui vaise hi vikaas bhi hua
 For almost three hundred years from the beginning, the Pali language has been the language of the common people, but when Lord Buddha chose it for his sermon and started teaching in this language, then in a few days it became the language of the educated community
 Also became the official language with ‘pali’ shabd kaa sabase pehla vyapak prayog hamen acharya buddhaghosh kii attakathaon or unke visuddhimagg main miltaa he
 There it is free from its post-language meaning
 acharya buddhaghosh ne do arthon main iskaa prayog kiya he-1
 buddha-bachan yaa mul tipitak ke arth main 2
paath yaa mul tipitak ke paath arth main
 'pali Bhasha' refers to the language in which Stalarism is the epithet of Buddhism and its entire subservient literature
 kintu ‘pali’ shabd kaa is arth main prayog swayan pali sahitya main bhi unnisvin shatabdi se purv kabhi nahin kiya gaya
 Pali language was originally Magadhi language
 iske udhaaharan kacchayan-vyakaran main dekhne ko milte hai
 "magadhi is the original language in which humans of the first era used to speak, which is the original language of infants with inauspicious words" and in which Buddha spoke his religion, basically
 isi prakaar mahavansh ke parivarddhit ansh chul vansh ke pariched 37kii 244 veen gaatha main kaha gaya he “sabbesan moolbhasai magavaay nirutiya” aadi
 Of course, the Sinhalese tradition is very firm in its belief that what we today call Pali was the Magadha language spoken in Buddhist India
 buddha bachanon kii bhashaa ko hi sinhalai parampara ‘magadhi’ kahana nahin chaahati, vah attakakthaon tak kii bhashaa ko barahavin-terahavin shatabdi main magadhi kahana hi adhik pasand karti he
 However, there are different opinions of scholars in this - Acharya Buddhaghosha believes that this language was originally Magadhi
 dow reez devids kaa kahana he ki pali bhashaa kosal kii bhashaa thi, kyonki gautam buddha kosal ke antargat shakya janapad ke rahane vaale the
 Westergaard Air E
 Kuhan describes Pali language as the language of Ujjayini region
 unka kahana he ki yadi bhashaa kii banaavat ko dekha jaae or uski tulana ashok ke shilalekhon se kii jaae to gyaat hoga ginar ke lekh kii bhashaa se pali milti julati he
 Dr
 Oldenburg and E
 Muller hold that the origin of Pali language is Kalinga
 in dinon vidwaanon ne kaha he ki kaling se hi lanka main dharmopadesh kaa kaary hota rahaa
 The people of Kalinga had settled and settled Lanka and Pali is more common in the Khandagiri inscriptions
 in sabhi vidwaanon ke mat alag-alag hai
 Gautama Buddha was a resident of Kapila object, the capital of Shakya district, which was a republic under Kosal
 vahaan jo bhashaa thi
 Gautam Buddha gave his sermons in that
 vaise gautam buddha bhashaa sambandhi duraagrah ke virdohi the
 The language he preached was understood by people from the eastern border of Bihar to the Karoo country, from Mathura, Ushiradhwaj to the Bindhya ranges
 gautam buddha ke mahanirvana ke ek maas ke uparaant hi unke upadesh tripitak ke rup main sangrahit kiye gaye the
 Therefore, considering all these facts, it is known that Pali language was the literary language of the entire Madhya Pradesh
 us par kosal, magadh, kaashi, paanchal, karu, vatsa, surasen, shakya, coliya, mall, vajji, videh, ang aadi janapado evam ganon kii pradeshik boliyon kaa prabhaav tha
 Therefore, we can say that Pali language was the language of Madhya Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh was its place of origin, anyway language is not the object of a particular city or country
 vah to samudaay, jan, evam desh se apana sambandh rakhti he

 Swarna Aura is very much associated with Swarna Bhavan, her family and especially her father
 durbhaagya se, thakur parivaar apratyaashit paristhitiyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai or jagmohan prasad dwaara swarna bhawan chhodane ke liye majaboor he
 The rivalry between Uday Pratap and Jagmohan is a tragedy that took place ever since Uday Pratap and Jagmohan were children
 kai saal pehle, vahaan swarna bhawan, jagmohan pita, jo udai pratap pita ke chaalak apni patni or bete jagmohan ke saath maujuud tha kiya gaya tha main ek puja tha
 There is a beautiful temple in Swarna Bhawan which contains gold idols for the deities

 Now, Jagmohan comes to take revenge on Thakur
 thakur parivaar chandra prabhaa bhai raghav pandit, jo ek baar thakur kaa dewan tha ke saath rahane chalaa jaataa he
 Raghav is a good and kind man, while his wife Sheetal is very greedy and clever, he is constantly insulting the Thakur family and tries his best to drive them out of his house
 As Abha Kama decides to employ Jagmohan at Swarna Bhavan, Abha tells him that her name is so much that Jagmohan cannot recognize her
 jagmohan ke sabase kam umr ke bete karan prasad abha ke saath pyaar main gir jaataa he
 Aura also begins to fall in love with her, but due to rivalry between their families
 vimal kii vajah se jaldi hi, abha bhai prakaash or pakadaa jaataa he abha kii asli pahchaan kaa pataa chalaa he
 Karan is forced to marry Swarna Aura to save her life from being ruined by her father, who had planned on marrying an alcoholic Aura
 abha or jagmohan or uske pati ke rup main shaadi karan ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 Soon Karan Abha succeeds in confessing her love for him
 karan ke bachapan ke dost, sania maathur, swarna bhawan or uske saath pyaar main gir jaataa he par aata he
 At the same time, even Aura's childhood friend Sanskar realizes his love for Aura
 abha vivaah sanskaar ke saath tay ho jaataa he, lekin shaadi ke din par, karan ek durghatana he or abha use jaati he, har kisi ko apane pyaar or shaadi kaa khulaasa
 haalanki yah uske dard, abha uske mata pita use pyaar, karan ke liye dekhbhaal karne ke liye chhod detaa he

 abha waapas uski bahan lata or uski maan kii madad se har kisi kaa vishwaas hasil karne kii koshish karata he
 Karan arrogant and rude sister Kanika tries to elope with her lover the so-called Nikhil and who later finds out Jagmohan and she is very angry and Kanika is well humiliated by her family
 style, vimal kii patni or karan bhabhi, ek buraai, mahila kii sajeesh rachane ki manaa kanika is dardanaak prakaran ke liye abha se nafrat he

 sanskaar sajeesh ke ant main vifal rahata he ke rup main vah pakadaa or abha maaf karan
 sanskaar acha ho jaataa he, lekin ek nai samasya paidaa hoti he
 It starts with clues from Karan's past when Karan was young, his maternal uncle turns out to have his mother forced to fight a false trial to get her husband Jagmohan Pratibha
 uske inkaar ke baad, vah karan ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin durghatana ke dwaara apane hi bete, banty, ko maar daalaa
 So he comes back and Pratibha tries to get revenge with the other sister Yashodhara

 He attempts to kill Karan
 abha uske judawaan siddharth, ek abhinayta or patakatha lekhak jiskaa vaastavik naam he ranchod se miltaa he
 It is learned that several years ago, Jagmohan won a case in "777", in which he later discovered that he was fighting for the wrong person
 unke maamle kii vajah se, nirdosh vyakti ko jise vah galat sabit kar diya apane bete ko kho diya
 a couple weeks later when Pratibha gave birth to Karan, she also gave birth to her twin Ranchod, but knew that there is no one except Jagmohan and a nanny
 vah nirdosh shri tiwari ranchod saunp diya or use naam diya he
 So later on Karan gets into a serious car accident and is missing, leaving Aura sad and regretful
 Ranchod agrees to help Aura for 11 days, masquerading as Karan so the family is not worried
 11 dinon ke baad puraa kar rahe hai, abha or ranchod mumbai lautne
 vahaan, abha karan ek aakhri baar ke liye khoj karne ke liye chalaa jaataa he or ranchod apane raste par chalaa jaataa he
 While Abha is searching for Karan, Ranchod gets into a vicious fight with drunken Dushyant, who is Yashodhara's only son
 to panchod aspataal main karan miltaa he, uski buree haalat dekhakar or sochaa ki karan ke bare main marane tha use vaada kiya he ki vah abha or yashodhara se parivaar ke baaki hisson kii raksha karegaa
 The Prasad family hopes to bring Karan and Abha Ranchod home, with the family planning a grand birthday party for both sons
 abha parivaar ke bare main karan, jab ranchod dukhad khabar bataao, prathit hota he karan ke rup main prastut sahamat pravesh karti he, ke bare main he
 Abha finds out that she is pregnant with Karan's child
 baad main yashodhara or dushyant buraai yojana parivaar ke sampark main he, haalanki ve abhi bhi batch
 ek dharmik holi utsav ke dauraan, rachod bataate hai ki vah parivaar sach kyon nahin bataaya or vah keval karan kii aakhri ichha ko puraa kar rahaa he ki
baad main yah pataa chalaa he ki karan jivit he or he dow arundhati, jo use ghar le or use ilaaj kaa faisla kiya he se bachaaya he
 Otherwise he will be sent to a government hospital and most likely will die
 As Karan does not listen and can stabilize his body, he names him Neil
 Shelly sees Karan's picture in the newspaper and decides to keep her away from Aura and Ranchod
 abha or ranchod anichhaa se shaadi ke baad ve mahasoos karan sabase mrit hone kii sambhaavna he or unke pariwaron ke donon se dabaav ke saath he
 He is then kidnapped by Karan Dushyant, who is actually trying to kidnap Ranchod
 haalanki, ve baahar lagata he ki yah galat aadmi oes or use car se baahar phenk
 vah dow arundhati, ek yuva mahatvakankshi nurse, jo tab use vyavhaar karata paaya jaataa he
 Abha Karan is still depressed over missing and Styles and Dushyant trips on a string down the stairs and loses her baby, despite a vain, dirty Ranchod's vain attempt to catch her and falls down the stairs

 In the Upanishad era, the Bhagavata religion was known as 'ekayan', which is a new designation of 'ekantik'
 chhandogya upanishad main bhoomavidya ke varnanaprasang main naarad ke dwaara adhit vidyaon main 'ekayanvidya' ke naam kaa pratham ullekh uplabdh hota he- rugvedan bhagavodhyemi yajurvedan samavedamatharvanan vakovakyamekayan c
 Ancient commentators differ about the meaning of this word
 rang ramanuj naamak shrivaishnav tikaakar kii sammati main 'ekayan' shabd veda kii 'ekayan shakha' kaa dyotak he jiskaa saakshaat sambandh bhagwat yaa vaishnav sampradaay se he
 Narada is the honorable Acharya of Panchatratiya devotion
 ve hi chhandogya ke purvokt prasang main ekayan vidya ke gyaata rup se ullikhit kiye gaye hai
 For this reason also it seems appropriate to adopt 'ekayan' learning in the meaning of Bhagavata scripture
 shukla yajurveda kii kaanv shakha kaa hi naam 'ekayan shakha' he, aisa 'kaanv shakhamahima sangrah' naamak granth main nagesh kaa kathan he
 This view is also confirmed by the 'jayaakhya Samhita'
 is samhita ke anusaar pancharaatr ke pravartak paanchon rishi, jinke naam aupgayan, kowshik, shandilya, bharadwaj tathaa monjayan hai, kaanv shakha ke adhyeta batalaaye gaye hai 
 As a result, both the terms 'ekantik' and 'ekayan' were used for the ancient Bhagavata sect; It is quite reasonable to believe this fact
 ekantik dharm kii pracheen samhitaon kii sankhya 108 ke upar batalaai jaati he jinamein ahirbudhnya, jayakhya tathaa brihad brahmsamhita mukhya hai
 In this, four subjects have been specially presented - knowledge, yoga, action and practice

 The personality and work of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi has been idealistic
 unka aacharan prayojanavaadee vichaardhaara se otprot tha
 Most people of the world know him as a great politician and social reformer
 par unka yah maananaa tha ki saamaajik unnati hetu shiksha kaa ek matvpurn yogadan hota he
 Therefore, Gandhiji also has a special contribution in the field of education
 unka moolmantra tha - 'shoshan-viheen samaaj kii sthapana karnaa'
 Everyone should be educated for that
 kyonki shiksha ke abhaav main ek swasth samaaj kaa nirmaan asambhav he
 Therefore, Gandhiji explained the objectives and principles of education and elementary education plan is a tangible form of his education
 atev unka shikshadarshan unako ek shikshashasthri ke rup main bhi samaaj ke saamne prastut karata he
 His contribution towards education was unique
 unka maananaa tha ki mere priy bharat main bacchon ko 3H kii shiksha arthath head hand heart kii shiksha di jaave
 Education should make them self-reliant and they can contribute significantly in making the country strong
 gandhiji bhartiya shiksha ko 'da beautiphul tree' kaha karte the
 The reason behind this was that from what Gandhi had read about India's education, it was found that education in India was subject to society rather than governments
 swa
 dow dharmpal prasiddh gandhivaadi chintak rahe hai
 He has done very important research on Indian knowledge, science, society, politics and education
 gandhi ke vaakya 'da beautiphul tree' ko jas kaa tas lekar dow dharmpal ne apana shodh shuru kiya or angarejon or usase purv ke samast dastavej khangale
 Whatever was found in India, they were taken from museums and libraries and the information that was available in England from the East India Company outside India and even from Sir Thomas Row to the British left, searched it there
 dharmpalji ne angarejakaaleen ghatnaon kaa jo aitihaasik anveshan kar yah sabit kiya ki jis prakaar un logon ne na keval hamaare arthshaastra or kutir udyog ko samaapt kar hamaare puure arthtantr ko das liya, balki bharat kaa saanskrithik, saahitiyik, naitik or aadhyatmik vikhandan bhi kiya jisase bharat apana bharatpan hi bhul gaya or angareji shiksha se aachchann yahan ke kuch bade gharaanon ke log bharat bhagya vidhaataa ban gaye
 Gandhiji has given the following basic principles of education: 7 se 14 varsh kii aayu ke baalkon kii nickshulk tathaa anivaary shiksha hoi The medium of instruction should be the mother tongue
 sakshartaa ko shiksha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Education is to develop the child's human qualities
 shiksha aisi ho jisase balak ke sharir, hriday, man or aatma kaa saamanjasypurna vikaas ho
 Education of all subjects should be imparted through local production industries
 shiksha aisi ho jo navayuvakon ko berogari se mukt kar sake
 According to Gandhiji, the meaning of education is the all-round development of the best qualities that go into the body and mind and soul of a child
 atah balak ke sarvangin vikaas hetu uske shaareerik, maansik, bauddhik evam aadhyatmik gunon kaa vikaas karnaa
 Gandhiji has divided the objectives of education into two parts
 shiksha kaa taatkaalik uddeshy The highest objective is the immediate objective which can be achieved quickly through regular education
 jo ki is prakaar he- Objective of earning a living: According to Gandhiji, education should be such that it can meet the economic needs, the child can become self-sufficient and free from unemployment
 saanskrithik uddeshy: gandhiji ne samskruti ko shiksha kaa aadhaar mana
 According to him, culture should be reflected in human behavior
 purna vikaas kaa uddeshy: unke anusaar sachhee shiksha vah he jiske dwaara baalkon ke shaareerik, maansik or aadhyatmik vikaas ho sake
 Moral or character development: Gandhiji has considered character and moral development as the proper basis of education
 mukti kaa uddeshy: gandhiji kaa adarsh ‘‘sa vidha yaa vimuktaye’’ arthath shiksha hi hamen samast bandhanon se mukti dilaati he
 Therefore, Gandhiji wanted to give spiritual freedom to self-development through education
 shiksha ke sarvocch uddeshy ke antargat ve satya athwa ishwar kii prapti par bal dete the
 Therefore, the ultimate and highest aim of man is to attain self-realization
 avinashlingam ke shabdon main ‘‘buniyadi shiksha hamaare rashtrapita kaa antim or sambhawatah mahanatam uphaar he
 '' san 1937 main gandhiji ne wardha main ho rahe ‘akhil bhartiya rashtriya shiksha sammelan’ jise ‘wardha shiksha sammelan’ kaha gaya tha
 In it he presented his new plan of basic education
 jo ki metric str tak angreji rahit tathaa udyogaan par aadhaarit thi
 The 'zakir Hussain Committee' was formed under the chairmanship of Dr
 Zakir Hussain, the then Principal of Jamia Millia and a plan for 'nai Talim' was prepared on the basis of the proposals passed by Gandhiji's education scholars and the conference 
 tathaa 1938 main haripur ke adhiveshan ne in report ko sweekruti di
 Which became famous as 'wardha-shiksha-yojana' and is the basis of basic education
 basic shiksha ke paathyakram kii avadhi 7 varsh kii he
 Free and compulsory education should be given to boys and girls aged 7 to 14 years
 shiksha kaa madhyam maatrubhaasha he
 The study of Hindi language is compulsory for boys and girls
 sampurna shiksha kaa sambandh aadharbhoot shilp se hota he
 By making education of selected crafts, good craftsmen should be made self-reliant
 shilp kii shiksha is prakaar di jaae ki balak uske saamaajik evam vaigyanik mahatv ko samaj sake
 Physical labor was given importance so that they could earn a living by learning the craft
 shiksha baalkon ke jivan, ghar, gram tathaa gramin udyogon, hastshilpon or vyavsaay ghanisht rup se sambandhit hon
 The items made by the children, which they can use and sell them, can make some expenditure on the school
 baalkon evam balikaon kaa samaan paathyakram rakhaa jaae
 Girls in sixth and seventh grades can take home science in place of foundational craft
 paathyakram kaa str vartmaan metric ke samakaksh ho
 English and religion are not taught in the syllabus
 chunki buniyadi shiksha rashtriya sabhyataa, samskruti ke najadik thi saath hi saath saamudayik jivan ke aadharbhoot vyavsaayon se judi hui thi
 And through the learned basic craft, a person could sustain his life
 atah yah shiksha hamaare jivan ke buniyaad yaa aadhaar se judi hui thi isliye iskaa naam buniyadi yaa aadharbhoot shiksha rakhaa gaya
 Gandhiji taught basic crafts under basic education curriculum such as: agriculture, spinning-weaving, wood, leather, clay work, book art, fisheries, fruit and vegetable gardening, home science for girls and instructive handicrafts suited to local and geographical needs Apart from this, mother tongue, mathematics, social studies and general science, art, Hindi, physical education etc
 were kept
 shikshan vidhi ko shikshan kaa vaastavik kaary-kriyaaon or anubhavon par anivaary rup se aadhaarit kiya
 According to him the teaching method should be practical
 baalkon ko vibhinn vishyon kii shiksha kisi aadharbhoot shilp ke madhyam se di jaae
 Emphasis was laid on learning by doing, learning by experience and learning through action
 gandhiji ne buniyadi shiksha main seekhney kii samavaay paddati kaa upyog kiya
 Under which he taught all subjects through some work or handicraft
 gandhiji kii shiksha sambandhi vichaardhaara kii praasangikta vartmaan pariprekshya main uparyukt vyakhya kaa moolyankan kiya jaae to is tathy par pahunchate hai ki gandhiji kaa shikshadarshan vartmaan pariprekshya main bhi praasangik he
 First of all, Gandhiji presented an education plan in accordance with the environment, keeping in view the Indian life, which is expected to transform into a new life in Indian society
 gandhiji hriday se adarshavaadi the kyonki ve jivan ke antim lakshya satya ko praapt karne kii prerana pradaan karata he
 Gandhi can also be called Puritan, because he emphasizes learning by performing actions according to the interest of the child
 unako prakrutivaadee isaliye kah sakate hai ki ve balak ko uski prakruti ke anusaar viksit karnaa chaahate the
 It is to be noted that in his teaching there was no special meaning among the three ideologies
 gandhiji dwaara pratipaadit shiksha ke siddhant jaise baalkon evam balikaon ko nickshulk evam anivaary shiksha diya jaae
 Today, we see many efforts being made to educate all sections of the country
 nickshulk, anivaary shiksha saath hi saath baalkon evam balikaon ke liye kai yojanaon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 So that more and more children can get education
 vartmaan main ham dekhte hai ki aaj yuvaaon ke paas kai tarah kii degree he parantu rojgaar nahin he
 Therefore, Gandhiji had pointed out this problem many years ago and he emphasized on industries based education under basic education so that the child can become self-sufficient by learning some or the other handicrafts
 berogari se mukti praapt kar sake
 Presently, practical education and vocational education are being emphasized
 gandhiji baalkon main maanviya gunon kaa vikaas karne par bal dete the
 Which has relevance even today because the destruction and devastation that is spreading today is increasing due to lack of humanity in humans
 gandhiji ne karke yaa kriya dwaara seekhney par bal diya he jo ki aaj bhi utana hi aavashyak he kyonki kriya yaa swayan karke seekhney par siikhaa hua gyaan sthai hota he jo har kshetra ke liye aavashyak he
 Gandhiji respected manual labor
 unke anusaar manushya ko apana kaary swayan karnaa chahie
 One should not depend on anyone
 saath hi saath bhedbhaav bhi mitata he
 Which is also necessary in today's perspective
 jo kaam kaa aadar karegaa vahi utpaadan kaary se jud saktaa he
 The purpose of economic, moral, cultural, citizenship given by Gandhiji as well as the establishment of Sarvodaya society under which labor will be valued, not money, feelings of affection and cooperation, not hatred and seclusion, abolition in place of exploitation and There will be a tendency to abandon the place of accumulation
 vartmaan main shoshan, ghrinaa, swaarth siddhi jaise kudharna ke kaaran markat, vinaash tathaa maanavtaa kaa hanan ho rahaa he
 Therefore, we can say that the objective of establishing Gandhiji's Sarvodaya Samaj has become essential today
 gandhiji ne dharm kii shiksha kaa bhi bahishkaar kiya
 Because they feared that the religions that are taught or followed create quarrels in place of peace
 vartmaan sthiti bhi is baat kii samarthak he
 Therefore, the principles, objectives, syllabus, teaching method of education given by Gandhiji are still as important for boys and girls, schools and society as before their important work Basic education or basic education to children, whether they are from cities or villages
 k belongs to all the best and permanent things
 evam baalkon ko swazlambi banane main madadgaar siddh hui he
 Their education is not only focused on mental development, but is also useful for physical, mental, moral and spiritual development

 US media in its news described the incident as the launch of a satellite and "two secret objects"
 kaaphi samay tak americanyon ko un "vastuon" kii prakruti kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa
 Covering this launch, the Soviet Union Telegraph Agency described GLONASS as a system that was "designed to track the positions of the Soviet Union's civil aviation aircraft, naval transport and boats used for fishing"
 1982 se april 1991 tak soviet sangh ne kul milakar 43 glonas sambandhi upgrahon or paanch pareekshan upgrahon kaa safal prakshepan kiya
 At the time of the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, twelve operational GLONASS satellites were operating in two aircraft, which was enough for limited use of the system
 roosi sangh ne upgrah samooh kaa niyantran apane haath main le liya or iskaa vikaas jari rakhaa
 In 1993, the system was formally declared operational, which now had 12 satellites, and in December 1995 the satellite group was finally brought to its optimum position, which included 24 operational satellites
 isane glonas kii parishuddhta ko america jeepies pranali ke baraabar laakar khadaa kar diya jisane do saal pehle sampoorn sanchaalan kshamta hasil kii thi
 With each of the first generation satellites operating for 3 years, the system required two launches every year to maintain the entire network of 24 satellites to retain full capacity

 a center of smokestacks with small orbit is located inside the orbit of the larger planets
 It is clear that big planets have an impact on the orbit of the smoke coming from the Oort cloud
 Jupiter is particularly affected by a large number of such smoke-filled masses whose mass is greater than the mass of all the other planets in the solar system

 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4
 The prefix is also added to indicate the nature of the comet

 Some people called it a falling star
 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind
 Human beings then had little knowledge about space
