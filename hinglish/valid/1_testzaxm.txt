 The people of the city appreciated his family
 dekhte hi dekhte samay badal gaya
 Sheela's husband became friends with bad people
 ab vah jald se jald karodpati banane ke khwab dekhne laga
 Therefore, he started on the wrong path and as a result he became Rodapati
 yani raste par bhatakate bhikhaari jaisi uski haalat ho gai thi
 Sheela's husband also got trapped in bad habits like alcohol, gambling, race, weed and marijuana
 doston ke saath use bhi sharaab kii aadat ho gai
 Thus he lost everything in race gambling

 She started spending most of her time in piety

 As if nectar was flowing from his eyes

 Sheela had a lot of peace on seeing her

 So Sheela shrugged and placed him on a torn sheet
 maanji boleen- kyon shila! mujhe pahachaanaa nahin? har shuukravaar ko lakshmi ke mandir main bhajan-kirthan ke samay main bhi vahaan aati hoon
 'despite this, Sheila could not understand anything
 phir maanji boleen- 'tum bahut dinon se mandir nahin ain atah main tumhen dekhne chali ai
 ' maanji ke ati prembhre shabdon se shila kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Tears welled up in her eyes and she wept bitterly
 maanji ne kaha- 'beti! sukh or dukh to dhoop or chaanv jaise hote hai
 Be patient daughter! Tell me all your problems 'maanji ke vyavhaar se shila ko kaaphi sambal mila or sukh kii aas main usne maanji ko apni sari kahani kah sunai

 All the wishes of this fast are fulfilled

 The second day was Friday

 The nature of the husband changed as soon as Prasad was eaten
 us din usne shila ko maaraa nahin, sataaya bhi nahin
 Sheela was very happy
 unke man main 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' ke liye shraddha bad gai
 Sheela performed 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' till twenty-one Friday with full devotion and devotion
 ikkisven shuukravaar ko maanji ke kahe mutabik udhyapan vidhi kar ke saat striyon ko 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kii saat pustaken uphaar main deen
 Then, after worshiping the image of Mother's' Dhanalakshmi Swaroop ', she started praying in her heart with emotion -' o Mother Dhanalakshmi! i made a vow to do 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', that fast is completed today

 With the effect of fasting, Sheela's husband became a good man and started working hard
 usne turant shila ke girvee rakhe gahane chhudaa liye
 There was a flood of money in the house
 ghar main pehle jaisi sukh-shanti chaa gai
 Seeing the effect of 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', other women of the locality also started doing 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' methodically
 vaibhavalakshmi vrath' udhyapan vidhisaat, gyaarah yaa ikkis, jitne bhi shuukravaaron kii mannath maangi ho, utane shuukravaar tak yah vrath puri shraddha tathaa bhaavana ke saath karnaa chahie
 On the last Friday, it should be done according to the classical method
 aakhri shuukravaar ko prasad ke liye kheer banani chahie
 The way we worship every Friday, we should do the same
 pujan ke baad maan ke saamne ek shriphal phoden phir kam se kam saat kunari kanyaon yaa saubhagyashaalee striyon ko kumkum kaa tilak lagaakar maan vaibhavalakshmi vrath katha kii pustak kii ek-ek prati uphaar main deni chahie or sabko kheer kaa prasad dena chahie
 After this, Goddess Lakshmiji should bow with reverence
 phir mataji ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko vandan karke bhav se man hi man prarthana karen- 'he maan dhanalakshmi! maine aapkaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne kii mannath maani thi, vah vrath aaj purna kiya he

 prastaavna ke maam se bhartiya samvidhan kaa saar, apekshaayen, uddeshy uskaa lakshya tathaa darshan prakat hota he
 The preamble declares that the constitution derives its power directly from the people and that is why it begins with the sentence 'we the people of India'
 kehar singh banaam bharat sangh ke vaad main kaha gaya tha ki samvidhan sabha bhartiya janata kaa sidhaa pratinidhitiv nahin karti at: samvidhan vidhi kii vishesh anukripa praapt nahin kar saktaa, parantu nyaayalay ne ise khaarij karte hue samvidhan ko sarvopari mana he jis par koi prashn nahin uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Preamble to the Constitution: samvidhan kii prastaavna 13 disambar 1946 ko jawahar laal nehru dwaara paas kii gayi prastaavna ko aamukh bhi kehete hai
 Parts 3 and 4 together are called 'the soul and consciousness of the constitution' because fundamental rights and policy directions play an important role in the creation of a country for any independent nation

 safavi vansh iran kaa ek rajvansh jinhone 1502 - 1730 tak raaj kiya
 For the first time in the reign of this dynasty, Shia Islam became established as Rajdharma

 Katappa continues to listen to his story of how he killed Bahubali


 kalkey se jeetne ke baad, mahishmati main amarendra bahubali ko bhavishya kaa raja or bhallaal dev ko senapati ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets her answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger
 kuntal samrajya par pinjariyon kaa hamalaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of Devasena's brother Kumar Verma, Amarendra foils the attack and saves Kuntal
 amarendra use bataa detaa he ki vah koun he or shivgami ke krodh ke bhay ko dur karne or use apni dulhan banane hetu raji karne kii koshish karata he
 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he
 After 25 years, Mahendra Bahubali, son of Bhallaldev and Amarendra Bahubali, has a fierce battle and Bhallaldev is defeated in this war

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans
 kisi jati ke itihaas main vaastukritiyaan mahatvapurn tab hoti hai, jab unamem kisi ansh tak sabhyataa, samruddhi or vilasita aa jaati he or unamem jati ke garv, pratishtha, mahatvakanksha or aadhyatmikta kii prakruti purnataya abhivyakt hoti he
 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization
 jahaan tak puratatviya prabhaav he, yah thik he kintu vaastukala ke itihaas par ek sankshipt drushtipaat se yah spasht ho jayega ki maanav ke pracheenatam prayaas shikariyon ke adikalin gupha-awaason, charavaahon ke charm-tambuon or kisaanon ke jhopadon ke rup main dekh padate hai
 Boat dwellings and tree huts are ancient features
 dharmik smarak banane ke adikalin prayaas pathar or lakdi kii baad ke rup main the
 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later
 yugon ke drut vikascram main vaastukala vikasi, dhali or maanav kii parivartansheel aavashyaktaaon ke - uski suraksha, kaary, dharm, anand or anya yugaprarvatak chihnon, anuroop bani
 The plain form of Egypt, the standard design of China, the exotic and rich nature of India, the majestic majesty of Maya and Aztec of Mexico, the highly developed devotionals of Greece, the complex types of buildings that served the multiple needs of the Roman Empire, the ancient marched churches
 , The Great Gothic Church Building and Chitropam Fort, the excellent configuration and proportions of Turkish buildings and the grand architecture of European revival Numeric monuments present an account of the continuous development of historical architecture
 ye sab imaaraten maanav vikaas ke mahaan yugon kii ore ingit karti hai, jinamein vaastukala jaateey jivan se atyadhik sambandhit hone ke kaaran un jatiyon kii pratibha or mahatvakanksha kaa, jinaki unke smarakon par suspasht chhap hai, digdarshan karaati hai
 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in tamaam saalon main vaastukala samayik chetana paryaavaran tathaa sthaneey prishthbhumi ke saamanjasy main viksit hui
 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people
 aaj kuch aise vaastu hai jo bhoot kaa anusaran karne main hi santusht hai kuch anya hai jo videshi dhang kaa anukaran karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he

 nagaraj raaj comics kii peshkash, ek bhartiya comic book kirdaar he jise yaqinan lambey samay se jivit bhartiya ection comic super hero kaha ja saktaa he
 Created by Sanjay Gupta in the late 1980s, Nagraj has drastically changed both the look as well as the story in his 25 years of life
 is tathy ke baavjood ki kisi samay bharat main comic samskruti lagbhag gaayab ho gai thi, phir bhi uske prashansak aadhaar main vruddhi hui or uski pehali anemated film ke jari hone ke baad isamen jabardast badhotaree kii ummid he
 The first issue of Nagaraja was written by the well-known writer Parashuram Sharma and was illustrated by Pratap Malik
 malik ne 1995 tak lagbhag 50 ankon ke liye is charitra kaa safaltaapurvak chithran kiya tha
 From 1995 onwards, illustration was taken over by illustrator and writer Anupam Sinha
 aaj nagaraj jo kuch bhi he, vah bhartiya comic udyog ke in diggaj pratap malik or anupam sinha kii vajah se he
 The character of Nagaraja is believed to be inspired by the mythical wishful serpent, the historical venomous human
 uski kahaniyon main puraana, kalpana, jaadu or vigyaan galp kaa samrudh mishran he
 Many fans of Nagaraja believe that over time Nagaraja comics have developed a serpent myth of their own which is unique to popular Indian beliefs about snakes among the masses
 nagaraj kii multah kalpana antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke ek dushman ke rup main kii gai thi
 Interestingly, in its first issue, Nagaraj was promoted as an international terrorist weapon by the evil scientist Professor Nagmani
 nagaraj ko is pehle mishan main adivasee bhakton, sanpon or rahasyamay 300 se bhi zyaada umr ke gorakhnath baba naamak buudhe sadhu se sangrakshit ek mandir se devi kii murti churaane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 Nagaraja succeeded in his task, but was defeated against Gorakhnath and his mysterious black mongoose Shikangi
 gorakhnath ne uskaa man pard liya or pataa lagaaya ki profosar naagamani ne nagaraj ko apane niyantran main rakhane ke liye uske sir main ek capsule ke rup main man ko niyantrit karne vaale yantra kaa pratyaropan kiya he
 Gorakhnath underwent surgery and removed the capsule from Nagaraj's head, freeing Nagraj from the control of Professor Nagmani
 iske baad nagaraj baba gorakhnath kaa shishy ban gaya or usne prithvi se aparaadh or aatankwaad ko khatm karne kii qasam khai
 tab se nagaraj ne teen baar vishwa kaa daura kiya or kai khalnaayakon or aatankwaadiyon ko haraaya
 Samprati Nagraj in a fictional city metropolis with his own secretly owned TV
 The channel's employee is living as Raj
 pracheen kaal main jab devtaa bina kisi pratibandh ke prithvi par vicharan karte the, tab vahaan takshaknagar naamak ek samrajya maujuud tha jis par raja takshakraj or rani lalita kaa shashan tha
 The ruling couple had no concern except one; They did not have any child
 rajkumaar yaa rajkumaari kii anupasthiti ne ekmaatr nagapasha ko uskaa sambhavit vaaris banaaya
 nagapasha samraat kaa samroop chota bhai tha, jo yah jaanakar ki keval vahi singhaasana kaa sambhavit uttaradhikari he, chintarahit bhavy jivan jeene laga tha
 As time passed, the queen became depressed due to the absence of her child
 The king understood the reason for the depression of the queen and they also started being upset
 The husband and wife used to worship their family deity Dev Kalajayi for Ashish
 dev kaaljayi ko bhi unke dukh kaa kaaran pataa tha, atah ek din unhone mahaan santan paane kaa unhen aashirwad diya
 Her blessing was successful and soon the queen became pregnant and a wave of happiness ran across the state except for Nagpash
 is santan ke janm kaa matlab uske liye singhaasana khona tha, atah bachche ke paidaa hone se pehle hi use maarane kaa usne nirnay liya
 One day while Rani Dev was going to worship Kalajayi, Nagpash replaced Prasad with a dead mongoose in a covered plate of the deity's offering
 nagdevataa ko gussa aa gaya or unhone apni vifailli saans se rani ko behosh kar diya
 The king apologizes to the deity and begs to cure his wife but the deity refuses to do so, after which desperate Raj attempts to commit suicide
 bhakt kii mrityu jhelane main aksham, dev kaaljayi ne unhen rani kii jaan bachaane kaa ek upaay bataaya
 unhone raja ko mani di or use rani kii dawa se abhikriya karne ke liye kaha
 mani rani ke sharir se sara vish bachche ke sharir kii ore palat degaa, lekin vish ke bure prabhaav ke kaaran rani apni prajnan kshamta kho degi
 Mourning prevailed throughout the kingdom and the king also became unhappy
 nagapasha bahut khush tha ki vah akele vaaris ke rup main batch gaya he
 When the child was born, everyone thought that he was dead because his whole body was blue and no signs of life were seen in it
 hinduon kii pratha ke anusaar navjaat shishu ko nadi main phenk diya gaya
 Nagpash happily woke up and went straight to the drunken Dev Kalajayi and asked him to hand over the royal treasury, stating that he was the sole heir to the throne and hence he had authority over the royal treasury
 dev kaaljayi ne inkaar kar diya or usase kaha ki singhaasana kaa "asli uttaradhikari" jivit he or jab samay aae tab khajaana use saunp diya jayega
 naaraaz hokar nagapasha ne devtaa ke viruddh apni talwaar uthaai lekin vishaal saanp kii poonch ke maatr jatke se dur ja gira
 nagapasha do katoron par gira, ek main behad jaharila vish tha, jisane uske chehre ko nasht kar diya gaya or uske khun main mil gaya or duusare main amrit tha, jisane use amar bana diya
 The simultaneous influence of the two made Nagpash an immortal venomous man
 us samay nagapasha apane sharir ke badlaav ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or behosh ho gaya
 When Dev Kalajayi informed the king about these events, he came to know that his son was not dead and he also realized the possible dangers towards his life
 atah unhone tilism ke mahaan gyani apane vafaadaar jyotishi vedacharya ko aadesh diya ki ve khazaane ko aise tilism main sangrakshit karen, jise keval unka betaa tod sake
 vedacharya ne dev kaaljayi ke sahyog se tilism taiyaar kiya taaki sunishchit ho ki sivaay raja ke bete ke koi us tilism ko todane main sakasham na ho, amar nagapasha bhi nahin
 jab nagapasha ko hosh aayaa to usne mahasoos kiya ki vah khajaana kho chukaa he
 Angry, he killed the king and queen
 jivan-kriya rahit sthiti main shishu nadi main bahata hua jhaadiyon main jaakar funs gaya
 He stayed there for a long time
 is bich sarp devtaa dev kaaljayi chiraayu ichhadhari naagon ke shaasha raja maniraj or unki patni manika rani ke sapanom main prakat hue, jo maanviya drushti se ojhal nagadweep naamak hind mahaasaagar ke ek dweep main chhip kar jivan bitaa rahe the
 He told the baby's location and asked them to treat him
 He did as he was told and found the baby, and he also came to know that he was more toxic than the great serpent Mahatma, the island's great serpent, indicating that he possessed the divine poison of God
 shuru main raaj vaidya anishchit the ki ve shishu kaa ilaaj kar paaenge yaa nahin, lekin swayan dev kaaljayi ne raja se ilaaj ke liye kaha tha isliye ve aashwast hue ki unka upachaar safal hoga
 niyamon ke anusaar, kisi ko bhi is dweep main kisi bahari vyakti ko laane kii anumati nahin thi, isliye raja ne uski upasthiti ko gupt rakhane kaa faisalaa liya
 Many years passed and the results of the treatment started to appear, although there was still no life-activity in it, but the color of the baby gradually started changing to green
 The king gave this news to the queen and they decided to adopt the child as they had no children of their own
 unke nirnay ko dusht tantric vishandhar ne sun liya jo dweep kaa shaasha bananaa chahta tha, lekin mahatma kaldoot se darataa tha
 He attacked the secret area where the infant was kept and ran away with him, but fearing the wrath of God decided not to kill the infant and placed him back in the river bushes where he was found
 uski yojana vifal hui kyonki jald hi rani ne garbh dhaaran kiya or ek beti ko janm diya, jiskaa naam visarpi rakhaa gaya
 Vyasandhar never realized that the baby he had left to wander came to his senses, first his face and then his body like normal humans and he started crying
 paas ke mandir ke ek pujari ne use dekha or use profesar naagamani ko bhent swaroop diya jo paas ke jangal main sanpon kii talash main bhatak rahaa tha
 For unknown reasons, Purohit tells a false story that the infant is of a woman who was raped and who was a devotion to the serpent god and that the child is blessed to become a willful serpent and requested Nagamani to raise him something In such a way that he can avenge his mother
 naagamani ne samaj liya ki pujari jhooth bol rahe hai lekin vah shishu ko apane saath le gaya
 The baby's blood test showed that his white blood cells contained microscopic snakes instead of blood
 shishu main asaadhaaran rogahar shaktiyaan thi or vah atyant vishaiylla tha
 He raised a child who later became Nagraj
 nagaraj ko naagamani profesar kii ek sristi ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh prastut kiya gaya
 He was being made a unique assassin machine and his original plan was to hire Nagraj as the highest bidder among villains and terrorist groups around the world
 profesar naagamani ne apane anya praayogic pariyojnaon or antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke liye patte par uskaa istemaal kiya
 Nagmani always claimed that his powers were developed by giving Nagaraja parts of the snake venom, poisoning him
 unhone daawa kiya ki uskaa vish 1000 vibhinn prajatiyon ke saanp ke kaatane kaa parinaam he or uski shaktiyaan mrit ichhadhari naag ke bhasma se ilaaj se viksit hui hai
 The fact was that Nagaraja was more poisonous than any snake species, because his venom was supernatural
 mote taur par aakaar badalane vaale hindu myth ke aadhaar par, nagaraj apni rakt koshikaon main palane vaale sookshm sanpon se shakti paata tha or use vifailli saans vish-phunkaar or kaat, tatkaal upachaar shaktiyaan or uski kalai se alag se nikalne vaale yaa rassiyaan, parachute tathaa uski kalpana ke anusaar vibhinn aakaar grahan karne vaale sanpon jaisi asankhya alokik shaktiyaan praapt hai
 It is believed that if he bites someone or someone bites him, then his venom has the power to smelt the body of any living animal, even sharper than potassium cyanide
 apane pehle mishan ke liye, use das lakh main bechaa gaya tha or uddeshy ek pracheen pratimaa ko hasil karnaa tha
 Nagaraja succeeds, but then the monk "baba Gorakhnath" fails him, freeing his mind from the control of "professor Nagamani"
 gorakhnath kii ek nai shanti kii duniya main jaag kar, nagaraj vishwa se aatankwaad ko samaapt karne kii qasam khaataa he or apana lakshya hasil karne kii disha main aage badhata he
 Nagaraj's powers were also limited in the early numbers, sometimes he was defeated by powerful human opponents and temporarily fainted, his strength was also very human like that of his opponents seeing a car picker
 Was taken aback by the power of barason baad nagaraj itnaa shaktishaalee ho gaya ki vah na keval akele girti hui kaaron ko tham letaa tha balki aasaani se chizon ko bahya antariksh main phenk detaa tha
 It is notable and perhaps even ironic that Nagaraja has now been transformed into a mythological-magical creature who has to face his fantastical creatures as enemies , including elements of witchcraft and time and space travel
 Are connected kai log ise nagaraj comics kii nirantar, jabardast lokapriyata main vruddhi ke kaaran ke rup main dekhte hai
 However, purists still claim that they prefer more realistic and more practical stories from which Nagaraja originated
 nagaraj yakeenan raaj jagat kaa sabase adhik shaktishaalee super hero he or apane samay kaa sabase shaktishaalee ichhadhari naag
 baar-baar, usne sheshnag, vasukidev, kaaljayi mahaan sarp devataaon ko chunauti dene kii kshamta dikhaai he or kaldoot, triphana, mahavyal or sheetanag kumaar jaise naagon ko parrast kiya he, jo apni prajati ke sabase taqatvar naagon main gine jate hai
 Nagaraja in his early numerals was a wanderer who, like an avalanche, wreaked havoc for the enemies of mankind
 chunki chhadam vyaktitv kii zarurat nahin thi, nagaraj ke paas koi maujuud nahin tha, lekin vah apni pahchaan chhipaane ke liye khud ko ek overkot main or aksar ek topi se chipa detaa tha
 The costume he used to disguise his true identity, he was given the name of disguise by his fans because often no one came to know that the person standing before him was Nagraj himself
 nagaraj ne apane naveenatam vaishvik aatankwaad series main isi chhadam vyaktitv ko apanaaya he
 Nagaraj takes off his hat and overcoat in public immediately due to fear of not being identified in an emergency
 uskaa vigat chhadam vyaktitv tha raaj, jo kahani main prastut kaalpanik company bharti communications main anaadi kism kaa sampark adhikari tha
 He pretends to be afraid of snakes, in his secret identity
 vah chashma or theth bijnes suut pahentaa he tathaa bahut hi darpok or saral vyakti he
 It is very similar to the character of Superman / Clark Kent, whose costumes, hair sorting and the use of goggles to disguise themselves are similar
 haalanki praarambhik chhadam vyaktitv fatum par aadhaarit tha, yah chhadam vyaktitv superman par aadhaarit he
 Recently forced to reveal his true identity in the series "after Nagraj", Nagaraja had to change his pseudo personality again due to circumstances
 He now works as the manager of the new security agency "snake Eyes" according to the current storyline
 uskaa nayaa naam he nagaraj singh
 yah sushri saudangi ke swaamitv main he jo uske sharir main rahati he or ichhadhari naag he
 In Nagaraj comics, innumerable enemies of Nagaraja have appeared, many were killed, but some survived to reappear
 Here is a list of the major surviving enemies of Nagraj, who can be expected to return in future scores: apane karmon se nagaraj ne kai dost banaae, jinamein kai keval ek baar dikhaai die, kuch anek baar or bahut kam uski kahaniyon main jagah banaate hue, yada-kada prakat hote hue sthai kirdaar ban gaye
