haalanki, aise nirupan computing prakriya jatil he or iske parinaam ko aise aakaar ke suchakon kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he jo ghaataanki rup se dogune bade hai
 In this sense, regular expressions can denote well-organized language, precisely the category of language accepted by regular finite automata
 haalanki phir bhi susanhati main ek ullekhneey antar he
 Some categories of well-organized languages can be described by regular finite automata, whose size exponentially increases to the smallest regular expression
 bhashaaen hi yahaan maanak udhaaharan hai
 The Lk character {{0} a, b} whose last letter is equal to ka with all its strings
 ek ore, l 4 ko varnit karne vaale regular oxpraishan ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^{*}a} diya hua he
 This pattern gives the normalization indicator in Lk duusari ore, yah vidit he ki Lk bhashaa ko sweekaar karata hua niatatmak parimit autometon ke paas kai sthitiyon main kam se kam 2k ke hona jaruri he
 Fortunately, more common than regular expressions is simple mapping from non-finite to finite automata, which does not suddenly assume such a large explosive size; This is why nfas are often used as alternative representations of well-organized languages
 nfas chomski anukram ke tip-3 grammers ke saral parivartan hai
 Finally, it is worth noting that many regular expression engines in the world apply features that cannot be described in terms of formal language theory by regular expression; See below for more information on this subject
 jaisaa ki udaahranon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he, vibhinn regular oxpraishan usee bhashaa ko abhivyakt kar sakate hai: ritivaad anaavashyak he
 It is possible to write in the algorithm between the given regular expressions to decide whether the mentioned languages are essentially the same
 This reduces each expression to the extent of the minimum deterministic finite state machine and determines whether they are homogeneous equivalents
 is anaavashyaktaa ko kis had tak nikaal diya ja saktaa he? kya ham regular oxpraishan kaa ek rochak subset khoj sakate hai jo puri tarah suchak ho? clin tara or set kaa gathbandhan spashtatah aavashyak he, lekin shaayad ham unke prayog par roak laga sakate hai
 This can turn into a surprisingly difficult problem

 paaramparik Unix regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas ne aam paripati kaa anusaran nahin kiya, lekin ek upkaran se duusare upkaran main aksar antar rahata tha
 The IEEE POSIX Basic Regular Expression Standard was designed specifically for inverse compatibility with traditional syntax, but it provided a common standard that has been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression devices, although It still often has some variations or additional features
 aise anek upkaran hai jo cmand line vishyon ke saath ERE vaakya-vinyas ko sahaara dete hai
 In the BRE syntax, most of the letters are taken in a literal sense - they match each other
 The exceptions listed below are called beyond characters or separated by sequences
 udhaaharan: Beyond letters means the opposite of syntax of POSIX extended regular expressions for some letters, avoiding the backslash
 is vaakya-vinyas main hi, ek bekaslash ke kaaran meta kairactor ko shabdic aksharon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 So for example, \ is now and \ { \ } is now {}
 Also, \ n has been omitted for previous references and is included beyond the following letters: udhaaharan: | dog corresponds with "cat" or "dog"
 POSIX vistaarit regular oxpraishan kaa prayog aksar aadhunik Unix prayojyata ke saath cmand line flag -E ko shaamil kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Since many categorized categories of characters are selected local settings, some of the POSIX standard letter categories or categories are shown in the following table: POSIX aksharon kii shreniyon kaa prayog keval koshthak suchakon ke andar hi ho saktaa he
 For example, ab] corresponds only to upper case capital letters and lowercase letters "a" and "b"

 Because of its widely suggestive capabilities, many other usability and programming languages have adopted syntax like Perl - for example, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework, and w3c's XML

 In standard expressions standard modifiers are greedy, meaning they match as many times as they can, leaving the rest to be a new match with the regex

 While this problem can be avoided in many ways, modern regular expression tools allow a quantizer to be characterized as sluggish, followed by a question mark after the quantizer, or by using modifiers that reverse the measureer's greed
 gives 
 Indicators first try to match the least, using the sluggish measure

 Patterns for Chaotic Languages many features derived from modern regular expression collections provide suggestive capabilities that exceed those of well-organized languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai karyanvayan up suchakon ke samoohikaran kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usee suchak main mail karaane kii keemat yaad dilaate hai
 This means that a pattern may correspond to repeated words, such as "papa" or "wikiwiki", which in formal language theory is called squares

 However, the language of squares is not well-organized

 It has named the regular expression vocabulary, which has many different meanings for formal language theory and pattern
 is kaaran, kuch log regex yaa keval pattern shabdaawalee kaa prayog parvarti kii vyakhya main karte hai
 Larry Wall, author of the Perl programming language, writes about the design of Perl 6 in an essay: kam se kam teen alag-alag kalam vidhiyaan kalanvidhi hai, jo nirdhaarit karti hai ki ek diya gaya regular oxpraishan kis prakaar ek string ke saath mail khata he
 Two formal language theories dependent on the oldest and fastest results that accepts the conversion of each non-deterministic finite position machine into a deterministic finite position machine
 DFA kaa spasht rup se nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he or tab iske parinamswaroop input par ek baar main ek pratik chinh par parichaalit hota he
 Creating a DFA for the size of a regular expression at the cost of "O" takes time and memory, but it can only run in o time on a string of n sizes
 ek vaikalpik prayaas NFA ko sidhe anukaran karnaa he, maang karne par anivaary rup se prayek DFA sthiti kaa nirmaan or tab agle kadam par sambhawatah caching ke saath ise baahar nikaal dena
 yah DFA ko antarnihit rakhata he or nirmaan kii ghaataank laagat se bachaa ja saktaa he, lekin chalan laagat o tak bad jaati he
 This explicit step is called the DFA algorithm and the underlying step is called the NFA algorithm
 As both can be seen in different ways in implementing the same DFA, they are also often called algorithms without discrimination
 ye kalan vidhiyaan tej hai lekin samoohikrut upasuchakon ko lautaane ke liye unka prayog sust parimann evam isi prakaar kii visheshtaayen pechida hai
 The third algorithm is to match the input string with the pattern via the back track
 is kalanvidhi ko aamtaur par NFA kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aspasht he
 Its running time can be exponential, which its simple implementation reveals when matching against indicators such as * b which has both alternation and infinite quantification
 kalanvidhi par jor daalate hai ki sthanapann maamalon kii babbti hui ghaataanki sankhya par vichaar karen
 adhik jatil karyanvayan aksar chihnit or gatisheel karte hai yaa saadhaaran maamalon ko radd kar detii hai, jab unka chalan mand ho jaataa he
 Although back tracking implementations guarantee an exponential in the worst case scenario, they provide much greater flexibility and pointer power
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi karyanvayan jo bakarefrences ke prayog kii anumati detaa he yaa parl dwaara lagu kiye gaye vibhinn ekstensionas ko karyanvit karata he, use back trekking karyanvayan kaa avashya prayog karnaa chahie
 Some implementations provide two of the best algorithms by first running fast DFA to find out if the regular expressions are even slightly matching with the string, and only in this case possibly a dim back tracking match

 Premchand is one of the greatest Indian writers in Hindi and Urdu
 mul naam dhanpat raay shrivastav, premchand ko nawab raay or munshi premchand ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing his contribution in the field of novels, the famous novelist of Bengal, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, addressed him as novel Samrat
 premchand ne hindi kahani or upanyaas kii ek aisi parampara kaa vikaas kiya jisane puri sadi ke sahitya kaa maargdarshan kiya
 Premchand laid the foundation of the realistic tradition of literature by deeply influencing an entire generation
 unka lekhan hindi sahitya kii ek aisi viraasat he jiske bina hindi ke vikaas kaa adhyayan adhuraa hoga
 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor
 beesvin shatee ke purvarddh main, jab hindi main takneekee suvidhaon kaa abhaav tha, unka yogadan athulaneey he
 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh
 premchand kaa janm 31 july 1880 ko varanasi ke nikat lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya
 At the age of 13, he read tilism-e-hoshruba and got acquainted with the novels of famous Urdu writers Ratananath 'sharasar', Mirza Hadi Ruswa and Maulana Sharr

 His early life was a struggle because his mother died at the age of seven and his father died at the age of fourteen
 unka pehla vivaah un dinon kii parampara ke anusaar pandrah saal kii umr main hua jo safal nahin rahaa
 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time
 unhone vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan kiya or 1906 main doosraa vivaah apni pragatisheel parampara ke anuroop bal-vidhwaa shivarani devi se kiya
 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai

 His last novel Mangal Sutra was completed by his son Amrit
 premchand aadhunik hindi kahani ke pitamah or upanyaas samraat maane jate hai
 Thus his literary life started in 1901, but his first Hindi story was published in the December issue of Saraswati magazine in 1915 under the name Saut and in 1936 the last story was called Kafan

 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala
 He presided over the conference of the All India Progressive Writers Association in 1936 in Lucknow
 unhone mohan dayaram bhavanani kii ajanta senetone company main kahani-lekhak kii naukari bhi kii
 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he
 Dr
 Kamalkishore Goenka has published the entire hindi-urdu story of Premchand under the name Premchand Kahani Rachnavali
 unke anusaar premchand ne kul 301 kahaniyaan likhi hai jinamein 3 abhi aprapya hai
 Premchand's first story collection titled Soze Vatan was published in June 1908
 isi sangrah kii pehali kahani duniya kaa sabase anmol ratan ko aam taur par unki pehali prakashit kahani mana jaataa rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Goenka, Worldly Love and desh-prem published in the April issue of Zamana, an Urdu monthly magazine originating from Kanpur, is actually his first published story
 unke jivan kaal main kul nau kahani sangrah prakashit hue- 'sapt saroj', 'navnidhi', 'prempurnima', 'prem-pachisi', 'prem-pratimaa', 'prem-dwadashi', 'samaryatra', 'maansarovar' : bhaag ek va do or 'kafan'
 After his death, his stories were published in 8 parts titled 'mansarovar'
 premchand sahitya ke mudradhikaar se mukt hote hi vibhinn sampadakon or prakashkon ne premchand kii kahaniyon ke sankalan taiyaar kar prakashit karaae
 His stories have diversity of subject and craft
 unhone manushya ke sabhi virgon se lekar pashu-pakshiyon tak ko apni kahaniyon main mukhya paatr banaaya he
 The problems of farmers, laborers, women, Dalits, etc
 have been depicted seriously in their stories
 unhone samajasudhar, deshprem, swadhinata sangram aadi se sambandhit kahaniyaan likhi hai
 His historical stories and love stories also proved to be quite popular
 premchand kii pramukh kahaniyon main ye naam liye ja sakate hai- 'panch parameshwar', 'gulli danda', 'do belon kii katha', 'idgah', 'bade bhai sahab', 'pus kii raat', 'kafan', 'thakur kaa kuan', 'sadgati', 'budhi kaaki', 'tawan', 'vidhwans', 'doodh kaa daam', 'mantra' aadi
 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya
 'premchand: Miscellaneous Context' edited by Amritrai is actually a compilation of Premchand's articles
 premchand ke lekh prakaashan santhaan se 'kuch vichaar' sheershak se bhi chape hai
 Premchand's famous writings include the following articles - Purpose of Literature, Old Age New Age, Benefits of Swaraj, Story Art, Some thoughts about the Qaumi language, Unity of hindi-urdu, Mahajani Civilization, Upanayas, Literature in life
 Location etc
 premchand ek safal anuvadak bhi the
 He also translated the works of writers of other languages whom he read and were influenced by
 'tollstoy kii kahaniyaan', galsvardi ke teen naatakon kaa 'hadtaal', 'chaandi kii dibiya' or 'nyaay' naam se anuwaad kiya
 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 prem chandra ko log aaj unki kaabiliyat kii vajah se yaad karte hai jo vivaadon ko bahut kam kar detii he Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature
 premchand hindi cinema ke sabase adhik lokapriy sahityakaron main se hai
 Satyajit Rai made memorable films on two of his stories
 1977 main shatranj ke khilaadi or 1981 main sadgati
 Two years after his death, Subramaniam made the film in 1938 on the novel Sevasadan in which Subbalakshmi played the lead role
 1977 main mrinal sen ne premchand kii kahani kafan par aadhaarit oka uri katha naam se ek telugu film banaai jisko sarvshereshth telugu film kaa rashtriya puraskaar bhi mila
 Godan in 1963 and embezzlement in 1966 became popular films
 1980 main unke upanyaas par bana tivi dharawahik nirmala bhi bahut lokapriy hua tha
 The credit for distinguished Premchand in Hindi literature and criticism is given to Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma
 unhone premchand par do pramukh kitaaben likhin- 'premchand' or 'premchand or unka yug'
 Amritrai and Madangopal did the work of saving Premchand's letters
 premchand par hue nae adhyayanon main kamalkishor goyanka or dow dharmaveer kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Kamalkishore Goenka has edited 'premchand's Unreachable Literature' and 'premchand Encyclopaedia' along with highlighting the weak sides of Premchand's life
 dow dharmaveer ne dalit drushti se premchand sahitya kaa mulyankan karte hue 'premchand : samant kaa munshi' va 'premchand kii neeli ankhen' naam se pustaken likhi hai
 On July 31, 1980, a postage stamp worth 30 paise was issued by the Indian Postal Service Department in memory of Premchand
 gorakhpur ke jis skool main ve shikshak the, vahaan premchand sahitya santhaan kii sthapana kii gai he

 Premchand's wife Shivrani Devi wrote his biography by name in Premchand's house and has exposed the part of his personality that people were unaware of
 yah pustak 1944 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi, lekin sahitya ke kshetra main iske mahatv kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ise dubaara 2005 main sanshodhit karke prakashit kii gai, is kaam ko unke hi naati prabodh kumaar ne anjaam diya

 The Pentium dual-core brand was used for Intel's mainstream x86-structured microprocessors from 2006 to 2009 when it was renamed Pentium
 procesar yaa to 32-bit vaale yonah yaa 64-bit vaale merom-2em, alendel or woolfdel-3em kor par aadhaarit hai, jo mobile yaa desktop computer ko lakshya kar taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Pentium dual-core processors are placed above the Celeron but below the Core and Core 2 in Intel's product types, according to features, price, and performance in the given clock frequency
 pentium dul-kor overklocking ke liye bhi adhik lokapriy pasand tha, kyonki yah kam keemat par sarvshereshth pradarshan pradaan kar saktaa he
 In 2006, Intel announced plans to reintroduce low-cost core microarchitecture processors based on single-core conro-l but less than 1 megabyte of cash as a structural product after the Pentium trademark was removed from the market 
 The identification numbers of those employed pentiums were similar to the subsequent pentium dual-core microprocessors, but the first digit being "1" instead of "2", indicated their single-core viability
 1 mabibite cash vaala ek single-kor conro-l ko utana sakasham nahin mana gaya ki vah niojit pentiyamon kaa seleronon ke saath antar kar saktaa tha, isliye uskaa sthaan dul-kor vaale sipiu ne le liya or "dul-kor" ko us shrenee main shaamil kar liya
 Throughout 2009, Intel changed the name from Pentium dual-core to Pentium in its publications
 Some processors were sold under both names, but recent E5400 to E6800 desktops and SU4100 / T4x00 mobile processors were not officially part of the Pentium dual-core range
 is brands kaa upyog karne vaala pratham procesar 2007 ke aarambh main notebook computer main dikhaai diya
 pentium T2060, T2080 or T2130 naam vaale un processron main 32-bit kaa pentium M-vyutpann yonah kor tha, evam vah 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor duo T2050 ke lagbhag samaan tha
 All three of them had a 533 mhz FSB that connected the CPU to memory
 intel ne laptop nirmaataaon ke anurodh par pentium dul-kor viksit kiya
 Subsequently on June 3, 2007, Intel released desktop Pentium dual-core branded processors known as the E2140 and E2160
 baad main sitambar 2007 main ek E2180 model jari kiya gaya
 These processors support Intel 64 extensions, which are based on the recent 64-bit core microarchitectored Allendale core
 ve 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor 2 duo E4300 procesar ke lagbhag samaan the
 They both had an 800 mhz FSB
 unhone intel seleron se upar ke procesar vaale saste bazaar ko apana lakshya banaaya jinaki visheshta keval 512 kilobite vaali L2 cash thi
 One such move brought a change to the Pentium brand and shifted it to the cheaper category, rather than its former position with the mainstream / premium brand
 These are highly capable of overclocking cpus
 alendel procesar ke mobile sanskaran merom-2m ko bhi 2007 main shuru kiya gaya, jisaki visheshta 1 megabite vaali L2 cash kintu T23xx processron ke saath keval 533 MT / s FSB thi
 The bus clock was later increased to 667 MT / s for T3xxx Pentium processors made from the same dye
 intel dwaara 45 nanometer vaale E5200 model ko agast 31, 2008 ko jari kiya gaya, jisamen 65 nanometer vaale E21xx shrinkhalaa main 2 megabite kii L2 cash or 2
5 gigahertz kii kaald gati thi
 The E5200 model is also a highly capable processor to overclock, with some highly enthusiastic models achieving a clock speed of up to 6 ghz using liquid nitrogen refrigeration
 intel ne is kor kaa upyog karte hue E6500K model jari kiya
 The model features an open multiplier, but is currently being sold only in China
 penrin kor merom kor evam intel ke pentium dul-kor microprocessron kii mobile shrinkhalaa ke 45 nanometer sanskaran kaa parvarti he
 In this the FSB is increased from 667 mhz to 800 mhz and the voltage is reduced
 intel ne pratham penrin aadhaarit pentium dul-kor, T4200 disambar 2008 main jari kiya
 Later, mobile Pentium T4000, SU2000 and SU4000 processors based on Penryn were sold in the market as Pentium
 2010 ke aarambh main pentium dul-kor brands band ho chukaa he evam iskaa sthaan pentium naam ne le liya he
 The desktop E6000 series and oem-only mobile Pentium SU2000 and all later models were always called Pentiums, but processors with desktop Pentium dual-core E2000 and E5000 series had to be renamed
 yadhyapi pentium naam kaa upyog karte hue, desktop pentium dul-kor kor microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he, jise apane vishesh lakshan kii pentium d se tulana karne ke samay spasht rup se dekha ja saktaa he, jo sarvapratham pentium 4 main vyavhaar kiye gaye net barst microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he
 Shared L2-cache of 2 or 4 megabytes supported Core 2 Duo, the desktop Pentium dual-core has a shared L2 cache of 1 or 2 megabytes
 iske vipareet, pentium d processron main yaa to 2 yaa 4 mabibite kaa gaiyr saajha L2 cash hota he
 Additionally, the fastest speed clock Pentium d has a factory limit of 3
73 ghz, while the fastest speed clock desktop Pentium dual-core reaches 3
2 ghz
 in processron ke bich ek pramukh antar yah he ki desktop pentium dul-kor processron main keval 65 wat kaa thermal dizin power hota he jabaki pentium d main yah 95 se 130 wat ke bich hota he

 Hastings resigned in December and left Britain for 1764 the following month
 He left, deeply saddened by the more liberal strategy of failure that he had supported, but which was rejected by the flamboyant members of the Calcutta Council

 The severity of this sexual molestation, which is seen as a problem of delinquency in youth, ranges from tightening lustful cogent remarks, touching in public places, to whistling, to explicitly joking
 kabhi-kabhi ise nirdosh maze ke vineet sanket ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, jisase yah ahaanikar prathit hota he jiskaa apradhi par koi parinami daayitv nahin banataa he
 Many feminists and voluntary organizations have suggested that this expression be replaced by a more appropriate term
 According to him, considering the semantic origin of the word eve-teasing in the Indian English language, it indicates the seductive nature of the woman, where the obligation of seduction rests on the woman, as if the manipulative response of men is natural rather than guilt-ridden
 mahilaon ke saath chhedchhad aisa aparaadh he jise pramanit karnaa behad mushkil he, chunki apradhi aksar mahilaon par hamale ke saral tareeqe dhundh lete hai, haalanki kai nariwadi lekhakon ne ise "chote balaatkaar" kaa naam diya he, or saamanytah yah saarvajanik sthalon, sadakon or saarvajanik vaahanon main ghatit hota he
 In connection with this, some guidebooks suggest that female tourists can be avoided by wearing conservative clothes, although both Indian women and foreign women wearing conservative clothes have reported reports of molestation
 haalanki 1960 ke dashak main is samasya ne janata or media kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya, aagaamee dashakon main, jab adhik mahilaon ne college janaa or swatantra rup se kaam karnaa shuru kiya, yani jab paaramparik samaaj main purushon ne unke margrakshak ke rup main saath janaa band kiya, yah samasya chintajanak str tak bad gai
 Soon the Government of India had to implement reform measures both judicial and law enforcement to curb this risk and efforts were made to sensitize the police to the problem and the police began to surround the molesters

 In addition, during this period, the changing attitude of the public towards those who molest women, the number of women coming forward to report incidents of molestation such as sexual harassment cases was visible
 At the same time, the severity of molestation incidents also increased, in some cases such as acid throwing incidents, which resulted in states like Tamil Nadu declaring molestation of women a non-bailable offense
 mahila sanghathanon kii sankhya or mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye kaam karne waalon kii sankhya main bhi vruddhi hui, visheshkar is avadhi main dulhan jalaane kii reporton main badhotaree dekhi gai
 The rise in violent incidents towards women has meant the abandonment of an earlier disinterested attitude towards women's rights by law makers
 aagaamee varshon main aise sanghathanon ne, 'dilli mahilaon ke saath chhedchhad nishedh vidheyak 1984' sahit mahilaon ko hinsak chhedhkhaniyon se bachaane ke liye pariklpit kaanoon ko paarit karne ke liye samarthan jutaney main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 The death of Sarika Shah, a Chennai student, as a result of molestation of women in 1998, brought to light the stringent laws to deal with the problem in South India
 Following the case, there were reports of nearly half a dozen suicides, for which women The pressure created due to tampering with the IS was held liable

 Many cases of fear of retaliation and slander in society are not reported
 kuch maamalon main police, aparaadhiyon ko saarvajanik apmaan ke baad murgha sazaa dekar chhod dete hai
 In 2008, a Delhi court ordered a 19-year-old youth caught flirting with the woman, detailing the consequences of her indecent conduct, and distributing 500 pamphlets to youth outside schools and colleges
 paramparaagat rup se, bhartiya cinema ne aam naach-gane ke saath, prem prasang kii shuruuaat ke taur par mahilaon ke saath chhedhkhaniyon ko darshaya, jo hameshaa gane ke ant tak nayak ke prati nayak ke samarpan se khatm hota he
 And the young men are seen imitating this unmistakable specimen displayed on screen, giving rise to street lovers whose film version can be seen at Roadside Romeo
 iskaa ek or darshaya jane vaala lokapriy nazaaraa he ki jab mahilaon ke saath chhedhkhani karne vaale yuvak kisi ladki ko chhedate hai, to nayak vahaan pahunchataa he or unki pitayee karata he, jaisaa ki telugu filmein "madhumasam" or "magadhira" or hindi film "vanted" main dekh sakate hai
 Nowadays this problem is also being shown in Indian television serials
 haalanki bhartiya kaanoon main 'eve-tizing' shabd kaa prayog nahin hua he, peediton dwaara aam taur par bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 294 or kaa aashray liya jaataa he, jo yuvati yaa mahila ke prati ashleel ishaaron, tippaniyon, gane yaa kavita-paath karne ke aparaadh main doshi paae gaye vyakti ko adhiktam teen maheenon kii sazaa detii he

 On repeat of the offense, when certified, the offender shall be charged Rs
 5000 including imprisonment for five years

 Under the Indian Penal Code section, a woman or a woman who makes obscene acts, indecent gestures or making lewd remarks against a woman can be punished with imprisonment for one year or with fine or both
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 354-A, dhara 354-D main mahila ke prati ashleel ishaaron, ashleel tippaniyon, pichaa karne par kathor karawas kii sazaa yaa jurmaana yaa donon lagaae ja sakate hai
 The 'national Commission for Women' has also proposed 1988 molestation of number 9 women
 'nidar karnataka' yaa 'nirbhay karnataka', kai vyaktiyon or 'vaikalpik kanoonee manch', 'blank noiz' 'mara', 'sanvada' or 'vimochana' jaise samoohon kaa gathbandhan he
 Following the rise in incidents of molestation of women in the 2000s, she launched several awareness campaigns among the public, including 'take Back the Night' and a 2003 public art project in Bangalore titled The Blank Noise Project
 a similar program against women molesters was held in 2008 in Mumbai

 is parivaar main vriksharohi gilahariyaan, bhu gilahariyaan, chimpunk, marmot, udan gilahari or preiri shwaan bhi shaamil hai
 It is native to America, Eurasia and Africa and has been brought from elsewhere in Australia

 The word Skuril was first attested in 1327, it is derived from the anglo-norman word Escuirel, which was derived from the ancient French word Escuelrale and which also has a glimpse of the Latin word Skiurus, from the Greek word

 Squirrels are usually small animals, ranging in size from 7–10 cm in length and weighing only 10 grams to alpine marmots of African small squirrels, 53–73 cm in length and 5 to 8 cm in length
 Agram is from aamtaur par gilahariyon kaa sharir charhara, poonch baalo se yukt or ankhen badi hoti hai

 Their teeth are in accordance with the original rodent texture, with large teeth to munch on that continue to develop throughout life, and have some gap at the back, or a chunk of teeth, to grind the food properly

 Squirrels breed once or twice a year and give birth to several babies after 3 to 6 weeks, depending on their species, how many babies they will give birth to
 uske paidaa kiye bachche nange, dantarahit, asahaay va andhe hote hai
 In almost all species, only females care for babies, which are weaned when they are 6 or 10 weeks old, and become sexually mature by the end of the first year
 bhoomi par rahane vaali prajatiyaan aam taur par saamaajik hoti hai, jo praayah suviksit sthanon par rahati hai, kintu vrikshon par rahane vaali prajatiyaan ekanki hoti hai
 All land and tree squirrels are uniquely diurnal, except for newborns of flying squirrels and flying squirrels that feed their babies and who were living as dinners during summer
 Squirrels are nocturnal
 khargosh v hiran ki tarah, gilahariyaan saillulose ko pachaa nahin paati or unhen protein, carbohidrate v vasa ke aadhiky vaale bhojan par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 In temperate regions, early summer is most difficult for squirrels because the seedlings of the sesame seedlings grow at that time and are not available for the squirrels to eat, apart from this there is no other source of food available at this time
 is dauraan gilahari mukhya rup se pedo kii kaliyon par nirbhar rahati hai
 The diet of squirrels consists mainly of many types of plant food, including almonds, seeds, cones, fruits, fungi and green vegetables

 gilahariyaan keede, andey, choti chidiya, yuva saanpon v chote krintakon ko khaane ke liye bhi jaani jaati hai
 In fact, some polar species depend entirely on the diet of insects

 The living squirrels found at this time are divided into 5 sub-families, which consists of about 50 classes and 280 species
 gilahari kaa sarvaadhik purna jeevashm, hesperopits, chadronian ke samay kaa he or aadhunik udan gilahariyon ke saamaan he
 During the latest Eocene to Myocene, there were many squirrels that cannot be placed under the lineage of any living species today
 At least some of these, possibly the oldest, basel, were a type of "proto-squirrels"
 This type of ancient ancestral distribution and variation indicates that squirrels as a group originated from North America
 kabhi-kabhi milane vaale in alpagyaat jeevashmon ke atirikt, jivit gilahariyon kaa jativrutt atyant spasht v saral he
 They have three major lineages, one of which includes the Ratufinae
 isamen vah kuch gilahariyaan bhi shaamil hai, jo ushnkaribandheey asia main pai jaati hai
 The newly incubated small squirrel of tropical South America is the only surviving member of the Sciurilliane family
 tritiy vansh ab tak kaa sabase vishaal vansh he or anya sabhi up pariwaron ko sammilit karata he;iskaa vitaran lagbhag bahudeshiy he
 This supports the hypothesis that the common ancestors of squirrels found through all living and fossils lived in North America, since the same lineage appears to have originated — if, for example, assume that the birth of the squirrels If they were from Eurasia, the clues of their ancient lineages should be found from Africa, but looking at the African squirrels it seems that their The origin is quite modern
 gilahariyon ke mukhya samooh ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara anya up parivaar praapt honge
 The Schiurinae family includes flying squirrels and schiurini, which among others include American tree squirrels; The Sciurini were often seen as a separate family, but they are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae
 duusari ore tad gilahariyon ko saamaanya taur par pramukh bhu gilahariyon ke vansh main sammilit kiya jaataa he, lekin dikhne main vah udan gilahariyon ke saamaan hi bhinn hoti hai; isliye kabhi kabhi unhen bhi ek alag janajati, temiaskiurini ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 Whatever the case, the trifurcation of the main squirrel lineage is very convenient in biophysical and ecological terms, with two of the three subfamilies being roughly the same size, each containing around 70–80 species; The third family is twice the other two families
 skiurine ke antargat vrikshiya gilahariyaan aati hai, jo ki america or kuch seemaa tak uresia se hai
 In tropical Asia on the other hand, Kelosquirinae is the most diverse and includes axillary squirrels, but their formation is quite different and they look more "beautiful", which is probably due to the effect of their extremely colorful rows

 Lyricist - Anand Bakshi 35wein filmphere puraskaar The three-tier law is an idea developed by Agasta Komat that says that what every science, the whole society, develops through three stages
 is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan unhone 1822 main prakashit apni kriti 'sakaaratmak darshan kaa paathyakram' main kiya he
 These are the three stages mentioned by him- prakruti hamaara genetical, arthath anuvanshik code keval chaar aksharon vaali varnmaala main likhti he
 These four letters are AGCT in English
 All four are symbols of chemical bases-- keval chaar akshar yaa chaar kshar hote hue bhi is code ko padhanaa na keval aasaan nahin he, usamen samay bhi bahut lagata he, haalanki ab aisi mashine bhi uplabdh hai, jo batan dabaate hi di en e sutron ke rup main likhi anuvanshik saamagree pard sakati hai
 However, these machines also have to do innumerable calculations involving biochemical operations, which take many hours
 isse chhutkaaraa paane ke liye germany main dortmund ke ek shodhak ne jaivaracinic kriyaaon kii gananaa ke bina hi, yani anuvanshik code ko sidhe hi pard lene kaa upaay found nikaala he
 The method so far is that machines called sequential robots divide genetic material, that is, DNA, into small pieces broken down by enzymes

 a doctorate in chemistry, Folker Deckert of Dortmund considers it too complex and wants the genetic code to be as simple to read as the value of an item with the help of a scanner at the cash counter of a super market
 Reading bar code

 It is almost dark in the laboratory and no external sounds can come: yah ek vishesh prayogshaala he
 An attempt has been made to keep external sounds and vibrations to a minimum, so that external interruptions have no effect as much as possible
 We finally want to read every DNA correctly
 ghumaavdaar sidhiyon jaisaa dikhaayi padane vaale di en e kaa har doharaa sutara maanviya bal se bhi 10 hazaar guna maheen hota he
 If you want to read the code hidden in it directly, then a very powerful lens is needed: samaj lijiye ki sara scinar hi aisa he
 Its most important part is the microscope
 This is an inverse microscope - you look at the sample from below

 a microscope or microscope is the same as a good microscope available in the market
 lekin, prayogshaala main use jis mez par rakhaa gaya he, vah bahari companon ko dabaa dene vaali ek vishesh mez he
 As a sample, the RNA formulas are floating on transparent glass plates with a few drops of a liquid solution
 aar en e vastav main di en e ke hi samdarshi hai
 The main difference is that if DNA resembles a double, ie a curved staircase with two parallel legs, then the rnas are similar to a single one, ie a spiral staircase with one leg

 yadi ham chahen, to random power microscope namoonay ke ek-ek parmaanu ko scan kar saktaa he
 But we do not have to go to this limit
 Through this fine needle-like tangent, which we have made ourselves, the amount of light can be increased
 prakaash ko badhaayaa hi nahin, kisi khaas bindu par sankendrit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 That's why we can see many nuances far better here than in any normal microscope

 In this scanning technique based on Raman spectroscopy, the laser light is shed on the test specimen through the lens of a normal microscope

 Through their reflected laser rays, it is immediately known which molecules with the genetic code are shivering right now: ungali ke nishaan kii tarah har anu kii apni ek theth pahchaan he
 This is what we take advantage of

 With the help of these pulses, we can identify which molecule belongs to adenine or which cytosine or which one belongs to it

 This is all trick

 Pushing and playing each alkaline brick of the RNA formula one by one can prove to be very complicated, so Folker Deckert measures the vibrations of many molecules simultaneously

 In this way there is no need to divide the RNA or DNA into pieces and make thousands of copies of them, as it is nowadays
 apane pratham maapnon ke aadhaar par hamane jo anubhav paye hai, unase pataa chalata he ki anuvanshik code vaale kshaaron ke spectrum, arthath varnakram bahut milte-julate hai
 In other words, we can say with great confidence that we can differentiate between every base, every base
 folkar dekirt kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kisi ke anuvanshik code ko padhane ke liye ekasutri aar en e ke badale dosutri di en e kaa upyog karne main bhi siddhanthata koi samasya nahin he
 He estimates that in five to six years, the first such model of his genetic code reader will be ready, which can be launched in the market
 tab, di en e vishleshan ke aadhaar par kisi apradhi ko pakadaney or sazaa dilaane, kisi bachche ke asli pita kii yaa kisi agyaat mritak kii sahi-sahi pahchaan karne main or bhi aasaani ho jaayegi, is sab main lagane vaala samay bhi bahut kam ho jaayegaa

 In these bridges the length of the spans is very important
 If the length of the spans is high then its strength will be low

 The cantilever bridge is made using the cantilever
 These bridges are connected by a beam of cantilever on one side and the back end is of a support
 The inside of the bridge is also built like a beam bridge but the direction of the force on the bridge is different
 And long spans are used inside Ein Setuo

 These bridges are made with the use of stones, the construction of Anko was made by Suruach Greco with a 210-meter span Solkan bridge, which is in Solkan, Solvenia, above the Soka River, is the world's second largest stone bridge arch bridge
 The bridge was completed in only 18 days and the bridge was completed in only 18 days

 The only difference between the two bridges is that the Solanc bridge is the only bridge built in the same way, and apart from the stone, the cement is also used in the Fardenbrush bridge

 The period of colonialism was often in the history from the fifteenth century to the twentieth century
 is kaal main europe ke logon ne vishwa ke vibhinn bhaagon main upnivesh banaaye
 The main reasons for the belief in colonialism during this period were - kuch upniveshi yah bhi sochate the ki sthaneey logon ko isaai banaakar tathaa unhen "sabhyataa" kaa darshan karakar ve unki sahaayta kar rahe hai
 But in reality, colonialism meant - hegemony, displacement and death

 In this way, European countries moved towards the establishment of colonies in order to serve their business interests and propagate, and thus colonization began in Europe
 upniveshwaad kaa arth he - kisi samrudh evam shaktishaalee raashtra dwaara apane vibhinn hiton ko saadhane ke liye kisi nirbal kintu prakritik sansadhano se paripurna raashtra ke vibhinn sansadhano kaa shakti ke bal par upbhog karnaa
 In colonialism, the people of the colonies are ruled by a foreign nation, they have no political authority in governance
 arganski ke anusaar, In fact, we can call colonialism the exploitation of a weak nation by vested interests by a powerful nation
 latin bhashaa ke shabd 'colonia' kaa matlab he ek aisi jaaydaad jise yojanabaddh dhang se videshiyon ke bich kaayam kiya gaya ho
 Such colonization was a common phenomenon in the Mediterranean region and medieval Europe
 iskaa udhaaharan madhyayug or aadhunik yug kii shuruaati avadhi main england kii hukumat dwaara wales or ireland ko upnivesh banane ke rup main diya jaataa he
 However, the modern colonialism that is being discussed here means the non-western cultures and nations by the European and American forces forcibly taking over the reigns, administration, environment, ecology, language, religion, system and life- The long-term process of imposing its heterogeneous values and structures on style
 is tarah ke upniveshwaad kaa ek strot columbus or vascodigama kii yatraaon ko bhi mana jaataa he
 Historians of colonialism have identified the development of the phenomenon of imperial expansion by the fifteenth century European powers as colonialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 audyogic kranti se paidaa hue halaat ne upniveshvaadi dohan ko apane charam par pahunchaaya

 The same kind of basic tendencies are inherent in colonizing another land and starving individualism
 naslwad, eurokendriyata or videshi-dwesh jaisi vikrutiyaan upniveshwaad kii hi dein hai
 Colonialism notwithstanding imperialism, there are quite a few mutually and interdependent positions
 samrajyavad ke liye zaruri nahin he ki kisi desh par kabza kiya jaae or vahaan kabza karne vaale apane logon ko bhej kar apana prashasan kaayam karen
 Without it, relations of subordination to the imperialist center can be maintained
 par, upniveshwaad ke liye zaruri he ki vijit desh main apni colony basaai jaae, aakraamak kii vijiton bahusankhya pratyaksh ke zariye khud ko shreshth maanate hue apane kanoon or faisale aropit karen
 In order to do this, imperialist expansion was required to achieve the logic of a particular ideology
 yah bhoomika satrahavin sadi main pratipaadit jon lock ke darshan ne nibhaai
 Locke's arguments contained arguments to justify the actions taken by Britain's occupiers to occupy American soil
 unki rachana 'tu treetaise on civil government' kii duusari thisis ‘prakrut avasthaa’ main vyakti dwaara apane adhikaron kii daavedaari ke bare main he
 They justify establishing civil rule in such places and developing the property acquired for personal gain through personal efforts
 yahi thisis aage chal kar dharti ke asmaan swaamitv ko uchit maanane kaa aadhaar bani
 Locke was of the opinion that the land in America is lying idle and the native people there are deprived of the ability to make good use of this earth
 lock ne hisaab lagaaya ki europe kii ek acre zamin agar apane swami ko paanch shilling prati varsh kaa munaafaa detii he, to uske mukaable america kii zamin se us par based indian ko hone vaala kul munaafaa ek penny se bhi bahut kam he
 Since American Indians have failed to adopt the wealth-based exchange system prevalent in the rest of humanity, human rights must be acquired and invested in their land according to the 'right to property'
 lock kii isi thisis main asian or america mahadweep kii sabhyataa or samskruti par europee shreshthata kii granthi ke beej the jiske aadhaar par aage chal kar upniveshvaadi sanrachanaon kaa shiraja khadaa kiya gaya
 The colonies were mainly of two varieties
 ek taraf america, austrailia or newjiland jaise the jinaki jalwaayu europiyanon ke liye suvidhajanak thi
 In these areas, white skin people were settled on a large scale

 He saved the indigenous people from the massacre and pushed them into isolated areas
 duusari taraf ve upnivesh the jinka hawa-pani europiyanon ke liye pratikul tha 
 After occupying these countries, Europeans settled in small numbers and mainly used those weapons for economic exploitation and exploitation

 Geographical discoveries played an important role in the business revolution
 in bhugolic khojon ke saath hi upniveshwaad kaa aarambh hua
 European countries like Spain, Portugal, Dutch, France and England established colonies in remote countries
 europe main upniveshwaad ke aarambh ke nimnlikhit kaaran the - The discovery of America by Columbus as a result of geographical discoveries triggered competition for the collection of precious metals such as gold in European countries
 swarna-sangrah kii pratisparddha kii sthiti yah thi ki samast europe main ‘adhik swarna, adhik samruddhi, adhik kirti’ kaa naaraa buland hua
 Now the main focus of all European nations was on gold, fame and God i
e
 Gold, Glory and God
 upniveshon kii sthapana se europea deshon ko sona bhi mila, kirti bhi faili evam dharm kaa prachaar bhi hua
 Hence the Triple g policy was undoubtedly a reason for the establishment of colonies
 vyapaarik samruddhi ke falswaroop europea deshon main kai udyogon kii sthapana hui
 Europe lacked the raw materials required for these industries
 atah europea deshon ne kachche maal kii prapti hetu prakritik sansadhano evam africa evam asin deshon main upniveshon kii sthapana kii
 Due to the establishment of industries and availability of raw materials, industrial production grew at a rapid pace
 chunki is samay sabhi europea desh aarthik sangrakshan kii niti par chal rahe the
 Therefore, colonies were also established to conserve this manufactured goods
 arthath prayek upniveshon ko shaktishaalee rashtron dwaara jabaran nirmit maal kii kharid v kachche maal ke niryaat hetu baadhya kiya gaya
 Industrialization in various countries of Europe resulted in a large increase in the population of cities
 kalantar main atishesh jansankhya ko basaane ke liye bhi upniveshon kii sthapana ko bal mila
 The Europeans gained knowledge of many new things as a result of business progress and contact with new countries, they came to know about potato, tobacco, corn etc
 through contact with eastern countries
 garm masaale, chini, coffee, chaaval aadi ke bhi ab ve aadi ho gayi the
 Due to adverse climate it was not possible to grow all these things in European countries
 atah europea visheshgy angrej chaahate the ki unhen aise pradesh praapt ho jaayen jahaan inaki kheti kii ja sake
 Therefore, the ideology of colonization in places with favorable climate got a boost
 bhugolic khojon ke parinamswaroop praarambhik upnivesh portugal evam spain ne sthapit kiye
 This increased their prosperity
 atah inaki samruddhi ko dekhte hue samruddhi kii laalasaa main anya europea desh bhi upnivesh sthapit karte hue agrasar hue
 Marxist interpretations of colonialism also claim that direct political control of non-capitalist societies was necessary for the development of nineteenth-century American and European industrial capitalist economies
 is lihaaz se marxvaadi vidwaan poonjeewaad ke ubhaar ke pehle or baad ke upniveshwaad ke bich fark karte hai
 Marx has specifically considered colonialism in his Indian compositions
 marks or angels kaa vichaar tha ki upniveshon par niyantran karnaa na keval bazaaron or kachche maal ke sroton ko hathiyaane ke liye zaruri tha, balki pratidwandvi audyogic deshon se hode main aage nikalne ke liye bhi aavashyak tha
 The credit for further developing Marxist ideas of colonialism goes to Rosa Luxembourg and Lenin
 marxvaadi pariprekshya ko aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 Critics say that the evidence that Marx, Rosa, and Lenin offered in favor of their thesis are not sufficient, because they do not prove the inevitability of colonialism for the development of industrial revolution and capitalism
 duusare, marxvaadi vishleshan ke paas upniveshit samaajon kaa paryaapt adhyayan or samaj maujuud nahin he
 The Asian production system that Marx discusses and the categories of Rosa that Asian societies impose cannot be drawn too far on the basis of an in-depth study of the history of these societies
