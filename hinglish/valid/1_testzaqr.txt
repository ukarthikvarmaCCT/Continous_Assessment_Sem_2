 They consider them to be divine knowledge and accept as free and final proof that the Indian Aryans of the Vedas made their goal of harmonious development of these powers
 This paper is a reflection of Indian culture and civilization in the lights of holy Vedas
 The author in this paper considers the Holy Vedas as the origin of enriched and spiritual civilization of India
 The Vedas are a large body of texts originating in ancient India
 Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of India
 The Vedas are apauruṣeya 
they are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called śruti, distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smṛti 
 The Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotar, or presiding priest; The Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest; The Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgatar or priest that chants; The Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apostrophic charms and speculative hymns
 The research paper presented presents equanimity and contrast between Nirgun Prem Margi Sufi Saint Poets, Jnana Marg Mari Sufi Poetry Section and Nirgun Prem Margi Sufi Saint Poetry Stream

 yah mitra jeev / prakritik shatru hanikaarak keedon ko nasht karte rahete hai or unki sankhya ko aarthik haani str se neeche rakhane main hamaari sahaayta karte hai
 We often spray chemical insecticides only if other insects are not able to identify friendly insects and enemy insects, or in the absence of an expected invasion of enemy insects or the ratio of enemy insects and friendly insects

 sangrakshan ke liye nimna baton kaa dhyaan rakhen:- An ethnic group is a group of humans whose members consider themselves descendants of a race through a common or imaginary common ancestry
 yah sanjhi viraasat vanshakram, itihaas, rakt-sambandh, dharm, bhashaa, saanjhe kshetra, rashtriyata yaa bhautik rup-rang par aadhaarit ho sakati he
 Members of an ethnic group are aware of their belonging to one ethnic group; Apart from this, ethnic identity is also marked by others being identified as the uniqueness of that group

 The processes that lead to the emergence of this type of identification are called genealogies
 ek jaateey samooh ke sadsy, samgr rup se, samay ke saath saanskrithik nirantarata kaa daawa karte hai
 However, historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that often many values, practices, and rules, which involve continuity with the past, are relatively recent inventions
 thomas hillland arikson ke anusaar, jaateeyata ke adhyayan par abhi tak do bhinn tark haaavee the
 One is between "primitiveism" and "karanism"
 aadimavaadi drushti main, sahabhaagi, jaateey sambandhon ko sanyukt rup main, bahya rup se pradutt, jo aakraamak bhi ho saktaa he, ek saamaajik bandhan ke rup main grahan karata he
 On the other hand, according to the Karanist view, ethnicity is primarily an ad hoc element of a political strategy, which is used as a resource for interest groups to achieve second-rate goals such as increased wealth, power, or rank

 The second debate is between "constructivism" and "elementalism"
 rachnawadi rashtriya or jaateey pahachaanon ko aksar haalia aitihaasik balon ke rup main dekhte hai, tab bhi jab pahachaanon ko puraatan ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he
 Elementalists see such introductions as power categories defining social actors, rather than the result of social action

 This is in the context of debates based on multiculturalism spread in countries such as the United States and Canada, with many immigrant populations largely from different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia

 The term "ethnic" and its related forms were used in English between the 14th century and the 19th century as the meaning of "pegan / heathen"

 18–24 main uddhrut) Modern uses of "ethnic" grouping, however, reflect industrial states with a variety of encounters with subordinate groups, such as immigration and colonizing subjects; "ethnic groups" stood out as opposed to "nations" for the purpose of referring to people who have distinct cultural identities and who, through migration or conquest, have become subservient to a foreign state
 is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog apekshaakrit nayaa he-1851 - 1935 main pehali baar jaateey samooh shabd kaa upyog kiya gaya or 1972 main oxford english dictionari main iskaa pravesh hua
 The modern usage definition of the Oxford English Dictionary is as follows: a n great britain or sanyukt rajya america kii saadhaaran bhashaa main angreji shabd "ethnic" ke upyog ke vishay main likhte hue, waleman yah tippanee karte hai ki Thus in present day colloquialism, there is still a circle of foreign people, minority issues and ethnic relations around the words "ethnic" and "ethnicity"
 haalanki, saamaajik vigyaan ke daayre main, iskaa upyog samanyikrut rup se un sabhi maanav samoohon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo spashtatya swayan ko saanskrithik rup se vishisht maanate hai or dusron dwaara bhi maane jate hai
 German sociologist Max Weber is also among the first to introduce the term "ethnic group" to the social sciences, defining it as: maanav samooh jo apane samaan udbhav kii aatmanishth dharna ko ek jaisi shaareerik banaavat yaa rivaajon yaa donon ke kaaran yaa upniveshan or pravaas kii yaadon ke kaaran maanate he; yah dharna samooh gathan ke liye mahatvapurn honi chahie; iske alaava isse koi fark nahin padataa ki ek vishayashrith rakt-sambandh maujuud he yaa nahin
 Weber states that the ethnic groups were Kynstlish, because they were based on subjective belief in a shared gemineshaft
 duusare, saajha gamineshaft main is vishwaas ne samooh kaa nirmaan nahin kiya, apitu samooh ne vishwaas ko banaaya
 Third, group formation was the result of a race to monopolize power and status
 yah us samay kii prachlit prakrutivaadee dharna ke vipareet tha, jiske anusaar samaaj-saanskrithik or logon kii vyavhaarik bhinnataayen, vanshaagat lakshanon or sarvanishtha vanshon se vyutpann pravritiyon se utpann hoti hai, jise us samay "res" kehete the
 Another influential theorist of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose 1969 "ethnic Groups and Boundaries" have been described as instrumental in the spread of the use of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s
 barth, jaateeyata kii prakruti ke nirmaan par bal dene main webar se bhi aage nikal gaye
 For Barth, ethnicity was the only constant negotiation and reawakening by both external attribution and internal self-identification
 barth kii raay main jaateey samooh kram vichchhedi saanskrithik ekaaki yaa taarkik e prioris nahin hai, jisase log swaabhaavik rup se sambandhit hote hai
 They wanted to do away with anthropological assumptions that held culture's bound element and ethnicity as primitive bonds and replaced it with a focus on the segregation between groups
 isliye, jaateey pahchaan kii aapasi sambhddhata par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hi "jaateey samooh or simaaen" he
 Barth writes: "decisive ethnic distinctions do not depend on mobility, contact, and lack of information, but include social processes of exclusion and inclusion that retain discrete categories, despite changes in their participation and membership during individual life histories
 goes
 " In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of "ethnic groups" in the use of "social scientists", often more than the native reality, reflected the wrong label: 


 namit jaateey pahchaan jise ham aksar bina soche samajhe, sahitya main die gaye aadhaaron par apana lete hai, aksar manamaane dhang se, yaa usase bhi badtar dhang se adhiropit kiye gaye he
 In this way, he pointed to the fact that an ethnic group's identity, if identified by outsiders such as anthropologists, may differ from the self-identification of that group
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki upyog ke pehle ke dashakon main, jaateeyata shabd kaa prayog aksar saajha saanskrithik pranaaliyon or saajha viraasat vaale chote samoohon ke sandarbh main "saanskrithik" yaa "janajaatiy" jaise puraane shabdon ke sthaan par prayog kiye jate hai, parantu us "jaateeyata" main donon hi janajaatiy or aadhunik samaajon main samoohon kii pahchaan pranaaliyon main samaantaaon ko varnit karne main sakasham hone kii atirikt khubi thi
 Cohen also suggested that claims of "caste" identity are often colonialist practices and an influence of relations between colonized peoples and nation-states
 saamaajik vaigyanikon ne isliye is baat par dhyaan kendrit kiya ki kaise, kab or kyon jaateey pahchaan ke vibhinn suchak khaas ban jate hai
 Therefore, anthropologist Joan Vincent noted that ethnic boundaries are often of unstable character
 ronaald kohen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki jaateeyata "antarveshan or ekantik kii ek nirmaanadhin dvibhaajaneekaran shrinkhalaa he"
 ve joan vincent ke avlokan se sahamat hai ki "jaateeyata 


 ko seemaa ke sandarbh main, raajnneetik jutav ke vishisht aavashyaktaaon ke sambandh main, sankuchit yaa vistrut kiya ja saktaa he
 This may be the reason why dynasty is sometimes an indicator of ethnicity and sometimes is not: which trait of ethnicity is predominant and depends on whether people are promoting ethnic boundaries up or down and They amplify them above or below it generally depends on the political situation
 jaateey vargeekaran ko dusron dwaara labling yaa aatm-pahchaan dwaara paribhaashit kiye jane kii samasya se bachane ke liye, yah upaay sujhaayaa gaya ki in avadharanaon jaise "jaateey shreniyan", "jaateey networkon" or "jaateey samudaayon" yaa "prajati" ko ek duusare se alag kiya jaae
 Many different approaches have been used by various social scientists to understand ethnicity, when they tried to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society
 is tarah ke tareekon ke udhaaharan hai: aadimavad, tathvikwaad, sthayitvvaad, rachnawad, aadhunikwaad or karnavaad
 Prior to Weber, race and ethnicity were often seen as two aspects of the same thing
 1900 ke aas-paas or usase pehle jaateeyata kii tathvik aadimavaadi samaj pradhan thi, logon ke bich saanskrithik bhinnata ko viraasat main mili lakshanon or pravritiyon ke parinaam ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 At the same time "sciences" such as enlightenment claimed that they were able to correlate cultural and behavioral properties between different populations by their external physical structure, such as the shape of the skull
 webar dwaara jaateeyata ko ek saamaajik nirmaan ke rup main parichay die jane par, nasl or jaateeyata ek duusare se vibhajit kiye gaye
 According to biology a social belief rested on well-defined races
 1950 main unesco kaa bayaan "da res queschan" main, jo us samay ke kuch antarrashtriya str par khyaati praapt buddhijiviyon, dwaara hastakshrit kiya gaya, sujhaayaa gaya: "yah jaruri nahin he ki rashtriya, dharmik, bhugolic, bhashaai or saanskrithik samooh nasleey samoohon ke saath mail khaae: or is tarah ke samoohon kii saanskrithik visheshtaon kaa nasleey gunon ke saath koi pradarshit anuvanshik lakshan sambandh nahin he
 Because habitually serious errors in the use of the word "race" in general lore, it is better to talk about 'ethnic groups' than the word "race" when referring to human race
 " In 1982, American cultural anthropologists, collecting forty years of ethnographic research, argue that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic indicators of the ways in which people from different parts of the world have joined the global economy: woolf ke anusaar, europea vyapaarik vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan naslon kaa or poonjivadi vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan jaateey samoohon kaa, nirmaan or samavisht kiya gaya
 Ethnicity often indicates shared cultural, linguistic, behavioral, or religious traits
 udhaaharan ke liye, khud ko yahudee yaa arab kahalaane ke liye turant bhashaai, dharmik, saanskrithik or nasleey gunon ke put ko utpann karnaa hoga jise prayek jaateey shrenee main samaan mana jaataa he
 Such broad ethnic categories have also been termed as ethnicity
 yah unhen choti, adhik vyaktiparak jaateey gunon se pruthak karata he, jise aksar sookshmjatiyata kaha jaataa he
 In some cases, particularly those involving international migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is associated with nationality
 maanavvigyaani or itihaaskaar, jo arnest gelnar or benedict anderson dwaara prastaavit jaateeyata ke aadhuniktaavaadi samaj kaa paalan karte hai, ve raashtra or rashtrawaad ko satrahavin sadi main aadhunik rajya pranali ke saath viksit hote hue dekhte hai
 He ended with the emergence of "nation-states" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation converge with state boundaries
 is prakaar, pashchim main, jaateeyata kii dharna, nasl or raashtra kii tarah, europea upniveshik vistaar ke sandarbh main viksit hone lagi, jab vanikwaad or poonjeevaad jansankhya ke vaishvik andolanon ko badhaava de rahaa tha or saath hi saath rajya simaaen adhik spasht or sakhti se paribhaashit kii ja rahi thim
 In the nineteenth century, modern states commonly sought legitimacy through claims to represent "nations"
 haalanki, raashtra-rajya, nishchit taur par us aabaadi ko shaamil karata he jo kisi ek yaa anya kaarnon se rashtriya jivan se apvarjit kar die gaye hai
 Consequently, members of excluded groups will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or self-government, sometimes to the extent of complete political isolation in their own nation-state
 in paristhitiyon main - jab log ek rajya se duusare rajya main sthanantarit hote hai, yaa ek rajya par vijay praapt karte hai yaa apni rashtriya seemaa ke pare logon ke upnivesh banaate hai - jaateey samooh aise logon dwaara banaai gai, jinaki pahchaan ek raashtra ke saath he, parantu ve rahete duusare rajya main hai
 Sometimes ethnic groups become subject to hostile attitudes and actions by the country or its constituents
 beesvin sadi main, log yah tark dene lage ki jaateey samoohon ke bich yaa ek jaateey samooh ke sadasyon or rajya ke bich sangharsh ko in do main se ek tareeke se suljhaayaa janaa chahie
 Some, such as Eugen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states should be based on the notion of political rights of the autonomous individual public

 Historically, its location deep in the brain suggested its special importance to philosophers
 This combination has shown a tendency to regard it as a "mystical" gland, connecting it to myth, superstition and senseless principles due to its sensory activities
 rene descartes ne, jinhone piniyal granthi ke adhyayan ke liye apana adhikansh samay samarpit kiya he, use "aatma kaa asana" kaha
 unka maananaa tha ki yah sharir or buddhi ke bich kaa sangam-sthal he
 There is a relevant quote related to the reason Descartes believed it to be, My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed
 The reason i believe this is that i cannot find any part of the brain, except this, which is not double
 Since we see only one thing with two eyes, and hear only one voice with two ears, and in short have never more than one thought at a time, it must necessarily be the case that the impressions which enter by the two eyes or by the two ears, and so on, unite with each other in some part of the body before being considered by the soul
 Now it is impossible to find any such place in the whole head except this gland; moreover it is situated in the most suitable possible place for this purpose, in the middle of all the concavities; and it is supported and surrounded by the little branches of the carotid arteries which bring the spirits into the brain
 Baruch de Spinoza later denied this: For he maintained, that the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain, namely, to that part called the pineal gland, by the aid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body, and also external objects, and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various ways 


 Such is the doctrine of this illustrious philosopher ; it is one which, had it been less ingenious, i could hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man
 Indeed, i am lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who had stoutly asserted, that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from self-evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which occult qualities are commonplace
 What does he understand, i ask, by the union of the mind and the body? The concept of the "pineal-eye" has been the focus of the philosophy of the French writer Georges Butel, which was elaborated by scholarly litterateur Dennis Hauler in his study Against Architecture

 aisi sari oshadhiyaan evam pranaliyaan jinase pidaa kaa nivaaran ho saktaa he, vednahar yaa pidaapaharak kehalaati hai
 Many drugs have the properties of analgesic as well as other properties
 lekin vaastavik pidaapaharak keval unheen aushadhiyon ko kehete hai jinase bina nidra athwa achetanta utpann kiye hi pidapharan ho sake, udaahranarth asitil salicylic amla
 There are some drugs that have the property of reducing the penetrating power of pain consciousness in the brain, or stopping the flow of pain in the nerves itself, for example, opium and coking
 kuch anya pidaapaharak aushadhiyaan pidaa ke kaarnon ko dur karke pidapharan main safal hoti hai, arthath jakadi hui mansapeshiyon ko dhilaa karke athwa sharir ke raktahin angon main raktapravaah badhaakar, jaise papavarin hai
 'padahapaharan' has been dubbed as Analgesia in English
 yah shabd algiesis se vyutpann he, jiskaa arth he vyathaa hona
 There is a lack of soreness or loss in suffering
 pidaa ke abhaav ke do kaaran ho sakate hai : pratham, jisamen pidaa kii chetana kaa pravaah naadiyon main kisi aushadhi yaa kisi anya kriya dwaara roak diya jaae or vah mastishk tak na pahunch sake tathaa dwitiya, jisamen mastishk swayan hi pidaa kaa kisi karanvash anubhav kar sake
 If pain is done in the pulse of only certain part of the body, then it is called spatial sensory
 par agar sara sharir aushadhi kaa kisi anya pranali se pidaarahit kar diya jaae, to ise sarvadaihik pidapharan kaha jaataa he
 There are many reasons for suffering
 in kaarnon ke do pramukh ang hai : pratham vah jisamen shareeravigyaan kaa or doosraa vah jisamen maanas vigyaan kaa aadhaar ho
 Therefore, the drugs and systems through which the body's physical actions, or mental state, are manipulated can be analgesic; That is, the change in mental and physical state leads to change in pain, and the effect of analgesic drugs
 bhinn-bhinn chetnaayen, jaise sparsh chetana, taap chetana or pidaa chetana sharir ke har bhaag se sushumna cond tak indriya-gyaan-vaahak naadiyon dwaara pahunchati hai
 Therefore, all the consciousnesses in these pulse diseases disappear
 parantu sushumna cond main pravesh ke baad in chetnaaon ko le janevaale gyanatantu sushumna cond main alag-alag ho jate hai
 Therefore, in some diseases, there is not the same effect on all the consciousnesses, such as tactile consciousness is present in the syringo myelia, but pain and agitation are required or lost

 Gopinath Sharma has written about a Bawdi inscription- "burda Inscription of Rupadevi of 1283 AD"
 "this inscription was found in a stepwell in Budhapadra village, from where it has been preserved by bringing it to the Durbar Hall of Jodhpur
 This 19-line text of Sanskrit verse is engraved on the stone
 Initially Krishna was praised

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar ve maharishi angira ke putr the
 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva
 unhone apane gyaan bal va mantra shaktiyon se devataaon kii raksha kii
 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva
 guuruuvaar, guru brihaspatidev kii upasna kaa vishesh din he
 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai
 Friday is the special day of worship of Venus
 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra
 bhartiya darshan ke 6 pramukh ang hai- sankhya darshan, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant
 According to Hindu scriptures, the demons of the deity religion are the symbol of unrighteousness
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki puranic manyataon main dev-daanvon ko ek hi pita, kintu alag-alag maataaon kii santan bataaya gaya he
 According to this, the father of the Devas and Demons is Rishi Kashyapa
 vahiin, devataaon kii mata kaa naam aditi or daanvon kii mata kaa naam diti he
 20 nations with maximum Hindu population in the world pracheen kaal main arya log vaidic mantron or agni-yajna se kai devataaon kii puja karte the
 The Aryans did not make any idols or temples of the gods
 pramukh arya devtaa the : devraj indra, agni, som or varun
 Vedic mantras were read for them and ghee, milk, curd, barley, etc
 were offered in the fire
 prajapati brahma, vishnu or shiv kaa us samay kam hi ullekh miltaa he
 India is a vast country, but we cannot know its greatness and greatness until we see it
 is ore vaise anek mahapurushon kaa dhyaan gaya, lekin aaj se baarah sau varsh pehle aadiguru shankaracharya ne iske liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 He established four benches at the ends of India in four directions, Jyotipitha near Badrinath in the north, Sringeri Peeth near Rameshwaram in the south, Govardhan Peeth in Jagannathpuri in the east and Dwarikapith in the west
 tirthon ke prati hamaare deshavaasiyon main badi bhakthi bhaavana he
 Therefore, by establishing these chairs Shankaracharya gave the countrymen a comfortable opportunity to visit the whole of India
 ye chaaron tirth chaar dham kehalaate he
 People believe that the person who travels to these four dhams gets blessed
 zyaadaatar hindu bhagwaan kii murtiyon dwaara puja karte hai
 For them, the idol is a simple instrument, in which the same formless God can be seen in any beautiful form as he wishes
 hindu log vastav main pathar or lohe kii puja nahin karte, jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai
 Idols are merely a means for Hindus to do devotion to God
 hinduon ke upasna sthalon ko mandir kehete hai
 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period
 tab upasna agni ke sthaan par hoti thi jisamen ek sone kii murti ishwar ke pratik ke rup main sthapit kii jaati thi
 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them
 har mandir main ek yaa adhik devataaon kii upasna hoti he
 The idol of the presiding deity is revered in the sanctum sanctorum
 mandir pracheen or madhyayugin bhartiya kala ke shreshthatam pratik hai
 Millions of pilgrims visit the temples every year
 adhikansh hindu chaar shankaraachaaryon ko hindu dharm ke sarvocch dharmaguru maanate hai

 unki spasht dharna thi ki devanagari lipi bharat hi nahin, sansar kii sarvaadhik vaigyanik lipi he
 If it is practiced for all the languages of India, then all Indians will come very close to each other
 hindustan kii ekta main devanagari lipi hindi se hi adhik upyogi ho sakati he
 Anant Shayanam Iyengar even accepted the possibility of Devanagari for the South Indian languages
 seth govinddas ise rashtriya lipi ghoshit karne ke paksh main the
 Many people think that having multiple languages is not a problem in India, while their scripts are a big problem
 gandhiji ne 1940 main gujarati bhashaa kii ek pustak ko devanagari lipi main chhapavaya or iskaa uddeshy bataaya tha ki meraa sapana he ki sanskrit se nikali har bhashaa kii lipi devanagari ho
 Similarly Vinoba Bhave thought that- buddha samskruti se prabhavit kshetra nagari ke liye nayaa nahin he
 China and Japan treat hieroglyphs
 in chitron kii sankhya bahut adhik hone ke kaaran bhashaa seekhney main bahut kathinaayee hoti he
 Being a vessel of Devvani, Devanagari can also go beyond India's borders and offer a suitable option for China and Japan
 bhartiya mul ke log sansar main jahaan-jahaan bhi rahete hai, ve devanagari se parichay rakhte hai, visheshkar marishas, surinam, fiji, gayana, trinidad, tubago aadi ke log
 In this way, the Devanagari script can not only bind all the provinces in India in love, but can also make 'bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay' and make different countries a more smooth and scientific One can claim the title of 'vishwa Nagari' in the twenty-first century by providing an alternative
 us par prasar lipigat samrajyavad or shoshan kaa madhyam na hokar satya, ahimsa, tyaag, sanyam jaise udaatt maanavmoolyon kaa samvahak hoga, asat se sat, tamas se jyoti tathaa mrityu se amarta kii disha main
 Devanagari can be the best option for many languages of the world as it gives complete freedom to speak
 duniya kii or kisi bhi lipi me yah nahi ho saktaa he
 The same would be true for Indonesia, Vietnam, Africa etc
 ashtaadhi ko dekhakar koi bhi samaj saktaa he kii duniya me isse acchhee koi bhi lipi nahin he
 If the world is biased, Devanagari would be the most accepted script of the world because it is completely scientific
 angreji bhashaa main vartanee kii vikaraal samasya ke kargar samaadhaan ke liye devanagari par aadhaarit devgreek lipi prastaavit kii gayi he
 See detailed article Devanagari Scientific
 jis prakaar bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya vaise hi devanagari bhi apni vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran hi ek din vishvanagari banegi
 Devanagari was developed in the era when writing was done by hand and for the use of rocks, palm leaf, parchment, bhojpatra, copper plate etc
 were used for writing
 kintu lekhan praudyogiki ne bahut adhik vikaas kiya or printing press, tiperiter aadi se hote hue vah computer yug main pahunch gayi he jahaan bolkar bhi likhnaa sambhav ho gaya he
 Problems with writing of any script are expected to develop with the development of technology
 isi kaaran devanagari main bhi samay-samay par sudhaar yaa maanakeekaran ke prayaas kiye gayi
 After the attainment of national language status in the independence movements of India, many personal and institutional efforts were made for the development and standardization of the script
 sarvapratham bal gangadhar tilak ne 'kesari font' taiyaar kiya tha
 Later, the Savarkar brothers prepared twelve bars
 gorakhnath ne maatra-vyavastha main sudhaar kiya
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das made efforts to simplify Devanagari by broadening the use of Anusvara
 devanagari ke vikaas main anek sansthagat prayaason kii bhoomika bhi atyant mahatvapurn rahi he
 In 1935, the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan made reforms related to Barakhari and Shirorekha through the Nagari Script Reform Committee
 isi prakaar, 1947 main narendra dev kii adhyakshata main gathit ek samiti ne barhakhadi, maatra vyavastha, anuswaar va anunasik se sambandhit mahatvapurn suzav diye
 The Ministry of Education, Government of India has made efforts at several levels to develop the Devanagari script
 san 1966 main maanak devanagari varnmaala prakashit kii gai or 1967 main ‘hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran’ prakashit kiya gaya
 See Hindi resources on the Internet

 Conduct against accepted values in public life is considered corrupt conduct
 aam jan jivan main ise aarthik aparaadhon se joda jaataa he
 Corruption is generally referred to as a misuse of governmental power and resources for personal gain
 ek duusari or adhik vyapak paribhaasha yah he ki nijee yaa saarvajanik jivan ke kisi bhi sthapit or sweekaarya maanak kaa chori-chhipe ulanghan bhrashtachar he
 It also varies according to different standards and country
 masalan, bharat main raksha saudon main kamishan kaanaa avaidh he isliye ise bhrashtachar or raashtra- virdohi krity maan kar ghotaale kii sangya di jaati he
 But in many developed countries of the world, this is a legitimate commercial operation
 samskritiyon ke bich antar ne bhi bhrashtachar ke prashn ko pechida banaaya he
 The British, who imposed colonial rule on India during the nineteenth century, viewed Indian sexual behavior as a misconduct in the mirror of their Victorian morality

 The issue of corruption is a political question that sometimes causes governments to change
 balki yah bahut bade-bade aitihaasik parivartanon kaa vaahak bhi rahaa he
 The practice of the Roman Catholic Church charging fees in exchange for grace was labeled corruption by Martin Luther
 iske kilaaf kiye gayi dharmik sangharsh se isai dharm- sudhaar nikle
 The Protestant vote was born as a result
 is aitihaasik parivartan se secularavaad ke sutrikaran kaa aadhaar taiyaar hua
 There is no unity about understanding related to corruption in socio-scientific discourse
 poonjeewaad virdohi nazariyaa rakhane vaale vidwaanon kii manyata he ki bazaar aadhaarit vyavasthaayen ‘greed iz good’ ke usul par chalati hai, isliye unke tahat bhrashtachar main badhotaree honi laazmi he
 On the other hand, in the dictatorial systems of the proletariat, advocating open society and anti-marxist intellectuals, the Communist Party officials largely misuse the resources of the state and guarantee themselves a comfortable life at the cost of the ordinary life of the common people
 Points out
 bhrashtachar kii duusari samaj rajya kii sanstha dwaara logon kii aarthik gatividhiyon main hastkshep kii maatra or daayre par nirbhar karti he
 Tax evasion is treated as a compulsion of social life under the Nizam, which is highly taxed
 isse ek siddhant yah nikalataa he ki jitne kam kanoon or niyantran honge, bhrashtachar kii zarurat utani hi kam hogi
 In favor of this view, the example of the former Soviet Union and the socialist countries of China is given, where despite the omnipresence of the institution of the state, a large amount of corruption exists
 ‘zyaada niyantran- zyaada bhrashtachar’ ke sameekaran ko sahi tehraane ke liye tees ke dashak ke america main kii gayi sharaab-bandi kaa udhaaharan bhi diya jaataa he jiske kaaran sangathit or aarthik bhrashtachar main abhootpurv oochaal aa gaya tha
 In the sixties and seventies some scholars had justified the presence of corruption and black money to an extent for the economic development of underdeveloped countries
 arnold je
 hidanhimer jaise siddhantkaron kaa kahana tha ki paramparabaddh or saamaajik rup se sthir samaajon ko bhrashtachar kii samasya kaa kam hi saamana karnaa padataa he
 But due to rapid industrialization and movement of population, societies continue to abandon established standards and values
 parinamswaroop bade paimaane par bhrashtachar kii parighatna paidaa hoti he
 This theory of Heidenheimer was particularly popular in the seventies
 bhrashtachar virdohi nitiyon or kaaryakramon kii vakaalat karne ke bajaay hidanhimer ne nishkarsh nikaala tha ki jaise-jaise samaaj main samruddhi badhati jaaegi, madhyavarg kii pratishtha main vruddhi hogi or shahari sabhyataa va jivan-style kaa vikaas hoga, is samasya par apane aap kaabo hota chalaa jayega
 But in the seventies itself, big political and economic scandals were exposed in Europe and America
 inamen america kaa waterget scandal or britain kaa paulson efere pramukh tha
 These scandals fueled the optimism of Heidenheimer's theory that believed in the development of middle class civic virtues
 saath ke dashak ke dauraan hi kuch anya vidwaanon ne bhi hidanhimer kii tarz par tark diya tha ki bhrashtachar kii samasya kii naitik vyakhyaayein karne se kuch hasil hone vaala nahin he
 Samuel Huntington was the chief among them
 in samaaj-vaigyanikon kii manyata thi ki bhrashtachar har paristhiti main nuksaandeh nahin hota
 In developing countries, it plays the role of oil in the machine, and the consumer revolution is accelerated by the money that people have to spend
 lekin africa main bhrashtachar ke upar vishwa bank dwaara 1969 main jari rapat ne is dharna ko dhakka pahunchaaya
 After this report, corruption was seen as an inevitable evil and a hindrance to economic development
 vishwa bank bhrashtachar ke kilaaf muhim chalaane main jute gaya
 One result of this discussion was that sociologists started showing more interest in the problem of corruption in relatively less developed countries
 viksit deshon main bhrashtachar kii samasya kaafii-kuch nazarandaaz kii jane lagi
 This approach was further strengthened in the era of globalization
 udhaar dene vaali antarrashtriya vittiya sansthaaon, un par haaavee viksit deshon or bade-bade corporeshnon ne yah guarantee karne kii koshish kii ki unke dwaara di jane vaali madad kaa sahi-sahi istemaal ho
 This resulted in the establishment of Transparency International in 1993, in which many former World Bank officials were active
 iske baad surveykshan or aankadon ke zariye bhrashtachar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan shuru ho gaya
 But the results of these efforts cannot be considered satisfactory in any way
 2007 main danniel treezman ne ‘whot haev ve larnd about da kaaziz of karpshan from ten ears of cross naishanal imperical research?’ likh kar nateeja niklaa he ki paripakv udaarataavaadi loktantr or bazaronmukh samaaj apekshaakrit kam bhrasht hai
 In contrast, oil-exporting countries, more legislative law-makers and countries that do not control inflation are far more corrupt
 zaahir he ki ye nishkarsh kisi bhi kone se naye nahin hai
 Recently, in the countries where economic scandals have been exposed, there are all kinds of countries, big and small and underdeveloped
 bhrashtachar ko suvidhajanak or hanikaarak maanane ke in paraspar virdohi najareeyon se pare hat kar agar dekha jaae to abhi tak aarthik vruddhi ke saath uske kisi sidhe sambandh kaa sutrikaran nahin ho paaya he
 For example, two countries in Asia, South Korea and the Philippines, have very high index of corruption
 lekin, korea main aarthik vruddhi kii dar kaasi he, jabaki philippines main nichi
