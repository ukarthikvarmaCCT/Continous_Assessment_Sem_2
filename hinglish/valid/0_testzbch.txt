 jab philip pela waapas laut aayaa, to use apane senapati atlus kii bhatiji cleopetra iridiis se pyaar ho gaya or usase vivaah kar liya

 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend

 sikandar ne arhidiyas ko chhod diya, joki sambhawatah olympiyas dwaara jehar dene ke parinamswaroop, maansik rup se viklang ho chukaa tha
 The news of Philip's death led to rebellions in several states, including Thebes, Athens, Thistle and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon
 jab vidroh kii khabar sikandar tak pahunchi, to usne turant us par dhyaan diya
 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry

 Alexander halted at Thermopile, where he was chosen as the leader of the Amphictyonic League, then proceeded south from there to Corinth

 The famous meeting between Alexander and Diogenes Diogenes the Scenic took place in Corinth
 jab sikandar ne diogens se poocha ki vah unke liye kya kar saktaa he, to darshanik ne ghrinaapurvak se sikandar ko ek taraf khadaa hone ke liye kaha, kyonki vah surya ke prakaash ko avaruddh kar rahaa tha
 Alexander was amused by this spot-on answer, and he said, "if i hadn't been Alexander, i wanted to be Diogenes"
 corinth main, jaise philip ko faras ke khilaaf aane vaale yuddh ke liye commander niyukt kiya gaya tha vaise hi sikandar ko hegaman kaa sheershak diya gaya
 Here he also received news of the Thracian rebellion

 He turned to Illyria in the west, after Alexander defeated them one by one, forcing both rulers to flee with his Saina
 in jeeton ke saath hi, usne apni uttari seemaa ko surakshit kar liya tha
 While Alexander was on his north expedition, he was informed of the rebellion of Thebes and the Athenian once again and Alexander immediately marched south
 jabaki anya shahar sikandar se takaraane main jhijak rahe the, thibs ne ladaai karne kaa faisla kiya
 Thebes' resistance was ineffective, and Alexander overtook them and annexed the city and divided the region among other Bootian cities
 thibs ke ant ne athens ko chup kar diya or asthaayee taur par hi sahi, saare yunaan par shanti aa gai
 Alexander then left his Asian campaign, leaving Antipiter as regent

 He invited all the chiefs of Gandhara, and asked them to take his jurisdiction under Alexander

" " He was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of intelligence, and the ideas of Pythagoras had a profound influence on Plato
 durbhaagya se, pithogoras ke bare main bahut kam tathy gyaat hai, kyonki un ke lekhan main se bahut kam hi bache hai
 Many of Pythagoras' accomplishments are actually achievements of his colleagues and successors

 He is commonly called a philosophical mathematician who had an influence on the beginning of axial geometry, written in Elements by Euclid 200 years after its development
 pithogoras ne shanti ke ek niyam kaa prekshan kiya jo acamithia kehalaata tha, is niyam ko todane par maut kii sajaa di jaati thi
 This was because Pythagoras believed that a person's words are usually careless, leading to mispronunciation, and according to him that one should always remain silent if anyone doubts what he should say
 
 unka ek or niyam tha ki "kisi bhi vyakti ki ek pareshaani main madad kerani chahie, use neeche nahin girane dena chahie, kyonki niskriyata ko protsaahit karnaa ek bahut bada paap he
 "and they used to say" don't go back after you leave your house, because the Furies will be with you, "it reminded them that learning a little without learning everything is better than creation, about God and mathematics, Learning the truth
 pithogoras kii jeevani porfyri main, kaha gaya ki "yah shanti koi saadhaaran kism kii shanti nahin thi
 "the Pythagoreans were divided into an inner circle methmetikoi and an outer circle akousmatikoi

 akusameticoi ko pithogoras ko dekhne kii ijaajat nahin thi or unhen panth ke andruni rahasy nahin sikhaaye jate the
 Instead, they were taught behavior and morality in secret ways, brief things with secret meanings

 After the murder of several methmetkoi by Cyclone's cohort, a grumpy disciple, the two groups are completely separated from each other, with Pythagoras' wife Theo and his two daughters capturing methmeticoica

 Pythagoras had many restrictions in its society
 jaise ek krosbaar par kadam nahin rakhaa jaye or faliyaan nahin khaayi jaaen
 These rules were old superstitions such as, "running down a ladder is bad luck
" "yahan tak ki pracheen samay main bhi pithogoras ko badnaam karne ke liye misticos logos naamak apmanjanak oopaadhi di gayi
 The ban on legumes may be related to favism which is widely spread around the Mediterranean region
 yahan mukhya bindu he akusamata arthath "niyam", taaki andhvishwasi nishedh praathmik rup se akusameticoiper lagu hote the or adhikansh niyam pithogoras kii mrityu ke baad aaye or methmeticoise bilkul mukt the

 Even stressed the expansion of certain rules and methods of worship
 methmeticoi ke liye pithogorian hone kaa matlab he ek janmajaat gunvattta or aantarik samaj kii upasthiti
 There was also another way of dealing with akousmata and -e; By their iconographic depiction

 We have evidence of Pythagorean living depiction as far back as the fifth century BCE, which means that such strange things were said to be puzzles
 pithogorian ko unki atmaaon kii sthanantargaman ke siddhant ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he or saath hi unka siddhant ki sankhya main chizon kii vaastavik prakruti he
 They adopted purification rites and developed different rules of living, believing that these rules would enable them to attain a higher status among the gods

 That is, a2 + b2 = c2
 haalaanki vah prameya jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he, pehle ise babiloniyon or bharatiyon ke dwaara kaam main liya gaya
 It is often said that he or his students gave the first evidence
 haalaanki is baat par dabaav daalaa janaa chahie ki jis tareeke se babiloniyon ne pithogoras kii sankhyaon ko sambhala usase pataa chalata he ki ve jaanate the ki yah siddhant saamanytah sahi sabit hota he or ve kuch aise pramaanon ke bare main bhi jaanate the jinhen ab tak kunirup sroton main nahin khoja gaya he
 Because of the secretive nature of their school and its students dedicating everything to their teachers, there is no evidence that Pythagoras worked on it himself to prove the theorem
 us maamle ke liye, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki unhone kisi bhi ganitiya yaa para ganitiya samasyaon par kaam kiya
 Some believe it to be a myth carefully constructed by Plato's followers two centuries after Pythagoras' death
 mukhyatah plato kii para bhautikee ke maamle ko aadhyatmik tehraane ke liye, jo unke dwaara pithogoras ko samarpit vichaaron kaa saath thik prakaar se kaam karte the
 This imposition has been going on for centuries and has been associated with modern times
 pithogoras ke naam kaa is prameya se sambandh sthapit karne kaa sabase pehla ullekh unki mrityu ke paanch sadiyon ke baad sisarau or plutark ke lekhan main miltaa he
 Today Pythagoras is distinguished as a devotee by the Ahl al-tauheed or Druze faith, along with his followers, Greek Plato, but there were also critics of Pythagoras, such as Heraclitus, who said that "learning too much does not make sense; Otherwise it was taught to Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again to Xenophanes and Hecateus
 pithogoras kaa drushtikon dharmik or vaigyanik tha, unki najar main vigyaan or dharm ek dusre se sambandhit hai
 Religiously, Pythagoras was a follower of metempsychosis
 ve sthantar aagaman yaa aatma ke punar janm main vishwaas karte the, unka maananaa tha ki aatma jab tak sadaachari nahin ho jaati tab tak vah maanav, pashu, yaa subjiyon main baar baar avatar leti rahati he
 His idea of rebirth was influenced by ancient Greek religion
 vah pehle vyakti the jisane yah prastaavit kiya kii vichaar prakriya or aatma mashtishk main sthit he dil main nahin
 He himself remembered four lives in detail as he claimed to have lived and used to hear the cry of his dead friend crying as a dog barked
 pithogoras kaa ek vishwaas yah tha ki jivan kaa saar sankhya he
 In this way, the stability of everything makes up the universe
 swasthya jaisi chijen tatwon ke ek sthir anupaat par nirbhar karti hai; kisi bhi cheez kaa bahut kam yaa bahut zyada hona ek asantulan kaa kaaran hota he jo kisi bhi jeev ko aswasth bana saktaa he
 He compared ideas to number calculations
 jab darshan lok siddhanton se jud jaataa he to vah vishwaas ban jaataa he, ki jivan ke saar kaa gyaan sankhyaon ke rup main khoja ja saktaa he
 If it is taken one step further, it can be said that because mathematics is an undiscovered essence, the essence of life is an undiscovered characteristic that can be encountered by studying mathematics
 pithogoras ke koi bhi lekhan nahin milte hai, haalaanki unke naam ke saath kuch jaali lekhan jude hai or inamen se vartmaan main bhi paae jate hai; ye puraatanta main prasaarit hue hai
 Complex ancient sources such as Aristotle and Aristogenus cast doubt on these writings
 pracheen pithogoriens ne aamtaur par apane swami ke vaakyanshon ko muhaavarey autose effe ke saath spasht kiya or apane shikshan kii multah maukhik prakruti par bal diya
 Pythagoras as the character of Ovid's last book in the Metamorphoses, where Ovid explains his philosophical outlook
 pithogoras ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he, "koi bhi aadmi mukt nahin he jo apane aap ko niyantrit nahin kar saktaa he
 " pithogoras kaa ek anya paksh bhi he, jisamen vah apane aitihaasik vyaktitv ke aas paas vistrut kinvadantiyon kaa ek vishay ban gaye
 Aristotle described Pythagoras as a supernatural being who performs miraculous acts, describing him in such an aspect as a Golden Thai, a symbol of divinity
 arestu or anya logon ke anusaar, kuch pracheen log maanate the ki unamem antariksh or samay se hokar yatra karne kii kshamta he or jaanwaron or podhon ke saath baat karne kii kshamta he
 "golden Thai" is an extract from the entry of Brewer's Dictionary of Frace and Fable
 aisa kaha jaataa tha ki pithogoras ke paas ek golden thai tha, jise usne aberis ko darshaya, jo uttardeshvasi pujari tha or usne olympic khelon main pradarshan kiya
 Another legend is drawn from Brewer's Dictionary
 vah unke chandramaa ke bare main varnan ko darshaati he
 Pythagoras believed that he could write on the moon
 unki yojana thi ki rakt main ek darpan par likhaa jaye or ise chaand ke saamne rakh diya jaye or jab chaand kii discs par shilaalekh pratibimbit hoga
 One of Pythagoras's main achievements was the discovery that music is based on a proportional interval of numbers from 1 to 4
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki sankhya pranali or isiilie brahmad pranali, in sankhyaon ke yoga par aadhaarit hoti he: das devataaon ke bajaay das yaa tetractis of di dekad ke dwaara pithogoras kii kasam
 Odd numbers were male and even numbers were female
 usne 3 se 5 jyamitiya thoson se nirmit, ganitiya anupaaton ke siddhanton kii khoj kii
 Hippasus, a member of his sequence, also discovered an proportional number, but the idea was not conceivable for Pythagoras, and according to legend Hippasus was executed
 pithogoras yaa ne varg sankhyaon kii bhi khoj kii
 He found that if for example, if four stones were taken and arranged as a square, then not only each arm is equal to the other arm, but if the two sides are multiplied by each other, they will arrange the square
 Is equal to the sum of the total number of stones in it
 isiilie ise "varg mul" kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the first to think that the Earth is round and all planets have an axis and that all planets revolve around a central point
 unhone kaha ki yah kendriya bindu prithvi he, lekin baad main kaha gaya ki yah kendriya bindu "agni" he jise unhone kabhi bhi surya ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa
 He also said that the moon is another planet that he called "counter Earth" —the latter believed in the limited — unlimited
 pithogoras yaa ek vyapak arth main pithogoriens ne plato ke kaam par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa
 According to RM Hare his influence consisted of three points: a) The Platonic Republic may be related to the ideas of "an organized community of like-minded people", as Pythagoras established in Croton
 ba) is baat ke pramaan hai ki sambhawatah plato ne pithogoras se yah vichaar liya ki ganit or saamaanya bhashaa, amoort soch darshanik soch ke liye ek surakshit aadhaar he, saath hi vigyaan or naitikta main paryaapt thisis ke liye bhi yaa aadhaar he
 C) Plato and Pythagoras presented the same idea in the "mystic approach to the soul and its place in the physical world"
 aisa lagata he ki donon orfism se prabhavit the
 Plato's ideas were clearly influenced by the work of Architas, an actual Pythagorean of the third generation, who made significant contributions to geometry, which is reflected in the Eighth Book of Elements of Euclid
 pracheen rome or numa pompilius kii kivdantiyon main rome kaa doosraa raja, pithogoras ke adheen adhyayan karata tha, aisa kaha jaataa he
 This is not likely because the two equally accepted dates for life do not impose
 pithogoras ne ek gupt samaaj kii sthapana kii jo pithogorian brotherhud kehalaati he yah ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit thi
 This had a profound influence on future occult traditions, such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, both groups devoted to the study of mathematics, both claiming to have developed from the Pythagorean Brotherhood
 pithogoras ke ganit ke rahasyamayi or gupt gunon kii charchaa menley pi haal ke adhyay di secret teachings of aal ages main kii gayi he jiskaa sheershak he "pithogorian methmatics "
 Pythagoras's theory later had a profound influence on numerology, which became very popular throughout the Middle East in the ancient world
 8 veen sadi ke muslim kemiagar jabir ebn hayaan ne vyapak sankhya vigyaan ke aadhaar par kaam kiya, vah pithogoras ke siddhant se bahut adhik prabhavit tha
 There is no primary source about Pythagoras
 yah lekh pithogoras kii shastreey vyakhya karata he jo baad ke lekhakon ke lekhon par aadhaarit he
 Since much of the information available is written after centuries of Pythagoras' life, his accuracy is uncertain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki praarambhik pithogorian kaa ganitiya mahatva atishyoktipurna he or pithogorian orfic yani gupt panthi the
 He had an influence on numerology, later serious mathematicians were born out of them when geometry became popular throughout Greece

 Jain philosophy is based on seven truths or fundamental principles, which are called tattva
 yah maanav durgati kii prakruti or uskaa nidaan karne kaa prayaas he
 According to the first two truths, it is axiomatic that Jiva and Ajiva exist
 teesraa satya he ki do padaarthon, jeev or ajeev ke mail se, jo yoga kehalaata he, karm dravya jeev main pravaahit hota he
 It clings to the organism and turns into karma
 chauthaa satya bandha kaa kaarak he, jo chetana kii abhivyakti ko simit karata he
 The fifth truth states that the stopping of new deeds is possible through self-restraint through adherence to right character, right philosophy and right knowledge
 gahan aatmasanyam dwaara maujuuda karmon ko bhi jalaayaa ja saktaa, is chhatwein satya ko "nirjara" shabd dwaara vyakt kiya gaya he
 The final truth is that when the Jiva is freed from the bondage of deeds, Moksha or Nirvana is attained, which is the goal of Jain education
 jain dharm ke anusaar aatma ek vaastaviktaa ke rup main maujuud he
 The soul has a separate existence from the body in which it lives
 chetana or upyog jeev ke lakshan hote he
 Although the creature realizes both birth and death, it does not actually create and destroy
 mrityu or janm keval jeev ke ek avasthaa ke khatm hone or agali dasha ke shuru hone ko darshaati he
 The influx of deeds is called asrava
 yah tab hota he, jab man, samvaad or sharir kii gatividhiyon dwaara utpann spandan ke kaaran karm kan aatma kii ore aakarshith hote hai| tattwarthsutra 6:1-2 ke anusaar, "man, samvaad or sharir kii gatividhiyon ko yoga kehete hai
 Due to these three actions there is an influx of Asravas or deeds
 " Deeds only affect the consciousness
 chetana ke saath karmon ke is bandhan ko bandha kehete hai
 However, there is no bonding only through yoga or activities
 bandha ke kai kaarnon main se, raag mukhya kaaran he
 In fact, the reason for sticking to karma is the stickiness of the soul, which is due to the existence of various ragas and mental nature
 karmon kii roak ko sanvar kehate hai
 The first step towards liberation or self-realization is to ensure that the paths through which karma is entering the soul are closed and new karma is not gathered
 ise karmon ke antarvah ko rokna yaa sanvar kaha jaataa he
 It is said to destroy or clear the already collected karma
 nirjara do prakaar kii hoti hai- Salvation of soul or redemption from deeds is called moksha
 yah aatma ke astitv kii aanandit avasthaa he, jo karmon ke bandhan se, sansar se or janm maran ke chakra se puri tarah mukt hoti he
 a liberated soul attains its true and original nature - infinite happiness, infinite knowledge and infinite philosophy
 aisi aatma ko siddh yaa paramatma kaha jaataa he or sarvocch aatma yaa bhagwaan maani jaati he

 kullu tathaa chamba ke kuch pracheen tamrapatton se gyaat hota he ki is lipi kaa praarambhik rup main vikaas 10 veen- 11veen shatabdi main ho gaya tha
 By the way, many scripts under the category of Takri are prevalent in this vast region like, Lunday, Kishtwadi, Chambayali, Mandayali, Sirmauri and Kullui etc

 Mr
 Whooler is of the opinion that Takri is the spirit of Sharda

 It also has an evolved form in which many texts have been published
