 'gayatri' ek chand bhi he jo rugveda ke saat prasiddh chhandon main ek he
 The names of these seven verses are - Gayatri, Ushnik, Anushtupa, Brihati, Virat, Tritupa and Jagati
 gayatri chand main aath-aath aksharon ke teen charan hote hai
 Among the mantras of the Rigveda, Gayatri verses have the highest number except the trinity
 gayatri ke teen pad hote hai 
 Therefore, when the symbol of creation was conceived in the form of verses or speech, then this world was considered the form of Tripada Gayatri
 jab gayatri ke rup main jivan kii pratikatmak vyakhya hone lagi tab gayatri chand kii badhati hui mahita ke anuroop vishesh mantra kii rachana hui, jo is prakaar he: We should imbibe the divine in our soul, sorrowful, joyous, exquisite, glorious, sinful, godlike
 vah paramatma hamaari buddhi ko sanhmaarg main prerit kare
 This mantra is first quoted in the Rigveda
 iske rishi vishwamitra hai or devtaa savita hai
 Though this mantra is only one of the 18 mantras of this sukta of Vishwamitra, but the Rishis had experienced its glory from the beginning in the sense of meaning and among the 10 Sahasra mantras of the entire Rigveda, the most serious euphemism of the meaning of this mantra
 done
 is mantra main 24 akshar hai
 There are three stages of eight letters each
 kintu brahman granthon main or kalantar ke samast sahitya main in aksharon se pehle teen vyahritiyaan or unase purv pranav yaa onkaar ko jodakar mantra kaa puraa swaroop is prakaar sthir hua: This form of the mantra is called Manu by Sapranava, Savyahritika Gayatri and has done the same in chanting
 gayatri tatv kya he or kyon is mantra kii itani mahima he, is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 According to Aarash belief, Gayatri gives a complete explanation of the interrelationship of Virat Vishva on the one hand and human life on the other, Devatattva on the one hand and Ghosts on the other, Mind on the one hand and Prana on the other, Knowledge on one hand and Karma on the other

 The awakened mind in the awakening is the great power of man
 jaise savita dev he vaise man bhi dev he

 ise hi gayatri ke tisare charan main kaha gaya he
 The interpretation of Brahmanical texts is - Karmāni dhiya:, that is, what we call dhi or intelligence element is not only the thoughts or imagination of the mind, but those thoughts have to be tangible in form

 But for this powerful power of mind, it is necessary to have strong or strong mind

 There is no cross of the powers of the mind
 unamem se jitna ansh manushya apane liye sakasham bana paata he, vahiin uske liye us tej kaa varaniya ansh he
 Therefore, the special sound in the prayer of Savita's life is also that Savita or the divine part of the mind is incarnated on the surface of the earth or ghosts and illuminates in the body
 is gayatri mantra main anya kisi prakaar kii kaamana nahin pai jaati
 The only desire here is that the divine power that man has received from God in the form of mind, he should know the same savita and through deeds make him meaningful in this life
 gayatri ke purv main jo teen vyahritiyaan hai, ve bhi sahetuk hai
 Earth is indicative of Prithvi loka, Rigveda, Agni, earthly world and waking state

 The word Brahm is attained

 Seeing the impermanence of the results, be disillusioned with the world, taking initiation from the Brahmastriya Guru and attaining brahmopathi is the ultimate effort of man
 brahm "bhootyoni" he arthath usee se pranimaatr utpann hote or usee main leen hote hai
 This action is not caused by any cosmic element, but as the ejaculatory extracts and swallows the webs from itself, just as drugs and hair come out of the earth and hair and follicles come out of the body, in the same way there is cosmopolitanism from Brahm
 apane anirvachaneey gyanarupi tap se vah kinchit sthool ho jaataa he jisase ann, praan, man, satya, lok, karm, karmfal, hiranyagarbha, namrup, indriyaan, akaash, vaayu, jyoti, jal or pruthivi ityadi utpann hote hai

 However, Sat and Asat, far and away, near and near, great and subtle in the heart, dynamic and dreamy, etc
, its characteristic nature is also often described

 For this, the great weapon of the Upanishads is directed towards the pursuit of selling the goal of Brahmrupi, being attuned to the self-proclaimed arrow that is sharpened by worship on the bow
 isse jeevatma or paramatma ke abhed kaa anubhavatmak gyaan ho jaataa he; hryday kii gaanth khul jaati, sab sanshay mit jate or punya or paap ke bandhan se mukti mil jaati he evam maran kaal main aatma or paramatma ek ho jate hai

 dwaitvaadi "ek hi vriksh par sate baithe do pakshi mitron main ek pipal ke mithe-mithe gode khaataa or doosraa takata maatr he" 
 In the mantra, the karma-fruit-bhakta takes the distinct distinction between the soul and the brahm, considering the difference between the two, but with the followings and other mantras and the sentence "brahmveda Brahmav Bhavati", the principle of this Upanishads is derived from Brahmatmakya

 As we all know that nowadays fraud cases are increasing day by day through internet banking
 computer yaa internet ke jariye kiye jane vaale is prakaar ke aparaadh ko ham sibar krime kah sakate hai
 Do you know about cybercrime? These are criminal activities done through computer or internet and are also known as computer crime
 dhokhadhadi credit yaa debit card se kii ja sakati he lekin credit card dhokhadhadi or sibar aparaadh data kii chori se hi adhiktar judaa hota hai
 But there are many reasons why a debit card can be hacked
 isiilie debit card kaa istemaal karte samay hamen saavdhaan rahanaa chahie kyonki yah hamaare batue / purse kaa sabase samvedansheel link hota he
 If there is any type of fraud done with a credit card, then there is a possibility of catching the culprit but if the fraud is done with a debit card then it becomes a bit difficult
 yah sidhe aapke bank khate se judaa hota he or yadi dhokhadhadi hoti he, to mehnat se kamaaye gaye paise ek hi jatke main aapke haath se ja chuke hote hai or phir aapako is baat kaa intjaar karnaa hota he ki wo waapas aapako milenge yaa nahin
 And then if your PIN was stolen then you can expect worse results
 kya aapane yah notice kiya he ki yadi dhokhadhadi credit card se kii jaati he to aapako apane rindaata ko sirf suchit karnaa hota he or aapako apni jeb se nakad kaa bhugtan nahin karnaa hota
 So nowadays people have started using credit cards for all types of non-cash transactions
 behatar hoga ki aap apana immergency fund kisi duusare bank ke alag yaa duusare online acount main rakhen kyonki ek bhi dhokhadhadi kii ghatana aapaki sari bachat kaa safaya kar sakati he
 Another solution can also be that you can put it in a bank CD as these are more secure and money can be withdrawn only by calling or going in person
 ham sabhi hamaari suvidha dekhte hai or kareebi atm ko tarjeeh dete hai
 Ignoring this, we often transact money at a mall or a shop, but very few go to atms made in bank branches
 kya aap jaanate hai ki shakhaon se dur sthit atm bhi jokhim bhare hai? The simple thing is that external atms are not monitored compared to atms installed in the branch
 saath hi, uchit suraksha vyavastha vaali bank main pravesh karnaa dhokhebaajon ke liye mushkil hoga sochie!vaise to bank kaa atm surakshit hota he lekin bank ke varking aavars ke baad yah jokhim bharaa sabit ho saktaa he kyonki lobby kaa darwaja kholane ke liye jaise hi aap apana card slot main daalate hai, dhokheybaaj kuch skimming upkarnon ke madhyam se bahut aasaani se atm se aapaki jaankaree nikaal sakate hai
 Therefore, do not use the ATM after the time of work is over
 aisa vyakti jo dhokhadhadi karne main vishwaas rakhata he aapkaa card number or pin donon hasil kar legaa or phir use doshi sabit karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 This will give him an opportunity to succeed
 isliye, har maheene apana pin badalane kii aadat daalen

 If your phone is stolen or when you sell your phone then all the information available in the phone can be removed
 aapane apana phone lock bhi kar rakhaa ho tab bhi yah surakshit nahin he
 Therefore, we have to be careful
 kya aap jaanate hai ki debit card kaa online istemaal jokhim bhare kadamon main se ek he? yadi aapke paas credit card nahin he to pre– ped card main paise daalen or online shopping ke liye usee kaa upyog karen
 This way you can keep the thieves away from your bank account
 ho saktaa he aap saavdhaanee barat rahe hon lekin kabhi– bhi kuch–bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, be active while setting up alerts so that as soon as fraud is detected
 yadi jaalsaaj aapke khate tak pahunch gaye hai to sambhav he ve chote tranjaction se card kii jaanch karnaa chahenge
 If you have appropriate alerts for each transaction, it will be easy to catch them
 isliye, yadi kabhi– kabhi aap paise nikaalte hai or aapako koi alert sandesh nahin miltaa hai to praathamikta ke aadhaar par isaki jaanch karen
 Also, we should never share our details with anyone via phone, email etc
 bank kabhi bhi dastavejon ke satyaapan or aisi anya prakriyaaon ke liye kisi ko phone nahin karte hai
 Therefore, friends be careful and do not share it with anyone
 koi bhi kol aae bank ke naam par to usko andekha karaden

 The rapid spreading primary subtype describes approximately 10–15% of individuals in whom the initial MS symptoms have never improved
 isaki visheshta beemaari kii shuruyaat se hone vaali viklaangata kaa teji se failaav he, jisamen bilkul nahin yaa keval samayik or maamuli kami or sudhaar hota he
 The period of onset of the disease for the fast-spreading primary subtype is longer than the recurrence-deficient period of the disease, but it refers to the duration of the disease's recurrence-deficient and rapidly spreading secondary importance
 The duration is similar
 donon hi maamalon main yah avadhi kareeb 40 varsh he
 Rapidly spreading recurrence MS describes individuals who, from the time of onset of the disease, have a similar degree of neurological caries but are also subjected to obvious post-seizures

 Several possible causes have been investigated and it has been found that they do not affect the rates of recurrence of MS disease
 is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin he ki stanpan karana, shaareerik aghat, yaa uhatoff kii ghatana beemaari ke punaravartan ke kaaran hai
 More probably, MS arises as a result of some genetic, environmental and infectious factors
 ames ke jaanapadik rog vigyaan sambandhi adhyayan ne beemaari ke sambhavit kaarnon ke sambandh main suzav uplabdh karaayaa he
 Theories try to mix the known data with truth-like interpretations, but none have been proved conclusive
 ames ko ek anuvanshik beemaari nahin mana jaataa he
 However, several genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease

 In addition to family studies, specific genes have been associated with MS
 maanav shwet koshika pratijan pranali- gunasutra 6 main jeenon kaa ek samooh jo maanav main pramukh oothkasanyojyata samooh ke rup main kaary karata he - ames se peedit hone ki sambhaavna ko badhaata he
 The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and the pairs of genes of MHC defined as DR15 and D6
 anya sthalon ne ek surakshatmak prabhaav darshaya he, jaise ki HLA-C554 or hla-drb1*11loci
 Various environmental risk factors with both infectious and non-infectious origins have been proposed for MS
 haalanki kuch aanshik rup se parivartaneey hai, sirf bhavishya main hone vaale anusandhan - vishesh rup se naidanik pareekshan-yah bataaenge ki unke unmoolan se ames main madad mil saktaa he yaa nahin
 MS is very common among people living far away from the equator, although many exceptions exist

 Arthritis is statistically lower in people affected by MS and lower levels of uric acid have been found in patients with MS than in normal people
 isane is siddhant ko janm diya ki urik acid ames ke viruddh suraksha pradaan karata he, haalanki uskaa sahi-sahi mahatv agyaat bana hua he
 Genetic hypersensitivity may explain some of the geographic and epidemiological variations of the occurrence of MS, such as a very high incidence of disease in some families and a decreased risk with genetic distance, but it may also be an event, such as migration at an early age
 Not responsible for changes in accompanying risk is mahamari vigyaan kaa nishkarsh yah ho saktaa he ki kisi vyapak sookshm jeev bajaay ki ek durlabh rogaanu dwaara utpann kuch prakaar kaa sankraman beemaari kii utpatti kaa kaaran hota he
 Various hypotheses have detailed various processes of its possible origin
 swatchta sambandhi pariklpana yah suzav detaa he ki jivan ke aarambh main vibhinn sankramak agenton se sampark ames ke viruddh surakshatmak he, jisamen beemaari aise agenton dwaara baad main hone vaale saamana ke prati pratikraya karata he
 The prevailing hypothesis suggests that in high incidence areas of MS, the disease is usually caused by a single germ
 adhikansh vyaktiyon main lakshanrahit satat sankraman utpann karne vaala yah rogaanu bahut aam hota he
 In only a few cases and after several years of original infection, it damages the myelin sheath
 swatchta sambandhi pariklpana ko prasar pariklpana se adhik samarthan praapt hua he
 Evidence that the virus has been considered as a cause includes the presence of cerebral oligoclonal bands and cerebrospinal fluid in most patients, the presence of cerebral marrow inflammation that damages the human myelin sheath of various viruses, and infection of viruses
 Initiation of action that damages myelin sheath in animals
 Human esophagus viruses are a candidate group of viruses associated with MS
 jo vyakti kabhi bhi epstine baar vishaanu dwaara sankramit nahin hue hai unamem is beemaari ke hone kaa kam khatra hota he or sankramit vyaktiyon main se yuva vayaskon ke rup main sankramit hone vaale vyaktiyon main kam umr main isse sankramit hone vaale vyaktiyon kii apeksha is beemaari ke hone kaa adhik khatra hota he
 Although some people believe that this contradicts the health hypothesis, because uninfected individuals have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction with the disease-causing bacteria
 It is encountered in the moment of
 ames se judy hui anya bimariyon main khasra, galsua or rubella bhi sambandhit hai
 The blood – brain barrier is a micro-blood vessel system that should prevent t cells from entering the nervous system
 The blood – brain barrier is not normally permeable to these types of cells, unless it is activated by infection or a virus, which reduces the integrity of the solid joints that cause the blockage

 Currently, MS is thought to be a disorder caused by the immune process that has an early cause, which may have a history of work-related causes of the disease, although the concept has been debated for years and some people still oppose it
 We do

 The immune system invades the nervous system, possibly as a result of exposure to a molecule with a similar structure
 multiple sclerosis ghaav ke nishaan ko suchit karata he jo tantrika tantra main utpann hote hai
 MS lesions most commonly include the white matter area surrounding the cerebellar cavities, the cerebral column, the basal neural sub-center and the optic nerve

 MS results in dilution or complete damage of myelin and, as the disease progresses, the expansion or ablation of nerve cells
 jab milin nasht ho jaataa he, ek tantrika koshika prabhavakaari dhang se vidyut sanketon ko sanchalit nahin kar saktaa he
 In the early stages of the disease, there is a process of repair, called remyelination, but oligodendrocytes cannot completely rebuild the myelin sheath of the cell

 t cells identify myelin as an external substance and attack it as if it were an invasive virus
 It activates inflammatory processes by inducing other immune cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and antibodies

 Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms may be similar to other medical problems
 chikitsa sanghathanon ne peshewar chikitsakon ke liye naidanik prakriya ko sahaj or maanak ke anusaar karne ke liye, khaas taur par beemaari ke pratham charnon main, ek naidanik maandand banaaya he
 Historically, both Schumacher and Pauser criteria were popular
 vartmaan main, mcdonald maandand naidanik prayogshaala or ames ke ghaavon ke prasar se sambandhit vikiran vigyaan sambandhi aankadon ke saath pradarshan kaa sahi samay or sahi sthaan par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Clinical data alone may be sufficient for the diagnosis of MS if there have been isolated incidents with an individual with neurological symptoms
 chunki kuch log keval ek akraman ke baad chikitsa sambandhi dekhbhaal chaahate hai, anya pareekshan nidaan ko sheeghra or sahaj kar sakate hai
 The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neurological imaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, and refresh capabilities

 Interferon beta-1 a
 a third drug, glatiramer acetate, is a non-interferon, non-steroidal immune controller
 chauthi aushadhi, mitogentron, ek pratirakshi shaamak he jiskaa prayog cancer rasayan-chikitsa main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The fifth drug is natalizumab
 Interferon and glatiramer acetate were often given by injection, which varied from once a day for glatiramer acetate to once per week for Avonax
 naitailizumaib or mitogentron masik antaraal par IV arq die jate hai
 All five types of drugs are much less effective at reducing the number of attacks in relapse-reduction of MS disease, whereas the potency of interferon and glatiramer acetate is more controversial
 unke dirghakaalik prabhaavon ke adhyayanon kaa abhi bhi abhaav he
 Comparisons between immune controllers show that natalizumab is most effective in both the reduction of recurrence rate of the disease and preventing the development of disability
 Mitoxantrone may be the most effective of them all, however, it is not generally considered as a long-term treatment, as its use is limited by severe secondary effects
 rremesa kii shighratisheeghra naidanik prastuti naidanik rup se pruthak sanglakshan he
 Treatment with interferon during the initial attack will reduce the likelihood that the patient will develop clinical MS

 Mitoxantrone has shown favorable effects in patients with rapidly spreading secondary and recurrent periods of fast spreading disease
 yah beemaari ke teji se failane ko rokane or alpakaalik kaarywahi main marijon main beemaari ke punaravartan ki aavriti main bahut kam prabhavi hota he
 No treatment has been proven to improve the period of rapid spread of MS
 kisi bhi chikitsa upachaar ke saamaan, in upachaaron ke kai pratikul prabhaav hai
 One of the most common of these effects is irritation at the injection site of glatiramer acetate and interferon treatments
 samay ke saath, injection vaali jagah par vasa utak ke sthaneey kshati, jise lipotrophy kaha jaataa he, ke kaaran ek dikhaai padane vaala kharonch viksit ho saktaa he
 Interferons cause symptoms similar to influenza; Some patients using glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction that is characterized by a twitching, chest tightness, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and anxiety, usually lasting less than three minutes

 Disease-correcting treatments reduce the rate of rapid spread of the disease, but do not prevent it
 jaise-jaise multiple sclerosis kaa teji se prasar hota he, lakshanikta badhati jaati he
 The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficiencies resulting in rapidly spreading weakness and disability
 isliye in kamiyon kaa prabandhan bahut mahatvapurn he
 Both drug therapy and neurological rehabilitation have shown a reduction in the burden of certain symptoms, although neither of them affects the rapid spread of the disease
 kuch lakshanon, jaise ki asthir mutrashay or sanstambhata, main aushadhi ke saath ek acchhee pratikriya hoti he, jabaki kai dusron kaa prabandhan or adhik jatil hota he
 For a patient with neurological deficiencies, a multidisciplinary approach is critical to improving quality of life, however, there are particular difficulties in assigning a 'central team' as people affected by MS are often at some point a health related profession or service may be required
 bahu-vishyak punarvaas kaarykram marijon kii gatividhi or bhagidaari main vruddhi kar saktaa he lekin durbalata ke star ko prabhavit nahin karata he
 Similar to most chronic diseases, alternative treatments are adopted by some patients, despite the lack of supportive, comparable, frequently repeated scientific studies

 Two major measures are used in epidemiological studies: decomposition and prevalence
 Decomposition is the number of new cases per unit-risk at some point; Whereas prevalence is the total number of cases of disease in a population at a given time
 vyapaktaa na keval aghatan par, balki prabhavit logon kii uttarjivita dar or pravaason par bhi nirbharta ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The prevalence of MS varies from 2 to 150 per 100,000 depending on the country or specific population

 The French Scientologist jean-martin Charcot was the first to identify multiple sclerosis as a particular disease in 1868
 pichhali reporton kaa saransh karte huye or usamen apni naidanik or rog vishyak avlokanon ko jodate huye, charcot ne beemaari ko sclaros en plax kaha
 ames ke teen sanket jise ab charcot kaa trik 1 kaha jaataa he ve hai netracamp, aichhik camp or taar dwaara preshit bhashaa, yadhyapi ye sab ames ke liye anokhe nahin hai
 Charcot also noted knowledge changes, describing his patients as a "attenuation of specific memory" and "concepts arising slowly"

 vishesh rup se, carswell ne paae gaye choton kaa varnan " shosh ke saath meru rajju ke ek vilakshan ghaav" ke rup main kiya
 Following Charcot's description, Eugene devic, Joseph Ballo, Paul Ferdinand Schilder, and Otto Marburg described special cases of the disease

 Emerging agents for RR MS who have exhibited symptoms in Phase 2 trials include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, rituximab, dirucotide, BHT-3009, cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, estriol, phengolimod, lavinimode, minocycline, tetanomers, tetins, tetins, tetins, and tetanomers
 Elemtuzumab did a better job of achieving a picture of recurrence-deficient disability, abnormalities and recurrence frequency of MS than interferon beta-1 at the cost of increased self-immune problems
