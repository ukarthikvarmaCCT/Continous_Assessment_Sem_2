 yantric ghurndarshi ek santulit chakra yaa pahiyaa hota hai, jo is prakaar aadhaar valyon main sthapit rahata he ki isaki teen swatantry sankhyaayein hoti hai
 This wheel is also called rotor or rotor
 yah chakra ek aksh yaa dhuree ke chaaron or paribhraman kar sakane ke liye swatantra hota he
 This axis is called Bhrami axis
 yah aksh yaa dhuree ek aadhaar valay main uske kshaitij vyas par sthit rahati he or yah valay swany bhi ek anya bahya valay main ek kshaitij aksh ke chaaron ore paribhraman kar saktaa he
 This axis is right angles to the ground axis
 bahya valay bhi ek urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore gum saktaa he
 Thus the axis of this wheel or rotator can be kept pointing in any desired direction
 bhrami karte samay yah chakra do mul ghurndarshi gunon kaa pradarshan karata he : avasthitatv purassaran 
 It is absolutely necessary to understand the characteristics of these qualities in order to understand the roundabout well
 newton ke pratham gatinium ke anusaar koi bhi pind jis avasthaa main rahata he usee main bana rahanaa chahta he or us avasthaa main kisi prakaar ke parivartan kaa virodh karne kii pravriti pradarshit karata he
 This tendency is called inertia
 apni dhuree par bhraman karata hua roter apane praarambhik tal main hi paribhraman karnaa chahta he or koi balghurna sthapit karne par uskaa virodh karata he
 The second feature of the rotor of a rotary rotary is the protraction
 paribhraman karte hue kisi pind ke koniya samveg main parivartan karne ke liye ek balaghurna aavashyak hota he
 If the axes of the thrust and angular momentum are coincident, then an angular acceleration is produced in that body, but the plane of rotation of that body remains unchanged
 iske vipareet yadi ukt donon aksh paraspar sam-konik hote hai, to pind ke koniya veg main koi antar nahin aata, kintu paribhraman kaa tal swayan hi ghoomane lagata he
 This type of motion is called Purasaran
 ghurnakshasthapi kii kriyaayein sabhi paribhramanshil yaa ghurnshil pindon main drushtigochar hoti he, kintu adhik koniya samveg vaale pindon main ye kriyaayein adhik spasht hoti hai
 It is due to angular momentum that the properties of firmness and inertia are included in the rotational system
 kisi pind par jab koi balyugma kaary karata he, tab us pind main balyugma ke aksh ke chaaron ore ek koniya samveg utpann ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran pind main us aksh ke chaaron or bhrami karne kii pravriti utpann ho jaati he
 The angular velocity of that body will increase as long as it continues to work
 nimnlikhit sameekaran ghurnakshadarshi ke gun ko abhivyakt karata he- Where the vector τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} are the convolutional and angular momentum superimposed on the rotoscope, respectively
 adish i iskaa jadtwaghurna he, sadish ω → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ omega }}} iskaa koniya veg he, or sadish α → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ alpha }}} koniya twaran he
 It is clear from this equation that if the rotating τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} is placed perpendicular to the rotating-axis, it causes τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} will generate vertical displacement of both
 is gati ko purassaran kehete hai
 The angular velocity of the precession will be the following: maan liya, ek baari chakra ek kshaitij dhuree k-kha par nartan kar rahaa he
 The two forces f and f at both ends of the axis are acting in such a way that a forcem is formed from them
 isse utpann hone vaala balghurna g = F
l, jahaan l aksh k-kha kii lambaai he
 As a result, this entire system will begin to be propagated around another longitudinal axis
 yadi chakra ke paribhraman kaa veg w tathaa purassaran kii dar w¢ ho to g = i 
 w 
 w¢, jahaan i us chakra kaa nartan aksh ke chaaron ore jadtwaghurna, he
 Therefore, if the angular momentum i w of the circle is very high, then the value of w ¢ will be very low
 isse spasht he ki bahut adhik jadtwaghurnavala chakra yadi kisi aksh ke chaaron ore bahut teji se paribhraman kar rahaa ho, to us par kisi bahari alpakaalik balghurna, G, kaa prabhaav atyant ksheen padegaa, arthath vighnkaaree bahya balon se vah vyavahaarat: aprabhavit rahegaa
 In order to have a greater angular momentum, a rotating wheel with a much larger diameter is used in the rotor
 iske atirikt bhrami veg w badhaakar bhi ghurnakshasthapi ke koniya samveg main bahut adhik seemaa tak vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 With this, no short-term external exertion can be effected on the earwax
 uparyukt gun ke kaaran ghurnakshasthapi kaa prayog prithvi ke paribhraman kaa digdarshan karne ke hetu kiya ja saktaa he
 The earth revolves on its axis in the direction of west to east
 iskaa ek paribhraman 24 ghanton main puraa hota he
 If a rotator is placed at a location on the earth plane in such a way that its land axis is horizontal in the east-west direction, the earth's revolutions as well as its entire structure will revolve around the center of the earth, because each time the surface of that structure Will remain perpendicular to the earth plane
 kintu apane jadtv tathaa atyadhik koniya samveg ke kaaran bhoomi aksh apni praarambhik disha ke hi samaantar rahegaa
 Therefore, due to the revolutions of the Earth, the illusion, which was initially parallel to the Earth's plane, would be seen making a few angles per moment
 is prakaar ghunkshisthapi kaa bhramiaksh apane samakonik ekakshatij aksh ke chaaron ore purassaran karata hua prathit hoga
 The first useful form of the clock was presented by the German engineer Johann Boenberger

 Later Liou Phukas used it to authenticate the revolutions of the earth

 Due to this, necessary errors can be eliminated by making necessary amendments
 ghurndarshi ke kuch mahatvapurn vyaavhaarik upyog nimnlikhit hai : The rotating wheel has become an indispensable tool for the direction control of aircraft
 dishasuchak ghurndarshi vayuyan ke yantrapatal par chaalak ke thik saamne laga rahata he
 In its initial position, its astrology remains parallel to the earth plane
 iske chakra ke thik saamne ek chhidr hota he, jisamen se hokar aanevaali vaayu kaa prabal jhonka chakra ko badi teji se ghumata rahata he
 When the aircraft is rotated while flying, the rotator's skeleton remains in its initial direction
 isaliye vayuyan kaa ghumaav thik thik gyaat ho jaataa he
 Normally in aircraft the direction of the magnetic compass is understood, but when rotating the aircraft, or due to the winds, its needle randomly starts moving around and the exact direction is not known immediately
 ghurndarshi in sabase sarvatha aprabhavit rahata he
 Therefore, it acts as a complement to the magnetic compass and helps the driver to find the exact direction of its destination
 ek doosraa ghurndarshi chaalak ko yahi thik thik batalaata he ki vah kitne unche yaa neeche ja rahaa he
 The driver of an aircraft flying high above the earth is difficult to detect in which direction its vehicle is going up or down
 isaliye use is ghurndarshi kii sahaayta leni padati he
 The initial direction of its vertex is vertical
 jab vayuyan upar chadhataa yaa neeche utarataa he, tab vayuyan tal ke urdhwadhar se is aksh ke jhukaav dwaara vayuyan kii disha kaa thik thik gyaan ho jaataa he
 The artificial horizon of this ring is called, because it takes the same help from the horizon on earth

 In biology, symmetry refers to the balanced presence of organs of the same form in an organism, for example in humans, the balanced system has one left and one right hand like that
 jeevigyaan main kai prakaar kii samamiti dekhi jaati he or aitihaasik rup main iskaa jeevvaigyanik vargeekaran main kaafii mahatv rahaa he
 Vascular symmetry is found in such organisms that if cut by an imaginary plane emanating from their center, they can be seen in many places in their severed parts
 udhaaharan ke liye taramin main vyasiya samamiti hoti he
 Such creatures have no right-hand side
 dwibhageeya samamiti un jeevon main pai jaati he jinhen agar bich main se upar se neeche ek samtal kaate to do lagbhag ek jaise baraabar ke hisse ban jate hai
 This symmetry is seen in humans, dogs, etc
 kram-vikaas ke najariye se dwibhageeya samamiti praaniyon ke panpane ke liye bahut hi safal rahi he or vartmaankaal main prithvi ke 99% praaniyon main dwibhageeya samamiti dekhi jaati he
 Biological symmetry is seen in some Tenophora-like organisms, which are a combination of diatomic and two-dimensional symmetry
 isamen jeev ko apane kendra ke ird-gird susajjit chaar bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he jisamen ulte chor ke do bhaag ek-jaise hote hai lekin ve anya do bhaagon se alag hote hai, jo ki swayan aapas main ek-se hote hai
 Some biologists are of the opinion that in evolution of life, it is a halt between biotic and bipartite symmetry, that is, in the beginning organisms had divergent symmetry, which then evolved bivalent symmetry which later evolved into bipartite symmetry
 saare jeevon main samamiti nahin hoti
 There are also some organisms in which asymmetry is found
 kuch had tak samamiti-vaale jeevon main bhi asamamiti hoti he kyonki unke ek-jaise bhaagon main bhi zaraa-bahut antar to hota hi he, masalan kisi maanav ke donon haathon main thodaa sa antar hota hi he or maanvon kaa hriday bhi sharir ke keval baayein bhaag main hota he
 But some sponges and other organisms are such that there is no symmetry in their anatomy
 dhyaan den ki kuch anya spanjon main vyasiya samamiti dekhi jaati he
 Humayun's tomb building complex is a tomb monument inspired by Mughal architecture
 yah nai dilli ke dinapanaah arthath puraane kile ke nikat nizamuddin purv kshetra main mathura maarg ke nikat sthit he

 ye imaarat kii mukhya kabr he
 Its entrance is on the southern side with a single EVAN, and the evans of other directions have a network of white confluence
 samraat kii asli samadhi thik neeche aantarik kaksh main bani he, jiskaa rasta baahar se jaataa he
 Just above it is a showy but beautiful replica
 neeche tak aam paryatakon ko pahunch nahin di gai he
 The entire building uses a marble mosaic called the Petra Dura and this type of tomb placement is an important part of indo-islamic architecture, which has been used extensively in the later tombs of the Mughal Empire, such as the Taj Mahal
 mukhya kaksh main sangmarmar kii jalidaar ghere ke thik upar mehrab bhi bana he, jo pashchim main makka kii ore bana he
 There is a line of sura-un-noor, usually at the entrance, instead of Sura 24 of the Quran, through which light enters the Qibla

 After this comes the Arabian inn which was built by Hamida Begum for the artisans engaged in the construction of the main mausoleum
 is parisar main hi afasarvaala makbara bhi bana he, jo akbar ke ek nawab ke liye bana tha
 Along with this, its mosque is also built

 The charbagh spread here is spread over an area of 13 hectares
 aane vaale varshon main ye sab teji se badalata gaya
 The main reason for this was the Agra transfer of the capital
 baad ke mughal shaskaon ke paas itnaa dhan nahin rahaa ki ve in baagon aadi kaa manhagaa rakrakhaav kar saken
 By the 18th century, the local people started growing vegetables in Charbagas here

 Under the Consumer Goods Act, 2006, certain guidelines have been provided so that consumers cannot charge to eliminate the maximum price printed on the goods by the manufacturer
 ye dishanirdesh hai:1
 upabhokta vastuon sabhi vastuon or item bikri ke liye bazaar main laayaa jaataa he or upabhoktaaon ke upyog or upbhog ke liye hai matlab; Cost of production 2
 The cost incurred directly or indirectly from the manufacturer in the production of goods means 3

 Under the standards of weights and measures regulations, manufacturers have to specify retail sales on all pre-packaged goods, all taxes made for MRP inclusive
 yah upabhoktaaon pack maal kii keemat ke bare main agent / dealer or dukandaaron dwaara gumraah nahin kar rahe hai ki yah sunishchit karne ke liye hoti ek aavashyaktaa he
 The overcharged trader may be prosecuted and prosecutorily changed packaged commodities, which may be initiated against the manufacturer in a price-bear case for which it is a crime
 uparyukt maamle main, dealer upabhokta packaging dekh sakate hai or ek ucch emarpy uddhrut nahin kar saktaa he ki is tathy kaa laabh letaa he
 Sometimes it is also the manufacturer that increases the price of a products and sells the old stock / product at new price rates and if buyers ask, they simply increase the price because of changes in duties or increase in cost of production, the answer is This happens and new packages take the modified MRP
 jaahir he, is nai keemat footkar bikri ke saath pehle se hi share karne ke liye lagu nahin hota
 Doing so by retailers is an unfair trade practice, even if trying to make a quick buck by trying to sell the old stock at the newly revised rate and where it is
 isi tarah ke mudde par ek shikayatakarta sheersh upabhokta adaalat ke samaksh ek shikaayat maamla daayar kiya
 The issue involved in the complaint was that the complainant had to purchase a product namely tarpaulin, the price mentioned on the 'baby sheet' purchased by him was Rs 92, but the seller asked him to pay for Rs 112 with the price of the sheet actually
 i was Rs 124, but after discussion it was Rs 92
 From that statement, the price settled between them at 112 rupees as MRP indicated was an old label
 upar koi fark kaha main rajya ayog utpaada par puraane label emarpy ke rup main 92 rupee kaa sanket diya he, to packaging par ullekh kiya gaya he or adhik se adhik charge avaidh he or vikreta kii gatividhi ek anuchit vyapaar vyavhaar kaa gathan kiya he ki aayojan kiya
 And as a punishment for indulging in such a practice, the Commission used a relatively new provision in the Consumer Protection Act to enforce exemplary damages and asked the seller to pay consumer punitive damages of Rs 10,000
 vikreta ek apil daayar kii he, jisamen se pehle sheersh upabhokta adaalat he, yah puri tarah se rajya ayog ke drishy ke saath sahmati vyakt kii gai he
 While doing so, it is reported that the price applied only to new shares, which increased the cost of production and transportation, was increased from Rs 92 to Rs 124
 puraane stock kii keemat main parivartan nahin kar sakate
 Under the circumstances, the old stock cannot be sold at the new price
 isliye, rajya ayog anukaraniya muaavja lagane main sahi tha

 It is for this reason that manufacturers provide more than enough cushion for the dealer margin while marking MRP

 iluminaati ek aisa naam he jo kai samoohon, donon aitihaasik or aadhunik or donon vaastavik or kaalpanik ko sanderbhit karata he
 Historically, it specifically refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret committee established on 1 May 1776
 aadhunik samay main yah ek kathith shadyantrapurn sanghathan ko sanderbhit karne ke liye bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, jo "singhaasana ke peeche ek aspasht shakti" ke rup main kaary karata he, kathith rup se vartmaan sarkaron or nigamon ke madhyam se duniya ke maamalon ko niyantrit karte hue, aamtaur par bavarian iluminaati ke ek aadhunik avatar ke rup main
 is prakaran main, iluminaati aksar ek nai vishwa vyavastha ke sandarbh main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many intrigue theorists believe that the Illuminati are the planners behind the events that will promote the establishment of the new world order

 Some authors, such as Augustine Baruel and John Robinson, even claimed that Illuminati was behind the French Revolution, a claim that jean-joseph Moonier wrote in his 1801 book, 'on the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, free-mansions, and to the Illuminati on Rejected in The Revolution of France
 samooh ke anuyaayiyon ko "iluminaati" naam diya gaya, haalanki ve khud ko "perfectabilists" bulaate the
 The group is also called the Illuminati Order and the Bavarian Illuminati, and the movement itself is referred to as Illuminatism

 He was a supporter of enlightened dictatorship and in 1784 his government banned all secret societies including Illuminati

 The members of the Illuminati gave a promise of obedience to their superiors and were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees

 lekhak jaise mark dise,david ike, rayaan bark, juri leena or morgan greecer, kaa kahana he ki bavarian iluminaati sambhawatah is din tak jivit he
 Many of these theories propose that the events of the world are being controlled and manipulated by a secret committee calling itself the Illuminati
 saazish siddhantkaron ne daawa kiya he ki winston churchill, bush parivaar, baraak obama, rothschild parivaar, david rockfilor or zbiganiyeff brajinsky sahit kai pramukh log iluminaati ke sadsy the yaa hai
 In addition to the obscure and clandestine organization, many modern fraternal groups claim to be the 'heirs' of the Bavarian Illuminati and have openly used the Illuminati name in establishing their own scriptural work
 kuch, jaise ki ekaadhik samooh jo swayan ko "iluminaati aadesh" par kuch raddobadal kehete hai, apane sanghathan ke naam main is naam kaa sidhaa upyog karte hai, jabaki anya jaise ordo templi orients, is naam ko apane sanghathan ke andar pravartan kii ek shrenee ke rup main upyog karte hai
 Illuminati are a recurring theme in popular culture

 The game in simple language is as follows: overon kii sankhya main kami ke sthiti main, udhaaharan ke liye kharaab mausam ke kaaran, overon kii sankhya kam ho sakati he
 If for some reason the number of overs played by the team batting in the second innings is different from the team batting in the first innings, the result can be determined by the Duckworth – Lewis method

 The king said, "what is the lack of something that you have tied Dora?" “ itnaa kahkar rani ke manaa karne par bhi raja ne us dore ko todkar phek diya
 At night, a woman said to the king in a dream- "I am going and another woman is coming in dialect
" “ is prakaar is baarah din tak roj yahi swapn aata
 He started feeling sad
 rani ke poochne par raja ne rani ko swapn kii baat bataa di
 The queen asked the king to ask the names of both the women
 raja dwaara unase poochne par pehali stri boli main lakshmi hoon or dusri ne apana naam daridrata bataaya
 The next day the king saw that all his wealth had been exhausted
 ve itane nirdhan ho gayi ki unke paas khaane tak ko na rahaa
 The sorrowful mind began to spend its days eating the root root in the forest of King Rani

 One day the owner of the garden was sitting and listening to the story and taking Dora

 Sampada Devi is angry with us
 rani boli, ” yadi smapda mata sachhee hai to hamaare din phir se laut aaege
 " usee raat ko raja ko swapn aayaa
 One woman is saying i am going, another woman is coming
 raja ke poochne par pehali stri ne apana naam daridrata bataaya or duusari ne apana naam lakshmi bataaya
 The king asked Lakshmi, now she will not go
 lakshmi boli yadi tumhaari patni smapda kaa doraa lekar katha santi rahegi to main nahin jaaongi
 If you break Dora, you will leave
 baag kii malkin kisi rani ke haar dene jaati thi us haar ko damyanti banaati thi
 Rani liked that necklace very much

 Now both of them went towards their palace

 He stayed here with the moneylender and saw that the peacock made on the wall was spewing necklace
 sahukaar ne raja ke pair pakad liye
 On reaching further, reached the sister's house
 raja bahan ke puraane mahal main hi tehra
 When the king dug that place, he got a plate filled with diamonds
 raja ne bahan ko bahut sa dhan bhet swaroop diya
 After reaching the friend's house, he stayed in the same room

 On walking further, his dhoti was found on a tree

 theva 17veen shatabdi main mogul kaal main rajasthan ke rajgharaanon ke sangrakshan main panpi ek bejod hastkala he
 The handicraft art of Theva is related to the manufacture of jewelery made of gold enamel and transparent glass for women
 iske ine gine shilpi-parivaar rajasthan ke keval pratapgarh jile main hi rahete hai
 In the making of theva-jewelery, vials of various colors are put into a frame made of fine filigree, and fine pieces of gold are carved on it, which are made by skilled and skilled hands with the help of small tools
 yah aabhushan-nirmaan kala apni moulikta or kalaatmakataa ke kaaran vishwa kii un ini gini hastkalaon main se ek he - jo antarrashtriya bazaar or vipanan ke abhaav main jaldi vilupt ho sakati hai| The name "theva" originated from the two main processes of making this art, 'tharana' and 'wada'
 is kala main pehle kaanch par sone kii bahut patali work yaa shit lagaakar us par baarik jaali banaai jaati he, jise tharana kaha jaataa he
 In the second stage the frame is made of silver fine wire to tighten the glass, which is called "wada"
 tatpashchaat ise tej aag main tapaaya jaataa he
 As a result, gold artwork and beautiful designs emerge on the glass to become an ornament of a unique and wonderful work
 kaanch par kanchan kaa karishma kahe jane vaali yah shilp kaanch par sunahari painting kii tarah he, jo chitrakaari kii neenv par janm leti he
 The composition of this craft is complex, difficult and laborious, but it is only a matter of these handful of artisans to make the craft painted on gold into glass
 shilp chithran ko 23 karet sone ke pattar par ‘taankal’ naamak ek vishesh kalam se ukera jaataa he or kushaltapurvak bahurangi kaanch par madh diya jaataa he
 When both substances combine with gold and glass become a single organism, then glass is visible in gold and gold in glass
 isi ko theva kala kehete hai
 In order to keep the glass content more effective and better, it has to go through a special process so that the gold work contained in the glass starts to rise and touches the mind of the beholder
 is prakaar shilp kaa prayek namoona paardarshee kaanch kaa ho jaataa he or us par maanik, panna tathaa neelam jaisi prabhaa dikhalaai padati he
 Special glass from Belgium used to be used to carve this art, but due to the unavailability of such glass, different types of glass are now used
 prarambh main theva kaa kaam laal, nile or hare rangon ke moolyawaan pattharon hira, panna aadi par hi hota tha, lekin ab yah kaam pile, gulabi or kaale rang ke kaanch ke ratnon par bhi hone laga he
 Earlier, religious motifs and popular folklore were carved on the boxes, plates, dishes, etc
, made from this art, but now this art is also made in jewelery as well as pendants, ear-rings, ties and pins of cuffs, cufflinks, photoframes etc
 Has become popular

 This distinctive ornamentation tradition of Pratapgadha is mentioned in the "P" subdivision of Encyclopaedia Britannica
 rajasthan kii is bejod aabhushan parampara ke sarkari sangrakshan ke prayaas aaj bhi aparyaapt hai | However, by the Government of India, the Theva Art Institute, Pratapgarh, the representative body of Theva art, has been awarded the Geographical Indication Number under the Geographical Display of Goods Act, 1999 for specialization in the preservation of this unique art
 ullekhneey he ki jeographical indication kisi utpaada ko uski sthaan vishesh main utpatti evam prachlan ke saath vishesh bhugolic gunvattta evam pahchaan ke liye diya jaataa he
 Mahesh Raj Soni, who is honored with the President's Award for Theva Art and a handicraft member of Theva Art Institute, is confident that this art will be able to retain its geographical identity well after getting the Geographical Performance Number

 ‘aarthik adhishesh’ arthshaastra ke kshetra main ek bahut hi suvidhajanak or vyaavhaarik vishay he
 In particular, it falls under the branch of welfare economics
 sansadhano ke ek kushal aavanton praapt karne main uske aavedan ke alaava, yah david ricardo kaa 'aarthik kiraaya siddhant' or karl marks kaa 'adhishesh mulya siddhant' kaa abhinn ang he
 The total value found in society from any activity or transaction is called 'economic surplus'
 is lenden main shaamil logon ko hi laabh nahi miltaa, parantu kabhi-kabhaar ek hi gatividhi se kai logon ko aarthik adhishesh kaa laabh miltaa he
 In other words, the economic surplus is the total sum of 'consumer surplus' and 'producer surplus'
 atah aarthik adhishesh tabhi utapann hoti he jab kisi upabhokta ko chahat se kam daam main kuch cheez milti he yaa kisi utpaadak ko apane maal ke badale main chahat se zyada daam milti he
 While buying something, a consumer is willing to give a set amount, and most of the time he gives another amount
 in dono ke antar ko hi 'upabhokta adhishesh' kahalaaya jaataa he
 To illustrate this definition, an example is presented
 maan lijie ki anil bazaar se ek kitaab khareednaa chahta he, or vah is kitaab ke liye 200 rupee dene ke liye taiyaar he
 On reaching the market, he learns that the actual price of that book is only 150 rupees, and so he happily buys that book
 is udhaaharan main upabhokta 200 rupee dene ke liye taiyaar tha, par use sirf 150 rupee hi dene pada
 Hence, in this example, Anil gets a consumer surplus of Rs 50
 ek maang vakr bazaar main sabhi upabhoktaaon ke kharch karne kii ichha kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Total consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the price
 upabhokta adhishesh par keemat kaa prabhaav bahut sidhaa he
 Two scenarios are possible here: price increases and price decreases
 jab keemat babbti he tab upabhokta adhishesh kam ho jaati he, or jab keemat kam ho jaati he tab upabhokta adhishesh batch jaati he
 Thus there is an inverse relationship between price and consumer surplus
 utpaadak ko diya gaya shodh or utpaadak ke khud kii kharch ke bich ke antar ko 'nirmaataa adhishesh' kaha jaataa he
 Producer surplus arises only when the producer's expected price is lower than the market price
 is paribhaasha ko spasht karne ke liye, ek udhaaharan prastut he
 Suppose that Anil has printed a book by spending 150 rupees
 ab vah us pustak ko bazaar main bechnaa chahta he
 On reaching the market, he learns that the actual price of that book is 200 rupees, and so he happily sells the book
 is udhaaharan main utpaadak kii khud kii kharchaa 150 rupye he, par bazaar ki keemat 200 rupye he
 Hence, in this example, Anil gets a producer surplus of Rs 50
 ek aapurti vakr bazaar main kisi bhi vastu uplabdh karne main prayek utpaadak kii seemaant laagat kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Total producer surplus is the area below the price and above the supply curve
 upabhokta adhishesh kii tarah, utpaadak adhishesh par bhi keemat kaa prabhaav bahut sidhaa he
 Here also two scenarios are possible: an increase in price and a decrease in price
 jab keemat babbti he tab utpaadak adhishesh bhi batch jaati he, or jab keemat kam ho jaati he tab utpaadak adhishesh bhi kam ho jaati he
 Thus there is a direct relationship between price and producer surplus
 upabhokta adhishesh = khariddaaron ke liye mulya - kharidaaron dwaara bhugtan kii gai raashi
 Producer surplus = amount received by producers - cost to producers
