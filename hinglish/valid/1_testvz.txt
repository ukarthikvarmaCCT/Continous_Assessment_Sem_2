 vartmaan samay main uttar pradesh ke mathura nagar sahit vah bhu-bhaag, jo shrikrishna ke janm or unki vividh lilaon se sambadhit he, braj kehalaata he
 Thus, Braj is an additional name for the present Mathura Mandal and the ancient Shursen region and its shortened form
 isamen mathura, vrindavan, govardhan, gokul, mahaban, valdev, nandagaanv, varasanaa, deeg or kambon aadi bhagwaan shrikrishna ke sabhi lila-sthal sammilit hai
 The range of the said Braj has been considered as eighty-four Kos
 surdaas tathaa anya vrajabhasha ke bhakt kaviyon or vaartakaron ne bhagwat puraana ke anukaran par mathura ke nikatavarti vanya pradesh kii gop-basti ko braj kaha he or use sarvatra 'mathura', 'madhupuri' yaa 'madhuban' se pruthak vatalaya he
 The major cities in the Braj region are Mathura, Jalesar, Bharatpur, Agra, Hathras, Dhaulpur, Aligarh, Etawah, Mainpuri, Etah, Kasganj, and Firozabad
 braj shabd sanskrit dhaatu 'vraj' se bana he, jiskaa arth gatishiltaa se he
 The place where cows graze and roam is also called Braj
 amarkosh ke lekhak ne braj ke teen arth prastut kiye hai- goshth, maarg or vrund 
 The word Braj in Hindi is derived from the word Vraj in Sanskrit
 vaidic samhitaon tathaa ramayana, mahabharat aadi sanskrit ke pracheen dharmagranthon main braj shabd goshaala, go-sthaan, gochar bhoomi ke arthon main bhi prayukt hua he
 In the Rigveda, the word is described as a gaushala or a khirak of cows
 yajurveda main gaayon ke charne ke sthaan ko braj or goshaala ko goshth kaha gaya he
 Braj is indicated by the location of the beautiful horned cows in the Shuklayajurveda
 atharvaveda main goshlaon se sambadhit puraa sookt hi prastut he
 In Harivamsa and Bhagavatpuranas, this word is used as Gop Basta
 skandapurana main maharishi shanndilya ne braj shabd kaa arth vthapit vatalate hue ise vyapak brahm kaa rup kaha he
 Therefore, this word is related to the spirituality of Braj
 vedon se lekar puraanon tak main braj kaa sambadh gaayon se varnit kiya gaya he
 Whether it is a farm to tie cows, whether it is cowshed, whether it is a land of land and whether it is a cottage
 bhagwatkaar kii drushti main goshth, gokul or braj samanarthak hai
 Braj has been used in the same sense in the compositions of Surdas based on the Bhagavata
 mathura or uskaa nikatavarti bhu-bhaag pracheen kaal se hi apane saghan wanon, vistrut charaagahon, goshton or sundar gaayon ke liye prasiddh rahaa he
 Although Lord Krishna was born in the city of Mathura, he was sent to the gop-slum across the Yamuna as soon as he was born due to political reasons, he lived in a large Gopalak's house along with Gop, Gopi and go-vrind
 
 us kaal main unke paalak nandadi gop gana apni suraksha or gochar-bhoomi kii suvidha ke liye apane gokul ke saath mathura nikatavarti vistrut van-khandon main ghumaa karte the
 Due to Shri Krishna, the importance of those cow-gopis, cows and trans-lands was increased
 puranic kaal se lekar vaishnav sampradaayon ke aavirbhaav kaal tak jaise-jaise krishnopasna kaa vistaar hota gaya, vaise-vaise shrikrishna ke ukt parikron tathaa unke lila sthalon ke gaurav kii bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 There was an abundance of cow rearing here during this period, due to which Vrajkhandas also became abundant
 isaliye shri krishna ke janm sthaan mathura or unki lilaon se samvadhit mathura ke aas-paas kaa samast pradesh hi braj athwa brajamandal kaha jane laga tha
 In this way the meaning of the word Braj has evolved in chronological order
 vedon or ramayana-mahabharat ke kaal main jahaan iskaa prayog 'goshth'-'go-sthaan' jaise laghu sthal ke liye hota tha
 In the mythological period, some big places like 'gop-basti' started to be done
 us samay tak yah shabd pradeshvai na hokar kshetravayi hi tha
 In the Bhagavata, 'braj' is used in the regional sense only
 vahaan ise ek chote gram kii sangya di gai he
 In it, 'village' smaller than 'pur' and smaller settlement than that is called 'braj'
 16veen shatabdi main 'braj' pradeshvai hokar 'brajamandal' ho gaya or tav uskaa aakaar 84 kos kaa mana jane laga tha
 At that time Mathura city was not considered to be included in 'braj'
 surdaas tathaa anya braj-bhashaa kaviyon ne 'braj' or mathura kaa pruthak rup main hi kathan kiya he, jaise pahile ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 The size of Braj also expanded when the area of braj culture and Brajbhasha expanded due to Krishna worshipers and Brajbhasha poets
 us samay mathura nagar hi nahin, balki usase dur-dur ke bhu-bhaag, jo braj samskruti or braj-bhashaa se prabhavit the, vraj antargat maan liye gayi the
 Present kaal main mathura nagar sahit mathura jile kaa adhikansh bhaag tathaa rajasthan ke deeg or kambon kaa kuch bhaag, jahaan se brajayatra guzarati he, braj kaha jaataa he
 The area of braj culture and Braj language is even more extensive
 ukt samast bhu-bhaag re pracheen naam, madhuban, shurasen, madhura, madhupuri, mathura or mathuramandal the tathaa aadhunik naam braj yaa brajamandal hai
 Although there is a difference in their meanings and sizes from time to time
 is bhu-bhaag kii dharmik, rajnatik, aitihaasik or samskruthik parampara atyant gauravpurn rahi he
 Treasure Island is an audacious novel by Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson, which tells the story of "pirates and buried gold"
 pehali baar 1883 main ek pustak rup main prakashit hua, mulat: yah bacchon kii patrika yang foks main 1881-82 ke bich dharawahik rup se trager island yaa mutini of da hispaniola or chhadmaveshi captain jorge north sheershak se prakashit hua
 Traditionally considered for a futuristic tale, it is an adventurous tale known for its satirical commentary on ambience, character and action and the ambiguity of morality - as seen in Long John Silver - which was then And is still exceptional for children's literature
 yah ab tak ke sabhi upanyaason main sabase adhik naatakeey he
 Treasure Island has great influence in the popular concept of pirates, including treasure maps with the "X" mark, two mast ships, a black-footed spot, tropical islands and a footed sailor with a parrot on the shoulder
 stivension tees saal ke the jab unhone trager island ko likhnaa shuru kiya or upanyaaskaar ke rup main yah unki pehali safalataa ban gayi
 The first fifteen chapters were written in 1881 in Bremer, the mountainous region of Scotland
 vah garmi ke antim dinon main shuru hui barsaat kaa sard din tha or stivension apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke saath cottage main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe the
 Stevenson's step-young son, Lloyd Osbourne, painted a rainy day with watercolor
 Recalling those days, Lloyd wrote: loyad ke liye nakshe kii chitrakaari karne ke teen dinon ke bheetar, stivension ne pehle teen adhyay likh liye, harek ko apane parivaar ke saamne jor-jor se padhaa, jinhone usamen kuch suzav jode
 loyad ne jor diya ki kahani main mahila kaa koi astitv nahin he, kitaab kii shuruyaat main mote taur par apvadswarup gym hockins kii maa ko joda gaya
 Stevenson's father rejoiced in the story as children and spent a day writing about the exact contents of Billy Bones' sea chest, which Stevenson took over; And where Jim Hawkins hides in Sev's punt, it was his father's suggestion
 ek dost, dow elexander jap do hafte baad yang foks patrika ke sampadak ke paas shuruuaati adhyay lekar pahunchaa, sampadak har haftaa ek adhyay prakashit karne par sahamat ho gaye
 Stevenson continued to write for fifteen consecutive days at the rate of one chapter a day, after which health caused a severe famine
 ektis saal kii umr tak unhone kabhi kuch nahin kamaaya tha or ve kitaab khatm karne ko betaab the
 He read the proof, corrected it, took a morning walk alone and read other novels
 sharad kaal main scotland aae, stivension garmi kii chhuttiyon ko chhod waapas landan chale gaye or stivension jivan main lambey samay se bhugat rahe puraani saans kii beemaari se pareshaan the
 Worried by the deadline, he traveled to Davos, Switzerland in October, where he took a break from work and the clear air of the mountain worked wonders, he was able to write novels at the rate of one chapter per day and soon completed the story
 Lee oktober 1882 se janvari 1882 ke dauraan yang foks shuruuaati dinon main trager island kii ore pathakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne yaa yahaan tak ki patrika kii bikri badhaane main naakaam rahaa, lekin 1883 main jab yah kitaab main rup main bika to yah bahut lokapriy hua
 It is said that Prime Minister Gladstone kept reading it till two in the morning until it was over
 It was highly appreciated by critics
 The American novelist Henry James praised it as "the best game played by boys"
 Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote, "I think one page of Stevenson shows far more talent than a chapter in detail by Sir Walter Scott
" " stivension ko dharawahik ke liye 34 pound saat siling or chah pence or kitaab ke liye 100 pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya
 Thanks to Stevenson's letter and essay, we got to know a lot about his sources and inspiration
 The early originator, he said, is a map of the island, which was essentially his entire plot as a writer
 unhone apni pandulipi ke saath nakshaa bhi kitaab ke prakaashak ko bhej diya tha or baad main kaha gaya ki nakshaa kahin kho gaya tha
 They did not have a copy, this made them sad
 stivension ke liye, uktaahat ke saath yaadon or sandarbh ke sahare phir se taiyaar kiya gaya nakshaa asli trager island ke jaisaa nahin tha
 The novel is also drawn from memories of Daniel Defoe, Edgar Allan Poe's "the gold-bug" and Washington Irving's "wolfert Weber", of which Stevenson says, "it is Washington Irving's debt to me that has caused my conscience
" Disciplined and justified, i believe plagiarism rarely leads
 
 mere pehle adhyay kii puri aantarik aatma or saamagree vrutant kaa bada bhaag

 washington irving kii sampatti rahi
" charles kingsle kaa upanyaas at last bhi ek pramukh prerana rahaa
 Long John Silver's character was inspired by his real-life friend, writer-editor William Ernest Henley, who lost his lower leg bones from tuberculosis
 loyad osborn ne unka varnan is prakaar kiya "

ek mahaan, utsaahi, ek badi dadhi or ek baisakhi ke saath chaude kandhon vaala vyakti; hasmukh, ascharyajanak rup se chaalaak or ek ansi hansi ke saath mano koi sangeet baj rahaa ho; uname ek acolpaneey aag or jivan shakti thi; ve kisi ko bhi ek paanv par ghumaa dete"
 trager island ke prakaashan ke baad henley ko bheje ek patr main stivension ne likhaa tha "ab main ek sweekaarokti karnaa chahunga
 yah tumhaari aapng shakti or abhimaan kii drushti thi jisane long jon silver ko janm diya


 aapng vyakti kii kalpana, vichaar or dhwani dwaara bhayavahata, yah sab kuch puri tarah se tumse liye gayi
 " stivension kaa kabhi bhi asli samudri daakuon se saamana nahin hua tha: unke janm se ek sadi se bhi adhik pehle "samudri daakuon kaa swarna kaal" samaapt ho chukaa tha
 However, his descriptions of sailing and sailors and marine life are very reliable
 unke pita or dada donon hi prakashastambh ke ejeeniyar the or aksar hi prakashastambhon ke nirikshan ke silsile main scotland ke aasapaas samudri yatra kiya karte the, tab apane saath tarun robert ko bhi le liya karte
 trager island likhane se do saal pehle unhone atlantic mahaasaagar ko paar kiya tha
 His descriptions were so authentic that in 1890 William Butler Yiats told Stevenson that Treasure Island was the only book that brought any joy to his seafaring grandfather
 "samudri daakuon ke bare main hamaari dharna par trager island ke prabhaav ko adhimulyankan nahin kaha ja saktaa
 stivension ne nakshon, kaale mastulon, ushnkaribandheey dwipon or apane kadhon par toton ke saath ek taang vaale navik ke saath samudri daakuon ko hameshaa ke liye jod diya
 gade khajaane ke sthaan par khajaane ke nakshe ke saath x kaa nishaan samudri daaku kahani kii ek bahut hi parichit saamagree he", phir bhi yah puri tarah se ek kaalpanik avishkaar he jo apane mul ke liye stivension ke moulik naqshe kaa abhaari he
 The term "treasure Island" became incorporated into the common language as an idiom and was used for sports, rides, places, etc
 upanyaas 6 bhaagon or 34 adhyyon main banta hua he: doctor livse dwaara varnit 16-18 adhyay ko chhod kar gym hockins ne baaki sabakaa aakhyaan kiya he
 The novel begins in the mid-18th century from a seaside village in southwest England
 kathavachak gym hockins admiral benbo sarai ke maalik kaa jawan betaa he
 Billy Bones, an old alcoholic, is a long-term bassist at the inn, who has only paid for the first week of his stay
 gym jald hi jaan jaataa he ki bons guptavas main he or vah vishesh rup se ek pair ke ek agyaat samudr yatri se milane se darataa he
 a few months later, a mysterious sailor named Black Dog arrives to meet Bones
 unki mulaaqaat hinsak ho jaati he, blike dog bhaag jaataa he or bons ko ek daura aata he
 As Jim begins to take care of him, Bones confesses that he was once the companion of the infamous pirate Captain Flint and now his old companions want Bones' sea chest
 kuch samay baad, bons kaa ek doosraa saathi puv sarai main aata he or bons tak le jane ke liye gym par dabaav daalata he
 Pew gives a paper to Bones
 puv ke jane ke baad, bons kagaz ko kholkar ek kaala dhabba dekhtaa he, jo ki samudri daaku kaa samman he, jisamen yah chetavanee he ki uske paas das baje tak kaa samay he or vah usee sthaan par mirgee se girakar mar gaya
 Jim and his mother open Bones 'sea chest to retrieve Bones' room and his food, but by the time they can finish counting their dues, he hears the bandits coming to the inn and letting them escape and hide
 Forced, but Jim took out a mysterious waxama packet from the box
 puv ke netritv main daakuon ko sandook or paise mil gayi, magar sandook main "flint kaa ghunsa" na hone se ve niraash hue
 rajasav agenton ke aa jane se samudri daaku apane jahaaj par bhaag jate hai, sirf andhe puv ko chhodkar, jo galati se agenton ke ghodon ke neeche aakar maaraa jaataa he
 Jim goes to Dr
 Livesay carrying the mysterious waxama packet, as he is a "gentleman and a magistrate"; And he examines Squire Trelawney and Jim Hawkins together
 unhen captain flint ke karier ke dauraan lute gayi khajaane se sambandhit ek log-book miltaa he, saath hi ek dweep kaa ek vistrut nakshaa bhi miltaa he, jisamen flint ke khajaane ke gupt bhandar ke sthaan ko chihnit kiya gaya he
 Square Trelawny immediately plans a ship trip to find the treasure with the help of Dr
 Livesey and Jim
 livse trelavni ko apane lakshya ke bare main chup rahane kii chetavanee detaa he
 Bristol buys Trelawny Hispaniola, a ship with a mast, captures Captain Smollett to run it, and Long John Silver, the owner of a brewery called "the spy-glass" for the kitchen
 silver chaalak dal ke baaki sadasyon ko kiraaye par lene main trelavni kii madad karata he
 When Jim comes to Bristol and goes to the Spy Glass bar to meet Silver, he immediately suspects: Silver doesn't have a leg, the kind of person Bones warned about, and the Black Dog sits in the bar 
 gym par najar padate hi blike dog bhaag khadaa hota he or silver bhagode ke bare main kuch bhi jaankaree hone se itane vishwasaneey dhang se inkaar karata he ki vah gym kaa bharosa jeet letaa he
 Despite Captain Smollett's misgivings about the expedition and Silver's chosen crew, Hispaniola travels to the Caribbean Sea
 jab ve apane gantavy ke nikat pahunchane ko hote hai, tab gym kuch seb lene ke liye dhire-dhire jahaaj ke seb bairal kii ore jaataa he
 While he is inside, he hears Silver whispering to some crew members
 silver kabool karata he ki vah captain flint kaa rasad adhikari tha or chaalak dal ke kai sadsy bhi kabhi flint ke aadmi hua karte the; or vah apane paksh ko majboot karne ke liye or adhik sadasyon kii bhartee kar rahaa he
 After Flint's treasury is recovered, Silver intends to assassinate Hispaniola's officers and capture the spoils for himself and his men
 jab samudri daaku apane shayansthaan ko jate hai tab gym smolat or livse ko asann vidroh kii chetavanee detaa he
 When they arrive at Treasure Island, most of Silver's men immediately go ashore
 haalanki gym ko tab tak maaloom nahin tha, lekin khajaane ke jahaaj par ladane se pehle kisi khule vidroh yaa hinsa ko sthagit rakhane kii silver kii adhik saavdhaan yojana ko tyagkar silver ke aadmi gym ko kaala dhabba dete hai or khajaane par turant kabja jamaane kii maang karte hai
 Jim gets off the ship with Silver's men, but runs away from them as they arrive on shore
 jangal main chhupakar gym dekhtaa he ki silver smolat ke ek vafaadaar sadsy tom kii hatya kar rahaa he
 Running away to save his life, he encounters another former Flint partner, Ben Gunn, who has been alone on the island for the last three years, but he gets along well with Jim, hoping that He will get a chance to return to a decent life
 is bich, trelavni ne livse or unke logon ne aashcharya main daalate hue hispaniola main bache hue kuch samudri daakuon ko apane vash main kar liya
 They reached the shore by boat and went to an abandoned, fortified enclosure on the island, where Jim Hawkins soon arrived, who had overtaken Ben Gunn
 silver sangharsh viraam ke ek jhande ke jariye smolat ke aatmasamarpan ke liye samjhauta karne kii koshish karata he; smolat bilkul do took jawaab detaa he, tab silver gusse se agbabula hokar baade par hamalaa karne kii chetavanee detaa he
 He threatened, "death would be lucky for them" before attacking
 The pirates attacked the enclosure, but in the fierce battle they left from both sides after losses
 raat main, gym chupake se baade se baahar aayaa, usne ben gun kii charmaavritt nauka lee or andhere main hispaniola ja pahunchaa
 He cut off the towing of the ship's anchor, left it undisturbed and removed it from the reach of the bandits on the shore
 At dawn, he again approached the ship and was able to climb on it
 jahaaj par bache do daakuon main se ab tak sirf ek hi jivit bachaa tha: karnadhaar, israel hands, jisane nashe main hue ek jhagade main apane saathi kii hatya kar di thi or is jhamele main vah khud bhi buree tarah se ghayal ho gaya tha
 Hands agreed to help the ship land a safe shore in exchange for treatment and brandy, but Hands tried to kill Jim as soon as the ship reached shore
 Jim escaped by climbing the ship's rope, and when Hands threw the skewer and tried to break it, Jim was bound and shot Hands
 hispaniola ko surakshit rup se kinare lagane ke baad raat ke andhkaar main gym peeche kii ore se baade main ja pahunchaa
 Due to the darkness, he did not know for a long time that the bandits were now occupied by the bandits and he easily got caught
 hameshaa se kamjor rahaa silver kaa netritv tab or adhik kamjor ho gaya, jab uske saathi bandhak gym ko maar daalane yaa jaankaree paane ke liye use yatnaa dene kii maang karne lage
 Silver's rivals in the pirate team led by George Meri again stained Silver and tried to remove him from the captaincy
 Silver responds to them with his eloquence, blinks them for distorting a biblical page to make a black spot, and tells them that he has a map of the treasure he got from Dr
 Livesey, thus rekindling the team's faith
 Acquired
 agle din, samudri daaku khajaane kii khoj par nikal pade
 ben gun unka peechha karne laga, unhen aage badhane se rokane ke liye vah bhutiya aawaaj nikaalane laga, lekin silver aage badhata gaya or usne vah sthaan khoj nikaala jahaan flint kaa khajaana gada hua tha
 The pirates find that the reserves have been looted and all the treasure has been gone
 cruddh daaku silver or gym kii ore mudate hai, lekin ben gann, dow livse or abraham grey unhen aashcharya main daalate hue hamalaa bol dete hai, unamem se do ko maar giraaya jaataa he or baaqi bhaag jate hai
 Silver surrenders to Dr
 Livesay and promises to return to his work
 ve ben gun ke gupha ghar main jate hai, jahaan gann ne kuch maheenon se khajaane ko chipa rakhaa tha
 The treasure is divided between Trelawny and his loyal men, including Jim and Ben Gann, and they go back to England, leaving the surviving bandits alone in that deserted island
 bhayanak ben gun kii madad se or khajaane ke ek chote se hisse ke saath silver bhaag jaataa he
 Remembering Silver, Jim says that "I can say that he met his old Negro and might still be living with him and Captain Flint
" The chances of her living comfortably are slim
 " Treasure Island contains numerous references to fictitious past events, which unfold slowly throughout the story and create a prequel that throws light on the events of the main plot
 purvakatha kaa bada bhaag jaldasyu captain je
 flint se sambandhit he, "khun kaa pyaasa jaldasyu jo kabhi tha", jo kabhi bhi dikhaai nahin diya, vah mukhya kahani ke shuru hone ke pehle hi mar gaya
 Flint was the captain of the walrus with a long career, working mainly along the coasts of the West Indies and South American colonies
 mukhya kahani main dikhaayi dene vaale uske dal ke sadasyon main nimnlikhit charitra bhi shaamil hai: flint kaa pehla saathi wiliam bons; uskaa rasad adhikari jon silver; uskaa bandukchi israel hands; or uske anya navikon main shaamil hai: jorge meri, tom morgan, puv, "blike dog" or allaradas 
 flint ke dal ke or bhi anek sadsy hispaniola samudri yatra main shaamil the, lekin hameshaa unki pahchaan karnaa sambhav nahin tha ki koun flint kaa aadmi tha or koun baad main vidroh main shaamil hone ko raji hua - jaise ki jahaaj kaa ek adhikari job anderson or vidrohi "jon", jo ki khajaane ke bhandar kii talaashi main maare gayi
 Flint and his team were successful, ruthless, intimidating, and rich too, if they could keep the stolen money in their hands
 Through his robbery, Flint had amassed a large treasury worth £ 7000,000 as a repository of gold, silver bricks and weapons - but the treasure was buried in a remote Caribbean island
 flint ne apane chah navikon ke saath is khajaane ko walrus se tat par laayaa tha or suraksha kii drushti se usne ek baadaa bhi banaaya tha
 When he buryed it, Flint came back alone to the walrus - killing all six other people
 He kept a map of the treasure's location with him till he died

 Prominent heroes include Jim Hawkins, Dr
 Livesay and Captain Smollett standing with virtues such as loyalty, truthfulness, frugality, discipline, religious belief, and restraint
 samudri daaku matvaalepan, apavitrataa or aapasi vishwasghaat se grast hai or jivan ko chota or anishchit bataakar tatkaal tripti praapt karne kii pravriti se peedit hai
 Long John Silver is the centrist in this duality: he possesses the virtues of heroic restraint, frugality, and delayed satiety, but it is all just to achieve his goal, to lie in that goal, he also lies, betrays And taxes till murder
 adhikansh daaku long jon ke str ko hasil nahin kar sakate, jo use unki toli main ek prakritik laabh detaa he
 The novel can be seen as Bildungsroman, which ties in with the development and growing age of its narrator Jim Hawkins
 gym kaa naitik vikaas tab paraakaashtha par pahunch jaataa he jab vah silver se na bhaagane kaa vaada karata he or phir baade ke paas dow livse se miltaa he
 Jim was afraid that upon being tortured, he might reveal the address of Hispaniola, so he tells Livsey about the ship so that the doctors can take him elsewhere before the bandits reach him
 Seeing the possibility of torture on a young man, Livesey tells Jim to run away with him
 gym inkaar karte hue kahata he "maine jabaan di he", yah vyaktigat jokhim hone ke baavjood nayakon kii satyavadita kii niti kaa paalan he
 Taking Jim's morality over himself, Livsey says: "I take it on my shoulder, take all the blame and shame in one breath, my child
" " gym is nirbharta se bhi inkaar karata he, livse or apane saathiyon kii tarah ek swatantra vayask kii tarah vah kahata he: "nahin, meraa jawaab he, aap acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki aap khud aisa nahin karte- or na hi squaire yaa captain hi aisa karte or main bhi aisa nahin karuunga
" Many other heroes have also been remarkably firm, especially Dr
 Livesay, who was also faithful to his Hippocratic oath, keeping his promise to help the sick, even capturing Billy Bones and the farm
 Do not ignore the bandits
 mukhya rup se vafadari or sachai kii kami ke kaaran long jon silver nayakon se alag ho jaataa he, anyathaa usamen un jaise anek mulya hai
 Silver is not only an old liar, but he lies with great precision and credibility
 vah itani vishwasaneeyata ke saath blike dog ko nahin jaanane kaa daawa karata he ki gym hockins maan jaataa he ki "main long jon silver kii begunaahi kii jamaanat duungaa
" captain england or flint ke maatahat apane karier ke bare main apane vidrohi saathiyon ko bataayi gayi uski kahaniyaan bhi sambhawatah aanshik rup se kaalpanik hai 
 jab gym hockins uske kabje main aa jaataa he, tab silver badi aasaani se apane dal ko tyaag dene or captain billy ke maatahat kaam karne ko taiyaar ho jaataa he, badale main vah apni jaan baksh dene ke liye gym kii madad chahta he
 After that, when he is convinced that Flint's treasure is within his reach, Silver plans to disobey his promise, kill Jim, and capture Hispaniola for himself
 ant main, jab use pataa chalata he ki khajaana gaayab ho chukaa he, tab vah phir se apana paksh badalata he or apane dal ke saath dhokhaa karata he
 Silver, in his final move, escapes from captivity with Ashrafi's bag and disappears
 daakuon kii sharabkhori or nayakon, khaskar dow livse ke sanyam ke bich ek shashakt tulana kii gayi he
 Alcohol destroys many villains in Treasure Island
 captain flint atyadhik ram pine se mar jaataa he
 Dr
 Livesay forbade Billy Bones from drinking alcohol after the first stroke; But Bones ignores this warning and dies sick again
 sharabkhori ke kaaran israel hands or o'bryan ke bich ghaatak ladaai hoti he, jisase hispaniola par phir se kabja karne main gym hockins ko madad milti he
 It is strongly implied that the drunken state of the pirates on the island leads to reduced vigilance, enabling Ben Gann to kill some of them sleeping
 khud silver ne israel hands ko bahut adhik sharaab pine ke nateezon ke bare main bahut kadi chetavanee di thi: "lekin jab tak pie hue ho tum kabhi bhi khush nahin ho sakate
 meri ore aa jaao, tum jaison ke saath jalayatra karne ke maamle main meraa ji michalaata he! 


 kal tum ram se apana pet bharna or jaakar kahin latak janaa
" The conflict between Jim Hawkins and Israel Hands over Hispanola is primarily a struggle of piety versus wrongdoing
 hands jaanaleva beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaata he or gym usase kahata he ki agar vah mrityu ke kareeb he to use ek isai kii tarah prarthana kerani chahie
 When Hands asks him why, Jim excitedly replies, "for God's mercy, Mr

" Hands replies at unusual lengths, "I have never seen goodness come from God so far
 uske bare main sabase pehle jo baat aati he vah meri kalpana hai; mrit vyakti kaata nahin karte; unke bare main mere vichaar hai-amin, aisa hi he
 "also, there was a difference in Jim's confidence from Hands' distrust of life posthumously
 hands ne jis daaku or vidrohi ko maar daalaa tha, us o'bryan ke bare main charchaa karte hue gym ne kaha, "tum kisi ke sharir ko to maar sakate ho, mi
 hands, lekin aatma ko nahin; tumhen pataa hona chahie

 " dharmik sangharsh main silver kaa sthaan aspasht he
 On perverting a Bible, he warns his companions of the terrible consequences, saying that the dick that has distorted the Bible will continue to haunt bad luck throughout its life
 However, he said this in the context that his men were removing him from the post of captain and that his religious intimidation might be a tactic to intimidate his opponents
 bible kii ghatana ke alaava, silver ne dharm kii ore koi spasht jhukaav nahin darshaya
 silver ke kai aadamiyon ne bible ko vikrut karne ke kalank ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya, isse yah sanket miltaa he ki unamem dharmik bhavanaaen thim or unke apane bhay the
 But for Silver and his men, inflicting physical harm to the Bible is far more frightening than the idea of violating Biblical precepts, suggesting their approach to religion to be far more sacramental than spiritual
 mitvyayita banaam apavyayita kaa sangharsh pustak ke adhikansh bhaag main chalata rahata he
 Most pirates are unable to handle their money; Silver added to the pew, stating "he spent twelve hundred pounds a year, as if he was Lord of Parliament
 Where is he now? Well, he is now dead and in the grave, but two years before that, annihilated
" Ho! That man was dying of hunger
 usne bheekh maangi or chori kii or galaa tak kaata or us par bhi bhookha rahaa, shaktiyon dwaara!" ben gann ne puv kii adoordarshita ko bhi peeche chhod diya; use flint ke khajaane se ek hajaar pound diya gaya tha, usne unhen sirf nabbe dinon main kharch kar diya or jue main uda diya
 According to Silver, these two are completely symbolic of pirates: "when there is a sea voyage, why, they have hundreds of pounds in their pockets instead of hundreds of pots
" unamem se zyaadaatar ram or rangareli main chalaa jaataa he or phir se unhen samudr main janaa padataa he
 "silver himself, again, adheres to austerity qualities
 billy bons apane sarai maalik ko bhugtan nahin karne ke saral upaay ke jariye apane paise bachaaya karata he
 The protagonists have been predominantly frugal: Jim Hawkins 'mother would be willing to risk the bandits instead of giving up Bones' debt, Captain Smollett used his share of the treasure to retire from the sea, and loyal crew member Gray The owner's partner saved a lot of money to become an officer and he also raised a family of his own
 bahut saare aise dweep hai, jo trager island ke liye vaastavik jivan kii prerana ho sakate hai
 a sailor uncle told a story to young Stevenson during a visit to Norman Island, located on British Virgin Island, thus becoming an indirect inspiration for the book Norman Island
 virgin island ken norman island ke aasapaas ded mans chest island he, jo stivension ko charles kingsle kii ek kitaab main mila tha
 Stevenson stated that "treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At List: a Christmas in the West Indies; where i found 'dead Man's Chest' - that was the seed"
 For Scalton Island, if it was "seed", the meaning of the phrase "dead Man's Chest" in general or by all means remains unclear in the novel
 anya daavedaaron main edinburgh main queen street garden main chote dweep hai, kyonki "robert lui stivension heriet ro main rahete the or yah samajha jaataa he ki queen street garden main apane shanayakaksh kii khidki se unhen ve talab dikhaa ho saktaa he, jo trager island ke liye prerana bana"
 There are a lot of innkeepers that claim inspiration for the places given in the book
 bristol main, landoger tro admiral bembo ke liye prerana hone kaa daawa karata he; jabaki hole in da wal spai glass tavern hone kaa daawa karata he
 The Pirates' home in Savannah, Georgia, says Captain Flint's last few days were here, and his ghost seeks property here
 1883 main stivension ne da silverado scwater ko bhi prakashit kiya tha, jo ki 1880 main california ke napa vaili main unke honeymoon yatra kii kahani he
 His experiences in Silverado are housed in a magazine called Silverado Sketches and he has a lot of comments on the scene around him in Napa Valley that provides a lot of descriptive description to Treasure Island
 may 1888 main stivension ne new jersey, briley main manasquan nadi ke paas lagbhag ek maheenaa bitaayaa
 nadi par ek chota-sa junglee dweep he, tab yah aam taur par "osborn island" ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 One day Stevenson visited the island and, very impressed by this, he unexpectedly named it Treasure Island and the foundation of his novel began to take shape
 isamen paanch saal kaa samay laga, uske baad unhone upanyaas ko puraa kiya
 Until now, many people mention the island as such
 jis parivaar ne boro ko ise daan main diya, unke sammaan me is dweep kaa naam ab aadhikarik taur par nienstedt island he
 The island map is very similar to the island of Anst in Shetland
 anst island website kaa daawa he ki anst kii yatra ke baad stivension ne trager island likhaa
 Intentionally leaving Stevenson unclear on the exact date of the novel, Hawkins writes that "in any one year of 17--" he picks up his pen
 haalanki, kuch karrwai ko tarikhon ke saath joda ja saktaa he, phir bhi yah spasht nahin he ki stivension ke man main koi ek sateek kalkram tha yaa nahin
 The first dates back to 1745, as both - the work of Dr
 Livsey in Fontenoy and Billy Bones's wooded furrow - establish the date
 admiral hoque ek bahut hi parichit naam he, jab hoque cap finystere ke yuddh main naam kamaate hai, iskaa arth 1747 kii tulana main koi baad kii taarikh hai or admiral pad par padonnat hote hai, lekin yah sab 1781 main hoque kii mrityu se pehle hota he
 There is another indication, though unclear; He dates the letter in Chapter VII by Bristol to the Square Trelawnyers, where he alludes to his desire to get enough sailors to deal with the original local inhabitants, the pirates or the disgusted French
 is abhivyakti se pataa chalata he ki us samay great britain kaa france se yuddh chal rahaa tha; udaahranarth, 1740 se 1748 tak austrian uttaradhikaar ko lekar hue yuddh ke dauraan yaa 1756 se 1763 tak seven ears waar kaa
 Stevenson's map of Treasure Island has the following interpretations, Treasure Island 1 August 1759 J
C
 F
 And the above J
 F
 Twenty July 1754 WB is given by MR W
 Bones Maste of YE Walrus Savannah
 Of these two dates, the first is likely to be the date the treasure left the island of Flint; The second date preceded the death of Finnint
 jaise ki vishwasaneey dhang se kaha gaya he ki upanyaas kii ghatana se kam se kam teen saal pehle flint kii mrityu ho gayi thi, yah 1757 se pehle nahin ho saktaa tha or aaj bhi yah nakshe ke anuroop he
 That is why it seems that the events of Treasure Island are not earlier than 1757
 At the end of the story, as soon as a British warship is found in a port in Spanish America, at the same time, the schooner Hispanola peacefully anchors there
 But it must have happened before 1762, when Spain joined the Seven Years War against Great Britain
 isliye uparokt pramaan 1757 or 1762 kii taarikh bataata he
 This sequence of dates, however, contradicts Long John Silver's own account given to Dick, which Jim Hawkins listened to while he was at the Apple Barrel
 daawa kiya gaya he ki silver pachaas saal kaa he, iskaa matlab uskaa janm 1707 se pehle kaa nahin hoga; or donon hi silver tathaa israel hands, jo saath main flint ke dal main hua karte the, bataaya jaataa he ki unhen trager island main pahunchane ke tees saal pehle yani lagbhag 1727 main; samudri kaa anubhav tha
 However, Silver claims that he first embarked on a voyage "with England and then with Flint", at any time before the date of Captain Edward England's death in 1720, this forced him to embark on his career
 , Meaning thirty years is a very long career at sea
 silver yah bhi kahata he ki sarjan, jisane uske pair ko kaat daalaa tha, ko roberts ke dal ke saath corso kaisel main faansee par chadha diya gaya tha: iskaa matlab yah ki vah kam se kam 1722 se viklang rahaa hoga, uski umr tab 15 saal se adhik nahin hogi, yah umr captain flint ke maatahat ek rasad adhikari jaise mahatvapurn pad ke liye yogya he, yaa england ke maatahat ek dal sadsy banane ke laayak bhi nahin he jo ki bahut varisht tha or lambe samay tak kaam kiya, taaki "nau sau surakshit rakh" sake
 As it is mentioned in real history, Silver claims to some people and events that at the same time the opposing side of Africa had been witness to it and that the names and places of Silver's actions are not entirely accurate
 tab to admiral hoque ke liye kaam karte hue uske pairon ke jakhmi hone ke uske daawey kii tulana main ho saktaa he silver kii kahaniyaan or uski visangatiyaan bahut adhik vishwast na ho, uske shrota jis par dhyaan dene main bahut hi anbhigya rahe
 Silver would certainly be closer to sixty than fifty, or else his stories of pirates like England and Roberts have been concocted, heard and heard from other pirates and included himself in them - that's Will cause his discrepancies

 The important function of a manager is to take decisions
 peter drukar kaa is sambandh main yah vichaar he ki prabandhak jo kuch bhi karata he, nirnyon ke dwaara hi karata he
 We know that administrators have to do many tasks day to day and they have many options to do these tasks, the 'best' decision is to decide which of these options is the best option
 terry ne is sambandh main kaha he ki 'prashaskon kaa jivan hi nirnay lenaa he
 In Terry's words, if the administrator has a universal identity, it is for him to decide
 prashaasak ko apane nirnay prabandh ke kaaryon–niojit sanghathan, nirdesan, niyantran aadi ke antargat hi lene padate hai
 In other words, we can say that decision making is ubiquitous in the management process
 simon kaa yah vichaar ki nirnay lenaa hi prashasan he, bahu t uchit prathit hota he
 Whether or not we agree in Simon's words, it is an undeniable truth that decision is the heart of administration
 prashasan main nirnay nishchit prakriya ke parinaam hote hai
 The decision process has three characteristics - chunki nirnay karnaa ek prakriya he or vah ek samay par hota he isliye apane chaaron or kaa parivesh or saath–saath ghatane vaali ghatnaayen parinaam ko prabhavit karegi hi
 The literal meaning of nirvayana is that of reaching the final result, while in practical terms it means reaching the conclusion

 According to Makefarland, decision making is an action of selection, under which an executive reaches a decision in the given circumstances of what should be done
 nirnay kisi vyavhaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jiskaa chayan anek sambhav vikalpon main se kiya jaataa he
 GLS According to Shackle, decision making is that focal point of creative mental activity, where knowledge, thought, emotion and imagination are a combination of tasks to accomplish

 In Lundvarg's words, administrative decision is a process in which an individual makes a decision to influence the behavior of other persons in the organization, so that those individuals can contribute to achieve the goals of the organization
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki nirnayan se aashay nirdhaarit lakshya kii prapti ke liye uplabdh vikalpon main se sarvshereshth vikalp kaa chayan karne se he
 Work is done in a particular situation, it is decided by the decision-makers
 nirnay karte samay prashaasak ke saamne ek se adhik vikalp hote hai
 Decision making is the conscious choice among many available options
 nirnay praaia: niti, niyam, aadesh athwa nirdesh ke rup main vyakt hote hai
 Therefore, in general, decisions are quite complex and difficult, but there are also many decisions in which discussions are more important

 ye uddeshy is prakaar ke ho ki vyaktigat tathaa sansthagat uddeshyon main samanvay sthapit ho sake
 In this regard, Chester I
 Bernard says that before explaining the problem, any critical element must be known because the critical element is the center of decision
 yah vah bindu he jahaan par chunaav kiya jaataa he
 According to Hans and Messi, the critical element in the interpretation of the problem is dominant
 kai adhikari to yahaan tak kehete hai ki samasya kii vyakhya karnaa uske samaadhaan se bhi adhik kathin he
 Hence the problem should be interpreted carefully
 samasya kii spasht vyakhya tathaa paribhaasha ke baad nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan samasya kaa vishle shan karnaa he
 If the problem is large, it is divided into several parts and each part of it is analyzed
 vishleshan ke liye sambandhit tathyon ko ekatrit kiya janaa chahie
 After clearly explaining and analyzing the problem, the decision maker develops various alternative solutions based on various information and facts
 vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karnaa nirnayan prakriya kaa ek mahatvapurn charan hai
 Therefore, administrators should have the ability to develop alternative solutions
 vibhinn vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karne ke baad in vikalpon kaa nirnay karne kii drushti se moolyankan karnaa hi nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan he
 These options should be evaluated keeping the following in mind: vibhinn vikalpon kaa moolyankan karne ke baad nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan un vikalpon main se kisi ek sarvshereshth vikalp kaa chunaav karnaa he
 Administrator's experience, research and analysis, etc
 may be the basis for the choice of options
 antim nirnay lene se purv prashaasak kai baton se prabhavit hota he
 His experience is important in this
 nirnyon ko lene main prashaskon ke dai nik anubhav mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karte hai
 But always and decisions cannot be taken only on the basis of experience
 iske liye prashaskon ko chahie ki ve sanghathanon dwaara nirnyon ke prabhaavon kii vaastaviktaa tathaa kalpit paristhitiyon kii jaanch karen
 Research and analysis methods of selection are also considered to be highly effective methods
 jab kisi samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye koi nirnay le liya jaataa he, to aglaa charan usko kaaryrup pradaan karnaa he
 Administrators should make such efforts that the chosen procedure can be implemented smoothly
 nirnay ko jin logon par lagu kiya ja rahaa he, unki sahmati bhi us nirnay ke sambandh main lee jaani chahie
 When a decision is made functional, the administrator should evaluate the effects of that decision and collect all the necessary information regarding them
 saath hi saath prashaasak ko chahie ki vah kriyaaon par bhi niyantran sthapit kare jo ki nirnay ko kaary rup pradaan karne ke liye kii ja rahi he
 All the above levels of decision process can be called the levels of an ideal decision process, the above levels let us know what actions can be taken to decide

 In computing, there are many different definitions of service oriented architecture, some of which are publicly discussed
 SOA siddhanton ke ek samucchy yaa asi niyantrak avadharanaon ko uplabdh karaane kaa ek prayaas he jinka upyog system ke vikaas or ekikaran kii pravasthaaon ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 Service orientation requires a loose combination of services in the operating system and other technologies that fall under the applications
 SOA kaaryon ko vibhedit ikaayiyon, yaa sevaaon main alag karata he, jise vikasakarta ek network main uplabdh karata he, taaki upyogkarta unhen anuprayogon ke utpaadan main sanyojit or punah upyog kar sake
 ek seva se duusari seva ko data ko paas karke yaa do yaa adhik sevaaon ke bich ek gatividhi ke samanvay ke dwaara ye sevaayen ek duusare ke saath sanchaar karti hai
 SOA can be envisaged as a type of continuum, as opposed to distributed computing or modular programming
 SOA kaa karyanvayan software sevaaon ke jaal par nirbhar karata he
 Services include unrelated, loosely coupled units of functionality that do not have calls embedded in each other
 Each service executes an action, such as filling out an online application for an account, or viewing an online bank statement, or booking online or ordering an airline ticket
 Instead of services consisting of calls to each other in their source code, they use defined protocols, which use metadata descriptions, to illustrate how services pass and parse messages
 SOA vikasakarta arcaustration kaa upyog karke vyaktigat SOA objects kaa sahyog karte hai
 In the process of orchestration, the developer relates the functionality of the software in a non-hierarchical setting
 iske liye vah ek aise software tul kaa upyog karata he jisamen sabhi uplabdh sevaaon kii ek puri soochi, unki visheshtaayen shaamil hoti he or saath hi in sroton ko upyog karne ke anuprayog ke nirmaan ke saadhan bhi shaamil hote hai
 All this requires metadata with sufficient detail to be embedded and activated, which not only describes the symbolic properties of these services, but also the data that drives them
 programmers ne us data kii saranchana ke liye SOA main XML kaa vyapak upyog kiya he, jise ve lagbhag ek vistrut varnan-container main rakhte hai
 Accordingly, the Web services description language typically describes the services themselves, while the SOAP protocol describes the transmission protocol
 kya ye vivaran bhashaaen job ke liye sabase shreshth vikalp hai or kya ye bhavishya main pasandida banegeen / bani rahengi, is par saarvajanik charchaa bani hui hai
 As of 2008, SOA relies on data and services described by metadata, which must meet the following two criteria: lagbhag puri tarah se maujuuda software sevaaon se banaae jate tadarth anuprayogon banane ke liye, kriyasheeltaa ke kaaphi bade hisse ko ek saath shrunkhlaa main rakhane ke liye vaparashakartaaon ko samarth bananaa - yah SOA kaa uddeshy he
 The larger these parts are, the lower the interface points required to implement a set of functionality; However, large portions of functionality may not prove to be granular enough for easy reuse
 Each interface brings with it some portion of the processing overhead, so performance is considered in the choice of granularity of services
 SOA kii vikaas sambhaavnaaen suchit karti hai ki n-th anuprayog ke nirmaan kii seemaant laagat kam he, kyon ki aavashyak sabhiin software, anya anuprayogon kii aavashyaktaa ko santusht karne ke hetu, pehle se maujuud hote hai
 Ideally, now only orchestration is required to build a new application
 ise operate karne ke liye, hisson ke bheetar yaa nirdisht hisson ke bich koi parsparik kriya maujuud nahin honi chahie
 iske bajaay, manushya saapeksh tadarth tareeke main nav apratyaashit aavashyaktaaon se prerit ho kar, sevaaon kii antahkriya ko nirdisht karte hai
 Thus services are needed more as large units of functionality than traditional functions or classes, otherwise the sheer complexity of thousands of such granular objects overwhelms the application designer
 programmers java, C, C++, c # yaa COBOL jaisi paaramparik bhashaaon kaa upyog karke khud sevaaon kaa vikaas karte hai
 Loose concatenation is a feature of SOA services, as opposed to actions that bind linkers together to form an executable, dynamically linked library, or an assembly
 SOA sevaayen "surakshit" aavaran or memory ke aavanton evam sudhaar kaa prabandhan karanevaali, tadarth or jutane main deree ko anumati denevaali or kuch ansh tak madhyasth data typing uplabdh karaati anya programing bhashaaon main bhi chalati hai
 In 2008, a large number of third-party software companies began offering software services for a fee
 In the future, SOA systems are expected to include third-party services that will be combined with other services built in-house
 It has the ability to spread costs for multiple customers and customer uses and promotes standardization both within and between industries
 vishesh rup se, ab yatra udyog main sevaaon or data donon ke purna rup se paribhaashit or dastavejikrut samucchy uplabdh hai, jo of-da-shelf software sevaaon kaa upyog karte hue, kisi bhi sakasham software engeenior ko travel agency software ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt hai
 Other industries, such as the finance industry, have also started making significant progress in this direction
 ek architekchar ke rup main SOA apane mul dizin-tatva ke rup main sarvice orientation par nirbhar karata he
 If the service offers a simple interface that excludes the complexity inherent in it, then users can use independent services without knowledge of the platform's implementation of the service
 SOA ese interphes ke jariye apni kaaryakshmata ko darshane vaali sevaaon par nirbhar karata he jo anya anuprayog or sevaayen pard kar in sevaaon kaa upyog kaise kiya jaye vah samaj sakati hai
 SOA objects are often 100 to 1000 times larger, relative to the specific practices of earlier attempts to promote software reuse through modularity of functions or by using predefined action groups called classes
 ek SOA kaa kushal upyog karne ke liye, nimna aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa aavashyak he: The following guiding principles define the basic rules for the development, maintenance and use of SOA
 dizin or seva kii paribhaasha ke sandarbh main nimnlikhit vishisht architekchar siddhant vishisht shaileyon par kendrit hai jo ek system ke aantarik vyavhaar ko or iske dizin kii style ko prabhavit karte hai: The following references provide additional considerations for defining an SOA implementation: iske atirikt, ek SOA karyanvayan ko paribhaashit karte samay nimnlikhit karkon / paribalon par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Web services can implement a service-oriented architecture
 web sevaayen kriyasheel nirmaanatmak-block banaati hai, jo programing bhashaaon or platform se swatantra maanak internet protocol par sulabh hote hai
 These services can either express new applications, or only cover existing systems, making them network-enabled
 prayek SOA nirmaan khand ek yaa donon bhoomikaaon ko nibhaa saktaa he
 Implementers typically build soas using web service standards that have gained wide acceptance in the industry
 ye maanak adhik antahkriya bhi uplabdh karte hai or malikana vikreta software ke liye lok-in se kuch suraksha bhi uplabdh karaate hai
 However, SOA can be implemented using any service-based technology such as Genie, CORBA or REST
 architekchar vishisht takneekon ke swatantra rup se oparate kar sakate hai
 Designers can implement SOA using a broad range of techniques, including: karyanvayan inamen se ek yaa adhik protocols kaa upyog kar sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ye SOA avadharana ke anuroop prakriyaaon ke bich nirdhaarit interphes-vinirdesan ke anuroop data ke sanchaar ke liye ek fil-pranali tantra kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 The key is an independent service with defined interfaces that can be used to perform their tasks in a standardized way, the service does not have prior knowledge about the calling application and the application does not have knowledge about it This is how the service actually performs its function
 SOA ke kai karyanvayan shuru ho chuke hai jo SOA 2
0 se jane jate adhik viksit architekchar ke SOA avadharanaon ke vikaas ko apanaate hai
 SOA enables the development of applications that are built from a combination of loose connections and interaction services
 ye sevaayen ek aupchaarik paribhaasha ke aadhaar par antahkriya karti hai jo anternihit platform or programing bhashaa se swatantra hoti he
 The interface definition hides the implementation of a language-specific service
 isliye SOA aadhaarit system vikaas takneekon or platform se swatantra rup main kaary karata he
 Services written in c # Java running on the 
NET platform and services running on the Java EE platform, for example, can both be consumed by a common mixed application
 donon main se kisi bhi platform par chalane vaale anuprayog bhi anya web sevaaon par chalane vaali sevaaon kaa upbhog kar sakate hai jo punarupyog ko badhaava detii hai
 Managed environments can also cover COBOL legacy systems and offer them as software services
 isane kai mukhya systams ke upyogi jivan ko aparimit rup se badha diya he, chaahe unhone mul rup se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa prayog kiya ho
 SOA supports integration and consolidation activities within complex enterprise systems, but SOA does not provide a method or framework for documentation capabilities and services
 ucch str kii bhashaaen jaise BPEL or vinirdesan jaise WS-CDL or ws-samanvayan seva kii avadharana ko vistrut karte hai, iske liye ve paribhaasha kii vidhiyaan uplabdh karte hai or sookshm-kaneey sevaaon ke adhik sthool kaneey sevaaon main orkesatration kaa samarthan karte hai, jise architect kaary pravaah main daal saktaa he or vyapaarik prakriyaayein compojit anuprayogon yaa portal main karyanvit kii jaati hai
 As of 2008, researchers have begun investigating the use of the service component architecture for the implementation of SOA
 sarvice oriented modelling SOA prectisionar ko uski sarvice oriented sampatti kii avadharana, vishleshan, dizin or architect ke liye guide karanevaala ek esa SOA fremawork he jo bhinn anushasano kii pahchaan karata he
 The Service Oriented Modeling Framework introduces a "map", or a task architecture, describing the various components that contribute to a successful service oriented modeling approach
 yah un mukhya tattvon nirupit karata he, jo seva vikaas yojana ke "kya kiya jaae" pahalu kii pahchaan karte hai
 This model enables the practitioner to compose the project plan and helps identify the milestones of a service oriented initiative
 SOMF bhi vyapaar or iti sanghathano ke bich sanrekhan ke liye ek saamaanya modling sanketan uplabdh karaata he
 SOMF is designed to meet the following principles: tippaneekaron ne SOA kii kai paribhaashaayen pradaan kii hai
 Both Oasis Group and Open Group have created formal definitions
 oysis SOA ko nimna rup main paribhaashit karata he: a model for the use and organization of AC distributed capabilities under the control of domains with different ownership
 It provides analogous means for proposing, searching, and interacting and uses capabilities to produce the desired effect consistent with measurable predicaments and expectations
 seva anubandh ke liye nimnlikhit avyavon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: As of 2008 the principles of SOA are being implemented in the field of network management
 sevabhimukh network prabandhan architekchar ke udaahranon main shaamil hai ETSI se TS 188 001 NGN prabandhan OSS architekchar or ITU-T se suchit M
3060 agali peedi ke network prabandhan ke siddhant 
 SOA infrastructure management tools include: kuch udhyam architects kaa maananaa he ki bazaar kii badalati hui paristhitiyon main SOA vyapaar ko jaldi se or laagat prabhavi dhang se pratibhaav dene main madad kar saktaa he
 This style of architecture promotes reuse at the macro level rather than at the micro level
 kuch sandarbhon main, SOA ko ek kranti ke bajaay architekchar kaa kramik-vikaas mana ja saktaa he
 It retains many of the best practices of earlier software architectures
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanchaar pranaaliyon main, anya upkarnon ke baat karne ke liye sahi myne main sthir binding kaa upyog karanevaale samaadhaanon ke kshetra main bahut kam vikaas hua hai
 By formally adopting an SOA approach, such systems can prepare themselves to stress the importance of well-defined, highly interoperable interfaces
 kuch logon ne yah sawaal uthaaya tha ki kya SOA modular programing, ghatana-oriented dizin yaa interphes / avyav aadhaarit dizin jaisi avadharanaon ko maatr punerjeevit karata he
 SOA promotes the purpose of separating users from service implementations
 isliye sevaaon ko bhinn vitarit platformon par chalaaya ja saktaa he or ye network par uplabdh ho sakati hai
 This can also maximize reuse of services
 SOA ek architektural or dizin anushaasan he jise antahkriya kshamta / interoparability ko badhaane kaa, federation ko badhaane kaa or vyapaar or takanic domen sanrekhan ko badhaane kaa lakshya praapt karne ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Service oriented architecture is an architectural approach to building complex software-intensive systems that are universally composed of a group of interconnected and interdependent building blocks
 sevaaon ke nirmaan ke samay vishleshan or dizin vidhi ke upyog ke madhyam se SOA apane vyapaar or iti laabh vasuul karata he
 This method ensures that the services remain consistent with the architectural vision and planning and follow the principles of service orientation
 Arguments supporting business and management aspects from SOA have been cited in several publications
 sirf aupchaarik rup se paribhaashit interphes ke madhyam se hi seva ko kriyasheeltaa kii ekmev ikai uplabdh hoti he
 Services can be a kind of "nano enterprises" that are easy to manufacture and improve
 or sevaayen "bade nigam" bhi ho sakati hai, jo gaun sevaaon ke samanvit kaary ke rup banaai jaati he
 The services generally follow the following principles of service orientation: SOA kaa paripakv roleout prabhavi rup se sanghathan ke API ko paribhaashit karata he
 Reasons to see the implementation of services as separate projects from large projects include: SOA se hote apratyaksh laabh main shaamil he naatakeey rup se sarlikrut pareekshan
 sevaayen swytt, avasthaaheen hai, puri tarah se dastavejit interphes se yukt hai or karyanvayan ke kros kating chintaaon se alag hai
 The industry has never gone through such situations before
 yadi sanghathan main upyukt paribhaashit pareekshan data hai, to jab ek seva kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he, tab ek sambandhit stub kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he, jo pareekshan data ko pratikraya karata he
 a full set of regression tests, scripts, data, and responses are also used for the service
 jo sevaaon ko maanga gaya he uske tadvishyak upasthit stub kaa upyog karte hue ek 'blike box' ke rup main bhi pareekshan kiya jaataa saktaa he
 a test environment is created where services outside the proto and scope are stub, while the remainder of the network is the test planner for the entire service
 chunki prayek interphes puri tarah se dastavejon se yukt hota he, jo pratigaman test dastavejikaran kaa puraa set hota he, isliye pareekshan sevaaon main samasyaon kii pahchaan saral ban jaati he
 Testing is developed only to validate the test service works according to its documentation and to find spaces between the test case and documentation of all existing services in the environment
 Idempotent sevaaon kii data avasthaa kaa prabandhan ekmaatr jatilta he
 Examples prove to be helpful at the level where they are useful in documenting the service
 java samudaay prakriya main kuch apis ke dastavejikaran achche udhaaharan uplabdh karaate hai
 Because they are elaborate, staff will typically use only significant sub-sets
 'ossjsa
pdf' within JSR-89 is an example of such a file
 ek spasht or aam chunauti saamne ai, vah he, seva metadata kaa prabandhan
 SOA aadhaarit vaataavaran main kai sevaayen shaamil ho sakati hai jo kaary karne ke liye sandeshon kaa vinimay karti hai
 By design, a single application can generate several million messages
 sevaayen kaise antarkriya karti hai, is par jaankaree uplabdh karana or iskaa prabandhan jatil ho saktaa he
 Another challenge is the lack of testing in the SOA space
 There are no state-of-the-art tools that provide the testing capability of all headless services in a specific architecture
 Due to lack of overall trust, it is necessary that both manufacturers and consumers continue to test services
 The main purpose of SOA is to provide agility / speed to the business
 isliye ek pareekshan dhaanche main nivesh karnaa mahatvapurn he, jo architekchar main apradhi ko khojane ke liye paardarshita uplabdh karaayega
 vyavsaay main teji ke liye aavashyak he ki SOA sevaaon ko vyapaar prerana model main di gayi paribhaasha ke anusaar vyapaarik uddeshyon or nirdeshon ke dwaara niyantrit kiya ja sake
 Another challenge relates to providing appropriate levels of protection
 jab ek anuprayog jiskaa upyog anya anuprayog bhi kar sakate he asi sevaaon ke rup main apni kshamtaayen ujagar karti he tab anuprayog ke bheetar main samavisht suraksha model paryaapt nahin rahete
 arthath, anuprayog-prabandhit suraksha, sevaaon kii suraksha ke liye sahi model nahin he
 Many new technologies and standards have begun to provide more suitable models for security in SOA
 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen SOA suraksha pravishti
 As SOA and WS- * specification practitioners expand, update and refine their out put, they face the problem of lack of skilled people to work on SOA based systems, building service infrastructure and integrating services also includes
 antahchaalan SOA karyanvayan kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu hota he
 WS-I organizations have developed Basic Profiles and Basic Security Profiles to strengthen compatibility
 WS-I has designed testing tools to determine whether web services meet the WS-I profile guidelines
 iske atirikt, vishwasaneey suraksha profile par kaam karne ke liye ek or charter kii sthapana kii gayi he
 Significant vendor promotions surround SOA; This creates such expectations, which may not be met
 Early adopters continued to test development and runtime products in the context of real-world problems, and as a result, product stacks continued to form
 Soya does not guarantee any reduction in IT costs, nor does it give any guarantee for speeding up the market or speeding up of systems
 safal SOA karyanvayan ye sabhi yaa inamen se kuch laabh ho sakate hai, yah system architekchar or dizin kii gunvattta or sambhddhata par nirbhar karata he
 Internal IT delivery organizations initiate regular SOA efforts and some of them introduce concepts in business inappropriately, leading to misconceptions about them
 Adopting this led to the need for IT delivery rather than business, resulting in an organization with superlative laptop provisioning services rather than an organization responding quickly to market opportunities
 yah sanghathan SOA kaa karyanvayan thik prakaar se kar rahaa he is bare main vyapaar netritv bhi sahamat ho gaya tha
 The most important advantage of SOA is that it can be easily reused
 isliye antat hisabi javabdehita or vitt modelon kaa vikaas sanghathan main hi hona chahie
 ek vyavsaay ikai ko aisi sevaaon ke nirmaan ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie, jiskaa upyog anya ikaiyaan kar saken
 iske vipareet, ikaayiyon ko sevaaon ke punahprayog ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie
 iske liye prashasan ke kuch nae ghatakon kii aavashyaktaa rahati haih Some criticisms of SOA rely on the compilation of SOA with web services
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch aalochakon kaa daawa he ki SOA kaa parinaam XML kii paraton kii badhotari ke rup main hota he, jo XML parsing or sanrachana ko bataata he
 In the absence of native or binary forms of remote process calls, applications can slow down and require more processing capacity, which leads to cost overruns
 adhikansh karyanvayanon main ye overhead shaamil hai, lekin SOA ko duurastha prakriya colls yaa XML ke madhyam se anuwaad par nirbhar nahin ho asi praudyogikiyon ) kaa upyog karte hue bhi karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 Emerging from the emerging open source XML parsing technologies and different xml-compatible binary formats that promise good performance of SOA
 avasthaapurna sevaaon ko samaan upabhokta-vishisht sandarbh ko saajha karne ke liye upabhokta or pradaata donon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo yaa to isamen shaamil hote hai yaa upabhokta or pradaata ke bich sandesh vinimay ke dwaara sandarbhit hote hai
 The drawback of this constraint is that if the service provider is required to maintain a shared context for each consumer, this may reduce the overall scalability of the service provider
 yah seva pradaata or upabhokta ke bich sangyojan ko badhaata he or seva pradaataaon badalanaa adhik mushkil banaata he
 antat, kuch aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki SOA sevaayen abhi bhi unke dwaara abhivyakt kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ke dwaara atyant baadhit hai
 Another issue relates to the gradual development of WS- * standards and products and unless SOA is fully managed and anticipated with additional budget and additional proof-of-concept work contingent, SOA will thus Includes new risks from
 kuch aalochak SOA ko mahaj pehle se acchhee tarah bane hue architekcharon kaa swaabhaavik vikascchurrentl ke anusaar maanate hai
 IT system designs sometimes ignore the desirability of modified systems
 SOA aadhaarit system, hard code oparations, sanghathan kii malsamaan or sevaayen ke saath kai system, is prakaar se apni online sevaayen or vaishvik bazaar main vyapaaree chapaltaa ko baadhit karte hai
 The next step in the design process involves the definition of the service delivery platform and its implementation
 SDP dizin charan main vyavsaayik jaankaree model, pahchaan prabandhan, utpaadon, saamagree, upkaran or antim upyogkarta seva visheshtaon ko or saath hi kya system itani chapal he ki vyapaar or uske graahakon ke kramik vikaas ke saath taal rakh paae - in muddon ko paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Web 2
0, which is the perceived "second generation" of web activity, is primarily a feature of collaboration and the ability to share information provided to viewers for sharing
 web 2
0 anuprayog aksar rest-ful web sevaaon kaa prayog karte hai or saamaanya rup se isamen AJAX aadhaarit upyogkarta interphes hota he, jo web sindication, blogs or vikis kaa upyog karte hai
 While there are no set standards for Web 2
0, it is characterized by the use of existing Web server architectures and services
 isliye web 2

 Some commentators consider Mashup to be a Web 2

 However, as of 2008 use-cases have demonstrated the possibility of combining the principles and techniques of both Web 2

 Therefore, Napoleon adopted a policy of economically paralyzing England to defeat it
 vastutah usne england ke viruddh aarthik yuddh kaa sahaara liya or isi kram main usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko apanaaya
 Napoleon knew very well that it was not possible to defeat England from military point of view because England had its own power in its advanced industries
 yadi in udyogon ke utpaadit saamaanon kaa europea bazaar avaruddha kar diya jaae to ye udyog swamev band ho jaayenge or vahaan bekaari kii samasya paidaa ho jaayegi
 He believed that with the economic blockade of England dependent on trade, the prices of goods would fall and the economy of England would begin to collapse
 duusari taraf mahadweep ko england ke liye band karke england ko france se khaadya padaarth kharidne ko baadhya kar usase bahumoolya dhaatu le sakegaa
 This would spoil the economic condition of England and France would be able to conquer it
 is vichaar ke saath nepalian ne 'berlin aadesh', 'milan aadesh', 'fatabllon aadesh' dwaara mahadwipiya vyavastha ko lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Through these orders, he forbade his subordinate states to trade with England and also made it clear that war-related actions would be taken against those states or kings who violated this order directly or indirectly with England
 england ne nepalian kii mahadwipiya vyavastha kaa saamana karne ke liye ordr in counsil paas kar france se vyapaarik sambandh viched kar liya tathaa tatasth deshon ko bhi aisa karne kaa kaha
 The continental system failed to achieve its objective
 british vyapaar ko nasht karnaa iskaa uddeshy tha jo puraa nahin ho sakaa
 France itself had to face trouble even harder than England's problem
 mahadwipiya vyavastha swayan nepolian va europe ke liye aatmghaatee hui
 Napoleon took drastic measures against many countries to implement this plan
 faltah vah ghaatak aakraamak yudhon main ulajhata chalaa gaya or uske samrajya kaa vighatan hua
 In fact, control of Portugal was necessary to make the continental system successful because Britain's goods were secretly transported from Portuguese beaches to Europe
 portugal par niyantran ke liye spain ke saath yuddh aavashyak ho gaya
 Napoleon occupied both of those places but there was immense pressure on the means of France and the nationalist outburst of Spain shattered Napoleon's empire and opened the way for its downfall
 isi sandarbh main nepolian ne kaha ki spain ke sainik ghaavon ne mujhe barbaad kar diya
 In this way, the continental system was definitely harmful for England from the economic point of view, but more than that it damaged its creator and paved the way for its downfall
