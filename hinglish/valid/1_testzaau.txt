 Mimamsa Darshan is one of the six Darshans of Hindus
 paksh-pratipaksh ko lekar vedavakyon ke nirnit arth ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 The above idea is from the earlier Aryan tradition
 kintu aaj se praaia: sava paanch hajaar varsh purv samaveda ke acharya krishna dwaipayan ke shishy ne use sutarabaddh kiya
 The sutras refer to Badarayana, Badari, Atreya, Ashmarathya, Drafting, Etishayan, Kamukayan, Kartajajini and Labukayana Maharshias as complete aspects and principles, which are detailed in the annotations and discourses of the sutras, which have become millennials
 
 is shaastra kaa purvamimasaa ar veydant kaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 From the sutra composed by Jaimini Muni, Mimamsa is called Jaminian Dharmamimamsa
 german vidwaan maxmooler kaa kahana he ki - "yah darshan shaastra koti main nahin aa saktaa, kyonki isamen dharmanushthan kaa hi vivechan kiya gaya he
 There is no discussion of Jiva, God, Bandha, Moksha and their means anywhere
 " Some Indian scholars who are biased to Maxmuller's opinion also hesitate to call it philosophy, because in the Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta the evidence and theorems in the then cases are mainly about the soul-self, Bandha-moksha etc
 Discretion is received, the same philosophy is not visible in the formulas, commentary and talk etc
 uparyukt vichaarkon ne sthool buddhi se granth kaa adhyayan kar apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Yet it is clear that the philosophy of Mimamsa is the contributory cause of all philosophies
 jaimini ne in vishyon kaa beej rup se apane sutron main upanyaas kiya he "satsamprayoge purushasyendriyanaa buddhi janm tat pratyakshm" chaturth sutara main do shabd aae hai - purush or buddhi
 The word "soul" differs from the male word
 yah arth kumaril bhatta ne "bhaattdipika" main likhaa he
 The word wisdom has conveyed the meaning of knowledge, pramata, theorem and proof
 vrittikaar ne "tasya nimitt parishti:" paryat teen sutron main pratyaksh, anumaan shabd, arthapati or anuplabdhi pramaanon kaa saparikar vishad vivechan tathaa autpattik sutara main aatmavaad kaa vishesh vivechan apane vyaakhyaan main kiya he
 The same has been analyzed in texts like Shabar Bhashya, Shloka Vartik, Shastradipika, Bhatt Chintamani, etc
, wherein there is a distinction between proofs and theorems, Bandha, Moksha and their means
 mimasaa darshan main bharatvarsh ke mukhya prandhan dharm kaa varnashram vyavastha, aadhanadi, ashwamedhant aadi vichaaron kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Often, knowledgeable and disinterested men have been everywhere in the world, but the learned philosophers of rituals and rituals of rituals have been learned in India only
 inamen katyayan, aashvalyan, aapstamb, bodhayan, gautam aadi maharishiyon ke granth aaj bhi uplabdh hai
 
 bhartiya karmkand siddhant kaa pratidaan or samarthan isi darshan main praapt hota he
 Dr
 Kunnan Raja has aptly portrayed this in the role of the second edition of "brihati"
 yadhyapi kanad muni krit vaisheshik darshan main dharm kaa namatah ullekh praapt hota he - tathaapi uske vishay main aage vichaar nahin kiya gaya he
 a scholar says - arthath jaise koi manushya samudr paryant jane kii ichha rakhte hue himalay main chalaa jaataa he, usee prakaar dharm ke vyaakhyaan ke icchhuk kanad muni shat padaarthon kaa vivechan karte rah gaye
 Answer: According to the principle of epistemology, right to attain enlightenment is only after the deed, but according to the earlier epistemology philosophy - is vedamantra ke anusaar mumukshu janon ko bhi karm karnaa chahie
 By performing Vedic Karma, the Karmbandhan is automatically terminated - Tasmanmumukhubhi: Karya is the main soul of Indian theistic philosophies according to the verses of Nityamtikam and ‚Äúadi‚Äù
 mimasaa darshan solah adhyyon kaa he, jisamen baarah adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshcand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It discusses the authority of the deity
 at: use 'devtaa cond' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan case that despite reading Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, the reading was in Dvadashadhyay only in the medieval period
 jis tarah chatushpada gayatri ke rahane par bhi vidvan varg tripada gayatri ko hi japate hai, usee tarah vartmaan kaal main dwadashadhyaayi mimasaa kaa hi adhyayan adhyaapan prachlit he
 According to some scholars, it is difficult to decide the meaning of a sentence without epistemology, because such a sentence is evidence in the present sense or in other sense, the conclusion which comes in the decision of this idea is called epistemology, but here the meaning of the word epistemology is from philosophy
 is
 dharmagyaan ke liye paraspar virodh rahit vedamantron ke arthon ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 And thoughtfully received theology is the result of epistemology
 yahi baat jaimini ne apane mimasaa darshan main kahi he - athato dharm jigyaasa
 1
1
1
 kumaril bhatta ne ise is prakaar varnan kiya he - Further sentence-wise decision-making millennium judgments are described
 yahan tak chah adhyyon kaa sankshipt vishyanirdesh kiya gaya
 In this philosophy, one gets knowledge of duty-abstention from Veda-sentence-decision by considering the objective predicate sentiment obtained from judicious judgment, or from the combustible combustion justice
 isliye dharmagyaan hi mimasaa darshan kaa prayojan he
 In this philosophy there is an undertaking from theology
 vyakaran ke liye "padashastra", vaisheshik nyaay ke liye "pramanshastra" or mimasaa ke liye "vaakyashastra" kaa prayog sanskrit sahitya main hota he
 There is a discussion of religious thought in this scripture
 bhartiya janata kaa mukhya uddeshy dharmanushthan he
 Ritual cannot happen without fruit and fruitfulness cannot be without material means
 at: sankshep main saadhan kaa bhi vivechan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to know the symptoms, evidence and means of religion before the ritual
 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the connotation of the word are continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance, in Uttamimamsa's "an Evatman: Sharire Bhavat"
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Nira‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞vara SamƒÅhƒÅkƒÅvƒ´ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•áa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The annihilation of Deity of the commentary Shabar should be ascertained from maturity
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - SƒÅdhyƒÅkƒÅ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æa ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ßa SƒÅdhanƒÅkƒÅ ‡§î‡§∞a and "ityƒÅkƒÅyƒÅtakƒÅbak‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also believed to be authentic
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Nyaya Sudhakar has considered it special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself

 1992 main, steven spewalk ne udhyam sanrachana ko taiyaar karne kii prakriya kaa varnan kiya jiskaa istemaal vyapak rup se shaikshik paathyakramon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Many enterprise structure frameworks break down the practice of enterprise structure and divide it into different regions or regions
 udhyam sanrachana par apni pustak main, spewalk ne 'str 2' par abhyaas ko do kshetron main vibhajit kiya: "vyapaar modelling" or "vartmaan pranali or praudyogiki" or 'str 3' par teen adhinsth kshetron main: "data sanrachana", "anuprayog sanrachana" or "sanrachana praudyogiki"
 spewalk ke iapi kii antim str main "kriyanvayan" yaa "padyatiyaan" str hai, jisamen is baat par charchaa kii gai he ki nae model ke saath match karne ke liye udhyam ko "kaise" pravrajan kiya jaae
 The popular Togaf framework divides practice into three areas: "business structure", "information system structure" and "technology structure" and then subdivides information systems structure into "information structure" and "application structure"
 samrik sanrachana model das lacheele vibhaajan tak kii anumati detaa he jisamen project or program ke software anuprayogon or praudyogiki ke madhyam se udhyam kii pariyojnaon or lakshyon ke kai pahalu shaamil hai
 The division of practice into several areas allows the enterprise architect to interpret the enterprise from several key perspectives
 yah abhyaas bhi kai vyaktiyon ke yogadan ko protsaahit karti he or anumati detii he ki alag domen-vishesh nipunata or gyaan kaa puri tarah se behatar istemaal kar sake
 is drushtikon se, udhyam vaastukar ek samgr vivaran utpaadan karne kaa sunishchay kar sakate hai
 The popular and most common four domains and their component parts will look like this: udhyam sanrachana ke varnan kaa mukhya uddeshy vyapaar kii prabhaavashiltaa or dakshata main sudhaar karnaa he
 It may be appropriate to include the structure of an organization, the centralization or federation of business processes, the quality and timeliness of business information, or the money spent on information technology
 vyavsaayik kaary kaa sudhaar karne ke liye is vidhi kii jaankaree kaa upyog jaisaa ki togaaf sanrachana ruparekha main varnit he, "vaastu-sambandhi drugvishay" kaa vikaas shaamil: vyavsaay kaa vivaran jo "lakshya" yaa "bhavishya main praapt" karne vaale lakshya kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Once this approach is well understood, intermediate steps are taken that describe the process of reaching the goal from the current state
 in madhyavarti kadamon ko togaaf dwaara "sankramanakalin sanrachanaayen" kaha jaataa he
 Other similar methods are described in the Enterprise Structure Framework

 While this may mean that enterprise structure is very closely linked to IT, addressing the topic as a business subject more broadly as a technical subject in terms of business optimization, performance management, and process structure to be seen
 Depending on the organization, enterprise infrastructure teams may be responsible for some aspects of performance engineering, IT portfolio management and metadata management

 Words that express the doing or being of an action are called actions
 jaise- royaa, kha rahaa, jaayegaa aadi
 For example, if a sentence 'I have eaten food' is seen, then it has the verb 'khaya'
 'iskaa naam mohan he' main kriya 'he' shabd he
 'you had to go there' has two verb words - 'go' and 'tha'
 kriya ke bhi kai rup hote hai, jo pratyay or sahaayak kriyaaon dwaara badale jate hai
 As a verb, the gender and word of its subject noun or pronoun are also known
 kriya vah vikari shabd he, jisase kisi padaarth yaa praani ke vishay main kuch vidhaan kiya jaataa he
 Or the vicious word with which we make some legislation in relation to an object is called a verb
 jaise- In the above sentences are verbs, lie and eat
 kriya ke saadhaaran roopon ke ant main naa laga rahata he jaise-aana, janaa, paanaa, khona, khelnaa, kudana aadi
 The remainder which is left by not removing the end of ordinary forms is called the metal of the verb
 aana, janaa, paanaa, khona, khelnaa, kudana kriyaaon main aa, ja, paa, kho, khel, kud dhaatuen hai
 The form of the verb found in the dictionary is not associated with the metal
 naa hataa dene se dhaatu shesh rah jaati he
 By: Raj Sarma
 jis kriya se suchit hone vaala vyapaar karta kare or uskaa fal bhi karta par hi pade, use akarmak kriya kehete hai
 Like - Ram eats
 vaakya main khaane kaa vyapaar ram se he or khaane kaa fal bhi ram par hi padataa he, isliye 'khaataa he' akarmak kriya he

 Like- Gandhi
 - se abhisht arth kii prapti nahin hoti
 If you are asked to understand the meaning, what is Gandhi called? So the answer will be - Gandhi is called Mahatma
 is prakaar kahalaaye apurna akarmak kriya kaa arth mahatma shabd dwaara spasht hota he

 Accusative verb sakarmak kriya The action by which the result of the business which is informed rather than the doer falls on the karma, is called transitive verb
 jaise- shyaam pustak padhata he
 - In the sentence, the business of the verb reads black, but the fruit of this trade falls on the book, so it reads transitive verb and the book karma is the word karma
 anya udhaahranh 1
 Ram kills arrows
 2
 radha murti banaati he
 3
 The leader makes a speech
 4
 kutta haddi chabaata he
 5 boys play cricket

 The intransitive verb that is used as a fulfillment of another noun or adjective with karma in the sentence to explain its full meaning is called imperfect intransitive verb
 jaise- raja ne gangadhar ko mantri banaaya
 - The action of intransitive verb made in a sentence is Gangadhar, but the meaning of this karma is not clear in this way
 uskaa aasham spasht karne ke liye uske saath mantri sangya bhi prayukt hoti he
 The imperfect verb made in this sentence is Gangadhar Karma and the ministerial word is karma-fulfillment
 anya udhaahranh 1
 Teacher selected Santosh as class representative
 2
 ham apane mitra ko chatur samajhate hai
 3
 We consider every Indian as our own
 4 ham maanav seva ko punya maanate hai

 santosh ko, mitra ko or bhartiya ko karm hai or varg-pratinidhi, chatur or apana karm-purti he
 The transitive verb that uses two karma in a sentence to explain its meaning is called a transitive verb
 jaise-shikshak ne vidhyaarthee ko pustak di
 - The business of the verb given in this sentence falls on two deeds - the book and the student, so the given sentence has a transitive verb
 pustak mukhya karm or vidhyaarthee gaun karm he
 Out of the two karma used with the duality, the main karma is the realization of a substance and the secondary karma is the realization of a creature
 anya udhaahranh 1
 The king donated to the Brahmin
 2
 ram lakshmana ko ganit sikhaata he
 3
 The owner gives money to the servant
 4 police choron ko pakadati he
 In the above sentences, given, teaches and gives is a dative verb
 daan, ganit or paise mukhya karm hai to brahman ko, lakshmana ko or naukar ko gaun karm
 From the point of view of composition, there are two types of action - rudh kriyaah jis kriya kii rachana dhaatu se hoti he, use rudh kehete hai
 Like, writing, reading, eating, drinking etc
 yogic kriyaah jis kriya kii rachana ek se adhik tatwon se hoti he, use yogic kriya kehete hai
 Such as writing, coming and going, teaching, telling, raving etc
 yogic kriya ke bhedah The verb whose trade is known to the lover of another is called motivational verb
 jaise- shikshak ne vidhyaarthee se pustak padhwaayi
 The motivation of the teacher on the student subject is known by the action taught in the sentence
 jo karta duusare par prerana karata he, use prerak karta kehete hai or jis par prerana kii jaati he, use prerit karta kehete hai
 In the sentence presented, the teacher is the motivational verb, teacher motivator and student motivator
 prerak karta kaa prayog karta kaarak main or prerit karta kaa prayog karan kaarak main hota he
 Mostly intransitive and transitive are formed from intransitive
 jaise- Rules for making inspirational verbs: 1
 adhiktar dhaatuon se do-do preranarthak kriyaayein banati hai, pehali preranarthak main aa or duusari main vaan judata he- Fall down chal chalaanaa chalavaanaa Plating plating 2

 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he
 ‚Äù: 2 The broad form of this model is the bi-beta model, which distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta

 This version was more rigorous in empirical testing and was an effective contributor to the global acceptance of CPM
 mulya nirdhaaran va portpholio chayan ke kai aadhunik tareekon ke aagaman tathaa antarpanan anubhavik khaamiyon, ke baavjood apni saadhaaranta va vibhinn prakaar paristhitiyon main upyogita ke kaaran siepiem abhi bhi adhik prachlit he
 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 Œ≤ tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko Œ≤ ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E‚àí Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki Œ≤ se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e ‚àí p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be determined by the CAMP how much the expected return, ie the adjustment rate, of a specific asset should be taken into consideration
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context‚Äîi
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness‚Äîas opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he
