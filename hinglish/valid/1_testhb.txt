 Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati was a great thinker, social reformer and patriot of modern India
 unka bachapan kaa naam 'mulshankar' tha
 He founded an Arya Samaj reformer organization - Arya Samaj in 1874
 ve ek sanyasi tathaa ek mahaan chintak the
 He always considered the power of the Vedas to be paramount
 swamiji ne karm siddhanth, punarjanm, brahmacharya tathaa sanyas ko apane darshan ke chaar stambh banaaya
 He first gave the slogan of 'swarajya' in 1876, which was later promoted by Lokmanya Tilak

 Among the prominent followers of Swami Dayanand, Lala Hansraj founded the 'dayanand Anglo Vedic College' at Lahore in 1886 and Swami Shraddhanand established the Gurukul at Kangri near Haridwar in 1901
 dayanand saraswati kaa janm 12 farvari tankaara main san 1824 main morabi ke paas kathiyawad kshetra, gujarat main hua tha
 His father's name was Karshanji Lalji Tiwari and mother's name was Yashodabai
 unke pita ek kar-colector hone ke saath brahman parivaar ke ek amir, samrudh or prabhaavshaalee vyakti the
 Dayanand Saraswati's real name was Moolshankar and his early life was very comfortable
 aage chalakar ek pandit banane ke liye ve sanskrit, veda, shastron va anya dharmik pustakon ke adhyayan main lag gaye
 There were many such incidents in his life which forced him to ask serious questions about the traditional beliefs of Hinduism and God
 ek baar shivaratri kii ghatana he
 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments started coming to the understanding of the people and the opposition decreased
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity

 Magnet therapy is a medical practice
 isaki do paddatiyaan prachlit hai- sarvadaihik arthath hatheliyon va talvon par lagane se tathaa sthanik arthath rogagrast bhaag par lagane se
 According to this, based on the electrical correlation of the body by taking a pair of North Pole and South Pole magnets, the North Pole magnet is usually used on the right side, forward and northern parts of the body, while the South Pole magnet
 It is used on the left parts of the body, on the back and on the lower parts
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 isamen chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 jaise ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 Mainly, two methods of magnetic therapy are prevalent - 1
 Applying the universal means on the palms and soles and 2
 Applying on the local area ie the diseased part
 inkaa varnan yahan diya ja rahaa he - According to this method, a pair of magnets filled with the North Pole and South Dhruva is taken
 sharir ke vidyutiya sahasambandh ke aadhaar par saamanyatya uttari dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke daayen bhaagon par, aage kii ore va uttari bhaagon par kiya jaataa he, jabaki dakshini dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke baayein bhaagon par, peeth par tathaa nichle bhaagon par kiya jaataa he
 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this method of application, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc
 inamen rog kii tivrata tathaa rup ke anusaar ek, do or yahan tak ki teen chumbakon kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in severe pain of knee and neck, two magnets can be applied on different knees and third magnet can be applied on painful vertebrae of neck
 is prayog vidhi kii upyogita sthanik rog sankraman kii avasthaa main bhi hoti he
 In some situations like severe pain in the thumb, sometimes keeping the thumb between the poles of both magnets gives instant relief
 yah har aayu ke nar-naariyon ke liye gunakari he
 Treatment through magnets is so simple that it can be tried at any time, anywhere and on any part of the body
 purush ho yaa stri, jawan ho yaa boodha, sabhi isse labhanvit ho sakate hai
 The magnetism improves blood circulation; If the magnet is in contact with the body for some time, heat is produced in the body, all its functions are improved and blood circulation increases
 is kaaran saare sharir ko shakti milti he, rog dur hone main sahaayta milti he, thakaavat or durbalata dur hoti he, jisase rogi sheeghra swasthya laabh karata he or sharir ke prayek ang kii pidaa or sujan bhi dur ho jaati he
 In some cases, this method is so powerful and its effect is so rapid that it is often enough to eliminate the disease forever
 kai maamalon main duusari baar chumbak lagane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin padati
 Such as in tooth aches and sprains etc
 pehle se taiyaari jaruri nahin ek hi chumbak kaa anek vyakti upyog kar sakate hai
 They do not need to be cleaned, washed, or sterilized
 yadhyapi twachaa ke sankramak rog kii chikitsa main jis chumbak kaa upyog hua ho, uski safai kerani padati he
 If you have used a thin cloth cover then there is no question of cleaning the magnet, just cleaning the cloth is sufficient
 isaki lat nahin padati chumbak ke upachaar kii aadat nahin padati or uskaa upyog achaanak band kar diya jaae to bhi koi mushkil khadi nahin hoti
 Magnet pulls the pain from the body
 Every disease must have some kind of pain
 pidaa chaahe kisi kaaran se ho, chumbak main use ghataane, balki samaapt tak karne kaa gun he
 With his help, all body functions become normal
 isi kaaran sabhi rogon par chumbakon kaa prabhaav padataa he, pidaa dur ho jaati he or sharir kii kriyaaon ke vikaar thik ho jate hai
 The size and design of the magnet will depend on which part of the body it is mounted on
 sharir ke kuch ang aise hai, jahaan bade aakaar ke chumbak nahin lag sakate, kuch angon par chote chumbak thik se kaam nahin karenge
 For example, if a magnet is to be applied to the eye, it should be a small size circular magnet, which comes over the closed eye
 duusari ore agar sharir ke adhiktar bhaagon main pidaa yaa sujan he to bade aakaar kaa chumbak lagegaa
 Therefore, the same size-type magnet cannot be used on different parts of the body
 chumbakon kii shakti par bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Some soft parts of the body such as brain, eye and heart should not be fitted with high power magnets nor should medium power magnets be installed for a long time
 iske vipareet kam shakti vaale chumbak kadi or bade aakaar kii mansapeshiyon yaa haddiyon ke rogon ke liye kaaphi nahin honge, jaise ki kulhon, janghaaon, ghutanon yaa ediyon kii hoti hai
 These things should be kept in mind in the choice of magnets not only for local diseases but also for the whole body
 upachaar lete samay jameen athwa kisi lohe kii vastu se rogi kaa sampark na ho, yah aavashyak he
 So an iron chair or bed is forbidden, while a wooden chair or bed is ideal
 chumbakon kii sthiti is prakaar rahani chahie ki uttari dhruv uttar disha kii ore tathaa dakshini dhruv dakshin disha kii ore rahe
 This will keep the magnetic field parallel to the Earth's magnetic field and make the magnet more effective
 yadi do chumbakon ke do alag-alag dhruvon kaa prayog ek hi samay kiya ja rahaa ho to rogi kaa munh pashchim kii ore hona chahie, jisase ki uske sharir kaa dahinaa bhaag uttar kii ore tathaa baayan bhaag dakshin kii ore rahe
 It is considered appropriate that spatial or general use of magnets is expedient from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
 vayaskon ke jeern amwati sandhishoth main pehle ek saptaah tak chumbakon kaa prayog keval 10 minute tak karnaa chahie or is avadhi ko dhire-dhire 30 minute tak badha dena chahie
 In many other diseases also the time should be extended accordingly
 adhik shaktishaalee chumbakon par tadnusaar gata deni chahie
 When using magnets on the Komlang like brain, it is well understood that powerful magnets are not used in it
 chumbak kaa prayog 10 minute se adhik kabhi na kiya jaae
 However, in relation to the period, its discretion is considered to be the best
 chumbak chikitsa kaa koi pratiprabhav nahin hota
 Still, do not worry if you feel symptoms of heaviness, vertigo, vomiting, saliva dripping etc
 aise kisi lakshan ko twarit dur karnaa jaruri ho to jaste yaa tambe kii ek pattee par donon haath 20-25 minute tak rakhen
 In the condition of inflammation of the vertebral neuralgia of the knees and neck, the use of magnets on the knees for 10 minutes in the morning and the last parts of the neck and pain for 10 minutes in the evening, but in these conditions the use of magnets should be from 10 minutes
 Should not be more
 gharelu nuskhe jaan-jahaan yun rahen swasth yon samasyaayen sehat samachar jadi-bootiyaan chikitsa paddatiyaan aahaar ayurveda 1) Time of magnet use chumbakon kaa prayog karne ke liye kisi samay vishesh niyam kaa paalan karnaa jaruri nahin hota, lekin uchit rahata he yadi inkaa prayog praatavkalin shouch evam snaan aadi se nivrutt hokar athwa shaam ko rogi kii suvidhanusaar kiya jaae
 Utmost care should be taken in determining the time to use and use magnets
 anubhav bataata he ki kasheruka sandhishoth, janu sandhishoth tathaa qamar dard jaisi kuch rogavasthaayen shaareerik shram evam din kaa kaam khatm karne par shaam ko badhate hai
 Therefore, in such diseases, when magnets are used in the evening, then there is a lot of relief
 iske vipareet dast, kabjiyat tathaa badi aanton ke pradaah main chumbakon kaa prayog subah ke samay karnaa chahie
 According to Ayurveda, cough is said to be the main cause of diseases like cough, colds, colds, inflammation of respiratory tracts, pyorrhea and they increase in the morning
 pitt, amlata evam ruddhavaat jaise vaat sambandhi rog shaam ko badhate hai
 If we follow this principle, then in case of chest diseases and phlegm, magnets should be used in the morning
 yadi jigar vikaar jaise pittajnak rog hon, to chumbakon kaa prayog dopaher baad kiya janaa chahie tathaa jab pet yaa aanton ke andar hawa banati ho to chumbakon kaa prayog shaam ko kiya janaa chahie
 Every prudent magnet doctor should take all these facts into consideration when scheduling the use of magnets to his patient
 1
 chumbakon kaa prayog karte samay athwa uske turant baad icecream jaisi kisi thandi khaane-pine kii cheez kaa seven nahin kiya janaa chahie, anyathaa ve utakon par chumbakon ke prabhaav ko anaavashyak rup se kam kar dengi
 2
 Do not take magnetic treatment for two hours after meals, taking this treatment immediately after meals is likely to cause vomiting
 bhojan ke baad rakt paribhraman pet ke avyavon kii ore vishesh hota he, usamen vyavdhaan daalana uchit nahin he
 3
 Powerful magnets should not be used on pregnant women, as this sometimes leads to miscarriage
 aavashyaktaa ho to madhyam shakti tathaa alp shakti chumbakon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin unhen garbhashay se dur rakhana chahie
 4
 Following the instructions given in the chapter on 'magnetic Water', the quantity of magnetic water should not be increased normally, otherwise it sometimes increases the body's activity and creates an uncomfortable situation
 bacchon ko chumbakeey jal dene par iskaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie
 5
 Do not let the opposing poles of powerful magnets come in contact with each other
 kabhi aksmaat angulii bich main aa jaae to kuchal jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Also, sticking magnets are difficult to separate
 6
 upachaar ke samay sharir se gahanaa yaa aisi vastuon ko hataa dena chahie jo chumbakatv kaa shoshan kar lete hai
 Some electrical appliances and watches can also be destroyed by the impact of magnets if they are not kept away from the magnets
 atah chumbakon ko inase dur rakhana chahie
 7
 When magnets are not used, the holder should be kept on top of them and handled well
 unhen jameen par nahin giraanaa chahie, kyonki aisi asaavadhaaniyon se chumbakon kii shakti mand pad jaati he tathaa anaavashyak rup se unke punarchumbakan kii aavashyaktaa pad jaati he
 Similarly, children should not be allowed to play with magnets
 8
 shaktishaalee chumbak lagane ke do ghante baad tak nahaana nahin chahie
 For this reason, it has been said that magnetic therapy should be done after bath in the morning
 9
 chumbakon ko yathasambhav lohe ke dibbe yaa almaari main na rakhen, lakdi kii peti yaa aisa hi koi saadhan pasand karen

 tapas yaa tap kaa mul arth tha prakaash athwa prajvalan jo surya yaa agni main spasht hota he
 But gradually, his orthodoxy developed and the somatic suffering that was taken for the attainment of a particular purpose or for spiritual and physical discipline began to be called austerity
 vastav main tapas kii bhaavana kaa vikaas chaar purushartho or chaar ashramon ke siddhant ke vikaas kaa parinaam tha
 All these thoughts are from the later Vedic era and if there is no special mention of austerities in the Rigveda, then it is not surprising
 haan tapas kaa vah swaroop, jo tantric or guhyak hota he tathaa jiskaa uddeshy duusare ko haani pahunchaana athwa duusare ke akraman se apane ko bachaana hota he, anarya tatwon se shudra avashya prabhavit prathit hota he
 Originally, a monk who wanted to attain salvation was engaged in penance
 brahamnon or upanishdon main uski charchaayen milane lagati hai or brahm kii prapti uskaa uddeshy ho jaataa he
 All renunciation was considered necessary for him and it was understood that in order to be free from the shackles of traffic in the world, not only disinterest, moral life is also necessary
 at: jivan ke sabhi sukhon kaa tyaag hi nahin, sharir ko anek prakaar se jalaana athwa ksht dena bhi prarambh ho gaya
 Some foreign scholars consider the ideas contained in austerities as not Arya and Vedic, as the gift of non-vedic tribals
 kintu yah sahi nahin prathit hota
 The non-aryan and non-vedic elements gradually absorbed into the Shudra class of the Vedic society, which the leaders of the ancient religion and society did not give the right to penance
 vipareet aacharan karne vaale shanbuk jaise tapasvi shudra to dandit bhi hue
 If the ideology of tapas had started with those non-human elements, then this situation would have been impossible
 uddeshyon kii bhinnata se tapasya ke anek prakaar or rup maane gaye
 Vidhyadhyayi Brahmachari, son of a householder desirous of wealth and spiritual pleasures, a seeker of God, absorbed in Brahman and inspired by desire for salvation, a saintly man or woman seeking love, a devotee in God and the Goddess seeking the grace of God, the common man, self-righteousness and ordinary religion Many types of people, who follow ordinary people, meditate in different forms The Sinddhant believe and use it
 tapas kii pravriti kaa centre tha sharir ko ksht dena
 The more multiple forms or stiffness of it, the more the climax of tapas is considered
 saadhaaran tapasvi wo vatkaladasan, bhutishaiya, alpaahar, jatajutdhaaran, nakhvriddhi, vedoccharan, yajyakriyaatmakataa or dayalutaa ke abhyaas maatr tak simit rahata tha, kintu ugr tapasvi garmi kii ritu main panchagni, varsha main khulaavaas, jaade main jalanivaas athwa bhiige kapadon ko pahinakar baahar rahanaa, teen samay snaan, kandamulashan, bhikshatan, basti se dur nivas or sharir ke sabhi sukhon ko tyaag kar use ksht dena tapasya kaa lakshan mana jane laga
 Parvati's penance is the prime example to achieve Shiva
 yahi nahin, ek mudra se, yatha--haathon ko uthaae rakhana, chalate rahanaa athwa isi prakaar ke anya rupakon kaa dhaaran- kuch dinon athwa jivan bhar banaae rakhana tam kii paraakaashtha samajhi jane lagi
 Even today many such ascetic and hathayogis will meet in all corners of India, especially in pilgrimage, ashrams, river banks and mountains
 sarsaadhaaran varg or kabhi kabhi to subodh kintu vishwasi or shraddhalu samaaj bhi, aise tapasviyon kaa aadar karata rahaa he tathaa unamem kisi atimanviya athwa aadhyatmik shakti ke pratishthit hone main vishwaas bhi karata rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say how much faith the intellectual class with critical intelligence has placed on him
 paashchaatya deshon ke log yah maan lete hai ki paurvatyon main kshtsahan or shaarikik taap ko angeekrut kar lene kii aseem kshamta he or ve paradheenata, bhautik atyaachaar or anyaay ke pratikaar main apane ko ksht dekar usase upar uthne athwa bachane kii koshish karte hai
 For this reason from the mind of Shopenhaar, a pessimism and sadism was born in the countries of the East, whose characteristics were the renunciation of the world, the renunciation, the saintly life, the torture of the body and the unnatural and amnological tendency of suppression of desires
 kintu aisa lagata he ki ye vichaarak bhartiya jivan ke lakshyon main arth kaam kii siddhi ke peeche us pravritimulak manovaigyanik or shuddh bhautik vishleshan kaa utana dhyaan nahin karte, jitna nivrittimulak moksh ke bhav or uski prapti ke upayon kaa
 Accordingly, the social analysis of tenacity found in Manusmriti is a concern
 tadnusaar chaaturvarnyon kaa tap dharamshastra vihit unka karmmaatr he, yatha brahman ke dwaara gyaan kii prapti, kshatriya ke dwaara samaaj kii raksha, vaisya ke dwaara krishi, goraksha or vaanijya tathaa shudra ke dwaara dwijatiyon kii seva
 From the social point of view, this religion - performing its duties - was the most important tenacity
 bhagavadgita main to tap or sanyas ke darshanik paksh kaa sarvattam swaroop dikhaai detaa he or uske shareerik, vaachik or maansik tathaa satvik, rajasi or taamasi prakaar bataae gaye hai
 Physical asceticism is rooted in deva, dvij, guru and non-violence, recitative tapa is from anudegkara vani, truth and loving speech and self-study and mental austerity is proved by happiness, gentleness, self-realization and sentimentation of the mind
 iske saath hi uttam tam to he satvik jo shraddhapurvak fal kii ichha se virakt hokar kiya jaataa he
 On the contrary, the princely penance or foolishness which is done for hospitality, honor and worship, by giving many problems to oneself to torment another, is not ideal
 spasht he, bhartiya tapas main jivan ke shaashvat mulyon kii prapti ko hi sarvocch sthaan diya gaya he or nishkaam karm uskaa sabase bada maarg mana gaya he

 Being rubbed with both hands and extinguishing the fire, my hands became black and blisters

 Stop in the ghee, he will allow you to enjoy the benefits of good fortune for a long period of time, and he will make every Sahbha Burjgi to be his old age and if you turn your back, i am afraid of a great day's glory about you

 Let children wrap knows that hidden Khhuda and blatantly do it Not that he even knows the secret of sines and there is no one on the ground who does not have the responsibility of livelihood and himself also knows the location of his whereabouts and his handing over, everything is present in the book of light and He is the one who created the pride and the land in 6 days, and his joy was on the water, so that he could make you try who is going to have a better car
 And you will say that after you die, all of you will be raised again, then the Kafir people will surely say that this is just open magic and if we delay in counting on them for a few days of counting, then these people will definitely say Listen to what is stopping the Azab, the day it strikes them, their locks will not stop and the people who used to laugh at them will surround them in every way and if we His mercy fun Ckhaaà¥ then shall we take away from the course larger Beas And it becomes heartbreaking and if after the trouble that she had reached, she tasted relief and comfort, then surely she starts saying that now all the strictures have been lost to me, not that it is a bad hawk but people who have patience They have done good work and these are the people for whom there is a lot of money and a lot of wages, then what you have sent through 'the same', you should not worry about it
 You are going to give up and you are hard hearted that these people will tell you why they have not been treasured or any angel has come with them, then you are just afraid you should not take care of them and everything else Is it responsible?

 Do not be lying in a, Unquestionable, this Quran is an affront to your family, but many people do not bring Iman, and who will be so much more jealous than those who are lying on their own, they will be worshiped in the presence of their family and the witnesses will express that they are the people Those who had tied up in their families, hear that God has a right to oppress those who stop people from the path of God and he They want to remove kazi and the same people are also suspicious of the end, these people can not beat god in the ruined land and neither will they have any patron except for God, they will neither be heard nor seen
 These are the people who have done their own losses and the people who used to do it if they will do it, will not leave it, it is not that these people will be the big losers in the end

 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke ÏÎµÎºÏÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he
 The term plate was first used by Canadian geologist Wilson and the term plate tectonics was first used by Morgan
 is siddhant ke anusaar prithvi kii upree parat ke rup main sthit sthalmandal, jisamen crust or upree mantal kaa kuch hissaa shaamil he, kai tukdon main vibhajit he jinhen plate kaha jaataa he
 Generally, the number of large plates in these plates is considered seven
 iske alaava kuch majhale or chote aakaar kii plates bhi hai
 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100
 parvat nirmaan ke sandarbh main prathamatya do mat prachlit the, urdhwadhar sanchalan dwaara or kshaitij sanchalan dwaara
 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains
 sankuchanavaadiyon ko pehali chunauti tabhi mili thi jab mahadwipon ke kshaitij sthaanantaran kii sankalpana kaa udbhav hua
 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other
 angrez darshanik francis bekan ne pehali baar sateek nakshon ke adhyayan se yah samanta chihnit kii, maanchitr vigyaani abraham ortalius ne 1596 main pehali baar yah kaha ki america europe or africa se tut kar alag hue hai or german dharamshastri theodor lilonethal ne 1756 main ortalius ke kathan kii pushti bible ke ek kathan ke aadhaar par karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908â10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue
 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate
 mudakar neeche kii ore kshepit hone vaala yah hissaa gaharaai main ja kar taap or daab kii adhikta ke kaaran pighalkar megma main parivartit hota he
 The depth at which this event occurs is known as the tiller zone or Benioff zone
 aise kinaaron ke sahare bhusannatiyon ke padaarth dabaav ke kaaran mudakar parvaton kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Going down, the molten material rises up as a magma plume and also produces volcanism
 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai

nibandha lalitnibandhasch Prithvi Narayan Shah was the king of Nepal who expanded the small Gorkha kingdom of Kathmandu Upatika
 mall rajvansh ke andar kai bhaagon main bikhare nepal ko unhone ekatrit kiya or mall rajvansh kaa shashan samaapt hua
 Prithvi Narayan Shah is considered the father of modern Nepal
 unhone hi nepal ke ekikaran abhiyaan kii shuruuaat kii thi
 Prithvinarayan Shah was the son of King Narbhupal Shah and Rani Kausalyavati who was the ruler of a small kingdom called Gorkha
 unka janm bi san 1779 me hua tha, unhe bees varsh kii umr main bi san 1799 me gorkha kaa raja banaaya gaya tha
 Even before Prithvi Narayan Shah, Nepal was united in different periods of history
 jaise yaksha mall, mani mukunda sen, va jumlaa ke jitari mall raja ke samay
 But then these kings had divided Nepal into several parts after unification and divided it among their sons
 lekin prithvi narayan shah ne nepal ko phir se bantne nahi diya
 Preserved Nepal as a unified nation and kept expanding its borders
 parantu san 1775 main 52 varsh ke aayu main inkaa nidhan ho jane ke kaaran nepal kaa ekikaran abhiyaan ruk gaya
 Later his sons Bahadur Shah and daughter-in-law Rajendra Lakshmi gave continuity to the integration campaign
 lekin inke parpote girvana vikram shah ke samay main hue nepal-angrej yuddh main nepal ne apni sarbhabhaumikta kii raksha to kar lee parantu nepal ke ek bade bhaag ko british east india company ko dena padaa
 Bishal before 1816 included parts of present-day Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Sikkim and Darjeeling in Nepal
 iskaa kshetrafal lagbhag 3,34250 varg kimi tha
 After the Sugauli Treaty with the British, Nepal remained confined from the Mechi River in the east to the Kali River in the west
 us sandhi main angrejo ne nepal kaa tarai bhu-bhaag bhi le liya tha jo 1822 or 1860 main do kishton main nepal ko pun: lautaa diya
 Unnayak of Prithvi Narayan Shah Nath sect, a well-known poet of Hindi, was not only a great devotee of Yogi Gorakhnath, the great guardian of Hindu culture and religion in North India, but was also a good poet of Hindi himself
 unke bhajan abhi bhi radio nepal se praaia: sunai padate hai
 For example, one of his hymns is presented here- park 1 tower e ek nirmaanadhin gaganchumbi imaarat he
 The birth of psychoanalysis, Dr
 Sigmund Freud, termed the son's sexuality to his mother as the Oedipus gland
 frid ke anusaar idipas kii yah katha har manushya ke antar main chhipi hui kamvasana kii ek granthi kaa sankethik pratinidhaan karti he
 The goal of man's first sexual desire is the mother and the first target of violence and hatred is the father
 isi kamvasana kii bhavagranthi ko inhone idipas granthi ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Talking about its effects on human life, he said that this gland is working in the background of our moral, religious and social rules and restrictions
 paap or aparaadh kii bhaavana kaa janm isi se hua
 Feelings of self-infliction, suicide or self-punishment are generated due to this
 inke anusaar manushya ke vikaas kii jad main yah granthi hi he kyonki vikaas ke prarambh main manushyon ne sarvapratham apane upar keval do pratibandh lagaae
 First, not to kill your father or father and second, not to marry your mother or mother
 yahi do pratham naitik or dharmik niyam hai
 He also considered the Oedipus Psychology to be the root cause of any kind of mental deformity and mainly psychopathology
 inkaa kathan tha ki yah granthi saamaanya or asaamaanya donon hi prakaar ke vyaktiyon main pai jaati he, antar keval itnaa he ki ek ne usapar vijay praapt kar lee he or isliye vah saamaanya he jabaki doosraa uskaa das he or isliye vah asaamaanya he
 The root cause of the differences and conflicts of different groups, castes and societies is also the difference of the suffixes established towards their parents, it was their idea
 ek hi vastu ke prati prem or ghrinaa ke vipareet bhaavon ke vidyaman hone kaa kaaran bhi inhone 'idipas granthi' ko hi mana
 Our emotional life was fundamentally unfamiliar with the inclusion of such contrary sentiments towards the same object
 sarvapratham aise bhaavon kii utpatti sambhavat: mata pita ke prati hamaare samvegatmak sambandhon se hi hoti he kyonki inkaa prabalatam rup mata pita ke prati bhaavon main hi paaya jaataa he
 The feelings of love towards mother and hatred towards father are sometimes called positive Oedipus gland and love towards father and hatred towards mother is called negative Oedipus gland
 is granthi kaa ek swaroop putree kaa pita ke prati kamvasana kii bhaavana bhi paaya jaataa he jise electra granthi kaha jaataa he
 In opposition to Freud's assertion that the Oedipus gland is universal, its basis is inborn and it is found in every human being in the same form, neo-freudian and other modern theories stated that its basis is considered culture, that is its form It is determined by different people
 fenichal ke anusaar vyakti ke apane paariwarik anubhav hi uski is granthi kii utpatti or uske vaastavik swaroop kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Adler did not consider this gland to be original or inborn, but he said that it is an unnatural result of the mother's more pampered love
 jung ke anusaar yah granthi manushya kii punarjanm kii moulik ichha kaa sankethik pratinidhaan karti he arthath manushya kii moulik ichha apane janmasthan main laut jane kii hoti he
 While admitting this imaginary flight of Jung, Rank also said that the essence of this gland is in the child's entire relationship to his parents
 paariwarik sambandhon kii mahatta ko sweekaar karte hue harney ne ise do sthitiyon par aadhaarit bataaya
 The first situation is the provocative lusts of the parents and the second is the anxiety arising out of the need to be dependent on others and the mental duality of violent feelings towards the parents
 frome ne pitaputra ke bich is sangharsh kaa aadhaar kamvasana na maanakar pitrupradhan samaajon kii adhikaar praapt karne kii bhaavana mana he
 Other scholars like Sullivan, Tamson etc
 have also considered mutual relations within the family as the basis of this gland
