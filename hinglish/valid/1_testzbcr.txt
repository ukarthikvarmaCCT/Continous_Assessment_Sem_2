 In fact, Burrows, as the author of Tarzan of the Apes, describes both Clayton and Greystoke by fictitious names — implying that the fictional world in which Tarzan lives may have a different real name

 He loves his wife very much and is completely devoted to her; In many situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan ignores them politely but not with firmness

 In contrast to these great features, Tarzan's philosophy embraces the extreme form of "returning to nature"

 While another Tarzan of the Apes has faced critical success, the subsequent books in the series were better welcomed and criticized for being derivative and formulaic
 paatro ko aksar dwi-aiami bataaya gaya he, inke samvaad or kahani bataane vaale upkarnon par kahin na kahin tanaav bana hua he
 According to author Rudyard Kipling, Burrows wrote Tarzan of the Apes only to "find out how bad a book he can write and how far he can go with it
" halanki baroj ek manje hue upanyaaskaar nahin hai, ve ek jwalanth kahanikar hai or unke kai upanyaas abhi bhi chap rahen hai
 In 1963, writer Gore Vidal wrote on the Tarzan series that, while pointing to the work of literature such as the many shortcomings found in the Tarzan books, he praised Edgar Rice Burrows, because he "made this daylike dream figure"
 Is depicted live
 kaaphi aalochana ke baad bhi tarzan kii kahaniyaan lokapriy bani hui hai
 Burroughs's state of theatricality in his fictional world and detailed descriptions of his work, such as the making of partial language for his great apes, draw fans to him
 jis samay main tarzan kii pustakon or filmon ko likhaa gaya, ve ek saamaanya ansh tak vyapak roodhiwaadita ko darshaati hai
 This gave rise to criticism in later years, with which social ideas and practices changed, including racism since the 1970s

 However, Burrows never loses distaste in European grandeur
 baroj kii raay, kahaniyon kii kathatmak aawaaj main abhivyakt hoti he, jo unke samay ke saamaanya vyavhaar ko pratibimbit karti he, jo 21 veen sadi sandarbh main jatvaad or sabase zyada sexit mana jayega
 However Thomas F
 Bartonew writes of Burrows "the feminist concept that elevates women to the level of men and — characters that appear in the deranged stories of Barsom novels or in novels — expresses the feminine type that a housewife Desperate as he is, he is neither a middle-level careerist office manager, nor an ideal professor, but who in his real humanity Crosses all boundaries and advises her faded in doing so
 " The author is not particularly enthusiastic in his approach

 She closes on a chapter in the 1912 Tarzan of the Apes because the story's protagonist, according to her, is a standard male one of the 1912 white Americans
 bedermen ke anusaar tarzan, "ek vibhedit rup se rajput angreji" he, jo langik hinsa main lipt nahin he, "balaatkaar karne ke maradaana aaveg" kaa tyaag karata he
 However, she also notes that Tarzan not only kills the black male Kulonga to avenge the murder of his monkey mother, but also hangs him, "linchar Tarzan really enjoys killing black people , For example the cannibal Mbongan
 In fact, Bederman reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane by calling him "tarzan" and calling himself a wild Anvron and tells many black men of the killer
 " In the novel's climax, Tarzan rescues Jane — who is not British in the original novel but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland — from a black apes rapist

 "he has probably never heard of any of them
 "iske bajaay, bedermen likhte hai ki baroj apane bindu ko sabit karti hai kyonki un jativaadee or sexi kahaniyon ko bataane main jinamein kaale logon ko maarane par jor diya gaya he, vah bilkul bhi asaamaanya nahin tha, lekin iske bajaay sirf 1912 kaa ek praroopik shwet america tha
 After Baroz's death, many writers created new Tarzan stories without his estate's permission
 kuch udaahranon main, aise anaadhikrut kaam ke prakaashan par estate ke dwaara roak laga di gayi
 The most notable exception to this was the result of five novels by the pseudonym "breton Varper" in the United States, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc
 a legal action was taken by the latter, after which they were removed from the market and the remaining copies were destroyed

 Taking official permission was not considered appropriate
 In stories based on Tarzan in contemporary Africa, his battle with Mau Mau has been a popular subject in 1950s Kenya and at times he crushes his rebel with one hand

 These brochures on Tarzan were very popular among Israeli youth in their time, with the numerous hebrew translations of the original Tarzan novels, the influence of the brochure on Tarzan began to diminish in the mid-1960s, with copies now available in the market
 Books used in Israel are sold at high prices in the market
