 Cobb returned in December 1909 and presented details of his Asian trip that year

 Cobb assigns a man named Steer to travel to Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and possibly other countries whose responsibility was on Cobb
 hoder and stafaton is udhyam se baahar nikal gaya lekin oupi ne aage badhkar isamen apana yogadan diya
 Steer's visit was a disaster, and Milford stated in sad words that the trip proved to be 'quite expensive and far less fruitful' than all the passengers' trips
 Steer returned before completing more than half of his itinerary, and while returning he failed to return his customers' payments resulting in the press losing a hefty Â£ 210
 The press was forced to pay 80 per cent of the value of its books as an 'incidental expense', so they suffered losses despite getting enough orders
 In fact some orders were received from the trip itself, and when the steer's nominal box was returned, the London office discovered that they had not been opened from the second layer downwards

 Before the twentieth century, Oxford's press occasionally printed a piece of music or a book about music
 isane 1899 main da yatendan himanal bhi prakashit kiya tha or percy dearmar or us samay kaaphi had tak agyaat ralf vughan williams ke sampadakatv main 1906 main prakashit da english himanal kaa pehla sanskaran adhik mahatvapurn tha
 The Oxford History of Music containing several volumes of Sir William Henry Haddo appeared between 1901 and 1905
 haalanki is tarah sangeet prakaashan udhyam bahut kam the: "unnisvin sadi main oxford main is vichaar ko mahatv nahin diya jaataa tha ki sangeet kisi arth main shaikshik ho sakati he" or kuch pratinidhi yaa purv prakaashak khud sangeet se sambandhit the yaa unki prishthbhumi kaaphi had tak sangeet se sambandhit thi
 However, Milford enjoyed music in the London office and was particularly concerned with the world of church and church musicians
 1921 main mileford ne huebert je

 In that work Foss introduced his energy and imagination
 haalanki satakliff ke anusaar ek saadhaaran sangeetkaar or pratibhashali pianovadak ke rup main phos "kii ruchi khaas taur se shiksha main nahin thi; sangeet main unki gahari ruchi thi
 Milford probably considered it less related to music than education when Fos reported to Milford about plans to publish a group of composers of well-known musicians on composers of frequently played radio
 Will happen
 There is no clear record of the thought process by which the press may have ventured into the field of music publishing
 Foss's presence and his knowledge, abilities, enthusiasm and imagination may have served as a catalyst in Milford's mind, giving rise to several unrelated activities that gave rise to another new venture, like the establishment of overseas branches
 ho saktaa he ki mileford ko puri tarah yah baat samaj main nahin ai hogi ki vah kya kar rahe the
 The booklet, published in 1973 by the Music Department on the fiftieth anniversary, shows that OUP "had no knowledge of the music trade and had no representative to sell his compositions in his music shops, and it seems likely that he Also, there was no illusion that sheet music was in any way a separate thing from books
 " haalanki mileford ne jaanboojhkar yaa anjaane main teen kadam uthaae jisase oupi ne ek pramukh kaary kaa shubharambh kiya
 He purchased the anglo-french Music Company and all its centers, related goods and resources

 And in 1923 he set up a separate effects music department with offices in Amen House and Faus was the first music editor
 uske baad saamaanya samarthan ke alaava mileford ne phos ko bade paimaane par unke apane upkarnon ke hawaale kar diya
 Foss responded with incredible energy
 unhone "sabase kam sambhavit samay main sabase badi sambhavit suchi" kaa nirmaan kiya or lagbhag 200 sheershak prati varsh kii dar se usamen sheershakon shaamil karnaa shuru kar diya; aath saal baad us suchi main 1750 sheershak the
 In the year of the founding of the department, Foss began producing a series of inexpensive but well edited and printed choreographers under the title "oxford Choral Songs"

 ji
 whittekar ke saamaanya sampadakatv main yah shrinkhalaa pustak rup main yaa adhyayan ke bajaay sangeet ke prakaashan ke liye oupi kii pehali vachanabaddhata thi
 The series plan was expanded to include similar inexpensive but high-quality "oxford Church Music" and "tudor Church Music"; All of these series continue to this day

 isi tarah percy scoles kii lisners guide tu mujeec ko aam janata ko sunaane ke liye sangeet prashansa par aadhaarit pustakon kii ek shrinkhalaa main se pehali shrinkhalaa ke rup main nae vibhaag main prastut kiya gaya tha
 Scholes' continuing works designed for OUP to keep pace with the development of broadcast and recorded music and his other works in the field of journalistic music criticism would later be widely integrated and abstracted into the Oxford Companion to Music
 shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki phos ko shaayad un rachanaaon ke nae sangeetkaaron kii talash karne kii aadat thi jin rachanaaon ko vah vishisht rup se angrezi sangeet kii manyata dete the jo janata ko adhik priy thi
 As a result of this concentration, OUP received two mutually reinforcing advantages: a chance to enter the field of music publishing while remaining occupied by potential competitors, and a branch for music performance and production that until now was largely ignored by the British themselves
 Was being done hinels ke prastaav eke mutabik kaaphi had tak agyaat vanijyik sambhaavnaaon vaale sangeet ke kshetra main sangeet vibhaag kaa aarambhik "chaatravrutti evam saanskrithik rashtrawaad mishran" isaki saanskrithik paroapkaar kii bhaavana or "german mukhyadhara ke baahar rashtriya sangeet" ko badhaava dene kii ichha se prerit tha
 As a result, Foss began actively promoting the work and expressed a desire to publish music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, Constant Lambert, Alan Rawthorne, Peter Warlock, Edmund Rubbra and other English composers
 jis sandarbh main press ko "aadhunik sangeet ke itihaas ke sabase tikaoo sajjan samjhauta" kaha gaya us sandarbh main phos ne aisi kisi bhi sangeet ke prakaashan kii guarantee di jise vughan williams unhen pradaan karnaa chahenge
 iske alaava, phos ne oupi ke keval sangeet ke prakaashan or jeevant pradarshan ke adhikaron ko hi nahin balki recording or broadcast ke "yantric" adhikaron ko bhi surakshit karne kii disha main kadam uthaaya
 yah baat puri tarah se spasht nahin thi ki us samay yah sab kitna mahatvapurn sabit hua hoga
 In fact, Foss, OUP, and many musicians had previously refused to join or support the Performing Right Society, because they feared that such fees would have a bad impact on such performances in new media
 In later years it was observed that such music, on the contrary, proved to be more attractive than the traditional sites of music publishing
 sangeet kii peshkash ke pariman or vistaar kii drushti se or sangitagnon or aam janata donon ke dilon main isaki pratishtha kii drushti se sangeet ke vibhaag ne chaahe jaisaa bhi vikaas kiya ho, 1930 ke dashak main aakhirkaar vittiya pratifal kaa sawaal sabase pramukh tha
 As a London publisher, Milford gave his full support to the music department over the years of its creation and development
 haalanki un par lagaataar hone vaale kharchon se chintit oxford ke pratinidhiyon kaa dabaav badhane laga jo unhen ek laabhhin udhyam lag rahaa tha
 According to him, the operation of Amen House was educationally honorable and financially beneficial
 landan karyaalay "shiksha ko badhaava dene ke kharch ke liye cleyarendon press ke liye paisa kamaane ke strot ke rup main bana rahaa
" iske alaava, oupi apane pustak prakashnon ko alpakaaleen pariyojnaayen maanata tha: prakashit hone ke kuch varshon ke bheetar na bikne vaali kisi bhi pustak ko bazaar se waapas mangava liya jaataa tha 
 iske vipareet, pradarshan ke liye sangeet par sangeet vibhaag kaa dabaav apekshaakrit dirghakaalin or nirantar tha jo khaas taur iskaa kaaran yah tha ki isse hone vaala aay baar-baar ke prasaaran yaa recording se praapt hota tha or isliye kyonki yah nae or aagaamee sangitagnon ke saath apane rishte ko banane main laga hua tha
 The delegates did not agree with Foss's view: "I still think that the word 'loss' is a false word: is it not really an investment of capital?" This sentence was written by Foss to Milford in 1934
 is prakaar 1939 tak sangeet vibhaag main kisi bhi varsh koi munafa nahin dikhaai diya
 By then, the economic pressures of the recession, as well as the internal pressures to reduce spending, and possibly the academic background of the Oxford parent body, together gave rise to oup's primary music business, whose mainstay of publishing compositions was formal music education and music appreciation
 Which in a way was an effect of broadcasting and recording itself
 yah british skulon kii sangeet shiksha kii sahaayak samagriyon kii badhati maang ke saath acchhee tarah se mail kha rahaa tha jo 1930 ke dashak main shiksha ke kshetra main sarkari sudhaaron kaa parinaam tha
 The press did not stop searching for new musicians and their music and publishing them, but the nature of business had changed
 vyaktigat swasthya samasyaon se peedit or aarthik baadhaon or kagaz kii kami se tang aakar or da blitz se bachane ke liye landan ke sabhi kaary-sanchaalan tantron ko oxford sthanantarit kiye jane se bahut zyada naaraaz hokar, phos ne 1941 main apane pad se istipha de diya or unki jagah peterkin ko rakhaa gaya
 OUP has also been a major publisher of academic journals in both the fields of science and humanity

 From around the 13th century onwards, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, "sant Mat" was a loosely connected group of gurus that gained much fame
 dharm brahm vigyaan ke taur par unki shikshaaon kii visheshta yah he ki ve antarmukhi or prem bhakthi ke ek divine siddhant se jude hai or saamaajik rup se ve ek samtawadi gunon vaale siddhant se jude hai jo hindu dharm kii jati pratha ke viruddh he or hindu - muslim ke antar ke bhi viruddh he
 The saint tradition can be broadly divided into two groups: Punjab, the northern group of saints of the region who expressed themselves mainly in colloquial Hindi and the southern group whose language is ancient Marathi and is represented by Namdev and other saints from Maharashtra
 
 'sant mat' kaa arth he - 'santon kaa maarg', 'satya kaa maarg', 'sahi or ashaavadi path' yaa 'santon kii raay'
 'sant' shabd sanskrit kii dhaatu 'sad' se bana he or kai prakaar se prayog haa he 
 iskaa mul arth he 'satya jaanane vaala' yaa 'jisane antim satya anubhav kar liya ho
 The meaning of the word "saint" is generally taken from a good person, but its special meaning is taken only from the saint poets of medieval India
 sant mat andolan ekarup nahin tha or isamen santon kaa apana saamaajik-dharmik vyavhaar shaamil tha jo ki hajaar varsh pehle bhagavadgita main varnit bhakthi par aadhaarit tha
 He shared some of his own traditions with each other and followers of the traditions he challenged
 is prakaar sant mat vishisht dharmik parampara ke bajaay aadhyatmik vyaktitvon kaa aisa vividhtapurna samooh prathit hota he jo ek saamaanya aadhyatmik mul ko sweekaar karata he
 The boundaries of this movement were probably not sectarian and it did not even have Brahmin concepts of caste and method of worship
 sant kaviyon ne apni vaani bolchaal kii bhashaa main likhe kavy main kahi jo unhone hindi or marathi jaisi sthaneey bhashaaon main saamaanya jan ko sambodhit kii
 He called the name Ishwar a true protector and rejected religious values as priceless
 unhone is vichaar ko sthapit kiya ki dharm, ishwar ke prati samarpan kaa vishay he jo ki hriday main basataa he

 sant mat parampara ke anusaar ramanand vaishnav sadhu the jinhone kabir, ravidaas or anya santon ko naam daan diya
 The tradition of Ramanandi monks tells the story of Ramananda differently by other saints and later Sikhs
 itani jaankaree milti he ki ramanand ne sabhi jatiyon se shishy sweekaar kiye, yah ek aisa tathy he jiskaa roodhiwaadee hinduon ne us samay virodh kiya tha
 The followers of Sant Mat believe that Ramananda's disciples prepared the first generation of saints
 in santon ne ek sankruti kaa vikaas kiya jo samaaj main haashie par pade manushyon ke nikat thi jisamen mahilaayein, dalit, achhut or atishudra shaamil the
 Some of the more famous saints include Namdev, Kabir, Nanak, Surdas, Meera Bai, Tulsidas and Tukaram
 
 The tradition of saints has been non-denominational, although many saint poets are believed to have established their sects
 inamen se kaiyon ke naam ke saath sant judaa he lekin unke shishyon ne aage chal kar kabir panth, dadu panth, dariyaa panth, advait mat, aadhyatmikta kaa vigyaan or radhaswami jaise panth chalaae
 Only a minority of religious Hindus have formally followed the saintly faith
 parantu is parampara kaa sabhi sampradaayon or jatiyon par bahut prabhaav pada he
 The hymns of bygone saints like Meera Bai are widely heard in Hindu castes in India and around the world
 madhyakaalin or aadhunik bharat main keval sant parampara hi he jisane safaltaapurvak hindu or muslim simaaon ko todaa he
 Julius J
 Lipner has asserted that the religious teachings of saints have uplifted the lives of many Hindus and called her a freedom fighter
 sant mat parampara main jinda guru ko mahatv diya jaataa he jise satguru yaa 'purna guru' jaise sammaan suchak shabdon ke saath sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 There is believed to be a lot of similarity between medieval Sufi poets such as Jalal al-din Mohammed Rumi and Sindhi poets and saintly poets
 uttar bharat kaa radhaswami andolan apane aap ko santamat panrapara or dharmik prayaas kaa mukhya nidhaan maanata he or swayan ko sant parampara ke jivit avatar kii bhaanti prastut karata he
 The most notable is the Radhaswami Satsang Beas, which is situated on the banks of the Beas River and whose current living Guru is Gurinder Singh

 Lane has described Fakir's statement of 'not knowing' as 'chandian influence' concerning the manifestation of Baba Fakir Chand's divine form
 fakir ne ise anuyaayiyon ke man kaa hi khel kaha or rup prakat hone ko maaya bataaya
 This breaks many assumptions of saintliness

 It is located in the northwestern part of the country on the banks of the Meikong River, which also determines the international border of Laos with Thailand at this location
 "vyinchan" kaa naam buddha dharm kii dharmik bhashaa pali se utpann hua he, jo ek hind-arya bhashaa thi
 In this, "vyin" means "city" in Lao language while "chan" is thought to have emerged from the Sanskrit word "chandan", meaning "vyachan" meant "city of sandal"
 pracheen lao shila-abhilekh bhi is baat kii pushti karte hai
 Many Lao people in modern times also believe that "chan" actually originated from the Sanskrit word "chandra", meaning the name of the city is "city of the moon"
 yah isliye hua he kyonki sanskrit ke "chandra" va "chandan" donon kaa aadhunik lao bhashaa main sankshipti uccharan "chan" hi he
 But the city has been written by ancient Thai language sources as "à¹à¸§à¸µà¸¢à¸à¸à¸±à¸à¸à¸à¹" and Khmer language sources in Cambodia have written "à¤¦à¥à¤¨à¥à¤", both of which mean "sandalwood", so "sandalwood city" was probably the right meaning

 Rawal is a Brahmin community resident of Sirohi, Pali, Jalore districts of Rajasthan

 This title was given to Brahmins who settled in Sirohi district of Rajasthan

 Similarly, a class of Brahmins who migrated from Siddhapura, known as Rohitpur, the name of Rohitpur, son of Harishchandra, who later became known as Roadwall Brahmins, merged a group of them into the Rawal Brahmin community known as Krishnatraya

 There is no mention of caste called Rawal Brahman anywhere, but the word Rawal is a manifestation of stuck, Rawal means the king of the king is called Rawal

 kintu pehle kii yuktiyaan shakti utpaadan kii drushti se vyaavhaarik nahin thim
 Later, their design was greatly improved by which they emerged as major sources of mechanical power during the Industrial Revolution

 The earliest mention of the effort to make steam engines is found in the writings of the Hero of Alexandria
 hero us vikhyath alaxandreey sampradaay schwÃ¶r bei koranka sadsy tha jisamen tolemi, euclid, iretosthanij jaise tatkaaleen vigyaan ke maharathi sammilit the
 In his article, Hero describes a device in which air was heated in a closed box and circulated down a pipe passage to a water-filled vessel
 isamen bartan kaa pani duusari nalee main chadhataa tha or ek nakli phuhaaraa ban jaataa tha
 Then after this, no details are found in this regard
 1606 i
 main, hero se lagbhag 2,000 varsh baad, nepolian academy ke sansthaapak or tatkaaleen europe main vigyaan ke agrani netaa marxev dela porta ne hero ke phuharevaale prayog main hawa kii jagah bhaap kaa upyog kiya
 He also suggested that in order to fill a vessel with water, it should be connected to a pond with water by a tube and then after filling steam in that vessel and then cooling it with water from above, the inner steam condensed Vacuum will generate and instead the water from the pond will be filled in the vessel
 1698 i
 main marxev dela porta ke is suzav kaa upyog tamas severy ne pani chadhaane kii ek mashin main kiya
 Thus Savory was the first person to create a steam engine for commercial use, which was used to pump water from the mines and to drain water from the wells
 severy ke ingine ke avishkaar ke baad bhaap ingine kaa aglaa charan newcomen ingine kaa avishkaar tha
 It was invented by Thomas Newcomen
 is ingine kaa khadaanon or kuon se pani nikaalane main 50 varshon tak upyog hota rahaa
 It also has historical significance, because this opened the way for James Watt's inventions
 is ingine main pehali baar silinder or piston kaa upyog kiya gaya jo ab tak bhaap injanon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Steam in the newcomen engine is only used to generate vacuum
 piston uthaane kaa kaam, jisase pani chadhataa he, vayumandaleey daab karata he
 But it only takes a lot of fuel waste to condense the steam
 james wat kaa mahatvapurn kaary bhaap ingine ko sarvshereshth rup dena he jisase manushya kii shakti das guni bad gai or vyavsaayik kshetra main brihad parivartan ho gaya
 James Watt was a clever scientific engineer in Glasgow and in 1763 he was ordered by a physics professor at the University of Glasgow to repair a Newcomen engine that never ran well
 marammat karke samay wat ko dhyaan aayaa ki isamen eendhan buree tarah se vyarth ho jaataa he
 Watt of thoughtful nature started the idea of making the best machine from it
 is prakaar unhone anek anveshan kiye or yantra banaae, jinase bhaap ingine ko uskaa vartmaan swaroop praapt hua or vah udyog or sabhyataa kii pragati main shaktishaalee saadhan bana
 The following are the main types of steam engines: ekakriya ingine main bhaap piston ke ek hi ore kaary karti he evam dvikriya ingine main bhaap piston ke donon ore kaary karti he
 If both these types of engines have the same condition in all other states, the power received by the two-way engine is twice the power received by the other type of engine
 yahi kaaran he ki in dinon ekakriya ingine kam hi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 The engine is called vertical or horizontal according to whether the cylinder's axis is vertical or horizontal
 kshaitij ingine urdhwadhar ingine se adhik jagah gherta he
 The vertical type engine has less friction etc
, due to which it can run for more days than horizontal engine
 bhaap ingine kii chaal vastut: iske crank shift parikraman prati minute kii chaal hoti he
 The average piston speed in an engine with four foot piston stroke and 80 revolutions per minute would be 640 feet per minute
 yah ingine nimna chaal ingine kaha jayega
 Generally, an engine running at a speed of less than 100 revolutions per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine running at a speed of more than 250 revolutions per minute is called a high speed engine
 100 or 250 parikraman prati minute ke bich kii chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko "madhyam chaal ingine" kehete hai
 The greatest quality of a high speed engine is that it is of very small size for equal power
 ucch chaal ke kaaran bhaap bhi kam hi kharch hoti he, kyonki is prakaar ke ingine main bhaap or silinder ke bich ooshmaa sthanantaran main bahut hi kam samay lagata he
 The compaction engine is a steam engine from which steam is discharged directly into the atmosphere and for this the pressure of steam in the cylinder should never be less than the pressure of the atmosphere
 sanghanan ingine main bhaap kaary karne ke baad sanghnitr main pravesh karti he evam vah vahaan vayumandal kii daab par jal main parivartit ho jaati he
 The behavior of the condenser allows steam to function more
 saral ingine main prayek silinder boyler se sidhe bhaap paata he evam sidhe vayumandal yaa sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 In a combustion engine, steam is transmitted to a lesser extent in a cylinder called a high pressure cylinder, and then to a larger cylinder, called a low pressure cylinder, and the propagation is complete here
 bahudhaa nimna daab silinder sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 Propagation can also take place in three or four cylinders and these engines are called triprasar engines or tetraspara engines
 ooshmaa ingine kii adhiktam dakshata / T1 hoti he jisamen T1 or T2 ooshmaa ingine chakra main adhiktam evam nunatam taap hai
 This suggests that the efficiency of the engine depends on both these temperatures
 bhaanp ingine kii dakshata utani hi badhati jaaegi jitani kaa mulya badhegaa evam kaa mulya ghatega
 To increase the value of steam, the pressure of steam coming into the engine from the boiler has to be increased, because the higher the pressure of steam, the higher the value
 ko badhaane kaa ek or upaay he
 That is superheating the steam
 atitapak kaa boyler main vyavhaar karke bhaap kaa adhitaap badhaayaa jaataa he
 To reduce the value of K, it becomes necessary to behave the condenser
 sanghnitr main thande jal dwaara bhaap jal main parivartit kii jaati he
 Therefore, the value of a good condenser can be equal to the temperature of cold water
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhaap ingine main adhik daab evam atitpt bhaap dwaara kaary karaane se evam kaary karaane ke baad bhaap ko sanghnitr main prapya thande jal ke taap ke baraabar taap par jal main parivartit karne se ingine adhik daksh hoga
 Steam from the boiler enters the steambox at high pressure
 piston jaise hi stroke ke ant main pahunchataa he, usee samay valve chalata he, jisamen bhapadwar khul jaataa he evam bhaap silinder main pravesh karti he
 The piston moves when pushed by steam pressure
 ise agr stroke kehete hai
 The crank, crank shaft and centrifuge move by piston movement
 utkendrak ke chalane se dwaar kuch or adhik khul jaataa he
 Steam continues to enter the cylinder until the door is closed
 is samay viched hota he evam iske baad silinder main bhaap kaa sambharan nahi ho paata
 The steam in the cylinder is now transmitted and in this expansion the volume of steam increases and the pressure decreases
 isi prakaar ke samay bhaap kaary karti he
 At the end of the front stroke, the valve opens the steam side towards the exhaust, releasing the steam
 nikali hui bhaap kii daab pasch daab ke baraabar ho jaati he
 After a few moments of release, the piston returns backward and is called the alternating stroke
 is stroke main lautate samay piston silinder main bachi hui bhaap kaa nikaas karata jaataa he
 When the piston reaches the end of this stroke, the valve closes the exhaust gate, stopping the flow of steam
 silinder sheersh or piston ke bich kuch bhaap batch jaati he, jo nirmukt nahin ho paati he
 Then the cycle is repeated
 dvikriya ingine main isi se sadrush chakra kii kriya silinder kii duusari ore hoti he
 The Rankin cycle is a theoretical cycle according to which the steam engine operates
 gati niamak kaa mukhya kaary ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karnaa he
 The speed-regulator of a steam engine keeps the speed of cruises constant with the help of these two methods: shakti kii maang ke anusaar bhaap kii daab ko badhaakar yaa ghataakar ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karanevaale gatiniamak ko avrodh gatiniamak kehete hai
 The actuator drives a barrier valve, which is placed in the main steam tube
 is prakaar ke gatiniamakon main mukhya gatipalak kanduk gatiniamak hota he
 The valve is of a balanced type, that is, the resultant force by the steam is zero
 jab ingine kii gati badhati he, gatiniamak kandukon ke paribhraman kii gati main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he, jisase kentrapasari bal bad jaataa he
 This increase of force forces them to move out against the forces of gravity and control
 iske chalate valve kuch ansh main band ho jaataa he
 The pressure of the steam acting on the piston decreases when the valve is blocked, which also reduces the power generated
 evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main vruddhi ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop gati badhkar saamaanya gati par aa jaati he
 a simple line will be obtained if the weight of the steam transferred per hour in the engine is measured with horsepower after the use of a regular steam engine by the barrier speed-regulator
 yah sambandh sarvapratham vilian ne paaya tha
 Hence, it is called "the line of Villian" in his name
 gatipalkachakr ko isha ke saath chaabi ke dwaara atakaya jaataa he
 Large propellants are fitted in low-speed carrier ships and these propellants make 80 revolutions per minute
 is tarah ke jahaajon main bhaap ingine bahut hi upyukt hai
 In high-speed vessels, steam turbines are being used instead of steam engines
 samudryaan main vyavhaar main laae janevaale bhaap ingine main triprasar prakaar ke ingine prasiddh hai
 The ship engine is always equipped with surface condensers, which are fitted with brass tubes
 pump ke dwaara samudr kaa jal sanghnitr main laayaa jaataa he
 It is the condensation of condenser from sea water that condenses
 yadhyapi aajkal samudrayanon main antardahan ingine, bhaap tarabine evam gas tarabine vyavhaar main laayaa ja rahaa he, phir bhi kuch khaas avasthaaon main bhaap ingine kaa vyavhaar atyant aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Richard Trevithick first used steam locomotives to manufacture rail engines
 kintu aarthik kathinaayee ke kaaran unka prayaas safal na ho paaya
 Eventually George and Robert Stevenson were credited with making a successful rail engine, Fig
 7, and driving the train between Lowerpul and Manchester in 1829 AD
 jalayanon ke liye bhaap ingine kaa pratham upyog 1812 i
 main rabart pulton ne kiya tha
 Ordinary rail engines have the behavior of a horizontal steam engine
 yah ingine rail ingine boyler ke paas thos aadhaar par laga rahata he
 Almost all the locomotives do not have condenser
 kaary karne ke baad bhaap ko sidhe vayumandal main chhod diya jaataa he
 There are two types of such engines: aadhunik dizine main in donon prakaaron ko jod diya jaataa he, arthath kuch silinder ingine ke frem ke andar rahete hai evam kuch silinder baahar rahete hai
 Several changes have been made to James Watt's steam engine, although the main principle is still the same
 parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa bhaap ingine ke anekanek kaayon main prayukt hone ke kaaran hui
 Watt used low pressure in a steam engine because he feared an explosion
 lekin aajkal sarvatra ucch daab ingine hi prayukt kiye jate hai kyonki inaki dakshata bhi nimna daab ingine kii apeksha adhik hoti he
 The condenser of a modern engine consists of a number of taps into which soft water is flowed by a pump
 ek or pump bhaap ke sanghanan se bane pani or hawa ko nikaalane ke liye laga hota he
 In Buddhism, knowledge of the real nature of things by an enlightened person is called Bodhi

 These stories make sense of the power of justice of King Vikram
 vetaal pratidin ek kahani sunaata he or ant main raja se aisa prashn kar detaa he ki raja ko uskaa uttar dena hi padataa he
 He has placed a bet that if the king speaks, he will get angry with him and hang on to the tree again
 lekin yah jaanate hue bhi sawaal saamne aane par raja se chup nahin rahaa jaataa
 The stories of Baital Pachisi are among the most popular stories in India
 inkaa strot raja satvaahan ke mantri âgunantyâ dwaara rachit âbed kahaâ naamak granth ko diya jaataa he jisaki rachana i

 These interesting stories told by Betal are not just for recreation, many hidden meanings are hidden in them
 kya sahi he or kya galat, isko yadi ham thik se samaj le to sabhi prashaasak raja vikram ki tarah nyaay priy ban sakenge or chal va dwesh chhodkar, karm or dharm kii raah par chal sakenge
 Thus, these stories develop the ability to make the right decisions in justice, politics, and harsh situations
 sahitya samaaj kaa pratibimb he
 As society changes, literature also takes its new form
 kaal parivartan ke saath bhashaa badal jaati he or bhashaa tathaa samaaj ke parivartan ke saath sahitya badal jaataa he
 It is marked by every part of the society at that time
 âpaliâ bhashaa hamaare desh kii pracheen bhashaa he
 It has also been proud as a state language for a long time
 bhagwaan buddha ne pali bhashaa main hi upadesh diye the
 It grew a lot during Ashoka's time
 us samay iskaa prachaar bhi vibhinn bahya deshon main hua
 All the articles were written in Pali language during Ashoka's time
 bharat main pali bhashaa apane charam par thi lekin bharat main buddha dharm ke haas ke saath hi pali bhashaa kaa haas hona shuru ho gaya
 It was honored as the religious language of many countries such as Lanka, Burma etc
 kintu bharat main yah bhashaa haashiye par aa gai
 The 'pali' language had originated about three hundred years before Gautama Buddha, but its early literature is not known
 prayek bhashaa kaa apana sahitya praarambhik avasthaa main katha, geet, paheli aadi ke rup main rahata he or uski ruparekha tab tak logon ko jabaani yaad rahati he jab tak ki vah lekhabaddh ho yaa grantharu na ho jaay
 Pali language originated in this period as well as development
 prarambh se lekar lagbhag teen sau varshon tak pali bhashaa jan saadhaaran ke bolchaal kii bhashaa rahi, kintu jis samay bhagwaan buddha ne ise apane upadesh ke liye chunaa or isi bhashaa main upadesh dena shuru kiya, tab yah thode hi dinon main shikshit samudaay kii bhashaa hone ke saath rajbhasha bhi ban gai
 The earliest widespread use of the word 'pali' is found in the stories of Acharya Buddhaghosha and his Visuddhimagga
 vahaan yah baat apane uttar kaaleen bhashaa sambandhi arth se mukt he
 Acharya Buddhaghosa has used it in two ways - 1
 In the text of Buddha-bachaan or root tipitaka 2
 In the textual meaning of text or original tipitaka
 âpali bhashaaâ se taatpary us bhashaa se lete hai jisamen sthaviravaad bauddhadharm kaa tipitak or uskaa sampurna upjivi sahitya rakhaa hua he
 But the word 'pali' was never used in this sense even in Pali literature itself before the nineteenth century
 pali bhashaa multah magadhi bhashaa hi thi
 Examples of this are found in Kachyan-grammar
 âmagadhi hi mul bhashaa he, jisamen pratham kalp ke manushya bolte the, jo hi ashrut vachan vaale shishuon kii mul bhashaa heâ or jisamen hi buddha ne apane dharm kaa, mul rup se bhaashan kiya
 Similarly, in the 244th saga of paragraph 37 of the Chul dynasty, the modified part of the Mahavamsa, it is said, "sabbasam Moolabhasaya Magavai Nirutiya" etc
 nishchay hi sinhalai parampara apni is manyata main badi drudh he ki jise ham aaj pali kehete hai, vah buddhakalin bharat main boli jane vaali magadh bhashaa hi thi
 The Buddha does not want to call the language of the children as 'magadhi' in the Sinhalese tradition, he prefers to call the language of the Attakkathas as Magadhi in the twelfth-thirteenth century
 vaise isamen vidwaanon ke mat alag-alag hai- acharya buddhaghosh aisa maanate hai ki yah bhashaa multah magadhi thi
 Dr
 Reese Devides states that the Pali language was the language of Kosala, because Gautama Buddha was a resident of Shakya district under Kosala
 westerguard air i
 kuhan pali bhashaa ko ujjayini pradesh kii bhashaa bataate hai
 He says that if we look at the design of the language and compare it with the inscriptions of Ashoka, then it will be known that the language of Ginar's writings resembles that of Pali
 dow oldenburg or i
 mular kaa mat he ki pali bhashaa kaa udgam sthaan kaling he
 These days scholars have said that since Kalinga, the work of preaching in Lanka continued
 kaling ke hi logon ne jaakar lanka ko aabaad kiya tha or khandgiri ke shilalekhon main pali kaa adhik samya he
 All these scholars have different views
 gautam buddha shakya janapad kii rajdhani kapil vastu ke rahane vaale the, jo kosal ke antargat ek ganatantr tha
 The language that was there
 usee main gautam buddha ne apane upadesh diye
 By the way, Gautama Buddha was opposed to language related oppression
 unhone jis bhashaa main upadesh diya vah bhashaa bihar ki purv seemaa se lekar karu desh tak, mathura, ushirdhvaj se lekar bindhya parvatamala tak log samajhate the
 His sermons were collected as Tripitaka only after one month of Gautama Buddha's Mahairvana
 atah in saare tathyon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki pali bhashaa sampurna madhyadesh kii sahityak bhashaa thi
 He was influenced by the regional dialects of districts and ganas like Kosal, Magadha, Kashi, Panchal, Karu, Vats, Surasena, Shakya, Koliya, Malla, Vajji, Videha, Anga etc
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki pali bhashaa madhyadesh kii bhashaa thi or madhyadesh hi uskaa udgam sthaan tha, vaise bhi bhashaa kisi khaas nagar yaa desh kii vastu nahin hoti
 She belongs to the community, the people and the country

 But he believed that education has an important contribution for social progress
 atah gandhiji kaa shiksha ke kshetra main bhi vishesh yogadan rahaa he

 Which is as follows- jivicoparjan kaa uddeshy: gandhiji ke anusaar shiksha aisi ho jo aarthik aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar sake balak aatmanirbhar ban sake tathaa berogari se mukt ho
 Cultural purpose: Gandhiji considered culture as the basis of education
 unke anusaar maanav ke vyavhaar main samskruti parilakshith honi chahie
 Purpose of complete development: According to him, true education is that through which the physical, mental and spiritual development of children can be done
 naitik athwa charitrik vikaas: gandhiji ne charitrik evam naitik vikaas ko shiksha kaa uchit aadhaar mana he

 The craft should be taught in such a way that the child can understand its social and scientific importance
 shaareerik shram ko mahatv diya gaya taaki siikhe hue shilp ke dwaara jivicoparjan kar sake
 Education should be closely related to children's lives, homes, villages and rural industries, handicrafts and businesses
 baalkon dwaara banaai gai vasteen jinka prayog kar sake evam unako bechakar vidhyalay ke upar kuch vyay kar saken
 Equal syllabus for boys and girls should be kept
 chhathvin or saatvin kakshaon main balikaayen aadharbhoot shilp ke sthaan par gruhavigyaan le sakati hai
 The level of the course should be at par with current matriculation
 paathyakram main angreji or dharm kii shiksha nahin di gai he
 Since basic education was close to national civilization, culture as well as the basic occupations of community life
 tathaa siikhe hue aadharbhoot shilp ke dwaara vyakti apane jivan kaa nirvaah kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, this education was related to the foundation or foundation of our life, hence it was named basic or basic education
 gandhiji ne buniyadi shiksha ke pathkram ke antargat aadharbhoot shilp jaise: krishi, katai-bunai, lakdi, chamade, mitti kaa kaam, pustak kala, machhlee paalan, fal va sabji kii bagwani, balikaon hetu gruhavigyaan tathaa sthaneey evam bhugolic aavashyaktaaon ke anukool shikshaprad hastshilp iske alaava maatrubhaasha, ganit, saamaajik adhyayan evam saamaanya vigyaan, kala, hindi, shaareerik shiksha aadi rakhaa
 The teaching method was essentially based on the actual actions and experiences of teaching
 unke anusaar shikshan vidhi vyaavhaarik ho
 Children should be taught various subjects through a basic craft
 karke siikhnaa, anubhav dwaara siikhnaa tathaa kriya ke madhyam se seekhney par bal diya gaya
 Gandhiji used a common method of learning in basic education
 jisak antargat unhone samast vishyon kii shiksha kisi kaary yaa hastshilp ke madhyam se di
 Relevance of Gandhiji's ideology of education: If we evaluate the above interpretation in the present perspective, then we come to the fact that Gandhiji's teaching is also relevant in the present perspective
 sarvapratham gandhiji dwaara bhartiya jivan ko drushtigat rakhte hue vaataavaran ke anusaar aisi shiksha yojana prastut kiya gaya jisko kaaryrup main parinat karne main bhartiya samaaj main ek nayaa jivan aane kii sambhaavna he
 Gandhiji was an idealist at heart because he provides the motivation to achieve the ultimate goal of life, the truth
 gandhiji ko prayojanavaadee bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki ve balak kii ruchi ke anusaar kriya karke seekhney par bal dete hai
 Naturalists can say to them that they wanted to develop the child according to its nature
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki unke shikshadarshan main teenon vichaardhaaraon main koi vishesh arth nahin tha
 Principles of education propounded by Gandhiji such as free and compulsory education should be given to boys and girls
 aaj ham dekhte hai desh ke samast virgon ko shikshit karne karne hetu kai tarah ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Free, compulsory education as well as many schemes for boys and girls have been made
 taaki adhik se adhik baalkon ko shiksha kii prapti ho sake
 Today we see that today youth have many degrees but no employment
 atah gandhiji ne bahut varsh pehle hi is samasya ko ingit kar diya tha or unhone buniyadi shiksha ke antargat udyogon par aadhaarit shiksha par bal diya taaki balak kisi na kisi hastshilp ko sikhkar aatmanirbhar ban sake
 To get rid of unemployment
 vartmaan main ab vyavhaarik shiksha tathaa vyavsaayik shiksha ko bal diya ja rahaa he
 Gandhiji emphasized on developing human qualities in boys
 jisaki aaj bhi praasangikta he kyonki aaj jo vinaash or tabaahi fail rahi he vah manushyon main maanavtaa kii kami ke kaaran badhati ja rahi he
 Gandhiji has emphasized on learning by doing or action which is equally essential today because learning learned by doing action or by itself is permanent which is necessary for every field
 gandhiji ne shaareerik shram kaa sammaan kiya
 According to him man should do his work himself
 kisi par nirbhar nahin hona chahie
 At the same time, discrimination also disappears
 jo aaj ke pariprekshya main bhi aavashyak he
 The one who will respect the work can be associated with the production work
 gandhiji ke dwaara diye gayi aarthik, naitik, saanskrithik, naagarikta kaa uddeshy saath hi saath sarvoday samaaj kii sthapana jiske antargat shram kaa mahatv hoga, dhan kaa nahin, sneh or sahyog kii bhavanaaen hongi, ghrinaa evam pruthakta nahin, shoshan ke sthaan par parahit evam sanchay kii pravriti ke sthaan par tyaag kii pravriti hogi
 Presently, due to mischief such as exploitation, hatred, selfishness and accomplishment, there is murder, destruction and abuses of humanity
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki gandhiji kii sarvoday samaaj kii sthapana kaa uddeshy aaj aavashyak ban gaya he
 Gandhiji also boycotted the teaching of religion
 kyonki unhen bhay tha ki jin dharmon kii shiksha di jaati he athwa paalan kiya jaataa he ve mail ke sthaan par jhagade utpann karte hai
 The current situation is also supportive of this
 atev gandhiji ke dwaara diye gayi shiksha ke siddhant, uddeshy, paathyakram, shikshanvidhi aaj bhi baalkon tathaa balikaon, vidhyalay tathaa samaaj ke liye utane hi aavashyak he jitne pehle unki mahatvapurn kriti buniyadi shiksha athwa basic shiksha bacchon ko, chaahe ve nagaron ke hon yaa graamon ke, samast sarvottam evam sthai baton se sambandh rakhti he
 And has proved helpful in making children self-reliant
 unki shiksha keval maansik vikaas kii ore hi dhyaan nahin detii balki shaareerik, maansik, naitik evam aadhyatmik vikaas ke liye bhi uyogi hui he

 The development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976
 12 oktober 1982 se lekar 1995 tak, kai rocket prakshepanon ke madhyam se is pranali main paryaapt maatra main upgrahon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 But unfortunately after this the Russian economy collapsed and the condition of this system also weakened
 2000 ke dashak ke armbh main vladimir putin kii adhyakshata main is pranali kii bahaali ko ek sheersh sarkari variyata pradaan kii gai or vittaposhan main paryaapt vruddhi kii gai
 Currently, GLONASS is the most expensive program of the Russian Federal Space Agency with a third of its 2010 budget spent
 2010 tak glonas ne roosi pradesh ke lagbhag 100% hisson ko cover karne kii kshamta hasil kar li thi
 As of February 2011, the satellite group had 22 operational satellites which was short of the 24 satellites required to provide continuous global coverage and this shortfall is expected to be met during 2011
 glonas upgrahon kii diginon ko kai baar naveekrut kiya gaya he jiskaa sabase naveenatam sanskaran glonas-ke he
 The Soviet Union's first satellite-based radio navigation system was the Tsiklone aimed at providing accurate positioning to ballistic missile submarines
 1967 or 1978 ke bich 31 tcyclone upgrahon kaa prakshepan kiya gaya
 The main problem of this system was that despite the stationary or slow moving ships being highly accurate, determining the position required several hours of observation by the receiving station, which led to many navigational purposes and ballistic Proved to be unusable for guiding the new generation of missiles
 1968-1969 main, nausena ke saath-saath vaayu, thal or antariksh balon kii bhi sahaayta karne vaali ek nai nevigation pranali kii kalpana kii gai
 Formal requirements were met in 1970; The government decided to start developing an "integrated space navigation system"
 glonas kaa dizin taiyaar karne kaa kaam crasnoyarsk-26 shahar main enpio piem ke yuva visheshgyon ke ek samooh ko saunpa gaya 
 vladimir cheremicine ke netritv main unhone kai prastaav viksit kiye jisamen se santhaan ke nideshak grigori tchernivski ne antim prastaav kaa chayan kiya
 This work was completed in the late 1970s; The system will consist of 24 satellites operating at an altitude of 20,000 km in a medium circular orbit
 yah pranali 4 upgrahon se praapt sanketon ke aadhaar par praapak stesan kii sthiti kaa turant pataa lagane main sakasham hogi or vastu kii gati or disha kaa bhi khulaasa karne main sakasham hogi
 Three of these satellites will be released at once on a heavy-lifting proton rocket
 In view of the need for more number of satellites for the program, the work of manufacturing NPO PM satellites was handed over to PO Poliot of Omsk who had better production capacity
 shuru main glonas ko 65 me tak kii sateekta ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha lekin vastav main asainik sanket main isaki sateekta 20 me or sainya sanket main 10 me thi
 The first generation GLONASS satellites were 7
8 meters in length, 7
2 meters in width and 1260 kg in mass, including measurements of their solar panels
 1980 ke dashak ke aarambhik daur main enpio piem ko jamini pareekshan ke liye pio poliot se pehle prototip upgrahon kii prapti hui
 Most of the manufactured parts had a low level of quality due to which the engineers at NPO PM had to redesign them to a great extent which resulted in delayed performance
 12 oktober 1982 main cosmos-1413, cosmos-1414 or cosmos-1415 naamak teen upgrahon ko ek protone rocket ke madhyam se prakshepit kiya gaya
 It was decided to launch it with two simulated satellites, with only one GLONASS satellite being produced instead of the three satellites expected at launch
 america media ne apni khabar main is ghatana ko ek upgrah or "do gupt vastuon" kaa prakshepan bataaya
 For a long time Americans could not know the nature of those "objects"
 soviet sangh telegraph agency ne is prakshepan ko cover karte hue glonas ko ek aisi pranali bataaya jise "soviet sangh ke asainik uddyan vimaan, nausena parivahan or machhlee pakadaney ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale naavon kii sthiti kaa pataa lagane ke liye banaaya gaya tha"
 From 1982 to April 1991, the Soviet Union successfully launched 43 glonass-related satellites and five test satellites
 1991 main soviet sangh ke vighatan ke samay do vimaanon main baarah kriyasheel glonas upgrahon kaa sanchaalan kiya ja rahaa tha jo pranali ke simit upyog ke liye kaaphi tha
 The Russian Federation took control of the satellite group and continued its development
 1993 main is pranali ko aupchaarik rup se sanchalansheel ghoshit kiya gaya jisamen ab 12 upgrah the or disambar 1995 main upgrah samooh ko aakhirkaar isaki ishtatam sthiti main laayaa gaya jisamen 24 sanchalansheel upgrah shaamil the
 This brought Glonass' precision to par with the American GPS system that achieved full operational capability two years ago
 pehali peedi ke upgrahon main se prayek upgrah 3 saal tak sanchalit hone kii vajah se is pranali ko sampoorn kshamta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye 24 upgrahon ke puure network kaa rakrakhaav karne ke liye har saal do prakshepanon kii jarurat thi
 However, at the time of the financial crisis of 1989â1999, the funding of the space program was cut by 80 percent, and Russia found itself unable to afford this launch rate thereafter
 disambar 1995 main puraa samarthan milane ke baad disambar 1999 tak koi atirikt prakshepan nahin kiya gaya
 As a result, in 2001, the number of working satellites in the satellite group decreased to 6
 visanikaran kii prastaavna ke rup main kaarykram kii jimmedaari ko raksha mantralay se lekar rus kii asainik antariksh agency roscosmos ko saunp di gai
 In the early 2000s, the Russian economy under the chairmanship of Vladimir Putin improved and the state's finances improved considerably
 khud putin ne glonas main khaas dilchaspee lee or is pranali kii bahaali ko sarkaar kii sheersh variyataon main se ek bana diya gaya
 For this purpose, in August 2001, the federally targeted program "global Navigation System" 2002-2011 was launched
 is kaarykram kaa bajet 420 million dollar tha or iskaa uddeshy 2009 tak sampoorn upgrah samooh ko behaal karnaa tha
 On 10 December 2003, the second generation satellite design GLONASS-M was launched for the first time
 iskaa dravyaman aadharbhoot glonas kii tulana main thodaa adhik tha jiskaa vajan 1415 kilo tha lekin iskaa jivan kaal mul upgrah kii tulana main dugana tha jisase aavashyak pratisthaapan dar main 50 pratishat kii kami dekhi gai
 The new satellite also had the ability to transmit two additional civilian signals and improved accuracy
 2006 main raksha mantri sargei evanov ne un sanketon main se ek sanket ko naagarik upyogkartaaon ke liye uplabdh karaane kaa aadesh diya
 However, Putin was not satisfied with this and demanded that the entire system should be made fully available to all
 natijatan, 18 may 2007 ko sabhi pratibandh hataa liye gaye
 The 10-meter precision and first military-only signal has since been made available free to civilian users
 2000 ke pehle dashak ke madhya main roosi arthvyavastha main aane vaali teji ke parinamswaroop desh ke antariksh bajet main kaaphi vruddhi hui
 The funding of the GLONASS program increased significantly in 2007; Its budget has more than doubled
 2006 main glonas ko sangheey bajet se 181 million dollar milane ke baavjood 2007 main is raashi ko badhaakar 380 million dollar kar diya gaya
 Finally, during 2001â2011, the program spent 140
1 billion rubles, which became Roskosmos's largest project, with one third of its 2010 budget of 84
5 billion rubles
 june 2008 main is pranali main 16 upgrah the jinamein se 12 upgrah us samay puri tarah se kaam kar rahe the
 At this time Roskosmos aimed to establish a complete satellite group of 24 satellites in orbit by 2010, a year after the first planned deadline
 ek gharelu, swatantra upgrah nevigation pranali hone kaa sainya mahatv agast 2008 main hone vaale 2008 dakshin osesia yuddh ke dauraan samaj main aayaa: shatruta ke dauraan america jeepies pranali kshetra main puri tarah se chaa gai thi
 In September 2008, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree to allocate an additional 67 billion rubles to GLONASS from the federal budget
 haalanki glonas upgrah samooh vaishvik kawarej ke nikat pahunch rahaa he lekin iskaa vanijikaran khaas taur par upyogkarta khand kaa vikaas america jeepies pranali kii tulana main peeche he
 For example, the first commercial Russian-made GLONASS navigation device for cars, the GLOSPACE SGK-70, was introduced in 2007 but was much larger and significantly more expensive than similar GPS receivers
 2010 ke antim daur main bazaar main bas kuch mutthi bhar glonas resiver uplabdh the or unamem se bahut kam saadhaaran upabhoktaaon ke liye bane the
 To improve its condition, the Russian government is actively promoting GLONASS for civilian use
 upyogkarta khand ke vikaas main sudhaar karne ke liye 11 agast 2010 ko sargei evanov ne glonas ke saath sangat rahane tak mobile phone sahit sabhi jeepies kshamya upkarnon par tab tak 25% aayaat shulk lagane kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii
 Simultaneously, the government is planning to force all car manufacturers in Russia to manufacture glonass-rich cars from 2011
 isse rus main car sangyojan kendron vaali ford or toyota jaisi videshi brands vaali companiyon sahit sabhi car nirmaataa companiyaan prabhavit hongi
 All current GPS and phone baseband chips from major vendor companies such as st-ericsson, Broadcom and Qualcomm support GLONASS in conjunction with GPS
 kisi bhi aayaat pratibandh se bahut kam parivartan hone kii sambhaavna he kyonki duniya bhar main bheje jane vaale adhikansh upkaran bahut jald glonas kaa samarthan karenge
 The Russian objective of giving the satellite group its full size suffered a setback in 2010 when the launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed in December 2010
 khud protone-em rocket ne dosharahit tareeke se pradarshan kiya tha lekin upree str blok dm3 main sensor kii vifaltaa kii vajah se bahut zyada eendhan bhar diya gaya tha
 As a result, the upper level and three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean
 comersant ke anumaan ke mutabik is prakshepan vifaltaa kii vajah se 160 million dollar kaa nuksaan hua tha
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a full audit of the entire program and to investigate this failure
 is durghatana ke baad roscosmos ne do arakshit upgrahon ko sakriy kiya or khaas taur par mul rup se yojanabaddh pareekshan ke bajaay kriyasheel upgrah samooh ke hisse ke rup main farvari 2011 main prakshepit karne ke liye pehla behatar glonas-ke upgrah banane kaa faisla kiya
 This will bring the total number of satellites to 23, which will get coverage of almost the whole world
 doosraa glonas-ke teen se chaar maheene ke bheetar taiyaar ho jayega
 In 2010 President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the government to prepare a new federally targeted program for GLONASS from 2012 to 2020
 2001 ke mul kaarykram ko 2011 main samaapt karne ke liye anusuchit kiya gaya he
 GLONASS is a global satellite navigation system that detects the actual location and velocity of military and civilian users
 upgrahon ko 64

 The six spacecraft that put it into orbit worked well, operating on average for about 22 months
 block iaivi pehali peedi kaa sabase safal antariksh yaan tha
 a total of 25 satellites were launched specifically for use from 1988 to 2000 and included in launches from 2005
 is dizin kaa jivan kaal 3 varsh tha haalanki kai antariksh yanon ne isse lanbaa jivan jiyaa jinamein se ek parvarti model 68 maheenon tak chalata rahaa
 Block Ii satellites were typically launched three to three at a time from the Baconeur Cosmodrome using either proton-k blok-dm-2 or proton-k bridge-m boosters
 iskaa ekmaatr apwaad us samay hua jab do prakshepanon main ek glonas upgrah ke badale main ek italone geodetic riflactor upgrah kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The development of second generation satellites known as GLONASS-M began in 1990 and was launched for the first time in 2003
 in upgrahon kaa jivan kaal kaaphi adhik saat varsh or vajan thodaa adhik 1480 kilo tha
 They have a diameter of about 2
4 m and a height of 3
7 m, whose solar table expansion was 7
2 m for an electric power generation capacity of 1600 watts at launch
 iske pichley bhaag ke dhaanche main el-band preshan ke liye 12 praathmik antena lage hai
 Laser corner-cube reflectors are also transported to aid accurate orbit determination and geodetic research

 By the end of 2007, a total of fourteen second-generation satellites were abandoned
 pichhali peedi kii tarah duusari peedi ke antariksh yanon ko bhi teen-teen karke protone-ke blok-dm-2 yaa protone-ke brij-em boosteron kaa istemaal karke choda gaya tha
 The GLONASS-K is much better than the previous generation: it is the first non-pressurized GLONASS satellite in its mass
 Its operating life span is 10 years, which is more than the 7-year life span of the second generation GLONASS-M, it will transmit 5 navigation signals instead of 2 to improve the accuracy of the system
 el1 or el2 bandon par 4 sainya sanketon ko sanchaarit kiya jayega jabaki asainik sanket ke liye el3 band kaa istemaal kiya jayega
 glonas-ke upgrahon ke madhyam se atirikt sidime sanketon kaa prasaaran kiya jayega jinamein se do jeepies / galileo sangat nevigational sanket honge
 Especially with the help of advanced equipment of the new satellite made of Russian components, it will help to double the accuracy of GLONASS
 Like previous satellites, these are also 3 axially stationary nadir signals with dual solar arrays
 pehle glonas-ke upgrah ko 26 farvari 2011 ko safaltaapurvak choda gaya
 Due to the reduced weight, the GLONASS-K spacecraft were mounted in pairs from the Pleasantk Kosmodrome launch site using very low-cost soyuz-2
1b boosters, or six spacecrafts at a time from the Baconur Cosmodrome using the proton-k bridge-m launch vehicles
 Can be projected
 glonas kaa bhoomi niyantran khand puri tarah se purv soviet sangh pradesh ke bheetar sthit he

 The GLONASS satellite provides two types of signals: a standard precision signal and a fuzzy high precision signal
 in sanketon main jeepies sanketon kii tarah dseses inkoding or binary phej-shift kunjeeyan modulation kaa istemaal hota he
 All GLONASS satellites transmit the same code as their SP signal although each code is sent to a different frequency using a 15-channel frequency division multipoint access technique transmitted from either side of 1602
0 mhz called the L1 band
 kendriya aavriti 1602 megahertz + n x 0
5625 megahertz he jahaan "n " ek upgrah aavriti channel number he
 The signals are sent as a 38 Â° cone using a right-hand circular polarization at an EIRP between 25 and 27 dbw
 dhyaan den ki pratilom sambandhi upgrah jodiyon ko sahaara dene ke liye ek samaan aavriti channelon kaa istemaal karke keval 15 channelon kii sahaayta se 24 upgrahon ke samooh ko samyojit kiya jaataa he kyonki ye upgrah ek hi samay main prithvi ke upgyogkarta kii najar main kabhi nahin aayenge
 The HP signal is transmitted in the same square phase as the SP signal, effectively using the same carrier that is used for the SP signal but its bandwidth is ten times the bandwidth of the SP signal
 el2 sanketon ke liye usee epadme kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jiskaa istemaal el1 band sanketon ke liye kiya jaataa he lekin lekin sameekaran 1246 megahertz + n Ã0
4375 megahertz dwaara nirdhaarit kendra aavriti ke saath 1246 megahertz par prasaarit kiya jaataa he jahaan n kaa vistaar vahiin tak he jahaan tak el1 kaa he
 Other details of the HP signal have not been disclosed
 isaki charam kaarykushalta par espi sanket dwaara 5 se 10 meter ke bheetar kshaitij or 15 meter ke bheetar urdhwadhar sthiti nirdhaaran sateekta pradaan kiya jaataa he jiske veg sadish kaa maap 10 semi / second ke bheetar or samay 200 enes ke bheetar hota he jinamein se sabhi ek saath chaar pehali peedi ke upgrahon kii maap par aadhaarit hote hai; glonas-em jaise nae upgrah isse behatar he
 More accurate HP signals are available to authorized users such as the Russian Army but still unlike the US p code which is fixed by an encrypting w code, the GLONASS p codes are only explicitly using 'security through opacity' Is broadcast
 haalanki is sanket ke istemaal main khatra he kyonki el2pi code par data bits ke modulation main haal hi main parivartan karke ise yadrichhik antaraalon par utaar-chadhaav rahit mod se 250bipies barasat main roopantarit kar diya gaya he
 The GLONASS L1P code is modulated at 50 bps without the Manchester Miander code and allocates more bits for significant luni-solar acceleration parameters and clock correction conditions, despite having the same orbital elements as the CA code
 filhal el1 band sanket ke liye ek samaan espi code ke saath el2 band main ek atirikt asainik sandarbh sanket kaa prasaaran kiya jaataa he
 Except for the last satellite of modest original GLONASS design ie only satellite number 795, it is obtainable from all satellites of the current group and partly from an unmanageable GLONASS-M satellite which is being broadcast only in L1 band
 glonas main "pijed-90" naamak ek samanvay datom kaa istemaal hota he jisamen uttari dhruv kii satee sthiti ko 1990 se 1905 tak isaki sthiti ke ek ausat ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he
 This is in contrast to the GPS coordinate datum WGS 84 which used the position of the North Pole in 1984

 The GLONASS-K2 satellite launched in 2013â2015 will use three additional CDMA signals near the original FDMA frequencies, with one fuzzy signal located at 1242 mhz in the L2 band as well as two signals in the L1 band at 1575
42 mhz
 ; Subsequent GLONASS-KM satellites launched after 2015 will display the free signal in the L5 band at 1176
45 mhz and will also use more CDMA signals at current frequencies
 saanchaa:glonass satellites roadmap Although the format and modulation of GLONASS CDMA has not yet been finalized, the initial statements from the developers suggest that BOC modulation centered at 1575
42 mhz will be used for the free signal in the L1 band, free in the L3 band
 QPSK modulation centered at 1202
025 mhz will be used for the signal and free signal in L5 band To be used in concentrated BOC modulation at 1176
45 mhz
 Two of these signals are essentially equivalent modernized GPS civilian signals "neo civilian L1" and gps-formatted signals located at the focal points of "life safety" located near existing Galileo and compass signals and L3 band signal L2 The band is located just below the "m-code" signal of modernized GPS

 With the introduction of CDMA signals this group will be expanded to 30 active satellites; Future reforms may have to eventually resist FDMA signals

 dhoomaketu ke bhautik gun neeche sarini main diya gaya he - The comet is classified on the basis of its orbit
 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and went out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy, or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it
