 Mrs
 Bhikhaji Ji Rustom Cama Hindustani pronunciation:) was a Parsi citizen of Indian origin who visited London, Germany and America and created an atmosphere in favor of India's independence
 ve germany ke statagart nagar main 22 agast 1907 main hui saatvin antarrashtriya congress main bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraane ke liye suvikhyath hai
 At that time the tricolor was not as it is today
 unke dwaara paris se prakashit "vandemaataram" patr pravasi bharatiyon main kaaphi lokapriy hua
 At the International Socialist Congress held in Stuttgart, Germany in 1907, Madame Bhikaji Cama said that - "continuation of British rule in India is a stigma in the name of humanity
" ek mahaan desh bharat ke hiton ko isse baari kshati pahunch rahi he
 "he appealed to the people to cooperate in liberating India from slavery and called upon the Indians that -" Go ahead, we are Hindustani and Hindustan belongs to Hindustan
 " ’’ yahi nahin madam bhikaaji kama ne is conference main ‘vandemaataram’ ankit bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraa kar angrejon ko kadi chunauti di
 Madam Bhikaji was also the private secretary of Dada Bhai Naoroji in Cama London

 Mrs
 Cama's great contribution was to raise the world public opinion against imperialism and to present India's desire for freedom from foreign rule
 bharat kii swadhinata ke liye ladate hue unhone lambii avadhi tak nirvasit jivan bitaayaa tha
 According to the facts, although Bhikaji believed in non-violence, he also called for opposition to unjust violence
 unhone swaraj ke liye aawaaj uthaai or naaraa diya− aage badho, ham bharat ke liye hai or bharat bharatiyon ke liye he
 Bhikaji Cama was born on 24 September 1861 in Bombay to a Parsi family
 unamem logon kii madad or seva karne kii bhaavana kuta−kuta kar bhari thi
 Bhikaji served its patients after the plague spread in Mumbai in 1896
 baad main vah khud bhi is beemaari kii chapet main aa gai thim
 She was recovered after treatment but was advised to go to Europe for rest and further treatment
 varsh 1902 main vah isi silsile main landan gayi or vahaan bhi unhone bhartiya swadhinata sangharsh ke liye kaam jari rakhaa
 In 1907, Bhikaji, with the help of his colleague Sardarsingh Rana, designed the first design of India's first tricolor national flag
 bhikaaji kama ne 22 agast 1907 ko germany main hui international socialist conference main bhartiya swatantraaa ke dhwajbharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj ko buland kiya tha
 At that conference, he appealed to free India from British rule
 unke taiyaar kiye gaye jhande se kaaphi milte−julate digaayan ko baad main bharat ke dhvaj ke rup main apanaaya gaya
 This India's first tricolor national flag, built by Ranaji and Kamaji, is still kept safe in the house of BJP leader Rajubhai Rana, grandson of Sardarsingh Rana in Bhavnagar, Gujarat
 vah apane krantikari vichaar apane samachar-patr ‘vandemaataram’ tathaa ‘talwaar’ main prakat karti thim
 Mrs
 Cama's fight was against imperialism around the world
 vah bharat ke swadhinata andolan ke mahatva ko khub samajhati thim, jiskaa lakshya sampurna prithvi se samrajyavad ke prabhutv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 His colleagues considered him the 'mother of the Indian revolution'; Whereas the British called her a notorious woman, dangerous revolutionary, anarchist revolutionary, anti-british and inconsistent
 europe ke samaajawaadee samudaay main shrimati kama kaa paryaapt prabhaav tha
 This was evident when he invited European journalists to defend their patriots
 vah ‘bhartiya rashtriyata kii mahaan pujaarin’ ke naam se vikhyath thim
 His portrait appeared in French newspapers with Joan of Arc
 yah is tathy kii bhavpurn abhivyakti thi ki shrimati kama kaa europe ke rashtriya tathaa loktantric samaaj main vishisht sthaan tha
 In the flag waving by Bhikaji, there was an attempt to assimilate the feelings and culture of different religions of the country

 Also, in the middle of it was written Vande Mataram in Devanagari script

 Although Tibetan Buddhism is most commonly associated with Tibet, it spread to Russia through Mongolia
 17 veen sadi main, tibeti buddha dharm uttar main mongolia se bikaal kshetra ke buryaat samudaayon main fail gaya
 The second Buddhist wave came directly from Tibet

 Thus, the Buryat tradition became officially independent of the Mongolian Church

 In Russia, it is considered the date of official recognition of Buddhism
 Buddhism in russiain the early 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism spread north from Mongolia to Buryat communities of the Baikal region
 The second wave came directly from Tibet
 Aiming for weakening the influence of Mongols and Manchurs in the region, the tsar conferred the title of Bandido Khambo Lama on the priors of Gusinoozersk Datsan to acknowledge them as leaders of Buryat Buddhism
 Thus, Buryat tradition became officially independent of the Mongolian Church
 In 1741, Empress Elizabeth issued a decree that recognized the Lamaistic belief in Buryatia and authorized establishing of 11 monasteries with 150 lamas on the staff
 This is considered the date of the official recognition of Buddhism in Russia
 There were schools opened at datsans and books printed
 In the 18th century, Tibetan Buddhism from Mongolia reached Turkic population of Tuva, though the first wave of Buddhism had come there from Uigurs in the 9th century
 Like in the Baikal region, it was mainly the Gelug tradition; the Nyingma tradition also spread widely
 The priors of Chadan Khura were given the title of Khambu Lama as leaders of Tuva Buddhism
 Since Tuva, like Mongolia, was under Manchurs' authority until 1912, the Khambu Lamas of Tuva were subordinate directly to Bogdo Gegens in Urga
 Buddhism in Tuva had significantly closer relations to Mongolia than Buryat Buddhism; besides, it coexisted peacefully with the local tradition of shamanism
 People came to see shamans on certain cases while consulting Buddhist priests on the others
 In the early 17th century, the ancestors of Kalmyks separated from the Oirats of Dzungaria and migrated to the region between the Volga and the Don River, north to the Caspian Sea
 They brought their own tradition of Tibetan Buddhism with them
 Namkhai Guiyatso, the Oirat of Zai Pandita, gave them a great help by developing the kalmyk-oirat written language on the base of the Mongolian alphabet
 The leader of Kalmyk Buddhism was appointed by the Russian tsar and was titled Lama Of The Kalmyk People
 His residence being situated in Astrakhan, he possessed complete independence from the Mongols, Bandido Khambo Lama of Buryats alike
 Kalmyks received spiritual guidance directly from Tibet, and owing to their natural syncretism, they adopted rites of the Sakya and Kagyu traditions as well as the Gelug one, which was the most widely practiced
 Ivolgin datsan, Buryatia, russiaby 1846, 34 datsans had been built in Buryatia
 With much effort and a lot of expenses, Buryats managed to import a vast number of the sacred books from Tibet, China, and Mongolia, and adopted many living practices of both the dominant Gelug and other schools
 In 1869, Buddhists of Tsugol Datsan began studying indo-tibetan medicine under the guidance of Mongolian lama Choi Manramba; presently such studies were initiated in several other places
 Formation of the basic institutions of higher theological education after the Tibetan pattern had been completed in 1876, when a school of Duinkhor Kalachakra was established at Aginsk Datsan
 Book publishing was developing rapidly
 In 1887, there were already 29 publishing houses, which had produced about 2,000 titles in Tibetan and Mongolian before their destruction in the 1930s
 Kalmyk Buddhism of that period had its own story
 After the Kalmyk Khanate elimination in the end of the 18th century, the 'steppe of Kalmykia' became another territory of the tsarist Russia, subjected to the military governor of Astrakhan
 According to the Royal Regulation on Governing Kalmyk People legislated in 1834, the Buddhist church was completely under authority of the tsar administration
 It was not long before the revolution of 1917 when the Buddhist family of Russia accepted Tuvinians of the South Siberia, the only Turkic nation confessing Buddhism
 Many temples there had schools for boys to acquire basic religious literacy
 The higher theological education Tuvinians usually obtained in Mongolia
 For promotion in the development of Russia's international bonds in the East and particularly for improving direct ties between the tsarist government and theocratic regimes of Mongolia and Tibet, a Buddhist temple was built in St
 Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire
 The works were funded by Dalai Lama and donations raised in Buryatia and Kalmykia
 Bogdo Gegen, the head of Mongolian Buddhists, also contributed a significant sum
 An eminent Buryat lama Agvan Dorjiev was in charge of the temple's establishment and activities
 By 1935, about one third of Buryat datsans was emptied because the clergy had either fled or been repressed
 a year later, 22 of 29 datsans were closed down under the pretext that they were situated near the state border, and lamas were expelled, accused of being ‘japanese spies’ and ‘the people’s enemies’
 Similar actions were taking place in Kalmykia, as well as in formally independent Tuva
 Khurul, Kalmykia, Russia During 1917-1937, 79 temples were closed down in Kalmykia
 Shortly after the revolution of 1917, Chore theological academy was eliminated, the other one lasted until 1933
 None of the novitiates remained in khuruls in 1937 as result of so-called 'systematic struggling for the young generation'
 Since Kalmyk autonomy was abolished in 1943, and the people were deported to Siberia, the existence of temples and Buddhism in Kalmykia was out of the question
 In Tuva, an ‘independent’ state since 1921, the church at first remained untouched
 In 1928, the national parliament even legislated Buddhism as a state religion
 Perhaps this provoked the devastation to begin in 1929, which was enforced in 1930 by the Communist Party’s special resolution on ‘the problem of lamas’
 According to the witnesses, lamas were arrested methodically, the top echelon of the clergy at first, then the next ‘layer’, and so on to the very last
 In Tuva, like in Kalmykia, temples were burnt to ashes
 But while Kalmyks had at least one building unbroken, the stone princes' of Tyumen khurul in Khosheut, only the ruins of walls a meter thick of Chadan Khure were left in Tuva
 It was only in 1948 that a new monastery was built in Ivolga, near ulan-ude, the capital of Buryatia, and one of the buildings of Aginsk Datsan near Chita was re-opened
 With the beginning of perestroika, a great number of Buddhist communities were officially registered under the aegis of the Central Religious Committee of the Buddhists of the USSR
 Restoration of destroyed monasteries started in the Baikal region, Kalmykia, and Tuva, along with building new temples
 St
 Petersburg Datsan was returned to the Buddhist community and renovated
 a Buddhist Institute was opened at Ivolga Datsan
 In Kalmykia 22 temples now
 In Tuve about 16
 In Buryatia more than 30 temples
 Many buddhist center openly in all big city, including Moscow and saint-ptereburg

 Lathe machine or lathe is a machine tool used for making goods with symmetrical design of axis
 isamen dhaatu kaa pind ek aksh par ghurnan karata rahata he or kaatane, chhed karne evam anya kriyaayein karne vaale aujaar is par aavashyaktaanusaar lagaakar ise uchit rup diya jaataa he
 a lathe is a device on which round pieces are prepared
 haath ke kisi upkaran se kisi cheez ko icchit gol rup main nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 Therefore, it is tied in a lathe, which keeps rotating this thing
 tab aujaar se is par kaam kiya jaataa he
 The machine with which all this work is done is called a lathe
 chitra main ek saral kharad dikhaaya gaya he
 On the left side of the lathe is its crescent, which serves to hold and rotate the limb being prepared
 shirodand main ek khokhla takala he jo do dharukon par ghumta he
 Between the two holders, a spindle is encased on the spindle, on which there are usually three posts, from these positions the speed of the edict can be increased and reduced
 isi prakaar kii ek ghirani us dhuree par bhi hoti he jisase motor dwaara is kharad ko chalaaya jaataa he
 The speed of the lathe is changed by shifting the top of the pulley from one post of the pulley to another
 takale ke baayein kinare par daantonvale chakra hote hai, jinako dantichakra kaha jaataa he
 The lathe is led by them
 kisi ang par chudiyaan kaatane ke liye netrubhrami kaa upyog aavashyak he
 And this is how the instrument column moves on its own
 jis prakaar kii chuudi kaatani hogi usee prakaar kaa upkaran prayog main laayaa jayega, parantu prati inch main chudiyon kii sankhya dantichakron dwaara vyavasthit kii jaaegi
 On the right side of the spindle is a lathe chuck
 isse us cheez ko pakadte hai jisapar kaam karnaa hota he
 There are often two types of chuck: shirodand ke pashchaat kaa upkaran stambh he
 This pillar is used to hold the devices and keep them in good condition
 isamen do chakra hote hai, jo haath se chalaae jate hai
 From one wheel the column is driven across the length of the lathe and from the other wheel the tool is pushed back and forth across the lathe width
 isliye bade chakra se upkaran kii kaat kii gati or chote chakra se kaat kii gaharaai ko sthir kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the job of tool column is to make the right kind of cut on an object
 kharad ke daahine kinare par puchhdand hota he, jiskaa kaam shirodand kii sahaayta karnaa he; jaise, yadi kisi lambii vastu par kaam karnaa he or usko keval chak main hi pakadaa jaay to bal padane par vastu jhuk jaaygi
 Therefore, by making a hole between the other edge of such object and depositing it from the center of the tail, then this object also rotates at this center
 iske kaaran iske jhukne kaa dar nahin hota
 The shape of a lathe is considered to be the name of the organs working on it
 yadi ham kahen ki kharad kaa aakaar 12 x 60 inch he, to iskaa matlab hua ki is kharad par sabase bada krityak 12 inch vyas kaa or 60 inch lambaai kaa bandha ja saktaa he
 This type of lathe is called a fruit lathe
 yadi shirodand ke chak ke neeche kharad main adhik sthaan chhod diya jaae, jiske kaaran kharad ke aakaar se bade kaam ko us par bandha ja sake, to usko antaraal kharad kaha jaayga
 There are three ways to tie an object on a lathe: chak or puchhdand ke kendron par vastu ko baandhna vastu ke donon kinaaron ke vyas ke bich chhed banaakar, donon dandon ke kendron par chadhaakar kas diya jaataa he
 This tension is caused by rotating the wheel of the tail
 kaam kii lambaai ke anusaar puchhdand ko aage peeche kiya ja saktaa he
 Tying the work to the chuck and mukhapatt par kaam ko bandhna
 This is the way the work is done
 shirodand kaa takala khokhla hone ke kaaran lambii chhadon ko pakadaney main suvidha hoti he
 The function of the tails is not only to handle the work, but also to make holes and enlarge the inner diameter
 kharad par kai prakaar ke kaam kiye jate hai
 Rounding an object and making it of a particular diameter, cutting the bangle, casting on an object, enlarging small holes, increasing the inner diameter and so on
 vastu par pehle gahari kaat lekar usko naap se kuch hi zyada rakh liya jaataa he
 After this, the work is brought to its right size by taking short cuts
 har prakaar kii kaat ke liye alag-alag upkaran hote hai
 The type of work that has to be done, the same type of equipment has to be purchased
 chudiyaan kaatane ke liye upkaran usee rup kaa banaaya jaataa he jis rup kii chuudi hoti he
 There are many types of lathes which are difficult to tell here, but the rule of working of each lathe is the same as stated above
 kharad par kaam karne se pehle kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhana bahut aavashyak he
 Before running the lathe, it is beneficial and necessary to clean it and give oil to all its parts
 tel dene se kharad kaa har bhaag acha kaam karata he
 The object being worked on is heated by cutting
 yadi isko thandha nahin kiya gaya to upkaran bhi garam ho jaayga or uski dhar nasht ho jaaegi
 This will make it difficult to cut the metal and the metal will not be able to cut properly
 isliye dhaatu kaatane ke saath-saath us par tel bhi diya jaataa he
 One, this oil helps in tool work and the other keeps the metal frosty
 yah tel khaas taur se isi kaam ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 For this purpose, soap is also dissolved in water and brought in less
 yah bhi dekha gaya he ki kharad par kaam karne vaale kaa koi kapadaa kharad ke kisi chalanevaale bhaag main fas gaya or iske kaaran durghatana ho gai
 Therefore, working on a lathe wearing loose clothes is not good
 kharad ke chalanevaale sab angon par bhi koi roak lagaana aavashyak hota he
 Keeping all the metal cutting tools sharp does a good job
 kam gahare or choti kaat lene se kaam kaa roopak acha hota he
 In some factories, an axle was mounted upwards to run the lathe, which was driven by an engine
 is dhuree par kai ghiraniyaan lagaai jaati thim or har ghirani se ek kharad chalati thi
 There were many difficulties with the use of this system, one is that even if one or two lathes were to be run, an engine of the same power would have to be used to run all the latches simultaneously
 isse kharaadon ko chalaane main adhik laagat aati thi
 Secondly, if there was any fault in the engine, then the work of all the latches would stop
 tisare, isse durghatnaayen bhi adhik hoti thim
 So nowadays this system is not used
 ab har kharad ke saath uski apni motor aati he, jisko jab bhi aavashyak hota he chalaa liya jaataa he
 Thus the power of each lathe remains different with it
 simangooth, bhanoli tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The Taj Mahal is a World Heritage Tomb located in the city of Agra, India
 iskaa nirmaan mogul samraat shahjahan ne, apni patni mumtaz mahal kii yaad main karavaaya tha
 The Taj Mahal is an excellent specimen of Mughal architecture
 isaki vaastu style farsi, turk, bhartiya or islamic vaastukala ke ghatakon kaa anokhaa sammilan he
 In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site

 saadharantaya dekhe gayi sangmarmar kii silliyon kii bady- bady parto se dhank kar banaai gai imaaraton kii tarah na banaakar iskaa shwet gumbad evam tile aakaar main sangmarmar se dhanka he
 The mausoleum built in the center shows the combination of beauty in its architectural superiority
 tajmahal imaarat samooh kii sanrachana kii khaas baat he, ki yah purnataya samametiya he
 Its construction was almost completed in 1648
 ustad ahamed lahori ko praayah iskaa pradhan roopankankarta mana jaataa he
 The center of the Taj Mahal is the white marble tower on a square foundation base
 yah ek samametiya imaarat he, jisamen ek ewan yani ativ vishaal vakrakaar dwaar he
 a large dome is adorned above this building
 adhiktar mogul madhbaron jaise, iske mul avyav farsi udgam se hai
 Its base is a large multi-orbital structure
 yah pradhan kaksh ghanaakaar he, jiskaa prayek kinaaraa 55 meter he 
 On the long sides there is a heavy pishtaq, or vaulted ceiling chamber door
 yah upar bane mehrab vaale chajje se sammilit he
 On either side of the main arch, one above the other in style, two or two additional pistachios are built on either side
 isi style main, kaksh ke chaaron kinaaron par do-do pishtaak bane hai
 This composition is perfectly symmetrical on each side of the building, which makes this building an octagon rather than a square, but with the four sides of the corner being much smaller than the other four sides, it would be appropriate to call it square
 makbare ke chaaron ore chaar minaaren mul aadhaar chaowkee ke chaaron konon main, imaarat ke drishy ko ek chaukhate main baandhti prathit hoti hai
 Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan's fake graves are in the main hall
 ye khub alankrita hai, evam inaki asal nichle tal par sthit he
 The most magnificent part of the tomb is the dome of the most beautiful marble on the tomb
 isaki oonchaai lagbhag imaarat ke aadhaar ke baraabar, 35 meter he or yah ek 7 meter unche belanaakaar aadhaar par sthit he
 It is also called onion-shaped dome according to its size
 iskaa shikhar ek ulate rakhe camel se alankrita he
 This inserts the edges of the dome at the summit
 gumbad ke aakaar ko iske chaar kinaaron par sthit chaar choti gumbadakaari chhatriyon se or bal miltaa he
 The dome of the umbrellas are copies of the shape of the main dome, the only difference being the size
 inke stambhakaar aadhaar, chat par aantarik prakaash kii vyavastha hetu khule hai
 The high-pitched vase of the confluence further adds to the height of the dome
 mukhya gumbad ke saath-saath hi chhatriyon evam guladaston par bhi kamalaakar shikhar shobhaa detaa he
 The famous component of traditional Persian and Hindu architectural art on the crest of the dome and chhatris is beautiful in a metallic urn
 mukhya gumbad ke kirit par kalash he 
 This peak Kalash was of gold till the early 1800 AD and now it is made of bronze
 yah kirit-kalash farsi evam hindu vaastu kala ke ghatakon kaa ekikrut sangyojan he
 It is also found on the summit of Hindu temples
 is kalash par chandramaa bana he, jisaki nok swarg kii ore ishaara karti hai
 Due to their planning, the tip of the moon and the urn form the shape of a trident, which is a symbol of the Hindu god Shiva
 mukhya aadhaar ke chaaro konon par chaar vishaal minaaren sthit hai
 It is 40 meters high each
 yah minaaren tajmahal kii banaavat kii samametiya pravriti darshit karatin hai
 These minarets are built in the same way as the minarets built to offer prayers in the mosque
 prayek minar do-do chazzon dwaara teen samaan bhaagon main banty he
 Above the tower is the last terrace, on which are built an umbrella similar to the main building
 in par vahi kamalaakar akruti evam kirit kalash bhi hai
 There is a special thing in these minarets, these four are tilted outward, so that in case of ever falling, they fall outwards, and do not cause any damage to the main building
 tajmahal kaa bahari alankaran, mughal vaastukala kaa utkrishtatam udhaaharan hai
 As the surface area changes, the area of the larger pishtaq is smaller and its ornamentation also changes in the same proportion
 alankaran ghatak rogan yaa gachakaari se athwa nakkashi evam ratna jad kar nirmit hai
 Has completely complied with the ban on Islam's anthropomorphic figure

 Quran verses have been used for decoration throughout the region
 haal hi main hue shodhon se gyaat hua he, ki amaanat khan ne hi un aayaton kaa chunaav bhi kiya tha
 The text here is about the final decision, described in the Qur'an, and it contains the following verses from Sura: sura 91 – surya,– sura 112 – vishwaas kii shuddhta,– sura 89 – ushaa,– sura 93 – praatah prakaash,– sura 95 – anjir,– sura 94 – santvanaa,– sura 36 – yaa sin,– sura 81 – folding ap,– sura 82 – tut kar bikharana,– sura 84 – tukde hona,– sura 98 – sakshya,– sura 67 – riyasat,– sura 48 – vijay,– sura 77 – wo jo aage bheje gaye evam – sura 39 – bheed As soon as someone enters through the gate of the Taj Mahal, the calligraphy is amoort praaroop prayukt kiye gaye hai, khaskar aadhaar, minaaron, dwaar, masjid, jawaab main; or kuch-kuch makbare kii sataha par bhi

 According to Muslim tradition, elaborate decoration of the tomb is forbidden
 isaliye shahjahan evam mumtaj mahal ke parthiv sharir iske neeche tulanaatmak rup se saadhaaran, asli kabron main, main dafn hai, jinke mukh daane evam makka kii ore hai
 The tomb of Mumtaz Mahal is located in the center of the inner chamber, whose rectangular marble base is 1
5 meters wide and 2
5 meters long
 aadhaar evam upar kaa shringardaan rup, donon hi bahumoolya pattharon evam ratnon se jade
 hai
 The calligraphy done on this is in recognition and appreciation of Mumtaz
 iske dhakkan par ek uthaa hua ytaakar lozanj bana he, jo ki ek lekhan patt kaa abhas he
 Shah Jahan's tomb is to the south of Mumtaz's tomb
 yah puure kshetra main, ekmaatr drishy asammetiya ghatak he
 This disagreement is probably because Shah Jahan's tomb was not scheduled to be built here
 yah makbara mumtaj ke liye maatr bana tha
 This tomb is larger than Mumtaz's tomb, but shows the same component: a larger base, with some large adornments on it, the same lapidary and calligraphy that gives his identity
 tahkhaane main bani mumtaj mahal kii asli kabr par allaah ke ninyanwe naam khude hai jinamein se kuch hai "o nitivaan, o bhavy, o rajasi, o anupam, o apurv, o anant, o anant, o tejasvi

 In Persian mysticism, in the Mughal period Islamic text, Firdaus is described as a garden of perfect perfection
 isamen ki ek kendriya parvat yaa strot yaa fawwaare se chaar nadiyaan chaaron dishaao, uttar, dakshin, purv evam pashchim kii ore bahatin hai, jo baag ko chaar bhaagon main baantatin hai
 Most of the Mughal Charbagh are rectangular, with a pavilion / mausoleum in its center
 keval tajmahal ke baagon main yah asaamanyata he; ki mukhya ghatak mandap, baag ke ant main sthit he
 From the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or Chandni Bagh on the other side of the Yamuna River, the Archaeological Survey of India has concluded that the Yamuna River was also a part of the form of this garden and should also be counted as one of the rivers of heaven
 baag ke khaake evam uske vaastu lakshan, jaise ki fawwaare, inten, sangmarmar ke paidal path evam jyamitiya eent-jadit kyaariyaan, jo kashmir ke shalimaar baag se ekarup hai, jataate hai ki in donon kaa hi vaastukar ek hi ho saktaa he, ali mardaan
 The initial description of the garden shows the excess of its trees, roses, kumud or Nargis and fruit trees
 jaise jaise mughal samrajya kaa patan hua, baagon kii dekhe rekhe main kami ai
 When its management came in the British state, they changed its gardens like the gardens of London

 These buildings are also mostly built of red sandstone, and depict small tombs of that period
 in deevaaron kii baagon se lagi andruni ore main stambh sahit torana vaale galiyare hai
 This is the style of Hindu temples, which were later adopted in mosques as well
 diwaar main bich-bich main gumbad vaali gumtiyaan bhi hai bhi ek smarak swaroop he
 It is also made of marble and red sandstone
 yah aarmabhik mughal baadshahon ke vaastukala kaa smarak he
 Its arch is a copy of the arch of the Taj Mahal
 iske pishtaak mehrabon par sulekhan se alankaran kiya gaya he
 In this, floral relief is used with bass relief and peatra dura mosaic
 mehrabi chat evam deevaaron par yahan kii anya imaaraton jaise jyamitiya namoonay banaae gaye hai
 At the far end of this group are two huge red sandstone buildings, facing the tomb
 inke pichhawade purvi evam pashchimi deevaaron se jude hai, evam donon hi ek duusare kii pratibimb akruti hai
 The western building is a mosque, and the eastern is called Jawab, whose primary purpose is architectural balance, and continues to be used as a visitor room
 in donon imaaraton ke bich antar yah he, ki masjid main ek mehrab kam he, usamen makka kii ore aalaa bana he, evam jawaab ke farsh main jyamitiya namoonay bane hai, jabaki masjid ke farsh main 569 namaaz padhane hetu bichhaune ke praturup kaale sangmarmar se bane hai
 The original form of the mosque is very similar to other mosques built by Shah Jahan, especially Masjid Jahanuma, or Delhi's Jama Masjid; a large hallway or chamber or courtyard, on which three domes are built
 is kaal kii mughal masjiden, punyasthaan ko teen bhaagon main baantatin hai; bichon bich mukhya sthaan, evam dono ore chote sthaan
 Every shrine in the Taj Mahal opens into a large arch cellar
 yah saathi imaaraten 1643 main puri huin
 The Taj Mahal was built on a small land plateau at the southern end of the delimited Agra city
 shahjahan ne iske badale jaipur ke maharaja jaisingh ko agra shahar ke madhya ek vrahat mahal diya tha
 An area of about three acres was dug, and it was filled with garbage and made fifty meters high from the river surface, so that it could be protected from dampness
 makbare ke kshetra main, pachaas kune khod kar kankad-pattharon se bharkar neenv sthaan banaaya gaya
 Then, instead of the traditional bamboo bamboo, a very large tomb-like structure was built of bricks
 yah dhaanchaa itnaa bada tha, ki abhiyantrikon ke anumaan se use hataane main hi saalon lag jate
 The solution was that according to Shah Jahan's order, the local farmers were given a free hand that anyone could pick up any bricks in a day and that structure was cleaned overnight
 sari nirmaan saamagree evam sangmarmar ko niyat sthaan par pahunchaane hetu, ek pandrah kilometre lambaa mitti kaa dhaal banaaya gaya
 Twenty to thirty oxen were plowed in specially built trains and the stones were brought here
 ek vistrut paid evam balli se bani, charkhi chalaane kii pranali banaai gai, jisase ki khandon ko icchit sthanon par pahunchaaya gaya
 The rhat system was used to bring water from the river
 usase pani upar bane bade tanks main bharaa jaataa tha
 Then it was filled in three secondary tanks, from where it was transported to places by tubes
 aadharshila evam makbare ko nirmit hone main baarah saal lage
 The remaining buildings and parts were completed in the next ten years
 inamen pehle minaaren, phir masjid, phir jawaab evam ant main mukhya dwaar bane
 Because this group formed in several stages, there are many differences in its manufacture-end date
 yah isaliye he, kyonki purnataa ke kai pruthak mat hai
 For example, the main mausoleum was completed in 1643, but the remaining group buildings continued to be built
 isi prakaar isaki nirmaan keemat main bhi bhinnataayen hai, kyonki isaki keemat tay karne main samay ke antaraal se kaaphi fark aa gaya he
 Even then the total value is estimated at around 3 billion 20 crores rupees; Which can be more than trillions of dollars at present, if converted to the current currency
 tajmahal ko sampoorn bharat evam asia se laai gai saamagree se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 More than 1,000 elephants were used for traffic during construction

 Kangre, Burji and Kalash etc
 were the makers, the other who had only floral cut on the marble, etc
 Some of the twenty-seven artisans who formed the creation unit

 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya
 ek daraar ke parinaam swaroop nae mahaasaagar, uttar atlantic mahaasaagar kaa nirmaan hua
 The Atlantic Ocean was not uniformly open; Rifts began to form in the north-central Atlantic
 dakshin atlantic kriteshs tak nahin khulaa tha
 Lauresia started moving clockwise, it moved north to North America and south to Eurasia
 loresia ke ghadi kii disha main badhane se tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta bhi band ho gaya
 In the meantime a new rift had also begun to form on the other side of Africa with the adjacent margins of East Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar leading to the creation of the southwestern Indian Ocean, also opening up in the Cretaceous
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa doosraa mahatvapurn charan praarambhik criteshas kaal main shuru hua jab chota vishaal mahadweep gondvanaa anekon mahadwipon main alag-alag vibhakt ho gaya
 Around 200 MA, the Simaria continent collided with Eurasia as described above
 However, a subduction zone was created when Cimaria collided
 is sabadakshan kshetra ko tethian trench kaha gaya tha
 This sea trench was probably subducted as the Tethyan mid-ocean Ridge, this ridge responsible for the expansion of the Tethys Ocean
 yah sambhawatah africa, bharat or australia ke uttar kii ore badhane kaa kaaran bana tha
 In the early Cretaceous period, the Atlantic, which is today's South America and Africa, was eventually separated from eastern Gondwana, opening the way to the "south Indian Ocean"
 madhya kriteshs kaal main gondvanaa ne vikhandit hokar dakshin atlantic mahaasaagar kaa maarg khol diya tha kyonki dakshin america ne africa se dur pashchim kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The South Atlantic was not uniformly developed; Rather it formed as a crack from north to south
 iske alaava usee dauraan madagascar or bharat antarctic se alag hone lage the or uttar kii ore badhane lage the, jisase hind mahaasaagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Madagascar and India separated from each other in the 100–90 MA at the end of the Cretaceous period
 bharat 15 centimetre prati varsh kii gati se uresia kii ore uttar disha main badhata rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band kar diya jabaki madagascar vahiin thahar gaya tha or africa plate main sthir ho gaya tha
 The remainder of New Zealand, New Caledonia and Zealandia began to diverge from Australia and was moving eastward towards the Pacific and opened the way to the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa teesraa mahatvapurn or antim charan praarambhik sinojoik yug main puraa hua
 Lauresia was separated when North America / Greenland was liberated from Eurasia and in about 60–55 MA it opened the Norwegian Sea
 The Atlantic and Indian Ocean continued to expand and the Tethys Ocean's route was closed
 isi bich australia antarctic se vibhajit ho gaya or teji se uttar kii ore bad gaya, thik usee tarah jaisaa 40 million se adhik varsh pehle bharat ne kiya tha or vartmaan main yah purvi asia ke saath ek takkar kii sthiti main he
 Both Australia and India are currently growing in the northeast direction at a speed of 5-6 centimeters per year
 takreeban 280 eme main panzia kii utpatti ke baad se antarctic dakshin dhruv main yaa iske paas rahaa he
 India collided with Asia at the beginning of about 35 MA which led to the formation of the Himalayan orogeny and the Tethys seaway was eventually closed; This collision continues even today
 africa plate ne pashchim se uttar-pashchim tak europe kii ore apni dishaao ko badalanaa shuru kar diya tha or dakshin america uttar kii disha main badhane laga tha, jisase yah antarctic se alag ho gaya or pehali baar antarctic ke aasapaas sampurna samudri parisancharan shuru ho gaya, jiske kaaran mahadweep teji se thanda hone laga or himandiyon kaa nirmaan hone laga
 sinojoik yug ke dauraan hone vaali anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon main california kii khadi kaa khulanaa, alps kaa utthan or japani samudr kaa bananaa shaamil tha
 The fragmentation of Pangea in the Great Rift Valley continues to this day

 Tujhe Nahin Lega is a 1989 Hindi language film
 elises adventures in vanderland louis carol ke upnaam ke tahat british lekhak charles lutwig dodson dwaara 1865 main likhit upanyaas he
 It features the story of a girl named Alice who falls into a rabbit den, into a fantasy world populated by strange and human-like creatures
 yah kahani, dodson ke mitron ke sanketon se bhari he
 The way this story has introduced the argument has given this story lasting popularity among adults as well as children
 ise "saahitiyik bakawaas" style ke ek sabase achche udhaaharan ke rup main mana jaataa he, or iskaa kathanaatmak path or sanrachana kaaphi prabhaavshaalee rahi he, khaskar fantasy style main
 Ellis was written in 1865, exactly three years after the incident, when Reverend Charles Lutwig Dodgson and Reverend Robinson Duckworth set sail on a boat across the Thames River with three little girls: ve teen ladkiyaan oxford vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or christ carch ke dean ke saath-saath westminster skool ke headmaster, henry jorge lidele kii betiyaan thi
 Much of the book's adventures are based on and influenced by the people, circumstances and buildings of Oxford and Christ Church, such as the "rabbit Hole" which signifies the actual staircase behind the main hall of Christ Church
 yah mana jaataa he ki ripan cathedral main, jahaan carol ke pita ek canan the, griphon or khargosh kii ek nakkashi ne kahani ke liye prerana pradaan kii
 The journey began on the Fauley Bridge near Oxford and ended five miles away in the village of Godstow
 samay bitaane ke liye reverend dodson ne ladakiyon ko ek kahani sunai, jisamen purna sanyogvash nahin, ek elice naam kii uchaat man kii ladki he jo romaanch kii talash main nikalati he
 The girls liked it and Alice Liddell asked Dodson to write it for her
 After a long delay - over two years - he finally did so and on 26 November 1864 gave Alice a handwritten manuscript of the Alice's Adventures Under Ground, which had Dodgson's own drawings
 kuch logon sahit martin gardenar ko ashanka he ki ek purv-sanskaran bhi tha jise baad main khud dodson ne nasht kar diya, jab unhone haathon se ek adhik vistrut pratilipi mudrit kii, lekin iskaa samarthan karne ke liye pratham drushtya koi gyaat sakshya nahin he
 But even before Ellis received his copy, Dodgson was preparing to expand its publication and the 15,500-word original story to 27,500 words, most notably adding episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad t-party
 Related In 1865, Dodgson's story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by "lewis Carroll" was published, with illustrations by John Tenniel
 2,000 ke pratham prakaashan ko roak diya gaya kyonki tenial ne print gunvattta par aapatti kii
 a new version was published soon, which was released in December of the same year, but dated to 1866
 or phir aisa hua ki, mul sanskaran ko aplaton ke neuyork prakaashan ghar ko dodson kii anumati se bech diya gaya
 Appleton's Ellis binding was almost identical to Macmillan's Ellis of 1866, with the publisher's name just downstream
 aplaton ke elice kaa mukh prishth ek niveshan tha jisane 1865 ke mul macmillan mukh prishth ko radd kiya or is par neuyork prakaashak kii chhap or 1866 kii taarikh thi

 The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title Alice in Wonderland, an alternate title popularized by numerous adaptations of stage, film, and TV produced over the years
 is sheershak ke kuch mudran main, elises adventures in vanderland or uski agali kadi thru da looking glass, or whot elice found der, donon maujuud hai
 Chapter 1 - Inside the Rabbit's Den: Alice is bored with her sister by the river, when she sees a white rabbit with a clothed watch running away
 vah uske peeche-peeche jate hue ek khargosh kii maand ke andar jaati he jahaan neeche vah vibhinn aakaar ke kai band daravaaje vaale ek ajeeb haul main pahunchati he
 She finds a small key to a door, but the door is too small for her, but through which she sees an attractive garden
 use tab ek bottle milti he jis par likhaa hota he "mujhe piyo", us bottle kii saamagree use bahut chota bana detii he jisase vah us kunjee tak pahunch jaati he
 a cake with "eat Me" on it makes it such a huge size that its head hits the ceiling
 adhyay 2- aansu kaa talab: elice dukhi ho jaati he or roti he jisase uske aansuon se us haul main baadh aa jaati he
 After being made small again by holding a fan in his hand, Alice meets a rat swimming in her tears, a rat also swimming
 vah uske saath thodi si baat karnaa chaahati thi par vah sirf apni billi ke bare main baat kar saki, jisase vah chuha naaraaz ho gaya
 Chapter 3 - Caucus Race and a Long Story: a sea of tears overflows with crowds of other animals and birds
 elice or anya jaanavar, kinare ekatrit hote hai or unke samaksh sawaal yah he ki kaise phir se sookhaa jaae
 chuha unhen wiliam vijeta par ek bahut hi sookhaa vyaakhyaan detaa he
 The dodo decides that the best way to get everyone dry would be a caucus-race, under which everyone would run in a circle with no clear winner
 anjaane main apni billi ke bare main baat karke, elice, antat sabhi jaanwaron ko daraa kar dur kar detii he
 Chapter 4-rabbit sends Little Bill: The White Rabbit reappears to find the Queen's gloves and fan
 vah elice ko ghar ke andar jaakar un chizon ko punah praapt karne kaa aadesh detaa he, lekin ek baar andar jate hi vah badi hone lagati he
 The frightened rabbit orders his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb onto the roof and go down the chimney
 Outside, Alice hears the sound of animals that had gathered to see her huge hand
 bheed us par kankad phekati he, jo chote kek ke tukdo main parivartit ho jate hai or jab elice in tukdon ko khaati he to vah apane vaastavik aakaar main aa jaati he
 Chapter 5- Advice from a Caterpillar: Alice arrives at a mushroom and finds a caterpillar sitting there drinking a hookah
 caterpillar elice se sawaal karata he or elice apni kavita yaad na rakh paane kii asamarthta ke saath mishrit apni maujuuda pahchaan sankat ko sweekaarti he
 Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one part of the mushroom will make her taller and the other part will make her shorter
 vah mashroom se do tukade todatii he
 One part of the mushroom makes him even smaller than before, while the other part lengthens his neck and reaches it among the trees, where a pigeon sits mistaking him as a serpent
 kuch prayaas karke, elice khud ko apane vaastavik kad main waapas laati he
 She stumbles upon a small ground and then uses a mushroom to reach a suitable height
 adhyay 6-suar or kaali mirch: ek fish-footman ke paas ghar kii rani ke liye ek nimantran he jo vah ek frog-footman ko detaa he
 Alice watches this exchange carefully and then, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, introduces herself into the house
 rani kaa rasoiyaa bartan fek rahaa he or ek soup bana rahaa he jisame bahut sari kaali mirch padi he or jiske kaaran elice, rani or uskaa baccha bahut buree tarah se cheenk rahen hai
 The queen gave her baby to Alice, and the child was transformed into a pig so that Alice's surprise was not confined
 adhyay 7-e mad tii party: cheshair cat ek ped par prakat hota he or use march hair ke ghar kii ore nirdeshit karata he
 He disappears, but his grin is left floating behind in the air and prompts Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat
 saw
 Alice is a guest at the "mad" Tea Party, with the hater, March Heyer, and a sleeping doormouse who sleeps for most of the chapter
 anya paatro ne elice ko kai paheliyaan or kahaniyaan deen
 The Mad Hatter states that they drink tea throughout the day, as time has permanently stabilized and punished him at 6 in the evening
 elice, paheliyon kii bauchhaar se apamaanit or klaant ho jaati he or vah yah daawa karte hue party se chali jaati he ki yah party uske ab tak ke jivan kii sabase murkhtapurna party thi
 Chapter 8 - Queen's Crockett Ground: Alice leaves the tea party and enters a garden where she is met by three living cards who were coloring white roses in red because the Queen of Hearts hates white 
 taash ke patton, raajaaon or raniyon or yahaan tak ki ek safed khargosh kaa ek julus bageeche main pravesh karata he
 Alice then meets the king and queen
 rani, jise khush karnaa bahut mushkil he, apane takiyakalam "of wyeth hiz head" ko prastut karti he
 Which came out of his mouth due to a little dissatisfaction with a citizen
 elice ko aamantrit kiya gaya rani or uske pyaadon ke saath crocket kaa khel khilne ke liye jo ki jald hi avyavasthit ho jaataa he
 The live flamingos were being used as mugdars and the hedgehogs were made balls and Ellis once again met the Cheshire Cat
 tabhi queen of hearts ne billi kaa sar kalam karne kaa aadesh diya, jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki uske jallaad ne shikaayat kii ki yah asambhav he kyonki us billi kaa keval sar hi dikhataa he
 Since the cat belongs to the queen, the queen agrees to release the queen from captivity to resolve the issue
 adhyay 9-mock taratal kii kahani: elice ke anurodh par rani ko crocket ground par laayaa gaya
 She thinks on finding morality in everything around her
 queen of hearts ne use maut ki sazaa kii dhamkee de kar use vahaan se bhaga diya or elice ko greephone se milwaaya, jo use mock taratal ke paas le gaya
 Mock Turtle is very unhappy without any trouble
 vah yah bataane kii koshish karata he ki kaise vah skool main ek asli taratal hua karata tha, jise greephone bich main hi baadhit kar detaa he taaki ve ek khel khel saken
 Chapter 10-lobster Quadrille Mock Turtle and Gryphon dance to the rhythm of the Lobster Quadril while Ellis recites "'tis the voice of the lobster"
 mock taratal unke liye "beautiphul soup" ga rahaa tha jiske dauraan greephone elice ko ek asann mukademe ke liye khinch kar le jaataa he
 Chapter 11-who Stole Tarts ?: Alice becomes part of a lawsuit where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing Queen's tarts
 juri main vibhinn jaanavar sammilit hai jiname bill di lizard bhi shaamil he or white rabit nyaayalay kaa turyavadk he or king of hearts nyaayadhish he
 During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is growing very fast

 In "'chapter 6"', the disappearance of the Cheshire cat leads Ellis to say his most memorable line: "


 a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing i ever saw in all my life!" In "chapter 7", Hatter gives his famous puzzle without an answer: "why does the raven like a writing table?" Although Carroll's aim was to have no answer for the riddle, in a new role in the 1896 version of "alice", he offers several answers: "because it can produce some notes, though 


 they are too flat
" : And it is never put from the wrong end! "puzzle expert Sam Lloyd offered the following solutions: * Because the note they are noted for, They are not noted for musical notes * Poe wrote on both * Both have an ink-like quill * Bills and tales are one of their specialties * Because they both stand on their feet, hide their steel and they Should be discontinued, several other answers are listed "the Annotated Ellis"
 In Frank Bedor's novel "horned Red", a parody of the main villain Queen Red |] Queen of Hearts]) meets Lewis Carroll and declares that the answer to the riddle is "because i say so"
 Carol is afraid to counter him
 "because i say so"
 Carol is afraid to counter him

 * In Chapter 2, "pond of Tears" Ellis tries to multiply but produces some strange results: "" Let me see: four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven, oh dear! i will never reach twenty at this rate!

 For example, in the second chapter, Alice assumes that the mouse must be French and speaks to her the first sentence of the text of her French book: "où est ma chatte?"
