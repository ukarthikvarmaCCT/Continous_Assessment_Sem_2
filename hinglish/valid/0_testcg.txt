 Neeraj Kumar now has just four days left for the chair of Delhi Police Commissioner, but before leaving the chair, he wants to cash in on the game of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim
 ipel main spot phixing kii jaanch ke dauraan unke haath daaud kii awaz lag gai
 The voice that no one has heard for years
 ab usee aawaaj ke dam par wo ritairement se pehle apane kariyar kaa aakhri bada chargeshit daayar karne ja rahe hai, kyonki unke hisaab se isi aawaaj main chupa he khel daaud kaa
 For the first time in twenty years, the police of India claimed to have captured the voice of the most dreaded don Dawood Ibrahim
 saath hi saath cricket ke satte ke sabase bade khel ko duniya ke saamne kholane kii hunkaar bhi bhari
 Dawood Ibrahim's personal mobile phone recorded in Karachi recorded seven to eight minutes of conversation is now being told as the biggest evidence of IPL spot fixing
 dilli ke police kamishnar niraj kumaar kaa daawa he ki wo daaud ibrahim ke khilaaf ek pukhta chargeshit taiyaar kar rahe hai, jo pehali baar di-company or cricket betting kii sathganth ko beparda kar degi
 The truth is that before leaving the chair of the police commissioner, Neeraj Kumar wants to make sure that the charge sheet is prepared before he retires, so that he can stand by the police headquarters by applying Dawood's title
 lekin sawaal uthaane vaale ab ye kah rahe hai ki tepe main daaud kii hi aawaaj he, isaki kya guarantee he?baat sirf daaud kii aawaaj kii nahin he, balki adaalat main rakhe gaye saboot bhi aadhe-adhure hi najar aate hai
 The Special Cell of Delhi Police has kept a transcript of Dawood's 160-second conversation in the court, referring to a minister at the end of it
 ye wo mantri hai, jinke bare main daaud aath milian kii ek deal kaa zikr apane gurgey doctor javed chutani se kar rahaa he
 When the defense raised questions about the name of this minister in the court, the police felt as if the snake had swollen
 sach to ye he ki kamishnar sahab bhi ab tak mantri ke naam par khamosh hai
 Why is the commissioner silent on the minister? Neeraj Kumar, who has held high positions in the CBI and Delhi Police for years, has claimed that he has demolished many forts of the underworld during his job
 khaskar indiaj most wanted daaud ibrahim ke network ko todane main unhone kamaal ke kai kaam kiye hai
 This is the reason that in the chargesheet filed in spot-fixing, the commissioner has revealed many secrets of Dawood for the first time on betting and even claimed that during the IPL, Dawood Ibrahim himself opens betting prices in every match
 kamishnar sahab ko ye bhi maaloom he ki daaud ibrahim kabhi-kabhi haar-jeet par jaan-boojhkar galat tip detaa he, taaki uske khaas buki jabardast paisa kama saken
 But till now, Neeraj Kumar, who knows Dawood's background, could not gather any information on the mention of Dawood's most important revelation
 vaise mumkin to ye bhi he ki daaud kii rag-rag ke bare main jaanane vaala kahin ye jaankaree dena hi na chaah rahaa ho? kyonki maamla santari kaa nahin, mantri kaa he
 What is true can be revealed at any time within the next four days, because Neeraj Kumar, the chairperson of the commissioner, now has only four days
 daaud kii awaz ke pakade jane kii kahanidaood ibrahim kii awaz ke pakade jane kii kahani bhi daaud jaisi hi he
 Delhi Police was listening to some phones in the month of March this year and during this time he heard a 160 second conversation
 bakaul dilli police, baad main jab ro ko us aawaaj ke namoonay bheje gaye, to pataa chalaa ki anjaane main anderworld kii sabase badi aawaaj kaid ho chuki thi
 Dawood was saying something to his henchman on the phone
 hindustan main daaud ibrahim kaa betting sindicket chalaa rahaa tha ramesh vyas, jo is vakt police ke kabje main he
 According to the police, Ramesh Vyas himself has also confessed that he used to do betting only and only for d-company and for d-company only
 ramesh vyas ko phone dubai se aata tha
 Delhi Police claims that it has strong evidence against the d-company in the spot-fixing case
 duusari taraf di-company kaa kahana he ki phixing yaa satte se uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin
 Reversely, the d-company is blaming the Chhota Rajan gang for spot-fixing in the IPL
 rajasthan royles ke star khilaadi srisanth ke police giraft main aate hi jab phixing kaa sabase bada khulaasa hua, to ungali sidhe daaud ibrahim kii di company par uthi
 According to the police investigation, the entire game was made on the instigation of Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim
 anis or shakeel milakar hi daaud kii di-company karachi se chalaate hai
 But in an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, Chhota Shakeel put the fixing charge on the syndicate of his known enemy Chhota Rajan
 sach to ye he ki chota shakeel kaa ye ilzaam ek baar phir se gangvaar kii shuruyaat he, jo is baar drugs or real estate kii jagah cricket kii pich par ho rahi he
 But as soon as this statement of Chhota Shakeel came on Aaj Tak, Chhota Rajan's gang stirred
 kuch hi der main chota rajan kii taraf se jawaab aayaa ki di company apane upar lagi tohamaton se bachane ke liye betting kaa iljaam dusron par laga rahi he
 Rajan says that small Shakeel is misleading the police
 betting ke peeche uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 According to Chhota Rajan, betting is hatched by Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim
 ek-duusare par ye tohamatein zaahir he zubaani jamaa kharch nahin he
 When two well-known enemies come together and speak against each other, it is not even a minor matter
 ishaara saaf he ki donon main ye gangvaar kii ek nai shuruyaat he
 The only difference is that the two most dreaded gangs of Hindustan have chosen a cricket pitch for the first time because of the Rs 40 thousand crores on that pitch, which has both eyes on

 australia ke purv captain mark tailor (mark Taylor) kaa maananaa he ki team india ke captain viraat kohli (virat Kohli) ko maidan par apane aakraamak vyavhaar main kuch lagaam lagane kii jarurat he
 Taylor praised Kohli's out-of-field conduct but felt that the Indian captain's 'extremely' aggressive attitude on the field was not needed for the game
 australia ke sabase safal captainon main se ek tailor ne ek vaakye kaa udhaaharan diya jisamen vah kohli kaa intervyuu lenaa chaahate the or isamen unka vyavhaar kaaphi shisht rahaa tha
 Cricketer-turned-commentator Taylor said, "four years ago when i was with Channel Nine while i was interviewing Virat Kohli, i got a chance to know about his personality
 unhone aisa kuch nahin kaha tha lekin jis tareeke se unhone khud ko pesh kiya, vah shandaar tha
 Taylor said, "we were shooting in the studio at the Adelaide Oval a day before the test when the national anthem started loudly on the loudspeaker for rehearsal and we were forced to take a break
" kuch minute baad raashtragan khatm hua to bharat ke media manager ne mujhe kaha ki aadhe ghante kaa samay khatm ho gaya he or kohli ko uthne kaa ishaara kiya
 'there was a bit of fun in this,' Justin Langer said about Tim paine-virat Kohli's debate, 'mark Taylor wrote in his column in the Sydney Morning Herald,' Virat Kohli asked me if i asked him to do it instead i need more time
 maine unase kaha ki main unase or sawaal poochna chahta hum
 So they said, 'come on, let's sit down and get it done
 maine sochaa ki yah shandaar tha
 However, Taylor, who scored 7525 runs in 107 Tests, said Kohli was a bit different on the field
 unhone kaha, ‘vah shandaar ballebaaj hai lekin kaaphi aakraamak he
 i wouldn't be surprised if most Australian players get to see his second look which is unfortunate

 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue arun sinha ne kaha ki adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karte hue prashanth kishor ne vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii jise lekar patna police ko unke khilaaf exiaar darj kar unhen giraftaar karnaa chahie
 BJP MLA Nitin Naveen said that Prashant Kishore was interfering unnecessarily in the students' election and meeting the Vice Chancellor, he pressurized them to ensure the victory of all JDU candidates on election day
 bijepi netaaon kii maang thi ki akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ke jin 10 chaatro ko hiraasat main liya gaya tha unhen choda jaae
 In this case, the police released 9 students on Tuesday, while one student Karna got bail from the court
 karn ko jamaanat milane ke baad hi bijepi netaaon ne pirbahor thane par apane dharne ko samaapt kiya magar prashanth kishor kii giraftaar kii maang ko lekar vah ade rahe
 Prashant Kishore tweeted: Regarding the incident that happened to him on Monday in the university, Prashant Kishore also tweeted on Tuesday and said that students of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad threw stones at his car in view of the possible defeat in the election
 The news about my injury is false
 I'm fine, thanks for the concern
 @abvpvoiceu need to do better than let few hooligans & antisocial elements become your face in Bihar
 The nervousness of a possible defeat in the Patna University Students' Union election will be nothing short of stoning my car

 Tejashwi taunted that Sushil Modi was paying more attention to the devotion of Nitish Kumar than his mlas
 dilli police krime branch ne do aise logon ko giraftaar kiya he jo aresas ke member ban kar bijepi ke netaaon se chanda or avaidh vasuuli karne kaa kaam kar rahe the
 Acting on the complaint of former BJP MLA Anil Sharma, the police have arrested these accused
 police inase poochtacha kar rahi he
 According to the information, two youths named Shivam and Mahendra were arrested by the police on the complaint of former BJP MLA Anil Sharma from rkpuram
 inamen se ek ladkaa paise lene ke liye unke paas arkepuram gaya tha
 If the police believes it is the work of a big gang
 inamen se ek aaropee mahendra ne poochtacha main kuch or hi bataaya
 Calling at the metro station by phone, according to Mahendra, he had registered for the job a few days ago at the site of OLX
 guuruuvaar ko uske paas kisi number se phone aayaa or naukari dene kii baat kahi
 In lieu of good money, he was given the job of document collection from some people
 isi kaam ke liye use dilli ke rajeev chowk metro stesan par bulaayaa gaya
 When in doubt, Dia police was asked to bring the documents from Anil Sharma's address, but the person who had already called had asked Anil Sharma to keep the money ready
 shaq hone par anil ne police ko soochna de di thi
 When Mahendra reached Anil Sharma's house, the pre-existing police caught him, but Mahendra did not know that he had come to get the money
 faraar he is gang kaa mastermindpulice ne mahendra kii nishandehi par sivam naamak us ladke ko bhi pakad liya, jo use paise colect karne bheja tha
 This is the work of a vicious criminal, who makes a recovery for the job by making troubled boys his pawn
 police kii tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi abhi tak is maamle kaa mastermaid hathe nahi chadha he
 Police investigation is going on
 bijepi ne jis gujarat ko hindutv kii prayogshaala ke taur par sthapit kiya or vikaas kaa tadakaa lagaakar paanch baar chunaavon main jeet hasil kar satta par virajman hoti rahi, aaj usee gujarat kii siyaasi ranbhumi main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi use takkar de rahe hai
 In this war, caste equations and soft Hindutva remain Rahul's weapons
 rahul ke is sakriyata se gujarat main do dashakon se ventilator par padi congress main nai jaan phunkati najar aa rahi he
 Congress workers are full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 haalanki rahul ko is siyaasi jang main jin pantaron ke chalate badhat milti dikh rahi he, unke peeche congress ke gujarat prabharee or rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kaa dimag bataaya ja rahaa he
 Today, at least for Congressmen, Gehlot is in the role of Chanakya in Gujarat
 rahul kaa laanching pad bana gujaratcongress gujarat main pichley 22 saal se satta se baahar he
 For the first time in these two decades, the party is seen competing with the BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa grih rajya hone ke naate gujarat main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kaaphi ahm hai
 The results of this election will write the meaning of the 2019 Lok Sabha election
 gujarat kaa chunaav aise vakt main ho rahaa he jab 2019 kaa chunaav kareeb he, rahul gandhi kii congress adhyaksh ke rup main tajposhi honi he
 Rahul Gandhi made Gujarat his launch pad and has come down to prove himself
 rahul ke karnadhaar gahalotagujrat main congress ke paas bharat solanki, arjuna modvadiya or emele shaktisingh gohil jaise ginati ke netaa hai, lekin ye netaa sirf apni seat nikaalane tak hi simit hai
 In such a situation, the Congress in-charge of the state is Ashok Gehlot as the guide of the Congress and Rahul Gandhi
 gahalot pichley kai maheenon se gujarat main deraa daale hue hai
 As Gujarat incharge, Ashok Gehlot has created such a road map to create an atmosphere in favor of the party which has become a problem for BJP
 dharm se jati par lautati gujarat kii raajnneetigujarat main bijepi jati par dharm kaa rang chadhaakar pichley paanch chunaav se jeet darj karti aa rahi he
 Modi made the Congress more or less marginalized by this trump card
 ashok gahalot ne gujarat main bijepi se satta chhinane ke liye phir se dharm par jati kii raajnneeti ko haaavee kar diya he
 That is, the Congress strategy is to answer the Hindu card with the caste card
 bijepi kii raah main jaateey barierabijepi ke liye sabase mushkil baat yah he ki jatigat raajnneeti use raas nahin aati he
 Bihar Assembly elections are an example of this
 yahi vajah he ki congress netaa ashok gahalot ne bihar kii tarj par gujarat ke siyaasi ran ko jeetne ke liye jaateey card khelaa he
 Ashok Gehlot has to meet Rahul Gandhi when and what to talk to leaders like Trinity Alpesh Thakor, Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani, who came out of Gujarat's caste movement
 isaki puri patakatha likhi
 Alpesh Thakor has also joined the Congress
 congress ke jaateey card se bijepi main bechaini badi he
 Narendra Modi had to say in Gujarat that do not fall under the pretext of casteism, caste issues will hamper the development of the country
 vyuh-rachane main gahalot kaamyabgujrat main bijepi ko gherne ke liye gahalot ne notebandi, jiesti or patidaaron kii naaraazgi jaise muddon ko jamkar bhunaane kii koshish kii he
 Looking at the congress meetings and the efforts of the Congress, it seems that Gehlot has been successful to a great extent in formulating strategy and fiction in the battle of Gujarat
 gujarat main congress ke saare netaa bhi gahalot ke har plan kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Gehlot has decided such seats, where the Congress can win by working hard
 gahalot ne bijepi kii majboot siton par zyada energy west nahin karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 Congress has identified 135 such seats where it can compete with BJP
 congress ko tushtikaran se baahar nikaalane kii kavaydagujrat main rahul kii navasrujan yatra kaa plan bhi ashok gahalot ne banaaya he
 Where is Rahul to go, whom to meet and what action to take
 ye sab gahalot kii pathkatha kaa hissaa he
 The idea of rahul walking the path of soft Hindutva in Gujarat is also of Gehlot
 gujarat se rahul gandhi bijepi dwaara congress party par lagaae gaye 'hindu virdohi' or 'alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran' jaise aaropon kaa bhi jawaab dene kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The BJP was upset due to Rahul's visit to the temple
 a major reason for the Congress' defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was that the Antony Committee considered an anti-hindu image
 rahul ne gujarat yatra ke jariye congress kii hindu virdohi chhavi ko todane kii kavayad kii he
 Rahul Gandhi started the Navsajran Yatra with worship at the Dwarkadhish temple in Saurashtra
 rahul gujarat main apni yatra ke dauraan maathe par tilak lagaae or raste main padane vaali mandiron ke darshan or maathaa tekte hue dikhte hai, jisase bijepi baichaiyn he
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) stands by its recommendation to cancel 74 licenses of companies that do not start services on time
 isse doorsanchaar vibhaag (dot) duvidha kii sthiti main funs gaya he
 DOT has emphasized that only 12 licenses need to be canceled
 tri ne dot ko bheje patr main kaha he ki usne is bare main ucchtam nyaayalay ke do purv jajon se kanoonee raay le lee he
 He has supported the views of TRAI
 dot ne tri ko patr bhejkar disambar, 2006 se jari 74 licenson ko radd karne kii apni sifarish par punarvichaar karne ko kaha tha
 To this, TRAI has sent its reply and it continues with its old stand, which has created a difficult situation for the Department of Telecommunications
 dot ne tri ke 74 license radd karne kii sifarish ko sirf 12 tak simit kar diya tha
 DOT had said that only 15 licenses can be canceled in total for delay in starting services
 inamen teen ve license shaamil hai, jinke bare main tri ne sifarish nahin kii he
 "we agree with dot's views on the three licenses," TRAI said
 shesh ke maamle main ham yah dot par chhodte hai ki vah sabhi tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kitna jurmaana lagaataa he
 DOT says that according to the terms and conditions of the license, if an operator does not start service within 52 weeks of getting the license, he can be fined

 By evening, it was told that Rampal was in the ashram

 These are our associates, who were carrying out every activity outside the ashram for the last several days
 
 
 agar ye media vaale vahaan nahin hote to yahaan kya ho rahaa he, isaki koi jaankaree aap tak nahin pahunchati
 
 
 The question is what the media persons were punished for
 
 
 ? jab ve police ke banaae har niyam kaa paalan kar rahe the, to police ne laathiyon se un par hamalaa kyon kiya, or un par hamalaa karne kaa aadesh kisne diya
 
 
 Media people were just doing their work

 The supreme court kii paanch jajon kii peeth ne 26 sitambar ko vah faisla sunaaya jiskaa betaabi se intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha or ek ke mukaable chaar ke bahumat se aadhaar kanoon 2016 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata par mohar laga di
 But the court also appeared to believe that there is an excess of Aadhaar penetration in every sphere of public functioning, often called "function creep" (a technology used beyond its initial objective to lead to privacy violations)
 goes
 adaalat ne is kanoon kii dhara 57 ko radd kar diya, jo nijee sansthaaon ko apni sevaaon ke evaj main biomitric data samet aadhaar data maangane kii ijaajat detii thi
 The court refused to believe that commercial banks or digital wallet companies, such as Paytm, were required to ask for customer details
 mobile seva pradaata bhi ab sim card baantne se pehle aadhaar kii pahchaan dekhne yaa biomitric byore ikattha karne kii maang nahin kar sakate
 However some 88 crore bank accounts and 70 crore mobile numbers have already been linked with Aadhaar
 asal main faisle se asamahat jaj di
 why
 chandrachud ne yah tak vichaar jaahir kiya ki tamaam telecom companiyon ko vah sab aadhaar data mitaa dena chahie jo unhone ab tak ikattha kiya he
 The judges were also convinced that children could not be denied training because of not having an Aadhaar card, nor could schools and education boards associate this card with admissions and examinations
 atishay istemaal ko lekar aapattiyon or chetavaniyon ke baavjood bahumat jaj sahamat the ki aadhaar samaaj ke sabase darkinar logon ko bhi beshkeemtee seva muhaiyaa karaata he, or jaisaa ki nyaayamurti arjan kumaar sikri ne likhaa, pahchaan detaa he
 The court accepted the government's plea that it would be able to reach the benefits of welfare schemes in an efficient manner due to Aadhaar
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne daawa kiya ki aadhaar card ko pratyaksh laabh antaran (debiti) se jodgaye ke natijatan 90,000 karod rupye kii bachat hui
 But in a study conducted between January 2016 and March 2017 in the Union Territories of Puducherry, Chandigarh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the NITI Aayog came to the conclusion that the leakages were exactly the same as were assessed under the public distribution system
 arthshaastri reetika kheda ke mutabik, "aadhaar risaav ko band karne main kaamyaab nahin rahaa he or na hi yah kalyaan kaaryakramon main samaveshita laa sakaa he
 "instead," she says, "being thrown out or left out is built into the base ecosystem
 '' pradhan nyaayadhish kii adhyakshata main supreme court kii peeth ne sarkaar ko aagaah kiya ki "aadhaar sankhya nahin hone kii vajah se ek bhi shaks anaaj sareekhe kalyaan ke apane phaayde lene se chhotna nahin chahie
 "for economist Jean Dreze" judges other than Justice Chandrachud have failed to recognize the real danger that Aadhaar poses for privacy
 
 
 bahut saare database ko aapas main jodgaye or nigaraanee kaa ek dhaancha khadaa karne kii vah takat jo aadhaar sarkaar ko detaa he
 Even after this, the court repealed section 33 (2) of the Aadhaar Act, which allowed sharing of data on the basis of national security
 dhara 47 bhi radd kar di gai, jo aadhaar data kii chori kii shikaayat karne kaa haq keval sarkaar ko detii thi
 The Supreme Court also reminded the government that there is a need to introduce a strong data protection law as soon as possible
 aadhaar kii mukhar aalochak usha ramanathan ne kaha ki rajyasatta nagarikon ke upar jin tareekon se apni takat bhanj sakati he, uske prati keval nyaayamurti chandrachud hi samvedansheel the
 He argued that by passing the Aadhaar Act in the shape of the so-called Money Bill, the government fraudulently sidelined the Rajya Sabha and actually violated the Constitution
 haalanki ab court faisla de chukaa he
 Aadhaar will continue
 magar koshish kii gai he jisase uske prabhaavon ko kam kiya ja sake, use sarkaar or korporate, donon ke haathon main nagarikon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karne kaa aujaar banane se roka ja sake
 On the ground, the court has, by a majority vote, barred access to information of all citizens through Aadhaar
 *** The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the case of blackmoney involving the Rs 6,000 crore narcotics business in Punjab, has transferred its Chief Investigating Officer in the state
 sutron ke mutabik, jalandhar main ED ke sahaayak nideshak niranjan singh ke kolkata transfar kiye jane ke nirdesh shuukravaar shaam agency ke mukhyalay se jari kiye gayi
 He is believed to have been transferred on the basis that several important cases like the Saradha and Rose Valley scams are under investigation there and that his services will be better utilized there

 Sources associated with the ED said that there is no link between the transfer of Niranjan Singh drug case in which he is investigating
 aisa mahasoos kiya gaya he ki kolkata main unki sevaaon kii jarurat thi or vahaan par kshetreey prabharee ne idi mukhyalay se kuch achche adhikariyon ko bhejne kaa aagrah kiya tha
 He said that Niranjan Singh has been sent on an important task
 unke achche kaam ke kaaran unhen chunauteepurn kaary diya gaya he
 He was also awarded the Best Investigating Officer award along with other officials at a function last year and his work in money laundering and FEMA violations case has been excellent
 sutron ne bataaya ki niranjan singh ke baad kuch or adhikari kolkata bheje jaaenge, jabaki jalandhar main unke sthaan par dakshin bharat ke ek junior adhikari tainaat kiye jaaenge

 hamaare bacchon kii shaadi nahin ho paa rahi he, rishtedaari main baat kharaab ho gai he, hamaare bacchon ke naam puch kar bina bal kaate dukaan se waapas bhej diya jaataa he
 'the Dalits say,' Children have read and written, the times have changed, so one should live out of this old untouchability

 naksali ilaake main rasta bhatakane kaa dar kya hota he yah koi aamir khan or unki team se jaan saktaa he
 In fact, on Tuesday, Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and his team became nervous when they came to know that they had entered the Naxalite area of gaya within 10 km
 haalanki baad main bhul kaa andaja hone par team sahi raste par aa gai, lekan is dauraan sabhi ke chehre par pareshaani saaf jhalak rahi thi
 According to the information, Aamir Khan reached Patna at 9:30 am on Tuesday, from where he left for Gahlaur village in Gaya

 He was accompanied by the team of Bihar Police Party
 iske saath hi har jile main pravesh ke baad jila vishesh kii police team ko aamir ke kafile ko lead karnaa tha
 It happened, but it is said that after Jehanabad, when the team was going to enter Gaya district via Rajgir, the Nalanda police separated from the convoy thinking that the Gaya team would lead them
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 It was Amir Khan and his team who had to bear the brunt of the lack of coordination between the 30-minute team and the Rong Turnbehar police team
 bataaya jaataa he ki rajgir se do raste alag-alag dishaao main ja rahe the
 Due to not having the correct information, Aamir Khan's convoy went 10 km on the wrong path, which is actually a Naxalite area
 is bich saath chal rahi bihar police party ko bhul kaa andaja hua or unhone gaya police se sampark saadhaa, jiske baad team waapas rajgir pahunchi or phir sahi raste par aage badi
 It is said that this whole incident of taking the wrong route and wandering in Naxalite area was about 30 minutes
 is dauraan puri team nervas rahi or sabhi police kii is bhul par achraj jataate dikhe
 However, this mistake has also raised eyebrows towards the flaws of Bihar Police, which made VIP security as a normal activity

 com / ozj9vlzwum haal hi main apana 10waan berthde celibratt kar chuke fasebuk ko lekar bhale hi hamaari alag-alag dharna ho
 But one thing is certain that if used properly it has many benefits
 fasebuk par yaari-dosti or banate-bigadate rishton kii kahani to aapane bahut suni hogi, lekin jharkhand main ek BDO ne jis tarah se fasebuk kaa upyog kiya, usne is soshal site kii mahatta ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 This story of 14-year-old Usha, who is going to take the 10th examination, can give you the experience of a fairy tale
 lekin is baar pari ke haathon main jaadu kii chadi nahin balki ungaliyon ke neeche fasebuk states he
 Parents arose three years before the head of Usha Kumari of Kurumba village of Chandrapura in Bokaro district of the state
 tab uski umr 11 saal thi
 Usha's responsibility for upbringing came on her aunt, but due to poverty there was a shortage of food in the house
 ghar kii mali haalat dekh ushaa ne paas-pados ke maweshiyon ko charaane kaa kaam sambhaal liya
 Usuha was fond of reading and writing, so she kept going to the village school during this time
 lekin jab baat metric pariksha kii ai to aavedan ke liye paison kii kami ne ushaa ke sapanom ko chur-chur kar diya
 Seeing the financial condition of the house, Usha had decided that she would no longer be able to study further, but as a last ditch effort, she thought of seeking help from the area's BDO Pawan Kumar Mahato
 mulaakaat kii aas or niraashaajab ushaa BDO se milane pahunchi to vah kaam main vyast the
 He asks Usha to sit outside, but he forgets it due to the workload
 der hone ke kaaran niraash ushaa waapas ghar laut gai
 At the same time, when BDO Pawan Kumar left for home, his co-workers told him that the orphaned girl returned home with tears in hopes of meeting him
 pawan kumaar bataate hai ki is vaakye ne unhen andar tak hilaa kar rakh diya
 According to Pawan Kumar, he explored all the schemes related to Usha for providing government assistance, but Usha's age came as a major obstacle
 pareshaani, chintaa or fasebuk kii entripawan bataate hai ki ushaa kii madad kaa vichaar unhen lagaataar pareshaan kar rahaa tha, aise main unhone apane vichaaron ko fasebuk par post kar diya
 He says, 'in just a few hours i got hundreds of comments
 inamen kai doston ne ushaa ko god lene kii salaah di
 i too decided to adopt after considering it
 '
 
 
 And Usha's failure to overturn Usha's decision to adopt Usha was appreciated by many of her friends on Facebook and advised to do this noble cause soon
 aaj pawan kumaar apane faisle se bahut khush hai
 He says it has been very comforting
 ab ushaa ke bhavishya kii chintaa dur ho gai he
