 The fort has three large gates and has massive walls
 iske andar ek masjid he jisamen do taleey ashtabhuji stambh he
 According to Hindu literature, this fort is at the site of Indraprastha which used to be the huge capital of the Pandavas
 jabaki iskaa nirmaan afgaani shaasha sher shah suri ne 1538 se 1545 ke bich karaayaa gaya, jisane mughal badshaah humayun se dilli kaa singhaasana chin liya tha
 It is said that Mughal emperor Humayun died accidentally due to the fall of this fort from below
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli ko sarvapratham pandavon ne apni rajdhani indraprastha ke rup main basaaya tha vah bhi isapurv se 1400 varsh pehle, parantu iskaa koi pakkaa pramaan nahin hai
 In the south-eastern part of the old fort seen today, some trenches were dug for testing in 1955 and the pieces of pottery etc
 found were found to match the antiquities found from other sites related to the legend of Mahabharata, so that this old The recognition of the fort land being Indraprastha has gained some strength

 Re-excavation near the eastern wall of the old fort was also done between 1969 and 1973
 vahaan se mahabharat kaaleen maanav basasat ke koi pramaan to nahin mili lekin maury kaal se lekar praarambhik mogul kaal tak anwarat vah bhubhag maanav basaahat se paripurna rahaa
 Such evidences have been found in which period-specific coins, bead, clay utensils, small statues of burnt clay, Yakshi Yakshi, scripted postures etc
 are prominent which are displayed in the museum of the fort
 kehete hai ki mogul samraat humayun ne yamuna nadi ke kinare usee tile par jiske neeche indraprastha dabi padi he, apane swayan kii nagari “dinpanaah” sthapit kii thi
 After that when Sher Shah Sur conquered Humayun, he destroyed all the buildings and started the construction of present day Delhi, Sher Shahi or "shergarh"
 is bich humayun ne punah sanghatit hokar akraman kiya or apni khoi hui sultanate waapas paa lee
 It is believed that Humayun completed the construction of the fort in 1545

 jhukate samay uske pair lambey choge main kahin fas gayi or vah santulan kho kar gir padaa
 He died in the first half of 1556 only from the physical damage caused by this accident
 mahabharat main ullekith pandavon kii rajdhani indraprastha sambhavtah isi sthaan par thi
 These sentences are written on the inscriptions at various places in the old fort
 pandavon kii rajdhani indraprastha kahaan thi? is baat ko lekar logon main bahes hoti rahi he
 But based on the remains found in the excavations, a large section of archaeologists believe that the capital of the Pandavas must have been at this site
 yadhyapi puratatvavidon ke paas is baat ke pukhta pramaan nahin hai, lekin khudaai ke dauraan yahaan mili bartanon ke avasheshon se kile ke aasapaas pandavon kii rajdhani hone kii baat ko bal miltaa he
 The remains of such utensils have been found in excavations here, which have also been found at other places associated with Mahabharata
 iske alaava mahabharat se jude prasang or pracheen paramparaayen bhi is ore sanket karti hai, ki yahaan pandavon kii rajdhani rahi hogi
 There are very few cities in India that are as old as Delhi

 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 duusari peedi ke 2G cellular doorsanchaar network ko 1991 main radiolinja dwaara finland main GSM maanak par vanijyik taur par pravartit kiya gaya tha
 Three primary benefits of 2G networks over its predecessors were digital encoding of phone conversations; 2G systems have been significantly more efficient on the spectrum allowing for greater mobile phone impact levels; And starting with SMS text messages, 2G has introduced a data service for mobile
 2G kii shuruuaat ke baad, pichhali mobile telephone pranaaliyon ko purvyaapee taur par 1G naam diya gaya
 While the radio signals on 1G networks are analog and digital on 2G networks, both systems use digital signals to connect radio towers with the rest of the telephone system
 2G praudyogiki ko prayukt bahusanketan ke prakaar ke aadhaar par tdma-aadhaarit or CDMA- aadhaarit maanakon main vibhajit kar sakate hai

 2G se pare, ucch data gati sahit 3G or 3G se bhi aage viksit 4G jaisi praudyogiki maujuud hai
 The use of digital signals between handsets and towers increases the efficiency of the system in two major ways: 2G pranaaliyon kii kamiyaan, jinka aksar acchhee tarah se prachaar nahin kiya jaataa, ve hai: The 2G network was primarily designed for voice services and slow data transmission

 "dhai peedi" shabd kaa upyog aisi 2g-pranaaliyon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jinhone circuit switch domen ke alaava packet switch domen ko bhi karyanvit kiya he
 They do not necessarily provide rapid services, as time-slot bundles are also used for circuit switched data services
 GSM network se 3G main vikaas kaa pehla bada qadam general packet radio seva GPRS ke pravartan ke saath ghatit hua
 CDMA2000 networks likewise evolved through the introduction of 1xrtt
 Hence Cellular services with enhanced data transmission capabilities are called '2 
5G'
 GPRS, 56 kbit / s se 114 kbit / s tak kii data daren uplabdh kara saktaa he
 It can be used for services similar to wireless application protocol access, multimedia messaging service and Internet communication services such as e-mail and worldwide web access
 GPRS data antaran aam taur par antarit trekkic ke prati megabit ke anusaar prabhaarit kiya jaataa he, jabaki paaramparik circuit swimming ke madhyam se data sanchaar kaa bill sangyojan samay ke prati minute ke hisaab se kiya jaataa he, jisamen is baat kaa lihaaj nahin kiya jaataa ki upyogkarta vastav main kshamta kaa upyog kar rahaa he yaa vah niskriy avasthaa main he
 1xrtt supports bi-directional peak data rates up to 153
6 kbps, delivering 80–100 kbps data flow capacity to the average user in commercial networks
 It can be used for WAP, SMS and MMS services as well as Internet access
 8PSK kutalekhan kii shuruuaat ke saath GPRS network EDGE network main viksit hua
 Increased data rates for GSM development, enhanced GPRS, or IMT single carriers are backward-compatible digital mobile phone technologies that allow enhanced data transmission rates, as an extension of standard GSM
 2003 kii shuruuaat se-sanyukt raashtra america main Cingular dwaara GSM network par EDGE ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 EDGE has been standardized by 3GPP as part of the GSM family and is an upgrade that offers a possible three-fold increase in GSM / GPRS network capacity

 "azarbaijan" naam ke udgam ko lekar kai prakaar kii avadharanaayen he
 The most prevalent theorem is that the name derives from the word "atropton"
 atropat farsi akaminoid rajvansh ke samay main ek kshatrap tha, jise sikandar mahaan ne akraman karke parrast kiya or atropaton ko swadhinata mili
 At that time this area was known as Media Atropatia or Atropatin
 is naam kii mul utpatti kii jaden pracheen irani panth, parsi dharm main maani jaati hai
 a document from Avesta mentions "âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide", literally translated in ancient Persian as "we worship the Fravasi of the Holy Attar-pata"
 atropatno ne atropaton kshetra par shashan kiya
 The name "atropatan" itself is a Greek phonetic combination of an ancient-iranian, possibly Meidan, meaning "protected by holy fire"

 jokhim prabandhan kaa arth he jokhim kii pahchaan, moolyankan evam praathmikeekaran ke saath-saath sansadhano kaa samanvit tathaa aarthik prayog kar durbhagyapurna ghatnaon kii sambhavyata athwa prabhaav ko nunatam karnaa, parakhnaa or niyantrit karnaa
 Risks can be caused by uncertainty in financial markets, project failures, statutory liabilities, credit risks, accidents, natural causes and disasters, even deliberate deliberate attacks by opponents
 anek jokhim prabandhan maanak viksit kiye gaye hai jiname pariyojna prabandhan santhaan, rashtriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki santhaan, bimaankik sansthaaen tathaa ISO maanak shaamil hai
 Methods, definitions, and objectives differ widely about whether risk management methodology refers to project management, safety, engineering, industrial processes, financial departments, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety
 jokhim prabandhan kii ranneetiyon main duusare paksh ko jokhim kaa hastantaran, jokhim ko taalna, jokhim main nakaaratmak prabhaav ko kam karnaa or kisi khaas jokhim ke thode bahut yaa sabhi nateezon ko maan lenaa shaamil hai
 Many aspects of risk management standards have been criticized as there has been no measurable improvement despite the increase in confidence in evaluations and decisions
 yah khand jokhim prabandhan ke siddhanton se parichay karaata he
 The terminology of risk management is defined in ISO Guide 73, "risk Management Terminology"
 adarsh jokhim prabandhan main, praathamikta kii prakriya apanaai jaati he jiske tahat sabase badi kshati pahunchane vaali jokhim kii sambhaavna ko sabase pehle niptaya jaataa he or iske baad kam kshati pahunchane vaale sambhavya jokhimon ko avarohi kram main niptaya jaataa he
 In practice this process can be very difficult, and it can often be dealt with incorrectly, keeping a balance between high incident but low damage risks versus large damage risks but a low probability of occurrence
 amoort jokhim prabandhan ek naye prakaar kii jokhim kii pahchaan karata he jisamen ghatana ghatit hone kii 100% sambhaavna hoti he lekin pahchaanane kii aakshamata ke kaaran sanstha dwaara aise jokhim ko nazar andaaj kar diya jaataa he
 For example, when incomplete knowledge is applied in a situation, knowledge risk arises
 sambandh kaa jokhim tabhi saamne ubhar kar aata he jab anupayogi sahyog hota he
 Process appropriation risk becomes a problem when unusable operational processes are used
 ye jokhim nipun kaarigaron kii utpaadakta ko pratyaksh rup se kam kar dete hai, laagat kii prabhavakaarita, laabh, seva, gunvattta, pratishtha, brands mulya or aay kii gunvattta ko bhi kam kar dete hai
 Intangible risk management allows risk management to establish immediate value by identifying and mitigating risks that reduce productivity
 sansadhano ke aavanton main jokhim prabandhan ko kathinaaiyon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 This is an idea of opportunity cost
 jokhim prabandhan main kharch kiye gaye sansadhano ko adhik laabhakaari kaaryakramon main kharch kiya ja saktaa tha
 Again, ideal risk management reduces spending while minimizing the negative impact of risk
 adhikansh bhaag ke liye, in pranaaliyon main nimnlikhit tatv hote hai, jinka lagbhag nimna kram main paalan kiya jaataa he
 The International Institute for Standardization identifies the following principles of risk management
 ISO 31000 maanak "jokhim prabandhan - karyanvayan ke siddhanton or dishanirdesh", ke anusaar jokhim prabandhan kii prakriya main nimnlikhit vibhinn charan hote hai : Establishment of references include: sandarbh kii sthapana ke baad jokhim prabandhan kii prakriya main aglaa kadam sambhavit jokhimon kii pahchaan karnaa he
 Risks are about the hazards that trigger and cause problems
 isliye jokhim kii pahchaan samasya ke strot se shuru kii jaani chahie athwa swatah samasya ke saath hi
 Examples of sources of risk are: stakeholders of a scheme, employees of the company, or the airport
 jab bhi strot yaa samasya main se koi ek gyaat ho, to ghatnaon ko utprerit karne vaale strot athwa samasyaayein paidaa karne vaali ghatnaon kii jaanch-padtaal kii ja sakati he
 For example: financing of the project could be jeopardized by stakeholders withdrawing from the project; Even confidential information can be stolen by employees within closed networks ; Lightning flare and flight during the flight can cause immediate crash of all passengers aboard a Boeing 747
 jokhim pahchaan karne kii chaynit paddati samskruti, udyog abhyaas or anupaalan par nirbhar karti he
 Identification methods are formed by the development of templates or templates to identify a source, problem, or event
 jokhim kii pahchaan kii aam paddatiyaan hai: Once risks are identified, they must be evaluated in relation to potential, potential severity of loss, and likelihood of occurrence
 ye parinaam maapne main yaa to saral ho sakate he, jaise ki ek khoyi hui imaarat ke mulya kii sthiti main athwa apratyaashit ghatana kii sambhaavna kii sthiti main nishchit rup se jaananaa asambhav he
 Therefore, it is risky to make the best possible educated guess to give proper priority to the implementation of a risk management plan in the evaluation process
 jokhim moolyankan main moolbhoot kathinaayee ghatana hone kii dar kaa nirdhaaran karnaa he kyonki ateet kii sabhi prakaar kii ghatnaon ke liye sankhyikeey jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 In addition, in the case of non-physical assets, the severity of the outcome is often difficult to evaluate
 sampatti kaa moolyankan ek doosraa prashn he jis par gaur karnaa jaruri he
 Thus, the best educated views and available statistics are the primary sources of information
 phir bhi, jokhim moolyankan ko sansthaaon ke prabandhan ke liye aisi soochnaaon kii prastuti kerani chahie taaki praathmik jokhimon ko aasaani se samajha jaae or jokhim prabandhan ke faislon ko praathamikta pradaan kii ja sake
 Thus, there are many theories and efforts to quantify risks
 jokhim ke anganit alag-alag formule maujuud hai, lekin jokhim ke pariman ke mapankan ke liye vyapak rup se sweekrut sutara he: The rate of occurrence and the product of the effect of the event is equal to the risk parvarti anusandhan se yah saafe jaahir hota he ki jokhim prabandhan ke aarthik laabh prayukt formule par kam nirbharsheel hote hai kintu ve aavriti or jokhim moolyankan ke tareekon par nirbhar karte he
 In business, it is necessary to be able to present the findings of risk assessment in financial terms
 robert courtney junior ne jokhim ko aarthik sharton main prastut karne kaa formula sujhaayaa
 sanyukt rajya america ke sarkari abhikaranon ke liye courtney formule ko aadhikarik jokhim vishleshan paddati ke rup main sweekrut kiya gaya
 This formula suggests calculating ALE and comparing the estimated damage value to the security control implementation cost
 ek baar jokhimon kii pahchaan or moolyankan kar lene par jokhim ke prabandh kii sabhi takneekein neeche likhe chaar virgon main se kisi ek athwa ekaadhik virgon main aati he: Ideal use of these strategies may not be possible
 inamen se kuch aise vyapaar gat mudde shaamil ho sakate hai jo jokhim prabandhan ke faisle lene vaale pratishthanon yaa vyaktiyon ke liye sweekaarya nahin hai
 The United States Department of Defense, another source of the Defense Acquisition University, nominates these classes as acats to avoid, control, accept, or transfer
 yah parivarni shabd ACAT duusare ACAT kii yaad dilaataa he jiskaa prayog sanyukt rajya america ke raksha udyog kii praptiyon main kiya jaataa he, jisame jokhim prabandhan nirnay-nirdhaaran or yojana nirmaan main pramukh rup se bhaag letaa he
 This includes not performing risky activities
 iskaa ek udhaaharan hoga kisi sampatti yaa vyavsaay nahin khareednaa taaki isaki deyta kii jimmedaari nahin leni pade
 doosraa udhaaharan ho saktaa he hawaii jahaaz ke apharan ho jane ke jokhim se bachane ke liye udaan hi na bharna
 sabhi jokhimon kaa jawaab bachaav main dikhaai detaa he kintu jokhimon se bachaav kaa arth he sambhavit laabh ko kho dena jise jokhim uthaakar paaya ja saktaa tha
 To avoid the risk of loss, it does away with the possibility of making a profit by not entering a business
 khatre kii rokthaam kaa taatpary apatkaal main jokhimon kii rokthaam karnaa he
 The first and most effective phase of hazard prevention is the elimination of hazards
 yadi isamen bahut adhik samay lagata he, isaki laagat bahut adhik hoti he, yaa anyathaa avyaavhaarik hota he, to doosraa charan kami laana he
 This includes methods that reduce the severity of loss or the probability of loss occurring or something like that
 For example, a water spraying machine is designed to extinguish a fire to reduce the risk of fire damage
 yah paddati jal ke nuksaan ke dwaara ek adhik bade nuksaan kaa kaaran ban sakati he or isiilie yah anukool nahin ho sakati he
 The Halon fire extinguishing system may reduce the risk somewhat, but higher costs may be prohibitive to this plan-policy
 aadhunik software vikaas paddhatiyaan vruddhi ke aadhaar par software viksit kar evam use pradaan kar jokhim kam karti hai
 The early methods were influenced by the fact that they provided software only in the final stages of development
 atah aarambhik charnon main saamana kii gai samasyaon kaa taatpary keemtee punarniman tha jisamen aksar puri pariyojna hi jokhim main pad jaati thi
 By developing in iteration, software projects can limit the effort lost in a single iteration
 yadi bahari strot se sevaayen praapt karne vaala vyakti jokhimon kaa prabandhan karne or use kam karne main oonchi dakshata pradarshit kar saktaa he to bahari strot se sevaayen praapt karne kaa kaary jokhim main kami kaa ek udhaaharan ban saktaa he
 In this situation, companies contract only some of their departmental needs to external sources
 udhaaharan ke liye koi company keval apane software vikaas, hardware saamaanon ke utpaadan athwa duusari company ko graahak sahaayta kii aavashyaktaaon ko outsource kar sakati he, jabaki vyavsaay prabandhan ko swany parichaalit karti he
 Thus, the company can focus on business growth by worrying more about the production process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for the call center
 isamen nuksaan hone par ise sweekaar karnaa shaamil hota he
 True self-insurance falls into this category
 jokhim pratidhaaran chote jokhimon ke liye ek vyavhaarya kaaryniti he jahaan jokhim ke viruddh beemaa kii laagat kul nuksaan kii tulana main adhik samay main zyada ho sakati he
 All risks which cannot be avoided or transferred are allowed to remain true by mistake
 isamen ve jokhim shaamil hai jo itane bade yaa vinaashkari hote hai ki unke viruddh beemaa nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki kishton kii adaayagi hi asaadhya ho jaaegi
 iskaa ek udhaaharan yuddh he kyonki adhikansh sampatti or jokhimein yuddh ke viruddh bimaakrit nahin kii jaati he, isliye yuddh se hone vaali haani bimit vyakti ke dwaara pratidhaarit hoti he
 Potential loss of any amount above the sum insured is also a retained risk
 ise bhi maan liya ja saktaa he ki agar kisi badi haani ki sambhaavna kam se kam ho athwa adhik badi beemaa vyapti kii laagat itani badi raashi ko suraksha ke ghere main leti ho to yah sanstha ke lakshyon main adhik baadha daalegi
 In the terminology of both professionals and scholars, the purchase of an insurance contract is often referred to as "transfer of risk"
 haalanki, takneekee taur par, kehane par saadharantaya anubandh kaa kreta hi hastantarit haani ke liye kanoonee rup se jimmedaar hota he, iskaa arth yah hua ki beemaa kii sahi -sahi vyakhya ghatanottar kshatipurak vyavastha ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 For example, an insurance policy for personal injuries does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company
 policy dharak ke paas hi jokhim bana rahata he arthath vah vyakti jo durghatana kaa shikaar hota he
 An insurance policy only provides that if an accident also involves the policy holder then some compensation is payable to the policy holder, which is proportional to the loss / damage
 jokhim prabandhan ke kuch tareeke bahuvidh shreniyon main aate hai
 Risk retention bodies are technically risk holding for one category, but its expansion across the group includes transfers between group members
 paaramparik beemaa se yah alag he jisamen kisi kisht kaa samooh ke sadasyon ke bich vinimay nahin hota he lekin haniyon kaa akalan samooh ke sabhi sadasyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Select or counter appropriate controls to measure each risk
 jokhim ko kam karne ke liye prabandhan ke upyukt str anumodan aavashyak he
 For example, risk related to the image of the organization should be judged by high-level management, while information technology management will have the authority to decide the computer virus risk
 jokhim prabandhan ke liye jokhim prabandhan yojana ko prayojya or prabhavakaari suraksha niyantranon ke prastaav pesh karne chahie
 For example, the risk of a known high-risk computer virus can be reduced by acquiring and implementing anti-virus software
 ek acchhee jokhim prabandhan pariyojna main karyanvayan ke niyantran evam un kaaryon ke liye jimmedaar vyaktiyon ke liye niyat kaarykram hona chahie
 According to ISO / IEC 27001, the stage of completion at the stage immediately following the risk analysis involves the preparation of a risk treatment plan, which should document the decisions regarding how to manage each identified risk needed
 aksar jokhimon main kami se taatpary suraksha niyantranon kaa chunaav karnaa he jise vyaavhaarikta ke vivaran main dastavejit kiya janaa chahie jo yah nirdhaarit karata he ki kis khaas niyantran kaa chunaav uddeshyon ke aadhaar par or kis maanak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he or kyon
 Follow all well-planned methods to minimize the impact of implementation risks
 un jokhimon ke liye beemaa policiyaan khariden jise kisi bimaadharak ko hastantarit karne kaa nirnay liya ja chukaa he, un sabhi jokhimon se bachein jisase company ke lakshyon kaa tyaag kiye bina dusron ko kam kar evam shesh ko barkaraar rakh kar bachaa ja saktaa he
 The initial risk management plan will never be perfect
 abhyaas, anubhav or vaastavik haani ke parinaam yojana main parivartanon ko anivaary bana denge or saamana kiye ja rahe jokhimon se nipatane ke liye kiye jane vaale vibhinn faislon ke liye har sambhav anumati pradaan karenge
 The results of risk analysis and management plans should be updated from time to time
 iske do praathmik kaaran hai: If the risks have been undervalued and prioritized, it can be a waste of time to deal with the risk of unforeseen losses
 asambhavit jokhimon kaa akalan or prabandhan main bahut adhik samay vyayateet karne se adhik laabhprad dhang se prayog kiye ja sakane vaale sansadhano kaa duusare kaamon main upyog ho saktaa he
 Impossible events rarely occur, but if the risk is unlikely, it is better to let the risk remain with you and to deal with the consequences if the loss actually occurs
 The evaluation of qualitative risk is subjective and lacks consistency
 aupchaarik jokhim ke moolyankan kii prakriya kaa praathmik auchity baidh or adhikari tantra pradhan he
 Giving priority to the process of risk management does not allow an institution to complete the project, or even to start
 vishesh rup se yah tab sach hota he jab tak ki jokhim prabandhan kii prakriya purna nahin maani jane tak anya kaary nilambit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also important to keep in mind the difference between risk and uncertainty
 jokhim ko prabhaav or sambhavyata ke gunanfal se mapa ja saktaa he
 Implemented with company finance, risk management is a technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling financial or operational risk in a firm's balance sheet
 mulya ko jokhim main dekhen
 The Basel II design framework divides the risks into market risk, credit risk and operational risk, and also detailed the methodology for calculating capital requirements for each of these components
 jokhim prabandhan ke udhyam main jokhim ko aisi sambhavya ghatana athwa paristhiti ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jiskaa ullikhit udhyam par nakaaratmak prabhaav pad saktaa he
 This can have an impact on the entire existence, resources, products and services or consumers of the enterprise as well as externally on society, market or environment
 kisi vittiya santhaan main udhyam sambandhi jokhim prabandhan ko saamaanya rup se rin sambandhi jokhim, byaaj dar jokhim athwa aasti deyta prabandhan, bazaar sambandhi jokhim or parichaalan sambandhi jokhim kaa samanvay samajha jaataa he
 In the more general case, every potential risk has a pre-conceived hypothesis to deal with its possible outcome
 uparokt soochnaaon or prati karmchaaree samyopari ausat vyay yaa laagat sambhuti anupaat ke aadhaar par ek pariyojna prabandhak anumaan kar saktaa he: Risks in a project or system are either due to a specific cause change or a common cause change and require appropriate treatment
 arthath uparokt suchi main ullikhit asamatuly bahari kaarnon ke prati chintaa ko doharaana
 Project management includes the following risk management activities: jokhim prabandhan kisi sanstha ke prati hone vaali khatre kii ashanka ko kam karne ke liye laagat prabhavi prastaavon ko suvyavasthit dhang se chunane kii keval ek karypranali he
 All risks cannot be completely ignored or minimized only due to economic and practical limitations
 isliye sabhi sansthaaon ko kuch str tak avshisht jokhimon ko sweekaar karnaa padataa he
 While risk management is pre-oriented, business continuity planning was invented to deal with the consequences of perceived residual risks
 BCP ko sahi sthaan main rakhane kii aavashyaktaa utpann hoti he kyonki paryaapt samay dene par asambhavit ghatnaayen bhi ho sakati hai
 Risk management and BCP are often mistakenly seen as rivaling or overlapping practices
 vastav main ye prakriyaayein ek duusare ke saath itani kasakar bandhi hui hoti he ki aisa algaav banaavati lagata he
 For example, the risk management process generates significant investments for BCP
 jokhim prabandhan awalokit jokhimon ke liye prayojya niyantranon kaa prastaav bhi detii he
 Therefore, risk management encompasses many areas that are important to the BCP system
 haalanki, BCP prakriya jokhim prabandhan ke purvakray drushtikon se baahar nikalakar is purvanumaan se aage bad jaati he ki kisi na kisi vindu par durghatana ghategi
 Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field
 jokhim sanchaarkon ke liye yahi ek samasya he ki abhipret shrotaaon / darshakon ke paas kaise pahunchaa jaae taaki jokhim ko anya jokhimon kii tulana main bodhgamy or praasangik banaaya jaae, jokhim se sambandhit darshakon ke mulyon ke prati uchit sammaan kaise diya jaae, sanchaar ke prati darshakon kii pratikriya kaa purvanumaan kaise kiya jaay ityadi
 jokhim sanchaar ke pramukh lakshya he, samuhik or vyaktigat nirnay nirdhaaran main sudhaar
 jokhim sanchaar kuch had tak sankat sanchaar se sambandhit he

 polampalli, jipur mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke adilabadu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The Telugu language is the main language and official language of the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India
 ye dravid bhashaa-parivaar ke antargat aati he
 This language is also spoken in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Chhattisgarh apart from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 telegu ke teen naam prachlit hai -- "telegu", "tenugu" or "andhra"
 The word Andhra is used in the Rigvedic Aitareya Brahmana
 telegu shabd kaa mularoop sanskrit main "triling" he
 It refers to the Shivalinga of Mallikarjuna Linga, Kaleshwar and Draksharama of Srisail in Andhra Pradesh
 in teenon simaaon se ghira desh trillingdesh or yahan kii bhashaa triling kahalaai
 This word is used in the Mahabharata of the Telugu Adi-poet "nannay Bhatt"
 yah shabd trinag shabd se bhi utpann hua mana jaataa he
 It means this region spread in the middle range of three big mountains
 andhra janata uttar disha se dakshin kii ore jab hataai gai to dakshinvasi hone ke kaaran is pradesh or bhashaa ko "tenugu" naam diya gaya
 
 tenugu naam hone kaa ek or kaaran bhi he
 In Tenugu, your word means honey
 yah bhashaa madhumadhur hone ke kaaran tenugu naam se prasiddh he
 This region is also known by the name "veginam"
 "vegi" kaa arth he krishna godavari nadiyon kaa madhyadesh jo ek baar jal gaya tha
 This name is not applicable to the language
 andhra ek jati kaa naam he
 According to the legend of the Rig Veda, due to the curse of sage Vishwamitra, his 50 sons became Andhra, Pulind and Shabar
 adhikansh sanskrit shabdon se sankalit bhashaa "andhra" bhashaa ke naam se vyavahrut hoti he
 The language in which the predominance of Telugu words is known is known as Telugu language
 telegu bhashaa ke vikaas ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke do mat hai
 According to Dr
 Chilukuri Narayana Rao, the Telugu language is not of the Dravidian family but is Prakritjanya and is especially related to the Paisachi language
 iske vipareet bishap cardwell or korad ramakrishnayya aadi vidwaanon ke mat se telegu bhashaa kaa sambandh dravid parivaar se hi he
 Whatever it is, it has developed from the conference of both types of languages
 aajkal uparyukt teen naamon se prachlit is bhashaa main lagbhag 75 pratishat sanskrit shabdon kaa sammishran he
 The root cause of its sweetness is a combination of Sanskrit and Telugu
 pashchim ke vidwaanon ne bhi telegu ko "purv kii italeey bhashaa" kahkar iske maadhurya kii saraahna kii he
 Scripts for almost all sounds are found in this language
 isaki visheshta yah he ki hrasv e, o, dantya c, za evam shakat ref naam se ek adhik "r" ke atirikt ardhabindu or "l" bhi is bhashaa main he
 In this way, six letters are found more in the Telugu alphabet than in the Sanskrit alphabet
 praaia: sanskrit ke mangal, taal or kala aadi shabdon ke "l" varna telegu main "l" se uccharit hote hai
 Ardhanusvara does not exist in pronunciation, but to know the sequence of language, it is necessary to write it
 kuch shabd ek hi prakaar se uccharit hote hue bhi ardhanuswaar ke samavesh se bhinn-bhinn arth dete he
 For example, "edu" means seven numbers
 usee ko ardhanusaar se 'endu' shabd likhaa jaae to iskaa arth varsh arthath sanvatsar hota he
 Telugu Swaraant Yane is the "ajant" language while Hindi is "vyanjnant" or "halant Bhasha"
 swarant bhashaa hone ke kaaran telegu sangeet ke liye atyant upyukt maani gai he
 Thus, 90 percent of the words in Carnatic music are found in Telugu
 telegu lipi motiyon kii maala ke samaan sundar prathit hoti he
 The letters are round
 telegu or kannada lipiyon main bada hi saadrishy he
 The "brahmi script" of the early Christian era was converted into the andhra-carnatic script
 is lipi kaa prachaar "salankayan" raajaaon ke samay sudur deshon main bhi hua
 The Tamils made their own script in the seventh century
 telegu sahitya kaa vibhaajan puranakaal, kavykaal, hraaskaal or aadhunikkaal ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 For detailed information see Telugu literature
 padmavati shabd kaa prayog vibhinn-vibhinn sandarbh main hota he :– Simail Raikwal is a village in Nainital district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Nainital Tehsil

 Hazrat Muhammad - "muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib" was born in 570 AD
 inhone islam dharm kaa pravartan kiya
 They are considered to be the greatest prophet of Islam and the last messenger to whom Allah gave the message of the Quran by the angel Jibril
 musalmaan inke liye param aadar bhav rakhte hai
 Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim was, in short, Muhammad, the last prophet of Islam, and re-founder
 According to Islamic principles, he was a prophet and messenger of Allah, who was sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets
 He is seen as the last Prophet of Allah in all the main branches of Islam
 Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam united the Arab State on the basis of al-quran, Sunnah and Hadiths on political and religious lines
 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets
 He is seen by Muslims as the master of all virtues

264 / MPEG-4 Part 10 or AVC is the standard for video compression and is currently the most commonly used format for recording, compression, and distribution of high definition video
 is maanak ke pehle sanskaran ke antim masauda kaary ko may 2003 main puraa kiya gaya
 H
264 / MPEG-4 AVC is a block-oriented motion-based-based codec standard developed by the ISO / IEC Moving Picture Experts Group with the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group
 yah ek saajhedaari prayaas se utpann utpaada tha jise joint video team ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The ITU-T H

264 ko dicode karne main sakshmata honi chahie
 It is also widely used by streaming internet sources such as videos from Vimeo, youtube and itunes stores, web software such as Adobe Player Flash and Microsoft Silverlight, DVB and SBTVD, direct-broadcast satellite television services, cable television services and real

 The H
264 standard can be seen as a "family of standards", described below as members' profiles

 Standardization of the first version of H
264 / AVC was completed in May 2003
 mul maanak kaa vistaar karne ke liye pratham pariyojna main, us samay JVT ne jo vikaas kiya tha use fidelity range ekstansion kaha gaya tha
 This extension enabled high quality video coding with increased support of sample bits including depth and highest-resolution color information that included a sample-selective structure called y'cbcr 4: 2: 2 and y'cbcr 4 Known as: 4: 4
 kai anya suvidhaayen ko bhi fidlity range ekstansion pariyojna main shaamil kiya gaya tha jaise 4×4 or 8×8 purnank badlaav ke bich anukuli swichan, encoder-nirdisht avadharanatmak-aadhaarit parimanikaran bhaar metrices, dosharahit kushal antar-chitra koden or atirikt rang kaa samarthan
 fidelity range ekstansion par dizin kaa kaam july 2004 main puraa hua tha or un par drafting kaary ko sitambar 2004 main puraa kiya gaya
 Later extensions to the standard include adding five other new profiles primarily for business applications, adding extended-gamut color space support, defining additional aspect ratio indicators, explaining two additional types of "complementary information enhancement" And justifying the former's frext profile as informing industry feedback that a different design should be in place, including Have maanak main judaa ek or pramukh visheshta scalabel video koding tha
 H
264 / avc's Annex g allows the creation of the SVC bitstream specified in it that includes sub-bitstreams and also conforms to the standard, one such bitstream known as the "base layer" Can be decoded by an H
264 / AVC and does not support SVC
 kaalik bitstream maapniyata, yane laghu kaalik ke saath sab-bitstream kii upasthiti bitstream kii tulana main namoona dar, jab sab-bitstream uppann hote hai bitstream se sampoorn acces ikai ko nikaal diya jaataa he
 In this case, high-level syntax and differential predicate reference pictures are built accordingly in bitstreams

 In this case, inter-layer prediction, i
e
, high spatial resolution or prediction of quality signal by data of low spatial resolution or quality signal, is generally used for efficient coding
 scalabel video koding ekstansion ko november 2007 main puraa kiya gaya
 The next major feature added to the standard was multiview video coding
 H
264 / AVC ke eneks ech main vinirdisht, MVC bitstream ke nirmaan ko sakasham banaata he jo ki ek video drishy ke ek se adhik drishy kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 An important example of this functionality is stereoscopic 3D video coding
 MVC kaary main do profile ko viksit kiye gaye hai: multivue hai profile, manamaana sankhya main drishyon ko saport karte hai or sterio hai profile kaa dizin vishisht rup se do-drishy sterioscopy video ke liye kiya gaya he

 Controversy concerning the H
264 video compression standard has arisen mainly from its use within the HTML5 Internet standard
 HTML maanak ke liye HTML 5 do nae tag ko jodatii he; ek web ke liye video or audio saamagree ke ambed ke liye or 
 HTML 5 was developed by the working group of HTML 5 as a free standard adopted by developers of all web browsers

 a profile for a codec is a set of attributes of the codec that must meet the set of specifications for the target application
 iskaa matlab yah he ki soochibaddh suvidhaon main se kai, kuch profile main samarthit nahin hote hai
 Various profiles of H
264 / AVC are discussed in the next section
 yah maanak, 17 set kshamtaaon ko nirdisht karata he jisamen anuprayogon ke vishisht virgon ko lakshith kiya jaataa he, ise profile ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 The following profiles are included for non-measurement 2D video applications: 2 : 2 profile : mukhya rup se vyavsaayik anuprayogon ko lakshith karte hai jiskaa istemaal video antervayan ke liye kiya jaataa he, hai 10 profile ke sheersh par is profile banaata he, 4:2:2 chroma sabsampoling praaroop ke liye saport ko jodta he jabaki dicode tasviir parishuddhta ke prati namoonay ke liye 10 bit tak kaa prayog karata he
 4: 4 Prediction Profile: This profile is built on top of a high 4: 2: 2, supports up to 4: 4: 4 chroma sampling, uses up to 14 bits per sample, and additional efficient lossless area Supports coding and coding each image as three different color planes
 camcorder, sampadan or peshewar anuprayogon ke liye, maanak main chaar atirikt ol-intra profile shaamil he, jise anya samarupi profile ke saadhaaran subset ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 These are mostly for professional applications: 2 : 2 intra profile: ol-intra istemaal ke liye hai 4:2:2 profile vivash he
 4: 4 Intra Profile: a 4: 4: 4 profile is constrained for all-intra use
 4 : 4 intra profile: ol-intra prayog or CAVLC antropy koden ke liye hai 4:4:4 profile vivash
 As a result of the scalable video coding extension, the standard includes three additional scalable profiles, which are defined as the base layer and the H
264 / AVC profile for the device receiving the scalable expansion
 multivue video koden vistaar ke parinamswaroop, maanak main do multivue profile shaamil hai: As in the standard, the term "level" is used, which is a set of detailed descriptions and denotes the degree of decoder performance required for a profile
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek profil ke bheetar saport kaa str adhiktam sankalp chitra, frem dar or bit dar jo ki ek dicoder istemaal karne main sakasham ho saktaa he, ko nirdisht karegaa
 a decoder that accepts the received level requires that all bitstreams be able to decode less encodes for that level and for all levels to conform to a given level

 The Gautam Dharmasutra is the oldest among the Dharmasutras available so far
 yadhyapi sabhi dharmasutra granth bina kisi shakhabhed ke sampurna aryajan ko saamaanya rup se maanya hai, tathaapi kumaril ke anusaar gautam dharmasutra or gobhil grihyasutra chandog adhyetaon ke dwaara vishesh rup se parigrihit hai
 The internal evidence of Gautama Dharmasutra confirms the opinion of Kumaril
 is granth kaa sampurna 26waan adhyay samaveda ke brahman samavidhan se gruhit he
 The Samvediya Gobhilagrihyasutra contains quotations from the evidence of Gautama
 parampara ke anusaar samaveda kii shakha ranyneey kaa ek sutaracharan gautam tha or sambhavat: isi sutaracharan main gautamadharmasutra kii rachana hui
 It is not too far-fetched to imagine that apart from the Dharmasutra, Gautamsutracharan's house and srouthastra were no longer available
 samayaacharik athwa smart dharm kaa vivechan karanevaale is dharmasutra main 28 adhyay hai, jinamein varna, ashram or nimitt dharmon kaa vistrut tathaa gundharm kaa apekshtya sankshipt vidhaan he
 Dharmapramana, Evidence of Evidence, Upanayana, Poop, Brahmachari, Law of Monks and Baikhanas Ashrams, Rites and Duties related to Grihastashram, Duties of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, Rajdharma, Punishment, Poop, Feminine, Atonement, Obligation and sonship Is a type of interpretation
 is dharmasutra kaa uplabdh rup anek prakshepon se yukt he
 For example, in the 19th chapter, the fraction of Karmavipak is added later
 isapar na to muscari kaa bhashya or na hardutt kii vyakhya he
 The sixth sutra of chapter 6 also appears to be a subsequent projection on the words of Gautam Dharmasutra quoted by Baudhayana and the internal evidence of the Dharmasutra presented
 isamen anya dharmasutron ke samaan bich bich main footkar padya nahin hai
 The entire Gautam Dharmasutra is in prose, though some sutras are written in Vattagandhishali and seem to be part of the Anushtupa, its language being more adherent to Paninian grammar than other Dharmasutras, but this rite also appears to be later
 kyonki is dharmasutra main samavidhan brahman kaa ek ansh gruhit he or vasishtha or boudhayan dharmasutron main is dharmasutra ke maton kaa nampurvak ullekh he, at: isaki rachana samavidhan brahman ke baad or vasishtha or boudhayandharmasutron ke purv hui hogi
 On the basis of this fact and the criticism of Varnashrama Dharma made by Buddhism and the absence of its supplication, the creation period of this Dharmasutra is considered to be 600-400 AD
 isapar hardutt kii "mitakshra" vyakhya or muscari kaa "bhashya" he
 The sage Rishi Gautama is considered a sage Gautama
 gautam naam kaa ullekh pracheen shastron main anekatra paaya jaataa he
