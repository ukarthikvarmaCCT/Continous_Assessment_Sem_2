 satyavati mahabharat kii ek mahatvapurn paatr he
 He was married to Hastinapur Naresh Shantanu
 uskaa mul naam 'matsaygandha' tha
 She was a damsel born by the aperture Vasu from the womb of Apsara named "adrika", who got Matsibhava from the curse of Brahma
 iskaa hi naam baad main satyavati hua
 After tearing the belly of the fish, the seafarers pulled out a boy and a girl and reported to the king
 balak ko to raja ne putr rup se sweekaar kar liya kintu balika ke sharir se matsay kii gandh aane ke kaaran raja ne mallaah ko de diya
 She used to ride a boat in Yamuna to serve her father
 sahatrarjun dwaara parashar muni ko mrit maan kar mritpraayah chhod diya gaya
 Mata Satyavati served Muniraj and donated her life
 maharishi ne prasann hokar unka matsaybhav nasht kiya tathaa sharir se uttam gandh nikalne kaa vardaan diya at: vah 'gandhvati' naam se bhi prasiddh hui
 His name was also 'yojnagandha'
 usase maharishi vedavyas kaa janm hua
 He was later married to King Shantanu
 pracheen kaal main sudhanva naam ke ek raja the
 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 main kumari hoon
 What would my father say "parashar Muni said," Balike! Do not worry prasuti hone par bhi tum kumari hi rahogi
 "parashar demanded again, and Satyavati said" the fish smells bad from my body "
 tab use aashirwad dete huye kaha," tumhaare sharir se jo machhlee kii gandh nikalati he vah sugandh main parivartit ho jaayegi
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya taaki koi or unhen us haal main na dekhe
 Thus a love affair was established between Parashar and Satyavati
 samay aane par satyavati garbh se veda vedangon main paarangat ek putr hua
 At birth, the child grew up and said to his mother, "mother! Whenever you remember me in adversity, i will be present
" " itnaa kah kar ve tapasya karne ke liye dwaipayan dweep chale gayi
 Due to doing penance in Dwaipayan island and his body color being black, he came to be called Krishna Dwaipayan
 aage chal kar vedon kaa bhashya karne ke kaaran ve vedavyas ke naam se vikhyath huye
 Once Maharat Pratipa of Hastinapur was doing penance on the banks of the Ganges
 unke rup-soundarya se mohit ho kar devi ganga unki dahini jaangh par aakar baith gayi
 Maharaja was surprised to see this, then Ganga said, "O Rajan! i am the daughter of sage Jahnu Ganga * and have come to you with the desire to marry you
 " is par maharaj prateep bole, "gange! tum meri dahini jaangh par baithi ho
 The wife should be vamangi, right thigh is the symbol of the son, so i accept you as my daughter-in-law
 " yah sun kar ganga vahaan se chali gayi
 Now Maharaja Pratip started doing intense penance to get a son
 unke tap ke falswaroop unhen putr kii prapti hui jiskaa naam unhone shantanu rakhaa
 When Shantanu was young, Maharaja Pratipa went to heaven, ordering him to marry Ganga
 pita ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ke liye shantanu ne ganga ke paas jaakar unase vivaah karne ke liye nivedan kiya
 Ganga said, "rajan! i can marry you, but you have to promise that you will not interfere in any of my work
" " shantanu ne ganga ke kahe anusaar vachan de kar unase vivaah kar liya
 Maharaj Shantanu had eight sons from the Ganga's womb, out of which seven were taken away by Ganga into the Ganges river and due to his promise, Maharaj Shantanu could not speak anything
 jab ganga kaa aathvaan putr hua or vah use bhi nadi main bahaane ke liye le jane lagi to raja shantanu se rahaa na gaya or ve bole, "gange! tumne mere saat putron ko nadi main baha diya kintu apni pratigya ke anusaar maine kuch na kaha
 Now you are going to shed this eighth son of mine too
 main tumse prarthana karata hoon ki krupa karke ise nadi main mat bahaao
 On hearing this, Ganga said, "rajan! You have broken your vow so i can no longer be with you
 " itnaa kah kar ganga apane putr ke saath antardhyaan ho gayi
 After that Maharaj Shantanu spent thirty-six years wearing a Brahmacharya fast
 phir ek din unhone ganga ke kinare ja kar ganga se kaha, "gange! aaj meri ichha us balak ko dekhne kii ho rahi he jise tum apane saath le gai thim
 "ganga appeared as a beautiful woman with that child and said," Rajan! This is your son and its name is Devavrata, take it
 yah parakramee hone ke saath vidwaan bhi hoga
 In astrology it will be similar to Parashurama
 " maharaj shantanu apane putr devvrat ko paakar atyant prasann huye or use apane saath hastinapur laakar yuvaraj ghoshit kar diya
 One day Maharaj Shantanu was roaming on the banks of Yamuna that he saw a beautiful girl riding a boat in the river
 uske ang ang se sugandh nikal rahi thi
 Maharaj asked the girl, "oh God! Who are you?" The girl told, "maharaj! My name is Satyavati and i am a Nishad girl
 " maharaj uske rup yauvan par riz kar tatkaal uske pita ke paas pahunche or satyavati ke saath apane vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 On this Dhinwar said, "rajan! i have no objection to my daughter marrying you, but you must make the son born of my daughter's womb the heir to your kingdom
" 
 "on hearing these words of Nishad, Maharaj Shantanu returned quietly to Hastinapur
 satyavati ke viyog main maharaj shantanu vyakul rahane lage
 His body became weaker day by day
 maharaj kii is dasha ko dekh kar devvrat ko badi chintaa hui
 When he came to know the reason of this type of father's condition by the ministers, he immediately went to Nishad's house with all the ministers and he said to Nishad, "O Nishad! You are happily married your daughter Satyavati to my father Shantanu
 Please do it
 main aapako vachan detaa hoon ki aapaki putree ke garbh se jo balak janm legaa vahi rajya kaa uttaradhikari hoga
 In the long run, if any of my children do not take away the rights of your daughter's children, i pledge that i will remain unmarried for a lifetime
 " unki is pratigya ko sun kar nishad ne haath jod kar kaha, "he devvrat! aapaki yah pratigya abhootpurv he
 "having said this, Nishad immediately sent his daughter Satyavati along with Devavrata and his ministers to Hastinapur
 devvrat ne apni mata satyavati ko laakar apane pita shantanu ko saunp diya
 The father was pleased and said to the son, "watts! You have pledged paternity, such a promise that no one has done till date and will not do in future
" main tuje vardaan detaa hoon ki teri mrityu teri ichha se hi hogi
 Because of your vows, you will be called Bhishma and your pledge will always be known as Bhishma pledge
 " Satyavati had two sons named Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 shantanu kaa swargvaas chitrangad or vichitraveery ke balykaal main hi ho gaya tha isaliye unka paalan poshan bhishma ne kiya
 Bhishma installed Chitrangad on the throne as he grew up, but in a short period, Chitrangad was killed while fighting with Gandharvas
 is par bhishma ne unke anuj vichitraveery ko rajya saunp diya
 Now Bhishma was worried about the marriage of Vichitravirya
 unheen dinon kashiraj kii teen kanyaon, amba, ambika or ambalika kaa swayamvar hone vaala tha
 Going to his swayamvara, Bhishma alone defeated all the kings who came there and after killing all the three girls brought them to Hastinapur
 badi kanya amba ne bhishma ko bataaya ki vah apana tan-man raaj shalve ko arpit kar chuki he
 On hearing this, Bhishma sent him to King Shalva and got Ambika and Ambalika married to Vichitravirya
 raja shalve ne amba ko grahan nahin kiya atah vah hastinapur laut kar aa gai or bhishma se boli, "he arya! aap mujhe har kar laaye hai atev aap mujhase vivaah karen
 "but Bhishma did not accept his request because of his promise
 amba rusht ho kar parashuram ke paas gai or unase apni vyathaa suna kar sahaayta maangi
 Parshuram said to Amba, "oh God! Don't worry, i will get you married with Bhishma
 " parashuram ne bhishma ko bulaava bheja kintu bhishma unke paas nahin gayi
 Angry at this, Parashurama reached Bhishma and a terrible war broke out between the two heroes
 donon hi abhootpurv yoddha the isaliye haar-jeet kaa faisla nahin ho sakaa
 After all, the Gods intervened and ended this war
 amba niraash ho kar van main tapasya karne chali gai
 Vichitravirya indulged in indulgence with both her queens, but she had no children with both queens and died of tuberculosis
 ab kul naash hone ke bhay se mata satyavati ne ek din bhishma se kaha, "putr! is vansh ko nasht hone se bachaane ke liye meri ajna he ki tum in donon raniyon se putr utpann karo
 "hearing Mata, Bhishma said," Mother! i cannot break my vows under any circumstances
 " Mother Satyavati felt very sad to hear this
 achaanak unhen apane putr vedavyas kaa samaran ho aayaa
 As soon as he remembered, Ved Vyas appeared there
 satyavati unhen dekh kar boleen, "he putr! tumhaare sabhi bhai nihsantaan hi swargavaasi ho gayi
 Therefore, to save my descendants from perishing, i command you to produce children from their wives
 " vedavyas unki ajna maan kar bole, "mata! aap un donon raniyon se kah dijiye ki ve ek varsh tak niyam vrath kaa paalan karte rahen tabhi unako garbh dhaaran hoga
 "after a year had passed, Ved Vyasa first went to the great queen Ambika
 ambika ne unke tej se dar kar apane netra band kar liye
 Returning to Ved Vyas, he said to Mata, "mata Ambika will have a great son, but he will be blind due to the defect of closing the eyes
 " satyavati ko yah sun kar atyant dukh hua or unhone vedavyas ko choti rani ambalika ke paas bheja
 Ambalika was pale in fear upon seeing Ved Vyasa
 uske kaksh se lautne par vedavyas ne satyavati se kaha, "mata! ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit putr hoga
 "this made Mata Satyavati even more sad and she ordered the elder queen Ambalika to go to Ved Vyasa again
 is baar badi rani ne swayan na ja kar apni daasi ko vedavyas ke paas bhej diya
 This time Ved Vyas came to Mother Satyavati and said, "mother! This maid's womb will produce a very strategic son who is well versed in veda-vedanta
" " itnaa kah kar vedavyas tapasya karne chale gayi
 When the time came, Dhritarashtra, born from Ambika's womb, Pandu suffering from Pandu disease from the womb of Ambalika, and Dharmatma Vidur from Maa's womb were born
 sukhsagar ke saujany se C: Dhritarashtra and Pandu were born to Vyasa after the demise of Vichitravirya

 shikaar vyakti sandook ko, yaa kisi bhi note ko saath nahin le ja saktaa he, kyonki use yah suchit kiya ja chukaa he ki karon kaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya he, lekin ek baar note jab dhul jaaenge, to karon kaa bhugtan kiya janaa aasaan ho jayega or phir bhi lakhon bache rah jaaenge

 Scammers will keep on hunting until they are convinced that there is no more money and they can no longer borrow from anyone or borrow from friends or banks, or until the victim realizes that The scam is happening and the police may be involved
 yah kahana anaavashyak he ki jabatak police shaamil hoti he tabatak jaalsaaj khud or peedit vyakti ke paise aamtaur par gaayab ho gaye hote hai
 Most such frauds are not reported by the victims for several reasons

 iske uparaant sumerian rajya ne bahu maanakeey plathora ko kuch maanakon tak sahmati di
 All written values are in sections of an absolute unit standard
 The Greek root of stadios means to stand or have standing, to establish a standard
 In Mesopotamia the problem was that there were several different standards so in the time of Gudea an agreement was circulated between the various city states much like that which is presently being negotiated in Europe
 The weights and measures of Mesopotamia gradually developed with the associated city states
 The Sumerian number system uses a base 60 positional notation, and is the origin for the division of 60 for hours and angular degrees
 The Akkadian system adopts the Sumerian
 Over a period of several millennia international trade and commerce spread the idea of standards of measure based on definitions of land and property throughout the ancient near east
 International trade required the expansion of the arrangement throughout the ancient Near East as a common standard much like our metric system
 The basis of the standard was a definition of a geographic degree divided into 600 parts know as stadia which were further divided into 600 feet

 Surma Bhopali, a minor character in the film, was based on a jungle officer named Surma of Bhopal, who was familiar to actor Jagdeep

 The makers of Sholay had initially chosen Danny Denzongpa for the role of Gabbar Singh, but they were not ready for the role, as he had already agreed to work in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma, whose filming time also included Sholay's

 Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but salim-javed felt that "the audience was sympathetic to him because of his earlier roles; Gabbar had to be completely disgusted
" " Sippy wanted Jai to play Shatrughan Sinha, but many other big stars were working in the film, and so Sinha refused
 amitabh bachchan us samay itane prasiddh nahin hue the; unhen is kirdaar ko paane ke liye kathor parishram karnaa padaa tha
 salim-javed, however, recommended Bachchan's name for Sholay in 1973; Because salim-javed was convinced that Bachchan was the right actor for this film after seeing his acting in the film Zanjeer
 kyonki film ke kai sadasyon ne kathanak pehle hi pard liya tha, kai abhinayta alag alag kirdaar nibhaane hetu icchhuk the
 Pran was first cast for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy found Sanjeev Kumar better for the role

 Dharmendra was also interested in Thakur's character, but when he was told by Sippy that if he became Thakur, Sanjeev Kumar would be given the role of Veeru and then he would team up with Hema Malini

 Most parts of Sholay were shot in the rocky areas of Ramnagar, a small town near Bangalore city in Karnataka
 film ke seton tak suvidhajanak pahunch sunishchit ke liye nirmaataaon ko bangalore rajmarg se ramnagar tak ek sadak banani padi thi
 An entire artificial city was built near the site by art director Ram Yedkar

 Later, a part of Ramnagar was also renamed "sippy Nagar" in honor of the film's director
 2010 tak, "sholay chattaanon" kii ek yatra bhi ramnagar aane vaale paryatakon ke liye uplabdh thi
 Filming began on 3 October 1973, filming a scene of Bachchan and Bhaduri
 film kaa nirmaan apane samay ke liye bhavy tha; aksar kalakaaron ke liye partiyon or bhojon kaa aayojan hota rahata tha, or is kaaran iskaa bajet to badha hi, saathi hi ise puraa karne main dhai saal lag gaye
 One of the reasons for its high cost was that Sippy re-shot the scenes he had shot several times to get his desired effect
 geet "ye dosti" ke 5 minute ke geet anukram ko shoot karne main 21 din lag gaye, do chote drishy jisamen radha deepak jalaati he, prakaash kii samasyaon ke kaaran 20 dinon main filmaae ja sake, or ek drishy, jisamen gabbar imam ke bete kii hatya karata he, 19 dinon main jaakar shoot ho paaya
 The theft scene in the train, which was filmed near Panvel on the mumbai-pune railroad, was completed in more than 7 weeks
 sholay steriophonic soundtrack rakhane or 70 mimi widescreen praaroop kaa upyog karne vaali pehali bhartiya film thim
 However, real 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, so the film was first shot on traditional 35mm film, and the 4: 3 images made from it were later converted to 2
2: 1 frames
 is prakriya ke bare main sippi ne kaha, "ek 70 mimi praaroop badi screen kaa vaastavik anand detaa he or tasviir ko or bhi bada banane ke liye iskaa or adhik aavardhan karata he, lekin chunki main dhwani kaa bhi baraabar prasar chahta tha, to hamane 'chah trek-steriophonic' dhwani kaa prayog kiya or phir ise badi screen ke saath sanyukt kiya
 This was definitely a differentiator
 " film ke postaron dwaara bhi iske 70 mimi kii film ke upyog par jor diya gaya, jin par film kaa naam cinemascope ke logo se mail khaataa hua sa shailibaddh kiya gaya tha
 The film's posters also served to distinguish Sholay from other films older than this; One of them even added the English tagline: "the Greatest Starcast Ever Assembled - The Greatest Story Ever Told" vastav main jo film us samay filmaayi gayi thi, uskaa ant bahut alag tha
 Thakur kills Gabbar in the original story, and apart from this there were many such scenes, which were different in the original story
 gabbar kii mrityu kaa drishy, or iske saath saath gabbar dwaara imam ke bete kii hatya or thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar vaale sabhi drishyon ko bhartiya sensor board ne hataa diya tha
 The Censor Board was concerned that people should not be affected by such violent scenes and people would not be killed in the same way to take revenge on other people irrespective of the law
 haalanki sippi ne is drishy ko film kaa hissaa banaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi ladaai ladi, par baad main is drishy ko sensor board ke nirdeshaanusaar phir se shoot kiya gaya, jisamen thakur ke gabbar ko maarane se kuch hi samay pehle police aa jaati he
 For 15 years before it was screened in theaters, people got to see the film directed by the censor board
 1990 main iskaa bina sensor kiya hua british sanskaran vieches main pradarshit hua
 Eros Entertainment then released two separate DVD versions of it; The first was an uncensored 204-minute original film, and the second was a 198-minute film approved by the censor board

 Kaushik Banerjee, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, noted that Sholay demonstrated a "sympathetic construction of fake virility" through the examples of Jai and Viru
 banerjee ne yah bhi tark diya ki film ke dauraan vaidhata or aapraadhikta ke bich kii naitik seemaa dhire-dhire khatm ho jaati he
 Film scholar Vimal Dissanayake agrees that the film served to bring "a new stage in the dialectic developed between violence and social order" in Indian cinema
 film vidwaan em
 madhav prasad ke anusaar jai or viru ek haashie vaali aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jo paramparaagat samaaj main pesh kii jaati he
 Prasad also said that, through the elements of revenge, while highlighting the criminality of Jai and Veeru, the way they were embedded in the story, it reflected reactionary politics, forcing the audience to accept the feudal order

 The villain of the film, Gabbar Singh, received good reactions from the audience despite his widespread sadistic cruelty
 disanayake bataate hai ki darshakon ko charitra ke samvaad or vyavhaar se mohit kiya gaya tha, or inhen tatwon ne gabbar ke karnaamon par pardaa daalane kaa bhi kaam kiya, jo ki kisi bhartiya drama film main pehali baar hua tha
 He noted that the portrayal of violence in the film was seductive but unbearable
 unhone aage kaha ki, "puraani drama filmon ke vipareet, jinamein maadaa sharir darshakon ke dhyaan ko apni ore aakarshith rakhata tha, sholay main ek nar centrebindu par he; yah ek yuddh ke maidan sa he jahaan achchhai or buraai ke bich sarvocchata ke liye pratispardhaa chalati he
 Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be seen as an icon of the national framework: it lacks a cozy logical narrative, it repeatedly challenges social stability, and at the same time lacks emotion in human Depreciation of life is also shown
 ek saath rakhane par, ye sabhi tatv bharat kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Sholay's narrative style, its violence, and the actions of revenge and vigilance are sometimes compared by scholars to political unrest in India at the time of its release
 yah tanaav 1975 main pradhan mantri indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal main samaapt hua
 Dissanayake and Sahay also noted the fact that, although many elements in the film were derived from Hollywood's Western style films, especially its scenes, the film was still successfully "indianized"
 udhaaharan ke taur par, wiliam vine der hide ne sholay main ek narsanhaar drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west ke ek drishy se kii thi
 Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasized the values and melodramatic tradition of Indian families, whereas Western films were more materialistic and restrained in outlook
 inacychlopedia of hindi cinema main maithili raav ne note kiya ki sholay western style ko "saamantivaadi vichaar" main dhaal detii he
 Ted Shane of the Chicago Reader noted Sholay's "historical Visual Style" and the intermittent "populist Message"

 Sardar noted that the film had two major Muslim characters; Surma Bhopali, and another a helpless victim of dacoits; Additionally, the only function of a female character is to face fate by remaining silent, while the other female character is nothing but a beautiful rural woman
 kuch vidwaanon ne sanket diya he ki sholay main samalangik gaiyr prem prasangayukt vishay bhi hai
 Ted Shane describes the relationship shown between Jay and Veeru in the film as compared to the camp genre
 apni pustak bollywood and globalaligeshan: indian popular cinema, nesan and diaspora main dina holtzman kaa kahana he ki jai kii mrityu ne donon purush paatro ke bich ke sambandhon ko todane kaa kaam kiya taaki ek maanak sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake

 sholay film 15 agast 1975 ko bharat ke swatantrata diwas ke maukey par mumbai main release hui
 Due to negative reviews and lack of effective publicity, the film did not do much for the first two weeks of its debut, although its viewership began to grow from the third week onwards due to positive oral hype

 The ultimate goal of cognitive therapy is to modify the distorted thoughts or misconceptions associated with fear; According to this treatment, through the modification of these ideas, fear will be reduced and situations like these can be avoided
 For example, cognitive therapy will try to convince the patient that lifts are not dangerous, but it is very useful because it will help you get to where you need to go faster
 a study conducted by SJ Rakhaman, an acclaimed expert in this field, shows that cognitive remediation reduces fear and negative thoughts / meaning, is vidhi main rogiyon ko jis bhay kaa ve anubhav karte hai us bhay ke prati purna rup se udghaatit kiya jaataa he

 Since this study only applies to those who completed their MRI, those who were unable to complete the MRI were not included in this study
 yah sambhaavna he ki sanvrutibhiti ke gambhir rogi hone ke chalate kai logon ko isse baahar kar diya gaya
 Therefore, the lack of people who suffered from severe hyperactivity could skew these figures
 austin ke texas vishvavidhyalay ke kuch chaatro ko praarambhik nidaan diya gaya or unke sanvrutibhiti kii sambhaavna ke aadhaar par 1 se 5 ke bich ank die gaye
 Those who scored 3 or higher were used in the study
 chaatro se phir poocha gaya ki ve kitna behatar mahasoos karte hai yadi unhen ek vistaarit avadhi ke liye ek chote se kaksh main rahane ke liye majaboor kiya jaae
 sanvrutibhiti ke kaarnon main se do mukhya kaarnon ke bich matbhed karne ke liye ghutan or parirodh se sambandhit kaarnon ko alag karte hue prashn puche gaye
 The results of this study suggest that most of the students had more fear of suffocation than fear of suffocation
