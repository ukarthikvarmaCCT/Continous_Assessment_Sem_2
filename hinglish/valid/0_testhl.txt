 The study of parasites is called parasitology

 As a subject of biology, the expansion of parasitology does not depend on the animal or its environment, but on their way of life
 atev yah anya vishyon ke, sangyojan se bana he; va kai up-vishyon kii takneekon par aadhaarit he, jaise koshika jaiviki, soochna-jaiviki, jaivaraciniki anvik jaiviki, immunology, anuvaanshiki, vikaswad evam paristhitiki
 The way of life is common on earth

 The prominent saint poet among the followers of Rama was Tulsidas
 ve atyant vidwaan the or unhone bhartiya darshan tathaa sahitya kaa gaharaa adhyayan kiya

 Vallabhacharya also did the work of spreading Krishna devotion
 jagatprasiddh surdaas bhi is sampradaay kii prasiddhi ke mukhya kaaran kahe ja sakate hai
 Surdas took initiation from Vallabhacharya Ji and presented Krishna's lovelings and child sports in the color of devotion
 maadhuryabhav kii in lilaon ne janata ko bahut rasmagn kiya
 In this way two main sects were present in their time under full devotion, Ram Bhakti Branch; Krishnabhakti Branch
 iske atirikt bhi do shakhaayen prachlit huin - premumarg tathaa nirgunmarg shakha
 Parallel to this development sequence of Sagun Dhara, Muslim Sufi saints who came from outside were also spreading their ideas to the general public
 musalamaanon ke is lambe pravaas ke kaaran bhartiya tathaa muslim samskruti kaa aadan-pradaan hona swaabhaavik tha
 Then these Sufi saints also made a successful attempt to spread their ideas to the masses, to present their opinions in Indian lectures, in the Indian environment, right here
 inke maton main kattarta kaa kahin bhi abhas nahin tha
 His main principle was the element of love
 yadhyapi prem ke madhyam se ishwar ko paane ke liye kiye jane vaale prayaas main kuch antar avashya tha tathaapi inke prem tatva ke pratipaadan evam prasar style ne logon ko aakarshith kiya
 He also propounded monotheism, which some believe to be monotheism, which is not fair

 In this Sufism also four streams mainly ran - jaaysi, qutuban, manzan aadi prasiddh kaviyon ne hindi sahitya ko amuly sahitya ratna bhent kiye
 They also had an impact on the Nirgungyanashrayi Shakti branch and things were said to erase the distinction between Hindu and Muslims
 acharya shukla ne bhi inhen ’hindu or musalmaan hriday ko aamane saamne karke ajanabeepan mitaane vaala' kaha
 Ramanand ji brought Ram bhakti to North India
 unke siddhanton main is bhakthi kaa swaroop do prakaar kaa tha - ram kaa nirgun rup; ram kaa avtari rup
 Both these views were together
 nirgun rup main ram kaa naam to hota par use ’dasharath-sut’ kii katha se sambaddh nahin kiya jaataa
 Ramanand saw that after coming to the shelter of God, there is no bonding of untouchability, caste and caste etc
 Therefore, even after being blessed by Sanskrit pundits and high Brahmin clans, he wrote poetry in the country language and gave everyone the name Ram
 Preached kabir inhen ke shishy the
 Kabir, Raidas, Dhanna, Sena, Pippa etc
 his disciples made this idea famous
 ramanaam ke mantra ko lekar chalane vaale akkhad-fakkad santon ne bhed-bhav bhula kar sabko prempurvak gale lagane kii baat kahi
 Emphasizing the renunciation of obsolescence and external laws by the Vedic rituals, spread the love of Rama name, simple method of remembering with reverence and easy samadhi
 kabir main teen pramukh dharaayen samahit dikhaai detii hai - Hatha Yoga definitely has some effect on them, but the emphasis is mainly on the element of love
 saamaajik sudhaar ke kshetra main in santon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa he
 In the literature of these saints, we get a glimpse of all the social, religious and political situations of the era
 dharmik drushti se bhi inkaa yoga bahut he
 Due to the emphasis on the language of easy love, people also had a lot of inclination on them
 kabir kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad isamen bhi sampradaay kii sthapana ho gai
 Like other branches, its importance is also in making the devotee complete
 ye chaaron shakhaayen bhaktikaal yaa madhyakaal ke purv bhaag main apane utkarsh main thim
 All these four branches gave big personality to Hindi literature such as Sur, Tulsi, Kabir etc
 apane bhakthibhaav kii charam utkrushtataa ke liye bhi ye janata ke man-maanas par aadhipaty kar sake
 Even today they are seen with reverence and respect
 yadhyapi kaalaantar main in sampradaayon main bhi aniatikta ke tattvon ke pravesh ke kaaran shuddhta nahin rah gai thi tathaa inkaa patan bhi dhire-dhire ho gaya tha tathaapi jo adbhut maniyan is kaal main praapt huin, ve kisi bhi anya kaal main praapt nahin ho sakin, yah nihsandeh kaha ja saktaa he
 Art flourished in every way in the Bhaktikaal, a new environment was born, sources of devotion, love and reverence burst out among the masses, such a period is truly worthy of being called the "golden period" of literary history
 sampradaayon se mukt rup main bhi bhakthi kaa prachaar tha
 The names of Meera, Rasakhan, Rahim are taken with as much reverence as any of the saintly poets
 is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki janata main sampradaay se bhi adhik shuddh bhakthi-bhav kii mahatta thi
 Ecumenical devotion took a collective form and engulfed the hearts of every person
 tulsi kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad hi reetikaal ke aagaman ke chihn dikhaai dene lage the
 The decadent form of Rama was normalized to include the temporal pastimes
 krishna kii prem bhakthi jaagrit karne vaali lilaon main se krishna kii shringaarik lilaon ko grahan karke uskaa ashleel chithran hone laga tha
 This situation had reached its abysmal form in Retikal
 isiilie kaha gaya tha "radhika kanhai sumarin ko bahaano he
 "the form of Rambhakti which Tulsi inscribed, though it did not tarnish, was forgotten by the poets living in the shelter of the kings in an atmosphere of adornment
 is tarah dhire-dhire i
1680-90 ke aasapaas bhaktikaal samaapt ho gaya
 Over the years, even though devotion remained in the public, neither it was able to generate great fame and neither a very popular book could be written
 bhakthi yug kaa yah aandolan bahut bada aandolan tha evam aisa aandolan bharat ne isse pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 This literature awakened reverence, devotion, faith, livelihood in the heart of the public, imparted courage, gaiety, love, presented a huge and encouraging picture of its motherland, its culture, patriotism was also awakened in the heart of the people for the same reason
 Happened
 bhakthiyug main is tarah mukhyat: bhaktiparak sahitya kii rachana hui parantu yah bhi purnataya nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kisi anya prakaar kaa sahitya us kaal main tha hi nahin
 This was the reign of Akbar and there were many poets in his court
 abdurrahim khaankhaana aadi kii rajprasastiparak kuch kavitaayen milti hai
 Akbar also encouraged the traditional stream of literature, so that form of poetry is also available in Kriparam's "hitarangini" Birbal's retail couplets etc
 iske atirikt niti parak dohe aadi likhe gayi
 Another great poet Acharya Keshav has been placed by Shukla ji in the retail poets of Bhaktikal
 yah kaary unhone keshav ke rachanakaal ke aadhaar par kiya he
 Shukla Ji has placed him among the great poets of this era, considering Keshav's ornamentation, verses, signs of rasa - three important compositions which represent examples - Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika, apart from devotion
 keshav kaa acharyatva puure reetikaal ko gaurav pradaan karata he
 Method - Symptoms - The tradition of determining the example also appears in them first, even if it is inappropriate to separate Keshav from the ritual for this determination in the reticulum, so it is not appropriate to keep them in devotion
 bhaktikaal main lalit kalaon kaa utkarsh dikhaai detaa he
 Pictures of various leelas of Shri Krishna and Radha are found in this period, many idols expressing gentle and succulent expressions are found in this period
 murtikla kaa bahut vikaas is yug main bahut adhik hua tha
 Muslim style coordination in architecture, painting, and consequently the use of arches, domes etc
 became more visible in Indian style
 madhyakaal main rajasthani style adhik lokapriy thi
 In addition to human paintings, marking of natural scenes, various episodes of court life, murals are also received in this era
 ’qutubameenar’, ’adhaai din kaa jhunpda’ aadi aitihaasik vaastukala ke apratim namoonay hai
 In this way, fine arts were also greatly developed along with literature
 sangeet ke kshetra main bahut pragati hui
 The plan of the Krishnilalas to sing, sakhi, ramani, raga to the verse is not attainable elsewhere in this period
 sur or tulsi sahitya main anek raag-raganiyon kaa varnan aata he

 In 1694, Shah Alamgir sent Raja Bishan Singh Rajput and Kalyan Singh Bhadauria to suppress the Jats of Agra
 On 20 February 1695, attempts to surround the Jats began and they could not be suppressed till April
 In the end, in a blood-soaked war, the Rajput and Mughal forces captured the Jat strongholds around Cincinnia, but Jat leader Nand Ram managed to escape with all his sons
 After the exit of Cincinni's hand, the Panchayat was organized again in a secret place
 Bhaja Rama and his minor brother Braj Raj came out of unknown habit and according to the decision of the panchayat, assigned the responsibility of leading Jats to Braj Raj's son Chudaman
 The Panchayat army of Jats slaughtered Muslim and Rajput Faujdars at the strongholds and established Jat outposts everywhere
 In 1696, the Panchayati Army once again faced the imperial army

 usne vishwa-vijay evam ek naveen dharm ko sthapit karne ke apane vichaar ko apane mitra evam dilli ke kotwaal 'alaul mulk' ke samajhane par tyaag diya
 Although Alauddin accepted the title of 'yamin-ul-khilafat-nasiri-amir-ul-mominin' in recognition of the authority of the Caliphate, he did not think it necessary to take his post from the Caliph
 ulema varg ko bhi apane shashan kaary main hastkshep nahin karne diya
 He considered the interest of the state as paramount, not giving prominence to the principles of the religion of Islam in governance
 allaudin kilji ke samay nirankushta apane charam seemaa par pahunch gayi
 Alauddin Khilji neither resorted to the principles of Islam nor took the advice of the Ulema class in the rule

 Thus all these rebellions were successfully suppressed
 allaudin ne turk amiron dwaara kiye jane vaale vidroh ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan kar un kaarnon ko samaapt karne ke liye 4 adhyadesh jari kiye
 Under the first ordinance, Alauddin confiscated the land given to the rich in the form of donations, gifts and pensions and imposed a right of tax on him, due to which he lacked funds

 Under the third ordinance, Alauddin Khilji banned alcohol, cannabis and gambling

 Ranthambore ruler Hammir Dev was famous for his ability and courage
 allaudin ke liye ranthambhore ko jeetna isliye bhi aavashyak tha, kyonki hammirdev ne vidrohi mongol netaa mohammad shah evam kehab ko apane yahan sharan de rakhi thi, isliye bhi allaudin ranthambhore ko jeetna chahta tha
 Hence, in July 1301 AD, Alauddin took the fortress of Ranthambore into his possession
 hammirdev veergati ko praapt hue
 Alauddin killed Ranmal and his companions, who met Hammirdev by betraying him
 ‘tarikh-e-alaai’ evam ‘hammir mahakavy’ main hammirdev or unke parivaar ke logon kaa johar dwaara mrityu praapt hone kaa varnan he

 The ruler of Mewar was Rana Ratan Singh, whose capital was Chittor
 chittod kaa qila samrik drushtikon se bahut surakshit sthaan par bana hua tha
 Therefore this fort was in the eyes of Alauddin
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne amir khusarav ke rani shiba or suleman ke prem prasang ke ullekh aadhaar par or 'padmavat kii katha' ke aadhaar par chittod par na ke akraman kaa kaaran rani padmini ke anupan soundarya ke prati uske aakarshan ko tehraaya he

 Certain factors increase the risk of disease progression in a person
 inamen shaamil hai: The WCRF panel report Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective has conclusively found evidence that alcoholic beverages increase the risk of colorectal cancer in men
 NIAAA ne report di he ki: "jaanapadik-rogavigyaan sambandhi adhyayan ne paaya he ki alcohol khapat or colorectal cancer ke bich ek chota lekin drudh khuraaq-nirbhar judaa he, yahaan tak ki jab fibre or anya aahaareey karkon kaa niyantran karne par bhi

" "consumption of alcohol in large quantities can also increase the risk of colorectal cancer"
 One study found that "people who consume more than 30 grams of alcohol per day are seen to have a slightly higher risk of colorectal cancer in such people
" " ek or adhyayan main paaya gaya ki "aadhaar rekha par pratidin ek yaa ek se adhik maadak peya kii khapat lagbhag 70% se adhik brihadantra cancer ke khatre se judi hoti he

 Colorectal cancer is a disease arising from epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract and as a result of mutations with the Wnt signaling pathway
 kuch utparivartan anuvaanshik hote hai or anya uparjit hote hai
 The most common mutated gene of all colorectal cancers is the APC gene, which produces APC protins
 β ketenin par APC protein "brake" he
 Without APC, β-catenin moves into the kidney and binds to DNA and more proteins are activated
 
 In addition to defects in the wnt-apc-beta catenin signaling pathway, other mutations are required for the cell to become cancerous
 p53 jin dwaara TP53 protein utpaadit hota he, saamaanya rup se koshika vibhaajan par nigaraanee rakhata he or yadi unamem Wnt pathave dosha hota he to koshikaon ko nasht kar detaa he
 Ultimately, a cell line acquires a mutation in the p53 gene and transforms tissue from a gland into an invasive carcinoma
 
 Another apoptotic protein is tgf-β
 kam se kam colorectal cancer ke aadhe main, tgf-β main bhi ek vikarmanyan utparivartan hota he
 
 kuch jin onkosin hote hai - ve colorectal cancer main adhik abhivyakt hote hai
 For example, RAS, RAF and PI3K that normally stimulate cells to divide in response to growth factors and with mutations that oversimplify them can be mutated
 saamanytah PTEN PI3K ko roktaa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi PTEN utparivartit ho jate hai
 It takes many years for colorectal cancer to grow and if colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment may be possible

 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against taking aspirin in a clinical practice guideline
 The task force acknowledged that aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but "concluded that high doses of aspirin and the use of NSAID for the prevention of colorectal cancer suppress the benefit"
 a meta-analysis later concluded that "an uncontrolled controlled trial of 300 mg or more of aspirin daily for about 5 years with a latency of 10 years is effective in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer"
 However, taking a dose of more than 81 mg per day for a longer period of time may increase blood flow

 Business process management is a management approach that focuses on combining all aspects of the organization with the needs and requirements of customers
 yah purnataavaadi prabandhan drushtikon he jo navonmesh, lacheelaapan, praudyogiki ke saath ekikaran ke liye prayaas karte hue, vyapaar main prabhavakaarita or kaarykushalta ko badhaava detaa he
 Business process management continuously strives to improve processes
 isliye ise ek "prakriya anukulan prakriya" ke rup main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 It has been argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient and more effective and more capable of change than a methodologically focused, traditional hierarchical management approach
 ek vyapaar prakriya "saamaanya vyavsaayik lakshya kii uddeshypurna prapti ke liye, uske sambanddh kirdaaron yaa sahyogiyon dwaara nishpadit, mulya-yojit gatividhiyon kii shrinkhalaa yaa network he
 “these processes are important for any organization because they generate revenue and often represent a significant proportion of the cost
 ek prabandhkeey drushtikon ke rup main, prakriyaaon ko kisi sanghathan ke samrik mahatv kii parisampattiyon ke rup main maanata he jise samajhnaa, sanchalit karnaa, graahakon ko mulya-yojit utpaada or sevaayen pradaan karne ke liye sudhaarna zaruri he
 This foundation is very similar to other total quality management or continuous improvement process methods or approaches
 BPM yah kehete hue ek qadam aage jaataa he ki is drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya ja saktaa he, yaa praudyogiki ke madhyam se sakasham banaaya ja saktaa he, taaki tanaav or parivartan ke samay main prabandhkeey drushtikon kii vyavhaaryata sunishchit ho sake
 vastutah, BPM sanghathan main "badlaav kshamta" - donon maanviya or takneekee, ke ekikaran ke liye ek drushtikon he
 In this way, many BPM articles and pundits often discuss BPM from one or two perspectives: people and / or technology
 mote taur par, prakriya kaa vichaar utana hi paaramparik he jitna kaary, vibhaag, utpaadan, nirgam kii avadharanaen
 vartmaan prabandhan or sudhaar drushtikon, aupchaarik paribhaasha or takneekee modelling ke saath, 1990 dashak ke prarambh se maujuud rahi hai 
 note karen ki IT samudaay main, 'vyapaar prakriya' shabd aksar middleware prakriyaaon ke prabandhan; yaa anuprayog software kaaryon ke ekikaran ke paryaayavachi ke rup main prayukt hota he
 This approach may seem highly restrictive
 ise dhyaan main rakhana hoga, jab software ejineering dastauez padhe ja rahe hon, jinamein 'vyapaar prakriyaaon' yaa 'vyapaar modelling' kaa sandarbh diya gaya ho
 Although bpm's initial focus was on automation of mechanics business processes, it has since expanded to human-driven processes, where human interactions occur in series or parallel to mechanics processes
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab vyapaar prakriya main ek vyakti qadam rakhata he jahaan maanviya antargyaan yaa nirnay lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, in charnon ko sanghathan ke samuchit sadasyon ko saunpa jaataa he
 More advanced forms, such as human interaction management, involve complex interactions between human workers to perform a workgroup function
 is maamle main, kai log or pranaliyaan ek se adhik kaary-sampadan ko puraa karne ke liye sanrachanabaddh, tadarth or kabhi-kabhi puri tarah gatisheel tareekon se paraspar-kriya karte hai
 BPM can be used to understand organizations through a wide range of scenarios that would otherwise not be available to organize and present
 These considerations include the relationship of processes to each other, which, when incorporated into process models, provide advanced reporting and analysis that would not otherwise be available
 BPM ko kuch log udhyam saamagree prabandhan kii ridh maanate hai
 Because BPM allows organizations to present business process abstracts from technology infrastructures, it goes beyond the automation of business processes or the resolution of business problems
 BPM vyavsaay ko apane pratiyogiyon kii tulana main tezi se, badalte upabhokta, bazaar or viniamak maangon ke prati pratikriya jataane main sakasham banaata he
 More recently, technology has allowed the coupling of BPM with other methods such as Six Sigma
 BPM upkaran ab upyogkarta ko nimnlikhit kii anumati dete hai: It will bring with it the benefit of enabling the simulation of changes in your business process based on real-life data, and the coupling of BPM to industry practices allows the user to continuously streamline and streamline processes and adapt to their market needs
 Be consistent according to vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan gatividhiyon ko paanch virgon main rakhaa ja saktaa he: dizine, modelling, nishpaadan, nigaraanee or anukulan
 Process design includes both the identification of prevailing processes and the design of "future" processes
 dhyaan cendran ke kshetron main shaamil hai prakriya pravaah kaa pratinidhitiv, uske antargat abhinayta, chetavaniyaan or adhisuchanaaen, vruddhi, maanak sanchaalan prakriyaayein, seva str samjhaute or kaary supurdagee tantra
 Good design reduces the number of problems over the life of the process
 bhale hi maujuuda prakriyaaon par vichaar kiya jaae yaa naa kiya jaae, is qadam kaa lakshya yah sunishchit karnaa he ki ek sahi or kushal saidhantik dizine taiyaar kii jaae
 The proposed reform can be a human-to-human, human-to-system and system-to-system workflow and can target regulatory, market, or competitive challenges faced by businesses
 modelling saidhantik dizin letaa he or char ke sangyojan ko pravartit karata he It also involves running a "what-if analysis" on the processes: "what if i have 75% of the resources to do the same thing?" "what if i wanted to do the same thing at 80% of the current cost?"
 prakriyaaon ko swachaalit karne ke tareekon main ek he aisa anuprayog viksit karnaa yaa khareednaa jo prakriya ke apekshit charnon ko karyanvit karen; tathaapi, vyavhaar main, ye anuprayog virale hi prakriya ke sabhi charan sateek or puri tarah karyanvit karte hai
 Another approach is to use a combination of software and human intervention; But this approach is more complex, making the documentation process difficult
 in samasyaon kii pratikriya ke rup main, software viksit kiya gaya he jo computer bhashaa main paribhaashit karne yogya sampurna vyapaar prakriya ko sakasham banaata he jise computer par sidhe karyanvit kiya ja sake
 system, vyapaar prachaalanon ke nishpaadan ke liye sambandhit anuprayogon main sevaaon kaa upyog karegaa yaa yaa, jab koi charan swachaalan ke liye bahut jatil ho, maanav input maangega
 pichley drushtikonon main se kisi bhi ek kii tulana main, prakriya paribhaasha kaa sidhaa karyanvayan adhik spasht hoga or isliye sudhaar main aasaan hoga
 tathaapi, prakriya paribhaasha ke swachaalan ke liye lacheelaapan or vyapak buniyadi suvidhaon kii zarurat he, jo aam taur par in pranaaliyon ke viraasati IT parivesh main karyanvayan ko varjit karti he
 Business rules have been used by systems to provide definitions for controller behaviors, and business rules engines can be used to process and implement proposals
 nigaraanee main vyaktigat prakriyaaon kii trekking shaamil hai, taaki unki sthiti par jaankaree aasaani se dekh saken or ek yaa anek prakriyaaon ke nishpaadan par aankade uplabdh karaae ja saken
 trekking kaa ek udhaaharan graahak aadesh kii sthiti kaa nirdhaaran karne main sakasham kiya janaa he taaki is prachaalan kii samasyaon ko pahachaanaa ja sake or sahi kar saken
 Additionally, this information can be used to work with customers and suppliers to improve their respective processes
 Examples of statistics are to generate measures on quick processing of customer orders or how many orders were processed in the previous month
 ye upaay teen virgon main samaate nazar aate hai: samay chakra, dosha dar or utpaadakta
 The amount of monitoring will depend on what information is required to be evaluated and analyzed by the business, and what kind of monitoring the business wants, real-time, approximate real-time or ad hoc
 Here, business activity monitoring provides and extends monitoring tools that are typically provided by BPMS
 prakriya khanan prakriya nigaraanee se sambandhit paddatiyon or upkarnon kaa sangrah he
 The purpose of process mining is to analyze event logs extracted through process maintenance and compare them with a priori process model
 Process mining allows process analysts to detect anomalies and analyze bottlenecks between the actual process implementation and a priori model
 prakriya anukulan main shaamil he modelling yaa anurakshan charan se prakriya nishpaadan kii punarprapti; sambhavya yaa vaastavik baadhaon kii pahchaan or laagat bachat yaa anya sudhaaron ke liye sambhavya avasar; or phir, prakriya kii dizine main un sanvarddhanon ko lagu karnaa
 samagratah, yah adhik vyapaar mulya taiyaar karata he
 Where phases can be viewed as a cycle, economic or time constraints are likely to limit the process to only a few iterations
 yah aksar un maamalon main hota he jab kisi sanghathan dwaara, sanghathanaatmak samskruti ko badalane ke bajaay laghu se madhyam avadhi ke uddeshyon ke liye drushtikon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Real iterations are only possible through the collaborative efforts of the participants in the process
 adhikansh sanghathanon main jatilta ke liye, in dainik prakriya prabandhan chunautiyon main, prakriya ke sahabhaagiyon ko samarthan dene ke liye samarth praudyogiki kii apeksha hoti he 
 To date, many organizations have often initiated BPM projects or programs with the aim to optimize an area that has been identified for improvement
 vittiya kshetra main, BPM yah sunishchit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki viniamak anupalnon kaa anurakshan karte hue bhi system gunvattta purna seva detaa he
 Presently, international standards for work are limited to applications for IT sectors only and ISO / IEC 15944 covers operational aspects of the business
 tathaapi, sarvottam prathaon kii samskruti ke saath kuch nigam apane parichaalan prakriyaaon ko viniyamit karne ke liye maanak prachaalan kaary-pranali kaa istemaal karte hai
 Other standards are currently being worked on to support BPM implementation
 kuch log BPM pranali yaa set ko "puure BPM" ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 Other enterprises describe the important concept of dynamic information between software packages and consider the immediate service-oriented structure
 iske alaava bhi kuch log paribhaasha ko "modelling


 'sahi' prakriya taiyaar karne ke liye," tak simit karenge 
 These are partial answers and technical presentations will continue to evolve
 BPMS posts may not exist
 Today it includes the concept of supporting a managerial approach through enabling technology
 BPMS sabhi hitdharakon ko ek sanghathan or uske nishpaadan ke bare main thos samaj rakhane main sakasham banaaen
 BPMS upar varnit jivan-chakra ke dauraan vyapaar prakriya ko badalane kii suvidha pradaan karen
 yah gatividhiyon ke swachaalan, anya pranaaliyon ke saath sahyog, ekikaran, mulya shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se sahyogiyon ke ekikaran aadi main sahaayak hoga
 udhaaharan ke liye, dainik kaaryon ke aakaar or jatilta ke liye aksar kushal model ke liye praudyogiki ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa he
 These models facilitate automation and the resolution of business problems
 ye model vyavsaay prakriyaaon ke anurakshan or niyantran main sahaayta dene ke liye nishpaadan yogya bhi ho sakate hai
 Therefore, some people also see BPM as a "bridge between information technology and business"
 
 vastutah, ek tark diya ja saktaa he ki yah "samgr drushtikon" sanghathanaatmak or takneekee silon ko jodta he
 The BPM set has four important components: BPM in vyapaar chaalkon ko sahaara dene vaale kai mahatvapurn IT muddon kaa bhi samaadhaan karata he, jinamein ye bhi shaamil hai: Validation of BPMS is another technical issue that vendors and users need to know if regulatory compliance is mandatory
 manyakaran kaary yaa to praadhikrut tisare paksh dwaara yaa swayan upyogkartaaon dwaara nishpadit kiya ja saktaa he
 Either way, validation documentation will need to be generated
 Validation documents can generally either be published officially or retained by users
