 Although Marvarman Raj Singh II received the assistance of Lanka, he was defeated by the Chola King Parantaka
 pehle usne lanka or phir kerala main sharan lee
 Thus the Pandya kingdom came under the control of the Cholas and often had no independent power for three centuries
 kintu pandya rajvansh ne kabhi bhi is apmanjanak sthiti ko sweekaar nahin kiya or nirantar vidroh ke dwaara cholon ko chaiyn nahin lene diya
 Veer Pandya II took advantage of the disastrous situation of the Cholas due to the invasion of Rashtrakuta king Krishna II and liberated himself

 kintu rajraj pratham ne pandya naresh kaa phir parajeet kiya
 Due to the rebellious tendencies of the Pandyas, Rajendra i also invaded Madura and from the point of view of security, it was the practice of giving the rule of this state to the Chola Pandya Upadhyukta Chola princes
 lekin pracheen pandya rajvansh ke vyakti phir bhi batch rahe the
 They often opposed the Cholas along with Lanka

 The Pandyas were under the Cholas but were gradually freed from their influence

 The Cholas supported Veer Pandya for the Pandya throne and drove away Kulasekhar
 is baar parakrambahu ne vir pandya ko cholon ke viruddh apane paksh main kar liya
 But the Cholas again emerged victorious and placed Vikram Pandya on the throne of Madura
 vir pandya ne bhi cholon kii adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 Taking advantage of the diminishing power of the Cholas, the Pandyas established their independent kingdom
 pandyon ke is dwitiya samrajya kaa prarambh jatavarman kulsekhar se hota he
 But Jatavarman Kulasekhar's desire to be independent was suppressed by the Chola King Kulottung III

 He invaded the Chola kingdom and conquered Chindabaram

 The second time he defeated the Chola King Rajaraja III, but this time even after the intervention of the Hoysalas he could not retain permanent authority over the Chola Empire
 phir bhi use rajya kii seemayen vistrut thim
 Marwarman Sundar Pandya II was defeated by the Chola King Rajendra III, but the Hoysalas did not allow the Cholas to arbitrate by taking the side of the Pandyas

 He overwhelmed his contemporaries Chera, Hoysala, Chola, Telugu, Kakatiya and Baan with his might

 He used the wealth gained from his victories to make the temples of Chidambaram and Srirangam attractive and thriving

 Jatavarman related the rule of Pandya princes as the king

 Jatavarman Veer Pandya was the main king along with Jatavarman Sundar Pandya I
 marvarman kulsekhar ne jatavarman sundar pandya ke antim varshon main hi uparaja ke rup main shashan anrabh kar diya tha
 He himself was associated with a number of subalterns, the main ones being Jatavarman Sundar Pandya II and III, Jatavarman Veer Pandya II and Marvarman Vikram Pandya

 He again defeated the kings of Chola, Hoysala and Lanka and other rulers

 Jaswant Singh Randhawa and his sister Virendra "veeran" live in a small village in Punjab with their elderly mother
 kripal singh jaswant ke bachapan kaa dost or viraan kaa mangetar hai, or vah apane dadaji ke saath unke ghar ke paas hi rahata he
 One day the police, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra, come to their village in search of Jimmy, who allegedly attempted to assassinate Indian MP Kedarnath
 jaswant mazaaq karte hue police ko apane kute, jimi kii taraf le jaataa he, jis kaaran maare apmaan ke khurana or vohara jaswant ko poochtacha ke liye apane saath le jate hai
 When Jaswant does not return for several days, Kripal takes care of all the police stations in the area to find Jaswant while looking after Jaswant's family
 jab jaswant antat 15 dinon ke baad waapas aata he, to police dwaara kiye gaye atyaacharon ke kaaran buree haalat main hota he, jisase kripal krodhit ho jaataa he
 When Kripal is unable to obtain the help of any legal means to fight police brutality, he sets out to find his cousin Jeet, who has ties with terrorist groups
 jite ko khojate samay kripal kii mulaakaat sanathan se hoti he, jise vah ek bas main bam lagaate hue dekh letaa he
 He meets Sanathan again in a dhaba, where he urges Sanathan to listen to his story
 sanathan use commander dwaara sanchalit apane trek par yatra karne kii sahmati de detaa he, jisamen vah gharelu nirmit bamon or do ugravadiyon ko le ja rahaa hota he
 Upon arriving at his whereabouts, Kripal tells him his plight, and then realizes that Jeet is killed by the commander because of being a police informer
 kripal kii prishthbhumi, parivaar or uski durdasha ke bare main jaanane ke baad, commander kripal ko daantate hue kahata he ki ve log peshewar hatyare nahin hai
 He asks Kripal to kill Khurana himself, and at the same time assures that his group will protect Kripal as much as possible
 kripal dhire-dhire baaki samooh or sanathan kii nazaron main sammaan kamata he, jo use bataate hai ki ve log rashtravaadi yaa dharmik kaarnon ke liye nahin, balki apane mul naagarik adhikaron or aatm sammaan ke liye ye ladaai lard rahe hai
 Sanathan tells him that he is fighting against a system that hunts innocent people, and reduces the values of ordinary people
 baad main kripal ko pataa chalaa he ki santhaan 1947 main bharat ke vibhaajan ke saath hua sampradayik hinsa kaa ek uttarajive he, jisane 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon main apane adhikansh parivaar ko kho diya tha
 Sanathan claims that it is only the ruling class, which is trying to divide the society for political gains
 samooh ke saath training karte hue kripal khurana kii hatya kii yojana banaata he
 a year later, he kills Khurana in front of everyone in a busy market
 gaayab ho jane se pehle vah jaswant or viraan se ek antim baar milane jaataa he
 When Kripal returns to the group's hideout, he finds the place empty
 kuch dinon tak chupe rahane ke baad, samooh kaa ek sadsy usase sampark karata he, or bataata he ki commander ne himachal pradesh main samooh kaa nayaa thikaana bana liya he
 The commander tells Kripal that the police has suspected him, and they take Jaswant back for questioning
 kripal ko dhire-dhire pataa chalata he ki saamaanya jivan main vaapasi ke sabhi raste uske liye band ho chuke hai, or vah us samooh ko hi apana parivaar maanane lagata he, jo ab ek nae mishan kii taiyaari kar rahaa he or ek missile firing visheshgy ke aagaman kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 When Kripal applies for a job in the local area, Sanathan warns him that he is now a terrorist in the eyes of the media, and a means of promotion in the eyes of police officers
 samooh ke sadasyon main se ek, kuldeep kaa saamana police se hota he, jisame vah buree tarah se chotil ho jaataa he
 Horrified by this experience, Kuldeep asks Sanathan permission to go home, and promises to immigrate to Canada
 sanathan anichhaa se use sahmati de detaa he, or ek bam uske bag main daal detaa he, jisase vah raste main hi mar jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his companions, Jaimal Singh, is actually Jimmy, whose police had come to Jaswant's house that day in search of him
 iske turant baad, missile shooter vahaan aata he or tab kripal ko yah pataa chalata he ki vah koi or nahin balki uski mangetar viraan he
 When the two finally get alone one day, Veeran tells Kripal that Jaswant was severely beaten when he was taken for questioning after Khurana's murder, after which he committed suicide in jail
 Had done it
 is traasadee ke bare main sunate hi unki maa kii bhi mrityu ho gai, or inspector vohara rose unke ghar aane laga, jisase pareshaan hokar viraan ne bhi kripal ke nakshekadam par chalane kaa faisla kiya or usase milane kaa prayaas karne lagi
 The close between Kripal and Veeran starts growing again
 mishan kaa khulaasa saansad kedarnath ko maarane kii saazish ke rup main hota he, jo apni pichhali sthaneey sikh tirth kii yatra ke samay jimi ke haathon batch gaya tha
 While living together, Kripal and Veeran decide to get married quietly, and Veeran quietly steals Kripal's cyanide bullet, which was given to each member of the group to be used by the police in case they are caught
 gupt rup se sikh tirth kaa daura karte samay kripal constel inspector vohara ko dekhtaa he, jise kedarnath kii yatra ke liye suraksha kaa prabhaar diya gaya he
 Kripal follows Vohra to her house, but is arrested by the police while attempting to kill him
 is bich, samooh kaa ek sadsy kripal ko vohara ke nivas main pravesh karte dekh letaa he
 Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concluded that Kripal was a police informer
 iske baad usne viraan par kripal kii madad karne ke aarope lagaaya or us par nazar rakhane kaa aadesh diya
 On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move forward and tells Vaziren to kill Veeran
 However, Veeran breaks free and kills Vaziren
 is bich, jaimal or sanathan mishan par nikal pade
 Jaimal was killed while stopping Kedar Nath's motorcade on a bridge, while Sanathan fired a missile to blow up Kedar Nath's car
 kab sanathan vahaan se bhaag nikalne kaa prayaas karata he, to viraan uskaa peechha kar use maar detii he
 The film ends with Veeran, who is yet to be revealed as a member of the group
 vah kripal se milane jail main jaati he, or vahaan jaakar kripal ko isaki synide kii goli dekar apni vaali goli kha leti he
 The film was released on 25 October 1996
 film ko kendriya film pramann board dwaara bina kisi cat ke jari kar diya gaya tha, haalanki kuch raajnneetigyon ne film kii release par aapatti jataate hue kaha tha ki isamen punjab main aatankwaad kaa ek vikrut drushtikon darshaya gaya he

 The egg is the round or elliptical living thing that is produced by the female of many creatures
 adhikansh jaanwaron ke andon ke upar ek kathor aavaran hota he jo ande kii suraksha karata he
 Although eggs are the way for livestock to produce their offspring, but egg feeding is also useful

 The sparrows' eggs of each species may have some variation, but have their own characteristics
 prayek jati ke pakshiyon ke andon kaa aakaar, maap or rang anoothaa hota he
 There is a correlation in the life, size, shape, surface composition and color of birds
 usee prakaar ek thok yaa samooh ke antargat andon kii sankhya or kisi ritu main thokon kii sankhya main ek sambandh hota he
 The measurement of the egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end
 saath saath andon ke nukile bhaag ghonsle ke madhya main kendrit ho jane or unka golakaar bhaag baahar kii ore hone se, yadi ghonsle main teen chaar andey hon to ve sabhi aasaani se ant jate hai
 The eggs of some sparrows are nearly spherical
 ullu ke andey golakaar or bataasi ke andey patale or donon chhoron par gol hote hai
 Some sparrows have smooth surfaces, some have shiny, some have very polished and some have rough and rough
 andon kaa rang bhi bhinn bhinn chidiyon main bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Some sparrows' eggs are white, but some eggs are colored, green, blue, brown, and lacy
 kuch ke andon kaa rang bilkul ek samaan hota he or kuch kaa chitkabara athwa chiththidaar
 The spots are in the form of spots, or rashes, and are small or excessive
 dhabbe andon kii sataha par samaan rup se bikhare ho sakate hai, athwa kisi bhaag main adhik or kisi bhaag main kam
 Some species of birds have individual differences in the color and markings of eggs of different members within the same caste
 andey kaa rang mukhya rup se rakshaatmak hota he
 Therefore, the color of eggs given on green branches is green and the color of eggs given on the ground is often brown
 kotor athwa bill ke andey praaia: safed hote hai, jisase pakshi andhere main bhi unka pataa laga sake
 Gilmatt and Razorbill lay only one egg, two species of Paravat or wild pigeon and Garuda, three different species of Dhomra or Gangchilli and four different species of Tittibha lay four eggs
 anek jatiyaan paanch chah andey tak detii he
 Eggs are found in small rhizomes of some songs from seven to eight to twelve
 shikaar kii kuch chidiyon or batakhon main isse bhi or adhik sankhya pai jaati he
 Most birds, if their eggs are stolen, or destroyed, or they are forced to abandon the eggs, lay eggs again, because every bird has a certain number of eggs
 jab tak yah sankhya puri nahin ho jaati, vah andey dena samaapt nahin karti
 Sparrows usually lay once in a season
 kuch gaanevaali chidiyaan ritukal main do yaa teen baar bhi bachche utpann karti hai
 Sparrows whose eggs and children are more destroyed, or who are young, have a faster reproduction and a greater number of eggs
 chidiyon kii aayu kaa bhi prabhaav unke andon kii sankhya par padataa he
 The first-to-date sparrows lay fewer eggs and the second or third-spawn sparrows lay more eggs
 andon kii sankhya jab puri ho jaati he, tab unka sena prarambh hota hai
 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night
 kuch jatiyon main keval maadaa hi andey seti hai, kintu aisi avasthaa main nar uske liye bhojan jutata he
 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn
 anda-seven-kaal main maadaa kaa dhyaan andey sene main kuch aisa lag jaataa he or usamen aisi ekaagratha utpann ho jaati he ki yadi koi uske andey ko hataakar anya koi vastu, jaise pathar ke tukade, rode ityadi, bhi rakh de to vah bina dekhe sune unpar baithkar unhen seti rahegi
 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period
 kabutaron main nar bade chaav se anda seta he he
 Not only this, but the female removes herself and sits on the eggs
 nar swayan nahin de saktaa, kintu santanprem kii abhilaashaa se vah kisi tarah maadaa ko rijhaakar joda band letaa he, maadaa se andey dilava letaa he or phir uske baad unke sene tathaa shishupaalan kii sari kriya swayan bade chaav se sampann karata he
 Lapland and Auk species have higher numbers of males, fewer females
 at: sabhi nar joda baandhane main safal nahin ho pate, par unki anda sene tathaa santan paalan kaa abhilaashaa dil se nahin jaati
 In contrast, there are some birds who serve eggs to others rather than themselves
 koyal, papiha aadi inamen mukhya hai, jo chori se apane andey kauwe, charkhi athwa satbhiye aadi ke ghonslon main rakh aate hai or unhen murkh banaakar unase dhatri kaa kaam lete hai
 There are some birds, which neither incubate the eggs themselves nor serve them to others, but cook and protect them from the heat of the sun
 shuturamurg naamak pakshi apni chaati kii ragad se gaddha taiyaar karata he or uske chaaron ore chonch se baaluu rakhkar diwaar si khadi kar letaa he
 Then in this, females, usually 20 to 30, lay eggs
 shaturamurg kii ek hi maadaa nahin hoti, ek nar kii kai patniyaan hoti hai or ye sabhi baari se isamen andey parti jaati hai
 After the laying of the eggs is complete, a small layer of sand is laid on them
 din bhar surya kii kirnon se ye andey garam rahete hai
 In the night, these birds sit on them and provide warmth to them
 kai pakshi aise hai, jo kisi ushn jal ke jharne ke sameep gadhe banaakar unamem andey dete hai, phir unhen dhakkar anyatra chale jate hai
 These eggs keep warm with the hot water of the spring
 samay puraa hone ke din ye lautakar aate hai or upar kii mitti ko hataa dete hai, phir bachche andey phodkar baahar chale aate hai
 Where there is extreme heat, the birds arrange to keep the eggs cold, not warm
 iske liye ve jal main apni chonch bhigo bhigokar unase andon ko bhigote rahete hai, taaki atyadhik taap ke kaaran unhen kshati na pahunche
 Seven times are also different among sparrows

 In some, the intake period is of one month and in others it is less than two weeks

 It takes three weeks for the hen to hatch, four to the pheasant, five to the swan and two to the bird named Candor

 When the embryo is fully developed, the bird strikes repeatedly with its beak to come out of the egg-like prison and, according to race, in the middle of the egg, or any other wide site, there is a crack and the baby comes out

 us samay vah ek taral padaarth se bhigaa hua sa rahata he, jo hawa lagane se sheeghra hi suukh jaataa he
 Children of chicken, pheasant, ostrich etc

 cannot open their eyes for several days
 ve ek nirih si avasthaa main pade rahete he tathaa hafton tak dhonsle main hi apane shishav ke din bitaate hai
 The first few weeks of the baby bird when coming out of the egg have some special difficulties and dangers
 in dinon vah na keval choti or kamjor hoti hai, balki praaia: swayan bhojan chugane main asamarth tathaa udne se bhi laachaar hoti he
 Infants of different species of birds are born in different conditions and on this basis they can be classified into the following two major categories: nidatyagi shishu kii ankhen janm se hi khuli hoti hai or inkaa sharir mulaayam paron se dhakaa hota he
 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge
 From the very beginning, they begin to feed themselves
 batakh or murgi ke shishu iske achche udhaaharan he
 Among wild birds, babies of tittibhas, hyacinths, ducks and other birds of prey do the same
 shikaar kii chidion main ek or visheshta yah hoti he ki ye sheeghra hi udne bhi lagati hai
 Nesting infants stay in the nest until they grow up after birth and have to depend completely on their parents for food

 The bird with which eggs hatch, also nurtures and protects their offspring with the same readiness
 santanraksha main bahudhaa dekha gaya he ki pakshi apane praan kii bhi chintaa nahin karte
 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly

 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others

 Then they leave the ground soon and stand ahead

 Ian Fleming went one step further and approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to produce a film adaptation of Live and Let Die or Moonraker
 haalanki corda ne shuru main dilchaspee dikhaai, lekin baad main peeche hat gaye
 On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film screenplay for Producer Kevin mcclory about Bond's character
 Jack Whitingham also worked on the script, which led to a screenplay titled James Bond, Secret Agent
 However, Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton refused to play the roles as director and hero respectively
 Meklory was unable to raise financing for the film and the deal was shattered
 fleming ne is kahani kaa istemaal apane upanyaas thanderbal ke liye kiya
 In 1959, producer Albert R
 Broccoli expressed interest in the adaptation of the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was not enthusiastic
 1961 main, broccoli ne phir harry saltzman ke saath bhagidaari kii or sabhi bond upanyaason ke film adhikaar ko fleming se kharid liya

 Broccoli and Fleming were convinced of Connery, but accepted it when he was rejected by Patrick mcguhan and dismissed Richard Johnson, James Mason, Rex Harrison, David Niven, Trevor Howard and Broccoli's friend Carrie Grant for him did
 jaisaa ki broccoli ne baad main kaha, "main ek damdaar aadmi chahta tha
 

and put a little bit of glee on that strong Scottish jism and you'll get Fleming's Bond instead of all the tantalizing gays being employed in this act "
 Already the bald Connery wore a wig in all of his Bond films
 conary ne kaha ki "aakhirkaar, vah charitra vastav main main nahin hum"

 The film was the second and final film starring Sylvia Trench, however, she was expected to be a regular bed partner between Bond's campaigns throughout the series
 The violence in the second film was definitely more intense than in the previous film, with the massacre more than double

 But viewers liked it and some critics called it brilliant, such as Bozley Crowder who said "don't leave it!"
 It was the first film in the series to feature almost all elements found throughout the series

 By 1961, Fleming's Thunderball novel became the biggest hit in the Bond novel series and was the project that drew Cubby Broccoli back in 1961 to form Bond projects - most of which were owned by Harry Salzmann - but Thunderball was its The notable exception was that year, which was given a storyline that made it a screenwriter and the subject of a legal dispute by Fleming

unke saude ke ek hisse ne yah sunishchit kiya ki mechlori das saal tak thanderbal par koi film nahin bana sakate 
 Barring Connery, there was a fierce rivalry for the leading characters

 After You Only Live Twice and despite the posters promoting "sean Connery is James Bond", Connery announced that it was his last Bond film
 shrunkhlaa ko chhod dene kii nirmaataaon kii koi ichha nahin thi
 Shawn was then replaced by George Lazenbai, who starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service

 His screen test was satisfactory and he was offered a contract for seven films
 haalanki, apane agent dwaara aashwast hone ke baad ki sikret agent 1970 ke dashak main puraatan ho jayega, lezenbai ne ek film ke baad shrunkhlaa ko chhod diya
 Lezenbai's reviews were generally encouraging
 kai logon ne mahasoos kiya ki vah shaareerik rup se to aakarshak tha lekin apane kai bhadkeeli poshaak parivartan main murkh lagata tha or apane sanvaadon ko thik se prastut ioen-nirmit bond shrunkhlaa main isi film main ek baar "chauthi diwaar" ke tuutane ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Also happened when Sean Connery hits the audience

 On Her Majesty's Secret Service, an attempt was made to depict a continuity with previous Bond films that featured scenes from several previous Bond films during the title sequence
 iske alaava, jab bond apane daftar main apana saamaan pack kar rahaa hota he, to pichley maamalon ke kai smriti chihnon ko dikhaaya jaataa he, jaise ki thanderbal kaa shwaas upkaran, jabaki film ke prishth sangeet main un filmon kii dhunon ko bajaayaa jaataa he
 After Lezenbai turned down Diamonds Are Forever, the makers decided to revert to the Goldfinger formula

 John Gavin was offered the role of Bond but the producers were simultaneously attempting to bring Sean Connery back into the role

 But since the latter film was filmed earlier, Blofeld was cast in the Diamonds Are Forever story to give Bond an opportunity to reprimand Blofeld
 iskaa arth tha ki blofeld ke bare main fleming kii teen kahaniyon ke bajaay ve chaar thi
 Connery returned to non-eon Never Again Again in 12 years in this role

 Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover were considered for the next film in the series, Live and Let Die, and forty-five-year-old Roger Moore was selected
 moore sabase lambey samay tak bond rahe or unhone is kirdaar main baarah saal bitaaye or saat filmein kii
 Moore tried not to mimic his role as Sean Connery or Simon Templar in The Saint, and he played Bond in a more pleasing and humorous appearance

 One reviewer stated, "sean Connery doesn't have any seriousness in Roger Moore
 

 vah nirdeshak dwaara bond kii ghaatak hasya abhinayta ke rup main prastuti main daksh rup se baithta he"
 As part of the challenge to create his own version of Bond, Moore mixed some of the characteristics of his role in his series The Saint with Bond's personality

 Roger Moore's third film, The Spy Who Loved Me, proved decisive for the series in two ways: it was the first film to be produced by Broccoli alone, as his half of the Bond film franchise due to a huge debt to Harry Saltzman in 1975 The share was forced to sell for twenty million pounds; And in that sense, it was also the first film to incorporate an entirely new story, as Ian Fleming only allowed the title of the novel to be used
 moore kii chauthi film, munarekar, bond kii aakhri film thi jiske liye fleming ke upanyaas kaa sheershak istemaal kiya gaya, lekin kaaphi baad main 2006 main kisino royaal ke sheershak kaa upyog kiya gaya
 The title was used from Bond's short story collection for the next two films, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, and the story of both films incorporated various material from this collection
 film octopussi ko, fleming kii isi naam kii laghu katha kii agali kadi ke rup main padhaa ja saktaa he
 Moore showed interest in leaving the series after the 1981 film, For Your Eyes Only, after which many young actors began to give screen tests for the role, including James Brolin, Oliver Tobias and Michael Billington
 However, EON eventually persuaded him to make a comeback in the 1983 Octopussy, as the non-eon film Never Say Never Again was released the same year
 kyonki ve aavashyak ection or charitra kii maang ke hisaab se umrdaraj ho gaye the film main aksar hi stant dubles kaa istemaal kiya gaya or keval nazadik se dikhne vaale moore nishchit rup se moore hai
 Moore only regretted his last film, a View to Kill, which was rejected by critics
 shaun conary ko pratisthapit karne ke liye timothy dalton par 1968 main vichaar kiya gaya tha, lekin ve yah mahasoos karte hue apane screen test se chale gaye ki 22 varsh kii umr main ve is bhoomika ke liye bahut chote hai
 12 years later, Dalton was approached again, presumably to replace Roger Moore in For Your Eyes Only, but the producers had no script and feared that he would be asked to do films like Spy Who Loved Me / Moonrecker Jaega ”which was not compatible with his concept of Bond films
 " dalton pratham abhinayta the jinhen da living delits kii peshkash kii gai thi, lekin shuru main unhen inkaar karnaa padaa kyonki shooting kii mul tareekhen unki brenda star film kii patibaddhtaon se takaraa rahi thim
 Pierce Broznan was then hired, but when his canceled television show Steel Remington was renewed in 1986, he could not progress
 kai abhinaytaon kaa screen test liya gaya, jisamen shaamil the sam nil or lui colins, jiske baad dalton ko nirmaan kii sanshodhit tareekhen pesh kii gayi jise ve sweekaar karne main samarth the or jaise hi ve brenda star ke filmakan se nivrutt hue unhone khud ko da living dellites ke set par paaya
 Dalton, best known for his stage and television roles and trained in the British Shakespearean tradition, had a strikingly different Bond from his predecessors

 In 1989, the year of Dalton's second and last appearance, MGM / UA was sold to Australian-based broadcasting group Quintex, which wanted to merge the company with Pathe

 Due to these legal disputes, this series had to go through a gap of six years
 However, EON began pre-production of another film in May 1990, which was to be released in late 1991
 "bond 17" ke liye aam prachaar saamagree kaa kareeb usee samay kans film samaaroh main anaavaran kiya gaya

 By then, the world had changed rapidly and Broznan had also gone through a period of change

" Although Connery's Scottish background, Lesenbai's Australian background, or Timothy Dalton's Welsh ancestry were seldom noted in the past, some British fans thought it was strange to see Bond playing an Irishman
 broznan kaa bond cigar peetaa tha or vah italvi nirmit suut pasand karata tha
 More importantly, Broznan's goldeneye was the first film in the series to be produced after the disintegration of the Soviet Union

 However, when it was released, the film was seen as a successful effort that effectively transformed the series into the 1990s

 During 2004, it was rumored that negotiations between the producers to pave the way for a new and younger actor broke

 In July 2004, Broznan announced that he was leaving the role and said "bond is behind me, a second lifetime", with some considering it another unsuccessful negotiation move

 British actor Colin Salmon, who played the role of Charles Robinson, who played MI6 in other Bond films with Pierce Broznan, was also considered for the role, and there was speculation that he would become the first black James Bond
 According to Martin Campbell, the only Henry Kavil was the only actor who was in serious competition for the role
 lekin us samay keval 22 saal ke hone ke kaaran, unhen is kirdaar ke liye bahut chota mana gaya
 In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that Sony and MGM and producer Michael G
 Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, but by that time EON Productions had not approached him
 baad main, craig ne kaha ki nirmaataaon ne vastav main unhen bhoomika kii peshkash kii he, lekin unhone is prastaav ko tab tak ke liye thukraa diya jab tak ki unhen padhane ke liye script uplabdh nahin karai jaati
 Encouraged by the success of Universal Pictures rival Jason Bourne Franchise, MGM and EON decided to "bring Bond back to its original form" with the removal of his idiosyncrasies and irrelevant fictional elements that define the series Were engaged and it was decided to introduce a more strict, darker and more genuine Bond than any of its former film avatars May coincide with Ian Fleming's original novel Bond
 is prakaar, bond kii 21veen film kisino royaal, pehali film thi jo 1974 kii di main wyeth di golden gan ke baad se fleming ke kisi upanyaas kaa filmi roopantaran thi
 The franchise had to be a restructuring, setting a new timeline and narrative structure that was not part of any previous film
 This not only freed Bond Franchise from the continuation of the last forty years but also allowed the film to feature a less experienced and more delicate Bond

 Moore's Bond is a bit humble and slightly more romantic than his predecessors or successors
 craig kaa bond thodaa adhik udasin or antarmukhi he, jabaki dalton kaa bond vishesh rup se kutil or krodhi he, jabaki usamen moore ke romantic gun bhi hai
 However, all bonds usually speak clever one-line dialogue under special circumstances

 Louise Maxwell played Miss Moneypenny alongside Connery, Moore and Lazenbai
 unke baad kairline bliss or samantha bond ne kramshah is bhoomika ko dalton or broznan ke saath nibhaayaa
 The trio certainly gave different dimensions to Moneypenny's personality, as did the six actors who played Bond
 a constant joke that runs throughout this film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and Bond's upward flirtation with her
 vah bhi uske saath ishk farmaati he or kabhi-kabhi vivaah ke ek prastaav or shaadi kii anguthi kii ummid main usase ruuth jaati he
 a fantasy scene in Die Another Day was the only occasion in the EON series that featured Moneypenny in a truly romantic embrace with Bond

 In Thunderball, he is distracted in the middle of a toss, when Moneypenny says he is late

 In a View to Kill, Bond has a very new hat of moneypenny and he just goes to throw it and stop
 or munarekar main jab bond venice main hota he, vah ek khaali gondola main apni gondolier topi ko uchhaalata he
 This customary sequence is carried on a wardroom Hatrack in a submarine, even down in the U
 Only Liv Twice, where M, Moneypenny and Bond are all in the Uniform of the Navy
 bond ko shuruuaat main hi em se milane ke liye bulaayaa jaataa tha, jo britain kii gupt khufia seva ke / kii pramukh he, vah inke karyaalay main apana kaarybhaar lene aata he
 In many films, Bond takes over his office at a secret headquarters or office

 m usually confides on his best agent but realizes the need to change Bond's risky ways and often preaches for his inconsiderate statement
 film main british sikret sarvice ke liye universal exportes kaa prayog ek cover naam ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It has been portrayed many times in movies such as a direction sign in Dr

 Altogether three actors played the role of M: Bernard Lee for the Connery, Lezenbai, and early Moore films; Robert Brown for Moore's last two films and Dalton's two films; Judy Dench for all of Broznan's and Craig's films to date
 apana kaarybhaar milane ke baad, bond ko aksar takneekee jaankaree ke liye kyuu shakha bheja jaataa tha jisamen unhen apane mishan main istemaal karne ke liye vishesh upkaran saunpa jaataa tha

 Many continuous jokes are displayed in the laboratory

 ek anya yah bhi tha ki kaise itani aasaani se prayogshali main bond vichlit ho jaataa he jab kyuu upkarnon ke istemaal ke bare main vivaran ko jaldi jaldi bolne ke madhyam se bhuulawane kii koshish karata he jise bond kii smriti main aane kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Another joke is that Bond is happy with the response to the latest equipment and the angry response from the quartermasters
 Also there are short jokes that demonstrate the prototype device
