 Madhavacharya was the pioneer of his time in many ways, he has gone against the prevalent practices many times

 He wrote a commentary on the Brahmasutra of Dvaita philosophy and also wrote an independent text 'anuvayakhyana' for logical confirmation of the lecture of his Vedanta

 He received his education from Acharya, a follower of Shankara Matha, Achutpreksh, and after making a discussion with the Guru, he formed his own separate opinion, which is called "dvaita darshan"

 Like Ramanuja, he supported Sri Vishnu's practice of amalgamating his limbs with signs of armaments, conch, chakra, mace and padma

 at: inke aadhaar par koi yathatathy vivaran madhwacharya ke jivan ke sambandh main nahin upasthit kiya ja saktaa
 Shri Madhvacharya developed his dualism theory from the departed scriptural texts
 yah `sadvaishnav ́ bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki yah shri ramanujacharya ke shri vaishnavatv se alag he
 Mr
 Madhwacharya studied the 'panch Bhide', which is also called the 'extreme Bhed Darshanam'
 uski paanch visheshtayen hai : Classification of the 'utmost bhed darshanam' in substance form has also been done in this way: swatantra vah he jo purna roopen swatantra he
 Which is God or eternal truth
 lekin jeevatma or jagat bhagwaan par ashrith hai
 That's why God controls them
 paramatma swatantra hai
 Therefore their classification is impossible
 ashrith tatva sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak rup main vibhajit kiye jate hai
 Positives can also be classified into conscious and unconscious
 achetan tatva ko paribhaashit karne ke pehle madhwacharya swatantra or ashrith ke bare main bataate hai jo sansar se nity mukt hai
 According to this ideology, 'vishnu' is independent who is the prudent and the controller of the world
 unki shakti lakshmi hai jo nity mukt hai
 We can find Vishnu in many forms of arithmetic and avatars
 usee prakaar atyant ashrith lakshmi bhi vishnu kii shakti hai or nity bhautik sharir liye hi kai rup dhaaran kar sakati hai
 He is beyond suffering
 unke putr brahma or vaayu hai
 The word 'prakriti' means p = beyond + Kriti = the confluence of the universe
 madhwacharya ne sristi or brahm ko alag mana he
 According to him Vishnu is the doer of the material world
 bhagwaan prakruti ko lakshmi dwaara shashakt banaate hai or use drishy jagat main parivartit karte hai
 Nature is the physical cause of physical objects, bodies and organs
 prakruti ke teen pahaluon se teen shaktiyaan aavirbhoot hai : lakshmi, bhu or durga
 Avidya is also a form of nature that hides the divine from the soul
 madhwacharya ji kaa vishwaas he ki prakruti se bani dharti maaya nahin, balki paramatma se pruthak satya he
 It is not the same change as the curd hidden in milk, nor the form of God
 isliye yah avishesh dwaitvaad hi he
 Madhvacharya accepted Ramanujacharya's classification of souls
 jaise :-- Madhvacharya added two more classes with him which is worthy of salvation and which is not worthy of salvation: is vargeekaran ke anusaar jeevatma kaa ek alag astitv he
 Thus one soul is different from another soul
 iskaa arthatma anek hai
 The Jeevatma is dependent on the divine instructions from God and being different from nature
 unke pichley janmon ke aadhaar par paramatma unhen prerit karte hai
 According to the previous deeds, the living beings suffer, due to which their soul becomes pure and freed from life and death and experiences the joy which is the spontaneity of the soul
 anandanubhuti main jeevatma bhinn hoti he
 But there is no disharmony in them and they become holy and attain Parabrahma
 lekin ve paramatma ke baraabar nahin ho saktin
 They become worthy of serving God
 navdha bhakthi maarg se aatma paramatma kii krupa se mukti praapt kar leti he
 There are many disciples influenced by Madhavacharya

 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period but mainly Vedavas ji is considered the author of many Upanishads

 Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which first emerged in publication in 1887
 vah british lekhak or chikitsak sar arthur conan doyal kii upaj he
 a talented "consultant detective" of London, Holmes is noted for his intellectual acumen and his clever observation, permissive reasoning and efficient use of conclusions to solve difficult cases
 conan doyal ne chaar upanyaas or chappan laghu kathaayen likhi hai jisamen homes ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 The first two stories appeared in the Beatons' Christmas Annals in 1887 and the Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890 respectively
 The character's popularity increased immensely with the introduction of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891
 baad main 1927 tak laghu kathaon kii shrinkhalaa or do dharawahik upanyaas prakashit hue

 All four stories are narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr
 John H
 Watson, two stories narrated by Holmes himself and two others by a third person
 do kahaniyon main homes, watasan ko apni smriti se mukhya kahani sunaate hai, jabaki watasan frem kahani kaa varnan karte hai
 Conan Doyle stated that Holmes' character was inspired by Dr
 Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle worked at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as a clerk
 homes kii tarah, bel chote-chote nirikshanon se bade nishkarsh nikaalane ke liye jane jate the
 Michael Harrison has argued in a 1971 article Ellery Queens Mystery Magazine that the character was inspired by Wendell Scherr, a "consulting detective" in a murder case that allegedly overshadowed newspaper headlines in England in 1882 
 dow watasan dwaara darj saahasik karnaamon ke baahar sherl homes kii jeevani ke bare main spasht jaankaree bahut kam he or conan doyal kii mul kahaniyon main bhi nahin he; phir bhi, uske praarambhik jivan kii praasangik jaankaree or vistrut parivaar se is jasoos ke jivan kaa ek kaakaa taiyaar hota he
 Holmes's birth in the story His Last Bow is estimated around 1854; Generally, the date is quoted as 6 January
 homes kahata he ki jab vah snaatak-purv kaksha main tha, tab usne pehali baar anumiti vidhi viksit kii

 Her initial cases, which she carried out as an amateur, came through fellow students at her university
 homes ke anusaar, apane ek sahpaathee ke pita se mulaaqaat ne use jasusi ko ek peshey ke rup main lene ke liye prerit kiya or usne vishvavidhyalay kaary ke baad chah saal ek paraamarsh jasoos ke rup main bitaye, jab tak ki vittiya kathinaaiyon ne use watasan ko apane kamare ke sangi ke rup main lene ke liye vivash na kar diya, jis bindu par kahaniyon kaa varnan shuru hota he
 Since 1881, the description is that 221B Baker Street, London, was the home of Holmes from where he runs his own private detective agency
 221B satraa kadam upar ek flats he jise ek puraani pandulipi main sadak kaa "upree chor" kaha gaya he
 By the time Dr
 Watson arrived, Holmes worked alone, rarely employing agents from a small section of the city, with a large number of informants and a group of market children whom he called the Baker Street Irregulars
 irregulars teen kahaniyon main dikhaai dete hai, "da sin of da four", "a study in skarlet" or "da adventure of da crucked main"
 Holmes's family is rarely described
 kahaniyon main uske mata-pita kii charchaa nahin he or vah keval itnaa kahata he ki uske purvaj "gramin sardaar" the
 In "the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", Holmes claims that his great-uncle was the French artist Vernet
 uskaa ek bada bhai he, microft, ek sarkari adhikari, jo teen kahaniyon main prakat hota he; kai anya kahaniyon main uskaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Mycroft has a unique position in the administrative service as an on-the-go database of all aspects of memory or government policies
 bataaya gaya he ki avlokan or anumiti ke maamle main microft kii kshamta sherl se kahin zyaada he
 However, he lacks the energy and passion of Sherlock and loves to spend his leisurely time at the Diogenes Club, which has been called "a club of London's most non-sociable people"
 homes ke anya bhai-bahan hai yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 In "the Adventure of the Copper Beaches", Holmes says, "I confess that this is not the situation in which i would like to see my sister", which makes some people anticipate her existence
 lekin aisa vah ek maamle main ek mahila ko, apni bahan jaisi maan kar chetavanee dene ke liye kahata he, isliye yah keval ek alankarik bhashaa ho sakati he
 Holmes shares most of his business time with his good friend and chronological recorder, Watson, who lived with Holmes briefly before his marriage in 1887 and again after his wife's death; Her house, her landlady, is maintained by Mrs
 Hudson
 homes ke jivan main watasan kii do bhoomikaayen hai
 First, he gives practical help in conducting his affairs; He is the right-hand man of the detective, who works in various forms of investigator, bluffer, associate and messenger
 duusari, vah homes kaa itihaaskaar he 
 homes kii zyaadaatar kahaniyaan ghatnatmak kathan hai, jo jasoos ke sarvaadhik dilachasp maamalon ke saransh ke rup main watasan ke drushtikon se likhi gai hai
 Holmes has often been referred to Watson's writings as sensational and populist, suggesting that the articles do not present unbiased and accurate reports of pure calculative "science" of his art
 phir bhi, watasan ke saath homes kii dosti nihsandeh uskaa sabase mahatvapurn rishta he
 In many stories, Holmes' affection for Watson — often hidden behind his cold, intellectual outward appearance — is exposed
 "da adventure of da thri garidebs main, ek khalanaayak ke saath takaraav main watasan ghayal ho jaataa he; haalanki goli kaa ghaav "bahut satahi" siddh hota he, watasan homes kii pratikriya se aahlaadit ho jaataa he: In total, Holmes has been described as working actively for twenty-three years, during which Watson wrote seventeen of his cases
 homes 1903-04 main ritair hokar sasex douns ke ek madhumakhi farm main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah madhumakhi paalan ke shauk ko apane praathmik vyavsaay ke rup main letaa he or antat "practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen" pesh karata he
 Only one case, described by Holmes himself and which he was investigating as an amateur, occurs during the detective's retirement
 homes ne aadaton or jivan-style ke maamle main khud ko "fakkad" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 According to Watson, Holmes is an eccentric who has no connection with contemporary standards of cleanliness or orderliness
 ek praarambhik kahani main, watasan, homes kaa is prakaar varnan karata he: What others find to be chaos is what Holmes sees as a repository of useful information
 kahaniyon main homes, betaratib kaagazaat or kalakritiyon ke apane bikhare jaal main dubkee laga kar bilkul vishisht dastauez yaa anya koi vastu jisaki use talash he, khoj nikaalata he
 In terms of personal hygiene, by contrast, Holmes is described in "the Hound of the Baskervilles" as a "cat-like" lover of personal cleanliness
 kisi bhi rup main yah uske peshey ke nitant vyaavhaarik anugaman main baadha utpann karata hua prathit nahin hota, tathaapi; homes kii pehali kahani,"a study in skarlet" main uske haath acid ke daag se gande ho gaye hai, jabaki baad main homes apane hi khun kii buundon kaa upyog rasinic prayog ke liye karata he
 Watson often marks Holmes's uncertain eating habits
 gahan bauddhik gatividhi ke samay jasoos dwaara aksar khud ko bhookha rakhane kaa varnan he, jaisaa ki da adventure of da norwood builder" ke dauraan, jahaan watasan ke anusaar: Holmes's historian does not mind his habit of using pipes, or his relatively little use of cigarettes and cigars
 Nor does Watson condemn Holmes's readiness to turn a truth or break a law where he believes Is that it is morally justified
 homes ko ek deshbhakt ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jo kai kahaniyon main rashtriya suraksha ke maamalon main sarkaar kii taraf se kaam kar rahaa he
 He also serves as a counter-intelligence in His Last Bow which is located at the beginning of WWI
 shooting abhyaas ke rup main, jasoos ne apane baker street thikaane kii diwaar ko apni pistaul kii goliyon se banaae "VR" ke nishaan se sajaayaa he
 Holmes's pride sometimes takes the form of pride; Although with justification; He enjoys pleasing police inspectors with his excellent conclusions
 use prasiddhi kii ichha nahin he or vah aam taur par apane kaary ke liye police ko saarvajanik rup se shrey lene kii anumati dekar santusht rahata he
 It is often that when Watson publishes his stories, Holmes's role in the case becomes clear
 homes ke aacharan ko tatasth or thanda prastut kiya gaya he
 Yet in the midst of an adventure, with remarkable passion, Holmes can show the sparkle
 uski pravriti main pradarshnakarita he or ek apradhi ko pakadaney or uski kalai kholane ke liye vah vyapak jaal taiyaar karata he, aksar watasan yaa scotland yard nirikshakon main se ek ko prabhavit karne ke liye
 Holmes occasionally uses drugs, especially when there is a shortage of excitatory cases
 vah cocaine kaa aadi he, jise ek saat pratishat ke ghol main ek vishesh sui ke prayog se jise vah ek chamade ke khol main rakhata he, chubhota he
 Holmes also uses opium occasionally, but expresses his disapproval when he visits an opium base
 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main sabhi teen, england main jaays the
 By showing no medical objection to Holmes' drug use, Dr
 Watson depicts the Victorian medical fanatic
 naitik rup se, vah apane dost kii aadat kii, ise jasoos kii "ekmaatr buraai" bataate hue ninda karte hai or homes ke maansik swasthya or utkrisht buddhi par iske sambhavit asar ko lekar chintaa vyakt karte hai
 In later narratives, Watson claims to have removed Holmes from drugs
 phir bhi, uske chikitsak mitra ke anusaar, homes ek nashedi bana rahata he jisaki aadat "mari nahin, balkee keval so rahi thi
 " haalanki shuru main use 221B baker street main apane aaramdaayak nivas ke kiraye ko saajha karne ke liye watasan kii jarurat rahati he, "da adventure of da daaing detective" main watasan khulaasa karte hai, jab homes akelaa rahata tha tab "mujhe koi andeh nahin he ki ghar ko shaayad us keemat par kharida gaya hoga jo homes apane kamare ke liye bhugtan karata he," yah ingit karte hue ki usne apane vyavhaar se ek acchhee aay utpann kii, haalanki yah thik se kabhi nahin pataa chalaa ki vah apni sevaaon ke liye kitna shulk letaa he
 He says in "the Problem of Thor Bridge" that "my professional fee is at a certain level
 main unhen badalata nahin hum, sirf jab main unhen puri tarah maaf kar detaa hum 


 " This is stated in a context when a customer offered him twice his fee; However, it is possible that wealthy clients provide Holmes with much higher remuneration than his standard fee: In "the Adventure of the Final Problem", Holmes states that the government of France and the royal residence of Scandinavia gave him sufficient money for his services
 So that he can retire comfortably, while Watson in "the Adventure of Black Peter" indicates that Holmes refuses to help the rich and powerful He would have paid taxes if he did not like their case, whereas he devoted a whole week's time to the affairs of highly polite customers
 "a cese of aaidentity" main homes, watasan ko yah bhi bataata he ki "a scandle in bohemia" ke baad, bohemia ke raja ne use ek sunaharaa sunghni dibba diya or dach shahi parivaar se use ek shandaar anguthi mili; "da adventure of da bruce- partington plance" main homes ko ek panna nirmit taai-pin maharani victoria se praapt hota he
 Other mementoes of Holmes' cases are a gold guinea from Irene Adler and a signed thank-you letter from the President of France and the Legion of Honor The Adventure of the Golden pins-nez "the Adventure of the" for capturing an assassin named Huert "holmes rubs his hands with glee" at the Primary School when the Duke of Holderness writes to Zodiac, which also surprises Watson and then Che
 The pats, saying that "I am a poor man," an event that could be dismissed as a tendency toward ironic humor that Holmes
 nishchit rup se, apane karier ke dauraan homes ne sabase shaktishaalee raajaaon or europe kii sarkaron or vibhinn amir kulinon or udyogpatiyon donon ke liye kaam kiya or garib sahukaaron or samaaj ke nichle paaydaan kii vinamr adhyapikaon dwaara salaah ke liye bhi usase sampark kiya gaya
 Holmes, for his expenses, charges money from customers and can claim any reward offered to solve the problem: he says in "the Adventure of the Speckled Band" that Miss Stoner could pay the expenses she incurred
 And requests that "the red-headed League" bank compensate for the expenses incurred on the case
 "holmes has his wealthy banker client to pay the costs incurred in retrieving the stolen gems in The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and he also claims the reward that banker announced for the finder Was
 homes ko prabhavit karne vaali ekmaatr mahila thi ireni edler, jo homes dwaara hameshaa "vah aurat" ke rup main sambodhit kii gai
 Holmes himself is not quoted using the term directly — even though he takes his real name several times in other cases
 edler un chand mahilaon main se ek he jo homes kii tamaam kahaniyon main uddhrut kii gayi hai, haalanki vah vastav main keval ek hi kahani, "a scandle in bohemia" main vyaktigat rup se upasthit hoti he
 In one story, "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton" becomes Holmes' match for the wedding, but only with the desire to gather information for his case
 He shows a clear interest in the way a lot of attractive female clients get in the way
 ,
 Holmes essentially "showed no further interest in her client when she moved out of the center of one of her problems
" " homes ne unke yauvan, saundarya or urja ko kisi bhi romani hit se alag, anupranit karne vaala paaya
 Such episodes reflect Holmes' fascination, yet there is no sign of any serious or long-term attachment, except in the case of Adler
 watasan ne likhaa he ki homes ko "mahilaon se ghrinaa" he lekin " saath anugrah paane kaa ek vicitra tarika he" homes kahata he,"main stri jati kaa purna man se prashansak nahin hum"; vastav main vah paata he "mahilaon kii manshaa

 " mahilaon ke saath homes ke sambandh kaa ek or dilachasp pahalu yah he ki unki sangat se use jo anand praapt hota he uskaa strot unke dwaara laai gai samasyaayein hai
 In Sign of the Four, Watson cites Holmes as "a human being, a calculating machine," and Holmes is quoted as saying, "it is most important, to make his decisions by personal qualities Should not be allowed to be prejudiced
 a client is just one unit for me - a factor in the problem
 Emotional qualities are opposed to clear logic
 main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki aaj tak jis aurat ko sabase aakarshak aurat maine paaya use beemaa ke paise ke liye teen chote bacchon ko jehar dene ke jurm main faansee par lataka diya gaya
 

 "it refers to Holmes' reluctance to make connections with women in general and with the client in particular, as Watson said" Sometimes you see a positive inhumanity in you
 " "da adventure of da davills foot" ke ant main homes kahata he:"maine kabhi pyaar nahin kiya watasan, par agar main karata or yadi us aurat kaa jise main pyaar karata, uskaa ant aisa hota, to shaayad main apane swechhachari sher ke shikari kii tarah vyavhaar karata

" da sin of da four main ek baar phir watasan, homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut karata he,"main unhen bahut zyada nahin bataaungaa

" watasan likhata he ki jab ki vah unhen naapsand or un par avishvaas karata he, phir bhi vah ek "udaar virdohi" he
 Holmes's primary intellectual investigative method is the permissible logic of solving a crime "with a drop of water", he writes, "that a logical person can guess the probability of the Atlantic or Niagara without seeing one or hearing the other
" Holmes's stories often begin with a display of the courageous talent of his "permissiveness"
 yah tarkikon or tark main ruchi rakhane waalon ke liye thodaa ruchikar he ki ve vishleshan karne kaa prayaas karen ki apni anumiti ke dauraan homes kya kar rahaa he
 Homogeneous permission appears to be constructed from conclusions that are primarily based on either straightforward, plausible principles that are the result of cautious inductive studies such as Holmes's study of various types of cigar ashes or the best explanation Is the conclusion
 homes ke sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton kaa swarup aam taur par,"agar 'p', to 'q', hota he jahaan 'p' drishyman saboot he or 'q' vah he jo saboot ingit karata he
 But there are intermediate principles as well, as can be seen in the following example
 "a scandle in bohemia" main homes anumiti karata he ki watasan haal hi main bahut bhigaa hua tha or uski "jo naukaraani ladki thi vah bahut hi foohad or laaparvaah thi"
jab vismit hokar watasan poochta he ki homes yah baat kaise jaanata he to homes jawaab detaa he: In this case, Holmes used several associated theories: spasht dhang se aise siddhant lagu karke homes yah anumaan lagane main sakasham he ki: "the edges of Watson's shoes are strewn with parallel erosion"; From "watson's maid is clumsy and careless"; And "watson has been very wet lately and went out in dirty weather
 " Permissive arguments enable Holmes to effectively disclose a stranger's occupation, such as a retired sergeant of the Marines in a Study in Scarlett; The former carpenter of a ship in the Red-headed League who became a Mahajan; And a billiard-marker and an artillery retired NCO in The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter
 Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, Holmes is able to draw surprisingly detailed conclusions about their owners, including Watson's pocket-watch in The Sign of the Four, as well as other stories containing a cap, a pipe, And a stick
 ek baar usne dher saare saboot jamaa kiye or sambhav vyakhyaaon kii anumiti kii or ek samaadhaan prastut karne ke liye homes us ek vyakhya kii taraf badhata he jo is maamle ke sabhi tathyon se mail khaati he
 As Holmes tells Watson, "when you have removed the impossible, whatever is left, however unlikely, must be true
" homes abhinay or chhadam vesh banane main gahari ruchi pradarshit karata he
 In many stories, he bears such a natural disguise to gather evidence that even Watson does not catch him, as in "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", in The Man with the Twisted Lip and a Scandal in Bohemia
 In other exploits, Holmes pretends to be injured or ill to make his case effective, or to blame those involved, such as "the Adventure of the Dying Detect The Tiv "
 pistaul homes or watasan apane saath pistaul rakhte hai; watasan ke maamle main aksar uski puraani sarvice revolver
 However, Watson only discusses the use of these weapons on seven occasions
 ' chadi ek sajjan vyakti ke rup main homes, aksar ek lakdi yaa chadi lekar chalata he
 He is described by Watson as an expert in wooden swords and twice uses his wand as a weapon
 talwaar a study in skarlet main watasan homes ko talwarbazi main visheshgy varnit karata he-yadhyapi kisi bhi kahani main homes ne talwaar kaa prayog nahin kiya he
 It is discussed in "gloria Scott" that Holmes practiced the sword
 chaabuk kai kahaniyon main homes ek chaabuk se las dikhataa he
 He uses it in The Adventure of the Speckled Band to kill a poisonous snake and comes close to killing a thug in a Case of Identity
 "da red-heded lig" main ek "chaabuk" ke prayog se homes, jon clay ke haathon se ek pistaul gira detaa he
 Boxing Holmes is described as a formidable fighter with bare fingers
 da sin of da four main, homes apana parichay ek peshewar mukkebaaz ko is rup main detaa he: On several occasions in the stories, Holmes became embroiled in a clandestine battle with his emerging rivals, where he was essentially the winner
 In "gloria Scott" it is reiterated that Holmes is trained as a boxer
 marshall art da adventure of da empti house main homes watasan ko bataata he ki marshall art kaa istemaal karke kaise usne professor moriarti ko kaabo main kiya or apane virdohi ko rhishenbakh jalprapaat par aisa pataka ki uski mrityu ho gai
 He states that "however, i have some knowledge, of the Japanese system of baritsu, ka or wrestling, which has proved very useful to me at times
 " "baritsu" naam, vaastavik-jivan ke marshall art bartitsu ke liye ek sandarbh prathit hota he
 In the very first story a Study in Scarlet, something about Holmes's background is given
 1881 ke purvardh main, use rasayan vigyaan ke ek swatantra chaatr ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he jisaki kai vividh jigyaasu ruchiyan hai, jisamen se lagbhag sabhi ekanishtha hokar use aparaadhon ko sulajhane main behatar banane ke rup main prakat huin
 ek shuruuaati kahani, "da adventure of da "gloria scot"", iske liye adhik prishthbhumi prastut karti he ki homes ko jasoos banane ke liye kisne prabhavit kiya: college ke ek dost ke pita ne uske anumiti kaushal kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
homes vaigyanik tareeke kaa kadai se paalan karata he or tarkon or prekshan or anumiti kii shakti par jor detaa he
 In a Study in Scarlett, Holmes claims that he does not know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, since such information is irrelevant to his work
 pratyaksh rup se watasan se yah tathy sunne ke baad, vah kahata he ki vah turant use bhuulane kii koshish karegaa
 vah kahata he ki uskaa maananaa he ki jaankaree ko sangrahit karne ke liye mastishk kii ek simit kshamta he or isliye nirarthak baaten seekhney se uski upyogi chijen seekhney kii kshamta keval kam hi hogi
dow watasan baad main homes kii kshamta kaa akalan is prakaar karata he: Even at the end of a Study in Scarlet, it is shown that Holmes knows Latin and that there is no need for translation of the original Roman proverbs, although the direct utility of language knowledge for espionage work is doubtful
 baad kii kathaayen bhi suchi kaa khandan karti hai
 Despite the possible ignorance of Holmes's politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately realizes the true identity of the so-called "count von Krum"
 gaiyr-sansanikhej sahitya ke sambandh main, uskaa bhaashan bible, shakespeare, yahaan tak ki goethe ke sandarbhon se paripurna he
 In addition, in The Adventure of the bruce-partington Plans, Watson informs that in November 1895, "holmes immerses himself in a monopoly he took from the Polyteous Mottes of Lasas" - a highly esoteric field, for which Holmes Will have to unravel his memory with a vast store of information, which has nothing to do with the fight of crime - such a broad knowledge that his disobedience has to be Year is considered "final word" on
 baad kii kathaayen is dharna kaa khandan karatin hai ki homes tab tak kuch jaanane kaa icchhuk nahin he jab tak ki vah uske vyavsaay ke liye avilamb praasangik naa ho; da vaili of fier ke duusare adhyay main, homes to balki ghoshnaa kar detaa he ki "sabhi gyaan jasoos ke liye upyogi hota he" or da adventure of da loyns main ke ant main vah apane aap ko "vicitra dharnashakti vaali smriti kaa ek sarv-vishay pathak" ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 " homes ek sakasham kuta visheshgy bhi he
 He addresses Watson, "I am quite familiar with all forms of code writing, and i am the author of a trivial discourse on the subject, in which i am analyzing a hundred and sixty different words
" One such scheme is solved in The Adventure of the Dancing Men using frequency analysis
 bhautik saboot kaa homes kaa vishleshan vaigyanik or sateek, donon he
 His methods include the use of latent prints such as footprints and hoof prints and cycle tracks to identify action at a crime scene, use of tobacco ashes and cigarette turrets to identify criminals, expose a fraud
 To compare type letters, use gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ", compare bullets obtained from two crime sites and Even the earliest use of fingerprints
 In a Scandal in Bohemia, Holmes also demonstrates his knowledge of psychology, where he lures Irene Adler into cheating him about the picture hiding, which rests on this "premise" That an unmarried woman would want her most precious thing in the event of a fire while a married woman would scramble towards her child
 In the first story, a Study in Scarlet, apane jivan kii uttejnaa ke baavjood homes sevanivrutt hokar madhumakhi paalan karne sasex downs chale jate hai or is vishay par ek pustak likhte hai,"practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen

 Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original novel Detective, his name has become a quote
 uski kahaniyon main kai jasusi kahani alankaar shaamil hai jaise, vafaadaar lekin kam budhimaan sahaayak, ek bhoomika jiske liye dow watasan adarsh ban gaya he
 Sherlock Holmes has sometimes been used in scientific literature
 redford uski prabuddhata par vichaar karte hai
 Using Conan Doyle's stories as data, Redford estimates Sherlock Holmes' IQ in three different ways and concludes that his intelligence is indeed very high
 snidar 19veen sadi ke madhya or uttarardh ke vigyaan or aparaadhashastra ke prakaash main homes ke tareekon kii jaanch karte hai
 Kempster compares the neuroscience skills demonstrated by Holmes

 They throw light on aspects of Doyle's books that are currently favorable about expertise, aspects that are inconceivable and aspects that suggest further research

 Early scholars of this law include Ronald Knox of Britain and Christopher Morley of New York
 shradhanjali swaroop, kam athwa adhik maatra main lekhakon ne sherl homes, conan doyal, yaa kahaniyon ke paatro se kai pop samskruti sandarbh nirmit kiye hai
 Such cues serve to develop a plot, increase the intellectual level of the part or treat it as an Easter egg for an observant audience
 kuch to mukhar rahe hai jinhone homes ko ek naveen setting main ek charitra ke rup main prastut kiya, yaa thodaa adhik sookshm sanket, jaise kii ek apartment sankhya 221B main rahete hue ek taarkik charitra kaa nirmaan

D

 The simplest reference is often to give anyone who does any kind of espionage work, wearing a hunting hat and cloak
 Another rich area in terms of pop culture is the ancestry and descendants of Holmes, but really the writer's imagination is the only limit

 Holmes's fan period from 1891 to 1894 — the time between Holmes's disappearance and possible death in The Adventure of the Final Problem and then the reappearance in "the Adventure of the Adventure of the Empty House—" "as mentioned
 haalanki yah ullekhneey he, ki baad main ek kahani ke 1892 main ghatit hone kaa varnan he
 Conan Doyle wrote the first set of stories over the course of a decade
 Desiring to devote more time to his historical novels, he killed Holmes in "the Final Problem", which was published in 1893
 Facing eight years of public pressure After doing so, the author wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, published in 1901, vaguely establishing it before Holmes' "death"
 Although the public was pleased with the story, she was not satisfied with a posthumous Holmes and so Conan Doyle revived Holmes after two years

 Some authors have given other explanations for the interval
 meyer ke upanyaas da seven-par-saint salution main, antaraal ko gupt vishram diwas ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he jab homes sigmund frid ke haathon se cocaine kii lat kaa ilaaj karwaata he or homes ko prasannchit suzav dete hue prastut kiya he ki watasan yah daawa karte hue ki vah moriarti dwaara maaraa gaya he, ek kaalpanik vivaran prastut karenge or logon ke bare main yah kahenge ki,"ve kisi bhi haalat main tumhaara kabhi vishwaas nahin karenge
" In his memoirs Conan Doyle quotes a reader who declared the earlier stories to be superior to the latter, for the reason that Holmes may have been killed when he went to the Raishenbach falls, rather than ever before
 Not the same
 Holmes's differences between pre and post-interval rather actually led to speculation among those who played "the Great Game"
 In more fictional theories, Mark Bourne's story "the Case of the Detectives Smile" was published in the poetry compilation Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, which estimates that one of the places Holmes visited during his hiatus was Alice's Wonderland
 While living there, he solved a case of stolen samosas and his experiences there contributed to the extermination of his cocaine addiction

 See an example of upma-ornamentation - After dasharatha-maran, when Bharat enters the palace, he finds mothers like trees with no trees

 In Hindi, he was the first to discuss various parts of poetry in the classical method

 Surah Mohsin has translated this sura into English: al-iftiyaarishwar ke naam par, jo dayavan he:- When Jannat breaks into pieces; When stars fall apart and disintegrate; And when the seas burst forth; And when the graves are overturned, the inner ones come out; Then a person comes to know what has been sent with him and what is left behind, o man! What is it that has made you careless to that generous God of yours? Who saved you, gave you this perfect figure and gave you your authorized share; In whatever form He willed, He put you together
 Nay! But you deny the ad-din
 But verily, over you to watch you, Kirâman Kâtibîn writing down, They know all that you do
 Verily, the Abrâr will be in Delight ; And verily, the Fujjâr will be in the blazing Fire, Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense, And they will not be absent therefrom
 And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? the Day when no person shall have power anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be with Allâh

 dashakumarcharit, dandi dwaara pranit sanskrit gadhykavy he
 It is named "daskumarcharit" due to the characterization of Das Kumaras in it
 dandi dwaara rachit "avantisundari katha" naamak gadhykavy kii khoj se dashakumarcharit kii samasya or bhi jatil ban gai he
 These options are present whether Dashakumarcharit and Avantisundari Katha's author Dandi are the same or different; And if the authors of these two are considered to be the same sentence, then are these two prose complement each other or are two independent prose
 kuch vidvan is paksh main hai ki avantisundari katha hi mul dashakumarcharit kaa khoyaa hua bhaag he or donon milakar ek hi gadhykavy hai
 The second class of scholars do not agree with this idea at all
 dashakumarcharit ke hastlikhit tathaa prakashit sanskarnon main praaia: teen bhaag hai- Out of these, only the middle part of the book, which is divided into eight incantations, is considered to be the original work of Dandi, but because it contains an incomparable story of Rajavahana and stories of seven friends, it is incompatible
 shesh bhaag arthath purvapithika or uttarpithika anya lekhakon kii rachanaayen hai jo kalantar main mul granth ke aadi or ant main kramash: jod di gai he
 Scholars believe that Dandi must have composed the complete text first, but later that part was destroyed due to reason

 He has exhibited life-portraits of Marichi Rishi, Ganika Kammanjari, and Dhatri Shringalika and officer Kantak of soldiers
 kavi dwaara prastut manoranjan sthitiyon main hasya evam vyangy abhivyaapt hai
 Undoubtedly, Dandi has authority over language, but he does not exaggerately describe things and by subtly displaying the maturity of his poetry, he impresses on the reader's heart
 sanskrit aalochak unke utkrisht shabd soundarya kii saraahna karte hai
 This famous utterance is popular among scholars, 'dandin: Padalityam' and its Dandi officer
 anupras ke lalit prayog se dandi manoranjak dhwani prabhaav utpann karte hai

 The Manish style used in fiction and novels reflects this
 bhashaa kii sarasata, madhurata or sahaj sundarata neeras main bhi sarasata kaa abhas kar detii he
 In the description of Raja Rajhans and his wife Basumati, Padalithaya and Madhurya are visible: balykaal sthulata ek aisi sthiti he jisamen sharir main upasthit atirikt vasa bachche ke swasthya ko nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit karti he

 is adhyayan main paaya gaya niyantrit samooh kii tulana main aahaar paraamarsh shaareerik vasa kii pratishtata ko kam karne main zyada kargar sabit nahin hua

 The earliest written record of the sign language was BC The fifth century is seen in Plato's Cratylus, where Socrates says: "if we do not have voice or speech and wish to express thoughts to one another, are we prompted by the operation of the rest of our hands, head and body parts? Try not to, as silent people do at the moment? " Deaf people seem to have used sign languages throughout history

 In 1620, Juan Pablo Bonnet published the Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos in Madrid
 It is considered to be the first modern treatise of phonology and logopedia, which established a method of oral education to deaf people by the use of manual gestures, such as the handwritten alphabet, to improve the communication of mute or deaf people

 Just as geographic or cultural forces separate populations and form different and distinct oral languages, the same forces operate sign languages as well and so they establish their identity over time in almost the same areas as local oral languages
 Tend to keep

 Sign languages are not mime - in other words, gestures are traditional, often random and not necessarily having visual connection to their context, just as verbal languages are not imitative
 jabaki maukhik bhashaa kii tulana main sanket bhashaaon main drishyaatmakataa adhik vyavasthit or vyapak he, tathaapi antar spasht nahin he
 Nor are they a visual representation of oral language

 Like oral languages, sign languages organize primary, meaningless units into meaningful semantic units
 sanket ke tatv hai haath kaa aakaar, digvinyas, sthaan, gati or bina hastchaalan ke ankak ), jise parivarni shabd HOLME ke rup main sarabaddh kiya gaya he
 The common linguistic features of the Deaf sign language are the widespread use of classes, high volume phonation and subject note syntax
 Several unique features emerge from the sign language's ability to produce meaning in different parts of the visual field simultaneously
 udhaaharan ke liye, sankethik sandesh ke praptakarta haath, chehre kaa haav-bhav or shaareerik mudra ke ek hi kshan main sanchaalan se arth pard sakate hai
 This is in contrast to oral languages, where the sounds that compose the word are mostly sequential
 ek aam galat dharna he ki sankethik bhashaaen kisi na kisi rup main maukhik bhashaaon par nirbhar hai, arthath, ve maukhik bhashaa ko haav-bhav main vyakt karti he, yaa inkaa avishkaar un logon dwaara kiya gaya, jo sun sakate hai
 Teachers with hearing power from deaf schools such as Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language
 sanket bhashaaon main hastchalit varnmaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, adhikanshtah vyaktivaachak sangya or maukhik bhashaaon se liye gaye takneekee yaa vishisht shabdaawalee ke liye

 Finger spelling can sometimes be the source of new markings, which are called literal signs
 samagratah badhir sankethik bhashaaen maukhik bhashaaon se swantantr hai or vikaas ke liye ve swayan apane maarg kaa anusaran karti hai
 For example, the British sign language and the US sign language are very different and mutually ambiguous, while people with hearing power in the UK and the US use the same oral language
 isi prakaar, jin deshon main sarvatra ek hi maukhik bhashaa kaa prayog hota he, vahaan do yaa adhik sanket bhashaaen ho sakati hai; jabaki aise kshetra main, jahaan ek se adhik maukhik bhashaaen hon, ve sambhawatah keval ek hi sankethik bhashaa kaa prayog kar sakati hai
 South Africa, where 11 oral official languages and a similar number of other widely used oral languages exist, is a good example of this
 desh ke vibhinn bhugolic kshetron ko seva pradaan karne vaale badhiron ke do pramukh shikshan sansthaanon ke uske itihaas ke kaaran vahaan keval ek sankethik bhashaa prachlan main he
 In 1972, Ursula Bellugi, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychiatrist, asked several people in English and American sign language to tell a story in English and then convert to ASL or vice versa
 Results found an average of 4
7 words per second and 2
3 signals per second
 haalanki, kahani ke liye keval 122 sanketon kii aavashyaktaa thi, jabaki 210 shabdon kii zarurat thi; at: donon prakaar se kahani ko sunaane main baraabar samay laga
 Ursula then tested to see if any important information was missed in the ASL
 ek dwibhashi vyakti ko ASL main ek kahani anuwaad ke liye di gai
 Another bilingual signer, who could only see the prompt, then translated that story back into English: the information communicated in the sign language was the same as the original story
 is adhyayan kaa dayera haalanki simit he, par isse pataa chalata he ki maukhik angrezi kii tulana main ASL sanketon main jaankaree adhik he: maukhik angrezi ke 1

 Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium
 maukhik bhashaa sidhi hoti he; ek samay main keval ek hi dhwani utpann yaa praapt kii ja sakati he
 On the other hand, sign language is visual; So, the entire scene can be viewed at once
 jaankaree ko ek saath kai channelon main lod or vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 As an example, a phrase in English can be said, "I got here by vehicle"
 To add travel related information to this sentence, one has to say a longer phrase or add another sentence that says "I got here by a winding road" or "I got here by vehicle
 yatra badi sukhad thi
 "however, in American Sign Language, information about the shape of the road or the pleasant nature of the journey is presented at hand movements or by taking advantage of handless gestures such as physical or facial expressions, The time when the word 'journey' is being indicated can be expressed simultaneously
 isliye, jabaki angreji vaakyansh "main yahaan vaahan se aayaa or meri yatra sukhad thi" america sankethik bhashaa "main yahaan vaahan se pahunchaa" se lambii ho sakati he, donon kii lambaai ek samaan he
 In fact, in terms of syntax, ASL is closer to verbal Japanese than English
 haalanki badhir samudaayon main sanket bhashaaen maukhik bhashaaon ke saath yaa unase hat kar swaabhaavik rup se ubhari hai, ve maukhik bhashaaon se sambandhit nahin hai or unke mul main vyakaran kii alag sanrachana he
 The group of sign "languages" known as manually coded languages has been more correctly understood as symbolic methods of oral languages and therefore belong to the language family of their associated oral languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisi kai angrezi kii sankethik kutabaddh bhashaaen maujuud hai
 There has been little historical linguistic research on sign languages and there have been little attempts to determine the genetic relationship between the comparison of lexical data between sign languages and some discussion on whether certain sign languages, languages or family languages are dialects
 
 badhir vidyalayon kii sthapana, yaa rajnatik varchasv ke kaaran, pravaas ke madhyam se bhashaaen vistrut ho sakati hai
 Language contact is common, making family classification difficult — often it is not clear whether the lexical similarity is due to the reception of the word from another language, or because of the common native language
 There is interaction between sign languages, between sign language and verbal languages, and between sign languages and signaling systems used by the wider community
 ek lekhak ne anumaan lagaaya he ki edmorob sanket bhashaa kii shabdaawalee tathaa chand va dhwani sahit kshetreey vishistataaen "samgr pashchimi africa ke bazaaron main boli jane vaali sankethik vyapaar-varg kii khaas boli" se judi hai
 The only comprehensive classification in this sequence was done in 1991, aside from the general cataloging of languages
 yah vargeekaran 1989 main montrial main yojit sanket bhashaaon ke sammelan ke samay gyaat ethnolog ke 1988 sanskaran ke 69 sanket bhashaaon or sammelan ke baad lekhak dwaara jodi gai 11 or bhashaaon par aadhaarit he
 7 1 7 2 18 1 1 - 8 - - - 2 - - - 2 - - - 30 - - - 1 - - - In their classification, the authors distinguish between primary and alternative sign languages and, subclassically, languages recognized as single languages and between languages considered as unified clusters
 prototip-a shrenee kii bhashaaon main ve sabhi sankethik bhashaaen shaamil hai, jo kisi anya bhashaa se pratiyamanatah vyutpann nahin kii ja sakati hai
 prototype-r languages are those based largely on the prototype-a language by the Crober process called "motivational extension"
 BSL-, DGS-, JSL-, LSF- or lsg-vyutpann bhashaaon ke varg criolikaran or shabdic pratisthaapan kii bhashaai prakriyaaon dwaara prototip bhashaaon se vyutpann "nai bhashaaon" kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 Creolization appears to enrich the direct modulation of languages with "gestures" compared to reducing the direct formulation of languages with "verbal gestures"
 bhashaai vargeekaran shabd sanrachana par aadhaarit he or samoohak / shrinkhalabaddh, vibhaktipradhan, bahusanshlisht, sanyogi or viyogtmak jaise roopaatmak shreniyon main prabhed karata he
 Sign languages differ in syntactic classification since word order in different languages varies
 udhaaharan ke liye, OGS karta-karm-kriya he, jabaki ASL karta-karm-kriya he
 Conformity with languages spoken nearby is not impossible
 roopaatmak taur par, shabdaakaar aavashyak ghatak he
 Authentic syllogism, such as alphabetism and metamorphism, is the result of a systematic coupling of binary values of two characteristics
 brentary sankethik bhashaaon ko ekaakshari or bahurupagraamiya visheshtaon sahit ek samooh ke rup main sampreshan ke madhyam dwaara sampurna samooh ke rup main vargeekrut karte hai
 This means, many forms can be expressed through a single letter, such as the subject and verb of the verb, which determines the direction of motion of the action
 yah maukhik bhashaaon ke liye tulanaatmak utpaadan dar sunishchit karne hetu sanket bhashaaon ke liye aavashyak he, kyonki ek sanket ke utpaadan main ek shabd kehane se adhik samay lagata he-lekin vaakya dar vaakya kii tulana main, sankethik or maukhik bhashaaon kii lagbhag ekasmaan gati hoti he
 Sign language is different from oral language in terms of writing
 maukhik bhashaaon kii dhvanigramic pranaliyaan mukhyatah anukramik hai: arthath adhikansh dhvanigram ek ke baad ek aanukramik rup se utpann kiye jate hai, haalanki kai bhashaaon main swar jaise kramarahit pahalu bhi hai
 As a result, traditional phonographic writing systems are also sequential, where perfect phonetics for random aspects such as force and tone are present
 sankethik bhashaaon main ucch kramarahit ghatak hai, jahaan kai "dhvanigram" ek saath utpann kiye jate hai
 For example, signs may include fingers, hands and a constantly moving face, or two hands moving in two different directions
 paramparaagat lekhan pranaaliyon ko is str kii jatilta se nipatane ke liye pariklpit nahin kiya gaya he
 Partly for this reason, sign languages are often not written
 badhiron ke liye shiksha ke achche avasar jin deshon main uplabdh hai, vahaan kai badhir sanketak apane desh kii maukhik bhashaa ko is str tak paryaapt rup se pard tathaa likh sakate hai ki unhen "kaaryaatmak sakshar" maan len
 tathaapi, kai deshon main, badhiron ke liye shiksha vyavastha kaafii karaab or / yaa bahut hi simit he
 As a result, most deaf people are very literate or lack literacy in their country's oral language
 haalanki, sanket bhashaaon ke liye lipi viksit karne ke kai prayaas kiye gaye
 Stokoe notation is the phonemes alphabet designed by William Stokoe for his 1965 Dictionary of American Sign Language
 ASL ke liye vishesh rup se nirmit, yah is rup main simit he ki isamen chehre ke haav-bhaavon ko vyakt karne kaa koi tarika nahin he
 Recent asl-phosphate is a minimal derivative of Stokoe in the shorthand sequence
 duusari ore, hamberg sanketan pranali ek vistrut dhvanyatmak pranali he jise kisi sanket pranali ke liye pariklpit nahin kiya gaya or yah praayogic lipi ke bajaay shodhakartaaon ke liye pratilekhan pranali ke rup main abhipret he
 Signwriting, a practical and by far the most popular system, can be used for any sign language and has adequate measures for handling verbal and facial expressions
 tathaapi, yah chitratmak hone or dhvanyatmak na hone ke kaaran, isamen sanketon kii pratyaksh sangatta maujuud nahin he or inhen aksar kai tareeqon se likhaa ja saktaa he
 These systems are based on pictorial symbols
 jaise ki siteriting or haimanosis aadi chitralipi main hai, jisamen stoco ankan jaisi adhik pratikatmak haath, chehre or sharir ke paramparaagat chitra hai
 Stokoe used letters and Arabic numerals of the Latin alphabet to denote the shape of the hand used in fingertip, such as the closed fist as 'A', the 'B' for the flat hand and the '5' for the extended hand
 ; But non-alphabetic symbols for place and motion, such as '' for body torso, '×' for contact and '^' for upward movement
 David j
 Peterson attempted to design an ascii-friendly phonetic transcription system known as the sign language international phonetic alphabet
 sanketalekhan chitratmak hone ke kaaran, ek sanket main ek saath tatwon kaa pratinidhitiv karne main sakasham he
 On the other hand, stoco notation is sequential, with a conventional order of a symbol for the location of the sign and ultimately for operation
 haath kaa digvinyas haath kii akruti se pehle ek vaikalpik visheshak sahit suchit kiya jaataa he
 When two motions occur simultaneously, they are written on top of each other and when they are sequential, they are written one after the other
 na to stoco or naa hi haimanosis lipiyaan chehre kaa haav-bhav yaa bina hastchaalan kii gatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye pariklpit hai, jo donon hi sanketalekhan aasaani se anukulit kii ja sakati hai, haalanki ise dhire-dhire haimanosis main sudhara ja rahaa he
 However, haemnosis is a linguistic notation system rather than a practical script

 vibhinn sanghathanon ne bhi videotelifoni ke madhyam se sanketon par shodh kaa aayojan kiya he
 Currently, the rendering of signal language via video remote interpreting or video relay service is useful where one side is deaf, hearing impaired or unable to speak and the other is hearing impaired
 In the VRI, the user of the sign language and a hearing person are in one place and an interpreter in another location
 The interpreter communicates with the user of the signal language through a video telecommunication link and with the person listening through an audio link
 VRS main, sanket bhashaa kaa prayokta, dubhashiya or sun paane vaala vyakti teen alag sthanon main hote hai, is prakaar do paksh dubhashiya ke madhyam se phone par ek duusare se baat kar pate hai
 In such cases the interpretation fluency is usually between the sign language and the verbal language that is commonly used in the same country, such as French sign language for oral French, Spanish sign language for oral Spanish, British sign for oral English Language, American Sign Language for Verbal English, etc
 Multilingual sign language interpreters capable of translating between native languages are also available, but less
 In such activities, the interpreter has to put in considerable effort, as the sign language differs from the oral language used in the country due to its distinct composition and syntax being a comfortable language
 video vyakhya ke saath, sankethik bhashaa ke dubhashiye live video or audio fid sahit sudur rahete hue kaam karte hai, taaki dubhashiya badhir ko dekh sake or sun paane vaale vyakti ke saath or ulate, baatcheet kar sake
 telephone vyakhya ke samaan hi, video vyakhya aise avasaron par istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jab usee sthaan par dubhashie uplabdh naa hon
 tathaapi, video vyakhya kaa un sthitiyon main upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa he jab sabhi paksh keval telephone ke madhyam se baat kar rahi hon
 VRI or VRS vyakhya main sabhi pakshon ke paas zaruri upkaran hona aavashyak he
 Some modern devices enable interpreters to control remote video cameras, so that the camera can zoom-in and zoom-out or point at the pointing side
 kabhi-kabhi ek hi parivaar ke bheetar sanket pranaliyaan viksit hoti hai
 For example, when the children of hearing-impaired parents without sign language skills are deaf, an informal system of gestures naturally develops, provided that the parents do not suppress it
 The word used for these minor languages is Home Sign
 gharelu sanket sampreshan ke kisi anya tareeke ke abhaav ke kaaran utpann hote hai
 In a single lifetime and without the support of the community, the child naturally invents cues to meet their communication needs

 Neither type of domestic sign is recognized as an official language
 ishaara maukhik bhashaaon kaa vishesh ghatak he
 Extensive systems of manual communication have evolved in places or situations where conversation is not practical or permissible, such as monasteries in religious communities, scuba diving, television recording studios, noisy workplaces, stock markets, baseball, hunting, or sharad games
 
 In Rugby Union the referee uses limited but defined signals to convey their decisions to the audience
 haal hi main, chote bacchon ko unke dwaara bolnaa seekhney se pehle sanket bhashaa ko sikhaane or protsaahit karne kaa andolan chal padaa he, kyonki kuch bachche maukhik rup se bolnaa shuru karne se pehle hi sankethik bhashaaon ke zarie prabhavi rup se sampreshit karne main sakasham hote hai
 It is commonly known as Baby Sign

 And is considered the second most authentic hadith collection after Sahih al-bukhari
 yah muslim ebn al-hajjaj dwaara ekatra kiya gaya tha, jinhen imam muslim bhi kaha jaataa he
 Its authenticity has sometimes been questioned due to the fact that it was written 250 years after the Islamic prophet, Mohammed
 iske baavjood, sunni musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki yah vaastavik or pramanik he
 Sahih Muslim, known as Sahih with the Sahih al-bukhari
 sahih muslim ke sangrahakarta muslim ebn al-hajj kaa janm nishapur main 204 hijri main ek farsi parivaar main hua tha or 261 hijri main unki mrityu ho gai thi
 He traveled extensively to gather collections of Ahadis, including areas in Iraq, the Arabian Peninsula, Syria, and Egypt
 300,000 haddees main se unhone moolyankan kiya, kade sweekruti mandandon ke aadhaar par unke sangrah main shaamil karne ke liye lagbhag 4,000 hi nikaale gaye
 Every report in his collection was examined and the veracity of the series of mentors was firmly established
 sunni musalamaanon ko sahih al bukhari ke baad yah doosraa sabase pramanik haddees sangrah mana jaataa he
 Sahih Muslim is divided into 43 books, with a total of 9200 stories
 haalanki, yah jaananaa mahatvapurn he ki muslim ebn al-hajjaj ne kabhi bhi sabhi pramanik paramparaon ko ikattha karne kaa daawa nahin kiya kyonki unka lakshya keval paramparaon ko ikattha karnaa tha ki sabhi muslimon ko sateekta ke bare main sahamat hona chahie
 According to Munsiri, there are a total of 2,200 hadiths in Sahih Muslim
 mohammad amin ke mutabik, 1,400 pramanik haddees hai jo anya pustakon main mukhya rup se chah pramukh haddees sangrahon main dekhe jaasakate hai
 Many Muslims consider this collection to be the second most authentic of the six major hadith collections, containing only Sahih hadiths
 or is haddees ke sangrah ko sahih al bukhari ke saath saamaan mana jaataa he, donon ko do sahih kaha jaataa he
 Shia Muslims tend to dismiss some of their material as unreliable due to the dubious credibility of certain narratives
 pustak ke ucch str ke baavjood, or vidwaanon kii sarvasammati yah he ki sahih al bukhari ke baad haddees kii duusari sabase maanya vargeekrut pustak he, yah is baat par sahamat he ki iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki isamen har tatv satya he, anya haddees kii kitabon kii tulana main yah kitaab pramanik mani jaati he
 This book is primarily considered to be similar to Sahih al-bukhari, this also does not mean that Sahih al-bukhari has more authentic hadiths than Sahih al-bukhari
 ullekhneey islamic vidwaan amin ahsaan islahi ne sahih muslim kii kuch anuthi visheshtaon kaa saransh diya he: Translations of Sahih Muslim commentaries are available in several languages, including English, Urdu, Bangla, Tamil and Bosnian

 Transmission of power from the generator to the user site is called transmission
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 Public places are established, in fact, on the basis of achievement of means and economic justification
 jalavidyutgharon ko kisi vishisht sthaan par bana dene kaa prashn hi nahin uthta, kyoki unka sthaan to prakritik sadhano par nirbhar karata he jo saadharantaya ghani aabaadeewale kshetron se dur hote hai
 The installation of thermal power stations also depends on the achievement of the coal as well as the problem of transportation and its transportation
 at: bahudhaa janitrasthalon kii duuri bhaar se kai sau mile bhi ho sakati he or aisi dashaon main preshan linon dwaara shakti ko bhaar tak pahunchaana hota he
 Therefore, remittance is as much an important and important part of the power industry as is the production of power itself
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd kaa vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 The upper lines should be at least 20 feet above the ground level and no part of it should be at a lower elevation
 bhoomi se inaki oonchaai, ucch voltata kii dasha main or bhi adhik hoti he
 Therefore these lines are carried on the poles and charged on the insulators of the porcelain

 The insulators are usually mounted on the pole with scissors and are configured so that in any case the driver does not touch the swinging, the other driver, or the pole, or any of its structural components
 inaki akruti evam rachana bhi is prakaar kii hoti he ki kisi bhi paristhiti main chaalak tathaa pole ke kisi sanrachana anshak ke bich chaalak kaa sandhaaran kar saken
 Cables can be called, in fact, any insulating conductor, but the cables used for the transmission of power are mainly used underground
 at: cabilon kii rachana bhi aisi hoti he ki ve bhoomi ke andar padanevaale prabhaavon se surakshit rah saken
 Generally, the transmission cables are triangular
 at: uname kam se kam teen crode haate hai, jo alag-alag vidyut-ruddha haate hai or phir upar se bhi unpar doosraa vidyutrodhi lapet diya jaataa he
 It is insulated, usually, of diluted paper, or cotton tape, depending on the square of the working voltage of the cable

 Very high voltage transmission cables are also filled with oil
 tel, vastut:, uttam achaalak madhyam he
 But the design of such cables is quite complex and difficult to take care of
 iske kaaran inkaa upyog simit he
 The austerity of electrification depends to a large extent on the size of the conductor
 chaalak kaa aakaar mukhyat: vahan kii janevaali dhara par nirbhar karata he
 The current to be carried for a given power depends mainly on the voltage
 at: preshan ke liye ucchtam voltata prayog karnaa hi upyukt he, jisase us shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara kam ho sake or chote aakaar ke chaalak prayukt kiye ja saken
 But even the highest voltage has its limits
 36 kilometre se adhik volttaaon par chaalak kaa aakaar dhara ke pariman par hi nahin, vastut:, korana ke prabhaav par nirbhar karata he
 The corona has the effect of expelling the air around the conductor at high voltages
 iske kaaran him him kii dhwani tathaa chamak utpann hoti he or yah antat: shakti haani ke rup main prakat hoti he
 For this reason, the shape of the driver has to be designed keeping this power loss and its effects in view
 ucchtam volttaaon par preshan linon kaa sanchaar linon se vyatikaran duusari mahatvapurn samasya he
 High voltage transmitting lines cause an interference voltage in the adjacent communication lines, causing communication disturbances, but this interference can be minimized by keeping the communication lines away from the power lines, and many other treatments
 Can be done
 teesri kathinaayee ucch voltata achaalkon tathaa minaaron kii uchit sanrachana kii he, jisase doshi sthitiyaan utpann na ho saken
 At the same time their proper care also becomes a problem
 inke atirikt ucchtam volttaaon par shakti sthayitv mahatvapurn samasya he
 In long lines of very high voltages, power flow is, in effect, limited by power stability
 is kaaran nirdhaarit shakti keval kisi vishisht voltata par vishisht duuri tak hi preshit kii ja sakati he
 Also, the transmission can be the most economical at a specific voltage according to the transmitted power and distance
 ye samasyaayen badi badi yojanaon main bahut mahatvapurn hoti he or preshnatantr kaa abhikalp yojana kaa ek mukhya ang hota he
 The basis of the dispatch system is the weighting survey
 sabase pehle vibhinn sthanon main prastaavit bhaar kaa pariklan kar liya jaataa he or tab unke anusaar upakendron kii sthiti nishchit kii jaati he
 According to the load and distance, the voltage of the transmission and the number of circuits are determined and the path of the proposed lines is determined
 line abhikalp ke praroop evam abhikalp, vidyutrodhiyon kaa praroop or unako lagane kaa yantravinyas tathaa sangrakshantantr kisi bhi yojana ke liye aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system is also the most important economic aspect

 There are three main components of transmission of a specified power: power, distance and voltage
 kisi bhi preshnatantr kii yojana kaa safal abhikalp in teenon sanghatakon ke upyukt samanvay par nirbhar karata he
 Significant research is being done in the direction of line design, as a result of which the level of electrical resistance is no longer as high as it was 10 years ago
 is prakaar linon ke mulya main baari bachat sambhav ho saki he
 Very high voltages are dispatched, usually for a distance of more than 100 miles
 bahudhaa preshan ke do kramon main karnaa padataa he
 Transmission at very high voltages is usually done from the power station's sub-center to the sub-stations near the center across the utility area, from where the power tax is transmitted to the sub-station of the utility at a medium voltage
 is prakaar ise praathmik evam dwitiyak preshan ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Distributor or feeding lines are carried from the last sub-station to the load, from where individual loads are handled
 saadharantaya janit voltata ko preshan karne ke liye ati ucch volttaaon main roopatarit karnaa hota he
 Consequently, they are also important parts of the dispatch system
 inke saath hi bahut se sangrakshan yuktiyaan tathaa paripath trotak bhi tantra kaa vishisht anshak hai
 The oil circuit trot is arranged on either side of the transformer, so that the circuit on either side of the transformer can be opened
 isi prakaar kisi line athwa uske prabhag ko niskriy kar sakane kaa praavdhaan hota he, jisase dosha kii sthiti main line kii manramat kii ja sake
 In fact, conservation tips automatically open and separate the guilty division in the event of a defect
 line sangrakshan ke liye upakentre main bahut prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Common relays settled are overload relays and ground erosion relays
 atibhaar riley, atibhaar kii avasthaa main, paripath trotak kaa pravartit kar paripath ko khol dete hai or is prakaar line tathaa usase sambandhit saajasja ko atibhaar se honevaali kshati athwa hanikaarak prabhaavon se bachaate hai
 The soil erosion relays operate in a state of land degradation and connect the culprit line
 or bhi bahut se bhinn bhinn prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Many relays operate depending on the distance of the fault and many use a pilot wire, however the latest protection mechanism is the carrier protection system
 karier, vastut:, ek ucch aavriti kii tarang ko kehete hai, jo pilot taron par shakti aavriti ke saath hi adhyaropit kar di jaati he
 In the event of a fault, the relay connected to it disengages the line, acting immediately
 karier sangrakshan tantra duusare tantron kii apeksha adhik drutagami he or adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 But this can only be economically appropriate for high voltage lines
 preshan linon ke abhikalp main tadit sangrakshan kaa praavdhaan karnaa bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he
 Falling on a lightning line can destroy it and all the equipment attached to it
 isse bachaav ke liye bahut si yuktiyaan prayukt kii jaati he, jinamein mukhyat: bhoomi taar tathaa taditnirodhak kaa praavdhaan he
 The ground wire normally protects the line from the harmful effects of lightning and prevents lightning from falling as far as possible on the line
 taditnirodhak upakentre athwa ant sanrachanaon par lagaae jate hai or tadit ke line par gir jane par us sidhe hi bhooyojit kar dete hai, jisase line athwa saajasja ko kshati nahin pahunchne paati
 All the minarets are properly grounded and their earth resistance is kept very low by making various arrangements

 Remittances are often interlinked as grids, allowing the free flow of power within the grid
 aise grid ati ucch volttaaon par kaary karte hai or sampurna tantra kii voltata tathaa aavriti ek hi hoti he
 The difficulties of control are certainly increased, but the surplus power of any place in the system can be used in other places, where it is needed
 is prakaar bijligharon main atirikt sthapit shakti kaa rakhana aavashyak nahin rah jaataa
 In fact, in large grids, the power of a single power plant, or machine, is negligible compared to the power of the entire system and does not specifically affect the functioning of the entire system
 bharat main bhi aise bahut se grid hai, jaise bhakhda grid, ganga jalavidyut grid, sharada grid, di
