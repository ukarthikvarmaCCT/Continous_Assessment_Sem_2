" Venter's analysis was intended to demonstrate that the RSA series was combined with a reliable delivery system to demonstrate an eventual diplomatic appeal in a separate nuclear test with world powers, even if they intended to Can never be used together in a weaponized system

 chronic obstructive pulmonary disis, jise chronic obstructive langs disis, tathaa chronic obstructive airve disis tathaa anya bhi kaha jaataa he yah ek prakaar kaa pratirodhi fefde kaa rog kaha jaataa he jise jeern rup se kharaab vaayu pravaah se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 It usually worsens over time
 iske mukhya lakshanon main shwasan main kami, khaansee, or kaph utpaadan shaamil hai
 Most people with chronic bronchitis have COPD
 tambaakoo dhumrapaan siopidi kaa ek aam kaaran he, jisamen kai anya kaarak jaise vaayu pradooshan or anuvaanshik samaan bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Common sources of air pollution in a developing country are related to poorly ventilated cooking systems and burning fires for heat
 in pareshaani paidaa karne vaale kaarnon se deergh kaaleen anaavaran ke kaaran fefdon main sujan kii pratikriya hoti he jiske kaaran vayumarg chote ho jate hai or amphisema naamak fefdon ke utakon kii tuutfoot janm leti he
 Its diagnosis is based on poor airflow, which is calculated by lung function tests
 asthama ke vipareet, dawa die jane se vayupravah main kami mahatvapurn rup se behatar nahin hoti he
 COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to known causes
 isamen dhumrapaan kii dar ghataane ke prayaas tathaa ghar ke bheetar va baahar kii vaayu gunvattta kaa sudhaar shaamil he
 COPD treatment includes: quitting smoking, vaccination, rehabilitation and often respiratory bronchodilators and steroids
 kuch logon ko dirivadhi oxigen upachaar yaa fefdon ke pratyaropan kii jarurat padati he
 For those who have periods of severe malfunction symptoms, increased use of drugs and hospital treatment may be required
 puri duniya main siopidi 329 million logon yaa jansankhya ke lagbhag 5% logon ko prabhavit karti he
 It was ranked third among the causes of this worldwide death in 2012 as it killed 3 million people
 dhumrapaan kii adhik dar or anek deshon main jansankhya ke bujurg hone se, hone vaali mauton kii sankhya main vruddhi kaa anumaan he
 In 2010, it cost $ 2
1 trillion
 siopidi ko sabase aam lakshan kaph kaa nikalnaa, saans main kami or utpaadak khaansee hai
 These symptoms persist for long periods of time and usually worsen over time
 yah aspasht ki kya siopidi ke bhinn prakaar hote hai
 Whereas they were previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is a description of lung changes and not a disease and chronic bronchitis being the only explanation of symptoms that may or may not be present in COPD
 koi jeern khaansee utpann hone vaala pehla lakshan he
 When it has been present for more than three months in a year for two years and persists with the presence of phlegm for no other apparent reason, it is by definition a chronic bronchitis
 siopidi ke puri tarah se vikaas hone se pehle yah sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 The quantity of phlegm can vary from hours to days
 kuch maamlo main khaansee nahin bhi ho sakati he yaa keval kabhi kabhaar hoti he yaa utpaadak nahin bhi ho sakati he
 Some people suffering from COPD have symptoms of "smoker's cough"
 kaph ko niglaa yaa ugala ja saktaa he, yah saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik karkon par nirbhar karata he
 Severe cough may result in fracture of the rib or slight fainting
 siopidi se peedit logon main aksar "aam sardi" kaa asar rahata he jo lambey samay tak bana rahata he
 Shortness of breath is a symptom that often worries people
 ise aam taur par: "mujhe saans lene main koshish kerani pad rahi he," "meri saans phool rahi he," yaa "mujhen paryaapt hawa nahin mil rahi he "jaise vaakyanshon se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Although different cultures use different phrases
 aam taur par lambey samay main parishram ke baad saans kii kami mahasoos hoti he tathaa yah bitate samay ke saath kharaab hoti jaati he
 In the later stage it occurs at rest and can last forever
 siopidi se peedit logon ke liye jivan chintaa tathaa kharaab gunvattta vaala ho jaataa he
 People with more developed COPD breathing with contracted lips and this method can be helpful in reducing the problem of shortness of breath in some people
 siopidi main saans ko bheetar lene se adhik samay use baahar phenkane main lag saktaa he
 Chest tightness may occur but is not common and may also be the cause of another problem
 baadhit vaayu-pravaah vaale logon main stethoscope se seene kii jaanch karte samay kharkharahat yaa vaayu pravesh ke saath ghatati hui awaz sunai detii he
 The barrel chest / drum chest is the characteristic sign of COPD, but it is not as common by comparison
 is rog ke badtar hone par ghutane par jhukkar khadey hone vaali sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 Developed COPD can cause high pressure on the lung capillaries, which creates pressure on the right ventricle of the heart
 is paristhiti ko cor pulmonaille kehete hai or iske chalate pairon main sujan or gardan kii nason kaa ubharna jaise lakshan utpann hote hai
 COPD is a more common cause of cor pulmonal than any other lung disease
 cor pulmonaille anupoorak oxigen ke upyog ke kaaran kam aam ho gaya he
 COPD often accompanies other conditions for which shared risk factors are responsible
 in paristhitiyon main: ischemic hriday rog, ucch raktchaap, madhumeh, mansapeshiyon kii barabaadi, osteoporosis, fefde kaa cancer, chintaa vikaar or avsaad
 It is common for people with severe disease to always feel tired
 nakhunon kii clubing siopidi ke liye vishisht nahin he or iske liye fefdon ke cancer kii jaanch kii sambaavna kii jaani chahie
 Severe exacerbation of COPD can be determined by increased shortness of breath, increased phlegm production, turning phlegm green or yellow, or increased cough in a person suffering from COPD
 yah tej saans chalane, tej hriday dar, paseene, gardan kii mansapeshiyon ke sakriy upyog, twachaa main nila sa rang or uljhan ke jaise shwasan kii badi hui dar yaa gambhir phulav main aakraamak vyavhaar ke chihn ke saath upasthit ho saktaa he
 Small explosion-like sounds can be heard when tested with a stethoscope
 siopidi kaa mul kaaran tambaakoo kaa dhumrapaan he, pesheywariya anaavaran tathaa kuch deshon main gharon ke bheetar kii aag kaa pradooshan hota he
 Generally, these disclosures must be several decades before symptoms develop
 kisi vyakti kii anuvaanshik sanrachana bhi jokhim ko prabhavit karti he
 Tobacco smoking is the primary cause of COPD globally, about 20% of them will have COPD, and half of those who smoke for a lifetime will have COPD
 america va euke main siopidi se peedit 80-95% pratishat log yaa to vartmaan main dhumrapaan karte hai yaa pehle karte the
 The likelihood of developing COPD increases with total smoke exposure
 iske atirikt, purushon kii tulana main mahilaon main dhunen se prabhavit hone kii adhik sambhaavnaaen hai
 Among non-smokers, 20% of those with second-class smoking have it
 an ya prakaar ke dhuen jaise, ganja, cigar tathaa hukke se bhi jokhim rahata he
 The risk of COPD increases in children of women who smoke during pregnancy
 koyale yaa lakdi or jaanavar ke gobar jaise biomas eendhan se khaanaa pakaane vaale chulhon kii aag ke chalate hone vaala bhitari vaayu pradooshan vikasshil deshon main siopidi kaa sabase aam kaaran he
 These fires are the main means of cooking and heating for about 3 billion people, their effect is relatively greater on women exposed to them
 inako bharat, china or up sahaara africa ke 80% gharon main urja ke mukhya strot ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
 People living in big cities have higher COPD rates than rural areas
 jabaki shahari vaayu pradooshan adhik gaharaa yogadan karne vaala kaarak he, isaki siopidi ke kaaran banane kii bhoomika abhi tak aspasht he
 Areas with poor external air quality, including areas with exhaust gas, generally exhibit higher rates of COPD
 dhumrapaan kii tulana main samgr prabhaav phir bhi kam hi he
 Long-term exposure to workplace dust, chemicals, and smoke increases the risk of COPD in both smokers and non-smokers
 aisa vishwaas he ki kaarysthalon ke anaavaran 10-20% maamalon ke kaaran hai
 In the United States, the cause is responsible for more than 30% of cases of COPD in people who never smoke, and presents a greater risk in countries that are deprived of adequate regulations
 kai saare udyongon tathaa sroton ko iskaa doshi mana gaya he, jinamein koyala khanan, sone kaa khanan tathaa coton textile udyog main dhul ke ucch str tathaa cadmium or isosinats se sambandhit peshey va welding se uthne vaale dhuen shaamil hai
 Working in the agricultural sector is also risky
 kuch peshon main jokhim kii sthiti kuch aisi he ki jaise ve log aadhe se lokar do packet tak cigarette rose pi rahe hon
 Silica dust exposure may also cause COPD whose risk is unrelated to the risk for silicosis
 dhul se anaavaran tathaa cigarette ke dhumrapaan se anaavaran ke nakaaratmak prabhaav yogtmak yaa yogtmak se adhik dikhaai padate hai
 Genetics plays a role in the development of COPD
 yah tulanaatmak rup se un logon main adhik aam he jinke sambandhi dhuen se jude hai or jinako siopidi he
 The only inherited risk at the present time is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
 yah jokhim unamem adhik ucch hota he jinamein alpha 1- antitrpsin kii kami ke saath dhumrapaan kii aadat bhi ho
 It accounts for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3-4 out of every 10,000 people
 anya anuvanshik karkon kii khoj kii ja rahi he, jinke kai saare hone kii sambhaavnaaen hai
 There are also many other factors that are less closely associated with COPD
 yah jokhim uname adhik he jo garib hai, haalanki yah abhi spasht nahin he ki aisa apane aap main garibi ke kaaran he yaa garibi ke saath jude anya karkon ke saath, jaise ki vaayu pradooshan, kuposhan aadi
 There is some evidence that high responsiveness to asthma and airways increase the risk of COPD
 janm sambandhi kaarak jaise ki nimna janm vazan kii bhi bhoomika hoti he or usee tarah se echivi / aids tathaa tibi jaise kai sankramak rog
 Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least among adults
 ek gambhir tivrata aam taur par sankraman yaa paryaavarniya pradooshkon yaa kabhi kabhaar dawaaon ke anupyukt upyogon jaise duusare karkon ke kaaran shuru ho jaati he
 In 50 to 75% of cases, infection is seen, out of which 25% show bacteria, 25% virus and 25%
 paryaavarniya pradooshkon main bheerti va vahya hawaaon kii gunvattta shaamil hoti he
 Exposure to private smoking and secondary smoking increases the risk
 thande taapmaana bhi isamen bhoomika nibhaate hai, kyonki tivrata jaadon main adhik hoti he
 Persecution is also more frequent in those in whom the underlying disease is severe: 1
8 per year in mild disease, 2 to 3 per year in moderate and 3
4 per year in severe
 jinamein prakopen kai baar hota he unamem fefdon kii kaaryakshmata main kami kii dar tej hoti he
 Pulmonary emboli can make symptoms worse in people who already have POPD
 siopidi ek prakaar kaa pratirodhi fefde kaa rog he jisamen jeern apurna prativarti kharaab vaayu pravaah or puri tarah se shwaas ko baahar phenk paane main aakshamata bana rahata he
 Poor airflow is the result of rupture of lung tissue and small airway disease known as obstructive bronchitis
 in do karkon ke tulanaatmak yogadan bhinn logon ke bich bhinn ho sakate hai
 Severe damage to the airways can create large air areas known as bullies that replace lung tissue
 is prakaar ke rog ko bunayis emphisema kehete hai
 COPD develops as a chronic inflammatory response to respiratory infections
 jeern bacteria sankraman bhi is phulav charan kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 These inflamed cells include two types of white blood cells, neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages
 jo dhumrapaan karte hai unamem atirikt rup se tisi1 limphosites shaamil hote hai or siopidi sepidit kuch logon main asthma peediton ke samaan eosinephol shaamil hote hai
 Part of this cellular response is due to chemotactic factors such as inflammatory mediators
 fefdon kii kshati se judi anya prakriyaaon main tambaaku ke dhune main free radicals kii ucch matraaon dwaara paidaa tathaa bhadakaau koshikaon dwaara mukt oxidative tanaav tathaa proteis shaamil hote hai
 The connective tissues of the lungs cause emphysema which increases impaired airflow and ultimately worsens respiratory gases with absorption
 siopidi main mansapeshiyon kii hone vaali saamaanya barabaadi kaa aanshik kaaran rakt main fefdon dwaara mukt kiye gaye bhadakaau madhyasth ho sakate hai
 Airways are contracted by inflammation and damage within them
 iske kaaran puri tarah se baahar saans phekane main aakshamata paidaa hoti he
 The fastest decrease in air flow comes in exhaling because the pressure in the chest is simultaneously compressing the airways
 iske chalate pichhali saans kii kaaphi hawa fefdon main tab bani rahati he jab aglaa shwasan shuru hota he jiske parinaam swaroop kisi bhi samay fefdon main vaayu kii kul maatra bad jaati he, yah ek aisi prakriya he jise hyperinflation yaa vaayu kaa funs janaa kehete hai
 Exercise-associated hyperinflation is associated with shortness of breath in COPD because respiration is less comfortable when there is already some air in the lungs
 kuch logon main vayumarg hyper risponsiveness kii kuch maatra hoti he jo ki asthma vaale logon jaisi hoti he
 Gas exchange occurs due to low oxygen levels and ultimately high carbon dioxide levels in the blood, airway obstruction, diffuse swelling and reduced ventilation to breathe
 prakopen ke dauraan vayumarg main sujan bhi bad jaati he jiske kaaran hyperinflation badhata he, vahya shwasan vayupravah ghatata he or gas antaran kharaab hota he
 This results in insufficient ventilation and ultimately a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood
 nimna oxigen str agar lambey samay tak bane rahen to inke chalate fefdon main dhamniyon kaa sankuchan hone lagata he jabaki emphisema ke chalate fefdon main keshikaon kii tuutan ho jaati he
 Both of these changes cause increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to corpulmonal
 35 se 40 varsh kii aayu se adhik kisi bhi aise vyakti main siopidi ke nidaan par vichaar kiya janaa chahie jise saans lene main samasyaho yaa jeern khaansee ho, kaph aata ho yaa baar-baar sardi zukaam hota ho yaa rog jokhim karkon se anaavaran kaa itihaas ho
 Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis
 spirometry upasthit vayupravah kii maatra ko maapti he or aamtaur par ise, vayumarg ko kholane vaali dawa bronkodailators ke upyog ke baad kiya jaataa he
 Two main components are used for diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in a second, which is the largest amount of air exhaled in the first second of respiration, and the forced vital capacity, the air expelled through a large breath at once
 Is the largest amount of aam taur par epavisi kaa 75-80% pehle second main baahar aa jaataa he or kisi main epaivi1 / epavisi anupaat kaa 70% se kam hona usamen siopidi ke lakshanon kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Spirometry based on these measurements can lead to an over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly
 naidanik utkrushtataa kaa rashtriya santhaan maapdand ke liye epaivi 1 kaa atirikt rup se anumaan se 80% se kam hona chahie
 Evidence for the use of spirometry in symptomatic people in an attempt to diagnose the condition early is inconclusive and therefore not currently recommended

 gokul singh athwa gokula sinsini gaanv kaa sardaar tha
 On 10 May 1666, the Jats and Aurangzeb's army fought at Tilpat

 The Mughal rule promoted the religion of Islam and raised taxes on peasants
 gokula ne kisaanon ko sangathit kiya or kar jamaa karne se manaa kar diya
 Aurangzeb sent a very powerful army
 gokula ko bandi bana liya gaya or 1 janvari 1670 ko agra ke kile par janata ko aatankit karne ke liye tukde-tukade kar maaraa gaya
 The sacrifice of Gokula marked the beginning of the accounts of Mughal rule

 Some Jat leaders and zamindars of Uttar Pradesh got credit for pioneering rebellion against intolerant, religious, policy
 agra, mathura, aligarh, isamen agrani rahe
 In the last years of Shah Jahan, during the succession war, Jat leader Veer Nandram refused to pay rent in protest of the exploitative religious policy and hoisted the flag of rebellion
 Later, Uday Singh and Gokulsingh took the place of Veer Nandram
 itihaas ke is tathy ko sweekaar karnaa padegaa kii rathore vir durgadas ke pehle hi uttar pradesh ke jat veeron ko kattarpanthi mogul samraaton kii ashishnu nitiyon kaa purvabhaas ho chukaa tha
 Gokul Singh was the leader of all the Hindu masses of Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan and Hindaun and Mahavan, the fortress of Tilpat was its center
 jab koi bhi mogul senapati use parrast nahin kar sakaa to ant main samraat aurangzeb ko swayan ek vishaal sena lekar jan-aakrosh kaa daman karnaa padaa
 Today, if there is any credit to the temple of Mathura, Vrindavan and the defense of Indian culture and for turning the direction of immediate exploitation, tyranny and state arbitrariness, it is only to 'gokulsingh'
 is baat kii chetana kam hi logon ko hogi ki veeravar gokulasinh kaa balidaan, guru tegbahadur se 6 varsh purv hua tha
 In December 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was slaughtered - on the platform of the Mughal Kotwali of Delhi, where today the gurudwara stands raised with the head of Shishganj
 guru ke dwaara sheesh dene ke kaaran hi vah gurudwara sheeshganj kehalaata he
 On the other hand, when we look at the great man who was martyred 6 years before Guru Tegh Bahadur and was martyred for the same values and not on the Kotwali of Delhi, on the tall platform of Agra's Kotwali, thousands of people In front of the crowd chanting, they were brought up in iron chains and which, with great vampirism, intended to break the morale of the public, each one with axes Cut was executed, then do not we have a look
 gokulasinh sirf jaaton ke liye shahid nahin hue the na unka rajya hi kisi ne chhina liya tha, na koi pension band kardi thi, balki unke saamne to apurv shaktishaalee mogul-satta, deentapurvak, sandhi karne kii tamanna lekar gid-gidai thi
 Shame that we could not even honor such a wonderful hero on paper
 kitna ahsaan faraamosh kitna kritaghnn he hamaara hindu samaaj ! shahi itihaaskaaron ne unka ullekh tak nahin kiya
 The arrest and slaughter of Guru Teghbahadur is not mentioned in any contemporary Persian historiography
 mewar ke rana pratap se ladane akbar swayan nahin gaya tha parantu braj ke un jat yoddhaon se ladane use swayan janaa padaa tha
 However, they could not be completely suppressed and under the command of the chosen generals, the Mughal armies continued to be sent for the oppression and oppression of the Jats and not only Jat men but their heroes also faced those armies with their historical fortitude and traditional valor
 She stayed
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bharat kii in viranganaon or sachche sapooton kaa koi ullekh shahi tukdon par palane vaale tathakthith itihaaskaaron ne nahin kiya
 We get their information from the accounts of European traveler named Manuchi
 usee ke shabdon main ek anokhaa chitra dekhiye, jo anya kisi desh yaa jati ke itihaas main durlabh he: Sir Yadunath Sarkar writes - “as a result of the religious policy of Muslims, there has always been a special blow to the holy land of Mathura
 dilli se agra jane vaale rajmarg par sthit hone ke kaaran, mathura kii ore sadaiv vishesh dhyaan aakarshith hota rahaa he
 To suppress the Hindus there, Aurangzeb appointed a staunch Muslim named Abdunnavi as the Faujdar of Mathura
 san 1678 ke prarambh main abdunnavi ke sainikon kaa ek dasta mathura janapad main chaaron ore lagaan vasuuli karne niklaa
 abdunnavi ne pichley hi varsh, gokulasinh ke paas ek nai chhavnee sthapit kii thi
 This was the sad point of all action
 gokulasinh ke aahvaan par kisaanon ne lagaan dene se inkaar kar diya
 mogul sainikon ne luutmaar se lekar kisaanon ke dhor-dangar tak kholane shuru kar die
 bas sangharsh shuru ho gaya
 Then Aurangzeb's new decree came 9 April 1669 - "madrasas and temples of infidels be dropped"
 As a result, many ancient temples and monasteries of the Braj region were destroyed
 kushaan or gupt kaaleen nidhi, itihaas kii amuly dharohar, tod-phod, mund viheen, ang viheen kar hajaaron kii sankhya main sarvatra chhitara di gayi
 Mughalia horsemen and vulture eagles were seen flying throughout the Brajmandal
 or dikhaai dete the dhune ke badal or laplapaati jwalaayen- unamem se nikalate hue saahi ghudsavaar
 The month of May has come and the end of the tyrannical military has also arrived Abdunnavi besieged a village called Sihora
 Gokulsingh was also nearby
 abdunnavi ke saamne ja pahunche
 The Mughals were killed two-way
 The soldier was killed by a bullet
 bache khuche mogul bhaag gaye
 Gokulsingh went ahead and looted the cantonment of Sadabad and set it on fire
 iskaa dhuaan or lapten itani unchi uth gayi ki agra or dilli ke mehalon main jhat se dikhaai de gayi
 Why do they not even appear The nomination of the cantonment of the empire's Wazir Sadulla Khan was erased
 mathura hi nahi, agra jile main se bhi shahi jhande ke nishaan udakar agra shahar or kile main dher ho gaye the
 Life was communicated among the frustrated and dead Hindus
 unhen dikhaai diya ki aparaajay mogul-shakti ke vish-danta tode ja sakate hai
 He appeared to be the keeper of his future hopes - a restorer Gokulsingh
 iske baad paanch maah tak bhayankar yuddh hote rahe
 All the preparations of the Mughals and the chosen generals proved to be ineffective and unsuccessful
 What soldiers and what commander sat above all Gokul Singh's valor and terror of conducting war
 ant main sitambar maas main, bilkul niraash hokar, shaf shikan khan ne gokulasinh ke paas sandhi-prastaav bheja ki- 1

 Promise not to revolt in the future
 gokulasinh ne poocha meraa aparaadh kya he, jo main badshaah se kshamaa maanguga ? tumhaare badshaah ko mujhase kshamaa maangani chahie, kyonki usne akaaran hi mere dharm kaa bahut apmaan kiya he, bahut haani kii he
 Secondly, who trusts his forgiveness and pleading in this world? iske aage sandhi kii charchaa chalaanaa vyarth tha
 Gokulsingh did not leave any scope
 aurangzeb kaa vichaar tha ki gokulasinh ko bhi 'raja' yaa 'thakur' kaa khitaab dekar rijhaa liya jaayegaa or mughalon kaa ek or paaltu bad jaayegaa
 hindustan ko 'daarul islam' banane kii uski suvichaarit yojana nirvighn aage babbti rahegi
 magar gokulasinh ke aage uski kuta niti buree tarah maat kha gayi
 Therefore, Aurangzeb himself started to deal with this unprecedented opponent with a large army, cannons and artillery
 This is one such vivid and inspiring example of breaking of traditions and dignity, which has not gone unnoticed by historians
 europea yatri manuchee ke vrittant ke anusaar pehle akbar ko janaa padaa tha or ab aurangzeb ko, jiskaa samrajya na sirf mughalon main hi balki us samay tak sabhi hindu-muslim shaskaon main sabase bada tha
 This was the greatness of Veevara Gokulsingh
 Aurangzeb, arriving from Delhi, reached Mathura on 28 November 1669
 gokulasinh ke anek sainik or senapati jo vetanbhogi nahin the, kranti bhaavana se anupranit log the, rabi kii buvaai ke silsile main, pados ke agra janapad main chale gaye the
 Aurangzeb built his cantonment in Mathura and from there started the whole war operation
 gokulasinh ko chaaron ore se gheraa ja rahaa tha
 He sent another commander Hasan Ali Khan with a strong and well-equipped army on behalf of Mursan
 Hasan Ali Khan conducted a raid on the morning of December 4, 1669, encircling the three Jat strongholds - Rewada, Chandrakhar and Sarkharu
 shahi topon or banduukon kii maar ke aage ye choti gadhiyaan zyada upyogi siddh na ho sakin or badi jaldi tut gayi
 Pleased with the successes of Hasan Ali Khan, Aurangzeb replaced him with Mathura, replacing him with Shaf Shikan Khan
 uski sahaayta ke liye agra pargane se amanulla khan, muradabad kaa faujadaar namdaar khan, agra shahar kaa faujadaar hoshayar khan apni-apni senaaon ke saath aa pahunche 
 yah vishaal sena chaaron ore se gokulasinh ko gheraa lagaate huue aage badhane lagi
 This campaign against Gokulsingh was of a great scale from the invasions which had been taking place against the great kingdoms and the kings there
 is vir ke paas na to bade-bade durg the, na aravali kii pahadiyaan or na hi maharashtra jaisaa vividhtapurna bhugolic pradesh
 in alaabhakaari sthitiyon ke baavjood, unhone jis dhairya or ran-chaaturya ke saath, ek shaktishaalee samrajya kii kendriya shakti kaa saamana karke, barabari ke parinaam praapt kiye, vah sab abhootpurv he
 In the last week of December 1669, 20 miles from Tilpat, Gokulsingh faced the imperial forces
 jaaton ne mogul sena par ek drudh nishchay or bhayankar krodh se akraman kiya
 The war continued from morning to evening
 koi nirnay nahin ho sakaa
 There was a fierce battle the next day
 jat alokik veerta ke saath yuddh kar rahe the
 The Mughal army, with its cavalry equipped with artillery and jirbakhtar, could not conquer Gokulsingh
 bharat ke itihaas main aise yuddh kam hue hai jahaan kai prakaar se baadhit or kamjor paksh, itane shant nishchay or adig dhairya ke saath ladaa ho
 The battle for the Haldi valley was decided within a few hours
 panipat ke teenon yuddh ek-ek din main hi samaapt ho gaye the, parantu veeravar gokulasinh kaa yuddh tisare din bhi chalaa
 On the third day, a fierce battle ensued
 iske bare main ek itihaaskaar kaa kahana he ki jaaton kaa akraman itnaa prabal tha ki shahi sena ke pair ukhd hi gaye the, parantu tabhi hasan ali khan ke netritv main ek nai tazaadam mogul sena aa gayi
 This army turned Gokulsingh's victory into defeat
 badshaah alamgir kii izzat batch gayi
 The Jats got uprooted, yet they did not run away from their homes
 His destination became the fortress of Tilpat, which was twenty miles from the battlefield
 tisare din se yahan bhi bheeshan yuddh chhid gaya or teen din tak chalata rahaa
 Tilpat's fortress could not stand in front of it amid heavy cannons and it fell down
 tilapat ke patan ke baad gokulasinh or unke taaoo udaisingh ko sapariwaar bandi bana liya gaya
 His seven thousand companions were also arrested
 They were all brought to Agra
 aurangzeb pehle hi aa chukaa tha or laal kile ke diwane aam main aashwast hokar, virajman tha
 All the detainees were presented before him
 aurangzeb ne kaha - Most Jats said - "king, if the path of your God and Rasul is the one you are following, then we should not follow your path
" agle din gokulasinh or udaisingh ko agra kotwali par laayaa gaya-usee tarah bandhe haath, gale se pair tak lohe main jakadaaa sharir
 gokulasinh kii sudaul bhujaa par jallaad kaa pehla kulhada chalaa, to hajaaron kaa jansamooh haahaakaar kar uthaa
 kulhadi se chhitaki hui unki daayin bhujaa chabutare par girakar fadakane lagi
 But not only the face of that hero was also flawless
 usne ek nigaah phuwwara ban gaye kandhe par daali or fir jallaadon ko dekhne laga ki doosraa waar karen
 But the executioners were not in a hurry
 unhen aise hi nirdesh the
 Thousands of people got up on the second ax
 Among them were Hindus and Muslims
 anekon ne ankhen band karali
 anek rote hue bhaag nikle
 As if Holocaust was happening around the police station
 ek ko duusare kaa hosh nahin tha
 There was only one sound in the atmosphere- "hey Ram! 


 Hey Rahim !! Gokulsingh's head fell here in Agra, Keshavraiji's temple in Mathura!" samarvir gokulah kisaan kranti kaa kavy Shri Balveer Singh 'karun', a respected and revered poet of Rajasthan, is now known on all India level due to his lyrical poetry and progressive Indian life vision and effective word work
 rashtrakavi dinakar kii kavyachetana se anupranit karun ji nalanda kii vichaar sabha main dinakar ji ke aksharputra kii oopaadhi se alankrita ho chuke hai
 This powerful and intelligent poet has brought to life a neglected chapter of the seventeenth century by composing a poetic poem called 'samaraveer Gokula'
 varna-jati or swarg-apvarg kii chintaa karne vaala yah desh jab tab apane ko bhul jaataa he
 Like Khaz in the leprosy, the leftist historian and litterateur removes pages from the history of the independent struggle
 parantu pragatisheel rashtriya kavy dhara ne nayi ooshmaa evam nayi urja se sfoort hokar apni lekhnee tham lee he
 The result is - 'samaravir Gokula'
 samaran rahe ki reetikaal ke shrangarik vaataavaran main bhi sarv shri guru govind singh, laalakavi, bhushan, sudan or chandrasekhar ne vir kavy kii rachana kii thi
 His inspiration was the national spirit
 aadhunik yug main balvir singh ‘karun’ ne ‘vijay ketu’ or ‘main dronacharya bolta hoon’ ke baad ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak main ‘samar vir gokula’ kii bhavy prastuti kii he
 This is a testimony to the poise of 'vijay Ketu' and the flourishing of progressive history vision
 ‘samarvir gokula satrahavin sadi kii kisaan kranti kaa rashtriya prabandh kavy he
 The poet has written in the role- 'maharana Pratap, Maharana Raj Singh, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Hasan Khan Mewati, Guru Gobind Singh, Mahavir Gokula and Jat rulers of Bharatpur apart from Jat rulers who cannot openly defy Mughal authority
 
 vir gokula kaa naam isliye pramukhataa se liya jaae ki dilli kii naak ke neeche unhone hunkaar bhari thi or 20 hajaar krishak sainikon kii fouj khadi kar di thi jo avaitnaik, aprashikshit or gharelu astr-shastron se susajjit thi
 Not forgetting this for expansion, he came to make his life to protect the nation
 ’ Shyamnarayan Pandey composed 'haldighati', Pandit Mohanlal Mahato 'viyogi' Praneeth 'aryavart', Prabhakarit 'rashtrapush' and Shrikrishna 'saral', the discussion of poetry is closed
 niraala rachit ‘tulsidas’ or ‘shivaji kaa patr’-donon rachanaayen upekshit hai
 The poems of Dinkar and Nepali are being forgotten
 tathaapi kavy main pragatisheel bhartiya jivan drushti kii rachanaayen nayi chetana ke saath aane lagati hai
 The proof is - the acclaimed performance of 'samarveer Gokula'
 is kavy kii mahatprerana aisi rahi ki yah maatr chalis dinon main likhaa gaya
 Its main purpose is that a struggling chapter of Indian history took the form of poetry and attracted attention in poetry
 madhyakaalin shaury evam shahadat rashtriya sanchetana se sanjeevit hokar prabandhkavy main goonjane lagi
 The fiery devoted personality of the chartered Jat farmer shone with his splendor
 itihaas main damit narnahar gokul kaa charitra chhandon main sabake samaksh aa gaya
 This management of eight cantos is an important contribution of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 kavi ne mathura ke kisaan kul main janame gokul ke sangharsh kii upeksha kii peeda ko saha he
 That victim has tried to give Kavyanjali to the neglected in the national context
 aadi kavi kii karunaa kaa samaran karen phir kavi ‘karun’ kii peeda kii prerana kaa mahatva spasht ho jaayegaa
 That is why the poet has presented the peasant personality of Gokul to the Mughal emperor in the first session
 ucchkul ke naayakatv ke nikash ko gokul ne badal diya tha
 So, how long would Gokul be ignored in the era of upliftment of the peasant-worker-dalit! He struggled vigorously for the survival and identity of peasant life
 videshi mughal shashan dwaara kisaan daman ke virodh kaa sankalp kiya
 Resolved to oppose peasant repression by foreign Mughal rule
 isliye kavi ne pratham sarg main likhaa he- The poet has realized that Gokul Emperor of Tilpat had become a cause of concern for Aurangzeb
 parantu apano ne kya kiya? - In the second canto the poet has depicted the odd conditions of the era and Indian optimism in historical and natural context through his poetry
 prakruti kaa samay chakra aashaa jagaata he - See the fascinating forms of human life and hope of Indian vision - brajamandal main hi nayak gokul kaa janm hua
 This formed the basis of optimism
 teesraa sarg gokul ke kisaan jivan kii chitrawali he-bimbon evam chitron main
 Such depiction of peasant life is rare elsewhere
 kavi kii anubhoot kisaani apni samvednaa evam shramotfull masti ke saath prastut hui he
 As a result, the management of this peasant life has become poetry
 par mughal shashan main kisaan apana pet bhar nahin paata tha
 Taxation was horrific
 jajia to kafir kisaan ke liye bhayanak dandswaroop aropit tha
 Therefore, the pain kept deepening
 parantu kavi mughal shashan ke kathorekrur shashan kaa marmaantak varnan nahin kar sakaa he
 The outrage and rebellion from direct atrocity is naturally described in the fourth canto
 yah sarg kranthichetana or sangharsh ke sankalp kaa ban gaya he
 It is true that the farmers of Mathura were not part of Kanha and Baldau
 ve apane gaurav kii yadakar singh ke samaan garajane lage
 The national consciousness of the poet does not speak only of Mathura and Jat farmers
 vah to hindustan ke lohu kaa samaran rakhata he
 That is why the throne of Delhi was tolerated
 udhar bees hajaar kisaan sangathit hokar takht ke khilaaf khadey ho gayi
 See the progressive vision of the poet's writings samskruti se judkar janchetana jaagrit hoti he
 Gokul started cheering against Mughal tyranny
 sangharsh armbh ho gaya
 The poet has given an authentic description of the freedom struggle of Gokul and his Kisan Kranti Sena in the following three cantos
 rashtriya drushti se mughal hukumat ke damankaaree rup, kisaanon kaa aakrosh or sankalit sangharsh ke shaury kaa varnan is yuddh kii visheshtaayen hai
 The poet has sparked a new national consciousness by showing the struggle of the peasant army of the seventeenth century in the twenty-first century
 yah upekshit adhyay dhul jhadkar apane tejasvi rup ko dikhaakar anupranit kar rahaa he
 In the fifth and sixth canto, the poet Karun has shown the horrific struggle of Sadabad and Tilpat in his well-known narration style and with iconic craft
 nayak gokul kavy kaa vyaktitv hi aisa he- Such gallantry Gokul had taken over the Mughal cantonment Sadabad and surprised the Mughals
 par itihaaskaaron ne upeksha kar di
 Hence the poet has written- ye itihaaskaar mughalon ke videshi atyaachaari rup par maun hi rahete hai
 But the poet Balvir Singh has given a lively depiction of Aurangzeb, frightened by the valor of Gokul - uskaa singhaasana dol uthaa
 The geography of the empire shrunk
 isliye khud aurangzeb san 1669 main bady fouj lekar aa dhamka
 a fierce struggle started in Tilpat, the center of Gokul
 us yuddh kaa ek chitra dekhen - The war continued
 mughal fouj kii takat babbti gayi
 The pressure on Tilpat kept increasing
 antim kshan tak gokul apane chachaa udai singh ke saath yuddh karata rahaa
 Defeat became destiny
 kaid hokar aurangzeb ke saamne laayaa gaya
 He fearlessly expressed his extreme hatred for the tyrannical emperor
 saptam sarg pramaan he
 Aurangzeb was stunned by this stunning peasant hero
 usne maut kii sajaa suna di
 The alternative was conversion
 ashtum sarg- antim sarg prabandhkavy kaa utkarsh he
 The poet has narrated the nature of nature, the mystification of nature and the immortality of soul according to Indian thought, as the role of the death sentence declared on account of freedom struggle

 The law or the law that allows units to be tried or prosecuted gets legal personality
 vividh sansthaaon ko bahut samay purv se aisa vyaktitv praapt tha
 The practice of legal personality emerged in ancient Rome
 vaise greece, phinishia tathaa bevilonia main yah prachlit thi
 Not all persons get legal personality, because not all are eligible for prosecution or trial
 pracheen kaal main videshiyon ko aise koi adhikaar nahin die jate the or daason ko to chal sampatti hi mana jaataa tha
 Babies and lunatics still have a limited personality
 neuyork kii vidhi ke anusaar janm kaidwala kaidi ek prakaar se mat hi mana jaataa he
 On the other hand, in some societies, the fetus also gets legal personality
 kuch main manavsamooh ko yaa form ko yaa murti jaise nirjeev padaarth ko bhi yah vyaktitv pradaan kar diya jaataa he
 Until the Middle Ages, birds and animals were also punished by law as criminals in Europe
 vidhik vyaktitv us vyakti yaa sanstha ko sansuchit karata he jisko kanuunan karne yaa jis par mukadmaa chalaane kaa adhikaar diya gaya ho
 Some examples are- england main 13veen or 14veen shatabdi se hi county, baro, handred, menore, marchent gild, trading gild, dean ityadi vidhik vyaktitv rup main viksit hone lage
 At the time of the famous author Brechton, collective personality or parliamentary constitution, royal manifesto or authority can be established
 english vidhi ke sansthaaon ko sanghaat santhaan tathaa ekak santhaan main vargeekrut kiya he
 The Sanghat Sansthan is an institution formed by symbiotic individuals and the unit is a composite sequence of successor individuals
 pehle prakaar ke santhaan kaa ek udhaaharan joint stock company he or duusare prakaar kaa parcen
 The impact institution has been given more rights than the unit
 ekak santhaan kaa sambodh mahadwipiya vidhi main sthaan na paa sakaa yadhyapi uske dwaara anya do prakaar ke sansthaanon ko manyata di gai jo anglo sexn vidhi dwaara maanya nahin he
 The powers of composition, regulation and winding up of business institutions in India, including banking, insurance and financial institutions excluding cooperatives, are vested in Parliament
 isi prakaar anya sansthaanon kii sthapana bhi jinka kaaryakshetra ek se adhik rajyon main failaa ho, sansad dwaara hi hoti he
 In addition to the above mentioned institutions, other institutions can also be established by the states
 raashtrapati or rajyapal ke adhyadeshon dwaara bhi santhaan sthapit kiye ja sate hai
 Several philosophical theories have been proposed to clarify the nature of legal personality
 sevini or samand ne kalpana siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 He said that the presence of personality in objects other than human beings is just imagination
 samooh main astitv kii vaastaviktaa hoti he kintu darshanik drushti se usamen vaastavik vyaktitv nahin hota
 In this way, only states, institutions, institutions, statues, etc
 become imaginative
 riyaayat siddhant kalpana siddhant kaa hi ek bhinn rup he or kalpana siddhant ke kai pratipadarco ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 It is recognized that the rise of legal personality is through the method itself
 isliye santhaan ko vidhik vyaktitv rajya kii vidhi dwaara hi praapt hota he, swatantra rup se nahin
 According to the parenthesis principle, the members of the institute are entitled to rights and duties, but for the convenience these rights are considered duties in the context of the institute
 is prakaar sabhi sadasyon ke adhikar kartavyon ke santhaan "koshthak" main rakh diya jaataa he
 But for the proper understanding of the situation it is necessary that this bracket is removed
 hissedaaron or company ke sarupya ko asweekaar kar yah siddhant nyaayalayon ko samooh kaa pardaa hataakar vaastavik hiton ko dekhne kii shakti pradaan karata he
 Even according to Sweck Fa Morgan's theory, only humans have personality
 is siddhant kaa samarthan baker or brij ne bhi kiya
 In a way, this theory conveys the condition of principality and imagination
 is siddhant kii yah manyata he ki vyaktitv kisi samooh ke sadasyon ko nahin diya jaataa varan yah kisi uddeshy or kaary ko praapt hota he
 Realistic or inferential theory is suggestive than all other theories
 ise giyarke ne pravartit kiya
 Merland was its supporter
 yah siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki samuhik vyaktitv bhi utana hi vaastavik he jitna saamaanya praaniyon kaa
 The collective personality is neither imagination nor this state concession
 yah is baat ko bhi asweekaar karata he ki santhaan ke sadsy adhikarkartavyon ke vaahak hai
 The institute is a real person in itself
 isaki utpatti vaiyaktik anubandhon ke aadhiky se nahin hoti varan vah vidhik vyaktitv kii rachana ke nimitt kiye gaye samuhik ekwahi prayaas se hoti he
 This collective effort gives a personal appearance to the will of the people, which gives rise to a collective person
 isamen kaary karne kii yogyata evam nijee ichdashakti hoti he
 While analyzing this entire process, Giercken seems to have been influenced by Russo's relationship of personal will and general will
 giyarken sharir se samooh kii upama dete hue yah sweekaar karata he ki samooh bhi vaastavik mastishk, vaastavik ichhashakti or rajya kii vaastavik shakti rakhata he
 Neo Kantiam Kelsen formulated the theory of collective personality based on the principles of pure legal science
 kelson swaabhaavik or vidhik vyaktitvon main koi antar nahin maanata
 According to him, there is a humanization of personality coordinators from a legal point of view
 yah katipay adhikaar kartavya sankulon ko ekta pradaan karanevaala centre bindu he
 It is clear from these principles that these are only philosophical interpretations of legal personality or political interpretation of collective personality
 yahi kaaran he ki ye siddhant ek vyakti company santhaan ke shatrucharitra, pramukh or sahaayak companiyon ke madhya ke aadan pradaan kii samyak vyakhya karne main asamarth hai
 Politically conceived theory is unintelligible and individualistic
 yah vyakti ko hi vaastavik vyaktitv maanata he
 Professor Wolff holds that this principle is contrary to the principle of the independent committee
 riyasat siddhant rajya ko samitiyon ko vyaktitv pradaan karne yaa chin lene kii purna shakti detaa hai
 If this theory has been taken to mean that all collective life is the result of a princely state, then it will be a different matter than the situation
 samooh sadaiv rahete aae hai
 There is ample evidence of joint family in India, family system of Rome, religious and economic organization etc
 yathartwaadee siddhant samooh ke astitv kii yatharthata par jor dekar samooh kii swatantraaa or uske adhikaron ke nitiyukt sweekaran kii maang karata he
 It is appropriate for law to consider institutions as real people, but it would be wrong to say that once a group is formed it gets personality, because the method cannot assess the developing conditions of any group
 uskaa is baat par jor dena uchit he ki samooh apana vyaktitv praapt karne ke katipay aupchaariktaaon ko puraa kare
 Gierken's ideas are very similar to those of Hegel
 vah yah kahata he ki rajya sarvocch santhaan he jisaki vaastavik ichhashakti or mastishk he or isaliye use anya samoohon or sansthaanon par ninyatran rakhana chahie
 Realist theory also accepts the legal personality of committees that have not even received legal recognition, such as the Roman Dutch law, which gave recognition to building societies before the Companies Act came into force
 lekin yah kahana ki vidhik vyaktitv vaastavik he, samajashastreey tathy nahin he
 Freedmen has rightly said that human personality is a feeling of subjectivity and self-consciousness and there is an experience in it, but all efforts of research of collective consciousness and group experience center have failed
 professor peton kaa kahana he ki budhimatta se prayukt na karne par koi bhi ek siddhant galat parinaamon kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Therefore, while applying these principles, it should be kept in mind that they are used for the same purpose for which they were propounded
 duusare arthon main kisi raajnneetik darshan ko samarthit karne ke liye inhen prayukt na kiya jaae
 In practice, the courts did not emulate any theory, although initially the institute may have avoided crime due to the presumption principle
 ab us kshetra ke liye bhi ve uttaradaayi he
 They are also held liable for the crimes of employees
 is vichaar kaa ki santhaan unheen vyaktiyon ke kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hai jo unke liye kaary karte hai or sochate hai, abhi nishchit nirnay nahin ho paaya he
 This precarious position is the policy of the courts to equate the company to its stakeholders
 bhartiya sarvocch nyaayalay ne hissedaaron ko company ke samroop samajhane kii baat ko ek maamle main asweekaar kar diya jab ki ek hissedaar ne company ke moolbhoot adhikaraan kii avhelnaa kii shikaayat kii

 :52 :55 ] janasankhyikee, maanav jansankhya kaa sankhyikeey adhyayan he
 This can be a very general science that can be applied to any kind of dynamic human population, ie a population that changes over time and space
 This includes the study of population size, structure and distribution and spatial and / or temporal changes in terms of birth, migration, aging and death
 janasankhyikeey vishleshan ko shiksha, rashtriyata, dharm or jaateeyata jaise mandandon ke aadhaar par vibhajit puure samaaj par yaa samoohon par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 In the field of education, demography is often considered as a branch of sociology, economics or anthropology
 aupchaarik janasankhyikee ke adhyayan kaa lakshya, jansankhya kii prakriyaaon ke maapan tak simit he, jabaki saamaajik janasankhyikee jansankhya adhyayan kaa adhik vyapak kshetra, ek jansankhya ko prabhavit karne vaale aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik or jaivik prakriyaaon ke bich sambandhon kaa vishleshan karata he
 The term demographics is often mistakenly used to refer to demographics, but refers to characteristics of a particular public community, used in government, marketing, or opinion research, or the demographic profile used in such research
 data sangrah ke do tareeke hai: pratyaksh or apratyaksh
 pratyaksh data, mahatvapurn panjikrut aankadon se aata he jo sabhi janm or mrityu kii toh rakhata he or saath hi saath kanoonee sthiti main kuch khaas parivartanon kaa bhi, jaise vivaah, talaak or pravaas 
 behatar panjikaran pranali vaale viksit deshon main, janm or mrityu kii sankhya kaa akalan karne ke liye panjikaran aankade sabase acha tarika he
 Another direct common method of collecting demographic data is the census
 a census is usually conducted by the national government and attempts to count every person in the country
 baharhaal, mahatvapurn sankhyikee aankadon ke vipareet, jinhen aam taur par lagaataar ekatra kiya jaataa he or ek vaarshik aadhaar par sankshepit kiya jaataa he, janaganana saamanyatya keval har 10 saal main ghatit hoti he or is prakaar aam taur par janm or mrityu ke aankadon ke liye sabase acha strot nahin hai
 Analyzes are conducted after a census to estimate how much has been counted or under-counted
 janaganana main logon kii sirf ginati ke alaava, kaaphi kuch hota he
 They typically gather information about individual characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, literacy / education, employment status, and occupation and geographic location, along with gathering information about families or households
 ve pravaas, bhashaa, dharm, rashtriyata or naagarikta ke aankade bhi ekatra kar sakate hai
 In countries where important registration systems are incomplete, census is also used as a direct source of information about mortality and fertility; The Census of the People's Republic of China, for example, collects information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately before the census
 aankade ekatra karne ke apratyaksh tareekon kii zarurat un deshon main hoti he jahaan puure aankade uplabdh nahin hai, jaise ki adhikansh vikasshil deshon ke maamle main
 inamen se ek takanic he bahan vidhi, jahaan surveykshan ke shodhakarta, mahilaon se poochhate hai ki unki bahanon main kitni mar gayi yaa unke kitne bachche the or kitni umr thi
 With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population
 anya apratyaksh tareekon main shaamil he logon se bhai bahan, mata pita or bacchon ke bare main poochna
 Several types of demographic methods exist to formulate population processes
 unamem shaamil he mrityu sankhya kaa model, prajnan, vivaah, viklaangata, jansankhya anumaan or jansankhya gati 
 Important concepts of demography include: ek sthai jansankhya kaa aakaar, zaruri nahin ki nishchit bana rahe, yah badhata or ghatata rahata he
 Note that the crude mortality rate defined above and which is applied to an entire population may give a misleading assumption
 udhaaharan ke liye, prati 1000 logon main mauton kii sankhya, kam viksit deshon kii tulana main viksit deshon ke liye adhik ho sakati he, iske baavjood ki viksit deshon main swasthya kaa str behatar he
 This is because in developed countries there are proportionately more older people, who are more likely to die in a specific year, due to which the overall death rate may be higher even if the death rate is lower at a given age
