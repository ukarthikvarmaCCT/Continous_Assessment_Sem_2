 Where the canal is made through more filler, the two sides of the canal are made with great care
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar rudki ke sameep solani aquidct ke donon ore baari bharaav main hokar guzarati he
 There the filler is up to 35 feet, ie the land on both sides is quite low
 yahan pakke pushte banaae gaye hai, jo lagbhag teen mile kii lambaai main hai
 But still the water leakage takes place from the bottom of which there are drains on both the sides to contain it, in which the leakage water accumulates and goes into the river
 naharon se kahin-kahin rison dwaara haani bhi bahut hoti he
 Due to the formation of canals, the normal ground water level becomes high
 yadi aas-paas kii bhoomi main pani ke rison kii kshamta kam hui to jalrodh kii avasthaa ho jaati he or krishiyogy bhoomi krishi ke aayogy hone lagati he
 Therefore, along with the construction of canals, the construction of drainage channels becomes necessary
 yadi ye upaay yathasamay nahin kar liye jate to baari haani hone kii ashanka rahati he, jaisaa punjab ke kuch kshetron main ho gaya he
 Construction of canals as well as canals is mandatory
 sansar ke bahut se kshetron main pani ke upyukt nikaas na hone ke kaaran naharon se laabh ke bajaae haani hui he
 Somewhere, to prevent leakage, the bottom of the canals and the two coastal sides are concrete or chosen or fixed by other means
 iske dwaara pani kaa risna kam ha jaataa he
 This policy is particularly successful in the area where there is no irrigation and the canal is built only to carry water forward

 The initial method of rendering a theoretical three-dimensional movie is an anagiff image

 In addition, eclipse method, lenticular and barrier screens, interference filter technology and polarization system used to be its prevalent technology

 unki maan prabhavati devi, bhi ek mashhoor nrutyaangna or adaakara thi
 Meena Kumari's elder sister Khurshid Junior and younger sister Madhu were also film actresses
 kaha jaataa he ki daridrata se grast unke pita ali baqsh unhen paidaa hote hi anathashram main chhod aae the chunki ve unke doctor shriman gadre ko unki fis dene main asamarth the
 However, while moving away from his newborn child, the father was heartened and immediately went towards the orphanage
 paas pahunche to dekha ki nanhee minaa ke puure sharir par chitiyaan kaat raheen thim
 The orphanage door was closed, probably everyone was asleep inside
 yah sab dekh us laachaar pita kii himmat tut gai,aankhon se aansu bah nikle
 Immediately cleared his little life and took it from his heart

 With time, those wounds of the body were cured, but the wounds of the misfortune in the mind did not leave Meena till her last breath

 Seeing Meena's performance, he agreed to cast her as the lead heroine
 durbhagyavash 21 may 1951 ko minaa kumari mahabaleshwaram ke paas ek sadak durghatana kaa shikaar ho gayi jisase unke bahine haath kii choti anguli sadaa ke liye mud gai
 Meena was admitted to Sassoon Hospital in Bombay for the next two months and Kamal Amrohi arrived to inquire about his health on the second day of the accident
 minaa is durghatana se behad dukhi thim kyonki ab wo anaarakali main kaam nahin kar sakati thim
 Kamal Amrohi found the solution to this dilemma, on Meena's request, Kamal put 'merry' on her hand in front of Anarkali
 is tarah kamaal minaa se milte rahe or donon main prem sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 On 14 February 1952, as usual, Meena Kumari's father Ali Baksh left her and her younger sister Madhu at 8 pm at a nearby physical clinic
 pitaaji aksar raatri 10 baje donon bahanon ko lene aayaa karte the
 On that day, as soon as he left, Kamal Amrohi entered the hospital along with his friend Baqar Ali, Qazi and his two sons and 19-year-old Meena Kumari married 34-year-old Kamal Amrohi to her sister Madhu, Baqar Ali, Qazi and witnesses As married in the presence of her two sons

 After this, both the husband and wife started talking overnight, which was heard by a servant one day
 bas phir kya tha, minaa kumari par pita ne kamaal se talaak lene kaa dabaav daalana shuru kar diya
 Meena has decided that she will not live with Kamal until she gives two lakh rupees to her father
 pita ali baqsh ne filmkaar mehboob khan ko unki film amar ke liye minaa kii dats de deen parantu minaa amar kii jagah pati kamaal amrohi kii film dayera main kaam karnaa chaahatin thim
 The father warns them that if they go to work in the husband's film, the doors of their house will be locked forever for Meena
 5 din amar kii shooting ke baad minaa ne film chhod di or dayera kii shooting karne chalin gayi
 That night the father did not let Meena come into the house and under compulsion Meena left for her husband's house

 Vedanta is a branch of Jnana Yoga that motivates a person towards the attainment of knowledge
 iskaa mukhya strot upanishad he jo veda grantho or aranyak granthon kaa saar samajhe jate hai
 The Upanishads are the last part of Vedic literature, hence it is called Vedanta
 karmkand or upasna kaa mukhyat: varnan mantra or brahmanon main he, gyaan kaa vivechan upanishdon main
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 veydant kii teen shakhaayen jo sabase zyada jaani jaati hai ve hai: advait veydant, vishisht advait or dwait
 Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Shri Madhwacharya, who are considered to be the promoters of these three branches respectively, besides these there are other branches of Gyan Yoga
 ye shakhaayen apane pravartakon ke naam se jaani jaati hai jinamein bhaskar, vallabh, chaitanya, nimbarak, vachaspati mishra, sureshwar or vigyaan bhikshu
 Among the major Vedantis that have taken place in modern times, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Arvind Ghosh, Swami Shivananda Raja Rammohan Roy and Raman Maharishi are notable
 ye aadhunik vichaarak advait veydant shakha kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The promoters of other Vedantos have also propagated their ideas well in India but they are little known outside India
 ‘veydant’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘vedon kaa ant’
 Initially, the word 'vedanta' was used for the Upanishads, but later on the principles of the Upanishads developed as the basis, the word 'vedanta' started to be used for them
 upanishdon ke liye 'veydant' shabd ke prayog ke praayah teen kaaran diye jate hai :- According to Acharya Udayveer Shastri, the term 'vedanta' refers to- upar kaha ja chukaa he ‘veydant’ shabd multah upanishdon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 We have many Upanishads related to different codes and their branches
 jinamein pramukh tathaa pracheen hai - ish, ken, kath, mundak, mandukya, taittiriya, aitarey, chaandogya tathaa brihadaaranyak
 There is a lot of similarity between the philosophical principles of these Upanishads, but there also seems to be opposition in many places
 kaalaantar main yah aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai ki virdohi prathit hone vaale vichaaron main samanvay sthapit kar sarvasammat upadeshon kaa sankalan kiya jaye
 To fulfill this need, Badarayana Vyasa composed the Brahmasutra which is also known as Vedanta Sutra, Shareerakasutra, Shareerakamimansa or Uttaraimamsa
 isamen upanishdon ke siddhanton ko atyant sankshep main, sutara rup main sankalit kiya gaya he
 Due to being very concise, there is ambiguity in the formulas themselves and it is not possible to understand them without commentary or commentary
 isiilie anek bhashyakaron ne apane-apane bhashyon dwaara inke abhipraay ko spasht karne kaa praytn kiya kintu is spashtikaran main unka apana-apana drushtikon tha or isiliye unamem paryaapt matbhed he
 Each tried to prove that his commentary clarifies the true meaning of the Brahmasutras
 faltah sabhi bhashyakaar ek-ek veydant sampradaay ke pravartak ban gayi
 Prominent among them are Shankar's monotheism, Ramanuja's specificism, Madhva's dualism, Nimbark's dualism and Vallabh's puritanism
 in bhashyon ke anantar in bhashyon par tikaayen tathaa tikaaon par tikaaon kaa kram chalaa
 Many independent texts were also written to confirm the opinion of their community, due to which the literature of Vedanta became very large
 aitihaasik rup se kisi guru ke liye acharya banane / samajhe jane ke liye veydant kii pustakon par tikaayen yaa bhashya likhane padate hai
 These books include three important books, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gītā and the Brahmasutra, which are called Prasthanatrayi
 tadnusaar aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or madhwacharya teenon ne in teen mahatvapurn pustakon par vishisht rachanaayen di hai
 The ideas revealed in the three texts can be interpreted in many ways
 isi kaaran se brahm, jeev tathaa jagat ke sambandh main anek mat upasthit kiye gaye or is tarah veydant ke anek rupo kaa nirmaan hua tha | Gaudapada and his follower Adi Shankaracharya consider Brahma as the head and consider Jiva and Jagat as integral to him
 unke anusaar tatv ko utpatti or vinaash se rahit hona chahie
 The perishable world is non-existent, the living being is not the same as it appears
 jaagrath or swapnavasthaon main jeev jagat main rahata he parantu sushupti main jeev prapanch gyanshunya chetnavastha main rahata he
 This proves that the pure form of the organism should be like sushumpti
 sushupti avasthaa anitya he at: isse pare turiyavastha ko jeev kaa shuddh rup mana jaataa he
 In this state there is no relation with the mortal world and the organism does not have to enter the mortal world again
 yah turiyavastha abhyaas se praapt hoti he
 When the knowledge of impenetration arises in Brahma-jiva-jagat, the world becomes absorbed in Jiva and Jiva
 teenon main vaastavik abhed hone par bhi agyaan ke kaaran jeev jagat ko apane se pruthak samajhataa he
 But like the dream world, the awakened world is also a fantasy of an organism
 bhed itnaa hi he ki swapn vyaktigat kalpana kaa parinaam he jabaki jaagrath anubhav-samshti-gat mahakalpana kaa
 Falsehood is proved in both of them when they know the dream
 parantu baudhon kii tarah veydant main jeev ko jagat kaa ang hone ke kaaran mithyaa nahin mana jaataa
 a creature experiencing falsehood is the ultimate truth, if he believes it to be false, all knowledge has to be considered false
 parantu jis rup main jeev sansar main vyavhaar karata he uskaa vah rup avashya mithyaa he
 Zoroastrian state of consciousness is zero pure state
 gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa sambandh mithyaa sambandh he
 Beyond this, the organism attains its pure state of consciousness
 is avasthaa main bhed kaa lesh bhi nahin he kyonki bhed dwait main hota he
 This Advaita state is called Brahm
 tatv aseem hota he, yadi doosraa tatv bhi ho to pehle tatv kii seemaa ho jaaegi or simit ho jane se vah tatv buddhigamya hoga jisamen gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa bhed pratibhasith hone lagegaa
 Experience testifies that all known objects are mortal
 at: yadi ham tatv ko anshwar maanate hai to hamen use advay, agyeya, shuddh chaitanya maananaa hi hoga
 By assuming such an element, we have to explain the resplendent state of the world with the help of discourse
 rassi main pratibhasith honevaale sarp kii tarah yah jagat na to sat he, na asat he
 Had it been true, it would never have been destroyed, if it had been immaterial, there would have been no experience of happiness or sorrow
 at: sat asat se vilakshan anivarchaneey avasthaa hi vaastavik avasthaa ho sakati he
 This ignorance has been rendered by the Upanishads as Neti
 agyaan bhav rup he kyonki isse vastu ke astitv kii uplabdhi hoti he, yah abhaav rup he, kyonki iskaa vaastavik rup kuch bhi nahin he
 This ignorance is considered the cause of the world
 agyaan kaa brahm ke saath kya sambandh he, iskaa sahi uttar kathin he parantu brahm apane shuddh nirgun rup main agyaan virahit he, kisi tarah vah bhavabhaav vilakshan agyaan se aavrutt hokar sagun ishwar kahalaane lagata he or is tarah sristikram chaalu ho jaataa he
 God has knowledge of his pure form, but an organism has to be enlightened through cultivation to gain knowledge of his Brahman form
 guru ke mukh se 'tatvamasi' kaa upadesh sunakar jeev 'ahan brahmasmi' kaa anubhav karata he
 At that stage, one sees the whole world as soulful and the whole world in itself because at that time there is no element apart from it
 isi avasthaa ko turiyavastha yaa moksh kehete hai
 Ramanujacharya said contrary to Shankar's view that God is an independent element, but the living is also true, not false
 ye jeev ishwar ke saath sambhddha hai
 Their relation is also not due to ignorance, it is real
 moksh hone par bhi jeev kii swatantra satta rahati he
 The physical world and creatures are different in truth, but the truth of God is unique from their truth
 brahm purna he, jagat jad he, jeev agyaan or du:kha se ghira he
 These three together merge because the universe and the living entity are the bodies of Brahm and Brahma is their soul and destiny
 brahm se pruthak inkaa astitv nahin he, ye brahm kii seva karne ke liye hi hai
 In this philosophy, instead of advaita, the idea of plurality is there, but Brahma is an element that establishes unity among many
 bahutv se vishisht advay brahm kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran ise vishishtadvait kaha jaataa he
 Distinguished knowledge is considered impossible in the Vichitadvaita doctrine
 isiilie shankar kaa shuddh advay brahm is mat main grahya nahin he
 Brahma is special and its specialty is that all the sattva qualities are in it
 at: brahm vastav main shariri ishwar he
 All individual souls are true and it is from this that the body of Brahma is created
 ye brahm main, moksh hane par, leen nahin hotin; inkaa astitv akshunn bana rahata he
 In this way, Brahma is a formula for unity in diversity
 yahi brahm pralay kaal main sookshmbhoot or atmaaon ke saath kaaran rup main sthit rahata he parantu sristikaal main sookshm sthool rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 This work is called Brahm
 anant gyaan or anand se yukt brahm ko narayan kehete hai jo lakshmi ke saath baikunth main nivas karte hai
 One can reach near this Narayana by devotion
 sarvottam bhakthi narayan ke prasad se praapt hoti he or yah bhagavadgyanamay he
 There is no place of caste-varna distinction in the path of devotion
 sabake liye bhagwatprapti kaa yah rajmarg he
 Madhva propagated the dvaita Vedanta in which the five distinctions are considered to be the basis - Jiva God, Jiva Jiva, Jiva Jagatta, God Jagatta, Jagatta Jagatta
 inamen bhed swat: siddh he
 Without distinction the position of the object is impossible
 jagat or jeev ishwar se pruthak hai kintu ishwar dwaara niyantrit hai
 Saguna is the creator, guardian and destroyer of the world
 bhakthi se prasann honevaale ishwar ke ishaare par hi sristi kaa khel chalata he
 Although the creature is naturally enlightened and blissful, it has to suffer with the connection of body, mind, etc

 Komisia An assembly of the ancient Roman republics
 iskaa shabdic arth sansthaagaar he
 The residents of Rome used three words for public meetings: concilium, jo kisi bhi saadhaaran sabha ko kehete the; Comisia, which meant the assembly of all the people of Rome; koshiyo
 There was a clear distinction between comisia and coccia
 komishia kii baithak main kisi vishesh prashn par janata se spasht raay lee jaati thi, parantu koshiyo kii baithak main janata ko ekatra kar yaa to rajya kii ore se koi aadesh sunaaya jaataa; yaa kisi rajkeey niyam kii ghoshnaa kii jaati thi
 In the beginning, Komisia was only an upper class gathering
 parantu dhire dhire jab saadhaaran varg ko raajnneetik evam saamaajik adhikaar milane lage
 Like the rights of the land and military rights, then this class also has a military assembly; Senuria, which was the best of the then Roman assemblies
 use matdaan kaa bhi adhikaar praapt tha
 But as the cornerstone of her organization was authority and prosperity over land, she could not adopt the common class
 parinamat: saadhaaran janata ne ek bhinn raajnneetik sangh sthapit kiya
 It was named Coccillium labis
 yah sabha saadhaaran varg se aanevaale prashaskon kaa chunaav karti, unase sambandhit mukademe sunati tathaa janata kii ore se kansul dwaara komishia senuria main maange pesh karti
 He got statutory rights through the above mentioned works
 samast janata se sambandhit koi prastaav paarit karne kaa adhikaar bhi ise tha
 But now its organization started being based on the provincial castes, so a new well-organized public meeting was needed for the election
 parinamat: 357 i
 pus
 main vaidhanik sabha komishia tributa populi kaa janm hua
 The upper class did not have membership of this public meeting
 iske adhikaar bahut mahatvapurn the
 The general public could freely publish their opinion in it
 parampara ke anusaar janprashaasak hi is matprakashan kaa aarambh karata tha
 Its judicial rights were also free from restrictions
 prashaskon dwaara kiye hue nirnay par is sabha main apil ho sakati thi
 Over the years, the importance of this gathering remained traditional only; It gave approval to the rules passed by the administrators and sometimes it was held for religious ceremonies
 chunaav, vidhaan evam nyaaysambandhi kaaryon ke hetu bhi iskaa sammelan bulaayaa jaataa
 Election of administrators and declaration of war were its main powers
 prajatantr ke antim dinon main yah samast janata dwaara prastaavit evam paarit niyamon kaa udgam bani
 Its president also started to be elected administrator from the public
 komishia kaa apana samvidhan tha jiske niyamon kaa uske sammelnon main paalan hota tha
 The tradition of Komisia continued even after the demolition of democracy
 sambhavat: teesri shatabdi i

 An ancient source of painting in India is the Vishnudharmottara Purana

 The painting itself went from Greece to Greece, where it made great progress
 isa se 1400 varsh pehle misr desh main chitron kaa acha prachaar tha
 The British Museum in London has old Egyptian paintings up to 3000 years old
 bharatvarsh main bhi atyant pracheen kaal se yah vidha prachlit thi, iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the Ramayana, descriptions of paintings, painters and chitrashalas have come up
 vishwakarmee shilpashaastra main likhaa he ki sthaapak, takshak, shilpi aadi main se shilpi ko hi chitra bananaa chahie
 Some of the ancient Indian painters were very skilled in depicting natural scenes, some of the feeling of the Uttararamcharit of Bhavabhuti, in which Sita is surprised to see the images of exile brought before her
 yadhyapi aajkal koi granth chitrakala par nahin miltaa he, tathaapi pracheen kaal main aise granth avashya the
 The poet Domodar Gupta of the assembly of King Jayaditya of Kashmir has written a treatise called 'chitrasutra' of Chitravidya in his treatise called Kuttanimat 1100 years ago
 ajanta gupha ke chitron main pracheen bharatvasiyon kii chitranipunata dekh chakit rah janaa padataa he
 These paintings have been praised by big scientific Europeans
 un gufaaon main chitron kaa bananaa isa se do sau varsh purv se aarambh hua ta aurak aathvin shatabdi tak kuch na kuch guphaayen nai khudati raheen
 Therefore, these pictures are definitely a proof of two and a half thousand years
 chitravidya seekhney ke liye pehle prayek prakaar kii sidhi tedi, vakr aadi rekhaayen khinchne kaa abhyaas karnaa chahie
 After this, the gross structures of the objects should be made by lines only
 is vidya main duuri aadi ke siddhant kaa puraa anushilan kiye bina nipunata nahin praapt ho sakati
 The marking of the extension below or parallel to the vision is easy, but it is a difficult subject to mark the far extension in front of the eyes
 is prakaar kii duuri kaa vistaar pradarshit karne kii kriya ko 'persepective' kehete hai
 The views of a city on a far-off road, a river in front, etc
, cannot be shown without knowing its principles
 kis prakaar nikat ke padaarth bade or saaf dikhaai padate hai or dur ke padaarth kramshah chote or dhundle hote jate hai, ye sab baaten ankit kerani padati hai
 Take, for example, a frame frame placed at a distance
 maan lijie ki aap use ek aise kinare se dekh rahe hai jahaan se uske do parshv yaa teen kone dikhaai padate hai
 Now for the purpose of drawing a picture, we will see with a pencil parallel to the eyes and pressing one eye, the vertical angle closest to all of the box will be seen; The side which will be more in front, the angle on the other side will be smaller than that and the side which will be less visible, the angle on the other side of it will appear the smallest
 arthath nearesth kone rekha se laga hua us parshv kaa kone jo kam dikhaai detaa he, adhik dikhaai padanevaale parshv ke kone se chota hoga
 The second principle is of light and shadow, without which life cannot come
 padaarth kaa jo ansh nikat or saamne rahegaa vah khulata or spasht hoga; or jo dur yaa bagal main padegaa, vah spasht ore kalimaa liye hoga
 The elevation and depth of the substances are also shown according to the rules of this light and shade
 jo ansh uthaa yaa ubhara hoga, vah adhik khulata hoga or jo dhansa yaa gaharaa hoga vah kuch syaahi liye hoga
 Because of not knowing these principles, the market painters who make paintings on glass, etc
, seem to know the game
 chitron main rang ek prakaar kii kunchi se bharaa jaataa he jise chitrakaar kalam kehete hai
 Earlier there was a pen made of hair of a squirrel's tail

 catholic dharm yaa roman catholic dharm isai dharm kii ek mukhya shakha he jiske anuyaayi rome ke vatican nagar main sthit pope ko apana dharmadhyaksh maanate hai
 The second main branch of Christianity is called the Protestant and its followers do not accept the religious leadership of the Pope
 catholicon or protestanton kii dharmik manyataon main or bhi bade antar hai
 The Roman Catholic Church Jesus established a church for the teaching initiation of his future followers and appointed Saint Peter as its president
 sant peter kaa dehanth rome main hua tha jisase prarambh hi se rome ke bishap ko carch kaa paramadhyaksh mana jane laga
 The unity of this church could not remain intact due to many reasons
 pehle praachya carch rome se alag ho gaye
 Later Protestant religion emerged which resulted in the denial of the authority of the Bishop of Rome by a significant portion of the Western Church
 yah sab hote hue bhi aajkal vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon ke aadhe se kuch adhik log roman katholic carch ke sadsy hai
 This church is called Roman because it operates from the Vatican city of Rome
 katholic kaa mul arth vyapak he
 The Catholic Church claims that it is open to the people of "all countries" until the epoch, that is, "all the time" and teaches "all" religious truths revealed by Jesus
 katholic carch kaa sanghathan sudrudh or kendribhoot he
 Its priest is the bishop of Rome who is considered the successor of Saint Peter
 
 Wherever there is a community of Catholic Christians, a bishop is appointed by Rome or with Rome's approval for their spiritual conduct
 bishap kii adheenta main purohit vibhinn sthanon par rahakar isaayiyon ko upadesh diya karte hai or sanskaar pradaan karte hai
 There are several standing committees and commissions in Rome that assist the pope for the operation and administration of the entire Roman Catholic Church, headed by cardinals
 catholic dharm ko angrezi main "caseolicysm" bulaayaa jaataa he
 Note the pronunciation of 'TH' in it and the amount of 'AU' on it
 angrezi main sangathit catholic dharm ko "catholic carch" bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 It is noteworthy that although the word "church" means "church", "catholic Church" also means "entire Catholic religious community"
 catholic maanate hai ki unka dharmik sanghathan aarambhik isai sanghathan ke rivaayat ko jari rakhata he or uskaa ekmaatr vaaris he
 They believe that the bread and wine that is drunk in their prayer rituals become the mass and blood of Jesus Christ in a religious sense, which are prayed to by those who pray
 protestanton kii ritiyon main aisa nahin hota
 Catholics consider the Pope to be the ultimate president of Christianity on earth, who is not a Protestant
 is dharmik sanghathan main har padri ke upar ek us se ucch koti kaa padri hota he or ant main sabhi ke upar pope hota he
 In Catholicism, priests are not allowed to marry and have to practice lifelong celibacy
 kuch striyaan bhi apana jivan dharm ke naam kar detii hai or aaajeevan kunwari rahati hai
 These are called "nuns"
 jab yah nan banane kii shapath letin hai to ek aupchaarik samaaroh main vivaah ke vastra dhaaran kiye inkaa "isa se vivaah" rachaaya jaataa he
 Often these nuns are teachers in schools run by Catholic organizations
 catholic dharm main kuch bhakton ko aupchaarik rup se santon kaa darja diya jaataa he or catholicon ko anumati he ki ve inaki puja kar saken
 In many Catholic countries, a local Catholic saint is considered very valid, such as "saint Patrick" in Ireland and "saint Stanislaus" in Poland

 catholic striyon main "meri", "maaria" or "mariyam" jaise naam aam hai or catholic vidyalayon main "saint meri" jaise naam bhi aksar dekhe jate hai
 The Latin-language eulogy called "ave Maria" is quite popular in Catholic communities
 catholic nazariye main aisi dharmik hastiyon ko kari puja ishwar ko praapt hoti hai or is se dharm aam janata ke sameep aata he
 The Protestant view is contrasted with this, and saintly practice is often considered a hidden form of Europe's ancient non-christian customs in which there were many deities

 The expert needs scientific criteria to prove his conclusion, so that he can prove the truth of his point
 aisi pramanit baton ko aadhaar banaakar nyaayalay apana nirnay kisi ke paksh main kar sakati he tathaa kisi dandit kar saktaa he
 The court itself determines whether the evidence given by the expert is honorable or not

 This skit is very interesting even when it is small

 Or wants to add this provision to them
 isi karm main vah shakya bhikshu nimagn rahata he
 One day while going to the Buddhist monastery, he thinks - 'extremely merciful Lord Buddha inhabited palaces, sleeping on beautiful bedded beds, eating in the first hour, eating sweet juices in the afternoon, wearing tambul and silk cloth with five fragrances
 While preaching the monk-sangha through precepts, would not the law of female cohabitation and drinking have also been done? Must have done

 a positive electron is a fundamental particle found in an atom
 yah dhan aavesh yukt electron he
 Its properties are similar to electrons, but the difference between the two is that electron is negatively charged particle and positron is positive charged particle
 iskaa dravyaman electron ke dravyaman ke samaan hota he
 It was discovered in 1932 by Carl D
 Anderson
 iskaa vidyut aavesh +1
602176487×10−19 kulamb hota he
 Its rotation speed is half
 positron ko β+ chinh se bhi darshaate he
 When the positron and electron collide, both are destroyed and two gamma ray photons are generated
 chikitsaalay main upyog hone vaale eks kiran main neutron, gamma kiran, protone, nutrino, ke saath positron bhi shaamil rahata he
 Positron's experimental invention occurred in 1932 AD
 andersan ne dekha ki wilson abhrakoshth main chumbakeey kshetra lagaakar yadi antariksh kirnon ke photo len, to praaia: electron jaise do path drushti main aate hai, jinaki vakrata ulti dishaao main hoti he
 The curvature depends on the charge of the particle
 isaliye in prayogon se spasht he ki in kanon kaa aavesh ulta hoga
 Now the existence of positron has also been established by other tests
 pozitron ke prayogtmak avishkaar se chaar varsh pehle dirack ne ek sameekaran diya tha, jisase electron ke sab gyaat gundharmon kaa varnan ho jaataa tha, kintu saath hi iske anusaar ek aise kan kaa maananaa bhi anivaary tha jisaki sanhati or urja rinatmak hon
 This thing was strange
 is avaanchhneeya sthiti se bachane ke liye dirack ne prastaav rakhaa ki saadharantaya rinatmak urja kii sab avasthaaen electronon se bhari rahati hai
 Therefore, we can see only the states of positive energy
 par kabhi kabhi jab vidyutchchumbakeey kshetra dwaara prabal, paraspar kriyaayein hoti hai tab rinatmak urja kii avasthaaon main se ek electron baahar nikal aata he tathaa baahar aakar aise vyavhaar karata he jaise dhan urja electron karte hai
 But at the same time a state with negative energy becomes empty
 ise ham rin urja ke samudr main ek chhidr se chitrit kar sakate hai
 This hole behaves in the same way as a positively charged particle, which is equivalent to an electron
 pahile dirack ne is kan ko proton maanane kaa praytn kiya, par andersan ke parinaam kaa pataa chalane par unhone is kan ko proton nahin, parantu pozitron mana
 Dirac's perforation theory is not very satisfactory
 electron or pozitron kaa aadhunik siddhant dirack sameekaran ke dwitiya quanteekaran par nirbhar he
 The properties of positron are derived from the natural method
 electron or pozitron ko 'kan' or 'pratikan' kah sakate hai
 This ideology has proved extremely useful in physics

 kaha jaataa he ki pracheen kaal main prabandh or roopak, do prakaar kii gaan style prachlit thi
 Dhrupad evolved from the management style and from metaphor to khyal and thumri
 amir khusro ne khyaal gayaki kaa parishodhan kiya
 Sultan Hussain Shah of Jaunpur in the fourteenth century gave special encouragement to Khayal
 kintu unke pashchaat yah upekshit sa hi rahaa
 It was asked again in the 18th century during the time of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah
 unke darbar main sadaarang or adaarang naamak do gayak bandhu the jo tansen ke vanshaj kahe jate hai
 These people composed thousands of Khyalas and spread them among their disciples
 kintu aashcharya kii baat yah he ki in donon gayakon ne swayan kabhi nahin gaaya or na apane vanshajon ko hi gane kii anumati di
 For this reason the idea is not counted under classical music
 iske baavjood unke shishyon ne khyaal ko lokapriyata pradaan kii
 Some of the singers who have gained fame due to the promotion of Khyal are Bhatkhande, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, Ustad Karim Khan, Ustad Fayyaz Khan
 vilambit or drut khyaal ke do prakaar hai
 The thought which is composed on the Dhrupad style is sung in a delayed rhythm and tilwara, jhumra, jhada chautal or a rhythm
 ise bada khyaal kehete hai
 The Khyal which is sung in a tritala, a rhythm or a japhtal is a quick thought; It is also called small thought
 bade khyaal kii rachana sadaarang or adaarang ne kii thi
 Before them dhrupad-dhamar and Chhota Khyal were sung as classical music
 aajkal mehphilon main gayak pehle bada khyaal uske baad chota khyaal, donon gaate hai
 How many houses of singing and singing each of them has its own style
 khyaal ke asthaayee or antara do bhaag hai
 The singer first expands the vocals by tying bandish to alap and tana and then gradually elevates the building of the raga
