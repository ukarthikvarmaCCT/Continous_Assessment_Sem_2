 "we have always been very open and honest about the origins of our songs

 After the release of The Beautiful Letdown, the band temporarily stopped attending Christian festivals and interviews with Christian organizations, as they felt that speculations about their religious faith were disrupting their music

 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs
 vimaan tathaa usee prakaar ke sadhano ke yantron main ati teevr veg tathaa charam bhautik paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai; aise yantron ke nirmaan main prayek avyav antarbahya nirdosh tathaa yatharth hona chahie
 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope
