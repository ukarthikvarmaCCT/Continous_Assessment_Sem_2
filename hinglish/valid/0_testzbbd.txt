 is par devtaa logon ko chintaa hui ki ram ko rajya mil jane par ravan kaa vadh asambhav ho jaayegaa
 Distraught, he prayed to Goddess Saraswati for some kind of remedy
 saraswati ne manthra, jo ki kaikeyi kii daasi thi, kii buddhi ko pher diya
 Kaikeyi went to Kop Bhavan with Manthara's advice
 dasharath jab manaane aaye to kaikeyi ne unase vardaan maange ki bharat ko raja banaaya jaye or ram ko chaudaa varshon ke liye vanvaas main bhej diya jaye
 Sita and Lakshman also went to the forest with Rama
 rungverpur main nishadaraaj guhya ne teenon kii bahut seva kii
 After some hesitation, the boatman drove the three across the river Ganges
 prayag pahunch kar ram ne bharadwaj muni se bhent kii
 Ram Yamuna, bathing from there, reached the ashram of Valmiki Rishi
 valmiki se hui mantranaa ke anusaar ram, sita or lakshmana chitrakoot main nivas karne lage
 Dasaratha died in Ayodhya due to the disconnection of the son
 vashishtha ne bharat or shatrughna ko unke nanihaal se bulavaa liya
 On coming back, Bharata did his mother Kaikeyi, for his wretchedness, repented a lot and performed the funeral procession of Dasaratha according to the gurus
 bharat ne ayodhya ke rajya ko asweekaar kar diya or ram ko manaa kar waapas laane ke liye samast snehijanon ke saath chitrakoot chale gayi
 Kaikeyi also felt very sorry for his actions
 sita ke mata-pita sunayana evam janak bhi chitrakoot pahunche
 Bharata and all the other people proposed Ram to go back to Ayodhya to be ruled by Rama, who obeyed his father and obeyed Raghuvansh
 bharat apane snehi janon ke saath ram kii paduka ko saath lekar waapas ayodhya aa gayi
 He enshrined Rama's Paduka on the throne and started living in Nandigram himself
 kuch kaal ke pashchaat ram ne chitrakoot se prayaag kiya tathaa ve atri rishi ke ashram pahunche
 Atri praised Rama and his wife Anasuya explained the merits of Pativrat Dharma to Sita
 vahaan se phir ram ne aage prasthaan kiya or sharbhang muni se bhent kii
 Sharabhang Muni was residing there only by wishing to see Rama, so having fulfilled his desire for Rama's darshan, burnt his body with yogagni and made Brahmaloka move
 or aage badhane par ram ko sthaan sthaan par haddiyon ke dher dikhaai pade jinke vishay main muniyon ne ram ko bataaya ki rakshason ne anek muniyon ko kha daalaa he or unheen muniyon kii haddiyaan hai
 On this, Rama vowed that he would slay all the demons and make the earth devoid of demons
 ram or aage bade or path main sutikshn, agastya aadi rishiyon se bhent karte huye dandak van main pravesh kiya jahaan par unki mulaakaat jataayu se hui
 Ram made Panchavati his place of residence
 panchvati main ravan kii bahan shurpanakha ne aakar ram se pranay nivedan-kiya
 Rama sent him to Laxman, saying that he is with his wife and his younger brother is alone
 lakshmana ne uske pranay-nivedan ko asweekaar karte huye shatru kii bahan jaan kar uske naak or kaan kaat liye
 Shurpanakha asked for help from khar-khoan and he came to fight with his army
 ladaai main ram ne khar-dooshan or uski sena kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Shurpanakha went and complained to her brother Ravana
 ravan ne badla lene ke liye marich ko swarnamrig bana kar bheja jisaki chaal kii maang sita ne ram se kii
 After ordering Laxman to protect Sita, Rama went after him to kill the golden form of Maricha
 marich ke haathon maaraa gaya par marate marate marich ne ram kii aawaaj bana kar ‘ha lakshmana’ kaa krandan kiya jise sun kar sita ne ashankavash hokar lakshmana ko ram ke paas bhej diya
 After Laxman's departure, Sita alone deceived Ravana and took him with him to Lanka
 raste main jataayu ne sita ko bachaane ke liye ravan se yuddh kiya or ravan ne uske pankh katkar use adhamra kar diya
 Not finding Sita, Ram became very sad and started mourning
 raste main jataayu se bhent hone par usne ram ko ravan ke dwaara apni durdasha hone va sita ko har kar dakshin disha kii ore le jane kii baat bataai
 After telling all this, Jatayu gave up his life and Rama proceeded within the dense forest in search of Sita after performing his last rites
 raste main ram ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran rakshas bane gandharv kabandh kaa vadh karke uskaa uddhaar kiya or shabari ke ashram ja pahunche jahaan par ki uske dwaara diye gayi jhuthe beron ko uske bhakthi ke vash main hokar khaaya
 Thus Rama proceeded inside the dense forest in search of Sita
 ram rishyamook parvat ke nikat aa gayi
 Sugriv lived with his ministers on that mountain
 sugriv ne, is ashanka main ki kahin baali ne use maarane ke liye un donon veeron ko na bheja ho, hanuman ko ram or lakshmana ke vishay main jaankaree lene ke liye brahman ke rup main bheja
 After knowing that he was not sent by Bali, Hanuman befriended Rama and Sugriva
 sugriv ne ram ko santvana di ki janaki ji mil jaayengin or unhen khojane main vah sahaayta degaa saath hi apane bhai baali ke apane upar kiye gayi atyaachaar ke vishay main bataaya
 Rama fraudulently slaughtered Bali and gave the kingdom of Kishkindha to Sugriva and gave the post of crown prince to Angad's son Angad
 rajya prapti ke baad sugriv vilaas main lipt ho gaya or varsha tathaa sharad ritu vyateet ho gai
 On Rama's displeasure, Sugriva sent the monkeys to search for Sita
 sita kii khoj main gayi vaanron ko ek gupha main ek tapaswini ke darshan huye
 Tapaswini brought the search party to the beach with the power of yoga where she met Sampathi
 sampaati ne vaanron ko bataaya ki ravan ne sita ko lanka ashokavatika main rakhaa he
 Jambavant encouraged Hanuman to cross the sea
 hanuman ne lanka kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Sursa took the test of Hanuman and blessed him by finding him worthy and capable
 maarg main hanuman ne chaaya pakadaney vaali rakshasi kaa vadh kiya or lankini par prahaar karke lanka main pravesh kiya
 He met Vibhishan
 jab hanuman ashokavatika main pahunche to ravan sita ko dhamka rahaa tha
 When Ravana left, Trijata consoled Sita
 ekaant hone par hanuman ne sita se bhent karke unhen ram kii mudrika di
 Hanuman killed Ravana's son Akshay Kumar by destroying the Ashokavatika
 meghnath hanuman ko nagapasha main baandh kar ravan kii sabha main le gaya
 In response to Ravana's question, Hanuman introduced himself as the messenger of Rama
 ravan ne hanuman kii punch main tel main duba hua kapadaa baandh kar aag laga diya is par hanuman ne lanka kaa dahan kar diya
 Hanuman approaches Sita
 sita ne apni chudamani de kar unhen vidaa kiya
 They came back across the sea and met all the apes and all went back to Sugriva
 hanuman ke kaary se ram atyant prasann huye
 Ram reached the beach with the army of apes
 udhar vibhishana ne ravan ko samajhaayaa ki ram se bair na len is par ravan ne vibhishana ko apamaanit kar lanka se nikaal diya
 Vibhishana came under the shelter of Rama and Rama declared him king of Lanka
 ram ne samudr se rasta dene kii vinati kii
 Rama was angry at not accepting the request and fearing his anger, Samudra himself came after pleading for Rama and told him how to build a bridge by Nal and Neel
 jambavant ke aadesh se nal-nil donon bhaaiyon ne vanar sena kii sahaayta se samudr par pul baandh diya
 Sri Rama established Sri Rameshwar and worshiped Lord Shankar and crossed the ocean with the army
 samudr ke paar jaakar ram ne deraa daalaa
 Ravana was deeply disturbed by the news of the bridge being tied and Rama crossing the sea
 mandodari ke ram se bair na lene ke liye samajhane par bhi ravan kaa ahankaar nahin gaya
 Here Rama along with his vanarasena started living on the Subel mountain
 angad ram ke doot ban kar lanka main ravan ke paas gayi or use ram ke sharan main aane kaa sandesh diya kintu ravan ne nahin mana
 The war started when all the peace attempts failed
 lakshmana or meghnad ke madhya ghor yuddh hua
 Lakshman fainted due to the power of Shaktiban
 unke upachaar ke liye hanuman sushen vaidya ko le aaye or sanjivani laane ke liye chale gayi
 On receiving the news from the intelligence, Ravana sent Kalanemi to interrupt Hanuman's work, which Hanuman killed
 aushadhi kii pahchaan na hone ke kaaran hanuman puure parvat ko hi uthaa kar waapas chale
 On the way, in the suspicion of Hanuman being a demon, Bharat fainted by hitting the arrow, but knowing the truth, he sat on his arrow and sent it back to Lanka
 idhar aushadhi aane main vilamb dekh kar ram pralaap karne lage
 Hanuman brought medicine at the right time and Lakshman became healthy with the treatment of Sushen
 ravan ne yuddh ke liye kumbhkarna ko jagaaya
 Kumbhakarna also unsuccessfully prayed to Ravana to go to Rama's shelter
 yuddh main kumbhkarna ne ram ke haathon paramgati praapt kii
 Laxman fought Meghnad and killed him
 ram or ravan ke madhya anekon ghor yuddh huai or ant main ravan ram ke haathon maaraa gaya
 Handing over the kingdom of Lanka to Vibhishan, Rama along with Sita and Lakshman boarded Pushpakviman and left for Ayodhya
 uttarkand ram katha kaa upsanhaar he
 Ram returned to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and the entire Vanarasena
 ram kaa bhavy swaagat hua, bharat ke saath sarvajanon main anand vyaapt ho gaya
 Rama was crowned with praise of the Vedas and Shiva
 abhyaagton kii vidaai di gai
 Rama preached to the praja and praja expressed gratitude
 chaaron bhaaiyon ke do do putr huye

 uparokt baton ke saath hi saath goswami tulsidas ji ne uttarkand main shri ram-vashishtha samvaad, naarad ji kaa ayodhya aakar ramachandra ji kii stuti karnaa, shiv-parvati samvaad, garud moh tathaa garud ji kaa kakbhushundi ji se ramakatha evam ram-mahima sunanaa, kakbhushundi ji ke purvajanm kii katha, gyaan-bhakthi nirupan, jnyanadeepak or bhakthi kii mahaan mahima, garud ke saat prashn or kakbhushundi ji ke uttar aadi vishyon kaa bhi vistrut varnan kiya he
 While Tulsidas ji has abolished Ramcharitmanas by writing the above description, Adikavi Valmiki in his Ramayana narrates the birth of Ravana and Hanuman in Uttarakhand, Sita's exile, Raja Nriga, Raja Nimi, Raja Yayati and the dog's justice in Ramrajya, The birth of Lavkush, the ritual of Ashwamedha Yajna by Rama and the Ramayya composed by Mahakavi Valmiki by his sons Love and Kush in that Yagya
 Singing, Sita's Abyss entry, abandon LAX, is also described 515 518
 valmiki ramayana main uttarkand kaa samaapan ram ke mahaprayan ke baad hi hua he
 All the characters in Ramayana follow their religion
 ramayana ke charitron se sikh lekar manushya apane jivan ko sarthak bana saktaa he
 Inspired by Valmiki Ramayana, Saint Tulsidas composed an epic like Ramcharitmanas which is the Hindi version of Ramayana written in Sanskrit by Valmiki
 ramcharitamanas main hindu aadarshon kaa utkrisht varnan he isiliye ise hindu dharm ke pramukh granth hone kaa shrey mila hua he or prayek hindu parivaar main bhakthibhaav ke saath iskaa pathan pathan kiya jaataa he
 Inspired by the Ramayana itself, Maithilisharan Gupta composed the clauses named Panchavati and Saket
 ramayana main lakshmana kii patni urmila ke ullekhneey tyaag ko shaayad bhulvash andekha kar diya gaya he or is bhul ko saket khandakavy rachakar maithilisharan gupt ji ne sudhara he
 Inspired by the story related to Rama, Shree Bhagwatananda Guru composed the Sanskrit epic Sriraghavendracharitam which is full of wonderful and secret Kathaprasang
 is granth main 20 se adhik prakaar ke ramaayanon kii katha kaa samavesh he
 Apart from the royal court of Nepal, poet, Radheshyam Ramayan of Shri Radheshyam ji, Prem Ramayan of Prem Bhushan, Kamb Ramayan of Maharishi Kamban and many other writers have drawn many works by taking inspiration from Ramayana

 altaai ek bhashaa-parivaar he jisamen turki bhashaayen, mongol bhashaayen, tungusi bhashaayen, japani bhashaayen or korian bhashaa aati hai
 Altai languages are spoken over a very wide area of eurasia, going from Eastern Europe through Central Asia to Japan
 is parivaar main kul milakar lagbhag 70 jivit bhashaayen aati hai or inhen bolne waalon kii taadaad vartmaan vishwa main lagbhag 50 karod he
 Despite many linguists acknowledging the existence of this language-family, there are some scholars who do not believe it
 inkaa kahana he ki aisa koi bhashaa-parivaar nahin he or in sab pruthak bhashaaon ko jabardastee ek samooh main thunsa ja rahaa he
 Everyone believes that many things of these languages are found together
 altaai bhashaa-parivaar ke himachati kehete hai ki yah isliye hai kyonki yah sabhi ek hi pracheen aadim-altaai bhashaa kii santaanen hai
 Opponents of the Altai language-family say that there was never such a language and the similarities of these languages arose because there has been a lot of mutual mixing among the speakers, due to which they have deeply influenced each other
 bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki yah bhashaa-parivaar jis aadim bhashaa se shuru hua vah madhya asia ke altaai parvaton main boli jaati thi
 This is the name of this language-family
 mewar, rajasthan ke shishodiya rajvansh ke shaasha the
 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 The Jallianwala Bagh massacre on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar had a profound impact on Bhagat Singh's thinking
 lahore ke neshnal cholez kii padhai chhodkar bhagat singh ne bharat kii azaadi ke liye noujvaan bharat sabha kii sthapana kii thi
 In the Kakori case, Bhagat Singh was so caught up with the execution of four revolutionaries including Ram Prasad 'bismil' and imprisonment on 16 others that Pandit Chandrashekhar Azad joined his party Hindustan Republican Association and gave him a new name Hindustan Socialist Republican Association

 Bhagat Singh was around twelve years old when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place
 isaki soochna milte hi bhagat singh apane skool se 12 mile paidal chalakar jalianwala baag pahunch gayi
 At this age, Bhagat Singh used to read the revolutionary books of his uncles and wondered whether their path was right? After the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji broke, he began to choose for himself from the non-violent ways of Gandhiji and the violent movement of revolutionaries
 gandhi ji ke asahyog aandolan ko radd kar dene ke kaaran unamem thodaa rosh utpann hua, par puure raashtra kii tarah wo bhi mahatma gandhi kaa sammaan karte the
 But he did not consider it unfair to adopt the path of violent revolution for the freedom of the country instead of Gandhiji's non-violent movement

 Despite Congress being in power, Bhagat Singh did not get the status of Congress martyr, as he only used Bhagat Singh's name to connect the youth with his party
 unhen poonjipatiyon kii mazdooron ke prati shoshan kii niti pasand nahin aati thi
 At that time, since the British were the only surveyors and very few Indian industrialists could make progress, their opposition to the atrocities against the British workers was natural
 majdoor virdohi aisi nitiyon ko british sansad main paarit na hone dena unke dal kaa nirnay tha
 Everybody wanted that the British should know that Hindustani has woken up and there is a resentment towards such policies in their heart
 aisa karne ke liye hi unhone dilli kii kendriya essembali main bam phenkane kii yojana banaayi thi
 Bhagat Singh wanted it to not have any bloodshed and that his 'voice' could also reach the British

 As per schedule, on April 8, 1929, both of them threw bombs in the Central Assembly at a place where no one was present, otherwise they could get hurt

 Bhagat Singh could have run away if he wanted, but he had already thought that he accepts punishment even if he is hanged; Therefore, he refused to run

 After the bomb exploded, he said "inquilab-zindabad, imperialism-murdabad!" The slogan was raised and the leaflets brought with him bounced in the air
 iske kuch hi der baad police aa gayi or donon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Bhagat Singh spent about 2 years in jail
 is dauraan ve lekh likhakar apane krantikari vichaar vyakt karte rahe
 His studies continued while in prison
 unke us dauraan likhe gayi lekh va sage sambandhiyon ko likhe gayi patr aaj bhi unke vichaaron ke darpan hai
 In his articles he has described the capitalists as his enemy in many ways
 unhone likhaa ki mazdooron kaa shoshan karne vaala chahen ek bhartiya hi kyon na ho, vah unka shatru he
 He also wrote an article in English in prison titled Why am i an atheist? In prison, Bhagat Singh and his colleagues conducted a hunger strike for 64 days
 unke ek saathi yatindranath das ne to bhukh hadtaal main apane praan hi tyaag diye the
 On August 26, 1930, the court convicted Bhagat Singh under sections 129, 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 6F of the Explosive Substances Act and section 120 of the IPC
 7 aktubar, 1930 ko adaalat ke dwaara 68 prishthon kaa nirnay diya, jisamen bhagat singh, sukhdev tathaa raajaguru ko faansee kii sajaa sunai gai
 Section 144 was imposed in Lahore with the execution of the sentence
 iske baad bhagat singh kii faansee kii maafee ke liye privi parishad main apil daayar kii gai parantu yah apil 10 janvari, 1931 ko radd kar di gai
 After this, the then Congress President Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya filed an appeal before the Viceroy on 14 February 1931 for forgiveness of sentence, using his privilege to waive his death sentence on the basis of humanity
 bhagat singh kii faansee kii sazaa maaf karwaane hetu mahatma gandhi ne 17 farvari 1931 ko vysarai se baat kii phir 18 farvari, 1931 ko aam janata kii ore se bhi vysarai ke saamne vibhinn tarko ke saath sajaa maafee ke liye apil daayar kii
 All this was happening against the wishes of Bhagat Singh because Bhagat Singh did not want his sentence to be forgiven
 23 march 1931 ko shaam main kareeb 7 bajkar 33 minute par bhagat singh tathaa inke do saathiyon sukhdev va raajaguru ko phaansi de di gai
 He was reading Lenin's biography before going on the gallows and when asked about his last wish, he said that he was reading Lenin's biography and that he should be given time to do it
 kaha jaataa he ki jail ke adhikariyon ne jab unhen yah soochna di ki unke phaansi kaa vakt aa gaya he to unhone kaha tha- "tehriye! pehle ek krantikari duusare se mil to le
 "then a minute later the book bounced towards the ceiling and said -" Okay now come on
 " While going on the gallows, the three were singing with joy - phaansi ke baad kahin koi aandolan na bhadak jaye iske dar se angrejon ne pehle inke mrit sharir ke tukade kiye phir ise boriyon main bharkar ferozepur kii ore le gayi jahaan ghi ke badale mitti kaa tel daalkar hi inako jalaayaa jane laga
 When the people of the village saw the fire burning, they came closer
 isse darkar angrejon ne inaki laash ke adhjale tukdon ko sutluj nadi main phenkaa or bhaag gayi
 When the villagers came near, they collected pieces of their dead bodies and duly cremated them
 or bhagat singh hameshaa ke liye amar ho gayi
 After this, people began to consider Gandhian as well as Gandhian responsible for his death
 is kaaran jab gandhi congress ke lahore adhiveshan main hissaa lene ja rahe the to logon ne kaale jhandon ke saath gandhiji kaa swaagat kiya
 Gandhi was also attacked on a few occasions, but was saved by the police running with him in plain uniform
 jail ke dinon main unke likhe khaton va lekhon se unke vichaaron kaa andaja lagata he
 He expressed grief over the distances in Indian society due to script, caste and religion
 unhone samaaj ke kamjor varg par kisi bhartiya ke prahaar ko bhi usee sakhti se sochaa jitna ki kisi angrej ke dwaara kiye gayi atyaachaar ko
 Bhagat Singh knew Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English as well as Bangla, which he learned from Batukeshwar Dutt
 unka vishwaas tha ki unki shahadat se bhartiya janata or udign ho jaayegi or aisa unke jinda rahane se shaayad hi ho paye
 That is why he refused to write an apology even after he sentenced him to death
 pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' ne apni aatmakatha main jo-jo disha-nirdesh diye the, bhagat singh ne unka aksharsh: paalan kiya
 He also wrote a letter to the British government, stating that he should be considered as a prisoner of war against the British government and instead of being hanged, he should be shot
 phaansi ke pehle 3 march ko apane bhai kultar ko bheje ek patr main bhagat singh ne likhaa tha - They care about this, what is the new tarz-e-zafa? We have this hobby, see what is the beginning of the season? dahar se kyon kafa rahen, charkh kaa kya gila karen
 Sara, where Adu is right, come! Compete
 
 His zeal can be inferred from these zealous lines
 chandrasekhar aaazaad se pehali mulaakaat ke samay jalati hui mombati par haath rakhkar unhone kasam khaayi thi ki unki jindagi desh par hi qurbaan hogi or unhone apni vah kasam puri kar dikhaayi
 "someone has told the truth, old men cannot improve
 ve to bahut hi budhimaan or samajhadaar hote hai 
 Improvements are made through the hard work, courage, sacrifice and loyalty of the youth, who do not know to be afraid and who think less and experience more
 ”~ bhagat singh The news of his death was published by the Daily Tribune of Lahore and a Daily Worker letter from New York
 iske baad bhi kai marxvaadi patron main un par lekh chape, par chunki bharat main un dinon marxvaadi patron ke aane par pratibandh laga tha isliye bhartiya buddhijiviyon ko isaki khabar nahin thi
 His martyrdom was remembered throughout the country
 dakshin bharat main periyar ne unke lekh "main naastik kyon hoon?" par apane saptahik patr kudai arasu ke 22-29 march 1931 ke ank main tamil main sampadakeey likhaa
 Bhagat Singh was praised in this and his martyrdom was seen as a victory over British imperialism
 aaj bhi bharat or pakistan kii janata bhagat singh ko azaadi ke diwane ke rup main dekhati he jisane apni javaani sahit sari jindagi desh ke liye samarpit kar di
 His life inspired the characters of many Hindi films
 kannada sahitya kaa itihaas lagbhag dedh hajaar varsh purana he
 Some literary works that were composed in the 9th century are still preserved
 kannada sahitya ko mukhyatah teen saahitiyik kaalon main baanta jaataa he- pracheen kaal, madhyakaal tathaa aadhunik kaal 
 a special feature of Kannada literature is that the three sects Jain, Veerashaiva and Vaishnava composed literature in it, showing three clear streams in the medieval period
 yadhyapi 18veen shatabdi se purv kaa adhikansh sahitya dharmik tha, kintu kuch asampradayik sahitya bhi rachaa gaya
 Among the small and big texts written on the history of Kannada literature, the following are the main ones: in itihaason main kannada sahitya ke itihaas kaa kalvibhaajan bhinn-bhinn aadhaaron par kiya gaya he
 Some have considered the Jain era from the middle of the 12th century, the "veerashaiva era" from the middle of the 12th century to the middle of the 15th century, the "brahmin era" from the middle of the 15th century to the first half of the 19th century and beyond
 ; And according to some scholars, the early period up to the 10th century is called dharma-prabhava-kaal, Ragale, Shatapadi and Navinakal
 yah nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki ab tak likhe gaye kannada sahitya ke itihaason main dow aar
es
 The Kannada literature book written by Mughal is the best in many respects
 at: yah kah sakate he ki mughali kaa kalvibhaajan sarvaadhik maanya he jo is prakaar he– Prof
 Mughali, after naming the era as the most talented poet of each era, has broadly divided all literature into Marg Yuga, Transition Yuga, Deshi Yuga
 "kavirajmarg", kannada kaa pratham uplabdh granth he
 Written in the Champu style, this ritual is primarily based on the "poetry" of Dandi
 iskaa rachanakaal san 815-877 ke bich mana jaataa he
 Scholars differ in whether Rashtrakuta Chakravarti of its author Manyakhet was a Nripatung himself or a court poet
 dow mughali kaa yah mat he ki iske lekhak nripatung ke darbari kavi shrivijay the
 The major theme of Kaviraj Marg is ornamentation
 granth teen parichchhedon main vibhajit he
 In the second and third passages, the terms and phrases respectively are represented with examples
 pratham pachhid main kavy ke doshadosh kaa vichaar kiya gaya he
 Also, sound, rasa, bhava, southern and northern poetry, poetic purpose, literary work, nature of literature etc
 are briefly introduced
 kannada bhashaa, kannada sahitya, kannada pradesh, karnataka kii janata kii samskruti aadi kai baton kii drushti se kaviraj maarg ek atyant mahatvapurn granth he
 The second book of this period is "vaddaradhane" in which proverbs of 19 Jain legends are depicted in prose
 iske lekhak tathaa rachanakaal ke sambandh main yahi samajha jaataa he ki shivakotyacharya naamak jain kavi ne ise san 900-1070 ke bich rachaa tha
 It is composed on the basis of Prakrit's treatise called "bhagavatiyaradhana" and has the qualities of good poetry
 is granth kii sabase badi mahatta yah he ki isamen kannada ke gadhy kaa sarvapratham rup praapt hota he
 Apart from the above two texts, no other texts of this period have been available till now
 kannada sahitya ke itihaas main pump kaa kaal vishesh mahatvapurn he, jo "swarnyug" ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 The other name of this period is "jain era", because Jain henchmen poets had a special hand in the growth of Kannada literature during this period
 in jain kaviyon main prayek ne pradhanthya do prakaar ke kavy rache–ek jain dharm sambandhi kavy athwa dharmik kavy kii vastu kisi tirthakar yaa mahapurush kii kahani hoti thi or loukik kavy main puranic kaavyon ke kathankon kaa chithran hota tha
 Thus, the purpose of creating two texts was to propagate the elements of another Jainism and on the other hand to attract people to their religion by presenting a copy of popular Sanskrit epics in Kannada
 ye jain kavi sanskrit, praakrit tathaa apbhransh bhashaaon ke vidvan the, sahityashastra ke marmajna the or pratibhasampann kavi bhi
 These poets, with the necessary changes, made the mythological narratives compatible with their religion, but maintained their interestingness by not destroying their originality
 jain kaviyon kii rachanaaon se kannada bhashaa or sahitya kaa bada upkaar hua
 During this period, there was a special promotion of Champu poetry
 is samay ke dharmik kaavyon main adbhoot tathaa shant or loukik kaavyon main vir tathaa raudra rason kii vishesh rup se abhivyanjana hui
 In addition to the above two types of poetry, texts were written on various topics like verses, rasa, ornament, grammar, dictionary, astrology, vaidyak etc
 is prakaar is yug main kannada sahitya kii sarvatomukhi unnati hui
 There were three famous poets of this era - Pampa, Ponn and Ranna who are famous as "rannatrayi"
 mahakavi pump athwa aadi pump ne do kavy rache–"adipurana" or "vikramarjunvijay" athwa "panpabharat"
 The Adipuran depicts the biography of the first Tirthankara Vrishabhanatha based on the Jinasenacharized Sanskrit Purana and the "vikramarajunvijay" depicts the plot of the Mahabharata
 ye donon champookavy hai
 The pumps are considered to be the original poets of Kannada
 inkaa samay san 941 ke lagbhag mana jaataa he
 Ponn was a contemporary of Pampa
 unhone teen granth rache the–"shantipurana", "jinaksharmala" tathaa "bhuvanakaramabhyuday"
 The last book is not available
 rann kii mukhya rachanaayen do hai– "ajitpurana" tathaa "saahas bhimavijay" athwa "gadayuddh"
 The hero of Gadayudh is Bhima
 gadayuddh main viraras kii anuthi vyanjana hui he
 With this poetry, Ranna's fame has become immovable
 pump yug ke anya kaviyon main choundary, nagvarm, durgasingh, chandraraj, nagachandra, nagvarm aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Chaundarai's "chaundarayuparan" is a beautiful specimen of ancient Kannada prose
 nagvarm pratham ke do granth praapt hue hai– "karnataka kandabari" tathaa "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" is the Kannada model of Kadambari of Baan
 yah champu style main he
 Prof
 Mughali is of the opinion that Kannada has the best of the translated texts in the Carnatic Kadambari of Nagavarma - Chandraraj and Sridharacharya are contemporary poets of Nagavarma
 chandraraj kaa kaamshaastra par likhaa hua "madanatilak" naamak granth or shridharacharya kaa "jatakatilak" naamak jyotish granth, donon uttam kritiyaan hai
 It was during this period that Durgasingh, who was a poet of the Bhagavata sect, introduced the Sanskrit "panchatantra"
 11veen or 12veen shatabdiyon ke bich ek anya prasiddh kavi hue, jinka naam nagachandra tha
 As he composed the Ramayana after getting inspiration from Pamparabharata, he got another name "abhinav Pampa"
 nagachandra ne bhi purvavarti jain kaviyon kii bhanti do kavy rache–"mallinathpurana" tathaa "ramchandracharitpurana" athwa "panparamayana"
 Pamparamayan is the oldest of the available Ramakatha poems of Kannada
 panpyug main mahakaviyon kaa aavirbhaav hua or unhone apni mahaan kritiyon se kannada ko samrudh banaaya
 Although large artistic adult poems were produced in this period, literature was not in contact with the lives of ordinary people of the society
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki is samay ke kavi raajaaon ke aashray main rahete the or ve jo kuch likhte the, yaa to apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yash gane ke liye likhte the yaa darbar ke anya panditon ke bich vaahvahee lutane ke liye athwa apane dharm kaa prachaar karne ke liye
 As a result, the colloquial language was not considered suitable for the literature surgeon
 sarvatra sanskrit kaa prabhaav padaa
 The adult poems composed in the Champu style were limited to the pundits, not the object of the general public
 12 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh se 15veen shatabdi tak kaa kaal basav yug kehalaata he
 The second name of this era is "revolution"
 is samay karnataka main dharmik, saamaajik yaa raajnneetik, aisa koi kshetra nahin tha jo kranti se achoota rah sakaa ho
 The revolutionaries of this revolution were Basava, Basavan or Basaveshwara, hence the name of this era was Basava era
 is kaal main sanskritnishtha kannada ke sthaan par bolchaal kii kannada sahitya ke nirmaan ke liye uparyukt samajhi gai or sanskrit kii kavyastylee ke badale deshi chhandon ko vishesh protsaahan diya gaya
 In the last centuries, the Jain fraternities had all rights in the literary field
 is yug main bhinn-bhinn mataavalambiyon ne sahitya ke nirmaan main yoga diya
 Devotion became a strong driving force in the growth of literature
 12veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main basaweshwar kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He created a great upheaval in the religious and social life of Karnataka by the re-organization of the Veerashaivism
 basav tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne apane mat ke prachaar ke liye bolchaal kii kannada ko madhyam banaaya
 The Veerashaiva devotees recounted their experiences in devotion, knowledge, quietness, virtue and policy in the style of niradambara, which became popular in the name of prabandh literature
 in virshaiv bhakton athwa shivasharanon ke vachan ek prakaar ke gadhygit hai
 Shiva Sharan did not create literature for literature
 unka mukhya uddeshy apane vichaaron kaa prachaar karnaa hi tha
 He had simplicity in his thoughts, truth and a sense of genuine curiosity
 isliye unki vaani main saahitiyik saushthav apane aap aa gaya
 The words of these Shiva Sharanas did the same thing in Karnataka that Kabir and his followers did in North India
 basav ne bhakthi kaa upadesh diya or is bhakthi kii sadhana main vaidic karmkand, murtipuja, jati panti kaa bhedbhaav, avatharavaad, andhashraddha aadi ko baadhak tehraaya
 He sought to make the path of spiritual means universal by building a casteless, colorless, classless society
 basav ke samakaleen virshaiv bhakton main allamprabhu, akkamahadevi, chenn-bansav tathaa siddharam pramukh hai
 In addition to these utterances Shiva Sharan, there were many such poets who presented poetic texts of devotional form using native verses
 12veen or 13veen shatabdiyon ke bich teen shreshth kavi hue harihar, raghavank or padmaras
 Names of Chandra, Bandhuvarma, Jann, Mallikarjuna, Keshiraj, Rattakavi and Kumudendu Muni are notable among the Jain poets of this period
 13veen shatabdi main karnataka kii dharmik sthiti main phir se uthal puthal hui
 On the one hand, Karnataka was influenced by the Srivaishnava sect founded by Ramanujacharya and on the other hand there was a new wave of devotion to Madhvacharya's dualism
 in donon vaishnav sampradaayon dwaara chalaai gai bhaktidhaara se kannada sahitya main nutan shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 As a result, the narratives of mythological epics were represented in Kannada in a purely original form
 is avadhi main rudrabhatt naamak ek vaishnav kavi hue jinka "jagannathavijay" kannada kaa sarvapratham vaishnav prabandh kavy mana jaataa he
 It is written in the Champu style and its narrative is related to Krishna
 15veen shatabdi se 19veen shtabdi ke ant tak kaa kaal kumarvyas yug kehalaata he
 During this period, the emperors of Vijayanagar and the kings of Mysore shared a special hand in the growth of Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm kii pratishtha badi jisaki pratikriya kannada sahitya main bhi dikhaai padi
 Bhakti propagated by Vaishnava religion appeared as a driving force in literature
 sahitya janata ke ati nikat sampark main aayaa
 The best poet of this period is Narnapp who became famous due to his popularity with the designation of "kumaravayas"
 kumarvyas bhagwat sampradaay ke pramukh kavi the
 There are differences among scholars regarding the birth date, birthplace of Narnapp or Kumaravyas and their creation
 pro mughali ke anusaar 14veen or 15veen shatabdiyon ke bich kumarvyas jivit the
 Kumaravyas is said to have written two poems called "kannada Bharat" or "gadugin Bharat" and "airavat"
 lekin airavat ke unki kriti hone main andeh prakat kiya gaya he
 "kannada India" depicts the story of the first ten festivals of the diffused Mahabharata
 yadhyapi pump ne apane "panpabharat" dwaara mahabharat kii sari katha kaa kannada praturup prastut kiya tha to bhi vah kumarvyas ke kannadabharat kii tarah lokapriy nahin ho sakaa
 There are two reasons for this - one is that there was a tendency towards pandityapradarshan in Pamparabharata and secondly that Jainism was also colored in it
 kumarvyas ke kannadabharat ke uparaant mahabharat, ramayana or bhagwat ke kathankon ke aadhaar par bahut se uttam kavy shatpadi style main prastut kiye gaye
 Following the path shown by Kumaravayas, a poet named Narhari or Kumaravalmiki composed "torveramayana" in Kannada based on Valmiki Ramayana
 yah bhi bhaktipradhan prabandh kavy hai, jo pracheen kannada kii ek saras kalakriti he
 Among the Bhagwat matavalambi poets, the names of Timman Kavi, Chatu Vitthalnath, Lakshmish and Nagaras are notable
 kumarvyas se prerana paakar timmann kavi ne mahabharat ke antim aath parvo kii katha kaa nirupan "krishnaraj bharat" naamak apane kavy main kiya
 The Kannada padyanuvad of the overall Bhagavata was first presented by a Bhagavata poet named Chatu Vitathalnath
 lagbhag isi kaal main ek atyant pratibhasampann kavi hue jinka naam lakshmish tha
 His written "jaminibharata" is a unique poem in which some interesting episodes of the Mahabharata are described as beautiful and touching
 lokapriyata kii drushti se karnataka main kumarvyas ke bharat ke baad jaiminibharat kaa sthaan he
 The poet named Nagarasa presented the Kannada verse of Bhagavad Gita called "vasudevakathamrutasara"
 jis prakaar is avadhi main kumarvyas, kumaravalmiki, lakshmish jaise bhagwat sampradaay ke kaviyon ne bharat, ramayana, bhagwat aadi mahakavyon se kathavstu lekar kannada main bhaktipradhan prabandh kaavyon kaa pranayan kiya, usee prakaar madhvamtavlambee bhakton ne bolchaal kii kannada main geet, bhajan, kirthan rachakar bhakthi kaa sandesh karnataka ke ghar-ghar pahunchaaya
 The tradition of these devotees began in the 13th century by Narharitirtha
 is samay in bhakton kii ek badi mandali jute gai thi jo pradhanthya do bhaagon main vibhajit thi
 One party was named "vyasakuta" and the other was "daskut"
 in donon main antar yahi tha ki ve bhakt vyasakut ke kehalaate the jo adhikansh brahman the or jo apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti ke liye sanskrit ko hi upyukt samajhate the, evam ve bhakt daskut ke maane jate the jinamein sabhi jatiyon ke log sammilit the or jo kannada ke madhyam se bhajan, kirthan rachate the
 There was no difference between the devotees of "vyasakuta" and "daskut" in the elements of the sect
 in donon dalon ke bhakt karnataka main haridas ke naam se prasiddh hai
 These Haridas filled the stock of Kannada literature by creating thousands of verses in the subjects of devotion, knowledge, virtue, policy, love, public behavior, etc
, but in grammatical Kannada
 haridaason kii parampara 18veen shatee tak chalati he
 The songs of Haridas have had a deep and wide impact on the Kannada people
 in haridaason main purandardaas, kanakadas, jagannathdas aadi pramukh hai
 Some 17th century Vaishnava poets created excellent poems in the 17th century, under the shelter of King Chikdevaraya of Mysore
 in kaviyon main thirumalarya, chikupadhyaay, singrarya, honnamma, helvan katte giriammaa, mahalingrang kavi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 At the same time, for the first time, the influence of the Sri Vaisnava sect was directly visible in Kannada literature
 chikadevaraay "binnap" tathaa "gitagopal" naamak apni rachanaaon main thirumalarya ne shrivaishnav sampradaay ke saath-saath aikantik bhakthi kaa nirupan kiya he
 "hadivadeyadharma" is a beautiful poem of Honnamma in which Satidharma is described in Pranjal language
 mahalingrang kavi ke likhe "anubhavamrutt" main shankar ke advait siddhant kaa saar saras kannada main prastut kiya gaya he
 Chikdevaraya himself was a good poet
 is yug main virshaiv mataavlambee bhakton evam kaviyon ne bhi naanaa prakaar ke granth rachakar kannada kii seva kii
 Some of these centuries are written in style
 vachan style ke atirikt kuch gadhy granth bhi likhe gaye or saangtya, tripadi, vrutt, champu, geet aadi chhandon kaa vishesh prayog kiya gaya
 But the number of pledges in this long period are numbered
 charitkavy prastut karanevaale virshaiv kaviyon main chamras, viroopaksh pandit or shadakshardev agraganya the
 Among the poems written by Chamaras, "prabhulingalele" is the best character
 "prabhulingalile" main allam prabhu ke jeevanavrutt kaa vistaar kiya gaya he
 Among the Veerashaiva poets, Chamaras are named after Harihara with respect for those who composed the best poetry of poetry
 viroopaksh pandit kaa likhaa hua chennabasav puraana bhi uttam prabandh kavy he, jisamen prasiddh virshaiv bhakt chennabasav kii kahani kahi gai he
 Harihara's "basavarajaragale" and Chamaras's "prabhulingalele" have not been able to do as well as "chennabasavapurana", as the beautiful syncretism of poetry and poetry is done
 pump yug main jain kaviyon ne apane shreshth prabandh kaavyon ke dwaara kannada main champustyli ko atyant lokapriy banaaya
 But later this style became less used
 kumarvyas yug main phir se yah style apanaai gai
 The poet who adopted it was not Veerashaiva but Jain
 17veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main shadakshardev naamak ek pratibhasampann virshaiv kavi ne champustyli main teen prabandh kavy rache jinke naam "rajasekharvilas", "shabarshankarvilas", tathaa "vrishabhendravijay" hai
 "rajashekharvilas" and "shabarshankarvilas", narrate stories related to Shivlila
 "vrishabhendravijay" kii kathavstu basav kaa jeevanavrutt he
 This era saw the incarnation of a great Veerashaiva saint
 unka asli naam kya tha, iskaa kuch pataa nahin laga he
 His literary surname was "omniscient"
 inhone "tripadi" naamak chand main apni amrit vaani sunai he
 Each stanza ends with the word "omniscient" and has an independent meaning like the couplets of Hindi
 is avadhi main jain dharm kaa prabhaav lupt ho chalaa tha
 Nevertheless, some Jain poetic poets served Kannada with their power
 jain kaviyon ne prachlit deshi kavyaneleyon main kavyrachana kii
 Among such poets, the names of Bhaskar, Terkanambi, Bommaras, Shishyamayana, Trithayamangaras, Salva Kavi and Ratnakarvarni are notable
 inamen ratnakarvarni sarvshereshth hai, jinaki kritiyon main "bharteshvaibhav" mukhya he
 The description of the bright characters of Bharat and Bahubali, the son of the first Tirthankar Adidev, is the story of "bharateshvaibhav"
 pant, harihar, kumarvyas jaise kannada ke mahakaviyon kii shrenee main ratnakarvarni kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he
 There were some good poets in the last of this era ie in the 19th century
 devchand naamak jain kavi ne "ramakathavatar" likhakar jain ramayana parampara ko aage badhaayaa
 Kempunarayana and Basavappa Shastri among the court poets of King Mummudi Krishnaraja Odier of Mysore created a conducive atmosphere for the production of drama literature in Kannada by presenting translations of some plays in Sanskrit and English
 kalidas ke shakuntal aadi naatakon kaa basavapp shastri ne itani safalataa se anuwaad kiya ki ve "abhinav kalidas" ke naam se prasiddh hue
 Kempunarayan wrote a historical novel titled "mudramanjush"
 nandavansh kii kahani isaki kathavstu he jisapar mudrarakshas kaa prabhaav lakshith hota he
 This is the first novel of Kannada
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main muddan naamak ek safal kavi hue jinhone teen saras kavy likhe : "adbhut ramayana", "rampattabhishek" or "ramashwamedh"
 "awesome Ramayana" and "ramashvamedha" are both prose texts
 inke gadhy kii yah visheshta he ki pracheen kannada kii praudhata evam madhurata ke saath-saath aadhunik kannada kii saralata kaa parichay miltaa he
 The late 19th century is very important in the history of Indian life
 chunki is samay samaan paristhitiyon tathaa prabhaavon se sara bhartiya jivan mathit tathaa andolit hua tha, at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik kannada sahitya kii gatividhi kii kahani anya pradeshik bhashaaon ke sahitya kii kahani se kuch bhinn nahin hai
 Modern Kannada literature can be divided into four main parts which are as follows: aadhunik kannada kaa pratham utthan gadhy ke saath prarambh hota he jiske nirmaan main isai mishnariyon kii seva ullekhneey he
 In 1809, the Reverend William Carey is said to have presented a translation of the Bible
 lagbhag 1831 main balneri tathaa mangalore main mishnariyon dwaara mudranalay sthapit kiye gaye jinke kaaran kannada granthon kii chapai main sahaayta mili
 Kannada Bible, published in 1823, is the first prose book of modern Kannada
 taduparant isai padariyon ne apane dharm ke prachaar ke hetu kannada main patrapatrikas prakashit karai jinamein "sabhaptr", "satyadipike", tathaa "karnataka" mukhya hai
 In the last three decades of the 19th century important work was done for the promotion of Kannada language and literature
 idhar dakshin karnataka main karnataka ke raajaaon ke protsaahan ke falswaroop karnataka main praachya pustkaalay tathaa udhar dharwar main karnataka vidyavardhak sangh kii sthapana hui
 The work of collecting, editing and publishing ancient inscriptions and manuscripts started on behalf of these two institutions

 narsinhachaar ne anathak praytn karke "di epigraphia karnatika" kaa baarah bhaagon main prakaashan karaayaa
 Rice edited an ancient grammatical treatise called "shantanushasan" of Bhattakunk and in his preface the outline of the history of Kannada literature was presented for the first time in English
 mangalore ke basel mishan ke tatwadhan main reverend eff
 kittal naamak ek german padri ne 18 varsh nirantar parishram karke kannada panditon ke sahyog se "kannada angreji brihatkosh" prakashit karaayaa, saath hi kannada ke pracheen granthon kaa sangrah evam sampadan kaary prarambh kiya
 In the same period text books were published by the University of Madras at Fort St
 College for the purpose of teaching Kannada
 is prakaar yadhyapi kannada bhashaa tathaa sahitya ke punaruddhar ke liye stuty udyog hua, to bhi skool kalejon main shiksha kaa madhyam angreji hone ke kaaran kannada ke prati janata main jaisaa aadar hona chahie tha vaisaa nahin utpann hua
 The period from 1900 to 1921 AD is a period of more definite and varied achievements
 pehali baar or
 narhinsaachaar ne san 1907 main kannada sahitya kaa ek brihat itihaas "karnataka kavicharite" teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya jisamen ek sahasr varsho ke kannada ke samast kaviyon tathaa unki kritiyon kaa pramanik itivrutt prastut ho gaya
 Although it cannot be said that poets and poetry have been evaluated in this history on the basis of modern criticism method, yet it is certain that a definite cornerstone by the "carnatic Kavichritte" for the study, teaching and research work of Kannada literature

 Thus in the first rise, Rice's publication of "the Epigraphia Carnatica" began the historical study of literature from a modern perspective and the creation of the "carnatic Poetry of Narcissism" set a definite backdrop for the critical study of the lives and works of Kannada writers
 Hui

 In the shelter of these two institutions, a new environment was presented for the promotion of Kannada language and literature

 At the same time, Khasi circles of poets were established in various parts of Karnataka, expressing the love of the earth and the full spirit of nationalism
 pragatha, visapika, geetikavy, sonet geet or bhajan, varnanaatmak kavita, khandakavy, virakavy, romance, darshanik kavita, gadhygit or swaagatbhaashan–ye or anya kavyavibhag utkrisht anand or ucch prerana se viksit hue
 Kuvenpu and Ambikatanayadatta can be called the best among the poets of this group in terms of depth, generality and magnitude of works
 lagbhag bees kavitaasangrah tathaa ramayandarshan naamak atukant mahakavy kuvempu kii amar kirti ke aadharastambh hai
 Primarily Bendre has composed the song
 "gari", "sakhigit", "nadalile", "arul marul" unke geetsangrahon main mukhya hai
 The progressive movement which originated in 1930 had a profound impact on the literature of this time
 kavita ke kshetra main bhi nai shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 New verses and new compositions were established
 aadhunik kannada sahitya main choti kahani sabase adhik lokapriy he
 Maasti Venkatesh Iyengar is considered the father of modern Kannada story literature
 unki kahaniyon main darshaniktaa, deshbhakti, aitihaasikta, gramin jivan ke chitra, manovaigyanik vishleshan, paariwarik chithran aadi tatwon kaa bada hi sundar samavesh hua he
 From the point of view of the object and craft of the story, the development of Kannada story clearly shows this time

 Just as the original forms of Hindi drama literature and theater are found in the form of Ramlila, Krishnalila, Rasdhari mandalis, the original form of drama and theater of Kannada is found in the form of "yakshagana", "bayalat", "tammadale"
 yakshagan ke liye likhe gaye naatak praaia: padya main paae jate hai
 Singararya's "mitravinda Govind", written in 1680 under the ancient literature of Kannada, is considered the first drama of Kannada

 anuwaad karne kii kala main basavappa shastri ne itani safalataa pai ki unhen karnataka ke tatkaaleen maharajane "abhinav kalidas" kii oopaadhi se puraskrit kiya
 Later, famous plays of English began to be translated

 is dhara ke lekhakon par ramakrishna paramhans, vivekanand evam arvind ke jeevandarshan kaa gaharaa prabhaav lakshith hota he
 The creations of this group have merged with opposing elements like intellectualism and mysticism, aestheticism and socialism, karma and knowledge
 is prakaar vividh vichaardhaara ke lekhakon ne sahitya kii vibhinn vidhaon ke madhyam se kannada bharti ko sajaayaa he
 One of the synopsis of the literature which has been created by these various ideologies has been published a humanistic bright biography, which will surely have a wider impact over time
 paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaasha kosh, "glassri" kaa pratishbd he
 "glassery" is basically derived from the word "gloss"
 "glos" greek bhashaa kaa glossa he jiskaa praarambhik arth "vaani" tha
 Later it became a sign of "language" or "dialect"
 aage chalakar isamen or bhi arthparivartan hue or iskaa prayog kisi bhi prakaar ke shabd ke liye hone laga
 The collection of such words is "glossary" or "definition Dictionary"
 gyaan kii kisi vishesh vidha main prayog kiye jane vaale shabdon kii unki paribhaasha sahit suchi paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaashik shabdkosh kehalaati he
 For example, the words and their definitions in the study of mathematics are called the terminology of mathematics
 paribhaashik shabdon kaa prayog jatil vichaaron kii abhivyakti ko sucharu banaata he
 Mahaviracharya has said in the first chapter of 'mathewasarasangraha' called 'cognates': iske baad unhone lambaai, kshetrafal, aaytan, samay, sona, chaandi evam anya dhaatuon ke maapan kii ikaayiyon ke naam or unki paribhaasha diya he
 After this, names and definitions of mathematical operations are given and other mathematical definitions are given
 dwibhashik shabdaawalee main ek bhashaa ke shabdon kaa duusari bhashaa main samanarthak shabd diya jaataa he va us shabd kii paribhaasha bhi kii jaati he
 In terms of meaning, the vocabulary of a language is of two types - general vocabulary and terminology
 aise shabd jo kisi vishesh gyaan ke kshetra main ek nishchit arth main prayukt hote hai, vah paribhaashik shabd hote hai or jo shabd ek nishchit arth main prayukt nahin hote vah saamaanya shabd hote hai
 Famous scholar Acharya Raghuveer explains the difference between technical and simple words in very simple words - paribhaashik shabdon ko spasht karne ke liye anek vidwaanon ne anek prakaar se paribhaashaayen nishchit karne kaa praytn kiya he
 According to Dr
 Raghuveer Singh - dow bholanath tiwari 'anuwaad' ke sampadakeey main ise or spasht karte hue kehete hai- The tradition of terminology is believed to be from Philatus in "encyclopaedia Britannica" and elsewhere
 inkaa kaal teesri sadi i

 he
 He stored the terminology titled "atakta"
 kintu vastut: shabdaawalee kaa itihaas ab bahut peeche chalaa gaya he or ab tak praapt pracheenatam shabdaawalee hittit bhashaa kii he, jiskaa samay isa se praaia: 1000 varsh purv se bhi aage hai
 The oldest terminology in India is found in Nighuntu form
 sanskrit bhashaa main vikaas ke kaaran jab vaidic sanskrit logon ke liye duruh siddh hone lagi to vaidic shabdon ke sangrah kiye gaye, jinhen "nighantu" kii sangya di gai
 The Nighantu available today is that of Yasakacharya, but there is ample evidence of the belief that there were 4-5 more such Nighantu in Yask's time
 yask kaa samay 8veen sadi i
 pus
 mana gaya he
 This means that the term that Western scholars consider Philatus to be the oldest is at least 4-5 hundred years later than Indian nineteenths
 europe main jo shabdaawaliyaan prarambh main sangruhit kii gayi, ekabhashik thim kintu baad main bahubhashik shabdaawaliyon kii parampara chali
 The oldest known bilingual terminology in Europe is of Latingreek, whose collectors have been considered philoxenes, although it has been proven that this work was not originally theirs
 iskaa kaal mote rup se chhathi sadi i
 he
 It is mentioned that in the Encyclopडियाdia Britannica etc
 it is considered to be the oldest multilingual vocabulary, but in fact the Hittite terminology mentioned backwards is trilingual, not only bilingual
 is prakaar pracheenatam bahubhashik shabdaawalee kaa kaal latin-greek se lagbhag dedh hajaar varsh peeche he
 greek-latin latin-greek vocabulary was formed around 1000 AD
 bharat main bahubhashik shabdaawalee kii parampara bahut puraani nahin he
 The former of the Amarkosh - such as Katya's "namamala", Bhaguri's "trikand", Amaradatta's "amarmala" or Vachaspati's "shabarnava" etc
 - and the latter - Purushottam Dev's "harvali" and "trikandakosh", Halayudh's "abhidhana Ratnamala" "yadavprakash's" Vyjanti "etc
 are monolingual
 praakrit apbhransh - jaise dhanpalkrit "pand lachchhinammala", hemchandra kii "deshinammala" tathaa gopal, dron aadi ke deshi "kosh" evam hindi ke puraane kosh - jaise nandadaas, banarsidas, badridaas, haricharandas, chetanvijay, vinayasagar aadi kii "nammala", prayagdas kii "shabdaratnavali" yaa haricharandas kaa "karnabharan" aadi-usee parampara main, arthath ekabhashik shabdaawaliyaan hai
 Perhaps the last book in this tradition is the "umravakosh" of Suvansh Shukla
 bharat main ekaadhik bhashaaon kii shabdaawaliyon kii parampara musalamaanon se aarambh hoti he
 Its most famous book is "khalikbari", which contains Hindi, Farsi, Turkish words
 khalikabaari parampara main is prakaar ke kai granth likhe gaye, jinamein sabase prasiddh rachana amir khusron kii kahi jaati he, yadhyapi is sambandh main paryaapt vivaad he
 According to many scholars, Khalikbari is the creation of a "khusroshah", which was much later than the famous poet Khusro
 shivaji ne bhi raajnneeti kii farsi-sanskrit shabdaawalee banaai thi, jisamen lagbhag 1500 shabd the
 After that, many hindi-persian dictionaries were written in the Khalikbari tradition

 It is noted that despite this tradition, these lexicons are outside the range of terminology
 ab bahubhashik shabdaawaliyon kii parampara bahut viksit ho gai he tathaa idhar 3-4 se lekar 10-12 bhashaaon kii vibhinn vishyon kii shabdaawaliyaan prakashit hui hai
 In this direction, England, USA, Germany, France and Russia have done enough labor

 There is no doubt that the vocabulary has developed in the form of shells, but the two are not one
 donon main antar yah he ki shabdaawalee main ek yaa adhik bhashaaon ke shabdon kaa sangrah rahata he, kintu kosh main shabdon kaa arth yaa unki vyakhya aadi bhi rahati he
 Apart from bilingual or multilingual dictionaries of various disciplines in the arts, commerce, science, etc
, synonyms and antonyms also fall under the same vocabulary
 madhyayugin hindi sahitya kaa "nammala" sahitya is drushti se ullekhya he
 Now the tradition of synonyms has become very scientific and they have proved very useful for writers etc

 After this, with the efforts of Acharya Ramchandra Varma, who had long-term experience in Kosh Kala, 'authentic Hindi Dictionary' was published from Varanasi

 Meanwhile, a new revised and enhanced edition of 'hindi Shabdasagar' was published in which the total page no
