 In the Puranas, there are communal or simple teachings from the Vedic period, ideas related to creation, collection of traditional accounts and stories etc
 of ancient kings and sages, as well as the bizarre and interesting narratives of fables
 puraana us prakaar pramaan granth nahin hai jis prakaar shruti, smriti aadi hai
 In the Puranas many things are found in the form of Vishnu, Vayu, Matsya and historical circles in the Bhagavata - genealogy of kings etc
 ye vanshawaliyaan yadhyapi bahut sankshipt hai or inamen paraspar kahin kahin virodh bhi hai par hai bade kaam kii
 Historians have paid special attention to the Puranas here and they are investigating these genealogies
 'puraana' kaa shabdic arth he - 'pracheen aakhyaan' yaa 'puraani katha'
 The word 'pura' means - non-past and past
 ‘an’ shabd kaa arth hota he -kahana yaa batalaana
 The word Purana in Raghuvansh means "purana Patrapag Magannataram" and in Vedic poetry "ancient: chronicles" is given
 saanskrithik arth se hindu samskruti ke ve vishisht dharmagranth jinamein sristi se lekar pralay tak kaa itihaas-varnan shabdon se kiya gaya ho, puraana kahe jate he
 The mention of the word Purana is also found in the Vedic era including the Vedas, and hence it can be considered the most ancient
 atharvaveda ke anusaar "rich: saamani chhandansi puranan yajusha sah 11
7
2") arthath puraanon kaa aavirbhaav rik, sam, yajus oud chand ke saath hi hua tha
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the Puranavagamayya is called the Veda
 chaandogya upanishad ne bhi puraana ko veda kaha he
 In the Brihadaranyakopanishad and Mahabharata it is said that "history Puranabhyam Vedarth Mupabarhayet" means the Veda should be interpreted through the Purana
 inase yah spasht he ki vaidic kaal main puraana tathaa itihaas ko samaan str par rakhaa gaya he
 Five signs of Purana have been considered in the ancient lexicons such as the Amarakosh, etc
: canto, prefix, clan, manvantara, and hereditary
 mana jaataa he ki sristi ke rachanakarta brahmaji ne sarvapratham jis pracheenatam dharmagranth kii rachana kii, use puraana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Puranas have been guiding deities, sages, humans - all since ancient times
 puraana manushya ko dharm evam niti ke anusaar jivan vyateet karne kii shiksha dete hai
 The Puranas analyze human deeds and prevent them from committing misdeeds
 puraana vastutah vedon kaa vistaar hai
 The Vedas are written in a very complex and dry language style
 vedavyas ji ne puraanon kii rachana or punarrachana kii
 It is said, "poornat Purana" which means, which is the complement of the Vedas, ie Purana
 vedon kii jatil bhashaa main kahi gai baton ko puraanon main saral bhashaa main samajhaayaa gaya hai
 Avatarism has been revered in the Puranas
 nirgun niraakaar kii satta ko maanate hue sagun saakaar kii upasna karnaa in granthon kaa vishay he
 The Puranas have stories of sin-virtue, religion-iniquity and karma-action, keeping different goddesses in the center
 prem, bhakthi, tyaag, seva, sahansheeltaa aise maanviya gun hai, jinke abhaav main unnat samaaj kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 In the Puranas, a detailed description is found about the many forms of deities
 puraanon main satya ko pratishthit main dushkarm kaa vistrut chithran puranakaron ne kiya he
 Puranas have given a detailed account of the vicious tendencies of the deities, but the basic objective is the development of goodwill and the reputation of truth
 keval 5 matsay, vaayu, vishnu, brahman evam bhagavat puraanon main hi raajaaon kii vanshabali pai jaati he
 The Puranas are eighteen
 m-2, bha-2, br-3, va-4
 A-1, Na-1, P-1, Lin-1, C-1, Ku-1, Sk-1 According to Vishnu Purana, their names are - Vishnu, Padma, Brahma, Vayu, Bhagavata, Narada, Markandeya, Agni, Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, Garud, Universe and Future
 puraanon main ek vichitrataa yah he ki prayek puraana main atharaho puraanon ke naam or unakishlokasankhya he
 Names and verses are often found, there is a difference somewhere
 jaise kurm puraana main agni ke sthaan main vayupurana; markandeya puraana main lingapurana ke sthaan main nrisinghpurana; devibhagwat main shiv puraana ke sthaan main naarad puraana or matsay main vayupurana he
 Nowadays, two Puranas are found in the name of Bhagwat - one Shrimad Bhagwat, and the other Devi Bhagwat koun vastav main puraana he isapar jhagada rahaa he
 Ramashram Swami has proved in 'durjanmuchchapetika' that Shrimad Bhagwat is the Purana
 isapar kashinath bhatta ne 'durjanmukhmahachapetica' tathaa ek or pandit ne 'durjanmukhpadyapaduka' devibhagwat ke paksh main likhi thi
 According to Sukhsagar: puraanon main sabase purana vishnupurana hi prathit hota he
 There is no communal tussle and rage in it
 puraana ke paancho lakshan bhi usapar thik thik ghatate hai
 It describes the origin and rhythm of creation, manvantaras, Bharatadi Khandas and Suryadi Lokas, branches of Vedas and their divisions by Ved Vyasa, Surya Dynasty, Lunar Dynasty etc
 kali ke raajaaon main magadh ke maury raajaaon tathaa guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he
 The leelas of Shri Krishna are also described, but not in the form as in the Bhagavata
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki vayupurana hi shivpurana he kyonki aajkal jo shivpurana naamak puraana yaa uppurana he uski shloke sankhya 24,000 nahin he, keval 7,000 hi he
 There are four stages of Vayu Purana, which describe the origin of creation, the kalpas and manvantaras, the stories of Vedic sages, different creatures from the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, the lineage of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi kings and the kings of Kali are often described according to Vishnupurana
 matsaypurana main manwantaron or rajvanshawaliyon ke atirikt varnshram dharm kaa bade vistaar ke saath varnan he or matsaivatar kii puri katha he
 There is a special way to describe the method of killing the demons, the mother, the mother, the ancestral, the idol and the temple
 shrimadbhagwat kaa prachaar sabase adhik he kyonki usamen bhakthi ke mahatmaya or shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa vistrut varnan he
 Within the nine wings, the unity of Jeevabrahma, the importance of devotion, the creation of Srishtila, the birth of Kapiladeva and the teaching of Sanskrit in accordance with the Vaishnava sentiment towards his mother, Manvantara and Rishivamsavali, Avatar which also has the context of Rishabhdev, Dhruva, Venu, Prithu, Prahlad etc
 There are many topics like Katha, Samudramathan etc
 par sabase bada dasham skandh he jisamen krishna kii lila kaa vistaar se varnan he
 On the basis of this wing, many texts of Sanskrit and language related to Krishnacharitas have been made from Shringar and Bhaktiras
 ekadash skandh main yadavon ke naash or barahawein main kaliyug ke raachaaon ke rajtv kaa varnan he
 Bhagwat's style of writing is different from other Puranas
 isaki bhashaa paandityapurna or sahitya sambandhi chamatkaaron se bhari hui he, isse isaki rachana kuch peeche kii maani jaati he
 Agnipuran is a unique Purana, in addition to dynasties and short stories, theology, politics, rajdharma, prajadharma, ayurveda, grammar, rasa, ornamentation, archeology, etc
 are many subjects
 isamen tantradiksha kaa bhi vistrut prakaran he
 The lineage of the kings of Kali has come up to Vikram, also an avatar affair
 isi prakaar or puraanon main bhi kathaayen hai
 Apart from Vishnupurana and Puranas which are found nowadays, there is doubt about the fact that they were not created from behind if the real Puranas are not found
 kai ek puraana to mat-matantaron or sampradaayon ke raag-dwesh se bhare hai
 Some establish the primacy of a deity, some establish the supremacy of a deity, some establish someone
 brahmavaivart puraana kaa jo parichay matsaypurana main diya gaya he uske anusaar usamen rathntar kalp or varah avatar kii katha honi chahie par jo brahmavaivart aajkal miltaa he usamen yah katha nahin he
 For those devotees who were not satisfied with the Raas of Vrindavan of Krishna, there is a description of the everlasting rasa in Goloka
 aajkal kaa yah brahmavaivart musalamaanon ke aane ke kai sau varsh peeche kaa he kyonki isamen 'julaha' jati kii utpatti kaa bhi ullekh he -- mlechhat kuvindakanyaayaan jola jatirbabhuv ha 
 In the Brahmapuran, there is a lot of description of the pilgrimages and their greatness, Anant Vasudev and Purushottam Mahatmya and many such pilgrimages have been written which cannot be called ancient
 'purushottamprasaad' se avashya jagannatha ji ke vishaal mandir kii ore hi ishaara he jise gangey vansh ke raja chodganga ne banwaaya tha
 The symptoms given in the Matsya Purana are not completely found even in the present-day Padmapuran
 vaishnav sampradayikon ke dwesh kii isamen bahut si baaten hai
 Such as pāडaिलilāक्षणā ,a, māyāvādaंदाīंदाa, tamāशास्त्रāstra, puणनāvārvāणनaत्याāti
 vaisheshik, nyaay, sankhya or charvak 'taamas shaastra' kahe gaye hai or yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki daityon ke vinaash ke liye buddha rupi vishnu ne asat buddha shaastra kaha
 Similarly, Matsya, Koorm, Linga, Shiva, Skanda and Agni Tamas have been called Puranas
 saransh yah ki adhikansh puraanon kaa vartmaan rup hajaar varsh ke bheetar kaa he
 All of the Puranas are communal, there is no doubt about it
 kai puraana bahut kuch apane pracheen rup main milte hai par unamem bhi sampradayikon ne bahut si baaten badha di hai
 Although most of the Puranas found today are full of back-made or projecting subjects, Puranas were prevalent since ancient times
 brihadaaranyak or shatapath brahman main likhaa he ki geeli lakdi se jaise dhuaan alag alag nikalataa he vaise hi mahaan bhoot ke nirishwaas se rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda, atharvangiras, itihaas, puranavidya, upanishad, shloke, sutara, vyaakhyaan or anuvyaakhyaan hue
 It is also written in the Chandogya Upanishad that history is the fifth Veda in the Puranas
 atyant pracheen kaal main vedon ke saath puraana bhi prachlit the jo yajna aadi ke avasaron par kahe jate the
 Many things which are in the signs of Purana are also in the Vedas
 jaise, pehle asat tha or kuch nahin tha yah sarg yaa sristitatv he; devasur sangram, urvashi pururava samvaad itihaas he
 Even in the Adi festival of Mahabharata, the names of some kings and some topics have been mentioned and their accounts have been told in the Purana by the learned Satkavis
 isse kaha ja saktaa he ki mahabharat ke rachanakaal main bhi puraana the
 It is also written in Manusmriti that Vedas, theology, history, Puranas etc
 should be narrated in Pitrukaryas
 ab prashn yah hota he ki puraana hai kiske banaae
 It is written in Reva Mahatmya under Shivpuran that the speakers of the eighteen Puranas are Matyavatisut Vyas
 yahi baat jan saadhaaran main prachlit he
 But in the Matsyapurana it is clearly written that earlier there was only one Purana, there were 18 Puranas from that
 brahmad puraana main likhaa he ki vedavyas ne ek puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya tha
 The next thing is known from Vishnu Purana
 usamen likhaa he ki vyas kaa ek 'lomaharshan' naam kaa shishy tha jo suti jati kaa tha
 Vyas ji gave his Purana Samhita in his hands
 lomaharshan ke chah shishy the— sumati, agnivarcha, mithrayu, shanshpayan, akrutvran or saavarni
 Among these, Akitavran, Savarni and Shanshapayan created a code based on the Puranasamhita read from Lomhadisha
 vedavyas ne jis prakaar mantron kaa sangrahakar un kaa samhitaon main vibhaag kiya usee prakaar puraana ke naam se chale aate hue vritton kaa sangrah kar puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya
 With the same code, he made three more letters of the disciples of Sut
 inhen samhitaon ke aadhaar par atharah puraana bane honge
 In all the Puranas, Matsya, Vishnu, Brahmapurana has been said to be the first, but what is the Brahmapurana that is prevalent nowadays, it has been said before
 jo kuch ho, yah to upar likhe pramaan se siddh he ki atharah puraana vedavyas ke banaae nahin hai
 Among the Puranas that are found today, the composition of Vishnupurana and Brahmapurana appears to be ancient
 vishnupurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh' ke antargat guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he isse vah prakaran isa kii chhathi shatabdi ke pehle kaa nahin ho saktaa
 The Hindus of Bali island, which is next to Java, have got the universe
 in hinduon ke purvaj isa kii paanchavi shatabdi main bharatvarsh main purv ke dwipon main jaakar based the
 There is no 'future Dynasty Case' in the Baliwale Brahmadpuran, in which the name of Janamejaya's great-grandson Adhisimakrishna is found
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he
 This shows that the future dynasty in the Puranas is linked backwards
 yahan par brahmadpurana kii jo pracheen pratiyaan milti hai dekhnaa chahie ki unamem bhoot or vartmaankalik kriya kaa prayog kahan tak he
 These verses are found in 'bhavishra Dynasty' description- ukt ansh se prakat he ki aadi brahmadpurana adhisimakrishna ke samay main bana
 Similarly, examination of Vishnupuran, Matsyapuran etc
 shows that Adi Vishnupurana was compiled in the time of Parikshit and Adi Matsyapurana was collected in the time of Adhishimakrishna, the great-grandson of Janamejaya
 puraana samhitaon se atharah puraana bahut pracheen kaal main hi ban gaye the, iskaa pataa lagata he
 The evidence of the prophecy in the Apastamb Dharmasutra is cited as follows- yah avashya he ki aajkal puraana apane aadim rup main nahin milte hai
 Many Puranas have been re-created due to lack of original Puranas, many things have been added to them
 praayah sab puraana shaiva, vaishnav sampradaay or saura sampradaayon main se kisi na kisi ke poshak hai, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin
 The worship of Vishnu, Rudra, Surya etc
 started from the Vedic period, then slowly some people started giving priority to one deity, others to others
 is prakaar mahabharat ke peeche hi sampradaayon kaa sutarapaat ho chalaa
 Puranasamhita was formed at the same time
 phir aage chalakar adipurana bane jinka bahut kuch ansh aajkal paae janevaale kuch puraanon ke bheetar he
 The purpose of the Puranas was to collect old chronicles, preach through some ancient and some mythological stories, to keep Dharmabuddhi stable in the masses by narrating Devamahima and Tirthamahima
 isi se vyas ne soot jati ke ek purush ko apni sankalit adipuranasamhita prachaar karne ke liye di
 There are 63 Shalakapurushas in the Jain tradition
 puraanon main inaki kathaayen tathaa dharm kaa varnan aadi he
 Many Puranas have been composed in Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhransh and other native languages
 donon sampradaayon kaa puraana-sahitya vipul pariman main uplabdh he
 Important material of Indian history is found in these
 jain dharm main 24 puraana to tirthakaron ke naam par hai; or bhi bahut se hai jinamein tirthakaron ke alokik charitra, sab devataaon se unki shreshthata, jaindharm sambandhi tatwon kaa vistaar se varnan, falstuti, mahatmaya aadi hai
 There are also separate Padmapuran and Harivansh
 mukhya puraana hai:- jinsen kaa 'adipurana' or jinsen kaa 'arishtanemi' puraana, ravishen kaa 'padmapurana' or gunbhadra kaa 'uttarpurana'
 These Puranas are also available in Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 bharat kii samskruti, parampara, darshanik vichaar, bhashaa, style aadi kii drushti se ye puraana bahut mahatvapurn hai

 Such orders have certain standard instructions
 ve is prakaar se hai
 a stop loss is the value of a stock or index at which the transaction is closed after reaching it
 vittiya bazaar main kisi bhi kharide jane vaale share ke bhav ke upar jane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he or neeche jane kii ashanka bhi bani rahati he
 If the stock price starts to fall, then it can reach quite low
 atev share kray karte samay hi iske stop los ko tay kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a share of 100 rupees is taken, then it should be sold when it comes to 95 or 90 rupees
 isse adhik neeche bhav pahunchane par bhi ise kis keemat tak rakhana he, yaa bechnaa he; yahi stop los hota he
 According to the experts, it is more beneficial to decide about stop loss while buying shares
 yah suvidha brokar ke computer main uplabdh hoti he
 Successful and experienced stock investors always keep an eye on return estimates and stop losses
 stop los ko stop order bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the table of the rising price data of a stock, the place where the share price crosses the trend line and goes down, is the stoploss of that stock
 isi tarah mandi ke saudon main bhav jahaan trend line ko katkar upar aa jaae, vahiin un saudon kaa stoplos hota he
 When stoploss is increased or decreased with sentiment, it is called trailing stoploss
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai: The graph of the price of a stock ascending in the market from which it turns downward, the position or position is called the top or the top
 isi tarah girte hue bhav main graph jahaan se chadhana shuru kar detaa he, vahiin bottm kehalaata he
 Top and bottom have great importance in technical analysis
 yadi kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se ooncha ho, to share yaa suchakank teji ke daur main kehalaata he
 Similarly, if every next top and bottom in a chart is below the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is considered in a recession
 share ke bhav ke baar chart main kisi share ke har din ke ucchtam or nunatam bhaavon ko ek sidhi rekha se jodne par jo rekha milti he, rujhaan rekha yaa trend line kehalaati he
 The falling stock's trend line draws the line from the highest price of that stock, while the line is drawn from the lowest price to draw the trend line of the rising stock
 behatar parinaam hetu kisi ek din ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhav kii jagah kai dinon ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhaavon ke ghanatv vaale kshetron se rekha khinchi jaati he
 The trade line is extremely helpful for investors, also known as the trend is the best friend in English
 trend tuutane kaa arth hota he ki share kii chaal kii disha badalane vaali he
 That is, if the stock price is falling and the prices of the stock suddenly start coming upwards after cutting the trend line drawn from above, then it should be understood that the edge is going to start
 iske ulat agar chadhate hue share yaa index ke nichle bhav se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha keemton ke upar jane lage, to teji ke saude kaat lene chahie
 By tracking returns and estimating returns, profit-recovery is simplified when the investor is informed of financial goals
 yah is nirnay ko aasaan banaata he ki niveshak ko kisi kaarobaar vishesh main nivesh karnaa laabhprad he yaa nahin
 According to experts, if the return-risk ratio is not in favor then it should not be traded
 jaise, yadi 100 rupye ke lakshya ke saath 90 rupye kaa koi share kharidte hai or stop los 75 rupye se neeche he to ritern-jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he
 In this case, after selling the shares at the target price, they are willing to take a loss of Rs 15 per share for an expected profit of Rs 10 per share
 is tarah se ritern kii tulana main jokhim adhik he or samajhadaari he ki is share main paisa na lagaaein
 Thus stop loss information is very helpful in deciding to invest
 adhikansh vishleshkon ko lagata he ki trederon ko jokhim sahane kii kshamta ke aadhaar par stop los tay karnaa chahie

 shivaji maharaj the unke rajbhishek main bhi kai samasyaayein ain
 The first Peshwa who was a Brahmin himself publicly opposed Shivaji's Kshatriya
 usne shivaji se kaha unka rajbhishek ek kshatriya ke rup main nahin varan shudra ke rup main ho saktaa he or kuch brahaman iske liye taiyaar he
 The Brahmins made a list of known and unintentional sins committed by Shivaji, which also included cow slaughter during the war, on the basis of which punishment was imposed on them
 is prakaar 11000 brahamanon ko pariwar sahit bhojya vastra or anyasaamagree 4 maheene tak di gayi
 He considered it an insult to him
 At the time of Raj Tilak of Shivaji, he was given a golden crown and showered with precious gems and golden flowers
 brahmanon ko die gaye uphaaron ke kaaran un logo ne apane virodh ko dabaaye rakhaa
 Shivaji was purified by a Kshatriya from Shudra, a Brahmin named Ganga Bhatt taught Vedic mantra
 brahamanon ne kaha is samay sirf brahaman hi dwijati he or koi bhi kshatri jaati vaastavik nahin he apni samaaj ke is mantavya par ganga bhatta apana aap kho bataa or usne ek anushtan ko chhod diya
 Which was later done in Raigad
 ganga bhatta ko ek lakh rupaya diya gaya
 Shivaji Tilak was seen by the English factory chief Henry Oksendeng in Surat with his own eyes
 is dor is baat ko bhi bataaya jaataa he kii sivaaji ne apana hiranya garbh sanskaar karaayaa tha jisase ve shuddh kshatrya ban jaye
 Such a powerful Yodha was also lured by casteism to attain Kshatriya
 usne apana rajkosh sirf is kaary ke liye khali kar diya or sainik tayari par kuch bhi kharch nahin kiya 
 Ultimately, dissatisfied Brahmins were appeased by paying a lot of money
 kul mila kar 460 lakh rupaya kharch hua
 But the Brahmin people of Pune were still not satisfied and refused to recognize Shivaji Maharaj as king

 As early as 1714 AD, Shivaji's grandson Chhatrapati Shahuji increased his importance and powers considerably and with this the actual control of the Maratha kingdom remained confined to his family within a short time

 However, neither could he get the rights given to Ashtapradhan during Shivaji nor could it ever be revived again

 The Tutan castes indicate the tribes of Europe who speak any one of the various Tutan languages; For example - English-speaking people of the British Isles; German-speaking people from Germany, austria-hungary and Switzerland; Flemish-speaking inhabitants of Belgium, Scandinavian-speaking people of Sweden and Norway; Almost all the inhabitants of Holland and Denmark; Minorities speaking the German and Flemish languages of Italy and France, the majority of German and Swedish speakers residing in Russia, and those settled in the USA, Africa and Australasia who originally migrated from the above countries

 The common people have now forgotten the same origin

 The original men of the Tutan castes are mentioned in the quotations of the poems he has given
 un kavitaaon main "manus" naamak ek vyaktivishesh se "germany" kii teen mukhya shakhaayen utpann huin, aisa varnan he
 Genealogies of the original men of these castes are also found in ancient English paper papers
 shaareerik gathan or rang kii drushti se aaj in jatiyon main kaaphi bhinnata pai jaati he
 But these castes are today the highest and white castes in Europe
 praarambhik kaal main ye visheshtaayen bahut hi spasht raheen hongi
 The tall and tall face that is found today in the far north of Europe is found in the skeletons and skulls buried in the old cremation ground of Switzerland and its surrounding territories
 in puraane avasheshon ke aadhaar par yah kaha jaataa he ki aaj kii tuton jatiyon tathaa us samay ke inke mul purushon main bahut adhik antar nahin he
 The remains of the North Stone Age do not provide much information about these castes

 These people were advanced in terms of art and prosperity and their trade and exchange with the southern civilization was seen, it seems
 louh yug ke prarambh se keltic prabhaav badhata gaya or dakshini sabhyataa ke kendron se tyutan logon kaa sambandh dhire dhire tuutata gaya
 Residents of countries such as Germany, Holland etc
 differed from their Celtic neighbors, the evidence for this is evident from the middle of the first century BCE
 is samay roman log inhen "jarmani" naam se jaanate the
 This name is probably given by the Gaul people and was first used for certain Belgian castes living in the valley of the river Meuse
 vartmaan yug ke prarambh main tyutan jatiyaan rin se vistula tak faili hui thim
 She had wrinkled before Caesar
 lekin sijar ke akramanon ne inkaa failaav roak diya
 They were inhabited on both banks of the Rhine, but most of these castes were subjects of the Roman Empire
 sudur purv kii tyutan jati sambhavat: vistula kii ghati main rahanevaali "goth" jati thi or sudur dakshin kii tyutan jatiyaan "marcomani" tathaa "kaadi" thim jo bohemia or moravia ke pradeshon main rahati thim
 These territories were conquered by the Celtic people at the beginning of the present era
 dakshin tathaa pashchim main bhi ye log keltic logon ko dabaa rahe the or inke adhikaar main scandinavia kaa kaaphi bhaag tha
 For the first few years of the Christian period, part of Germany on the west side of the Alb River was under the control of the Romans, but after the defeat of Warus, the Roman Empire spread to the Rhine and Danube rivers
 chauthi se chhathi shatabdi tak tyutan jatiyon ne europe main kaaphi pair failaa liye the
 Some of them had won and some of them had made treaties with the Romans
 paanchavin shatabdi europe kii drushti se bahut mahatvapurn kaal he
 In these hundred years, there were many battles in Europe, many castes won many territories and Europe divided into many nations
 wandal jati ne spain jeeta, visgothon ne italy ko jitkar rome par jhanda fahraaya, dakshini subic jatiyon ne, almaani tathaa bavarian logon ne apana rajya alps tak badhaayaa, frankon ne uttari gaali liya, purvi bhaag par bergandiyanon ne kabja jamaaya, hungary main hunon kaa samrajya bana or nasht hua, britain par angl logon ne adhikaar kiya tathaa italy par austrogothon ne akraman kiya
 Thus by the end of the century most of southern and western Europe came under the control of the Tutan castes
 chhathi shatabdi main frankon ne bergandiyanon ko tathaa gaal ke visgothon ko apana mandlic banaaya, romanon ne africa par pun: adhikaar kiya, austrogothon kaa rajya ulat gaya, italy par langobardi logon ne kabja jamaaya or purvi germany ke pracheen tyutan pradesh par slavonic jatiyon ne apana samrajya kaayam kiya
 By the end of this century, the valleys of Bohemia, Lower Austria and Drev and Sev had also become Slavonic
 chhathi shatabdi ke baad dhire dhire tyutan logon kaa pradeshik rashtriyataon main vilyan hota gaya or aaj aisland kii scandinavian basti ko chhod diya jaae to europe main pratyaksh tyutan raashtra kahin bhi nahin he
 Tacitus has described the Tutan castes that used to have a king
 usne aisi bhi jatiyon kaa varnan kiya he jo -- mukhiya dwaara shasit hoti thim
 He described the rights of the Tutan kings
 uske anusaar pashchimi tyutan jatiyon par unke raja kaa bahut kam prabhaav tha
 In the past, kings of the Goth castes had considerable rights and among the Swedes, the king had universal rights
 raja ko ishwar kaa ansh samajha jaataa tha or bahut se rajvansh apni utpatti devataaon se bataate the
 The western part of Europe was very progressive due to foreign influence and the "raja" or Rajapada had already ended with the Gaal region
 tansitus ne jarmani jatiyon ke sambandh main "kancelium" athwa jaateey sabha kaa pramukhataa se varnan kiya he
 The decision of this gathering was considered to be final in matters of utmost importance
 is sabha main mukhiyon kaa chunaav hota tha, jati ke sadasyon ke viruddh gambhir abhiyogon par vichaar hota tha or tarunon kii yoddhaon main bhartee hoti thi
 The priest was responsible for initiating the proceedings and maintaining peace in the assembly
 isiliye shaayad yah sabha dharmasthanon ke nikat hoti thi or uskaa praathmik rup dharmik tha
 There is very little mention of these ethnic assemblies after Tacitus
 haan, dharmik utsavon ke tathaa mahatv ke avasaron par raja log jab darbar lagaate the to kabhi kabhi jansabhaayen hone ke ullekh milte hai
 But there is no evidence that these meetings have ever considered governance related issues
 "concelliam" ke alaava ek or sanstha bhi us samay vidyaman thi jo bahut hi mahatvapurn thi or jiskaa prabhaav tyutan jatiyon ke itihaas par shaayad sabase adhik padaa
 It was called "komitatas"
 sijar ne iskaa varnan kiya he
 When a caste leader had to undertake a new campaign, he used to call this public meeting and get followers who would support him in that campaign till the end
 raja tathaa anya pramukh log apni naukari main tarun yoddhaon kii senaayen rakhte the
 These warriors enhanced their pride in times of peace and used them in battle
 ye mrityu paryant apane swami ke prati eemaandaar rahete the
 There are many such references according to which, upon receiving Swami's exile, his dependents voluntarily supported him and went with him
 is seva ke badale main swami unhen dhan, ghodon tathaa shastron se sanmanit karata tha
 If the lord was king, he would give them land or hand over the rule of some part of his kingdom
 is prakaar sanman paanevaale log apane ladakon ko bhi swami kii seva main laga dete the
 In this way these jagirs and authority became ancestral to those dynasties
 inhen main se jagirdaar yaa sardaar tathaa duusari ore bade bade pradeshon ke governor aadi adhikariyon kaa udai hua
 At the time of the taxitas, there were three classes in the Tutan society
 ucch vansh ke log, swatantra log tathaa mukt log
 Later on, the description of these three classes is also found
 kahin kahin inamen se ekaadh varg gaayab bhi rahata he
 For example, there is no description of the upper class in the Frank race and the free class does not appear in other Anglosaxon states except the state of Kent
 ye varg vanshaparamparaagat hote the or inke bhinn bhinn adhikaar tathaa suvidhaayen hoti thim
 The main authority or feature of these was the "value of man"
 prayek varg kaa alag alag mulya hota tha
 When a man was killed, it was the duty of his family, dependents or masters to avenge the murder
 lekin ghayal hone kii avasthaa main aakraamak ko harjane ke rup main ek nirdhaarit mulya dena hota tha
 According to the statement of Caesar and Tacitz, family had a prominent place in the Tutan social system
 parijanon ko sangrakshan dena, anyaay kaa pratikaar karne main unki madad karnaa tathaa unki hatya ke prasang main badla lenaa athwa harjaana vasuul karnaa sarvasammat kartavya samajha jaataa tha
 Therefore, the presence of a large number of family members in the civil society was considered good in terms of security and effectiveness
 jab kisi ucch varg ke athwa swatantra varg ke vyakti kii hatya ho jaati thi to nirdhaarit harjaana chukaane kii jimmedaari hatya karanevaale vyakti ke saath saath uske parivaar ke prayek parijan kii bhi hoti thi
 Similarly, on recovering the damages, he used to share the proportion of the dead person's family
 bhoomi kii vyavastha main parijan haath bantaate the
 According to Tacitas, ethnic armies were also made up of relatives
 vivaah ke sabhi saadhaaran prakaar us samay prachlit the
 But in Kent, the ancient Saxons, the Langobardi and the Burgundians, the practice of marrying by paying price was predominantly prevalent
 tasits ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vivaah ke samay var kii ore se swayan vadhoo ko shastr tathaa bail bhent kiye jate the
 This practice was prevalent in the northwestern Tutan nations from the earliest times
 vaivaahik krityon ke sambandh main vishesh jaankaree nahin milti
 But it can be said that before marriage, there was a beginning in Vagada and thereafter feast
 isai dharm sweekaar karne ke baad bhratrividhwaaon se tathaa sauteli maan se vivaah karnaa nishiddh mana jane laga
 The practice of polygamy was limited in them
 vartmaan yug ke prarambh main tyutan jatiyaan kheti karti thim athwa nahin, is sambandh main vivaad he
 Caesar considered the Germanic race to be the predominantly animal grazing race; Agriculture was his secondary work
 tasits ke anusaar krushikla us samay praarambhik avasthaa main thi
 Agriculture was cooperatively done
 sabhi pracheen lekhakon ne jarmani logon ko yoddha jati mana he
 Yet according to the Tacitas' statement, they did not know about swords and armor and armor etc
 saadhaarant: ve badi badi dhaalon, bhaalon athwa phenkakar chalaae janevaale astron kaa prayog karte the
 But perhaps this description is only of the Western castes because elsewhere he writes that some of the castes of the East had short swords and round shields
 ye shastr uttar kii jatiyon ke paas bhi the
 Some castes were famous for their cavalry
 lekin jarmani jati paidal ladanaa adhik pasand karti thim
 When the Tutan castes came in contact with the Romans in the early centuries of the present era, they had a great impact on the Tutan civilization
 unhone fal tathaa tarkariyaan ugaana siikhaa
 Put watermills
 sainik saaj samaanon tathaa shastrastron kii drushti se bhi kaaphi pragati kii
 But in disguise, they were basically Tutan - rather Celtic - Tutanic
 yutan jatiyon main likhane kii kala kii pracheenta ke sambandh main tasits ne bhavishya bataane ke liye upyog main laae janevaale pathar ke tukdon kaa zikr kiya he in tukdon par chihn khude hote the
 But it cannot be said that those symbols were actually letters
 tyutanik jatiyon kii lekhanpaddati jise "runik" kaha jaataa he chauthi shatabdi tak purna rup se viksit ho chuki thi
 After accepting Christianity, Western and Northern Teutonic nations began to use the Roman script
 prarambh main ye log apane murdon ko jalaate the
 Later he adopted the practice of burying the dead
 uttar kii ore in jatiyon main antim sanskaar kii ek vishesh pratha prachlit thi
 These people used to burn their dead on ships
 jahaajon ko tat par chadha liya jaataa tha or shavon ko unpar rakhkar aag laga di jaati thi
 There is also a mention of sending ships to sea somewhere

 Development of planning is an important requirement of every undertaking in today's era
 vyavsaayik barbaadi, durupyog va, jokhimon ko niyojan ke dwaara hi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The need and importance of planning can be explained on the basis of the following points: niyojan kaa uparyukt mahatv hote hue bhi kuch vidwaan ise 'samay evam dhan kii barbaadi athwa 'barsaati ole' kahkar iskaa virodh karte hai
 He says that business plans are prepared against the backdrop of uncertain and volatile circumstances
 jab inkaa aadhaar hi anishchit he to phir yah kai se mana ja saktaa he ki niyojan dwaara nirdhaarit baaten sadaiv shat-pratishat satya hi hongi

 iske alaava yah shodh evam anusandhan ko protsaahan degaa
 Its drawback is - long duration is difficult to predict, expensive system and difficult to analyze the effects of all elements
 prakruti ke aadhaar par niyojan ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- They remain useful for a long time
 inkaa nirdhaaran purv main kar liya jaataa he, taaki sanghathan ke kriyakalapon ko vyavastha pradaan karne ke aadhaar ke rup main kaam liya ja sake
 These increase the firm's credibility
 str ke aadhaar par niyojan ko teen bhaagon main bota ja saktaa he : Depending on the importance, planning can be divided into three parts: niyojan prakriya se aashay aisi prakriya se he jiske anusaran karne se ek prabhaavshaalee niyojan kaa nirmaan sambhav he
 Although a common process of planning for all types of enterprises cannot be determined, the following process can be followed in a rational business planning: uddeshy sanstha ke sadhano ko dhyaan main rakhkar nishchit kiye jane chahie tathaa vebodhgamy evam vaastavik hone chahie
 Objectives are the target points of the work to be done and determine the path of desired results

 It aired in the then Soviet Russia in 1976
 bharat main 1996 main dit sevaaon ko lagu karne kaa prastaav aayaa tha or 2000 main iske prasaaran aarambh hue
 Today the market has become more and more competitive for participation in the Direct to Home space, such as Dish TV, Tata Sky, Big TV, Airtel Digital, Sun Direct and Videocon d2h, etc
 in India alone
 dit seva pradaataaon ko chunate hue dhyaan yogya kuch khaas binduon kaa avashya dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Issues like picture quality, adverse weather transmission, package conformity, value added service in addition to price etc
 should be taken care of
 jisaki pradaata kii pikchar quality acchhee hogi, vah dit seva bhi utani acchhee kehalaaegi
 MPEG 4 picture quality is provided by some service providers, while some DVD quality offers digital transmission
 nayaa standard empiiji4 ke saath divibi-es-2 he, jise digital video broadcasting-duusari peedi se joda jaataa he
 This standard evolved at the same time as the H
264 video codec
 is maanak main hai-dephination quality kaa praavdhaan he
 By connecting with the Internet, the scope of its services becomes more extensive
 keval, baahar bheje jane vaale data ko duusare prasaaran tareekon se bhejne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The method of forming channels based on digital quality and value added services also needs to be seen
 prayek suvidhadaata ke aadharbhoot package main free-tu-air channel kii adhikta hoti he or usamen kuch anya channel daal die jate hai
 For a good comprehensive package in India, an option of Rs 350 would be great, under which, if you talk about the price per channel, then the full value of money can be recovered
 iske jariye kuch pe-par-vyuu filmein or sakriy sevaaon tak bhi pahunch banegi
 Apart from this, DTH providers are also offering attractive entry facilities, which include the cost of installation and hardware
 dit seva pradaata aise channel uplabdh karaate hai, jahaan pe-par-vyuu filmein nirdhaarit aarambhik samay main dikhaai jaati hai
 It is important to note here that how many channels are showing films on demand, it is more important than what kind of films they show
 kuch seva pradaata samayik content dete hai, to kuch par puraani filmein dikhaai jaati hai
 Most service providers provide interactive services, in which you can contact the services
 udhaaharan ke liye kooking sho dekhte samay upabhokta ke paas pop-ap hota he, jiske anusaar kisi khaas batan ko dabaakar ve us racippi vishesh ko dekh sakate hai athwa kisi quij channel ko dekh sakate hai
 Some DTH service providers such as Dish TV provide marriage source or job service web sites, etc
 content from online sources
 iske alaava airtel, vijat sthapit karne kii suvidha detaa he, jo mausam, stock apadet, bracring news, sports aadi jaankaree va khabaren ek batan dabaane maatr se uplabdh karaata he, iske liye mukhya screen se dur hatane kii jarurat bhi nahin hogi
 The form of electronic programming guide that guides the consumer in the ocean of programming is also required
 udhaaharan ke liye big tivi guide main channel ko alfabet ke anusaar athwa number ke rup main vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 Videocon provides the interface in multilingual and consumers have the option to customize the screen to some extent
 ek acha interphes, aapako advance main hi kam se kam saat din pehle aane vaale programs ke bare main jaankaree uplabdh karaata he
 What is currently going on and many other features are also included
 cabel network se dit kii tulana karen to taar dwaara prasaarit hone ke kaaran cabel network kii pahunch lagbhag mahanagaron or bade shaharon tak hi simit he; jabaki dit kii pahunch mahanagaron shaharon ke saath-saath sudur gramin kshetron tak bhi utani hi sulabh he
 While cable networks still provide analog-based broadcasting to viewers, the technology provided by the DTH service provides excellent audio-visual quality, which the cable service cannot provide under any circumstances
 dit kii sabase badi khubi he ki iske dwaara upabhoktaaon ko aavashyaktaa ke anusaar channel chunane or unka bhugtan karne kii swatantraaa milti he
 This is in contrast to the cable operator's service, where viewers are obliged to pay monthly fees regardless of the number of channels or service quality
 dit plateform ke prati upabhoktaaon kii dilchaspee badhane kaa mukhya kaaran atyadhik ucch gunvattta he
 The DTH service provides the customer with a flexible system of control of the content coming through it
 iske alaava dit, condishnal acces system or internet protocol televijan jaise digital madhyamon main aisi vyavastha hoti he, ki unki pahunch bacchon tak hone se roka ja sake
 The cam or conditional access module is a small device that consumers can place in their set top boxes
 yah graahak ko bina nayaa set top box kharide duusare seva pradaata ke saath judane kii suvidha detaa he
 Right now, companies offering DTTH services are vying for attractive discounts on set top box prices
 cam ke jariye zyada graahak jodne kii puri yojana kii kamyaabi is par nirbhar karegi ki vah pradaata isaki keemat kitni rakhata he
 The rule of the Telephone Regulatory Authority of India in this regard is that the space for placing the cam in the set top box of every operator should be available and empty so that the consumer can fit the cam as per his choice and requirement
 bharat main dit graahakon kii sankhya agle do varshon main, yani 2011 tak doguni hokar 3

 Currently, DTH subscribers in India are 16 million
 aankadon ke anusaar gharon main alsidi tathaa elidi seton kii sankhya main bhi badhotaree ke saath hi bharat ke upabhokta badi teji se cabel operator seva se dit kii ore ja rahe hai
 According to Reliance Big TV Chief Marketing Officer Umesh Rao, the main reason for increasing consumer interest towards DTH has been the need to enjoy high quality uninterrupted service and complete entertainment at home

 Bhojeshwar Temple is a temple built in a village named Bhojpur, about 30 km from Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh
 ise bhojpur mandir bhi kehete hai
 This temple is situated on a hill between the Vindhya ranges on the banks of the Betwa River
 mandir kaa nirmaan evam iske shivlinga kii sthapana dhar ke prasiddh parmaar raja bhoj ne karavaayi thi
 It is also called Bhojpur Temple or Bhojeshwar Temple after his name, though according to some legends the original temple of this place is believed to have been established by the Pandavas
 ise "uttar bharat kaa somnath" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The inscriptions here give a knowledge of the architecture of the 11th century Hindu temple construction and it is known that the dome was used even before the arrival of Islam in India
 is apurna mandir kii vrahat kaary yojana ko nikatavarti pashaan shilaon par ukera gaya he
 According to these map diagrams, there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 iske safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple complex has been marked as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India and has made a successful effort to revive it by renovating it
 mandir ke baahar lage puraatatva vibhaag ke shilaalekh anusaar is mandir kaa shivlinga bharat ke mandiron main sabase unchaa evam vishaltam shivlinga he
 The entrance of this temple is also the largest among the doors of any Hindu building
 mandir ke nikat hi is mandir ko samarpit ek puraatatva sangrahalay bhi bana he
 The Bhojpur festival is organized every year by the state government on the occasion of Shivaratri
 is mat ke anusaar mata kunti dwaara bhagwaan shiv kii puja karne ke liye pandavon ne is mandir ke nirmaan kaa ek raatri main hi puraa karne kaa sankalp liya jo puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Thus, this temple is incomplete till date
 is mat ke anusaar aisi manyata he ki mandir kaa nirmaan kala, sthapaty or vidya ke mahaan sangrakshak madhya-bharat ke parmaar vansheey raja bhojdev ne 11veen shatabdi main karavaaya
 According to the traditions and beliefs, it was he who built Bhojpur and now a dam that was broken
 mandir kaa nirmaan kabhi purna nahin ho paaya, atah yahan ek shilanyas yaa udghaatan / nirmaan ankan shila kii kami he
 Nevertheless the name here is Bhojpur which is associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 kuch manyataon ke anusaar yah mandir ek hi raat main nirmit hona tha kintu isaki chat kaa kaam puraa hone ke pehle hi subah ho gai, isliye kaam adhuraa rah gaya
 The recognition of the construction by Raja Bhoj is also supported by the artifacts of the site, whose carbon age-calculation ensured them of the 11th century itself
 bhojpur ke ek nikatavarti jain mandir main, jis par unheen shilpiyon ke pahchaan chihn hai, jinke is shiv mandir par bane hai; un par 1035 i kii hi nirmaan tithi ankit he
 Apart from many literary works, historical evidence here also confirms the rule of King Bhoja in the year 1035 AD
 raja bhoj dwaara jari kiye gaye modas tamra patr, unke raajakavi dashabal rachit chintamani saranika aadi is pushti ke sahaayak hai
 There used to be three dams and one lake in the adjacent area of this temple
 itane bade sarovar evam teen bade baadhon kaa nirmaan koi shaktishaalee raja hi karvaa saktaa tha
 All these evidences appear in favor of the temple being built by King Bhoja
 puraatatvashastri prokirit manakodi is mandir ke nirmaan kaal ko raja bhoj ke shashan ke uttarardh main, lagbhag 11veen shatabdi ke madhya kaa bataate hai
 Inscriptions written by later Parmar rulers in the Udaipur Commendation contain such references as: phrases like those filled with temples, and dedicated facts related to Shiva
 inamen kedareshwar, rameshwar, somnath, kalbhairav evam rudra kaa varnan bhi miltaa he
 According to the proverbs and traditions, he also built a Saraswati temple
 ek jain lekhak merutung ne apni kriti prabandh chintamani main likhaa he ki raja bhoj ne akele apni rajdhani dhar main hi 104 mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 However, as on date, only Bhojpur temple is the only remaining monument, which can be associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 prabandh chintamani ke anusaar; jab raja bhoj ek baar shrimaal gayi to unhone kavi magh ko bhojaswamin naamak mandir ke bare main bataaya tha jiskaa ve nirmaan karwaane vaale the
 After this, the king returned to Malwa
 haalanki magh kavi raja bhoj ke samakaleen nahin the, atah yah katha kalbhramit prathit hoti he
 This temple was originally built on the banks of an 18
5 mile long and 7
5 mile wide lake
 is sarovar kii nirmaan yojana main raja bhoj ne pathar evam baaluu ke teen baandh banawaaye
 The first of these was built on the Betwa River, which used to hold water and there were hills in that valley from the remaining three sides
 doosraa baandh vartmaan mendua gram ke nikat do pahadiyon ke bich ke sthaan ko jodakar jal kaa nikaas roak kar rakhata tha evam teesraa baandh aaj ke bhopal shahar ke sthaan par bana tha jo ek choti mausami nadi kaaliyasot ke jal ko mode kar is betwa sarovar ko de detaa tha
 These artificial reservoirs remained until the 15th century
 ek gond kinvadanti ke anusaar malwa naresh hoshang shah ne apni sena se is band ko tudwa daalaa jisamen unhen teen maheene kaa samay lag gaya tha
 It is also told that Hoshang Shah's boy was drowned in the dam's lake and even after searching a lot, his body was not found
 naaraaz hokar usne band ko top se uda diya or mandir ko bhi top se hi gira dene kii koshish kii thi
 Due to this, the top and side part of the temple fell
 is baandh ke tut jane se sara pani bah gaya or tab is apaar jalarashi ke ekaek samaapt ho jane ke kaaran malwa kshetra main jalwaayu parivartan aa gaya tha
 Two annual fairs are also organized at this famous site on the time of Makar Sankranti and Maha Shivaratri respectively
 is samay is dharmik aayojan main bhaag lene ke liye dur dur se log yahan pahonchte hai
 The lake here extends to present day Bhopal
 mandir nirmaan main prayog kiya gaya pathar bhojpur ke hi patharile kshetron se praapt kiya gaya tha
 The remains of cutting stones and rocks are seen from near to the temple
 lekhika vidya dehejia kii pustak arli stone temples of odisha main ullekh miltaa he ki bhojpur ke shiv mandir or bhubaneshwar ke lingraj mandir va kuch or mandiron ke nirmaan main samanta dikhaai padati he
 There are many unique components in Bhojpur temple, some of which are as follows: Deletion of the pavilion from the sanctum sanctorum, straight line roof instead of the domed peak in the temple
 mandir kii bahari deevaaron main se teen bahari ore se ekadam sapaat hai, kintu ye 12veen shatabdi kii bataayi jaati hai
 After studying these unique components, a researcher Krishna Deva is of the opinion that the temple may have been related to the functions related to the funeral, etc; As can often be seen even near cremation grounds etc
 is shodh kii pushti kaalaantar main madhusudan dhaki dwaara khoje gayi kuch madhyakaalin vaastusambandhi paathya se bhi hoti he
 It is known from these fragmentary texts that after the death of many high-ranking persons, a memorial-like temple was built on their remains or funeral sites
 is prakaar ke mandiron ko swargarohan-prasaad kaha jaataa tha
 According to the text, in this type of temples, receding stone blocks are used instead of a single peak
 kirit manakodi ke anusaar bhojpur mandir kii adhirachana is praaroop par sateek baithti he
 According to his estimate, Raja Bhoj may have built this temple for his late father Sindhuraj or Tau Vakapati Munj, who died in a humiliating place in the enemy area
 yahaan dekhakar aisa prathit hota he ki nirmaan kaary ekadam se hi roak diya gaya hoga
 Though the reasons for this are still unknown, but the history of the people speculate that this may have happened due to a natural disaster, lack of supply of resources or the start of a war
 2006-07 main iske punuruddhar kaary ke armbh hone se purv imaarat kii chat bhi nahin thi
 With this, the historian KK Muhammed speculated that the roof may have collapsed during the construction period itself due to mathematical architectural defects in the correct estimation of the entire load
 tab raja bhoj ne is dosha ke kaaran ise punarnirmaan na kar mandir ke nirmaan ko hi roak diya hoga
 Historians, archaeologists and architects also get a lot of knowledge of the organizing and mechanics of the 11th century temple construction style from the evidences found from the then abandoned site
 mandir ke uttari evam purvi ore kai khadaan sthal bhi mili hai, jahaan vibhinn staron ke adhure shilp evam shilpakritiyaan bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, a huge slope has been found to carry heavy stone parts from the quarry to the top of the temple
 bahut si shilpakritiyaan khadaan se mandir ke nikat laakar aise hi rakhi hui mili hai
 They will have to be used later at the time of temple construction, but they would have been left as such after the construction stopped

 These signs were made for estimating or estimating the work amount of the craftsmen or their families, which were erased at the time of finalization of the building, but the temple remained as such due to the non-completion of the construction

 devisingh mahajan bengal ke ek arthlolup mahajan the jinhone angrejon kii sahaayta se krishakon tathaa jameendaaron par kaaphi atyaachaar kiya tha
 In 1765, upon receiving the Diwali of Bengal and Bihar, the officials of the East India Company handed over the burden of collecting rent to Muhammad Raza Khan
 usne devisingh ko apni ore se purniya kaa rajasav vasuul karne ke liye bheja
 In 1768 Devi Singh acquired the monopoly of collecting rent from all the parganas of the district
 usne itani sakhti se or itnaa badha chadhaakar lagaan vasuul karnaa aarambh kiya ki log gharbaar chhodkar bhaagane lage
 Purnia became insensitive
 phir bhi devisingh kii arthlolupata shant nahin hui
 He captured and imprisoned the landlords and summoned their women to the court and took off their jewelery and humiliated them in many ways
 nidaan devisingh ke utpeedan kii khabaren dhire dhire chaaron taraf failane lageen
 At that time, he was somehow saved and only Raza Khan was removed instead of him, but after some time more things came to light, Devi Singh too was removed from his post
 phir bhi governor hestings aise kaam ke aadmi ko apane haath se jane nahin dena chahta tha
 Therefore, soon after getting the opportunity, on the recommendation of Gangagovind Singh, in 1773 AD, Devi Singh made Diwan of the regional committee of Murshidabad
 is prakaar unhen ek baar phir shoshan or utpeedan dwaara apaar dhanrashi ikatthi karne kaa avasar mil gaya
 Devisingh felt that due to the members of the regional committee, his work may get disrupted, so he tried very hard to keep him happy
 unhen vilaayat kii acchhee se acchhee sharaab tathaa bahumoolya uphaar dena shuru kiya or unke bhogavilas kii saamagree jutate rahane kaa bhi ytn kiya
 In this way, Devi Singh got complete freedom to recover the arbitrary revenue
 kintu kuch hi samay baad samiti sadasyon main rishwat ke bantwaare ko lekar paraspar jhagada shuru hua or san 1778 main un logon ne devisingh ko padchyut kar dene kaa nishchay kiya
 On the death of the Raja of Dinajpur in 1780, there was a fight between his brother and adopted son
 hestings ne chaar lakh rupye mehtaanaa lekar naaballig dattak putr kaa haq sweekaar kar liya or rajya vyavastha kaa bhaar gudlad naamak yuvak ke haath saunp diya
 In this connection, he made Devi Singh the dewan of Goodlad Sahab
 devisingh ne gudlad ke sahyog or sammati se raja ke puraane karmchaariyon ko sevachut kar diya or raja ke gujaarey kii rakam bhi 1600 rupye masik se ghataakar 600 rupye kar di
 The same excesses started again from Devisingh, causing panic and discontent in all Dinajpur
 devisingh ne rangpur se rajasav vasuul karne ke liye apane pratinidhi rup main harram naamak vyakti ko bheja jisane or bhi adhik kathorta se lagaan vasuul karnaa aarambh kiya
 He recovered a lot of money, but Devisingh was not satisfied with it
 unhone harram kii sahaayta ke liye, tarah tarah kii hidaayat dekar suryanarayan naamak ek or vyakti ko bheja
 Now the amount of oppression started increasing rapidly
 jameendaaron tathaa sambhraant purushon kii striyaan khule maidan main khadi kii gai
 Their jewelry was taken off their hands by the tyrannical and defiant employees and they were rudely insulted
 kitni hi striyon ko apni lajja or maryaada kii raksha ke liye vivash hokar aatmghaat kar lenaa padaa
 After the culmination of incest and oppression, the public resolved to strongly protest against Devi Singh and expel the employees of the company government outside the country
 gudlad ne leftinent mcdonald ko vidroh kaa daman karne ke liye bheja
 As the situation subsided, the Calcutta Council appointed Peterson to investigate the cause of the rebellion
 unke dwaara prastut kii gai report ko juthi gavaahiyon tathaa avishvaasaneey tathyon par aadhaarit kahkar hestings ne amaanya tehraaya or san 1784 main jaanch ke liye nayaa kamishan niyukt kiya
 But the very next year he had to leave India
 ab lard cornwalis bharat ke garvanar janalar hokar aae
 He came to know many things, but some people conspired together that a crime against Devisingh could not be proved
 unhen koi dand to nahin diya gaya par lard cornwalis ne unhen sarkaar kii naukari se sthaayee rup se pruthak kar diya
 Devisingh settled in Nasipur place of Murshidabad and spent the remaining days of his life there

 Sometimes, due to bending of the pelvic region, one leg becomes small, one leg becomes big
 natijatan ridh bhi jhuk jaati he
 If the exact cause of scoliosis is found, as if it is due to a slipdisk, then through the 'bedrest', due to the uneven length of the legs, it can be avoided by using special types of orthopedic shoes
 yadi ridh kaa jhukaav lagaataar hota rahe to orthopedic sarjan se paraamarsh karke shalyakriya bhi karai ja sakati he

 dhyaan dijiye ki padosi desh afghanistan main bhi ek badakhshaan praant he, jisaki seemayen kuhistoni-badakhshaan se lagati hai
 The large part of the kuhistoni-badakhshan state located in the Pamir ranges is an inaccessible mountainous region, due to which the population here is also less
