 Although Puluyi studied with Röntgen at the University of Strasbourg from the years 1873 to 1875, his biographer Guida claims that his subsequent research was done independently
 april 1887 main, nicola testla ne ucch voltage or khud dizin kii gai naliyon ke saath-saath crukes naliyon kaa upyog karke eks-re kii jaanch kerani shuru kii
 His technical publications indicate that he had invented and developed a special single electrode X-ray tube that was different from other X-ray tubes with no target electrode

 By 1892, Tesla conducted many such experiments, but did not classify these emissions, which were later known as X-rays
 testla ne is ghatana ko "adrishy" prakaar kii vikiran urja ke rup main samanyikrut kiya
 Tesla, in his 1897 X-ray lecture in front of the New York Academy of Sciences, described the facts of his methods concerning various experiments

 His letter to The Physical Review, dated January 6, 1893, was duly published and published in San Francisco Examiner, an article entitled Without Lenses or Light, Photographs Taken with Plate and Object in Darkness
 henrich hertz kaa philip lenard naamak ek chaatr yah dekhnaa chahta tha ki cathod kirane, hawa main crukes nalee se hokar guzar sakati hai yaa nahin
 He built a crux tube at the end of which was a "window" made of thin aluminum with its front side facing the cathode so that the cathode rays could hit it
 unhone dekha ki usamen se kuch niklaa jiske photographic platon ke prati anaavruth kii vajah se pratidipti utpann hui
 He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various substances
 It has been reported that at least some of these "lenard rays" were actually X-rays
 harman won helmholtz ne eks-re ke ganitiya samikarnon ko sutarabaddh kiya
 He conceived a scattering theory before Röntgen's discovery and announcement

 There are considerable differences in the details of his discovery as Röntgen burned his lab notes at the time of his death, but this may have been the concoction of his biographers: Röntgen, a crux tube and a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide
 With cathode rays attached to it, which they wrapped in a black curboard so that the visible light emitted from the tube interfered Do not
 He saw a misty green glow emanating from the screen at about 1 meter distance
 He felt that some invisible rays from the tube were passing through the cardboard, which caused the curtain to glow
 unhone paaya ki ve unki mej par rakhi kitabon or kaagajon se hokar bhi guzar sakati thi
 Röntgen immediately began systematically investigating these unknown rays
 apni praarambhik khoj ke do maheene baad, unhone apana shodh-patr prakashit kiya
 Röntgen discovered its medical use by looking at a picture of his wife's hand made by X-rays on a photographic plate

 This division became more valid later on being more relevant than the 16 substances of justice and formed the basis of the joint tradition of nyaya-vaisesika-philosophy which "nyamuktavali" etc
 are represented by the ancient texts
 shaddarshanon main antim do darshanon ko "mimasaa" kaha jaataa he
 These are known as Purvimansa and Uttaraimamsa
 anya darshanon kii apeksha inkaa vedon se adhik ghanishtha sambandh he
 In a way, these are interpretations of Vedic philosophy
 purvamimasaa, mantrasamhita or brahmanon ke karmkand kii vyakhya he
 Uttarmimamsa is the logical explanation of the spiritual philosophy of the Upanishads
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" kehete hai
 The name of North Mimamsa is also "vedanta"
 in donon mimasaaon ke siddhanton kaa aadhaar vedon main he, kintu vyavasthit darshanon ke rup main inkaa aarambh anya darshanon ke saath saath hi hua
 That is why they are counted in the conspiracies
 donon mimasaaon ke itihaas ke teen charan hai
 They developed in the same northeast in all three phases
 vaidic yug main vedon ke purvabhag main karmkand kaa vidhaan hua
 Spirituality gained prominence in the northern part of the Vedas
 isa kii aarambhik shatabdi main jaimini or baadaraayan ke "mimasaasutra" tathaa "brahmasutra" bhi sambhavat: isi kram main rache gaye

 Buddhism emerged in the sixth century BCE in the form of revolution against Vedic religion
 anek kaarnon se isa kii chhathi shatabdi main buddha dharm kaa hraas hone laga

 Madhvacharya was a minister of King Vukka of Vijayanagar

 Many Acharyas have explained Brahmasutras and Upanishads from different perspectives

 They are famous by the name of Advaita, Vividhavaita, Dvaita etc
 vedant ke ye sampradaay sankhya aadi kii bhanti darshanik nahin hai; in sabhi sampradaayon ke dharmik peeth desh ke vibhinn sthanon main pratishthit hai
 The Acharya tradition of these Peeths is intact till date
 gitadarshan bhi vaidic shaddarshanon ke samakaleen he
 The Gita's Karmayoga is an important fundamental philosophy after the Upanishads' Brahmanism
 sabhi vaidic darshanon ne karmyog kaa mahatv sweekaar kiya he
 Being practical, it can be called representative Indian biography
 gita ke karmyog main aadhyatm or jivan kaa adbhud samanvay hua he
 Historically, it is a syncretism of the Vedic rituals and Brahmanism of the Upanishads
 aadhyatm or karm kaa yah samanvay atyant mahatvapurn he
 The influence of Vedanta of the Upanishads and asceticism of Buddhism and Jainism were so increasing in the Indian public that the effect of seclusion and retirement would have become fatal to the society
 aisi sthiti main gita ne karmyog kaa sandesh dekar desh ko ek sanjivan mantra pradaan kiya
 Gita gave a new definition to sannyas by accepting spirituality
 "sanyas" kaa saamaanya arth "tyaag" he
 But there is often confusion in this sacrifice
 bhojan, shayan aadi prakritik karmon kaa tyaag kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also possible to renounce working deeds
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 It is possible to renounce the desire for fruit
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 Desiring to bear fruit, performing lustful deeds for public gathering is the ideal of life
 yahi moksh kaa saadhan he
 This Nishkam Karmayoga of the Gita has been adopted by most Indian philosophies
 gyanayog uskaa aadhyatmik aadhaar he or bhaktiyog uskaa bhavatmak darshan he
 Shankaracharya's Advaitamat is the oldest of these many sects of Vedanta
 yah sambhavat: sabase adhik pratishthit bhi he
 The monotheism of Shankaracharya depends on the Upanishads
 unke anusaar brahm hi ek maatr satya he
 The world deflects and enlivens the spirit of the living being
 agyaan kaa nivaaran hone par jeev ko apane brahmbhav kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 brahm sachchidanand he
 Brahma's power and consciousness and his bliss are endless
 jaagrit, swapn or sushupt kii avasthaaon se pare tathaa bahya or aantarik vishyon se ateet anubhav main brahm kaa prakaash hota he
 Brahma is indescribable due to being transcendental
 sankhyathit hone ke kaaran use "advait" kaha jaataa he
 This monotheism is differentiated in practices of renunciation and love
 samadhi main iskaa aantarik saakshaatkaar hota he
 Brahma has been considered as the cause of the world to prove the advaita bhava
 brahm ko jagat kaa upadan kaaran maanakar donon kaa advait siddh ho jaataa he
 The apprehension of the outcome of the factor has been overcome by discourse
 vivartkaaran avikarya hota he
 Its function is false, like the snake's illusion in the rope
 rajju sarp or swapn praatibhasik satya hai
 The world is the practical truth
 moksh paryant vah maanya he
 Brahma is the ultimate truth which remains in salvation
 maaya se yukt brahm "ishwar" kehalaata he
 He is the creator of the universe, but it is not the ultimate truth
 brahmanubhav kaa saadhan gyaan he
 Acts are not eternal
 "brahm" karm ke dwaara saadhy nahin he
 Karma and devotion are the cooperative causes of salvation

 In salvation, the soul is freed from all shackles and is overwhelmed with eternal bliss
 yah moksh jeevankaal main prapya he tathaa jivan ke vyavhaar se isaki purna sangati he
 About 300 years after Shankaracharya, in the 11th century, Ramanujacharya established the Vishishtadvaita school based on the new interpretation of the Brahmasutras
 ramanujakrit "shribhashya" ke aadhaar par yah 'srisampradaay' kehalaata he
 Ramanuja does not believe in Shankar's Mayanism
 unke anusaar jeev, jagat or brahm teenon parmaarthik satya hai
 Jagat is not the inversion of Brahma but is the actual creation of Brahma
 brahm or ishwar ek duusare ke paryaay hai
 Jiva is part of Brahman
 moksh main jagat kaa vilay nahin hota or jeev kaa swatantra astitv bana rahata he
 Brahma is not unique and non-virtuous, but characteristic and virtuous
 brahm hi swatantra satta he
 Jeeva and Jagat are adjective adjectives
 brahm se pruthak unka astitv sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, Ramanuja's opinion is also Advaita
 jeev or jagat ke visheshnon se yukt brahm kaa inke sath vishisht advaitabhaav he
 Brahma is his inter-lord
 ramanuj ke mat main bhakthi moksh kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Knowledge of the qualities of God is the motivator of devotion
 saadhaaran jan or shudron ke liye prapatti arthath sharnagati sarvottam maarg hai
 a few years after Ramanuja, Nimbarkacharya established Dvaitadvaitaism in the 11th century itself
 brahmasutron par "vedant-parijaat-saurabh" naam se unka bhashya is mat kaa aadhaar he
 Like Ramanuja, Nimbark also considers Jiva and Jagat as truth and dependent of Brahma
 ramanuj ke mat main advait pradhan he
 The request for duality is greater in the Nimbark vote
 ramanuj ke anusaar jeev or brahm main swarupagat samya he, unki shakti main bhed hai
 There is a characteristic distinction between them in the opinion of Nimbark
 nimbark ke advait kaa aadhaar jeev kii brahm par nirbharta he
 The Brahm of Nimbark is a virtuous god
 krishna ke rup main uski bhakthi hi moksh kaa param maarg he
 This devotion comes from the grace of God
 bhakthi se bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 ramanuj or nimbark dono ke mat main videh mukti hi maanya he
 After Nimbarka, in the 13th century Madhvacharya propounded the dualism
 ve purnaprajna tathaa aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He has established dualism by refuting the Advaita of Shankaracharya and the dualism of Nimbarka
 unke anusaar bhed or abhed donon kii ekatra sthati sambhav nahin he
 Shankaracharya's Mayaism is also not acceptable to him
 jagat mithyaa nahin yatharth he
 It is not possible for the third indefinite category of Maya to be different from Sat and Asat
 ishwar, jeev or jagat teenon ek duusare se bhinn hai
 There are five types of distinction
 ishwarjiv, ishwar-jagat, jeev-jagat, jeev-jeev or jad padaarthon main paraspar bhed he
 God is the cause of the world, not the cause of the world
 upadan karan prakruti he
 God is its regulator
 ishwar kii bhakthi ke dwaara moksh praapt hota he
 There is a difference between free organisms
 ve ishwar se bhinn rahakar apni samathrya ke anusaar ishwar kii vibhuti main bhaag lete hai
 In the 15th century Vallabhacharya propagated the Shuddhadvaita faith
 is mat kaa aadhaar "brahmasutron" par likhit vallabhacharya kaa "anubhashya" he
 He considers the Advaita bhava of pure Brahma indulged with Maya
 yah brahm nirgun nahin, sagun he tathaa maaya ke sambandh se rahit he
 Brahma expresses as a universe with its infinite power
 chit or anand kaa tirodhan hone ke kaaran jagat main keval sat rup se brahm kii abhivyakti hoti he
 Jeeva and Brahma are one in nature
 agni ke sfurligon kii bhaanti jeev brahm kaa ansh he, visheshan nahin
 Thus everywhere is advaita, nowhere is dvaita
 maryaada or pushti do prakaar kii bhakthi moksh kaa saadhan hai
 In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu introduced Achintya piercing
 unke shishy rup goswami ne gaudi vaishnav sampradaay kaa pratishthapan kiya
 According to them, the power of God is untouchable
 vah virdohi gunon kaa samanvay kar sakati he
 The practice of salvation is the religion of life, not contemplating impunity
 moksh kaa arth bhagwaan kii priti kaa nirantar anubhav he
 Thus in the later period of the Vedic era, the new rise of Vedanta in the Upanishads took place in the form of Advaita, Vishayadvaita, Dvaita, Shuddhavaita etc
 from 7th century to 16th century
 upanishdon kaa vedant pashchimi or uttari bharat kii dein he
 Advaita etc
 cults emerged from the south
 inke pravartak dakshin deshon ke nivasee the
 Chaitanya's idea originated from Bengal
 kintu in sabhi sampradaayon ne vrudanvan aadi uttari sthanon main apane peeth banaae
 Shankaracharya installed benches at all four corners of the country
 uttar, dakshin, purv, pashchim sabhi pradeshon ke log in sampradaayon main sammilit hue
 Despite being different in principle, these various sects of Vedanta became the sources of internal unity of India
 pashupat dekhen In addition to Vedic and non-vedic philosophies, a third stream in the Indian philosophical tradition has flowed to Shaivism and Shakta sects
 kuch rahasyamay sadhana ke rup main hone ke kaaran yah vaidic or avaidic dhaaraon ke sangam main kuch saraswati ke samaan gupt rahi he
 But Shiva also has a lot of recognition as a direct worship
 pracheen aitihaasik khojon se shiv kii pracheenta pramanit hoti he
 The village has Shiva temples in the village
 prati saptaah or prati paksh main shiv kaa vrath hota he
 The divine marriage of Mahadev Parvati is worshiped as an ideal in Indian families
 rugveda or yajurveda ke rudra ke rup main shiv kaa varnan he
 But Shiva is often considered as the non-vedic god
 daksh ke yajyagwans ke prasang ke dwaara shiv kii avaidikata kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he puranic yug main bhi tridevon kii tulana ke prasang main virodh ke abhas milte hai
 But later Shiva became a very popular deity
 shaiva sampradaay praaia: gupt tantron ke rup main rahe hai
 Very little of his literature is published
 prakashit sahitya bhi pratikatmak hone ke kaaran duruh he
 There are many sects of Shaivite tradition
 inamen shaiva, pashupat, virshaiv, kalamukh, kapalik, kashmir shaiva mat tathaa dakshini mat adhik prasiddh hai
 These can be called conspiracies of Shaivite tradition
 shaiva siddhaat kaa prachaar dakshin main tamil desh main he
 Its basis is in the Agam texts
 14veen shatabdi main nilkanth ne "brahmasutron" par shaivabhashya kii rachana kar vedant parampara ke saath shivamat kaa samanvay kiya
 Pashupat Mat is famous as 'nakulish Pashupat'
 pashupat sutara is sampradaay kaa mul granth he
 The Kalamukh and Kapalic sects have been somewhat fierce and mysterious
 kashmir shaiva mat advait vedant ke samaan he
 Despite being a tantric, his philosophical literature is immense
 isaki spand or pratybhigna do shakhaayen hai
 One has the basis of Vasantagupta's vibrancy and the other is based on his disciple Somananda's "pratibhagyastika"
 jeev or parameshwar kaa advait donon shakhaon main maanya he
 Parameshwara "shiva" is similar to Vedanta's Brahman
 virshaiv mat dakshin deshon se prachlit he
 His followers wear Shivling
 at: inhen "lingayat" bhi kehete hai
 In the 12th century Vasava propagated this view
 virshaiv mat ek prakaar kaa vishishtadvait he
 It can be called Shakti Vishishtvaita because of considering Shakti specific world as the ultimate element
 uttar or dakshin main prachlit shaiva sampradaay bhi uttar vedant sampradaayon kii bhanti bharat kii dharmik ekta ke sutara hai
 Shiva worshiped from Kailas to Rameshwaram is the Mars god of Indian unity
 donon kii yatraaon ke dwaara bhartiya ekta kaa vyaavhaarik anushthan hota he

 Jain Tirthankara Mahavir Swami was in Vaishaliwali branch and Gautama Buddha was born in Shakya branch of Kosala

 Just as this dynasty is said to be inferior in Sanskrit texts of Hindus, similarly in Pali and Prakrit texts of Buddhists and Jains, this dynasty is said to be high
 gautam buddha ke samasamyik magadh ke raja bimbsaar ne vaishali ke lichhavi logon ke yahan sambandh kiya tha
 The Gupta emperor also married a Lichchavi girl
 is jati kaa itihaas tathaa shashanvrittant ek sahasr varshon tak kisi na kisi rup main miltaa he
 The Lichchhavi was the principal caste of the Vajji Sangh in Pali literature, hence the name of Vajji appears in the list of Shodash Mahajanapadas in Angwasa body, Mahavastu and Vinayapitak, not Lichchavi
 sambhavat: isi kaaran panini ne vrujji sangh kaa hi ullekh kiya he
 
 kautilya ne bhi isi kii pushti kii he 
 Among the eight castes of the Vajji Sangh, Lichchavi was considered a strong and omnipotent caste, whose capital Baishali is also mentioned in the Ramayana
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar lichhavi kshatriya vanshaj the, isi kaaran mahaparinirvana ke baad lichhavi sangh ne buddha ke avshesh main hissaa bantaya tha
 They built the stupa on the relic which came to light from the excavation of Vaishali

 It is said that the Lichchhavis marched on Magadha during the reign of Bimbasar
 magadh tathaa vaishali rajyon main sandhi ke falswaroop vaivaahik sambandh ho gaya parantu bimbsaar ke pashchaat is yuddh kaa badla chukaane kaa vichaar ajatshatru ne kiya
 Despite being disenchanted with the world, Buddha warned Ajatashatru that the Licchavi Sangh is invincible, impenetrable and no one can weaken its democratic organization
 buddha ke in vachanon se avgat hokar ajatshatru ne sidhaa akraman karne kaa vichaar tyaag diya or lichhavi sangh ko todane tathaa bhed utpann kar nirval banane kaa nindaneey kaary apane mantri vasskaar ko saunpa
 Finally Ajat succeeds
 vaishali par akraman karne ke nimitt ganga ke dakshin kinare par patliputra nagar kii sthapana kii, jahaan magadhasena sangathit kii gai or lichhavi sangh foot ke kaaran parajeet hua

 When the Gupta dynasty emerged in the fourth century, the Gupta king became powerful because of his marital relationship with the Lichchavi dynasty
 gupt samrajya kaa pradurbhaav lichchhaviyon ke sahyog se sambhav ho sakaa tha

 This led to mutual sympathy and cooperation between the two nations

 Mimamsa Darshan is one of the six Darshans of Hindus
 paksh-pratipaksh ko lekar vedavakyon ke nirnit arth ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 The above idea is from the earlier Aryan tradition
 kintu aaj se praaia: sava paanch hajaar varsh purv samaveda ke acharya krishna dwaipayan ke shishy ne use sutarabaddh kiya
 The sutras refer to Badarayana, Badari, Atreya, Ashmarathya, Drafting, Etishayan, Kamukayan, Kartajajini and Labukayana Maharshias as complete aspects and principles, which are detailed in the annotations and discourses of the sutras, which have become millennials
 
 is shaastra kaa purvamimasaa ar veydant kaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 From the sutra composed by Jaimini Muni, Mimamsa is called Jaminian Dharmamimamsa
 german vidwaan maxmooler kaa kahana he ki - "yah darshan shaastra koti main nahin aa saktaa, kyonki isamen dharmanushthan kaa hi vivechan kiya gaya he
 There is no discussion of Jiva, God, Bandha, Moksha and their means anywhere
 " Some Indian scholars who are biased to Maxmuller's opinion also hesitate to call it philosophy, because in the Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta the evidence and theorems in the then cases are mainly about the soul-self, Bandha-moksha etc
 Discretion is received, the same philosophy is not visible in the formulas, commentary and talk etc
 uparyukt vichaarkon ne sthool buddhi se granth kaa adhyayan kar apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Yet it is clear that the philosophy of Mimamsa is the contributory cause of all philosophies
 jaimini ne in vishyon kaa beej rup se apane sutron main upanyaas kiya he "satsamprayoge purushasyendriyanaa buddhi janm tat pratyakshm" chaturth sutara main do shabd aae hai - purush or buddhi
 The word "soul" differs from the male word
 yah arth kumaril bhatta ne "bhaattdipika" main likhaa he
 The word wisdom has conveyed the meaning of knowledge, pramata, theorem and proof
 vrittikaar ne "tasya nimitt parishti:" paryat teen sutron main pratyaksh, anumaan shabd, arthapati or anuplabdhi pramaanon kaa saparikar vishad vivechan tathaa autpattik sutara main aatmavaad kaa vishesh vivechan apane vyaakhyaan main kiya he
 The same has been analyzed in texts like Shabar Bhashya, Shloka Vartik, Shastradipika, Bhatt Chintamani, etc
, wherein there is a distinction between proofs and theorems, Bandha, Moksha and their means
 mimasaa darshan main bharatvarsh ke mukhya prandhan dharm kaa varnashram vyavastha, aadhanadi, ashwamedhant aadi vichaaron kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Often, knowledgeable and disinterested men have been everywhere in the world, but the learned philosophers of rituals and rituals of rituals have been learned in India only

 bhartiya karmkand siddhant kaa pratidaan or samarthan isi darshan main praapt hota he
 Dr
 Kunnan Raja has aptly portrayed this in the role of the second edition of "brihati"
 yadhyapi kanad muni krit vaisheshik darshan main dharm kaa namatah ullekh praapt hota he - tathaapi uske vishay main aage vichaar nahin kiya gaya he
 a scholar says - arthath jaise koi manushya samudr paryant jane kii ichha rakhte hue himalay main chalaa jaataa he, usee prakaar dharm ke vyaakhyaan ke icchhuk kanad muni shat padaarthon kaa vivechan karte rah gaye
 Answer: According to the principle of epistemology, right to attain enlightenment is only after the deed, but according to the earlier epistemology philosophy - is vedamantra ke anusaar mumukshu janon ko bhi karm karnaa chahie
 By performing Vedic Karma, the Karmbandhan is automatically terminated - Tasmanmumukhubhi: Karya is the main soul of Indian theistic philosophies according to the verses of Nityamtikam and “adi”
 mimasaa darshan solah adhyyon kaa he, jisamen baarah adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshcand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It discusses the authority of the deity
 at: use 'devtaa cond' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan case that despite reading Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, the reading was in Dvadashadhyay only in the medieval period
 jis tarah chatushpada gayatri ke rahane par bhi vidvan varg tripada gayatri ko hi japate hai, usee tarah vartmaan kaal main dwadashadhyaayi mimasaa kaa hi adhyayan adhyaapan prachlit he
 According to some scholars, it is difficult to decide the meaning of a sentence without epistemology, because such a sentence is evidence in the present sense or in other sense, the conclusion which comes in the decision of this idea is called epistemology, but here the meaning of the word epistemology is from philosophy
 is
 dharmagyaan ke liye paraspar virodh rahit vedamantron ke arthon ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 And thoughtfully received theology is the result of epistemology
 yahi baat jaimini ne apane mimasaa darshan main kahi he - athato dharm jigyaasa

 kumaril bhatta ne ise is prakaar varnan kiya he - Further sentence-wise decision-making millennium judgments are described
 yahan tak chah adhyyon kaa sankshipt vishyanirdesh kiya gaya
 In this philosophy, one gets knowledge of duty-abstention from Veda-sentence-decision by considering the objective predicate sentiment obtained from judicious judgment, or from the combustible combustion justice
 isliye dharmagyaan hi mimasaa darshan kaa prayojan he
 In this philosophy there is an undertaking from theology
 vyakaran ke liye "padashastra", vaisheshik nyaay ke liye "pramanshastra" or mimasaa ke liye "vaakyashastra" kaa prayog sanskrit sahitya main hota he
 There is a discussion of religious thought in this scripture
 bhartiya janata kaa mukhya uddeshy dharmanushthan he
 Ritual cannot happen without fruit and fruitfulness cannot be without material means
 at: sankshep main saadhan kaa bhi vivechan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to know the symptoms, evidence and means of religion before the ritual
 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the relation of the word is continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Niraश्वरvara Samāhākāvī करतेa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The deity of the commentary Shabar should be addressed with despotism
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - Sādhyākāक्षाa साधa Sādhanākā औरa and "ityākāyātakābakक्षाa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also the eclipse of authenticity
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Justice Sudhakar has considered it to be a special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself
 is vishay kaa vishesh gyaan bhatt chintamani main drashtavy he
 Balabhadra Singh Rackwar is the representative character of Awadh, Uttar Pradesh in the 1857 revolution
 murdhanya sahityakar amritlal nagar ne apni pustak 'gadar ke phool' shahid balbhadra singh evam unke chah sau saathiyon ko samarpit kii he
 The cartridges of cow-pig fat became the reason for the mutiny of the soldiers, while the zamindaro of Awadh, for the talukdars, who were part of the British system, there was no such reason, but there are hundreds of names which are reaction of foreign rule i became part of this revolution and martyrdom
 yah vidroh uttar pradesh ke krantikari charitra ko ujagar karata he
 The 1857 clover was much larger than the world's greatest French state revolution
 1857 kii bhartiya kranti ne bhi ek raashtra kaa sutarapaat kiya
 If the American Revolution paves the way for American unity, then 1857 has shown the way for India's political integration
 duniya ke itihaas main british samrajya ke viruddh yah sabase bada vidroh tha
