 Below is a list of some of their major castes- 1 After seasoning at 12% moisture content Full competition is the name of the market form in which there is no limit to the number of vendors
 faltah koi bhi ek utpaadak bazaar main vastu kii keemat par prabhaav nahin daal saktaa
 In economics, markets are mainly divided into two forms: absolute competition and imperfect competition
 bazaar sanrachana ke do charam binduon par purna pratiyogita or ekadhikaar hai
 Some predictions are made for the complete competition, which are as follows: 1
 prayek utpaadak bazaar kii puri aapurti kaa itnaa chota hissaa pradaan karata he kii wo akelaa bazaar main vastu kii keemat par koi prabhaav nahin daal saktaa
 2
 The goods made by each producer are the same
 3
 prayek utpaadak bazaar main uplabdh utpaadan takanic tak pahunch rakhata he
 4
 There is no restriction on the arrival of any new producer in the market or any producer present in the market
 5
 bazaar main vidyaman prayek kreta or vikreta ko bazaar kaa purna gyaan he
 Although complete competition is not possible in practical life, the stock market gets very close in terms of its characteristics
 krishi kshetra main bhi pratiyogita purna pratiyogita ke samaan hi hoti he
 In the full competition, no seller can determine the price of the item itself
 atah vastu kaa mulya bazaar main nirdhaarit hota he
 To understand the process of pricing, it is necessary to understand demand and supply
 maang: ek nishchit mulya par kisi vastu kii jitani maatra log khareednaa kar upyog karnaa chaahate hai use vasatu kii maang kehete hai
 Supply: The quantity of a commodity that the producer wants to sell in the market at a specified price is called the supply of the commodity in the market
 jab bazaar main koi vastu aati he to uske maang or uski aapurti main sambandh sthapit hota he or mulya kaa nirdhaaran hota he
 Determining the appropriate sales volume by the seller purna pratiyogita main vikreta kaa maang-vakr purnatah lochasheel hota he kyonki vah bazaar nirdhaarit mulya par jitna chaahe utpaadan kar saktaa he or use bech saktaa he
 Hence, he has to determine his marginal cost curve to determine the appropriate quantity
 seemaant laagat kaa arth he vartmaan sthiti main ek or vastu ke utpaada karne kaa laagat
 The marginal cost curve is shaped like the English letter 'U'
 iska arth he ki jab utpaadan kshamta kaa puraa prayog nahin ho rahaa he tab seemaant laagat ghat rahaa hota he, ek nishchit kshamta tak pahunchane ke baad yah badhane lagata he
 The point at which the marginal cost curve intersects the producer's demand curve, at which point appropriate production is determined
 jab utpaadak ek vastu kaa utpaadan karata he to uskaa mukhya uddeshy hota he laabh
 When the marginal cost, ie the cost of production of a unit, goes above the value of the commodity established in the market, it means that the seller will incur losses from its production
 atah jis bindu par seemaant laagat vakr, vikreta ke maang vakr ko kaat kar uske upar chalaa jaataa he, us bindu ke paar utpaadan karne se vikreta ko apana utpaada laagat se kam bhav par bechnaa hoga
 Hence the producer stops production after reaching this point

 After this, Theodan and others go to Orthank with an army to take revenge
 orthank ko, minar ko chhod, tabatak anton ne apane kabze main le liya tha or paar kii nadi kaa bandh todakar use jalmagn kar diya tha
 As Saruman's wickedness persists, Gandalf breaks his magic wand and expels him from the magician category
 saruman ne galati se un logon kii taraf ek palantir de maaraa, jise pippin ne pakadaa
 The curious hobbit Pippin used the magical palantir to sneak into it

 After this Gandalf and Pippin left for the Sultanate of Gondor

 The student movements in Tripura since the late sixties of the last century were unmistakably focused on the expansion of higher education facilities and the demand for the creation of Tripura's own university

 Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and banned from the press
 pradhanmantri ke bete sanjay gandhi ke netritv main bade paimaane par purush nasbandi abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Jayaprakash Narayan called it 'the darkest period of Indian history'
 1967 or 1971 ke bich, pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne sarkaar or bhartiya rashtriya congress party ke saath hi sansad main baari bahumat ko apane niyantran main kar liya tha
 Instead of the Union Cabinet, central government power was concentrated within the Prime Minister's Secretariat

 For this he relied on his principal secretary PN Haksar, who was in the inner circle of Indira's advisors

 Indira Gandhi cleverly alienated her rivals, causing the Congress to split and in 1969 — two parts, the Congress and the Congress that were on Indira's side, were split
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti or congress saansadon ke ek bade bhaag ne pradhanmantri kaa saath diya
 Indira Gandhi's party was stronger than the old Congress and a strong institution with traditions of internal democracy

 In the coming years, Indira's influence grew so much that she could establish self-elected loyalists as chief ministers of states, rather than members elected by the Congress Legislature Party
 indira kii us sarkaar ke paas janata ke bich unki karishmai apil kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Another reason for this was the decisions taken by the government

 Subsequently, unlike Syndicate and other opponents, Indira was seen as an "image of the poor pro, in matters of religion, with economics and secularism and socialism standing for the development of the entire country
" " pradhanmantri ko vishesh rup se vanchit virgon-garib, daliton, mahilaon or alpsankhyakon dwaara bahut samarthan mila

 " As soon as the Emergency came into force, political opponents were arrested under the Internal Security Act, including Jayaprakash Narayan, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 maamla 1971 main hue loksabhaa chunaav kaa tha, jisamen unhone apane mukhya pratidwandvi raaj narayan ko parajeet kiya tha
 But four years after the election results came, Raj Narayan challenged the election result in the High Court
 unki daleel thi ki indira gandhi ne chunaav main sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog kiya, tay seemaa se adhik kharch kiye or matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye galat tareekon kaa istemaal kiy
 The court upheld these allegations

 Even the Congress party issued a statement saying that Indira's leadership is indispensable for the party

 The first mass protest in the country was organized by the Akali Dal which is known as the "campaign for the Defense of Democracy"
 ise 9 july ko amritsar main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Nearly two years after the imposition of the Emergency, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution of the Lok Sabha and holding elections

 He was the resident poet of King Harshavardhana
 unke do pramukh granth hai: harshcharitam tathaa kadambari
 Harshacharitam was the life-character of King Harshavardhana and Kadambari was the first novel in the world
 kadambari purna hone se pehle hi banbhatta ji kaa dehanth ho gaya to upanyaas puraa karne kaa kaam unke putr bhushanbhatta ne apane haath main liya

 Mahakavi Banabhatta has attained the same place in the field of prose composition as that of Kalidasa in the field of Sanskrit poetry
 paashchaadvarti lekhakon ne ek swar main baan par prashastiyon kii abhivrishti kii he
 Govardhanacharya's author of Aryasaptati is- tilkamanjari ke lekhak dhanpal kii prashasti is prakaar he- Trilochan praised Baan in the following verse - raghavpandavi ke lekhak kaviraj ke anusaar- These are just a few of the eternal commendations of later writers
 baan sanskrit ke kuch gine-chune lekhakon main se ek hai jinke jivan evam kaal ke vishay main nishchit rup se gyaat he
 In the role of Kadambari and in the first two incantations of Harshacharitam, Baan has given detailed information about his dynasty
 son nadi ke tat par sthit preetikut naam ke gram main vatsyayangotreey vidwadbrahman kul main banne janm liya
 Baan tells the origin of his dynasty to Saraswati and Vatsa, brother of Saraswat, son of Dadhichi
 vatsa kaa vanshaj kuber tha jiskaa chaturth putr pashupat baan kaa prapitamah tha
 Baan's grandfather was named Arthapati who had eleven sons
 baan ke pita kaa naam chitrabhanu tha
 His mother Rajyadevi died in Baan's infancy
 unka paalan-poshan unke pita ke dwaara hi hua
 Baan was just fourteen years old when his father left enough wealth for him and died
 yauvan kaa prarambh evam sampatti hone ke kaaran, baan sansar ko swayan dekhne ke liye ghar se chal pade
 He established relationships with different types of people

 He traveled to many countries and returned to his place Pritikoot

 In the first interview, Baan was very disappointed because Malavadhish, the Emperor's companion, said 'ayamasoubhungangah')
 Astu, Baan explained his position and the emperor was pleased with him and after some months with the emperor, returned Baan and he presented Harsha as a cheerful
 Started writing a biography of baan kii aatmakatha yahaan samaapt ho jaati he or baan ke antim samay ke vishay main hamen kuch bhi gyaat nahin he
 But it can be inferred that Baan got protection and he also paid the price by writing it with great joy

 Hence Kadambari was completed by two authors
 baan ke kaal nirnay main koi kathinaayee nahin he
 At the beginning of Harshacharit, he tells Harsha a king who rules - harsh ke vansh kaa varnan udhaahrantah prabhakarvardhan evam rajyavardhan ke naam yah nihsandeh siddh karte hai ki baan kannauj ke samraat harshavardhan ke raajakavi the
 This period of the arrow also corresponds to external evidence
 baan kaa ullekh 9veen shatabdi main alankaar shaastra ke gyaata anandavardhan ne kiya
 Possibly the arrows had taken place long before Anandavardhana
 vaaman ne bhi baan kaa ullekh kiya
 Vaudpati Raj, the author of Gaurwaho, also praises Baan
 kadambari or harshcharitam ke atirikt kai duusari rachanaayen bhi baan kii maani jaati hai
 Among them is Chandishatak, the hymn of Durga, based on the goddess Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana
 praayah ek naatak ‘parvati parinay’ bhi baan dwaara rachit mana jaataa he
 But in fact its author is a postwar Vaman Bhattaban
 ek vidwaan aalochak ke anusaar visheshanbahul vaakya rachana main, shleshamay arthon main tathaa shabdon ke aprayukt arthon keprayog main hi baan kaa vaishishty he
 His prose is elegance and has the power to provide strength in long circles
 ve shlesh, upama, roopak, utpreksha, sahokti, parisankhya or visheshtah virodhabhas kaa bahulata se prayog karte he
 As is clear from the mention of Achodasarovar, he has the right to describe nature and other types of description
 kadambari main shuknas tathaa harshcharitam ke prabhakarvardhan kii shikshaaon se baan kaa maanav prakruti kaa gahan adhyayan suspasht he
 The vocabulary of the arrow is broad and often uses all the equivalents of a word
 unhone ‘dhwani’ ke liye 19 shabdon kaa prayog kiya he
 Similarly, arrows are used in the use of adjectives and it appears that the adjectives will not end
 unke varnan jaise ujjayini tathaa divakar mitra ke ashram kaa varnan vistrut hone par bhi nirdosh, vaividhypurna evam prabhaavshaalee hai
 Banabhatta's knowledge of human nature is amazing
 uskaa koi bhi tatva anudghaatit nahin rahaa
 It is rightly said- baan ne kisi bhi kathaneey baat ko choda nahin jiske kaaran koi bhi pashchaadvati lekhak baan ko atikrant na kar sakaa
 On the basis of the poet's all-round talent, extensive knowledge, wonderful narration style and subtle description of each subject, it is well-known that Baan has not left any description untouched and there is much left to say beyond what he said
 Does not remain baan ne jitani sundarata, sahrudayata or sookshmadrushti se bahya prakruti kaa varnan kiya he, utani hi gaharaai se antah prakruti or manobhaavon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 His descriptions are so broad and accurate, that the reader experiences that he would have thought or done the same in those circumstances
 praatah kaal varnan, sandhyavarnan, shudrakavarnan, shukvarnan, chandalakanya varnan aadi main baan ne varnan hi nahin kiya he, apitu prayek vastu kaa sajiv chitra upasthit kar diya he
 In the Shukanasopadesh given to Chandrapid, the climax of the poet's talent is reflected
 kavi kii lekhnee bhavodrek main bahati hui si prathit hoti he
 In Shuknasopadesh it seems as if Saraswati is speaking in a tangible form
 baan ke varnanon main bhav or bhashaa kaa saamanjasy, bhavanukool bhashaa kaa prayog, alankaaron kaa susanyat prayog, bhashaa menaroh or avaroh tathaa lambi samasayukt padaavalee ke pashchaat laghu padaavalee aadi gun vishesh rup se praapt hote hai
 In each description, there is a first-hand description of the subject, a lot of syllogisms are found, then syllabic analogies and motivations, the latter ending with contradiction or parody
 shleshamulak upama prayog, virodhabhas or parisankhya ke prayogon main clishtataa, durbodhata or bauddhik parishram adhik he
 At some places, the descriptions have become so long that the verbs are difficult to find even after searching
 mahasweta-darshan main ek vaakya 67 panktiyon kaa he or kadambari darshan main to ek vaakya 72 panktiyon kaa ho gaya he
 And the tradition of adjectives of teaching is so long that the basic verb disappears
 aise varnanon main varnan kaa swaastya rah jaataa he, par kathapravaah pad-pad par pratihat ho jaataa he
 The arrow had unique authority over emotion and imagination
 uske vaakyon kii lambaai asaadhaaran hote hue bhi manoranjak tathaa utkrisht he
 Due to the richness of expressions and abundance of expression in the works of arrow, they affect the hearts of the gentlemen, in fact it is rightly said: windos axpi microsoft-rachit prachaalan tantron kii shrenee he
 It is used on personal computers
 yah windos anti beej par aadhaarit pehla saral prachaalan tantra he

 Pidgin is a simple mixed language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups with no common language
 It is generally used in business or in situations where two groups speak different languages than the language of their country
 Originally, the pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, constructed immediately between people from communities
 pigin kisi baatcheet karne vaale samudaay kii deshiy bhashaa nahin he, balki dwitiya bhashaa ke rup main sikhi gai bhashaa he
 Pidgins can be formed from words, sounds or sign languages from various other languages and cultures
 aam taur par anya bhashaaon kii tulana main pigin kii pratishtha kam he
 Not all simplified or "fragmented" forms of language are pidgins
 prayek pigin ke upyog sambandhi maandand alag hai jinhen pigin main praveenta hasil karne ke liye siikhnaa zaruri he
 There is uncertainty about the origin of the word pidgin
 pehali baar pidgin shabd 1850 main mudrit hua tha or shabd kii vyutpatti ke bare main anek strot maujuud hai
 For example: shabd pidgin jise pehle pigion vartanee ke saath bhi uccharit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jo mul rup se chini pigin angrezi ko varnit karne ke liye prayukt hota tha, baad main kisi bhi pigin ko nirdisht karne ke liye lokapriy hua
 The use of pidgin may be specified as a specific name for the local pidgin or creole where it is spoken
 udhaaharan ke liye, tok pisin naam angrezi shabd talk pidgin se vyutpann he
 Speakers generally refer to it simply as "pidgin" when speaking English
 shabd jargon kaa bhi upyog pigin ko varnit karne ke liye hota he or kuch piginon ke naamon main bhi paaya gaya he, jaise ki chinuk jargan 
 is sandarbh main, aajkal bhashavid jargon kaa upyog visheshtah alpaviksit prakaar ke pigin ko nirupit karne ke liye karte hai; haalanki, yah prayog praayah durlabh he or shabd jargon aksar kisi peshey ke vishisht shabdon ko sanderbhit karata he
 Pidgin may begin or become a language of trade such as Tok Pisin
 vyapaarik bhashaaen apane aap main aksar swahili, farsi yaa angrezi jaisi viksit bhashaaen ho sakati he
 Business languages are oriented towards "ie languages", while Pidgin develops as a native language
 chunki pigin bhashaa moulik rup se sanchaar kaa saral rup he, aam taur par jahaan tak sambhav ho uskaa vyakaran or swar-vigyaan saral hota he or saamanytah isamen shaamil hote hai: The construction of pidgin generally requires: iske alaava, kith whinom suzav dete hai ki pigin ke nirmaan ke liye teen bhashaaon kii zarurat he, jisamen ek spasht rup se anya se prabhavi ho
 It is often believed that when a generation of pidgin-speaking parents teaches their children it as their first language, pidgin becomes the creole language
 uske baad creole samudaay kii deshi bhashaa banane ke liye vartmaan bhashaaon ke mishran kii jagah le leti he 
 tathaapi, sabhi pigin creole bhashaaen nahin banati hai; is charan se pehle hi pigin samaapt ho sakati he 
 Other scholars, such as Salikoko Mfwane, argue that pidgin and creole arise independently under different circumstances and do not necessarily always have pidgin before creole, nor does creole develop from pidgin
 magavene ke anusaar, pigin vyapaar coloniyon ke "dainandin parsparik kriya ke liye apni deshi boli ko sangrakshit karne vaale prayoktaaon" ke bich ubhari

 bhartiya ank pranali ko pashchim ke deshon main hindu-arabi ank pranali ke naam se janaa jaataa he kyonki europea deshon ko is ank pranali kaa gyaan arab desh se praapt hua tha
 Whereas Arabs got this knowledge from India
 bhartiya ank pranali main shunya ko mila kar kul 10 ank hote hai
 The Indian numeral system is the most popular numeral system in the world
 france ke prasiddh ganitagya piyare simon laplas ke anusaar, Devanagari and international forms of Indian numerals are shown below- itihaaskaaron ke anusaar isa purv chauthi shatabdi main bharat main brahmi ankon kaa prachlan tha
 Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions found in caves in the Pune and Mumbai regions and in ancient coins found in Uttar Pradesh
 brahmi ankon main dashamalav pranali tathaa shunya kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 According to apocalyptic documents, zero in India, which is the basis of the decimal system, was invented in the first century CE
 kintu bharat main shunya ke avishkaar ke pramanik dastauez paanchavi shatabdi main hi mili hai
 The inscriptions found in Gwalior, dating back to 870 CE, contain signs of zero
 is shilaalekh ko sabhi itihaaskaaron ne ek mat se manyata di he
 With the invention of zero, the practice of the ten digit number system started in India which became the basis of modern number systems prevalent in this world
 isvi san ke saatvin shatabdi main arab ne bhartiya ank pranali kaa abhigrahan kar liya
 Indian numerals in Arabia became known as Gubar numerals and Indian numeral system known as Hindusa numeral system
 hindustan se is ank pranali ke praapt hone ke kaaran hi vahaan ise 'hindusa' naam diya gaya
 According to the chronological account of a scholar named Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi of Arabia, europe main barahavin shatabdi tak roman ankon kaa prayog hota tha
 The Roman numeral system has only seven digits, expressed by letters
 ye aksharank hai- I, V, X, L, C, d tathaa m 
 Any number is written by subtracting the sum of these digits
 udhaaharan ke liye agar teen likhnaa he to ek kaa chinh teen baar likh diya III
 If eight is to be written, three to the right of five are added by writing the signs of each one and it becomes VIII
 yah pranali itani kathin or uljhi hui he ki jab barahavin shatabdi main europe kaa bhartiya ank pranali se parichay hua to usne use sweekaar hi nahin kiya, apitu ekadam apana liya
 The scientific-industrial revolution that took place in Europe after a few centuries, has contributed to the calculation of Indian numerals
 bharat ne gananaa hetu nau ankon tathaa shunya kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Not only this, the local value of numbers was also invented in India
 shunya kaa koi maan nahin he kintu use agar ek ank ke dahini ore likh diya jaae to vah das ingit karegaa kyonki ab 1 kaa sthaneey maan das ho gaya
 If one more zero is increased to the right, this number will be hundred
 is tarah ank ke dahini ore likhe jane par moolyaheen shunya, duusare ankon kaa mulya badha detaa he
 In short, the principle of pricing digits by place is called local value
 is pranali se kisi bhi sankhya ko likhnaa bahut aasaan he
 The three hundred forty-four which we write in the Roman system as CCC XL IV, can be written 344 by Indian law
 is madhyam se badi se badi sankhya bina kisi kathinaayee ke sankshep main likhi ja sakati he
 Indian mathematics also invented the decimal system
 bharat main dashamalav ankon kaa sarvapratham prayog aryabhatta pratham dwaara miltaa he
 It is possible that it was invented much earlier
 kint europe main dashamalav ank kaa saamaanya prachaar satrahavin shatabdi main hua, jiskaa gyaan nishchit hi usne bharat se praapt kiya tha
 These Indian mathematical principles were acquired through Europe to Arabia
 arabi bhashaa main in ankon ko hindasa kehete hai
 Hindsa means 'derived from Hind'
 arabi lipi daaen se baayen likhi jaati he, kintu arabi main ank baayen se daayen likhe jate hai
 This is also evidence that Arabic numerals did not originate in the Arab country with the Arabic language, but are imported from outside
 arabon ke madhyam se jab yah bhartiya ank europe pahunche to unh laga ki ye ank mul rup se arabon dwaara hi avishkaar kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, even today, in Europe, the Indian numerals from one to nine and zero are called 'arabic Numericals'
 islam ke paigambar hazrat mohammad ke purv arab desh main jihalia arthath 'agyaan kaa yug' kaha jaataa he
 There was no progress in knowledge science
 puure kurash kabeeley main, jisase mohammad sahab kaa sambandh tha, keval satraa log kuch likhnaa jaanate the
 But with the establishment of Islam, the Arab Empire expanded to the borders of Spain and North Africa in the west and India in the east
 jo desh parajeet hokar arab samrajya main shaamil hue, unke aarthik prashasan ke liye arabi gananaa-pranali, jo ki atyant praarambhik str kii thi, aparyaapt siddh hui
 Therefore, the Arab rulers were forced to use the numbers of the conquered castes
 khalipha al mansoor ke rajyakaal ke samay main sindh se kuch doot baghdad gaye, jinamein kuch vidwaan bhi the
 He also took with him Brahmasputa siddhanta composed by Brahmagupta and a treatise called Khandakhadyaka along with other texts in Baghdad
 in vidwaanon kii sahaayta se al-fajari evam yaqub khan tarik ne inkaa arabi main anuwaad kiya, jiskaa arabi ganit par vishesh prabhaav padaa
 The respect that Arab people had for Indian knowledge, science and art at that time, is written in al-zahij's booklet - Fakir assam-sudan al-lah binad: pisa nagar ke leonado ne, jisane kisi moore se hindu ganit siikhaa or san 1202 main liber evaiki naamak pustak likhi, jiskaa sanshodhit sanskaran san 1228 main aayaa
 In this, he explained Hindu numerals and their utility
 alekjad r de viladi or jaan aak heliphaks kii pustakon ne bhi ‘hindu ank pranali’ kaa prasar kiya
 Initially it was opposed, but by the middle of the fifteenth century it was accepted by all the countries of Europe
 anya european deshon ne bhartiya ank pranali ko arab se siikhaa
 Since they got this numeral system from Arabia, they named it 'arabic numeral system'
 itihaas kaa sahi gyaan hone ke baad ab ise 'hindu-arabic ank' yaa 'hindu ankapranali' yaa 'bhartiya ankapranali' kaha jane laga he
 There have been many changes in the sign of the Indian numeral system from time to time and country to country

 bhaar prashikshan, kankaleey mansapeshiyon kii shakti or aakaar ko viksit karne ke liye ek aam tarah kaa shakti prashikshan he
 It uses the force of gravity to resist the force generated by the muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction
 Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement
 bhaar prashikshan ko sharir saushthav, olympic bharottolan, power lifting or strongamain se bhinn samajha janaa chahie, jo vyaayaam ke prakaar ke bajaay khel hai
 Weight training, however, is often part of an athlete's training session
 shakti prashikshan ek samaveshi shabd he jo un sabhi vyaayaamon kaa varnan karata he jo shaareerik shakti ko badhaane ke prati samarpit hai
 Weight training is a type of force training in which weights are used instead of elastic, ascentric training or muscular resistance, to increase force
 kshamta prashikshan, aerobics vyaayaam ke saath judaa he jabaki loch prashikshan, streacing vyaayaam ke saath judaa he jaise yoga yaa pilats
 bhaar prashikshan ko praayah bal prashikshan ke ek paryaay ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin vastav main yah samaveshi varg main ek vishisht prakaar he
 Hippocrates wrote explaining the theory behind weight training, that "what is used develops and what is not used gets destroyed
" " bharottolan kii vanshavali kaa pataa, darj itihaas kii shuruyaat ke samay se chalata he jahaan shaareerik kshamtaaon ke prati purushon kaa lagaav anek pracheen lekhon main paaya ja saktaa he
 Progressive resistance training began at least in ancient Greece, when, according to Kimvadanti, the wrestler Milo of Croton raised a newborn calf to the back each day for his training until he was fully grown

 bhaar prashikshan ke buniyadi siddhant anivaary rup se shakti prashikshan ke samaan hai or isamen shaamil hota he doharaav sankhya kaa herpher, set, gati, vyaayaam prakaar or shakti, kshamta or aakaar main vaanchit vruddhi ke liye bhaar parivartan
 reps, set, vyaayaam or bhaar kaa vishisht sangyojan, vyaayaam karne vaale vyakti ke uddeshy par nirbhar karata he; kam doharaav vaale seton ko adhik bhaar ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition to the basic principles of force training, new considerations added by weight training are the use of equipment
 Types of equipment include barbells, dumbbells, pulleys and stacks as load machines and the body's own weight in terms of chin-ups and push-ups
 Different types of loads give different types of resistance and often the same absolute load may have different relative weights depending on the type of equipment used
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ghirani kii koi vishesh vyavastha kaa upyog kiya jaae to dambal kaa upyog karke 10 kilogram bhaar uthaane main kabhi-kabhi ek bhaar stack par 10 kilogram bhaar uthaane se adhik bal lag saktaa he
 In other cases, the load stack may require more force than the equivalent dumbbell load due to additional torque or resistance in the machine
 bhaar prashikshan main 'behatar mudra' kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he jisase harakat ko uchit mansapeshi samooh dwaara sampadit kiya jaae or adhik se adhik bhaar uthaane ke liye sharir ke bhinn angon main bhaar sthanantarit naa ho 
 prashikshan set ke dauraan ek sahi mudra apnaane main vifaltaa se chot lag sakati he yaa prashikshan lakshyon ko puraa karne main mushkil ho sakati he; chunki vaanchit peshi samooh par paryaapt jor nahin padataa, adhibhaar kii seemaa ko praapt nahin kiya jaataa or mansapeshi kii takat badhati nahin he
 The overall benefit of weight training is comparable to most other types of force training; They support increased muscle, tendon and ligament strength, bone density, flexibility, tone, metabolic rate, and posture
 bal prashikshan ke anya prakaar kii tulana main bhaar prashikshan main laabh or simaaen hoti hai
 Resistance training involves the use of elastic or hydraulic resistance to muscle contraction rather than gravity
 bhaar prashikshan pratirodh kaa adhikansh hissaa armbh main hi pradaan karata he, harakat ke sanyukt kone shuruyaat main, jab mansapeshi ko bhaar raashi kii jadta se baahar nikalnaa hota he
 After this point, the total resistance varies depending on the angle of the joint
 isaki tulana main, hydrolic pratirodh, harakat kii puri seemaa main pratirodh kii ek nishchit raashi pradaan karata he, jo harakat kii gati par nirbhar karata he
 The elasticity resistance provides the greatest resistance at the end of the movement when the elasticity element is pulled to the maximum extent
 samametiya vyaayaam, mansapeshi ke bal utpaadan ke aadhaar par pratirodh nishchit raashi pradaan karata he
 This strengthens the specific joint angle of the muscle where isometric exercise occurs, under which little gain of force occurs at the proximal joint angle
 isaki tulana main, bhaar prashikshan, harakat kii us puri seemaa main jisamen jod kaa vyaayaam hota he mansapeshi ko majboot karata he, jiske falswaroop jod kone kii shuruyaat se samaapti tak shaareerik bal main vruddhi hoti he
 Although weight training is similar to bodybuilding, they have different objectives
 sharir shilpi, vazan prashikshan kaa upyog apni mansapeshiyon kaa aakaar, swaroop or samarupata badhaane ke liye karte hai, chaahe sharir saushthav pratiyogita main pratispardhaa ke liye shakti main vruddhi ho yaa naa ho; ve apni mansapeshiyon ke aakaar ko adhiktam or shaareerik vasa kaa atyant nimna str viksit karne ke liye prashikshan karte hai
 Conversely, many weight trainees do training to improve their strength and anaerobic capacity while they do not pay special attention to reducing body fat below normal levels
 sharir saushthav samudaay, bhaar prashikshan ke kai siddhanton, takanic, shabdaawalee or prathaon kaa strot rahaa he
 Weight training allows tremendous flexibility in exercise and weight, which allows bodybuilders to target specific muscles and muscle groups and further helps in achieving specific goals
 beshak, sabhi sharir saushthav ko sharir saushthav pratiyogita main pratispardhaa ke liye shuru nahin kiya jaataa or vastav main sharir shilpiyon kaa adhikansh hissaa pratispardhaa karata hi nahin, balki vah apane swayan ke vyaktigat kaarnon ke liye sharir banaata he, jo khud ko chhodkar kisi bhi anya nirnaayak panel ko dhyaan nahin rakhata
 Weight training is a safe form of exercise when activities are slow, controlled, and carefully defined
 haalanki, jaisaa kii vyaayaam ke kisi bhi rup ke maamle main hota he, anuchit nishpaadan or uchit saavdhaanee baratane main vifaltaa se chot lag sakati he
 When the exercise becomes difficult at the end of a set, there is a feeling of being dishonest, that is, using poor posture involving other muscle groups in the effort
 The impact of effort can go to the weakened muscles which cannot control weight
 For example, squats and deadlifts are used to exercise the largest muscles in the body - the foot and hip - so they require sufficient weight
 shuruyaat karne vaale in vyaayaam ke sampaadan main apni peeth ko jhukaane kii koshish karte hai
 Spinal erectors that allow the lower back to rotate can cause shearing in the vertebrae of the spine and potentially damage the spinal disc
 bhaar prashikshak kasarat shuru karne se pehle aamtaur par 5 se 20 minute kaa samay mansapeshiyon kii ek shuruuaati halki kasarat main bitaate hai
 It is common to stretch the entire body to increase the overall elasticity level; However; Many people only stretch the part they have to exercise that day
 warm ap set bhi mahatvapurn hai
 For example, a similar trainee working on his chest is advised to set up at least two worms before starting his "core tonnage"
 kor tunnej, baari vajan ko sanderbhit karata he jo vastav main aapaki mansapeshiyon main tanaav utpann karata he
 For example, if the trainee has 205 lbs, 225 lbs and 235 lbs on the main set bench then 5 repetitions of 135 and 5 repetitions of 185 would be recommended for worm ups
 Once properly wormized, the lifters gain more force and capacity as the blood flow starts in the muscle groups
 vyaayaam karte samay uthali shwaas lene yaa saans roak kar rakhane se mansapeshiyon or mastishk main oxigen kii aapurti simit hoti he, jisase pradarshan main kami aati he or atyadhik tanaav main dhamneevisphar dwaara blike-out yaa stroke kaa khatra rahata he
 Some people recommend weight trainees to "inhale effort" with a pure conscience and exhale while exhaling
 yah takanic yah sunishchit karti he ki prashikshu, vyaayaam ke sabase kathin hisse ke dauraan saans le, jabaki koi vyakti swatah rup se shwaas roktaa he
 Other coaches recommend trainees to do Valsalva movements during exercise that exert a force on the spine, as the risk of stroke by aneurysm is much lower than an orthopedic injury caused by insufficient stiffness of the torso
 jaisaa ki anya khelon ke maamle main he, bhaar prashikshuon ko paryaapt pani pite hue puure vyaayaam ke dauraan nirjaleekaran se bachanaa chahie, pyaas na lagi ho tab bhi
 jab tak ki aapako charam seemaa main pasinaa naa aa rahaa ho, pyaas kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap pehle se hi nirjalit ho gaye hai
 However, if a player decides when and how much water to drink with his thirst, then there is a risk of his becoming dehydrated
 yah baat vishesh rup se garm vaataavaran main sach he, yaa un logon ke liye jo 65 varsh se upar ke hai
 Some athletic coaches recommend athletes drink about 7 British liquid ounces every 15 minutes while exercising and around 80 British liquid ounces throughout the day
 haalanki, pani kii kitni zarurat he iskaa kahin adhik sahi nirdhaaran aise kiya ja saktaa he ki ek aam vyaayaam satr se pehle or baad main vajan ko naap lenaa chahie, jisase yah nirdhaarit kiya ja sake ki kitna taral padaarth kasarat ke dauraan kharch hua he
 The most fluid loss during exercise is through sweating, but as long as your fluid intake is roughly equal to sweating, hydration levels remain
 adhikansh paristhitiyon main, sports peya, bhaar prashikshan ke dauraan pani kii tulana main adhik shaareerik laabh nahin dete hai
 Nonetheless, high-intensity exercise for a continuous period of at least one hour may require replenishment of electrolytes that can provide a sports drink
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki urja peya, bhaar prashikshan or anya shaareerik vyaayaam main pradarshan main sudhaar karte hai, lekin vastav main, ye urja peya, agar zyada le liya jaae to nirjaleekaran, kampan, hit stroke or dil ke daure ko falit kar sakate hai
 The above reference relates to an 'energy drink' like Red Bull which contains caffeine, not a 'sports drink' which contains simple carbohydrates and water which does not cause the above mentioned bad effects
 lekin yah bhi mahatvapurn he kam samay main bahut pani kaa upbhog nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki isse jal maadakta or anya electrolite gadabadi ho sakati he jo badale main michali, ulti, akshep, mastishk sujan, behoshee or sambhawatah maut kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Inadequate hydration can cause fatigue, soreness, or muscle spasms
 behatar jalyojan vaale vyakti kaa mutr lagbhag berang hona chahie, jabaki ek gahan pilaa rang saamaanya rup se aparyaapt jalyojan kaa ek sanket he
 Exercise should be stopped if you feel sudden pain, so that no further injury occurs
 All discomfort, however, does not reflect injury
 bhaar prashikshan vyaayaam sankshipt lekin bahut teevr hote hai or kai log is str ke prayaas ke anbhyast hote hai
 The expression "no pain, no gain" refers to exercising undergoing the discomfort required by such vigorous efforts, not to deliberately ignore the severe pain that may have resulted from soft tissue injury
 asuvidha, anya karkon se utpann ho sakati hai
 Individuals who perform a large number of repetitions, sets and exercises for each muscle group may experience a burning sensation in their muscles
 in vyaktiyon ko vardhit rakt pravaah ke kaaran apni mansapeshiyon main sujan bhi anubhav ho saktaa he
 The experience of true muscle fatigue is understood as an uncontrollable loss of strength in the muscle, which arises from the nervous system rather than from the muscle fibers themselves
 charam tantrika thakaan ko, asthaayee peshi vifaltaa ke rup main anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 Some weight training programs actively demand temporary muscle failure; The evidence to support such training is mixed at best
 haalanki, unka kaarykram chaahe kuch bhi ho, adhikansh athlete jo ucch tivrata bhaar prashikshan main shaamil hote hai ve apane aahaar niyam ke dauraan mansapeshi vifaltaa kaa anubhav karenge
 Beginners are advised to prepare slowly for the weight training program
 aprashikshit vyaktiyon main kuch mansapeshiyaan anya kii tulana main apekshaakrit majboot ho sakati hai
 An injury can occur in a particular exercise when a primary muscle is stronger than its stationary muscle
 dhire-dhire karne se, mansapeshiyon ko ek duusare ke saapeksh shakti viksit karne kaa samay miltaa he
 This helps reduce delayed onset muscle soreness
 ek gahan vyaayaam kaarykram ko achaanak apnaane se gambhir mansapeshi dard paidaa ho saktaa he
 Un-exercised muscles have cross-linkage that breaks during intense exercise
 jo vyakti gahan shaareerik vyaayaam prashikshan shuru karata he, use aamtaur par kisi chikitsak se paraamarsh karne kii salaah di jaati he, kyonki ho saktaa he hriday kii yaa koi anya agyaat avasthaa aisi ho jo is kriya ke virodh main ho
 Exercises such as bench presses or squats in which the lifter may possibly be trapped under the load, as a result of failure to lift the load, should be performed normally within the power rack or in the presence of one or more spotters, which the load trainee is unable to i can safely place the barbell on the rack
 bhaar prashikshan ke liye aamtaur par vibhinn prakaar ke upkaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, sabase aam hai dambal, barbal or bhaar mashin
 mashiinon, dambal or barbal ke vibhinn sanyojanon kaa vishesh vyaayaam, bhaar prashikshakon ko sharir ke hisson kai tareeke se vyaayaam karne kii anumati detaa he
 Some exercise methods use only physical weight exercises such as press-ups, which do not require equipment, while others, such as pull-ups, do not require any weight, but a pull-up a bar is required which should be strong enough to bear the weight of the trainee
 upkaran ke anya prakaar main shaamil hai: These words combine the prefix "iso" with "tonic" and "metric" with "plio"
 "isotonic" vyaayaam main mansapeshi main lagaai gayi takat nahin badalati he jabaki "pliometric" vyaayaamon main mansapeshi ke urja utpaadan ko badhaane ke liye mansapeshi kii lambaai khinchati or sankuchit hoti he
 Weight training is primarily an isotonic form of exercise, since the force produced by the muscle must not change to push or pull the weight object
 Any object can be used for weight training, but dumbbells, barbells and other specialized equipment are commonly used because they can be adjusted according to specific loads and can be easily caught
 kai vyaayaam vastav main isotonic nahin hote hai kyonki jaise-jaise gati kii seemaa ke madhyam se jodon main gati hoti he mansapeshi par padane vaala bal badalata he
 Speed may be easier or harder depending on the angle of power relative to gravity; For example, a standard bicep curl becomes easier when the hands reach the shoulder because most of the load is borne by the elbow structure
 notilas jaisi kuch mashiinon main vishesh anurupan shaamil he taaki ve jodon ke kone ke baavjood pratirodh ko sthir rakh sake
 Pleometric uses a stretch-reduction cycle of muscles to increase the myotatic reflex
 isamen shaamil he pratirodh ke khilaaf mansapeshi fibron ke badhaav or ghataav kaa twarit prayaavartan
 shaamil pratirodh aksar ek bhaarit vastu hoti he jaise ki ek dawa gend yaa sandbag, lekin yah swayan sharir bhi ho saktaa he jaise kudane vaale vyaayaam main yaa sharir jisamen nihit bhaar jo gati ko pratirodh ke saath aage badhaata he
 Pleometric is used to develop explosive motion and focuses on maximum force rather than maximum energy by compressing the intensity of muscle contraction for as short a duration as possible and is used to effect the impact of a boxer's punch
 Can be used to upgrade, or to increase the vertical jumping ability of a basketball player
 pliometric vyaayaam ko karte samay saavdhaanee baratani chahie kyonki ve vyaayaam ke anya roopon ke mukaable prayukt jodon or putthon par adhik tanaav daalate hai
 Separate exercise is an exercise in which movement is limited to only one joint
 udhaaharan ke liye, quadricep ke liye leg extansion ek pruthak vyaayaam he
 The use of specific types of equipment ensures that other muscle groups are involved only in minimal amounts — they only help the person maintain a stable posture — and the movements occur only around the knee
 adhikansh pruthak vyaayaamon main dambal or barbel ke bajaay mashiinon kaa upyog shaamil he, haalanki vishesh mudraon or jod bracing ke saath sanyukt rup main mukt bhaar kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Mixed exercise is the work of several muscle groups at once and involves movement around two or more joints
 udhaaharan ke liye, leg press main, harakat kuulhe, ghutane or takhne ke jodon ke aasapaas hoti he
 This exercise is primarily done to develop the quadriceps, but also includes hamstrings, glutes, and shin
 mishrit vyaayaam aam taur par un tareekon ke samaan hai jis tareeke se log swaabhaavik rup se kisi chiz ko dhakka dete hai, khinchate hai, yaa uthaate hai, jabaki pruthak vyaayaam aksar thode aprakritik lagate hai
 Mixed exercises typically include dumbbells and barbells, which involve the body and joints as well as more muscles to lift weights
 prayek prakaar ke vyaayaam kaa apana upyog hota he
 Mixed exercises build the basic strength needed for daily stretching, pushing and lifting activities
 pruthak vyaayaam ek routine ko "purna" karne main mahatvapurn hai, jiske liye ve sidhe un mansapeshi samoohon kaa vyaayaam karte hai jinka mishrit vyaayaam main puri tarah se abhyaas nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The type of exercise to be performed also depends on personal goals
 jo log khel main apane pradarshan ko behatar karnaa chaahate hai ve zyaadaatar mishrit vyaayaam par dhyaan kendrit karenge or pruthak vyaayaam ko sirf un mansapeshiyon ko majboot karne ke liye kiya jayega jinke chalate khilaadi pichad ja rahaa he
 Similarly, a powerlifter will focus on specific mixed exercises that are performed in powerlifting competitions
 haalanki, jo log apane bal ko bina aavashyak rup se adhiktam kiye hue apane sharir ke swaroop ko sudhaarna chaahate hai sharir shilpi sahit), ve pruthak vyaayaamon par adhik jor denge
 donon prakaar ke athlete, haalanki aam taur par mishrit or pruthak, donon vyaayaamon kaa upyog karte hai
 Free weights include dumbbell, barbell, medicine ball, sandbell and kettlebell
 Unlike weight machines, they do not force users to specific, certain movements and therefore require more effort by the stabilizer muscles of the individual
 aksar yah tark diya jaataa he ki mukt bhaar vyaayaam, isi kaaran ke chalate behatar hote hai
 Since weight machines can work towards preventing bad postures, they are somewhat safer for novice trainees than free weights
 Furthermore, since users do not have to focus on maintaining better posture, they can focus on the effort put into performing the exercise
 haalanki, adhikansh athlete, sharir shilpi or fitness utsaahi, kaaryaatmak shakti hasil karne ke liye mishrit mukt bhaar vyaayaam kaa upyog karnaa pasand karte hai
 Some free weight exercises can be done by sitting or lying on an exercise ball
 isse ek sahi mudra ko banaae rakhana or adhik kathin ho jaataa he, jo gahare dhad peshiyon kaa vyaayaam karne main madad karata he jo mudra banaae rakhane main mahatvapurn hoti hai
 There are several weight machines commonly found in neighborhood gyms
 smith mashin ek barbal hota he jo lambavat rup se upar yaa neeche jane ke liye simit hota he
 The cable machine has two load stacks that are 2
5 meters apart, with cables passing through adjustable pulleys with different types of handles
 There are also exercise-specific weight machines such as leg presses
 a multijim consists of different types of exercise-specific machines in the same system
 kai mukt bhaar vyaayaamon yaa vyaayaam mashiinon kii ek seemaa yah hoti he ki, lift ke keval ek chote se hisse ke dauraan mansapeshi, gurutvkarshan ke khilaaf adhiktam kaary karti he
 Some exercise-specific machines have an elliptical cam, which varies the resistance such that the resistance and the required muscular force remain the same throughout the series of exercises

 The use of the word ornament in "ornamentation" should be understood in both a broad and narrow sense
 alankaar ke do arth maanya hai - On accepting the wider meaning, the ornamentation is a vizhastra of all the elements of Kavashobha - qualities, rituals, rasa, vritti sound etc
 - in which a detailed description of the nature and importance of these elements is presented
 sankeern arth main grahan karne par yah naam apane aitihaasik mahatv ko abhivyakt karata he
 In the early era of literature, "ornamentation" was considered to be the supreme being of poetry, in the absence of which poetry is lifeless and lifeless like heatless fire
 "alankaar" ke gambhir vishleshan se ek ore "vakrokti" kaa tatv udbhoot hua or duusari ore arth kii samiksha karne par "dhwani" ke siddhant kaa spasht sanket mila
 Therefore, despite being an exponent of poetic elements like rasa, sound, quality, etc
, due to the ornamental predominance, criticism was named "ornamentation" and became popular
 alankaaron kii, visheshat: upama, roopak, swaabhaavokti tathaa atishyokti kii, uplabdhi rugveda ke mantron main nishchit rup se hoti he, parantu vaidic yug main is shaastra ke aavirbhaav kaa pramaan nahin miltaa
 Literary analysis of "upma" from Nirukta's practice appears to be the culmination of criticism from Yasak from the earlier era
 yask ne kisi pracheen acharya ke upmalakshan kaa nirdesh hi nahin kiya he, pratyut karmopama, bhutopama, roopopama, siddhopama, arthopama jaise moulik upama-prakaaron kaa bhi drushtaantpur:sar varnan kiya he 
 It is clear from this that the rise of the ornament had preceded Yask
 kaashyap tathaa vararuchi, brahmadatt tathaa nandiswami ke naam tarunvachaspati ne aadya alankarikon main avashya liye hai parantu inke granth or mat kaa parichay nahin miltaa
 Only the "natyashastra" of Bharata is available nowadays among the Ashtadash Acharyas of Jupiter, Upamanyu, Suvarnabha, Prachatayana, Shesha, Pulastya, Parashar, Utthya etc
 referred to in "kavmimamsa" by Rajasekhar
 anya acharya keval kaalpanik satta dhaaran karte hai
 This much is certain that the rise of Greek criticism centuries before "ornamentation" had become recognized as authentic scripture
 "alankarisarvasv" ke tikaakar samudrbandh ne is shaastra ke anek sampradaayon kii vishistataa kii sundar vivaran prastut kiya he
 Different sects originated in different centuries by giving importance and emphasis to different parts of poetry
 mukhya sampradaayon kii sankhya chah maani ja sakati he- According to their names, these sects have accepted Tattatta, the soul of poetry
 ras sampradaay ke ke mukhya acharya bharat muni hai jinhone nateras kaa hi mukhyat: vishleshan kiya or us vivaran ko avaantar aacharyon ne kavyras ke liye bhi pramanik mana
 The principal Acharyas of the Alankara sect are Bhamah, Dandi, Udbhat and Rudrat
 is mat main alankaar hi kavy kii aatma mana jaataa he
 This sect is adopted as the oldest and most influential in the history of this scripture
 reeti sampradaay ke pramukh acharya vaaman hai jinhone apane "kaavyalankarsutra" main reeti ko spasht shabdon main kavy kii aatma mana he 
 Dandi also gave a great poignant review of the common types of rituals - Vaidarbhi and Gaudi - in his "kavyadarsha", but in his view, poetry has a predominance of ornamentation
 vakrokti sampradaay kii udbhaavna kaa shrey acharya kuntak ko he jinhone apane "vakroktijivit" main "vakrokti" ko kavy kii aatma sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhan inaugurated the sound community in his epochal treatise "dhwanyalok" and was founded by Abhinav Gupta in the Lochan Tika of Dhwanyalok
 mammat, ruyyak, hemchandra, piyushvarsh jayadev, vishwanath kaviraj, panditraj jagannatha --isi sampradaay ke pratishthit acharya hai
 Kshemendra, the eminence of the justification sect, adopted the opinion of the ancient masters like Bharata, Anandavardhana etc
 and adopted the justification element as a major element in poetry and distinguished it as an independent sect
 alankarishastra is prakaar lagbhag do sahasr varshon se kavyatatvon kii samiksha karata aa rahaa he
 This scripture has been guiding critics and poets in reviewing poetry and writing poetry since very ancient times
 yah kavy ke antarang or bahirang donon kaa vishleshan badi maarmikata se prastut karata he
 For the reviewers, there are four very important accounts of the poetry of Alankasastra, which have been carefully interpreted, intimate examination and practical use by Indian literary mystics with many nuances
 ye mahneey kavy tatv hai--auchity, vakrokti, dhwani tathaa ras
 The element of justification is the most widespread theory in folk practice and in poetry
 auchity ke aadhaar par hi rasamimasaa kaa prasaad khadaa hota he
 This quote from Anandavardhana epitomizes the fundamental fact in the review that there is no other reason for rashes except impropriety, and the appropriation of justification is the secret of the rasa - vakrokti lokatikrant gochar vachan ke vinyas kii saahitiyik sangya he
 Any utterance results in the juxtaposition of curvature as a juxtaposition of poetry
 europe main kroche dwaara nirdisht "abhivyanjanawad" vakrokti ko bahut kuch sparsh karanevaala kavyatatv he
 The element of sound is the third major component of Sanskrit criticism
 hamaare aalochakon kaa kahana he ki kavy utana hi nahin prakat karata jitna hamaare kaanon ko prathit hota he, pratyut vah nitant gudh arthon ko bhi hamaare hriday tak pahunchaane kii kshamta rakhata he
 This beautiful captivating meaning is manifested by a specific vocabulary called "vyānjana" and thus the expression is called by the word acoustic
 saubhaahgya kii baat he ki angreji ke maanya aalochak abrcrambi tathaa richards kii drushti is tatv kii ore abhi-abhi aakrisht hui he
 The metaphysics of statehood is the captivating fruit of the psychological review of Indian critics
 kavy alokik anand ke unmilan main hi charitaarth hota he chaahe vah kavy shravy ho yaa drishy
 The heart of the poem is the poignant and graceful aspect of poetry rather than the aesthetic, the Indian criticism is absolutely insistent on this fact
 bhartiya aalochana jivan kii samasya ko sulajhane vaale darshan kii chaanbin se kathampi paranmukh nahin hoti or is prakaar yah paashchaatya jagat ke teen shastron-- "poetics", "retariks" tathaa "asthetics"- kaa pratinidhitiv akele hi apane aap karti he
 In antiquity, seriousness and psychological analysis, it is more important than Western criticism; There can be no two opinions about this

 Tulsidas writes that just as the retarded ant wants to fathom the sea, his ego grew in the same way and due to this ego he- vah mudh mand buddhi jaint kauwe ke rup main sita ji ke charnon main chonch markar bhaag gaya

 kuch irani vidwaanon kaa kahana he ke shaayad yahi "al burz" ke naam kii prerana ho
 The word "barzati" is a feminine form of the word "barzant" from the ancient Avastai, meaning "elevated"
 aadhunik farsi main "barzant" badal kar "buland" ho gaya he, jo ki hindi main bhi prayog hota he
 Because both Sanskrit and Avastai are inter-language languages of the indo-european language family, "barzant" also has a similar homogeneous word in Sanskrit - "brihat", which changed from Hindi to "much"

 paitruk raktasrav yaa haemophilia ek anuvaanshik beemaari he jo aamtaur par purushon ko hoti he or auraton dwaara failati hoti he
 Haemophilia is a genetic disease in which blood flowing outside the body does not accumulate
 iske kaaran chot yaa durghatana main yah jaanaleva sabit hoti he kyonki rakt kaa bahna jald hi band nahin hota
 According to experts, the cause of this disease is the lack of a blood protein, which is called the 'clotting factor'
 is factor kii visheshta yah he ki yah behate hue rakt ke thakke jamaakar uskaa bahna roktaa he
 The number of patients suffering from this disease is less in India

 Thromboplastic has the ability to quickly clot blood
 khun main iske na hone se khun kaa bahna band nahin hota he
 Symptoms of this disease are: formation of blue marks in the body, bleeding from the nose, bleeding inside the eye and swelling of joints, etc
 jaanch karne par pataa chalaa ki is rog main khun ke thakka hone kaa samay bad jaataa he
 It is good to keep giving blood transfusions again and again
 atyaadhik raktasrav main 100 ghan centimetre kaa rudhir-aadhaan prati 8 ghante ke antar par diya jaataa he
 The effect of blood transfusion lasts for a few hours, does not last for several days
 jab tak raktastrav purna rup se band na ho jaay, athwa niyantran main na aa jaay, rudhir - aadhaan kriya ko aavashyaktaa na ho tab bhi 100 se 180 ghan centimetre nutan plasma athwa himatuly sheethal plasma diya jaataa he, kyonki isamen paitrik raktastrav ke sabhi vipareet gunon kaa samavesh rahata he
 There is a decrease in the time the blood clot is formed, or it becomes similar to the time it takes to become a natural clot

 Indian scholars consider this civilization to be of eternal tradition
 According to Western scholars, a community of Aryans arrived in India around 1500 BCE and this civilization started with their arrival

 vedon ke atirikt sanskrit ke anya kai grantho kii rachana bhi isi kaal main hui thi
 The Vedangasutraon is composed in arranging these Vedic texts of the mantra Brahmana and Upanishads
 Later Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranoki were composed, which are considered as the source of knowledge of this period

 Scholars are not unanimous in determining the time of the Rigveda
 sabase pehle maiks mular ne vedon ke kaal nirdhaaran kaa prayaas kiya
 He arbitrarily gave 200–200 years of creation of three texts of Vedic literature, going backwards from Buddhism, and thus considered the Rigveda's creation period to be around 1200 BCE, but certainly no assessment of his assessment Was not the basis
 vaidic kaal ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- rigvaidic kaal or uttar vaidic kaal

 Max Müller then acknowledged that "there is no power on earth that can tell for sure that Vedic mantras were composed in 1000 BCE or 1500 BCE or 2000 or 3000"
