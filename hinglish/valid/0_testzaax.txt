 During your childhood you saw eight people from the village dying of the mad wolf bite
 unki dardebhari chikhon ko aap bhul nahin sake the
 Even in puberty, when this past incident took place on the table, you used to get restless
 par aap padhane-likhane main vishesh tej nahin the
 Still, there were two qualities in you, which are necessary for success in science - curiosity and endurance
 yuvavastha main aapane likhaa tha ki shabdkosh main teen shabd atyant mahatvapurn hai: ichhashakti, kaam tathaa safalataa
 After finishing college, started working in a chemist to achieve his goal
 yahan par aapane crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa kuch mahatvapurn anusandhan bhi kiye
 You got good fame in the form of chemicals from them

 Only a week after the meeting, you proposed marriage to Mary

 What is the reason for this? lui pasture ne apane sookshmdarshi yantra dwaara madiraa kii pariksha karne main ghanton bitaa die
 In the end you found that very young creatures called bacteria sour the wine
 ab aapane pataa lagaaya ki yadi madiraa ko 20-30 minute tak 60 centegrade par garam kiya jaataa he to ye jeevanu nasht ho jate hai
 The heat is lower than the boiling temperature
 isse madiraa ke swaad par koi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 Later you used the same principle to keep the milk sweet and pure
 yahi doodh 'pascharit doodh' kehalaata he
 One day Louis Pasteur realized that if these tiny bacteria are in foods and liquids, they can also be in the blood of living animals and people
 ve beemaari paidaa kar sakate hai
 At the same time, there was a terrible epidemic in chickens of France called 'chuja's Cholera'
 lakhon chuje mar rahe the
 The henkeepers prayed for you to help us
 aapane us jeevanu kii khoj shuru kar di jo chuujon main haija failaa rahaa tha
 You see those bacteria floating around in the blood of dead chicks
 aapane is jeevanu ko durbal banaaya or injection ke madhyam se swasth chuujon kii deh main pahunchaaya
 This did not cause the chickens with vaccine cholera
 aapane tikaa lagane kii vidhi kaa avishkaar nahin kiya par chuujon ke haije ke jeevanuon kaa pataa laga liya
 After this Louis Pasteur made a vaccine for cows and sheep for the disease called anthrax: but you could not do them well after getting the disease: but you succeeded in preventing the disease from happening
 aapane bhedon ke durbal kiye hue enthraiks jeevanuon kii sui lagaai
 It used to be that the sheep had very mild anthrax; But he was so mild that he never fell ill and after that he would never get that fatal disease
 aap or aapke sahyogiyon ne maason france main ghumkar sahasron bhedon ko yah sui lagaai
 This protected the French cow and sheep industry
 aapane tarah-tarah ke sahasron prayog kar daale
 Many of them were also dangerous
 aap vifaille virus vaale bhayanak kutton par kaam kar rahe the
 So, you solved this problem
 aapane thode se vifaille virus ko durbal banaaya
 Then he prepared the vaccine for this virus
 is tike ko aapane ek swasth kute kii deh main pahunchaaya
 After applying the fourteen vaccines, he was protected against rabies
 aapaki yah khoj badi mahatvapurn thi; par aapane abhi maanav par iskaa prayog nahin kiya tha

 If nothing is done, nine-year-old Jozef will slowly die from suffering from hydrotherapy
 aapane balak jojeff kii pariksha kii
 Perhaps some way to save him can be done
 bahut varshon se aap is baat kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas kar rahe the ki jalasantras ko kaise roka jaae? aap is rog se vishesh rup se ghrinaa karte the
 Now the question was whether the boy should dare to apply needle on Josephine's rabies vaccine
 balak kii mrityu kii sambhaavna thi
 But his death is certain even after the needles are planted
 is duvidha main aapane tatkaal nirnay liya or balak jojeff kaa upachaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 For ten days, you kept applying the increasing amount of vaccine of the child Joseph and then a great surprise occurred
 balak jojeff ko jalasantras nahi hua
 On the contrary, he started getting better
 itihaas main pratham baar maanav ko jalasantras se bachaane ke liye sui lagaai gai
 You really gave this unique gift to mankind
 aapke deshavaasiyon ne aapako sab sammaan evam sab padak pradaan kiye
 He built the Pasteur Institute in honor of you: but Kirti and Aishwarya did not change you

 Swaniki was studied in ancient India from about 2500 years ago, we find evidence of it in his Sanskrit grammatical treatise Ashtadhyayi composed by Panini in 500 BC, which describes in detail the location of utterances and the method of pronunciation
 has been done

 In modern times, the study of Swaniki started with the efforts of Joshua Steele and Alexander Bell etc
 bhashaa kii laghuttam ikai 'swan' he
 It is also named sound
 dhwani ke abhaav main bhashaa kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 In linguistics, the study context of phonetics is called 'phonology'
 dhwani shabd dhwan dhaatu main in pratyay ke yoga se bana he
 Phonology has become an important branch in the serious study of linguistics
 iske liye dhvanishastra, dhvanyalochan, swanvigyaan, swaniti aadi naam die gaye hai
 In English, the terms 'phonetics' and 'phonology' are used

 Swann's study reveals three aspects - swan utpann karanevaale vyakti yaa vaktaa ko swanutpaadak kii sangya dete he
 The collector or receiver is the listener, who accepts the sound
 samvahak yaa sanvahan karanevaala madhyam jo mukhyatah vaayu kii tarangon ke rup main hota he
 The essentiality of the three organs is proven automatically in the swan process
 jab mukh ke vibhinn angon main se kinhin do yaa don se adhik avyavayon ke sahyog se dhwani unpann hogi tabhi swan kaa astitv sambhav he
 In the absence of the role of sound-producing components, Swann's existence is impossible
 dhwani-utpaadak avyavon kii upyogi bhoomika ke baad yadi samvahak yaa sanvahan madhyam kaa abhaav hoga, to swan kaa abhas asambhav he
 Suppose a person makes a sound while sitting in an air-tight chamber, then the air wave cannot come out of the chamber and the person outside cannot accept sound
 is prakaar swan prakriya avaruddh ho jaati he
 In the absence of a third organ collector or listener, the existence of sound production automatically becomes zero
 is prakaar swan prakriya main vaktaa, madhyam teenon kaa hona anivaary hota he
 There are two forms of sound that are meaningful and meaningless
 bhashaa vigyaan main keval sarthak dhvaniyon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In the sound production process, air comes out from both the mouth or nose
 is prakaar dhwani ko anunasik tathaa niranunasik do virgo main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 In the pronunciation of the sounds, the air originates from the nasal cavity along with the mouth-sound
 use anunasik dhwani kehete hai
 The sounds in which the vayu originates only from the mouth and mouth are called nirnunasik or oral sounds
 dhwani kii tivrata or mandatha ke aadhaar par use naad, shwaas tathaa japit, teen virgo main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 When the vocal nerves are joined to each other in the production of sound, the wind pushes them out of the middle, such a sound is called sound sound, eg-g, g, j etc
 ise saghosh dhwani bhi kehete hai
 When the vocal nerves are away from each other, the air of expiration comes out easily without friction
 aisi dhwani ko ‘shwaas’ yaa aghosh kehete hai; yatha k, t, p aadi
 When there is a very slow sound, air comes out from any corner of both the vocal cords
 aisi dhwani ko japit dhwani kehete hai
 Phonology has a special importance in language studies because knowledge of other greater units is based on it
 iske hi antargat vibhinn dhwani utpaadak avyavon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 After pure knowledge of swans, pure writing gets a strong foundation
 uccharan main honevaale vividh sandarbhon ke parivartanon kaa gyaan bhi sambhav hota he
 In phonology, the study of various sounds is accompanied by a detailed analysis of the process of their production
 isi adhyayan kram main dhwani utpaadak vibhinn angon kii rachana or unki bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Sound quality and its significance are also represented

 Metal and wood arts have been an integral tool in the life of human civilization in every country and in every era, through which man has tried to make his life easy, happy and prosperous
 pragaitihaasik kaal se hi prakruti ko vijayi athwa pramohit karne ke liye or jivan main ek niyamit niyantran laane ke liye, bhay se ho athwa shraddha se, jab manushya ne apane chaaron ore ke vaataavaran kii taal se apane jivan ko sanyojit kiya to uskaa yah praytn kala ko keval sundarataa ke liye varan karnaa na tha balki usamen uske jeevananirvaah or dainik kriya kaa lakshya kendrit tha
 We see that the art of the stone age, the copper age and the ages after it is based on this ideal and goal, not just to beautify an unusable object
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan ek ore unke dwaara bane hue dainik kaaryon main kaam aanevaali in dhaatu or kashtha kii vastuon main bhi unke jivan, dharm or saamaajik vyavastha kii chhap spasht he, vahaan duusari ore inhen vastuon dwaara ham unamem nihit supt saundarya bodh kii jhaanki bhi pate hai
 It is not right to say that wood was used later than metal
 haan, yah avashya he ki lakdi kam tikaoo madhyam hone ke kaaran usamen udhaaharan hamen itane pracheen nahin praapt hote, jitne dhaatu, haddi athwa pathar main milte hai
 The architecture of the historical era, whether it is a dwelling dwelling, temple, Chaitanya or Vihara, confirms that all these things would have been made in wood before that
 lomas kii kuti, sanchi ke dwaar or khidki, ajanta kii gufaaon kii banaavat iskaa jwalanth pramaan hai jo pathar main bani hokar bhi unki kalpana or yojana lakdi ke madhyam par hi aadhaarit he
 Although these useful items of daily life were not created with the goal of fine arts, we must be able to see the part of the art of collective life in them and if these are called artistic things then we will not forget them
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath saath maanav ne yadhyapi apni nirmit vastuon main upyogi dharna ko nahin choda par ham dekhte he ki uski kalapriyata ne apni pravaahashiltaa dwaara kuch maatra main unhen lalit kala ke sundar upadan bana diya he
 It is only a gift of the modern era that where art became individual and not collective, on the other hand, its usefulness was for art, art, on the other hand, it is another matter that the effect of this useless art is also our useful things
 But lay and in a way he took a collective form
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main yatayaat ke viksit sadhano dwaara kala kaa ek naveen rup antarrashtriyata bhi saamne aa rahaa he jahaan kisi raashtra kii raajnneetik, saamaajik athwa dharmik paridhiyaan tut chuki he or maanavtaa ek sanyukt drushtikon main aabaddh hokar bhi, kala vyaktigat moulikta ko nahin chhod pai he kyonki manovaigyanik vichaaron se bhi abhibhoot hokar vyaktivishesh ke antaraal main supt laalasaaon, kaamanaayon or pratirodhi ashankaon ko bhi ab kala ke upaadaanon kii uchit saamagree maan liya gaya he
 The metal sculpture of Mohenjodaro's dancer is clearly reflected in the scale, attitude and essential qualities of the art of that period and if we look in the later metal sculptures which started to become abundant from the tenth century, the dancer It is full of all the qualities that a high quality idol should have
 nataraj kii kaanse kii murti kii bhavpurn gatishiltaa main ham paramparaagat kala saundarya ke sab lakshanon ke saath saath aadhunik maapdandon dwaara bhi use sarvagun sampann pate hai
 The Shata Ardhanayan-nominated mildness of the idol of Napali Tara, the unnecessary adornment around it, which gradually increased in later statues, could not hide from anyone
 yadhyapi is prakaar kii yah sabhi murtiyan dharmik bhaawanaaon ko lekar baniin tathaapi unke kalasaundarya ke kaaran vah sarvapriya dharmanirpeksh ho sakin
 There were three types of metal sculptures, cast, beaten and cast
 dhaali hui murtiyan prarambh main mom dwaara bana lee jaati thim
 And then a thick coating was made by dipping the idol in a thin fine clay solution
 neeche lagi hui mom kii nalee dwaara jo prayek murti ke aavashyaktaanusaar sthanon par laga lee jaati he garmi dekar mom baahar nikaal diya jaataa or usee rikt sthaan ko unheen naleevaale maarg se dhaatu dwaara bhar diya jaataa he
 All the idols of silver, gold, bronze, brass and Ashtadhatu are molded in this way
 duusari prakaar kii murtiyon main dhaatu kii chadar ko peeche kii ore se peet petakar ubhaar liya jaataa he or ise ubhare hue vibhinn ang ke kholon ko jod diya jaataa he
 Sometimes the decorations of the molten idols are made by beating and folded later or the throne or ornamentation of the molten idols remain in the mold
 dakshin bharat, nepal or gujarat aisi murtiyon kaa centre rahaa he or ab bhi vahaan paramparaagat style or vidhi se in murtiyon kaa nirmaan hota he, yadhyapi ab inkaa lakshya dharmik kam or adbhut vastuon kii rachana kar videshi mudra arjan karnaa adhik he
 Apart from the idols, the worship work temples and the things which are used in daily life are still made in the traditional style like Kalash, Dharti, Pradeep, Full Kumbh Hour, Chhip Lakshmi, Sarautha, Knives etc
 which are still lively and are still a local style Let's charm
 kashtha kala ke adhiktar praapt namoonay hamen madhyayug se purv ke nahin milte par unki kalanipunata or kaushalparakashtha dekhakar sahaj main hi maan liya ja saktaa he ki us ucch koti ke str tak pahunchne ke liye is prakaar kii kala kii parampara bahut puraani rahi hogi
 The best examples of woodwork of sandalwood, walnuts, rosewood, avanus, jackfruit, sheel, neem, are found in the buildings of Kathmandu, Ahmedabad, and the large size chariots used during the Rath Yatra in Kerala
 swatantra murtiyon kii apeksha in sabhi kaa dhyey kashtha vastu kala kaa ek alankrita ang hona tha par kalakaaron ko apni apni shilp chaturata or praudhata dikhaane kaa kaaphi avasar mila he or ye lakdi ke makaan, aradhana athwa vasasthaan hone ke kaaran, dharmik vishay par hi adhik protsaahan hone par bhi ham pate hai ki dharmanirpeksh vishay jaise shikari, pashupakshi, dainik jivan main tallin narnariyon se in bhawanon kii khudaai otprot he
 After excavation, oil must be used to refine these buildings at the time of the annual celebrations, due to which the wood-like medium has been able to bear the cruel brunts of time and climate
 kuch bhawan to ab bhi kal ke bane hue se nae dikhte hai
 Sandalwood and walnut wood, which is the hub of Mysore and Kashmir, have been brought into the art of making small and large items of daily life of art forms and animal husbandry, shoulders, boxes etc
 uskaa vishesh kaaran is prakaar kii lakdi kii durlabhta or badi paridhi ke ped na hona hi he
 Even during the Mughal period, this art flourished and for the work of the Aavnus, whose elaborate combs, combs, kaladan cans etc
 were made
 uttar pradesh ke nagar nagina or saharanpur vikhyath hue
 From the same period, the inlay work of brass wire with the use of brass wire, oyster or different types of wood on wood also started
 sabhi kalaon kii bhanti dhaatu or kashtha kii murtiyan bhi videshi rajya ke bhinn drushtikon ke kaaran or uchit sangrakshan tathaa protsaahan ke abhaav main nirjeev evam roodhigrast ho gayi
 Somewhere he was lost, and somewhere his skilled craftsmen took up other trades for the survival
 dhani shikshit varg videshi vastuon kii sabhyataa or kala kii chakachaundh main apni parishkrut ruchi gavaan baithe
 Educated artists also followed foreign art, but over the years, now these lost magnificent arts are getting noticed and many budding artists have made wood sculpture their medium in which we today have a beautiful co-ordination of international art with Indian traditional style
 Find it
 prayek madhyam kaa apana swatantra gun or charitra he jo duusare madhyam main hamen nahin miltaa
 The metal idol should not look like wood and the idol of wood should not look like stone, cement or metal and by examining its inherent properties, keeping in mind the medium, the vein, the color, the form, the artist should imagine his work and his secret beauty Do it so that a mixture of fluctuations, lines, etc
, presents an original work, this is the aim and purpose of the modern artist
 bahyarup kuch bhi ho par hamaari kala ke mul siddhant, jo shadang ke antargat aate hai, ab bhi kisi bhi maap dand se khare utarate hai chaahe drushtikon kitna hi ati aadhunik ho

 stallmen ko laga ki is tarah se kamputer sauftware kuch khaas logon ke paas rah jaayegaa or uskaa sarvangin vikaas nahin ho paayegaa
 That is why he left his institute and started the Gnu project under Free Sources Foundation
 isamen us tarah ke sauftware likhane shuru kiye jo ki kaupilefted hon
 He named such software as free-software
 yah isaliye, kyon ki unke mutabik isamen logon ko kamputer program yaa sauftware ko sanshodhan karne kii swatantraaa he unka kahana he ki free ko aise mat socho jaisaa free bear main he par aise dekho jaisaa ki freedom of spich main he
 According to the Free Sources Foundation website, in his words, 'free software' is a matter of liberty, not price
 To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer' free yaa kapilefted sauftware main nimna baaten mukhya hai - isamen sorce code hameshaa prakashit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke sauftware ke liye koi paisa yaa royalti nahin deni padati he par yadi uske sambandh main yadi aap koi sarvice de rahen he to sarvice dene kaa paisa le sakate hai

 But if such software is distributed without modification or after modification, then it will have the same conditions as it was before ie sourcecode will have to be published; Others must be given freedom to amend; And no money or royalty can be charged for software
 stallmen ne kuch vakeelon kii madad se general public license likhaa, jisamen is tarah kii ghoshnaa evam shart he jo kisi bhi saftware ko kaupileft karata he
 Therefore, this kind of software is also called GPOLD software
 yani ki free sauftver yaa kaupilefted sauftver yaa gipield sauftver ek hi tarah ke sauftver ke paryaayavachi shabd hai
