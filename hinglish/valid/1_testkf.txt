 in yuddheey kavitaaon kii rachana kii prerak baloch jati ke itihaas kii vahi ghatnaayen thim jo us kaal main ghatit hui thim; jaise rind tathaa laashari kabeelon kaa 30 varshiya sangharsh, haani-shah mureed ke amar prem kii vishad kahani, bebarg tathaa giraanaz tathaa aakhyaan, shahdaad tathaa maahnaaz kii virahakatha, humayun kii mitrataa ke kaaran panipat ke yuddh main shahdaad tathaa uske anuyaayiyon kii veerta evam saahas, jusur tathaa gayur bal kii eknamata ke liye bebarg pusar ke viruddh yuddh tathaa isi prakaar kii anya ghatnaon ne aisi ucch koti kii yuddheey kavita ko janm diya, jo farsi ke chandashastra kii kathinaaiyon se khaali he par vednaa, ullas tathaa prabhavotpaadakta main anupam he
 Till now they are read and heard with great interest in fairs and gatherings
 18veen shatee isvi main baloch bhashaa main aisi premakavita kaa prachaar hua, jisamen saundarya tathaa prem bharaa he tathaa kesh, kapol va adhar kii gaatha he
 The poem of this period is the story of a clean feeling of beauty and a sad heart that is far from the beloved, which is also the ideal of the emotions of Baloch tendency
 premugeeton kaa sabase prasiddh kavi jam darak mana jaataa he jo mir naseer khan huri kaa sabhakavi tha or baloch shaasha ne ise "shaayaron kaa shaayar" kii oopaadhi di thi
 All the songs and poems that he composed himself are mentioned only with beautiful faces, black hair, red fingers with henna, teeth from muktawali, stiletto eyebrows, color rings and fragrant pallas
 par is kaal ke sabhi kavi loukik premika kii khoj main vyast nahin hai
 It is of course that they go out in search of a moving and visible girlfriend, but it happens that they find the real girlfriend while searching for such a cosmic girlfriend

 Famous poets of this period include Tavakkuli, Mulla Fazil Seemak, Mulla Karimdad, Izzat Panjgori Mulla Bahram, Mulla Qasim and Naga Agar of Malik Dinar

 The nature of Baloch literature was also influenced by the performance of his knowledge and arts
 baloch kaviyon ne kalpana ke nae rup apanaae
 Jasur wrote poems that had new words and new plans
 aaazaad jamaldini ne angrejon kii shakti main jati tathaa desh kii avnati samajhi
 Muhammad Hussain His saw the desires of the poor under the wheels of motors and cars
 javaan saal ne adharmik vichaaron ke prakaashan kii roak tham ke liye prashansaatmak tathaa vyaavhaarik kavitaayen prastut kin
 Rahm Ali Bazlaz also could not remain unfamiliar with the future impact of the British arrival in Balochistan and his style and language underwent a special change
 ab aisi kavitaayen kii jane lagi jinamein balochon ko unke beete gaurav kaa samaran dilaayaa gaya, swatantraaa devi kii prashansa main geet kahe gaye or jansadharan ko swatantry yuddh ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya
 In 1947, when independence was found, the Baloch language like other provincial languages of Pakistan also progressed
 radio pakistan queta ke sthapit hone se balochi kaviyon tathaa gadhy lekhakon kaa utsaah badha or nae lekhakon kaa ek puraa mandal maidan main aa utraa
 At this time, Muhammad Hussain, his, Azad Jamaldini and Gul Khan Nasir are old writers, yet they get new writers in terms of ideas and expression

 {{{1}}} Odissi is one of the two famous Greek epics
 elliod main homer ne trogen yuddh tathaa uske baad kii ghatnaon kaa varnan kiya he jabaki odisi main try ke patan ke baad ethaka ke raja odisius kii, jise ulisys naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, us romaanchak yatra kaa varnan he jisamen vah anek kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karte hue, 10 varsh baad apane ghar pahunchataa he
 Odyssey bc Written in the eighth century
 yah kahan likhi gai is sambandh main mana jaataa he ki yah is samay ke yunaan adhikrut main sagar tat ionia main likhi gai jo ab turki kaa bhaag he
 Odesi tells the saga of the daring deeds that occur when returning to the homeland after the Battle of Troy, a mythical hero named Odes or Ulysse
 jis prakaar hindu ramayana main lanka vijay kii kahani padhakar aanandit hote hai
 Similarly, the story of the Greek hero Ulysses in the Odyssey is delightful
 try kaa rajkumaar sparta kii rani hellen kaa apharan kar try nagar le gaya
 To avenge this insult, all the kings and heroes of Greece invaded Troy
 par na nagar kaa phatak tutaa or na pracheer hi laanghi ja saki
 Finally the Greek army did a trick
 ek lakdi kaa khokhla ghoda pahiayukt patle par jadaa gaya
 Leaving him, they returned from their ships
 troy ke logon ne sochaa ki unani apane devtaa kii murti chhodkar niraash ho chale gaye
 When they pulled it into the city, the archway of the main gate had to be cut
 raatri ko jab troy khushiyon manaa rahaa tha, khokhli ashv murti se unani sainikon ne nikalakar chupchaap troy kaa phatak khol diya
 The Greek army, which did not go back but hid nearby, entered Troy
 ek hellen ke peeche troy nasht ho gaya thik vaise hi jaise sita ke peeche ravan kii swarnamayi lanka nasht hui thi
 This created the phrase 'the Trojan Horse' in English
 ‘odesi’ manishi greek captain odesus kii saahasik vaapasi yatra kii gaatha he
 While returning from Troy, his ship fell into a storm
 vah bahut dinon tak idhar udhar bhatakta rahaa
 After this he returned to his country
 mangalacharan - he devi, tu us kushal maanav odesius kii katha gane kii shakti de jisane try ke durg ko dharashayi kar diya or jo saare sansar main bhatakta rahaa, jisane vividh jatiyon or nagaron ko dekha tathaa uttal samudr kii laharon par praanon kii raksha ke liye ghor ksht sahan kiya
 This story is told in twenty-four sergos, in which canto continued to suffer and wander due to the wrath of warrior Odesius Varuna for ten years after the war in one
 is kshtmay kaal ke antim bhaag main katha prarambh hoti he
 In canto four, Telemakus meets Minilas and Helen
 sarg nau main, odesian dwaara siconijon ke yuddh kii kahani kaa varnan he
 Odesius said when the war of war ended, on the way to the home we invaded the Syconies, were defeated
 nau din nau raat lagaataar uttari hawa ke dhakke se hamaare ran-pot raste se bahut dur bhatak gayi
 Finally, we reached the land of Lotus - this lotus is a sweet plant, due to which our sailors were engulfed in utter bliss
 jabardastee unhen ghasitkar pot par laayaa gaya
 Then later we reached the land of a Nayavan demons and were imprisoned in the cave of a demon by our foolishness
 phir chaturata se use sharaab pilaakar uski aankh bade kunde se phod di evam savere rakshas ne jab guphaadwar apni bhedon ko baahar nikalne ke liye kholaa tab ek-ek bhed ke saath apane ko baandhakar ham nikal gayi
 This demon was the son of the ruler of the sea and earthquake Varun
 isi se varun ham par cruddh ho gayi
 Canto thirteen describes the management of Odesian's visit by the Athetya king
 sarg ekkis main ethnay dwaara pinilopi ko swayamvar kaa suzav kii katha he
 Canto 24 is the story of the evil Kumari's souls in Adhumalok or their relatives, the plan of war and the beginning and end of war and peace and peace
 odisi 24 anuvaakon main vibhakt he or iskaa ghatnakaal 42 din kaa he
 In the initial verse, the guardian of Odysseus at the assembly of the gods complains to Athena Zeus that Odysseus left Troy 10 years ago but has not yet reached home; Because, a demon named Calypso detains him in an island called Augizia, while Pinatapi's gatherers in Ithaca are not only creating hustle but also looting Odysseus' property
 jiyas ethina ko yathavivek kaary karne kii anumati de detaa he or vah odisius ke putr telemacas ke sanmukh menter ke rup main upasthit hokar use paraamarsh detii he ki vah apane ghar main pinalopi ke panigrahathiyon kaa pravesh roak de tathaa swayan apane pita kaa pataa lagane ke liye yatra kare
 In the second, third and fourth paragraphs, the story of Telemacus is played
 telemacas ek sabha kaa aayojan kar usamen pinalopi ke panigrahalarthiyon kii bhartsana karata he or menter rupi ethina kii sahaayta se ek jahaaj praapt karke apni maan ko bataae bina hi yatra par chal padataa he
 Along with Mentor, he reaches Pilos and meets the old Nestor where he learns the true details of the Trajan War
 pilos se vah sparta jaataa he
 There, i meet Helen's wife Helen and prepare to return home
 uske turant baad kavi ethaka sthit odisius ke prasaad kii ghatnaayen prastut karata he
 On one hand Pinlopi is troubled by his son's sudden disappearance, and on the other hand his entourage sends a ship under the supervision of Antinus to the port, arranging that Telemacus be killed as soon as he returns so that Odysseus' possessions and his occupation of Pinelopi Possible paanchaven anuvaak main pun: devataaon kii sabha kaa drishy he jisamen ethina ek baar phir odisius kii mukti kaa praytn karti he
 Zeus sends Hermes to Calypso, and at her insistence, she makes a raft of trees and sends Odysseus to Ithaca
 17 din tak taron kii sahaayta se yatra karne ke baad jaise hi odisius fiaisia dweep ke nikat pahunchataa he, samudr ke devtaa posidon ke krodh ke kaaran uskaa bedaa tut jaataa he or vah laharon main doobane utaraate lagata he
 Then Leucothia, the nymph of the sea, gives him a mortal handkerchief with the help of which he finally reaches Fiacia
 chathe anuvaak main fiaisia ke raja elsinas kii beti nausika swapn main ethina se aadesh paakar agali subah samudratat par apane kapade dhone jaati he jahaan uski bhent nange odisius se hoti he
 In the seventh verse, she brings him home with his clothes on
 aathven anuvaak main raja elsinas darbar main odisius kaa swaagat karata he
 On this occasion, Bhat sings a Trajan-war-related song, and Odysseus starts to cry distracted
 raja usase rone kaa kaaran poochta he to odisius ko apana vaastavik parichay dena padataa he
 In the next three passages, everyone recounts his 10-year thrilling journey after the fall of Odysseytrae
 12wein anuwak main odiciamas fiaisia ke jaadui jahaaj par ethaka pahunchataa he jahaan ethina ek gaderiye ke rup main usase milti he or use bhikhaari ke rup main parivartit kar detii he taaki uski patni ke panigrahanarthi use pahachaanakar koi haani na pahunchaa saken
 In the 13th verse, Athena dispatches Odysseus to his suitor and goes to Sparta himself, and orders Telemacus to return to Ithaca quickly
 14wein anuvaak main odisius tathaa shookarpal kii baatcheet he
 In the 15th episode, Telemacus escapes the conspiracy of his mother's entreaties and returns home safely
 16wein anuvaak main telemacas shookarpal ke ghar main apane pita ko pahchaan letaa he
 Later, the father plans to get rid of Pinelupi's diacritics
 17wein tathaa 18wein anuvaak main bhikshukveshi odisius apane prasaad main pahunchataa he jahaan uskaa purana kutta ergas use pahachaanakar khushi ke maare dam tod detaa he
 At the same time, Odysseus sees the rationale of Pinlopi's attendants in the palace, which also makes the proper role of his terrible act of killing them later
 19wein anuvaak main odisia tathaa pinalopi kii aamane saamne baatcheet hoti he parantu pinalopi apane pati ko pahchaan nahin paati, jabaki uski puraani dhai uriclia uske pair main bachapan main bane kshatchihn ko dekhakar use pahchaan jaati he
 In the 20th verse, Odysseus wakes up overnight thinking of many things due to anger
 21 wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane panigrahanarthiyon ko chunauti detii he ki ve sab pari pari odisius ke dhanush kaa chilla chadhaakar is tarah tir chalaaen ki vah vishaal vriksh main tange 12 chhallon ke bich se nikal jaae
 All fail, but the beggar Odysseus shoots arrows from between the rings
 22 wein anuvaak main mahakavy kaa charmotkarsh he
 Odysseus kills all of Pinloopy's diacritics with arrows
 koi bhi ek, bachakar nikal nahin paata, kyonki vishaal kaksh ke sabhi daravaajein pehle hi band kar die gaye the 23wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane pati ko pahachaanati he or donon ke milan kaa hridaygrahi evam marmasparshi drishy saamne aata he
 In the last or 24th chapter of the Maha Kavya, which some critics consider to be a projectile, the angel Mercury carries the souls of all the descendants of Pinloopy to the lower and infested regions of hell where they are given various kinds of tragic punishments
 isi bich odisius nagar ke baahar kheton main jaakar apane pita larties se miltaa he
 Finally, there is a grand feast to commemorate Odysseus's return home and the script concludes with information that ithaka is established
 elliod kaa kathanak mahaj 50 dinon kaa he - dasven varsh ke antim do maas ke andar kii ghati ghatnaayen
 If the plot had started from the beginning of the story, it should have started with the coincidence of Lida and Hans
 par homer katha ke antim bhaag ko pakadta he
 In between, he refers to the earlier story, not even in a sequence
 greek shrotasmaj ko katha pehle hi se gyaat he
 With this he does not know any difficulty, otherwise the first part of the story will be clear to an unknown person only once he recites the entire poem
 iliyat ke bare main duusari baat yah dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki uskaa vishay jaisaa ki mangalacharan se spasht he, ekiles ke krodh kaa gaan he
 Where this anger ends after its peak
 usase kuch aage tak, arthath is krodh ke pratyaksh fal petraclus kii mrityu evam apratyaksh fal hectares kii mrityu tak, chalakar katha samaapt ho jaati he par ekiles kii mrityu, try kaa dhwans aadi is mahakavy main nahin aate hai
 Homer keeps 'too The Point' very strictly on the theme declared in his epic - not a little bit
 is ghor sanyam kaa hi parinaam he katha-yaa ‘vishay kii ekta’ 
 Each event is seated within the entire design with tightly related associations
 bhartiya mahakavyon main isi ekta evam sangati kaa abhaav he evam sara dhaanchaa dhili-dhaali katha vyavastha se purna he
 The subject of Valmiki's Ramayana is Polastyavadh, but the events involved in it are connected with very loose sources
 mahabharat main to yah ‘ekta’ bilkul nahin - vah to vishwakosh kii style main likhaa gaya he
 In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, it is definitely like 'jatiili Ekta' and 'associative consistency' like Homer
 jahaan tak vishay kii ekta evam prabhavanviti kaa prashn he tulsidas kii samta koi bhi bhartiya kavi, chaahe vah kalidas hi kyon na ho, nahin kar saktaa
 This thing is being written here in Abhidhartha
 homer ekiles ke krodh evam uske vikaas kaa pratifal evam varnan 9 sargon main karata he or katha ko uske pratyaksh, apratyaksh falon tak le jaakar samaapt karata he
 If he had been tempted to narrate further events, till the death of the Achilles and the ruin, then there would not have been a strong structural unity in poetry
 dhaanchaa dhilaa ho jaataa
 Aristotle praised Homer's genius in those chapters of 'poetics' and taught Homer to emulate his ideal, where he discusses the 'three Unities' and influences
 greek sahitya main dhaanchaa par bahut hi adhik jor diya gaya he
 This form is evident in the geometric consistency of the law, their sculpture, theatrical etc
 unhone chand ko bhavanubhuti evam alankaar se kam mahatva nahin diya
 This trend is not only present in Homer, but in Homer itself
 elliod main sara ‘acshan’ vrittakar he
 Where it starts, it comes and ends there
 jin sanskaron ne greek tragedy ko dhaanchaa evam bhavbhumi pradaan kii, ve sanskaar greekon kii jaateey nidhi hai or ve hi homer kii pratibha main bhi praan sthaapan karte hai
 From this there is a structural and emotional similarity in the tragedy literature of Homer and Kalantar
 greek tragedy ke dhaanche kaa sanyaman teen tatva - ‘ek desh’, ‘ek kaal’, evam ‘ek vyapaar yaa vishay’-karte hai
 In the Iliad, the 'country' is the same, that is, the whole event takes place on the palaces of Troy and the beach in front
 ‘kaal’ bhi ek hi he, kyonki mahakavy kaa ghatnasutra lagaataar 50 din kii avadhi kaa he
 That is, a continuous unbroken form of 'kaal' is given - by holding the last 50 days of the 10th year
 kavyavrutt ko 10 varshon kii sataha par na failaakar vah 50 dinon ke andar hi samet letaa he
 The trade or subject is also the same - the anger of Echiles, its mitigation and its fruit in the form of epilogue
 bas, yaheen mahakavy samaapt ho jaataa he
 The subject of Odyssey is broad
 mahakavy kaa nayak odesius try yuddh ke baad 10 varsh tak bhatakta rahaa
 This epic also begins with the last part of this decade
 dhaanchaa thik elliod jaisaa he
 In the 50-day event of the Iliad, the present is the predominance - the purpose of the poet is to describe what happened in those 50 days
 purv kii ghatnaayen raah chalati charchaa-si kahin-kahin aa jaati hai
 But this is not the case in Odessa
 odesi kaa vishay hi he ‘odesius kaa dukhamay bhraman’
 Therefore, this is the aim of this 10-year tour
 vah elliod kii tarah hi dashak ke antim chor par prarambh hota he avashya, parantu uskaa uddeshy ‘vartmaan’ se adhik ‘ateet’ se sambandhit he
 Homer therefore uses flashback-technics of modern films
 mahakavy kaa armbh hota he 10wein varsh main, jab odesius apsara kelipso ke dweep se yatra shuru karata he or uskaa bhagn pot dub jaataa he evam vah nasika ke desh main bahakar lag jaataa he
 The king of there narrates the Ram story of his 9 years in canto from 9 to 12
 ‘purv-smriti’ takanic isi 9wein se 12wein sargon main he
 But even in the womb of this former memory, there is the 'antecedent memory' in the 11th canto, when he narrates the balance of the story of the war of triumphs to Aciles
 odesi kaa kaal sanghathan bada hi pechida he
 In the womb of 'present', 'east' and in the womb of that East lies 'ante'
 samooche kaal-bandh ko ‘mukul-patr-bandh’ kii sangya di ja sakati he
 In the bud, there is a second layer inside a layer of petals, a third layer lies inside the second
 usee bhanti odesi kaa kaal-bandh he
 This time-bound duality becomes complicated because the 'country' of Odyssey is not one
 odesi kaa vishay he, ‘bhayankar samudr-bhraman evam guhaagaman’
 Hence, the centers of trade become two
 ek to he ithaika jahaan uski rani pinilopi uski pratiksha main baithi he or uske putr-kaltr uske shatruon se ghire hai
 The second is Odessa's own and its floating position on the sea surface
 in do ‘deshon’ ke ghatnaon sanchaalan hota he mahaan sutaradhar zeeyas dwaara
 Even if there is no 'unity of the country', the unity of the subject or business exists in the same truncated way as in the 'iliad'
 kavi badi saavdhaanee se ek ghatana kii parat main duusari ghatana rakhkar samooche vyapaar kii sangati evam sudaulata kii raksha badi dhirta se karata he
 The content of the Iliad is limited
 isi se tragedy kaa pattern baith gaya
 Unity of work-effect was achieved very easily
 parantu ‘odesi’ kaa vishay vistrut he
 It is like a novel
 phir bhi itani saavdhaanee se kaary evam prabhaav kii ekta sampadit kii gayi he ki aaj ke style-pradhan yaa rup-pradhan upanyaas bhi uske saamne fike pad jate hai
 For a beginning poet - for a beginner, such a great workmanship is a matter of surprise
 sankshep main elliod kaa roopayan tragediparak he evam odesi kaa upanyasparak
 Despite this, Odyssey is parallel to the Iliad in many respects
 elliod or odesi donon kaavyon kaa armbh kathakaal kii antim chor pakadakar hota he
 The end of both is also on the subject declared in the beginning
 donon kii gati-rekha vrittakar he
 The number of cantos in both is 24
 elliod ke ant main hectares kaa nidhan he to odesi main paani-praarthi rajkumaron kaa
 At the end of the Iliad, a peaceful atmosphere, perfect for a period of time, is present in which both sides cremate the dead
 odesi main to ant main priyamilan evam sthaayee shaanti aa jaati he
 The characters in both the epics are known to be cast in the same scale and mold
 anthoni jis kutilata or tatparta se greek yoddhaon kii sahaayta elliod main karti he usee rup main odesi main bhi
 Poseidon is both a cruel and foolish deity
 odesius donon mahakavyon main saahsee, vir, krurkarma evam kutil rup main chitrit he
 Minilas is similarly rich, generous heart warrior in both epics
 budhimhan vruddh nestor kaa mitra bhi vahiin rahata he
 If the authors of these epics were different then there would have been a difference in the portrayal of the characters
 udhaaharan ke liye homer kaa ‘diomidil’ yaa ‘afroditi’ virgil ke diomedij yaa afroditi se bilkul alag hai
 The same pattern of plot and characters suggests that both poems are abandoned by the talent of the same person

 Dhanpur Gusai is a village in Nainital district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Ramnagar tehsil

 The year of 2566 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2566 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyug Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 There is 6 nivartakanupatti - According to Ramanuja, Maya considers the knowledge of a non-existent Vedanti Brahma who is nirguna, formless, to be the creator of Maya, According to Ramanuja, there can be no knowledge of the formless formless, according to Advaita Vedanta, this knowledge is the determinant of Maya, the knowledge of this Brahman is not based on the distinction of the knower-known, but it is unconstrained, the sensation is inflexible, it is attained by self-realization
 Knowledge is the best but not the subject of knowledge
 7 Nivrtyyanuppatti - According to Ramanuja, if Maya is a form of emotion, then it cannot be destroyed
 It cannot be overcome, according to Vedanta, Maya is a form of sentiment, saying it does not become satta
 Maya is different from satta
 Saying sentiment form means that it is not discrete

 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire

 This revolution changed the direction of modern history

 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations

 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"

 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy

 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy

 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble

 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family

 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory

 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful

 The state was burdened with debt

 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France

 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing

 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains

 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited

 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge

 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc

 The difference was only in form

 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution
 rajya or raajnneeti dharm se alag kiye gaye
 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it
 vahaan aise anek darshanik or lekhak paidaa hue jinhone apni lekhnee ke dwaara in kashton kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrishti karaayaa anya europee deshon kii badtar sthiti ke baavjud france main sarvapratham lui solvaan ke khilaaf kranti hui
 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states

 bhartiya film ke itihaas main yah pehali baar hua he, jab kisi film ke liye ek nai bhashaa kaa nirmaan kiya gaya ho
 Queen Shivagami of Mahishmati, one of the ancient kingdoms of India, comes out to adopt a baby from the den near a huge waterfall
 vah badi nidarta se apane peechha karte sipaahiyon ko maar daalati he or shishu kii raksha khatir swayan ke praan balidaan detii he
 At the last moment, the local villagers see the baby in the arm above the queen immersed in water and save the child safely
 is tarah rani parvat kii oonchaai se girte jalprapaat main dub kar villin hoti he
 Sanga and her husband name the baby Shiva and raise their children the same way
 guzarate samay ke saath shiva ek balavaan yuvak ke rup main bada hota he jisaki aakanksha parvat chadhane kii rahati he or kai baar kii vah naakaam praytn karata he
 Every day, he gets a mask of a young woman flowing in a waterfall
 us yuvati kii pahchaan dhundne kii chaah main, vah punah parvat chadhaai kaa prayaas karata he or aakhirkaar vah safal bhi hota he
 At the summit of the falls, Shiva discovers Avantika, the owner of the facade, a rebel warrior whose team is fighting a war against King Bhallal Deva / Pallavathevan of the Mahishmati Empire through guerrilla methods
 dal kaa lakshya he ki ve purv maharani devsena ko chhudaae jinhen rajmahal main gat 25 varshon se zajiron main jakad rakhaa he
 And this important responsibility has been assigned to Avantika
 avanatika ko shiva kii yah baat sun prem hota he ki vah is jalprapaat kii tamaam mushkilon par chadhaai karata hua sirf uske liye aayaa he
 Shiva now pledges to take the responsibility of this campaign and sneak into Mahishmati and free Devasena from captivity
 shiva use chhudaa laata he or saath lekar bhaag nikalataa he magar jald hi raja kaa shahi gulam kattappa, jinhen behtareen yudhkaushal ke liye janaa jaataa he, uske peeche padataa he
 But the ambush Bhadra, son of Bhallal Dev, suddenly strikes Shiva's head, but Katappa drops his weapon when he comes to know that Shiva is actually Mahendra Bahubali, son of the late King Amarendra Bahubali
 phir yahaan bhootkaal main hue raja amrendra bahubali kii vigat ghatnaon kaa ullekh hota he
 Amarendra's mother dies after his birth, while the father passed away long before that
 shivagaamee apane angrakshak katappa ke sahyog se nae raja chune tak samrajya ke shashan kii bagdor sambhalati he
 She raises Amarendra Bahubali and Bhallal Dev equally; she is well-versed in many disciplines and training such as art, science, trickery, politics and martial arts, but both have different ambitions for the rule of the empire
 
 jahaan amrendra bahubali kaa logon ke prati udaaravaadi vyavhaar karte he to bhallaal dev behad kathor hai or apane lakshya prapti ke liye har sambhav nishthurataa baratata he, yahaan tak ki vah bahubali kii hatya bhi kara dete he
 When Mahishmati is challenged to battle by the enemy Kalakeyas, Sivagami vows that whoever beheads the king of the Kalakayas will be made the new king and thus orders for equal sharing of war between the two grandchildren
 is
 lekin bhallaal dev ke apahiz pita, bijjala dev, chal-prapanch dwaara bhallaal ko adhik se adhik yuddh saadhan muhaiyaa karaata he
 In the battle when Mahishmati fails once and realizes his end, Amarendra re-motivates his soldiers to fight against him from the dead and ends the war by crushing the enemies
 magar bhallaal dev pehle hi kalaakeya ke raja kaa vadh kar detaa he, shivagaamee bataur naye shaasha ke rup main amrendra bahubali kaa chayan uske yuddh main shreshthata or netritvta ke faisle par ghoshnaa karti he to bhallaal dev ko uske saahas or parakram ke liye senanayake banaati he
 After these earlier incidents, when questioned about King Amarendra, the emotional Katappa speaks of the death of the king, and Katappa holds himself responsible for his death

 teen feji vidyut shakti yaa trikla vidyut shakti vartmaan samay main prayavarti dhara ke utpaadan, sanchaaran tathaa vitaran evam upyog kii sabase lokapriy vidhi he
 It is a type of multiphase system
 teen feji shakti ke anek laabh hai
 It was first practiced and patented by Nicola Tesla in 1887–1888
 teen phej pranali main teen taar main na hokar paraspar 120 degree kalantar par hoti hai
 These three are the same frequency
 kalantar se matlab yah he ki ye dharaaen alag-alag samay par apane adhiktam maan vaale bindu par hoti hai, ek hi samay par nahin
 That is, if the maximum point of the first current comes at 0 time, the second at t / 3 and the third at 2T / 3 time; Where is the period of alternating current
 teen feji pranali main ek chauthaa taar bhi ho saktaa he jise neutral taar kehete hai
 All the above properties are also possible in all systems with 3, 6, 9, 12 phase of which the three phase is the simplest
 adhikansh gharelu lod ekreeji hote hai 
 In most countries, three phased powers do not enter homes, but only one phase and neutral come in homes
 teen phejon ke liye praayah teen alag-alag rangon ke taron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Lala, yellow and blue are the symbols of these three phases in India
 neutral ko kaale rang se tathaa arth ko halake hare rang ke taar se liya jaataa he
 The three phases of an amount with three phases can be represented in the following form: yadi G1 = G2 = G3 to pranali ko 'santulit' kaha jataa he, anyathaa 'asantulit' 
 The following three-phase system consists of the art-sequence v 1 { \ displaystyle v_ {1}}, v 2 { \ displaystyle v_ {2}}, v 3 { \ displaystyle v_ {3}}, v 1 { \ displaystyle v_ {1 }}, 


, is

 Changing the art sequence for some type of three fuzzy loads can cause a huge mess
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi 3-feji preran motor main phej-anukram badal diya jaay to vah pehle kii tulana main ulti disha main ghoomane lagegi
 It is important to change only one of the two phases to change the art sequence
 isi prakaar, teen phej se judaa koi power conwarter jisamen SCR laga ho bhi galat kaam kar saktaa he yaa kharaab ho saktaa he, yadi usko di jane vaali teen-feji vidyut kaa kala-anukram badal diya jaay
 But if the electronics of that power converter are intelligent, then even if the sequence of the art is changed, it will work properly and there will be no problem

 ravan ramayana kaa ek pramukh praticharitra he
 Ravana was the king of Lanka
 vah apane das siron ke kaaran bhi janaa jaataa tha, jiske kaaran uskaa naam dashanan bhi tha
 For any work, it is necessary to have a strong villain along with the hero
 ramakatha main ravan aisa paatr he, jo ram ke ujjwal charitra ko ubhaarne kaa kaam karata he
 According to some belief, Ravana also had many qualities
 saraswat brahman pulasthya rishi kaa pautra or vishrava kaa putr ravan ek param shiv bhakt, udbhat raajnneetijna, mahaparakramee yoddha, atyant balashaali, shastron kaa prakhar gyaata ,prakand vidwaan pandit evam mahagyani tha
 During the reign of Ravana, the splendor of Lanka was at its peak and he had made his palace a completely golden king, so his Lankanagari is also called the city of gold or the city of gold
 padmapurana, shrimadbhagwat puraana, kurmpurana, ramayana, mahabharat, anand ramayana, dashavatharcharit aadi granthon main ravan kaa ullekh hua he
 Different texts are mentioned in different texts about the rise of Ravana
 valmiki dwaara likhit ramayana mahakavy ke anusaar ravan lankapuri kaa sabase shaktishaalee raja tha
 Who was Ravan? Dev and the demons are half-brothers among themselves and are constantly quarreling
 Maharishi Kashyap's wife Aditi was born to Dev and Diti was born as a monster
 As a result of Diti's wrong teachings and in the race to further her offspring from Aditi's sons, the demons went in the wrong direction and became staunch enemies of the gods
 They fought for ages, sometimes the demons were sometimes heavy
 donon dev or daanav tapasya karte the, daan punya aadi shreshth karm karte the kabhi brahma ji se to kabhi mahadev se var praapt karte the or phir ek hi kaam ek duusare ko nicha dikhaanaa
 nirantar ladai jhagade se devtaa dukhi ho gayi tab devataaon ne brahma ji se prarthana kii, ki wo kuch karen
 brahma ji ne devataaon ko sagar manthan kii baat kah or usase amrit praapt hone kii baat batalaai jise devtaa pi len, to wo daanvon ke haath mrityu ko praapt nahin honge or yah saath main yah bhi kaha ki sagar manthan aasaan nahin he usamen daanvon ko bhi shaamil karo or yukti purvak amrit ko praapt karo daanvon ko sammilit karne ke kaaran hai ek to itnaa bada kaam akele or gupt tareeke se kar nahin sakoge, kyunki daanvon ko pataa chal jayega doosraa isamen shram bahut lagegaa
 brahma ji kii baat par tab yukti purvak devataaon ne daanvon ko sagar manthan milakar karne kii baat ke liye raji kiya or daanvon ko sagar se bahut se ratna nikalne kii baat kahi, lekin amrit kii baat nahin batalaai
 daanav sahamat ho gayi or phir unhone kaha bhai pehle hi is baat ko tay kar lo ki pehla ratna niklaa to koun legaa doosraa kiskaa hoga, taaki baad main vaad vivaad na ho
 devtaa thode ghabaraaye ki, kahin pehali baar main amrit nikal gaya or daanvon ke haath laga gaya to? lekin phir bhagwaan ko man hi man namaskara kar unhone vishwaas kiya ki bhagwaan unka kalyaan avashya karange or tay ho gaya ki pehla ratna nikalegaa wo daanvon ko doosraa devataaon ko or phir isi prakaar se kram chalata rahegaa
 manthan ke liye rassi kaa kaam karne ke liye devataaon ne sarpon ke raja vasuki se prarthana kii or use bhi ratnon main bhaag dene kii baat kahi gai, vasuki nahin mana, usne kaha ki ratna lekar wo kya karegaa? phir devataaon ne alag se use samajhaayaa or amrit main hissaa dene ki baat kahi tab wo taiyaar hua
 sumeru parvat se prarthana kii gai usko ko mathni banane ke liye manaaya gaya
 sab taiyaari purna hone ke baad tay kiye maapdandon par niyat din main sagar manthan hua, lekin jaise hi madaranchal parvat ko samudr main ootara gaya wo apane bhaar ke bal se sidhaa sagar kii gaharaaiyon main dub gaya or apana ghamand pradarshit kiya, tab asuron main banasur itnaa shaktishaalee tha, usne madaranchal parvat ko akele hi apni ek hajaar bhujaaon main uthaa liya or sagar se baahar le aayaa or madaranchal kaa abhimaan nasht ho gaya
 dev or daanvon ke prakram se khush ho or brahma ji kii prarthana par, bhagwaan shri narayan ne kachhp avatar liya or parvat ko apni peeth par rakhaa
 sagar manthan shuru hua sagar manthan or dev daanvon kaa prakram dekhne swayan brahma, vishnu, mahesh, sapt rishi, aadi apane-apane sthaan par baith gaye
 sagar manthan shuru hone ke bahut dinon ke baad sabase pehle halaahal vish niklaa, jiske jehar se dev daanav or teenon lokon ke praani, vanaspati aadi moorchhit hone lage tab devataaon ne bhagwaan se prarthana kii or shri vishnu ne kaha isse rudra hi bachaa sakate hai
 tab bhagwaan rudra ne wo jehar pi liya lekin gale se neeche nahin utarne diya
 halaahal vish se unka kanth nila ho gaya or uske baad se hi ve devadhidev mahadev kehalaae or galaa nila pads jane ke kaaran nilkanth naam se jane or puuje gayi
 pun: manthan shuru hua, bhagwaan shankar ke mastak par vish ke prabhaav se garmi hone lagi tab manthan ke samay hi chandramaa ne apane ek ansh se sagar main pravesh kiya or saath main sheetaltaa liye hue bal rup main prakat hua or mahadev kii seva main upastith hua
 bhagwaan shiv uske is bhakthi par bhav par bahut khus huye or use hameshaa ke liye apane mastak par bal chandra ke rup main sheetaltaa pradaan karne ke liye sushobhit kar diya
 phir ratna rup main kamdhenu gaay nikali or daanvon ke bhaag kii thi, jise unhone bina gun bichaare sochaa ki gaay kaa ham kya karange or us gaay ko saptrushiyon ko daan main de diya ab baari thi devataaon kii lekin ratna main prakat hui mahalakshmi
 devataaon or daanvon ne unki stuti kii or sagar ne apane ek ansh se prukat hokar mahalakshmi ji ko bhagwaan vishnu ko kanyadan kiya or wo shri vishnu ke vam bhaag main virajman ho gai
 phir airavat hathi devataaon ke bhaag main aayaa iske baad kaustubh mani or anya ratna nikle
 or jab daanvon ke bhaag main uccheshrava naamak ghoda aayaa jo veda mantron se bhagwaan kii stuti karne laga tab daanvon ne abhimaan purvak devataaon ko de diya bole rakh lo, veda bolne vaala tumhaare hi kaam aayega hamen isaki zarurat nahin he
 phir madiraa nikali wo daanvon ke bhaag kii thi or wo use paa ke or pi ke wo bahut prasann ho gayi
 daanav madiraa paan se bahut aanandit ho gayi the or jab nasha thoda kam hua to pun: manthan shuru kiya iske baad devataaon kii baari thi or amrit kalash ke saath bhagwaan ke anshavatar shri dhanvantari avatarit hue
 lekin daanvon ko laga shaayad isamen bhi madiraa ho to wo balpurvak us kalash ko lene kii koshis karne lage
 badhate jhagade ko nipataane ke liye shri narayan ne pun: samudr se hi mohini rup main anshavatar liya
 sabhi dev or daanvon ne mohini ko ratnarupi devi jaanakar pranaam kiya tab mohini ne kaha ki, aap log jhagada kyun kar rahe hai? or jab kaaran janaa to usne kaha ki aap logon dwaara hi tay niyamanusaar yah kalash to vaise devataaon ko milanaa chaiye, lekin phir bhi yadi tum chaaho to main aap sabhi main kalash ke dravya ko baant kar aapkaa vivaad samaapt kar detii hoon, devtaa samaj gayi ki bhagwaan hai or unki sahaayta ke liye aae hai at: sabane mohini ke mithe vachanon ko maan liya
 mohini ne sabhi ko kaha ki wo pankti main baith jaaen, tab dev daanvon ko alag pankti main baitaakar kalash ke dravya ko jo amrit tha par daanav use madiraa samaj rahe the
 mohini ne kaha devataaon kii pankti se armbh karongi, cunki aap log ek baar dravya kaa paan kar hi chuke ho or yah kah kar devataaon ko baantna shuru kiya
 daanvon main ek ko nasha kuch kam sa ho gaya to wo phir se madiraa pine kii chahat main chupake se devataaon kii pankti main antim sthaan par baith gaya or use bhi amrit mil gaya
 surya or chandramaa ne is baat kii shikaayat bhagwaan vishnu se kar di tab unhonen us daanav par chhal karne kaa dand dene ke liye chakra se prahaar kar diya or us daanav kaa sar katate hi bhagadad much gai lekin wo daanav amrit paan ke baad bhi jivit rahaa
 What happened to all the demons? Why it happened How did it happen? The chariot of Shri Hari was to tell the demons that this demon had cheated drunkenly by deceit, when the siren was distributing, he should have patience, and after drinking the nectar, the gods have become more powerful than the demons
 : Now, do not quarrel with the gods due to demon envy
 The demon who changed the way to drink Amrit was wrong because on the basis of the set standards, the nectar was right on the nectar, but even then Mohini was distributing the nectar to everyone from one side of the line
 The demons now came to know that there is no alcohol in the urn but there is nectar, then some demon came forward in an attempt to snatch the urn from the siren Mohini, giving the remaining nectar urn to Devraj Indra and said that you people should settle among themselves
 Here, the demon who drank the nectar was living under the name of Rahu and Khadu Ketu and later he was revered as the shadow planet
 amrit prapti ke baad varshon tak devataaon kaa palada baari rahaa or wo daanvon par baari pads gayi
 is bich devataaon ne pun: tapabal se shakti arjeet kii tab daanav pareshaan ho gayi or unhone apane guru se poocha ki, guruvar ham kaise devataaon ko haraa sakate he tab unke guru ne kaha devtaa amrit paan kar chuke hai unhen haraana bahut kathin he, or ek hi upaay he agar shreshth brahman kaa tejasvi putr aapako sahaayta kare to devataaon ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 oopaay jaan kar daanvon ne sochaa brahman putr bhala hamaara kaam kyun karegaa, uske liye hamaara saath dena uskaa adharm hoga or is kaary ke liye koi bhi tejasvi to kya prithvi lok kaa saadhaaran brahman bhi taiyaar nahin hoga
 agar ham balpurvak kuch karange to shreshth or tejasvi brahman hamaara hi vinaash kar daalega or kamjor brahman ke paas ham gayi to, devtaa bhi hansee karange or hamaari keerti ko bhi dhabba lagegaa
 manthan or chintan ke daur shuru hue daanvon ke or ve sab ek nirnay par pahunche ki agar ham apni kanya kaa daan kisi shreshth brahman ko den to, brahman ko avashya sweekaar karnaa hi padega kyunki brahman shreshth maryaada kaa paalan karne ko baadhya he uskaa putr hoga, wo hamaara bhaanja hoga or brahman bhi, use ham paalange kshiksha deeksha denge, hamaare anusaar chalegaa or jab marji devataaon se bhida denge
 tab ek daanav bolaa kanya daan vaali baat thik he par daan kaise doge? ye reeti to ham daanvon kii he nahin, brahman kanyadan kaise or kyun sweekaar karegaa
 devataaon vaale rivaaj ham kar nahin sakate, kyunki wo hamaare anukul nahin rahe hai
 anya daanvon ne kaha baat to sahi he or nirnay ko soch samaj kar ke lene ke liye meating ko duusare din tak ke liye taal diya
 raat ko ek daanav apane ghar main bahut pareshaan or udhedbun main tha ki is baat kaa hal kaise diya jaae
 wo apane parivaar main baitha tha uski patni or putree ne chintaa kaa kaaran poocha, tab usne unako baat batalaai
 uski putree kaa naam tha keshini usne kaha pita ji daanav kanya kaa vivaah shreshth brahman ke saath isaki aap chintaa naa karen, main shreshth brahman vishrava ko jaanati hoon jo aryaavrut pradesh ke paas ke jangal main hi apane shishyon ke saath ashram main rahete hai
 ve apane shishyon ko bahut sayanm or shanti ke saath adhyayan karaate hai, maine unako dekha he unka gyaan bhi bahut shreshth he, aisa mujhe lagata he kyunki main kai baar chup chup ke unako sun chuki hoon
 agar pitaaji aapaki aagyaan ho to main unke paas jaaongi or unase prarthana karuungi ki wo mujhe apni patni ke rup main sweekaar karen
 mujhe purna vishwaas he ve mujhe avashya apanaayenge, main unke swabhaav se parichit hoon
 putree keshini kii baat sun, uske mata pita bahut prasann hue, pita ne apni putree ko kaha ki putree tu is daanav kul kii raksha or bhalaai ke liye sochaa, tu bhaagyashaalee or dhanya he, kal main sabhi se is bare main charchaa karunga or tab tumhen apana nirnay dungaa
 duusare din keshini ke pita ne anya sabhi daanvon ko apni putree keshini dwaara diya gaya suzav batalaaya or sabhi bahut khush hue keshini ko aagyaan de di gai
 keshini apane kaary main safal rahi
 shaktishaalee daanav kii putree hone ke baad bhi usne namrata purvak apane mata pita kii chintaa dur karne kaa prayaas kiya or brahma ji ke maanas putr, maharishi pulasthya ke putr vishrava ne unhen apni patni ke rup main ashram main sweekaar kar liya
 ek acchhee patni ke rup main keshini apane pati kii kai varshon tak bahut seva kii or ek din uske pati rishi vishrava ne prasann ho kar keshini se var maangane ko kaha
 keshini ne adbhut or tejasvi putron kii maan hone kaa vardaan maanga, jo devataaon ko bhi parajeet karne kii takat rakhata ho
 keshini ne ek putree, patni or maan ke rup me apni maryaada kaa paalan karne main purnrup se safal rahi
 apane mata pita kii chintaa ko dur hi nahin kiya apitu uske baad pati seva kaa tap bhi kiya samay aane par usne ek adbhut balak ko janm diya jo das sir or bees haathon vaala atyant tejasvi or bahut sundar balak tha
 Keshini asked the sage, he has been born with so much hands and head, the sage said that you had asked for a wonderful son, so wonderful, that no one else is like this, exactly the same son has been born
 On the eleventh day, his father performed the wonderful boy's Namakarna rite and named it Ravana
 Ravana grew up in his father's ashram and later became his two brothers Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan and a very beautiful sister Surpanakha
 Sayong of Ravan's birth was made in this way
 purvakaal kii baat he vaikunth lok main jai-vijay naamak do dwarpal the
 ek baar unhone shaunkadi balak rishiyon ko vaikunth main jane se roak diya tha, unhen laga ki baalkon ko bhala bhagwaan ke paas kya kaam he
 tab shaunkadi rishiyon main se ek balak rishi ne jai vijay ko shraap de diya ki tum donon ne vaikunth lok main mrityulok jaisaa niyam kaa paalan kiya or swayan shri hari ke dwaar par seva main rahete huye itnaa gyaan bhi nahin he at: tum mrityulok ko praapt ho jaaoge
 dusre balak rishi ne kaha tumhen is baat kaa bhaan bhi nahin ki shri vishnu lok main yah parampara nahin ho sakati
 isi bich aawaaj sun kar swayan bhagwaan vishnu un shaunkadi rishiyon ko lene aa gayi
 unhone tathaa jai-vijay ne rishiyon se kshamaa maangi
 is par rishiyon ne kaha ki shraap waapas nahin ho saktaa, samay aane par tumhen mrityulok janaa hi hoga, par jaise swayan shri hari hamen lene aaye he vaise hi wo tumhen bhi waapas vaikunth lok laane ke liye mrityulok main aayenge
 dusraa kaaran yah tha ki ek baar naradji ko apni bhakthi par abhimaan aa gaya or wo har lok main ja ja ke apni bhakthi or tapasya kaa bakhaan karte the
 naarad ne apane pita brahmadev ko batalaaya tab unhone kaha ne naarad apni bhakthi kaa bakhaan mat karnaa yah acha nahin he
 naarad kailash main gayi or vahaan bholenath ko bataaya unhone bhi kaha naarad aap har jagah is baat ko kah rahe ho acha nahin he
 lekin naarad abhimaan main the ki samast lokon main un jaisaa koi narayan bhakt nahin he
 kailash se lautate huye naarad vaikunth kii ore chale tab naarad ke abhimaan ko nasht karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne ek maaya nagari kaa nirmaan kiya
 naarad jahaan se nikle tab maarg main unhen ek sundar nagar dikhaai diya
 naarad ne sochaa main sabhi lokon or nagar main gaya hoon par yah is nagar main nahin gaya at: yahan ja ke dekhtaa hoon koun sa nagar he
 naarad vahaan pahunche, bahut sundar nagar tha indrlok se bhi sundar vahaan ke raja ne naradji kaa sammaan kiya, mahal main baithaaya or swayan sapariwaar naarad ji ko namaskara kiya
 jalpan aadi ke baad kaha, maharishi aap to chirinjivi, trikaaldarshee mahatma hai meri putree kaa swayanvar do dinon ke baad rakhaa he vaise to maine samast teenon lokon main khulaa aamantran diya he ki jise bhi meri putree chaahegi usee se vivaah kiya jaayegaa parantu yadi aap mujhe bataa den ki damaad kaisaa hoga to mujhe aatm santosh ho jaayegaa
 naarad ji ne unki putree ke hastrekha dekh kar kaha ki aapaki putree bahut bhaagyashaalee he, ise chirinjivi, ajar amar, sundar or shatoguni pradhan var milegaa
 jisaki keerti samast lokon main ho or naarad ji us kanya ke rup ko dekh kar mohit ho gayi unhen apane aap main bhi wo sab gun najar aaye jo uski hastrekha bataa rahi thi
 iske baad naarad ji ne bidaa lee or vaikunth lok ko apni bhakthi kaa bakhaan karne nikal padhe
 raste main vichaar kiya kii mujh me saare gun he lekin main sanyasi hoon
 ab mujhe bhi saptarishiyon kii tarah apni grahasthi basaa leni chaiye
 vivaah ke liye abhi jis kanya ko dekha wo upyukt he
 lekin ek kami he wo he meraa rup par uski chintaa kii koi baat nahin kyunki main bhagwaan kaa bhakt hoon or abhi ja ke bhagwaan vishnu se unka rup maang lunga or unhen apane bhakt ko dena hi padega
 naarad thode samay baad vaikunth pahunche bhagwaan ne swaagat kiya poocha bahut jaldi main ho kya baat he
 naarad ne kaha bhagwan ese hi bahut din ho gayi aap se mili huye, bhagwaan bholenath se milakar aa rahaa hoon or ab aap se milane chalaa aayaa
 ab vaise bhi mere paas samay he kyunki tapasya or bhakthi maarg kii ucch avasthaa bhi praapt kar lee he, gyankand, karmkand or bhakthi main bhi ab main charam seemaa par pahunch chukaa hoon
 maaya ko bhi jeet chukaa hoon ab soch rahaa hoon main bhi grahasthi ban jaaon
 raste main ek kanya ko dekh kar aa rahaa hoon jo sabhi gunon se yukt he aapse kya kahun bhagwan aap to sarvajna hai or main to aapkaa sab se bada bhakt bhi hoon at: aap meri sahaayta kijiye
 bhagwaan ne muskuraate huye kaha naarad tum grahastha banane kii chaah main lagata he kanya ke sundar rup par rogagrastha ho gayi ho at: main avashya tumhaare is rog ko dur kar dunga tum chintaa mat karo
 tum mere sabase bade bhakt ho to mujhe bhi ek chikitsak kii tarah se hi apane bhakt ke rog ko dur karnaa hoga
 naarad bhagwaan ke in vaakyon ko nahin samaj paye or bole prabhu meraa rog dur karne kaa upaay he aap mujhe apana hi rup de dijiye taaki main sundarataa main bilkul aap jaisaa hi dikhu taaki wo kanya mujhe varan kar le
 bhagwaan ne kaha naarad main tumhaara chikitsak hoon isaliye main rog ko thik karunga tum chintaa mat karo
 naarad ne kaha prabhu mujhe aagyaan dijiye ab main chalata hoon
 naarad ji khush the kii ab wo bhi bhagwaan vishnu jaise hi ho gayi hai or swayamvar ke din pahunche
 vahaan teenon lok se bahutse log aaye the, raja ne sabhi ko baithne ko asana diye
 naarad ji ne anumaan lagaaya pichhali baar raja ne mujhe maharishi kah kar charan dhoye par, aaj sirf saamaanya tareeke se pranaam karke asana diya, iskaa matlab bhagwaan ne mujhe apana rup de diya tabhi to ye raja aaj mujhe nahin pahchaan sakaa
 swayanvar armbh hua kanya apane liye var kaa chayan karne ke liye ek taraf se aage badhi or naarad ji ek do baar apni jagah se khadey huye kanya kaa dhyaan apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye or jaise hi wo paas se nikali to naarad ji apni gardan ko aage kii taraf jhukaa ke khadey ho gayi
 lekin kanya aage batch gai or ek anya divya purush ke gale main jayamala daal di
 kanya kaa vivaah unase sanmpann hua vivaah ke baad do shiv gana jo vahaan aaye the, wo naarad ji ko dekh kar bole aap kyun baar–baar uchhal rahe the
 naarad ko unki baat par bahut gussa aayaa or bole moorkho hans kyun rahe ho jaanate nahin main koun hoon? wo ye to pataa nahin koun ho par dekhne par lagate ekadam bandar ho, wo bandar jo mrityulok par paye jate hai
 naarad ne apana munh jal main dekha to vanar kaa sa munh kaa najar aayaa
 shiv gana phir bole kyun lag rahe ho naa mrityulok ke bandar or pun: jor se hansen to naarad ji ko or adhik krodh aa gaya or unhen shraap de diya ki tum donon shiv gana ho kailash main rahete ho or meraa uphaas karte ho, naarad kaa uphaas karke kehete ho mrityulok kaa bandar isaliye tumhen shraap detaa hoon tum mrityulok main jaaoge or wo bhi rakshas kul main, or phir bandar hi tumko peetenge
 iske baad naarad ji gusse se vaikunth lok kii ore teji se bade, unhen bhagwaan vishnu par bahut gussa aa rahaa tha
 On the way, the same girl and groom were also going after marriage
 As soon as Narada crossed the wedding procession, the groom asked, "where did Narada go?" Narada got angry with this question and said a little wait, Oh you are now i have recognized you
 You are Lord Vishnu
 i also told you about this girl with such a big game, i gave you information and you discussed the qualities of this girl and she cheated me, and changed my form and married another girl
 After this Narada ji cursed Shri Hari as well, i curse you as i am in the separation of the wife, you will also be unhappy with the disconnection of the wife, that too in the land of death because the real disconnection is there
 Will go and you will deviate from my wife just like i did
 God said Narada, cursed you, accept it and then removed my illusion, then Narada saw nothing, was that city, Neither that girl Narada said what happened? God said you had said that you have conquered Narada's illusion, that's why i was taking your test
 naarad ne shri hari se kshamaa maangi or bhagwaan vishnu adrishy ho gayi
 isi bich vahaan shiv gana bhi aaye or unhonen naarad ji se aparaadh kshamaa karne ko kaha
 naarad ne kaha shraap mithyaa to nahin hoga, at: rakshas to tum hooge hi lekin itnaa or kar detaa hoon ki tum itane prakramee rakshas hooge ki swayan bhagwaan shri hari hi tumhaare uddhaar ke liye aayenge
 Apart from this, the third yoga was Pratapbhanu who falls prey to the curse of Brahmins in greed to become the Chakravarti king, whose story will come forward, which is also related to the birth of Sitaji
 in teenon shraap se or in sabhi ke ansh ke rup main prakat hua ravan
 pratapbhanu kaa rajasi gun, shiv ganon kaa taamasi gun or jai–vijay kaa bhakthi kaa gun, in teenon vyaktiyon ke gunon kii pradhanta liye janm liya ravan ne
 balykaal main hi ravan ne chaaron veda par apni kushagra buddhi se pakad bana lee, use jyotishi kaa itnaa acha gyaan tha ki, uski ravan samhita aaj bhi jyotishi main shreshth maani jaati he
 yuvavastha main hi ravan tapasya karne nikal gaya use pataa tha ki brahma ji uske pardada hai, isaliye usne pehle unki ghor tapasya kii or kai varshon kii tapasya se prasann hoke brahma ji ne use vardaan maangane ko kaha, tab ravan ne ajar–amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 brahma ji ne kaha main ajar amar hone kaa vardaan nahin de saktaa hoon tum gyani ho isaliye samajhane kaa prayaas karo
 main tumhen wo nahin de saktaa hoon lekin badale main anya shaktiyaan detaa hoon
 ravan tapasya se shakti praapt karke aayaa mata-pita se mila ve bahut prasann hue
 ab thoda abhimaan man main aa gaya or ek din, do chaar saathiyon ko leki ravan apni yuvavastha main sahastrabahu arjuna ke rajya kii seemaa main gaya, vahaan narmada nadi ke kinare usne dekha nadi kii chaudai bahut hone ke baad bhi usamen jal bahut kam tha
 Ravana said to his friends how the water of this river is so low, at first it used to be very full of water
 tab saathiyon ne thoda aage badhakar dekha ek band najar aayaa jisamen nadi kaa samast jal roka gaya tha or baandh ko baanon se banaaya tha
 Then the companions of Ravana told him that, by using his wonderful archery, someone has stopped the water by tying it with arrows
 They all went ahead and saw some soldiers engaged in armed security, Ravana asked who should be built and who built this dam
 Those people said that our Maharaj Sahastrabahu Arjun has come to visit this time with his wives
 Ravan said, well, now look at my skill and with one arrow he broke the dam
 Sahasrabahu's wife who went to bathe was swept away and after a lot of effort, she was evicted
 When Ravana broke the dam, his soldiers were informed about this by Sahasrabahu and then Sahasrabahu and Ravan got into a war and Ravana lost him, took him captive and put him in jail
 His companions ran away and Ravi's grandfather, Muni Pulastya, was told that he sent a message to Sahastrabahu Arjun that Ravana is a young man and there is a possibility of mistake in his youth, so leave him
 Arjun leaves him and warns again If there is no such mistake, then not a single head will be seen
 Ravana felt very guilty and meditated for Brahma Ji again for years
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 He meditated for Lord Brahma
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 He meditated for Lord Brahma
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 ravan use dekh kar hansaa or phir use chhedne laga i mercut, i bandar bol uskaa uphaas karne laga or yuddh karne ke liye uksaane laga
 ravan ko apni mayavi shakti par ghamand aa gaya tha wo baali se kaha are mercut maine suna he tu bahut shaktishaalee he aa jaraa mujhase yudd kar ke dekh tera abhimaan main kaise dhilaa karata hoon
 lekin baali dhyaan main tha isaliye usne isaki baat ko suna hi nahin
 iske baad ravan ne usko jor se laat maari or bolaa paakhandee mere lalkaarane ke baad mere dar se dhyaan main baitha he, sidhe-sidhe bol ki main nahin lad saktaa
 baali krodh se oobal pada usne ravan ko patake-patake kar itani maar maari bas wo sirf marane se hi bachaa or phir use apni punch main band kar lapet liya, pun: sandhya vandan samaapt karke usne ravan ke garv ko chur-chur kar diya
 chha: maheene tak baali ne use apni kaid main rakhaa ek din use apane baane haath se usko apni kaankh main dabaakar baali ja rahaa tha tabhi uske haath kii pakad dhili ho gayi or ravan bhaag niklaa aisa bhaaga kii dikhaai nahin diya
 ab ravan ko pataa chalaa ki usase bhi balashaali log hai mujhe hi pitamah kii vajah se abhimaan zyada tha
 After this, he again went out to do austerity and again he asked for a boon to be immortal
 Brahma ji said that son is not that boon in my possession and this time he got tremendous powers and Brahmastra from Brahma ji
 One day the gods got angry on anything and he climbed alone in heaven and he alone defeated all the gods in a fierce battle
 Indra, Yama, Varuna took all the other Decapals and Prajapatis hostage
 All the other gods escaped from heaven, he took over the heavenly world and later returned it to the gods, but the values of the gods were dissolved
 The demons came to know that Ravana, his nephew, defeated all the gods in heaven alone
 This was revealed in the three worlds and the demons became very happy with this, their desire for years was fulfilled and the demons cheered Ravana
 And prayed to Ravana to become his king
 Due to Ravana's sharpness and his grand appearance and leadership, the Maya demon was pleased that his extremely beautiful and dignified daughter Mandodari was married to Ravana and Mandavari as Ravana's wife was pleased with Pa
 Among Pativrata women, Mandodari is equivalent to Goddess Ahilya
 Ravana became revered by the demons as the king, then he thought of building a capital for himself, he went to heaven again
 Maybe it would be fine to build the capital, all the gods Indra, Yama, Varuna fled to see him, he felt lucky Happened but he did not like heaven, while returning, he saw a beautiful city on Mount Trikuta in the sea
 He went straight there and saw that his only half-brother Kuber lives with the Yakshas
 He asked Kubera to vacate the city with Yakshas
 Kubera went to his father and said, "father Ravan is forcibly evacuating Lanka," then he said, "son Ravan is not among those who believe at this time, so you give him that place
 No one will bother you On the orders of his father, Kubera built a city named Alkapuri in the Himalayan region near Mansarovar lake and went to Lanka with wealth from the Yakshas
 Here Ravana made Lanka very beautiful on Trikutaparvat
 His father-in-law, a demon named Maya, who was extremely proficient in mysticism, made Lanka the most beautiful city among the three worlds, with gold foil and diamond jewels, all the walls of Lanka from Mania, pillars, etc
 and when When the lack of feeling felt, Ravana took it away from Kubera
 Ravana instructed all the demons to stay in Lanka and gave everyone one beautiful house and palace, Then one day the Pushpak aircraft was also snatched from Kubera
 Raising the kingdom and setting up the beautiful capital, providing all the well-being facilities to all the Asuras and securing them completely, Ravana again got into the penance of Brahmadeva, seeing him later his brother Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan also joined him in penance Agye
 Brahma ji then came to Ravana, Ravana said, "father, i want a boon of immortality
" Brahmadev said that it is not possible for me to give it, but Ravana did not believe that Brahma ji went away
 Ravana continued to meditate again and after years of intense penance, Brahma again came to Ravana and explained to him that, do not ask for a boon of immortality, you are knowledgeable, i do not have the power to change the rules of the world, i am in dignity
 i have the power to work, son, you are doing my penance again and again and i am disturbed, so i give as much as possible today
 In your navel, i provide an Amrit Kund and as long as this Amrit Kund stays in your naabhi, you will not die
 If you are not satisfied on this and want to be immortal, then it is better you go to Mahadev's shelter
 i do not know of Mahadev or whether he will give the boon of being immortal or not, but he is not under my control
 Ravana then asked Brahma ji, how long will this nectar pool remain in the navel? Then Brahma Ji said that no one can dry this nectar tank except for the fire arrow, Ravan thought it was almost immortal, because no one other than Lord Vishnu can use the fire arrow, so he told the grandfather of Brahma
 Now you are not giving a boon to be immortal, so i accept it but you have to give more
 Brahma Ji said that apart from you being immortal, i am ready to give other demands, then Ravana asked for a boon so that he could be called Dev, Danuja, Nag, Yaksha, Kinnar, Gandharva could not kill anyone in a war
 Brahma ji said Aastastu
 At the same time, the sight of Brahma ji stood on an apsara who was hiding nearby and kept his ear listening to what a boon Brahmadev was giving to Ravana
 Brahma ji understood who sent who and that apsara bowed to Brahma ji, but it was not good to see him hiding in such a way, Brahma ji did not like it, he only told that nymph so much
 Have you heard so much that, on the day a loud punch of a monkey will hit your ear, on that day, understand that Ravana and the demons have come to an end
 Area was fleeing that Ravana are captured him and who are here Kyakr said? He told that Brahmadev had come to see just what he was saying
 Ravana understood that the gods had a trick, so he said to the nymph that you have a habit of listening too much, so now walk with me, now at the gate of Lanka, if someone enters there, then listen and guard and listen to the name Lankini Put it on the main gate for guarding
 Ravana had now reached almost the peak of his austerity power, so pride was also natural
 sabhi rakshas uski chhatra chaaya main surakshit the unamem se kai rakshas wo pehle devataaon ke bhay se tapasya nahin kar paa rahe the, wo tapasya karne lage shakti praapt karne ke liye or anya sabhi rakshas lanka main anand or eshwarya kaa bhoga karne lage
 One day Ravana, on the strength of his pride and majesty, went out alone to triumph in Trilok and went to Suthal Loka
 There, King Bali was in the palace palace in the lofty lord and Ravana went to his door with great pride and roar and said to the door pal, "speak the sacrifice, Ravan has come to battle" No one else in the guise of the gatekeeper, but Narayana himself, sacrificed
 Was given a boon, that he will give guard at his door
 When Ravana forcibly threatened Dwar Pal, the gatekeeper said, "O Lankapati Ravana, Maharaj Bali is in worship at this time and after the end of the puja he must fight with you, don't worry, be patient, he is a godly devotee, so first he We will complete that work, after that, they will come here to wear their armor in front of them, then we will give your message to them right here in front of you ”
 Ravana was proud and said, "ok, i will wear this armor, i will break it now
" "ravana stepped forward and tried to lift that armor, but it was so heavy that Ravana was sweating to lift it
 Lankapati Ravana, the gatekeeper sarcastically, your forehead has been sweating in lifting the armor of our Maharaj Bali, i am doubtful how you will be able to fight Maharaj Bali is a matter of time and you should be patient
 Ravana got scared in his mind and ran away after saying that he came after, did not come back
 Ravana defeated all the Gods, Yakshas, kinnars, Gandharvas, etc
 in the battle, and killed the demons, and he used to think before the humans that what he would fight was straightforward people, so his demons on other land parts of the earth were his Were driving
 Although the powerful kingdoms, which had other kings like Ayodhya, Mithila, Kaushal, were majestic and capable kingdoms of very high koti and never fought for border expansion, these kings Sanmargi and Narayana were devotees, His subjects were also happy and of high status
 Maharaja Dasharatha was so natural that even Devraj Indra had asked him for help in the war
 King Janaka was such a great king that he did not even care for his body in the work of the people, in the interests of the people and in the service of the saint and hence his name was also called Videha
 ek se badhakar ek rishi, maharishi, muni jinamein parashuram, viswamitra, bamdev jaise log in raajaaon ke darbar main aate the or isi vajah se inke rajya ko tedi aankh dekhne kaa saahas teenon lokon main swat: hi koi nahin kar sakaa
 a question arises that Ravana was killed by Sahastrabahu Arjuna, then by Bali, then fled to Sutle Lok for fear of sacrifice, Ayodhya, Mithila, Kaushal, the territories of apes etc
 were not under him, then how did Ravana assume the trio conqueror Gone? Ravana got nectar from Brahma ji in the navel pool, due to this, his death could not be from anyone other than Lord Narayana, he knew that, he was guilty in his mind that, if immortal, then how good would it be because his goal He was the same and he was trying for that
 lekin sirf amar rahane se koi baat nahin banati he bal, kaushal or shastr bhi chaiye uske liye usne tapasya se bahut kuch paaya bhi
 us vakt ravan jaise kai anya tapasvi bhi the, raja bali, vanar pradesh kaa raja baali, banasur aadi
 ravan ne brahma ji se vardaan paane ke baad sochaa ab wo amarta kaa vardaan paane ke liye mahadev ko hi prasann kar ke rahegaa or vardaan le ke rahegaa
 ravan ne bhagwaan bhole nath kii tapasya armbh kar di, varshon tak tapasya kii, bhole nath prakat nahin huye, ravan ne sochaa bholenath jaldi prasann hone vaale mahadev hai or mujhase hi lagata he aprasann hai ye soch kar usne or kathor tapasya karnaa shuru kar diya, kabhi niraahaar rah kar to kabhi bhagwaan bholenath kii sudanr stroton se veena vaadan kar, lekin prabhu prukat nahin hue
 ravan ne sochaa uskaa jivan hi bekaar he agar wo mahadev ko prasann na kar sakaa, mahadev jo sheeghra prasann ho jate hai apane bhakton par, or main hi unako prasann na kar sakaa ye soch kar aatmaglani se bhar gaya
 ek din wo puja main jab pushp chadhaane laga to pushp kam pads gayi, tab usne puja ko purna karne ke liye usne ek-ek kar apana mastak kaat kar pushp kii jagah chadhaana shuru kar diya, ye soch ke ki jo apane jivan main mahadev ko prasann nahin kar sakaa to us jeene vaale ko dhikkaar he
 aaj pushp kii jagah mahadev ko mere sheesh arpan hai
 dard se ravan besudh sa ho gaya lekin munh se har har mahadev kahana nahin chhoda
 antim sir se jhuk kar mahadev ko antim pranaam kar jaise hi khadg prahaar kiya apni gardan par mahadev ne prakat ho uskaa haath pakad liya, bole ravan mujhe bahut prasannataa hui, tumne mere liye apane praan sankat main daal diye, maango kya chaiye
 ravan dard ko sahataa hua mahadev ke charnon main pranaam karata hua, ati vinamr hoke bolaa “he devadhidev mahadev mujhe aapke darshan ho gayi, aap mujh se prasann hai mujhe ab or kuch nahin chaiye, main maangane kii ichha se hi tap kar rahaa tha, lekin aap ke is sundar swaroop ko dekhakar hi main dhanya ho gaya, aap prasann ho gayi mujhe is baat se purna santosh he prabhu or mujhe kuch nahin chaiye, aapane mujhe darshan de diye, mere liye isse bada vardaan kuch nahin, at: mujhe kuch nahin chaiye
 mahadev ne kaha ravan main to tumhaare sankalp se hi vardaan dene ke liye aayaa hoon at: aise to ja hi nahin saktaa hoon
 at: tum ni:sankoch hoke maango, tumhen jo chaiye tum maang lo
 ravan ne kaha “he mahadev, he devadhidev, he bhaktavatsal yadi aap dena hi chaahate hai, to mujhe aapaki atut bhakthi de dijiye or main hameshaa aapke “nam: shivaay” rupi mantra kaa jap karata rahon, iske atirikt mujhe kuch bhi nahin chaiye
 mahadev uski baat sun atyant prasann huye, jiskaa laksh tha amarta praapt karnaa or wo prabhu bhakthi maang rahaa he isse badhaa gyani or koun ho saktaa he
 tab mahadev ne use apni bhakthi pradaan kii or vardaan diya ki, tumhaare sheesh pun:aa jaaenge iske alaava jab bhi koi ang cat jayega us ke sthaan par pun: nayaa ang swat: hi ug aayega
 mahadev jaanate the ki ravan ko baali or anya logon se yuddh main haar jane kii glani man main he ki wo utna shaktishaalee nahin he isaliye mahadev ne bhakthi ke atirikt use bahut apaar bal de diya or saath main pashupat naamak astr diya
 mahadev se bal paakar jab vah jaise hi apane sthaan se ootha or waapas chalane ke liye kadam aage rakhaa to to prithvi dagamagaa gai or ravan bahut aanandit ho gaya or pun: mahadev ko man main pranaam kar wo laut ke lanka main aa gaya
 mahadev kaa ravan priy bhakt ban gaya, lanka se pratidin puspak vimaan se kailash jaataa tha or vahaan bhagwaan mahadev kii puja or aradhana karata tha
 When Ravana subjugated the nine planets running all the three worlds at his own pace, and with the Digpalas, he used water spillage in his Lanka paths, he was considered as the conqueror of the Trilok, because of the operation of the Trilok
 All the gods, the nine planets were under him and now there was no one in Trilok to defeat him
 He had captured most of the parts living in the three worlds
 ek baar naarad ji phir se lanka aaye, ravan ne unki bahut acchhee seva kii, naarad ji ne ravan ko kaha “suna he mahadev se bal paae ho ravan ne kaha haan aapaki baat sahi he
 naarad ne kaha kitna bal paae
 ravan ne kaha yah to nahin pataa parantu agar main chaahun to prithvi ko hilaa dula saktaa hoon
 naarad ne kaha tab to aapako us bal kii pariksha bhi leni chaiye kyunki vyakti ko apane bal kaa pataa to hona hi chaiye
 ravan ko naarad kii baat thik lagi or soch ke bolaa maharishi agar main mahadev ko kailash parvat sahit ootha ke lanka main hi le aata hoon ye kaisaa rahegaa? isse hi mujhe pataa chalaa jaayegaa ki mere andar kitna bal he
 naarad ji ne kaha idia bura to nahin he or uske baad chale gayi
 ek din ravan bhakthi or shakti ke bal par kailash samet mahadev ko lanka main le jane kaa prayaas kiya
 jaise hi usne kailash parvat ko apane haathon main oothaya to devi sati phisalane lagi, wo jor se boli tehro-tehro ! iske unhone mahadev se poocha ki bhagwan ye kailash kyun hill rahaa he mahadev ne bataaya ravan hamen lanka le jane kii koshis main he
 ravan ne jab mahadev samet kailash parvat ko apane haathon main oothaya to use bahut abhimaan bhi aa gaya ki agar wo mahadev sahit kailash parvat ko ootha saktaa he to ab uske liye koi anya asambhav bhi nahin or ravan jaise hi ek kadam aage rakhaa to uskaa balance dagamagaaya lekin iske baad bhi wo apni koshis main laga rahaa or itane main devi sati ek baar phir phisal gai unhen krodh aa gaya unhone ravan ko shraap de diya ki “are abhimaani ravan tu aaj se rakshason main gina jayega kyunki teri prakruti rakshason kii jaisi ho gai he or tu abhimaani ho gaya he
 ravan ne devi sati ke shabdon par phir bhi dhyaan nahin diya tab bhagwaan shiv ne apana bhaar badhaana shuru kiya or us bhaar se ravan ne kailash parvat ko dhire se usee jagah par rakhana shuru kiya or bhaar se uskaa ek haath dab gaya or wo dard se chillaaya uske chillane kii aawaaj swarg tak sunai di or wo kuch der tak moorchhit ho gaya or phir hosh aane par usne bhagwaan mahadev kii sundar stuti kii ”jatatvigaljjalapravahpavitasthale galevalamby lambitan bhujangtungmalikam


 bholenath ne stuti se prasann hoke usase kaha ki ravan yadhyapi main nrity tabhi karata hoon jab krodh main hota hoon, isaliye krodh main kiye nrity ko tandav nrity naam se sansar jaanata he
 kintu aaj tumne apni is sundar strot se or sundar gayan se meraa man prasannataa purvak nrity karne ko ho gaya
 ravan dwaara rachit or gaaya hua yah strot shiv tandav strot kahalaaya kyunki bhagwaan shiv kaa nrity tandav kehalaata he parantu vah krodh me hota he lekin is strot main bhagwaan prasannataa purvak nrity karte hai
 iske uparaant bhagwaan shiv ne ravan ko prasann hoke chandrahaas naamak talwaar di, jiske haath main rahane par use teen lok main koi yudd main nahin haraa saktaa tha
 devi sati ke shraap ke baad se hi ravan kii ginati rakshason main hone lagi or rakshason kii sangati to thi hi, isaliye rakshasi sangati main abhimaan, galat kaary or bhi badhate chale gayi, shraap ke pehle wo brahman tha or satvik tapasya karata tha
 brahmadev or mahadev kii puja kaa jal laane kaa kaary bhi devataaon ko diya tha
 lekin baad main wo satvik se taamasi pravartti main pads gaya abhimaan or asuron kii sangati in do kaarnon se ravan patan ko praapt hua
 ravan se zyada ravan ke naam kaa phayda oothaya duusare rakshason ne, uske naam par kar vasuuli, sidd, santon muni janon kaa apmaan hone laga
 rakshason ne devataaon se apana bair nikaalane ke liye, wo kabhi gaayon ko or brahmanon isaliye ki, swarg main bahut kam devtaa hi rah gayi he shaayad ye rup badal kar devtaa hi brahman hai or sant ban ke devataaon kii madad kar rahe hai rakshas jahaan tahaan sabhi ko traas dene or maarane lage
 According to the Ramayana, Ravana's father was Vishrava and the sage was the son of Pulatsya
 ravan kii mata kaikasi thi jo rakshas kul kii thi isliye ravan brahman pita or rakshasi mata kaa santan tha or ravan kai vidyaayein, veda, puraana, niti, darshanashastra, indrajaal aadi main paarangat hone ke baavjood bhi unki pravritiyaan rakshasi thi or puure sansar main aatank machaata tha
 The demons came to know that Ravana, his nephew, defeated all the gods in heaven alone
 This was revealed in the three worlds and the demons became very happy with this, their desire for years was fulfilled and the demons cheered Ravana
 And prayed to Ravana to become his king
 Due to Ravana's sharpness and his grand appearance and leadership, the Maya demon was pleased that his extremely beautiful and dignified daughter Mandodari was married to Ravana and Mandavari as Ravana's wife was pleased with Pa
 Mandodari is the equivalent of Goddess Ahilya among the patriotic women
 ek baar naarad ji phir se lanka aaye, ravan ne unki bahut acchhee seva kii, naarad ji ne ravan ko kaha “suna he mahadev se bal paae ho ravan ne kaha haan aapaki baat sahi he
 naarad ne kaha kitna bal paae
 ravan ne kaha yah to nahin pataa parantu agar main chaahun to prithvi ko hilaa dula saktaa hoon
 naarad ne kaha tab to aapako us bal kii pariksha bhi leni chaiye kyunki vyakti ko apane bal kaa pataa to hona hi chaiye
 ravan ko naarad kii baat thik lagi or soch ke bolaa maharishi agar main mahadev ko kailash parvat sahit ootha ke lanka main hi le aata hoon ye kaisaa rahegaa? isse hi mujhe pataa chalaa jaayegaa ki mere andar kitna bal he

 But Bali was in meditation, so he did not listen to it
 After this Ravana kicked him vigorously and said heresy is sitting in meditation with my fear after my defiance, speak directly that i cannot fight
 Bali was boiled with anger, he killed Ravana by beating him so much that he survived only by dying and then tied it in his tail and wrapped it again, ending Sandhya Vandan and he broke the pride of Ravana
 Six For months, Bali kept him in his captivity
 One day he was going to Bali by pressing him in his armpit with his left hand, then his hand got loose and Ravana ran away

 Unlike the grid, very low carbon intensity is used when charging vehicles with renewable energy
 
 An EV charged from the grid in the United States emits about 115 grams of CO2 per km while a conventional United States-available petrol-powered car emits 250 g / km / mi most of it from the tailpipe and the manufacture and distribution of some petrol Occurs in dijal athwa sankar kaaron ke saapeksh yah bachat aapattijanak he, parantu aise deshon main jahaan svachh vidyut kii aadharbhoot suvidhaayen behatar hai, yah bachat kahin adhik he
 In the worst case when the increasing demand for electricity will be met only by coal, as revealed by a 2009 study by WWF, World Wide Fund for Nature and IZES, a medium-sized electric vehicle is about 200 g
 / km / mi) emissions while 170 g / km / mi) from a petrol powered small car
 This study concluded that by introducing a million EV cars in Germany, the best scenario would be reducing CO2 emissions by 0

 Since the torque of an electric motor is a function of the available current, and not the rotational speed, electric vehicles provide far more torque than internal combustion engines
 chuki tork praapt karne main koi vilamb nahin hota, atah zyaadaatar electric vaahanon ke chaalak tork ko lekar adhik santusht hote hai
 For example, the Venturi Fetish drivers achieve supercar-like acceleration despite a modest power of 220 kw and have a top speed of around 160 km / h

 On the other hand, electric motors are efficient in converting accumulated energy into driving the vehicle, they do not dissipate when the electric vehicle is in steady state or standing, and the energy loss from applying the brakes is recaptured through reproducible braking
 With this done, up to a fifth of the energy lost by applying brakes can be recovered from such a system
