 The power coefficient is equal to the cosine of the difference between the voltage and current
 shakti gunak = p / s That is, in order to have good power coefficient it is necessary that the difference between voltage and current is very low
 jab dhara, voltata se peeche hoti he to ise laging power factor kehete hai; jab dhara, voltata se aage hoti he to ise 'leading power-factor' kaha jaataa he
 In industries, the power coefficient is often backward due to induction motors and other inductive loads
 kisi lod dwaara 1 se bahut kam shakti gunank par vidyut shakti lenaa acha nahin mana jaataa or adhiktar bijli aapurti karne vaali companiyaan iske liye kuch dand kaa praavdhaan rakhti hai
 The low power coefficient simply means that more current is being taken for work that can be done with less current than 'utility'

 The Pandavas had five brothers - Yudhishthira, Bhimsen, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva
 pandavon ke pita kaa naam pandu tha
 He was a great Kuruvanshi king! Pandu had two wives - Kunti and Madri
 yudhisthir, bhim tathaa arjuna kii mata kunti thi or nakul evam sahadev maadri ke putr the
 Once King Pandu along with his two wives - Kunti and Madri - went to the forest for hunting
 vahaan unhen ek mrug kaa maithunarat joda drushtigat hua
 Pandu immediately wounded the deer with his arrow
 marate huye mrug ne pandu ko shaap diya, "rajan! tumhaare samaan krur purush is sansar main koi bhi nahin hoga
 You have shot me at the time of sexual intercourse, so whenever you become pregnant, you will die
 " Pandu was deeply saddened by this curse and said to his queens, "ladies! Now i will give up all my lusts and stay in this forest, you go back to Hastinapur
" After listening to their words, both queens grieved and said, " Nath! We cannot live for a single moment without you
 aap hamen bhi van main apane saath rakhane kii krupa kijiye
 "pandu accepted his request and allowed him to live with him in the forest
 isi dauraan raja pandu ne amavasya ke din rishi-muniyon ko brahma ji ke darshanon ke liye jate huye dekha
 He urged those sages and sages to take themselves along
 unke is aagrah par rishi-muniyon ne kaha, "rajan! koi bhi nihsantaan purush brahmalok jane kaa adhikari nahin ho saktaa atah ham aapako apane saath le jane main asamarth hai
 " rishi-muniyon kii baat sun kar pandu apni patni se bole, "he kunti! meraa janm lenaa hi vrutha ho rahaa he kyonki santanheen vyakti pitru-rin, rishi-rin, dev-rin tathaa manushya-rin se mukti nahin paa saktaa kya tum putr prapti ke liye meri sahaayta kar sakati ho?" kunti boli, "he aryaputra! durvasa rishi ne mujhe aisa mantra pradaan kiya he jisase main kisi bhi devtaa kaa aahvaan karke manovanchit vastu praapt kar sakati hoon
 You command which god i should call
 " is par pandu ne dharm ko aamantrit karne kaa aadesh diya
 Dharma gave Kunti a son named Yudhishthira

 The atmosphere was very pleasant and there was a cool, slow-smelling air
 sahasaa vaayu ke jhonke se maadri kaa vastra ud gaya
 This caused Pandu's mind to become fickle and he was prone to sexual intercourse that he died under curse

 But behaviors that help others to live, and reduce the creature's ability to live on its own, were thought to challenge Darwin's theory of evolution
 wilson or wilson ke anusaar, vaigyanik pichley 50 varshon se khoj rahe hai ki aapasi sahaayta, jisamen paryaaywad, sahyog, sahopakaarita, aadi bhi aate hai, kaa praaniyon main kaise vikaas hua
 In 1975, biologist Wilson started a new branch of social sciences, in which mutual aid emerged as a significant problem
 kintu wilson ne bhi anuvanshik ikai yaa jin kii prakruti ko swaarthee mana, or kaha kii jin apni adhik se adhik pratilipiyaan banane ke liye patibaddh he

 Psychologist Feldmann describes aid as the bright side of human nature
 unhone 1980 ke dashak ke letaane or anya logon ke prayogon kaa varnan karte hue likhaa ki madad dene vaala is vyavhaar par hone vaale laabh or haani kaa jaeza lekar hi is kaary main agrasar hota he
 Feldmann believes that although philanthropy or synonymism is also an end in aid, it emphasizes self-denial, such as a person jumping into a fire-burning house to save an unborn child
 is bare main halden kaa tark he ki kisi vyakti ko is tarah kaa kaary karnaa tabhi laabhadaayak rahegaa, yadi vah apane sage sambandhi ko bachaa sake

 In his book, Darwin wrote several examples of philanthropy, such as the mutual relationship between insect classes and flowers, that it is the result of a separate conflict between the two species
 unhone ne alankaarik bhashaa main kaha ki, aadmi kritrim chayan se paaltu pashuon main aapane phaayde ke gun chunata he, kintu prakruti chayan dwaara praani main vah gun chunati he jo us praani ke jeene main sahaayak hon
 If the behavior of the animal helps the other to live, it will be selected only when the group of the animal benefits, such as social insect bees, termites, etc
 cropotkin kehete hai, darwin ne in vichaaron kaa vistaar nahin kiya, or jeene ke liye paraspar sahyog ke bajaae, pratispardhaa ko apane siddhant main mukhya jagah di
 Nearly a hundred years later, scientists are saying that mutual aid or cooperation is the basis of life
 aapasi sahaayta kaa sabase adhik vistaar manushya main hua he, or sahaj vyavhaar ke saath-saath isamen saanskrithik, manovaigyanik, aarthik, or anya pahalu bhi judate gaye
 In this context, Bhagwan Das made special mention of mutual aid in his book on momentum
 unhone teen prakaar ke saamaajik aadan-pradaan kii kalpana kar aapasi sahaayta kii vivechna kii
 In these types of relationships, one is the giver and the other is the recipient, who needs some thing or service
 kisi anya vastu kii praapak main bahutayat he, to vah daata ko degaa, or is vastu kii drushti se daata kahalaayegaa
 This is the most common relation of mutual aid
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki koi vyakti oonche pad par he or uske paas ek vastu bahutayat main he, phir bhi ek neeche str kaa vyakti use khush karne ke liye use vah vastu degaa
 In the third type of relationship, a higher class person who has something in abundance, voluntarily gives a small part of it to the lower class person who needs it
 bhagwaan das ne is teesri prakaar ke sambandh ko vishesh mana, jisaki vyakhya kathin he
 In society, it is called philanthropy, Bhagwan Das, while this behavior gives the benefactor a mental benefit
 cropotkin ne kaha kii aapasi sahaayta jantuon ke udvikas main ek mahatvapurn kaarak he
 The facts related to it, observations on animals and humans, he put in his book in 1902
 is pustak ke prakkathan main aashle mauntagu ne likhaa he ki, vastav main cropotkin ne prakritik chayan ke poorak paksh ko zordaar shabdon main rakhaa, jise darwin ke anuyaayon ne dabaa diya tha
 Montagu further states that as a true anarchist, he considered parity and mutual aid as the basis for natural philosophy
 prakritik pratibha se ot-prot gothe se bhi, cropotkin ne likhaa, jantuon main aapasi madad kii gahanta chhipi nahin thi
 Bryan Goodwin, an expert on modern development, moved on from Gothe's dynamic view of life, stating that life itself originates from the mutual association of cells, and this sequence is also seen in various forms in human social institutions
 gudwin kehete hai ki jeev vigyaan main pratispardhaa, paroapkaar, swaarthee jin, sabase sakasham kaa jeena, aadi shabd alankaar yaa roopak kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 On one hand these words carry the meaning of these principles easily to the common people, on the other hand, the interests and competition prevalent in contemporary cultural thinking become part of scientific principles
 gudwin aage likhte hai ki vastav main in rupakon kaa koi aatanrik mulya nahin he
 After all, why did biology give so much importance to competition, Goodwin asked, why not consider cooperation to be a catalyst for growth
 aapasi sahaayta ke udhaaharan koshika se lekar manushya ke jatil vyavhaaron main he
 It is clear from the above facts that there is a change in the thinking of scientists regarding the development of mutual aid
 hardi kahati he kii vanar or maanav main pratispardhaa main itnaa antar nahin jitna sahyogi vyavhaar main he, arthath manushya atyaadhik saamaajik praani he
 One reason for this is the contribution of other members of the group according to Hardi to the child's upbringing

 Khare and his colleagues found that acs develop in social amoebae by identifying the freebies and developing resistance against them, so that the freebies do not participate in the work of mutual support by other amoebas, so They are deprived of their benefits and are unable to face the conditions like starvation

 In 1935, Crawford studied collaboration in chimpanzees
 do chimpangiyon ko pehle alag-alag ek samasya ko suljhaana sikhaaya
 The chimpanzee was held in a cage made of iron rods
 uske saamne kuch duuri par ek bakse ke upar kuch kele rakkhe
 Then, tied to a rope box, his other corner caught the chimpanzee
 kuch hi kshanon main chimpanji ne baksaa apni ore khinchaa or kele kha liya
 Then made the box so heavy that a chimpanzee could not pull it
 ab donon chimpangiyon ke pinjaron ko paas-paas rakh, donon ke haath main alag alag rassi di jo us bakse se bandhi thi jis par kele the
 Initially both the chimpanzees pulled the boxes towards themselves
 kuch prayaason ke baad vah donon us bakse ko ek saath kheenchna sikh gaye
 Melis and his comrades looked at a somewhat different situation from Crawford, seeing that chimpanzees behave spontaneously in the laboratory only when they are allowed to choose allies at will
 ek anya prayog main, shell or anya logon ne chimpangiyon kii toli ke raste main saanp rakhaa
 a chimpanzee who saw that snake first, gave a voice of danger while looking towards his companion

 Madhav Gadgil in his studies has given priority to the ecological aspect of various levels of social systems, both animals and humans
 unka maananaa he ki saamaajik sanghathan jivan ke sroton kii sulabhta se judaa he
 The distribution of this access is generally simple in egalitarian society, but as the organization of the society will be complex, there will be inequalities
 gadgil kaa maananaa he ki pracheen bhartiya samaaj main is samasya kaa kaaphi had tak samaadhaan kiya gaya tha, jiskaa mukhya aadhaar samooh ke sabhi sadasyon kii jivan kii mukhya aavashyaktaaon kii poorti uske aas-paas ke sroton se samaan rup se ho
