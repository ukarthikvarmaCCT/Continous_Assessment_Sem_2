 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment

 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents

 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s "

 This situation was disappointing

 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized

 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 It was during this struggle that Gandhiji was addressed by the public in the name of Bapu's father and Mahatma
 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha

 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj

 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted
 kerala rajya kaa janapad trishur dakshin bharat kii ek pramukh dharmik nagari he
 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words

 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border

 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough

 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries

 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he

gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"

 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice
 gandhi ji ne apane satyagrah andolan main aise logon ko dur hi rakhaa jo hathiyaar uthaane se darate the athwa pratirodh karne main swayan kii aakshamata kaa anubhav karte the

 This was due to his heir apparent curiosity in which his enthusiastic friend Sheikh Mehtab also contributed

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 After reading John Ruskin's Unto This Last, he decided to change his lifestyle and create a community called Amarpakshi Settlement
 dakshin africa, jahaan se unhone vakaalat puri kii thi tathaa dhan or safalataa ke saath jude the vahaan se lautne ke pashchaat unhone pashchami style ke vastron kaa tyaag kiya

 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer
 kai dashakon tak ve anek patron kaa sampadan kar chuke the jisame harijan, indian opinian, yang india aadi sammilit hai
 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars
 yah prakaashan teen bhashaaon main hua
 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech
 ek to yah ki prayek khand ke ant main aksharkram se shabdanukramanika di gayi he jisase adhyayan tathaa vibhinn kaaryvash punarawalokan main atyant suvidha ho gayi he; tathaa duusari yah ki prayek khand ke ant main gandhi ji kaa tareekhwar jivan-vrittant diya gaya he, jisase saraltapurvak ek nazar main gandhiji ke jivan kii sabhi mahatvapurn ghatnaon evam baton kii sankshipt jaankaree uplabdh ho jaati he

 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time
 " saath hi saath ve yah bhi kehete hai, "gandhi ke jail ke anubhav ne unhen un logon ki sthiti ke prati adhik samvedansheel bana diya tha

 " ve jari rakhte hai un vivaadon kaa hawala dete hue jo gandhi ki pratimaa ke anaavaran ke dauraan uthe the
 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake
 On some occasions he has called himself a philosophical anarchist
 In his sense, an independent India exists with thousands of small self-sufficient communities that rule on their own without the hurdle of others

 ] Template: histofscience The term geometry emerged as a field of knowledge about stereoscopic relationships
 jyamiti purv-aadhunik ganit ke do kshetron main se ek tha; or doosraa kshetra sankhyaon ke adhyayan se sambandhit tha
 Traditional geometry focused on compass and straightedge structures

 For example, both Egyptians and Babylonians were already familiar with versions of the Pythagoras theorem about 1500 years before Pythagoras; The Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of the frustum of a square pyramid; The Babylonians had a trigonometry table
 pracheen misr ke log yah jaanate the ki ve ek vrutt ke kshetrafal kaa anumaan nimnlikhit prakaar se laga sakate hai: In Ames Papyrus Problem 50, these methods are used to calculate the area of a circle according to a rule that the area is equal to the square of 8 / 9 of the diameter of the circle

 For ancient Greek mathematicians, geometry was the pearl of the crown of their sciences, reaching a degree of completeness and precision that was not achieved by any other branch of their knowledge
 unhone jyamiti kii shrinkhalaa ko kai nae prakaar ke aankadon, modon, satahon or thoson main vistaarit kiya; unhone isaki pranali ko trial-and-erar se taarkik katautee main badal diya; unhone yah sweekaar kiya ki jyamiti "aparivartansheel swaroopon" yaa amoortata kaa adhyayan karti he jiske liye bhautik vasteen keval anumaan hai; or unhone "swayansiddh vidhi" ke vichaar ko viksit kiya jo aaj bhi upyog main he

 The biggest thing that we can say about Thales overall is that he introduced various geometric theorems to the Greeks
 yah vichaar ki ganit apni shuruyaat ke samay se hi nigamanaatmak tha, yah galat he
 Mathematics was critical at the time of Thales
 iskaa matlab yah he ki thels ne anubhavjanya or pratyaksh pramaan "prastut" kiya hoga, lekin nigamanaatmak pramaan nahin)
 Philosopher Plato was the most respected figure for the Greeks who wrote above the entrance of his famous school, "no one will be ignorant of geometry by coming here
" Although he was not a mathematician himself, his ideas about mathematics were strongly influenced
 isliye ganitagyon ne unki is dharna ko sweekaar kiya ki jyamiti ko compass or streetes ke atirikt kisi bhi upkaran kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie - maapak upkarnon jaise ki ek chihnit ruler yaa ek konemaapak kaa kabhi nahin, kyonki ye karmkaaron ke upkaran hote hai, kisi vidwaan ke laayak nahin
 This quote led to an in-depth study of possible compass and straightedge constructions and three traditional construction problems: dividing an angle into three parts, creating a cube twice the volume of a given cube, and one equal to the area of a given circle
 How to use these tools in constructing a class

 The treatise is not a compendium of all the information known about geometry to Hellenistic mathematicians of the time; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry

 The following are his five verses, which have been explained in some detail to make English easier to read
 
 Archimedes, resident of Syracuse, Sicily, when it was a Greek city-state, is often considered to be the greatest of the Greek mathematicians, and even sometimes referred to as one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time
 agar ve ek ganitagya nahin hote, phir bhi unhen ek mahaan bhautik vigyaani, ejeeniyar or avishkaarak ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa

 There is a growing consensus among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered many catastrophic events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's Pagan temples was probably the most devastating and eventual event in the fourth century
 us vinaash ke pramaan sabase adhik nishchit or surakshit hai
 Caesar's invasion also caused the destruction of approximately 40,000–70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port, but it is unlikely that they had affected the library or museum, given that both were later in existence
 Substantial evidence exists

 shatapath brahman main sulb sutara kii tarah dharmik jyamitiya nirmaan ke liye niyamon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The Sulab Sutra gives a list of rules for the construction of Yajagagni altars

 The altars were required to be constructed in five layers of baked brick, with the further condition that each layer should be of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers should have a uniform arrangement of bricks
 ke anusaar, sulb sutara main "duniya main pithagoras ke prameya kii sabase praarambhik prachlit maukhik vyakhya shaamil he, haalanki iske bare main pracheen babylon vaasiyon ko pehle se hi jaankaree thi

 "since these tablets date back several centuries from the Sulba Sutra period, it is reasonable to expect that similar understanding would have been held in India too, keeping in mind the relevant nature of some triples
 Dani goes on to say: "chunki sulvasutra kaa mukhya uddeshy vediyon kii sanrachana or unamem shaamil jyamitiya siddhanton kaa varnan karnaa tha, pithagoras ke tripuls kaa vishay, yahan tak ki agar ise acchhee tarah samaj liya jaataa, shaayad phir bhi ise sulvasutra main nahin bataaya gaya hota

 Two important developments in geometry occurred in the early 17th century
 The first and most important event was the creation of analytical geometry or geometry with coordinates and equations by René Descretes and Pierre de Fermat
 yah calculas or bhautikee ke sateek maatraatmak vigyaan ke vikaas ke liye ek aavashyak agradoot sabit hua
 The second geometrical progression of this period was the systematic study of projective geometry by Girard Desarges
 projective jyamiti maap ke bagaiyr jyamiti kaa adhyayan he yani sirf yah adhyayan ki kis tarah binduen ek duusare se talmail banaati hai
 Some early work was done in this area by Hellenistic geometrists, notably Papus
 mahanatam flowering of da field kaa sambandh jin victor poncillat ke saath tha
 Calculus was developed independently and almost simultaneously by Isaac Newton and Gottfred Wilhelm von Leibniz in the late 17th century
 yah ganit ke ek nae kshetra kii shuruyaat thi jise ab vishleshan kaha jaataa he
 Although it is not a branch of geometry itself, it is still used in geometry and has solved two families of problems that have been almost rigid for a long time: detecting tangent lines in odd curves and those curves Locating Surrounded Areas
 The calculus method reduced these problems to mostly straightforward cases of computation
 euclid kii chaar abhidharanaon se unki paanchavin abhidharana, "samanaantar abhidharana" ko pramanit karne kii puraani samasya ko kabhi bhulaayaa nahin gaya tha
 Shortly after Euclid, several attempts at representation were made, but some theories which were not substantiated by the first four postulates themselves through the acceptance of logic, were later found to be faulty
 haalanki umr khayyam bhi samanaantar avadharana ko sabit karne main asafal rahe the, euclid ke samanantaron ke siddhanton kii aalochanaon or gaiyr-euclidian jyamiti main sankhyaon ke gunon ke unke pramaan ne antat gaiyr-euclidian jyamiti ke vikaas main yogadan diya tha
 In 1700, a major discovery was made in the context of deficiencies encountered in trying to validate the first four concepts and the fifth concept
 sacheri, lambart or legandre teenon ne is samasya par 18veen sadi main utkrisht kaary kiye, lekin lekin phir bhi safalataa unase dur hi rahi
 In the early 19th century, Gauss, Johann Bolyai, and Lobachevsky each independently took a different view
 is andeh ke saath shuruyaat karte hue ki samanaantar avadharanaon ko pramanit karnaa asambhav tha, unhone ek aatm-sangat jyamiti ke vikaas par kaam kiya jisamen vah avadharana galat thi
 He was successful in this and thus created the first non-euclidean geometry
 1854 main gaus ke ek chaatr, bernahard riman ne samast chikani satahon kii aatanrik jyamiti ke ek jabardast adhyayan main calculas kii vidhi kaa prayog kiya tha or is prakaar ek alag gaiyr-eucalidian jyamiti viksit hui thi
 Reimann's works later became the basis of Einstein's theory of relativity
 yah pramanit karnaa baaki rah gaya tha ki gaiyr-eucalidian jyamiti ekadam utani hi aatm-sangat thi jitna ki eucalidian jyamiti or is kaary ko sabase pehle beltrami dwaara 1868 main puraa kiya gaya tha
 With this, non-euclidean geometry was established on a similar mathematical level with Euclidean geometry
 haalanki ab yah maaloom ho gaya tha ki vibhinn jyamitiya siddhant ganitiya tareeke se sambhav the, yah sawaal baaki hi rah gaya ki "inamen se koun sa siddhant hamaare bhautik jagat ke liye sahi he?" ganitiya kaary se yah pataa chal gaya ki is sawaal kaa jawaab bhautikeey prayogon ke jariye diya janaa chahie naa ki ganitiya tark se, saath hi yah kaaran bhi ujagar hua ki is prayog main anant duriyon ko anivaary rup se kyon shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 This question became much more complicated with the development of the theory of relativity in physics
 samanaantar avadharanaon se sambandhit sabhi kaaryon se yah pataa chalaa ki ek jyamitikaar ke liye apane taarkik aadhaar ko bhautik jagat ke apane antargyaan kii samaj se alag karnaa kaaphi mushkil tha or iske alaava aisa karne ke aalochanatmak mahatv kaa bhi pataa chalaa

 This criticism paralleled the analysis in terms of the difficulties encountered in the calculus and the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity

 Such quotes were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his thesis Grundlagen der Geometry
 sukhtiyon ke kuch anya sampurna set isse kuch varsh pehle die gaye the lekin ye arthvyavastha, laalitya or euclid kii sukhtiyon kii samanta main mail hilbert kii sukhtiyon se nahin khate the
 In the mid-18th century, it became clear that certain episodes of mathematical logic developed when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions
 is prakaar ek metric spes kii saamaanya avadharana bani thi jisase ki rijning kahin adhik vyapaktaa main ho sake or iske baad vishesh maamalon main inkaa prayog kiya ja sake
 This method of studying calculus- and analytical concepts became known as analysis sites and later as topology

 Topology soon became a separate field of major importance rather than a subfield of geometry or analysis

 From a historical point of view, traditional music had the following characteristics: kshetra yaa samskruti se sambandhit tha
 In the context of an immigrant group, folk music has an additional dimension to social cohesion
 aisa sanyukt rajya america main vishesh rup se adhik spasht he, jahaan polish mul ke america, irish mul ke america or asian america mukhya dhara se alag hone kaa purajor prayaas kar rahe hai
 They will learn songs and dances basically from countries where their elders have come from
 ek dushprabhav ke rup main, kabhi-kabhi nimnlikhit visheshtaayen pai jaati hai: In addition to instrumental music, which is a part of traditional music, especially dance music traditions, most traditional music is singing music, as the instruments used in composing such music are generally easy
 isliye adhikansh paaramparik sangeet main sarthak bol hai
 Narrative verses are found in the traditional music of many cultures
 yah paaramparik mahakavy kaa rup le lete hai, mulat iskaa adhikansh hissaa maukhik pradarshan se sambandhit tha, jisame kabhi-kabhi vaadya yantron kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Many epics from different cultures were created by combining small portions of traditional narrative verses that describe their contextual structure and often include plot development
 paramparaagat kathatmak chhandon ke anya rup yudhon tathaa anya traasadiyon yaa prakritik aapadaaon ke parinaamon se sambandhit hai
 Sometimes, as in the song Song of Deborah, the victorious song found in the Bible's Book of Judges, these songs celebrate victory
 kai paramparaon main haari gai ladaaiyon or yudhon, tathaa unamem marane waalon ke liye kiye jane vaale geet rupi vilaap utane hi pramukh hai; ye vilaap us kaaran kii yaad dilaate hai jiske liye yuddh ladaa gaya tha
 Narrative interpretations of traditional songs recall folk heroes ranging from John Henry to Robin Hood
 kuch paaramparik geeton main kahi gai kathaayen alokik ghatnaon yaa rahasyamay mauton kii yaad dilaati hai
 Hymns and other forms of religious music are often of traditional and unknown origin
 pashchimi sangeet chihnon ko mul rup se gregorian mantra kii linon ko yaad rakhane ke liye sangrakshit rakhane ke liye banaaya gaya tha, jo apane avishkaar se pehle math samudaayon main maukhik parampara ke rup main padhaaye jate the
 Traditional songs like Green Grow the Rheses, o impart religious learning in a memorable manner
 pashchimi duniya main, christmas carol tathaa anya paaramparik gane dharmik vidya ko geet ke rup main sangrakshit rakhte hai
 Work-related songs often display call and response structures and are designed in such a way that the workers singing them can coordinate their work with the rhythms of the songs
 They are often, but not always, composed
 america sashastr balon main, sainikon ke march ke dauraan joudy kol kii ek jeevant parampara gaai jaati he
 Professional sailors have used a large body of maritime folklore
 prem kavitaayen, jo aksar dukhad yaa khedjanak prakruti kii hoti hai, kai lok paramparaon kaa ek aham hissaa hai
 Nursery poems and nonsense poems are also frequently chosen themes of traditional songs
 ek samudaay ke madhyam se maukhik rup se sanchaarit hone vaale sangeet main, aane vaale samay main, kai bhinnataaon kaa vikaas hoga, kyonki is prakaar ke sancharan ke liye sateek shabd or vyakhya bananaa sambhav nahin he
 Indeed, many traditional singers are quite creative and they deliberately modify the information learned
 udhaaharan ke liye, "ai'm e main you dont meet evari de" ke shabd bodleian librari ke poster se liye gaye hai
 The date is almost certainly pre-1900 and seems Irish
 1958 main canada main ek geet record kiya gaya tha 
 jaini robertson ne 1961 main record hone vaala aglaa sanskaran banaaya
 He has changed it to one of his relatives, "jock Stewart" and has no Irish references
 1976 main archi fisher ne jaanboojhkar goli se marane ja rahe kute kaa sandarbh hataane ke liye geet main parivartan kiya
 In 1985, The Pogues completed this cycle by restoring all Irish references
 kyonki bhinnataayen swaabhaaviktaa ko badhaati hai, isliye aisa maananaa morrkhtaa he ki barbara alan

 Researchers of traditional songs have found countless versions of this saga in the English-speaking world and often these versions are quite different from each other
 koi bhi majbooti se mul geet hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa or bahut sambhav he ki jo kuch bhi "mul" geet tha, vah sadiyon pehle gaaya jaataa tha
 Any version can make the same claim for authenticity as long as it belongs solely to a traditional singing community and no external editor has made any changes to it
 cesil sharp ke paas lok sangeet main badlaav ke bare main ek prabhaavshaalee vichaar tha: unhone mahasoos kiya ki ek paaramparik geet ke sanskaran taiyaar karne kii hode ek jaivik prakritik chayan ke sadrush thi: keval ve nae sanskaran jo saadhaaran gayakon ko sarvaadhik aakarshith karte the, ko dusron dwaara chunaa jaataa tha or samay ke saath badlaav ke saath sanchaarit kiya jaataa tha
 Thus, with the passage of time we would expect the aesthetics to become more attractive in a traditional song - as it would be collectively composed by the community in its best form
 duusari ore, is drushtikon ke samarthan ke liye bhi saboot maujuud hai ki paaramparik geeton main badlaav ghatiya ho saktaa he
 Sometimes, the collected traditional song versions contain information or verses taken from different songs that have little connection with its context
 sarah cleveland ek sammanit paaramparik irish-america gayika hai
 The version of his song "let No Man Steel Your Thyme" contains a mixture of another song - "seeds of Love"
 
 donon geeton main phulon kaa ullekh he, lekin vishay kaaphi alag he
 Similarly, many traditional songs are referred to only as fragments
 shaayad ek aadh maamle main keval ek yaa do panktiyaan record kii gai hai
 Although traditional music is declining due to the promotion of popular music worldwide, it is not happening at the same rate worldwide
 jabaki kai adivasee samskritiyaan paaramparik sangeet or lok sangeet ko kho rahi hai, yah prakriya un kshetron main sarvaadhik teevr gati se ho rahi he "jahaan samskruti kaa audyogikaran evam vyavsyeekaran sabase unnatahain"
 phir bhi un deshon yaa kshetron main, jahaan paramparaagat sangeet saanskrithik yaa rashtriya pahchaan ko darshata he, paaramparik sangeet ke nuksaan ko dhimaa kiya ja saktaa he; aisa sach main ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye jaise bangladesh, hungary, bharat, ireland, latvia, turki, portugal, brittani tathaa galicia, yunaan tathaa careet ke maamle main, jo kuch had tak apane paaramparik sangeet ko bachaae hue hai, kuch kshetron main paaramparik sangeet ke str main giravat or samskruti main hraas ko roka gaya he
 This is most pronounced where some areas have been named "celtic" by tourist agencies
 ireland, scotland, cornwall, brittani tathaa nova scotia kii maardarshak pustakon tathaa ishtehaaron main sangeet pradarshnon ke sidhe prasaaran / shravan kaa ullekh he
 The local government often revives the lost tradition by sponsoring and promoting such events during tourist sessions

 One such effort was the collection of Francis James Child in the late 19th century, a treatise of more than three hundred ballads of English and Scott traditions
 During the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published a wide-ranging four-part collection of changes to the writings and melodies of the time, known as the Child Canon
 kehane sunne kii parampara ke kaamkaaj ke siddhanton ke sambandh main bhi usne mahatvapurn pragati kii
 Contemporary devotees of Child came to Sabine bering-guld and hereafter and especially to Cecil Sharp who worked in the early 20th century under the auspices of the English Folk Dance and Song Society for preserving the great heritage of English rural traditional songs, music and dance

 Perhaps the most extensive work in Riga was by Crisjanis Baronce, publishing six volumes between 1894 and 1915, with 217 996 articles by Latvian folk songs, Latvju Denas
 is samay ke aasapaas, shastreey sangeet ke sangeetkaaron ne paaramparik geeton ke sangrah main atyadhik ruchi dikhaai or kai jane maane sangeetkaaron ne khud paaramparik geeton par gahan kaary kiya
 These included Percy Granger and Rolf von Williams of England and Bela Bartok of Hungary
 in sangeetkaaron ne, apane kai purvavartiyon kii tarah, apni shastreey rachanaaon main paaramparik jaankaree ko shaamil kiya
 Latviju Denas is widely used in classical hymns of Andrés Jurans, Janice Sims and Emilis Melngailis

 Those who studied traditional songs had once hoped that their work would restore traditional music to people
 udhaaharan ke liye, cesil sharp ne schuli bacchon ko angreji paaramparik geet sikhaane ke liye chalaae gaye abhiyaan dwaara kuch safalataa praapt kii
 a theme that has continued throughout the great period of the traditional scholarly collection of scholars is based on the tendency of some members of "folk" music, who were expected to become the object of study, to become scholars themselves And promote your side
 Jean Ritchie Viper, for example, was the youngest child in a large Kentucky family who preserved many old traditional songs in the Appalachian region
 richi us samay hui thi jab appalachian bahari duniya ke sampark main aae hi the, usne uniwarsity se padhai kii thi or antat neuyork shahar main sthanantarit ho gai, jahaan usne parivaar ke pradarshnon kii kai clasik ricarding banaain tathaa in geeton kaa ek mahatvapurn sankalan prakashit kiya
 Another important issue about North American folklore and traditional songs for much of the twentieth century was whether the information transmitted orally was provided as a series of motifs or as a whole song
 , In which the former approach took place before the latter and at the time of its emergence both approaches have given prevailing psychological theories of learning Reflected the principles
 sangeet vidwaanon ke bich nunekaaree drushtikon kaa ek pramukh vaktaa jorge pulen jackson tha, jisane 1930 or 1940 ke dashak main, "tanayukt aavaran" yaa vilakshan sangitamay dhunon ke chihnon kii avadharana sthapit kii or iskaa bachaav kiya, jo aksar prayog main laae jane ke kaaran sangrah kii vastu ban gaye or nai dhunon ko taiyaar karne tathaa maujuuda dhunon ko sanshodhit karne kii prakriya main kadi ban gaye
 In 1950, Samuel Preston Baird defended the holistic approach, setting the world of musicology by narration and emotion on his own, stating that the process of memorizing and repeating music did not work the way he did in Jackson
 And others imagine
 beard ne gestalt sangeet vigyaan, jo sadi ke madhya main lokapriy ban gaya tha, ke hawaale se tark diya ki vaakyansh jaisi badi sanrachanaatmak ikaiyaan tathaa yahaan tak ki puri dhun bhi mote taur par rup-rekha ke roopaatmak niyamon kaa paalan karti hai tathaa yah ki purna sangitamay dhun kii vakreey rekhaaen, na ki lay ke chote namoonay, hi paaramparik sangeetkaar ke mastishk main smriti chihnon ke rup main shaamil ho paati hai
 These ideas were adopted, revised in various ways and reproduced by Sirwart Poladian and others
 1960 or 70 ke dashak main bartrend baronson or anyon ne is dharna par kaam shuru kiya ki yah prakriya na to puri tarah se nunekaaree ho sakati thi or na hi samgr, apitu yah in donon kaa jatil mishran thi, jabaki inhen aakaar dene main musical scale kaa bhi yogadan tha
 Using this idea and similar ideas, coming to a conclusion, but at the same time keeping in mind the old approaches and adding to our own detailed analysis, the musicologist J

 Marshall Beville developed and introduced the theory of musical generation, broadcasting, assimilation and recollection, which recognized the importance of a holistic approach but also the beginning and end of a formulaic section as memory aids and reference points
 Emphasis was also placed on importance, in which larger sections had more variable starting and ending phrases which were of less importance

 Based on these perspectives and the characteristics of music that he was investigating, which were mainly melodies and melodies of traditional hymns in the American Southern Mountains, Beville developed a system of comparative musical analysis that led many linguists, particularly Attracted Noam Chomsky and others who established functional grammar
