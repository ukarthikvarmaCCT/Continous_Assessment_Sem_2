 The publication of 'criticism' originally started in October 1951 as a quarterly literary magazine centered on criticism
 iske sansthaapak sampadak the shivdaan singh chouhan
 Criticism established itself as an excellent magazine in its early times
 iske prakaashan ke ek varsh puraa hone par hi july 1952 ke ank main is ke sampadak chouhan ji ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa tha "aalochana kaa ek varsh samaapt hua
 This publication was welcomed everywhere in Hindi literature as 'a historical event'
 " chouhan ji ne aalochana ke keval 5 ankon kaa sampadan kiya
 The history published in his editing was well-known
 "aalochana ke paanchave ank 'itihaas visheshank' ke baad 1953 main chouhanji kii chuttee ho gai
 " iske baad aalochana ke sampadan ke liye ek sampadak mandal kii niyukti hui jisamen dharmaveer bharti, raghuvansh, vijayadev narayan saahi tathaa brajeshwar verma shaamil the
 Nandadulare Vajpayee became the editor of criticism after this
 "vaajapeyi ji ne april 1956 ke 18wein ank se 'aalochana' kaa sampaadan-bhaar sambhala or april 1959 ke 26wein ank tak is kaa nirvaah kiya
 " iske baad punah shivdaan singh chouhan aalochana ke sampadak niyukt hue or 've 1966 i0 tak uske sampadak bane rahe
 "in May 1967" Sheela Sandhu removed Shivdan Singh Chauhan and appointed Namvar Singh as its editor
 is baat se shivdaan singh chouhan bahut aahat hue or namvar ke khilaaf lambey samay tak gusse se bhare rahe
 He continued to be called the Don of Hindi literature and even to the Mafia
 " The publication of the criticism began in a new way with the issue of april-june 1967 and its editing was handled by Dr
 Namwar Singh
 "unke sampadan main nikali aalochana ko hindi main nae yug kaa aarambh mana gaya or ise nawank-1 kii sangya di gai
 Publication of the magazine 'criticism', which gave the Hindi-world the ideological temperament "in the editing of Dr
 Namwar Singh with the cooperation of several sub-editors", was suspended in 1990 after the publication of its 48th issue
 " aalochana kaa antim ank 1990 kii april-june kaa tha
 In the early period of his editing, Dr
 Namwar Singh took out an issue of 'criticism' centered on him to commemorate the statement of Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi
 phir muktibodh par kendrit ank bhi nikaala
 In October 1970, Namvar Singh moved to Jodhpur due to his appointment to the Hindi Department of Jodhpur University and on his suggestion, his beloved critic Vishnu Khare was made the Executive Editor of Criticism
 namvar ji ne ehtiyaat ke taur par aarambhik kuch anko main unka kaam dekhne ke baad hi sampadak ke rup main unka naam chaape jane kii baat kahi thi, parantu vishnu khare ne apane sampadan ke duusare ank ke mudran-samay main hi sampadak rup main apana naam diye jane tathaa apane naam se sampadakeey chaape jane par jor diya
 Namvar Ji did not approve of his release and due to this, the incident of editing of Vishnu Khare stopped there
 san 1980 main ank 54-55 se nandakishor naval aalochana ke sah-sampadak banaaye gayi or ank 76 tak unhone bakhubi yah daayitv nibhaayaa
 Nawal ji was kindred to Namvar ji, but in 1985, Apurvananda wrote a pamphlet titled 'nagarjuna's politics' in response to the views of Nagarjuna and his role was written by Nandkishore Nawal
 yah nagarjun ke prati naval ji kii katu tippanee thi, "jisase namvar ji sakht naaraaz ho gayi or unhone turant naval ji ko sah sampaadakatv se alag karne kaa nirnay le liya
 Naval ji was removed from the post of co-editor by Sheila Sandhu, managing editor of the criticism
 ank 77 se iske sah-sampadak prasiddh aalochak parmanand shrivastav banaaye gayi
 The january-june 1981 issue was released as a focus on Nagarjuna
 namvar ji ke pradhan sampadakatv main aalochana ke anek vishisht ank nikle, parantu apane lekhan ke urj par hone tathaa anek anya vyasttaaon ke kaaran ve aalochana ke liye paryaapt samay to nahin hi de pate the, sampadakeey bhi baraabar samay par nahin pahunch paata tha
 In the words of Managing Editor Sheela Sandhu "due to delayed publication due to issue of material and editorial time, publication of unhappy conjuncts due to miseries of time or material, textual complaints of not being able to become personal form of magazine gradually etc
 There were practical things that sometimes led to a situation of communication loss
 " or antat april-june 1990 ke ank ke saath aalochana kaa prakaashan band ho gaya
 After a decade passed, the publication of criticism started again in April 2000, from the april-june issue of the year 2000 and it was named as 'millennium Issue One'
 namvar singh kaa naam iske pradhan sampadak ke rup main diya gaya or parmanand shrivastav ko sampadak banaaya gaya
 Arvind Tripathi joined as co-editor
 kareeb teen dashak pehle namvar singh ke sampadan main aarambh hone vaali 'aalochana' ke nawank-1 main pehali baar bharat main fasivadi khatre kii chetavanee di gayi thi or itane lambey antaraal ke baad punah aalochana kaa 'sahasrabdi ank ek' bhi 'fasiwad or samskruti kaa sankat' vishay par hi kendrit kiya gaya
 This rich issue of revival criticism, supported by the writings of many of the best writers of the wider Hindi world, became quite popular and it was only in May 2001 that the publisher had to reprint it and publish it
 paramanand shrivastav ke sampadan main is patrika ne punah apana pracheen gaurav hasil kar liya or hindi sahitya kii shreshthatam patrikaon main yah pariganya rahi
 However, its fifth issue was quite infamous

 This is the original misfortune, due to which this issue has been sponsored on the anniversary of Ram Vilas Sharma
 " haalaanki is ank ke sivaa iske anya ank behad uttam rahe
 General marks are also important like special digits
 parmanand shrivastav ke in chaar varshon ke sampadan main chaar sanyuktaankon ke baavjood anek vishisht ank 'aalochana' ke gaurav ko unchaa uthaaye rakhaa
 Its great combination 17-18 was focused on Bhishma Sahni's personality and overall work
 ank 21 se prasiddh kavi arun camel iske avaitnaik sampadak niyukt hue or ank 52 tak is daayitv ko nibhaate rahe
 The most important thing with the criticism of Arun Kamal's editing was that it was largely cut off from the wider Hindi writer community

85 Gosaicipur is a village located in Handia block of Allahabad district of Uttar Pradesh state, India
 lava pighali hui chattan aarthaat megma kaa dharaatal par prakat hokar bahane vaala bhaag he
 It erupts through volcanic eruptions and forms igneous rocks
 khel siddhant or arthshaastra main shunya-sanchay khel yaa shunya-jod khel aisi vyavhaarik paristhiti ko kaha jaataa he jisamen ek vyakti ko jitna laabh hota he thik utani hi haani kisi anya vyakti ko hoti he
 For example, if two people have a hundred rupees and they are exchanging money among themselves, then it is a 'zero-accumulation game' because the more one gets, the less the other will get
 agar donon kii laabh or haani kaa kul sanchay karke dekha jaae to shunaya hoga
 Conversely, in the non-zero-play game, if combined with the loss and loss, it can be more or less than zero
 shunaya-sanchay khel hameshaa pratiyogi hi hota he jabaki ashoonya-sanchay khel pratiyogi yaa gair-pratiyogi ho saktaa he
 Take the example of a game in which there are two players named 'A' and 'B'
 khilaadi 'k' ko do main se ek ank kaa chunaav karnaa he - 1 yaa 2
 Player 'B' has to choose one of three colors - red, yellow or green
 in donon ke chunaavon ko dekhakar inamen se ek ko ek raashi inam main di jaati he or duusare se utani hi raashi jurmaane main lee jaati he
 The accompanying table shows what these amounts are according to the elections
 dekha ja saktaa he ki yah ek shunya-sanchay khel he kyonki isamen jitna laabh ek ko hoga utana hi nuksaan duusare ko hoga
 Similar situations are studied in game theory
 is khel main yah ho saktaa he - It can be seen that in this, both the players try very hard to understand each other's thoughts because what is a good choice for them depends on the other's choice
 is prakaar ke 'shunaya-sanchay khel' kaa hal imail borol or jon phon newman naamak ganitagyon ne prayikta ke prayog se diya tha
 Often a situation arises in the two rivals in which the habit of malice leads them to understand that if one gains something, it means that the other is losing as much
