 To facilitate the rule, the rulers of Gupta dynasty divided the empire into many Bhukti
 ye bhuktiyaan vartmaan kamishnari kii bhanti thim jinamein kai 'vishay' yaa jile hote the
 The rule of the Bhuktis was in the hands of the officers named ‘uprik’, who became more powerful when they were called ‘uprik Maharaj’
 guptottar kaal main shashan kii ikai ke rup main bhukti ke ullekh adhik nahin milte
 There are some such mentions in the Pratihara Empire but their number is not high
 parmaar, gahadwal, chandel or chalukyon ke samrajya main adhik vistrut nahin the, bhukti ke ullekh nahin miltaa
 There is mention of Bhukti due to the large empire of Palas in Bengal
 assam main bhi bhukti kaa upyog sambhavat: paalon ke saath dirghakaalin sambandh ke kaaran tha
 During the post-gupta period, a large part of the empire was under the control of the feudal lords, the union territory was not so large that it could be divided into large units like Bhukti
 rashtrakut vansh, jo ganga ke maidan ke sampark main rahaa, apane kuch abhilekhon main kuch bhuktiyon ke naam detaa he, kintu vahaan yah vishay kaa vibhaajan tha
 Which was as small as the present taluk or tehsil and usually only had 50 to 70 villages

 Similarly, the arrowhead is also used as the name of the city
 guptottar kaal main bhukti kaa upyog saamanton kii jaagir ke arth main bhi miltaa he
 This usage was based on the literal meaning of bhukti
 kai chaahmaan abhilekhon, kirtikoumudi or upamiti bhavaprapanch katha main bhukti kaa upyog is arth main he
 a specific use is found in the scriptures based on its literal meaning of Bhukti or Bhoga
 kisi sampatti par swamitva ke liye aavashyak hai - bhukti or aagam 
 For this reason, bhukti is considered to be of two types - Sagama and Anagama
 aagam or bhukti ek duusare par avlambit or sambandhit hai
 It is said to be like a thief who uses property without proceeds, but to prove ownership, more importance was given to bhakti
 sampatti kaa sthantar likhit or sakshiyukt hone par yadi bhukti rahit he to sanshayatmak rahegaa
 There have been major differences in the scriptures regarding the comparative importance of bhukti and agam and the duration of long-term bhakti, which leads to the attainment of ownership
 uttarkalin tikaaon ne in virodhon ko mitaane ko praytn kiya he
 Earlier memories have considered non-gratuity to be sufficient for ownership for 20 years, but later memories have given its time to 60 years
 praaia: teen pidiyon tak ke anadhikari bhoga ko swaamitv utpann karne main samarth kaha gaya he
 An explanation is found that within human remembrance time, bhukti is expected to be the proceeds, enjoyment of up to three generations outside the time of commemoration is sufficient

 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2795 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai

 aam taur par iske pramukh avyav chaaval, masaale, masoor daal, maans yaa subjiyan hote hai
 The term Biryani is originally derived from the Persian language, which was the official language of the court of the Mughal, Afghan, and Ottoman rulers who came from Central Asia in different parts of India in the Secondary Period
 iske bare me ek pariklpana yah bhi he ki isaki utpatti chaaval ke liye prayukt farsi shabd 'brinz' se hui he
 ek duusare vichaar ke anusaar iskaa namakaran farsi shabd "biryan" athwa "beriyan" se hua he jiskaa arth hota he bhunana athwa sekna
 Its place of origin is still uncertain
 Several types of it have developed in various cities of northern India such as Delhi, Lucknow and other small royalty houses
 In South India, where rice is a major part of eating, many distinct types of it have developed in Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 Andhra is the only state in South India in which no local type of biryani was developed
 lizzi collingham kaa kahana he ki shahi mughal baavarachi khaanon me biryani ko farsi vyanjan pilaaf or bharat ke sthaneey masaaledaar chaaval se bane vyanjanon ke ek sangam ke rup me viksit kiya gaya tha
 But there is also an idea that Biryani was popular as a dish even before Babar's arrival in India
 16 veen sadi me likhaa gaya mughal dastauez ine-e-akabari biryani or pilav me koi antar nahi paata he or iske anusaar biryani shabd bharat me pehle se hi prachlit tha
 Another similar idea that Biryani came with the invasion of Timurlung in India is also not based on facts because there is no evidence of this dish in its original place during its time

 Yazid, the ruler of the time, is believed to be wicked and cruel and used to do un-islamic work under his rule, the people of Iraq and Kufa wrote Hazrat Imam Hussein several letters and asked him to come to Kufa so that he could get the bait in his hands
 By making him their caliph, Yazid wanted Hussein to be with him, he knew that if Hussein came with him, all Islam would be in his grasp
 lakh dabaav ke baad bhi hossain ne uski kisi bhi baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya, to yajid ne hossain ko rokane kii yojana banaai
 On May 4, 680 AD, Imam Hussein left his home in Medina and reached the city of Makke, where he intended to perform Haj, but came to know that the enemies could come and disguise the Hajis
 hossain ye nahin chaahate the ki kaaba jaise pavitra sthaan par khun bahe, phir imam hossain ne haj kaa iraadaa badal diya or shahar kufe kii ore chal die
 On the way, an army of enemies surrounded them and brought them to Karbala
 imam hossain ne karbala main jis jameen par apane kheme lagaae, us jameen ko pehle imam hossain ne kharida, phir us sthaan par apane kheme lagaae
 Yazid continued to pressurize Imam Hussain through his chiefs to accept Hussain, when Imam Hussain did not obey Yajid's conditions, the enemies finally put a guard of the army on the canal and prevented Hussain from entering the camps
 Has been applied yajid kii fouj ko dekh kar kufa iraq ke log jinhone imam hossain ko bulaayaa tha apana khalipha banane ke liye unhone ne bhi saath chhod diya
 After three days passed, when the children of the Imam's family started thirsting, Husain asked for water from the Yazidi army, the enemy refused to give water, the enemies thought that Imam Husain would break with thirst and accept all our conditions
 jab hossain teen din kii pyaas ke baad bhi yajid kii baat nahin maane to dushmano ne hossain ke khemon par hamale shuru kar die
 After this, Imam Hussein asked the enemies for one night and that whole night Imam Hussein and his family prayed to Allah and prayed that my family, my friends may be martyred, but Allah’s poor 'islam', which Nana came with him, he was saved

 uske sevak mandali main mahua, mahaguru, ek tantric or aise hi kai mustande kism ke gurgon kii khep maujuud he
 Mahua used to work as a maid at home at Thakur Pratap, considered to be a justice justice
 ek shaam thakur use baku ke saath baaten karte dekh letaa he
 Knowing that Baku is a resident of the devils of the same Kali hill, Thakur immediately threatens Mahua to sack him if he meets the gang again
 baavjood, mahua, pehle kii bhaanti hi nevala ke khufia adeshon kaa paalan karti he
 At the same time, Thakur Pratap would remain depressed after having no children of his wife Lajo, despite having a lot of wealth and a happy life
 sthaneey mandir ke pujari use aashwast to karte, magar vah bhitari taur bahut kshubdh mahasoos karti jab thakur kii mausi unke ghar aati or hidaayat detii, tathaa vansh kii jarurat kaa hawala dekar, dubaara byaah rachaane ko kahati
 At the same time, Mahua promises that Lajo will have children if he goes to the black hill with him, where the mongoose can fulfill his wish, but sometimes a situation arises that if he has a son, she can take him and if he has a daughter She would be born a mongoose and would have to be handed over
 laajo pehle dafe main inkaar karti he, lekin mahua ke purajor bahekaave main aakar laajo yah sauda sweekaar kar leti he
 As a result, Lajo leaves Kali Pahadi, where she is bathed with milk and mongoose appears and hypnotizes her
 aadhi raat ko hi nevala, laajo se shaareerik sambandh banaata he
 Lajoie fully supports the mongoose by entrapping her into sexual intercourse
 savere laajo kii neend khulne par khud ko nevala saath nirvastr paati he
 Lajoie returns to the mansion, unaware that the mongoose has conceived her and as time passes Lajo gives birth to a baby girl, Kamya
 magar mahua jab use bacchee kii baat yaad dilaati he, laajo lagbhag shunya kii sthiti main pad jaati he or tab uske bacchee lekar chal nikalati he
 Mahua gives the poison to Lajo on the instructions of her master, Mongoose
 laajo tab thakur se milti he tathaa sari sachai bayaan karti he or bataati he ki vah kamya ko bachaa le jise mahua aguva kar kaali pahari le gai he
 At the same time, Lajo dies after consuming poison due to the fear of public-shame
 gusse se bifara hua, thakur kaali pahari main pravesh karata he or, ek lanbaa dwand chalata he, jisamen vah nevala kii jaadui shaktiyon ke aage nirast hota he
 Badly wounded, Weasel returns to his coffin staggering and closes the cave door and goes into sleeplessness until he recovers
 kuch bees saalon baad, kamya ek khubasurat yuvati ke rup main badi hoti he
 She gives her heart to Kumar, who is her childhood love but she does not care much about him despite his childhood fun
 kumaar sirf sapana ko chahta tha 
 Sapna was studying in a hostel in Mumbai and one day she meets a woman who asks for a lift to Kali Pahari on the night of Ous Murdani
 sapana use kaali pahari tak chhod aati he magar isse anjaan ki usase ek kitaab car main chhut gai thi
 She lives in a black magic book
 sapana vah kitaab us aurat ko lautaane peeche padati hi he par use vahaan ek vedi par vah aurat dikhaai padati he jo khud duusare pujari kism ke log bali chadhaane kii taiyaari kar rahe hote hai
 Sapna screams after seeing this scene
 bali main vyavdhaan hote dekh pujari apane aadamiyon se use pakad laane ko kehete he lekin vah bhaag khadi hachati he or vah kitaab bhi kaali pahari main chhot jaati he
 Frightened by this statement, Sapna immediately rushes to Kumar's house and tells Anand and her everything
 agle din yah teenon kaali pahari ko ravaanaa hote he, magar unako vaisaa kuch hasil nahin hota jaisaa sapana ne kaha tha
 Sapna says that she was not sleepy and then gets the book which was missing from her last night
 phir vah log kamya se milane chal padate hai jinhone in teenon ko apane janmdin par aane kaa nyauta diya tha
 The case takes an interesting turn when Kumar presents a photo of his love in front of Sapna on Kamya's birthday
 is baat se hairaan, kamya sapana kaa majaak bana detii he jisase sapana vah jagah chhod detii he
 In the meantime, Kamya comes straight to her point, but Kumar leaves her bluntly
 vahiin ghar laut rahi sapana ko vahi aurat milti he jisaki pichhali raat bali chadhaai ja rahi thi
 She asks for the same book from him and sits in Sapna's car
 sapana ghar pahunchati he or kitaab dundh nikaalati he
 This midday, Anand leaves the party in the middle and reaches his house, searching for the dream
 sapana us anjaan aurat ke bare main bataati he
 Anand throws the book out of the house and tells it to stop thinking
 kamya phir us kitaab ko lene nikalati he jahaan kumaar peeche chalaa aata he
 On reaching home, she starts reading a book which describes how Kumar was acquired through witchcraft
 jab kamya us anjaan aurat ko lift de rahi thi, uski car durghatnagrast hoti he, jahaan nevala ke giroh ke log use uthaa laate he
 Kamya is healed of her wounds by the priest's black magic and reveals that she can get everything if she joins their gang, she agrees
 kamya kabristaan main kumaar par jaadu-tone kaa abhyaas karti he
 He reaches there and makes love to her
 anand va sapana vahaan pahonchte he or kumaar ko bachaa lete hai
 Anand finds the pictures of Kumar in the cemetery and feels convinced that he has done all the work that Kamya had done when he had earlier seen Kamya meeting the unknown residents of Kali Pahadi
 ek roj kamya ko kaali pahari par raat main honevaale anushthan par bulaayaa jaataa he
 But in fact, it was a trap to trap Kamya and lead him to a mongoose, which was awakened from years of sleep
 vah kamya ko adheen karne ke liye apane dansh gadaata he or uske saath hambistari karata he
 Now she is imprisoned forever behind this closed door and becomes a mongoose's slave
 kumaar, anand or sapana sabhi log kamya ko bachaane kaali pahari kii ore kooch karte he
 Eventually they find her, she is barely conscious, she lives in a glass coffin placed in the basement of the tombs
 wo use bachaane kii koshish hi karte ki vah jagah dhuen se bhar jaati he or nevala use apahrit kar letaa he
 The tantric subjugates Kamya to his master, Mongoose
 ab kamya ko apane maalik nevala ke liye or ladakiyon kaa intjaam karnaa hota he
 She traps Bhanu in her hoof and takes him to Kali Pahadi, but Kumar, Anand and his companions stop Bhanu from becoming a victim of mongoose lust
 kamya kaa aglaa nishaanaa sapana banati he
 Sapna, too, eventually escapes at the last moment, but Kumar and Anand learn that Kamya is doing so under the control of someone else
 ve yah sari khabar thakur ko bataate hai, or tay karte hai ki ve ek saath milakar shaitan nevala kaa khaatmaa karenge
 As the black hill steps in, Thakur meets Mahua, who informs him that the devils had celebrated the birth of Kamya, and that Kamya is now completely bowed down to the powers of Mongoose
 krodh main aakar, thakur us mahua kaa sir kalam karata he
 But the mongoose is now unstoppable
 vah bhanu ko phir se bulaata he, or is baar, vah dansh gadaane main safal hota he
 Weasel arrives at Thakur's house to threaten Sapna again
 ek lambii bhaag-daud main, nevala ab bhanu or anand ko maarane baad sapana ke saamne khadaa hota he, magar ain vakt par thakur yah sab naakaam karaata he
 And then Thakur tells Kumar and Sapna about Kamya's birth secret
 phir yah teenon kamya ko dhundne kaali pahari main pravesh karte hai
 Eventually they find her, she barely regains consciousness, she lives in a glass coffin placed in the basement of the tombs
 par jald hi unako rokane vahaan tainaat giroh ke bashindon va duusare gurgon ke saath khud nevala bhi kud padataa he
 They all fight among themselves and the mongoose is wounded once again, but it is not possible to kill him in any way
 tabhi uski dusht sevika or tantric taange par nevala ko ladakar faraar hote he
 Kumar chases them, and captures the tantric, and warns him to die in order to inflame the mongoose's weakness
 tantric tab bataata he ki nevala kii aatma kaali pahari ke murti main band he or suraj kii dhoop uski kamajori he
 Kumar and Thakur now move both ways to eliminate the mongoose
 kumaar or sapana taange ko kaali pahari kii ore le chalate he, or basti waalon kii madad se nevala ke bich avrodh daalate hai
 Mongoose angrily attacks them all
 abhi vah sapana tak pahunch paata, anayas hi vah pidaa se jakad jaataa he or sholon main dadhak uthta he 
 In this way, the film ends after Kumar, Sapna and Thakur see the destruction of the mongoose forever

 mul katha ke mul rup main yathaavashyak parivartan bhi yatra-tatra kiya gaya he
 It seems that the popularity of this mythology has made it a folklore since ancient times
 is kaaran kavi ne vahaan se bhi kuch tatv liye
 This epic is Adyanta Shringari
 poorvarag, virah, hans kaa dootkarm, swayambar, nal-damayanti-vivaah, danpati kaa pratham samagam or ashtaamcharya tathaa sanyogvilas kii khandakaviya kathavstu ko kavi ke varnancharitron or kalpanajanya vaidushyavilas ne atyat vrihadaakaar bana diya he
 Shringarparikar's paintings have also added to that expansion
 apni kalpana kii udaan ke bal se pandit kavi dwaara ek hi chitra ko nai nai aprastut yojanaon dwaara anek roopon main vistaar ke saath rakhaa gaya he
 It seems that the poet's wisdom does not get tired of assessing a presentation one after another by the unprepared
 prakrutijagat ke swabhaavektipath rupachitrankan, upama, roopak, utpreksha atishyokti, vyatirek, shlesh aadi arthalankaron kii samarthyojna, anuprasyamak, shabdashlesh, shabdachitradi chamatkaaron kaa sadhikaar prayog or shabdkosh ke viniyog prayog kii adbhut kshamta, shastreey pakshon kaa maarmik, praudh or samichin niyojan, kalpanaaon or bhavchitron kaa samuchit niveshan, pratham-samagam-kaaleen mugdhanavvadhoo kii man:sthiti, lajja or uthkanthaa kaa sajiv ankan, alankaran or chamatkaar kii alankrita kavyastylee kaa anayas udbhaavan or apane padlaalitya aadi ke kaaran is kavy kaa sanskrit kii panditmandli main aaj tak nirantar abhootpurv samaadar hota chalaa aa rahaa he
 More than the Magh poet, Shri Harsha has greatly increased it with the addition of poetic performance of poetry, which has greatly increased the poetry of the short story
 shringaari vilaason or mukhyat: sanyog keliyon ke kushalshilpi or rasik nagaron kii vilasavritiyon ke ankan main aasanjansheel hokar bhi kavi ke darshanik vaidushya ke kaaran kavy main sthaan sthaan par rukshata bad gai
 Many defects like repetition, disunity, etc
 can also be found here

 It has adult classicalism and Kalpannamohar grandeur

 Both the expansion of the speech and the meaning of the speech are incompatible, the restrained and abstract speech is eloquence

 inkaa janm saare pradesh ke ek aise kuleen parivaar main hua tha jiske vanshaj dirghakaal se england ke nareshon tathaa vidhaan ke sabal samarthak rahe
 According to this lineage of royalism, the young Evelyn had to leave Oxford University and jump for the victory of Charles i in 1642 in the fiery fire of fierce civil war
 parantu varsh ke antim charan main unhone swadesh chhodkar holland ko prasthaan kiya
 For many years, he toured various countries of Europe and used the experiences available from this trip to his famous 'diary' in situ

 In 1652 AD, he returned home and settled permanently in a place called Sage Court

 tak grinich hospital ke koshadhyaksh bhi rahe
 John Evelyn was a close friend of the famous diarist Samuel Pepps, but his nature and character was very different from that of the Pepps Madame
 inke vyaktitv main utkar rajbhakti, vishuddh dharmikata tathaa vivekshil darshaniktaa kaa sukhad sammishran tha
 Even during the reign of Charles II, when immorality prevailed and Kamini and Sura's bhogalipsa often became contagious disease, Evelyn sir kept herself ill

 His diary does not contain the juices and colors conveyed by the successful writings of Samuel Pepps, but contains vivid illustrations of various aspects of a stormy era in England
 'diary' main unke mahan vyaktitv ke saath hi prakand paanditya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 Like Peps sir, he has not left his experiences as exhaustive, but has confused one part with another like a skilled artist

 Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar was a scholar, historical historian and social reformer of India

 Bhandarkar, prominent among the early disciples of Dadabhai Naorozi, based his authentic works, writings and pamphlets on the basis of authentic arguments pointing to the peculiarities of Hinduism and its philosophy, unaffected by the aura of Western thinkers
 unhone unnisvin sadi ke madhya bhartiya paridrishy main uth rahe punarutthanavaadee soch ko ek sthir or majboot zamin pradaan kii
 Although Bhandarkar was not opposed to the British, he was rich in nationalist consciousness
 ve aise pratham swadeshi itihaaskaar the jinhone bhartiya sabhyataa par videshi prabhaavon ke siddhant kaa purazor or taarkik virodh kiya
 Due to his rational and objective approach and the investigativeness of the gathering of new sources, Bhandarkar reconstructed the history of the Vaishnavas and other sects to the south of the Satavahanas

 After completing his schooling from Ratnagiri in 1853, Bhandarkar attended the Elphinstone College in Mumbai, where he was educated by eminent personalities, Dadabhai Naorozi, the first nationalist thinker and exponent of 'drain Theory'
 dadabhai naurozi ke protsaahan ke kaaran hi angrezi sahitya, prakritik vigyaan or ganit ke prati ruchi ke baavjood bhandarkar ne sanskrit or pali ke gyaan ke sahare gauravshaalee ateet ke punarnirmaan hetu itihaas-lekhan ko apanaaya

 Despite the socially conservative atmosphere, Bhandarkar administered university education to his daughters and granddaughters and did not marry them until he attained maturity to choose a life partner of his choice
 unhone apni vidhwaa putree ke punarvivaah ke liye bhi anumati di
 He died on 24 August 1925

 Thus, interest of Indians towards authentic knowledge of history increased

 Therefore, this task was entrusted to Dr
 Bhandarkar and he completed his work in five huge texts
 puraatatv ke itihaaskaaron ke liye ye granth maardarshak hai
 In 1883, he was invited to the Conference of Oriental Language Scholars in Vienna and the government and foreigners were shocked by the seriousness and investigative style of their studies there

 In 1872, James Varghese started a research journal called Indian Endtiquery to share the research findings of orientalist scholars on one platform
 isi ke saath bhandarkar kii bauddhikta bhi paravaan chadhi
 Bhandarkar was one of those who were considered reliable to handle the responsibility of this research journal
 unhone apni bhoomika nibhaane main koi kotahi bhi nahin barti
 Apart from Indian andquetry, the research journals and organizations that caught his attention were the Mumbai branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, founded in 1804 by James Mackintosh
 bhandarkar ke saath ke
 T
 Telang was among the third generation members of this society
 indian andtaqueri se shuru hui bauddhik yatra kii shuruyaat main bhandarkar 1872 se 1874 ke bich berlin ke profesar webar se uljhe
 He had a spirited logical and controversial debate with him on the issues of Patanjali's period and Patanjali's great language
 ‘patanjali kaa kaal’ lekh main bhandarkar ne webar ke nishkarshon ke ulat safaltaapurvak siddh kiya ki patanjali ke mahabhashya kii rachana isa purv duusari shatabdi ke madhya kii gayi thi
 Later Goldstucker also reached a similar decision for other reasons
 1873 main hi bhandarkar ne jarnal of mumbai branch of royal aciatic socity ke ek lekh dwaara karnal elice ke drushtikon main sudhaar kiya
 In another article, Bhandarkar disagreed with Goldstucker and Weber on the question of Patanjali and Katyayan's original residence
 webar kii is manyata ke vipareet ki patanjali patliputra se bhi purvi kshetra ke the, bhandarkar ne unhen pashchimi avadh ke kisi uttar- pashchimi sthaan kaa mul nivasee mana
 He proved Katyayan to be a native of the south
 indian andtaqueri ke 1874 ke ek lekh ‘patanjali mahabhashya main krishna ke sanket’ main bhandarkar mahabhashya ke kai uddharanon, shabdon kii nirmiti or unke mul ke bare main vistrut vyakhya ke zariye is prastaavna par pahunche ki jaise hindu kaal main samakaleen prachlit sthapanaayen / manyataayen naatakeey rup se puranic kaal kii hai, usee tarah krishna athwa vasudev dwaara kansa kaa vadh or bali kii adheenta sambandhi kahaniyaan patanjali ke kaal main lokapriy or charchit thim
 For this reason, the period of Mahabharata was much earlier like Patanjali's period, not the sixteenth century according to Colonel Ellis
 1974 main hi indian andtaqueri ke may ank main ‘vedaz in india’ sheershak ek lambe aalekh main spasht or sargarbhit dhang se bhandarkar ne bataaya ki kaise vaidic paath karne vaale brahman pariwaron dwaara vedon ke adhyayan se sanskrit shiksha kii paripati shuru kii gayi
 At the same time, the fame of being the best scholar of Indian culture invited Bhandarkar to attend the International Conference of Orientalists in London in 1874
 bhandarkar sammelan main nahin gayi par unhone satvaahan kaal ke raajaaon or unke udgam par prakaash daalane vaala lekh vahaan bheja
 This article was published in Transactions of Oriental Congress, 1874
 isane bhandarkar kii vidvatta kii saakh or badhaai
 He was made a member of the Royal Asiatic Society the following year, rating him as an internationally established scholar
 jab 1876 main wilson philologi lekcharship shrunkhlaa kii shuruyaat hui to uskaa pehla vyaakhyaan ramakrishna gopal bhandarkar ne hi diya
 Bhandarkar strengthened the establishment of philological science by the well-connected and educational use of Sanskrit and Pali
 1876 main unhone ek sanskrit naatak malti madhav kaa prakaashan karaayaa
 Later in 1886, he also attended the International Conference of Orientalists held in Vienna
 raajnneetik itihaas par bhandarkar ne do prabandh 'da arli history of da deccan' or 'a pip intu da arli history of india' likhe
 Bhandarkar considered 'the Early History of the Deccan' to be merely a compilation of facts
 is rachana main unhone pracheenatam kaal se musalamaanon kii vijay tak pashchimi bharat kaa aitihaasik vivaran prastut kiya he jisase raajnneetik itihaas ke saath aalochaykaal ke dauraan dakkan kii saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik, sahitya or kala kii sthiti par roshni padati he
 In the second book, Bhandarkar details the beginning of the Mauryan period to the closing phase of the Gupta empire when the Brahminical ideology under the Guptas resurfaced and whose expression is reflected in the Gupta period religion, art and literature
 1913 main bhandarkar ne apni sarvshereshth aitihaasik kriti 'vaishnavism, shaivizam and da miner relijas sects' likhi jo apni takneekee sanrachana ke baavjood aaj bhi guptakaleen dharmik aasthaaon main hone vaale parivartan ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn zariyaa he
 The tradition that Bhandarkar started as the 'encyclopaedia of indo-aryan Research' was later followed by G
, Bhullar and F
F
 Kilham pushed forward
 'di critical, koaparative and historical methd of inquayri' sheershak shodhpatr main bhandarkar ne dikhaaya he ki kaise anusandhan paddati main vibhinn sroton kii gahari chaanbin karke aitihaasik satya or sateek varnanaatmakataa kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 Determining the limits of this method, he discouraged the historian's tendency to cross-examine as a lawyer and emphasized the harsh impartiality of a judge
 unki drushti main vidwaan kaa lakshya shushk satya kaa sandhan hona chahie, saath hi use uplabdh saakshyon kii vishwasaneeyata nirdhaarit karne kaa harasambhav prayaas karnaa chahie
 Bhandarkar recommended to limit the discovery of a piece of historical truth in Janashruti to post-trial through research method, only as an opportunity
 ve maanate the ki itihaas kaa varnan usee rup main hona chahie jaisaa vah vastutah tha
 Aware of his social role, Bhandarkar proved that the study of ancient texts did not inspire modern reforms, instead modern reforms inspired the study of ancient texts
 badale main sudhaarkon ko in grathon se ek aisi jubaan mili jisase ve janata se baatcheet kar saken
 That is, the original inspiration for reform came out of the modern way of life and then the revival of ancient values by the reformers made it easy for those reforms to move forward
 vidhyaarthee jivan se hi bhandarkar saamaajik or dharmik sudhaarwadi kaaryakramon se sakriy rup se jud gayi the
 Secretly active against the orthodox caste system of the then society, Paramhans were active in the assembly since 1853
 1867 main keshavachandra sen ke mumbai aagaman ke pashchaat kolkata ke brahm samaaj ke tarz par mumbai main prarthana samaaj kii sthapana hui jisase bhandarkar 1869 main jud gayi
 While contradicting the pre-beliefs guided by Christian philosophy in this institution, he proved that the Indian society and philosophy have influenced European thought, while describing the prayer society as sophisticated Hinduism
 unhone chetaya ki hindu dharm or bhartiya sabhyataa ke prati kisi tarah kii avhelnaa vishadpurn parinaamon ko janm degi
 Addressing a conference of the Dalit class in 1912, advocating women education and widow marriage, with quotes extracted from their Sanskrit and Pali texts, rebuffed child marriage and called for Hindus to eradicate untouchability
 udaahranon ke madhyam se unhone samajhaayaa ki ise utpeedit virgon par meharbaani kii tarah nahin balki samaaj ko tikaaye rakhane kii aavashyaktaa ke taur par sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Bhandarkar's admirers and intellectual followers, with the support of Sir Ratan Tata and Sir Dorabji Tata, established the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune with the help of the Mumbai administration which was inaugurated in July 1917 by Lord Willingdon, Governor of Mumbai
 1919 main yahan aal-india conferes of oriental scolers naam se praachyavaadiyon kaa pratham akhil bhartiya adhiveshan yojit hua

 The cargo insurance discussed here is a sub-branch of marine insurance, although the basic and offshore exposed property in marine insurance; Ship's structure; Marine accident; And maritime liability
 samudri beemaa sabase pehali suviksit beemaa thi jisaki shuruyaat greek or roman samudri rin se hui thi
 Separate maritime insurance contracts were developed in the fourteenth century in Genoa and other Italian cities and expanded into northern Europe
 mausam evam daakuon se hone vaale parivartaneey jokhim ke sahaj anumaanon ke aadhaar par iske premiyamon main vibhinnata thi
 The modern origins of maritime insurance law in English law were in merchant law, which was established in 1601 in England by a special chamber of assurance distinct from other courts
 atharahavin sadi ke madhya main lord mansfield naamak lord chif justise ne vyapaaree kanoon or saamaanya kaanoon ke siddhanton ko aapas main milaanaa shuru kar diya
 The founding of Lloyds of London, a developing infrastructure of competitive insurance companies, experts, and the development of the British Empire gave English law a prominence in the field which it maintains extensively and forms the basis of almost all modern practices
 
 landan beemaa bazaar ke vikaas ke falswaroop policiyon or nyaayik misaalon kaa maanakeekaran hua jisase aage chalakar samudri beemaa kaanoon kaa vikaas hua
 The Maritime Insurance Act was passed in 1906 which codified the previous general law; It is both a very endearing and brief work
 haalanki adhinium kaa sheershak samudri beemaa ko sanderbhit karata he, lekin sabhi gaiyr-jivan beemaa main saamaanya siddhant lagu kiye gaye hai
 In the 19th century, Lloyds and the Institute of London Underwriters developed standardized clauses for the use of marine insurance in mutual understanding and have since been maintained
 inhen institute clockez ke naam se janaa jaataa he kyonki institute unke prakaashan kii laagat kii bharpai karata tha
 Within the overall guidelines of the Maritime Insurance Act and the Institute Clauses, various parties maintain adequate contractual independence in their midst
 samudri beemaa sabase puraane tarah kii beemaa he
 Non-marine insurance and reinsurance evolved from this
 isane paramparaagat dhang se lloyds main antarlikhit adhikansh vyavsaay kaa gathan kiya
 Nowadays, marine insurance is often grouped with aviation and transportation risks and as such it is known by the acronym 'MAT'
 samudri beemaa adhinium main ek anusuchee ke rup main ek maanak policy ke rup main gyaat) shaamil he, yadi partiyaan chahen to unhen iskaa istemaal karne kii swatantraaa thi
 Since each period of the policy had been tested for at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was completely down to date
 haalanki, ise apekshaakrit puraane shabdon main bhi vyakt kiya gaya tha
 In 1991, London Bazaar introduced the disclosure of a new standard policy known as MAR 91 Form and used the Institute Clauses
 emr form bas beemaa kaa ek saamaanya bayaan he; institute clockez kaa istemaal beemaa cover ke vistaar ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the policy document typically includes a MAR form used as a cover and staples within the clauses
 aam taur par prayek close par muhar lagi hogi or saath main yah muhar cover ke bheetar or anya clozon donon par lagi hoti he; clozon ke pratisthaapan yaa nishkasana se bachane ke liye is abhyaas kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Since maritime insurance is usually interwoven on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: we, the underwriter, agree to bind ourselves for our own part and not for anyone else's
 In legal cases, the liabilities under the policy are multiple, not joint; Ie All underwriters are liable together, but only for part or proportion of their risk
 yadi ek graahak se chook hoti he to shesh apane daawey ke hisse ko lene ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hote hai
 Typically, maritime insurance is divided between ships and cargo
 jahaazon kii beemaa ko aam taur par 'hal and mashinari' ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 a more limited form of cover is 'total loss only', which is generally used as a reinsurance, covering only the entire damage of the ship, not any partial damage
 yaa to 'yatra' yaa 'samay' ke aadhaar par cover diya ja saktaa he
 On a 'travel' basis, the policy includes transportation between scheduled ports; a time period, usually one year, based on 'time' is included and is more common
 ek samudri policy main aam taur par tisare pakshon ke prati bimaakrit vyakti yaa vastu kii dendariyon kii keval teen timahi shaamil hoti thi
 Specific liabilities arise in the context of a collision with another ship, known as a 'collision' and debris removal

 These clubs still exist today and have become a model for other specific and non-commercial marine and non-marine mutual facts, for example in relation to oil pollution and nuclear risk
 ye club ek jahaaj ke maalik ko ek sadsy ke rup main sweekaar karne kii sahmati evam ek aarambhik 'kol' kii ugaahi ke aadhaar par kaary karte hai
 With accumulated funds, reinsurance will be purchased; However, one or more 'supplementary calls' may be made if the loss experience is adverse
 ye club aam taur par arakshit nidhi ke nirmaan kaa bhi prayaas karte hai, lekin yah unhen unki aapasi sthiti ke saath kathinaayee main daal detaa he
 As the methods of liability vary around the world, insurance companies generally take precautions to limit or eliminate the liability of the American Jones Act
 in do shabdon kaa istemaal saboot ke str main antar sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jahaan ek jahaaj yaa cargo kii haani hui ho
 a true total loss refers to a situation where the condition is apparent and a constructive total loss refers to a situation where a loss has been proved
 abhyaas main, ek rachanaatmak kul haani kaa istemaal ek aisi haani kaa varnan karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he jahaan marammat kii laagat kifayati nahin hoti he; arthath ek 'ghaataa'
 Various terms refer to the difficulties of proving a loss where there may be no evidence of such a loss
 is sambandh main, samudri beemaa gaiyr-samudri beemaa se alag he, jahaan bimaakrit vyakti yaa vastu ko apni haani ko sabit karnaa padataa he
 Traditionally, by law, maritime insurance was seen as an insurance of 'courage' and together with an interest in the financial consequences of the existence of the insured person or goods in the ship and / or cargo rather than just an interest
 There was a share and an interest
 shabd 'everej' ke do arth hai: In marine insurance, the average can be declared in case of partial loss, or in case of emergency repairs to the ship
 isamen aisi paristhitiyaan shaamil hai jahaan, udhaaharan ke liye, ek toofaan main fansaa jahaaj jahaaj or shesh cargo kii raksha ke liye kuch cargo ko phenkna pad saktaa he
 In order to compensate for the losses of those for 'normal average' all parties related to the enterprise have to contribute to this compensation for those who have lost or lost cargo
 'vishesh everej' keval cargo maalikon ke ek samooh par, na ki sabhi cargo maalikon par, lagaaya jaataa he
 In the case where an insured person or item is inter-insured, that is, less than the value of the item insured, the average will be applied to reduce the amount due
 There are different ways of calculating the average, but generally a similar proportion of inter-insurance will be applied for any remaining payment
 ek everej samyojak ek samudri daawa visheshgy hota he jo saamaanya everej bayaan ko samyojit karne or use pradaan karne ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 He is usually appointed by the shipowner or the insurer
 ek atirikt raashi bimaakrit vyakti kii dey raashi he or ise aam taur par haani kii sthiti main ek ceiling tak shesh rup main aane vaali pehali raashi ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 An additional amount may or may not be applied
 ise yaa to maudrik yaa pratishat sharton main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 An additional amount is typically used to alleviate moral distress and to remove minor medications, which are disproportionately expensive to handle
 samudri beemaa main 'atirikt' kaa samakaksh shabd 'katauteeyogy' yaa 'pratidhaaran' he
 a co-insurance commonly applied in a non-proportionate treaty reinsurance, is an excess expressed as a claim ratio, eg 5%, which is applied to the entire claim
 ek frenchise ek katauteeyogy raashi he jiske neeche kuch bhi dey nahin he or jiske upar bimit rakam kii puri raashi dey he
 It is commonly used in reinsurance arbitrage agreements

 They continued to be used in the 1970s before being banned by the main market called Lloyds, until that time, they were nothing more than raw bets

 The policy paid off when the loss was reached or exceeded
 ek 'chinamen' ne isi siddhant ko lekin vipareet rup main lagu kiya: is tarah, seemaa tak nahin pahunchane par bhugtan kar diya jaataa tha
 a variety of specialist policies exist, including: links:cover kaa vivaran: Institute Cargo Clauses: platercraft evam commercial marine policy saransh: a special feature of marine insurance and insurance law generally, is the use of the terms and warranty terms
 angrezi kaanoon main, ek shart aam taur par anubandh ke hisse kaa varnan karata he jo us anubandh ke pradarshan kaa moulik bhaag he or, yadi iskaa ulanghan kiya gaya, to gaiyr-ulanghankaree party ko keval kshati kaa daawa hi nahin, balki is aadhaar par us anubandh ko bhi samaapt karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he ki ulanghan karne vaale party ne iskaa parityag kar diya he
 In contrast, a warranty is not a fundamental part of the performance of the contract and breach of a warranty, while promoting a claim for damages, does not give the infringing party the right to terminate the contract
 beemaa kaanoon main in shabdon ke ulte arth hai
 Thus, the Maritime Insurance Act 1906 refers to the applicable warranty which is one of the most important of them that the ship is seaworthy
 'nistaaran' shabd ek sankatagrast jahaaj ko die jane sahaayta ke abhyaas ko sanderbhit karata he
 Apart from the idea that the sea is traditionally a 'place of safety' and the sailor is reputed to provide assistance as needed, it is clearly in the interest of the Hamidars to help prevent a threatened ship from being destroyed
 Provide incentives
 ek policy main aam taur par ek 'mukadmaa evam shram' close shaamil hota he jo bahut bade nuksaan se apane aapako bachaane ke liye jahaaj ke maalik dwaara kharch kiye gaye uchit laagat kii bharpai karegaa
 At sea, the confluent ship will generally agree to 'lloyds open form' with any potential salver
 lloyds open form ek maanak anubandh he, haalanki iske anya rup bhi maujuud hai
 The Lloyds open form is titled 'no Cure - No Pay'; It is intended that if the disposal effort fails then no prize will be given
 However, this theory has weakened in recent years and awards are now given in cases where, although the ship may have sunk, pollution is avoided or minimized
 anya paristhitiyon main, "sailver" scopy shabdon kaa aahvaan kar saktaa he, lopha ke vipareet, in shabdon kaa matlab he ki sailver ko tab bhi bhugtan kiya jayega yadi nistaaran asafal hota he
 The amount a salver receives is limited only to compensate for the cost of the disposal effort
 scopy ke aahvaan main mukhya nakaaratmak karkon main se ek kaarak yah he ki yadi nistaaran prayaas safal hota he to jis rakam par sailver lopha ke anuchhed 13 ke tahat daawa kar saktaa he us rakam ko chhot de di jaati he
 Once agreed, Lloyds allows open-form disposal efforts to begin immediately
 kisi bhi puraskaar kii had ko baad main nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he; haalanki maanak shabd kisi bhi puraskaar kaa nirnay karne vaale lloyds ke chairman ko sanderbhit karata he, abhyaas main nirnayakarta kii bhoomika visheshgy ksha ko loyad kii, main he kisi bhi puraskaar ke liye paarit visheshgy kusi ke liye paarit kiya gaya he
 a ship caught in battle is referred to as a bounty and is entitled to the reward money to hold or capture it

 The most important sections of this act include: adhinium kii anusuchee 1 main paribhaashaon kii ek suchi shaamil he; anusuchee 2 main model policy ke shabd shaamil hai

 The Romans first welcomed and supported Nero because he was a descendant of Emperor Augustus not only from the ancestral tradition but also from the maternal tradition
 shuru main usne apane guru seneka se prabhavit hokar rajya kaa shashan bhi acchhee tarah se kiya kintu sheeghra hi uske durgun prakat hone lage
 In the year 55, he poisoned his rival Britannicus, who was the real claimant of the kingdom, with Claudiuska being his son, and four years later killed his mother himself
 phir usne ani patni octavia ko bhi marava daalaa or apni duusari stri paapiya ko krodhavisht hokar maar daalaa
 He wished to marry a third woman, but she refused and was also put to death
 iske baad nero ne ek or stri ke pati ko marava daalaa taaki vah use apni patni bana sake
 Gradually, resentment started growing towards him
 ek shadyantra kaa suraag paakar usne apane guru seneka ko aatmahatya karne kaa aadesh diya
 Apart from this, many other famous men were executed

 When the fire was burning with fire, Nero was standing at one place and watching his destruction and playing the violin
 yadhyapi kuch logon kaa khyaal he ki aag swayan nero ne lagavai thi par aisa samajhane ke liye vastut: koi aadhaar nahin he
 After the fire was extinguished, Nero took up the task of renovating the city and built a grand palace named 'golden Temple' for himself

 Prithviraj Raso is an epic written in Hindi language describing the life and character of Prithviraj Chauhan
 iske rachayita raav chand bardaai bhatta jo chandisa raav ke kaladi gautra se the va prithviraj ke bachapan ke mitra or unke raajakavi the or unki yuddh yatraaon ke samay vir ras kii kavitaaon se sena ko protsaahit bhi karte the
 Between 1165 and 1192 when Prithviraj Chauhan's kingdom extended from Ajmer to Delhi
 prithvirajraso dhai hajaar prishthon kaa bahut bada granth he jisamen 69 samay hai
 Almost all the verses practiced in ancient times have been treated in it
 mukhya chand hai - kavitt, duha, tomars, trotak, gaha or aryaa
 Just as it is famous with respect to Kadambari that the previous part of it has been completed by the son of Baan Bhatt, similarly the previous part of Raso has also been completed by Chand's son Jalahan
 raso ke anusaar jab shahabuddin gori prithviraj ko kaid karke gazani le gaya, tab kuch dinon peeche chand bhi vahiin gaye
 While leaving, the poet gave the book of Raso in the hands of his son Jalahan and indicated to complete it
 jalhan ke haath main raso ko saunpe jane or uske puure kiye jane kaa ullekh raso main he - Many scholars doubt Prithvirajasso's contemporary poetry as being written in the 16th century, due to the disproportion of the texts given in Raso with historical facts in many places
 is rachana kii sabase puraani prati bikaner ke rajkeey pustkaalay me mili he kul 3 pratiyaan he
 At the end of the composition Prithviraj has also talked about killing Gauri by running a piercing arrow
 prithvirajraso raasak parampara kaa ek kavy he
 As its name suggests, a Hindi treatise written about the events of the life of Prithviraj, the last Hindu emperor of Delhi, is believed to be written by Rao Chandravadai Bhatt
 pehle is kavy ke ek hi rup se hindi jagat parichit tha, jo sanyog se rachana kaa sabase adhik vishaal rup tha isamen lagbhag gyaarah hajaar roopak aate the
 After that a smaller version of the composition was found in some copies, which had about three and a half thousand metaphors
 uske bhi baad ek rup kuch pratiyon main praapt hua jisamen kul rupaksankhya baarah sau se adhik nahin thi
 Subsequently, two copies were also received which had only four hundred and five and a half hundred metaphors respectively
 ye sabhi pratiyaan rachana ke vibhinn purna rup prastut karti thim
 Copies of some volumes of the composition have also been received, which are related to the first two forms mentioned above
 at: swabhaavat: yah vivaad uthaa ki uparyukt vibhinn purna roopon kaa vikaas kis prakaar hua
 Some scholars differed completely from this
 unhone kaha ki sabase bada rup hi rachana kaa mul rup rahaa hoga or usee se uttarottar adhikadhik chote rup sankshepon ke rup main banaakar prastut kiye gaye honge
 He gave the proof that no form of creation, even the smallest form, is free from antiquity
 kintu is vivaad ko phir yaheen par chhod diya gaya or isko hal karne kaa koi prayaas bahut dinon tak nahin kiya gaya
 Its first notable attempt was in 1955
 jab ek vidwaan ne prithviraj raso ke teen paathon kaa aakaar sambandh sheershak lekh likar yah dikhaaya ki prithviraj or uske vipaksh ke balaabal ko suchit karanevaali jo sankhyaayein rachana ke teen vibhinn paathon : sabase bade, usase chote or usase bhi chote main milti hai unamem samanta nahin he or yadi samgr rup se dekha jaay to in sankhyaon ke sambandh main atyukti kii maatra bhi uparyukt kram main hi uttarottar kam milti he
 If these texts had developed in the order of the greater medium, there would have been no difference in the numerical numbers due to the abbreviated verb
 isaliye yah prakat he ki praapt roopon ke vikaas kaa kram laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat he
 From the point of view of management, if we pay attention to the rhyme series and rhyme chains and context series, we will also see that these series are progressively broken in the shortest order of the shortest order and are kept in between by more and more verses and context trajectories
 kintu rachana kaa praapt sabase chota rup bhi in shrinkhalatrutiyon se sarvatha mukt nahin he, isaliye spasht gyaat hota he ki 'raso' kaa mul rup praapt laghutam rup se bhi chota rahaa hoga
 The story of 'prithvirajasso' is summarized as follows: At the time when Prithviraj was on the throne of Delhi, King Jayachand of Kannauj decided to perform a Rajasuya Yajna and on this occasion he also resolved to perform the swayamvara of his daughter Samyukrita
 rajasuya kaa nimantran usne dur dur tak ke raajaaon ko bheja or prithviraj ko bhi usamen sammilit hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Prithviraj and his feudatories were persuaded that, despite the verses, some other Rajasuya would perform a yagna and Prithviraj declined Jayachand's invitation
 jayachand ne phir bhi rajasuya yajna karnaa thaanakar yagyamandap ke dwaar par dwarpal ke rup main prithviraj kii ek pratimaa sthapit kar di
 Prithviraj was naturally angry at this incident as an insult
 isi bich use yah bhi samachar mila ki jayachand kii kanya sanyogita ne pita ke vachanon kii upeksha kar prithviraj ko hi pati rup main varan karne kaa sankalp kiya he or jayachand ne isapar cruddh hokar use alag gangatatavarti ek awaas main bhijwa diya he
 Satisfied with these news, he was somehow spending his time outside the capital in the game that his minister Kavas, taking advantage of his absence, had an inappropriate relationship with one of his Karnati maids and one day entered his chamber at night
 pattarai ko jab yah baat gyaat hui, usne prithviraj ko tatkaal bulavaa bheja or prithviraj raat ko hi do ghadiyon main rajbhavan main aa gaya
 When he was shown to Kavas in the said maid's chamber, he aimed them in the dark of night and released the arrows
 pehla baan to chook gaya kintu duusare baan ke lagate hi kainvas dharashayi ho gaya
 At night, Prithviraj went to the game after getting both of them buried in a pit, then returned to the capital the next day
 kainvas kii stri ne chand se apane mrit pati kaa shav dilaane kii prarthana kii to chand ne prithviraj se yah nivedan kiya
 Prithviraj accepted Chand's request on the condition that he would take Kannauj with him
 donon mitra kasakar gale milte ore roe
 Prithviraj said that it was good to die from this humiliating life and his poet approved this sentiment
 kainvas kaa shav lekar uski vidhwaa sati ho gai
 Prithviraj traveled to Kannauj in the remainder of Thawaitt with Chand
 saath main sau vir rajput saamanton sainikon ko bhi usne le liya
 After reaching Kannauj, he went to the court of Jaichand
 jayachand ne uskaa bahut satkar kiya or usase prithviraj ke vay, rup aadi ke sambandh main poocha
 Chand gave some description of him, Jaichand was shocked by seeing his follower Thawaitt
 shankaanivaranarth usne kavi ko paan arpit karaane ke bahaane anya daasiyon ke saath ek daasi ko bulaayaa jo pehle prithviraj kii seva main rah chuki thi
 He covered Prithviraj on seeing Thwaitt in disguise
 kintu kisi ne kaha ki chand prithviraj kaa abhinn sakha tha isaliye daasi ne use dekh sir dhank liya or baat vahiin par samaapt ho gai
 But on the next morning, when Jaichand went to meet Chand at his camp, Thawitt was seated on the throne and was again suspicious
 chand ne bahaane karke uski shankaa kaa nivaaran karnaa chaha or thawitt se use paan arpit karne kaa kaha
 The whirlwind Vrithi Prithviraj threw while drinking, convinced Jaichand that he was Prithviraj himself and took orders to confront Prithviraj
 idhar prithviraj nagar kii parikrama ke liye niklaa
 As he was sucking pearls to the fishes in the Ganges, Sanyogita sent a maid to identify her properly and make her love when she was Prithviraj
 daasi ne jab yah nishchay kar liya ki vah prithviraj hi he, usne sanyogita kaa pranaynivedan kiya
 Prithviraj met Sankrita later and both of them entered the Gangesathar residence
 us samay vah vahaan se chalaa aayaa kintu apane saamanton ke kehane par vah pun: jaanakar sanyogita kaa saath liva laayaa
 When he kidnapped this type of Sanyogita, Chand defiantly told Jaichand that his enemy Prithviraj was now asking for war in the form of mercy by announcing his daughter
 parinamat: donon pakshon main sangharsh prarambh ho gaya
 In a two-day war when many of Prithviraj's warriors were killed, the feudals advised him to change the mode of war
 unhone sujhaayaa ki vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli kii ore bade or ve jayachand kii sena ko dilli ke maarg main aage badhane se rokte rahen jab tak vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli na pahunch jaae
 Prithviraj accepted this and the sacrifice of many feudal and heroic warriors went to Delhi with endless coincidence
 jayachand apni sena ke saath kannauj laut gaya
 Arriving in Delhi, Prithviraj, along with Sanyogita, became delirious
 chah maheene tak awaas se baahar niklaa hi nahin, jiske parinamswaroop uske guru, bandhav, bhaty tathaa lok main uske prati asantosh utpann ho gaya
 When the subjects requested the Rajguru to suffer, Rajguru went to Sanyogita's residence with Chand
 donon ne milakar prithviraj ko gori ke akraman kii soochika patrika bheji or sandeshvahika daasi se kahala bheja : 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anuratt
 'the king's luxury sleep was disturbed and he left for battle by chance
 shahabuddin is baar badi baari sena lekar aayaa hua tha
 Many of Prithviraj's brave warriors and feudal Kannos were killed in the war itself
 parinamat: prithviraj kii sena rankshetra se laut padi or shahbuddin vijayi hua
 Prithviraj was imprisoned and taken to Ghazni
 vahaan par kuch dinon baad shahabuddin ne uski ankhen nikalava leen
 When news of the sufferings of Chand Prithviraj came, that Ghajini went under the control of Avadhoot for the salvation of his friend and master
 vah shahabuddin se mila
 On asking the reason for going there, he told that now he wanted to go to Badarikashram and do penance, but one sadness was remaining in his life, so he had not yet gone there
 usne prithviraj ke saath janm grahan kiya tha or ve bachapan main saath saath hi khele koode the
 At the same time, Prithviraj told him that he could pierce seven gongs at once with the help of Singini without any fruit
 uskaa yah kaushal vah nahin dekh sakaa tha or ab dekhakar apni vah saadh puri karnaa chahta tha
 Ghori said that he has been blinded
 chand ne kaha ki vah phir bhi vaisaa sandhanakaushal dikhaa saktaa he, use yah vishwaas tha
 Shahabuddin accepted this demand and got all the arrangements made
 chand ke protsaahit karne par jivan se niraash prithviraj ne bhi apana sanghan kaushal dikhaane ke bahaane shatru ke vadh karne kaa uskaa aagrah sweekaar kar liya
 With approval from Prithviraj, Chand went to Shahabuddin and said that he was ready to do the goal only if he himself called for Lakshwadeh with his mouth three times
 shahabuddin ne ise bhi sweekaar kar liya1 shah ne do farmaan die, phir teesraa usne jyon hi diya prithviraj ke baan se viddh hokar vah dharashayi hua
 Prithviraj also came to an end
 devataaon ne us par pushpavrishti kii or prithvi ne mlechha gori se traan paakar harsh prakat kiya
 Here the story of 'prithvirajasso' ends
 'raso' kii aitihaasikta ko lekar, vishesh rup se jab se prasiddh vidvan or puraatatvajna vular ko 'prithviraj vijay' naamak sanskrit kavy kii khandit prati mili, bada vivaad chalaa he
 This dispute has been raised about its larger text, but it is not even the shortest text of the composition that is completely free from antiquity
 udaahranarth jayachand ke dwaara daahal ke karn ko do baar parajeet or bandi kiye jane kaa ullekh miltaa he, kintu vah jayachand se lagbhag sava sau varsh purv hua tha
 No definite historical support has yet been received in connection with the battle of Prithviraj said to Jaichand
 prithviraj ajmer kaa shaasha tha; dilli kaa shaasha koi govindaray yaa khanderay tha jo prithviraj kii ore se donon yudhon se ladaa tha ore duusare yuddh main maaraa gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj had only two wars with Ghori, according to 'raso' there were at least four sons, out of which three Shahabuddin were defeated and imprisoned
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar prithviraj parajeet hone ke ananthar saraswati ke nikat pakadaa gaya or maaraa gaya tha, jabaki 'raso' ke anusaar vah shhabuddin ko gazani main uparyukt prakaar se markar mara tha
 These historical references and descriptions are found in all the forms of 'prithvirajasso' and most of them belong to its weft, so will be found in any of its reconstructed forms
 isaliye yah maananaa hi padegaa ki uskaa koi bhi rup prithviraj kii samakaleen rachana nahin ho saktaa he
 The question is that what time can 'raso' be considered a creation
 kuch samay hua, prasiddh anveshi vidvan muni jinvijay ko jain bhandaron main do 'jain prabandh' sangrahon kii ek ek prati mili, jinamein 'prithviraj prabandh' or 'jayachand prabandh' sakalit the
 Some of the verses quoted in these arrangements were also found in 'prithviraj Raso', although the language of these quotes was more secure in antiquity than the language of 'raso'
 donon pratiyon main 'prithviraj prabandh' praaia: abhinn tha or ek prabandhsangrah kii prati san
 1528 kii thi
 From this, Muniji deduced that Chand was definitely a contemporary of Prithviraj and his royalty
 kintu itane se hi yah parinaam nikaalan tarksammat na hoga
 On the basis of these facts, we can only say that Chand received some form of composition before the year 1528, from which those verses are quoted in the above 'prithvirajaprabandh'
 vah rup san
 1528 ke kitne purv nirmit hua hoga iske sambandh main kuch anumaan se hi kaha ja saktaa he, jiske liye nimnlikhit aadhaar liye ja sakate hai : One of the verses quoted is not found in copies of the short text of 'raso' in which Canvas is called 'vyas' and Vasishtha, while all the forms of 'raso' give an account of his undue love with the Carnatic maid, It is evident from the fact that the original author, the author of the above verses, was proclaimed; The original form of the composition should also precede it
 yadi maan liya jaay ki rachana kaa ukt prakshipt rup uske mul rup ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad kaa hoga, aadharbhoot purvaj sangrah uske bhi lagbhag 25 varsh baad taiyaar kiye gaye honge or praapt pratiyaan ukt donon prabandhsangrahon ke taiyaar hone ke bhi lagbhag pachis varsh baad kii hongi, to mul kavyrachana san
 1400 ke lagbhag kii maani ja sakati he
 There is no leniency in this estimate of time, so the date of the original composition cannot be postponed much later
 rachana kii bhashaa kaa jo rup prabandhsangrahon ke udaahranon main tathaa rachana ke laghutam roopon kii pratiyon main miltaa he, vah bhi san
 1400 ke aas paas kaa gyaat hota he, isaliye bhashaa kaa sakshya bhi uparyukt parinaam kii pushti karata he
 'prithvirajasso' is the best Hindi poetry of Veer Ras
 hindi sahitya main vir charitron kii jaisi vishad kalpana is kavy main mili waisi baad main kabhi nahin dikhaai padi
 The reader flows throughout the composition in an overflowing stream of excitement
 kannauj yuddh ke purv sanyogita ke anuraag or virah tathaa ukt yuddh ke ananthar prithviraj sanyogita ke milan or keli vilaas ke jo chitra rachana main milte hai, ve atyant aakarshak hai
 Other juices are also not lacking in poetry
 rachana kaa varnanavaibhav asaadhaaran he; nayak nayika ke sambhog samay kaa shadritu varnan kahin kahin par sanshlisht prakrutichitran ke sundar udhaaharan prastut karata he
 The language style is effective everywhere and varies throughout the poetry according to the subject
 rachana ke in samast gunon par drushtipaat kiya jaae to vah ek sundar mahakavy pramanit hota he or ni:andeh aadhunik bhartiya aryabhasha sahitya ke aadi yug kii vishisht kriti thaharti he
 Nagari Pracharini Sabha, in the editing of Mohanlal Vishnulal Pandya and Shyamsunder Das, published Prithviraj Raso in two volumes
