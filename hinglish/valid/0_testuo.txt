 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below

 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way

 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 From the biological point of view, a group of such organisms is called a caste which has the potential to produce offspring with each other and whose offspring themselves have the capacity to produce offspring further
 udhaaharan ke liye ek bhediya or sher aapas main baccha paidaa nahin kar sakate isliye ve alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 a horse and a donkey can produce a child among themselves, but because mules are unable to bear a child, horses and donkeys are also considered to be of different castes
 iske vipareet kute bahut alag aakaaron main milte hai lekin kisi bhi nar kute or maadaa kute ke aapas main bachche ho sakate hai jo swayan aage santan paidaa karne main sakasham hai
 Therefore, all dogs, irrespective of their race, are considered members of the same race from a biological point of view

 For example, horses, donkeys and zebras belong to different castes but all three are considered members of the same 'aquus' dynasty
 aadhunik kaal main jatiyon kii paribhaasha anya pahaluon ko jaanchakar bhi kii jaati hai
 For example, the DNA of organisms is often tested using genetics, and on this basis, those organisms that have a DNA imprint match each other and are distinct from other organisms

 Many examples of proposed castes should be studied by adding letters before it is considered a caste
 It is generally a short categorized category for those extinct species whose information is only possible from fossils

 haalanki gundharm jaise dna-kram or morphology ek duusare se bahut adhik sambandhit vansh ko pruthak karne main madad ke liye prayog karne vaale is paribhaasha main spasht simaaen hai
 However, the exact definition of the word "caste" is still controversial, especially in relation to the biosphere, and is called the caste problem
 jeev vigyaniyon ne adhik vistrut paribhaashaayen di hai, lekin prayog main aae keval kuch hi vikalp hai jo sambandhit jatiyon kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karti hai
 The names of commonly used plant and animal taxa are sometimes similar to these species: for example, "lion", "walrus," and "camphor tree" - denote each species
 anya maamle jinamein un naam kaa prayog nahin hota: "hiran" 34 jatiyon ke varg ko darshata he, jisamen ald hiran, laal hiran or barasingha shaamil hai
 The latter two castes were once considered to be the same caste, explaining how the boundaries of the castes could change with the increase of scientific knowledge

 Letting the genus determine it is not invariant; a classification scientist can later give it a different genus, due to which its name will also change

 In most textbooks a race is a "real and potentially inter-breed natural population group" that is set apart as other such breeding groups
 is paribhaasha ke vibhinn bhaagon jaise kuch asaamaanya yaa kritrim samagam isse baahar rakhe gaye hai: The definition in the above ideal textbook works well for multi-cellular animals, but there are some situations where they can be ruled out as inappropriate: kshaitijiya jin sthanantaran shabd "jati" paribhaashit karne ko or bhi jatil bana dete hai
 There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between unequal groups of the prokerat group and, at least often, unequal groups of eukaryates, and Williamson argues that there is some evidence available of this in crustaceans and echinoderms

 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals that cause asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently
 phir bhi, anguuthe ke niyam kii sthapana yah kehete hue kii gai ki ve ek duusare se 97% se adhik samaan 16S rrna jin kram bacteria yaa orchia kii jaanch DNA-DNA sankaran dwaara kii jaani chahie chahen vah samaan jati se sambandhit hon athwa nahin
 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98
7%
 yon rup se paidaa hone vaale jeevon, jahaan par jin sambandhi saamagree ko prajnan sambandhi prakriya main saajha kiya jaataa he, to do praaniyon ke antar janan prakriya or donon lingon ke sankar vansh samaan sanketak ke rup main sweekaar kiye jate hai ki praaniyon ne samaan jati ke sadsy ke rup main prachur jeenon ko apanaaya he
 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures
 donon paristhitiki or saamaajik aarthik jatiyaan jivan ke liye sahaayak jatiyaan hai
 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand
 kabhi-kabhi, khaskar jab ateet main sanchaar bahut adhik mushkil tha, to algaav par kaary karne vaale vargeekaran vaigyanikon ne alag-alag jantuon ko alag-alag naam die jinaki pahchaan baad main ek samaan jati ke rup main kii gai
 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals
 paramparaagat rup se, shodhakarta sanrachanaatmak antaron ke avlokan or is avlokan par ki kya bhinn aabaadi main jatiyon main atar ke liye unka antar prajnan safaltaapurvak kiya gaya athwa nahin, par bharosa karte hai; donon sharir rachana or prajnan vyavhaar donon hi abhi bhi jatiyon kii sthiti bataane ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example
 kachhue ko aanvik str par anya sarisrup kii gati ke maatr aathven bhaag ke saath viksit hone ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya or albatras main aanvik vikaas kii dar storm-petrals kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi hi pai jaati he
 Obsolete hybridization techniques are available nowadays and are replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparisons

 In the present era, the internal combustion engines used in cars, trucks, motorcycles and aircraft, etc
, are usually four stroke engines
 'chaar stroke' kaa matlab he ki eendhan se yantric urja main parivartan kaa chakra kul chaar charnon main puraa hota he
 These steps or strokes are called intake, compression, combustion, and emission, respectively
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki in chaar charnon ko puraa karne main cranksashaft ko do chakkar lagane padate hai
 Currently, four stroke engines are commonly used in trains
 isse pehle gadiyon main tu stroke ingine kaa prayog hua karata tha, lekin kam milage or jivan avadhi kam hone ke kaaran iskaa sthaan four stroke ingine ne le liya
 The four-stroke engine was first patented in 1854 by Eugenio Baranti and Felice Matuacci
 iske baad 1860 main iskaa pratham prototip nikaala
 French engineer Alphonse Beau de Roca also independently explored the theory and extracted it in 1861 in his paper
 german ejeeniyar nicholas aato ne 1876 main is ingine kaa kaaryshil praturup nikaala
 For this reason, the four-stroke principle today is called auto-cycle and the spark plugs used in this engine are often called auto engines
 auto-chakra main jhadiabetic sampeedan, sthir aaytan par ooshmaa sangyojan, jhadiabatic vistaar evam sthir aaytan par ooshmaa asweekruti charan aate hai
 a four-stroke engine undergoes a complete cycle, ie four processes at a time
 jinhen angrezi main stroke kaha jaataa he
 Each engine has a hollow cylinder, called a cylinder
 silinder ke bheetar ek piston chalata he, jise ham mushali kah sakate hai
 The work of this piston is exactly the same as that of the stopper within the childrens playing paint
 piston aluminium yaa ispaat kaa banataa he or isamen ispaat kii kamanidaar chudiyaan lagi rahati hai, jisase vaayu yaa gas, piston ke ek ore se duusari ore nahin ja sakati
 The cylinder forehead is closed, but it has two valves
 ek ke khulne par vaayu, yaa vaayu or petrol kaa mishran, bheetar aa sakate hai
 The air or gas inside the cylinder may exit when the other is opened
 maathe main ek spark plag bhi laga rahata he jiske sire par do taar hote hai
 At the appropriate time, a spark of light emits between these two wires, which is automatically controlled when the engine is running
 crank kaa kaam he piston ke aage peeche chalane kii gati ko dhuree ke akshaghurnan main badalata
 The crank rotates when the piston moves back and forth due to the crank
 idhan ke baar-baar jalane se piston bahut garam na ho jaae is vichaar se silinder kii deevaaren hoti hai or unke bich pump dwaara pani pravaahit hota rahata he
 In motorcar etc
, there are four, six or eight cylinders instead of one, and the iron feature in which they remain is called a block
 upar bataae gaye valve, kamaani ke kaaran chipakkar, vaayu aadi ke maarg ko band rakhte hai, parantu valve cam dwaara uchit samay par uth jaataa he, jisase vaayu yaa gas ke aane kaa maarg khul jaataa he
 The spindle on which the cam is mounted is called cam-axle
 yah dhuree ingine se hi chalati rahati he or vaalvon ko uchit samayon par kholti rahati he
 The valve remains closed if it stays under; The valve rises when its long section rotates and falls under the stem of the valve
 ) It is absolutely necessary to keep several oil treaties, where one body rotates or moves on the other, to be dampened with equal oil
 isiliye sarvatra snehak tel pahunchaane kaa prabandh rahata he
 In motorcars, the lower part of the engine is often in the form of a platter in which oil is poured
 prayek chakkar main crank tel main dub jaataa he or chhinte udaakar silinder ko bhi tel se tar kar detaa he
 Pumping is done to deliver oil to other places
 chaturghaat chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main piston ke chaar baar chalane par iske kaarykram kaa ek chakra puraa hota he
 These four are the following: ab flihil kii jhonk se phir piston vaayu or petrol chusata he, use sampidit karata he, idhan jalakar shakti utpann karata he or jali gaisen baahar nikalati hai 
 This sequence continues until the sparks are closed by closing the switch
 ingine ko chaalu karne ke liye isaki pradhan dhuree main handls lagaakar ghumana padataa he, yaa bydaree dwaara sanchalit vidyutmotor se use ghumana padataa he
 Once the power comes to the flyheel, the engine starts running

 Four stroke engines have many benefits
 yah ingine kii shakti dakshata ko badhaata he
 This improves the efficiency of the car
 tu-stroke kii apeksha ingine main kam garmi paidaa hoti he
 Full use of energy increases the lifespan of the engine and throws out less smoke
 is prakaar ingine kii kshamta ke saath-saath hi utsarjan bhi apekshkrit kam hota he
 In a two-stroke engine, both cycles of energy are completed in a single cycle of the crack-shaft, whereas in a four-stroke engine, two cycles of the crank-shaft can complete four cycles of energy
 isse chaturghaati ingine main balaghurna kaa utaachadhaav hota rahata he
 Separate lubrication oil is transported for the fluidity of the rotating parts in four exhaust engines and to protect them from rubbing and friction

 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system
 sthaneey nakshatra pranali akaash ganga ke antargat prati second 200 mile kii gati se chal rahi he or sampurna akaash ganga duurastha bahya jyortimalaon ke antargat prati second 100 mile kii gati se vibhinn dishaao main gum rahi he

 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana

 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 The energy of each quanta is fixed and depends only on the frequency of light
 plank kii is pariklpana ne bhautik jagat main halchal machaa di
 It was here that quantum physics, the new branch of physics, was born

 saanchaa:grammatical categoriesvyakaranika kaal kisi bhi sthiti yaa kriya ke samay ko kriyaapad ke dwaara, par, ke dauraan yaa se pare vyakt karanevaali ek kaalik bhashavaigyanik gunvattta he
 Kaal is at least one of the four qualities, with emotion, voice and aspect, which can make the expression clear
 kaal ek abhivyakti ke ghatnakram ke saath samayik sandarbhon kaa viparyaas vyatirek darshaate hai
 All languages use the same tense - present, past and future, although the expression of these tenses cannot always be explicitly translated from one language to another
 While all languages have typical forms of verbs by which they are identified and sorted into dictionaries, generally the most common present tense or a simple form, the methods used to express their tenses, differ between languages
 kuch aisi bhashaaen hai jinamein kaal kriya rup ke madhyam se antahkunchit nahin hota or na hi sanrachanaatmak drushti se abhivyakt hota he, balki iske bajaay, jab bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tab, samayik kriya visheshan ke istemaal se antarnihit kiya jaataa he or kuch main samayik jaankaree antahkunchit visheshan ke istemaal dwaara prakat hoti he
 In some languages a single verb may be intermixed to indicate aspect and tense simultaneously

 In many texts, the term time mistakenly refers to the quality of uncertainty, frequency, nudity, duration, probability, and even whether information is derived from experience or from rumor
 It is not actually tenses, but traditional nomenclature often classifies them as such
 hakeekat main, sabhi bhashaaon main saamaan kaal hote hai
 They are usually divided into three groups - present, past and future, in which each category is defined in a defined sense
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal vah hote hai jinamein swayan kathan ke samayik sandarbh se pehle avyav kriya ke samayik sandarbh ghatit hote hai
 Past tense can range from simple past / past to immediate past / past, distant or distant past / past as well, there is only one difference between them and that is, the distance on the events between the occasional reference points
 angrezi main kaal do prakaar ke samoohon main vibhajit he - shuddh kaal or kriyabhaav dyotak kaal
 shuddh kaal vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein dwitiyak samayik sandarbh purnataya nishchit samajha yaa janaa jaataa he
 In other words, pure tense refers to expressions in which attestation is believed to be true or known
 duusari ore, kriyabhaav dyotak kaal vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann kii nischitata purnataya nishchit nahin he
 In English, this form is expressed by adding a verb adverb, adverb signifier adverb or adverb signifier adverb
 kriya ghataane se keval angrezi main bhoot kaal abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In all the raw and infallible aspects, the past tense is expressed using the indirect form of the aspectual complement, tha / were, to be)
 gaiyr-kalavadhi pahaluon main, bhoot kaal ek vishesh antahkunchit rup ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen abhimukhataa poorak 'kar liya' ko chhod kar avyav kriya kaa paroksh upyog kiya gaya he
 This form is possible only in a few positive lectures
 kathan ke sabhi anya prakaaron main, pheravat rup niojit kiya janaa chahie
 The present tense is expressed by an unmarked form similar to the past tense, but in this the aspectual complement is only forbidden in agreement with the person and number is / is, is / is) in the inflection forms
 jaisaa ki bhoot kaal ke saath he antahkunchit rup kuch sakaaratmak vyakhyanon ke liye upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 In English, the pure future tense is expressed in the same way as the present tense, but with a future-signifying adverb or time phrase
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal yaa to ek purnataya sweekrut kriyabhaav dyotak rup ke istemaal dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he yaa ek atirikt kriyabhaav dyotak kriya visheshan yaa padbandh ke saath ek shuddh kaal rup dwaara
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal sabase aksar bhavishyakaal abhivyakt karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The verb denote future refers to any of the eight future forms in which attestation cannot be called true due to the uncertain nature of future results
 These forms vary according to certainty and always express that level of future certainty within the intent of a supportive mood
 neeche die gaye soochiptr main "janaa" kriya ke prayog se kuch indo-europi or phino-argic kaal main kaal abhivyakti ke udhaaharan dikhaae gaye hai
 The tenses are broadly classified as present, past, or future
 in vyapak vargikarnon ke bheetar kai sambhavit kaal maujuud hai
 The difference between these periods is mainly the degree of occasional distance from the time of narration
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal kii saamaanya shrenee ke bheetar, tatkaal ateet, sudur ateet, dur sudur ateet or doorvarti ateet maujuud ho sakate hai, inamen antar keval kathan ke ghatnakram ke saath kathan ke samay se duuri main badhottaree kaa he

 The architecture of Jaisalmer has a different significance in the cultural history of Jaisalmer
 kisi bhi sthaan vishesh par paae jane vaale sthapaty se vahaan rahane waalon ke chintan, vichaar, vishwaas evam bauddhik kalpanashiltaa kaa abhas hota he
 The order of architecture in Jaisalmer began with the establishment of the state from the construction of the fort, which continued continuously
 yahaan ke sthapaty ko rajkeey tathaa vyaktigat dono kaa satat prashray miltaa rahaa
 The architecture of this region is expressed by the forts, fortresses, palaces, temples, havelis, reservoirs, canopies and houses used by the common people
 jaisalmer rajya main har 20-30 kilometre ke faasale par chote-chote durg drushtigochar hote hai, ye durg vigat 1000 varsho ke itihaas ke mook gavaah hai
 They had absolute importance in medieval history
 ye rajnatik aavashyaktaanusaar nirmit karaae jate the
 In the construction of fortification, instead of beauty, robustness and safety were taken into consideration
 parantu yahaan ke durg majbootee ke saath-saath sundarataa ko bhi dhyaan man rakhkar banaaya gaya tha
 There is a tradition of keeping the fort in the same main
 durg mukhyatah pattharon dwaara nirmit hai, parantu kishangarh, shahgarh aadi durg iske apwaad hai
 These fortifications are made of concrete bricks
 prayek durg main chaar yaa isse adhik burj banaae jate the
 They gave strength, beauty and strategic importance to the fort
 jaisalmer nagar kaa vikaas 15 veen shatabdi se prarambh hota he
 When residential difficulties in the Jaisalmer Durg appeared, some people started living in the foothills of the fort by building a permanent residence
 bahut kam hi aise nagar hote hai, jinka apana sthapaty hota he
 Jaisalmer is also one of them
 is kaal main jaisalmer shaskaon kaa mughalon se sampark hua va unke sambandh sadaiv sauhardpurn bane rahane se rajya main shanti bani rahi
 For this reason, the activities of trade and commerce started gradually increasing here
 maheshwari, oswaal, paliwal va anya log aasapaas kii riyasaton se yahaan aakar basane lage va kalantar main yaheen bas gaye
 To settle these people, they made mohallas according to their gotra
 aamane-saamne ke makaanon se nirmit 20 se 100 makaanon ke muhalle, sidhi sadak yaa galiyon kaa nimarn hua or ye galiyaan ek duusare se judati chali gayin
 Thus the present city was built
 ye sagotreey, sadharm yaa vyavsaayee mohalle paada yaa mohalle kehalaate the va inhen vyavsaay ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Such as Beasana Pada, the locality of the petals and Churigar living in different neighborhoods of different businesses, different markets emerged in each locality here
 nagar ke purnrupen viksit hone par uski suraksha hetu aay bhi aavashyak prathit hone lage
 As a result, Maharawal Akhasingh got the city park constructed around 1740 AD, which was completed during the reign of Maharawal Mulraj II
 is shahar diwaar main pravesh hetu chaar daravaaje hai, jo pole kehalaati he
 They are called as Gadisar Pol, Amarsagar Pol, Malkapole and Bhaironpole
 ye daravaaje mughal sthapaty kala se kaaphi prabhavit he
 They have wooden doors with large pointed nails, which have emergency windows
 atharahavin sadi ke aate-aate nagar main badhati hui vyapaarik samruddhi ke kaaran vyapaaree, samant va prashasnic varg bahut dhan sampann ho gaya
 As a result, by the beginning of the 19th century, these people started constructing big havelis, bari temples etc
 for housing here
 jaisalmer durg sthapaty kala kii drushti se ucchkoti kii vishuddh sthaneey durg rachana he
 This fort is situated on a 250 feet triangular foot
 is pahaan kii lambaai 150 feet va chaunaai 750 feet he
 Rawal Jaisal established his independent capital
 sthaneey sroton ke anusaar is durg kaa nirmaan 1156 i
 main prarambh hua tha
 But studies of contemporary evidence show that its construction started around 1178 AD
 5 varsh ke alp nirmaan kaary ke uparaant rawal jaisal kii mrityu ho gayi, iske dwaara prarambh karaae gaye nimarn kaary ko uske uttaradhikari shalivahan dwaara jari rakhkar durg ko moort rup diya gaya
 There is no archival evidence of works done by Rawal Jaisal and Shalivahana
 maatr khyaton va tawarikhon se varnan miltaa he
 There are mainly three havelis in the havelis
 patuon kii haveli, dewan salimsingh kii haveli va dewan nathmal kii haveli
 Patu's mansion and Nathmal's mansion in terms of art
 kala kii drushti se patuon kii haveli va nathmal haveli sthapaty kala kaa sarvottam udhaaharan he
 At the same time, Dewan Salim Singh's Haveli is famous for its grandeur and grandeur
 ye sabhi haweliyaan sthaneey pile retile pathar se bani he
 This stone is considered best for excavation work
 ise ghisne par yah atyadhik chikna va chamkila ho jaataa he
 It seems as if passing through the inner and outer layers of any mansion, as if self-evidence is in sight, someone has peeped out of the window of the eyes wearing a pleasant yellow muffle or orbiting the sunshine of the sunshine Applying the eyelid may have killed the eyelids or have developed pudding in the eyes and become yellow mountains in dry sonic sandal sand
 yahan ke lagbhag sabhi bhawan pile, kalatmak jharokhon se yukt, pili chadar main lipte manohari or drushti baandhne vaale
 The viewer's eyes are amazed at the unique craftsmanship of the buildings
 mughal satta ke paraabhav ke uparaant sindh, gujarat va malwa kii ore se kai hindu va muslim kalakaar yahan aakar basane lage tathaa unhone in haweliyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 But if these artisans had come from Gujarat and Malwa, they would have got some original examples of their art, which are not available
 parantu jaisalmer rajya se lage sindh praant main sthaneey kala ke dheron udhaaharan praapt hote hai, jo ki sindh nadi ko paar karte hue baluchistan kii seemaa tak praapt hote hai
 Therefore, it is possible that the craftsmen must have come from Sindh province towards Jaisalmer for the carving done here
 sambhawatah lakdi ke kaam ke liye kalakaar malwa va gujarat se aae honge, kyonki ye donon hi praant is kaary hetu prasiddh hai
 These havelis with sixty-six vents are undoubtedly the best example of art
 ye kul milakar paanch hai, jo ki ek-duusare se satee hui hai
 These havelis are built on a platform 8-10 feet high above the ground and have six floors above the ground and there are 7 floors in total with one floor inside the ground

, while the other floors were residential

 Lime has been used very little in havelis
 adhikanshtah khaanchaa banaakar ek duusare ko pighale hue shishe se lohe kii pattiyon dwaara jobia gaya he
 The outer and inner walls of the building are also made of stone blocks instead of stone blocks with rectangular slabs about 3-4 inches thick, which display the high quality architecture of that period
 patawon kii haweliyaan attharavin shatabdi se seth patawon dwaara banavaai gai thim
 He was adorned with the title Patwa, not Patve

 There is no response to Dewan Mehta Nathmal's mansion in Jaisalmer
 yah haveli dewan nathmal dwaara banavaai gai he tathaa yah kul paanch manzili pile pathar se nirmit he
 The construction period of this mansion is from 1884-85 AD
 haveli main sukshma khudaai mehrabon se yukt khinkiyon, ghumaavdaar khinkiyan tathaa haveli ke agrabhag main kii gai pathar kii nakkashi pathar ke kaam kii drushti se anupam he
 The creators of this unique work were two Muslim artisans under the surname Elephant and Lalu
 ye donon us samay ke prasidv shilpkaar the
 The half-and-half of the mansion was assigned to both artisans with the condition that the two would not mimic the artwork of each other, as well as the repetition of an artwork
 is baat kaa donon ne paalan karte hue iskaa nirmaan purna kiya
 Today, when we look at this mansion from a distance, this entire artwork looks the same, but if we look carefully, the artisans on both sides from the center center of the mansion have subtle frescoes, the immortal work of two craftsmen
 She shows
 haveli kaa kaary aisa santulit va sukshmata liye hue he ki lagata hi nahin do shilpkaar rahen hon
 The mansion is built on a 7-8 foot high platform

 is vishaal kaksh main kisi prakaar kii kamaani yaa beam aadi kaa sambandh nahin kiya gaya he
