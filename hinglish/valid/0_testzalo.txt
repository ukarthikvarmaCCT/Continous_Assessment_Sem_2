 It is believed that Rajkamal started his writing with his mother tongue Maithili
 kaha jaataa he ki navada ucch vidhyalay ke ek apane shikshak se prabhavit hokar unhone layaaddh kavitaayen likhi thi jiske baad unhen ehsaas hua tha ki vah bhi kavitaayen likh sakate hai
 Some of his early lines, which are still unpublished, were written on his school handbook
 panktiyon kii paripakvata ko dekhakar, kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki yah kisi nausikhiye kii kriti nahin ho sakati, jo ki nimna he- Kya rahal priyatma abhinayaboodi bhor mana tububki woke up and no matter 
 unki pratham maithili kahani aparajita 1954 main vaidehi patrika main prakashit hui thi
 His first Maithili poem was also published in 1955 under the title Patania ponytail from Vaidehi itself
 is samay tak unhone hindi main bhi niyamit rup se likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 In a very short time, he had identified himself as a visionary writer whose thinking was far ahead of the times
 unki maithili kritiyon main gramin samaaj ke roodhiwaadee dhaanche par gaharaa prahaar he
 It was during his lifetime Swaragandha, his first collection of Maithili poetry poems, was published in 1958
 unki agali kavita sangrah kavita raajakmalak kaa prakaashan mohan bharadwaj ke sampadan main unke dehavsaan ke 24 varshon ke baad hua
 The specialty of his poems was that he did not have any rhythm or any binding of poetic rules
 man ke anuroop unke kavitaaon kii sanrachana bhi nirbandh thi
 His compositions had a momentary influence and were steeped in his personal experiences
 kisi vishay ko dekhne kaa nazariyaa apane samakaleen rachanakaaron se bhinn shrenee main bahut lag khadaa karata tha
 For example, these lines can be seen: mul kavita jagal chhi, kati raati biital achhigyaan nai hoie kichhuo rusal piya jakaan nahi kar maan-abhimaanchaan he, aabah, laalatenak badla main daan daih kichhu jyotiduiye panti likhba lel aab achhi chitthee appan rani ke Hindi translation, i don't know how many nights have happened

 Don't know how long this night has already been
don't sulk like my angry lover, oh moon! Come gift me some light, for a lantern,just two lines remainin this letter to my queen In Maithili, he wrote about 100 poems, three novels, 37 stories, three accents and four critical essays
 unke vrahat saahitiyik lekhan kaa adhikansh hissaa unke jeevankaal main aprakashit rahaa
 About ten months after his death, friends based in BIT Sindri published his first collection of Maithili stories, Lalka Pag
 uske pashchaat nirmohi balam hammer or ek anaar ek rogaah kaa prakaashan hua
 In 1980, Maithili Akademi published Kriti Rajkamalak
 taduparant 1983 main taranand viyogi ke sampadan main ekata champaakali, ekata vishdhar kaa prakaashan hua
 His story Ekta Champakali Ekta Vishdhar is deeply hurt at the mismatched remarriage prevailing in Mithila, which describes how Maithil Samaj, who is suffering from financial stigma, irresponsibly attends a flower-loving girl for marriage in front of her father's aged widower
 yadhyapi raajakmal ne hindi kii tulana main maithili main zyada samay tak likhaa, lekin unka hindi sahitya main yogadan kaaphi samrudh rahaa
 In Hindi, he wrote eight novels, around 250 poems, 92 stories, 55 essays and three plays
 unka hindi main kavita lekhan 1950 ke aas paas shuru ho chukaa tha
 After 1956 the flow in Hindi writing increased considerably
 unki pehali prakashit kavita kaa sheershak tha - barsaat: raat: prabhaat
 His writing in Hindi was different from Maithili in many ways
 yah bhinnata rachana main kendrit samasya, sambodhit varg evam rachana kii buniyadi sanrachana main thi
 In the works of Hindi and Maithili, women used to attack social and economic problems concretely through characters
 unke rachanaatmak lekhan kaa kaaphi bhaag kalakatta main guzara
 That is why in his writings, there is often depiction of Calcutta, life there, class struggle
 iske alaava unki lekhnee main paashchaatya sahitya kaa kai baar sandarbh miltaa he
 There is a mention of such subjects in his literature which till that time was untouchable or tyjya category for many litterateurs
 bahut lambe samay tak bhartiya sahitya main stri se sambandhit vishay tathaa unki samasyaayein, samaaj main shaleenta kii oot main chuphi ashleelata or dharm evam samskruti ke naam striyon kaa yonik daman aise vishay rahe hai jinase kai mahaan lekhakon ne apana vaasta dur rakhaa
 Writers who wanted to write on those problems were accused of ideological distortion and cheap literature writing
 raajakmal ke rachanakarm main in saare vishyon main pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se nirbhikta se saath kiya hua chithran he
 As a result of this fearlessness, many of his contemporary litterateurs saw his creations very heartily and ignored and boycotted his presence

 rotary kii gatividhiyaan, vishesh rup se sthaneey klbon ke str par kiye gayi kaaryon se, sthaneey or vishwa samudaay kii seva karne kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 The four dimensions of service are as follows: - girte hue yaa behate hue jal kii urja se jo vidyut utpann kii jaati he use jalavidyut kehete hai
 In 2005, around 816 gwe of hydroelectric power was generated worldwide, which is about 20% of the total electric power of the world
 yah bijli pradooshan rahit he
 And it is environmentally friendly
 bharat main vidyaman aarthik rup se dohan yogya tathaa arthksham jal sambhavyata 66 pratishat bhaar kaarak par 84,000 megawatt aanklit kii gai he 
 In addition, 6780 MW of installed capacity has been estimated from small, small and micro hydropower schemes
 94,000 megawatt kii sanchit sthapit kshamta ke saath pump kii gai bhandaran yojanaon hetu 56 sthalon kii bhi pahchaan kii gai he
 However, so far only 19
9% of this potential has been exploited
 vidyut, jal se utpann jal se praapt kii gai vidyutshakti ko jalavidyut kehete hai
 Hydropower is very important in the methods of generating electric power
 vishwa kii sampurna vidyut shakti kaa ek tihaai bhaag jalavidyut ke rup main praapt hota he
 Thus, the available energy in any form can be used for generation of electric power
 jalprapaat main girte hue pani main nihit urja kaa upyog pracheen kaal se hi panchakki ko chalaane main kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu is urja kaa vidyutshakti ke liye upyog beesvin shatabdi kii hi dein he
 Not only can the energy contained in falling water be used for power generation, but the kinetic energy contained in flowing water can also be used for power generation
 iske liye sabase pehle aise sthaan kaa chunaav karnaa hota he, jahaan band baandhakar prachur maatra main pani jamaa kiya ja sake or usamen nihit shakti ko vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye jal ko aavashyaktaanusaar nalon athwa khuli nahar ke dwaara bijligharon main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Both rain and land have to be studied to find the suitable place
 band aisi jagah banaaya jaataa he jahaan nunatam mulya main bana band adhiktam pani jamaa kar sake
 For this the natural condition of the place should be such that a river passes through a narrow path between the mountains passing through the valley, so that the dam can be converted into a large reservoir by making a dam at the narrowest place
 band ke upar ek or agratal banaaya jaataa he, jahaan se pani khuli nahar athwa nalon dwaara bijlighar tak le jaaya jaataa he
 This water drives large turbines located in the power plant, generating electric power in the planned generators
 tarabine, cement kancreet ke bane drafttub ke mukh par avasthit hota he
 The water rotates the blades of the turbine as it occurs in the guide vane and thus uses its inherent energy to drive the turbine
 chalate hue tarabine kii yantric urja vidyut urja main roopantarit kar di jaati he or is prakaar jal main nihit urja jalavidyut kaa rup le leti he
 After the turbine thus uses the power contained in the water, the water passes through the draft-tube to the immersion pool, from where it then flows back into the river
 draft-tub kii banaavat aisi hoti he ki pani kii shesh urja dhire dhire samaapt ho jaae, jisase baahar aane par nadi ke kinaaron ko kshatigrast na kare
 The energy contained in water depends on its volume and top
 sheersh ke anuroop jalavidyut yojanaon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : 1
 High top plan - more than about 200 meters
 2
 madhyam sheersh yojana - 50 meter se 200 meter tak
 3
 Low top plan - less than 50 meters
 yojana kaa aakaar evam praroop donon hi sheersh ke upar nirbhar karata he or usee ke anusaar uske tarabinon kaa praroop bhi
 Thus Francis turbine and paston cycles are suitable for high head
 madhyam sheersh ke liye shravak pravaahvale daab tarabine prayukt kiye jate hai
 Propellant type turbine is more suitable for lower head
 ucch sheershawali yojanaon main, saadharantaya, pani kaa aaytan adhik nahin hota
 Therefore, water is transported by taps to the runner's vaults from the turbine pool, enabling the energy contained in the water to drive the runner
 tund dwaara pani ke pawah or gati kaa niyantran karne se tathaa baltiyon par chode janevaale pani ke kone kaa vicharan karne se tarabine ke nirgat kaa niyantran kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah janit honevaali vidyutshakti kaa bhi niyantran ho saktaa he
 It is also possible to vary the angle of buckets and both controls can be done automatically
 nodak praroop ke tarabine ke ranor main keval teen yaa chaar pankh hi hote hai
 They are made of heavy steel
 kam sheershawali yojanaon main bahudhaa pani kaa aaytan bahut adhik hota he 
 Therefore, it is not possible to take water in the taps and use an open drain
 bhaar ke anuroop nirgat praapt karne ke liye tarabine main janevaale pani kii maatra kaa vicharan karnaa aavashyak hota he, jo dwaar khulaai dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 These gate guides are like a crescent and their position controls the water
 baari hone ke kaaran ye dwaar dravchaalit daab dwaara pravartit kiye jate hai
 Just as the angle of the guide panes, or buckets, of the Pelton cycle is rotated, they can also be introduced automatically
 swat: chaalit vicharan sarvo motor dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is a small motor that rotates the hydraulic pressure
 iskaa nivesh tarabine ke nirgat kaa hi ek ansh hota he, at: uske anusaar vicharan karata he
 Thus, the work done by this motor depends on the output of the turbine, which corresponds to the load on it, and automatically controls the guide nettle, or opened by it, by subtracting the hydraulic pressure
 Is, or arranges the angles of buckets
 nodak praroop kii tarabine main caplen praroop kaa tarabine mukhya he
 Its specialty is its strong and high efficiency
 isaki duusari visheshta yah he ki bhaar vicharan se dakshata par bahut kam prabhaav hota he, jiske kaaran vicharanshil bhaar ke liye yah tarabine bahut hi upyukt hota he
 In medium head plans, in general, a mixed turbine is more commonly used, but its selection depends more on the top of the head
 pani ko tarabine main le jane ke liye sthir guide len kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Its output is varied by the variance of its angle
 kam sheershawala tarabine, saadharantaya, khule shashift ke upar sthit hota he
 They are surrounded by a spiral type of casing, allowing water to be carried by a uniform guide guide
 ucch sheershawale tarabine main yah aavaran dhaatu kaa bana hota he
 Turbines can be both horizontal and vertical
 parantu saamanyat:, urdhwadhar hi adhik prayog main aata he
 These have specific types of bearings, which also have to bear the distinguished lateral shock on the machine
 isliye inhen aghat vering kehete hai
 Lubrication of bearings and other moving parts is also a difficult problem in itself
 iske liye daab snehan vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the lubricant oil is pressed and sent to the lubricating places
 tel pump dwaara daab utpann kii jaati he
 There is also a system of automatically shutting down the machine, so that it does not get damaged in such a situation
 snehak tel ko saaf karne ke liye ek tel filter hota he or snehan ke pashchaat garam ho janevaale tel kaa thandha karne ke liye tel sheetak kii bhi vyavastha rahati he
 His position is of paramount importance in hydroelectric schemes
 inaki sthiti, mukhyat:, prakritik evam bhautik kaarnon par nirbhar karti he
 Roughly 10 MW of power would be available if a hydroelectric scheme provided a top of 150 feet with a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second
 jalashay kaa anumaan bhi is aadhaar par lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki 1
13 varg mile ke kshetrafal main 1 foot pani keval 1 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah utpann karata he
 Therefore, to get a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second, the reservoir must have an average of 10 square feet of water over an area of 113 square miles
 kisi bhi jalavidyut yojana ko vyaavhaarik hone ke liye vah aavashyak he ki adhik se adhik sheersh evam pravaah ho
 Low-top schemes can only be practical when the flow of water is sufficient
 ucch sheershawali yojanaayen kam pravaah par bhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati he
 It is not mandatory for the power house to be near the dam
 jalashay pahaad par ho saktaa he or adhik sheersh paane ke liye bijlighar pahaad kii talahati main banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, large tubes of water are transported to the power station
 ucch sheersh vaali yojanaayen saamanyat: isi praroop kii hoti hai
 In many places the water is transported to another power station in the hill by cutting the hill
 bijlighar kaa prithvital par hona bhi anivaary nahin
 Many power stations are also inside the earth and can be accessed only by lift
 mathan main bhi aisa hi bhumigat bijlighar banaaya gaya he
 Such power houses are of the automatic type and operated from the ground floor by remote control
 yadhyapi ye bijlighar mukhyat: prakritik kaarnon se hi prithvi ke andar banaae jate hai, tathaapi ye samrik drushtikon se surakshit hone ke kaaran bahut mahatvapurn hote hai
 There are many low-end schemes in our country
 ganga evam sharada naharon ke upar bahut se bijlighar banaae gaye hai, jinamein keval 20 se 30 foot ke sheersh kaa hi upyog kiya gaya he
 These schemes have become feasible due to high water flow
 jalavidyut yojanaayen, mukhyat:, norge, sweden, switsraland, germany, france, canada, rus evam america main hai
 India is also not far behind in hydroelectric schemes and some of the schemes here are counted among the world's greatest schemes, such as bhakra-nangal, Damodar Valley, Rihand, Hirakund, Nagarjuna Sagar, Koyna, Shivasamudram, Periyar etc
 bahut si jalavidyut yojanaayen bahuddeshiy bhi hoti hai
 These are mainly included with irrigation and flood prevention schemes, so that all-round development of the area can be done
 america main tennesi ghati nigam ke aadhaar par bharat main bhi damodar ghati nigam kii sthapana kii gai
 Many important hydroelectric schemes have been made in the last twenty years and plans are being made after studying the hydroelectric potential everywhere
 jalavidyut yojana main, yadhyapi, aarambh main bahut adhik vyay hota he, tathaapi tab bhi parichaalan vyay kam hone ke kaaran adhikansh yojanaayen aarthik drushtikon se safal hoti hai
 The life of their plant is also relatively much longer
 inkaa mukhya dosha vastav main inaki upabhokta sthanon se duuri he
 These plans cannot be made for wherever they are
 udaahranarth, yadi shakti kii maang kalkatte main he, to vahaan jalavidyut yojana karyanvit karnaa sambhav nahin
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas contain immense water power, but there is no demand for power
 is prakaar jalavidyut yojana dwaara janit vidyut shakti ko bahudhaa bahut duuri tak preshit karnaa hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to incur the expenditure of the remittance system for a comparative study of the hydroelectric scheme
 tab bhi adhikanshat: jalavidyut hi sasti padati he
 Surat is a major city in the state of Gujarat
 yah shahar surat jile kaa prashasnic mukhyalay bhi he
 The Tapi River passes through the city of Surat
 surat mukhyat: kapadaa udyog or diamond kating or polishing ke liye prasiddh he, isliye is shahar ko silk city or diamond city ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is believed that the modern city of Surat was established in the last years of the fifteenth century

 Articles 315-323 of the Constitution provide for the formation of a Federal Public Service Commission and a State Public Service Commission for the states
 shrimati alka sirohi isaki nivartmaan adhyaksh hai
 Its founding began on the days when the then English rulers in 1919 acknowledged the need for autonomous governance for India
 5 march 1919 ke bhartiya vaidhanik sudhaar vishyak pratham preshnaptr main kaha gaya : a practical expression of this sentiment is found in the Indian Government Legislation of 1919
 usamen ek saarvajanik seva ayog kii sthapana kaa vidhaan tha jisaki sevaaon ke liye padaadhikariyon kii bhartee, bharat kii saarvajanik sevaaon kaa niyantran tathaa aise anya karttavya honge jinka nirdesh saprishad bharat sachiv karenge
 But that commission was not established immediately
 1923 main, lord lee ke netritv main, ek royal kamishan niyukt hua, jisko bharat ucch sevaaon ke upar vichaar evam vivaran prastut karnaa tha
 That commission, in its 27 March 1924 statement, immediately emphasized the need to set up the Public Service Commission, which was indicated in the 1919 legislation
 uskaa prastaav tha ki ukt ayog ke nimnlikhit chaar mukhya kaary honge: That public service commission was established in October 1926
 ek niyamavali banaai gai jisamen is baat kaa vidhaan tha ki akhil bharat kii pratham or dwitiya shreniyon kii sevaaon ke, un pratiyogita parikshaon ke paathyakramon ke nirdhaaran jinke dwaara karmchaariyon kaa nirvachan ho, ukt sevaaon ke liye padonnati, anushaasaneey kaary, vetan, bhatte, pension, provident fund evam paariwarik pension vishay aadi maamalon main sarkaar usase paraamarsh le
 Government will also consult the said Commission on questions of rules of any particular class or all services and rules of leave etc

 To arrange all the competitive examinations by which the office bearers were elected, the duties of the Central and State Commissions were stated
 sarkaar ko aayogon se iskaa bhi paraamarsh karnaa tha ki sevaaon ke liye, kis prakaar chunaav ke dwaara niyukti ho, padonnati kaise kiye jaaen, ek vibhaag se duusare vibhaag main sthanantaran kaise kiye jaaen, aadi
 It was also proposed in the said white paper that the government should consult the commissions on different topics also: 1935 ke bhartiya vidhaan ke pariched 266 main, uparyukt prastaavon ko sthaayee rup diya gaya
 In it, the duties of the Public Service Commissions were clearly laid down
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki ukt vidhaan ke dwaara hi aayogon kii antim evam sthaayee rup main rachana kii gai thi
 The organization, form and basis of today's central or state commissions are all dependent on the same
 swatantraaa ke baad, samvidhan sabha ne anubhav kiya ki civil sevaaon main nishpaksh bhartee sunishchit karne ke saath hi seva hiton kii raksha ke liye sangheey evam prantiy, donon staron par lok seva aayogon ko ek sudrudh or swytt sthiti pradaan karne kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 Members of the Commission are appointed by the President

 Their tenure is up to 6 years or 65 years of age

 a candidate's plan does not need to be a memorial, but should be enough to distinguish it from other candidates

 Preparation Technique: yah ek atiranjit tathy nahin he ki iees desh kii sabase kathin pratispardhi pariksha he or gahan abhyaas or taiyaari ke liye kahata he
 There is no definite answer to the most common questions, such as how many hours does an IAS candidate have to spend every day? It will differ from person to person, so let us look at it from a general perspective
 samay kii aavashyaktaa: Experts believe that aggressive preparation for 10 to 12 months is a must
 prayek 10 bharatiyon main se chaar ek iees adhikari banane kii ichha rakhte hai or pratispardhaa itani teevr he ki us vishaal sankhya kaa keval 5 pratishat hi ho jaataa he
 a candidate should map an effective strategy and decide the ideal number of hours required to implement that strategy
 ek icchhuk ko yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki civil seva pariksha kii taiyaari gunatmak or maatraatmak taiyaari ke liye nahin he
 It is about meeting your short term goal
 adarsh rup se aapako har din do vishyon ko lakshith karnaa chahie
 Most of the top rankers have started preparing for examinations since their school days, as most of the questions are mostly asked from class 6 to 12 standard books
 isliye pariksha taiyaar karne se pehle 10 se 12 ghante pehle note taiyaar karnaa or samarpit hona paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Underline the syllabus and prepare your preparation yadi aapane jeevigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya he, to aap nishchit rup se "sanshleshan" shabd se parichit honge
 It is a process in which the basic components are divided into their by-products
 aap apane iees paathyakram ke saath bhi aisa hi kar sakate hai
 Find the topics you are good at and the topics you will need
 sabhi vishyon ke liye ise karen or un par kaam karen
 Object the course adhikansh iees ummidavaaron ko iees paathyakram ke bade hisse ko hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 There is no doubt that the syllabus is vast, but if you divide the subjects into manageable chunks, the tasks that look impossible will become easier for you

 lekin jis kshan aap apni taiyaari kaa anand lenaa shuru karte hai, taiyaari se jude sabhi anachaahe tanaav or chintaa gaayab ho jaaengi

 Papua New Guinea Monarchy is the constitutional monarchy of Papua New Guinea
 papua new gini ke ekadhidaruk ko papua new gini or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi papua new gini kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 Papua New Guinea is theoretically a monarchy and the ruler of Papua New Guinea is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the governor, as his representative, the governor-general of Papua New Guinea
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen "papua new gini kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko "papua new gini ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Papua New Guinea is in British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and colonized it in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 papua new gini kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai

 This tunnel was constructed right below the Grand Trek railway lens
 jo ki us ilaake main pani ke bahaav ko paas ke kheto aadi kii taraf modne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This tunnel was built in 1900, which is about 16 feet high and 125 feet long
 tunnel ke nirmaan ke baad sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha
 But after some time an accident occurred that shook the people around
 chuking is tunnel ke aas-paas us vakt kuch khaas aabaadi nahin thi or is tunnel main hameshaa pani bhi nahin bharaa rahata tha
 This tunnel was used when water increased
 us samay is tunnel main kai haadasein hue jinamein se ek haadasa aisa tha jisase aaj bhi onterio ubar nahin paaya hai
 This was at a time when there was no water in this tunnel
 us samay tunnel ke dakshin taraf ek lakdi kaa ghar tha
 a father and daughter used to live in that house
 us samay tunnel ke paas bahut tej hawa chal rahi thi or chaaron taraf bhayanak andheri raat thi
 Meanwhile, a sudden fire broke out in that house
 us samay ghar main wo ladki akele apane pichley kamare thi
 The wind was also on the same side and seeing the fire completely took that house in its arms
 tab ladki ko aag kaa pataa chalaa to wo ghar ke pichley hisse se bhaagane ke liye uthi, tab tak aag ne raudra rup dhaaran kar liya tha or makaan kaa ek hissaa uske upar aa gira
 The girl somehow ran away but caught fire in her clothes
 ladki khud ko bachaane ke liye tunnel kii taraf bhaagi taaki wo tunnel ke pani main kud sake
 But by the time she reached the tunnel, she was badly burnt and when she jumped in the tunnel, she fell directly on the ground
 tunnel main us samay pani nahin choda gaya tha
 The scream of the girl, which was badly engulfed by the fire, echoed in that area
 uski cheekh itani bhayanak thi ki aas-paas ke kai log vahaan aa pahunche or tunnel ke upar se aag se ladati hui is ladki ko dekhte rahe, lekin kisi ne bhi use bachaane kii himmat nahin kii or aakhirkaar aag se harkar us jawan ladki ne vahiin dam tod diya

 tunnel ke aas-paas ke logon kaa maananaa he ki ek baar raat main kuch vahashi darindo ne ek ladki ke saath is tunnel ke andar samuhik balaatkaar kiya tha
 Not only this, after raping those poor people, they used to hide their black handiwork and put oil on that poor girl and burnt it
 logon kaa kahana he ki us samay wo ladki bhi bahut bhayanak chikh rahi thi
 But the people around had seen the old accident and they thought that perhaps the spirit of that girl is screaming
 subah jab log tunnel ke paas gayi to dekha ki ek ladki kaa adhjala shav jameen par padaa tha or tunnel kii diwaron par us ladki ke chadhane ke nishaan bhi maujuud the
 Since then, people are also afraid of passing around that tunnel at night
 logon kaa kahana he ki aaj bhi raat main koi udhar se gujarata he to tunnel ke andar se sisakane or sharir ke jalane jaisi badboo aati hai
 Spirit in the tunnel: It is believed that if someone lights up the tunnel, the souls of both of those girls get upset

 As he lit the match, the match was extinguished, when he tried again, strong wind started running from the other side of the tunnel
 uske baad wo vahaan se uthaa or hawa se bachane ke liye tunnel ke andar chalaa gaya or ek kone main jaakar maachis jalaane laga
 As he lit a match for the third time, a terrible scream erupted in that tunnel and the sweeper saw the shadow of a girl on the top of his head that was sticking towards the lizard with the walls of the tunnel
 Was screaming again and again
 cheekh itani bhayanak thi ki aas-paas ke logon ne bhi use suna
 The people working on the tunnel ran and started looking inside the tunnel
 to unhone dekha ki wo aadmi tunnel ke andar jameen par behosh padaa he or uske haath main maachis thi
 He was somehow ejected and admitted to the hospital for treatment

 The second type is spin bowling
 tej gendbaazi karne vaale khiladiyon ko aksar tej gendbaaz, fastman, pes bowler, yaa pesamen kaha jaataa he, haalanki kabhi kabhi tej gendbaazi kii vishesh takanic kaa prayog karne vaale gendbaaz ko swing bowler yaa seem bowler bhi kaha jaataa he
 The main objective of fast bowling is to push the hard ball of the cricket at a high speed and give it such a speed that it can bounce on the pitch with the bounce or get out of the side in the air, so that the ball is clean for the batsman
 Be hard to hit
 ek praroopik tej gati se daali gayi gend kii gati 136 se 150 kilometre / ghanta hoti he
 The unofficial record of the fastest ball ever cast is recorded at 101
9 mi / h in the name of Pakistan's Mohammed Sami, the ball was bowled in a match against India
 adhikarik rup se darj kii gayi sabase tej gati se daali gayi gend kii gati 161
3 kilometre prati ghanta thi or yah gend 2003 ke cricket vishwa cap main england ke khilaaf ek match ke dauraan pakistan ke shoeb akhtar ke dwaara daali gayi thi
 The batsman to play on this ball was Nick Knight, who hit the leg side
 haalanki baad main brett lee kii ek gend kii gati bhi itani hi paayi gayi, parantu radar ke sanketon main bahari hastkshep ke kaaran ise thik tareeke se darj nahin kiya ja sakaa tha
 Two back-up radars recorded a perfect speed of 142 km / h for this delivery
 adhikansh cricket deshon main, tej gendbaazon ko team kii gendbaazi kaa mukhya aadhaar mana jaataa he, jabaki dhime gendbaaz sahaayak bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The opposite is often true in the subcontinent, especially in India and Sri Lanka, where fast bowlers play the right role for the spinner
 aisa kaaphi had tak in deshon main prayukt pich kii sthiti ke kaaran hota he, jo tej gendbaaz kii tulana main spinner ke liye adhik sahaayak hoti he, lekin antarrashtriya str par spinner ke vishisht kaushal kii tulana pes bowler se kii jaati he
 In contrast, the other main subcontinent, Pakistan, has had many skilled fast bowlers, as this country specializes in reverse swing and pitches here are more helpful for fast bowlers
 aisa sambhav he ki ek gendbaaz keval gati par dhyaan kendrit kare, vishesh rup se ek yuva gendbaaz ke liye yah sach he, parantu jaise jaise tej gendbaaz paripakv hota jaataa he, vah or bhi kai kaushal hasil kar letaa he or swing gendbaazi yaa seem gendbaazi kii taraf uskaa rujhaan badhane lagata he
 gendbaaj adhikansh tej gendbaaz in donon main ek kshetra main visheshgy hote hai or kabhi kabhi inhen strike, swing yaa seem bowler main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 However, this classification is not satisfactory because the gradation is not mutually exclusive and a skilled bowler usually puts a mixture of fast, swing, seam and cutting balls, regardless of one type of preference over the other
 iske bajaay, tej gendbaazon ko unki delivery kii ausat gati ke anusaar vargeekrut karnaa adhik aam he, jaisaa ki neeche diya gaya he These words are used on the basis of context; For example, Cricinfo uses the terms "fast-medium" and "medium-fast" interchangeably
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki sabase tej gendbaaz express gati se gend daalate hai
 For comparison, most spin bowlers in professional cricket bowl at an average speed of 45 to 55 meters per hour
 kuch gendbaaz tej se dhimi har prakaar ke gend badlaav ke saath daalate hai, isse kuch bhram utpann ho saktaa he kyonki unhen bhinn shreniyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he, udahaaran ke liye brett lee apni tej gend ko 145 kilometre pati ghanta kii gati se daalate hai, jo unhen ek tej gendbaaz banaata he, haalanki ve kabhi kabhi lagbhag 120 kilometre prati ghanta kii gati se dhimi gend bhi daalate hai
 Conversely, Anil Kumble is a spin bowler, he bowls relatively fast, having a speed of 110 kilometers per hour
 haalanki ek gendbaaz koun si shrenee main feet baithta he, iskaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye in aankadon par aksar dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he, kyonki gend daalane kii gati main badlaav hote rahete hai, iske peeche mukhya iraadaa hota he, ballebaaz par prahaar karnaa, naaki gendbaazi kii ek maanak gati nirdhaarit karnaa
 The slower the fast bowler, the more he has to rely on the change techniques given below to take wickets
 jabaki tej or ek had tak tej-madhyam or madhyam-tej gendbaaz aksar apni ugrata or gati ke dwaara ballebaaz ko out kar dete hai
 In practice, very few specialist bowlers fall into the medium range - bowlers bowling at this pace are often batsmen who can bowl a few overs when needed
 in gendbaazon medium pesar kaha jaataa he
 Spin bowlers are often placed in the medium-slow and slow-medium categories, as a ball bowled at this speed with the technique of fast bowling is often much easier to hit than spin
 haalanki spinner ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main "dhime gendbaaz" kaha jaataa he, peshewar cricket main bahut kam khiladi vastav main "dhimi" shrenee main gend daalate hai The first thing a fast bowler needs is to hold or grip the ball correctly
 buniyadi tej gendbaazi main adhiktam gati praapt karne ke liye gend ko is tarah se pakadaa jaataa he ki seem sidhe upar kii ore ho or sanket anguli tathaa madhyam anguli ko seem ke sheersh par ek duusare ke paas rakhaa jaataa he or angootha seem ke bilkul neeche hota he
 The image to the right shows the correct hold
 pehali do anguliyaan or angootha gend par grip banaata he, yah hissaa shesh haath se thodaa aage kii ore hota he or shesh do anguliyon ko hatheli ke saath chipka kar rakhaa jaataa he
 The ball is caught very lightly, so that it is easily released from the hand
 anya prakaar kii grip bhi sambhav hai, iske parinamswaroop kuch alag tarah kii gend daali jaati he- neeche dekhen swing or seem gendbaazi
 gendbaaz aamtaur par ek haath se gend par grip banaata he or duusare haath ko is haath par adhiktam sambhav samay tak rakhe rahata he, taaki ballebaaz yah naa dekh paae ki vah kis prakaar kii grip le rahaa he, yaa lene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 a fast bowler needs to run longer towards the wicket than the spinner
 yah lambi daud tej delivery ke liye gend main ek samveg utpann karti he
 Fast bowlers identify the distance from the wicket and measure the distance required for this race
 gendbaaz ke liye yah jaananaa bahut mahatvapurn hota he ki uski daud kii thik lambaai kitni hogi, kyonki ise popping kris par khatm karnaa jaruri hota he
 If the bowler goes beyond this crease, then the ball put by him falls in the category of no ball
 ran-ap yaa daud ke ant main gendbaaz apane agle pair ko pich par rakhata he, is samay jahaan tak ho sake use apane ghutane ko sidhaa rakhata hota he
 This helps to speed the ball but it can be dangerous because this action puts pressure on the joint
 ghutane kii chotein tej gendbaazon main asaamaanya nahin hai: udhaaharan ke liye, english pes bowler david laurence, ke ghutane kii cap ke do hisson main tut jane ke baad main kahi maheenon tak khel se baahar ho gaye
 The pressure on the front foot is so high that some fast bowlers cut the front of their shoe to prevent injury to their toe, as they have to repeatedly press against the shoe
 iske baad gendbaaz apni gendbaazi vaali bhujaa ko apane sir se upar uthaata he or ke upyukt unchai par le jaakar gend ko chhod detaa he, jahaan use lagata he ki gend ko daalaa janaa chahie
 Once again, the arm must be straight, although this is a rule of cricket rather than aiding in increasing speed
 kohni ko mode kar gend daalane se gendbaaz ke liye aasaan ho jaataa he ki vah sidhe ballebaaz ke wicket par prahaar kare or use out kar de
 Fast bowlers perform actions that leave them side-on or chest-on at the end of the run-up
 ek chest-on gendbaaz kii chaati or kulhe us samay ballebaaz kii or jhuke hote hai jab uskaa pichhlaa pair jameen ko choota he, jabaki ek said- on gendbaaz kii chaati or kulhe us samay ballebaaz kii disha main 90 degree par jhuke hote hai, jab uskaa pichhlaa pair jameen ko choota he
 West Indies bowler Malcolm Marshall was a good example of a chest-on bowler, while Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee used the side-on technique
 haalanki ek gendbaaz kaa ection gend kii gati ko prabhavit nahin karata, lekin yah unke dwaara daali jane vaali gendon kii style ko simit kar saktaa he
 Although there are no set rules and laws for this, side-on bowlers usually bowl outside when they swing outward, while front-on bowlers bowl inward
 tej gendbaaz ke ection kaa ek or prakaar he, sling, isamen gendbaaz jab gend kii delivery kii shuruuaat karata he, uski bhujaa puri tarah se uski peeth ke peeche kii ore faili hui hoti he
 The sling generates excessive speed, but has to compromise control
 sling ke saath gend daalane vaale sabase prasidd gendbaaz hai, jaiff thomson, jo ek chota ran-ap lete hue bhi asaadhaaran gati se gend daalate the
 Current international players who bowl with Sling include Fidel Edwards, Sean Tate, Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson
 jab gend daal di jaati he, gendbaaz apane ection ke ant main "pholo thru karata he
 In this, the bowler runs a few steps to slow down his pace and comes out of the pitch while on the side
 delivery ke ant main pich se baahar aate samay gendbaaz sataha ko kshatigrast kar saktaa he, jisase pich par asamtal ptch ban jate hai, spin bowler aksar gend ko zyada ghumaane ke liye aisa karte hai; aisa karnaa khel ke niyam ke anusaar avaidh he
 Those bowlers who continue to run on the pitch can be warned that in a game, the bowler is unable to bowl again during that innings when three such warnings are received
 ek prabhavi tej gendbaaz ko ek susangat line or length bana kar rakhni hoti he, yaa saamaanya shabdon main kaha jaye to use bilkul sateek hona chahie
 is sandarbh main, line kaa sandarbh ballebaaz kii ore gend ke path se he, jab vah of se leg said kii ore kshitij aayam main daud rahaa he
 Whereas length refers to the distance that is set before the ball bounces in the batsman's direction
 ek tej gedbaaj ke liye aksar length zyada mahatvapurn hoti he
 The faster the bowler is, the more difficult it is for him to maintain the line and length, but the faster the ball can be thrown
 ve tej gendbaaz jo is drushti se bilkul sateek hote hai, ve atyant prabhavotpadak hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, australian tej gendbaaz glen mekagra or dakshin africa tej gendbaaz shaun polok In modern cricket, the line intended for the fast bowler is so-called indefinite; This is the area just outside the batsman's off stump
 ballebaaz ke liye yah bataanaa mushkil hota he ki aisi gend unke wicket se takaraayegi yaa nahin or is prakaar se vah yah nahin jaan paata ki bachane ke liye gend ko chhod diya jaye yaa ise hit kiya jaye
 is takanic ko saidhantik rup se of theory kaha jaataa tha, lekin ab yah itani niyamit he ki ise shaayad hi kabhi koi naam diya jaataa ho
 beshak, line main badlaav bhi mahatvapurn he or leg stump par daali gayi delivery uddeshy ko puraa karti he
 Accurate mastery of the line of the ball is best used when a batsman is known to have the weakness to hit a particular shot, because the bowler who is putting the ball along from an effective line is right after the weakest time Can put the ball
 ek nishchit line par gend ko lagaataar hit naa kar paane ke kaaran asankhya ballebaazon kaa karier khatm ho jaataa he, jab ve kushal line gendbaazon kii gend par out ho jate hai
 a good length ball is one that is at the height of his waist when reaching the batsman
 ek acchhee length ke liye koi nirdhaarit duuri nahin he, yaa vastav main cricket main gend ke liye koi anya length nahin he, chunki aavashyak duuri gend kii gati ke anusaar alag alag hoti he, isi tarah se yah duuri pich kii avasthaa or gendbaaz tathaa ballebaaz kii oonchai par bhi nirbhar karti he
 It should be noted that bowling a "good length" in this sense is not always appropriate — in some situations, on some pitches and for some batsmen another length may be effective
 daayin ore diya gaya chitra is baat ko spasht karne main madad karegaa ki alag alag length kaa kya taatpary he
 a ball that bounces just before the good length and rises higher than the batsman's stomach is called a short pitch ball or is described as a long hope and hit it for the batsman
 Easier because he gets more time to see if there is a disturbance after the ball height and line bounce
 ek chote pich kii gend ballebaaz ke liye sahi oonchai par hoti he, kyonki vah is par ek aakraamak pul shot laga saktaa he
 a ball that bounces before a good length and reaches shoulder or head height is called a bouncer and can be an effective delivery
 koi bhi gend jo itani short hoti he ki ballebaaz ke sir ke upar bouns ho jaye, use aamtaur par ampaire ke dwaara wide kaha jaataa he
 Putting a short pitch ball or a wide ball is not considered good as it makes it easier for the batsman to defend or attack
 scale ke duusari ore, vah gend jo acchhee length ke bajaay ballebaaz ke paas aakar bouns hoti he, use phul pich yaa over pich kii gend kaha jaataa he yaa ise hof voli ke rup main bhi varnit kiya jaataa he
 Instead of a good length, it is easier for the batsman to play these balls as they do not have much time to move after being bounced from the seam
 ballebaaz ke ke pair ke najadik daali gayi gend yorker kehalaati he, agar ise thik prakaar se daalaa jaye to yah bahut prabhavi length he
 If the ball does not bounce before reaching the batsman, it is called a full toss
 ballebaaz ke liye is prakaar kii delivery ko khlena bahut aasaan hota he, kyonki yah pich se bouns naa hone ke kaaran apana rasta nahin badalati
 isiilie teen prabhavi length ) ko hit karnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he, kyonki leth par niyantran tej gendbaaz ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 Spin bowlers, on the other hand, always aim for a good length, but they have to control the flight of the line to make the line effective
 ek tej gendbaaz apane puure cricket karier main shaareerik rup se feet rahane kii koshish karata he, yah avadhi ek dashak se adhik ho sakati he
 It is needless to say that this is very difficult to do and it also requires good luck with great discipline
 strike gendbaazi ek aise prakaar kii gendbaazi he jisamen gendbaaz gend ko hawa main daalane yaa pich ke baahar daalane ke bajaay tej gati or ugrata ke saath ballebaaz ko out karne kaa prayaas karata he
 These techniques are usually successful against the top batsmen only when the fast bowler has the ball in the fast or fast-medium range
 dhime gendbaaz kabhi kabhi hi in takneekon kaa prayog karte hai, vishesh rup se ant main khilne vaale ballebaazon ke khilaaf in takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, parantu aksar yah takanic ulti padati he or ballebaaz ran lene main safal ho jaataa he
 However, aggressive bowling techniques can be used jointly with the bowling swing or seam technique so that the bowler can bowl any speed that is not possible to play
 Inswinging yorkers are considered particularly fatal
 bounsar ek aisi gend hoti he jise pich ke pehle aadhe hisse main daalaa jaataa he, taaki iske baad iske paas itnaa samay ho ki yah tezi se uthe or ballebaaz tak pahunchane tak uski chaati yaa sir kii oonchai tak pahunch jaye
 isse ballebaaz ko do tarah kii samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 If he tries to play it, the bat will be at the level of his eye so that he will not be able to see the ball while putting the shot and it will be difficult for him to play this shot
 agar vah ise chhod detaa he to yah uski chaati yaa sir par prahaar kar sakati he or kabhi kabhi use chot bhi lag sakati he
 For this reason, a bouncer is also known as Intimidatory Bowling
 ek bounsar ke liye ballebaaz kii saamaanya pratikriya hoti he ise neeche dak kar dena, lekin iske liye teevr sajagata or pratikriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or kabhi kabhi gend ballebaaz ko hit kar jaati he
 Attempting to save your head by straightening the bat is a normal reaction in this situation, but it should not be done if possible because doing so returns the ball to an uncontrolled angle and can be easily caught is
 adhikansh ballebaaz dehshat se bhar jate hai or apana wicket kho dete hai, is tarah se kai ballebaazon ke karier par pratikul prabhaav padaa he
 a physically powerful batsman often hits such a ball when it is moving, even if he cannot see it, as this is not uncommon, in this situation due to the combined speed of both the speed of the ball and the batsman's bat
 She goes out of the boundary
 yahaan is baat kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he ki wicket keeper is gend ko rokane kaa prayaas karata he, isliye ek kushal ballebaaz ke liye yah gend ranon ke lihaaj se mahangi pad sakati he
 a slow ball is a ball which is thrown at normal speed in terms of action and run-up and its grip is lightly altered to reduce its speed
 isse ballebaaz ko dhokhaa ho jaataa he, kyonki vah tej gati kii gend ko khilne kii taiyaari main hota he, achaanak gend kii gati kam ho jane ke kaaran uske shot kaa samay gadabada jaataa he
 This usually results in the ball hitting the bat and moving downwards and the bat speed slowing down
 se takaraati he, isliye urja kaa sthaanantaran ho jaataa he or gati kam ho jaati he)
 saath hi, jab balla gend ko hit karata he, us samay vah thodi si gati kar chukaa hota he or apane chaap ke upari hisse main hota he, jiske kaaran gend balle se alag hone ke baad ek bade kone par laut jaati he
 This combination results in a slower catch ball, a relatively easy catch
 kisi kisi maamle main, ballebaaz is shot ko itnaa jaldi khel jaataa he ki clin bold ho jaataa he
 One of several types of grip is shown on the right
 anivaary rup se antar keval itnaa he ki madhyam or sanket anguli ek duusare se dur ho gayi hai or neeche kii taraf seem ke donon ore aa gayi hai
 Due to this, when the ball is out of hand, it tends to stretch more and the delivery speed decreases
 dhimi gendon ko of spinner ke dwaara of brake grip or finger ection kaa upyog karte hue bhi daalaa jaataa he
 Sometimes a slow ball can be bowled using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper part of the ball with just one finger
 dhimi gend aksar us ballebaaz ke khilaaf prabhavi hoti he jo tezi se score bananaa chaah rahaa he
 As a result, its effectiveness with one-day cricket has increased and is particularly beneficial towards the end of an innings when the batsman is aggressively trying to score
 ek adhik anbhavi ballebaaz mid-stroke ko samyojit kar letaa he, is samay vah gend ko balle ke middle se hit karata he
 Another type of slow ball is called slob
 ise keval sheersh anguliyon se daalaa jaataa he
 Its purpose is to insert a "beamer", this type of delivery delivers the ball awkwardly and reaches the yorker length
 yah aksar kris kairns ke dwaara kris red ke liye daali gayi genden hoti thim, jisase phul length main dak ho jaataa tha or stump ud jate the
 a yorker is a ball that bounces on the pitch right in front of the batsman's feet, this area is called a block hole
 ballebaaz ke saamaanya rukh kii vajah se or cricket ke balle kii niyamit lambaai ke kaaran balle ko aamtaur par us samay bhoomi ke paas nahin rakhaa jaataa, jab ballebaaz gend ko strike karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa hota he
 So to play the yorker, the batsman must immediately change the height of his bat, as soon as he is aware that the bowler has inserted the yorker
 yah mushkil hota he or aksar gend bich ke antaraal se nikal jaati he or wicket ko tod detii he
 Successfully playing this type of delivery is called digging out a yorker
 yorker daalane ke liye atyant sateek gendbaazi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, kyonki agar ise bahut lanbaa daal diya jaye to phul toss ho jayega yaa phul pich delivery ho jaaegi, jise khelnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he, kyonki gend bina bouns hue balle tak aa jaati he
 This is known as a surprise ball
 is do kaarnon se, adhikansh paristhitiyon main yorker saamaanya rup se daali jane vaali delivery nahin he
 In the final stages of an innings in one-day cricket, batsmen try to hit every ball
 aisi paristhitiyon main, yorker vishesh rup se ek prabhavi delivery hoti he
 In this time it helps in taking wickets and prevents the ball from reaching the boundary
 isliye, in paristhitiyon mereksar yorker daali jaati he, aisi paristhiti main ve gendbaaz jo yorker daal sakate hai, puraskaar ke kaabil hote hai
 The seam of the ball is used in seam bowling in such a way that it bounces unexpectedly when it hits the pitch
 ek acha ballebaaz is baat kaa purvanumaan laga letaa he ki gend kahaan par bouns hogi or isse use is baat kaa andaja ho jaataa he ki jab gend us tak pahonchegi tab uski unchai kya hogi
 bouns main main badlaav paidaa karke, gendbaaz is baat kii sambhaavna utpann karata he ki ballebaaz apane anumaan main galati kar baithe or apana wicket kho de
 Seam delivery can be bowled at any speed, but bowlers who put seam balls bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium
 seem gendbaazi kii mul takanic he, saamaanya tej gendbaazi yaa dhimi gend kii grip or yah sunishchit karne kaa prayaas ki seem hameshaa sidhi khadi avasthaa main bani rahe jab tak gend pich se takaraa na jaye
 If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning on its horizon axis, no appreciable magnus effect will occur and the ball will not move in the air
 The seam of the ball is raised and produces a change in bounce and speed if it is the first part of the ball to hit the pitch
 seem gendbaaz vishesh prakaar kii pichon se kaaphi phayda uthaa sakate hai
 a tight pitch that has a severed surface is best for seam bowling, because the ball bounces more easily without losing its momentum due to the hardening of the pitch, while the surface bumps unexpectedly due to unevenness
 , When she hits the pitch
 ise veriable bouns kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes a very strict and uneven pitch is declared dangerous to play as the batsman cannot make any predictions about the ball and as a result the chances of the ball being hit on his body repeatedly
 hari pich bhi seem gendbaazon ke liye sahaayak hoti hai, kyonki ghaas ke chote chote guchchhe asamtal sataha kaa kaam karte hai, haalanki iskaa prabhaav mishrit hota he kyonki hari sataha gend ko dhimaa bhi kar detii he
 Seam bowlers are not effective on a highly flattened and flat surface, and seam bowlers often use aggressive bowling tactics and / or bowling cutters on such a surface
 kattar shabd kaa istemaal ek tej gend ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he jo spin ho rahi he
 This is a type of delivery that revolves around the opposite axis rather than keeping the seam straight
 haalanki is prakaar kaa ghurnan spin gendbaazi jitna phydemand nahin hota, phir bhi isse utpann hone vaale chote badlaav ballebaaz ke liye asuvidhajanak ho sakate hai, aisa gend kii gati ke kaaran hota he
 The cutter seam is an effective method for the bowler
 agar unhen pich se adhik sahaayta nahin mil rahi he to ve gend kii is prakaar kii gatiyon se phayda uthaa sakate hai
 The rotating ball around the seam moves to the right or left when it hits the pitch, depending on which side the ball is spinning
 daayin or bouns hone vaali gend of kattar kehalaati he kyonki yah ek daayen haath ke ballebaaz ke liye of stump se leg stump kii taraf jaati he
 In contrast, the ball bouncing left and right is called a leg cutter as it moves from the leg stump to the off stump for a right-handed batsman
 kattar ko aamtaur par isliye daalaa jaataa he taaki ve ballebaaz ke of stump ke thik baahar pich ko hit kare or wicket se dur chali jaye
 This will cause the ball to hit the outer edge of the bat instead of hitting it, and it will increase the chances of getting caught on returning
 ek kattar prakaar kii gend daalane ke liye gendbaaz ek alag prakaar kii pakad yaa grip kaa upyog karata he
 Two types of right and grip are shown, the top one producing the leg cutter while the bottom one produces the off cutter
 isi tarah se grip badalane ke liye, gendbaaz ko apni anguliyon ko gend ke said main neeche kii taraf laana hota he, taaki gend ko chhodte samay usamen aavashyak spin utpann kiya ja sake
 kattar gendbaazi main gend par khinchaav bad jaataa he or gend kii gati ek dhimi gend kii tarah kam ho jaati he or isse bhi ballebaaz ko bhram main daalane main madad milti he
 The swing bowler, unlike the seam bowler, puts the ball in the air, not putting it off the pitch
 saamaanya yaa paaramparik swing gendbaazi gend kii seem ko uthaa kar kii jaati he or paaramparik swing aamtaur par us samay sabase zyada hota he jab gend nayi hoti he or isliye isamen spasht seem hota he
 As the ball becomes old, it becomes difficult to swing, but it can be done if the fielding team polishes one side of the ball in a manner and the other side is left without polish
 When one side of the ball is heavily polished and the other side is dropped and inserted quickly, it produces a reverse swing that causes the ball to swing in the opposite direction as in a conventional swing
 lokapriy raay ke vipareet, yah swing isliye utpann nahin hota he kyonki khurdari said kii tulana main hawa chikani yaa "chamakili" said ke upar se tezi se pravaahit hoti he
 The swing is caused by a net force acting on the ball from one side; That is, the side whose boundary layer is more turbulent
 paaramparik swing gendbaazi ke liye, uthaayi gayi seem or jis disha main ise uthaaya gaya he, swing kii disha ko nirdhaarit karte hai
 Due to the angular seam of the ball, the air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on this side, the side on which the seam is twisted
 isse duusari said kii tulana main taral seemaa parat gend kii sataha se alag ho jaati he jahaan lemina kii parat seemaa pehle alag ho jaati he 
 isse ek shuddh dabaav kaa antar utpann ho jaataa he is prakaar se shuddh bal gend ko koniya seem kii disha main gati detaa he or use swing karata he
 Traditional swing bowling is delivered with a seam angle so that the smooth and polished surface of the ball faces to the front, moving the ball in the direction of the seam ie the rough surface
 ek swing karti hui gend ko out swinger kaha jaataa he, agar yah ballebaaz se dur chali jaati he, yaa ise inaswinger kaha jaataa he, agar yah ballebaaz kii taraf jaati he
 In most cases the outswinger is called a more dangerous ball, because if the batsman does not recognize it, it hits the outer edge of the bat instead of hitting it and it is a win slip, it can be easily caught at this stage
 Can
 inaswinger kaa bhi apana mahatva hota he, vishesh rup se tab jab yorker ke saath sanyukt avasthaa main hoti he, kyonki inaswinger balle ke aantarik kinare se takaraati he or wicket ko tod detii he, yaa balle ke bajaay ballebaaz ke pad se takaraati he, jiske parinamswaroop elbeadblyoo kii sambhaavna ho jaati he
 Swing bowling can be broadly classified into an early swing or a late swing, depending on when it changes its direction during its trajectory curve - the later the swing the ball
 As it happens, the probability of the batsman adjusting their shot according to the swing is reduced
 swing gendon ko bhi usee grip or takanic ke saath daalaa jaataa he, jis grip or takanic kaa prayog tej gendbaaz main kiya jaataa he
 However, instead of keeping the seam straight, it is tilted lightly at an angle and a slower grip of the ball can be used
 ek outswinger ke liye gend kii chamakili said ballebaaz ke najadik hoti he or seem uske vipareet disha main kone par jhuki hoti he, jabaki inaswinger ke liye, khurdari said ballebaaz ke najadik honi chahie or seem kaa jhukaav uski ore hona chahie
 ek kattar grip ke saath swing mushkil hota he, chunki gend udaan ke dauraan spin hoti he, khurdari yaa chamakili main se koi bhi sataha ballebaaz ke saamne kii taraf aa sakati he, kyonki yah hawa main udaan bhar rahi hoti he
 Many players, commentators and fans in the game agree that the ball can be swinged more easily in damp or overcast conditions, as well as to be used in Test cricket than the white ball used in one-day matches
 The red ball of the ball swings more
 reverse swing ek aisi ghatana he jiske kaaran gend vipareet disha main swing hoti he
 When the ball is reverse swing, the ball swings to the bright side
 paaramparik swing kii tulana main reverse swing thoda baad main hota he or adhik tezi se hota he, donon hi kaarak ballebaaz kii mushkil ko badha dete hai, jo gend ko hit karne kii taiyaari main hota he
 Reverse swing depends more on conditions than normal swing, so it is almost impossible to achieve it consistently
 aamtaur par reverse swing tab tak nahin hota jab tak gend ko lagbhag 45 over tak kaam main na liya ja chukaa ho or iske liye garm or shushk mausam kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The technique of reverse swing was first discovered by Pakistani bowlers in the 1980s but since then it has spread to all cricket playing countries
 reverse swing main khurdari sataha ko aage ore rakhaa jaataa he
 The seam is tilted at the same angle as in the traditional swing but the boundary layer is turbulent on both sides
 seem or khurdari sataha kaa shuddh prabhaav yah hota he ki gend vastav main us disha ke vipareet swing hoti he jis ore swing mudi hui he
 Good reverse swing bowling requires that the bowler deliver the ball at a very high speed, this speed can be achieved only by the few fast bowlers in the world
 ab, ek divasiy cricket main 35 over ke baad gend ko badalanaa anivaary he, aisa reverse swing ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In this way, it is mandatory for the fielding team to change the ball after 35 overs and hence there is no reverse swing
 dippar ek swing karti hui gend he jise yorker yaa phul toss daalane ke iraade se daalaa jaataa he, parantu yah gendbaaz ke chunaav ke vipareet dippar main badal jaati he
 indipper moves towards the right-handed batsman while outdipper moves away from him
 prabhavi hone ke liye, ek dippar main bahut adhik swing hona chahie, taaki uski gati main bhinnata utpann kii ja sake, kyonki gend pich par bouns nahin ho rahi hoti he
 However, because the batsman usually expects it to be easy to score on a full toss, the dipper is a surprise ball and can be very difficult to play especially if the bowler is very precise and is successful in putting the yorker instead of a full toss
 Let it happen
 ugr yaa aakraamak gendbaazi, gendbaazi kii vah ranneeti he jisamen gendbaaz ballebaaz ko gend se hit karne ke iraade ke saath gend daalata he
 This is to some extent against the rules of cricket, including rules that do not allow excessive use of bouncers, it also does not allow the use of a "beamer", which aims to completely hit the batsman's head
 Have to do
 safal aakraamak gendbaazi main aamtaur par bounsar or short pich delivery kaa mishran hota he, jise ballebaaz ke sir, chaati or pasaliyon ko lakshya banaakar daalaa jaataa he
 The main intention behind this is to divert the batsman's attention so that he makes a mistake and loses his wicket
 aksar wicket kisi bounsar yaa short pich kii gend par nahin girtaa, balki iske bajaay saamaanya delivery par wicket gir jaataa he, jisaki ballebaaz ummid nahin kar rahaa tha, yaa ballebaaz apane saamaanya tareeke se khilne main asafal ho jaataa he 
 It has a prominent approach behind it, aiming at the batsman's chest, licking several short pitched balls, forcing the batsman to defend himself by elevating the bat and playing on the back foot, followed by a fast yorker
 In which the base of the stump is targeted
 agar ballebaaz balle ko unchaa karke pichley pair par khilne kii taiyaari karata he, gendbaaz apni taiyaari ke liye jitna samay letaa he, vah ballebaaz ko dehshat main daalane ke liye paryaapt hota he or is prakaar se vah apana wicket kho saktaa he
 a fast bowler can also bowl aggressively to anger or tease the batsman, in which he bowls the ball aiming at the batsman
 aakraamak gendbaazi kaa upyog har tej gendbaaz ke dwaara alag alag ansh tak kiya jaataa he or yahaan tak ki kabhi kabhi sarvshereshth ballebaaz bhi isamen gambhir rup se ghayal ho jaataa he or khel se baahar jane ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he
 In almost all cases verbal 'abuses' are also attacked with it
 acchhee shrenee ke tej gendbaazon ke dwaara aakraamak ranneeti kaa atyadhik upyog khel kii bhaavana ke anuroop nahin mana jaataa or kai tiimon or khiladiyon ke dwaara iska virodh kiya jaataa he
 An example of its excessive use was the Bodilyn series, in which the then English cricket captain Douglas Jardine attacked the bowling attack of Donald Bradman, the star player of the Australian cricket team
 isamen ve bahut tej or short genden daal rahe the, ballebaaz ke sharir ko lakshya bana rahe the, iske peeche unka iraadaa unhen vyaktigat rup se chot pahunchaana tha
 Several rules of cricket were changed after the Bodilyn series to prevent the use of such tactics in future
 Many fielders who used this type of strategy were banned
 kyonki lagbhag sabhi cricket tiimon main bhinn gati or style ke kai tej gendbaaz hote hai, tej gendbaazi kii takanic na keval maidan ke saath badalati he balki gendbaaz ke saath bhi badalati he
 This technique also changes with the sequence of balls inserted
 sateek ranneeti kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, in karkon main khel kii avasthaa, pich kii avasthaa, mausam or saapeksh urja or gendbaazi karne vaale bhinn khiladiyon kii kushalta kaa str shaamil hai
 Fast bowling requires a lot of energy, most fast bowlers are expected to rest after bowling for four to six overs simultaneously
 Depending on the circumstances, they may need to bowl longer than this, but this usually reduces their effectiveness and makes the bowler tired
 kis prakaar kii gend daali jaayegi or gendon ko kis kram main daalaa jayega, iskaa chunaav khud gendbaaz par nirbhar karata he
 Most sides have a mixture of fast bowlers who specialize in furious and / or seam techniques, and some bowlers specialize in swing
 jab gend nayi hoti he yah aamtaur par bahut kam swing hoti he lekin yah atyadhik gati, bouns or kai prakaar kii seem kaa pradarshan karti he 
 That is why seam bowlers are chosen to bowl with the new ball, seam bowlers are given the opportunity to bowl when the innings begins, or when a new ball is brought during the game
 kshetrarakshan paksh ko 80 over puraani gend se khilne kaa vikalp bhi diya jaataa he
 Conversely, swing bowlers are more effective when the ball starts to reverse swing
 reverse swing gendbaaz 80 over se bhi adhik puraani gend main atyadhik gati utpann kar sakate hai
 Two seam bowlers are usually expected in tandem after the first 10 overs, after which time the ball starts to swing and either or both of them are given the opportunity to swing or spin bowling
 yahi kaaran he ki adhikansh timen kam se kam do seem gendbaaz rakhti hai, jinhen opening gendbaaz kaha jaataa he
 With the old ball, seam bowling usually becomes ineffective and becomes almost useless after 60 overs and as a result, the team should also have spin bowlers with swing
 ek tej gendbaaz kaa kshetrarakshan aamtaur par ugr prakaar kaa hota he, is drushti se aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki iskaa uddeshy wicket lenaa hota he naaki ballebaaz ko ran baanne se rokna
 Occasionally, especially when fielding teams bat later and are trying to score goals, protective fielding is required
 ek saamaanya niyam ke anusaar surakshatmak tej gendbaazi karnaa mushkil kaam he- yah kaam spin gendbaazon ke liye behatar hota he
 Various fast bowling techniques can dismiss a batsman in three ways
 ve yaa to gati ke saath bold yaa elbeadblyoo kiye ja sakate hai, yorker yaa seem yaa swing ke dwaara gend ko ballebaaz kii taraf daalaa ja saktaa he, is sandarbh main kshetrarakshak kii niyukti apraasangik he
 The swing or seam can be used to push the ball away from the batsman, in which case the ball will hit the outer edge of the bat and can be caught during the flight
 ek buree tarah se khelaa jane vaala bounsar yaa to bahari kinare se takaraata he yaa upar chalaa jaataa he yaa iske parinamswaroop shot khilne kaa samay gadabada saktaa he or ise boundry ke paas kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the most effective fielders for aggressive fast bowling are deployed in the outfield and slip cordons and gullies, as the batsman is most likely to be caught in these situations
 outfield main kshetrarakshakon ko tainaat karne kaa atirit phayda hota he, isse ballebaaz ke liye un sthanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he, jahaan vah boundry main ran score kar sake
 Other close fielding conditions such as silly mid on / off and many midwicket situations are usually unnecessary
 iske vipareet, tej gendbaazi ke liye ek rakshaatmak kshetra ballebaaz ke chaaron or kai sthitiyon ko pack kar detaa he jaise gulii, point or puraa sarkal
 One or two slips and one or two outfielder remain in the catch position
 kyonki aamtaur par ballebaaz jameen par shot lagane kii koshish karata he taaki kaich ke jokhim se batch sake, is prakaar ke kshetrarakshan main puure field ko itnaa band kar liya jaataa he ki agar ballebaaz ek prayaas bhi kare to use ran out kiya ja sake
 Defensive fast bowling is a difficult task because a skilled batsman is prepared for this type of technique and scores runs from the boundary when he hits the midwicket ring or away from an existing outfielder
 kisi bhi gendbaaz kaa praathmik lakshya hota he, ballebaaz kaa wicket lenaa
 The second goal is to stop him from scoring runs
 The second one often paves the way for the first one, because when the batsman does not know how to score runs, he gets upset and tries to put a risky shot to score
 iske alaava, aamtaur par ballebaaz ko ran banane se rokane ke liye ek gendbaaz lagaataar ek hi ballebaaz ke liye genden daalata he, use kisi prakaar ke takneekee anukram kii sthapana kaa avasar detaa he
 Accordingly, consistently bowling the wicket is not an appropriate approach for a fast bowler, as it gives a clear and easy response to the batsman
 ballebaaz apane wicket ko bachaa letaa he or buree gend kaa bhi saamana kar letaa he
 Another approach behind this is to create uncertainty by bowling a line and length, so that the batsman is not able to decide whether to attack or defend himself
 In a mixed type of delivery, the batsman does not get what the next ball will be like
 ek acchhee gendbaazi main adhikansh genden aamtaur par swing yaa seem hoti hai, jo qamar kii unchai tak aati hai, of stump ke baahar aakar ballebaaz se dur chali jaati hai, kyonki yahi vah kshetra he jahaan ballebaaz ke liye sabase uchit pratikriya dena mushkil hota he
 Common variations and their strategies are discussed below
 ek over ke dauraan gendbaaz ke dwaara chuni sateek genden match kii sthiti par nirbhar karti hai, ye ballebaaz kii kushalta par bhi nirbhar karti hai, saath hi is baat par bhi nirbhar karti hai ki ballebaaz kitni der se kris par tikaa hua he
 It is easy to attack a batsman who has just come to the wicket, he can be attacked with the help of a bouncer and a short pitch to get him out and prevent him from sticking to the offensive batting for long
 
 short genden us ballebaaz ke liye jokhim bhari hoti hai, jo kris par tik chukaa he, kyonki ve aasaan boundry lete hai, lekin adhikansh gendbaaz phir bhi mishrit genden daalate hai, taaki ballebaaz anumaan lagane kaa prayaas karata rahe
 Most batsmen try to take a front or back foot shot and this affects the bowler's choice of ball
 short gend ko front foot par khelnaa mushkil hota he isliye gendbaaz us ballebaaz ke liye short gend ko praathamikta dete hai, jo front foot par kheltaa he
 Similarly, the yorker and full pitch ball are difficult to play on the back foot so this type of delivery is used for back footed batsmen
 agar ek gendbaaz safaltaapurvak ballebaaz ke vipaksh main is prakaar kii gende lagaataar daalata he, vah achaanak vipareet prakaar kii gend daal kar ballebaaz ko hairaan kar saktaa he-kai short pich ke baad ek yorker yaa kai phul gendon ke baad ek bounsar
 jo ballebaaz acha prekshak nahin hota vah aisi sthiti main anjaane main apana wicket kho detaa he
 Another variation, especially for a batsman who has stayed on the wicket and is starting to run independently, is to change the attack line from just outside the off stump and bowl directly to the leg stump
 ballebaaz ko is prakaar ke gendon ke liye uchit pratikriya kerani hoti he kyonki yaa to vah ran le saktaa he yaa elbeadblyoo ke jokhim par hota he, parantu jab vah aisa karata he uskaa balla leg said ke upar aata he or of said ko asurakshit chhod detaa he
 If the bowler can generate enough speed on the off side with swing or seam technique, it often hits the outer edge of the bat and starts directly on the stump
 yah yaad rakhana chahie ki gendbaazi main hairaan karnaa ek bada avyav he, gendbaaz aksar ballebaaz ko bhram main daalane ke liye in aam ranneetiyon kaa upyog karte hai, taaki vah galat shot lagaaye
 For example, putting the yorker on a new batsman who was expecting a bouncer, or at least the standard line and length ball, gets many bowlers out for the first ball
 maanav kaa sharir tej gendbaazi kaa boj nahin le saktaa
 Fast bowling causes great pressure on the entire body, especially on the legs, back and shoulders
 isamen sharir ke bahut se hisse chot ke jokhim main aa jate hai
 There is a possibility of fracture of the ankle, because when the foot falls on the ground at the time of delivery, there is a lot of pressure on it
 peeth main spasm or strain kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki gend kii delivery ke samay sharir ko ek chaap main ghumaya jaataa he
 There is a possibility of rupture of the tendon muscle because there is a sudden jerk on the shoulder just before the ball is inserted

 ganit main samishra sankhyaayein vaastavik sankhyaon kaa vistaar he
 Adding an imaginary part to a real number makes a complex number
 samishra sankhya ke kaalpanik bhaag ke saath i judaa hota he jo nimnlikhit sambandh ko santusht karti he: Any complex number can be expressed as a + bi, in which both a and b are real numbers
 a + bi main a ko vaastavik bhaag tathaa b ko kaalpanik bhaag kehete hai
 Example: 3 + 4i is a complex number
 samishra sankhya ko a + bi ke rup main darshane ko samishra sankhya kaa kartiya swaroop kehete he
 The complex number z = x + iy can also be represented as polar coordinates
 dhruviya nirdeshaank r = |z| ≥ 0, ko samishra sankhya kaa nirpeksh maan yaa mapank kehete hai
 Similarly, φ = arg is called the angle of z
 konank φ = konank mukhya maan ke bich main chaiye to us rinatmak maan main 2π jodakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The following forms are called polar forms: ise cis φ se bhi nirupit karte hai jo cos φ + i sin φ kaa sankshipt rup he
 You can also write it using Euler's formula in the following way: is swaroop ko ixponancial rup' kehete hai
 In electronics, the angular representation of a complex number for a phasor is often used
 jisamen a aayam evam θ kala he
 Keep in mind that j is used instead of i in electronics and electrical engineering because electric current is represented by i
 The absolute value of a complex number z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{i \ phi }} is defined as | z | = r { \ displaystyle |z|=r} 
 Algebraically, if z = x + y i { \ displaystyle z=x+yi}, then | z | = x 2 + y 2 
 { \ displaystyle |z|={ \ sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}
} The absolute value has three important properties: for all complex numbers z and w
 These imply that | 1 | = 1 { \ displaystyle |1|=1} and | z / w | = | z | / | w | { \ displaystyle |z / w|=|z| / |w|} 
 By defining the distance function d = | z − w | { \ displaystyle d=|z-w|}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a metric space and we can therefore talk about limits and continuity
 The complex conjugate of the complex number z = x + yi { \ displaystyle z = x + yi} is defined to be x - yi { \ displaystyle x-yi}, written as z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}} } or z ∗ { \ displaystyle z ^ {*} \ ,}
 As seen in the figure, z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} is the "reflection" of z about the real axis, and so both z + z ̄ { \ displaystyle z + { \ bar {z xxrep 4 } and z ⋅ z ̄ { \ displaystyle z \ cdot { \ bar {z}}} are real numbers
 Many identities relate complex numbers and their conjugates: c + d i ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle c+d \ , \ mathrm {i} eq 0} Yoga: ghataana: Multiplication: bhaag: The n { \ displaystyle n} power of z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ { \ mathrm {i} \ varphi}} is derived as yaa kartiya rup z = a + b i { \ displaystyle z=a+b \ mathrm {i} } ke liye The general formula for a complex exponent on a complex basis is: yahan ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ ln} samishra gaghuganak kaa mukhya maan liya jaayegaa
 a lot of caution is required here; See - nimnlikhit sutara samishra sankhya z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{ \ mathrm {i} \ phi }} kaa n { \ displaystyle n} vaan mul nikaalane ke liye prayukt hota he: Where the value of k { \ displaystyle k} is 0, 1,


, n - 1 { \ displaystyle 0,1, \ ldots, n-1}
 is prakaar kisi sankhya ke n { \ displaystyle n} wein mulon kii kul sankhya n { \ displaystyle n} hoti he
 The prime value of the natural logarithm of the complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ {i \ phi}} will be: antim vaala sutara kisi samishra sankhya kaa vyutkram nikaalane ke liye bahut upyogi he, yadi vah sankhya kartiya rup main di gayi he
