 70,000 parsi dharm iran kaa pracheen kaal se prachlit dharm he
 This zand is based on the scripture named Avesta
 iske prasthaapak mahatma zarathushtra hai, isaliye is dharm ko zarathustri dharm bhi kehete hai
 Now only a few parts of Zand Avesta are available
 iske sabase puraane bhaag rugveda ke turant baad ke kaal ke ho sakate hai
 Its language is Avestan language, which is very much similar to Sanskrit language
 parsi dharm kii shiksha haih humat, hukht, huvarsht jo sanskrit main sumat, sookt, suvartan athwa subuddhi, subhash, suvyavahaar hua
 Parsis believe in a god called Ahura Mazda
 unka varnan vaidic devtaa varun se kaafii mail khaataa he
 Agni is considered as a god and is very holy
 usee ke madhyam se ahura mazda kii puja hoti he
 Parsi temples are called Atish Behram
 spenta amesha inke saat 
farishte hai
 Varigod parsi vishwaas ke mutabik ahura mazda kaa dushman dusht angira manyu he
 Zoroastrianism was once the religion of Iran
 unhone hindustan main sharan lee
 Since then, the Zoroastrians have contributed immensely to the rise of India
 pracheen faras jab purvi europe se madhya asia tak failaa ek vishaal samrajya tha, tab paigambar zarathustra ne ek ishwarwad kaa sandesh dete hue parsi dharm kii neenv rakhi
 Detailed history is not known about Zarathustra and his followers
 kaaran yah ki pehle sikandar kii phujon ne tathaa baad main arab akramanakariyon ne pracheen faras kaa lagbhag sara dharmik evam saanskrithik sahitya nasht kar daalaa tha
 Everything we know about this history today is due to the inscription and textual tradition engraved in the mountains of Iran
 saatvin sadi isvi tak aate-aate farsi samrajya apana puraatan vaibhav tathaa shakti ganvaa chukaa tha
 When the Arabs won a decisive victory over it, in order to protect their religion, many Zoroastrians fled through the religious sea and took refuge on the west coast of India
 yahan ve 'parsi' kehalaae
 Today, there are only between 125 and 1
5 lakh people in the world
 inamen se aadhe se adhik bharat main hai
 Pangbar Zarathustra traveled far and wide to deliver his message during the reign of the Persian emperor Vishtasp
 unke anusaar ishwar ek hi he 
 Zarathustra called this god 'ahura Mazda' i
e
 'great Life Giver'
 ahura majadaa koi vyakti nahin he, balki satv he, shakti he, urja he
 According to Zarathustra, there is a constant struggle between two primordial souls in the world
 inamen ek he ahura majadaa kii aatma, 'spenta manu'
 The second is the evil spirit 'anghara Menu'
 is dusht aatma ke naash hetu hi ahura majadaa ne apni saat kritiyon yatha akaash, jal, prithvi, vanaspati, pashu, maanav evam agni se is bhautik vishwa kaa srijan kiya
 They knew that due to their destructive nature and ignorance, the Anghara menu would attack this world and would enter into chaos, untruth, sorrow, cruelty, sickness and death
 manushya, jo ki ahura majadaa kii sarvshereshth kriti he, kii is sangharsh main kendriya bhoomika he
 He has to voluntarily take on the evil spirit in this struggle
 is yuddh main uske astr honge achchhai, satya, shakti, bhakthi, adarsh evam amartv
 By following these principles, humans will eventually end all the evil in the world
 kuch adhik vaigyanik kasuti par dharm ko parakhane vaale 'spenta manu' kii vyakhya alag tarah se karte hai
 According to it, the 'spenta menu' is not a soul, but an incremental, progressive mind or mindset
 arthath yah ahura majadaa kaa ek gun he, vah gun jo brahmand kaa nirmaan evam sanvardhan karata he
 God created the spenta menu so that a happy world could be created
 pragatisheel maansikta hi prithvi par manushyon ko do virgon main baantati he
 The virtuous, who promote the world and the vicious, who stop its progress
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki prayek vyakti ishwar tulya bane, jeevandaayee urja ko apanaae tathaa nirmaan, sanvardhan evam pragati kaa vaahak bane
 According to the teachings of Prophet Zarathustra, the world is a moral system
 is vyavastha ko swayan ko kaayam hi nahin rakhana he, balki apana vikaas tathaa sanvardhan bhi karnaa he
 Inertia is not allowed in Zarathosti religion
 vikaas kii prakriya main buree takatein baadha pahunchaati hai, parantu manushya ko isse vichlit nahin hona he
 He has to keep moving in the direction of development always while maintaining the path of virtue
 jivan ke prayek kshan kaa ek nishchit uddeshy he
 It is not something that starts spontaneously and ends spontaneously
 sab kuch ishwar kii yojana ke anusaar hota he
 Supreme goodness should be the aim of our life
 manushya ko achchhai se, achchhai dwaara, achchhai ke liye jeena he
 'humat', 'huqt' and 'huvarshat' are the pillars of the Zarthosti way of life
 jarathosti dharm main mathvaad, brahmacharya, vrath-upwas, aatm daman aadi kii manaahi he
 It is believed that they weaken humans and reduce their strength to fight against evil
 nirashavad va avsaad ko to paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 Zarathustra wants humans to enjoy this world fully and be happy
 vah jo bhi kare, bas ek baat kaa khyaal avashya rakhe or vah yah ki sadachaar ke maarg se kabhi vichlit na ho
 a life endowed with material comforts is not forbidden, but it has also been said that you give more than what you take from the society
 kisi kaa haq markar yaa shoshan karke kuch paanaa duraachaar he
 Those who are less rich than us should always help
 jarathosti dharm main daihik mrityu ko buraai kii asthaayee jeet mana gaya he
 After this, the soul of the deceased will be judged
 yadi vah sadaachari hui to anand va prakaash main vaas paaegi or yadi duraachaari hui to andhkaar va nairashya kii gaharaaiyon main jaaegi, lekin duraachaari aatma kii yah sthiti bhi asthaayee he
 After all, Zoroastrian religion considers the ultimate aim of the world to be the victory of good, not the punishment of evil
 atah yah manyata he ki antat kai muktidaata aakar buraai par achchhai kii jeet puri karenge
 Then Ahura Mazda will be well-supported as Aseem Prakash
 phir atmaaon kaa antim faisla hoga
 After this the physical body will be resurrected and reunited with its own soul
 samay kaa astitv samaapt ho jayega or ahura majadaa kii saat kritiyaan shaashvat dhanyata main ek saath aa milengi or aanandamay, anshwar astitv ko praapt karengi

 However, according to the poet's mention, the inspiration to create this epic got him from Adikavi Valmiki
 unhone likhaa he ki The story of the first half of this period has some resemblance to the Valmiki Ramayana, but in the latter, the poet's personal origin and system is the main one
 is kavy ke madhyam se kavi kaa paanditya pradarshit hua he
 From the point of view of dialogue-planning, ornament-planning, verses-planning, this poem presents the skill of the poet's master

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 The entire house runs at the signal of a smart home controller
 ye niyantrak ek remote kii tarah kaam karata he jisase ghar kaa taapmaana aadi bhi vyavasthit ho jaataa he

 Even when people are not present in the house, this house remains stationed in its work
 yah ghar keval suraksha hi nahin balki aaraam dene kaa bhi kaam karte hai

 kuch logon ko yah suvidhaayen pasand aati hai lekin kuch kaa kahana he ki inase shaareerik kriya main rukaawat aati he or logon main aramtlabi kii aadat badhati he
 But these facilities are good for those who are physically intact

 Taal is an optical device that works on the principle of refraction of light
 taal goleey, belanaakaar aadi jaise niyamit, jyamiti rup kii do satahon se ghira hua paardarshak madhyam, jisase apvartan ke pashchaat kisi vastu kaa vaastavik athwa kaalpanik pratibimb banataa he, taal kehalaata he
 The convex palate is of the shape of lentils
 taal kii sataha praaia: goleey hoti he, parantu aavashyaktaanusaar belanaakar, yaa agoli taal bhi prayukt hote hai
 The only natural rhythm is the crystalline rhythm of the eye
 hajaaron varsh pehle bhi log taal ke vishay main jaanate the or mikenor ke anusaar pracheen kaal main bhi chashme se laabh uthaaya jaataa tha
 Apart from eyeglasses, in optics, rhythm is used in telescopes, microscopes, lighthouses, binoculars etc
 taal ko mukhya rup se do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, a parallel ray coming from infinity converges at a point f after a refraction in a convex lens, making an actual image there; Whereas after refraction in the concave rhythm, they appear to be diverted by imaginary reflections on the point "F"
 at: uttal taal ko 'abhisari taal' or avatal taal ko 'apsaari taal' bhi kehete hai
 It is necessary to know here that the convex rhythm acts as the convergent rhythm and the concave rhythm as the divergent rhythm only when the refractive index of the medium around it is lower than the refractive index of the medium of the rhythm
 = 1
5, hawa kaa apvartanaank, mu = 1
00 hota he)
 If the refractive index of the four-way medium is greater than the refractive index of the medium, then the convex rhythm will converge and the concave pool converge
 kisi taal kii focus duuri nimnlikhit sutara se nikaali ja sakati he
 This sutra is called the rhythm-maker's sutra
 jahaan If the value of d is smaller than that of R1 and R2, it will be called a 'thin cadence'
 iske liye focus duuri kaa sutara is prakaar hoga The problem of optical chromatic aberration is found in lenses
 bahut si sthitiyon main do poorak varna-vipathan vaale lenson ke sanyog se is samasya ko bahut seemaa tak hataaya ja saktaa he
 If simple lenses of different size and different material are placed one after the other in order, then it is called compound rhythm
 sabase saral sthiti vah he jisamen taal ek duusare ke satakar rakhe jany
 If two thin magnets with f1 and f2 focus distance are placed, then the value of f their combined focus distance will be derived from the following formula- chunki 1 / f ko taal kii shakti kaha jaataa he, isaliye kaha ja saktaa he ki yugmit karne par lenson kii shaktiyaan bhi jud jaati he
 But if two thin rhythms are kept at a distance d, then the focus distance of the joint rhythm system will come out of this formula - chashmen kaa taal patala hota he or ise bhi pehle bataai hui reeti se hi banaate hai
 But its surface does not have to be as accurate as the surface of lenses used in visionary and photography
 taal ke kinaaron ko pathar ke pahie par ghiskar chashmen ke frem ke aakaar kaa bana lete hai
 a concave pool is used to remove myopia and a convex pool is used to remove myopia

 The space between the eye and the eye is filled with a suitable fluid
 svachhmandal ke shankvakar ho jane, yaa sikud jane par bhi sampark taal lagaaya jaataa he
 It requires a lot of care and money to set up a connection
 prakaash stambh ke taal bahut bade or mote hote hai
 It is not possible to create such a big and thick rhythm as described earlier
 duusare, taal bada tathaa motaa hone ke kaaran itnaa baari ho jaataa he ki itnaa baari taal bananaa bhi uchit nahin he
 In 1820 Augustine Frennel explained the method of making laces used in the lighthouse
 uchit vakrata kii, kaanch kii chhadon ko alag alag ghisa or chamakaana kiya jaataa he
 Then they are sequenced in a metal frame to form a lighthouse pool
 kabhi-kabhi kaanch ko galaakar tathaa saanche main dhalkar bhi frenel taal banaae jate hai
 Such pools are used in Punjprakash, railroad, traffic signs etc
 san 1945 ke baad plastic padaarthon ko galaakar patale frenel taal bhi banaae gaye, jo praaia: abhikshetra taal ke rup main prayukt hote hai
