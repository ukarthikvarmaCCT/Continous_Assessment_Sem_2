 Later alchemists used classical elements, the concept of anima mundi, and composition stories presented in texts such as Plato's Timaeus as an analogy to their process
 plato ke anusaar, chaar tatv araajaktaa se jude ek saamaanya strot yaa prima materia se praapt hote hai
 Alchemists called prima materia also assign the initial component to the philosopher's stone construction

 Jabir himself is believed to be the inventor of aqua regia, a mixture of muriatic and nitric acid, one of the few substances that can dissolve gold
 11 veen shatabdi main, muslim vishwa ke rasayanavidon ke bich bahes hui thi ki padaarthon kaa transmishan sambhav tha yaa nahin
 a major rival was the Persian polymer Avicenna, who rejected the theory of the transmission of substances, "those of the chemical craft are well aware that there can be no change in different species of substances, although they can produce The presence of such change
 " According to legend, 13th century scientist and philosopher Albertus Magnus discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it around 1280 shortly before his death to his student Thomas Aquinas

 CAG is the genetic code for amino acid glutamine, so a series of these produces a series of glutamines called the polyglutamine pathway and a polyq portion, a repeated fragment of the gene
 aam taur par, logon ke policyuu kshetra main 36 punrarit glutmine se kam glutmine hote hai jo cytoplasmik protein hantington ke utpaadan main parinat hota he
 However, a chain of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein that has distinct characteristics

 In Huntington's disease, autosomal is a strong heredity, ie the affected individual specifically receives a copy of the gene with a detailed trinucleotide frequency, especially from his or her parents
 chunki utparivartan kaa antarvedhan atyant ucch hota he jin kii utparivarti prati vaala vyakti rog se grast hota he
 In this type of inheritance sample, each offspring of a affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting mutant alleles and therefore being affected by the disorder
 This possibility is gender-free
 28 se adhik kii trinucliotide CAG aavritiyaan pratikruti ke dauraan asantulit hoti hai or yah asantulan maujuud punrariti kii sankhya ke saath badhati rahati he
 This often leads to new expansions as generations pass, rather than producing an exact copy of the trinucleotide frequency
 iske kaaran kramagat pidiyon main punrariti kii sankhya main is tarah parivartan hota he ki "madhyavarti" sankhya, yaa "kam antarvedhan" sahit koi aprabhavit mata yaa pita purnatah antarvedhi HD utpann karne vaali punrariti kii sankhya main vruddhi sahit jin kii prati ko aage badha sakate hai
 This type of increase in the number of recurrences in successive generations cannot pass through the cell-skeleton
 Finally, over time, as neuronal inclusions increase, the neurotransmitters available to signal to other neurons become less
 samaveshi pind, koshikeey nabhik or koshikadravya, donon main paae gaye hai
 Inclusive nodules in brain cells are one of the earliest deformable changes, and some experiments have shown that they may be toxic to cells, but other experiments show that they can become part of the body's defense mechanisms
 And can be helpful in protecting cells
 kai pathon kii pahchaan kii gai he jinke dwaara mhtt koshika kii mrityu kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which are helpful in disintegrating proteins and removing scattered proteins; Interaction with caspases, which play a role in the removal of cells; Toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; Loss of energy production within cells; And effect on the appearance of genes
 The toxic effect of mhtt on cells increases strongly due to the interaction with a protein called Race, which is mainly manifested in the striatum
 paaya gaya ki res mhtt ke suumoylation ko prerit karti he, jo protein pind ko tod detii he-koshika sanvardhan adhyayanon ne jataayaa ki asamucchit rup se pind kam vishakt hai
 According to an additional theory, which explains how HD inhibits cell functions, damage of mitochondria in striatal cells and the interaction of the Huntingtin protein with several proteins in the neuron promotes glutamine hypersensitivity, which is very high Amounts were found as excitotoxins
 excitotoxin anek koshikeey sanrachanaon ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he
 Although glutamine was not found in extremely high amounts, it has been assumed that due to increased hypersensitivity, normal amounts of glutamine may also produce excitotoxins

 HD affects specific areas of the brain
 sabase pramukh praarambhik prabhaav niostriatum kahalaane vaale aadhaarik gandikaon ke hisson par padataa he or jo puchchal nabhik or kavach se nirmit hota he
 Other affected areas include the black matter, the third, fifth and sixth layers of the cerebellar vulva, the hippocampus, the alveolar cells in the cerebellum, the lateral cylindrical nucleus of the tibia, and the parts of the thalamus
 These are affected by the neuron involved and their structure, as they lose cells, their size decreases
 in kshetron main hote hai ve neuron main se ek hai prabhavit anusaar prakaar or unki sanrachana, aakaar main kam karne ke rup main ve kakshon kho dete hai
 Striatal prickly neurons are the most vulnerable, especially those tending toward the outer globus pallidus, whose hooked spiny cells on the enduron and the inner pallidum are less affected
 HD estrociton main bhi asaamaanya vruddhi kaa kaaran banataa he
 The basal ganglia — the part of the brain most prominently affected by HD — plays an important role in motion and behavioral control
 unke kaaryon ko puri tarah nahin samajha gaya he, lekin maujuuda siddhant prastaavit karte hai ki ve sangyanatmak kaaryakari pranali or motor circuit kaa hissaa hai
 The basal ganglia typically disrupt circuits that produce specific motions
 kisi vishisht harakat ko aarambh karne ke liye, pramastishkeey vahya sanrachana dwaara aadhaarik gandika ko sanket bheja jaataa he jo avrodh jari karne kaa kaaran banataa he
 Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release and reinstatement of the inhibition to be irregular and uncontrolled, which may prevent the awkward start of the gait or inadvertently stop the gait or the motion before or after its designated completion
 is kshetra main pahunch rahi kul kshati HD se judi lakshanik aniyat chaal ko anjaam detii he
 The basal ganglia can be damaged in two ways: directly and indirectly
 In the direct pathway, fewer neurotransmitters are sent to the inner globus pallidus, incorporating it as a reduction in inhibition, by which more neurotransmitters are released than normal
 chetak, jo asankhya neurotransmeter praapt karte hai, nirodhak ho jate hai or is prakaar gatijanak praantastha ko kam neurotransmeter bhejtaa he
 Finally, the motile cortex is less stimulated and the motion is lower than normal
 apratyaksh maarg bahya globas paleads dwaara kam neurotransmeter kii prapti se shuru hota he or badale main, iske prati pratikraya kam ho jaati he kyonki kam pratirodh vaala sanket adhik neurotransmeter jari karata he
 The subcutaneous nucleus, which receives signals from the external globus pallidus, releases the IGP, less neurotransmitters, than the more neurotransmitters received
 ab IGP kaaphi nirodhak hote hai kyonki STN kaa kaary IGP ko uttejit karnaa hai or isliye IGP kam neurotransmeter jari karata he
 In this context, low neurotransmitter capture by the thalamus is considered a low barrier
 ant main, gatijanak praantastha adhik neurotransmeter praapt karti he or atiuttejit ho jaati he, jisase jatkedaar harakatein paidaa hoti he, jo korea main saamaanya he
 Because there are two different types of neuron in the striatum, a different type of neuron, which is targeted to a different neuron and lobe, is stimulated in each pathway and thus both can move together
 aam taur par apratyaksh maarg pehle prabhavit hota he, jiske kaaran korea pehle lakshanon main se ek he, lekin antat, donon prakaar ke neuron mar jate hai or gati kaaphi simit ho jaati hai
 The creb-binding protein, a transcription factor, is important for the functioning of cells, as a significant number of promoters as co-catalysts initiate the transcription of genes for the survival pathway
 iske alaava, CBP kaa nirmaan karne vaale amino acid main ek strip 18 glutamine shaamil he
 Thus, glutamine on CBP interacts directly with glutamine with an increased number on the Htt chain and CBP is removed from its common position near the nucleus
 vishesh rup se, CRB main ek aseetlatransfares kaaryakshetra shaamil hota he, jisane stefan or saathiyon dwaara kiye gaye ek prayog main yah darshaya ki CBP main 51 glutminon ke saath Htt ekson 1 is kaaryakshetra se bandhe hai
 Incredible amounts of CBP were also found in autopsied brains of individuals who had Huntington's disease
 iske atirikt, jab CBP adhik prakat hota he, poliglootmine se prerit maut kam hoti hai, jo aage yah darshata he ki CBP saamaanya rup se hantington rog or neuron main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Medical diagnosis of the onset of HD can be made after the appearance of specific physical symptoms of the disease
 parivaar main HD kaa koi itihaas uplabdh na ho to shaareerik nidaan kii pushti karne ke liye anuvanshik pareekshan kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm whether an individual or fetus is carrying an extended copy of the trinucleotide iteration in the disease-causing HTT gene
 Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance during the entire screening process and the implications of a definitive diagnosis

 The late onset of Huntington's disease means that it generally does not affect reproduction
 The prevalence of HD is 5–10 persons per million population worldwide, but they differ geographically as a result of ethnicity, local migration, and past immigration patterns

 The first complete description of the disease was presented in 1872 by George Huntington
 Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, they understood that their conditions must be linked; He presented the detailed and precise definition of the disease as his first document
 anjaane main, hantington ne mendeleey vanshanukram ke punaranveshan ke barason pehle, ek alingsutri prabal rog ke vanshanukram ke sateek swaroop kaa varnan kiya
 "regarding his hereditary nature
 When either or both of the parents have demonstrated the manifestation of the disease

 But if by chance these children do not get this disease in life, then the formula is broken and grandchildren / grand-grandchildren and great-grandchildren / great-grandparents of the original kindred are sure that they are suffering from the disease
 Are free "
 Sir William Osler was interested in this disorder and in Korea in general, and he was impressed by the Huntington document that" in the history of medicine, this There are very few examples where a disease is described more accurately, more lively or more succinctly
 "osler's continued interest in HD combined with his influence in the field of medicine, the disorder throughout the medical community Luis Theophil Joseph Landauzi, desire-magloer Bourneville, Camilo Golgi and Joseph Jules de In Europe, including Jerin went seeing a lot of interest by scientists, 19veen sadi ke ant tak, HD ke sambandh main shodh evam report kai deshon main prakashit ho chuke the evam rog kii pahchaan ek vishwavyaapee sthiti ke rup main kii ja chuki thi
 During the redesign of Mendel's inheritance in the 20th century, HD was temporarily used as an autosomal dominant inheritance
 English biologist William Batson used the genealogy of the affected family to discover that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern

 Davenport used this information to provide evidence of the different age and range of onset of HD symptoms and to claim that the majority of HD cases in the United States can be found in a handful of individuals

 The claim of well-established and eugenic bias from the works of the earliest parents Monkey, Davenport and Vessie contributed to the confusion and prejudice regarding HD
 Monkey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in ancient times some individuals affected by HD may have been thought to be under the control of spirits or victims of witchcraft and were sometimes express or expelled by society

 Research regarding the disorder systematically continued into the 20th century, achieving a major critical discovery in 1983 when the United states-venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project discovered the adjacent location of an accidental gene
 This was the result of a detailed study initiated in 1979, which focused on two isolated Venezuelan villages, such as the Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where the disease was unusually high

 In 1993, the research group isolated the actual contingency gene at 4p16
3, making it the first autosomal disease location achieved using genetic linkage analysis
 In the same timeframe, major discoveries were being made regarding the mechanism of the disorder, including the findings of Anita Harding's research group concerning the effects of gene length

 Incorrect scattering of mhtt segments in 1997 led to the detection of nuclear insertions they produce
 These advances have led to progressively more detailed research regarding the proteins involved in the disease, possible drug treatments, methods of care and the genes themselves

 Issues of genetic testing include these definitions of how mature a person must be before they are eligible for testing, how testing confidentiality will be ensured, and companies needing test results to decide on employment, life insurance or other financial matters
 Use should be allowed or not
 Controversy arose when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control of people suffering from certain diseases, including HD, be done as part of the social movement
 There are some issues related to the use of embryos in artificial fertilization
 kuch HD anusandhanon main apane pashu pareekshan or bhruneey vansh koshikaon ke prayog ke kaaran naitik mudde bhi he
 The development of an accurate diagnostic test for Huntington's disease has raised social, legal, and ethical concerns about the use and accessibility of an individual's results

 Financial institutions and businesses are facing the question of whether to use the results of a genetic test to assess a person's life insurance or employment
 UK insurance companies have agreed that until 2014 they will not use this information in most cases of insurance writing
 As with other incurable genetic conditions, with the possibility of later onset, it would be ethically objectionable to have pre-symptomatic testing done on a child or adolescent as it would not receive medical benefit
 There is a general consensus for testing only those individuals who are considered mature in terms of knowledge, although there is a counter argument that parents have the right to make decisions on behalf of their child
 prabhavi upachaar ke abhaav main, kanoonee umr se kam vyakti kaa pareekshan sakasham nahin mana jaataa he, ise zyaadaatar maamalon main aniatik mana jaataa he

 udhaaharan ke liye, prasavpurv pareekshan chaynaatmak garbhpaat kaa mudda uthaata he, jo kai logo ko asweekaarya he
 The use of pre-planting testing for HD requires embryos twice the number of embryos used for artificial fertilization, because half of them will be positive for HD
 Difficulties may arise in situations where a parent does not want to know their own diagnosis for a dominant disease, as parts of the process will be kept secret from the parents

 Mice and monkeys were used to demonstrate hd-like symptoms by chemical induction, but they did not mimic the initial signs of the disease
 Since the identification of the Huntington gene, transgenic animals representing hd-like traits can be generated by CAG frequency coverage in genes

 aamtaur par iskaa prayog tab karte hai jab mahila kii andwahi naliyaan band hone hai yaa jab mard bahut kam shukranu paidaa kar paata he
 In this process, many times, eggs donated by others, donated semen or already frozen mbarayas are also used
 daan main die gaye andon kaa prayog un striyon ke liye kiya jaataa he he jo ki anda utpann nahin kar paatin
 Similarly, the eggs or semen donated in charity are also sometimes used for women who have a congenital disease in which the child is also afraid of getting it

 The success rate starts decreasing with age
 aayu ke atirikt bhi safalataa kii dar badalati rahati he or anya kai baton par bhi nirbhar karti he
 The success rate of technology varies and also depends on many other things
 takanic kii safalataa dar ko prabhavit karne vaali chizon main shaamil he - The process was first used in the world by Patrick Stapo and Robert Edwards in the United Kingdom
 unke is prakriya se janme bachche kaa naam louis brown tha jiskaa janm 25 july, 1978 ko manchester main hua tha
 This process was used by Dr
 Subhash Mukhopadhyay for the first time in India
 aaj ye takanic nissantan dampattiyon ke liye ek nayi aashaa kii kiran he
 The test tube produced by him was Durga, the second test tube baby in the world
 is takanic dwaara manachaahe gunon vaali santan or bahut se rogon se jivan paryant surakshit santan utpann karne ke prayaas bhi jari he
 Many efforts have also been successful
 aarambhik daur main ivief kaa istemaal mahilaon main fallopin tub kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke taur par kiya jaataa he, lekin baad main isaki aisi takanic bhi viksit kii gai, jo purushon kii napunsakata kaa bhi ilaaj karti ho
 Currently IVF has a number of technologies in operation including ICSI, ZIFT, GIFT and PGD
 isiesai kaa prayog us sthiti main kiya jaataa he jab andon kii sankhya kam hoti he yaa phir shukranu, andanu se kriya karne laayak behatar avasthaa main nahin hote
 In this, the sperms are injected directly into the ovaries by the micromanipulation technique
 jedft main mahila ke andanuon ko nikaal kar unhen nishechit kar mahila ke garbhashay main sthapit karne ke bajaae uske fallopin tachub main sthapit kiya jaataa he
 The process of IVF is completed in the form of superovulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer
 iskaa prayog ve mahilaayein bhi kar sakati hai jinamein rajonivritti ho chuki he or fallopian tub band ho cheke hai
 Thus, this facility proves to be a boon
 jed ai epa tii bhi ai ve epa ke sadrush hota he
 The quotation is done in the laboratory
 tab ati sadhy bhrun ko garbhashay kii apeksha fallopian tub main daal diya jaataa he
 Under GIFT, eggs and semen are transferred to the oviduct tube of the woman
 urvaran mahila ke sharir main hi hota he
 In ICSI, only one sperm is injected into the fertilized egg
 tab bhrun ko garbhashay yaa andwahi tub main transfer kiya jaataa he
 It is used for couples who have severe semen disease
 kabhi kabhi iskaa upyog aayu main bade dampatiyon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he yaa jinka ai ve epa kaa prayaas asafal rahaa ho
 IVF can be used to treat infertility in women due to problems with the fallopian tubes, as fertilization is difficult within the body in such situations
 yah vidhi purush bandhyataa main bhi sahaayak ho sakati he, jahaan shukranuon kii gunvattta main kharabi ho
 or aise maamalon main intracitoplasmik sperm injection kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan ek shukranu koshika ko sidhe dimb koshika main inject kiya jaataa he
 This method is used when sperm have problems entering the ovum, and in these situations the sperm of the partner or donor can also be used
 isiesai kaa upyog tab bhi kiya jaataa he jab shukranuon kii sankhya bahut kam ho
 isiesai kii safalataa kii dar ivief nishechan kii safalataa kii dar ke baraabar hoti he
 It is easy to say that the success of IVF simply requires a healthy egg, fertilized sperm and a uterus to conceive
 lekin is prakriya kii ucch laagat ke kaaran aam taur par ivief kaa prayaas anya saare saste vikalpon ke vifal hone ke baad hi kiya jaataa he
 It can also be done for egg donation or substitute motherhood where the woman providing the egg is not the woman who will complete the pregnancy period
 This means that IVF can be used for women who have undergone menopause
 daan kii gai dimbanujanakoshika ek crucible main nishechit kii ja sakati he
 If fertilization is successful, the zygote or fertilization is transferred to the uterus, within which it develops into an embryo
 anuvaanshik vikaron kii gaiyr-maujuudagi kii pushti karne ke liye preimplantesan genetic diagnosis ke saath bhi ivief kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 a similar but more general test has been developed called preimplantation genetic haplotyping

 Injectable gonadotropins are used in most patients under intensive monitoring
 aisi monitering main samay samay par estradeol staron ko dekha jaataa he or gayanacologic ultrasonographi ke zarie putakon kii badhat dekhi jaati he
 Injections will usually be required for about 10 days
 During this cycle, natural ovulation is usually prevented with the use of gnrh agonists that begin before or during stimulation, or with the use of gnrh antagonists that are used only during the last days of stimulation; Both factors block the natural overgrowth of luteinizing hormones, and the physician can initiate the process of ovulation with the help of drugs, usually injectable human coronary gonadotropins
 jab yah tay kiya jaataa he putakeey paripakvata upyukt he, to human korionic gonedotropins diya jaataa he
 This factor, acting as an analogue of luteinizing hormone, caused ovulation to occur 42 hours after injection, but a recovery process commenced just before that to receive the ovarian cells from the ovary
 ek transvazinal takanic kii sahaayta se rogi se dimb punah praapt kiye jate hai jisamen ek ultrasound chalit sui yoni kii diwaar ko bhed kar dimb grathiyon tak pahunchati he
 The needle can be suctioned by this needle and this follicular fluid is sent to the IVF laboratory to identify the eggs
 aam taur par das se tees dimb nikaale jate hai
 This recovery process takes about 20 minutes and is usually done under conscious mitigation or general anesthesia
 prayogshaala main, pahachaane gaye dimbon se unke ird gird kii koshikaayen nikaal kar dimbon ko nishechan ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To select eggs with optimum opportunities for successful conception, oocyte selection can be done before fertilization
 is bich, veery ko nishechan hetu taiyaar karne ke liye usamen se niskriy koshikaon or veery drav ko nikaal diya jaataa he
 This process is called sperm secretion
 yadi veery kisi shukranu daandaata dwaara uplabdh karaayaa gaya he, to aam taur par use upachaar ke liye taiyaar karne ke baad jamaaya or roganurahit kiya jayega or upyog ke liye taiyaar karne hetu use pighalaaya jayega
 The sperm and the egg are incubated in a culture medium at a ratio of 75,000: 1 for about 18 hours
 adhikansh sthitiyon main, is samay tak andanu nishechit ho jaataa he or nishechit andanu do proneuclius dikhaata he
 a sperm can be injected directly into the egg using some conditions, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection) in low sperm count or motility
 nishechit andanu ko vishesh vikaas madhyam main rakh kar lagbhag 48 ghanton ke liye chhod diya jaataa he jab tak ki andanu main chah se aath koshikaayen na ho jaaen
 In the Gammit introphallopian transfer method, the eggs are removed from the woman's body and placed in one of the fallopian tubes of the woman along with the male's sperm
 isse stri ke sharir ke bheetar nishechan kii prakriya sampann hoti he
 Therefore, this diversity is actually in vivo fertilization, not artificial inertial fertilization
 aam taur par bhrun ko punah prapti ke baad 6-8 koshika kii avasthaa main pahunchane tak sanvardhit kiya jaataa he
 Although in many Canadian, American and Australian programs, embryos are housed in a long culture system and transfer is performed about five days after retrieval at the blastocyst stage, especially if there are still many high quality embryos available on the third day
 It has been observed that blastocyst phase transfers result in higher conception rates
 europe main 2 dinon ke baad sthanantaran aam baat he
 Embryos can be cultured in artificial culture medium or in autologous endometrial coculture

 The artificial embryo culture medium basically contains glucose, pyruvate, and energetic ingredients, but the addition of amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and cholesterol makes the fetal development process even better

 "pregnancy" data may be indicative of a positive pregnancy test and not necessarily a "viable conception", which indicates the fetal beats
 jin garbhaadhanon ke falswaroop jivit shishu janm hota he, unhen jivit janm dar kehete hai
 Nowadays in most cases a distinction is made between single and twin or more than one conception, because more than one, especially more than twin, pregnancies should be avoided as they carry many risks for the mother and the fetus

 instant messaging internet kaa purvavarti he, jo sabase pehle 1960 ke dashak main bahu-prayokta oparating pranali jaise ki sitis evam multics main upasthit hua
 Initially, some of these systems were used as notification systems for services such as printing, but were soon used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine
 jaise-jaise networkon kaa vikaas hua, networkon ke saath protocolon kaa bhi prasar hua
 Some of these used parallel protocols, while others needed a friend group to connect them to the server (see)
 During the incident of the bulletin board system that reached the peak during the 1980s, some systems incorporated conversational features that were similar to instant messaging; The freelancing roundtable was a prime example of this
 1980 ke dashak ke uttararddh main or 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh main, camodor 64 computers ke liye kwantum link online seva ne vartmaan main jude hue graahakon ko prayokta se upyogkarta tak sandesh bhejne kii suvidha pradaan kii jise unhone "online sandesh" oelem) or baad main "flashmel" kaha

 ye sab vishesh rup se us company kii seva ke saath kaary karte hai, haalanki kuch anya sevaaon ke saath simit kaary kii anumati bhi pradaan karte hai
 There are also third-party customer software programs that will be integrated with most major instant messaging services

 These are all tasks that a small business needs, but larger organizations will need more sophisticated programs that can work together
 The way to find capable applications for this is to use the enterprise version of instant messaging applications
 isamen exempipi, lotus semtime, microsoft offis communicator aadi jaise sheershak shaamil hai jo aksar anya interprise anuprayogon jaise ki karypravah pranaaliyon ke saath ekikrut hote hai
 These enterprise applications or enterprise application integrations are built up to a few limitations, ie storing data in a common format

 Typically, a dedicated corporate IM server has many benefits such as a pre-filled contact list, consolidated authentication, and improved security and privacy
 kuch networkon ne aise bahu-network vaale iem graahakon dwaara unka upyog rokane ke liye parivartan kiye hai
 For example, Trillian had to use a number of modifications and patches after its users made changes to these networks to access MSN, AOL and Yahoo networks
 Major IM providers usually cite the need for a formal agreement to bring about these changes, as well as the reasons for security concerns

 However, some people try to express the emotional expression on IM more accurately
 sadhy pratikriyaayein jaise ki yaa adhik lokapriy hote ja rahe hai
 There are some standards that are introduced in mainstream conversation including ' # ' which denotes satire in a statement and '*' which is a spelling mistake and / or grammatical error in the previous message and its subsequent modification

 Although distributed messaging systems have many benefits, it also carries some risk and liability, particularly when used at workplaces
 in jokhimon or dayitvon main nimnlikhit shaamil hai: Freak individuals have used IM networks since 2004 to provide persistent phishing attempts, "deadly urls", and bearers of virus file attachments, of which over 1100 discrete attacks in 2004–2007 were conducted by the IM Security Center

 According to Manu, 'brahmachars should not beg alms from the family of the Guru, those belonging to their caste and from the total bandhvans, if a second house of begging is not found, they should sacrifice the former houses and pray for alms
 isse spasht hota he ki gurukul gaanvon ke sannikat hi hote the
 There was also a fear of their favoritism and attraction towards Brahmachari's house in pleading with the Swatis, and hence there was a complete prohibition of begging from the Swatis

 As a result, Kashi, Karnataka, Nashik etc
 became famous centers of education

 Their settlements formed a new village there

 In addition, under the influence of various Hindu sects and monastic masters, the monasteries became important centers of education around the second century CE

 Public educational institutions were first established in Buddhist viharas

 In these institutions, religious texts were taught and spiritual practice was done

 After some time they became great centers of learning

 But in these the Guru was not the representative of any one clan but was the head of the whole vihara

 Actually there were no separate schools for girls
 jin kanyaon ko gurukul main adhyayan karne kaa avasar praapt hota tha ve purushon ke saath hi adhyayan karti thim
 Atreya was studying in Valmiki's ashram in Uttararamcharit
 bhawabhooti ne `malti madhav' main kaamandaki ke gurukul main adhyayan karne kaa varnan kiya he
 But these examples are few
 adhiktar gurupatni, gurukanya athwa guru kii putravadhu hi gurukul main rahane ke kaaran adhyayan kaa laabh uthaa paati thim vastut: shastron ke anurodh par kanyaon kii shiksha grih par hi hoti thi
 In ancient India, under the direct supervision of the Guru, learning was considered superior
 atev adhikansh vidhyaarthee guru kulon main hi rahete the
 Guru Jan used to make arrangements for the residence of the student at his home
 bhojan kaa kaary bhiksha vritti dwaara chalata tha athwa adhyaaapak ke grih main bhi vyavastha ho jaati thim
 At that time, more than fifteen students did not study together with a guru
 kabhi-kabhi to keval chaar vidhyaarthee hi ek guru ke adheen adhyayan karte the
 Therefore, arranging their food and residence was not a difficult task for the Guru
 kintu guru ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa prabandh karne main asamarth hone par vidhyaarthee apane rahane kaa prabandh swayan karte the
 It was considered extremely disgraceful for the teacher to ask for money from the student in teaching work
 guru nirdhan se nirdhan vidhyaarthee ko bhi padhaane se manaa nahin kar saktaa tha
 The guru who used to bargain for learning was considered as a practitioner of learning
 aise adhyapakon ko dharmik avasaron par ruthvik ke kaary ke ayogy kaha gaya
 But by the same letter taught by the Guru, the disciple was considered indebted to him
 atev samaavartan ke avasar par shishy guru-dakshina ke rup main samarthyanusaar guru ko dhan dete the
 Those who were very poor used to give dakshina to the Guru's household by doing service and asking for alms at the time of inclusion
 vastut: raja or praja donon kaa karttavya tha ki ve vidwaan aacharyon evam shikshan sansthaaon ko mukt hast daan den
 In prehistoric times, every type of literary and commercial education was in the family
 aisi avasthaa main sambhavat: sage bhai-bahan tathaa chachere bhai-bahan sammilit hokar hi parivaar ke shikshit agrajanon ke sangrakshan main vidyoparjan karte rahe hoge
 But gradually, due to the abundant increase in the store of learning, the interest of people towards specialization started increasing
 atev vidhyaarthiyon ke liye parivaar se duurastha sthanon par jaakar pratishthit vidwaanon ke sangrakshan main vaanchit vishyon kaa adhyayan karnaa aavashyak ho gaya
 Often, girls also had to go outside the house to learned scholars to get higher education
 kintu is sambandh main hamaare granthon se bahut kam sanket praapt hote hai
 In Uttara Ramcharit, there is a mention of a woman named Atreyi studying with love-kush in Valmiki's ashram
 jo is baat kaa pusht pramaan he ki us yug main sah-shiksha kaa prachaar tha
 Similarly, in 'malti-madhava', Bhavabhuti, along with Bhurivasu and Devrat, has described a woman named Kamandaki receiving education in the same school
 bhawabhooti aathvi shatabdi ke kavi hai
 Therefore, it seems that if not during Bhavabhuti time, there must have been a trend of co-education of boys and girls till some time before that
 isi prakaar puraanon main kahod or sujatha, ruhu or pramadavara kii kathaayen varnit hai
 It is known from these that girls were studying in schools as well as boys and they were married when they were young
 parinamat: kabhi-kabhi gandharv vivaah bhi ho jate the
 All these evidences throw light on the fact that in that era women could have attained knowledge by living among men without curtains
 us yug main sahashiksha-pranali kaa astitv bhi inase siddh hota he
 The idea of co-education was propagated in the Gurukuls, which is also supported by the method of incorporation described in the Assumption Home Sasutra
 is vidhi main snaatak ke anulepan kriya ke varnan main balak evam balika kaa samarvatan sanskaar saath-saath sampann hona paaya jaataa he
 In that era, the appropriateness of the Brahmacharyasrama, Vedadhyayana and Samvartana rites of a woman is proved according to the assurance
 purv kaal main jab badi sankhya main striyaan ucch shiksha grahan kar rahi thim or apana amuly yogadan dekar sahitya ke gaurav ko badha rahi thim, us samay unamem se kuch adhyaapan kaary bhi avashya hi karti hongi
 The usage of the words Upadhyaya and Upadhyayani is found in Sanskrit literature
 upaadhyaay kii patni ko aadar purvak upaadhyaayani kaha gaya he, kintu upaadhyaaya un vidhushi naariyon ke liye prayukt hua he jo adhyaapan kaary karti thim
 The need to compose another word that makes sense of female teachers would have been possible only if there were sufficient number of female teachers
 iske atirikt pardaapratha barahavin shatabdi ke baad bhartiya samaaj main aayi, atevam striyon ke liye adhyaapan kaary main kisi prakaar ke bandhan kii sambhaavna bhi na thi
 It may be that these titles have been taught only to girls or both boys and girls
 panini ne bhi acharya evam aacharyani ke antar ko spasht kiya he tathaa chatrishalaon kaa ullekh kiya he
 It can be inferred from this that the teachers would also be the guardians of these schools
 ramdaas goud ne likhaa he- `harsh ke baad saatvin-aathvin shatee main bhi striyon ke adhyaapan kaary kaa pataa miltaa he
 As a result of losing to Shankaracharya, after her husband Mandan Mishra retired, Sanjay Bharti started teaching in Shringagiri
 kaha jaataa he ki bharti dwaara shiksha praapt karne ke kaaran hi shrungery or dwarka ke mathon kaa shishy sampradaay `bharti' naam se abhihit hua
 However, due to lack of space and inconveniences, most of the girls would study at home and would not have the courage to pursue higher education
 sambhavat: isi kaaran in chatrashaalaon evam upaadhyaayaon ke sambandh main adhik vivaran praapt nahin hote
 Although there were highly educated women in this period like Maitreyi, Gargi, Vishvavara and leela-vati, it cannot be concluded from this that there was a sufficient prevalence of female education in this era or that female education existed in its organized form
 is sambandh main el
 According to Mookerji - `` It is possible that in this age there was no organized system of education for women
 sambhavat: jab samaaj main yogya upaadhyaayaayen praapt ho jaati hongi tab unheen ke sangrakshan main kanyaon ko bheja jaataa hoga kintu inke uplabdh na hone par baadhya hokar aacharyon ke paas putriyon kii adhyayanarth bhejnaa padataa hoga
 In the era where Gandharva marriage was not uncommon in the society, there would have been no objection to the parents of the girls in co-education
 kintu aage chalakar gandharv-vivaah se kanyaon ke naitik patan kii ashanka badhane lagi
 Therefore, people started arranging higher education of girls by appointing teachers at home
 ucch shiksha hetu duurastha aacharyon ke paas jane vaali kanyaon kii sakhya bhi adhik na rahi hogi kyonki jaatakon main shiksha hetu takshashila jane vaali balikaon kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota
 There were no public schools for boys until the fourth century BCE
 harit ne vyavastha di he ki kanyaon kii shiksha ghar par hi pita, chachaa athwa bhai dwaara honi chahie
 Similarly, Manu is also not in favor of sending the girls out of the house to study with the boys under the protection of male teachers, because co-education increases the chances of destroying the virginity of the girls
 stri-shiksha kaa pratham sangathit prayaas karne kaa shrey baudhdho ko praapt he
 The Buddha had allowed the entry of women into the Sangha
 baudhon ne viharon main nivas karne vaali bhikshuniyon ke liye shiksha kii santoshajanak vyavastha bhi kii thi
 Like the Brahmavadinis, many of these women pursued celibacy for the knowledge of religion and philosophy
 inamen se kuch sinhal desh bhi gayi tathaa vahaan buddha dharm kii mahaan shikshikaaon ke rup main unhone vishesh prasiddhi praapt kii
 These girls used to take co-education in these viharas
 kintu in buddha sanghon main bhi isa kii chauthi shatabdi ke lagbhag nari shiksha kaa purna hraas ho chukaa tha
 How many percent of the students will take co-education, this question can certainly not be answered
 kintu nishchay hi yah sankhya adhik nahin rahi hogi
 Currently, Acharyakulam has been established by Baba Ramdev to promote Vedic education
 acharyakulam kii sthapana karne ke peeche baba ramdev kaa uddeshy he vaidic or bhartiya shiksha ko badhaava mili
 Acharyakulam is a residential educational institution based on Gurukul system as well as modern education system based on Gurukul system, located in Haridwar, Uttarakhand state of India
 isaki sabase khaas baat he ki yahan 8 veen tak 50 pratishat vaidic or 50 pratishat sibiesai kaa paathyakram padhaayaa jaataa he
 This is followed by 25 percent Vedic and 75 percent CBSE syllabus of the 8th
 saath hi yah aisa pehla skool he jahaan vidhyaarthee ko jitani angreji sikhaai jaati utani hi sanskrit main bhi paarangat kiya jaataa he|haal hi main acharyakulam sibiesai board se judaa he
 There is a wonderful confluence of modern and Vedic education in Acharyakulam, here, apart from the NCERT curriculum, there are three periods of Vedic education
 inamen veda, upanishad, sanskrit, yoga, havan-pujan aadi kaa gyaan diya jaataa he
 The history of ancient Indian education has been written over a long period of thousands of years
 at: yah atyant vishaal he
 Memoirs indicate a specific period of change in Sanskrit literature
 unke madhyam se vaidic kaal se lekar unke apane samay tak kii samast saahitiyik rachanaaon kii shrinkhalaa kaa purvabhaas karaayaa gaya he
 Therefore, for the study of Smritikalin students, the Vedas, Brahmins, Upanishads and Sutras were all the main compositions of the period
 isa purv pandraa sau shatabdi tak adhikansh vaidic mantron ke sampaadan kaa kaary purna ho chukaa tha
 Subsequently, the commentary and discussion texts developed for the meaning of the Vedas became known as 'brahmin' texts
 is kaal ke vidwaanon kii pratibha kaa upyog vedon ke swaroop kii raksha evam arthon ke spashti-karan main kiya gaya, na ki naveen saahitiyik-rachanaaon ke nirupan main
 As a result, many theories, opinions and rituals related to Vedic Yajnas began to be discussed in 'brahmins'
 vidwaanon ne vishesh rup se apni sadhana kaa kendra yagyon ke karmkand ko banaaya
 As a result, there was complexity and difficulty in rituals
 duusari ore vedon kii darshanik pravriti kaa vikaas hua or usne `upanishdon' ke rup main purnataa praapt kii
 In chronological order, there was also a considerable increase in Vedatikaran literature
 falat: is satat vardhaman sahitya main paarangat hona akele ek vyakti kii samarthy ke baahar ho gaya
 The printing art did not develop in that period
 atev vaidic sahitya ke lop ho jane kaa bhay sadaa bana rahata tha
 From the literature-security point of view the study area was divided into two parts
 vaidic panditon main se kuch ko is vishaal sahitya ko jyon kaa tyon kanthsth karne kaa kaary saunpa gaya, jisase sahitya kaa shuddh swaroop akshunn bana rahe tathaa anya vidwaanon kii tikaaon nirukton or shabdkosh aadi kaa adhyayan karke inaki vyakhya karne main apni pratibha ke pradarshan kaa avasar diya gaya
 During this period, the most decisive and creative genius of Hindu Megha emerged
 falswaroop shiksha, darshan, nyaay, mahakavy, bhashavigyaan, vyakaran, jyotish, nirukt, kalp, anekon kalaayen, vyaavhaarik vidya aadi ke kshetron main mahatvapurn safaltaayen praapt hui
 The scholars of these texts renewed these subjects for the convenience of their students and collected them in a commentary
 upanishdon evam sutron ke kaal main lekhan kala kaa gyaan ho jane par bhi inhen lipibaddh nahin kiya gaya kyonki vaidic mantron ko lipi baddh karnaa adharmik mana jaataa tha
 In the same period, on the basis of Vedic phases, scholars also composed a new literature in the Dharmasutras
 uparyukt sanskrit-vaanmay ke parivartansheel itihaas ko drushtigat karte hue ham uski vividhta evam vishalata kaa sahaj hi anumaan laga sakate hai
 The social customs, religious rituals, and rites described in this book have been surveyed in the memories
 vastut: smritiyaan ek vishaal samaaj ko lakshya karke hi nirmit kii gayi hai
 We also hope to mention this literature in the books of memory
 atev inamen grihyasutron, dharmasutron, upanishdon tathaa mimasaaon main purv vidyaman shreshth prathaon, ritiyon, manyataon evam sanskaron kaa sankalan kiya gaya he
 No other memory has as much success as Manusmriti has achieved in this work
 at: yahaan par manu smriti main sanketit vishyon kaa hi ullekh kiya ja rahaa he
 Manu has called the three Vedas as Shruti
 ye teen veda hi sanskrit sahitya kii pratham kadi hai
 Vedic Mantras were developed as stages, whose priests received knowledge of the desired branches
 mantra, brahman, shakha ko padhe hue 'rigvedi'; vedon ke pargami, samast shakhaon ke gyaata 'rutvij' tathaa vedon ko padhakar paarangat hue vidvan brahman ko vishisht sammaan praapt tha
 Brahmins who knew the three Vedas were called 'trivedi'
 manusmriti main adhyayan ke liye vedon ke kuch pramukh vishesh rup se paarit kiye gayi hai
 In fact, by this time, the processes of purification through religious activities and atonement had greatly expanded
 atev vishisht avasaron par vedon kii kuch richaon ke uccharan kaa mahatv bhi bad gaya
 In Manu Smriti, it has been said that such utterances should be pronounced with complete balance and rule so that one can be free from sins
 brahman atharvaveda kii angiras shruti kaa prayog shatru ke naash ke liye shastr ke rup main karte the
 In the daily Swadhyaya lessons of the graduates, the study of Brahmin texts has been encouraged
 manu ne aitarey brahman ke `subrahmanya' naamak mantron evam aitarey brahman tathaa bah vruch brahman main varnit shunagashep gaatha kaa bhi ullekh kiya he

 yahan likhane kaa anukram nimna he: The monarchy of New Zealand is the constitutional monarchy of New Zealand
 newzealand ke ekadhidaruk ko newzealand or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi newzealand kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 New Zealand is theoretically a monarchy, and the New Zealand ruler is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers as his representative, the governor-general of New Zealand
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " newzealand kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " newzealand ke raja" ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in New Zealand dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and colonized it in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 newzealand kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai

 "the novel has the story of a common pioneer named Raju becoming a spiritual teacher
 raju ek railway guide he jo roji kaa divaana ho jaataa he
 Rosie is the neglected wife of an anthropologist named Marco
 roji ko nrity se behad lagaav tha, lekin marco use isaki anumati nahin detaa he
 Accepting Raju, Rosie once again made up her mind to fulfill her dreams and leave Marco
 raju, roji kaa stage prabandhak ban gaya or raju ke prabandhan kaushal ke kaaran vah jald hi safal nartki ban gai
 But Raju came to mind and tried to control Rosie
 dhire-dhire raju or roji ke bich ke rishte kadave hote gaye
 Marco appears again
 udhar raju jaalsaji ke ek maamle main funs jaataa he or use do saal kii kaid ho jaati he
 When Raju comes out of jail after completing his sentence, the people of a village consider him as a saint
 tab tak uske man main malgudi or roji ke prati virakti ho jaati he or usee gaanv ke ek parityakt mandir main sharan le letaa he
 He helps the villagers in minor problems and thus he becomes a renowned monk
 ekbar us gaanv main akaal padataa he
 The villagers then ask him to fast for rain

 upanyaas ke ant main bhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin mil paata he ki kya raju bhukh se mar jaataa he yaa akaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Rosie is one of the most prominent characters in the guide
 upanyaas main use ek sundar nartki ke rup me prastut kiya gaya he, jisaki marco naamak maanavshastri se shaadi ho jaati he
 The wedding proves to be a curse for Rosie as Marco sees nothing but his work
 roji kii bhaavana ko samajhane kii koshish bhi nahin karata he
 Rosie is crazy about dance
 lekin marco use naachne kii anumati nahin detaa he
 She tries all the way but does not find success
 jab marco use malgudi main chhod detaa he to vah raju ke saath rahane lagati he or apana puraa samay nrity ko dene lagati he
 Rosie is of religious instinct and believes in Goddess Saraswati
 uske offis main kaanse kii najraj kii murti hoti he
 She did not discriminate against people over wealth
 raju amir or prabhavi logon se milanaa pasand karata he lekin roji aise logon ko bhav nahin detii
 kalakaar hone ke naate vah kalakaaron kaa aadar karti he or unke bich main rahanaa chaahati he
 Success does not fill her pride, but she stays grounded despite a successful career in dance
 ekbar raju is baat se gussa jaataa he ki roji uske saath samay nahin bitaakar kalakaaron ke saath samay bitaati he
 Rosie is like a traditional Indian wife
 vah apane pati ko bhagwaan kii tarah maanati he
 But her husband considers her an object and her art is monkey-jumping
 He insults her
 jab marco ko roji or raju ke najdiki rishte ke bare main pataa chalata he to vah kshubdh ho jaati he or uski upeksha karata he
 Rosie wanted to change Marco but that didn't change
 This shows that Rosie was very tolerant and hopeful
 safal nartki banane ke baad bhi uske man main apane pati ke prati sammaan kaa bhav tha

 In astronomy, constellations refer to a group of stars appearing in the sky
 itihaas main vibhinn sabhyataaon nen akaash main taron ke bich main kalpit rekhaayen khinchakar kuch akritiyaan prathit kii hai jinhen unhone naam de die
 For example, in ancient India there is a planetarium named Mrigashirsha, which in Greek civilization is called Oraian, which means "hunter"

 Thus the entire celestial sphere has been divided into different constellations
 agar yah bataanaa ho ki koi khagoleey vastu ratri main akaash main kahan milegi to yah bataaya jaataa he ki vah kis taramandal main sthit he
 Keep in mind that stars and other objects appearing in a planetarium may appear close to each other when viewed from the earth, but this is not necessarily the case
 jis tarah dur dekhne par do pahaad ek-duusare ke nazadik lag sakate hai lekin sameep jane par pataa chalata he ke unamem bahut faaslaa he or ek pahaad vastav main duusare pahaad se milon peeche he
 "planetarium" was called "nakshatra" in Sanskrit and in various Indian languages this word is used even today
 taramandal ko angrezi main "constlation" or arabi main "majamua-al-nazoom" kehete hai
 The constellation consists of stars and celestial objects, which, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, are permanently visible in the same area in the sky
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he kii ye vastav main ek-duusare ke paas hai yaa inkaa aapas main koi mahatvapurn gurutvkarshan bandhan he
 In contrast, the stars of the trilateral are actually in a cluster and have a gravitational bond between themselves
