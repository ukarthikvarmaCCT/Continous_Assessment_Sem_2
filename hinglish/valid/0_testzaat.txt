 aise main agar munde bhartiya janata party chhod dete to shivshakti-bhimshakti sameekaran kii marathavada main beasar hone kii ashanka thi
 Knowledgeable people believe that Munde, along with the Shiv Sena, worked hard to create the equation of Shiv shakti-bhim Shakti with the aim of winning more and more seats in Marathwada this time so that they can silence their opponents in Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party

 Elections to Maharashtra State Legislative Assembly in 1978 suffered after Congress
 Successful contest: Munde asked to contest from Renapur constituency in Party Beed district, but he lost the election with a margin of only 1100 votes
 apane virodhiyon ko uske khilaaf abhiyaan ke liye ek bhi acha mudda nahin mil saktaa he
 So they launched a whisper campaign among the people by spreading the tradition bound village word that Munde was having affair with the girl not related to her community
 munde ke liye saarvajanik rup se chunaav baithkon he ki vah vastav main is ladki ke saath pyaar main tha or use chunaav ke baad shaadi main ghoshnaa karne kaa saahas tha
 This girl was Pradnya Mahajan, Pramod Mahajanji's younger sister and announced as married
 The first election victory: Her first electoral success was in 1978 when the party asked her to contest the Zilla Parishad elections in her hometown of Beed district
 He trounced his opponent with a margin that was the highest in the state
 The tenure with the Zilla Parishad was brief, but it prepared him for a big political fight in his later life

 kram-vikaas kisi jaivik aabaadi ke anuvanshik lakshanon ke pidiyon ke saath parivartan ko kehete hai
 Observable traits change due to genetic changes in biological populations
 jaise-jaise genetic vividhta pidiyon ke saath badalati he, prakritik varan se wo lakshan zyada saamaanya ho jate hai jo uttarjivan or prajnan main zyada safalataa pradaan karte hai

 Evolution does not seek to explain the origin of life
 par kram-vikaas yah samajhaata he ki pracheen saral jivan se aaj kaa jatil jivan kaise viksit hua he
 Seeing the similarities between all the castes of today, it can be said that all the creatures of the earth have a common ancestor
 ise antim saarvjaanik purvaj kehete hai
 All the castes of today have arisen from this through the process of evolution
 sabhi shakson ke paas jeens ke rup main anuvaanshik padaarth hota he
 All the individuals take it from their parents and give it to their children
 santanon ke jeens main thodi bhinnata hoti he
 This is due to mutation and alteration of existing genes during sexual reproduction
 iske kaaran santane mata-pita or ek duusare se thodi bhinn hoti hai
 If those variations are useful, then the chances of survival and reproduction of the offspring are high
 iske kaaran agali peedi ke vibhinn shakhson ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna samaan nahin hoti he
 As a result, the traits that make organisms more adapted to their conditions, become more common in the next generations
 ye bhinnataayen dhire-dhire badhati rahati hai
 This process is responsible for the diversity of organisms seen today
 adhikansh genetic utparivartan shakson ko na koi sahaayta pradaan karte hai, na unki dikhaawat ko badalte hai or na hi unhen koi haani pahunchaate hai
 Through genetic drift, these unbiased genetic mutations are only incidentally established in populations and survive for generations
 iske vipareet, prakritik varan ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he kyonki yah un lakshanon ko bachaati he jo jivit rahane or prajnan karne ke liye jaruri hai
 Natural selection and genetic drift are regular and dynamic parts of life
 arabon varshon main in prakriyaaon ne jivan ke vansh vriksh kii shakhaon kii rachana kii he
 The modern thinking of evolution began with the emergence of the book Charles Darwin's Biology, published in 1859
 iske saath grager mendal dwaara padpon par kiye gaye adhyayan ne anuvaanshiki ko samajhane main madad kii
 The discovery of fossils, advances in population genetics and the global network of scientific research have provided more detailed information on the mechanism of evolution
 vaigyanikon ko ab nayi jatiyon ke udgam kii zyada samaj he or unhone ab prajatikaran kii prakriya kaa avlokan prayogshaala or prakruti main kar liya he
 Evolution is the basic scientific principle that biologists use to understand life
 yah kai vishyon main prayog hota he jaise ayurvigyaan, maanas shaastra, jaev sangrakshan, maanavshaastra, forensik vigyaan, krishi or anya saamaajik-saanskrithik vishay
 The main ideas of evolution are summarized as follows: 19 veen shatabdi main prakritik itihaas ke sangrahalay kaafii lokapriy the
 During this time European explorations and naval expeditions carried the natural scientists and collectors of large museums together
 charles darwin ek graduate the jo prakritik itihaas vigyaan ke vishay main shikshit or prashikshit the
 Natural historians like him used to collect specimens for museums, catalog them, describe and study them
 darwin echemes beagal naamak jahaaj par prakritik vaigyanik kaa kaam kar rahe the
 He was assigned a five-year research trip around the world
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone bahut se jeevon ke namoonay ekatrit kiye or unka nirikshan kiya
 He was particularly interested in the diverse fauna of the coasts of South America and the nearby Galápagos Islands
 darwin ko dur-dur ke sthanon se namoonay ekatrit karne or unka adhyayan karne se vyapak anubhav praapt hua
 From these studies he introduced the idea that every caste evolved from ancestors with similar traits
 1938 main unhone samajhaayaa ki yah ek prakritik prakriya se kaise ho saktaa he
 He named this natural process natural selection
 kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar uske parivesh main maujuud sansadhano kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 For the population to remain stable for years, it is necessary to balance the population size and available resources
 parivesh jitani santanon ko aashray de saktaa he, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai
 Due to this, not all persons of any generation can survive
 isliye uttarjivan ke liye jaruri sansadhano ke liye hameshaa ek pratyogi sangharsh bana rahata he
 This made Darwin realize that survival does not depend on mere coincidence
 unhen ehsaas hua ki uttarjivan shakson kii bhinnataaon, yaa "lakshanon", par nirbhar karata he
 Some traits aid the survival of individuals and some hinder it
 parivesh ke zyada anukulit shaks apane kam anukulit pratidwandviyon kii tulana main agali peedi ko zyada santaanen dete hai
 Characteristics that hinder survival and reproduction disappear after a few generations
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main sahaayta karte hai wo peedi dar peedi jamaa hote rahete hai
 In this way, due to the unequal ability of the person's survival and reproduction, the population changes gradually
 praaniyon or padpon main bhinnataaon ke avlokan prakritik varan ke siddhant kii buniyaad bane
 Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a special partnership that helps in pollination of plants
 unhone dekha ki orchidon main aisi bahut sari sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo kiton ko aakarshith karti hai, taaki pushpon kaa paraag unke sharir main chipak jaae
 In this way the kits carry pollen from a male orchid to a female orchid
 orchidon kii jatil dikhaawat ke baavjood, ye visheshikrut bhaag unheen moolbhoot sanrachanaon se banate hai jinase anya pushp banate hai
 In his book Fertilization of Orchids, Darwin proposes that orchid flowers are more adapted to the environment by the process of natural selection from the existing floral parts
 darwin abhi apane vichaaron par anusandhan or prayog kar hi the ki unhen alfred rasal vailes se ek chitthee mili
 In this letter, Wallace described a theory similar to Darwin's theory
 iske kaaran donon ne in siddhanton kaa sanyukt prakaashan kiya
 Wallace and Darwin both looked at the history of life as a family tree, with the tip of the branch representing today's castes and a common ancestor rather than the branching of the branches
 darwin ne kaha ki jivit chizein rishtedaar hai
 This meant that the whole life originated from a few simple ancestors
 or yah bhi sambhaavna thi ki sabhi jeevon kaa ek hi purvaj ho
 Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in his book The Emergence of Animals
 unke siddhant kaa matlab he ki maanav samet sabhi jeev aviraam prakritik prakriyaaon kii upaj hai
 Due to this some religious groups have raised objection to the theory of evolution
 iske vipareet vaigyanik samudaay main 99 pratishat se zyada log is siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai
 Natural selection is often synonymous with survival of the fittest, but this expression originates from Herbert Spencer's book Biology Theory, published in 1864, five years after Darwin's book
 swasthitam kii uttarjivita prakritik varan kii prakriya ko galat dhang se samajhaati he kyonki prakritik varan keval uttarjivan ke bare main nahin he or hameshaa swasthitam hi nahin jivit rahata he
 Darwin's theory of natural selection laid the foundation for the modern theory of evolution
 unke anusandhanon or avlokanon ne dikhaaya ki ek aabaadi ke shaks ek duusare se bhinn hote hai, in bhinnataaon main se kuch bhinnataayen mata-pita se milti hai or prakritik varan in bhinnataaon ko chunata or tyaagta he
 But they could not give a reason for these differences
 apane se pehle ke jeev vaigyanikon kii tarah ve samajhate rahe ki anuvaanshik lakshan upyog yaa anupyog kaa kaaran the, or apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan apane bacchon ko die ja sakate hai
 He tried to find examples of this
 unhone sochaa ki shuturamurg jaise bade udaan rahit pakshiyon kii taangen zyada chalane ke kaaran peedi dar padhi shaktishaalee hoti rahi hongi, or unke pankh kam udne ke kaaran peedi dar peedi kamazor hote rahe honge
 This misconception was called the "heredity of acquired traits", which was part of the theory "change of castes" proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809
 19 veen shatabdi ke ant main yah siddhant ko lamarkwaad kehalaata tha
 Darwin proposed an unsuccessful theory called pangenesis to explain the heredity of traits acquired over a lifetime
 1880 ke dashak main august visman ke prayogon ne dikhaaya ki apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan bacchon ko nahin die ja sakate hai
 Due to this, Lamarckism was abandoned in some time
 nae lakshan mata-pita dwaara santanon ko kaise die jate hai, iskaa uttar anuvanshiki par grager mendal ke agrani kaary se mila
 His experiments conducted over several generations of pea plants proved that genetic information is split at the time of formation of sex cells in the mother and father and that information from the mother and father is added at random during fertilization
 isaki tulana taash ke patton se kii ja sakati he jahaan kisi jeev ko aadhe pattey mata se yadrichhik dhang se milte hai or baaki aadhe pita se yadrichhik dhang se
 Mendel called this information factors, but later the name Jean became more prevalent

 They contain information that directs the physical development and behavior of the organism

 DNA is a long molecule made up of small molecules called nucleotides
 anuvaanshik jaankaree diene main newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main sangrahit hoti he
 DNA can be compared to an article in which nucleotides act as characters
 jis prakaar varnon kii shrunkhlaa se ek bana lekh jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he, usee prakaar newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa se bana diene anuvaanshik jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he
 Genes are instructions made from the letters of the alphabet of DNA
 sabhi jin milakar ek "nirdesh pustika" ke jaise hote hai jisamen ek jeev ko banane or kaam karaane kii sari jaankaree hoti he
 Changing these instructions written in DNA due to mutation increases the genetic variation of the population
 diene keshikaon ke andar chromosomon main hota he
 a random mixture of chromosomes from parents at fertilization gives the offspring a unique combination of genes
 langik janan ke dauraan jeenon kaa yah yadrichhik mishran bhi aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 Genetic variation of a population also increases with breeding with another population

 Sequence is not a random process
 haalanki diene main utparivartan yadrichhik dhang se hota he, par prakritik varan yadrichhik prakriya nahin he, uttarjivan or prajnan kii sambhaavna parivesh par nirbhar karti he
 The evolution is the result of natural selection over billions of years of flawed copying
 kram-vikaas kaa parinaam bakubi rachaa gaya jeev nahin hota he
 The result of natural selection is adapted organisms of their existing environment
 kram-vikaas kisi param lakshya kii taraf pragati nahin he
 Evolution does not attempt to create more developed, more intelligent or more complex organisms

 Rapid changes in the environment usually lead to extinction of the maximum castes
 prithvi par rahi 99 pratishat se adhik jatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 Five major mass extinctions have occurred since the beginning of life on Earth
 inke kaaran jatiyon kii vividhta main badi or aakasmik giravat hui he
 The most recent of these is the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event, which took place 6
6 million years ago
 genetic drift ek jati kii aabaadiyon main eleelon kii aavruti ke badalane ko kehete hai
 a allele is a variation of a gene
 ye baalo kaa rang, twachaa kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, rakt prakaar aadi nirdhaarit karte hai
 Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles into the population, but it can reduce genetic diversity by removing any alleles from the population
 genetic drift eleelon ke yadrichhik chayan se hoti he
 Selection is truly random when no external force influences it
 udhaaharan ke liye, samaan maap or bhaar par bhinn rangon ke kanchon se bhare ek apaardarshee thile se kuch kanche nikaalnaa ek yadrichhik chayan he
 Whether or not a person will be able to give their alleles to their children depends on their survival in which coincidence also plays a role
 sanyog ke kaaran aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti ke badalane kii is prakriya ko genetic drift kehete hai
 Genetic drift has a greater impact on small populations than on larger populations
 hardi-venberg niyam kahata he ki hardi-venberg samyavastha main hone vaali ek badi aabaadi main pidiyon ke saath eleelon kii aavruti nahin badalegi
 But it is impossible for a population of sufficient size to reach this system because these five things are necessary to reach this system
 1) aabaadi kaa aakaar anant hona chahie
 2) The mutation rate should be zero percent, because mutation can change alleles or create new alleles
 3) aabaadi se yaa main pravrajan nahin hona chahie, kyonki aabaadi main aane vaale yaa aabaadi ko chhodane vaale shaks eleelon kii aavruti ko badal sakate hai
 4) There should be no selective pressure on the population, that is, the probability of survival or reproduction of a person should not be more than others
 5) samagam puri tarah se yadrichhik hona chahie, jahaan sabhi nar baraabar aakarshak saathi hon
 This ensures truly random adulteration of alleles
 hardi-venberg samyavastha main aabaadi taash ke patton ke ek deck ke anuroop he; deck ko chaahe jitani baar phenta jaae, usamen na koi nayaa patta aayega or na koi patta nikalegaa
 The alleles in the population here have been compared to deck leaves
 aabaadi bottlenake paryaavaran kii ghatnaon ke kaaran kisi jati kii aabaadi ke teji se kam ho jane ko kehete hai
 a truly random population bottlenac does not favor any allele; That is, it is random which person will survive
 ek bottlenake aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko kam yaa khatm kar saktaa he
 The subsequent genetic drift may further reduce the genetic diversity of the population
 genetic vividhta kii kami aabaadi ko anya chaynaatmak dabaavon ke jokhim main daal sakati he
 An example of a population bottleneck is the "northern Elephant Seaway"
 19 veen ke atyaadhik shikaar ke kaaran uttari eliphant jalavyaghron kii aabaadi tees shakson se kam ho gai thi
 Due to conservation, the population of these has crossed one lakh and is increasing continuously
 par aabaadi bottlenake ke prabhaav saafe dikhaai dete hai
 In the absence of genetic diversity in the population, these aquifers are at great risk from diseases and are very likely to have genetic disorders
 sansthaapak kaa prabhaav tab hota he jab aabaadi kii ek choti toli baaki aabaadi se alag hokar ek nai aabaadi ban jaati he
 Often this is due to geographical isolation

 The genetic designs of the next generations will depend on the genetic designs of the founders, which will be different from the older population

 Assamese is the official language of the Assam province of India and the principal language spoken in Assam

 In terms of linguistic family, it is related to Arya language family and it is closely related to Bangla, Maithili, Oriya and Nepali

 Assamese is not the only dialect in its state
 yah pramukhtah maidaanon kii bhashaa he
 For a long time, there has been an attempt to prove Assamese a subpoena of Bengali
 asamiya kii tulana main bangala bhashaa or sahitya ke bahumukhi prasar ko dekhakar hi log is prakaar kii dhaaran banaate rahe hai
 But from the linguistic point of view, parallel development of Bangla and Assamese can be easily seen
 magadhi apbhransh ke ek hi strot se nicksruth hone ke kaaran donon main samantaayein ho sakati hai, par unke aadhaar par ek duusari kii boli siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In terms of regional expansion, several sub-forms of Assamese are found
 inamen se do mukhya hai - purvi rup or pashchimi rup
 In terms of literary usage, the eastern form is considered the standard
 purvi kii apeksha pashchimi rup main boligat vibhinnataayen adhik hai
 In these two main forms of Assamese, sound, grammar and vocabulary find differences from these three views
 asamiya ke shabdasmooh main sanskrit tatsam, tadbhav tathaa deshaj ke atirikt videshi bhashaaon ke shabd bhi milte hai
 The number of words adopted from non-aryan languages is also not small
 bhashaa main saamanyat: tadbhav shabdon kii pradhanta he
 The words of Persian, Arabic and Portuguese and some other European languages have also come through Hindi Urdu
 bhartiya aryabhashaon kii shrunkhlaa main purvi seemaa par sthit hone ke kaaran asamiya kai anarya bhashapariwaron se ghiri hui he
 Being a border language at this level, words from many sources of non-aryan languages are found in its vocabulary
 in sroton main se teen apekshaakrit adhik mukhya hai : In the context of this mixed group of terms, it would be appropriate to clarify that Khasi, Bodo and Thai elements have been borrowed in Assamese, but the mixture of Malayan and Kolar elements is a result of the traditional mixture of Muladhara in these languages
 anarya bhashaaon ke prabhaav ko assam ke anek sthannaamon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Many place names of Austric, Bodo and Ahom are found in the backdrop of naming of villages, cities and rivers

 The earliest available form of the script is the copperplate of Bhaskaravarman dated to 610 AD
 parantu uske baad se aadhunik rup tak lipi main "nagari" ke madhyam se kai prakaar ke parivartan hue hai
 Even the systematic form of the Assamese language from the 13th and 14th centuries can be seen in its "chariyapad" of Buddhist Siddhas
 "charyaapad" kaa samay vidwaanon ne isvi san 600 se 1000 ke bich sthir kiya he
 Some of the authors of these couplets, Siddhas, had a close relationship with the Kamrup state
 "charyaapad" ke samay se 12veen shatabdi tak asmi bhashaa main kai prakaar ke maukhik sahitya kaa srijan hua tha
 Manikonvar-phulkonvar-song, dakavakha, tantra mantra etc
 are some of the forms of this oral Sahi
 asamiya bhashaa kaa purvavarti, apbhranshamishrit boli se bhinn rup praaia: 18veen shatabdi se spasht hota he
 Keeping in view the linguistic features, three periods of Assamese development can be considered: 14veen shatabdi se 16veen shatabdi ke ant tak
 This period can then be divided into two eras: the pre-vaishnava "era" and the Vaishnavite
 is yug ke sabhi lekhakon main bhashaa kaa apana swaabhaavik rup nikhar aayaa he, yadhyapi kuch pracheen prabhaavon se vah sarvatha mukt nahin ho saki he
 Grammatically there is not enough uniformity in the language
 parantu asamiya ke pratham mahatvuparn lekhak shankardev kii bhashaa main ye trutiyaan nahi milti
 The chaos of the pre-vaishnava-era language ends here

 The first grammar of Assamese was printed in 1848 and the first Assamese English Dictionary in 1867
 asamiya ke shisht or likhit sahitya kaa itihaas paanch kaalon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he: You can divide the poetry stream of Assamese literature from the 16th century to the 19th century in six parts- asamiya kii paaramparik kavita ucchvarg tak hi simit thi
 Bhattadeva gave Assamese prose literature a structured look

 or rajasekhar ke naatak main nirbhayaraja or nirbhayanarendra naam se bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The inscriptions found from Ramgaya, in front of the Gadadhar temple Gaya, from Gunneria in the southern part of Gaya district, Itkhori in Hazaribagh district of Bihar and the northern part of Paharpur in the Rajshahi district of Bengal describe the reign of Mahendrapal I

 Benzodiazepine is a special treatment for delirium of the delirium tremor
 
 dalerium tremens ko "di

 In addition to alcohol, seizures even when withdrawing from other sedative sedatives - such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates - And death can occur if not properly managed medically
 opioid, cocaine or marijuana, jaise anya dawaaon - jo nidrakaari shaamak nahin he - ke nivartan main, pramukh chikitsa jatiltaaon nahin rahata he
 Therefore, while withdrawing from them, the life of the patient does not threaten the DT, due to alcohol, only people with a history of alcohol
