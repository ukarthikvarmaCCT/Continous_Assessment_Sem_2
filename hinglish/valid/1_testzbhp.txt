 nasa antariksh malbe ko saafe karne ke liye gekko gripurs ko viksit kar rahaa he
 Researchers at nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are attempting to develop gecko grippers to clear space debris that includes objects like orbital debris or damaged satellites
 gekko griper mul rup se ek chipakane vaala padaarth he
 The news related to this was published on the website of Jet Propulsion Laboratory on 19 December 2014
 is gripping pranali ko haaron paranes jo ek jepiel main kaary karne vaale ek robotics shodhakarta or gripurs ke liye pramukh anveshak he dwaara viksit kiya gaya he
 This system is inspired by geckos, which belong to a gancosa of lizards, which are commonly found in tropical regions
 viksit kiye ja rahe gekko gripurs par synthetic bal hai jo geko chhipakaliyon ke pairon par paae jane vaale chote bal kii tarah hai
 These synthetic hairs are also called Stalx
 ye pachchar ke aakaar ke hai or duusari taraf ye mashroom ke topi jaise he
 When the gripping pad lightly touches part of an object, only the upper part of the hair touches an object, the viscosity of the grippers can be started or stopped as well as their direction can be changed
 gekko gripurs kii asthaayee chipchipahat vaan dar vals bal ke prayog ke madhyam se hasil kii jaati he
 The force is named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Johannes Diederich van der Waals
 jab vaan dar vals bal ko chipakane vaala pad par lagu kiya jaataa he, to synthetic bal jhuk jate hai
 In this way the actual area of contact between the hair and the surface is increased, which are compatible for greater adhesion
 jab bal kaa prabhaav samaapt kar diya jaataa hai to bal punah sidhe ho jate hai tathaa is prakriya se chipchipahat band ho jaati he
 Due to the non-uniform distribution of electrons orbiting the nucleus of atoms, light electrical charges are generated, which causes these temporary adhesive forces
 This force can persist even under extreme temperature, pressure and radiation conditions
 jepiel main 30 se adhik antariksh yaan kii satahon kaa pareekshan gripurs kii sateekta kii jaanch karne ke liye kiya ja chukaa hai

 During the test, the Grippers succeeded in catching a 20-pound cube that was floating, as well as a Grippers spacecraft wearing a vest made of material panels that held the equivalent of a 250-pound object
 in gripurs kaa jepiel thermal nirvaat chambar main safaltaapurvak pareekshan kiya gaya he, kul nirvaat kii sthiti or 76 degree fahrenheit ke neeche ke taapmaana jo antariksh kii sharton ke anukaran karne ke samaan hai

 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts
 in bhinnataaon ko tantrikeey sangyanatmak durbalataaon se jod diya gaya he jinhen aksar paagalpan / manorog samaj liya jaataa he
 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain
 aisa karne kii ek badi vajah aakasmik adhyayanon ke parinaamon yah pataa chalanaa he ki dawaaon kaa ek samooh, jo dopamine kii karypranali ko avaruddh kar detaa he or jinhen phinotheagins ke naam se janaa jaataa he, isse manorog ke lakshanon main kami aa sakati he
 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he
 Although common among all psychiatric resistance effects, D2 inhibition was thought to be the same for 20 years until PET and SPET impersonation studies in the mid-1990s provided convincing evidence

 Simultaneously, the decreased effects of neurotransmitter glutamate and NMDA glutamate receptors in schizophrenia have also been noted
 is avadharana ko un logon ke maranoparant mastishk pareekshan main paae gaye asaamaanya rup se kam glutamet abhigrahakon ke str se bhi samarthan miltaa he, jinka pehle sizophrenia ke liye ilaaj kiya gaya tha 199, or saath hi yah khoj ki glutamet avarodhi davaaiyaan jaise phincyclidine or ketamine in paristhitiyon se jude lakshno or sangyanatmak samasyaon kaa anukaran kar sakati he
 The fact that glutamate receptors are less effective means that the tests to detect the function of the frontal / forebrain and hippocampal are not accurate, and that glutamate affects the functioning of dopamine, all of these in schizophrenia
 , Which has been shown to be an important mediator in the role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia
 The breakfast

 Template: Grammar series yahaan angrezi vyakaran ko angrezi bhashaa ke lakshanon kaa varnan karne vaale niyamon ke samooh ke rup main samajha gaya he
 Language is such that its elements can be combined according to a particular structure
 This article deals with morphology, that is, language forming clauses and syntax, namely the use of morphology and words to create meaningful phrases, syntax and sentence formation
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke vyakaran ko aam taur par do alag tareeqon se padhaa ja saktaa he: pehla vivarnaatmak, jo aam taur par ek bade paath sangrah ke vyavasthit vishleshan par aadhaarit he, jiske baad vyakaran kii sanrachana kaa varnan hota he; or doosraa nirdharak, jo vaktaaon ke bhashaai vyavhaar ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye us bhashaa ke niyamon ko ek upkaran ke rup main istemaal karata he 
 nirdharak vyakaran kaa sambandh angrezi vyakaran ke zaahir vivaadon se he, jo aksar samay-samay par prayogon main hone vaale parivartanon kaa dyotak hota he
 The English language has many historical, social and regional forms

 This article describes a common current standard of English, the form of language found in public negotiations that includes broadcast, education, entertainment, government, and news reporting

 Nouns can be both a contextual function of phrases and pronouns where they "point" to a person or object in the real world
 iske alaava, ve kai samaan vyakaranik kaaryon ko saajha karte hai, jisamen vaakyakhand ke bheetar donon hi, karta, karm or vidheyak ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai
 Noun terms can be formed by combining only one noun or they can be complex with a noun adapted from different elements
 sarvnaam ve shabd hai jo sangya pad ke pratisthaapan kaa kaary kar sakate hai
 For example, in the following sentence sangya pad the very large ball with red spots ko it sarvnaam se pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he Despite the pronoun name, pronouns cannot take the place of a noun within a noun phrase - they simply replace the full noun phrase
 ise uparyukt vaakya se hi darshaya ja saktaa he: sangya ball, sarvnaam it se pratisthapit nahin kii ja sakati, jaisaa ki avyakarnatmak vaakya main In these cases, a person can use the word one in place of a noun
 nimna khand angrezi sangyaaon, sangya pad or sarvnaam kii sanrachana kaa varnan karte hai
 The noun conceptually defines a person, object, place, or idea
 yah kaalpanik paribhaasha kosh vargeey sangya ke kendriya sadasyon kii gananaa karti he
 However, the hypothetical definition fails to enumerate many nouns, for example deverbal nouns such as jump or destruction
 For this reason, many grammatical descriptions of English define nouns grammatically
 Nevertheless, traditional English grammar and some academic grammar define a noun by a hypothetical definition
 gaiyr-vyaktivaachak sangya, saamanytah, ling athwa vibhakti ke liye chihnit nahin hoti he, balki vachan or nishchayvachak ke liye chihnit hoti he
 English nouns may have some morphological types: saral sangya ekal dhaatu se banati he, jo pratipadik kaa kaary bhi karata he jisamen vibhakti lagaai ja sakati he
 For example, the word boy is a simple noun formed from a metal
 dhaatu boy, pratipadik boy kaa kaary bhi karata he, jiskaa vibhakti laga hua bahuvachan pratyay ho saktaa he -s usamen jodne par vibhakti vaala shabd-rup boys banataa he
 More complex nouns can have a noun prefix or suffix in addition to a noun primitive
 udhaaharan ke liye, sangya archenemy ek dhaatuj upsarg arch or ek dhaatu enemy se bani he
 Here the metallic form archenemy is acting as a stem that can be used to create the inflected word form archenemies
 dhaatuj pratyay ke saath ek udhaaharan he kingdom jo dhaatu king or dom pratyay se bana he
 Some English nouns can be complex with many metallic prefixes and suffixes
 ek kaaphi jatil udhaaharan he antidisestablishmentarianism jiskaa dhaatu establish he or anti-, dis-, -ment, -ary, -an, or -ism pratyay hai
 English composite nouns are nouns that are made up of more than one stem
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt paperclip, pratipadik paper or pratipadik clip se bana he
 In English, concatenation can be subdivided into different categories based on the lexical category of each ritual and into tatapurusha, polyvahri, duality and karmadhara subtypes based on semantic class
 vachan ke liye angrezi sangyaaon main aam taur par vibhakti lagati he, jisase ekvachan or bahuvachan ke bhinn rup banate hai
 The plural form is usually composed of a singular form in which -s or -es are joined, but there are also many irregular nouns
 saadharantah, ekvachan rup kaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he jab sangya se sanderbhit ek drushtaant kii charchaa kii jaati he or bahuvachan rup kaa prayog tab hota he jab koi anya drushtaanton par charchaa kii jaati he, lekin is niyam ke kai apwaad hai
 Here are some examples: jo shabd, sangya shabdic varg se sambandhit hai, mukhya rup se sangya varg ke saral shabd ho sakate hai
 It includes words like man, dog, rice, etc
 anya sangyaaon ko anya shabdic shreniyon se sambandhit shabdon se varg-parivartansheel vibhakti pratyay ke yoga dwaara vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the suffix -ation, -ee, -ure, -al, -er, -ment, are added to verb bases to form a verb-less noun
 phir bhi anya pratyay visheshan se vyutpann visheshan-rahit sangya banaate hai: These metallic suffixes can also be added to the phrase metal such as the noun stick-it-to-itiveness, derived from the phrase + -ive + -ness
 dhaatuj pratyay ke alaava, anya shabdic shreniyon ke shabdon ko sidhe sangya main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ek "roopantaran" prakriya dwaara 
 udhaaharan ke liye, shabd run ek kriya he, lekin ise ek sangya run "besabaal khel main arjeet ank " main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki nimna vaakya main: Here it is clear that run is a noun because it is given the plural form of the inflectional plural suffix -s, it is modified by its preceding quantitative five, and it exists as the head of the noun term five runs which is the prepositional term with five
 In runs, the preposition is acting as a complement to the with
 anya shabdic shreniyon ko bhi parivartit kiya ja saktaa he: Additionally, there are many phrases that can be converted into nouns, such as jack-in-the-box, love-lies-bleeding
 These can be seen as compound
 roopantaran kii aisi prakriyaayein bhi hai jo ek sangya upvarg se duusare upvarg main parivartit hoti hai 
 Three basic noun classes can be identified in English according to syntax criteria: yah vaakya-sanrachanaatmak upvarg, shabdaarth shreniyon ke kaafii anuroop he 
 Countable and uncountable nouns - such as dog, rice - show the paradox of insertion: a dog, the dog, dogs, the dogs are all possible such as rice, the rice are both possible
 gananeey sangyaaen, agananeey sangyaaon se is prakaar alag hai ki ve naa to akele rah sakati hai or naa hi some ke dwaara visheshit ho sakati hai jab tak ki ve bahuvachan roopon main naa hon, inhen a se visheshit kiya ja saktaa he or inkaa bahuvachan ban saktaa he
 Semantically, they generally refer to easily identifiable personal objects
 gananeey sangya ke udhaaharan nimnlikhit hai: remark, book, bottle, chair, forest, idea, bun, pig, toy, difficulty, bracelet, mountain, ityadi
 Uncountable nouns, on the contrary, can be singular, can be denoted by some, cannot be denoted by a, and cannot be pluralized
 Semantically uncountable nouns denote a non-separable group
 agananeey sangyaaon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai: rice, furniture, jewelry, scenery, gold, bread, grass, warmth, music, butter, homework, baggage, sugar, coffee, luck, sunshine, water, air, Chinese, soccer, literature, rain, walking, ityadi
 The morphological-semantic difference between countable and uncountable nouns is shown in the table below
 duusari ore, vyaktivaachak sangya, jisamen vyaktigat naam shaamil hai- jaise ki Peter, Smith or sthanon ke naam jaise Paris, Tokyo - pravisheshan virodhabhas nahin dikhaate
 vishisht rup se, ek pravisheshan unka agragami nahin ho saktaa
is prakaar, *a Peter, *the Peter, *a Tokyo, *the Tokyo sabhi avyakaranik hai 
 haalanki kai vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ke aage ek pravisheshan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa, kuch vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ke aage aprihaary rup se pravisheshan lagaaya jaataa he
 These include proper nouns such as The Hague, The Dalles, the Netherlands, the West Indies, and the Andes
 However, just like proper nouns, these proper nouns with submissions without post-modification modification also lack a postpositional contradiction
 is prakaar, jabaki The Hague vyakaranik he, *a Hague or *hague avyakaranik hai
 Semantically, proper nouns have unique references
 jaisaa ki upar dekha gaya he, vibhinn upvarg, vyakaran kii sankhya or parimanatmakataa ko prabhavit karte hai
 What complicates the component of the original subclasses described above is the presence of some nouns that have duality components in more than one subclass, and the conversion of a noun from its original subclass to another subclass
 brick or cake jaisi sangyaaon ke dohare ghatak hai
 For example, look at the following sentences with brick: pehle vaakya main brick ek agananeey sangya he
 The absence of any entry before the brick can be determined, which is a sign of a uncountable noun
 In the second sentence, bricks is a countable noun because it is plural, which is only a feature of countable noun
 Other nouns that have double components in both countable and uncountable subclasses are stone, paper, beauty, difficulty, experience, light, sound, talk, and lamb
 jaisaa ki upar ullekh kiya gaya he, kai sangyaaen ek upvarg se duusare upvarg ke liye roopantaran se guzar sakati hai
 Countable noun from proper noun is a type of conversion
 ek vyaktivaachak naam, picasso lakshanik vistaar ke madhyam se ek gananeey sangya ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki is vaakya main: Although Picasso often has a particular reference, it can be used figuratively where it would mean "a painting made by Picasso"
 This changed noun can be seen under the countable subclass by the fact that it is plural and preceded by an entry
 do muhaavareydaar nirmaan bhi hai jo vyaktivaachak sangya se gananaatmak sangya roopantaran par aadhaarit hai: Here Mr
 The first sentence is interpreted as "a particular person Mr
 Smith who is otherwise unaware of you" due to the entry a in front of Smith, while in the second sentence the entry the with the permissive accent is read as "the well-known person called Margaret Thatcher "
 nirdharak main pravisheshan shaamil hai, sanketvachak, maatraatmak, sankhyatmak, sambandhkaarak, prashnvachak or vismayaadibodak jo sangya padon main sangya pramukh ko visheshit karata he
 Determinants act as words that "determine" other nouns, where "to determine" is generally understood as a sign of quantitative information, grammatical utterances, issues related to context, and noun subclass components
 "nirdhaarit" karne vaale aise kaary nirdharak ko visheshnon se ekadam alag karte he jo ki aam taur par sangya kii gunatmak jaankaree pradaan karte hai, lekin nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary nahin kar sakate
 Within the noun phrase, the determinants are next to the noun head on the left edge of the noun phrase and before any optional adjective modifier: udhaaharan nimna hai: The position of the determiner and the adjective relative to each other and to the noun root becomes clear that the adjective can never come before the determiner
 Thus, the following are the denominational English noun terms: * big the red balloon, * big red the balloon
 ek-duusare ke saapeksh apni sthiti ke anusaar nirdharakon ko teen upvarg main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Pre-determinants can come before the central determinant but not behind the central determinant
 Answer-determinants are followed by central determinants but not in the beginning
 Central-determinants should come after pre-determinants and before post-determinants
 Thus, as a central-determinant example the ek purv-nirdharak pehle aa saktaa he jaise nimna main all Or the central determinant may be used after the post-determinant, as in many purv-nirdharak + kendriya-nirdharak + uttar-nirdharak kaa saamanjasy is rup main bhi ho saktaa he However, there are several restrictions on joint possibilities
 ek saamaanya pratibandh yah he ki keval ek nirdharak teen nirdharak padon main se prayek main ho saktaa he
 For example, the answer determinants many and seven can be lekin many or seven, donon uttar-nirdharak kii sthiti main prayukt nahin ho sakate, kyonki isse nimnlikhit sangyaapad avyakaranik ho jayega: *many seven smart children, *seven many smart children, *the many seven smart children, *the seven many smart children 
 iske atirikt, aksar duusare shabdic pratibandh hote hai
 For example, the pre-determinant all can be used single or before a central determinant; However, the pre-determinant such alone or the central-determinant may precede a such nuisance! such a nuisance! purv-nirdharak ke udhaaharan hai all, both, half, double, twice, three times, one-third, one-fifth, three-quarters, such, vismayaadibodak what 
kendriya nirdharak se pehle purv-nirdharak ke aane kii sthiti ke udhaaharan: Examples of central-determinants are the, a / an, this, that, these, those, every, each, enough, much, more, most less, no, some, either, neither, which, what
 visheshan sanshodhit sangya pramukh ke purv, kendriya-nirdharak ke prayog ke udhaaharan hai: While on the one, the / a / an, no, and every serve only as determinants, on the other hand other central-determinants may also act as components of other lexical categories, especially as pronouns
 
 For example, in the following that is acting as a determinant lekin sarvnaam ke rup main In addition to the above determinant, the function of the genitive nominative with -s can be a determinative like the genitive determiner his, her, its, their
 yah sambandhkaarak nirdharak sangya pad, kendriya nirdharak kii jagah prayukt hote hai: The entry words are 'a', 'an', 'the'
 'A' is uncertain
 It is uncertain because it does not refer to any particular entity that the speaker or listener knows
 "the" is certain because the particular entity it mentions is considered by the listener to be the recipient
 pravisheshan a / an, or the aise shabd hai jo sangya ko visheshit karte hai
 They are in the position of central-determinant
 pravisheshan ke kai kaary hai jinamein nischitata ankan, vishisht / saamaanya sandarbh, bhaashan main di gai / nai jaankaree or sangya upvarg ghatak 
 The definite insertion "the" is often used to refer to a specific instance of a noun already described or easily identified
 nishchit pravisheshan, sanketvachak se thodaa bhinn hai, jo aksar vaktaa or darshakon ke sandarbh main sangya ke sthaan kaa sanket detaa he
 Adjectives usually precede the noun, ie the blue car, where blue is an adjective
 haalanki, kuch visheshan jaise lyonnaise sangya ke baad aate hai 
jab ek visheshan angrezi main sangya ke baad aata he to sampoorn rup se vaakyansh, saamanytah romance bhashaa, vishisht rup se french se grahan kiya gaya hota he
 The remnant of the grammatical gender is preserved in the other male pronouns
 jaivik ling, ke aadhaar par sajiv vastuon kaa or saamaajik paramparaon ke aadhaar par manvikrut vastuon kaa ling nirdhaaran hota he 
 "he" kaa prayog puling sangyaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he; "she" kaa prayog streeling sangyaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he; or "it" kaa prayog anishchit ling or nirjeev vastuon vaali sangya ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The use of it to refer to humans is generally considered indecent and vulgar, but is sometimes deliberately used as a crime or insult because it implies that the person is of a precarious gender or a lousy person
 
 paramparaagat rup se, puling he kaa prayog anya purush ko sanderbhit karne ke liye hota tha jiskaa ling agyaat yaa sandarbh ke liye apraasangik tha; haal hi main, ling-aadhaarit mandandon ke samarthan karne ke liye is upyog kii aalochana kii gai or ise badhate prayog ke taur par anuchit mana jaataa he 
pratisthaapan par koi aam sahmati nahin he
 Some English-speaking people prefer to use the cumbersome "he or she" or "s / he"; Other people like to use them
 There is rarely confusion in this situation, because the intended meaning can be derived from the context, for example, "this person has written me a letter, but they have not signed it
" However, it is still considered by some Is considered grammatically incorrect
 Spivak sarvnaam kaa bhi prastaav kiya gaya he jo anivaary rup se pramukh ko bahuvachan samakaksh se ghataakar nirmit kiye jate hai, lekin anya samaadhaan kii tulana main unka istemaal apekshaakrit durlabh he
 For comparison, German speakers recognize the difference between the synonyms sie, sie and Sie without any trouble
 sangya kaa vargeekaran aam taur par ek yaa adhik tatwon dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he jise deictic, numerative, epithet, and classifier kehete hai
 Historically, English used to denote nouns for causative and the two remnants of this factor notation are the pronominal system and the genitive clitic
 The genitive is marked by a clitic at the end of the particular noun
 ise nimnlikhit tareeke se samajha ja saktaa he: The clitic attached to the company does not refer to the company but to the entire noun president of the company
 ise koshthak ke upyog se or adhik spasht rup se dikhaaya ja saktaa he: The form of the English pronoun varies according to the word, man, factor and imaginary gender
 Vowel and male distinctions have collapsed in the middle language in the standard formal language, although there is a vowel distinction in informal dialect forms
 nijvachak sarvnaam, sanyukt rup hai jo sambandhkaarak nirdharak sarvnaam or uske baad -self se banate hai, jiskaa apwaad he anya purush ekvachan puling rup jo karm kaarak him + -self se banataa he or anya purush bahuvachan rup jo karm kaarak them + -self + -s se banataa he
 In the plural, the regular plural suffix -s takes place in these pronouns with the plural inflection pronoun form
 shabdaarth rup se we ke kisi bhi rup ke saath ourselves ke bajaay Ourself istemaal hota he jaise the royal "we"
 In some dialects, the other male plural and other male plural forms are formed from the genitive determinant his> hisself and their> theirself
 is prakaar, in boliyon ne sambandhkaarak rup main puri pratimaan ko niyamit kar diya he
 There are two main types of English verbs: mukhya kriyaayein ve kriyaayein hai jaise jump, catch hit or take 
 ve prakruti se shabdic hai, kriya kshetra ke bheetar mukhya shabdaarth kii jaankaree rakhte hai or ek open class hai arthath aisi kriya he jo aam taur par vaakya main mukhya kriya se pehle aati he
 They are limited in number, provide grammar information in the verb area and belong to the closed class
 vaakya main The verb is helpful
 angrezi main teen kriyaayein - be, have, or do - mukhya kriya or sahaayak kriya, donon ke rup main kaary kar sakati hai Quirk et al
 ne in kriyaaon ko primary kriya ke rup main uddhrut kiya he
 The following examples demonstrate their dual functionality: teen praathmik kriya ke alaava, anya sahaayak kriya hai kriyaarthdyotak, jisamen shaamil hai, {{1}can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, or would 
 sahaayak ke rup main kaary karne kii unki simitta ke alaava, modells sirf samaapika vaakyakhand main aa sakate hai or kaal, vachan or purush ke liye unamem vibhakti nahin lagaai ja sakati
 There is a more marginal verb in the mood denoting class, Should and British varieties also have need and dare
 inamen kriyaarth dyotak ke kai gun dikhte hai magar saare nahin or isliye inhen Quirk et al dwaara seemaant kriyaarth dyotak kaha gaya
 
 ant main, kriya used Quirk et al
 dwaara seemaant model mana gaya
 But Huddleston and Pullum found many differences between this and other models and the marginal model, concluding that it is an auxiliary verb of the most marginal type
 shabdaarth rup se used kaa sandarbh samay yaa kaal se he, jo ise model se alag pahchaan detaa he jinke mukhya shabdaarth ghatak ke rup main roopaatmakataa he
 There are only eight possible inflected forms of the English verb: yojak be ke aath vibhakti rup hai jaisaa ki neeche udhaaharan ke vaakyon main dekha ja saktaa he: However, most verbs have only four different inflectional types: yojak be ke vipareet, jump kriya kaa, aadhaar, saamaanya gaiyr-bhoot or pratham ekvachan gaiyr-bhoot rup main samaan samanvayi shabd-rup aadhaar jump he or samaan samanvayi shabd-rup aadhaar jumped -en, saamaanya bhoot or 1st / 3rd sg
 bhoot rup 
 yojak ke saath anya kriya kii tulana karne par yah pataa chalata he ki keval ek yojak kaa 1st / 3rd sg
 bhoot rup he jo saamaanya bhoot se alag he, ek 1st sg
 gaiyr-bhoot rup he jo ki saamaanya gaiyr-bhoot se alag he or ek aadhaar rup he jo saamaanya gaiyr-bhoot rup se alag he - anya sabhi kriyaayein in roopon main samanvayata darshaati hai
 The additive and a regular jump can be compared to each other and three types of irregular verbs in the table below
 sabhi kriya -ing rup, dhaatu main -ing pratyay lagaakar banaati hai: All regular verbs and most irregular verbs, by adding the -s suffix to the metal, form the other male singular forms
 upar, koshthkeey yah ingit karata he ki is pratyay ko -es yaa -s ke rup main likhte hai
 The -es form comes after a warm dish
 -s vartanee, anya sabhi swaron ke baad aati he
 Examples: sabhi niyamit kriyaayein bhoot / -en rup kaa nirmaan -ed pratyay lagaakar hota he: Irregular verbs may have the same concatenation as regular verbs, or show less concordance with five different forms, or more concordance with only three distinct forms
 Three types of examples with differences in the number of different inflectional forms: paanch alag vibhakti rup vaali aniyamit kriyaayein, saamaanya bhoot or -en roopon ke saath samanvayi nahin he
 Irregular verbs with only three forms are coordinative in all forms, not just the -ing form and the other male non-past
 paanch or chaar vibhakti rup vaali aniyamit kriyaaon kaa vibhinn tareekon se bhoot or -en nirmaan hota he
 Several methods include vowel expletives and / or suffix combinations
 Some of the more common methods are briefly mentioned below
 dhyaan den ki vartanee hameshaa aantarik swar main uccharan badlaav ko pratibimbit nahin karti he, atah uccharan kaa lipyaantaran dhvanyatmak rup se kiya gaya he: There is an irregular change between the common present of some verbs and the other male singular: yojak pratimaan main bhi pratyay or swar apashruti he, lekin yah atirikt poorak dwaara chihnit he
 One final point to mention is that some verbs are defective in the sense that they are not metaphorical or suffer from lack of conversion
 kriya beware kaa dhaatu rup beware hi he
 It is usually found in prescriptive sentences: bewaring, bewares, bewared rup aadhunik angrezi main asaamaanya hai
 The verb used is usually used in the past tense, such as yaa aadhaar rup main keval do ke baad, jaise The verb used refers to an action that is regularized or refers to the past tense and should not be confused with another verb use which is a regular verb
 kai vaktaaon ke liye stride kriya ke vibhakti pratimaan main bhootkaalik kridant kii kami he doshapurn hai
 Among the auxiliary verbs, be, have, and do are modified for tense, vow and man
 sahaayak kriya be ke ek mukhya kriya ke rup main samaan aath vibhakti rup hai or have or do ke bhi vaise hi paanch vibhakti rup hai jab mukhya kriya ke rup main ve kaary karte hai
 In contrast, based on these grammatical parameters, models are non-modifying auxiliary verbs
 haalanki, adhikansh sahaayak kriyaayein nishedh ke atirikt roopantaran ko saajha karti hai
 Negative inflection is formed by the -n't suffix that is associated with the auxiliary
 is prakaar, roopantarit sahaayak kriyaaon ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai: have '' ' model can't couldn't mayn't mightn't mustn't shan't won't wouldn't Marginal auxiliary verbs daren't needn't oughtn't used nakaaratmak rup don't or won't aantarik swar main apane parivartanon main aniyamit hai or shan't antim vyanjan ke apane vilopan main aniyamit he or america angrezi ke maanak kismon main lagbhag anupasthit hai
 Traditional grammar sees -n't as an inflectional suffix but only an acoustic form of the grammatical word not
 According to this view, there is not equal to 'has + not, does not = does + not, etc
'
 ye sankuchit nakaaratmak rup, is prakaar, anya sahaayak kriyaaon ke laghu roopon, yani are > ’re, is > ’s, am > ’m, have > ’ve, has > ’s, had > ’d, does > ’s, will > ’ll, would > ’d 
 ke samatuly ban gaye hai yadhyapi yah nakaaratmak rup kaa aitihaasik janm he, spasht rup se aadhunik bhashaa main, in shabdon main -n't pratyay he jo ek ekal avibhajya shabd banaata he chunki nakaaratmak sahaayak kriya, + not nirmit vinyas kii tulana main alag vaakyatmak vyavhaar pradarshit karti he
 Additionally, it can also be shown that short forms of other auxiliaries do not behave similarly to negative auxiliaries: ant main, nakaaratmak vibhakti gun aam taur par sahaayak kriya par lagu hota he, lekin mukhya kriya par nahin
 tathaapi, "praathmik" kriya ko lekar iske do apwaad hai
 Negative inflection can be applied to the verb be as the main verb as shown in the following example: british kismon main have kaa mukhya kriya ke rup main nakaaratmak rup ho saktaa he, jabaki zyaadaatar america kismon ke liye yah avyakaranik he: However, other "primary" verbs cannot have a negative form, acting as the main verb
 sahaayak kriya ke gunon kaa, be or have par lagu hone kaa yah maamla, anya vaakyatmak vyavhaar bhi main dekha jaataa he jaise ki karta ke vyutkram or sahaayak kriya ke oparator main
 Thus, 've,' m, 's, etc
 are truncated forms of phonologically isolated words while the negative -n't is not a compressed isolated word but a suffix
 zyaadaatar angrezi kriyaayein keval gaiyr-bhootkaal, indicative mood main vachan ko ingit karti hai
 In this context, other men and all other men have a paradox: other men are marked with the -s suffix while all other men are unmarked
 Furthermore, the inflectional suffix -s denotes singular meaning that -s denotes another male singular subject
 isi tarah, ekvachan keval anya purush main darshaya jaataa he - baaki purushon main vachan achihnit rahata he
 The plural in the other male is unmarked
 anya purush ekvachan pratyay, saamaanya vartmaan kaal ke rup main joda jaataa he jabaki atichihnit rup, saamaanya vartmaan kaal rup he
 In this way, there is only a distinction between the common present form and the other male singular form
 nijvachak sarvnaam karta ke saath sanyukt, karta-kriya ke nimnlikhit sambhav yugma hai: However, the additive be makes an additional distinction in the non-past tense in the Uttam male singular and in the past perfective or other male singular
 Unlike other verbs, these modified forms of be remain in a complementary relationship
 switching ek satat kriya he
 Pronoun subject-verb combination: sambhavya kriyaarth main purush or vachan ke sabhi bhed tatasth ho jate hai 
 English verbs explore primarily with the subject, such as the following: lekin, angrezi, kriya ko un sangyaapad se anvay kii anumati detii he jo vishisht rup se karta kii sthiti main nahin hai: The first auxiliary verb in the verb field is called an operator
 yah vibhinn vaakyatmak or roopim visheshtaon ko pradarshit karata he
 The following wikiprojects or Portals may be able to help recruit one: saanchaa:none exists The tense change in English can be achieved by making the last change and using the auxiliary verbs "to be" and "to have" and the auxiliary "will" "shall" "would"
 nimna udhaaharan niyamit kriya to listen kaa upyog karte hai: The present tense describes the action that is currently taking place
 The verb must be now, or it will not be interpreted by the present tense
 bhoot kaal aisi kriya kaa varnan karata he jo ateet main hui he 
kaary puraa ho saktaa he yaa adhuraa
 The future tense describes an action that is to occur in the future
 The action has not yet been completed, or has not been expressed by the future tense
 sahaayak kriya kaa prayog kaal, pahalu, yaa ek kriya vaakyansh ke kriyaarth ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 As mentioned above, "going to" is used for some pseudo-future tense: "do" ke roopon kaa upyog, kuch nakaaratmak ke saath, prashnon ke liye or saamaanya vartmaan or saamaanya ateet par jor dene ke liye kiya jaataa he: ! " ! " Some people think that the English verb tense can be better seen in the following table, which refers to the time of the English language and its three sides, namely, pre, complete and incomplete
 dhyaan den ki yah sarini keval vastav main ho rahi kriya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he chaahe vah vartmaan, bhoot yaa bhavishya ho
 chunki avastavik hetumd, zaahir taur par dharanaen hai, 'would' vaali hetumd sanrachanaayen yahaan shaamil nahin kii gai hai
 In practical terms it forms the following table: angrezi main kriya ke liye do vachya hai: kartri vachya or karm vachya
 mul rup kartri kriya he or yah SVO paddati kaa anugaman karti he
 The passive voice is derived from the passive voice using the auxiliary verb "to be" and the -en form of the main verb
 karm vachya ke udhaaharan hai: Furthermore, the agent and patient switch grammatical roles between inheritance and karma speech so that in karma the patient is the subject, and the agent is noted in an optional prepositional phrase using by, for example: kriya ke karm vachya swaroop kaa nirmaan, samaan kaal or pahalu main kriya ko to be se sthanapann karke or mukhya kriya ke -en swaroop ko sanlagn karke kiya jaataa he
 Like this: yah paddati sabhi samgr kaalon main bhi jari he
 The semantic effect of the change of karma from karta, is the impersonalization of a verb
 kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog kisi vaakya ke pratyaksh karm ke prakarnikaran ke liye hota he, yaa jab agent yaa to agyaat he yaa mahatvaheen, tab bhi, jab shaamil kiya gaya ho, jaise: Many writing style guides, including Strunk and White, recommend minimizing the use of verbs in English, but many others do not
 angrezi main ek teesraa 'vachya' he, clasik "madhyam" vachya se sambandhit
 isamen, pesheynt, karta ban jaataa he jaisaa ki karm vachya main lekin jahiraa taur par kriya kartri vachya main rahati he, pratyaksh rup se koi agent nahin diya ja saktaa or aam taur par, ek kriya visheshan puure nirmaan ko visheshit karta he
 Like this: angrezi kriya ke "kriyaarth" hai
 These always include declarative / indicative and probabilistic moods, and ordinarily ordinals are included as moods
 kuch log hetumad yaa prashnvachak rup ko kriyamoolak kriyaarth ke rup main shaamil karte hai
 The most commonly used verb forms are examples, such as: in kriyaarth kaa sangyojan tab or adhik jatil ho jaataa he jab unka prayog alag-alag kaalon ke saath hota he
 However, informally spoken English is rarely used with the probabilistic and is usually limited to the etymological mood, the present common and the common past
 iskaa ek ullekhneey apwaad he ajyaasuchak yaa ichhasuchak vaakyakhand main vartmaan sambhavya kaa prayog jo ek yaa do tareekon se chihnit kiya jaataa he: yadi anya purush ekvachan, ghoshnaatmak kriyaarth dwaara apekshit sangyojan "-s" anupasthit or bhoot kaal kaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, "they insisted that he go to chapel every morning" means that going to his chapel was his demand or requirement
 tathaapi, "they insisted that he went to chapel every morning" kaa arth he ki ve us bayaan ko phir kah rahe hai ki, ateet main, vah har subah chapel main shaamil hota tha
 The grammar underlying such a difference is called "american Probabilistic"
 british angrezi aisa antar nahin karti
duusari ore, ichha or ajna ko vyakt karne ke liye anya nirmaan jo sambhavya kaa prayog nahin karte, utane hi aam hai, jaise "they required him to go


" ! Sit! Eat! "the prescriptive mood in English occurs only in the middle male, and the subject is not usually explicitly stated, because it is implicit
 jab ek vaktaa kisi or ke bare main aadesh detaa he, to vah tab bhi madhyam purush ko nirdeshit hota he, jaise ki yah anumati ke liye anurodh kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah ek alankarik bayaan ho saktaa he
 The etymological forms of the verb are used to express if-then statements, or to indicate or indicate a future indefinite verb, in response to counterfactual propositions
 Hetumad may be considered a form of tense but sometimes They are considered to be an active mood i
e
 hetumad ko kriyamoolak sahaayak could, would, should, may and might ke saath kriya ke pratipadik rup ke sangyojan ke prayog se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Note that for many speakers "may" and "might" are assimilated in a sense, indicating that the statement's conclusion is inconclusive
 "may" main nihitarth anumati keval madhyam purush tathaa anya purush ke saath katipay prayogon main hi simit lagati he, udhaaharan ke liye"you may leave the dinner table", yaa "she may leave the dinner table
" Two main conditional tenses can be identified in English: hadalaston or pulam dwaara angrezi main bhavishya kaal nahin he ke liye diya gaya mukhya tark yah he ki apane vyakaran or apane arth, donon main "will" ek model kriya he
 Biber et al
 Let's go further and say that there are only two tenses in English, past and present: they see the full form of "have" under "aspect"
 hadalaston or pulam, duusari taraf, "have" vaale roopon ko " "dwitiyak kaal" ke rup main maanate hai
 Adjectives are words that can be used as adjectives in a noun phrase where they modify the noun head and as an attribute in the verb noun where they complement the additive verb
 udhaaharan ke liye, neeche vaakya main visheshan tall sangya pad the tall man main sangya pramukh man ko visheshit kar rahaa he
 The adjective nice comes as a complement to the verb head is within the verb term is nice
 visheshan, visheshan pad ke pramukh ke rup main bhi kaary karata he jaise nimnlikhit main: Here the adjective tall and nice are the heads of the adjective terms very tall and rather nice
 shabdaarth rup se visheshan unke bare main adhik jaankaree pradaan karte hai
 Adjectives are used to identify and describe a noun associated with itself
 visheshan kii ek or roopim visheshta, jo kriyavisheshan ke saath saajha bhi hoti he, vah he tulanaatmak rup main unki roopantaran kii kshamta: tall-er, tall-est 
 tulana anubhag bhi dekhen
 The term adverb, which originates from traditional grammar, has a wide range of words that have different functions and different syntactic behaviors
 isliye, kriyavisheshan ko vibhinn upvargon main vibhajit karnaa or prayek upvarg ke vyakaran kii alag se charchaa karnaa behatar he
 See also the comparison section
 tulanaatmak kriyavisheshan ek shreneebaddh shabdaarth visheshtaon par kisi bindu ko visheshit karata he
 Below are some comparative adverbs: vaakya-rachana ke anusaar, tulanaatmak kriyavisheshan visheshan yaa kriyavisheshan ko purv-sanshodhit karte hai: Prepositions are words that denote the relationship between a noun and someone else
 aam taur par sangya se pehle rakhe jate hai: udhaaharan, on, to, with, by
 English is a subject verb language: it prefers a sequence of subject – verb – object in its simplest, unmarked declarative statements
 is prakaar, "tom eats cheese " or "mary sees the cat" However, beyond these simple examples, word order is a complex matter in English
 vishesh rup se, prayek khand main vaktaa yaa lekhak kaa prasthaan bindu, sandesh ke gathan main ek mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Thus, elements in a message can be ordered in such a way that indicates to the reader or listener the implications of the message
 prasthaan ke bindu ko bhi ek sameekaran ke rup main nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he, jo vishaygat samanta ke rup main gyaat he
 In this way, virtually any element can be preceded in a clause
 aam taur par, prasthaan kaa bindu ek ghoshnaatmak khand kaa vishay he; yah achihnit rup he
 The point of departure is marked when the doer is not - thus, sometimes it is a karma and most often an adverbial phrase
 prashnon main, prasthaan ke bindu se thode alag dhang se vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 English questions come in two types: wh-questions and yes-no questions
 Any type of simple question starts with a word that indicates what the speaker wants to know
 vishesh prashn is kunjee "what i want to know" shabd ko kisi anya tatv se visthapit kar dete hai
 Both types of mandatory clause are "I want you to do something" or "I want you and me to do something
" The second type usually starts with let us, in the unmarked form of the first type, you are implied and not clarified and included in the marked form; another marked form is "do improve your grammar
" Negative In, "do not argue with me" is unchecked and "do not you argue with me" is marked
 bolchaal kii angrezi main, prasthaan kaa bindu swar-style dwaara baar-baar chihnit hota he
 Generally, English is a head-initial language, that is, the anchor of the phrase comes at the beginning of the phrase
 mukhya apwaad yah he ki saamaanya visheshak, sangya vaakyansh se pehle aate hai: The sentence that inspired it is "fred's sister ran quickly to the store
" As can be inferred from this example, the sequence of an original sentence: Adjective1 - Subject - Verb - Adverb - Adjective2 - Indirect Object - Adjective3 - Direct Object
 prashnvachak vaakya, shabd kram ko ulataa kar dete hai 
ek vaakya kaa kartri se karm vyakaranik vachya parivartan, shabd kram ko badal detaa he, nae karta ko saamne laate hue or shabdic yaa vyakaranik balaghat ise kai maamalon main bhi badal detaa he 
 There are also some OSV word order usage in English, especially when compared with the use of pronouns that are marked for causative
 udhaaharan ke liye, "I hate oranges, but apples i will eat
"haalanki bahut kam, lekin phir bhi kabhi-kabhi OVS prayog hota he, "if it is apples you like, then apples like I," haalanki yah aakhri prayog mul vaktaaon ko kaalpanik or kaaldoshaukt lag saktaa he
 Interrogative word order is used to ask questions, with or without expectation of an answer
 Most of the time, it is formed by changing the place of the subject and the auxiliary verb in a declarative sentence, as in the following: baharhaal, jab maangi gai jaankaree, jawaab kaa karta hogi to shabd kram ulataa nahin hoga or prashnvachak sarvnaam karta kii jagah le letaa he, jaisaa ki nimna main: When spoken, a change of rhythm is often used to emphasize this change, or may in some cases demonstrate complete questioning
 The construction of the interrogative phrase is thus converted into a signifier, relative pronoun and quantifier, etc
, by introducing the predicate of a declarative sentence in front of an auxiliary verb
 ek prashnvachak chihn ke saath vaakya samaapt karnaa, prashnvachak vaakyansh kaa dyotak he 
 The rhetorical question can be constructed by placing the auxiliary verb pair at the end of the question, for example "" You would not really do that, would you? " angrezi main teen prakaar ke prashnvachak vaakya hote hai: Yes / No questions require an 'yes' or 'no' answer
 If there is a modal verb, an auxiliary verb or a 'to be' form of the verb in a sentence, put it in front of the subject
 agar vaakya main koi model kriya, sahaayak kriya yaa 'to be' kriya nahin he to yes / no sawaal, sahaayak kriya 'do' kii madad se banate hai
 The auxiliary verb 'do' has no meaning
 yah vaakya main sirf mukhya kriya ke anusaar rup letaa he
 'do' - in the present tense: if the subject of the sentence is a noun in the perfect male singular or plural, the middle male singular or plural and the other male plural
 'does' - vartmaan kaal main: agar yadi vaakya kaa karta, anya purush main sangya he 
 'did' - in the past tense note : yes / no sawaal main mukhya kriya bina kisi ant ke aati he yaa bhoot kaal ke maamle main - apane pratham rup main 
 To form a negative yes / no question, you must put a negative modal verb before the subject, a negative auxiliary verb or a negative form of the verb 'to be'
 yadi aapako sahaayak kriya 'do' kii madad se nakaaratmak yes / no sawaal banane kii jarurat he, to aapako 'do' does, yaa did ke bajaae 'don't', doesn't, didn't kaa upyog karnaa hoga
 Combined negatives are used in more formal English: soochna yaa Wh- sawaalon ko jawaab ke liye atirikt jaankaree kii aavashyaktaa hoti he 
is tarah ke sawaal banane main aapako prashn shabd daalane hote hai vaakya ke saamne saare shabd usee vaakyansh main ek saath
 agar prashn shabd karta kaa hissaa he to aapako shabd kram badalane kii jarurat nahin he
 The word order remains the same as in the statement
 agar prashn shabd karta kaa hissaa nahin he to aapako prashn shabd ke baad or karta ke saamne ek model kriya, ek sahaayak kriya yaa 'to be' kriya kaa prayog karnaa hoga
 If there is no modal verb, auxiliary verb or 'to be' verb in the sentence, then you have to use the auxiliary verb 'do' after the question word and in front of the subject
 Note : soochna prashn main mukhya kriya bina kisi ant ke aati he yaa bhoot kaal ke maamle main – iske pratham rup main 
 See also: # Negation, negative polarity, and assertion
 viyojak prashn tag sawaal aise vaktavy hai jinke ant main tag hota he
 The tag is made up of two or three parts
 pehla bhaag : ek model kriya, ek sahaayak kriya, yaa 'to be' kriya kaa ek rup sarvnaam ke liye aavashyak rup main tisare bhaag main
 The second part: the statement 'not' if the statement is positive
 yadi bayaan nakaaratmak he, to nipaat kaa lop ho jaataa he
 Third part: The subject of the statement, expressed by a noun
 vaakya main agar koi model kriya, sahaayak kriya yaa 'to be' kriya nahin he to aapako tag main sahaayak kriya 'do' kaa prayog karnaa hoga
 note bre main mukhya kriya 'to have', ek sahaayak ke rup main vyavhaar karti he
 If the subject of the sentence is the indefinite pronoun 'somebody' in the tag, it is replaced by the pronoun 'they'
 ‘nothing’, ‘never’, ‘hardly’ jaise shabd vaakya ko nakaaratmak banaate hai, atah tag sakaaratmak hona chahie
 If the sentence begins with 'there', the word is counted as a pronoun, then it is placed in the third part of the tag
 yadi vaakya ek ajyaasuchak he, to tag hoga 'will you' yaa ‘won’t you’ / ‘will you not’
 If the sentence contains 'let us', then the tag will be 'shall we'
 adhik aupchaarik angrezi main sakaaratmak vaakyon ke tag main sanyukt nakaaratmak kaa upyog hota he: Meaning of tag tag sawaal main vyakti ko vaktavy par pratikriya dene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Negative tags require a 'yes' answer
 sakaaratmak tag ko ek 'no' jawaab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Subject control: Object control: non-tensed VP topicaliztion: but not instead non-tensed VP movement with do-support ! Do not ever accept this job position ! restrictions on not : Adjectives and adverbs typically have the semantic feature of gradation, that is, the properties or positions they describe, present on a gradual scale between two opposite poles
 udhaaharan ke liye, vilom shabd cold tathaa hot ke bich krambaddh paimaana maujuud he
 There can be many conversions of such classifiable words, which characterize the specific quality or state of the scale, based on the following + {adjectiveadverb} { \ displaystyle \ left + { \ begin {bmatrix} adjective \ \ adverb \ end {bmatrix}}} combinations: very quickly rather quickly quite quickly too quickly quickly Most adjectives are classifiable, but some adjectives are not
 For example, the adjective infinite is not classable, making the phrases very infinite, rather infinite and more infinite meaningfully odd
 vargeekaran yogya visheshan or kriya visheshan ko bhi tulana main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he jahaan do yaa do se adhik tattvon kii kramik paimaane par sthitiyon kii ek duusare se tulana kii jaati he
 Semantically, three types of comparison can be identified: ek hi darje kii tulana keval saamaanya mul visheshan rup kaa upyog karti he
 Comparisons are indicated by applying inflectional suffixes using -er, -est, or by joint structures including more, most converters before adjectives, compared to higher levels
 teen vibhaktipradhan roopon ke naam hantulana kii avasthaa Low-level comparisons only use composite structures consisting of less and less adjective variables
 udhaaharan: The ellipsis refers to the deletion of parts of a sentence, when those parts are referable to a statement

 Nevertheless, some grammatical environments have some other forms of alternative, so are mandatory in some grammatical environments

 Other types of non-coordinated alternative ellipses are the following: padlope ke kuch khaas prakaar, bhashaa kii ek bahut hi anaupchaarik yaa parichit style kaa sanket dete hai, jabaki is pahalu se anya prakaar tatasth hai
 The type of ellipsis that is always mandatory includes control structures

 Lohia believed that democracy is not possible without the lingua franca
 1957 se chhedi gayi is muhim main 1962-63 main jansangh bhi shaamil ho gaya
 But due to the demise of Lohia ji, anti-hindi movement in the south, political cravings of politicians, this movement could not succeed
 samaajawaadee raajnneeti ke purodha dow raamamanohar lohia ke bhashaa sambandhi samast chintan or andolan kaa lakshya bhartiya saarvajanik jivan se angareji ke varchasv ko hataanaa tha
 Lohia had no objection to the mere English language
 angareji ke vipul sahitya ke bhi vah virdohi nahin the, balki vichaar or shodh kii bhashaa ke rup main vah angareji kaa sammaan karte the
 Ram Manohar Lohia did the most work in the promotion of Hindi after Mahatma Gandhi
 ve sagun samaajwaad ke pakshdhar the
 He said in the Lok Sabha: 1950 main jab bhartiya samvidhan lagu hua tab usamen bhi yah vyavastha di gai thi ki 1965 tak suvidha ke hisaab se angreji kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he lekin uske baad hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja diya jayega
 Before the constitutional deadline was met, Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia converted the English Hatao Movement into an active movement in 1957
 ve puure bharat main is andolan kaa prachaar karne lage
 The Jana Sangh also became actively involved in this movement in 1962–63
 lekin is dauraan dakshin bharat ke rajyon andolan kaa virodh hone laga
 The DMK party under the leadership of Annadurai in Tamil Nadu intensified the anti-hindi movement
 iske baad kuch shaharon main andolan kaa hinsak rup bhi dekhne ko mila
 In many places, English signboards written above the shops were broken

 The ruling rulers introduced the issue of Hindi as an imperialist language and fought the dispute between Hindi and other Indian languages, calling it a threat to national unity and integrity
 ise desh jodak bhashaa nahin, desh todak bhashaa bana diya
 Lohia denied that in the freedom movement, Hindi has worked as a language connecting the country
 desh main ekta sthapit kii he, aage bhi is bhashaa main sambhaavna he
 At the same time, he also said that if Hindi does not want to be the language of government, administration, court-court then it should be replaced by any other Indian language
 jaruri ho to hindi ko bhi shaamil kar liya jaae
 But the dominance of English should not be replaced by the mother tongue of India
 lohia jab 'angareji hataane' kii baat karte hai, to uskaa matlab 'hindi laana' nahin he
 Rather, Lohia has a special understanding behind the slogan of removing English
 lohia bhartiya janata par thopi gai angareji ke sthaan par bhartiya bhashaaon ko pratishtha dilaane ke pakshdhar the
 On 19 September 1962 in Hyderabad, Lohia said, unke liye swabhaasha raajnneeti kaa mudda nahin balki apane swabhimaan kaa prashn or lakhon–karodon ko hin granthi se ubarkar aatmavishvaas se bhar dene kaa swapn tha– During the anti-hindi agitations of the south, Lohia was agitating against English in the whole of South India and in favor of Hindi and other Indian languages
 hindi ke prati jhukaav kii vajah se durbhaagya se dakshin bharat ke kuch logon ko lohia uttar or brahman samskruti ke pratinidhi ke rup main dikhaai dete the
 In South India, the slogan of 'english Hatao' meant 'lao Hindi'
