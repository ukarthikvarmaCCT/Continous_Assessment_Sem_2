 This was definitely a differentiator
 " film ke postaron dwaara bhi iske 70 mimi kii film ke upyog par jor diya gaya, jin par film kaa naam cinemascope ke logo se mail khaataa hua sa shailibaddh kiya gaya tha
 The film's posters also served to distinguish Sholay from other films older than this; One of them even added the English tagline: "the Greatest Starcast Ever Assembled - The Greatest Story Ever Told" vastav main jo film us samay filmaayi gayi thi, uskaa ant bahut alag tha
 Thakur kills Gabbar in the original story, and apart from this there were many such scenes, which were different in the original story
 gabbar kii mrityu kaa drishy, or iske saath saath gabbar dwaara imam ke bete kii hatya or thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar vaale sabhi drishyon ko bhartiya sensor board ne hataa diya tha
 The Censor Board was concerned that people should not be affected by such violent scenes and people would not be killed in the same way to take revenge on other people irrespective of the law
 haalanki sippi ne is drishy ko film kaa hissaa banaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi ladaai ladi, par baad main is drishy ko sensor board ke nirdeshaanusaar phir se shoot kiya gaya, jisamen thakur ke gabbar ko maarane se kuch hi samay pehle police aa jaati he
 For 15 years before it was screened in theaters, people got to see the film directed by the censor board
 1990 main iskaa bina sensor kiya hua british sanskaran vieches main pradarshit hua
 Eros Entertainment then released two separate DVD versions of it; The first was an uncensored 204-minute original film, and the second was a 198-minute film approved by the censor board
 vidwaanon ne film ke kai vishyon kaa ullekh kiya he, jaise ki hinsa kii mahima, saamanti vichaaron kaa parivartan, saamaajik vyavastha ko banaae rakhane waalon or sangathit hokar lut karne waalon ke bich bahes, samalangik gaiyr romani saamaajik bandhan or rashtriya ruparekha ke rup main film kii bhoomika
 Kaushik Banerjee, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, noted that Sholay demonstrated a "sympathetic construction of fake virility" through the examples of Jai and Viru
 banerjee ne yah bhi tark diya ki film ke dauraan vaidhata or aapraadhikta ke bich kii naitik seemaa dhire-dhire khatm ho jaati he
 Film scholar Vimal Dissanayake agrees that the film served to bring "a new stage in the dialectic developed between violence and social order" in Indian cinema
 film vidwaan em
 madhav prasad ke anusaar jai or viru ek haashie vaali aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jo paramparaagat samaaj main pesh kii jaati he
 Prasad also said that, through the elements of revenge, while highlighting the criminality of Jai and Veeru, the way they were embedded in the story, it reflected reactionary politics, forcing the audience to accept the feudal order

 The villain of the film, Gabbar Singh, received good reactions from the audience despite his widespread sadistic cruelty
 disanayake bataate hai ki darshakon ko charitra ke samvaad or vyavhaar se mohit kiya gaya tha, or inhen tatwon ne gabbar ke karnaamon par pardaa daalane kaa bhi kaam kiya, jo ki kisi bhartiya drama film main pehali baar hua tha
 He noted that the portrayal of violence in the film was seductive but unbearable
 unhone aage kaha ki, "puraani drama filmon ke vipareet, jinamein maadaa sharir darshakon ke dhyaan ko apni ore aakarshith rakhata tha, sholay main ek nar centrebindu par he; yah ek yuddh ke maidan sa he jahaan achchhai or buraai ke bich sarvocchata ke liye pratispardhaa chalati he
 Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be seen as a symbol of the national framework: it lacks a cozy logical narrative, it repeatedly challenges social stability, and at the same time lacks emotion in human Depreciation of life is also shown
 ek saath rakhane par, ye sabhi tatv bharat kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Sholay's narrative style, its violence, and the actions of revenge and vigilance are sometimes compared by scholars to political unrest in India at the time of its release
 yah tanaav 1975 main pradhan mantri indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal main samaapt hua
 Dissanayake and Sahay also noted the fact that, although many elements in the film were derived from Hollywood's Western style films, especially its scenes, the film was still successfully "indianized"
 udhaaharan ke taur par, wiliam vine der hide ne sholay main ek narsanhaar drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west ke ek drishy se kii thi
 Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasized the values and melodramatic tradition of Indian families, whereas Western films were more materialistic and restrained in outlook
 inacychlopedia of hindi cinema main maithili raav ne note kiya ki sholay western style ko "saamantivaadi vichaar" main dhaal detii he
 Ted Shane of the Chicago Reader noted Sholay's "historical Visual Style" and the intermittent "populist Message"

 Sardar noted that the film had two major Muslim characters; Surma Bhopali, and another a helpless victim of dacoits; Additionally, the only function of a female character is to face fate by remaining silent, while the other female character is nothing but a beautiful rural woman
 kuch vidwaanon ne sanket diya he ki sholay main samalangik gaiyr prem prasangayukt vishay bhi hai
 Ted Shane describes the relationship shown between Jay and Veeru in the film as compared to the camp genre
 apni pustak bollywood and globalaligeshan: indian popular cinema, nesan and diaspora main dina holtzman kaa kahana he ki jai kii mrityu ne donon purush paatro ke bich ke sambandhon ko todane kaa kaam kiya taaki ek maanak sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake

 It is available on the film's LP record
 sholay film 15 agast 1975 ko bharat ke swatantrata diwas ke maukey par mumbai main release hui
 Due to negative reviews and lack of effective publicity, the film did not do much for the first two weeks of its debut, although its viewership began to grow from the third week onwards due to positive oral hype

 Anthem drama is called opera
 opera kaa udbhav 1594 i
 main italy ke floronce nagar main "laa daafne" naamak opera ke pradarshan se hua tha, yadhyapi is opera ke prastutakarta swayan yah nahin jaanate the ki ve anjaane kis mahatvapurn kala kii vidha ko janm de rahe hai
 Over the last four centuries, many interpretations of the opera have been presented
 lekin parampara or anubhav ke aadhaar par yahi mana jaataa he ki opera ganabaddh naatak hota he, jisamen vaartalap ke sthaan par gaaya jaataa he
 The historical reason for this is that until the 16th century it was believed that the play should be in verse
 naatak ke liye padya yadi anivaary he to sangeet ke liye bhoomi swat: taiyaar ho jaati he
 Because poetry and music are complementary arts, both relate more to abstract emotions and imagination
 isliye jab tak naatak kavy main likhe jate rahe tab tak vishesh kathinaayee nahin hui, lekin kalantar main naatak kii vidha ne gadhy kaa rup liya tathaa yatharthonmukh hui
 Since then, difficulties for operars have increased
 chunki opera kaa janm italy main hua tha isliye uske saare angon par italy kaa prabhutv swaabhaavik tha
 But the talent of France and Germany was also involved in beautifying and developing the opera, so the opera grew over time in many disciplines
 italy main opera paanch ankon kaa hota tha lekin france main vah teen ankon kaa hi hota tha
 His musical side was more robust in Italy, with more attention paid to his subject matter in France
 lekin opera ke itihaas par italy or germany kii hi pratibhaaon ne dishaakaari prabhaav daalaa
 The major distinctions of the play are embedded in both operas and tragedies
 italy ke operakaar naatakeey trisandhiyon ko nahin sweekaarte the
 The Italian operars have been concentrating more on music and grand stage, while other operatives have been focused on the opera theatrical meaning "libretto"

 aaj vaartalapon main jo yatharthata tathaa dainik akavyatmakataa aa gai he use operakaar kis prakaar sangeet main nibaddh karen, yah aaj ke opera kii samasya he
 Like plays, the story of opera was also taken from religious narratives in the beginning

 This meant that the opera came to Rome from Greece
 is kaaran us kaal ke operon main do hi bhavanaayen pramukh hai, mahatvakanksha or kaamana
 Today the drama has stood in the midst of life, so the opera has to come there and this journey is 400 years
 kathavstu ke saath-saath sangeet ke talmail main bhi parivartan hua he
 In the beginning, opera would be the main drama and the music was secondary, but the dramaturgy became secondary and the music took prominence respectively
 pehle kathavstu ko manoranjak banane ke liye gaan, sahagaan tathaa samoohgaan kii vyavastha kii
 After this the principle of continuous music made the entire opera musical
 ab vaataavaran, chithran, bhavadasha aadi sabhi ke liye sangeet kii yojana hone lagi
 That is why the music writer is not as important as the playwright in the opera

 For centuries the dominance of Italian musicians, artists, theatrical writers and actors remained in opera houses across Europe

 were considered proof

 Philosophy has been the most important and important contribution of German operars
 pehla german operakaar glak he, jo opera kaa sudhaarak kehalaata he
 Even after 200 years, listening to his creations is an artistic experience

 yatayaat sanket yaa sadak sanket, sadak kaa upyog karne waalon ko jaankaree pradaan karne ke liye sadakon ke kinare lagaae gaye sanketon ko kehete hai
 With the increase in the number of vehicles over the past eight decades, many countries have adopted or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to help facilitate international travel and generally increase traffic safety
 is tarah ke sachitr sanketon main shabdon ke sthaan par chinhon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or ye aam taur par antarrashtriya protocol par aadhaarit hote hai
 Such signs were first developed in Europe and have been adopted by most countries at various levels
 yatayaat sambandhi sanketon ko kai prakaaron main baanta ja saktaa he
 For example, Schedule 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signs, which included 52 signatory countries on 30 June 2004, defines eight categories of these signs: america, canada or australia main sanketon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: In the United States, the ranges, locations, and graphic standards for traffic signs and pavement signs are statutorily defined as standards in the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
 dishaatmak sanketon main ek apekshaakrit anaupchaarik antar agrim dishaatmak sanketon, aadan-pradaan vaale dishaatmak sanketon or aashwaasan sambandhi sanketon ke bich kaa antar he
 Advance directional signals appear at a certain distance from the interchange signals indicating each direction
 kai desh aage sadak he ke liye jaankaree nahin dete balki keval baayin or daayin ore kii dishaao kii jaankaree dete hai
 Advance directional signals enable drivers to take precautions for clearance
 They do not often appear on small roads, but are usually applied on expressways and motorways, because without these, the driver will forget the evacuation
 Although each country has its own system, the first access signal for a motorway clearance is mostly placed at least 1000 meters from the actual interchange
 us sanket ke baad vaastavik interchange se pehle vishesh rup se ek yaa do atirikt agrim dishaatmak sanket or lagaae jate hai
 The earliest road signs were milestones that indicated distance and direction; For example, the Romans erected rows of stones guiding the distance from Rome throughout their empire
 madhya yug main chauraahon par anek dishaao vaale sanket aam ho gaye the jo shaharon or nagaron ke liye dishaao kii jaankaree dete the
 The first modern street signs that were extensively erected were designed for high or "ordinary" bicycle riders in the late 1870s and early 1880s
 ye mashin tej, shant or niyantrit karne main mushkil prakruti vaale hote the, iske alaava inke savaar kaaphi duuri tak yatra karte the or aksar anjaan sadakon par yatra karnaa pasand karte the
 For such riders, cyclist organizations began to place signs warning of potential hazards ahead, rather than just signs indicating distance and directions to places, which developed a type of sign that was "modern" Defines traffic signals
 motor vaahanon ke vikaas ne or adhik jatil sanketak pranaaliyon ko badhaava diya jisamen sirf akshar aadhaarit soochnaaon se kahin adhik chizon kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 One of the first modern-day road indicator systems was designed in 1895 by the Italian Touring Club
 san 1900 main paris main international lig of touring orgenigeshan ke ek congress main sadak sanketan ke maanakeekaran ke prastaavon par vichaar kiya gaya tha
 In 1903, the British government introduced four "national" signs based on the figure, but the fundamental methods of most road signs were determined at the 1908 International Road Congress held in Rome
 1909 main nau europea sarkaron ne "takkar " "mode ", "chauraahey" or "grad-str kii railmarg crossing" ko nirdeshit karne vaale chaar sachitr sanketon ke istemaal par sahmati vyakt kii
 An intensive study on international road signs between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system
 britain or sanyukt rajya america donon ne apni sadak sanketak pranaaliyon ko viksit kiya, donon ko hi unke sambandhit adhikaar kshetron main kai anya deshon dwaara apanaaya yaa roopantarit kiya gaya
 Britain adopted a version of European road signs in 1964, and in the last decades North American warning indicators began to use some signs and graphics combined with English
 varshon tak yah badlaav kramik rahaa tha
 Pre-industrial signs were of stone or wood, but pig iron was painted in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with the development of the derby's method of smelting iron using coke
 dhalwaan lohe ko beesvin sadi ke madhya tak istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa, lekin dhire-dhire isaki jagah aluminium yaa anya samagriyon or prakriyaaon jaise ki kaanch ke rogan yukt or / yaa dabaakar banaae gaye aghatvardhaneey lohe yaa ispaat kaa istemaal kiya jane laga
 Since 1945 most of the signs have been made using a layer of plastic adhesive on an aluminum sheet, they are generally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility
 paravartak plastic ke vikaas se pehle paravartan kii suvidha likhaawat or sanketon main kaanch ke paravartakon kaa istemaal kar pradaan kii jaati thi
 New generations of traffic signals based on electronic performance can also alter their handwriting to provide "clever control" associated with automatic traffic sensors or remote manual input
 20 se adhik deshon main vaastavik-samay ke trephic massej channel gatividhi kii chetavaniyon ko efem radio, 3ji cellular data or satellite prasaranon ke madhyam se aawaaj rahit sanketon kaa upyog kar sidhe vaahan nigaraanee pranaaliyon ko bhej diya jaataa he
 Finally, using video number-plate scanning, vehicles can pay toll-tax and trucks may pass through a security check system, or in support of on-board signaling, toll-tax collection and travel time monitoring
 But RFID transponders can be used in antenna-connected windshields
 pratyaksh sanketon ke saath saamaanya rup se judi soochnaaon ke sthaanantaran ke liye ek anya "madhyam" aares he, jaise ki likhaawat ko padhane main aksham logon ke liye "bolne vaale sanket"
 The meanings of colors in North America, Australia and New Zealand are generally as follows: america minial on uniform trephic control divices chaar anya rangon ko nirdeshit karata he: Regulatory signals are also sometimes seen with white letters on red or black signals
 cuebek main nile rang ko aksar paryatak aakarshanon ke liye or bhure rang ko saarvajanik sevaaon jaise ki aaraamgahon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he; kai jagahon par pile-par-kaale sanketon kii bajaay safed-par-laal rang kaa prayog hota he
 Fluorescent orange color is now used in many US states and Canadian provinces for construction-related signs
 har rajya or praant ke paas apane swayan ke rajmargon ke liye alag-alag chihn hote hai lekin ye sabhi sangheey rajmargon ke liye maanak chihnon kaa prayog karte hai
 Specific signs have been used in many special highways - such as the Queen Elizabeth Way, the trans-canada Highway, and various auto trails in the US
 america countiyon main numberyukt county margon ke liye kabhi-kabhi pile aksharon ke saath ek panchakoniya nile sanket kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, haalanki yah prayog rajyon ke andar hi asangat hota he
 Distances at traffic signals generally follow the measuring system used by the country concerned
 zyaadaatar america sadak sanketon main miles yaa yards kii "you
es
 customri units" pranali kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, haalanki sangheey parivahan vibhaag ne sabhi sanketon ke liye metric maanakon ko viksit kiya he
 The United Kingdom signs also show distances in miles
 anya sthanon main metric dooriyaan vyapak rup se upyog kii jaati hai, haalanki yah saarvbhaumik nahin he
 Where a language is used in signs, it is generally the recognized language / languages of that region
 america, canada, australia or newjiland ke adhikansh sanket angreji main hote hai
 Quebec residents use the French language , while New Bernswick, jacques-cartier and Champlain Bridges in Montreal use both English and French, as well as a few in other provinces and states, such as Ontario, Manitoba and Vermont
 french-english interpreter signals are used in regions
 mexico or spain spanish bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai
 Signs in Belgium occur in French, Dutch and German depending on the region
 brusselles ke rajdhani kshetra main sadak sanket francisi or dach main hote hai
 Signs in Finland are in Finnish and Swedish
 germany or austria main sanket german bhashaa main hai
 These signs are in French and German in Luxembourg
 switzraland main yahi sanket francisi, german or italvi bhashaaon main hai
 Road signs are often in English and Spanish in places such as San Diego, Yuma and El Paso within a few miles of the us-mexico border
 swadeshi bhashaaon, mukhya rup se nahuatal ke saath-saath kuch maaya sabhyataa kii bhashaaon kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 The main motifs used in US and Canadian signs are from the FHWA alphabet series to series f and the transformed series E)

 vaisheshik darshan ek prakaar se nyaay kaa samaan tantra he
 Special or 'nuclear' is its main subject
 parmaanu sristi kaa mul upadan kaaran he
 God is considered to be the reason for the creation of justice-vaishika-darshan
 vaisheshik darshan main sampurna satta ko saat padaarthon main vibhajit kiya gaya he - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay or abhaav
 This division became more valid later on being more relevant than the 16 substances of justice and formed the basis of the joint tradition of nyaya-vaisesika-philosophy which "nyamuktavali" etc
 are represented by the ancient texts
 shaddarshanon main antim do darshanon ko "mimasaa" kaha jaataa he
 These are known as Purvimansa and Uttaraimamsa
 anya darshanon kii apeksha inkaa vedon se adhik ghanishtha sambandh he
 In a way, these are interpretations of Vedic philosophy
 purvamimasaa, mantrasamhita or brahmanon ke karmkand kii vyakhya he
 Uttarmimamsa is the logical explanation of the spiritual philosophy of the Upanishads
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" kehete hai
 The name of North Mimamsa is also "vedanta"
 in donon mimasaaon ke siddhanton kaa aadhaar vedon main he, kintu vyavasthit darshanon ke rup main inkaa aarambh anya darshanon ke saath saath hi hua
 That is why they are counted in the conspiracies
 donon mimasaaon ke itihaas ke teen charan hai
 They developed in the same northeast in all three phases
 vaidic yug main vedon ke purvabhag main karmkand kaa vidhaan hua
 Spirituality gained prominence in the northern part of the Vedas
 isa kii aarambhik shatabdi main jaimini or baadaraayan ke "mimasaasutra" tathaa "brahmasutra" bhi sambhavat: isi kram main rache gaye
 In the seventh century CE, Kumaril Bhatt and Shankaracharya promoted and propagated the East and the North in the same sequence
 anaatmavaadi hone ke kaaran buddhadarshan kaa aatmavaadi vaidic darshan se virodh he
 Buddhism emerged in the sixth century BCE in the form of revolution against Vedic religion
 anek kaarnon se isa kii chhathi shatabdi main buddha dharm kaa hraas hone laga
 At the same time, Kumaril and Shankaracharya revered both sides of the Vedic religion
 inke baad parthasarathi mishra tathaa madhavcharya ne purvamimasaa darshan kaa vistaar kiya
 Madhvacharya was a minister of King Vukka of Vijayanagar
 baad main sanyas lekar vidyaarany ke naam se shrungery peeth ke shankaracharya pad par asin hue or "panchadshi" naamak praddhi vedant granth kii rachana kii
 Among the four benches that Shankaracharya established on all the four corners of the country for the prestige of Vedantmat, Shringeri Peeth is situated on the Nilgiri Mountains in the south
 anya teen peeth puri, badarikashram or dwarka main hai
 Shankaracharya composed the languages on Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Gita
 shankaracharya ke baad vachaspati mishra, shri harsh aadi aacharyon ne vedant parampara kaa vistaar kiya
 The main goal of Purvimamsa is to arrange Vedic rituals
 iske anusaar vedamantron kaa mukhya arth vidhi athwa karm ke aadesh main he
 Mantras which do not have a judicial verb are "economism" and seek gods etc
 yadi yagyadi karm se ek divya shakti utpann hoti he jise "apurv" kehete hai
 This is the regulator of uncommon karma
 purvamimasaa main ishwar maanya nahin he
 The Vedas are eternal and apaurusheya
 nity shabd kaa kalp kalp main yathapurv sphot hota he or apurv kii shakti se yathapurv sristi kii utpatti hoti he
 The soul of Purvimamsa is as consciousnessless as Vaiseshika
 nyaay darshan ke char pramaanon ke atirikt arthapatti or anuplabdhi do pramaan or mimasaa darshan main maane jate hai
 Answer: Mimamsa depends on the northern part of the Vedas
 upanishad vedon ke antim bhaag hai, at: ve 'vedant' kehalaate hai
 The more famous name of North Mimamsa is "vedanta"
 brahmasutra or upanishdon kii vyakhyaaon ke dwaara vedant kaa vistaar hua he
 Many Acharyas have explained Brahmasutras and Upanishads from different perspectives
 aacharyon ke vibhinn maton ke aadhaar par vedant ke anek sampradaay ban gaye
 They are famous by the name of Advaita, Vividhavaita, Dvaita etc
 vedant ke ye sampradaay sankhya aadi kii bhanti darshanik nahin hai; in sabhi sampradaayon ke dharmik peeth desh ke vibhinn sthanon main pratishthit hai
 The Acharya tradition of these Peeths is intact till date
 gitadarshan bhi vaidic shaddarshanon ke samakaleen he
 The Gita's Karmayoga is an important fundamental philosophy after the Upanishads' Brahmanism
 sabhi vaidic darshanon ne karmyog kaa mahatv sweekaar kiya he
 Being practical, it can be called representative Indian biography
 gita ke karmyog main aadhyatm or jivan kaa adbhud samanvay hua he
 Historically, it is a syncretism of the Vedic rituals and Brahmanism of the Upanishads
 aadhyatm or karm kaa yah samanvay atyant mahatvapurn he
 The influence of Vedanta of the Upanishads and asceticism of Buddhism and Jainism were so increasing in the Indian public that the effect of seclusion and retirement would have become fatal to the society
 aisi sthiti main gita ne karmyog kaa sandesh dekar desh ko ek sanjivan mantra pradaan kiya
 Gita gave a new definition to sannyas by accepting spirituality
 "sanyas" kaa saamaanya arth "tyaag" he
 But there is often confusion in this sacrifice
 bhojan, shayan aadi prakritik karmon kaa tyaag kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also possible to renounce working deeds
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 It is possible to renounce the desire for fruit
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 Desiring to bear fruit, performing lustful deeds for public gathering is the ideal of life
 yahi moksh kaa saadhan he
 This Nishkam Karmayoga of the Gita has been adopted by most Indian philosophies
 gyanayog uskaa aadhyatmik aadhaar he or bhaktiyog uskaa bhavatmak darshan he
 Shankaracharya's Advaitamat is the oldest of these many sects of Vedanta
 yah sambhavat: sabase adhik pratishthit bhi he
 The monotheism of Shankaracharya depends on the Upanishads
 unke anusaar brahm hi ek maatr satya he
 The world deflects and enlivens the spirit of the living being
 agyaan kaa nivaaran hone par jeev ko apane brahmbhav kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 brahm sachchidanand he
 Brahma's power and consciousness and his bliss are endless
 jaagrit, swapn or sushupt kii avasthaaon se pare tathaa bahya or aantarik vishyon se ateet anubhav main brahm kaa prakaash hota he
 Brahma is indescribable due to being transcendental
 sankhyathit hone ke kaaran use "advait" kaha jaataa he
 This monotheism is differentiated in practices of renunciation and love
 samadhi main iskaa aantarik saakshaatkaar hota he
 Brahma has been considered as the cause of the world to prove the advaita bhava
 brahm ko jagat kaa upadan kaaran maanakar donon kaa advait siddh ho jaataa he
 The apprehension of the outcome of the factor has been overcome by discourse
 vivartkaaran avikarya hota he
 Its function is false, like the snake's illusion in the rope
 rajju sarp or swapn praatibhasik satya hai
 The world is the practical truth
 moksh paryant vah maanya he
 Brahma is the ultimate truth which remains in salvation
 maaya se yukt brahm "ishwar" kehalaata he
 He is the creator of the universe, but it is not the ultimate truth
 brahmanubhav kaa saadhan gyaan he
 Acts are not eternal
 "brahm" karm ke dwaara saadhy nahin he
 Karma and devotion are the cooperative causes of salvation
 shravan, manan or nididhyasana mokshasadhana ke teen charan hai
 In salvation, the soul is freed from all shackles and is overwhelmed with eternal bliss
 yah moksh jeevankaal main prapya he tathaa jivan ke vyavhaar se isaki purna sangati he
 About 300 years after Shankaracharya, in the 11th century, Ramanujacharya established the Vishishtadvaita school based on the new interpretation of the Brahmasutras
 ramanujakrit "shribhashya" ke aadhaar par yah 'srisampradaay' kehalaata he
 Ramanuja does not believe in Shankar's Mayanism
 unke anusaar jeev, jagat or brahm teenon parmaarthik satya hai
 Jagat is not the inversion of Brahma but is the actual creation of Brahma
 brahm or ishwar ek duusare ke paryaay hai
 Jiva is part of Brahman
 moksh main jagat kaa vilay nahin hota or jeev kaa swatantra astitv bana rahata he
 Brahma is not unique and non-virtuous, but characteristic and virtuous
 brahm hi swatantra satta he
 Jeeva and Jagat are adjective adjectives
 brahm se pruthak unka astitv sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, Ramanuja's opinion is also Advaita
 jeev or jagat ke visheshnon se yukt brahm kaa inke sath vishisht advaitabhaav he
 Brahma is his inter-lord
 ramanuj ke mat main bhakthi moksh kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Knowledge of the qualities of God is the motivator of devotion
 saadhaaran jan or shudron ke liye prapatti arthath sharnagati sarvottam maarg hai
 a few years after Ramanuja, Nimbarkacharya established Dvaitadvaitaism in the 11th century itself
 brahmasutron par "vedant-parijaat-saurabh" naam se unka bhashya is mat kaa aadhaar he
 Like Ramanuja, Nimbark also considers Jiva and Jagat as truth and dependent of Brahma
 ramanuj ke mat main advait pradhan he
 The request for duality is greater in the Nimbark vote
 ramanuj ke anusaar jeev or brahm main swarupagat samya he, unki shakti main bhed hai
 There is a characteristic distinction between them in the opinion of Nimbark
 nimbark ke advait kaa aadhaar jeev kii brahm par nirbharta he
 The Brahm of Nimbark is a virtuous god
 krishna ke rup main uski bhakthi hi moksh kaa param maarg he
 This devotion comes from the grace of God
 bhakthi se bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 ramanuj or nimbark dono ke mat main videh mukti hi maanya he
 After Nimbarka, in the 13th century Madhvacharya propounded the dualism
 ve purnaprajna tathaa aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He has established dualism by refuting the Advaita of Shankaracharya and the dualism of Nimbarka
 unke anusaar bhed or abhed donon kii ekatra sthati sambhav nahin he
 Shankaracharya's Mayaism is also not acceptable to him
 jagat mithyaa nahin yatharth he
 It is not possible for the third indefinite category of Maya to be different from Sat and Asat
 ishwar, jeev or jagat teenon ek duusare se bhinn hai
 There are five types of distinction
 ishwarjiv, ishwar-jagat, jeev-jagat, jeev-jeev or jad padaarthon main paraspar bhed he
 God is the cause of the world, not the cause of the world
 upadan karan prakruti he
 God is its regulator
 ishwar kii bhakthi ke dwaara moksh praapt hota he
 There is a difference between free organisms
 ve ishwar se bhinn rahakar apni samathrya ke anusaar ishwar kii vibhuti main bhaag lete hai
 In the 15th century Vallabhacharya propagated the Shuddhadvaita faith
 is mat kaa aadhaar "brahmasutron" par likhit vallabhacharya kaa "anubhashya" he
 He considers the Advaita bhava of pure Brahma indulged with Maya
 yah brahm nirgun nahin, sagun he tathaa maaya ke sambandh se rahit he
 Brahma expresses as a universe with its infinite power
 chit or anand kaa tirodhan hone ke kaaran jagat main keval sat rup se brahm kii abhivyakti hoti he
 Jeeva and Brahma are one in nature
 agni ke sfurligon kii bhaanti jeev brahm kaa ansh he, visheshan nahin
 Thus everywhere is advaita, nowhere is dvaita
 maryaada or pushti do prakaar kii bhakthi moksh kaa saadhan hai
 In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu introduced Achintya piercing
 unke shishy rup goswami ne gaudi vaishnav sampradaay kaa pratishthapan kiya
 According to them, the power of God is untouchable
 vah virdohi gunon kaa samanvay kar sakati he
 The practice of salvation is the religion of life, not contemplating impunity
 moksh kaa arth bhagwaan kii priti kaa nirantar anubhav he
 Thus in the later period of the Vedic era, the new rise of Vedanta in the Upanishads took place in the form of Advaita, Vishayadvaita, Dvaita, Shuddhavaita etc
 from 7th century to 16th century
 upanishdon kaa vedant pashchimi or uttari bharat kii dein he
 Advaita etc
 cults emerged from the south
 inke pravartak dakshin deshon ke nivasee the
 Chaitanya's idea originated from Bengal
 kintu in sabhi sampradaayon ne vrudanvan aadi uttari sthanon main apane peeth banaae
 Shankaracharya installed benches at all four corners of the country
 uttar, dakshin, purv, pashchim sabhi pradeshon ke log in sampradaayon main sammilit hue
 Despite being different in principle, these various sects of Vedanta became the sources of internal unity of India
 pashupat dekhen In addition to Vedic and non-vedic philosophies, a third stream in the Indian philosophical tradition has flowed to Shaivism and Shakta sects
 kuch rahasyamay sadhana ke rup main hone ke kaaran yah vaidic or avaidic dhaaraon ke sangam main kuch saraswati ke samaan gupt rahi he
 But Shiva also has a lot of recognition as a direct worship
 pracheen aitihaasik khojon se shiv kii pracheenta pramanit hoti he
 The village has Shiva temples in the village
 prati saptaah or prati paksh main shiv kaa vrath hota he
 The divine marriage of Mahadev Parvati is worshiped as an ideal in Indian families
 rugveda or yajurveda ke rudra ke rup main shiv kaa varnan he
 But Shiva is often considered as the non-vedic god
 daksh ke yajyagwans ke prasang ke dwaara shiv kii avaidikata kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he puranic yug main bhi tridevon kii tulana ke prasang main virodh ke abhas milte hai
 But later Shiva became a very popular deity
 shaiva sampradaay praaia: gupt tantron ke rup main rahe hai
 Very little of his literature is published
 prakashit sahitya bhi pratikatmak hone ke kaaran duruh he
 There are many sects of Shaivite tradition
 inamen shaiva, pashupat, virshaiv, kalamukh, kapalik, kashmir shaiva mat tathaa dakshini mat adhik prasiddh hai
 These can be called conspiracies of Shaivite tradition
 shaiva siddhaat kaa prachaar dakshin main tamil desh main he
 Its basis is in the Agam texts
 14veen shatabdi main nilkanth ne "brahmasutron" par shaivabhashya kii rachana kar vedant parampara ke saath shivamat kaa samanvay kiya
 Pashupat Mat is famous as 'nakulish Pashupat'
 pashupat sutara is sampradaay kaa mul granth he
 The Kalamukh and Kapalic sects have been somewhat fierce and mysterious
 kashmir shaiva mat advait vedant ke samaan he
 Despite being a tantric, his philosophical literature is immense
 isaki spand or pratybhigna do shakhaayen hai
 One has the basis of Vasantagupta's vibrancy and the other is based on his disciple Somananda's "pratibhagyastika"
 jeev or parameshwar kaa advait donon shakhaon main maanya he
 Parameshwara "shiva" is similar to Vedanta's Brahman
 virshaiv mat dakshin deshon se prachlit he
 His followers wear Shivling
 at: inhen "lingayat" bhi kehete hai
 In the 12th century Vasava propagated this view
 virshaiv mat ek prakaar kaa vishishtadvait he
 It can be called Shakti Vishishtvaita because of considering Shakti specific world as the ultimate element
 uttar or dakshin main prachlit shaiva sampradaay bhi uttar vedant sampradaayon kii bhanti bharat kii dharmik ekta ke sutara hai
 Shiva worshiped from Kailas to Rameshwaram is the Mars god of Indian unity
 donon kii yatraaon ke dwaara bhartiya ekta kaa vyaavhaarik anushthan hota he
 The source of Shaktipuja is probably in the Matritantra of ancient India
 bhartiya pariwaron main devi kii mahima bahut he
 The word "devi" is often used in the women's names as an answer
 shakti ke anek rup hai
 Goddess is worshiped in the form of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Parvati, Kali etc
 "shakti" icchaaroop he
 In Sivasutra, willpower is given the form of Uma Kumari
 par tatv ke chinmay rup main ichhashakti kaa samanvay shakti darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn paksh he
 Reference error: Tags exist for the reference group named "N", but no tag was found for the group
 yah bhi sambhav he ki koi samaapti tag gaayab he

 Apart from the legal, medical and social aspects are also related to this issue
 yah pechida or samvedansheel mudda mana jaataa he
 There has been a worldwide demand to allow will-death
 medical science main ichha-mrityu yani kisi kii madad se aatmahatya or sahaj mrityu yaa bina ksht ke marane ke vyapak arth hai
 It is defined according to clinical conditions
 voluntary active yuthenesia After the patient's approval, intentionally give such medicines that the patient dies

 lekin terry ke mata-pita apni beti ko jivit rakhana chaahate the
 Eventually, Terry's husband is approved by the court
 iske baad terry kii aahaar nalee ko hataa liya gaya tha
 Some cases related to euthanasia demand in India •terry shiyaavo ke maamle par bahes kii pratidhwani bharat main sunai dene lagi he
 Here also some cases have come up where the patient's relatives or the patient himself expressed his wish for death
 In 2005, Tarkeshwar Sinha, a resident of Bihar Patna, petitioned the Governor to grant mercy death to his wife Kanchanadevi, who has been unconscious since 2000
 •bahucharchit vyankatesh kaa prakaran adhik purana nahin he
 The 25-year-old Hyderabadi had expressed his wish to donate all his organs before his death
 isaki manzuri adaalat ne nahin di
 • Similarly, in December 2001, BK Pillai, who was suffering from incurable disease, was not granted willful death by the Kerala High Court because there is no such law in India
 •2005 main kashipur urisa ke nivasee mohammad unuus ansaari ne raashtrapati se apil kii thi ki uske chaar bachche asaadhya beemaari se peedit hai

 Similarly, mercy death, which may be motivated by human emotion and is to be done to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the victim, is also considered a crime of culpable homicide under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code
 •jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa kyon nahin? The constitutionality of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code in the case of P
 Rathinam v
 Union of India was objected on the ground that this section is an infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution
 yani jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa bhi adhikaar hona chahie
 But in 1996, the Supreme Court overturned the said decision in Gyanakore v
 State of Punjab and clarified that the right to life does not include the right to life under Article 21

 The Law Commission of India, in its report submitted to the Parliament last year, recommended legalizing the death of mercy
 haalanki ayog ne yah mana he ki is par lambii bahes kii gunzaaish abhi baaqi he or nikat bhavishya main ise manzuri dene kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati
 • 1995 Euthanasia Bill approved in the northern state of Australia

 • In April 2002, Euthanasia was granted a legal status in the Netherlands in a special condition
 •sitambar 2002 main belgium ne ise manyata di
 • Since 1937, suicide with medical aid in Switzerland has been acceptable
 bharat main ichha-mrityu, samadhi or santhara In order to understand the distinction between euthanasia, suicide and Santhara, we must first classify and understand the distinction of death
