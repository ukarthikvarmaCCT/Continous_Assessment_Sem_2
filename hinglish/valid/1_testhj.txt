 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 "then Parashar Muni said," Balike! Do not worry prasuti hone par bhi tum kumari hi rahogi
 "having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force and indulged with Satyavati
 tatpashchaat use aashirwad dete huye kaha, tumhaare sharir se jo machhlee kii gandh nikalati he vah sugandh main parivartit ho jaayegi

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala
 tathaa unhone divya drushti se dekh kar jaan liya ki kaliyug main dharm ksheen ho jaayegaa
 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
 vyas ji ne mahabharat kii rachana kii
 The great Vibhuti of the mythological-epic era, Mahabharata, Eighteen Puranas, Srimadbhagavata, Brahmasutra, Mimamsa, the founder of unique literature-philosophy, Ved Vyas, was born around 3000 BC on Ashada Purnima

 The temple of Maharishi, the author of Puranas and Mahabharata, exists in Vyaspuri, which is located five miles from Kashi
 maharaj kaashi naresh ke ramnagar durg main bhi pashchim bhaag main vyaseshwar kii murti viraajman he jise saadhaaran janata chota vedavyas ke naam se jaanati he
 In fact, this is the most ancient idol of Ved Vyas

 Then Vyasji was situated on the east bank of Gangaji in the fiery angle of the Lolark temple

 Following the anecdotes in the Mahabharata, many Sanskrit poets have created poetry, drama etc
 mahabharat ke sambandh main swayan vyasaji kii hi ukti adhik sateek he- is granth main jo kuch he, vah anyatra he, panratu jo isamen nahin he, vah anyatra kahin bhi nahin he
 He was born in an island of Yamuna in Kalpi
 vyasaji krishna dwaipayan kahalaaye kyonki unka rang shyaam tha
 As soon as he was born, he went to do penance with the mother's command and said that whenever you will remember, i will come

 Mahabharatmakhyan kritwadi mudtamam
 
 Adiparva - jab inhone dharm kaa hraas hote dekha to inhone veda kaa vyas arthath vibhaag kar diya or vedavyas kahalaaye
 After studying the Vedas, he taught his disciples Sumantu, Jaimini, Pal and Vaishampayan, and his son Shukadeva, and preached the Mahabharata
 aapaki is alokik pratibha ke kaaran aapako bhagwaan kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 Vyasa has become the best poet in Sanskrit literature after Valmiki
 inke likhe kavy 'aarsh kavy' ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The purpose of Vyas ji is not to describe the war by writing Mahabharata, but to show the essence of this physical life
 unka kathan he ki bhale hi koi purush vedang tathaa upanishdon ko jaan le, lekin vah kabhi vichkshan nahin ho saktaa kyonki yah mahabharat ek hi saath arthshaastra, dharamshastra tathaa kaamshaastra he

 He is often respected as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist; However some question the possibilities of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy
 herodots unhen "unaniyon ke bich sabase adhik sakasham darshanik" maanate hai
 His name connects him to Pythia and Apollo; Aristippus clarified his name by saying that "they spoke no less true than the Pythians," and Lumblikas tells a story that Pythia predicted that her pregnant mother would give birth to a very beautiful, intelligent child who would go to mankind
 Will be very beneficial for unhen mukhyatah paithogoras kii prameya ke liye janaa jaataa he, jiskaa naam unke naam par diya gaya he
 Pythagoras, known as the "father of numbers", made significant contributions to religious teaching and philosophy in the sixth century BCE
 purv sukaraati kaal ke anya logon kii tulana main unke kaary ne katha kahaniyon ko adhik prabhavit kiya, unke jivan or shikshaaon ke bare main adhik vishwaas ke saath kaha ja saktaa he
 We know that Pythagoras and his disciples believed that everything is related to mathematics and that numbers are ultimately the reality and that everything can be predicted through mathematics and everything is aligned in a rhythmic pattern or cycle
 Can be measured in the form
 lamblicas ke anusaar, pithogoras ne kaha ki "sankhya hi vichaaron or roopon kaa shaasha he or devataaon or rakshason kaa kaaran he
 " wo pehle aadmi the jo apane aap ko ek darshanik, yaa buddhi kaa premi kehete the, or pithogoras ke vichaaron ne plato par ek bahut gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 Unfortunately, very few facts are known about Pythagoras, as very few of his writings remain
 pithogoras kii kai uplabdhiyaan vastav main unke sahyogiyon or uttaradhikariyon kii uplabdhiyaan hai
 Pythagoras was born in Samos, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean, on the shores of Asia Minor
 unki maan paaythis or pita manesarchas ke ek phonician vyapaaree) the
 When he was young, he left his place of birth and escaped from the tyrannical government of the Policrates and moved to Croton Celebria in southern Italy
 lamblicus ke anusaar thels unki kshamtaaon se bahut adhik prabhavit tha, usne pithogoras ko egypt main memphis ko chalane or vahaan ke pujaariyon ke saath adhyayan karne kii salaah di jo apni buddhi ke liye jane jate the
 He also served as a disciple in Tires and Bablos in Phenicia
 egypt main unhone kuch jyamitiya siddhanton ko sikhaa jisase prerit hokar unhone antat prameya di jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he
 This possible inspiration is presented as an extraordinary problem in the Berlin papyrus
 samos se crotone, celebria, italy, aane par unhone ek gupt dharmik samaaj kii sthapana kii jo praarambhik orfic kalt se bahut adhik milti julati thi or sambhawatah usase prabhavit bhi thi
 Pythagoras tried to improve the cultural life of Croton, inspired citizens to follow virtue and established a group of followers around him who were called Pythegoreans
 is saanskrithik kendra ke sanchaalan ke niyam bahut hi sakht the
 He opened his school as a liye for both boys and girls
 Those who took part in the social interiors of Pythagoras called themselves Methmetkoi
 ve skool main hi rahete the, unki apni koi nijee sampatti nahin thi, unhen mukhya rup se shaakaahaari bhojan khaanaa hota tha, anya vidhyaarthee jo aas paas ke kshetron main rahete the unhen bhi pithogoras ke skool main bhaag lene kii anumati thi
 He was known as Akausmetikoi and was allowed to eat meat and keep his personal property
 richard blekmor ne apni pustak di le monastery main pithogorieno ke dharmik prekshanon ko bataaya, "yah itihaas main darj sanyasi jivan kaa pehla udhaaharan tha
 According to Lumblikas, Pythagoras followed a life consisting of religious teaching, simple eating, exercise, reading, and philosophical study
 sangeet is jivan kaa ek aavashyak aayojan kaarak tha: shishy apollo ke liye niyamit rup se mil jul kar bhajan gaate the; ve aatma yaa sharir kii beemaari kaa ilaaj karne ke liye veena kaa upyog karte the; yaaddasht ko badhaane ke liye sone se pehle or baad main kavita pathan kiya jaataa tha
 Flavius jozefus, against Appian, in defense of Judaism, said against Greek philosophy that Pythagoras was familiar with Jewish beliefs, according to Hermippus of Samarna, he included some of them in his philosophy
 jindagi ke antim charan main uske or uske anuyaayiyon ke khilaaf kroton ke ek kuleen sailon dwaara rachit shajish kii vajah se vah metapontum bhaag gaya
 He died at age 90 in Metapontum due to unknown causes
 bartrend rasel, ne pashchimi darshan ke itihaas, main bataaya ki pithogoras kaa plato or anya logon par itnaa adhik prabhaav tha ki vah sabhi pashchimi darshanikon main sabase zyada prabhavi mana jaataa tha
 This organization was in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood and in some ways a monastery
 yah pithogoras ke dharmik upadeshon par aadhaarit tha or bahut hi gupt tha
 First, the school was very much concerned with the morality of society
 sadasyon ko naitikta ke drushtikon ke saath jeena hota tha, ek duusare se pyaar karnaa hota tha, raajnneetik manyataon ko baantna hota tha, shanti kaa anusaran karnaa hota tha or swayan ko prakruti ke ganit ko samarpit kar dena hota tha
 The followers of Pythagoras were commonly called "pathogorians"
 unhen saamanytah darshanik ganitagya kaha jaataa he, jinka aksheeya jyamiti kii shuruyaat par ek prabhaav tha, jo iske vikaas ke 200 saalon ke baad euclid ke dwaara di eliments main likhaa gaya
 Pythagoras observed a law of peace known as Ekmeithia, breaking this rule to be punished with death
 aisa isliye tha kyonki pithogoras kaa maananaa tha ki ek vyakti ke shabd aam taur par laaparvaahee se yukt hote hai, jisase uski galat abhivyakti hoti he or unke anusaar yadi kisi ko is baat par andeh he ki use kya kahana chahie to use hameshaa chup rahanaa chahie
 Another rule of his was that "anyone who should help in a trouble should not let it fall down, because it is a great sin to encourage inaction
" " or ve kehete the ki "apane ghar se nikal jane ke baad vaapis mat jaao, kyoki furis aapke saath honge," yah unhen yaad dilaataa tha ki sab kuch siikhe bina bahut kam seekhney se acha he sristi, bhagwaan or ganit ke bare main, sachai ko siikhnaa 
 In the biographical porphyry of Pythagoras, it is stated that "this peace was not an ordinary peace
 "pithogoriens ek aantarik sarkal methmeticoi or ek bahari sarkal akusameticoi main vibhajit the
 The Porphyry wrote that Methmetkoikois learned the knowledge more extensively, and Akusmatikoi listened to only the summary headings of Pythagoras's writings without any precise exposition
 lamblikaas ke anusaar akusameticoi aamayaham shishy the jo pithogoras ke vyakhyanon ko ek parde ke baahar se sunate the
 The Akausmatikoi were not allowed to see Pythagoras and were not taught the inner secrets of the cult
 iske bajaay unhen gupt tareeke se vyavhaar or naitikta sikhaai jaati thi, gupt arthon se yukt sankshipt baaten bataai jaati thi
 Akusmatikoine Methmetikoiko believed to be genuine Pythagoreans but not the opposite
 cyclone ke kohort, ek krodhi shishy ke dwaara kai methmeticoi kii hatya ke baad, donon samooh ek dusre se puri tarah se alag ho gaye, pithogoras kii patni theno or unki do betiyaan methmeticoika netritv kar raheen thim
 Theano was the daughter of an orphic follower, a mathematician in her own right
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki unhone bhi ganit, bhautik vigyaan, chikitsa or bal manovigyaan par kai pustaken likhin, haalaanki unke lekhan main se kuch nahin bachaa he
 His most important work is a book on the philosophical theory of the Golden Mean, at a time when women were considered to be the property of their husbands and only had to take care of their husbands' home, Pythagoras gave women equal status to work
 pithogoras ke samaaj main kai roak thim
 Like do not step on a crossbar and do not eat beans
 ye niyam puraane andhvishwaas the, jaise "ek seedhi ke neeche chalanaa durbhaagya purna hota he
 "even in ancient times, a derogatory title called Mysticos Logos was given to discredit Pythagoras
 faliyon par roak fevism se sambandhit ho sakati he jo bumadhya kshetra ke aas paas vyapak rup se failaa he
 The main point here is akousmata, meaning "rules", so that superstitious prohibitions were primarily applicable to the akousmeticoe and most of the rules came after the death of Pythagoras and were completely free from methmeticoe
 jo taarkik rup se pithogoras kii parampara ke vaastavik sangrakshak hai
 Methmetocycone emphasized more on the inside understanding than the acosmeticoin
 yahan tak ki kuch niyamon or puja paddatiyon ke vistaar par bhi bal diya
 For Methmetikoi to be Pythagorean means an innate quality and presence of inner understanding
 akusamata or -ke saath nipatane kaa ek or tarika bhi tha; unke pratik kathatmak chithran dwaara
 We have some examples of this, one is his explanation of Aristotle: "do not step on a balance", that is, do not be greedy; 'do not strike with a sword on fire ", that is, do not talk in sharp words to an angry person
 , "do not eat the heart" means do not hold yourself in sorrow etc
 hamaare paas paanchavin sadi isa purv tak ke pithogorian sajiv chithran ke saboot hai, iskaa matlab he ki aisi ajeeb baaten paheli ke rup main kahi gayi
 The Pythagoreans are also known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, as well as their theory that number is the true nature of things
 unhone shuddhikaran sanskaron ko apanaaya or jeene ke bhinn niyamon ko viksit kiya, ve aisa maanate the ki ye niyam devataaon ke bich unhen ek ucch pad ko praapt karne ke liye sakasham banaayenge
 Much of their mysticism appears to be keeping the soul integral to the orphic tradition
 orfiks ne kai parishodhak sanskaron ko apanaaya or saath hi anderworld main vibhinn vikaas sanskaron ko apanaaya
 Pythagoras is also closely related to Pherecidus of Ciroce, an ancient commentator who is believed to be the first Greek to teach the transmigration of souls
 pracheen tippaneekar maanate hai ki feresids pithogoras kaa sabase antarang shikshak tha
 Pheresidus taught about the soul in the words of Penta Maycos and-; The most likely origins of the Pythagorean use of the pentagram were their use as a symbol of identity among members and as a symbol of internal health
 pai thogoras sangeet main bahut adhik ruchi lete the, atah unke anuyaayi bhi sangeet main ruchi rakhte the
 Pythagoras was a musician and mathematician
 pithogoras apane samay ke sangeet main sudhaar laana chaahate the, unka maananaa tha ki is sangeet main paryaapt saamanjasy nahin he, yah bahut hi vyast rakhane vaala tha
 According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that the musical note could be translated into mathematical equations, when he one day passed by a working blacksmith and thought that his anvil resulted from an injury The sound being made was beautiful and harmonious and he determined that whatever scientific rule is the reason for it must be mathematical and can be applied to music
 vah lohaar ke paas gaya or uske aujaaron ko dekh kar yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki yah kaise hua
 He found that the snows were in simple proportion to each other
 ek pehali ke aadhe aakaar kii thi or duusari aakaar kii 2 / 3 thi or isi prakaar se tha
 
) pithogoras ne sankhya ke siddhant ko vistaarpurvak spasht kiya, jiskaa sahi arth aaj bhi vidwaanon ke bich bahes kaa vishay bana hua he
 Pythagoras believed in the "spontaneity of the balls", believing that planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, with some similarities found in musical tones and producing a melodious melody
 saanchaa:academia From the fourth century A
D
, Pythagoras is credited with discovering Pythagoras's theorem, a theorem in geometry that establishes that the square of the diagonal s in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides b and A
 arthath a2 + b2 = c2
 Although the theorem, now known by his name, was first used by the Babylonians and Indians
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki unhone yaa unke vidhyaarthiyon ne iske pehle pramaan die
 It must be stressed, however, that the manner in which the Babylonians handled the numbers of Pythagoras suggests that they knew that this theory generally proved to be true and that they also knew of some of the evidences which were hitherto unverified Not discovered in sources
 unke skool kii gupt prakruti kii vajah se or iske vidhyaarthiyon ke dwaara sab kuch apane shikshakon ko arpit kar dene kii vajah se, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki pithogoras ne is prameya ko sabit karne ke liye is par khud kaam kiya
 For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or post-mathematical problems
 kuch log maanate hai ki yah pithogoras kii mrityu ke do sadiyon ke baad plato ke anuyaayiyon ke dwaara saavdhaneepurvak nirmit ek myth he
 Primarily to justify the case of Plato's paraphysics, which worked well with the ideas he devoted to Pythagoras

 They believed in the relocation or the rebirth of the soul, believing that the soul would incarnate repeatedly in humans, animals, or vegetables until it became virtuous
 unka punarjanm kaa vichaar pracheen unani dharm se prabhavit tha
 He was the first to propose that thought process and soul are located in the brain and not in the heart
 unhen khud vistaar se chaar jivan yaad the jaisaa ki ve daawa karte the ki unhone jie hai or ve apane mrit mitra ke rone kii aawaaj ko ek kute ke bhunkane ke rup main sunate the
 One belief of Pythagoras was that the essence of life is number

 He stated that this central point is the Earth, but later stated that this central point is "agni" which he never identified as the Sun
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chaand ek anya grah he jise unhone "counter arth "kaha- baad main unhone simit-aseemit main vishwaas jataayaa
 Pythagoras or in a broader sense the Pythagoreans made a significant impact on Plato's work

 B) There is evidence that Plato may have taken the idea from Pythagoras that mathematics and common language, abstract thinking is a safe basis for philosophical thinking, as well as an adequate thesis in science and ethics
 sa) plato or pithogoras ne "aatma or bhautik duniya main iske sthaan ke liye rahasywaadee drushtikon" main saamaan vichaar prastut kiya
 It seems that both were influenced by orphism

 In the legends of ancient Rome and Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome studied under Pythagoras, it is said
 isaki sambhaavna nahin he kyonki do jeevon ke liye saamaan rup se sweekrut tareekhen adhyaropit nahin karti hai
 Pythagoras established a secret society called the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which was devoted to the study of mathematics

 On many systems, a Telnet client application can be used to establish interactive incompatible-tcp sessions
 aamtaur par yah mana jaataa he ki ek tailnet satr jo IAC kaa prayog nahin karata kaaryaatmak rup se samaan he
 However, this is not the case, as there are other network virtual terminal rules, such as a bare carry return character, followed by a NULL character, which separates the Telnet protocol from an incompatible-tcp session

 Experts in computer security, such as the SANS Institute, suggest that the use of Telnet for remote login should be discontinued under all normal circumstances for the following reasons: ye suraksha sambandhi kamiyon ne tailnet protocol kaa upyog teji se girte hue dekha he, vishesh rup se saarvajanik internet par, surakshit shail protocol ke paksh main, jo pehle 1995 main jari kiya gaya
 SSH provides most of Telnet's functionality, in addition to strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from getting in the way, and public key authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is exactly what it claims to be

 In 1957, Charles Hard Towns and Arthur Leonardo Schavalo at the Bell Laboratory began a serious study on infrared laser
 As the idea developed, the focus shifted from infrared frequencies to more visible light instead
 This concept was originally a " Was referred to as "optical moser
" One year later, Bell Laboratory proposed a monopoly application for the proposed optical moser
 Did i Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript physical review of theoretical calculations, which was published the same year his paper
 
 In those days Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral research paper on the energy levels of excited thallium
 Gould and Towns met on the general topic of radiation emissions
 In November 1957, Gould called the "laser" Wrote your thoughts related to the suggestion of using an open resonator which is an important component for future lasers

 He continued to work on his idea and filed a patent application in April 1959
 The US Patent Office rejected his application and This patent was given to the Bell Laboratory in 1960
 It sparked a legal battle that lasted for 28 years and earned scientific reputation and more money
 But i Goold won his first short patent in 1977, but could not claim his first patent victory until 1987, when a federal judge issued him a patent for optically pumped lasers and gas-fired lasers
