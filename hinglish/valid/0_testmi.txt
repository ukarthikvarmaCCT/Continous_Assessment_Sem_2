 is kaaran koi aisa udhaaharan bhi nahin tha, jiskaa bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan anusaran kar sake
 For this reason the Wildlife Institute of India not only had to incorporate wildlife science in forest education at its discretion, but also had to create resources to run this course smoothly

 Mountaineering began with an ambition to conquer ever-unending mountain peaks and over time it has grown into 3 specialized branches: the art of climbing rocks, the art of climbing snow-capped mountains and the art of skiing
 All three require experience, physical ability and technical knowledge to remain safe

 Among its varieties are lightweight aluminum models that are used to run on snow-covered glaciers and have high level steel models that are useful for uphill climbing and hanging rock / ice crossing
 gahari barf main chalane ke liye vishesh him-juuton kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Ski can be used at every place where snowflakes are used and in addition they can be used directly and at high places
 haalanki mushkil margon par ski karne ke liye uchit abhyaas kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Climbing and descending using the arts of mountaineering and skiing on the straight and elevated routes is a type of sport known as ski mountaineering
 barf kii dhalaan par surakshit tareeke se chadhane-utarane hetu arohi ke liye barf kii kulhadi tathaa pichhali sadi main viksit vibhinn padchaalan takneekon kaa prayog aavashyak hota he
 During the steepest ascent from the lowest slope, the foot is first raised in the direction of elevation, then the stump and then the krempone is carried forward
 barf kii kulhadi kii vidha main pehle usko ek haathchadi kii tarah, phir ek khunti kii tarah istemaal kiya jaataa he, uske baad uske saamne ke hisse ko kandhe ke neeche tathaa upar se ek chaaku ke rup istemaal kiya jaataa he or ant main usko sir ke upar se ghumaakar dhalaan kii disha main phenkaa jaataa he
 These different techniques depend on how the ice ax is designed, and the climber is using an ax that is two
 Objects used as anchors for ropes in snow are sometimes unreliable; They include ice pegs, deadman tools made of aluminum; Or they are also made from buried objects such as snow ax, skis, rocks and other objects
 sakht barf se bhi lungar kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he, jinhen bollard kehete hai
 Snow trenches are most dangerous when walking on glaciers
 barf main yah vishaal daraaren aksar nazar nahin aatin kyonki in par barf kii ek patali parat jamane se ek snobrij sa ban jaataa he
 Many times this snowbridge is only a few inches thick

 The ice ax and the krempon are essential for glacial travel
 do se paanch parvatarohiyon ke dal ek rassi main samaan duuri par baandhe jate hai
 If one climber starts falling, all the others settle in their place and their power stops it from falling
 team ke anya sadsy girane vaale saathi ko daraar se nikaal lete hai
 Several methods are used for safe travel on frozen ice
 yadi chadhaai kathin he
 But if not as straight, the ascending ice protects itself by tying rope in them
 har arohi unheen keel ke langaron kaa prayog karte hue chadhataa he or antim arohi lungar nikaal letaa he
 Sometimes bollards or icicles are also used
 yah us dasha main atyant upyogi rahete hai jab sari team ek saath hi girane lage
 is takanic ko simul-chadhaai ke rup main janaa jaataa he or kabhi kabhi ise khadi barf or aasaan chattan par bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 If climbing is extremely difficult and steep, then standard technique is suitable

 The convoy moves only after everyone has gathered in one place
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par parvatarohi bhinn-bhinn aashrayon kaa prayog karte hai
 Weather in the mountains can be very unpredictable so shelter is a very important aspect of safety for climbers
 oonche pahaado par kai dinon tak deraa daalane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The "base camp" is used to attempt to visit the summit
 aadhaar shivi upar kii kathin paristhitiyon se surakshit sthanon par banaaye jate hai
 Base camps are located on many popular or dangerous mountains
 jahaan shikhar tak ek hi din main nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa he, ek se adhik aadhaar shivi banaaye jate hai
 For example, in addition to the base camp, there are 4 other camps in the ridge along the southeast ridge of Everest
 vishesh rup se europea alpine kshetron main pahari jhopadiyon kaa ek network he
 In France they are known as Refuges, Refugi in Italy, Cabanas in Switzerland, Hätten in Germany and Austria, Coca in Slovenia, Refugios in Spain, and Haight in Norway
 aise jhopadiyaan ucch pahaado sahit kai alag-alag unchaaiyon par maujuud hoti hai, haalaanki adhik doordaraj kshetron main adhik moulik aashray maujuud hote hai
 Mountain huts are of different sizes and varieties, but each usually has a social dining room and has sleeping facilities equipped with mattresses, blankets or duvets and pillows
 mehmaanon se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve apane bistar swayan le kar aayen
 suvidhaayen aamtaur par moulik hoti hai, parantu aise kathin vaataavaran main ve atyant mahatvapurn aashray pradaan karti hai
 Apart from this, they also work to make the routes more widely accessible as the ascenders are able to stop here and rest in the journey and they are also relieved by lifting heavy equipment
 atah parvatarohan main inkaa amuly sthaan mana jaataa he
 In all the huts in Europe, employees are present during the summer season and some in the spring
 In other places, these huts are also found open in the fall
 kuch jhopadiyon main ek hissaa hameshaa khulaa rahata he
 They are unmanned and are called Winter Hut
 jab yah khuli hoti hai tab yah jhopadiyaan vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon dwaara chalaayi jaati hai, haalaanki inamen se kuch ko svaichhik karmchaaree bhi chalaate hai jo alpine klbon ke sadsy hote hai jaise ki swiss alpine club tathaa club alpine francas
 jhopadi ke prabandhak, jinhen europe main abhibhavak yaa varden kehete hai, aamtaur par jalpan or bhojan bechney kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 This facility is available to both those staying overnight and those staying only during the day
 yah dekhte hue ki aksar pani sahit adhikansh vasteen helicopter dwaara laayi jaati hai, bhojan kaaphi vistrut hota he
 This includes glucose-rich foods, cakes and pastries made there, hot and cold drinks including beer and wine, and high-carbohydrate foods for dinner
 sabhi jhopadiyaan haalaanki yah suvidhaayen nahin pradaan karatin, tathaa kuch main aagantukon ko swayan apana intazaam karnaa hota he
 On the other hand some huts provide both types of facilities
 aagatuk vyay kam rakhane ke liye apni khaadya saamagree va pakaane ke upkarnon kaa prayog kar sakate hai athwa adhik vyay karne waalon ke liye pakaa hua bhojan bhi uplabdh rahata he
 Overnight reservation is considered mandatory, and in some popular places it is also necessary as 100 bed facilities are also filled on good weather or on weekends! The cancellation of a reservation made once is considered polite, because the employees of these huts keep a record of every ascending route and climbing plan with great diligence to ensure the security of the ascension
 All huts can be contacted by telephone and credit cards are accepted for payment in all
 parvatarohan ke sandarbh main, padaav yaa bivi ek aaraam yaa sone kii asthaayee vyavastha he, jisamen parvatarohi ko camping kii paaramparik jagah main uplabdh thaharne, khaane or upkarnon kii purna suvidhaon se kam suvidha praapt hoti he
 This may include taking only a sleeping bag and stop bag and sleeping
 kai baar chote aanshik aashray kshetron jaise himandon kii daraaron, chattaanon ke kataavon or barf main bani khaaion kaa prayog hawaaon se bachaav ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques were actually used in emergencies; Although when time and appropriate snow conditions are not available to build icy caves, some climbers are constantly dedicated to Alpine style as a special plan for a halt so that the weight of the tent is saved
 The main risk related to these stops is the presence of a large amount of cold
 tamboo parvaton main sarvaadhik upyog hone vaale aashray hai
 These can range from simple tarpaulin pieces to extremely heavy designs that help to avoid the harsh conditions of the mountain
 niraavaran kii sthiti main, tamboo lagane ke liye barf yaa chattan ke peeche lagane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 One danger of tenting is that strong winds and heavy snowfall can be dangerous and due to this the tent can break and break
 iske alaava, tamboo ke kapade kii nirantar fadafadaahat se neend main baadha utpann ho sakati he tathaa aashray kii suraksha ke prati ashanka bad sakati he
 When choosing a tent, ascensors rely on special mountaineering tents that are specially built to withstand strong winds and heavy snowfall
 tamboo ke khunton ko atirikt suraksha ke liye barf main dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 
 jahaan paristithiyaan anukool ho to barf kii gufaaen bhi parvat par aashray kaa ek anya tarika he
 Many climbers do not use tents at very high altitudes as long as the ice conditions permit them to stay in ice caves, as ice caves are much warmer and quieter than tents
 inhen ek barf ke fawde kaa prayog karke paryaapt samay dekar apekshaakrit aasaani se banaaya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a properly constructed ice cave will hover around zero, relative to which the outside temperature may be warmer
 inhen aisi kisi bhi jagah khoda ja saktaa he jahaan kam se kam chaar feet barf ho
 quinzi ek anya prakaar kaa aashray he, jise barf ke dher ko majboot karke banaaya jaataa he
 Igloo is used by some climbers, but it is difficult to make and requires some special icy conditions
 parvatarohan main kai baar khatre ko do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa hai: vastugat khatre jo parvatarohi ke upasthit na hone par bhi upasthit hote hai, jaise chattaanon kaa girnaa, himaskhalan or karaab mausam or vyaktiparak khatre jo parvatarohi dwaara shuru karkon se hi sambandhit hote hai
 Equipment malfunction and breakdown due to inadvertence, fatigue and inadequate technique are examples of subjective danger
 tufaanon or himaskhalan ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hone vaale raste ko vastugat khatre kaa ucch str mana jaataa he, jabaki takneekee rup se zyada kathin rasta jo in khataron se apekshaakrit surakshit hota he use vastugat rup se surakshit mana ja saktaa he
 In short, climbers should keep in mind these dangers: falling rocks, falling snow, avalanches, falling climbers, falling off icy slopes, falling icy slopes, falling into icy crevices and elevation and weather hazards
 The skill of a climber is tested in choosing and following a path using their skills and experience to reduce these hazards
 prayek chattan kataav ke kaaran dhire-dhire bikharati he, yah prakriya vishesh rup se barf-rekha ke upar tej hoti he
 The shape of the rocks changes continuously due to falling of stones, due to which deception can occur
 girti chattaane parvat par gadde bana detii hai or in gaddhon par kaaphi saavdhaanee se chadhana hota he, inke kinare praayah surakshit hote hai jabaki madhya bhaag par pathar girte rahete hai
 The rocks fall more than anything else according to the current season
 raat main bani barf chattaanon ko upar se asthaayee taur par baandh sakati he lekin din kii badhati garmi yaa barf ke pighalane par bahata pani yaa varsha in chattaanon ko hataa sakati he
 Local experiences prove valuable for detecting rocks falling on such paths
 chattan kii parat ke jhukaav kii disha se kai baar vishisht sthiti par khatre kii gambhirtha kaa pataa chal jaataa he; chattan kii prakruti par bhi vichaar zarur karnaa chahie
 jahaan pathar aksar girte hon vahaan neeche uske tukade paae jaayenge, tathaa barf par pathar girane se bade gadde ban jate hai jo dur se hi nazar aa jate he
 Climbers should pay special attention to such marks in planning to climb a new peak or an unfamiliar route
 When the falling stones meet a large number of mud ice or water, ejaculation of mud is formed
 Camping should be avoided in such potential slopes
 barf girane kii prabal sambhaavna vaale sthanon kaa sateek purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It falls into the broken parts of the glaciers and from the hanging ridges built on the summit of the Sakari mountain range
 bade himalambon kaa nirmaan kadi chattaanon par hota he or ye thande or tufaani dinon ko jhelti hui achche mausam main zyada girti hai
 Like falling stones, it is also important to avoid them
 himand atyant dhire banate hai or asthir santulan kii sthiti par bhi dhire pahonchte hai 
 ve aam taur par din ke sabase ooshna bhaag main yaa uske turant baad girte hai
 a skilled and experienced ascension will usually consider the safest route between the most complex paths of falling snow, but still avoid such places in the afternoon of hot days
 The hanging glaciers often move away from the steep cliffs after a certain period of time
 inhen hameshaa neeche pade inke malbe se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 It should always be avoided along the way
 ek shila parvatarohi kii dakshata uske pad va hast rakhane ke vikalp, tathaa chayan karne ke baad unako jamaaye rakhane ke kaushal se zaahir hoti he
 This depends to a large extent on the ability to estimate the capacity of the rock on which it stands
 kai kamjor chattaane ek vyakti kaa vajan sahane ke liye paryaapt majboot hoti hai, lekin yah jaanane ke liye anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki kis par vishwaas karen or bina marode vajan ko sthanantarit karne ke liye kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Special attention is required when roping on some weak rocks, because they are prone to fall under the stone
 isi tarah inpar pair va haath rakhte hue bhi uchit dhyaan dena chahie
 kaaphi jatil chattaanon se pratibandhak ko paar karte samay, ek khatarnaak sthiti bad sakati he jabatak ki pratibandhak kii donon sthitiyaan atal na hon
 kathor chattaanon par aapasi sahaayta kaa bada mahatva hota he
 Two or three ascensors move with the help of each other, or by placing feet on the ice ax applied by the other to the feet
 The most important principle of mutual cooperation is that all the members of the party climb on each other's support and not as an independent entity; Each of the members moving forward should know what the front and back ascension is doing
 kharaab mausam ke baad khadi chattaanon par barf kii ek parat praayah pai jaati he, jo ise or bhi durgam bana detii he
 In such a situation, Krempon is very beneficial
 himaskhalan pahaado main sabase kam aankaa jane vaala khatra he
 People generally think that they will be able to identify and avoid these threats
 The truth is actually quite different
 har saal 120 se 150 log keval alps main hi chote himskhalanon main maare jate hai
 They mostly consist of experienced male skiers in the age group of 20 to 35, but also include ski directors and guides
 barf kii pathaar ko paar karne main hameshaa khatre kaa dabaav rahata he
 It takes a lot of time and effort to go back, excellent leadership, and most importantly an avalanche that proves that the right decision was taken
 mudane kaa nirnay lenaa tab or kathin ho jaataa he jab anya log bhi dhalaan ko paar kar rahe hon, lekin koi bhi aglaa vyakti kaaran ban saktaa he
 There are many types of avalanches, but two types are of most concern: khatarnaak phislan vaale khand sabase zyada usee jagah hote hai jis jagah ko skirs dwaara sabase zyada pasand kiya jaataa he: lambe or chaude khule hue, kuch ped yaa badi chattaane, 30 se 45 degree kaa kone, taaja barf kii bhari maatr, bade toofaan ke baad, tufaani dhalaan par
 saura vikiran se bhi skhalan kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 These will mostly be point release or wet mud type avalanches
 The weight attached in the wet slide ejaculation turns on the ejaculation
 himaskhalan kaa shikaar hue nabbe pratishat shikaar unke dwaara swayan yaa unke samooh ke anya arohiyon dwaara hi armbh kiye jate hai 
 Time parties are always advised to carry these items while traveling off-piste on Alpine routes
 arohiyon ko himaskhalan prashikshan kii salaah bhi di jaati he
 Ironically, the highest percentage of deaths in avalanches are from expert skiers who have undergone avalanche training; Probably because they prefer to ski in avalanche areas and perhaps because some people do not practice enough with their equipment to become fast and fit free
 uchit bachaav upkaran or prashikshan ke saath bhi, kisi bade himaskhalan main funsane par paanch main se ek kii marane sambhaavna hoti he or kuch minute ke liye dafan ho jane par jinda bachane kii sambhaavna aadhi hoti he
 The best solution is to learn how to avoid risky situations
 barf yaa kade himpat vaali dhalaanon par yatra karte samay, crempons parvatarohi ke upkarnon kaa ek maanak bhaag hote hai
 While step-cutting can be used many times on the snowy slopes of the medium angle, it is still a slow and tedious process, which does not provide high protection for the creampons
 haalanki, naram barf yaa powder main, crempons aasaani se funs jate hai, jis kaaran se inkaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 In the other case, the ice ax not only helps, but also helps in handling themselves in the event of an ascension falling or sliding
 phir bhi ek asli barfili dhalaan par, barf kii kulhadi bahut kam hi khud ko pakadaney main prabhavi hoti he
 As an added precaution for safety to stand on the slope of the ice, the ice screws should be tied to the mountaineering rope
 europe main asli barfili dhalaan durlabh he, yadhyapi ushnkaribandheey kshetron main kaaphi saamaanya he, jahaan giri hui naveen barf sataha par jald hi pigal jaati he or niche bah jaati he, isliye agali raat kii thand main puraa drav ardg-sakht barf kii sheet main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Snow slopes are common and climbing is also common
 himpad yaa barf kii dhalaan ke neeche saamanytah ek badi him daraar hoti he, jise bergascrand kehete hai, jahaan parvat kii antim dhalaan barf-kshetra yaa himand se nikalati he
 Such berkskronds are too wide to cross and must be crossed by an ice bridge, which requires careful testing and use of an entrapped rope
 ek khasta haal khadi barf kii dhalaan khatarnaak ho sakati he kyonki isaki barf kaa puraa bhaag ek skhalan ke rup main armbh ho saktaa he
 It is much safer if it is climbed upright in place of sloping on such slopes, because it starts cutting them diagonally or horizontally and their fluid starts flowing
 jami barf par giri nayi barf vishesh rup se khatarnaak hoti he
 In case of a suspicious snow condition, progress needs to be checked
 chattaanon par himpat aksar karaab hota he jabatak ki vah sakht na ho jaae; barf par barf ek sa lagata he
 a two-day clear weather will bring snow in good condition
 Snow cannot lie in a very steep angle, although the eyes may be deceived by its slope
 barf kii dhalaan kadaachit 40 degree tak jhuki ho sakati he
 Hard frozen ice persists to greater angles
 subah barf kii dhalaane kadi or surakshit hoti hai, parantu isi prakaar se dopaher main kuch narm or khatarnaak hoti jaati hai; isliye jaldi chalane main phayda he
 Snow cracks are cracks or deep ditches that form when a glacial material passes through an uneven plane
 ye khuli yaa chhipi hui ho sakati hai
 Snow cracks open in the lower parts of the glacier
 barf rekha ke upar ye praayah sardi kii barf ke dhanushakar sanchay se chhip jate hai
 Detecting hidden cracks is a work of great care and experience
 taaja barf ke girane ke baad inhen barf kii kulhadi kii chhad kii aawaaj dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he, yaa daanye or baanye dekhakar jahaan aanshik rup se dhaki him daraar kaa konaa bilkul khulaa ho saktaa he
 The rope is the only protection against accident, and no one should ever cross a glacier covered with snow unless they have a rope, or have two companions
 daraaron ko paar karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko him daraar se bachaav main bhi paarangat hona chahie
 Changes in snow and rock conditions are mainly dangerous due to bad weather, these events occurring more suddenly than normal conditions are more difficult and harmful
 barf kii safed chadar main kisi raste kaa punah pataa lagaana kathin he jabaki barish sukhi sthitiyon ke sabase aasaan raste main jane se bhi rokatii he
 Climbers using the compass for direction benefit more than just experienced observers in the storm
 bilkul, bade barfile kshetron main, chattan ki tulana main galat raste par janaa aam hota he, lekin vatugat khataron se surakshit bachakar nikalne ke liye buddhi or anubhav sabase achche sahaayak hai
 Summer thunderstorms can also produce intense electricity
 agar parvatarohi shikhar par yaa uske nikat hon to maare jane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 There are many cases in which lightning was killed while climbing the mountain
 zyaadaatar pahari kshetron main, sthaneey toofaan subah ke baad or dopaher ke pehle utpann hote hai
 Most ascensions take "alpine onset"; Which happens before dawn or first ray to protect against storm activity and lightning speed and other seasonal hazards
 Strong winds can inhibit the invasion of hypothermia, as well as destroying equipment such as tents used for shelter
 In some specific conditions, storms can also create waterfalls, causing the process of mountaineering to slow or stop
 ayijar parvat par phan hawaaen iskaa jeeta jaagta udahaaran hai
 Rapid climbing can cause 'attitude Sickness'
 iskaa sabase acha ilaaj yah he ki turant neeche utar aaye
 bahut oonchaai par arohi kaa naaraa yah hota he ki "ooncha chadho, kam so", jiskaa arth he ki sangrakshak abhyast hone ke liye oonche parvat par chadhe lekin sone ke liye neeche utar aae
 dakshin america ke andes main, atitude sickness beemaari se bachane ke liye paaramparik rup se coca kii pattiyon chabaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Common symptoms of Attitude Sickness are severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, loss of appetite, lethargy and body pain
 parvatiy kamajori badhkar hes or hep main parivartit ho saktaa he, in donon se 24 ghante ke andar maut ho sakati he
 In high mountains, the atmospheric pressure is low and for this reason there is a lack of oxygen for breath
 yah atitude sickness kaa aadharbhoot kaaran he
 Everyone needs to get used to it, even those experienced climbers who have climbed to such heights before
 saamanyatya, 7000 meter se upar kii chadhaai karte samay parvatarohi bottleband kritrim oxygen kaa prayog kar lete hai
 Some special climbers climb to the peak of 8000 meters without oxygen, for which there is always a well planned exercise
 oonchai main saura vikiran kaaphi bad jaataa he kyonki oonchaai badhane par vayumandal patala hota jaataa he jis kaaran se yah kam parabangnee vikiran ko avashoshit karata he
 The snow cover can be obstructed by reflecting radiation, which increases the risk of sun scorching and snow blindness by up to 75%
 2005 main, shodhakarta or parvatarohi jon sample ne yah siddh kiya ki tibeti pathaar main ausat se adhik ozon sandratha parvatarohiyon ke liye ek atirikt jokhim kaa jokhim khadaa kar sakati he
 Some mountains are active volcanoes such as conjoined volcanoes that form the highest peak of the island divisions and in some parts of the Andes
 in jwalamukheey parvaton ke fatne ke kaaran kai khatre utpann ho sakate hai, jaise lahare, pyroklastik pravaah, chattaanon kaa girnaa, lava bahna, bhari maatra main tephra kaa girnaa, jwalamukhi bam kaa fatna or toxic gaisen
 == Mountaineering styles == There are two main styles of mountaineering: expedition climbing and Alpine system
 == Styling Shalya == Mountaineering Both main styles are: 'mohimevar Chadhai' and 'alpine System'
 Mountaineering has gained popularity as an Alpine method in Europe
 parvatarohan europamdhye alpine pranali mhanun prachlit aahe
 america main yah parvat chadhane kii ek vishisht style he jisamen barf arohan, chattan arohan or mishrit arohan kaa mishran hota he jahaan arohi apana puraa saamaan puure samay vahaan karata he
 In the US, Mount Chadhane is a unique style with high snowmelt, rock climbing and alloy assortment of mixtures, mixing with the whole material all over
 The term Alpine method used in the US is used with the ascent of campaign style where ascensors use porters, cargo animals, cooks, etc
 to carry their belongings and food

 Himalayya Mohimechya Shailachi Halacha is the main theme or Bhagatil Dongrachaya Swaroopamule
 Since camping in the Himalayas can take several days or weeks to travel, and it may take several weeks or perhaps months to climb the Himalayan mountains, a considerable amount of useful goods are required

 Due to that, Mohim's style of Himalayya Mothya and the inaccessible Shikharavarch used to go to Vaparli
 The need for expedition style in Europe and North America is less because most of the mountains can be reached by air or by car, are less high and can be climbed in a day or two

 Anode rays or plus rays or canal rays are rays formed from positive ions that originate in some gas discharge tubes 
 inhen sabase pehle 1886 main german bhautikashastri eugen goldstin ne crooks-tub main prayog karte samay dekha tha
 Later works on anode rays were performed by Wilhelm Wein and JJ Thomson which resulted in the development of mass spectrometry
 bahut kam daab par kisi gas nalika main vidyuta visarjan karne par cathod kirnon kii utpatti hoti he
 These cathode rays are mere currents of electrons, a fact that Faraday and Crooks had known in the late 19th century and confirmed this well
 atyant teevr vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav main electron gasiy parmaanuon se vilag ho jate hai or tatkaal prabal veg se dhanagar kii ore bhaagate hai
 In order of fast migration, they collide with neutral atoms of the gas and release each of their electrons
 is prakaar mukt honevaale electron bhi apane muktidaata electronon kii bhanti bade veg se dhanagar kii ore bhaagate hai or inhen ke pravaah se cathod kirnon kii sristi hoti he
 With the release of electrons from gaseous atoms in this way, it is quite natural to assume that residual atoms will be positively charged, behave like cations and move in the opposite direction of the electrons, ie, the velocity, but their velocity is relatively large
 Due to this, the electrons will be significantly lower than that
 runagra ke sannikatavarti gasiy parivesh main utpann honevaali mand udipti sambhavat: inhen dhanayanon ke kaaran utpann hoti hogi
 The truth of the above logical hypotheses was first proved by Goldstein in 1895 by experiment
 visarjan nalika ke baahar nikal jaaen or ek vidyurshi, yaa photo plate, par paden
 The result was satisfactory and the estimates proved to be accurate
 photo plate or vidyutdarshi ne apane upar padanevaale aayan pravaah kaa dhanayanon kii dhara hi siddh kiya
 Goldstein called these rays canal rays

 The results of his experiment were as follows: uparyukt maanon kaa gyaat karne ke liye veen ne sanyukt chumbakeey evam vidyut kshetron kii vidhi kaa hi avlamban kiya tha, jo electronon ke liye prayukt hui thi, yadhyapi canal kirnon ke liye chumbakeey kshetra kaa prayog kar sakna apekshaakrit adhik kathin tha
 When comparing canal rays to cathode rays, it becomes clear that their velocity is only 1 / 100 times their velocity

 Hence, it also appeared to be akin to canal rays

 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom
 siddharth gautam ab buddhatv paakar akaash jaise anant gyani ho chuke the
 Where does the Pipal tree under which he sits, go to the Bodhi tree i

 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc

 chhipi baat nahin he ki chikitsa sansthaanon main daakhile ke liye hode lagi rahati he
 Since after studying medical science there is no problem of employment like that after other technical courses
 isliye paathyakram main daakhile ke liye kuch adhik bheed rahati he
 Since there is a provision of management quota in private institutions and the colleges themselves decide the conditions for admission, the children of people with money are occupied in most seats there
 in paathyakramon main munhmaangi rakam dene waalon kii qatari lagi rahati he
 Obviously, running a college for management has become a big earning business
 magar daakhile main paardarshita or vyaavhaarik vyavastha na hone ke chalate bahut saare medhaavi vidhyaarthiyon ko daakhile se vanchit hona padataa he
 The Supreme Court had ordered the implementation of NEET based on the consent of the Central Government, Medical Council of India and Central Board of Secondary Education

 sangamagram ke madhav ek prasiddh kerala ganitagya-khagolgy the, ye bharat ke kerala rajya ke cochin jile ke nikat sthit ek kasbe irannalakkuta se the
 He is considered the founder of the Kerala Mathematics School
 ve pehle vyakti the, jinhone anek anant shreniyon vaale nikataagaman kaa vikaas kiya tha, jise "seemaa-parivartan ko anant tak le jane main pracheen ganit kii anant paddati se aage ek nirnaayak kadam" kaha jaataa he
 His discovery opened up avenues known today as mathematical analysis
 madhavan ne anant shreniyon, kalan, trikonmiti, jyamiti or bijganit ke adhyayan main agrani yogadan kiya
 He was one of the greatest mathematicians-astronomers of the medieval period
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah vichaar bhi diya he ki madhav ke kaary kerala skool ke madhyam se, jesut mishnariyon or vyapaariyon dwaara, jo us samay kochi ke pracheen pattan ke aasapaas kaaphi sakriy rahete the, europe tak bhi prasaarit hue hai
 As a result, it may also have had an impact on subsequent European development in analysis and calculus
 madhav kaa janm innarappili yaa innenavalli madhavan namboodiri ke rup main hua tha
 He wrote that his house name was related to a vihara, where he planted a plant named "bakulam"
 achyutha pishaarathi ke anusaar, bakulam sthaneey str par "iranni" ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Dr
 KV Sharma, who is the official of the works related to Madhavan, thinks that his household name is Irinnarappilly or Irinnaravalli
 irinnalakkuta kisi samay irinnatikutal ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Sangamagramam is a slang translation of the Dravidian word Irinatikutal in Sanskrit, meaning the word 'iru Ananti Kutal' or unity of two markets
 haalanki madhav se purv bhi kerala main kuch ganit sambandhi kaaryon ke pramaan hai, ullekhon se yah spasht he ki madhyayugin kerala main madhav ne samrudh ganitiya parampara ke vikaas ke liye ek srujanaatmak aaveg pradaan kiya
 However, most of Madhava's original works have been lost
 unke uttarvarti ganitagyon ke kaaryon main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, visheshtah nilkanth somayaji ke tantrasangrah main anek sinθ or arctanθ vaali anant shreniyon ke prasar ke rup main
 solahavaan sadi ke lekh mahageanyan prakaar main madhav ko π ke anek shrenee vyutpadanon ke strot ke rup main kiya gaya he
 In Jyeshthadeva's Yiddha language written in the Malayalam language, these categories are presented with evidence as to the spread of the Taylor series for polynomials such as 1 / , where x = tan θ etc
 is prakaar, vastav main koun se kaary madhav dwaara kiye gaye hai, yah ek vivaad kaa vishay he
 yukti-deepika, possibly composed by Jyeshthadeva's disciple, Sankar Variyar, offers several formats of range propagation for sin θ, cos θ and arctan θ, as well as some product of radius and length of the segment, most of which Versions also appear in the lingua franca
 us shrenee, jiske bare main rajagopal or rangachari ne tark diya he, kaa vyapak rup se uddhran mul sanskrit bhashaa se nahin diya jaataa, or chunki iname se kuch shreniyon ke liye nilkanth ne madhav ko shrey diya he, isliye sambhawatah kuch anya praaroop bhi madhav ke kaaryon main se hi ho sakate hai
 Others have speculated that the early formulation of the Karnapaddhati, or Mahagyanayana type may have been written by Madhava, but it is unlikely
 karnapaddati, ke saath hi kerala kii or bhi pracheen ganit rachana sadaratnamala or tantrasangrah tathaa yuktibhaasha par, 1834 ke charles mathew whish ke ek lekh main vichaar kiya gaya he, yah fluction kii khoj main newton par praathamikta hetu unka dhyaan aakarshith karne vaala pehla lekh tha
 In the mid-twentieth century, Russian scholar Jushkevich reviewed Madhava's legacy work, and in 1972 Sarma provided a teacher inspection of the Kerala school
 kai aise gyaat khagolgy hai jo madhavan ke kaal se pehle aaye the, isamen kutalur kizhar bhi the, vararuki, sankaranryna 
 ho saktaa he ki anya agyaat vyakti bhi unke purvakaal main astitv main rahe hon
 haalanki, hamaare paas madhavan ke baad ke kaal kaa ek spasht lekha he
 Parmeshwar Namboodiri was his direct disciple

 If we consider mathematics as a series from finite processes of algebra to infinite processes, then the first step towards this transformation would ideally begin with the expansion of infinite series
 This is the change towards the infinite series, for which Madhava is credited
 europe main,aisi pehali shrenee kaa vikaas 1667 main james gregory ne kiya tha
 Madhava's work in relation to the category is remarkable, but what is really extraordinary is the evaluation of the error term he made
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki anant shrenee kii seemaa sambandhi prakruti ko unhone bahut bhalee prakaar samajha tha
 Hence, Madhava may have invented the underlying ideas of infinite series propagation, power series, trigonometric series and rational approximation of infinite series
 haalanki, jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, vishuddh rup se madhav dwaara die gaye parinaam or unke parvartiyon dwaara die gaye parinaamon kaa nirdhaaran kar paanaa kuch kathin he
 Below is a summary of the results for which Madhava has been credited by various scholars
 unke anek yogadanon ke antargat, unhone sine, cosine, tangent or arctangent trikoshmitiya falnon ke liye anant shrenee kii khoj kii or ek vrutt kii paridhi kii gananaa ke liye bhi kai tareeke nikaale
 yuktibhaasha pustak se gyaat madhav kii ek shrenee he, jo sparshajya ke vyutkram kii ghaat shrenee kaa pramaan or vupadan sammilit karti he, isaki khoj madhav dwaara hi kii gayi thi
 In the book, Jyesthadeva explains this category in this way
 isse praapt hoga r θ = r sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ − r 3 3 + r 5 5 − r 7 7 + 
 
 
 { \ displaystyle r \ theta ={ \ frac {r \ sin \ theta }{ \ cos \ theta }}- \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{3}}{ \ left^{3}}}+ \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{5}}{ \ left^{5}}}- \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{7}}{ \ left^{7}}}+


} Which later gives such a result: yah shrenee paramparaagat rup se gregory shrenee ke naam se jaani jaati thi
 Even if we consider this category to be the discovery of Jyeshthadeva, it would be a century before Gregory's time and certainly other infinite categories of this type have been discovered by Madhava
 aaj, ise madhav-gregory-lebinise shrenee ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Madhava also gave the most suitable table for sines, defined as the values of half-sine creatures drawn at equal intervals on the quadrant of a given circle
 aisa mana jaataa he ki unhone yah atyant sateek saarini nimna shrenee prasaron ke aadhaar par praapt kii hogi: In the following verses Madhava has given the relation of the circumference of the circle and its diameter which is expressed through the past number in this verse - iskaa arth he- 9 x 1011 vyas vaale vrutt kii paridhi 2872433388233hogi
 In relation to the value of π, we find mention of Madhava's work in the Mahagyanayana prakara where some scholars like Sarma, believe that this book may have been written by Madhava himself, on the other hand it was written by 16th century successors
 The chances are high
 yah pustak anek prasaron ke liye madhav ko hi shrey detii he or π ke liye nimna anant shrenee prasar detii he, jise ab madhav-lebinise shrenee ke naam se janaa jaataa he: Which he derived from the power series expansions of the arc-tangent function
 haalanki, sabase adhik prabhavit karne vaali baat yah he ki unhone ek sanshodhan pad, Rn bhi diya, jo n padon tak gananaa ke baad aane vaali truti ke liye tha
 Madhava had given three forms of Rn which modified the approximation, it named jahaan tisare sanshodhan ke falswaroop π kaa atyant parishuddh pariklan miltaa he
 How to reach this type of amendment post
 sabase vishwasaneey tathy yah he ki ye satat bhinn ke pratham teen abhisaron ke rup main aate hai jise swayan hi π ke maanak nikat maan se vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he, yah 62832 / 2 xxrep 4 0 he 
 He gave an even more quickly convergent series by converting the original infinite series of π to the infinite series
 π ke nikatatam maan ke pariklan ke liye pehle 21 padon ke prayog dwaara, unhone ek aisa maan praapt kiya jo dashamalav ke 11 sthanon tak sahi tha 
3
1415926535898 kaa maandashmalav ke 13 sthanon tak sahi, ke liye bhi kabhi-kabhi madhav ko shrey diya jaataa he
 But this is probably given by one of his disciples
 yah paanchavi shatabdi se π ke sabase parishuddh nikatatam maanon main se tha 
 The book Sadratnamala, generally considered to be a pre-madhav book, also surprisingly gives an extremely accurate value of π, π = 3
14159265358979324
 On this basis, R
K
 Gupta has argued that this book may also have been written by Madhav itself
 madhav ne vruttkhand kii lambaai kii anya shreniyon or isse sambandhit π kii parimey bhinn sankhyaon ke nikatatam maan par bhi anusandhan kiya, unhone bahupad prasar ke tareeke khoje, anant shrenee ke liye abhisarita pareekshan khoja or anant satat bhinn sankhyaon kaa vishleshan kiya
 He also found the solution of esoteric equations by iteration and obtained the approximate values of esoteric numbers by continuous fractions
 madhav ne kalan ke vikaas kii neenv rakhi, jise unke parvartiyon ne kerala skool of estronaumi and mathematics main aage viksit kiya
 Madhava also carried forward some of the results obtained from ancient works, including the works of Bhaskara II
 kalan main, unhone avkalan, samakalan ke praarambhik praaroop kaa prayog kiya he or unhone yaa unke shishyon ne saadhaaran phalno ke samakalan kaa vikaas kiya
 K
V
 Sharma has described Madhav as the author of the following books: madhavan ke baad keraly ganit sampradaay kam se kam do shatabdiyon tak faltaa-phulataa rahaa
 From Jyeshthadeva we got the idea of integration, which was called Sankalam, as in this statement: jo samakalan ko ek aise char ke rup main anuvaadit karata he jo char ke varg ke aadhe ke baraabar hoga; arthath x dx kaa samakalandad2 / 2 ke baraabar hoga
 This is clearly the beginning of integration
 isse sambandhit ek anya parinaam kahata he ki kisi vakr ke andar kaa kshetrafal uske samakal ke baraabar hota he
 Most of these results date back several centuries before similar results existed in Europe
 anek prakaar se, jyeshthadev kii yuktibhaasha kalan par vishwa kii pehali pustak maani ja sakati he
 Madhava has been called "the greatest mathematician-astronomer of the Middle Ages", or "the founder of mathematical analysis"; some of his research in this area reveals that he had an extraordinary intuition talent

 us samay,sangamagram ke nikat sthit kochi kaa pattan samudriya vyapaar kaa ek pramukh centre tha or anekonjesut mishnariyaan or vyapaaree is kshetra main sakriy the
 Given the fame of the Kerala school and the interest shown by some of the Jesuit group among the local scholars during this period, some scholars, including, U
K
 Of Manchester, J
 Joseph is also said to have said that articles from the Kerala school reached Europe during this period, dating back to a century before Newton's time
 haalanki in lekhon kaa koi bhi europea anuwaad astitv main nahin he, phir bhi yah sambhav he ki in vichaaron ne vishleshan or kalan main baad ke europea vikaason ko prabhavit kiya ho
 
yah lekhak ke vichaaron ko uchit dhang se na samaj paane ke kaaran hua
 In the 16th century, the Jesuits, who were familiar with the reputation of Madhavan and his disciples, found it almost impossible to study Sanskrit and Malayalam and pass it on to European mathematicians, instead of making this discovery on their own
 Let's claim sanrachana ejiniyari, ejiniyari kii vah shakha he jo lod sahan karne yaa bal kaa pratirodh karne ke ke liye banaayi jane vaali sanrachanaon ke vishleshan evam dizin se sambandh rakhti he

 The theory of structural engineering is based on empirical knowledge related to physical laws and properties of various materials / geometries
 anekon chote chote sanrachanaatmak avyavon ke yoga se jatil sanrachanaayen nirmit kii jaatin hai
 a structural engineer should not only have the knowledge of iron and steel, but also have advanced knowledge of wood, brick, stone, lime and cement and should also be proficient in mechanical and electrical engineering work, because they are safe and secure according to the principles of their structure, mechanics and physics
 Have to make from bhoomi, jal or vaayu kii prakruti kaa bhi purna gyaan civil ejeeniyar ke samaan hi hona chahie
 Structural engineering was considered a department of civil engineering till the 19th century, but as the requirements of civil society changed and increased according to the circumstances, production and use of advanced types of iron, steel etc
 started to increase, so did mechanics Has progressed

 In the famous bridge across the Forth River in Scotland, which is built of cantilever, two arches are formed at the base of three pillars in the middle of the river, each of which is 1,710 feet in length and the bridge across the bridge, from coast to coast, 5215 Ft
 america kaa quebec pul to duniyaan bhar ke canteliver pulon main sabase bada samajha jaataa he
 Its central arch is 1,800 feet

 The design of each building requires roofs and floors for dharnas, scissors, pillars and a foundation built on the ground
 inkaa sangyojan hi makaan kaa 'dhaanchaa' he
 Whether the structure is for any building, bridge or crane, etc
, it is necessary to consider while constructing them that what kind of force and how much quantity of external force will fall on their various components
 sthitiki ke siddhantanusaar un balon ke kaaran, dhaanche ke vividh avyavon par aanevaale pratibalon kii gananaa bhi badi saavdhaanee se kerani hoti he, jisase dhaanchaa sab prakaar se sudrudh or niraapad ban jaae
 Making the structure strong does not mean making its components very thick and heavy
 dhaanche kii banaavat main bal sahan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 Such a structure is made by combining several triangles
 chaturbhujon or panchabhujon se bane dhaanche main itani kshamta nahin hoti
 The triangular frame is called scissors
 ye balon ke sahane ke drushtikon se sarvatha nirdosh or avyavon kii drushti se swat: purna hoti he
 Such scissors can be made for very long legs and can also be balanced on its own
 bade paat kii chhaten banane ke liye deevaaron par saadhaaran thos prakaar ke lambey garder rakhkar hi kyon nahin kaam chalaaya jaataa? trikoawmay kainchiyan hi kyon banaai jaati hai? maamuli chote paaton kii chhaten to avashya hi uchit maap ke sade garder rakhkar banaai ja sakati hai, parantu garder bahut adhik lambey hone par baari tathaa mahange padate hai
 For large legs, triangular canes are very strong and very light and cheap
 kainchiyon ke jodon ko pinon dwaara na banaakar ribaton dwaara pakkaa jad diya jaataa he
 Some special types of forces start coming in the rebats which these rebates must be made stronger to bear
 samast chat ke pataav kaa bhaar batton ke madhyam se vibhajit hokar kainchiyon ke trikonon ke upree jodon par aakar, sab kainchiyon par baraabar bantkar or in kainchiyon ke bhaar sahit aadha-aadha bantkar diwaar ke teke par padakar antatah buniyaad par jaataa he
 Therefore, these burdens have to be estimated very carefully
 ye bojhe sadaiv ek se hi bane rahane ke kaaran achal bhaar kehalaate hai
 All vertical walls and sloping roofs are subjected to the vertical pressure caused by the side air, which is called air pressure and it comes in the count of moving load
 anek manzile makaanon kii madhyavarti chhaton par vahaan ke nivaasiyon or uthau fernichar kaa bhaar hi hota he lekin yah anya achal bhaaron kii apeksha naganya hota he
 The forces falling on different components of the structure are calculated according to the principle of force triangle or force polygons
 iske liye ejeeniyar "bau sanket" pranali kaa upyog karte hai
 This method is relatively simple
 balon kaa pariklan vishuddh ganit dwaara bhi sthitiki or trikonmiti kii sahaayta se kiya ja saktaa he
 To calculate in this way, assuming an appropriate point to be the center of the pulverizer, equate the rotating force of unknown force falling in any component of the structure
 jitne hi adhik bade paat kii chat kii kanchi athwa pul kaa kanchinuma garder anaaya jaataa he usamen utane hi adhik sankhya main chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yahi baat kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yah baat kainchiyon ke thaamon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Therefore, the scissors are divided into small triangles of appropriate size to withstand the force
 dhaanchaa par jo boj padate hai use bhaar kehete hai
 Movable and fixed loads are mentioned above
 yadi bhaar kisi thodi si jagah par kendrit he, to use kendrit bhaar or yadi puure avyavon par failaa ho, to use vibhajit bhaar kehete hai
 The load of the vehicles, trains, motors, trucks, etc
, is called the load and the load coming from one direction and immediately after the other direction is called the load with the alternating load and the impact load
 padaarthon kaa pratibal bhi hota he
 Stress, compression, shear, cramps etc
 can be stress due to the condition and tendency of the load
 pratibal ke prabhaav se jo parivartan hota he use vikruti kehete hai
 Substances have the property of elasticity, less in some and less in some and more in some
 pratyasthata kii seemaa hoti he
 Substances that exceed the limit are broken
 hook ne san 1676 main ek niyam sthapit kiya ki yadi prayek padaarth par uski pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaaya jaae, to uske kaaran padanevaala pratibal tathaa us padaarth main honevaali vikruti main ek vishesh anupaat hoga
 In 1826, Dr
 Young definitively ascertained the proportions of deformations in various substances due to stresses falling within the range of elasticity
 ise yang kaa pratyasthata mapank kehete hai
 The tensile and compression ratios are expressed by the E, shear ratios C, or the letter g and the volume ratios are expressed by the k letter: pratyaksh pratyasthata mapank Transverse elasticity modulus sampeden se padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he
 Thus, the elastic elasticity modulus tapochar tathaa yantropchaar se pratyasthata mapaankon main parivartan ho jaaya karata he
 If a solid rod is pulled, we see that it breaks thinly in the middle and if it is pulled by applying force within the range of elasticity, its lateral measurement becomes smaller as it increases in length
 
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chad ko dabaaya jaae, to uski parshvik naap bad jaati he
 Therefore, the change in the lateral measurements of a direct solid due to stretch or pressure is in proportion to the Poisson
 ise m akshar se vyakt karte hai
 a pure mismatch is in the form of a mixture of stresses, two materials and each other acting in opposite directions
 inaki kriya rekha bhi ek duusare se samakon par hoti he
 If one end of the axle is firmly tightened in the wall and the other end is applied with force, the other end will be slightly bent
 mula rekha se jitna kone, dd banaakar vah mudata he vah kone uskaa anthan kone hoga
 With the help of this angle the spasm force of axle can be removed
 ejiniyari main kaam aanevaali samagriyon kaa pareekshan atyaavashyak he
 Placing them under the same conditions as the materials used, should be tested
 pareekshan do prakaar se hota he : ek raasayanik reeti se samagriyon ke aanvik sanghathan kaa gyaan hota he or bhautik reeti se khinchakar, dabaakar, aparupan kar, panch se chhedakar, jhukaa kar tathaa modakar dekha jaataa he ki unke sahan karne kii samta kisi he
 Nowadays, a device has been made to test the material in physical way, which is called Hounsfield tensometer
 isaki kaarypaddati badi saral he or saamaanya vyakti bhi thode se prashikshan se iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 With this, knowledge of the strength of materials, load distortion, abstinence etc
 is easily achieved
 jab tak kisi padaarth par padanevaale pratibal us padaarth kii pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar rahata he, tab tak vikruti badi sookshm yaa asthaayee hoti he
 As soon as the weight is removed, that substance returns to its original state
 par yadi pratibal pratyasthata kii seemaa ke upar ho, to vikruti paryaapt ore adhik sthaayee hoti he
 The fraction weight is much higher than the limit of elasticity, but in terms of trade and utility, this weight is kept low and is called the point of defeat and it is considered as the differential weight
 pratyasthata kii seemaa sahane yogya bhaar se bhi kaaphi kam maatra main bhaar daalane kii yojana, abhiklpana ke samay kii jaati he
 Therefore, the ratio in which this practical load is less than the most bearable load, that ratio is called the Abbey Coefficient or Depressor of that substance
 ise nimnlikhit sutara se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Representatives of different substances are different in different states
 kathor ispaat kaa abhayank sthir bhaar main teen tathaa chal bhaar main paanch se aath or prayavarti chal bhaar main nau se 13 tak hota he
 The hardness of materials can easily be estimated by their stress, compression, contouring, etc
 forces
 kathorta pareekshan kii aadhunik vidhiyaan, sthitik danturata or gatyaatmak danturata ke siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Brinell's hardness-test-method based on static dentistry theory, according to which a part of the test substance is polished finely like glass, and is pressed on it with standard weights by instruments by placing a bullet of very hardened steel, standard diameter
 isse polish kii hui sataha par gol nishaan pad jaataa he
 By measuring the diameter of the mark, remove the hardness of the bullet according to the following formula: yadi goli kaa vyas d or nishaan kaa vyas d mimi

 or lohe tathaa ispaat ke liye 3,000 kigra
, pital aadi mulaayam dhaatuon ke liye 1,000 kriga
 or sis aadi bahut mulaayam dhaatu ke padaarthon ke liye 50 kriga
 maanak bhaar rakhaa jaataa he
 The weight is usually kept so that the diameter of the mark does not exceed 3 / 8 of the diameter of the bullet
 pareekshan kisi bhi vyas kii goli se kiya ja saktaa he, par daab or goli ke vyas kaa anupaat, p / , ek sa rahanaa chahie
 a steel bullet is used for general hardness and a diamond bullet for high hardness
 kathor padaarthon par 15 second tak or mulaayam padaarthon par 30 second tak bhaar diya jaataa he
 There is a system of finely measuring the mark
 wickers vidhi se bhi kathortank nikaala jaataa he
 In this place, Hirakni is used in the form of a square pyramid in place of bullet
 isse chaukor gaddha banataa he, jiskaa vikarn or gaharaai adhik yatharthata se naapi ja sakati he
 The hardness is extracted from it as follows: gatyamak danturata par aadhaarit anek yantra bane hai, jinamein shor ) kaa banaaya hua scale roscp sarvaadhik prasiddh he
 It consists of a cylindrical hammer of steel, weighing about 40 grains
 hathaudi ke nichevali takkar par uttal akruti kii hirakani lagi rahati he, jiske chor kaa kshetrafal lagbhag 0

 Similarly, the compression of various substances multiplied by the appropriate constants and the algebraic strength may also be known
 sanrachana ejiniyari ke kaamon main vividh prakaar ke bal dekhe jate hai
 They can be divided into the following six major categories: vibhinn avyav ribaton dwaara, athwa bolton dwaara, jode jate hai
 The joints made by the rebats are permanent and can be cut apart, but the joints made by bolts are temporary and can be opened in different subdivisions
 sanrachana kaary main sabhi prakaar ke avyav mulaayam ispaat ke vividh pariched yukt chhadon or platon se banaae jate hai
 The passages of the rods are round, flat, rectangular, L, t or h etc

 When both ends of a straight component are loaded on it by hinging it on a strong base, it is called a dharna or girder
 dharan par bojha rakhane se vah bich main lachak ja sakati he or yadi usapar bojha samarthy se adhik ho, to uski nichali sataha fatne lagati he
 Ravana Hatha is an Indian musical instrument
 yah ek pracheen muda hua vaayalin he, jo bharat or srilanka ke saath-saath aasapaas ke kshetron main lokapriy he
 It is an ancient Indian warp musical instrument on which Western instrumental musical instruments such as the violin and the viola were later based
