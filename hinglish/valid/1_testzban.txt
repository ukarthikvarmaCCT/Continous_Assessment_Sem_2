 List of metropolitan cities of India kriya ke jis rup se yah gyaat ho ki vaakya main kriya dwaara sampadit vidhaan kaa vishay karta he, karm he, athwa bhav he, use vachya kehete hai
 That change of verb is called speech, by which one can understand which of the subject, karma or emotion is dominant in the sentence
 inamen kisi ke anusaar kriya ke purush, vachan aadi aae hai
 There are three types of speech vaakya main kriya ke ling, vachan tathaa purush kaa adhyayan 'prayog' kehalaata he
 It is seen that the gender of the verb of the sentence, the word and the man is sometimes according to the gender of the doer, the word and the man, sometimes according to the gender of the verb, the word and man, but sometimes the verb of the sentence is according to the subject and the verb Instead of being singular, there is singular, masculine and other male; This is the experiment
 kartari prayog- jab vaakya kii kriya ke ling, vachan or purush karta ke ling, vachan or purush ke anusaar hon tab kartari prayog hota he; Like- Mohan reads good books
 karmani prayog- jab vaakya kii kriya ke ling, vachan or purush karm ke ling, vachan or purush ke anusaar hon tab karmani prayog hota he; Like- Sita wrote the letter
 bhaave prayog- jab vaakya kii kriya ke ling, vachan or purush karta athwa karm ke ling, vachan or purush ke anusaar na hokar ekvachan, puling tathaa anya purush hon tab bhaave prayog hota he; Like - i can't go away
 sita se royaa nahin jaataa
 According to the above experiments, there are three distinctions of speech: kartruvachya- kriya ke us roopaantar ko kartruvachya kehete hai, jisase vaakya main karta kii pradhanta kaa bodh ho
 As Ram reads the book, i read the book
 karmavachi- kriya ke us roopaantar ko karmavachi kehete hai, jisase vaakya main karm kii pradhanta kaa bodh ho
 As the book is read; Mango is eaten
 yahan kriyaayein karta ke anusaar roopaantarrit na hokar karm ke anusaar parivartit hui hai
 It is worth noting here that like English, karmachay is not used in Hindi while being a doer; For example, instead of 'I drink milk', it is wrong to write 'I drink milk'
 haan, nishedh ke arth main yah likhaa ja saktaa he- mujhase patr likhaa nahin jaataa; usase padhaa nahin jaataa
 Bhavavachaya - That version of a verb is called Bhavavachaya, which indicates the primacy of the verb or emotion in a sentence
 kriya ke ling vachan karm ke ling evam vachan ke anusaar hote he
 Like - Mohan does not even walk
 mujhase uthaa nahin jaataa
 Does not go in the sun
 tippanee- yahan yah spasht he ki kartruvachya main kriya sakarmak or akarmak donon ho sakati he, kintu karmavachi main keval sakarmak or bhavvachya main akarmak hoti Mumbai Express is a 2005 Hindi language film

 sahitya chaahe vah kisi bhi desh athwa bhashaa kaa ho, vah apane loksahitya or usamen maujuud jansanvaadan kii kala kaa sadaiv rini rahaa he
 He draws from the Shruti tradition, the base material for his main inspirations

 Therefore, in a country where the folklore is rich, it takes relatively less time to absorb culture and traditions as well as to imbibe new knowledge
 bharat main to shiksha kii parampara hi gurukulon se nikali he
 How many nachiketas have left the kingdoms in this country in search of truth
 yah baat alag he ki vidhivat shiksharjan kii suvidha pehle samaaj ke vishisht virgon tak hi simit thi
 As a result of which the seekers like Karna and Ekalavya have been searching for knowledge, eventually proved to be unhappy
 shiksha-vanchit varg ke liye jansanvaadan kii kala kaa mahatva samaaj ke baaki logon kii apeksha kahin adhik tha
 Particularly in the feudal times when the world of publishing was not as large and powerful as it is today, due to social relations, class complexity, majority of the population was denied resources
 tab jansamanya kii manoranjan-sambandhi aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne, anubhav tathaa gyaan kii paramparaon ko agali peedi tak le jane or unhen sahejkar rakhane ke liye jansanvaadan kii kala kaa sahaara liya jaataa tha
 It can be said that while the intellectuals created history and tradition, practice, cultural symbols and myths to collect and analyze them, on the one hand, they created the classical texts, while making them accessible to the public and making them part of life
 Along with Lokaranjan, the art of kissing developed
 kissagoi kii shuruyaat kab or kahaan par hui iske bare main thik-thik bataa paanaa to sambhav nahin he
 Only inference can be made
 sabhyataa ke aarambhik daur main jab manushya ne kisi anokhi vastu, praani yaa ghatana ke bare main kuch badha-chadhaakar, katipay rochak andaaj main or lokranjan kii vaanchhaa ke saath bayaan karne kii koshish kii hogi; to swaabhaavik rup main baaki logon main uske kahan ke prati lalak paidaa hui hogi
 As a result, the collective curiosity about those experiences and the tradition of listening to them repeatedly, in an interesting way, developed
 usamen kalpana kaa anupaat bhi uttarottar badhata chalaa gaya
 This led to the development of the art of folklore and storytelling
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kissa or kissagoi hai kya? The larger version of the story, which lasts for a relatively long period of time, with many twists in the plot, conflict of characters, emotions, mental instillation and conflict of thoughts, comes in the case
 ise baat athwa batakahi ke naam se bhi janaa gaya he
 The anecdote can also be a single story headline and a set of multidimensions
 kabhi-kabhi pradhan kathanak ke ird-gird vividh bhav-bhangimaaon se bharpoor kai laghu kahaniyaan lapet di jaati hai
 The tradition of making small stories a big storyline and making them into a story has been popular in almost all countries of the world, not only present but also popular
 unka swaroop bhi samay or paristhatiyon ke anusaar adalata-badalata rahata tha
 Kisago used to work on his ability and imagination to make them more interesting and memorable
 bandhe-bandhaae shabdon main kahen to kissagoi kalpana ke rasaatmak kahan kii kala he
 With which we all have a connection
 maa kii lori ke saath-saath


jab balak shabdon kaa arth pahchaanana shuru karata he, shaayad tabhi se
 Hypnosis which started from childhood due to anecdote does not diminish
 isamen kalpana kaa maadhurya bharaa hota he
 Such elegance would be contained in which the eyes begin to speak
 shabdon ko jubaan mil jaati he
 Arthas themselves become assertive
 kaalpanik hone ke baavjood uskaa varnan itnaa pramanik, rasmay or jeevant hota he ki shrota uske pravaah main bahe chale jate hai
 This is a particular genre in terms of writing
 jisamen kathakaar apane pathak ke saath sambodhan kii sthiti main hota he
 Instead of writing, he tells the story
 kathy main kissago kii rachanaatmakataa bhi shaamil ho jaati he
 Due to which sound beauty comes naturally in the composition and its eligibility is increased
 parinamtah pathak-shrota ko apekshaakrit adhik anand or tripti kaa anubhav hota he
 Kisagoi accepted in folk tradition becomes the classical language narrative
 jansanskruti main kisse-kahaniyon kaa bahut hi mahatva rahaa he
 Often the elders of the society handled the responsibility of the story
 kai baar yahi kala logon kii jeevika kaa aadhaar bhi ban jaati thi
 The fine art of telling a good story is a delight on gold
 aise prratibhavan kissago bhi rahe hai jo bina kisi purv taiyaari ke sirf apni kalpanaashakti ke bal par, ek sutra thamkar kahana prarambh karte or baat / bahakahi badhate-badhate mjedaar kahani yaa kisse kaa rup le leti thi
 Moral and social consciousness was so intense in traditional rural life that the individual not only recognized the dangers of deviation from them, but also tried to stay away from them as much as possible
 naitik evam saamaajik moolyabodh se parichit karaane ke liye use sahitya jaise kisi bahyah upkram kii aavashyaktaa utani nahin thi; jitani ki aaj mahasoos kii jaati he
 Then this work was done by various mediums related to religion and ethos
 duusare shabdon main sahakaar evam sashastitv ko samarpit tab ke gramyahjivan main saamaajik mulya, manas ke saath-saath viksit hote the tathaa unke bich dwait kii sthiti kam hi utpann hoti thi
 Certainly, the art of mass communication, which is also a form of storytelling, had a huge contribution in it
 or sanchaar madhyamon ke atirek ke bich, kam hi ho, magar aaj bhi usee tarah bana hua he
 Chapal culture has been the hallmark of agricultural societies
 har gaanv main ek chepal hona anivaary tha
 Not only this, the dignity of the entire village was determined by the materials used in its construction, architecture and crafts etc
 inhen chapaalon par kissagoi kii kala khub fali-phuli
 But it was not necessary for the story to choose Chappal for his skills
 garmiyon main pedo kii chhaanv tale maveshi charaate hue, barsaat main khule aasmaan ke neeche rimjhim buundon kaa anand lete hue, sardi main gaanv ke tirahon-chairahon par alaav tapate hue, abhavagrast jhonpadiyon main raat bitaate samay kisse-kahaniyon ke anwarat daur chalate hi rahete the
 Anurag towards Kisagoi was not limited to any particular section or community of the society
 balki samaaj ke praayah sabhi varg isamen ruchi lete the
 Some people's livelihood used to go on narrating an anecdote to the kings and emperors
 iske bhi kai pramaan hai ki puraane jamaane main badshaah ke darbar main kuch aise hunarmand log bhi hote the; jo unhen or unke shahjadon ko sirf kisse-kahani sunaaya karte the
 Successful storytellers did not have to wander for their livelihood
 sashastitv or aparigrah ko samarpit lokbhaavna uski jaruraton kii bharpai ke liye koi na koi vidhaan garh hi leti thi
 He used to keep on calling for them from nearby villages
 thalwaar ke dinon daksh kissago doordaraj ke gaanvon kii saiyr kar aate
 When such artists reached somewhere on the occasion of a fair, festival or marriage, there used to be a buzz
 din-bhar ke kaam ke baad apane anubhav or sukh-dukh baantne ke liye log unke paas jutane lagate
 Where the weather, apart from discussing various social conditions, entertainment was also taken care of
 jisamen gadhy or padya donon prakaar kii prastutiyaan sthaan paatin
 Among the poetry compositions, dhola-maru, Alha, Ramayana etc
 were prominent, and stories were heard mainly in prose
 jinamein aliff-laila, kissa tota-maina, sahasr rajaneecharitra, dastaane chaar darvesh, singhaasana batisi, vaital pachisi, kathasaritsagar, jataka kathaayen aadi pramukh the
 These stories were very popular in the general public and were heard and heard in different forms without knowing their original source
 yahi nahin avasar ke anuroop rochakata evam aakarshan banaae rakhane ke liye kissago unamem apni ruchi evam pratibhanuroop badlaav karne ko bhi swatantra rahete the
 Some stories were proactive both in prose and verse, and it depended on the ability of the story-artist and the choice of audience to choose which genre to present
 kathanak praayah shrotaaon ke jane-pahachaane hote the
 There was no claim of any story against his originality
 moulik hota tha kisse ke prastutikaran kaa andaaj
 Highly imaginative, original style, captivating communication and the inner struggle of the characters were able to bring the masses to their magical effect
 usee ke aadhaar par unki shreshthata ke daawey kaa nirdhaaran hota
 The result of the confirmation of Kisagoi tradition in the society was that Tulsidas starts Ramcharitmanas with the mouth of Kakabhusundi
 gita jaisi gahan-gambhir darshanik gaveshna kaa avataran shrikrishna ke mukh se hota he, arjuna vahaan maatra shrota he
 The entire Mahabharata is Sanjay's statement
 kissagoi style ke aadhunik gadhyakaron main devakinandan khatra, premchand, pandeya bechan sharma ‘ugr’, amritlal nagar, vijaydaan detha aadi kii lokapriyata kaa yahi rahasy he
 The magical realism present in Marquez's prose is in fact the elegance of Kissagoi; Whose world is being crazy today
 lokachar kaa anivaary hissaa hone ke kaaran jaruri he ki kissago ko lokmanas kii acchhee parakh ho
 He knows the art of choosing subjects according to his interest
 dhyatavya he ki kissagoi kaa vikaas samuhik manoranjan kii kala ke rup main hua he
 Within the story, the sense of address to the group is hidden
 manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 His joys and sorrows are shared
 isliye manoranjan athwa lokranjan ke madhyamon par sabhi kaa adhikaar ekasmaan hota he
 The story assumes that it is for the welfare of others, who are actually part of his own society
 tabhi vah prastutikaran ke liye aksar bagaiyr kisi laalach ke, keval apnatv evam sauhaard-bhaavana ke saath prastut hota he
 The spirit of public welfare and unwavering dedication to it is what makes Kissa and Kisagoi acceptable and useful
 pustakon main haalanki kissagoi keval ek style ke rup main maujuud rahati he
 And the reader is often alone when passing through them
 kintu uskaa prastutikaran samuhik sambodhan hi hota he, jahaan lekhak likhane ke bajaae sunaata he
 So that the reader always feels that he is not alone
 apitu brihad samaaj kii ek atimahatvapurn ikai he
 The same quality of storytelling proves him distinct and distinct from the other styles of communication and enhances his chances of folklore
 atah samuhikta ko kissagoi ke ek aavashyak lakshan ke rup me dekha ja saktaa he
 Along with collectivism, the spirit of universalism is also associated with the story
 yaddhapi duniya ke vibhinn deshon-samaajon kii bhugolic tathaa paristhitigat kaarnon se apni kuch khaas vishistataaen hoti hai
 They prove it different from other countries and societies
 iske baavjood alag-alag deshon or samaajon main rah rahe logon ke swabhaav main kuch samanthaayen bhi hoti hai
 They also bring them closer to each other
 jaise ki naitikta ko lekar duniya ke sabhi samaaj ek jaisaa soch rakhte hai
 In almost all human societies, compassion towards pranimatra has been considered a sublime human value
 isi prakaar daan ko aavashyak kartavya kii sangya sabhi samaajon main praapt he
 Conversely, false, dishonest, cheating, etc
, are considered as hey, and education to avoid them is given uniformly in all societies
 kissagoi kii safalataa ke liye jaruri he ki uske peeche shaashvat jeevanamoolya or sarvloukikta kii udaatt bhaavana nihit ho
 Only then does he get the support of people of different interest and ideas
 isi ke kaaran kissagoi pradhan rachanaaen desh-pradeshon kii simaaon ko parkar duniya-bhar kii yatra karne main kaamyaab siddh hoti hai
 In the meantime, though some difference comes naturally to them, but the original soul of the composition is often unchanged
 praayah vahi vishay kissagoi main sweekaaryata paane main safal rahete hai jo vivaad se pare hon tathaa jinaki saarvkalik upyogita siddh ho chuki ho
 Even at the level of entertainment, care is taken to ensure that it does not hurt the feelings of any person, religion or class
 or vah itnaa ‘balgar’ bhi na ho ki samooh main usko kaha-suna na ja sake
 Subjects which are beyond the boundaries of the country and after a little change can form the basis of the story of any society; In which the underlying truth has the potential to become the truth of majority societies, it is considered more popular in the stories
 kissagoi kaa janm hi lokranjan ke liye hua he
 People mainly come in contact with Kissago in search of entertainment
 kisse-kahani main antarnihit mulya uske baad kaa sthaan rahete hai
 Therefore, interestingness is also important in the essential characteristics of anecdote
 iske abhaav main kissago kii safalataa sambhav hi nahin he
 It should also not be taken to mean that only entertainment is intended for storytelling
 jivan or manushyata ke bare koi bhi bayaan tabhi mahatvapurn ban paata he jab vah yaa to kisi auchity kii vyakhya karata ho yaa usase kisi na kisi rup main judaa ho
 If Lokaranjan is based on positive characters, events or proves them to be varsity in any way, then the listener / reader usually takes inspiration from him
 atah kisse-kahani main naitikta ke prati aagrahashiltaa sadaiv apekshit hoti he
 But he should remain completely free from its pressure
 kisse-kahani main rochakata ke mulya par naitikta kii ghuspaith honi hi nahin chahie
 In other words, knowledge or value can be the byproduct or by-product of creative presentation, not the original product
 agar aisa he bhi to yah kaam itane kaushal se kiya janaa chahie ki pathak athwa shrota ko uskaa abhas tak na ho
 That is, the presentation of the work should be so effortless and juxtaposed that it binds the audience-readers to its magical charm
 kissagoi main kamyaabi kaa ek maapdand yah bhi he ki prastutikaran ke dauraan kissago apane pathak yaa shrota ko apane kitne kareeb laane main kaamyaab rahata he
 This quality of intimacy instills an affection for people in the heart of the story
 yahi uski lokapriyata ko nirantar aage le jaataa he
 Successful anecdote is the same with the raising of the voice, the listeners start to travel to the space and seeing its stagnation, they start feeling a bit stagnant
 jisaki rachana ko sunate yaa padhate samay shrota / pathak khud ko uske saath itnaa antarang anubhav karen ki kisi tarah ke dwait kii sambhaavna hi na rahe, sirf kissagoi ke pravaah main behate chale jaaen
 For this, Kissago has to go down several steps from his intellectual ego and communicate directly with his listener or reader
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa vishistataabodh ahmanyata kaa ehsaas kissago kii style ko na keval bojhil bana detaa he; balki shrotaaon / pathakon ko manoranjan ke anya sadhano kii ore bhi dhakel saktaa he
 Obviously, the presentation also has to be groomed and polished at the language level
 sahajabodhya muhaavareydaar bhashaa kaa prayog kissagoi ko nikhaarane main madad karata he
 As stated above, the anecdote is a departure from the tradition of artistic saying
 jisamen kissago apane anubhav, gyaan tathaa kalpana ke yoga se itihaas ke kisi ansh, ghatana athwa kathanak ko rochak andaaj main shrota ke samaksh prastut karata he
 Some such that the listeners get immersed in it
 yahaan tak vakt kaa ehsaas bhi unhen na rahe
 It is often addressed to a large audience
 jisamen ashikshit bhi ho sakate hai tathaa alag-alag mizaaj or ruchi ke bhi
 Linguistic burdens, stylistic miracles or ideological fanaticism have no place in anecdote
 sahaj-saral, muhaavareydaar or ravaanagi se bharpoor bhashaa hi kissagoi ke liye upyukt hoti he
 Passing this test is a challenge for every good story
 yah kissago kii apni style, rachanaatmakataa or prastutikaran ke kaushal par nirbhar karata he ki apane pathakon / shrotaaon ko kitna sammohit kar paata he
 The easy and opportunistic use of idioms and proverbs makes it popular and effective
 lekh ke is ansh main ham baalsahitya ke sandarbh main kissagoi kii upyogita kaa akalan karenge
 We will also try to find out why Kisagoi-dominated creations are more popular among children
 praayah sabhi samaaj langik aadhaar bhedbhaav ke shikaar rahe hai
 The art of kissing, however, has been popular among women and children alike
 kintu paristhitigat antar ke kaaran usamen kinchit bhinnata bhi rahi he
 Due to the dignity or extent of the chapel culture, young men, children and old people could go to the chapals
 parantu striyon or chote bacchon kaa vahaan janaa vibhinn kaarnon se nishiddh tha
 For this reason, the art of kissagoi developed equally in the homes, but with a slight variation
 donon main ek mukhya antar to yah rahaa ki chapaalon par jo kaam praayah daksh kissago athwa manje hue vyakti jo kahani sunaane kii kala main paarangat ho, dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time, this responsibility was taken up by the grandparents, maternal grandmother, aunt or any senior member of the family
 kisse-kahani ke madhyam se hi balak ko apni parampara, samskruti tathaa raajnneeti aadi kaa vyaavhaarik gyaan kara diya jaataa tha
 Anurag, who was born to an anecdote in childhood, used to take a person to the famous places of Kisagoi - such as the chayars, chapals and other such public places
 jabaki paristhatigat antar ke kaaran gharelu prastutiyaan praayah chote-chote kisson tak hi simit rah jaati thim
 Often the big stories recited on the chapals took the form of talk or talk in brief form
 haalanki unamem bhi kissagoi kaa jaadu puri tarah vidyaman rahata tha
 It can be said that along with the early teaching-rites, a keen psyche for kissing, affection and attraction towards him began to be born from the courtyard of the house, mother's lap, and through him, the child attempts to understand the outside world
 used to do
 kissagoi kaa hi kamaal he jiske kaaran beete jamaane main bina kisi prakaashan suvidha, sanchaar madhyamon ke bhi kahaniyaan dur-daraaj ke deshon tak kii yatra kar aati thim
 The entire folklore is indebted to the art of kissing
 kissagoi kii lokapriyata or pahanch ke kaaran hi panchatantra kii kahaniyaan aaj duniya-bhar ke sabhi deshon main na keval prachlit hai balki sthaneey ruchiyon or paramparaon ke anuroop unamem vyapak badlaav bhi hue hai
 The best example of this is the stories of Aesop, on which Panchatantra has full influence
 chhathi shatabdi pehle janma isap yun to yunaan kaa ek maamuli gulam tha
 Appearance ugly
 parantu uske prashansakon kii kami nahin thi
 He was respected in his society
 isliye ki vah apane shrotaaon ko spandit karne kii kala main daksh ek behtareen kissago tha
 He had mastered the policy and practical knowledge in telling stories
 apni kahaniyon main usne panchatantra kii un kahaniyon kaa bhi upyog kiya jo hajaaron mile kii yatra ke baad yunaan pahunchi thim
 The stories of Aesop continued to travel from one country to another through Shruti for almost seventeen centuries
 chini darshanik kanceyucious ne bhi janamanas ke bich apane vichaaron ke prachaar-prasar ke liye drushtaant parampara kaa sahaara liya tha
 There is one more example that illustrates the importance of kissing
 ek baddimag badshaah kaa kissa jo apane aap main behad mjedaar he or aaj bhi khub ras le-lekar suna-sunaaya jaataa he
 In it, the king who is fond of tales gets angry with the princess on something
 dand se pehle budhimaan shahzadi use kissa sunaanaa chaahati he
 The king is ready
 magar jaise hi ek kissa samaapt hone ko hota shahzadi badi chaturaai or kalaatmakataa se usamen doosraa kissa jod detii
 The night passed while listening to anecdote
 badshaah kisse main itnaa dub jaataa tha ki uskaa baaki hissaa agali raat main sunne ke liye shahzadi ko ek din or jeene kii mohalat de detaa
 In this way, the days went by
 antat badshaah us budhimaan shahzadi ko kshamaa kar detaa he
 This single episode is enough to gauge the strength of the story
 jabaki pratik rup main yah kissa baadshahon kii jeevanstyli or baddimagi par kataaksh bhi karata he
 The effort of the Grimm brothers to compile the folklore of Germany has been appreciated worldwide
 unke dwaara sankalit lokkathaayen jagatprasiddh ‘grimes feiri tels’ naamak granth main sankalit hai
 To gather stories, the Grimm brothers went from village to village and heard stories from elders
 isi silsile main ek behad rochak ghatana he jiskaa zikr kahaniyon ke sankalan ke dauraan ke apane anubhavon kaa ullekh ke rup main grim bandhu kuch is tarah karte hai ki


ek baar jab ve ek gaanv main pahunche to vahaan unhen ek chudail budhiya ke bare main bataaya gaya
 With whom the villagers were reluctant to send their children
 kisi ne unhen yah bhi jaankaree di ki us budhiya ke paas kahaniyon kaa beshumaar khajaana he
 But at the same time, he also told that he is a 'magician and witch'
 

chudail he jo bacchon par aisa jaadu karti he ki bachche raat main daraavne sapane dekhakar cheekhte-chillaate hai
 The Grimm brothers set out to search for stories
 isliye ve us budhiya ke paas pahanche or usase kahani sunaane kaa aagrah kiya
 In response, the old lady made a bet that she could tell the story only when the children are present there as a listener
 udhar gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko budhiya ke paas bhejne ko jaraa bhi taiyaar nahin the
 This posed a formidable problem to the Grimm brothers
 budhiya ziddee thi
 In the fascination of folklore, the Grimm brothers were also not ready to return disappointed
 antat grim bandhuon ne apane ek mitra kii madad lee
 He explained to the villagers
 unke bacchon kii suraksha kaa aashwaasan bhi diya
 Eventually, after much effort, the villagers agreed to send their children to the old lady
 varshon se gaanvvaalon kii pratadna kaa shikaar, gaanv se dur or akeli rahati ai budhiya kii ankhon main bacchon ko dekhte hi chamak aa gai
 She agreed to tell the story
 or phir budhiya ne jaise hi pehla kissa shuru kiya, bacchon samet grim-bandhu bhi mantra-mugdh ho gaye
 The art of telling his story was so amazing and exciting that everyone started forgetting his temper for a while
 kahani sunaate-sunaate, prasanganuroop kabhi vah sher kii bhaanti gurraane lagati to kabhi chidiyon kii tarah chahchahana shuru kar detii
 As soon as the cat is mentioned in the story, she immediately starts miaoning
 yahi nahin apni aawaaj se budhiya aandhi, barish, badalon ke gadgadane jaise vichitra dhvaniprabhav utpann karne main paarangat thi
 There was a magical effect in his story
 jitani der tak budhiya ne kahaniyaan sunaayi, ve sammohit se sunate rahe
 After that, the whole mystery came to the understanding of the Grimm brothers
 ghatana ke prabhavi prastutikaran dwaara budhiya aise jeevant bimb utpann karti thi ki bacchon ko kahani ke paatra tathaa ghatnaayen vaastavik-se lagane lagate or sidhe unke dilo-dimag main paith jate
 Their effect also lasted long
 jisase ve sapanom main dar jate
 The Grimm brothers have described this experience in detail
 ve likhte hai ki bacchon ko to hamane us budhiya ke saamne bitha diya or ham khud baraabar ke kamare main parde ke peeche ja baithe
 The old lady started telling stories and we started scripting them
 grim-bandhu likhte hai ki ‘budhiya jab kahani sunaane lagi to hamane anubhav kiya ki vah shaayad kahani sunaane kii kala main maahir duniya kii sarvshereshth kissago thi
 

it would create the sound effects of rain, thunderstorms, animals, birds etc
 from her mouth and make the story highly effective

 One thing can be said as an accusation that there is an excess of imagination in Kisagoi-dominated compositions

 All of Western Europe was religious in the early 16th century - all were Christians; All were members of the Roman Catholic Church; He believed in his traditional education and accepted his rule in religious matters, namely the rule of the Pope of Rome
 europea dharmasudhar athwa riformation 16veen shatabdi ke us mahaan andolan ko kehete hai jiske falswaroop paashchaatya isaayiyon kii yah ekta chhin-bhinn hui or protestant dharm kaa udai hua
 Reformist movements continued from time to time in the history of the church, but they did not challenge the religious principles of the church or its rulers, according to their instructions, to eliminate moral evils and promote religious education as their objective
 16veen shatabdi main jo sudhaar kaa andolan pravartit hua vah sheeghra hi carch kii paramparaagat shiksha or uske shaskaon ke adhikaar, donon kaa virodh karne laga
 As a result of the Reformation movement, Catholicism as well as Luther sect, Calvin sect, Anglican sect and Presbyterian sect became prevalent in Europe
 dharmasudhar kaa yah naveen swaroop samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti par vichaar karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 The sense of reverence that Christians have had for centuries for the Catholic Church promoted by Christ had been reduced for several reasons
 14veen shatabdi main ek francisi pope kaa chunaav hua tha, jo jivan bhar france main hi rahe
 As a result, for 40 years later two pope existed, one in France and one in Rome, dividing the entire Catholic world into two parts
 aathvin shatabdi main frank jati ke katholic raja ne italy par akraman karne vaali lonward sena ko haraakar italy kaa madhya bhaag pope ke adhikaar main de diya or is prakaar roman katholic carch ke parmadhikari dharmaguru ke atirikt ek saadhaaran shaasha bhi ban gaye
 For this reason, the kings of Germany and France instinctively tried to interfere in the affairs of the Church and especially in the election of the Pope
 14veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main yah chunaav italy ke abhijaat varg kii pratiyogita kaa maidan ban gaya tha jisase vyakti kii yogyata par kam, uske vansh par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga
 As a result, at that time, extremely inept pope was elected and morality and religion began to be neglected in the court of Rome
 at: rome ke carch ke prati shraddha kaa ghat janaa nitant swaabhaavik tha
 Another reason for dissatisfaction was that the institutions of the entire church were taxed according to their property and the representatives of Rome always wandered and collected this money
 carch ke kendriya sanghathan kii is durdasha ke atirikt vibhinn dharmapraanton kii paristhiti bhi santoshjanak nahin thi
 At this time, all of Western Europe was divided into about seven hundred religions
 unke shaasha bishap kehalaate the
 These bishops were feudatories who were often elected by the king from among the aristocracy, were members of the court, and were often the political rulers of their region in Germany
 at: bahut se bishap raajnneeti main adhik, dharm main kam ruchi lete the or apane dharmpradesh kaa dharmik prashasan vishvavidhyalay ke ucch adhikaar praapt purohiton ke haath main chhod dete the
 Most of the ordinary priestly settlers in the villages were semi-educated

 This pathetic condition of ordinary priests was the biggest weakness of the 16th century European Catholic Church
 bhraman karanevaale francisco aadi dharmasandhiyon ke atirikt jansadharan ko dharmik shiksha denevaala koi nahin tha
 Due to this, superstition was spread everywhere and rituals were given unnecessary and unbalanced importance
 13veen shatabdi main katholic dharmavigyaan ne arestu kii isai vyakhya tathaa scholastic philosophy ke sahare dharmasiddhanton kaa yuktiyukt pratipaadan kiya tha kintu 15veen shatabdi main dharm kii moolbhoot samasyaon par se dhyaan or chintan hat gaya tha
 In universities, piety had begun to give greater importance to their differences in the subject of secondary questions, which led to the devotion of Catholic theology so much that some believers became convinced that theology was an impediment to spiritual practice
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki carch ke sabhi kshetron main sudhaar kii apeksha thi or dharmasudhar kaa andolan anivaary ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, Angrez Wickliffe and later Bohimiya's Huss Jo started teaching that the organization of the church, its rites, etc
 are all inventions of humans; The Bible is sufficient for Christians
 us samay bhi un vichaaron ko adhik safalataa nahin mili kintu unka luther par prabhaav spasht hi he
 In Spain, Arbishop Simnes of Toledo introduced the Reforms movement within the discipline of the Church, which completely changed the atmosphere there, but there was no significant change in the Church's situation in Western Europe
 jab luther ne rome ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai unako ek or kaaran se apurv safalataa mili
 Along with the popularity of ancient Greek and Latin literature everywhere in Europe at that time, a new cultural movement started called Renaissance or Renaissance
 iske falswaroop logon main vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa bhav utpann hua
 Since the invention of printing, printed copies of the Bible were becoming more easily accessible from this time onwards, encouraging people to think about religion on their own and also the tendency to interpret the Bible as their own
 europea dharmasudhar kaa aitihaasik vikaas is prakaar he : iskaa aarambh 1517 i
 main luther ke vidroh se hua tha
 The circumstances under which he had started his movement and how he had started a new religion by opposing the traditional doctrines of the Church are described elsewhere in the encyclopedia
 us samay samast germany lagbhag chaar sau swatantraroop rajyon main vibhakt tha
 Most of their rulers protected Luther in opposition to the Catholic emperor Charles and merged his subjects into the Church of Luther
 sheeghra hi scandinavia ke samast isai bhi lutheran dharm main sammilit hue
 In Switzerland, the two leaders of the Reformation were the most prominent - the Gingli in Zurich and the Calvin in Geneva, both of whom later became followers of the same Calvinist church
 yah sampradaay holland, scotland tathaa france ke kuch bhaagon main bhi fail gaya
 In Scotland, it is named Presbyterian Religion
 In France, Luther first influenced but later most of the Protestant religious, called Eugenie, became followers of Calvin
 unka sanghathan ek raajnneetik dal ke rup main se bahut samay tak sakriy rahaa 
 The King of England had opposed Luther from the beginning
 unhone ek granth bhi likhaa tha jisamen unhone dharm ke maamalon main pope ke ishwardutt adhikaar kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Although Henry tried to stop propagating Protestant doctrines throughout his kingdom, he separated the Church of England from Rome in 1531 AD for personal reasons, thus the Anglican community was started
 henry ke uttaradhikariyon ke samay main us carch par protestant vichaardhaara kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa jisase aajkal vah protestant dharm kii teen pramukh shakhaon main se ek mana jaataa he kintu vastav main anglican samudaay kii utpatti, vikaas or prachaar kaa apana alag itihaas he 
 Apart from these three sects, the religion reform movement led to the emergence of many more Protestant religions which are unnecessary to mention here
 apekshaakrit adhik mahatv rakhanevaale sampradaayon kaa kinchit vivaran kosh main anyatra diya gaya he 
 It is clear from this overview that the reform movement, promoted by Luther, took various forms and shook all of Europe
 pranrabh main carch kaa sudhaar is andolan kaa uddeshy tha kintu vah sheeghra hi carch kii paramparaagat shiksha tathaa carch kii sanghathanaatmak ekta par prahaar karne laga
 The result of this is that the unity of the Christians of Europe has been severed for centuries

 From the political point of view, the result of the reform was very widespread
 europe kii uttaramadhyakaalin paristhiti aisi thi ki shaskaon ne bhi anivaary rup se is dharmik andolan main sakriy bhaag liya he
 They agreed to wage war with the aim of incorporating or retaining their subjects in their own religion

 It has been mentioned above that reform movements have been in place in the Catholic Church from time to time, but the Catholic Church was particularly inspired by the 16th century rebellious reform
 is shatabdi main pope ke rup main pratibhashali vyaktiyon kaa chunaav hua jinhone carch ke shashan main phir aadhyatm ko praathamikta dilaa di he jisase samast katholic sansar main pope kaa pad pun: purnroopen sammanit ho sakaa
 The feudalism of the bishops was abolished and the appointment of four more saintly persons led to the emergence of the ancient ideal of the bishop, who is the spiritual leader and spiritual shepherd of his subjects
 trent naamak nagar main carch kii 19veen vishwasabha kaa aayojan hua jisamen carch ke nae sanghathan ke atirikt vishesh rup main saadhaaran purohiton ke shikshan kaa prabandh kiya gaya
 Therefore, all the categories of the Church were reformed and religious education could be properly promoted among the masses
 is kaary main dharmasandhiyon ne duusare purohiton kaa haath bantaya he
 In the 16th century, many religious associations like the Jesuits were established and reforms were done in the ancient religions so that they could serve the religion according to the needs of all time
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki dharm sudhaar kaa sambhavat: sabase gaharaa evam hitkari prabhaav puraane kathilak carch par hi padaa
 Seeing the wide spread and deep impact of the reform of European religion, a question arises in our mind that what is the secret of this unprecedented success
 is safalataa ke anek kaarnon kii kalpana kii gai he : The pathetic condition of the Catholic Church in the early 15th century and the inaction of its masters, the aid of politicians eager to seize the property of the Church, the movement of personal freedom due to the Renaissance, new features of propaganda from the invention of printing
 yah sab aalochay andolan ke liye sahaayak siddh hua kintu isaki safalataa kaa rahasy anyatra dhoondhna chahie
 The promoters of Dharmasudhara were inspired by the sattvic and religious sentiments and were able to inculcate the ardent desire for religious renaissance among their talented colleagues
 inke vichaar main us navajagaran kaa ekmaatr upaay yah prathit hota tha ki manushya apane punya karmon par bharosa na rakhkar isa ke prati aatmasamarpan kare or bible main surakshit isa ke susamachar par vishwaas kare
 They made the Bible the basis of their movement, they have succeeded by the power contained in the Bible
 aajkal isai sansar main 16veen shatabdi kii ghatnaon par tatasth drushti se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Kathilak acknowledges the creative achievements of European Reformation and Protestants are beginning to understand that no matter how necessary it was to resist the then evils of the Church, Christianity has been greatly damaged by the disintegration of its unity

 Former reformers of Martin Luther raised their voice against the immorality, corruption, luxury, and exploitation of the Church and the papacy from the fourteenth century onwards and they set the background for religious reform

 Diversification is a kind of business strategy for a company
 yah nae utpaadon or nae bazaaron se praapt adhik se adhik bikri ke madhyam se munaafe ko badhanaa chaahati he
 Diversification can be either at the business unit level or at the corporate level
 At the business unit level, it has considerable scope for expansion into a new segment of an industry in which it already has business
 corporate str par yah saamanytah or maujuuda vyavsaayik ikai ke daayre ke baahar ek aakarshak vyavsaay main pravesh karnaa bhi bahut hi dilachasp hota he
 Diversification is part of four key marketing strategies defined by the Product / Market Ensoff Matrix: chitra:ansoff diversification
jpg Ensoff pointed out that the diversification strategy stands out from the three other strategies
 pehali teen ranneetiyaan mul utpaada kii pankti ke liye aam taur par ek hi takneekee, vittiya or bikri ke sansadhano kaa istemaal karti hai, jabaki vividhikaran ke liye saamanytah company ko nayi yogyataayen, nai takneekein or nai suvidhaayen jutaney kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Note: The notion of diversification depends on the subjective interpretation of the "new" product and the "new" market, reflecting the understanding of customers rather than managers
 In fact, products create or encourage new markets; New markets promote innovative products
 vividhikaran kii ranneetiyon main nae utpaadon yaa bazaaron kaa aantarik vikaas, kisi company kaa adhigrahan, kisi poorak company ke saath gathbandhan, nai praudyogikiyon kaa license dena or kisi anya farm dwaara nirmit utpaadon kii pankti kaa vitaran yaa aayaat karnaa shaamil ho saktaa he
 Generally, the final strategy is a combined form of these options
 yah sangyojan company ke uddeshyon or sansadhano ke saath uplabdh avasaron or sthirataa kii karypranali main nirdhaarit hota he
 There are three types of diversification: concentric, horizontal and collective: iskaa matlab yah he ki udyogon ke bich ek takneekee samanta he, jiskaa arth he ki company kuch laabh hasil karne ke liye apni takneekee visheshaitaaon kaa faaydaa uthaane main sakasham he
 For example, a company that produces industrial adhesives may make a diversified decision to sell these adhesives through retailers
 isamen praudyogiki ek hi ho sakati he lekin marketing sambandhi prayaason ko badalane kii jarurat hoti he
 It seems that it also increases its market share to introduce a new product which helps a particular company to make a profit
 haalanki, ek anya udhaaharan bhi he, food speshilities limited ke maujuuda "megi" brands kii sansaadhit samagriyon main tomato kechap or sos ko shaamil karnaa takanic-aadhaarit sankendrit vividhikaran kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The company adds new products or services that are either technically or commercially unrelated to existing products, but may attract existing customers
 ek pratispardhi maahaul main, is prakaar kaa vividhikaran us sthiti main vaanchhneeya hota he jab maujuuda graahakon ko maujuuda utpaadon par bharosa hota he or jab nae utpaadon kii gunvattta acchhee hoti he or unka prachaar-prasar evam mulya nirdhaaran acchhee tarah kiya jaataa he
 In addition, marketing of new products is done in the same economic environment as the existing products, which can generate persistence and volatility
 duusare shabdon main, is ranneeti se kuch vishesh market segmenton par company kii nirbharta bad jaati he
 For example, a company that used to make copies earlier is now entering the pen market through its new product
 kshaitij ekikaran tab hota he jab koi company apane vartmaan oparation kii tarah utpaadan ke ek hi charan main ek nae vyavsaay main pravesh karti he
 For example, Avon's decision to sell jewelry through its door-to-door sales personnel included a strategy for marketing new products through existing channels of distribution
 iskaa ek vaikalpik rup bhi evan dwaara apanaaya gaya jo mail order dwaara or khudara dukaanon ke madhyam se apane utpaadon ko bechnaa tha
 In both cases, Avon still exists at the retail level of the production process
 company aise nae utpaadon yaa sevaaon kii marketing karti he jinka maujuuda utpaadon ke saath koi takneekee yaa vyavsaayik saamanjasy nahin hota he, lekin jo graahakon ke nae samoohon ko aakarshith kar sakati he
 Collective diversification has little to do with the company's current business
 isliye, is tarah kii ranneeti ko apnaane kaa mukhya kaaran pehle to company kii laabhpradata or lacheelepan main sudhaar karnaa or doosraa jaise-jaise company badi hoti jaati he uske liye puunji bazaar main ek behatar sweekruti praapt karnaa he
 Even if this strategy is very risky, if successful, it can also increase progress and profitability
 calories or harvatopolos ke anusaar, vividhikaran ke auchity ke do aayam hai
 The first concerns the nature of a strategic objective: diversification can be defensive or aggressive
 rakshaatmak kaaran bazaar ke sankuchan ke jokhim ko badhaane vaale ho sakate hai, yaa us sthiti main vividhikaran ke liye majaboor kiya gaya ho saktaa he jab aisa lagata he maujuuda utpaada yaa bazaar kaa maujuuda rukh aage vikaas ke avasar pradaan nahin kar saktaa he
 Aggressive reasons can be new-age leads and new opportunities that promise far more profitability than expansion opportunities, or use cash that is protected from aggregate expansion needs
 Becomes more
 duusare aayam main vividhikaran ke apekshit parinaam shaamil hote hai: prabandhan atyadhik aarthik mulya yaa apni maujuuda gatividhiyon ke liye pehle or sarvapratham vyapak saamanjasy evam poorak kii apeksha kar saktaa he
 Furthermore, companies can only diversify for a valuable comparative study between this strategy and expansion
 vividhikaran insof matrix main prastut kii gayi chaar ranneetiyon main sabase adhik jokhimpurna he or iske liye sabase adhik saavdhaanee purvak jaanch-padtaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Landing in an unknown market with an unfamiliar product offering means lack of experience in terms of new qualifications and techniques required
 Thus, the company puts itself in a situation of great uncertainty
 iske alaava, vividhikaran ke liye maanav or vittiya sansadhano ke ek vyapak vistaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, jo mahatvapurn udyogon main kendrit dhyaan, patibaddhta or nirantar nivesh ke liye baadhak ban saktaa he
 Therefore any company should choose this option only if the current trend of the current product or market does not provide further opportunities for development
 Various tests can be done in order to measure the probability of failure: uparokt ullikhit ucchstareey jokhimon ke kaaran vividhikaran kaa prayaas karne vaali kai companiyaan ko vifaltaa haath lagi he
 However, some good examples of successful diversification also exist: rashtriya seva yojana raashtra kii yuvashakt ke vyaktitv vikaas hetu yuva kaarykram evam khel mantralay bharat sarkaar dwaara sanchalit ek sakriy kaarykram he
 The students participating in its activities work with the people of the society in the interest of the society
 sakshartaa sambandhi kaary, paryaavaran suraksha, swasthya evam safai apatkaaleen yaa prakritik aapadaa ke samay pidit logon kii sahaayta aadi
 By virtue of the social work from the student's life, the qualities of social service or national service are developed in them
