 Before death, Akbar made the capital back to Agra in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 agra shahar kaa nayaa naam diya gaya akbarabad jo samrajya kii sabase bada shahar bana
 The main part of the city was situated on the western bank of river Yamuna
 yahaan barsaat ke pani kii nikasi kii acchhee naaliyaan-naalon se paripurna vayavastha banaayi gai
 a new sandstone wall was built in 1565 by breaking the old boundary wall of the mortar-built city built by the Lodhi Empire
 angrez itihaaskaar yugal blair evam bloom ke anusaar is laal diwaar ke kaaran hi iskaa naam laal kila padaa
 He further writes that this fort was made somewhat semicircular on the map of the previous fort
 shahar kii ore se ise ek dohari suraksha diwaar ghere he, jiske baahar gahari khai bani he
 This double wall has Delhi Gate in the north and Amar Singh Gate in the south
 ye donon dwaar apane dhanushakar mehrab-rupi aalon va burjon tathaa laal va safed sangmarmar par neeli glemud tilon dwaara alankaran se hi pahachaane jate hai
 The present fort is built by Shah Jahan, grandson of Akbar
 isamen dakshini ore jahangiri mahal or akbar mahal hai
 Raj Bharmal, the Kachhwaha Rajput of Amber, entered Akbar's court shortly after taking over his kingdom
 inhone apni rajkumaari harkhaa bai kaa vivaah akbar se karwaanaa sweekaar kiya
 Jodha Bai shehzade Salim ke janm ke pashchaat called Maryam-uz-zamani
 uski mrityu 1623 main hui thi
 a mosque was built in Lahore in his honor by his son Jahangir
 bhaarmal ko akbar ke darbar main ooncha sthaan mila tha or uske baad uske putr bhagwant das or pautra maansingh bhi darbar ke oonche samant bane rahe
 The episodes of Hindu princesses getting married to Muslim kings took place long before Akbar, but after most marriages the two families did not have good relations and neither did the princesses ever return home
 haalanki akbar ne is maamle ko pichley prakarnon se alag rup diya, jahaan un raniyon ke bhaaiyon yaa pitaaon ko putriyon yaa bahanon ke vivahoparaant akbar ke muslim sasuraal waalon jaisaa hi sammaan mila karata tha, sivaay unke sang khaanaa khaane or prarthana karne ke
 Those Rajputs found good places in Akbar's court
 sabhi ne unhen vaise hi apanaaya tha sivaay kuch roodhiwaadee pariwaron ko chhodkar, jinhone ise apmaan ke rup main dekha tha
 Other Rajpur princely states also formed marital relations with Akbar, but there was no condition for marriage
 do pramukh rajput vansh, mewarh ke shishodiya or ranthambor ke hadha vansh in sambandhon se sadaa hi hatate rahe
 Raja Mansingh, a well-known courtier of Akbar, also took an affidavit from Akbar to Surjan Hodha, a Hadha king, whom Surjan Singh accepted on the condition that he would not marry any of his daughters with Akbar
 antatah koi vaivaahik sambandh nahin hue kintu surjan ko garh-katang kaa adhibhaar saunp kar sammanit kiya gaya
 Many other Rajput feudals also did not like to give daughters of their kings to the Mughals in the name of marriage
 garh sivaan ke rathore kalyandas ne motaa raja raav udaisingh or jahangir ko maarane kii dhamkee bhi di thi, kyonki udaisingh ne apni putree jodhabai kaa vivaah akbar ke putr jahangir se karne kaa nishchay kiya tha
 Akbar, having this knowledge, sent the royal forces to attack Kalyanadasa
 kalyandas us sena ke sang yuddh main kaam aayaa or uski striyon ne johar kar liya
 The political impact of these relations was significant
 haalanki kuch rajput striyon ne akbar ke haram main pravesh lene par islam sweekaar kiya, phir bhi unhen purna dharmik swatantraaa thi, saath hi unke sage-sambandhiyon ko jo hindu hi the; darbar main ucch-sthaan bhi mili the
 Through them, the sound of the masses reached Akbar's court
 darbar ke hindu or muslim darbariyon ke bich sampark badhane se aapasi vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan hua or donon dharmon main sambhaav kii pragati hui
 This led to the confluence of the two bloods in the next generation, which also promoted harmony between the two sects
 parinamswaroop rajput mughalon ke sarvaadhik shaktishaalee sahaayak bane, rajput sainyadhikariyon ne mughal sena main rahakar anek yuddh kiye tathaa jite
 Among them was the 1572 campaign of Gujarat
 akbar kii dharmik sahishnutaa kii niti ne shahi prashasan main sabhi ke liye naukariyon or rojgaar ke avasar khol diye the
 Due to this, the administration became stronger
 tatkaaleen samaaj main veshyavriti ko samraat kaa sangrakshan pradaan tha
 He had a huge harem in which there were many women
 inamen adhikansh striyon ko balpurvak apahrit karvaa kar vahaan rakhaa hua tha
 Sati was also in full swing at that time
 tab kaha jaataa he ki akbar ke kuch log jis sundar stri ko sati hote dekhte the, balpurvak jaakar sati hone se roak dete va use samraat kii ajna bataate tathaa us stri ko haram main daal diya jaataa tha
 However, the court historians have said this case in some way that the King Salamat thus opposed the practice of Sati and gave protection to those Abla women
 apni jeevani main akbar ne swayan likhaa he– yadi mujhe pehle hi yah budhimatta jaagrit ho jaati to main apni sultanate kii kisi bhi stri kaa apharan kar apane haram main nahin laata
 It is clear from this that he used to kidnap the beauties
 iske alaava apharan na karwaane vaali baat kii nirarthakta bhi is tathy se gyaat hoti he ki na to akbar ke samay main or na hi uske utraadhikario ke samay main haram band hui thi
 According to Ain Akbari, Abdul Qadir Badauni says that wagons, nobles, wives of courtiers or other women whenever they wish to appear in the service of the emperor have to first give notice of their wish and wait for an answer; Those who are considered eligible are allowed to enter the harem
 akbar apni praja ko baadhya kiya karata tha kii vah apane ghar kii striyon kaa nagn pradarshan samuhik rup se yojit kare jise akbar ne khudaaroj naam diya hua tha
 Akbar's only purpose behind this celebration was to choose beauties for his harem
 
 Rani Durgavati of Gondwana also had Akbar's vision
 usne rani ko praapt karne ke liye uske rajya par akraman kar diya
 During the war, Veerangana realized that there was an attempt to capture him rather than kill him, so he committed suicide there
 tab akbar ne uski bahan or putrabadhu ko balpurvak apane haram main daal diya
 Akbar also practiced the practice that his defeated enemies send selected women from his family and hostess to his harem
 1556 main akbar ke gaddi lene ke samay, portugaliyon ne mahadweep ke pashchimi tat par bahut se durg va nirmaaniyan laga lee thim or bade str par us kshetra main nauvahan or sagariya vyapaar niyantrit karne lage the
 Due to this colonialism, all other merchant institutions were taught to remain impatient with the terms of the Portuguese, to which the rulers and traders of that time had begun to object
 mughal samrajya ne akbar ke rajtilak ke baad pehla nishaanaa gujarat ko banaaya or sagar tat par pratham vijay paayi 1572 main, kintu portugaliyon kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pehle kuch varshon tak unase maatr faras kii khadi kshetra main yatra karne hetu kartaaz naamak paas liye jate rahe
 At the time of the acquisition of Surat in 1572, the Mughals and the Portuguese first met and the Portuguese perceived the real power of the Mughals and consequently thought it appropriate to act on policy rather than war, and the Portuguese governor, upon Akbar's instructions, gave him a treaty by an ambassador
 Sent proposal akbar ne us kshetra se apane haram ke va anya muslim logon dwaara makka ko haj kii yatra ko surakshit karne kii drushti se prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 In 1573, Akbar issued a decree to the administrative officials of Gujarat, ordering the Portuguese to be allowed to live peacefully in nearby Daman
 iske badale main portugaliyon ne akbar ke parivaar ke liye haj ko jane hetu paas jari kiye the
 In 1576, Akbar sent a large group of Hajis, including several members of his harem, under the leadership of Yahya Saleh to Haj
 ye jattha do poton main surat se jeddah bandargah par 1577 main pahunchaa or makka or madina ko agrasar hua
 Between 1577 and 1580, four more caravans left for Hajj, with which there were gifts for the people of Mecca and Medina and Sadak for the poor
 ye yatri samaaj ke aarthik rup se nichle varg ke the or inke jane se un shaharon par aarthik bhaar badha
 Then the Ottoman administration requested them to return home, on which the women of the harem were not ready
 kaaphi vivaad ke baad unhen vivash hokar lautnaa padhaa
 The Governor of Aden was enraged at the large number of travelers who arrived in 1580 and insulted the Mughals as much as possible while returning
 in prakarnon ke kaaran akbar ko hajiyon kii yatraaon par roak lagaani padi
 After 1584 Akbar planned to ascend the port of Aden, subordinate to the Kingdom of Yemen, with the help of the Portuguese
 portugaliyon se is bare main yojana banane hetu ek mughal doot goa main aktubar 1584 se sthaayee rup se tainaat kiya gaya
 In 1587 a Portuguese contingent also invaded Yemen but suffered defeat by the Ottoman navy
 iske baad mughal-portugali gathbandhan ko bhi dhakka pahunchaa kyonki mughal jagiradaaron dwaara janzira main portugaliyon par lagaataar dabaav daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Akbar was a Muslim, but he also had respect for other religions and sects
 jaise-jaise akbar kii aayu badati gai vaise-vaise uski dharm ke prati ruchi badhane lagi
 He is particularly known for his fondness for Hinduism
 usne apane purvajo se vipareet kai hindu rajkumariyon se shaadi kii
 Apart from this, Akbar also held Hindus in various princely positions in his state, which was not done by any former Muslim ruler
 vah yah jaan gaya tha ki bharat main lambe samay tak raaj karne ke liye use yahan ke mul nivaasiyon ko uchit evam barabari kaa sthaan dena chaiye
 The Jiziya on Hindus was removed by Akbar in 1562, but had to be withdrawn in 1575 due to opposition from Muslim leaders, although he later withdrew policyfully
 jazia kar garib hinduon ko garibi se vivash hokar islam kii sharan lene ke liye lagaaya jaataa tha
 It was not imposed on Muslim people
 is kar ke kaaran bahut si garib hindu jansankhya par boj padataa tha, jisase vivash ho kar ve islam kabool kar liya karte the
 Firoz Shah Tughlaq has described how Islam was spread by Jizya
 akbar dwaara jazia or hindu tirthon par lage kar hataane ke samayik nirnyon kaa hinduon par kuch khaas prabhaav nahin padaa, kyonki isse unhen kuch khaas laabh nahin hua, kyonki ye kuch antaraal baad waapas laga die gaye
 Akbar had converted many Hindus to Islam against his will, in addition to this, he also converted the names of many Hindu pilgrimage places, such as Prayag to Allahabad in 1583
 akbar ke shasankaal main hi uske ek sipahasaalar hossain khan tukriya ne hinduon ko balpurvak bhedbhaav darshak bille unke kandhon or baahon par lagane ko vivash kiya tha
 There is a legend about the Jwalamukhi temple
 yah 1542 se 1605 ke madhya kaa hi hoga tabhi akbar dilli kaa raja tha
 The meditated mother was the ultimate devotee of Jotawali
 ek baar devi ke darshan ke liye vah apane gaanvvaasiyo ke saath jwalaji ke liye niklaa
 When his convoy passed through Delhi, the Mughal Emperor Akbar's soldiers stopped him and presented him in the court of King Akbar
 akbar ne jab dhyanu se poocha ki vah apane gaanvvaasiyon ke saath kahaan ja rahaa he to uttar main dhyanu ne kaha vah jotavaali ke darshano ke liye ja rahe he
 Akbar said what strength does your mother have? And what can she do? Then Dhyanu said that she is going to protect the whole world
 aisa koi bhi kaary nahi he jo vah nahin kar sakati he
 Akbar cut the head of the horse of Dhyanu and said that if your mother has power, then add the head of the horse and make it alive
 yah vachan sunakar dhyanu devi kii stuti karne laga or apana sir kaat kar mata ko bhet ke rup main pradaan kiya
 The head of the horse was joined by the power of mother
 is prakaar akbar ko devi kii shakti kaa ehsaas hua
 Emperor Akbar also offered a gold umbrella in the temple of the goddess
 kintu uske man me abhimaan ho gaya ki wo sone kaa chhatra chadhaane laayaa he, to mata ne uske haath se chhatra ko girava diya or use ek ajeeb dhaatu kaa bana diya jo aaj tak ek rahasy he
 This canopy is still present in the temple
 itihaaskaar dasharath sharma bataate hai, ki ham akbar ko uske darbar ke itihaas or varnanon jaise akbarnama, aadi ke anusaar mahaan kehete hai
 If one looks at other notable works, such as Dalpat Vilas, then it will become clear how abusive Akbar used to treat his Hindu feudatories
 akbar ke navratna raja maansingh dwaara vishwanath mandir ke nirmaan ko akbar kii anumati ke baad kiye jane ke kaaran hinduon ne us mandir main jane kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 The reason was clear, that Raja Mansingh's family had marital relations with Akbar
 akbar ke hindu samant uski anumati ke bagaiyr mandir nirmaan tak nahin kara sakate the
 When King Mansingh started construction of a temple in Bengal without permission, Akbar stopped it when he came to know and in 1595 ordered him to convert it into a mosque
 akbar ke liye aakrosh kii had ek ghatana se pataa chalati he
 Raja Ram, a leader of Hindu peasants, attempted to rob Akbar's tomb, Sikandra, Agra, which was thwarted by the local faujdar, Mir Abul Fazal
 iske kuch hi samay baad 1688 main raja ram sikandra main dobaaraa prakat hua or shysta khan ke aane main vilamb kaa phayda uthaate hue, usne makbare par dobaaraa send lagaai or bahut se bahumoolya saamaan, jaise sone, chaandi, bahumoolya kaaleen, chiraag, ityadi lut liye, tathaa jo le ja nahin sakaa, unhen barbaad kar gaya
 King Rama and his men dug out and burnt the asbestos of Akbar, which was a subject of utter humiliation for the Muslims
 baad ke varshon main akbar ko anya dharmon ke prati bhi aakarshan hua
 Akbar's attachment to Hinduism was not only to solidify the Mughal Empire, but he had a personal interest in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke alaava akbar ko shiya islam evam isai dharm main bhi ruchi thi
 He once called a Portuguese evangelist from Goa to learn the fundamental principles of Christianity
 akbar ne darbar main ek vishesh jagah banavaai thi jise ibaadat-khaanaa kaha jaataa tha, jahaan vah vibhinn dharmaguruon evam prachaarkon se dharmik charchaaen kiya karata tha
 His exploration of other religions was unbearable for some Muslim fundamentalists
 unhe lagane laga tha ki akbar apane dharm se bhatak rahaa he
 There was some truth in these things as well, Akbar sometimes took some decisions out of orthodox Islam, even in 1582 he started a new sect called din-i-ilahi i
e
 the religion of God
 deen-e-ilaahi naam se akbar ne 1582 main ek nayaa dharm banaaya jisamen sabhi dharmo ke mul tatwon ko daalaa, isame pramukhtah hindu evam islam dharm the
 Apart from these, the basic ideas of Parsi, Jain and Christianity were also included
 haalanki is dharm ke prachaar ke liye usne kuch adhik udyog nahin kiye keval apane vishwast logo ko hi isame sammilit kiya
 It is said that apart from Akbar, only King Birbal was a follower till his death
 dabestan-e-majahab ke anusaar akbar ke pashchaat keval 19 logo ne is dharm ko apanaaya
 Later, Akbar composed a new almanac in which he started a divine era which began on the day of his coronation
 usne tatkaaleen sikkon ke peeche ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ likhvaya jo anekaarthi shabd tha
 Akbar literally means "great" and the words "allah-o-akbar" could have two meanings "allah is great" or "akbar is Allah"
 deen-e-ilaahi sahi mino main dharm na hokar ek aachaar samhita ke samaan tha
 In this, indulgence, pride, slander or blaming were forbidden and were called sins
 dayaa, vichaarsheelataa or sanyam iske aadhaar stambh the
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 Despite being illiterate, Akbar had a special love for artists and intellectuals
 uske isi prem ke kaaran akbar ke darbar main nau ati gunwan darbari the jinhen akbar ke navratna ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Akbar's personality has been much talked about

 julius ko pope kaa padonnati karne ke baad, pope ke bhai ne inokenzo del monte parivaar main apanaaya or, julius ne tab tatkaal cardinal-bhattije banaaya
 Julius performed his favorites with the likes of Mont saint-michel in Montona and the Saint saint-michel in Verona, and later, the Abbesses of Saint Saba, Mirmundo, Grottafratata and Frascati as well

 No Buddhism says anything about abortion
 paaramparik strot, jaise buddha math kaa samhita ke anusaar jivan kii shuruuaat garbhadhaaran se hoti he jo garbhpaat karne par vah samaapt ho jaataa he jise jivan kaa jaanboojhkar vinaash kaha ja saktaa he or isse bachanaa chahie
 Most Buddhists also agree with this
 iskaa adhik gaharaai se adhyayan karne par gyaat hota he ki "jivan pratyaksh praarambhik bindu rahit ek nirantarata he"
 According to the Dalai Lama, abortion is a "negative" trend but there are exceptions
 unhone bataaya, "meraa anumaan he ki garbhpaat prayek paristhiti ke anusaar sweekrut yaa asweekrut kiya janaa chahie"
 There are different views regarding abortion in Christianity
 kuch buddhijiviyon kaa puraane isai vichaaron se virodh he to kuch log aaj bhi yah maanate hai ki garbhpaat karnaa athwa karwaanaa kisi jivit vyakti kii hatya ke samaan hi he
 According to mythological Hindu texts, abortion is strongly considered a crime
 bibisi ke anusaar, "jab garbhpaat ke bare main baat hot to, hindu vidhi main uskaa chunaav kiya jaataa he jisamen shaamil yatha: mata-pita bhrun or samudaay ko kam se kam nuksaan ho
 "according to the BBC," although in practice abortion is prevalent in India's Hindu civilization, as religious restrictions on abortion are sometimes violated due to cultural preference for sons
 iske tahat ladki ko janm se purv hi garbhpaat ke madhyam se hataa diya jaataa he or ise kanya bhrun hatya athwa maadaa bhrun hatya kaha jaataa he
 "hindu scholars and advocates of women's rights are in favor of prohibiting gender-based abortion
 kuch hindu dharamshastriyon or brahmakumari kaa vishwaas he ki bhrun kaa vyakti teen maheene main shuru hota he or iskaa vikaas garbhavastha ke paanch maah main hota he
 Possibly abortion should be allowed for a third month, and a subsequent abortion is akin to the destruction of a soul-acquired body
 yadhyapi islam vidwaanon main is sambandh main matyakya nahin he ki kab jivan armbh hota he or kab garbhpaat ki anumati di ja sakati he, adhiktar ke anusaar garbhadhaaran ke 120 din baad – vah samay jab islam ke anusaar bhrun kaa ek jivit aatma ke rup main hone lagata he, isko samaapt karnaa – pratibandhit he
 According to some Islamic thinkers, abortion should be allowed only in the first four months of conception when the mother's life is in danger or there is a case of rape
 paramparanishth yahudee garbhpaat kii anumati kii shiksha keval us avasthaa main dete hai jab jaccha kaa jivan khatre main ho
 While reformist, reconstructionist and conservative movements openly advocated for the right to safe and accessible abortion, traditionalist movements did not appear to be unified on the issue

 Despite this theoretical view, abortion is not uncommon in Sikh communities in India, where female feticide occurs due to the overemphasis of sons in male dominated society and cultural choice

 nirvana kaa shabdic arth he - 'buja hua' 
 But it has special meaning in Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic religion
 shraman vichaardhaara main pidaa yaa du:kha se mukti paane kii sthiti he
 "nibbana" in Pali means "to attain salvation" - that is, freedom from the fire of greed, hatred and confusion
 yah buddha dharm kaa param satya he or jain dharm kaa mukhya siddhant
 Part of the category of yadhyapi 'mukti' ke arth main nirvana shabd kaa prayog gita, bhagwat, raghuvansh, sharirak bhashya ityadi nae-puraane granthon main miltaa he, tathaapi yah shabd baudhon kaa paribhaashik he
 In Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta, the words Moksha, Upvarga, Dishayarayas, Mukti or Swargapriya and Kaivalya have been treated, but in Buddhist philosophy only the word Nirvana has come and is specifically interpreted
 buddha dharm kii do pradhan shakhaayen hai—hinayan or mahayan 
 Of these, all the texts of the Hinayana branch are in Pali language and represent the original form of Buddhism
 mahayan shakha kuch peeche kii he or uske sab granth saskrit main likhe gaye hai
 In the Mahayana branch itself, Buddhist doctrines have been represented philosophically by the esoteric logic by many masters
 pracheen kaal main vaidic aacharyon kaa jin buddha aacharyon se shastrarth hota tha ve praayah mahayan shakha ke the
 Therefore, what is meant by the word Nirvana can be decided by his words
 bodhisattva nagarjun ne madhyamik sutara main likhaa he ki 'bhavasantati kaa uchchhed hi nirvana he', arthath apane sanskaron dwaara ham baar baar janm ke bandhan main padate hai isse unke uchchhed dwaara bhavabandhan kaa naash ho saktaa he
 In the Ratnakootasutra, Buddha says: Nirvana is caused by the loss of raga, malice and attachment
 bajrachchhedika main buddha ne kaha he ki nirvana anupadhi he, usamen koi sanskaar nahin rah jaataa
 In relation to Nirvana, the secondary author Chandrakirti has said that the omnipresence of omnipresence is called nirvana
 yah shoonyata yaa nirvana kya he ! na ise bhav kah sakate hai, na abhaav
 Because the loss of knowledge of both emotion and absence is the name of Nirvana, which is beyond and beyond both the non-sense and the non-sense
 madhavacharya ne bhi apane sarvadarshansangrah main shoonyata kaa yahi abhipraay batalaaya he—'asti, naasti, ubhay or anubhay is chatushkoti se vinimunkti hi shoonyatv he'
 In the Secondary Sutra, Nagarjuna has said that the experience of existence and nostalgia is undesirable
 budhimaan log in donon kaa apshamrup kalyaan praapt karte hai
 It is clear from the appropriate sentences that there is no receptive relation of mind to the emptiness of the word nirvana
 mai bhi mithyaa, sansar bhi mithyaa
 One thing to note is that Buddhist philosophers do not believe in nature or even the nature of the soul
 ve ek mahashunya ke atirikt or kuch nahin maanate
 Part of the category of buddha ne nirvana ko man kii us param shanti ke rup main varnit kiya jo trishna, krodh or duusari vishaadakaari man:sthitiyon se pare he
 a creature who has found peace in life, who has compassion for all and who has abandoned all desires and shackles
 This peace is attained only when all the present desires cease and the desires that may arise in the future are destroyed
 In nirvana, due to craving and malice, they are eliminated from the root, leaving man from all kinds of sufferings or the cycle of rebirth in the world
 paali ke siddhanton main nirvana ke duusare drushtikon bhi hai; ek ke anusaar ye usee tarah he jaise kisi bhi tathy main riktatako dhundhna
 saath hi ise chetana kii sampurna punarvyavastha or chetan kii paraten kholane kii tarah bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Scholar Herbert Geanter states that nirvana makes "ideal personality, true human being" a reality
 dhammapad main buddha kehete hai ki nirvana hi "param anand" he
 This bliss is everlasting and paramount which is an integral part of the peace that comes from enlightenment or bodhi
 yah anand nashwar vastuon kii khushi se ekadam alag hoti he
 Knowledge associated with nirvana is expressed through the word Bodhi
 buddha nirvana kii vyakhya ko "sahaj" man ke rup main karte hai
 a mind that has reached a state of complete clarity and comprehensibility due to the end of desires
 buddha ne iskaa varnan "mrityuhinata" ) tathaa param aadhyatmik gyaan, jo vah sahaj parinaam he jo sadaachari jivan vyateet karne or shreshth aath-sutreey adarsh path par chalane par miltaa he ke rup main kiya he
 From such a life is made of the treaty of karma and vaana
 nir kaa arth he "alag hona, dur hona yaa uske bina" or wan kaa arth he "mukti" jaise "bahati hawa" or "soonghnaa, ityadi"
 The Abhidharma-mahavibhasha-shastra, which is an all-round idea, describes all possible meanings of the word originating from Sanskrit: sutron main nirvana ko kabhi bhi ek sthaan ke rup main nahin mana gaya he, balki ise sansar kaa hi virodhabhas mana gaya he, jo vastav main agyanta kaa paryaay he
 
 Having said: nirvana kaa sateek arth he- gyaan kii prapti- jo man kii pahchaan ko khatm karke mul tathy se judaav paidaa karata he
 Theoretically, Nibbāna is said to be a mind that is "not coming and not going" and has attained a state of perpetuity, leading to "liberation"
 sthirataa, sheetaltaa or shanti bhi iske arth hai
 The attainment of nirvana is compared to the end of avidya
 jisase us man:sthiti kii ichha jaagrit hoti he jo jivan chakra se mukti dilaati he
 The world is basically a product of craving and ignorance
 a person can attain Nirvana even without death
 jab nirvana praapt kar chuke vyakti kii mrityu hoti he, to us mrityu ko moksh ] kehete hai, kyonki vah jivan-maran or punarjanm ke aakhri judaav se purna rup se chhot jaataa he or uskaa phir se janm nahin hota
 buddha dharm sansaarik astitv ke ant ko param lakshya maanata he or yahi nirvana kii prapti he; aise vyakti kii mrityu ke pashchaat kya hota he,parinirvāṇa ye samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa, kyonki ye anubhav manushya kii samaj kii seemaa se pare he
 Through a series of questions, Shariputta convinced a monk that Tathagata could not be considered true or reality even in his present life, so it would not be right to speculate on the situation after the death of Arhant
 See Tathagata # Inscrutable ek str kaa gyaan praapt karne ke baad vyakti nirvana ko maansik chetana kii tarah anubhav karata he
 According to some beliefs, if one goes on the path of Nibbana, it leads the Arahant towards the attainment of enlightenment and samadhi
 ant:karan ke vikaas se is sthiti par pahunchane par yadi yogi ko ye pataa chalata he ki ye sthiti banaavati he or isliye nashwar he, to sabhi bandhan khatm ho jate hai, vyakti arhant ban jaataa he or nibbaan kii prapti hoti he
 The mind is aware; It is conscious
 nirvana se chetana khulti he or man is asahaj vishwa ke sabhi bandhanon se mukt hokar jaagruk hota he
 The Buddha has described this in many ways
 inamen se ek is prakaar he: Consciousness is formless, it has no end and it is stunning from all sides
 ajaan pasanno or ajaan amaaro likhte hai ki vigyaan shabd chetan kii gunvattta ke sandarbh main dekha jaataa he
 According to him "vinānāna" should be understood more than its literal meaning: "buddha, like many philosophers equivalent to him, used the language understood by the common people in a larger scope, rather than the pretentiousness and hypocrisy of learning, which made his The message can be understood as much as possible
 So 'knowledge' can be taken here in the sense of 'knowing', but not partial broken, discriminatory knowing, which usually means Interpretation is
 balki iskaa arth hona chahie praarambhik or utkrisht gyaan, nahin to jis sandarbh main isaki baat ho rahi he, vahaan virodhabhas dikhaai degaa
" phir unhone aage bataaya ki in shabdon ke chayan ke peeche kya kaaran rahaa hoga
 ye "aprakat chetana" chah indriyon kii chetana se bhinn he, baaki chetnaaon kii ek "sataha" hoti he, jinaki vajah se pratikriya utpann hoti he
 According to Peter Harvey, ancient texts have two opinions on the issue of whether the word "conscious" is accurate or not
 a liberated person experiences it spontaneously
 ek vyakhya ke anusaar, "prakashwan chetan" nirvana ke samaan he
 Others do not agree with this, according to him, it is not nirvana, but it is a kind of consciousness that only the arhants attain
 majzima nikaay main ise rikt sthaan kii tarah bataaya gaya he
 For the liberated people, there is no need for the meditation of light consciousness, mental consciousness associated with Nibbana, and it is superior to all parts of mental consciousness
 yah buddha purv ke upanishdaur bhagavadgitake atmagyaan kii avadharana se purnat: bhinn he, jo vyakti kii antarman kii chetana ko jagaane kii baat karte hai, jabaki isamen is pahalu par jor nahin diya gaya he or isamen kisi bhi tarah "swa" se bhramit nahin hona chahie
 iske alaava, buddha ke chathe dhyaanake anusaar, ye aseemit chetana ke kshetra main utkrisht hota he, jo swayan "main" ke mithyabhimaan par samaapt nahin hota
 Nagarjuna has also hinted at two places on the level of consciousness in Dignikaya
 unhone likhaa he: The monk declared that earth, water, fire and air, long, short, fine and hard, good, etc
 are all extinguished in consciousness
 

 yahaan lanbaa or chota, maheen or sakht, acha or bura ye sabhi naam or rup samaapt ho jate hai
 The idea associated with this, which is supported in Pali theory and contemporary Theravada, while it is not mentioned in Theravada Bhashya and Abhidhamma, states that the mind of the Arahant is Nibbana
 mahayanabuddha dharm main, nirvana or sansar ko jab dharmakayaki param prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he, to ye donon pruthak-pruthak nahin hai
 a person can attain Nirvana through the Buddhist path
 agar ye donon ekadam alag hote to aisa sambhav nahin hota
 yani nirvana or sansar kaa dwaitvaad paaramparik taur par hi sateek he
 Another way to arrive at this conclusion is the analysis that all facts are empty of an essential identity, so suffering is not congenital under any circumstances
 Therefore, freedom from grief and its causes is not a non-material process
 is vichaar kii or vyakhya ke liye dwisatya siddhant ko dekhen
 Theravadmat indicates the mutual contradiction between the world and Nibbana, where the quest for liberation begins
 saath hi, yahi virodhabhas param lakshya kii ore bhi le jaataa he, jo vastav main sansar main utkrisht hona or nibbaan ke raste mukti kii prapti he
 Theravada is in many ways different from the Mahayana doctrine, which itself begins with the dualism of the world and nirvana, showing this polarization not just as an initial text, but it leads to a larger experience of monotheism
 
 paali sutara ke drushtikon se buddha or arhant kii pidaaen or tehraav, yani sansar or nibbaan pruthak-pruthak hai
 Both views agree that Shakya Muni Buddha attained nirvana while living in this world, as he was seen by all to be free from the world

 I, v
 6, buddhaghosh ne nirvana ke path ke liye paali siddhant main kai vikalp dikhaae hai, jinamein shaamil hai: On the basis of one's analysis, all these options reflect the three-point teaching of the Buddha's stated qualities, mental development and knowledge
 nirvana ko vishuddh, gaiyr dwaitvaadi 'utkrisht man' kii tarah dikhaane kaa vichaar mahayan / tantric granthon main bhi miltaa he
 Samput, for example, describes: 'vaasana or bhaavnaatmak dosha se rikt, jis par dwaitvaadi drushtikon ke badal na hon, aisa utkrisht man hi vastav main param nirvana he
 ' kuch mahayan paramparaon ke anusaar buddha ko marichika main dekhte hai, jisamen pratyaksh dikhne vaale ko nirvana kii sthiti se upar uthne kii tarah dikhaaya he
 According to Professor Etienne Lamote, the Buddha is always and at all times in nirvana and his physical body and form on earth is actually elusive
 lamote buddha ke bare main likhte hai:'unka janm hua, wo sambodhi ko praapt hue, unhone dharm chakra ko chalaaya or nirvana kii prapti kii
 haalanki ye sab bhram he: buddha ke prakatya main aane, thaharne or jane kii avasthaaon kaa lop he; unke nirvana ye darshaate hai ki wo hameshaa or har samay nirvana kii sthiti main rahete hai
 ' kuch mahayan sutara aage jaakar nirvana kii prakruti kii visheshtaayen bataane kaa praytn karte hai
 The main themes of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which is basically the boundary or metal of nirvana, discusses the four essential components from which Buddha creates nirvana
 jinamein se ek he 'swa', jise buddha ke sthaayee swayan ke rup main vishleshit kiya jaataa he
 William Edward Suthill and Louis Hods, explaining Nirvana on the basis of Mahayana, say: 'nirvana sutara ye daawa karte hai ki pracheen vichaar jaise sthayitv, paramanand, vyaktitv, shuddhta hi utkrisht nirvana kii ore le jate hai
 The Mahayana declares that Hinayana, denying that there is no personality in the transcendental realm, in fact denies the existence of Buddha
 mahayan main, antim nirvana utkrisht he or ise paramaki sangya di gai he
 ' jab ye shaastra likhaa gaya, tab pehle se hi nirvana or buddha ke bare main kaaphi sakaaratmak baaten kahi ja chuki thim
 According to the initial idea of buddhism, nirvana is characterized by stability, joy and purity
 use "main hum" kii mudra kaa pratikaar karte hue dikhaaya gaya he or ye swabhranti kii sabhi sambhaavnaaon se pare he
 The Mahaparinirvana Sutra, a long and large scripture of Mahayana, shows Buddha using "himself" to conquer non-buddhist people
 isi se aage kaha gaya he: "buddha kii prakruti swayan kii nahin he
 Self has been used to guide sentient beings
 " The scripture Ratnagotra department associated with this, states that the teachings of the Tathagatagarbha are intended to win over sentient beings and to end "self-association" - one of the five deficiencies of non-buddhist teaching
 Yoru Wang in the Lankavatara Sutra also finds the use of a similar language, then writes: "seeing that this reference is necessary
 ye hamen is nishkarsh par pahunchane se rokegaa ki tathagatagarbha ke vichaar se ye sirf ek parloukik kalpana bhar thi
 "however, some people have objected to this conclusion associated with the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and claimed that the Buddha proclaimed that he was himself, emphasizing his own reality in these lines: 'kai kaarnon or paristhitiyon ke chalate maine bhi ye shiksha di ki swayan hi swayan se pare he
 While it is actually myself, i have taught that there is no self but there is nothing wrong with it
 buddha-dhaatu sravayan rahit he
 When the Tathagata teach that there is no self, they do this because of eternity
 tathagat swayan hai or wo swayan nahin hone kii shiksha dete hai kyonki unhone samprabhutaa kii prapti kar lee he
 ' nirvana sutara main buddha ne kaha he ki ab vah ab tak gopneey rakhe gaye siddhanton kii shiksha denge or gaiyr-swayan par unki pehle di gai shiksha auchity ke aadhaar par hi thi
 Dr
 Kosho Yamamoto writes: 'vah kehete hai ki gaiyr-swayan jo unhone pehle sikhaaya tha wo kuch or nahin balki us paripekshya main auchity bhar he
 

he also told that now he is ready to talk about confidential knowledge
 vyakti sire se ulat vichaaron kaa bhi paalan karata he
 So now he will talk about the positive qualities of nirvana, which is nothing but eternal, joy and pure
 ' According to some scholars, the language used in the Sutras of Tathagatagarbha nature emphasizes Buddhist teaching from dependent origins in positive language, so that people do not turn away from Buddhism and do not understand this teaching as Nihilism
 
 For example, in some sutras full knowledge of non-self is called the true self; The ultimate goal of this path is again explained in a very positive language that has been used in the philosophy of India, but now it has been made part of the new Buddhist vocabulary to explain the person who taught the Buddhist path Successfully completed
 dow yamamoto bataate hai ki nirvana kaa 'sakaaratmak' chithran asal main ek ucch koti ke nirvana se judaa hua he - jise 'mahanirvana' kehete hai
 Talking about the text 'bodhisattva the great divine king' of the Nirvana Sutra, Yamamoto himself resorts to the scripture: 'what is Nirvana? 


 It is like this that a hungry person gets that peace and happiness as if some food has gone in his stomach
 ' Yamamoto continues the quote, adding his own commentary as well: "lekin, aise nirvana ko "mahanirvana" nahin kaha ja saktaa"
 or wo "maha swayan", "maha harsh" or "maha shuddhta" par bhi chintan karte hai jo sabhi sanathan kii tarah hi maha nirvana ke chaar gun hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, "swayan" kii yahaan or sambandhit sutron main vyakhya asal main paryaapt swayan kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karti he
 Indeed, it is an expression of emptiness in a positive language and indicative of the attainment of enlightenment through Buddhist practices
 is drushtikon main 'tathagatagarbha' / buddha kii shiksha kaa dhyey mukti-shastravaadi he na ki saidhantik
 However, this interpretation is controversial
 sabhi vidwaanon kaa yah mat nahin he
 Writing on the diverse knowledge of the Tathagatarbha doctrine in the Nirvana Sutra and related scriptures, Dr
 Jamie Hubbard says how some scholars find inclination towards the nature of ultimate elementalism and monotheism in the Tathagagarbha
 Dr
 Hubbard's comments: 'matsumoto ki behad sakaaratmak bhashaa or tathagatagarbha shaastra main gyaan ke prerak tareeke main kai samanthaayen hai
 At the same time he showed sufficient monotheism in the Atman / Brahmin tradition
 Apparently, Matsumoto only mentioned this similarity, it is not
 udhaaharan ke liye, takasaki jikido jo tathagatagarbha parampara ke prakand vidwaan maane jate hai, unhone tathagatagarbha or mahayan ke siddhaton main advaitvaad ko dekha


obermiller ne apane anuwaad main advait param siddhant kii dharna ko tathagatagarbha parampara se jodakar dekha or unhone ratnagotra par tippanee kii, jiskaa unhone bade hi sateek tareeke se "buddha advaitvaad kii niyam pustika" ke taur par namakaran kiya
 

lamotte and Frauwolner contrasted the Tathagatagarbha doctrine with the Madhyamika and they associated it with the monotheism of the Atman / Brahman, while some such as Ngao, Seafort Royg and Johnston only voiced their doubts and said that it was at the time of the Vedas
 Corresponds to the later monotheism
 ek or mat jiskaa pratinidhitiv yamaguchi susumu or unke chaatr ogava ichijo karte hai, unhone tathagatagarbha ko vaidic vichaaron ke bina hi samajhane main safalataa pai or unhone use riktata or kaarantv kii buddha parampara main hi paaya jo kisi bhi tarah ke advaitvaad ko sire se nakaarte hai
 Obviously, the questions related to the monotheism or eternal nature of the Tathagatagarbha and Buddhist tradition are complex
 dow habird in shabdon ke saath tathagatagarbha ke siddhanton par apane shodh kaa saar rakhte hai: 'knowledge of the Tathagatagarbha has always been a matter of debate, because he has a very positive positive approach to truth and knowledge, not a description of reality in a negative context, that is, not in terms of what it is lacking or vacancy, but as positive description ' paul williams ke anusaar, atman / brahman vichaar ke advaitvaad main ekarupata samajhaaii ja sakati he
 When Nirvana Sutras put forth their teachings to conquer non-buddhist monks: is samay buddha dharm par hindu prabhaav ke bare main bada rochak lagata he
 But it is very easy to just talk about the effects
 

 ye kehete hue mahaparinirvana sutara khud hi ek prakaar se hindu prabhaav kii baat maanata he, jab wo buddha ko 'swayan' kaa istemaal karte hue gaiyr-buddha saadhuon ko jeetne kii baat karata he
 Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that the outstanding self-brahmin of Advaita Vedanta influenced Buddhism at this time
 ye kahin bhi spasht nahin he ki swayan jiskaa mahaparinirvana sutara main arth he swayanrahit kii kahin bhi advait brahman se tulana kii ja sakati he or vaise bhi ye tathagatagarbha sutara goud pad, jise hindu advait mat kaa sansthaapak kaha jaataa he, usase bhi purana he
 The sutra also says that the nature of the Buddha is truly voiceless, but on the basis of interaction it is called itself
 isi sutara ke duusare khand main, yah kaha gaya he ki teen tareeke hai, jinase vyakti kuch "paa" saktaa he; purv main paanaa, vartmaan main paanaa or bhavishya main paanaa
 usamen kaha gaya he ki "sabhi main buddha kii prakruti he" kaa aashay he ki sabhi bhavishya main ja kar buddha ban jaaenge

 haalanki, dojan ne saaf kaha he ki buddha kii prakruti kuch sandarbhon main vartmaan main bhi maujuud he yahaan tak ki gaiyr-buddha main bhi: asal main vaastaviktaa ko vartmaan se tulana karnaa ise buddha prakruti se joda gaya, jisamen ghaas, ped, man or sharir sabhi ko shaamil kiya gaya
 To dozan is to see anything or see the nature of Buddha
 jabaki chinul kaa mat he ki ye sharir main soonghney or dekhne kii kshamta kii tarah vidyaman he
 The important Lankavatara Sutra states that all actions are due to the nature of Buddha, the destiny of every karma is the cause and root
 jaisaa ki upar sujhaayaa gaya he japani jine guru dojan ne buddha prakruti kii bilkul alag vyakhya kii he, jisamen 'sampurna swaroop' ko buddha prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he or kuch bhi isse alag nahin
 buddha kii prakruti sirf 'buddha hone kii kshamta' bhar nahin he, balki sansar kii har vastu kii prakruti yahi he
 All things are seen as Buddha nature in their impermanence and they are not proof of 'ability' for any Buddha nature
 dow masao abe is samaj par likhte hai: '


 In Dozen's understanding, Buddha nature is not a proof of any ability, it is not a seed that every sensitive person has
 Rather every sensitive person, or say everything, living or dead, is actually Buddha nature
 ye koi kshamta nahin he jo bhavishya main rup dikhaaegi, har vastu kii mul prakruti yahi he
 Dozen thus encompassed almost everything, extending the scope of the idea of buddha nature and 'sentient beings', all those things which are alive, which have intelligence and which are Buddha nature itself
 dow masao abeiski vyakhya karte hai: '


 Dozen has not only expanded the scope of the meaning of Buddha nature, but has also given greater scope to sensitive people
 " busho " main, "sampurna vyaktitv hi buddha kii prakruti he
 "immediately after saying this, he says," i consider the whole person's unit of 'sentient beings' inseparable "


 that is, the Dozen has expanded the scope of Xuzhou, which is traditionally meant only for living or sentient beings Used to now include dead and insensitive objects
 duusare shabdon main, unhone mrit vastuon main jivan dekar asamvedansheel vastuon main bhavanaaen dekar or ant main sabhi main buddha or buddha prakruti dene kii baat kahi he
 '
 jain dharm main iskaa arth he karm ke aakhri bandhan khol dena
 jab ek prabud maanav jaise ki ek arihant yaa tirthankar apane shesh adhatiya karmon / aghaty karm ko nasht kar dete hai is tarah apane sansaarik astitv ko samaapt karte hai, tab is avasthaa ko nirvana kaha jaataa he
 Technically, the renunciation of the body of an Arihant or the death of their body is called nirvana, because they have ended their existence in the world and attained liberation
 moksh yani, mukti ke baad nirvana kii prapti hoti he
 After the attainment of nirvana, an Arihant becomes perfect, a liberated person
 jain dharm main nirvana kaa arth he: Those who believe in Jainism celebrate Diwali as the 24th Tirthankara Mahavir Bhagwan's Nirvana Kalyanak Day
 nirvana diwas ko jainagam main 'nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to the Shvetambara belief, Kalpasutra contains detailed information on Mahavira's nirvana
 shwetambar manyata anusaar uttaradhyaan sutara main bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah gautam ne kasee ko, jo parshv ke shishy the, nirvana kaa arth samajhaayaa

 One Mahirajas is equal to ten tridents
 das mahirajas baraabar hote hai ek balagr ke
 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Naseeruddin Shah is a famous actor in Hindi films
 nasiruddin shah, jinhen hindi film udyog main adaakaari kaa ek paimaana kaha jaae to shaayad hi kisi ko etraj ho
 The biggest proof of Nasir's ability is his success in both streams of cinema
 naseer kaa naam agar parelal cinema ke sabase behtareen abhinaytaon kii suchi main shaamil hua to bollywood kii mukhya dhara yaa vyapaarik filmon main bhi unhone badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Naseer became a mainstream favorite star with his brilliant style, a star that made every character come alive with great acting
 ye sitar jab bhi screen par aayaa dekhne vaale ke dil par us kirdaar kii yaadgaar chhap chhod gaya
 His comedy tickled the public a lot, and in action he also saw a different style
 mukhya dhara cinema main nasiruddin shah ke safar kii shuruyaat 1980 main ai film 'ham paanch' se hui
 While the film was commercial, the depth of Naseer's acting in it was no less than that of parallel cinema films
 gulaami ko apni takadir maan chuke ek gaanv main vidroh kii aawaaj buland karte noujvaan ke kirdaar main naseer ne jaan phoonk di
 However, the film did not succeed at the box office and to prove success as a commercial actor, Naseer also needed to be sold at the ticket window
 or unke liye ye kaam kiya 'jane bhi do yaaron' ne
 'jaane Bhi Do Yaaron', one of Bollywood's all-time best comedy films, featured unmatched comic timing by the pair of Ravi Vaswani and Naseer and the film was a huge success
 lekin commercial cinema main naseer kii sabase badi kamyaabi bani 'maasoom'
 Naseer not only garnered a lot of applause for his father's and son's relationship with 'awesome' in the exquisite 'masoom', but the film also became a super hit and Naseer got a star status
 naseer ke is star states ko or majboot kiya 1986 main ai subhash ghai kii multistarar megabajet film 'karma' ne
 It was not easy for Naseer to leave his mark in the film as there was also acting monarch "dilip Kumar"
 or us daur ke nae navele sitare jaiki shroff or anil kapur bhi the
 In 1987, Gulzar's 'saazat' became another means of success for Naseer
 ek jajbaati kahani, behtareen nirdesan, shandaar abhinay or yaadgaar sangeet
 'mujat' achieved tremendous success at the box office and Naseer's status as a commercial actor grew further
 'tridev' jaisi superhit film dekar, 90 kaa dashak aate-aate naseer ne vyapaarik filmon main bhi apni alag pahchaan bana lee thi
 Naseeruddin played Captain Nemo in the 2003 Hollywood film 'the League of Extra Ordinary Gentlemen' and on the other hand he did a brilliant job in the Pakistani film Khuda Ke Liye
 desh se lekar pardes tak, nasiruddin shah ne apni adaakaari kaa loha sari duniya main manvaaya he
 But Nasir calls his ability a good luck
 wo kehete hai, 'main khud ko khushkismat maanata hum ki mujhe itane maukey mili, lekin main vyapaarik filmon se abhi santusht nahin hoon
 ' 2008 main ai 'a vednesade' ne naseer kii kamaal kii adaakaari kaa ek or najarana pesh kiya to 'ishkia', 'raajnneeti', 'saat khun maaf' or 'darty pikchar' jaisi filmon ke jariye nasiruddin ne baar-baar ye sabit kiya ki ek sachche kalakaar ko umr baandh nahin sakati
 Naseer's vigorous acting in the recently released film 'maximum' has entertained the audience a lot
 aaj ke nasiruddin shah kii baat karen to shaayad hi aisa koi role he jo unpar feet nahin baithe
 After all, those actors are such that they mold themselves according to each role
 lekin ek samay tha jab naseer ko do role karne kii ichha thi jo us samay unhen nahin mili
 But after 'mirza Ghalib', he got two roles in Doordarshan serial in which he tried to reveal the real picture of Ghalib
 lekin aap jaanakar hairaan rah jaaenge ki gaalib banane kii naseer kii tamanna unke dil main ek adhure khwab kii tarah ataki hui thi
 Years before the serial was made in 1988, Gulzar Saheb wanted to make a film on Ghalib and his heartfelt desire was to take Sanjeev Kumar as Ghalib in that film
 naseer sahab ne is bare main bataate hue kaha, 'maine gulzaar bhai ko chitthee likhi or apni photographs bheji, maine likhaa ki ye kya kar rahe hai, is film main aapako mujhe lenaa chahie
 'but Sanjeev Kumar had a heart attack and health was not supporting him
 phir uske baad gulzaar sahab ke dil main us role ke liye amitabh ke naam kaa khyal aayaa
 But there was no talk there and eventually the plan to make a film on Ghalib was put on hold
 shaayad us vakt gulzaar ko bhi nahin maaloom hoga ki is kirdaar par to takadir ne kisi or kaa naam likh diya he
 Many years later, Gulzar saheb called Nasir one day
 naseer ne bataaya, 'ek din mujhe gulzaar bhai kaa phone aayaa ki serial main kaam karoge
 i asked which serial he told Ghalib
 maine bina kuch soche fouran haa kah diya
 ' saal 1982 main 'gandhi' ke relies hone ke attharah saal baad camel hasan ne 'he ram' banaai, jisane naseer sahab kii gandhi banane kii tamanna ko bhi puraa kar diya
 Not only did he put his life into the character of Gandhi with a seductive style and unmatched style
 bejod acting or gajab kii kshamta se har tarah ke kirdaar nibhaane vaale naseer ne apni chhap nakaaratmak bhoomikaaon main bhi chodi
 This hero of parallel cinema will always be remembered as a dangerous villain in commercial films
 hindi cinema main villen kaa ye nayaa cheharaa tha, khoonkhaar or ajeebogareeb shakl vaala koi gunda nahin balki sofesticted insaan jiske dimag main sirf jehar hi jehar tha
 Naseeruddin Shah played him with more seriousness than the villain's character
 vaise khalanaayak ke taur par unki ek do filmein nahin thim
 In 'mohra', he showed the face of the villain that can create fear in anyone's heart
 andhaa hone kaa naatak karne vaala ek shikari, lekin ye naseer kii asli pahchaan nahin thi
 Naseer's real identity was parallel cinema
 cinema kii wo dhara jisamen ek star ke liye kam or actor ke liye gunjaaish zyada hoti he
 And it is not hidden from anyone that Naseer is an actor first and star later
 samanaantar cinema ke is sitare ne smita patil, shabana azmi, amrish puri or om puri jaise maahir kalakaaron ke saath milakar art filmon ko ek nai pahchaan di
 Naseer, who has started acting from sensational films like 'nishat', has acted in films like 'aakrosh', 'sparsh', 'mirch Masala', 'bhavni Bhavai', 'ardhasatya', 'mandi' and 'chakra'
 Set an example
 nasiruddin shah kaa janm 20 july 1950 ko uttar pradesh ke barabanki main hua tha
 Nasiruddin Shah completed his graduation from Aligarh Muslim University and then enrolled in the National School of Drama
 abhinay ke is pratishthit santhaan se abhinay kaa vidhivat prashikshan lene ke baad ve rangamanch or hindi filmon main sakriy ho gaye
 Naseeruddin Shah's list of films shows a unique combination of parallel and mainstream films
 aapke bhai leftinent general zamir uddin shah aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati hai
 Naseeruddin Shah started his career with the film Nishant with actresses like Smita Patil and Shabana Azmi
 ‘nishanth’ ek art film thi
 The film lagged behind in terms of earning but everyone appreciated Naseeruddin Shah's performance in the film
 is ke baad nasiruddin shah ne aakrosh, ‘sparsh’, ‘mirch masala’, ‘albert pinton ko gussa kyon aata he’, ‘mandi’, ‘mohan joshi haazir ho’, ‘arddh satya’, ‘katha’ aadi kai art filmein kin
 Along with art films, he was also active in commercial films
 ‘maasoom’, ‘karma’, ‘ijazat’, ‘jalawaa’, ‘hero heeralaal’, ‘gulaami’, ‘tridev’, ‘vishwatma’, ‘mohara’, sarfarosh jaisi vyapaarik filmein kar unhone sabit kar diya ki vah sirf art hi nahin commercial filmein bhi kar sakate hai
 There was a time in Naseeruddin Shah's film journey when he showed no hesitation in making his presence in Masala Hindi films
 vakt ke saath nasiruddin shah ne filmon ke chayan main pun: satarkta baratani shuru kar di
 Later he began to make his presence in lesser films, but good films
 nasiruddin shah ne ek film kaa nirdesan bhi kiya he
 Recently he has spread the magic of his acting in films like "ishqiya", "politics" and "zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"
 2013 John dey zindaa bhaag Siddharth deol Girl in yellow boots darty pikchar Will not get life again nasiruddin shah ko 1987 main padam shri or 2003 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya he
 He received the National Award for Best Actor in 1979 for the film 'sparsh' and in 1984 for the film 'paar'
 2006 main film ‘ikbaal’ ke liye nasiruddin shah ko sarvshereshth abhinayta kaa rashtriya puraskaar mila
 He was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 1981 for the film 'aakrosh', in 1982 for the film 'chakra' and in 1984 for the film 'masoom'

08 Sarangarh is in a way a very big city 'because this Sarangarh tehsil was the first reign of kings and there was a large number of lands and governing power

 Guntapalla has a village in Kadap district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 467 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The birth of Jesus is considered as Adhar and the year 467 BCE or the year before it is displayed in this way
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 467 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 kisi bhashaa main kahi yaa likhi gayi baat kaa kisi duusari bhashaa main sarthak parivartan anuwaad kehalaata he
 The work of translation has been done since very old times
 sanskrit main 'anuwaad' shabd kaa upyog shishy dwaara guru kii baat ke duhraaye jane, punah kathan, samarthan ke liye prayukt kathan, aavriti jaise kai sandarbhon main kiya gaya he
 The word ‘translation’ is derived from the ‘vad’ metal of Sanskrit
 ’vad‘ kaa arth he bolnaa
 Adding the suffix 'a' to the 'vad' metal has its changed form in the expressive noun 'vad' which means 'action to say' or 'said thing'
 'vaad' main 'anu' upsarg upsarg jodakar 'anuwaad' shabd bana he, jiskaa arth he, praapt kathan ko punah kahana
 It was first used by Monier Williams as a synonym for the English word translation
 iske baad hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa prayog ek bhashaa main kisi ke dwaara prastut kii gai saamagree kii duusari bhashaa main punah prastuti ke sandarbh main kiya gaya
 In fact, translation is the best way to identify the rainbow form of language
 anuwaad kii anivaaryta ko kisi bhashaa kii samruddhi kaa shor machaa kar taala nahin ja saktaa or na anuwaad kii bahukoniya upyogita se inkaar kiya ja saktaa he
 JT chhis
 The accepted meaning of the word 'translation' as a synonym of JPV is to reach the idea content of one language to another language
 anuwaad ke liye hindi main 'ultha' kaa prachlan bhi he
 Along with TRANSLATION in English, there is also the practice of TRANSCRIPTION, which is called 'transliteration' in Hindi
 anuwaad or lipyantaran kaa antar is udhaaharan se spasht he- It is clear from this that the Hindi translation in 'translation' is presented in English, whereas in transliteration the thing written in the Nagari script is kept only in the Roman script
 anuwaad ke liye 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But now new meanings and uses of both these words are prevalent
 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog angreji ke INTERPRETATION shabd ke paryaay-swaroop hota he, jiskaa arth he do vyaktiyon ke bich bhashik sampark sthapit karnaa
 The linguistic distance between a Kannada-speaking person and an Assamese-speaking person is overcome by interpretation
 'roopaantar' shabd in dinon praayah kisi ek vidha kii rachana kii anya vidha main prastuti ke liye prayukt he
 Like, Premchand's novel 'godan' has been adapted into a drama 'hori'
 kisi bhashaa main abhivyakt vichaaron ko duusari bhashaa main yathavat prastut karnaa anuwaad he
 In this particular sense, the meaning of the word 'translation' is sure
 jis bhashaa se anuwaad kiya jaataa he, vah mulbhasha yaa strotbhasha he
 The new language to be translated from it is 'presented language' or 'target language'
 is tarah, strot bhashaa main prastut bhav yaa vichaar ko bina kisi parivartan ke lakshyabhasha main prastut karnaa hi anuwaad he
 j ek acha anuvadak vah he jo- Translation is considered an exceptionally difficult and ad hoc task
 yah ek jatil, kritrim, aavashyaktaa-janit, or ek drushti se sarjanaatmak prakriya he jisamen asaadhaaran or vishisht koti kii pratibha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is its own nature
 parantu mana jaataa he ki moulik lekhan na hone ke kaaran anuwaad ko sammaan kaa sthaan nahin miltaa he
 Because it is calculated that translation is difficult because it is not original writing - it is necessary to reiterate what was said earlier, in which it is necessary to follow many controls and restrictions
 is prakaar amaulik hone ke kaaran anuwaad kaa mahatva to kam ho gaya, parantu isi kaaran iske liye apekshit niyantranon or bandhanon ko mahatvapurn nahin samajha gaya
 The ideas of creative writers have often been discussed in this regard
 kuch vichaar is prakaar hai : The entire translation work is only an attempt to find a solution to an irreparable problem
 kisi kriti kaa anuwaad uske dosha ko badha detaa he or uske gunon ko vidrup kar detaa he
 Translations can never be successful as a genre of art
 anuvadak vanchak hote hai
 The circumstances behind the emergence of such ideas and the beliefs inspired by them are considered
 pehle anuwaad saamagree kaa bahulansh saahitiyik rachanaayen hoti thim, jinka anuwaad rachanaaon kii saahitiyik prakruti kii simaaon ke kaaran pathak kii aashaa ke anuroop nahin ho paata tha
 At the same time, it was also believed that the translation of each part of the language of the composition is required, so that no part of the original sensation is removed, and because it is not possible, the translation was placed in the category of discourse
 yah sthiti sthool rup se unnisvin shatabdi ke purvardh tak rahi jisamen anuwaad mukhya rup se vyaktigat ruchi se prerit adhik tha, saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit kam
 Apart from this, this type of opinion was also formed due to the quantum abundance of original writing
 duusare vishwayuddh ke pashchaat samrajyavad ke khandit hone ke falswaroop anek chote-bade raashtra swatantra hue tathaa unki asmita kaa prashn mahatvapurn ho gaya
 The constituents of the federal republics also began to become aware of their identity
 is sampark-sthapana tathaa asmita-vikaas kii sthiti main bhashaa kaa kendriya sthaan he, jo bahubhashikta kii sthiti ke rup main dikhaai padataa he
 The power of translation is inevitable in this
 iske falswaroop anuwaad pradhan rup se ek saamaajik aavashyaktaa ban gaya he
 a variety of writings began to be translated
 anuwaad kaary ek vyavsaay ho gaya
 Agencies to train translators were established, in which short-term and full-time courses and workshops etc
 were organized
 iskaa yah bhi parinaam hua ki ek or to anuwaad ke prati saamaajik drushtikon badla tathaa duusari ore gyanatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth ke vikaas ko vishesh bal mila tathaa anuwaad prashikshan paathyakramon ke liye anuwaad siddhanth kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar kiya gaya
 As a result, the translation theory became a relatively independent enlightenment, accessible to all three, including translator, translation teacher, and translation critic
 anuwaad ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kaa sutarapaat aadhunik yug main hi hua, aisa samajhnaa tathy or tark donon ke hi vipareet mana jane laga
 Given the long tradition of translation work, it became logical to assume that the tradition of theoretical discussion about translation work is also old
 isa purv pehali shatabdi main siciro ke lekhan main anuwaad chintan ke beej praapt hote hai or tatpashchaat bhi is vishay par vidvan apane vichaar prakat karte rahe hai
 The background of this thought has also been there, though it is not clearly defined
 yah avashya mana gaya ki jis prakaar anuwaad kaary kaa sangathit rup main hona aadhunik yug kii dein he, usee prakaar anuwaad siddhanth kii apekshaakrit suparibhaashit prishthbhumi kaa viksit hona bhi aadhunik yug kii dein he
 The main feature of the modern context of translation theory is its multilateralism
 yah kisi ekanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit na hokar anek parantu paraspar sambaddh shastron kii samanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit he, jinke prasangochit anshon se vah prishthbhumi nirmit he
 The main scriptures are text science, communication theory, language use theory, and comparative applied linguistics
 yah spasht karnaa bhi uchit hoga ki ek ore maanav anuwaad tathaa yantrik anuwaad, tathaa duusari ore likhit anuwaad or maukhik anuwaad ke vyaavhaarik mahatva ke kaaran inke saiddhanthik paksh ke vishay main bhi chintan armbh hone laga he
 However, the translation of humanized written medium has been considered to be of quantitative and qualitative precedence and the issues of theoretical thinking related to them are particularly relevant
 yadhyapi pracheen bhartiya parampara main anuwaad chintan kii parampara utane vyavasthit tathaa lekhabaddh rup main praapt nahin hoti, jis prakaar pashchim main, tathaapi anuwaad chintan ke beej avashya uplabdh hai
 Accordingly, translation is repetition - re-telling a message expressed in one language to another
 anuwaad ke prati yah drushti pashchimi parampara main sweekrut dharna se bahya str par hi bhinn prathit hoti he
 But by adopting this vision, many theoretical points related to translation have been given more vivid and relevant interpretation
 isi sambandh main duusari drushti dwandvatmakataa kii he
 Which is modern and mainly the result of structuralism
 anuwaad kaary kii parampara ko dekhne se yah spasht he ki anawaad siddhanth sambandhi chintan saahitiyik kritiyon ko lekar hi adhik hua he
 This situation is also true
 vigat yug main saahitiyik kritiyon ko hi anuwaad ke liye chunaa jaataa tha
 Even now translations of literary works are more frequent
 tathaapi, paristhitiyon ke anurodh se ab saahityetar lekhan kaa anuwaad bhi adhik maatra main hone laga he
 The special thing is that there is a fundamental difference between the writings of the two categories
 jise lekhak kii vyaktinishthata tathaa nirvaiyaktikta kii shabdaawalee main adhik spasht reeti se prakat kar sakate hai
 Subjective writing, by virtue of its nature, has its own context
 yah kahkar ham donon kii ubhaynishth prishthbhumi kaa nishedh nahin kar rahe, parantu prastut sandarbh main ham donon kii duuri or aapekshik swaittata ko vishesh rup se ubhaarna chaahate hai
 It is only appropriate that the theoretical context of translation of non-personal writings from the side of linguistics be particularly highlighted
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek vikasman aayam he anusandhan kii pravriti
 Due to the multidisciplinary nature of translation theory, experts in various fields - philologist, sociologist, psychologist, academician, anthropologist, information theory expert - began to take interest in research work on the theoretical parts of translation with mutual cooperation
 anuwaad kaary kaa kshetra badhata gaya
 Connections between people of different cultures increased - people went abroad for education, business-industrial organizations worked in different countries, people of different languages sat together in conferences and exchanged, diplomatic agreements started between nations
 in sabhi main anuwaad kii anivaary rup se aavashyaktaa prathit hui or anuwaad kii vishisht samasyaayen ubharne lagi
 The study of these problems became a fertile field of research related to translation
 ek ore bhashaa or samskruti tathaa duusari ore bhashaa or vichaar ke madhya sambandh par anuwaad dwaara prastut sakshya ke aadhaar par nayaa chintan saamne aayaa
 New possibilities began to emerge in the areas of machine translation and oral translation, which gave impetus to translation research in these areas
 maanav anuwaad tathaa likhit anuwaad ke paramparaagat kshetron par bhi bhashaa adhyayan kii nai drushtiyon ne visheshgyon ko nutan paddati se vichaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 From all these trends, the theory of Anavad started getting the status of prestige and it started getting acceptance as an appropriate field of theoretical research

 The legend of Babel's tower is famous, which points to the fact that, many languages are spoken in human society
 yah tarksangat rup se anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki parsparik sampark kii saamaajik anivaaryta ke kaaran anuwaad vyavhaar kaa janm bhi bahut pehle ho gaya hoga
 But as far as the written evidence is concerned, brihat str par anuwaad tabhi hota he, jab do bhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon main dirghakaal paryant sampark bana rahe tathaa use santulit karne ke prayaas ke antargat alp viksit samskruti ke log suviksit samskruti ke logon ke sahitya kaa anuwaad kar apane sahitya ko samrudh karen
 Prachara translations from Greek to Latin and Arabic to European languages are believed to be the result of this trend
 anuwaad kaary ko itihaas kii pravritiyon kii drushti se do bhaagon main vibhajit kija jaataa he - pracheen or aadhunik
 Translations of three types of compositions are mainly received in the ancient era
 kyonki in teen kshetron main hi praayah granthon kii rachana hoti thi
 These fields are - literature, philosophy and religion
 saahitiyik rachanaaon main greek ke elliod or odesi, sanskrit ke ramayana or mahabharat aise granth hai, jinka vyapak str anuwaad hua
 Plato's dialogues in philosophical works became popular from the point of view of translation
 dharmik rachanaaon main bible ke sabase adhik anuwaad paae jate hai
 Through the translation of modern era, these great texts of ancient era are now available to different languages
 anuwaad takanic kii drushti se in anuwaadon kii visheshta yah he ki, pracheen yug main ye anuwaad vishesh rup se ekapaksheeya rup main hote the arthath jis bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jate the unase unki kisi rachana kaa mul granth bhashaa main anuwaad nahin hota tha
 The reason for this is that the texts of the target language were often not as excellent as compared to the original texts, secondly, it was considered inappropriate to use as the target language due to the high regard for the language of the original texts
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa kshetra vistrut ho gaya he
 The texts and compositions of the above mentioned three areas of science, technology, medicine, administration, diplomacy, law, public relations and many other areas have also come into being
 pracheen yug ke anuwaadon kii tulana main aadhunik yug ke anuwaad dwipaksheeya rup main hote hai
 The economic and political importance of translation has also become prestigious in the modern era
 vibhinn rashtron ke madhya raajnneetik, aarthik or saanskrithik anubandhon ke prapatr ke dwibhashik paath taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Multinational institutions have to use more than one language
 sanyukt raashtra main prayek kaary paanch yaa chah bhashaaon main kiya jaataa he
 All of this essentially requires translation
 is sthiti kaa auchity bhi he
 As a result of the industrial, technological, economic and political revolution in the modern era, the consciousness of the need for close contact with each other in the nations of the world has developed very quickly, due to which translation is considered natural to get this importance
 yahi kaaran he ki yadi pracheen yug kii prerak shakti anuvadak kii vyaktigat ruchi adhik thi, to aadhunik yug main anuwaad kii saamaajik-aarthik-raajnneetik aavashyaktaa ek prabal prerak shakti banakar saamne ai he
 There are many examples of this situation
 bhashaayi alpsankhyak varg ke lekhakon kii rachanaayen duusari bhashaaon main anudit hokar adhik padhi jaati hai
 Relatively small and multi-lingual nations face the problem of establishing contacts between different linguistic communities within their own country
 saamaajik aavashyaktaa ke anuroop anuwaad ke is mahatva ke kaaran anuwaad kaary ab sangathit rup se hota dekha jaataa he
 To meet the needs arising due to political-economic reasons, translation has now become a business and as a personal being, its organizational form also seems to be distinguished
 anuwaad kaushal ko sikhaane ke liye shiksha sansthaaon main prabandh kiye jate hai tathaa swatantra rup se bhi prashikshan santhaan kaam karte hai
 Translation as a distinct type of linguistic trade, from the Indian tradition point of view, is not new
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd or usase uplakshith bhashik vyapaar bhartiya parampara main bahut pehle se chale aae hai
 Therefore, with the help of the etymological and prophetic meanings of the word 'translation' and its English synonym 'translation', the definition and form of translation can be better known
 'anuwaad' kaa vyutpattimulak arth he - punah kathan; ek baar kahi hui baat ko dobaaraa kahana
