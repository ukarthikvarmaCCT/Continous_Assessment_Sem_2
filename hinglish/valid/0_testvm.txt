 usne apane pita se tengier par akraman kii yojana kaa anurodh kiya lekin jon ko aisa sambhav nahin laga
 Tangier was farther away and more secure
 jaan kii mrityu ke baad henry kaa bhai edward kaa rajbhishek 1433 main hua
 After much request Henry got permission to attack Tangier
 lekin nausenicon ke samay par naa pahunchne ke baavjood henry, bachi-khuchi 7000 kii sena lekar tengier 1437 main pahunch gaya
 As expected - he had to face defeat
 uske senapatiyon ne waapas nikalne kii keemat suta ko moraccan haathon main saunpane kii baat kii
 Henry did not approve of this - he kept his brother Ferdinand as a hostage
 ferdinand jail main mar gaya
 Meanwhile, Usmani Turks gained control over Istanbul in May 1453
 turk sunni muslim the or is tarah europiyon ke purv ke vyapaar kaa rasta sampurna rup se muslim haathon main chalaa gaya
 In the markets of Venice and Istanbul, prices of things started increasing
 iske baad spani or purtagali shaskaon ko purv ke raaston kii saamudrik jaankaree kii ichha or jaag uthi
 In the thirteenth century, Marco Polo reached China through the Mongol Empire
 usne lautne ke baad apane jail ke saathi ko bataaya ki hindustan purv main he
 In 1419, Niccol द de Conti of Venice learned Arabic and Persian and disguised himself in disguise as a Muslim merchant and set out in search of India
 usne 25 saalon tak purv kii yatra kii, bharat pahunchaa or kai mahatvapurn janakaariyaan di - jinamein bharat ke pattanon par china se bade jahaajon kaa aane kii ghatana ekadam apratyaashit thi
 Tangier eventually became Portuguese in 1471 but Henry died in 1474
 portugal ke ab raja jon ne diego keo ko africa taton par yatra karne ke liye bheja
 KO made a successful visit to the Congo in 1482 and established a rock there
 san 1484 main jab wo lautaa to uskaa bahut swaagat hua or use nobel kii padavi di gai
 Diego again traveled to Namibia in 1486, once again in search of his goal - just 800 kilometers north of the southern point of Africa
 lekin, lautate samay wo congou main prester jon ko dhundne niklaa or phir uskaa koi pataa nahin chalaa
 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John, who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in May 1487, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Peva were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea
 vyapaar or margon ko usne nirikshan kiya or kahiraa laut gaya
 There he met two Portuguese Jews who were sent by King John
 jaankariyon kaa aadan pradaan hua or kowilha dakshin kii ore ithiopia chalaa gaya
 He wanted to return from there, but seeing his world knowledge, King Alexander appointed his advisor and promised to send him to Portugal later
 lekin wo jaldi mar gaya or uske bete ne uski ye kaamana puri nahin kii
 Kovilha settled there
 san 1526 ke kisi portugali mishan ne baad main paaya ki kowilha ithiopia main tandoorust, safal or swasth avasthaa main tha - usne vahiin shaadi kar lee or 74 varsh kii aayu main mara
 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa
 wo pehla european navik tha jo dakshintam africa ke tat - uttamasha antareep - ke paar pahunchaa
 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm
 lekin uske pashchim se purab kii taraf ja sakane se yah sabit ho gaya ki africa kaa dakshini konaa he or duniya yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Meanwhile, King Manuel proposed the idea of a four-boat crew to India
 is dal kaa captain gamma ko chunaa gaya
 Many were astonished by this - because Gama did not experience any major maritime challenge other than the battles around
 lekin anushaasit or raja ke vishwast hone ke kaaran use niyukt kar liya gaya
 On 8 July 1497, four ships left Lisbon and began their first voyage to India
 lagbhag 170 logon ke is bede ke anya mahatvapurn naamon main martim aphonso or farnaao martins kaa naam tha
 Afonso had lived in the Congo and knew African dialects, while Fernao was an imprisonment in Morocco due to his imprisonment
 das se baarah abhiyukt bhi is jahaji bede main raja dwaara rakhe gaye the jinako khataranaak sthalon par jaankaree or khoji kaamon ko puraa karne kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 As expected, there were no women aboard the ship
 chalane ke ek saptaah baad, 15 july ko wo kenneri tak pahunche or uske baad chhaae dhundh kii vajah se jahaaj alag ho gaye
 They were scheduled to meet in Cape Verde, but Paolo de Gama did not see any other ship there
 halanki berio or bhandaaran jahaaj kuch ghanto ke bheetar aa gaye
 Gamma's ship was not found for the next four days
 milane ke baad wo vahaan ek saptaah tak ruke or phir 3 agast ko ravaanaa hue
 In all the Portuguese voyages so far, sailors' ships had passed through the Nicach off the coast of Africa - also to Bartelomeo Dias
 lekin ek tufaani hawa, jo khule atlantic main bahati he navikon ko uttamasha antareep tak teji se dhakel detii he -aisa vasco da gamma ne sun rakhaa tha
 Instead of turning east, his own sailors were told to walk south in the open sea instead of walking in Africa
 kai dinon tak khule samudr main chalane or koi jameen yaa aashaa na dekhne ke baad 1 navambar wo jameen ke nikat aae
 It must have been some 150 kilometers before Uttamaha
 logon main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 After restoring the ship and seeing its maps, people rested
 jahaaj par maujuud vrittantkaar ne likhaa ki logon kii chamadi kaa rang bhura he, ve sil, whale yaa hiran kaa maance or vanaspati kii jadi khate he
 They wear leather garments and dogs always walk with them
 vahaan se wo 16 navambar ko chale
 The Bulkul coast line did not match the map of Bertlemeo Dias, but the bay continued to move and reached Uttamaasha Antip on 22 November
 vahaan par dias dwaara sthaneey logon ke saath hue jhadpon kii khabar unhen mil chuki thi, lekin unke saath bhi vahaan par jhadap ho gai
 After repairing the ships, he left from there on 7 December
 16 disambar ko wo us nadi ke muhane par pahunche jahaan se bartelomeu dias ke navikon ne use waapas jane par majaboor kiya tha
 He saw a cross installed by Dias there
 iske baad ke raaston par aaj tak koi nahin pahunchaa tha - isliye pehle se bane maanchitr bekaar ho gaye or unhen nayaa maanchitr bananaa padaa
 They moved north along the coast
 chunki vah christmas ke aasapaas kaa samay tha, da gamma ke karmidal ne ek tat kaa naam, jisase hokar ve guzar rahe the, "nataal" rakhaa
 It means "christmas" in Portuguese and the name of that place is still in use till date
 janvari tak ve log aaj ke mozambik tak pahunch gaye the, jo purvi africa kaa ek tateey kshetra he jisapar arab logon ne hind mahaasaagar ke vyapaar network ke ek bhaag ke rup main niyantran kar rakhaa tha
 They were chased by an angry mob who came to know that they are not Muslims and they proceeded to Kenya
 kenya ke mombasa main bhi uskaa virodh hua
 After arriving, he was told that there are many Christians living in the city of Mombasa
 jahaaj ko tat se dur rakhane ke baad kuch navik shahar ke daure par gaye jahaan unhen gore isaiyon se mulaakaat hui
 Later it was learned that after receiving news from Mozambique, the Sultan there had prepared a plan to trap him
 gamma vahaan se bhaag niklaa - par use bharat pahunchne ke liye dishaao ke jaankaar navikon yaa nideshkon kii zarurat thi
 He caught four people coming on a small boat
 ek buudhe musalmaan vyapaaree ne bataaya ki paas ke tat malindi main bhartiya navik rahete hai
 Vasco reached Malindi seeing no choice
 bharatiyon ko deshkar use laga ki ye isai he - krishna ke uccharan ko wo christ samaj rahe the
 In Malindi, The Gama hired an Indian guide, who led the Portuguese on the forward route and brought them to Calicut, Kerala, on 20 May 1498, which is located on the southwest coast of India
 vahaan ke raja ne unhen kalikat ke pattan par aane kaa nyauta diya lekin gamma ke raah main itani baadhaayen ain thim ki use laga ki ye bhi dushman hi honge
 But he met Vali to meet and then Zamorin welcomed Gamma to Calicut with music
 vahaan par raaj-darbar main aane se pehle use ek mandir mila jahaan andar main use ek devi kii murti mila
 The Portuguese felt that this was a statue of Mary and she was convinced that Zamorin was a Christian ruler
 wo murti shaayad mariammaa devi kii thi jise wo isamsih kii maan mariyam samaj rahe the
 The comedian who was included in the group with Gamma who was welcomed by Jamorin wrote - "the people of this country are brown, short-sighted and at first look jealous and mean
 mard qamar ke upar kuch nahin pahante 
 Some have long hair, while many have shaved heads
 mahilaayein saamanyatya sundar nahin dikhti hai
 "fernão Martins translated Gamma into Arabic meeting Zamorin
 darbar main muslim salaahkaaron ne use vyapaar kii baat karne main kai adchane paidaa kii
 He ridiculed Gama's gift and delayed him to meet the king
 iske alaave uske paas raja ke liye uchit koi uphaar bhi nahin tha
 For this reason he had a fight with Zamorin
 zamorin ke muslim mantriyon ne usase vyapaar kaa kar maanga
 Zamorin also refuses to erect the pillar he had requested
 sulah or phir ladaai chalati rahi
 The king's Muslim ministers kidnapped many people from his entourage
 lekin samudr main unke jahaaj par aae graahakon ko gamma ne bandi bana liya
 Finally he was allowed to leave and in the end of August he left - the king also gave him a citation in Malayalam containing a message to King John of Portugal that Vasco had come here
 lekin agle hi din koi 70 arabi jahaaj vahaan akraman ke liye aate dikhe
 In response, he fired
 kuch bhartiya bandhakon ke saath sitambar 1498 main waapas portugal ke liye laut gaya
 He reached the Swahili coast again in January
 jahaaj par koi 500 din guzar gaye the - log thak or biimaar ho chale the
 While living some 2 weeks away from home on the West African coast, his brother - and captain of one of the crew's three ships, Paulo the Gamma - fell ill and was killed
 usne baaqi jahaajon ko lisbon laut jane kaa aadesh diya or bhai ko dafanaane ke baad apane dal se peeche lisbon pahunchaa
 He received a fierce reception there
 gamma ne waapas aakar apana vrittant raja manuel ko sunaaya
 Contrary to his prejudices, he found the Christians of India different and could not recognize Portugal - which surprised him
 bharat main muslimon kii upasthiti se bhi use duvidha hui
 Seeing the Muslim rule everywhere in Africa and the number of Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea, he remembered his "christian duty" and sent two more missions within two years
 janvari 1500 isvi kaa samay bahut hi shubhankar laga, par mishan bhejne main 2 maheenon kii deree ho gai
 In March 1500, 13 ships headed by Pedro ारेlvarez Cabral sailed from Lisbon
 unka lakshya africa or bharat main vyapaar ke aadhaar lagane ke alaave jamorin ko muslim vyapaariyon ko bhaga dene kaa aagrah bhi tha
 But many ships were lost in order to go southwest and then east of Gamma's stated approach to reach Uttamaasha
 kaabral kalikat pahunchaa - nae jamorin ne europea jahaajon kaa vyapaar sweekaar kiya or suraksha kaa aashwaasan diya
 But Arab merchants had reached the port for that year
 kebral ne arab jahaaj ko pakad liya - ye kahkar ki ye jamorin ke saath hui vyapaar sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 In response, he killed all 70 people of the Portuguese factory
 lekin kaabral kii yatra purna asafalataa nahin thi - usne aate vaqt sophala or kilva ke raajaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 He also went to Coonoor in India and some ships that were "lost" - reached South America
 isse pehle ke kabral laut paata, manuel pratham ne hoaao da nova ke netritv main 4 jahaajon ke saath niklaa
 a message left by Kabral was found hanging in an old shoe on the coast of Africa and reached Calicut
 vahaan pahunchakar usne kai muslim jahaajon par akraman kiya
 a factory in Coonoor returned to Lagar, Portugal
 is prakaar portugal ke jahaajon ne agle 20 saalon ke liye usne kalikat ke shaskaon se dushmani mol le lee
 In 1502, Vasco was repatriated
 uski agali yatra 1502 main hui, jab use ye gyaat hua kii kalikat ke logon ne peeche chhot gaye sabhi portugaliyon ko maar daalaa he
 He dismantled all the Indian and Arab ships en route to his voyage and proceeded to control Calicut and seized much wealth
 isse portugal kaa raja usase bahut prasann hua
 He also went to Cochin, Coonoor and Goa
 cochin ke dakshin main use sadiyon se rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa chalaa
 Gama left some Portuguese there and the ruler of that city also asked him to leave everything he had left there, but he escaped from there
 uski duusari yatra portugali raja ke mishan ke hisaab se bahut safal rahaa kyonki usne arab vyapaariyon ke kadi ladaai kii - jamorin ko vyapaar ke liye majaboor kiya or bharat main rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1524, he set out on his last visit to India
 us samay portugal kii bharat main upnivesh basti ke viceroy ke rup main aayaa, par vahaan pahunchne ke kuch samay baad uski mrityu ho gai
 Vasto de Gama was one of the most important ocean explorers after Portuguese prince and explorer Henry
 teen mahadeshon or do mahasaagaron ko paar karne ke baad bhi arab sagar main arab vyapaariyon or africa samrajyon se ladane or phir bharat aakar apane saath laae portugali raaj-sandesh tathaa uski hifaazat ke liye raja se yuddh or safalataa uske drudh-nishchay ko dikhaati he
 Vasco was rewarded as a successful soldier in Portugal upon his return
 apane samakaleen columbus ke mukaable uski lambi yatra main bhi baghaavat nahin hui or thakne ke baad bhi apane lakshya par jame rahaa
 The spice trade of Arab and Moore merchants was greatly hit when Vasco da Gama reached India
 is vyapaar ko hathiyaane ke liye vasco da gamma ne na sirf khatarnaak or parishramee yatra kii, balki kai yuddh bhi ladaa
 With the help of his superior guns, he was successful in most battles
 isse adan -hormuj -kalikat jal-vyapaar maarg tut yaa kamazor pad gaya
 Seeing his success, King Manuel of Portugal undertook many missions in India and the East
 albukark, jo uski tasri yatra se pehle portugal se bheja gaya tha, ne arab sagar main arabon ke vyapaar or saamudrik sena or sampatti ko tahas-nahas kar diya or khoji malaysia or phir china tak pahunch gaye
 By the sixteenth century, broken Arabic became the language of Portuguese trade instead of Arabic
 is samay portugal ek saamudrik shakti ban gaya
 Where he once reached in India is named vasco-di-gama in his honor
 chaand ke ek gadhde kaa or portugal main kai sadakon kaa naam vasco ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Originally made in 2011, he is portrayed as a villain in the Malayalam film Urumi, directed by Santosh Shivan

 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government

 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization

 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into several rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to reach the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai

 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun

 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here

 The cloth making business was in advanced stages
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area

 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-government institution like Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here

 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing

 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier

 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
