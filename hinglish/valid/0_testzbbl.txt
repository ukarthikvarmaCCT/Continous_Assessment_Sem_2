 List of business ethics free source software packages mukt hindi software The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya

 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"

 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main usne jain dharm apana liya tha or singhaasana tyagkar karnataka ke shravanbelagola main apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath sanyasi jivan vyateet karne laga tha
 After Chandragupta his son Bindusara was ruling but not much is known about him
 dakshin kii ore samrajya vistaar kaa shrey yada kada bindusaar ko diya jaataa he hanlanki uske vijay abhiyaan kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 According to the Jain tradition, his mother's name was Durdhar and Bindusara ruled in the Puranas for 25 years
 use amitraghaat kii oopaadhi bhi di jaati he jise unani granthon main amitrochatus kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Bindusar Azivak believed in Dharam

 Some of the antecedents of environmental education in the United States were nature studies, conservation education, and school camps
 prakruti adhyayan bahya anveshan ke saath shaikshik drushtikon ko ekikrut karata tha
 Conservation education developed awareness about the misuse of natural resources
 George Perkins Marsh lectured on the natural world as an integral part of humanity
 Government agencies such as the US Forest Service and the EPA were also emphasizing conservation practices
 sangrakshan aadarshon abhi bhi paryaavaran shiksha ko nirdeshit karte hai
 School camps exposed to the use of resources outside the classroom for environmental and educational purposes

 The EE Manual helps schools and organizations improve and develop environmental education programs that provide citizens with in-depth knowledge of the environment
 vidhyalay sambandhi ii niyamavali teen mukhya ghatakon par kendrit hoti he: paathyakram, green suvidhaayen or prashikshan
 Schools can integrate environmental education into their curriculum through adequate support fund of EE manuals

 kaksha me paryaavaran shiksha ke paathyakram ke liye aarthik sahaayta ke atirikt, paryaavaran shiksha kii niyamavali vyavhaarik bahya adhigam ke liye aarthik sansaadhan bhi aavantit karti he
 These activities and education help in combating and mitigating "inherently low disorder", as well as encouraging a more healthy lifestyle
 harith vidhyalay yaa harith suvidha kaa prachaar, paryaavaran shiksha ke anya mukhya ghatak hai
 The average cost of greening facilities in schools is less than the sum of the cost of building a traditional school and 2 percent of the cost, but the returns from these energy efficient buildings begin to be achieved within a few years

 At the undergraduate or postgraduate level, it can be seen as one of its own fields under pedagogy, environmental education, environmental science and policies, ecology, or human / cultural ecology
 paryaavaran shiksha kaksha kii paath-yojana tak hi pratibandhit nahin he
 There are many ways by which children can be educated about the environment in which they are living
 vidhyalay ke aangan main anubhav par aadhaarit shiksha va rashtriya udyanon ke pratyaksh bhraman se lekar vidhyalay ke baad harith klbon or vidhyalay str kii chirsthayee pariyojnaon tak, paryaavaran ek aisa vishay he jo sulabhtapurvak or tatparta se gamaneey he

 The final aspect of environmental policy is that people should be trained for development in an everlasting society, although this approach comes in the end but it is not less than anyone in importance
 In addition to establishing a strong relationship with nature, American citizens need to be aware of it and be proficient in it to succeed in the 21st century workforce
 Thus, environmental education policies provide financial support for both teacher training and labor training initiatives
 prabhaavshaalee dhang se padhaane va paryaavaran shiksha ko paathyakram main sammilit karne ke liye adhyapakon ko avashya hi prashikshit hona hoga
 duusari ore, vartmaan janabal ko avashya hi prashikshit yaa punah prashikshit karnaa hoga jisase vah nayi harith arthvyavastha ke saath anukulan sthapit kar saken

 Environmental education is integrated with the disciplines of external education and experiential education
 donon hi vishay paryaavaran shiksha ke poorak hai lekin phir bhi unke darshan bhinn hai
 While each of these two areas have their own goals, there are also some points where the two overlap each other based on the objectives and philosophy of environmental education
 paryaavaran shiksha se sambandhit vartmaan rujhaanon main se ek rujhaan, adarshavaad or sakriyata ke drushtikon se hatakar ek aise drushtikon kii ore janaa chahta he, jo chaatro ko apane anubhavon va aankadon ke aadhaar par suvijna nirnay lene or kaarywahi karne kii anumati detaa ho
 is prakriya main, paryaavaran paathyakram ko vikasaatmak dhang se sarkari shiksha ke str ke saath ekikrut kiya gaya he
 Some environmental teachers find this movement annoying and diverging from the real political and activist medium of environmental education, while others find this medium more legal and understandable

 This trend can be seen as a microcosm of the number of environmental education programs that seek to attract participants first by developing a sense of nature appreciation, which later works to affect conservation and sustainability
