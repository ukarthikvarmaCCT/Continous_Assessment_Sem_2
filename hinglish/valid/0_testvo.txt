 china-pakistan Economic Corridor or pakistan-china Iqtasadi Rahdari in Urdu is a very large commercial project, aimed at reducing oil and gas through Gwadar port, railway and highway from southwestern Pakistan to China's northwestern autonomous region of Xinjiang
 Delivery in time
 aarthik galiyara china-paak sambandhon main kendriya mahatv rakhata he, galiyara guadar se kashgar tak lagbhag 2442 kilometre lanbaa he
 This plan will take a long time to be completed
 is yojana par 46 billian dollar laagat kaa anumaan kiya gaya he
 This corridor will go through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, gilgit-baltistan and Balochistan
 vividh soochnaaon ke anusaar guadar bandargah ko is tarah se viksit kiya ja rahaa he, taaki vah 19 million ton kachche tel ko china tak sidhe bhejne main sakasham hoga
 Although the project was conceived in the 1950s, this goal could not be achieved due to political instability in Pakistan for years
 china nen saal 1998 main pakistan ke guadar bandargah par nirmaan kaary shuru kiya jo saal 2002 main puraa hua
 In 2014, the government of Xi Jinping of China officially announced the china-pakistan Economic Corridor
 iske jariye china ne pakistan main vibhinn vikaas kaaryon ke liye kariban 46 billian dollar dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 On 18 December 2017, China and Pakistan together approved the long-term plan of this economic corridor
 is yojana ke tahat china or pakistan saal 2030 tak aarthik saajhedaar rahenge
 In addition, Pakistan has also approved the use of Chinese currency yuan in this scheme
 bharat ne galiyare ke nirmaan ko antararashtriya kaanoon ke anusaar avaidh mana he kyonki yah paak adhikrut kashmir se hokar gujarata he, jise bharat apana hissaa maanata he
 In this case, India also lodged an objection with Chinese President Xi Jinping
 bharat ne paak-adhikrut kashmir ko lekar rus sarkaar ke samaksh bhi apana virodh jataayaa he
 It is believed that this corridor to be built at a cost of 46 billion dollars between Pakistan and China will prove to be a big change in the geopolitical scenario of South Asia
 is galiyare kaa uddeshy china ke uttari-pashchimi jhinjiyang praant ke kashgar se pakistan ke baluchistan sthit guadar bandargah ke bich sadakon ke 3000 kimi vistrut network or duusari dhanchaagat pariyojnaon ke madhyam se sampark sthapit karnaa he
 According to the documents, it is to be completed by 2030, and will be beneficial for both countries
 is galiyare ke nirmit ho jane ke baad china urja aayaat karne ke liye vartmaan ke 12,000 kimi lambey raste ke mukaable chhate raste kaa istemaal karegaa
 This will save China millions of dollars per year
 saath hi, hind mahaasaagar tak isaki pahunch bhi aasaan ho jaayegi
 Pakistan hopes that it will develop its infrastructure and in return get a potential of $ 34 billion for its water, solar, heat and wind powered power plants, which will reduce or end its severe energy crisis
 
 bhavishya main sipiisi kaa hissaa banane ko lekar iran, rus or saudi arab bhi kaaphi utsahit hai
 This possibility has added to the mystery of this much publicized economic corridor
 vahiin, is samjhaute kaa kam prachaarit paksh he- is saude ke tahat china pakistan ko aath pandubbi kii aapurti bhi karegaa, jisase pakistan kii nausainik shakti kaaphi bad jaayegi
 China's interest in Pakistan is not limited to economic gain
 purna rup se sanchalit guadar bandargah se china ko keval vyavsaayik laabh hi nahin hoga, balki isse ise bade paimaane par samrik or bhuraajnneetik laabh bhi hoga
 Although Gwadar is currently being developed for commercial interests only, there is every possibility that it will be developed into a fully equipped naval base in future
 aisi sthiti main china ko is kshetra main bade paimaane par ranneetik laabh mil saktaa he
 As is well known, Pakistan is going through the worst phase of extremism, terrorism and corruption these days, its intention would be not only to take economic benefits from this project, but also to improve its global image under Chinese patronage
 haalanki, pakistan ko sipiisi se hone vaale anumaanit laabh ke saath iske sambhavit nakaaratmak prabhaavon ko bhi santulit karnaa hoga
 Although this corridor will provide a huge economic benefit to Pakistan, but there are also many doubts about its capability and economic justification
 saath hi, pakistan ko in dinon anek aantarik or bahari rajnatik chunautiyon se jujhna pad rahaa he, jo galiyare ke vikaas main baadhak ban sakate hai
 Thousands of Chinese security personnel are stationed here in the security of Chinese workers, officers and engineers working in Pakistan because of the construction work of the corridor and such a big thing is ignored by Pakistan, it is amazing
 pakistan kii dharti par itani badi sankhya main videshi sainikon kaa hona, pakistani pratishthan ke liye chintaa kaa vishay hona chahie, khaskar china kii nayi samrajyavaadee soch or ise saakaar karne ko lekar afghanistan main kiye ja rahe prayatnon ko dekhte hue
 In the guise of development, the way China is using Pakistan's natural resources, especially Balochistan, has worried many people here
 chini companiyon ne pakistan main hajaaron acre jameen patte par lee he taaki fasalon ko ugaaya ja sake
 Also, Chinese companies will not have to pay local taxes to Pakistan to export it
 aise main pakistan sarkaar china ko kai aise sansaadhan de rahi he, jisase baad main use samasya kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The key to the success of this corridor is near the Gwadar Port in Balochistan and Pakistan aspires to become the economic head of the region
 haalanki baluchistan ko alag raashtra banane ko lekar uthati aawaaj or is kaaran sena ke ruukh ko lekar paidaa hua vivaad bhi is galiyare ke liye kai chunautiyaan pesh kar rahaa he
 The citizens of Balochistan are opposing CPEC
 agar yah galiyara safaltaapurvak banakar taiyaar ho gaya to ummid he ki pakistan ke duusare praant ke anek log apana praant chhod kar baluchistan aakar bas jaayenge
 For this reason, there have been many attacks by Baloch rebel groups on Chinese engineers and officials working for various CPEC projects
 vahiin kai pratibandhit sanghathan bhi is pariyojna ko lekar dhamkee de rahe hai, haalanki unka uddeshy is aad main pakistan ke saath apana hisaab baraabar karnaa he
 Along with this, many political organizations of the province like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh have also expressed their concern about changing the actual outline of this corridor
 unka maananaa he ki is galiyare main jaan-boojh kar badlaav kiya gaya he, taaki punjab praant ko aarthik laabh pahunchaaya ja sake
 Recently, a Pakistani politician warned in Parliament that an East India Company was taking shape as a china-pakistan economic corridor
 yah baat yojana or vikaas par seenet kii sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh seenetter taahir mashhadi ne kahi thi or unki mukhya chintaa is galiyare ke liye pakistan dwaara china se baari karj ko lekar thi
 Mashdi objected to the demand to set electricity rates in line with Chinese interests
 iske alaava sharton or vittiya vivaran ko lekar paardarshita kaa abhaav bhi chintaa kaa sabase bada kaaran he
 The Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan has also said that he does not know how much of the $ 46 billion is debt, how much equity and how much has to come in the form of goods
 unhone adhik paardarshita kii maang kii he
 Similarly, the International Monetary Fund has also warned of the possible negative consequences of the economic corridor
 chunki yah galiyara samooche pakistan se hokar gujaregaa, atah galiyare ke madhyam se yahaan ke sabhi praanton ke avasanrachana ko behatar hone kaa mauka milegaa
 According to the outline of this ambitious project, new roads, highways, railways, airports and ports will also be built and developed
 aisi bhi aashaa he ki isse khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or baluchistan jaise praant vikaas ke maamle main punjab ko kaaphi peeche chhod denge
 Not only this, when this project is fully developed, it will also generate employment on a large scale
 ummid to yah bhi he ki china ke is prastaavit nivesh se pakistan kaa sakal gharelu utpaada 15 pratishat tak badhkar 274 billian dollar tak pahunch jaayegaa
 The sluggish economy of Pakistan is directly related to the local energy crisis here
 pakistan apni urja jaruraton ko puraa karne main buree tarah naakaam rahaa he
 In view of this energy crisis, CPEC will also start other energy projects totaling 10,500 MW and the work on these projects will be done at a fast pace so that they can be completed by 2018
 ek vishisht yojana ke tahat, thar marusthal main 6,600 megawatt kii 10 pariyojnaon ko viksit kiya jaayegaa, jo is behad dur-daraaj ke ilaake ko pakistan kii urja rajdhani main badal degaa

 An object that is not visible to our eyes is called invisible
 adrishy hone kaa bhav adrishyata kehalaata he
 Invisibility is the state of an object that cannot be seen
 shabd kaa prayog aksar fantasy / vigyaan katha main kiya jaataa he, jahaan vastuon ko jaadui yaa takneekee madhyamon se nahin dekha ja saktaa he; haalanki, iske prabhaav vaastavik duniya main vishesh rup se bhautikee or avadharanatmak manovigyaan virgon main bhi pradarshit kiye ja sakate hai
 Since substances can be seen by light in the visible spectrum from a source reflecting their surfaces and striking the viewer's eyes, the most natural form of invisibility is an object that neither reflects light nor Absorbs
 ise paardarshita ke rup main janaa jaataa he, or kai swaabhaavik rup se hone vaali samagriyon main dekha jaataa he The perception of invisibility depends on many optical and visual factors

 Invisibility is often considered the supreme form of camouflage, as it does not reveal to viewers any kind of vital signs, visual effects, or frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum that can go to the human eye, but rather to radio, infrared, or Ultraviolet wavelength

 Pangea, Pangea or Pangea, was a vast unified continent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mizozoic eras around 250 million years ago; The present continent has come out of this in its present form
 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places
 panzia shabd 1928 main alfred vegener ke siddhant par charchaa ke liye yojit ek sangoshtee ke dauraan prakaash main aayaa
 a large ocean that surrounded Pangea was named Panthalasa accordingly
 aisa prathit hota he ki vishaal mahadwipon kaa vikhandan or utpatti prithvi ke 4
6 billian varshon ke itihaas main kramagat he
 Many other constructions may also have occurred prior to Pangea
 antim se duusare, panotia kaa nirmaan 600 million varsh pehle proterojoik eon ke dauraan hua tha or yah 540 eme tak astitv main rahaa tha
 Rhodinia existed before Panotia, which existed from about 1
1 billion years ago to 750 million years ago
 rodenia kaa nirmaan 2
0-1
8 jie kii avadhi main bane colombia yaa nuna naamak ek puraane vishaal mahadweep ke vikhandan se utpann tukdon ke jamaa hone or judane se hua tha
 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 During the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, it was located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalasic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin
 panzia kii utpatti kaa doosraa charan tha gondvanaa ke saath uramerica kii takkar
 silurian kaal tak, 440 eme, baltic ne pehle hi laurenshia se takaraakar uramerica kaa nirmaan kar diya tha
 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains
 dakshini america uttar disha main dakshini uramerica kii ore bad gaya tha jabaki gondvanaa ke purvi bhaag bumadhya rekha se dakshini dhruv kii ore badhane lage the
 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava
 Happens in the case
 namoona samoohon ke bich chumbakeey bhinnataayen jinaki umr main lakhon varshon kaa antar hota he, ek vaastavik dhruviya vichlan or mahadwipon kii halchal ke sanyukt kaaran aisa hota he
 The components of the true polarity deviation are the same for all samples and can be eliminated
 yah bhuvaigyanikon ko is bahaav kaa ek hissaa de detaa he jo mahadwipiya halchal ko dikhaata he or iskaa upyog pehle kii mahadwipiya sthitiyon ko punarnirdhaarit karne main madad ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea
 great rift vaili main panzia kaa vikhandan aaj bhi jari he

 band jalsambar yaa samaavruth jalsambar bhugol main aise jalsambar kshetra ko kaha jaataa he jisamen varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani ekatrit ho kar kisi nadi ke zariye samudr yaa mahaasaagar main bahane kii bajaay kisi sarovar, daldali kshetra yaa shushk kshetra main jaakar vahin ruk jaataa he
 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls
 yah chalate pani ke samooh ek-dusre se sangam karte rahete hai jab tak ke ek hi badi nadi na ban jaae
 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect
 aisa hi kuch madhya asia ke aral sagar ke saath hua he

 It can be further clarified

 Creating according to certain principles and proportions determined by nature, intelligence and interest is a related part of this art
 nakshon or pindon kaa aisa vinyas karnaa or sanrachana ko atyant upyukt dhang se samrudh karnaa, jisase adhiktam suvidhaon ke saath rochakata, saundarya, mahanata, ekta or shakti kii sristi ho se yahi vaastukaushal he
 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans
 kisi jati ke itihaas main vaastukritiyaan mahatvapurn tab hoti hai, jab unamem kisi ansh tak sabhyataa, samruddhi or vilasita aa jaati he or unamem jati ke garv, pratishtha, mahatvakanksha or aadhyatmikta kii prakruti purnataya abhivyakt hoti he
 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization
 jahaan tak puratatviya prabhaav he, yah thik he kintu vaastukala ke itihaas par ek sankshipt drushtipaat se yah spasht ho jayega ki maanav ke pracheenatam prayaas shikariyon ke adikalin gupha-awaason, charavaahon ke charm-tambuon or kisaanon ke jhopadon ke rup main dekh padate hai
 Boat dwellings and tree huts are ancient features
 dharmik smarak banane ke adikalin prayaas pathar or lakdi kii baad ke rup main the
 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later
 yugon ke drut vikascram main vaastukala vikasi, dhali or maanav kii parivartansheel aavashyaktaaon ke - uski suraksha, kaary, dharm, anand or anya yugaprarvatak chihnon, anuroop bani
 The plain form of Egypt, the standard design of China, the exotic and rich nature of India, the majestic majesty of Maya and Aztec of Mexico, the highly developed devotionals of Greece, the complex types of buildings that served the multiple needs of the Roman Empire, the ancient marched churches
 , The Great Gothic Church Building and Chitropam Fort, the excellent configuration and proportions of Turkish buildings and the grand architecture of European revival Numeric monuments present an account of the continuous development of historical architecture
 ye sab imaaraten maanav vikaas ke mahaan yugon kii ore ingit karti hai, jinamein vaastukala jaateey jivan se atyadhik sambandhit hone ke kaaran un jatiyon kii pratibha or mahatvakanksha kaa, jinaki unke smarakon par suspasht chhap hai, digdarshan karaati hai
 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is directly visible in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in tamaam saalon main vaastukala samayik chetana paryaavaran tathaa sthaneey prishthbhumi ke saamanjasy main viksit hui
 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people
 aaj kuch aise vaastu hai jo bhoot kaa anusaran karne main hi santusht hai kuch anya hai jo videshi dhang kaa anukaran karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he
 Rajbhana rajbharon raajaaon kii jameen va kila ko rajbharana ke naam se janaa jaataa he jise rajgharaana / rajawada bhi kaha jaataa he Jaino wrote Bharat, son of Rishabhdev, while Brahma wrote that the name of this country is India after the name of Bharat, son of Dusyant Shakuntala
 lekin harivansh puraana adhyay 33 prishth 53 or baliya gajetir ke prishth 77 or 138 me kaha gaya he
 The name of this country is Bharat, named after Bharata
 kai praachin itihaas kaaro kaa bhi maananaa he ki bharat jaati ke log arya or anarya dono ko jit kar apane bharatgan kabile ke naam par apane samrajya kaa naam bharat varsh rakhaa ,yahi bharat jaati aage chalakar bhar jaati ke naam se prasikad hui
 According to the Rig Veda, Saptak Mandal Sutk 83 Sloka 6-10 is written, on the banks of the river Saraswati, the king of Bharatgana was ruled by Sudas
 jiskaa raajpurohit viswamitra tha
 However, due to becoming unstable, Sudas removed Viswamitra and declared Vashisht his Rajpurohit, angry at this, Vishwamitra attacked Sudas with 10 kings
 par isame raja sudas ko vijay shri mili 
 The people of Bharata caste named their kingdom as Bharatavarsha, in the name of Bharatgana clan, by winning both Arya and Anarya in the war
 bahut se itihaas kaaro ne mana he ki bharat jaati hi kalaantar me bhar jaati kahalaai! Dolotsava is the main festival celebrated mainly in the temples of Vaishnava sect in which the idol of Shri Krishna is kept in the Hindola and taken for celebration in Upavanadi
 yon to samast bharat main is utsav kaa prachlan he kintu vrundavan tathaa bengal main yah vishesh samaaroh se manaaya jaat he
 In Bengal it is called 'dolayatra'
 aajkal yah utsav pratipada se yukt phalgun shukla poornima tathaa caitra shukla dwadashi ko manaaya jaataa he
 As is clear from the name itself, it has the prominence of dol or carousel
 shri gopalbhatta goswami virachit 'shri haribhakti vilaas' naamak nibandhgranth ke anusaar caitra shukla dwadashi ko vaishnavon ko aamantrit kar geet-vaadya-sankirthan-sahit vividh upachaaron se bhagwaan shri krishna yaa vishnu kaa pujan karke pranampurvak unhen dolarudh karake jhulaane kaa vidhaan he
 Thus, at the end of the day, with the Vaishnavas, awaken the night
 caitra shukla tritiya tathaa uttaraphalguni se yukt phalguni poornima ko bhi yah utsav karnaa chahie
 There is also a detailed description of Dolotsava or Dolayatra in the Patala section of Padmapurana: ukt puranic varnan se yah spasht he ki yah utsav ati pracheen kaal se praaia: samast bharat main prachlit tha
 Earlier this festival was held for many days in Phalgun and Chaitra month
 kalantar main yah sankshipt hota gaya
 Now it is left for only two days - Phalgun Shukla Poornima and Chaitra Shukla Dwadashi
 is utsav ko vasantotsav kaa ang mana ja saktaa he
 The Padmapurana, Garuda Purana, Dolayatattva and Sriharibhaktivilas have detailed explanations and grief of this festival

 It is customary to give some contribution at the time of Kanyadaan
 aate kii loi main chhipaakar kuchdhan kanyadan ke samay diya jaataa he
 This is the form of dowry
 bacchee ke gharase vidaa hote samay uske abhibhavak kisi aavashyaktaa ke samay kaam aane ke liye upharswaroop kuch dhan dete hai, par hota vah gupt hi he
 This is a personal gift of the guardian and daughter of Kebich
 dusron ko iske sambandh main jaanane yaa poochne kikoi aavashyaktaa nahin
 In-laws have no right to say or ask what should be given as dowry
 na uske pradsharnaki aavashyaktaa he, kyon ki garib-amir apni sthiti ke anusaar jo de, vahcharchaa kaa vishay nahin bananaa chahie, uske saath ninda-prashansa nahin judanichahie
 If you start following each other, get down to competition, then it will be disastrous
 kanya-paksh par anuchit dabaav padegaa or var-paksh adhik na milane packprasann hone kii dhristataa karne lagegaa
 Therefore, there is some money donation law along with Kanyadaan, but keeping in view the selfishness and evil potential of the people, the remotest sages have made it a rule that whatever dowry is given, it should be completely secret, anyone has the right to discuss it Don't aate main saadharantaya ek rupaya is dahej pratik ke liye payarpt he
 This metal should be taken and hidden inside the dough circle
 waalon ke upar sthaanantaran hona
 Till now parents used to manage the girl's maintenance, development, security, happiness, peace, joy, etc
 Now, that management will have to be done by the groom and his family members
 kanya naye ghar main jakarviranepan kaa anubhav na karne paye, use sneh, sahyog, sadbhaav kii kami anubhav naho, iskaa puraa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 While accepting Kanyadaan - while accepting the responsibility of marriage, the groom and his parents must realize that they have to bear that responsibility with full responsibility
 kanyadan kaa arth yah nahin ki jis prakaar koi sampatti, kisiko bechi yaa daan kar di jaati he, usee prakaar ladki ko bhi ek sampatti samajhakarkisi na kisi ko chaahe jo upyog karne ke liye de diya he
 Every human has independent power and position
 koi manushya kisi manushya ko bech yaa daananheen kar saktaa
 Then even if he is a father
 vyakti ke swatantrastitv evam adhikaar se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, na use chunauti di ja saktihai
 Parents, whether girls or boys, do not have the right to sell or donate to them
 aisa karnaa to bachche ke swatantra vyaktitv ke tathy ko hizuthlaanaa ho jayega
 Marriage is a bipartisan agreement, which both the bride and the bridegroom succeed with full honesty and integrity
 yadi koi kisi ko kharidi yaa bechisampatti ke rup main dekhen or us par pashuon jaisaa swaamitv anubhav karen yavyavhaar karen, to yah maanavtaa ke moolbhoot adhikaron kaa hanan karnaa hi hoga
 Kanyadaan does not mean, of course, that its purpose is that the girl's parents leave the responsibility of making the life of the girl well-organized, well-developed and peaceful, which she should take care of
 paraaye ghar main pahunchne par kachi umr kianubhavheen bhavuk balika ko akharane vaali manodasha main hokar guzarana padataa he
 Therefore, in this initial treaty, especially the groom's side should try to keep the bride getting more affection and support from every point of view
 kanya paksh waalon ko bhi yah nahin soch lenaa chahie ki ladki ke pile haath karadiye, kanyadan ho gaya, ab to unhen kuch bhi karnaa yaa sochna nahin he
 They also have to keep contributing to make the girl's future bright
 kriya or bhaavana- kanya ke haath haldi se pile karke mata-pita apane haath menkanya ke haath, guptadan kaa dhan or pushp rakhkar sankalp bolte hai or unahathon ko var ke haathon main saunp dete hai
 He accepts these hands with seriousness and responsibility by holding his hands
 bhaavana karen ki kanya var ko saunpte hue uske abhibhavak apane samgr adhikaar kosonpate hai
 The total gotra of the girl will no longer be from the ancestral tradition, according to the husband tradition
 kanya ko yah bhaavnaatmak purusharth karne tathaa pati ko usesvikaar karne yaa nibhaane kii shakti devshaktiyaan pradaan kar rahi hai
 With this feeling, the resolution of Kanyadaan should be spoken
 sankalp puraa hone parasankalpakatar kanya ke haath var ke haath main saunp den

 Hiranyakashipu was an asura whose story appears in the Puranas
 uskaa vadh nrisingh avtari vishnu dwaara kiya gaya
 It was the king of a place called Hiranyakaran Van, which is currently located in the Indian state of Rajasthan, known as Hindaun
 hiranyaksh uskaa chota bhai tha jiskaa vadh varah ne kiya tha
 According to a legend described in the Vishnupurana, the demons had two sons, Adyapurusha Kashyapa and his wife Diti
 hiranyakashiphu or hiranyaksh
 Hiranyakashipu, by hard penance pleased Brahma and received the boon that he would not be killed by any human nor animal, nor could be killed in day nor night, nor indoors or outside with any weapon
 And his life will not be afraid due to the attack of any weapon
 is vardaan ne use ahamkaari bana diya or vah apane ko amar samajhane laga
 He seized the kingdom of Indra and started harassing the three worlds
 vah chahta tha ki sab log use hi bhagwaan maane or uski puja karen
 He prohibited the worship of Vishnu in his kingdom
 hiranyakashiphu kaa putr prahlaad, bhagwaan vishnu kaa upaask tha or yatnaa evam pratadna ke baavjood vah vishnu kii puja karata rahaa
 Enraged, Hiranyakashipu asked his sister Holika to go into the burning fire with Prahlad on her lap as Holika had a boon that she would not burn in the fire
 jab holikaa ne prahlaad ko lekar agni main pravesh kiya to prahlaad kaa bal bhi bankaa na hua par holikaa jalakar raakh ho gai
 In the last attempt Hiranyakashipu heated an iron pillar and turned red and asked Prahlad to embrace it
 ek baar phir bhagwaan vishnu prahlaad ko ubaarane aae
 They appeared as Narasimha from the pillar and placed Hiranyakashipu at the entrance of the palace, which was neither outside the house nor inside, at dusk, when there was neither day nor night, half man, half animal which was neither male nor animal
 Killed Narasimha with his long sharp nails, which were neither weapons nor weapons
 is prakaar hiranyakashyap anek varadaanon ke baavjood apane dushkarmon ke kaaran bhayanak ant ko praapt hua There is a difference of opinion regarding the name of Hiranyakashipu
 kuch sthanon par use hiranyakashyap kaha gaya he or kuch sthanon par hiranyakashiphu
 It is believed that he was named Hiranyakashipu at the time of birth but due to persecution he was later known as Hiranyakashipu
 naam par jo bhi matbhed hon, uski maut bihar ke purniya jile ke banmanakhi prakhand ke janakinagar ke paas dharhara main hua tha

 Technology is very important to keep moving forward
 aaj kal pragaman badhwaar, vikaas or lagaataar sudhaar kaa arth he
 If society and humans have to move from one layer to the other, then it is very important to use technology
 maanav hameshaa apni jivan ko sukhmay banane kaa prayaas karata he manushya apane kaary or soch ke prati parivartan laakar use nayaa bananaa chahta he
 There are two aspects of human life that change every time
 praudyogiki upkarnon or takneekon kaa avishkaar he
 Technological change is the invention of a technology, the continuous process of improvement of a technology and its spread in this industry or society
 sosayadi saamaajik sambandhon ke madhyam se logon kaa samooh he
 Social change is the progress or change of social order
 shuruyaat se hi praudyogiki se hamaare jivan main ek kaarak tha, yah vastav main hamaare astitv ko saakaar karne lage jab yah audyogic kranti tak hi tha
 Technology has been a variable in a complex factor in the history of society
 vartmaan din main, samaaj main praudyogiki ek vardaan yaa abhishaap he
 Technology is a good way to build and improve and is badly looked at both
 praudyogiki ke upyog ke kai myanon main or duniya bhar ke kai sthanon main istemaal kiya jaataa he, kyonki yah ek sakaaratmak raste main dekha jaataa he
 Technology is used in hospitals to save the lives of patients
 praudyogiki ne manushya ko is duniya or antariksh kii bhi janaakaari di he
 The impact of technology can be divided into three parts
 
 ve is prakaar hai: - The business man helps in expecting new discoveries to be converted into goods and services
 vyapaar sanghathanon ke prabandhakon ko ek saath aavashyak sansaadhan laane ke liye or upyogi utpaadon main unhen badalane ke liye nai khojon par kaam karte hai
 Businesses are essential for goods and people, helping to create services and social development
 praudyogiki ke vajah se anek tarah ke vastu or sevaaon kaa utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he or use manushya tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he jiske istemaal se logo kii 'rahane ke maanak batch jaataa he
 Because in the technological age, the expectations of people also increase
 ve sirf puraane chize nahi balki naye chiz ke intezaar me rehte he
 There has been a need for large investment in research and development, due to which the expenditure of the merchant has also increased
 praudyogiki jatilta paidaa karata he or jivan ko kathin banaata he
 Due to technology, many things are produced very quickly
 praudyogiki sthiti matbhed banaaya or saamaajik matbhed ko hataa diya gaya he
 Technology has become a new trend in communication and other aspects of life
 praudyogiki utpaadakta vruddhi main yogadan diya ha
 Technology has changed production methods
 yah kushal shram kii aavashyaktaa bad gai he or utpaadan kaa samay kam ho gaya he
 However the cost of production of these organizations has increased
 sanghathanon kii anusandhan evam vikaas par kharch karne kii jarurat batch gayi he jiske vajah se sansthaan ke vruddhi kii vajah se kharch bhi batch gaya he
 In addition to standard office laptops and smart phones, organizations implement information systems, custom software or specialized technology tools to keep operations running smoothly
 praudyogiki main pragati ke liye ek kaary ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak samay kam, yaa kuch maamalon main ek vyapaar prakriya yaa naukari samaaroh ke liye kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt karne kii kshamta he
 Increased productivity upgrades of technology within an organization, which can significantly affect company operations
 computer or praudyogiki ke kshetra main pragati ke liye ek vyapaar kii dakshata main sudhaar hoga
 The organizational structure is being changed by modifying the status requirements of restructuring departments or by adding and removing jobs
 yah udyog maanak ban jaataa he agar niyokta aksar ek naukari kii aavashyaktaa ke rup main nae software program par prashikshan yaa upkaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Web-based businesses can add new departments or jobs to specialize in new areas of technology
 kuch avasaron par, praudyogiki ke nae roopon ko lagu karne main kuch udyogon main aprachlit kuch kaam kartavyon prastut karnaa ho saktaa he
 Nowadays, students use mobile devices etc
 through which they can do many tasks
 praudyogiki kaa upyog shiksha prapti me bhi kiya jaataa he
 Because of this, the need of teachers in the school is becoming less because videos and other mediums are being used in classrooms
 aaj kal koi bhi vyakti kahi bhi baithkar padh saktaa he yadi uske paas ek computer or internet conection ho
 Technology can affect some teachers
 praudyogiki ke chaatro laabh kyon Technology can enable students to develop skills that will be necessary in the future
 kaksha main praudyogiki ke safal pratyaropan ke saath, chaatro ve se laabh hoga ki ek aadhunik or vyapak shiksha praapt karne main sakasham hai
 Their education is growing within their generation and our society will be more favorable for that direction
 praudyogiki ke apane gun or dosha he, lekin vartmaan din main praudyogiki ke bina koi vikaas nahin ho saktaa
 Economic, social and human development depends on technological progress
 aadmi praudyogiki kii madad se apane jivan ko aasaan or behatar bana sakate hai, sanghathanon takanic ke saath adhik se adhik laabh kama sakate hai or aarthik samruddhi ke liye netritv kar sakate hai
 Lastly, would like to repeat what Arthur C
 Clarke said sattu ek prakaar kaa deshaj vyanjan he, jo bhune hue jau or chane ko pis kar banaaya jaataa he
 It is quite popular in Bihar and is used in many forms
 saamanytah yah churna ke rup main rahata he jise pani main ghol kar yaa anya roopon main khaaya athwa piya jaataa he
 Both dry and slurry forms of sattu are called 'sattu'
 sattu sirf chane kaa hi nahin jau kaa bhi banaaya jaataa he
 The above mentioned procedure is also done for barley extract
 nalwran yaa bhagandar ek rog he
 It is a disease
 guda dwaar par ek prakaar kii phoda se paidaa hokar yah guda dwaar ke andar tathaa baahar nalee ke rup main ghaav paidaa karata he
 In English, it is called Fischula
 yah phoda kuch dinon main foot jaataa he or usamen se mawaad tathaa dooshit rakt nikalne lagata he
 This abscess is sometimes very wide and deep
 is phode ke kaaran rogi vyakti ko gudadwar ke paas bahut tej dard hota he
 It causes tearing in the region of anus and perineum and therefore termed as bhagandar
 bhagandar rog hone kaa sabase pramukh kaaran yah he ki jab kisi vyakti ke maladwar ke paas koi phoda ban jaataa he or usamen jab kai munh ban jate hai or rogi vyakti is phode se chhedchhad karata he to use yah rog ho jaataa he
 Due to eating more spicy things, there is an abscess near the anus which takes the form of a catastrophe

 magaramachhon ke sangrakshan ke liye kukarail sangrakshit van ko viksit kiya gaya he
 Nowadays it is becoming popular as a picnic spot

 Economics is considered a mirror of Mauryan Indian society
 ], bhagwat aadi puraanon tathaa kathasaritsagar aadi sanskrit granthon main to chanakya kaa naam aayaa hi he, buddha grantho main bhi isaki katha baraabar milti he
 Chanakya's account has been given in the commentary of Vinayapitaka made by Buddhaghosh and the commentary of Mahanam Sthan, composed by Mahanam
 chanakya takshashila ke nivasee the
 The events of his life have a special connection with the accession of Maurya Chandragupta
 ye us samay ke ek prasiddh vidwaan the, isamen koi andeh nahin
 It is said that Chanakya used to live in a small hut away from the royal palace
 unke naam par ek dharawahik bhi bana tha jo doordarshan par 1990 ke dashak main dikhaaya jaataa tha
 The story of Chanakya's friendship with Chadragupta is as follows- patliputra ke raja nand yaa mahanand ke yahan koi yajna tha
 Chanakya also went there and sat down on a pradhan posture during the meal
 maharaj nand ne inkaa kaala rang dekh inhen asana par se uthva diya
 Enraged at this, he vowed that he would not tie his crest till i destroyed the Nandas

 kahin vishakanya bhejne kii katha likhi he
 It is known from the drama of Mudrarakshas drama that Chandragupta had great difficulties in getting the throne of Magadha due to the skill and policy of Mahananda's minister Rakshasa even when the Nanda was destroyed

 vah jivicoparjan kii khoj main uttar bharat aayaa tha
 According to some scholars, Kerala is also said to be his birthplace

 In some contexts it is mentioned that Vishnugupta, a resident of Kerala came to Varanasi for pilgrimage, where his daughter was lost

 Scholars who hold such views consider him to be a descendant of the Kutullur Namputri dynasty of Kerala

 Vk Subramaniam has said that in many contexts it is mentioned that Alexander had met the young Kautilya in his campaign of attack
 chunki alexander kaa akraman adhiktar takshashila kshetra main hua tha, isliye yah ummid kii jaati he ki kautilya kaa janm sthaan takshashila kshetra main hi rahaa hoga
 Kautilya's father's name was Chanak
 vah ek garib brahman tha or kisi tarah apana guzar-basar karata tha
 Therefore, it is clear that Kautilya's childhood must have gone through poverty and problems
 kautilya kii shiksha-diksha ke sambandh main kahin kuch vishesh zikr nahin miltaa he, parantu uski buddhi kaa prakharata or uski vidwata uske vichaaron se parilakshith hoti he
 Despite being ugly, he was physically strong
 uski pustak 'arthshaastra' ke avlokan se uski pratibha, uske bahuaiami vyaktitv or doordarshita kaa purna abhas hota he
 It is said about Kautilya that he was a man of very self-respect and temper
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar magadh ke raja mahanand ne shraadh ke avasar par kautilya ko apamaanit kiya tha
 Kautilya, under the influence of anger, opened his crest and vowed that he would not tie his crest till he destroyed the Nandavansh
 kautilya ke vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa yah bhi ek bada kaaran tha
 After the destruction of Nanda Dynasty, he gave all possible help to Chandragupta Maurya to sit on the throne
 chandragupta maury dwaara gaddi par asin hone ke baad use parakramee banane or maury samrajya kaa vistaar karne ke uddeshy se usne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 He also became the minister of Chandragupta Maurya
 kai vidwaanon ne yah kaha he ki kautilya ne kahin bhi apni rachana main mauryvansh yaa apane mantritv ke sambandh main kuch nahin kaha he, parantu adhikansh sroton ne is tathy kii sampushti kii he
 The vigorous king whom Kautilya portrays in 'arthashastra' has certainly been addressed to Chandragupta Maurya
 bharat par sikandar ke akraman ke kaaran chote-chote rajyon kii paraajay se abhibhoot hokar kautilya ne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 His paramount desire was to see India as a glorious and vast state
 nishchit rup se chandragupta maury uski ichha kaa kendra bindu tha
 Acharya Kautilya is considered as the founder and patron of the Mauryan Empire on the one hand as a well-known and visionary politician, on the other hand he has the distinction of being the only scholar of his subject due to his incomparable and wonderful work in the history of culture literature
 kautilya kii vidwata, nipunata or doordarshita kaa bakhaan bharat ke shastron, kaavyon tathaa anya granthon main parivyapt he
 The story related to the destruction of the Nanda dynasty by Kautilya and the establishment of the Maurya dynasty comes in the Vishnu Purana
 ati vidwaan or maury samrajya kaa mahaamantri hone ke baavjood kautilya kaa jivan saadagi kaa jivan tha
 He was the true symbol of 'plain Life High Thought'
 usne apane mantritvakaal main atyadhik saadagi kaa jivan bitaayaa
 He used to live in a small house and it is said that the walls of his house were covered with dung cakes
 uski manyata thi ki raja yaa mantri apane charitra or unche aadarshon ke dwaara logon ke saamne ek pratimaan de saktaa he
 He always followed the limits and lived a life of diligence
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main usne mantri pad tyagkar vanprastha jivan vyateet kiya tha
 In fact, he had no desire for money, fame and status
 saratatv main vah ek 'vitaragi', 'tapasvi, karmath or maryaadaaon kaa paalan karanevaala vyakti tha, jiskaa jivan aaj bhi anukaraniya he
 Kautilya is well known as a scholar and a serious thinker, he has also gained fame as a practical and clever politician
 nandavansh ke vinaash tathaa magadh samrajya kii sthapana evam vistaar main uskaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 According to Salatore's statement, Kautilya occupies a paramount place in ancient Indian political thought
 maikiyaveli kii bhanti kautilya ne bhi raajnneeti ko naitikta se pruthak kar ek swatantra shaastra ke rup main adhyayan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 As it goes kautilya kaa naam, janmatithi or janmasthan teenon hi vivaad ke vishay rahe hai
 There are differences among scholars regarding the name of Kautilya
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke pratham anuvadak pandit shaamasasthri ne kautilya naam kaa prayog kiya he
 To prove the authenticity of the name 'kautilya', Pandit Shamashastri has cited vishnu-purana which states- is sambandh main ek vivaad or utpann hua he or vah he kautilya or kautaly kaa
 Ganapathi Shastri has considered 'kautalya' more authentic than 'kautilya'
 unke anusaar kutal gotra hone ke kaaran kautaly naam sahi or sangat prathit hota he
 It has been said under functional ethics - sambashiv shastri ne kaha he ki ganapatishastri ne sambhawatah kautilya ko pracheen sant kutal kaa vanshaj maanakar kautaly naam kaa prayog kiya he, parantu is baat kaa kahin koi pramaan nahin miltaa he ki kautilya sant kutal ke vansh or gotra kaa tha
 The controversy of the names 'kautilya' and 'kautalya' has been raised by many scholars
 ve
 e
 ramasvami ne ganapatishastri ke kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Modern scholars have used both names
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautaly or kautilya naam ke vivaad ko adhik mahatva nahin diya he
 According to them, this kind of confusion can be due to the manipulation of the SIC
 adhikansh paashchaatya lekhakon ne kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Scholars in India have used both names, but mostly Kautilya
 is sambandh main radhakant kaa kathan bhi vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He has said in his composition 'shabdakalpadram' kautilya ke or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 In which the name Chanakya is famous
 kautilya ko chanakya ke naam se pukararane vaale kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki chaanak kaa putr hone ke kaaran yah chanakya kahalaaya
 On the other hand, according to the legend of some scholars, he was born in Chanak region of Punjab, hence he has been called Chanakya, although no clear evidence is found in this regard
 ek baat spasht he ki kautilya or chanakya ek hi vyakti he
 Apart from the above names, many other names are mentioned, such as Vishnugupta
 kaha jaataa he ki uskaa mul naam vishnugupt hi tha
 His father named him Vishnugupta
 kautilya, chanakya or vishnugupt teenon naamon se sambandhit kai sandarbh milte hai, kintu in teenon naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jaise vatsyayan, malang, dravimal, angul, varanak, katyan ityadi in bhinn-bhinn naamon main koun sa sahi naam he or koun-sa galat naam he, yah vivaad kaa vishay he
 But most Western and Indian scholars have used the name Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra'
 kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautilya ke astitv par hi prashnvachak chihn laga diya he
 The name Kautilya is symbolic, which is a symbol of diplomacy, according to the opinions of the Victorians, Jolly and Keith
 pantajali dwaara apane mahabhashya main kautilya kaa prasang nahin aane ke kaaran unke maton kaa samarthan mila he
 Jolly has even said that 'arthashastra' is not the work of a person named Kautilya
 yah kisi anya pandit yaa acharya kaa rachit granth he
 Both Shamashastri and Ganapathastri have refuted the views of Western thinkers
 donon kaa yah nishchay mat he ki kautilya kaa purna astitv tha, bhale hi uske naamon main matantar paaya jaataa ho
 In fact, the points raised by these three Western scholars to deny the existence of Kautilya are unrestrained and insignificant
 paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa yah kahana he ki kautilya ne is baat kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya he ki vah chandragupta maury ke shasankaal main amaatya yaa mantri tha, isliye us 'arthshaastra' kaa lekhan nahin mana ja saktaa he
 This is childish logic
 kautilya ke kai sandarbhon se yah spasht ho chukaa he ki usne chandragupta maury kii sahaayta se nandavansh kaa naash kiya tha or maury samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 Differences are also found among many scholars regarding Kautilya's works
 kautilya kii kitni kritiyaan hai, is sambandh main koi nishchit soochna uplabdh nahin he
 Kautilya's most important work is the discussion of Arthashastra everywhere, but there is no special mention in relation to other works
 chanakya ke shishy kaamandak ne apane 'nitisar' naamak granth main likhaa he ki vishnugupt chanakya ne apane buddhible se arthshaastra rupi mahodadhi ko mathkar nitishastra rupi amrit nikaala
 Chanakya's 'arthashastra' is a unique treatise on the subject of politics in Sanskrit
 iske niti ke shloke to ghar ghar prachlit hai
 From behind, people compiled many ethics from their policy texts, increasing the number of Vriddhachanakya, Minichanakya, Bodhichanakya etc
 chanakya sab vishyon ke pandit the
