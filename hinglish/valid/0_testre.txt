 In 1528 Babur suddenly hit Madarpur Invaded
 In this fierce war, all the people including Brahmins were killed
 In this massacre somehow Anantram Brahmin was killed
 The wife had escaped who later gave birth to a child and went away from this world
 This child was named Garbhu Tewari
 The people of Garbhu Tewari's family settled in many villages of Kanyakubj region
 Later on their descendants Uttar Pradesh and Settled in various villages of Bihar
 The descendants of Garbhu Tewari are called Bhumihar Brahmins
 All the Brahmins who had matrimonial contact with them were called Bhumihar Brahmins from time to time
 The British, after deep study of the social level of this place, mentioned the sub-classes of Bhumihars in their Gazetteers and other books
 Started migrating towards and settled here at his convenience
 The names of the people started to be addressed, such as - Dronewar, Gautam, Kanyakubj, Jetharia, etc
 For various reasons, subclasses were christened in many ways
 Nomenclature has been taken from their place like - name of people living on the banks of Sonbhadra river, Son Bharia, Sarvariya on the banks of river Saraswati, Sarayupari across river Saryu, etc
 Ku also in the name of Muldih

 haanazi athwa chini bhavchitra chini bhashaa or japani bhashaa likhane ke liye istemaal hone vaale bhavchitra hote hai
 When they are used for sugar, they are called Hanzhi and when used for Japanese, they are called Kanji
 puraane jamaane main inkaa prayog korian bhashaa or vietnami bhashaa ke liye bhi hota tha
 Chinese image is the oldest ongoing writing method of the world
 vaise to chini main dasiyon hazaar bhavchitra hai, lekin in main se adhiktar keval aitihaasik likhaaiyon main dekhne ko milte hai
 Studies have shown that it is enough to know three to four thousand images to be literate in ordinary Chinese
 har chini bhavchitra ke saath ek uccharan or ek arth judaa hota he or zyaadaatar chini shabd do bhavchitron ke saath likhe jate hai 
 Note that pronunciation varies with the language and language
 yah devanagari lipi ki tarah nahin he ki kisi akshar kaa har jagah vahi uccharan ho
 To understand this, think that if one sees the picture of a mountain, then everyone will understand it, but the Hindi-speaking person will say 'mountain', the Persian-speaking will say 'koh' and the English-speaking will say 'mountain'
 chini bhavchitron ke aksar do yaa teen rup hote hai: Over time, a lot of images had become popular and many of them were complicated to write, so the governments of Japan and China have made some standardizations and simplifications
 is se chini bhashaa ke bahut se shabdon ke do rup hote hai - parmparik chini rup or sarlikrut chini rup
 Japanese and Chinese forms of many words are also similar but slightly different
 chini bhavchitron kii kai shreniyan hoti hai: These were once used to be pictures, but to ease writing and standardize, their appearance has changed a bit
 udhaaharan swaroop, 人 yani 'vyakti', 日 yani 'suraj', 月 yani 'chaand' or 木 yani 'vriksh'
 About 4% of Chinese images belong to this category
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'pictogram' kehete hai
 This gives them other meanings by slightly tweaking the pictures
 jaise ki jahaan 木 kaa arth 'vriksh', vahaan do vrikshon ko jodakar 林 banataa he, jiskaa matlab ' jhuramut' he
 If three trees are written together, it means 'forest'
 usee tarah 刀 kaa matlab to 'chaaku' he lekin isaki dhar par nishaan lagane se 刃 banataa he, yani ' dhar'
 Words with new meanings have been created by making marks from zara-zara
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogram' kehete hai
 Words with new meanings are created by adding more than one picture or motif to them
 jaise ki 日 yani 'suraj' or 月 yani 'chaand' ko jodakar 明 yani 'roshan' banataa he
 If a person is attached to a tree, then 休 is formed, which means 'rest'
 isi tarah se 女 or 子 jodne se 好 banataa he, jiskaa arth 'acha' nirdhaarit hua he
 Although some linguists dispute this, another example of this is to combine the 安 sign for 'roof' with the 女 sign for 'woman', which means 'peace'
 aadhunik kaal main bhi aise nae bhavchitra zaroorat ke anusaar gadhe gaye hai
 Platinum is a valuable white metal, for which the image is 鉑, which is made up of 'white' and 'metal'
 usee tarah 'meter' or 'hazaar' ko milakar 粁 bana - yah unnisvi sadi ke ant ke aasapaas prayog hone laga
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogramic Compounds'
 kabhi-kabhi aisa hua he ki kisi chiz ke liye chihn nahin tha lekin us shabd kaa uccharan kisi or shabd se miltaa tha jiske liye bhavchitra tha, to vah chihn donon ke liye hi istemaal hone laga
 For example, in many Chinese languages, the word 'zee' also meant 'nose' and 'self'
 'naak' ke liye chihn 自 tha or vah 'swayan' ke liye bhi prayog hone laga
 With the passage of time, the meaning of the 'nose' has been forgotten and in modern Chinese script its meaning is left only to 'itself'
 is shrenee kaa naam 'reebus' angrezi se liya gaya he
 Most of the words in Chinese script belong to this category
 inamen ek yaa ek se adhik chihn aise hote hai jo shabd kaa arth bataate hai or ek bhavchitra aisa hota he jiskaa arth se koi lenaa-dena nahin lekin yah kisi aisi chiz kaa chihn hota he jiskaa uccharan is shabd se miltaa-julata ho
 With this, both the pronunciation and the meaning of the word are known
 udahaaran ke liye 'nadi', 'jhil', 'jharnaa', 'bahut jabardast pani kii dhar, yaa flash kiya gaya pani' or 'phislan' 
 Consider that there are three small ridges on the left side of each sign, which is made by simplifying the picture of 'river'
 is se sanket miltaa he ki shabd 'pani' se sambandhit he
 The right side of the word tells only the sound
 沖 ke dai taraf 中 he, jiskaa arth chini main 'bich' hota he or uccharan 'jhong' hota he
 It can be seen that 沖 is saying 'word related to water, which is pronounced from Zhong', ie 'chong'
 angrezi main aise bhavchitron ke arth bataane vaale hisse ko 'radical' bolte hai or is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'phono-simantic compoundj' kehete hai
 The expressions in this category were first developed during the Shang dynasty and have been found scratched on the bones found in the ruins of that time
 kabhi-kabhi do bhavchitron se ek shabd banataa he jisamen arthbhaag donon bhavchitron par lagu hota he
 For example, there is a Chinese musical instrument, 'beeva' and a fruit is 'lokat'
 in donon ke aakaar dekhne main milte hai
 Biwa was written as 批 把, in which the sign of a hand moving up and down on either side of the two signs is indicated, that is, playing the instrument by moving the hand up and down
 ab isamen 'haath' kaa arthbhaag badalakar 'ped' kaa radical lagane se 枇杷 kaa chihn bana 
 This new two-faced word meant 'fruit of the laukat'
 samay ke saath biva vaadya ke chihn swayan hi badal gaye or aadhunik chini main 琵琶 hai 
 Homogeneous words in languages are those that were once the same but over time their vowels have diverged and sometimes meanings have also changed
 udhaaharan ke liye sanskrit kaa 'pati' shabd or angrezi kaa 'potent' shabd ek hi aadim hind-europea bhashaa ke shabd se utpann hue hai, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or arthon donon main zaraa fark aa gaya he
 This has happened in the Chinese language also
 masalan 'kaao' or 'lao' kabhi ek hi shabd hua karte the, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or bhavchitra donon ek-dusre se bhinn ho gaye hai
 The expressions in this category are few in Chinese script and in English this category is called 'transformed Cognates'

 Chhayavad is that poetic stream of the romantic rise of Hindi literature which circa AD From 1918 to 1936, there was a major epoch
 atmabhivyakti, prakruti prem, nari prem, maanvikaran, saanskrithik jaagran, kalpana kii pradhanta aadi chhayavaadi kavy kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Chhayavad fully distinguished the standing poetry in Hindi
 iske baad brajabhasha hindi kavy dhara se baahar ho gai
 It gave new words, symbols and images to Hindi
 iske prabhaav se is daur kii gadhy kii bhashaa bhi samrudh hui
 The era of Shadowism in Hindi poetry came after the Dwivedi era
 dvivedi yug kii kavita neeras upadeshaatmak or itivrittatmak thi
 Kalpnapradhan, rebellious poetry was composed while revolting against it in shadowism
 yah bhashaa or bhaavon ke str par apane daur ke bangla ke suprasiddh kavi or nobel puraskaar vijeta rabindranath thakur kii gitanjali se bahut prabhavit hui
 It was also influenced by ancient Sanskrit literature and medieval Hindi literature
 isamen buddha darshan or sufi darshan kaa bhi prabhaav lakshith hota he
 The Shadow Age was a universal development of the cultural and literary awakening that began in the national periphery with Bharatendu Yug
 kavi ke keval sookshm bhavatmak darshan kaa hi nahin, 'chaaya' se uske sookshm kalabhivyajan kaa bhi parichay miltaa he
 His poetry has semiotics and phonetics rather than speech
 anubhuti kii nigudhata ke kaaran asphutata bhi he
 There is a new sense of raga in the style or a new expression
 dvivedi yug main kavita kaa dhaanchaa padya kaa tha
 In fact, only the management of prose was translated into it, the language also became prose
 chhayavaad ne padya kaa dhaanchaa todakar khadi boli ko kaavyatmak bana diya
 The poem had a voluminous history, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional encapsulation, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional intonation
 bhav ke anuroop hi chhayavaad kii bhashaa or chand bhi ragaatmak or rasaatmak ho gaya
 Brijbhasha was followed by the revival of lyricism by Chhayavada
 chhayavaad yug ke pratinidhi kavi hai- prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi, ramkumar
 The foregoing associates are Makhanlal and 'naveen'
 geetkavy ke baad chhayavaad main bhi mahakavy kaa nirmaan hua
 Tulsidas, like 'swant', had moved on the path of the Lok Sangraha, in the same way, the poet of Chhayavad has moved from the private world of solitude to the public world with respect to 'swatam'
 prasad kii 'kamayani' or pant kaa 'lokayatan' iskaa pramaan he
 'kamayani' is towards Vindu in the Indus, 'lokayatan' is towards the Indus in Vindu
 sanwat 1917 ke aasapaas maithilisharan gupt, mukutadhar pandeya aadi kavi khadiboli kavy ko adhik kalpanamay, chitramay or antarbhaav vyanjak rup-rang dene main pravrutt hue yah svachhnd or nutan paddati apana rasta nikaal rahi thi ki rabindranath kii rahasyatmak kavitaaon kii dhooma hui
 And many poets simultaneously turned to solitude as mysticism and symbolism or pictorialism
 chitrabhasha yaa abhivyanjan paddati par hi jab lakshya tik gaya tab uske pradarshan ke liye loukik yaa alokik prem kaa kshetra hi baaki samajha gaya
 Poetry moving within this bounded area assumed the name Chhayavad
 chhayavaadi shabd kaa prayog do arthon main samajhnaa chaiye
 One is in the sense of mysticism, where it relates to the poetic object, that is, where the poet consults that infinite and unknown beloved in many ways in a very pictorial language
 is arth kaa doosraa prayog kavy-style yaa paddati-vishesh ke vyapak arth main hota he’ chhayavaad kaa saamanytah arth hua prastut ke sthaan par uski vyanjana karanevaali chaaya ke rup main aprastut kaa kathan
 Shadowism was practiced as a reaction to the dry chronicles of the Dwivedi period
 jaise, dhul kii dheri main anjaane, chhipe hai mere madhumay gaan
 The perception of spiritual shadow in the subtle but expressed beauty of nature, i think, should be a universally accepted interpretation of Shadowism
 ’ At the end of the Second World War, a wave of new consciousness raged all over the country
 san 1929 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main bharatvarsh videshi gulaami ko jhaad-phenkane ke liye katibaddh ho gaya

 yah sampurna desh kaa aatm swaroop samajhane kaa praytn tha or apni galatiyon ko sudhaar kar sansar kii samrudh jatiyon kii prati- dwandvita main agrasar hone kaa sankalp tha
 In short, it was a great cultural movement
 chittagat unmukhataa is kavita kaa pradhan udgam thi or badalte hue maano ke prati drudh aasthaa iskaa pradhan sambal
 The poets of this category were highly endowed with talent and were highly conscious of social disparities and inconsistencies
 style kii drushti se bhi ye pehle ke kaviyon se ekadam bhinn the
 His work was predominantly thematic
 san 1920 kii khadiboli kavita main vishaywastu kii pradhanta bani hui thi
 But in the poem that follows, the poet's own raga-vigyan prevailed
 vishay apane aap main kaisaa he ? yah mukhya baat nahin thi
 Rather the main thing remained that how does the subject look after the subject is stunned by the raga-viraga? As a result, the subject became secondary and the poet was the chief
 1920 ke aasapaas, yug kii udbuddha chetana ne bahya abhivyakti se niraash hokar, jo atmbaddh antarmukhi sadhana aarambh kii, vah kavy main chhayavaad ke rup main abhivyakt hui’ Whatever the meaning of the word Chhayavad, but in practical terms it represents all the poems of Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi which were written between 1918 and 36 AD
 ’ ve aage likhte hai- ‘chhayavaad us rashtriya jaagran kii kaavyatmak abhivyakti he jo ek ore puraani rudhiyon se mukti chahta tha or duusari ore videshi paradheenata se
 ' ‘kavy ke kshetra main puranic yug kii kisi ghatana athwa desh-videsh kii sundari ke bahya varnan se bhinn jab vednaa ke aadhaar par swanubhutimayi abhivyakti hone lagi tab hindi main use chhayavaad naam se abhihit kiya gaya
 'prasad ji says in the end- From the Indian point of view the cinematic poem relies more on perception and expression
 dhvanyaatmakataa, lakshanikta, saundarya, prakruti-vidhaan tathaa upachaar vakrata ke saath swanubhuti kii vivritti chhayavaad kii visheshtaayen hai
 ' chhayavaad ko paashchaatya sahitya ke romantisism se prabhavit maanate hai
 She considers the basic philosophy of cinematism as totalism and nature as its means
 unke chhayavaad ne manushya ke hrruday or prakruti ke us sambandh main praan daal die jo pracheen kaal se bimb-pratibimb ke rup main chalaa aa rahaa tha or jiske kaaran manushya ko prakruti apane dukh main udhaas or sukh main pulakit jaan padati thi’is prakaar mahadevi ke anusaar chhayavaad kii kavita hamaara prakruti ke saath ragaatmak sambandh sthapit karake hamaare hrruday main vyapak bhavanubhuti utpann karti he or ham samast vishwa ke upkarnon se ekatm bhav sambandh jod lete hai
 She considers mysticism to be the second step of cinematism
 chhayavaad kii pramukh pravritiyon kaa vibhaajan ham teen yaa do sheershakon ke antargat kar sakate hai
 All the poets in Shadowism have expressed their experience as my experience
 yah bhaktikalin atmabhivyakti se do staron par bhinn he
 On one hand, self-expression in Shadowism has been greater than in any previous literature
 doosraa iske liye kaviyon ne koi roopak yaa koi aavaran dhaaran nahin kiya he
 He has also written a poem on Prem, calling it his love
 pant ne ‘balika meri manoram mitra thi’ likhaa to niraala ne ‘main akelaa’
 Woman-beauty and love-portrayal The poetical poets have considered woman to be an icon of love
 unhone nari ko preyasi ke rup main grahan kiya jo yauvan or hrruday kii sampurna bhaawanaaon se paripurna he
 In which the beauty of the earth and the imaginary Sushma of heaven are coordinated
 atah in kaviyon ne preyasi ke kai chitra ankit kiye hai
 In Kamayani, Prasad fills magic in portraying Shraddha
 chhayavaadi kaviyon kaa prem bhi vishisht he
 The best description of nature beauty and its love is also a notable feature of the cinematic poets
 beeti vibhavari jaag ri,ambar panghat main duubo rahithara ghat ushaa nagari
 or divsavsaan kaa samaymeghmay aasmaan seutar rahi That evening beauty fairy-c slowly
 svachhndatavaadi pravriti is pravriti kaa prarambh shridhar pathak kii kavitaaon se hota he
 The nature of verse, manner of expression and observation of the nature of nature etc
 trends appeared in Chāyavad
 saath-saath swanubhuti kii pratyaksh vivritti, jo vyaktigat pranay se lekar karunaa or anand tak faili hui he
 Critics have pointed out the effect of freedom on shadowism, and on the other hand have also opposed it
 svachhndathawad kii yah pravriti deshgat, kaalgat, rudhiyon ke viruddh hameshaa rahati hai
 Wherever there are bonds, the freedomist poet opposes these trends at all levels of society, state, poetry and life
 angreji sahitya main svachhndatavaadi kavy se pehle kathor anushaasan tha or uskaa rup dharmik, naitik or kavyashastreey bhi tha
 Therefore, the English poets despised these bonds
 lekin chhayavaadi kaviyon se purv dvivediyug main naitik drushti kii pradhanta milti he or chhayavaadi main uskaa virodh bhi dikhaai detaa he
 The shadowy tendency was not that of Swachand Pranay but of revivalists
 kyonki reetikalin shringaar-chithran kaa us par prabhaav he
 Where philosophical principles are concerned, the expression of the old principles of Sarvaism, Karmism, Vedanta, Shaivism, Advaitism etc
 is found in the Chhayavadi poetry
 jahaan tak bhashaa-style kaa sawaal he, chhayavaadi kii abhivyanjana paddati naveen or tazaa he
 There is more coherence, descriptiveness in the Dwivediugin Khadiboli
 parantu chhayavaadi kavy main sookshmata ke nirupan ke kaaran upachaar-vakrata or maanvikaran kii visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 Dwivediyugin poetry is subjective, narrative-oriented and macro, while cinematic poetry is subjective and imaginative
 dvivediyugin kavita main sristi kii vyapaktaa or anekarupata ko sameta gaya he
 Similarly, in the poetry of Shadowism, there is an attempt to reveal the eloquence of the occult
 manojgat ke sookshm satya ko saakaar karne ke liye chhayavaadi kaviyon ne urvara kalpanaashakti kaa upyog kiya he
 Shadowism has an influence ranging from Vedanta to Anandaism
 isamen buddha or gandhi darshan kii bhi jhalak milti he

 The transfer of heat from a hot body to a cold body is called heat transfer
 jab kisi vastu kaa taapmaana uske parivesh yaa anya vastu kii apeksha bhinn hota he to taap urja kaa sanchaar jise taap kaa bahaav yaa taap kaa vinimay bhi kehete hai, is tarah se hota he ki vah vastu or uskaa parivesh ooshm-samyata grahan kar lete hai; iskaa matlab he ki donon kaa taapmaana samaan ho jaataa he
 According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics or Clausius' statement, heat always transports from a warmer object to a colder one
 jahaan kahin bhi paas-paas sthit vastuon main taapmaana kii bhinnata hoti he, unke bich ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko kabhi roka nahin ja saktaa; ise keval kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Conduction of heat through direct contact with particles in matter is called conduction
 urja kaa sanchaar praathmik rup se sunamya samaghaat dwaara jaise dravon main yaa paraasaran dwaara jaisaa ki dhaatuon main hota he yaa phonon kampan dwaara jaisaa ki insulatoron main hota he, ho saktaa he
 In other words, when the surrounding atoms vibrate towards each other, or electrons move from one atom to another, heat is transmitted by conduction
 sanchaalan thos padaarthon main adhik hota he, jahaan parmaanuon ke bich apekshaakrit sthir sthanik sambandhon kaa jaal kampan dwaara unke bich urja ke sanchaar main madad karata he
 In a situation where the flow of fluid is not happening at all, the heat conductance corresponds directly to the osmosis of particles in the fluid
 is prakaar kaa taap paraasaran bartaav main thoson main hone vaale pindia paraasaran se bhinn hota he, jabaki pindia paraasaran adhiktar dravon tak hi simit hota he
 Metals are generally the best conductors of heat energy
 aisa dhaatuon ke rasaynic rup se bandhit hone ke tareeke ke kaaran hota he; dhatvik baandon main mukt rup se chalane vaale electron hote hai jo taap urja kaa teji se dhaatu main sanchaar kar sakate hai
 As the density decreases, the operation also decreases
 isaliye, drav kam sanchaalak hote hai
 This is due to greater distance between atoms in the gas: less collision between atoms means less conduction
 The conductivity of gases increases with temperature
 The conductivity of gases increases with the increase in pressure from the vacuum to a critical point until the density of the gas is so high that the molecules of the gas collide with each other before transmitting heat from one surface to another
 After this point in density, conductance increases slightly with increasing pressure and density
 is baat kii gananaa karne ke liye ki koi vishesh madhyam kitni aasaani se sanchaalan karata he, ejeeniyar ooshm sanchaalakata kaa prayog karte hai, jise sanchaalakata constent yaa sanchaalan gunak, k bhi kehete hai
 The definition of k in thermal conductivity is - 'the amount of heat transmitted from a surface to a thickness in the general direction from the surface of a place in time due to the variation in temperature, Q'
 Thermal conductivity is a material property that is primarily dependent on the state of the medium, temperature, density, and molecular binding
 taap nalee ek niskriy upkaran he jiskaa nirmaan is tarah se kiya jaataa he ki jisase aisa prathit hota he ki usamen atyant ucch ooshm sanchaalakata he
 In steady state operation, the heat entering a part is equal to the heat coming out of it
 sthir avasthaa ke sanchaalan main sidhe pravaah ke vidyut sanchaalan ke sabhi niyam ‘ushma ke pravaah’ par lagu hote hai
 In such cases, 'heat adverse' can be considered similar to electrical adverseities
 taapmaana voltage kii bhoomika nibhaataa he or sanchaarit taap vidyut pravaah kaa samadharmi he
 Whenever the internal heat operation of an object is much faster than the heat operation of its boundary, volatile operation can be estimated by mass system analysis
 yah upgaman vidhi asthir sanchaalan pranali ke ek pahalu ko uchit rup se gata detii he In this method, a term called the Beot number is calculated which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of the heat conduction at the boundary of the same protrusion to the temperature of an object and the internal conductor heat barrier of the object
 jab thermal pratirodh garmi ke uddeshy main sthanantarit karne ke liye pratirodh garmi se bhi kam kii ja rahi vastu ke bheetar puri tarah se visarit, kam se kam Biot sankhya 1
 is maamle main, chote ke liye bhi vishesh rup se Biot hai sankhya he, jo vastu bheetar spatially vardi taapmaana ke sanniktan vastu kiya ja saktaa he shuru karne ke liye upyog kiya he, ke baad se kar sakate hai yah maan liya he ki garmi main tabadalaa kar hi vitarit kiya uniformaly samay ke liye, kam karne ke liye kaaran aisa karne ke liye pratirodh ke rup main, pratirodh ke saath tulana karne ke liye object main pravesh garmi
 Usefully the Beot number should generally be less than 0
1 for the correct design and heat communication analysis
 Newton's law of coolness derives from the mathematical solution of mass system design, which is described below
 vishleshan kii is vidhi kaa prayog nyaayalayik vigyaan main manushyon kii mrityu ke samay kaa vishleshan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in HVAC to determine the almost instantaneous effects of changes in the comfort level environment
 kisi padaarth ke ek bhaag se duusare main anuon ke jane se hue taap urja ke sanchaar ko sanvaahan kehete hai
 Convective heat circulation also increases as the speed of the liquid increases
 drav ke pariman main gati kii upasthiti thos sataha or taral ke bich taap ke sanchaar ko badhaava detii he
 There are two types of conductive heat transmission: sanvaahan ko aantarik or bahya pravaah ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Internal flow occurs when the liquid is locked in a solid, such as the flow in a pipe
 External flow occurs when a liquid expands indefinitely without coming into contact with a solid surface
 ye dono sanvaahan, chaahe ve prakritik hon yaa balaat, aantarik yaa bahya ho sakate hai kyonki ve ek duusare se swatantra hote hai
 The rate of conductive heat exchange is given as: a taap sanchaar kisatah kaa kshetrafal he
 t s is the surface temperature and t b is the temperature of the liquid at the bulk temperature
 lekin t b sthiti ke anusaar badalata rahata he or sataha se ‘bahut dur’ sthit taral kaa taapmaana he
 h is a constant heat transmission multiplier that depends on the physical properties of the liquid such as temperature and the physical state in which the convection occurs
 isaliye har vishleshit pranali ke liye taap sanchaar gunak prayog dwaara praapt kiya janaa chaiye
 adarsh sanrachanaon or taralon ke liyetaap sanchaar gunakon kii gananaa karne ke liye kai sutara or sahasambandh uplabdh hai
 The heat transmission coefficient for thin layer flows is lower than for turbulent flows; This is due to the turbulent currents having a more thin fixed layer of liquid on the heat exchanging surface
 taap urja ke kisi rikt sthaan main sanchaar ko vikiran kehete he
 All objects with temperatures above absolute zero radiate energy equal to the rate at which the energy is radiated, if they are a black object
 vikiran ke liye kisi madhyam kii jarurat nahin he kyonki iskaa sanchaar vidyutchumbakeey tarangon dwaara hota he; vikiran purna nirvaat main bhi kaary karata he
 The energy of the Sun passes through the vacuum of space before heating the Earth
 sabhi pindon kii paravartakata or pravaahakta dono hi tarangadairghy par nirbhar karti hai
 According to Planck's Law of black-body radiation, the temperature determines the distribution of the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the extent of intensity
 kisi bhi pind ke liye paravartakata bheetar aa rahe vidyutchumbakeey vikiran ke tarangadairghy ke vitaran or isaliye vikiran ke strot ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he
 The conductivity depends on the distribution of wavelength and therefore on the temperature of the body
 udaa

5 micrometer ke sheersh urja tarangadairghy vaale suryaprakash ko paravartit karne ke kaaran safed dikhti he
 But at a temperature around −5 ° c and peak energy wavelength of 12 micrometers, its conductivity is 0
99
 gaisen tarangadairghy ke vishisht pratimaanon main, jo har gas ke liye bhinn hote hai, urja kaa avasorana or utsarjan karti hai
 Visible light is another type of electromagnetic radiation that has a shorter wavelength than infrared radiation
 dikhne vaale prakaash or paramparaagat taapamanon kii vastuon se hone vaale vikiran main aavruti or tarangadairghy main kareeb 20 ke gunak kii bhinnata hoti he; dono prakaar ke utsarjan keval vidyutchumbakeey vikiran ke vibhinn "rang" hote he
 Light colors and white objects and metallic materials reduce the absorption of light, and are therefore less hot, but otherwise at everyday temperatures, color has no specific effect on the heat communication between an object and its surroundings, as potent
 The emitted wavelengths are not near the visible spectrum, but rather far away in infrared
 in tarangadairdhyon par maujuud utsargataaon kaa dikhne vaali utsarjanataon se koi sambandh nahin hota; sudur infrared main adhiktar vastuon main ucch utsarjanataayen hoti hai
 Therefore, the color of clothing has no effect on heat, except in sunlight; Similarly, there is no difference in the color of the paint applied to the houses, except for the part on which sunlight falls
 iskaa mukhya apwaad he, chamakdaar dhatvik satahen jinamein darshneey tarangadairdhyon or sudur infrared, dono main kam utsarjanataayen hoti hai
 Such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transmission in both directions; An example of this is the multi-stage separator used to isolate the spacecraft
 makaanon main lagaai jane vaali kam-utsarjanata vaali khidkiyaan adhik jatil takanic se bani hoti hai kyonki unamem darshneey roshni main paardarshak rahete hue garm tarangadairdhyon par kam utsarjanata honi padati he
 Finally, it is possible for the heat or cold to flow from one place to another through physical communication
 yah kisi bottle main garm pani daalkar aapke bistar ko garm karne yaa himkhand ke bahane se samudr kii tarangon ke badalane jitna aasaan he
 a related theory, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is the rate of heat loss of an object in proportion to the difference between the temperature of that object and its ambient temperature
 This rule is given as a specific equation: taap hraas sutara kaa yah prakaar kabhi-kabhi adhik sahi nahin hota; bilkul sahi sutara ke liye asamroop yaa kam sanchaalak madhyam main taap sanchaar sameekaran par aadhaarit taap pravaah ke vishleshan kii jarurat hoti he
 a consistent Fourier's law of consecutive permutations
 vastu kii sataha sanchaalakata ko aantarik taap sanchaalakata se sambandhit karne vaale bayot number kii sahmati ke anusaar nimna sarleekaran kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 By this ratio, it is found that the object has a relatively high internal conductivity, allowing the entire object to remain at the same temperature, although this temperature varies when the atmosphere is cooled from outside
 aisa hone par, ye paristhitiyaan vastu ke taapmaana main samay ke saath ghaatankeey hraas utpann karti hai
 In this case, the whole body is assumed to be a mass capacitance heat collector whose total heat volume is directly proportional to the simple total heat capacity c and the body temperature T, or q = CT
 The definition of heat capacity c gives the relation c = dq / dt
 is sameekaran ko samay ke sandarbh main vishleshit karne se nimna pahchaan milti he: dq / dt = c 
 is vyanjana ko upar is khand ke prarambh main diye gaye pehle sameekaran main dq / dt ke sthaan par prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Then, if t is the temperature of such a body at time t and the temperature of the atmosphere of the body is tenv: to: r = ha / c is a positive constant characteristic of a system that must be in the unit of 1 / time, and is therefore sometimes expressed as a specific time constant t0: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 In heating systems like this, t0 = c / ha
 is prakaar uparokt sameekaran upyogi rup se is tarah se bhi likhaa ja saktaa he: The solution to this equation is by ideal methods of inclusion and displacement of boundary conditions: yahan, tii tii tii main samay taapmaana he or main shunya samay, t = 0 yaa tii taapmaana praarambhik he
 "if" tab neutonian samaadhaan ke rup main likhaa he: Uses: For simplified weather models, a neutral cooling can be used in place of the full radiation code to maintain atmospheric temperatures
 taap sanchaar prayogon main ek atyant upyogi siddhant he, taap sanchaar kaa taap circuiton dwaara pratinidhitiv
 taap circuit taap ke pravaah ke pratirodh kaa is tarah se pratinidhitiv he jaise vah koi vidyut resister ho

 There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia
 retrogred amenesia kisi vishesh taarikh se pehle adhigrahit kii gai jaankaree ko punarprapt karne main asamarthta he, aamtaur par durghatana yaa sanchaalan kii taarikh
 In some cases memory loss may extend for decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory

 Typical causes of amnesia are: Electroconvulsive therapy jisamen chikitsakeey prabhaav ke liye rogiyon main daure vidyut rup se prerit hote hai, donon pratikruti or antrogred amenesia sahit teevr prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Alcohol can both cause blackouts and have a detrimental effect on memory formation
 prakaar Anterograde amnesia is an inability to create new memories due to brain damage, whereas long-term memories are retained before the event
 mastishk kaa nuksaan dirghakaalik sharaab, gambhir kuposhan, stroke, sir aghat, anseflitis, surgery, varnikik-corsacof syndrome, cerebrovascular ghatnaon, anoksia yaa anya aghat ke prabhaavon ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 The two brain regions related to this condition are the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon

 One may be able to encode new memories after the event
 retrogred aam taur par hippocampus ke alaava mastishk ke kuch hisson main sir ke aghat yaa mastishk ke nuksaan ke kaaran hota he
 The hippocampus is responsible for new memory encoding
 episodic memory arthpurna smriti se prabhavit hone kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The damage is usually due to head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism
 pratikruti amenesia se peedit logon ko vishistataaon ke bajaay saamaanya gyaan yaad rakhane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but becoming stronger over time will make it easier to remember old memories
 retrogred amenesia aamtaur par asthaayee hota he or unhen nuksaan se yaadon ko ujagar karke ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 Another type of consolidation occurs over a longer period of time / day, weeks, months, and years and possibly involves more permanent storage sites in the cortex in transferring information from the hippocampus
 is dirghakaalik samekan prakriya kaa sanchaalan hippocample kshati vaale marijon ke retrogred amenesia main dekha jaataa he jo apekshaakrit saamaanya rup se bachapan se yaadon ko yaad kar sakate hai, lekin jab ve amejan banane ke kuch hi varshon pehle hue anubhavon ko yaad karte hai to ve prabhavit hote hai
 Post-traumatic amnesia is usually caused by a head injury
 dardanaak amliya aksar kshanik hota he, lekin yah sthaayee yaa yaa to antrogred, retrogred, yaa mishrit prakaar ho saktaa he
 The extent of duration covered by amnesia is related to the degree of injury and may indicate prognosis for recovery of other functions
 maamuli aghat, jaise car durghatana, jiske parinamswaroop halke wheeplash se adhik nahin hota he, short / dderghaavadhi memory transfar maikenism main thodi der ke baadha ke kaaran durghatana se thik pehle kisi car ke maalik ko kshanon kii yaad nahin aati he

 Formerly known as "psychogenic Amnesia"
 vishakt fugu ko fugu rajya bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is caused by psychological trauma and is usually temporary and unresolved, and can therefore return

 Lacunar amnesia is a loss of memory about a specific event
 bachapan main amliya apane bachapan se ghatnaon ko yaad rakhane main saamaanya aakshamata he
 Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed it to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches usually attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology including language development, which is why people can easily identify pre-language phenomena
 Don't remember shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki nihit yaadon ko yaad yaa varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Remembering how to play the piano is a common example of sole memory, such as walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to notice if they were to be released each time they woke up in the morning
 duusari taraf, spasht yaaden, shabdon main yaad or varnit kii ja sakati hai
 Remembering a teacher for the first time is an example of clear memories
 kshanik vaishvik amliya ek acchhee tarah se varnit chikitsa or naidanik ghatana he
 This form of amnesia differs in that abnormalities in the hippocampus can sometimes be transmitted to a particular form of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain called diffusion-weighted imaging

 Patients are usually redundant of events more than a few minutes in the past, although immediate recall is usually preserved
 strot bhulbhulaiya yaad rakhane main asamarthta he ki tathyaatmak gyaan ko banaae rakhte hue, kab yaa kaise pehle se siikhaa gaya jaankaree hasil kii gai he
 Korsakoff syndrome can result from chronic alcoholism or malnutrition
 yah vitamin bi 1 kii kami ke kaaran mastishk kii kshati ke kaaran hota he or sharaab kaa seven or poshan pattern sanshodhit nahin hone par pragatisheel hoga
 Other neurological problems are likely to be present in combination with this type of amnesia
 Korsakoff syndrome bhi confabulation se judaa hua janaa jaataa he
 The person's short-term memory may seem normal, but the person may have a difficult time trying to recall the back story, or unrelated words, as well as complex patterns
 drug-prerit emnesia jaanboojhkar ek anaavashyak dawa ke injection ke kaaran hota he taaki rogi ko surgery yaa chikitsa prakriyaaon ko bhuulane main madad mil sake, vishesh rup se purna sangyaaharan ke tahat nahin kiya jaataa he, yaa vishesh rup se dardanaak hone kii sambhaavna he
 Such drugs are also known as "premedicants"

 The short time-frame memories in which the process was performed are permanently lost or at least significantly reduced, but once the drug is worn, memory is no longer affected
 sthiti-vishisht amliya vibhinn paristhitiyon main utpann ho sakati he jiske parinamswaroop PTSD hoti he
 It has been claimed that this involves narrowing of consciousness with a focus on central perceptual details and / or that emotional or traumatic events are processed differently from normal memories

 It has been identified as a treatment-responsive syndrome conducive to anti-epileptic drugs
 amliya ke kai roopon kaa ilaaj kiye bina khud ko thik karen
 However, if this is not the case, there are some ways to deal with memory loss
 in tareekon main se ek sangyanatmak yaa vyavsaayik therapy he
 In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they possess and try to regain what they have lost, to learn which techniques help to recover memories or to create new recovery paths
 isamen jaankaree ko vyavasthit karne ke liye ranneetiyon ko or adhik aasaani se yaad rakhane or lambii baatcheet kii samaj main sudhaar ke liye ranneetiyaan shaamil ho sakati hai
 Another coping mechanism is taking advantage of technical support, such as personal digital devices, to keep track of day-to-day tasks
 dawaaon, janmdin or anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon ko lene ke liye, niyuktiyon ke liye anusmarak sthapit kiye ja sakate hai
 Many pictures can also be stored to help remember the names of friends, family and colleagues
 notebook, diwaar calendar, goli anusmarak or logon or sthanon kii tasviren kam takanic memory aids hai jo bhi madad kar sakati hai
 While no drugs are available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory
 aisi sthitiyon main mastishk main kam thyroid fnction, yakrut yaa gurde kii beemaari, stroke, avsaad, dwidhruviya vikaar or rakt ke thakke tak simit nahin hai
 wernicke-korsakoff syndrome involves changing this vitamin by consuming thiamine deficiency and thiamine-rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes, nuts, lean pork, and yeast
 sharaab kaa ilaaj or alcohol or avaidh dawaaon ke upyog ko rokane se or nuksaan ho saktaa he, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main khoi hui smriti ko thik nahin kiya jayega
 Although improvements occur when patients receive some treatment, there is no real remedy for amnesia so far

 The French psychologist module-armand Ribot was one of the first scientists to study amnesia
 unhone ribots lau kaa prastaav diya jo kahata he ki retrogred amenesia main samay dhaal he
 The law follows the logical progression of memory loss due to illness
 sabase pehle, ek rogi haal kii yaadon, phir vyaktigat yaaden, or antat bauddhik yaaden kho detaa he
 He implied that the most recent memories were lost earlier
 cese studies ne amnesia kii khoj or mastishk ke kuch hisson kii khoj main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 The studies gave important insights into how the brain is affected

, and G
D
 henry molison Henry Molaison, formerly known as HM, made people think of memory

 He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy due to a bicycle accident at the age of nine
 chikitsak dawaaon ke saath apane daure ko niyantrit karne main asamarth the, isliye neurosrjan scovil ne mastishk surgery se jude ek nae drushtikon kii koshish kii
 He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by performing a temporal lobectomy
 unke mirgee main sudhaar hua, lekin molison ne nai dirghakaalik yaaden banane kii kshamta kho di
 They displayed normal short-term memory capacity
 agar unhen shabdon kii suchi di gai, to vah unhen lagbhag ek minute ke samay main bhul jaaenge
 In fact, he would forget that he was also given a list in the first place
 ek baar molison ne soochiyon ke bare main sochane se roak diya to vah unhen dirghakaalik smriti se phir se yaad karne main asamarth tha
 This gave evidence to researchers that short-term and long-term memory are actually two distinct processes
 bhale hi vah soochiyon ke bare main bhul gaya, phir bhi vah apni antarnihit smriti ke madhyam se chizon ko seekhney main sakasham tha
 Psychologists will ask them to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror
 haalanki vah kabhi bhi us kaary ko kabhi yaad nahin rakh saktaa tha, phir bhi vah baar-baar aisa karne ke baad sudhaar karegaa
 This showed psychologists that he was unconsciously learning and memorizing things
 amenesia ke bare main adhik jaanane ke liye adhyayan molison ke jivan bhar main lagaataar puraa ho gaye
 The researchers conducted a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison
 unhone apni bhulbhulaiya ke bare main or jaanane ke liye do saptaah kii avadhi ke liye adhyayan kiya
 After 14 years, Molaison still could not remember the things that happened after his surgery
 haalanki, vah abhi bhi un chizon ko yaad kar saktaa tha jo oparation se pehle hua tha
 Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but could not recall his personal memories
 unki mrityu ke baad molison ne apane mastishk ko vigyaan main daan diya, jahaan ve mastishk ke un kshetron ko khojane main sakasham the jinke ghaavon main unki bhul hoti he
 This case study provided important insights for areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works

 But Pakistan did not tolerate that any Muslim-majority province should remain in India
 so 1947-48 main pakistan ne kabaili or apni chhadam sena se kashmir main akraman karavaaya or kaafi hissaa hathiyaa liya
 At that time Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru approached Mohammad Ali Jinnah to resolve the dispute by referendum, which Jinnah rejected at that time because he was confident of his military action
 maharaja ne sheikh abdulla kii sahmati se bharat main kuch sharton ke tahat vilay kar diya

 It is well known that Pandit Nehru and Mountbatten had a special relationship, which was not in common with any Indian Congressman or Muslim leader
 pandit nehru ke prayaason se hi mountabeton ko swatantra bharat kaa pehla garvanar general banaaya gaya, jabaki jinna ne mountabeton ko pakistan kaa pehla garvanar general maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya, jiskaa mountabton ko jivan bhar afsos bhi rahaa
 Mountbatten lived in India from 24 March 1947 to 30 June 1948
 in pandraa maheenon main vah na keval sanvaidhanik pramukh rahe balki bharat kii mahatvapurn nitiyon kaa nirnaayak bhi rahe
 Pt
 Nehru always considered him as his friend, guide and greatest advisor
 vah bhi pan nehru ko ek "shandaar", "sarvada vishwasaneey" "kalpanasheel" tathaa "saidhantik samaajawaadee" maanate rahe
 On the question of Kashmir too, Pandit Nehru gave utmost importance to Mountbatten's views
 pan nehru ke shaikh abdulla ke saath bhi gahare sambandh the
 Sheikh Abdullah did his msc in 1932 from Aligarh Muslim University
 phir vah srinagar ke ek hiskool main adhyaaapak niyukt hue, parantu anushaasanheenata ke kaaran skool se hataa diye gayi
 Then he kept trying to keep pace with the British government for some time
 aakhir main unhone 1932 main hi kashmir kii raajnneeti main apana bhagya aajmaana chaha or "muslim kfrons" sthapit kii, jo keval musalamaanon ke liye thi
 But in 1939, its gates were also opened to the believers of other creeds, religions and named it "national Conference" and it connected itself with Pandit Nehru's Praja Mandal movement
 shaikh abdulla ne 1940 main neshnal kfrons ke sammelan main mukhya atithi ke rup main pandit nehru ko bulaayaa tha
 Pandit Nehru's blind friendship with Sheikh Abdullah grew deeper
 shaikh abdulla samay-samay par apni shabdaawalee badalte rahe or pan nehru ko bhi dhokhaa dete rahe
 Later, Sheikh Abdullah's family's friendship with the Nehru family continued
 shrimati indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or ab rahul gandhi kii dosti kramash: shaikh abdulla, farrukh abdulla tathaa vartmaan main umr abdulla se chal rahi he
 Unfortunately neither Shaikh Abdullah nor Pandit Nehru had good relations with Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir
 maharaja kashmir shaikh abdulla kii kutil chaalon, swaarthee or algaavvaadi soch tathaa kashmir main hindu-virdohi ravaiye se parichit the
 He was also aware that through the "quit Kashmir Movement", Sheikh Abdullah Maharaja was anxious to take over the rule himself
 jabaki pan nehru bharat ke antarim pradhanmantri ban gaye the, tab ek ghatana ne is katutaa ko or badha diya tha
 Sheikh Abdullah invited Pandit Nehru to come to a conference in Srinagar
 is kfrons main mukhya prastaav tha maharaja kashmir ko hataane kaa
 Maharaja was forced to ask Pandit Nehru not to come to this conference
 par na maanane par pan nehru ko jammu main hi srinagar jane se purv roak diya gaya
 Pt
 Nehru considered it an insult and he did not forget it throughout his life
 pakistani fuj va kabyli akraman ke samay raja hari singh ko sabak sikhaane ke uddeshy se nehru ji ne bhartiya sena ko bhejne main jaanboojh ke deree kii, jisase kashmir kaa do tihaayi hissaa pakistan kabzane main safal rahaa
 Sheikh Abdullah was doubly pleased with this incident
 isse vah pan nehru ko prasann karne tathaa maharaja ko kupit karne main safal hua
 Although Pt
 Nehru's personality was national but he used to get emotional as soon as the question of Kashmir came

 There are many instances when he was not ready to listen to the advice of the central administration in the case of Kashmir, the then Foreign Secretary YD
 Gundeviya's statement was, "don't talk to the Prime Minister on Kashmir
 kashmir kaa naam sunate hi ve achet ho jate hai
 "the author of the article presented has an experience of his own - in 1958 i went to Teen Nehru's residence Teen Murti with a delegation

 It includes "kashmir, what will you take?" On hearing Pandit Nehru went to Tillamila and asked him to stop the song in between

 He sent his military secretary three times to meet Maharaja Kashmir
 tatkaaleen kashmir ke pradhanmantri kaak ne bhi unase milaane kaa vaayada kiya tha
 But the Maharaja repeatedly postponed the conversation as an excuse for illness
 jinna ne garmiyon kii chuttee kashmir main bitaane kii ijaajat chaahi thi
 But the Maharaja politely avoided this request and said that he would not be able to complete the formalities of accommodating the Governor General of a neighboring country

 Pandit Nehru also felt humiliated

 Perhaps they wanted Kashmir to be merged with Pakistan, because they told Mehrchand Mahajan that it was appropriate for Kashmir to become part of Pakistan, given the "geographical location"

 He reached Srinagar on 18 October to talk to Maharaja Kashmir

 When conspiracies did not materialize, Pakistan tried to capture Kashmir by force, and on 22 October 1947, the tribesmen along with the army marched towards Muzaffarabad

 After all, Mountbatten held a "security Committee" meeting on 24 October
 parantu baithak main maharaja ko kisi bhi prakaar kii sahaayta dene kaa nirnay nahin kiya gaya
 The committee met again on 26 October
 adhyaksh mountabeton ab bhi maharaja ke hastakshar sahit vilay praapt na hone tak kisi sahaayta ke paksh main nahin the
 Finally, on 26 October, Sardar Patel sent his secretary V
P
 Menon was asked to bring the merger document containing the Maharaja's signature

 After receiving the merger letter, the Indian Army was airlifted to Srinagar on 27 October

 Barhamulla was evacuated from the tribes on November 7, but Pandit Nehru immediately ceased fighting on the advice of Sheikh Abdullah

 Thirdly, on the advice of Mountbatten, Pandit Nehru took the matter of Kashmir to the UN Security Council on January 1, 1948
 sambhavat: iske dwaara ve vishwa ke saamne apni eemaandaaree chhavi kaa pradarshan karnaa chaahate the tathaa vishwavyaapee pratishtha praapt karnaa chaahate the

 On this, Prime Minister Pt
 Nehru proposed the proposal on 17 October 1949 by the Minister of State for the State, Gopal Swami Iyengar

 At the international level, generally, all countries import and export goods, exchange services and exchange money
 is prakaar ek nishchit avadhi ke pashchaat in sabhi madon par len dein kaa yadi hisaab nikaala jaay to kisi ek desh ko duusare se bhugtan lenaa shesh hota he or duusare desh ko kisi kisi tisare desh kaa bhugtan chukaana shesh rahata he
 The balance of such mutual transactions between different countries is called balance of payments
 yon kahana chahie ki kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh dwaara anya deshon ko chukaai janevaali sakal raashi tathaa anya deshon se use praapt honevaali sakal raashi ke antar ko us desh kaa 'bhugtan shesh' kehete hai
 The right and opportunity for any one country to receive payment from other countries comes when that country exports goods to those countries, or provides its services by its ships, banks, insurance companies and skilled experts or in the trade of industries of those countries
 Get dividend and interest by investing your capital
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki us desh ke dwaara anya deshon ko die gaye rinon kii mulrashi kaa use bhugtan praapt hota ho yaa anya deshon se hi use rin swaroop raashi milti ho
 Apart from this, it is also possible that country tourists from other countries come to that country to buy goods or consume services
 in sabhi paristhitiyon main us desh ko anya deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa avasar hoga
 On the contrary, it is possible that the same country has to repay some of the payment of other countries
 is prakaar kisi ek tithi ko in sabhi madon par ek desh kii safal lendaree kaa antar nikaalane se us desh kaa bhugtan shesh gyaat ho jaayga
 Although this type of transaction between countries keeps going on some item continuously, but if the difference of transactions of different countries of a country is determined on a certain date, then one of the following circumstances definitely arises
 : is prakaar bhugtan shesh 'anukool', 'pratikul' va 'santulit' yaa 'paksh' main, 'vipaksh' main or 'baraabar' kaha jaataa he
 But its relationship with a particular country should be expressed in a relative sense
 yah kahana sarthak nahin ki bhugtan shesh anukool, pratikul va santulit he; varan yah kahana hoga ki amuk tithi ko yaa amuk avadhi main amuk desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool he, pratikul he athwa santulit he
 In extracting the balance of payments, not only the excess of import and export of goods is known as 'trade balance' but also the difference of gross liability and gross liability from all the items mentioned above
 len dein ke nirantar kram main bhugtan shesh anivaaryat: santulit ho jaataa he par kisi thithivishesh ko kisi desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool yaa pratikul hi paaya jaataa he
 The remaining favorable and favorable payment of a country is considered to reflect the internal economic situation of that country
 yadi bhugtan shesh anukool rahaa to iskaa arth hoga us desh dwaara niryaat kaa bahulya, utpaadan kii prachurtaa, udyog vyapaar kii sabalata, videshi mudra kii kamai or raashtra ke swarnakosh main vruddhi
 Conversely, adverse balance of payments will mean the multiplicity of imports, the laxity of the trade industry, the decline in production, the lack of appropriation, the depletion of foreign exchange and the gold reserves of the nation
