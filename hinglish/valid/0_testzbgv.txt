 sangharshon kaa swaroop, vishay kshetra va kshamta vibhinn ho sakati he
 Perhaps for this reason, before knowing about the resolution of conflicts, a brief knowledge about the nature and type of conflicts is also very important

 In this way, the world was divided into two groups in a purely ideological form

 It is easy to start conflicts, but it is very difficult to continue them for a long time

 But once the conflict starts they can be avoided only through four options- duusari sthiti ati uttam hoti he parantu yah tabhi sambhav he jab donon pratidwandvi samjhauta karnaa chaahate hon tathaa apni nunatam uplabdhi ke sandarbh main samaan vichaar rakhte hon

 In addition, it is also true that not all conflicts require different methods of resolution, but sometimes conflicts are resolved only by leaving them on their own

 In other words, the ability to recognize one's own and others' emotions, discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, the use of emotional information to guide thinking and behavior is called emotional intelligence
 apni bhaawanaaon, sanvegon ko samajhnaa unka uchit tarah se prabandhan karnaa hi bhaavnaatmak samaj he
 a person can communicate more well with the person in front using their 'emotional understanding' and get better results
 danniel golman kii pustak 'bhavnatmak buddhi' ne is shabd ko ko saare vishwa main prachlit kar diya
 Earlier, intelligence was considered to be everything
 ab yah mana jane laga he ki a person with good intelligence can achieve good success, but to reach the top, it is also necessary to have emotional understanding
 acchhee bhaavnaatmak samaj rakhane vaala vyakti kabhi bhi krodh or khushi ke atirek main aa kar anuchit kadam nahi uthaata he
 Emotional Buddha has three patterns
 kshamta namoona peter salvoy or jon meyar dwaara saanchlit he jo bhaavnaatmak prakriya kii jaankaree or saamaajik vaataavaran nevigate karne ke liye iskaa istemaal karne ke liye vyakti kii kshamta par kendrit he
 The model developed by Constantin Vasily Petrides includes behavioral disposition and self-perceived competence and is measured through self-description
 aakhri namoona ek kshamta or visheshta kaa mishran he
 This model, developed by Daniel Goleman, defines the emotional Buddha as an array of skills and attributes that serve as a pathway to leadership leadership
 adhyayan ucch bhaavnaatmak buddha ke saath logon ko adhik se adhik maansik swasthya, anukaraniya kaam ke pradarshan, or adhik shaktishaalee netritv kaushal he ki pataa chalaa he
 For example, Goleman's research in his book, Working with the Emotional Buddha, suggests that the emotional multiplier is sixty-seven percent responsible for outstanding performance in leaders and counts twice as much as technical expertise or intelligence
 bhaavnaatmak buddha kii ankit karanevaale or ise viksit karne ke tareekon ko or adhik vyapak rup se pratishthit pichley kuch dashakon main ban gaye hai
 In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the nervous system of emotional intelligence
 
 Criticisms based on the Emotional Buddha ask whether the Emotional Buddha is the real intellect and whether its incremental validity exceeds the intellectual quotient and the five major personality traits

 Emotional Buddha has received critical acclaim for his role in leadership and business success

 When members of the White Conduit Club were formed for cricket in the early 1780s, they played at the White Conduit Fields in Islington but soon became dissatisfied with the surrounding environment and complained the site was "highly public"
