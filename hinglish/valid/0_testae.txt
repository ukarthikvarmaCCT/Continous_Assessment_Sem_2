 Dengue, chikungunya continues to lead the war of the people of the capital
 aise main agencys kii bhoomika khaasi ehm maani ja rahi he or shaayad isiilie MCD ne apane har jone ke liye alag-alag helpline numbers bana rakhe hai
 So that if anyone sees a pile of garbage anywhere, one can immediately call these helpline numbers and get help

 In which East MCD has recorded 1000 calls and South MCD has recorded 2418 calls

 Dengue, chikungunya spread throughout the colony due to litter

 The question is that on one hand the MCD is claiming so many complaints through helpline numbers and on the other side nothing is visible on the ground

 ejineering college se sangh-vihip kaa safaragara main janmecinghalake pita ek sarkari adhikari the
 The VHP leader received a bachelor's degree in 1950 from the Engineering Institute of Banaras Hindu University
 vah 1942 se rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude hue the
 However, after graduation, he started working as a full-time evangelist
 apane kaarykaal main vah dilli or haryana ke praant prachaarak bhi rahe
 In 1980, Ashok Singhal was appointed Joint General Secretary in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 1984 main vah iske mahasachiv bane or phir adhyaksh bane
 Ashok Singhal is known for his aggressive attitude towards building the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 kattar hindu netaa hone ke alaava ashok singhl hindustani sangeet ke prashikshit gayak bhi the
 He studied music from Pandit Omkar Nath Thakur
 ek maheene se thi saans sambandhi pareshaanivihip kii ore se purv main jari ek bayaan ke mutabik, singhl ko ek maheene se zyada vakt se saans sambandhi pareshaani ho rahi he
 After deteriorating health in Allahabad, Singhal was flown to Delhi and admitted to Medanta on 20 October
 jabaki do din pehle hi unhen aspataal se chuttee mili thi
 Togadia said - We lost the vocal leader; VHP leader Pravin Togadia said on Singhal's death that we have lost the outspoken leader of the Hindu community
 ishwar unki aatma ko shanti de
 He also said that his desire to build Ram temple in Ayodhya will definitely be fulfilled
 dhanteras (dhanteras 2018) se 5 din tak chalane vaale diwali utsav kii shuruyaat ho jaati he
 This festival, celebrated two days before Diwali, falls on Trayodashi of Kartik month
 is bardhanteras5 november 2018 ko he
 Shopping on Dhanteras is considered very auspicious
 Dhanteras 2018: jaane kyon manaaya jaataa he dhanteras?har tyohaar kii tarah dhanteras manaane ke peeche bhi ek puranic katha prachlit he
 According to Hindu scriptures, when Kshirsagar was being churned, Dhanvantari appeared with a pot of nectar
 isiilie dhanteras ko sukh or samruddhi ke parv ke taur par manaaya jaataa he
 According to the scriptures, Lord Dhanvantari appeared on the day of Trayodashi during Samudra Manthan, hence this day is called Dhan Trayodashi
 dhanteras: sona-chaandi hi nahin, ye chijen kharidne se bhi saal bhar hogi dhan varshadhanteras ke din naa khariden ye chijen-dhanteras ke din sona, chaandi yaa nae bartan khareednaa shubh mana jaataa he
 But on this day, one should avoid buying iron utensils and things made from it
 dhanteras par adhiktar log steel ke bartan kharidte hai lekin steel bhi lohe kaa hi ek rup he isliye dhanteras ke din steel ke bartan nahin kharidne kii salaah di jaati he
 Apart from steel and iron, glass utensils should also be avoided
 Dhanteras 2018: bhuulakar bhi naa khariden ye 10 chijen, lakshmi ho jaaengi naarajadhanteras ke din samruddhi ke pratik ke taur par ye chijen khareednaa shubh mana jaataa he- sona, chaandi, dhaatu kii baniin lakshmi-ganesh kii murtiyon, nae bartan
 Do clean these places on Dhanteras, you will have to buy utensils of benefic copper also
 inaki chaar bhujaaen hai, jinamein se do bhujaaon main ve shankh or chakra dhaaran kiye hue hai
 With the medicine in the other two arms, he has the nectar vase
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah amrit kalash pital kaa bana hua he kyonki pital bhagwaan dhanvantari kii priy dhaatu he
 That is why shopping of brass has been considered more fruitful on the day of Dhanteras
 dhanteras par jarur khariden ye 5 chijen, hogi kuber kii kripakhali bartan naa laaen-dhanteras ke din bartan khareednaa bahut shubh mana jaataa he lekin bartan kii kharidari ke vakt kuch saavdhaaniyon ko dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he
 Never bring empty utensils at home
 ise ghar laane par pani se bhar den
 Water is seen to be associated with luck
 isse aapke ghar main samruddhi or sampannataa kaa vaas rahegaa
 Bringing empty containers home is considered inauspicious, so avoid doing so

 yahaan tak ki esaspi ke donon numberon par baat karne ke liye esemes bhi kiya gaya
 But no answer was found

 ’ kanphyus mat hoie, short main samajhie
 There are three friends, having fun
 ek kii shaadi hone vaali he, uski mangetar cankain tips he or baaki do doston ko bahut zyada pasand nahin karti
 The three friends drink daru, dance and want to go on a bachelor's adventure trip before marriage
 jate bhi hai or vahaan bhi mangetar brake aata he
 But together comes the fear of AIDS
 yaheen se film brother romens (bromens) auki relationships kaa trek chhodkar aapako echivi positive logon ke prati samvedansheel karne main jute jaati he
 And finally everyone gets some messages
 jaise, chune se, chuumane se, saath khaane se aids nahin hota
 AIDS patients need our love and encouragement and should not have casual sex
 himmat mat haariye, kahani suniaztin, harry or rohan jigari yaar hai
 Jatin is a regular man, Harry is a Punjabi and Rohan is gay
 jatin kii tamanna se shaadi ho rahi he
 Before that Yar bachelor party, where Jatin goes 'bahk'
 khayr agle din tamanna ke aa dhamkane par yaar sambhaal lete hai
 Then all three leave, in the Himalayan plains of Bachelor Trip
 magar raste main aata he ek brake kyonki manali main tamanna kii kagin kii shaadi he
 During this time, the three friends meet again with the girl Natasha, with whom Jatin was seduced
 donon ke bich chemistry develop hoti he or tabhi ujagar hone shuru hote hai kai saamaajik, manovaigyanik sach
 All these truths form the base camp, the snow-bound guest house where a couple runs an NGO for AIDS awareness
 aakhir main jatin kii life main aata he twist or phir use aati he samaj ki saavdhaanee hi bachaav he
 What have you done to Nilfil Bablu Happy Hai by Neil Madhav Panda
 isse pehle vah ‘aay em kalam’ or ‘jalapari’ jaisi saghan or sandesh se bhari filmein de chuke hai
 But those films had a tight screenplay, many memorable characters like Liptar and strong acting
 jabaki bablu happy he kanfujd or nakal kii maari najar aati he
 Talking about good acting in the film, Sumit Suri is very impressed in the role of Harry of Pitampura
 rohan ke role main amol parashar bhi thik hai
 Looks like everyone else, acting like they are doing their favor on the screen
 jatin ke rup main sabase zyada footage paane vaale sahil anand ne mauka miss kar diya
 The same thing applies to Preet Kamal, who plays Tamanna, and Irika, who brings Natasha to the screen
 film main praveen dabaas kaa bhi chemiyo he
 There is more defense in not knowing 'bablu Happy Hai' tries to be cool and makes a lot of noise in this turn
 phir jab yah trek badalati he, to ek docue drama jaisi ho jaati he or lagata he goyaa bharat sarkaar kaa kisi saamaajik samasya par bana aid dekh rahe hon
 Neither the songs nor the dialogues of the film are special
 dialogs ko lekar afsos isliye bhi zyada hota he kyonki isaki credit main naam aata he sanjay chouhan kaa, jinhone aay em kalam, paan singh tomars or sahib bivi gangster jaisi filmein likhi hai
 So the final verdict is that most people will get sad after watching Bablu Happy

 pakistani parmaanu vaigyanik abdul kadir khan ne kaha he ki pakistan kii vartmaan sthiti 1971 se bhi buree he
 He warned that if social evils are not overcome soon then the day is not far when we will once again disintegrate
 khan ne ek patrika main likhe apane aalekh 'events of 1971' main kaha he, 'is samay desh kii haalat 1971 se bhi kharaab he
 It is plagued with all kinds of social evils
 yadi hamane ise jald dur nahin kiya to vah din dur nahin, jab ham phir vighatit ho jaaenge
 To overcome this situation, the first and most important requirement is that we keep ourselves from going to war with another country and make our home fit
 'khan 1971 main hue bharat-pakistan yuddh kaa hawala de rahe the, jisase bangladesh kaa janm hua
 He has written that all countries have to go through a period of ups and downs
 ek ke liye jo gauravpurn avadhi hoti he, vah duusare ke liye dukhad hoti he
 People usually ignore and forget sad times while celebrating good events with pomp
 khan ne likhaa he, 'yah atyant durbhagyapurna he ki ham pakistan ke rahane waalon ne pichhali galatiyon se koi sabak nahin liya
 The break-up of Pakistan on 16 December 1971 is the result of this
 ' unhone likhaa he, 'lakhon pakistani us traasadee ke kaarnon ke prati puri tarah jaagruk the, lekin lagata he jaise hamaare shaasha or shashan vyavastha aise dardanaak anubhav ke baavjood in sabase bekhbar he

 com / v8czaa6q2q The video of this episode of Kapil Sharma has been shared by Sony TV on the official Instagram account
 is video ko abhi tak kai log dekh chuke hai
 There comes a time in this video when Kapil Sharma tells Farah Khan that he must have seen the film 'amar Akbar Anthony', when three children were born
 unki is baat par farah khan sahati archana puuran singh bhi thahaake lagaakar hansane lag jaati hai
 Farah Khan, while replying to Kapil Sharma's comment, says what would have happened if i had been watching 'dus'
 kapil sharma (kapil Sharma) iske baad farah khan (farah Khan) se kehete hai ki wo to phir bhi thik he agar aap 'ali baba 40 chor' dekh rahi hotin to kya hota
 With this much saying of Kapil, the audience sitting on the show starts laughing fiercely
 bataa den ki 'madars de' (mothers Day) ke maukey par farah khan 'da kapil sharma sho' (the Kapil Sharma Show) main pahunchi thim
 Videos of this episode are becoming very viral
 kai baar aisa hota he ki ham kisi khaas se baat kar rahe hote hai or hamaari baatcheet jhagade kaa rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 Many times either we misunderstand the words of others or we are misunderstood
 kisi bhi rishte main gaiyr-jaruri jhagadon se bachanaa bahut jaruri he
 Let us know how to avoid these conflicts
 
 
 1-baatcheet ke liye acha vakt talaashen-din yaa raat main baatcheet ke liye roj ek aisa vakt jarur nikaalen jab aap donon ke dimag main or baaten naa chal rahi hon
 Both of you can talk to each other well and there is no disturbance
 2-ek-duusare ko bich main naa roke-adhiktar hamaari koshish yahi rahati he ki hamaari baat suni jaae
 Our focus is not on listening to the person in front
 yah bahut hi galat tarika he
 You keep your point but after the other's talk is over
 yahi baatcheet karne kaa sabase acha tarika he
 3 - Do not get up in the middle of the conversation - often we get up in the middle of the conversation in anger or fret, which is not right
 isse sthiti or kharaab ho jaati he or ladaai vahiin kii vahiin ansulajhi rah jaati he
 If talking on an issue then complete it
 4-jawaab dene se zyada samajhane kii koshish karen-yah koi aisi ladaai nahin he jisamen kisi ek kii jeet jaruri he
 If you are arguing for victory in a fight, then even if you feel good for a few moments, this will not solve the problem
 isliye dusron ko jawaab dene kii koshish main lage rahane ke bajaae unki baat samajhane kii koshish karen
 Don't play 5-word games - say what you want to say
 ghuma-firaakar baat bilkul naa karen
 On the other hand, do not even expect that the other person understands your mind without saying it
 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke agsit pole main haar dikhaae jane ke baavjood soobe ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne apni jeet kaa dam bharaa he

 BJP leaders were seen refraining from commenting on exit polls, before this, the exit poll was made by Union Minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar
 
 congress jeetegi or bijepi haaregi
 He said that when the results are out on December 11, they will be shocking
 bijepi ke varisht netaa prakaash jaavdekar ne shanivaar ko kaha, 'main abhi pratikriya nahin duungaa, kyonki acjact nattejey 11 disambar ko aaenge
 It would be good to discuss at the same time
 hamen nateezon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 He said that there have been many times when the exit poll results have been reversed, so we should wait for the result to come on 11 December

 Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappakarnataka has been making controversial statements about not giving a ticket to a Muslim in the election
 a statement by Karnataka's Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Minister KS Eshwarappa has created a ruckus
 shri ram sena ke ek kaarykram main kees ishwarappa ne kaha ki raashtra bhakt bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko vot denge jabaki pakistan samarthak muslim bhagava party ko vot dene main sankoch karenge
 Addressing the supporters of Shri Ram Sena, the Karnataka minister said, 'before the BJP government came to power, i met some Congress mlas who had expressed their desire to join BJP
 lekin un congressi netaaon kaa kahana tha ki unke nirvachan kshetron main 50,000 se adhik muslim vot hai or bijepi jwoin karne par unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 KS Eshwarappa said that he told Congress leaders, 'in my constituency, my community Kuruba has around 8,000-10,000 votes and over 50,000 Muslim votes
 main aaj tak vot ke liye kisi muslim ko salaam karne nahin gaya or maine 47,000 se adhik maton se jeet hasil kii he
 KS Eshwarappa said that those who are patriotic Muslims vote for the BJP, but pro-pakistan and anti-national Muslims do not vote for the BJP
 bataa den ki bijepi ke varisht netaa dipti siem bhi rahe hai or is tarah ke vivaadit bayaan dene ke liye jane jate hai
 Before the 2018 assembly elections, he had said that BJP will not give tickets to Muslims in Karnataka as they do not believe in BJP
 vahiin congress ke varisht netaa or purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne kees ishwarappa ke bayaan par tippanee dene se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki main is par pratikriya nahin duungaa
 i have stopped reacting to what people like Eshwarappa say
 lekin congress ke pravaktaa brijesh kalppa ne ajtak se kaha ki ishwarappa pradhanmantri modi kaa sammaan nahin karte hai
 PM Modi says that everyone's development together
 iskaa matlab he ki ishwarappa piem modi kaa thodaa bhi sammaan nahin karte hai
 At the same time, Eshwarappa has been under damage control since this controversial statement
 party ne ishwarappa ke bayaan se khud ko alag kar liya he or kaha he ki yah party kaa rukh nahin he
 This is his personal view
 kendriya mantri divi sadanand gauda ne kaha ki bijepi piem modi ke sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas naare kaa paalan karti he

 com / ysrwhnqehe Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the recent political developments in Maharashtra and accused it of 'shamelessly' trying to end democracy in the state
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki rajyapal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi evam grahamantri amit shah ke nirdesh par kaam kiya
 According to sources, in the party parliamentary party meeting in Parliament House complex, Sonia Gandhi also said that every attempt was made to thwart the Shiv sena-ncp-congress alliance in the state, but an appeal was made in the Supreme Court and the modi-shah government Exposed completely
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke prayaason ko vifal karne ke liye teenon partiyaan ekajute hai
 Let us know, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as Chief Minister on Thursday evening
 unke saath rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) or congress ke kuch netaa bhi mantri pad kii shapath le sakate hai
 The three parties together form a new government in the state
 iske saath hi sonia gandhi ne arthvyavastha kii sthiti ko lekar bhi sonia ne narendra modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 According to sources, he said, 'it is clear that the modi-shah government is oblivious to the challenges faced by the country
 aarthik sankat din-ba-din gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Growth rates are falling, unemployment is rising and no investment is coming
 ' congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘kisaan or chote evam majhole kaarobaari pareshaani main hai
 Investment is falling mainly in rural areas
 niryaat gir rahaa he
 The prices of essential commodities are increasing, due to which people are facing a lot of difficulty
 'unhone daawa kiya, ‘in samasyaon kaa nidaan karne kii bajaay modi-shah sarkaar aankadon chhedchhad karne yaa phir aankadon ko prakashit nahin karne main lagi hui he
 Referring to the 'regional Composite Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement', Sonia said that due to the loud voice of the Congress' Modi suddenly and hypocritically got to know Gandhi's formula
 ' iske saath hi unhone aarope lagaaya ki assam muddon se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye pradhanmantri or grih mantri ‘vibhaajankaree nitiyon' kaa anusaran kar rahe he
 Sonia said, "issues like amendment of the citizenship law are striking the foundation of the Constitution
 ' enarasi kaa ullekh karte hue unhone daawa kiya, ‘supreme court kii nigaraanee main assam main NRC kaa kriyanvayan kiya gaya
 This did not complete the agenda of the BJP-RSS and the nrc's demand for the ruling party was renewed
 grih mantri puure desh main NCR kii baat kar rahe hai isse or dar evam afra-tafari paidaa hogi
 Referring to the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Sonia Gandhi said that this was done with the 'false promise' of new beginnings in Jammu and Kashmir, but the ground reality is exactly the opposite of what is being tried
 unhone purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram kii giraftaar kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki yah sarkaar badale kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Sonia said, 'we will not fight for ourselves, but for the Constitution, liberal and plural democracy and the country and the people
 ' JNU is in discussion once due to some reason or the other
 is baar student union kii vajah se nahin, balki entrance examination main lagane vaali fees kii vajah se
 It is reported that JNU has increased the entrance examination fees by 27 percent, which will be implemented from the coming academic session
 JNU main ek saal main duusare chif procter kaa istipha, kya ye he vajah?jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity13 saal baad entrance examination fees badhaai he
 Earlier in 2003, the fee structure was revised
 yah faisla uniwarsity ke daakhila vibhaag dwaara liya gaya he
 However, this fee structure will not be applicable to reserved categories candidates including SC / ST, Divyang and below poverty line students

 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne dilli sarkaar main nae mukhya sachiv kii niyukti par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Saurabh Bhardwaj has alleged that under the supervision of the officer who was removed on such a large scale, he was made the chief secretary of Delhi despite being a year junior
 mukhya sachiv par dabaav bana rahi he centre sarkaar!aap netaa saurabh bharadwaj ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki mukhya sachiv koun he isse fark nahin padataa balki fark is baat kaa padataa he ki kya centre sarkaar mukhya sachiv par dabaav bana rahi he
 Anshu Prakash, MM Kutty, KK Sharma will be personal good men but the central government's purpose is only to hinder the work of Kejriwal government of Delhi
 ummid he jo janata dilli ko lekar modi sarkaar ke is ravaiye ko dekh rahi he wo janata apni niti badale
 The conspiracy behind the appointment of junior officer as Chief Secretary, Bhardwaj, questioned that appointment of Chief Secretary is suspect
 jis afasar kii dekharekh main itane bade str par matadaataaon kaa naam hataaya gaya, unako ek saal junior hone ke baavjood kin paristhitiyon main dilli kaa mukhya sachiv banaaya gaya, jabaki 86 ke batch vaale afasaron kii niyukti kii charchaa chal rahi thi
 Bypassing Manoj and Naresh Kumar, there would have been a special conspiracy of the Central Government to go from a fixed process to a junior one year as Chief Secretary
 centre sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie junior afasar ko mukhya sachiv banane ke peeche kya vishesh saazish he?aap se afasaron kii niyukti par salaah nahin leti centre sarkaaram aadmi party ke mutabik shila dikshit sarkaar or aam aadmi party kii 49 din kii sarkaar ke dauraan afasaron kii niyukti ko lekar centre sarkaar mashwara karti thi, lekin 2015 main aam aadmi party sarkaar aane ke baad chuni hui sarkaar se kisi bhi niyukti main salaah nahin lee jaati he
 Party leaders allege that in the Delhi government, a person wants to be appointed by the Central government, which impedes the functioning of the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi by following the law and the constitution
 dilli sarkaar ko badalanaa chaahati he bijepiam aadmi party ke netaa raghav chaddha ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan centre sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki kisi aalaa adhikari kii niyukti par us rajya kii sarkaar ko jaankaree di jaati he
 But unfortunately such incidents are happening in Delhi, where the elected government is not consulted before appointing an officer or senior officer in any department
 bijepi kii sarkaar hameshaa dilli sarkaar ko badalane kii bhaavana se dekhati he
 From the Chief Minister to the false mlas on the mlas, Chadha hopes that when the Chief Secretary joins the government and the democratically elected government takes a decision, the officers should not impose those decisions
 raghav chaddha ne kaha ki hamaari ummid hameshaa ye rahati he ki dilli kii janata ke haq ke kaam karne waalon ke saath ham khadey hai
 All the bureaucracy is not bad, but some officers come under pressure from BJP to stop the government
 puraane mukhya sachiv ne hamaare mukhyamantri se lekar vidhayakon par jhuthe cese darj karaae
 Such attitude raises questions
 aapako bataa den ki dilli ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari (CEO) vijay kumaar dev ko ab dilli sarkaar kaa mukhya sachiv niyukt kiya gaya he
 Vijay Kumar Dev is a 1987 batch IAS officer of AGMUT cadre
 ve dilli main parivahan nigam ke chairman, dilli ke mandlayukta ke saath anya bhi ahm padon par rah chuke hai
 Prior to this, Anshu Prakash was the Chief Secretary, he was in conflict with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government since the alleged assault on him
 haal hi main unka transfar telecom department main kar diya gaya tha
 However, whether the change with the Chief Secretary will end the feud with the Delhi government is still a big question
 kyonki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne pichley dinon farji voting list kaa mudda uthaaya tha or chunaav ayog ke saath tu-tu main-main kii thi
 During this time, Vijay Kumar Dev had the responsibility of the Election Commission of Delhi
 yani aise main ek baar phir mukhya sachiv ke pad par vahi vyakti aayaa he, jisase dilli sarkaar kii puraani raar chal rahi he
 Special session of Delhi Legislative Assembly on Monday

 Shobha Singh used to visit his farm every evening
 us khet ke paas ek vishesh akritinuma tile se sand ke hunkaarne or sher ke dahaadane kii aawaaj aati thi
 After hearing this voice several times, Shobha Singh told this thing to the villagers
 gramvaasiyon ne bhi shaam ko aawaaj kai baar suni thi
 After this, he searched around the sounding bull or lion
 parantu dur dur tak koi jaanavar nahin mila, tab logon ne mana ki isi tile se aawaaj aati he
 People started considering this mound as Shivling
 is bare main paara gaanv ke log bataate hai ki pehle yah tila chote rup main tha, dhire-dhire isaki oonchai evam golai badhati gai, jo aaj bhi jari he
 Nature-laden water logs are also seen in this Shivling

 The Maharashtra cabinet today decided to cut the electricity rates charged by the government-run Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution (mahavitaran) company
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki yah chhot sirf un upabhoktaaon ko milegi, jo 300 unit se kam kii khapat karenge
 This reduction in electricity rates will not be applicable in Mumbai, because the work of power distribution is not in the hands of Mahavitaran
 mumbai ke upabhoktaaon ko tata power, reliance infrastracchar or brihannmumbai electric supplai evam transport dwaara bijli kii aapurti kii jaati he
 The Maharashtra government has taken this decision at a time when Congress mps Sanjay Nirupam and Priya Dutt had protested recently demanding a reduction in electricity rates

 What a great project the leaders had started in 2027 to ruin your children in state-by-state universities
 2027 se pehle 2022 main bhi pataa nahi chalegaa
 You would think that your child did not study by taking loans, cutting his stomach, driving an auto, driving a rickshaw, and spending the night day and night
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki bahut jagah shikshak intazaar karte hai chaatr padhane nahin jaataa magar yah baat zyaada sahi he ki shikshak he hi nahin

 54 arab dollar karch kiye

 Indian students are investing nearly twice the amount of India's higher education budget in the US
 yah raashi 2015-16 kii tulana main 30 pratishat zyaada he
 In a way, these students did exactly this, otherwise they would have been wasted in the junk colleges here
 bees saal se to main hi dekh rahaa hum vahi steffens vahi hindu
 Same IIT and same IIM
 das bees kii ginati par pahunch kar samaapt ho jaati he
 a new hoax project to count these ten twenty has come up which is called ranking in English
 jab college hi kisi laayak nahin he, master nahin hai to unki rekking kise bataai ja rahi he
 The same IIT, the same IIM, will be counted again and it will be born that the state of education in the country has improved
 sochie kareeb teen lakh bhartiya chaatr sirf america main 42, 835 karod kaa nivesh kar dete hai or hamaari ucch shiksha kaa bajet uskaa aadha he
 Indian students will also invest in countries from Singapore to Europe, there is no calculation of that here
 bharat ke collejon ko kabad main nahin badla jaataa to amareeki collejon ko itnaa bada bazaar nahin miltaa

 dilli uniwarsity kii ek mahila shikshak ne massej kiya
 She has been teaching adhoc for 9 years
 jab ve garbhvatee hui to aakhri dinon tak padhaati raheen
 The baby was born from the operation and she went to teach only after the 14th day, as she does not get maternity leave
 jab dilli uniwarsity main yah haal to aap kahaan jaakar sar peetenge
 On 14 November, adhoc teachers of Delhi University held a Halla Bol program at the Chancellor's Office
 logon kii upasthiti ko dekhakar lagata he ki in shikshakon ko hi apni ladaai main yakeen nahin he
 4000 adhoc teachers tell, but never seen 400 in their movement
 ab to inke do gut ho gaye hai
 It will happen, what will be their insecurity
 pehle vahi raajnneetik dal inhen berojgaar banavaate hai or phir inhen baant kar apana saamaan bana lete hai
 One group performed on 9 Nabvar and one faction performed on 14 November
 andolan ke bheetar bheetar vichaardhaara or jati ke aadhaar par bhi jugad bithaane or naukari dene kaa khel dilli uniwarsity main bhi khulkar chalata he
 No one has the courage to leave this door, cut it, then it is obvious that this is the destiny of their movement
 kai prophessoron ne apane chelon ko naukari de di, kisi kaabil ko baahar kar diya
 You will get dizzy if you know the game of caste and religion
 14 november ke hallaa bol kii aguwai kar rahe shikshak netaaon kaa kahana he ki dilli vishvavidhyalay kii kaaryakari parishad ne adhyadesh 13 e laakar pehle bhi edock shikshakon kaa samaayojan kiya he
 There are thousands of posts that have not been interviewed for 10-10 years
 adaalat ne kai aadesh die hai magar intervyuu nahin hue hai
 There are some but in most of the seats the process of interviewing gets cold with the filling of the form
 dilli sahit bharat ke anek rajyon main theke par padhaakar shikshakon ne shiksha ke bajet par ahsaan kiya he
 If they did not teach in half the incomplete money, the concierge in the college is not available even in such a low budget of education
 kai rajyon main to ye shikshak maheene main 2 xxrep 4 0 se bhi kam kii selary main padhaate hai, das saal kii naukari karte hue ye garib ho rahe hai, inaki raajnneetik chetana samaapt ho rahi he
 Has been done
 isliye kabhi aapane nahin dekha hoga ki rajasthan ke edock shikshakon kaa saath dilli waalon ne diya yaa jharkhand yaa madhya pradesh ke edock shikshakon ne dilli waalon kaa saath diya
 It is also true that if you perform openly, then the job that will be done will also go away
 aap in shikshakon ke bich survey karenge to zyaadaatar shikshak news channelon par hindu muslim dibet main biji milenge
 His life was ruined but he could not get the vision to see the reality
 kai collejon main prophessoron ne jamkar quality ke maapdand kii dhajjiyaan udayi hai
 Therefore there is no political consciousness, jugaad consciousness among these teachers
 pile rang kii tishart pahanakar ye chaatr lalit narayan mithila uniwarsity chalo abhiyaan chalaa rahe magar dhyaan baar-baar pile rang kii tisharch par hi jaataa rahaa
 Despite good intentions, this is the destiny of the students
 andolan ke prati yakeen itnaa kamazor ho gaya he ki sara jor communication par hi ho jaataa he
 The news appeared in the newspaper and the hashtag went on Twitter and the movement ended
 rang rogan kar manageron ne kasbon ke andolanon ko chamakaa to diya he magar zaruri he ki in chaatro main yakeen paidaa ho ki apane shahar kii uniwarsity kii karaab haalat ko thik karnaa he
 This work will not be done in a day or in a month
 inhen apni maangon ko bhi samajhnaa hoga
 They are demanding to make Central University but what will happen to it
 kya koi central uniwarsity aisi he jisaki haalat acchhee he
 Where are the teachers
 kisi bhi central uniwarsity main 30 fisadi pad kisi bhi samay main khaali milenge or rajyon kii universti main 50 fisadi pad khaali milenge
 The post of Vice Chancellor Ash has been done
 collejon main mukhyamantri kaa swaagat karnaa or mantri ko maala pehanaane se zyaada kisi ke paas kaam nahin bachaa he
 Good thing that these youngsters are starting
 ye chaahate hai ki class niyamit ho, riselt samay par aae, course kii nai kitaaben ho or chatravaas kii vyavasta ho
 We discussed this university of Mithilanchal in the University Series
 marwari college darambhaga main 57 professor hone chahie the, magar 43 khaali hai
 LNJ College Jhanjharpur has 31 vacancies out of 37
 der se hi sahi mithila student union ne pahal to kii he, agar ve isi tarah tike rahe, to kya pataa nateeja bhi nikal aae magar aisa na ho ki vaai faai lag jaae or professor na aae
 At present, according to the first day, it seems that these preparations have been successful
 tippaniyan In Darbhanga, student organization AISA demonstrated in front of Mithila University today
 isa ne chandigarh se kolkata tak chaatr yuva adhikaar yatra nikaali he
 From November 7 to November 21, this journey will pass through several cities of UP, Bihar and Bengal
 aara muzaffarpur ke collejon main bhi yah yatra pahunchi he
 It has Sucheta Dey of Aisa who has also been the president of Jawaharlal Nehru University
 inkaa naaraa he, 'shiksha nahin rojgaar chahie nafrat nahin adhikaar chahie'
 These slogans should also reflect that college colleges are empty of teachers
 shikshakon ko vetan nahin mil rahaa he
 The quality of studies is very poor
 samasya yah he ki har jagah chaatr sangh ke chunaav band hai, jahaan hote hai jeenyu ko chhod kar wo chunaav kam prabandhan zyada hote hai
 Student politics has to relate itself to the condition of its colleges
 varanaa pilaa or laal rang ke andolan guzar to jaaenge magar asar nahin hoga
 Our colleague Sushil Mahapatra spoke to Furkan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 association of indian uniwarsity bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon kii pratinidhi sanstha he
 He recently gave the Maulana Azad Memorial Lecture
 jisamen kaha tha ki kabhi bhi kisi central uniwarsity or rashtriya mahatv kii sansthaaon main kisi bhi samay par 30 fisadi pad khaali hi rahata he
