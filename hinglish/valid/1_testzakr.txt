in sabake sanyog viyog se is vishwa kaa khel ho rahaa he
 In short, this is the order of creation
 prakruti main parivartan bhale hi ho parantu purush jyon kaa tyon rahata he
 Yet one thing happens
 jaise shwet sphatik ke saamne rang birange phulon ko laane se usapar unka rangeen pratibimb padataa he, isi prakaar purush par prakritik vikrutiyon ke pratibimb padate hai
 Gradually, he seems to be chiseled from intellect to injury, considering himself to be associated with these vices of nature
 aaj apane ko dhani, nirdhan, balvan durbal, kutumbi, sukhi, du:khee, aadi maan rahaa he
 Has gone away from its pure form
 yah uskaa bhram, avidya he
 These materials made from the staple have covered his form, many folds have opened on him
 yadi vah in kholon, in aavarnon ko dur phenk de to uskaa chhutkaaraa ho jaayga
 The order in which it is tied will break the bond in the opposite order
 pehle mahabhuton se upar uthanaa hoga
 In the end, you will have to turn from the head
 yah bandhan vaastavik nahin he, parantu bahut hi drudh prathit hote hai
 Yoga is the name of the remedy by which the men can be placed in their pure form by breaking the bonds
 sankhya ke aacharyo kaa kahana he: yadwa tadwa taduchhiti: parampurusharthah - jaise bhi ho sake purush or pradhan ke is kritrim sanyog kaa uchchhed karnaa param purusharth hai
 This is the philosophical plane of yoga: the condition that occurs when avidya is overcome has been described by different masters and thinkers in different ways
 apane-apane vichaar ke anusaar unhone usko pruthak naam bhi die hai
 Some call him Kaivalya, some salvation, some nirvana
 upar pahunchakar jisko jaisaa anubhav ho vah use us prakaar kahe
 In fact, that state is like this, whereo the Wacho outgoing unattainable Mansa Sah - where the mind and speech have no access
 thode se shabdon main ek or baat kaa bhi charchaa kar dena aavashyak he
 Patanjali, along with innumerable men, has also assumed the authority of God under the name 'purusha special'
 sankhya ke acharya aisa nahin maanate
 In fact, there is no need to obey
 yadi yogadarshan main se vah thode se sutara nikaal bhi len to koi antar nahin padataa
 In terms of the practice of yoga, it is not very important to believe or not to believe in God
 ishwar kii satta ko maanane vaale or na maanane vaale, donon yoga main samaan rup se adhikaar rakhte hai
 Knowledge and ignorance, bondage and redemption, happiness and sorrow are all in the mind
 at: jo koi apane swaroop main sthiti paane kaa icchhuk he usko apane chitt ko un vastuon se hataane kaa praytn karnaa hoga, jo hathaat pradhan or uske vikaron kii ore khinchati hai or sukh du:kha kii anubhuti utpann karti hai
 In this way, the name of removing the mind and moving away from such things of the mind is disinterest
 yah yoga kii pehali seedhi he
 Absolute quietness does not happen at all
 jyon jyon vyakti yoga kii sadhana main pravrutt hota he tyon tyon vairaygy bhi badhata he or jyon jyon veraygya badhata he tyon tyon sadhana main pravriti badhati he
 Like Patanjali has said: There should be detachment, detachment in Gandhi ji's words, in both visions and disciplines
 swarg aadi, jinka gyaan hamako anushruti arthath mahatmaon ke vachanon or dharmagranthon se hota he, anushravik kehalaate hai
 The practice of yoga is called practice
 idhar kai sau varsho se saadhuon main is armbh main bhajan shabd bhi chal padaa he
 As long as the mind moves towards the subjects of the senses, it will remain fickle
 indriyaan uskaa ek ke baad duusari bhogy vastu se sampark karaati rahengi
 How many will also get disconnected
 kaam, krodh, lobh, aadi ke uddipt hone ke saikadon avasar aate rahenge
 There will be constant feeling of happiness and sorrow
 is prakaar pradhan ore uske vikaron ke saath jo bandhan anek janmon se chale aa rahe hai ve drudh se drudhtar hote chale jaayenge
 Therefore, the mind has to be drawn from the subjects of the senses and inward
 iske anek upaay bataae gaye hai jinke byore main jane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The state of mind of an ordinary person is called Kshatpa
 vah ek vishay se duusare vishay kii ore phenkaa phirata he
 When he is tried and brought to any one subject, he moves quickly towards the poison
 is avasthaa ko veikshipt kehete hai
 After long efforts, the seeker can keep him on any one subject for a long time
 is avasthaa kaa naam ekagra he
 It is very difficult to subdue the mind
 shrikrishna ne ise pramathi balwat-mast hathi ke samaan balvan-bataaya he
 One thing helps to subdue the mind
 yah saadhaaran anubhav kii baat he ki jab tak sharir chanchal rahata he, chitt chanchal rahata he or chitt kii chanchalta sharir ko chanchal banaae rahati he
 The versatility of the body depends on the versatility of the institution
 jab tak nadisanthaan sankshubdh rahegaa, sharir par indriya grahya vishyon ke aadhaat hote rahenge
 Those souls will have an effect on the brain, as a result of which the mind and body will remain fickle
 chitt ko nishchal banane ke liye yogi vaisaa hi upaay karata he jaisaa kabhi-kabhi yuddh main karnaa padataa he
 If his friends can be defeated in fighting a strong enemy, then the chances of success increase
 yogi chitt par adhikaar paane ke liye sharir or usamen bhi mukhyat: nadisanthaan, ko vash main karne kaa praytn karata he
 Body is physical, nadis are also physical
 isaliye inase nipatna sahaj he
 The process that proves this thing has two parts: Asana and Pranayama
 asana se sharir nishchal banataa he
 Many asanas are practiced in terms of health
 patanjali ne itnaa hi kaha he: sthir sukhmasanam : jisapar der tak bina ksht ke baitha ja sake vahi asana shreshth he
 It is true that for health, some rules related to health are necessary
 jaisaa shrikrishna ne gita main kaha he- Eating, drinking, sleeping, waking all have to be controlled
 pranayam shabd ke sambandh main bahut bhram failaa hua he
 The reason for this confusion is that today people have often forgotten the meaning of the word prana
 bahut se aise log bhi, jo apane ko yogi kehete hai, is shabd ke sambandh main bhul karte hai
 a yogi has to make an effort to take his life in the spinal cord
 sushumna vah naadee he jo merudand kii nalee main sthit he or masttishk ke neeche tak pahunchati he
 This is not a secret thing
 aankhon se dekhi ja sakati he
 The forearm is roughly as thick as a finger, is solid, there is no hole in it
 praan kaa or saans yaa hawa karanevaalon ko is baat kaa pataa nahin he ki is naadee main hawa ke ghusane ke liye or upar chadhane ke liye koi maarg nahin he
 Such things are said by considering life as a synonym for air that such a great Mahatma has taken his breath in the universe
 saans par niyantran rakhane se nadisanthaan ko sthir karne main nishchay hi sahaayta milti he, parantu yogi kaa mukhya uddeshy praan kaa niyantran he, saans kaa nahin
 Prana is the power that communicates in the umbilical cord
 sharir ke sabhi avyavon ko or sabhi dhaatuon ko praan se hi jivan or sakriyata milti he
 When the body is stabilized and by the action of pranayama, the life moves towards the spinal cord, its flow is drawn from the lower nostrils
 at: ye naadiyaan baahar ke aadhaaton kii ore se ek prakaar se shoonyavat ho jaati hai
 Practicing Pranayam and getting success in Pranayama are two different things
 parantu vairaygy or teevr samveg ke bal se safalataa kaa maarg prashast ho jaataa he
 As the practice becomes stronger, the confidence of the seeker increases
 ek or baat hoti he
 The more he draws his mind away from the senses and his subjects, the more his sense of power also increases, that is, the power of enjoyment of the subjects of the senses also increases
 isiliye pranayam ke baad pratyaahaar kaa naam liya jaataa he
 Pratyahara means to draw the senses from their subjects
 vairaygy ke prasang main yah upadesh diya ja chukaa he parantu pranyam tak pahanchakar iskon vishesh rup se duhraane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Hatha Yoga is the name of the set of postures, pranayama and pratyahar
 khed kii baat he ki kuch abhyaasi yaheen ruk jate hai
 The path of those who move forward is divided into three divisions: dharana, dhyana and samadhi
 in teenon ko ek duusare se bilkul pruthak karnaa asambhav he
 Dharana takes the form of meditation after being confirmed and advanced meditation is called samadhi
 patanjali ne teenon ko sammilit rup se sanyam kaha he
 Dharana is the remedy that helps to concentrate the mind
 yahan upaay shabd kaa ekvachan main prayog hua he parantu vastut: is kaam ke anek upaay hai
 Some of these have come up in the Upanishads
 vaidic vadmay main vidya shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The chanting of a mantra, the deity of a god, a goddess or a mahatma, or the setting of the Sun, Agni, Deepshikha, etc
, in a particular place of the body like heart, idol, mole, ie the point between the two eyes, in some of these places in the imagination, thus All the measures to be taken are under the assumption
 jaisaa ki kuch upayon ko batalaane ke baad patanjali ne yah likh diya he - yathabhimat dhyanadva-jo vastu apane ko acchhee lage usapar hi chitt ko ekagra karne se kaam chal saktaa he
 There is a legend in a Purana that an uneducated person had attained samadhi through his buffalo by converting the mind through his buffalo, on the orders of his guru
 dharna kii sabase uttam paddati vah he jise puraane shabdon main nadanusandhan kehete hai
 Kabir and his later saints have termed it the word Surāt Yoga
 jis prakaar chanchal mrug veena ke swaron se mugdh hokar chaukadi bharna bhul jaataa he, usee prakaar sadhak kaa chitt naad ke prabhaav se chanchalta chhodkar sthir ho jaataa he
 Which is the sound in which an attempt is made to rhythm the attitudes of the mind and how this effort is made, these things are known only from Gurmukh
 antarnad ke sookshmattam rup ko praval, onkaar, kehete hai
 Pranav is virtually nonchalant
 uskaa anubhav kiya ja saktaa he, vaani main vyanjana nahin, nadavindupanishad ke shabdon main: From Pranav's research, the astrological and welfare nad arises
 phir aatma swayan usee prakaar prakat hota he, jese ki badal ke hatane par chandramaa prakat hota he
 The initial word figure is called the symbol of the divine
 yogiyon main sarvatra hi isaki mahima gaai gai he
 In the section of the Bible, called Saint John's Gospel, the first sentence is as follows, the beginning was the word
 vah shabd paramatma ke saath tha
 That word was divine
 sufi sant kehete hai haif dar bande jism darmani, na shunavi saute paake rahamaani du:kha kii baat he ki tu sharir ke bandhan main padaa rahata he or pavitra divya naad ko nahin sunata
 As the concentration of the mind increases, the practitioner has many experiences
 manushya apni indriyon kii shakti se parichit nahin he
 Neither takes nor wants to take from them
 yah baat sunne main aashcharya kii prathit hoti he, par sach he
 Suppose, the power of our eye or the brain of the senses increases manifold from today
 tab na jane aisi kitni vastuen drushtigochar hone lagengi jinako dekhakar ham kaanp uthenge
 If you see the chemical activity within each other, then your loved one will be hated by the person
 hamaare param mitra paas kii kothri main baithe hamaare sambandh main kya kehete hai, yadi yah baat sunne main aa jaay to jeena dubhar ho jaay
 We are effigies of some lusts
 apni indrayon se vahiin tak kaam lete hai jahaan tak vaasanaon kii tripti ho
 That is why the power of the senses remains dormant, but when there is a maximum suppression of lusts through yoga practice, then the senses can work uninterruptedly and give us some idea of the true form of the world
 is vishwa main sparsh, rup, ras or gandh kaa apaar bhandar bharaa padaa he jisaki satta kaa hamako anubhav nahin hai
 On being introverted, the senses open the door of this store in front of us without our efforts
 sushumna main naadiyon kii kai granthiyaan hai, jinamein kai jagahon se ai hui naadiyaan milti hai
 These places are called Chakras
 inamen se vishesh rup se chah chakron kaa charchaa yoga ke granthon main aata he
 At the bottom is the muladhar which is usually at the place where the spinal cord begins
 or sabase upar ajna chakra he jo til ke sthaan par he
 It is also called the third eye
 thodaa or upar chalakar sushumna mastishk ke naadisanthaan se mil jaati he
 At the topmost place of the brain called the cerebrum in physiology is the Sahasrarachakra
 jaisaa ki ek mahatma ne kaha he: Mantmantra Karaband Vichari Seven Chakras New Shodhai Nari
 
 Some of Yogi's early experiences are indicated above
 aise kuch anubhavon kaa ullekh shwetashwar upanishad main bhi kiya gaya he
 There he has said that Anal, Anil, Surya, Chandra, Khadyot, Dhoom, Sphulling, Tare are expressive Yogis, all these are the signs to express in Yoga, that is, through this Yogi can believe that i am following the right path
 iske upar samadhi tak pahonchte pahonchte yogi ko jo anubhav hote hai unka varnan karnaa asambhav he
 The reason is that ordinary people do not find any symbol or word to describe them
 achche yogiyon ne unke varnan ke sambandh main kaha he ki yah kaam vaisaa hi he jaise goonga gud khaay
 Even a full person cannot describe the taste of an object in words, then the poor poor are unable
 gud ke swaad kaa kuch parichay falon ke swaad se yaa kisi anya mithi chiz ke saadrishy ke aadhaar par diya bhi ja saktaa he, par jaisaa anubhav hamako saadhaarant: hota hi nahin, vah to sachmuch vaani ke pare hai
 Asmita remains down to a little below the supreme role of Samadhi
 apni pruthak satta aham asmi yah pratiti rahati he
 Ahm asmi = i am the child, that is, because of this constant feeling there is the power of time
 iske baad jhini avidya maatr rah jaati he
 The state of his death is called asamprajnata samadhi in which avidya also decays and the imaginary relationship with the head is severed
 yah yoga kii paraakaashtha he
 Next, the door of scripture opens again
 sankhya ke acharya kehete hai ki jo yogi purush yahan tak pahunchaa, uske liye phir to prakruti kaa khel band ho jaataa he
 Continues for other people
 vah is baat ko yon samajhaate hai
 Dancing is happening somewhere
 kai vyakti use dekh rahe hai
 There is a person among them who has no interest in that dance
 vah nartki kii ore se aankh pher letaa he
 There is no dance for him
 duusare ke liye vah rochak he
 He has said that with that aja, that is, with the nitya, aja ekolanushete = one does ajaan and Jahatyenam bhuktabhogam tathanya: - Satisfied by his enjoyment and gives up another
 advait vedant ke acharya sankhyasammat purushon kii anekta ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Apart from them, there are many philosophical sects which have their own different doctrines
 pehle kaha ja chukaa hai ki is shastrarth main yahaan padane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hai
 As far as the practical form of yoga is concerned, no one is opposed to it
 vedant ke acharya bhi nirdidhyasana kii upyogita ko sweekaar karte hai or vedant darshan main vyas ne bhi asakridabhyasat ore asin: sambhwata jaise sutron main iskaa samarthan kiya he
 This much is enough for us
 saadhaarant: yoga ko ashtaang kaha jaataa he parantu yahan ab tak asana se lekar samadhi tak chah angon kaa hi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The remaining two organs are not left out because they are unnecessary, but because they are not only a yogi but are extremely useful only to human beings
 unamem pratham sthaan yama kaa he
 It has been said in relation to these that this country is unbroken and universal Mahabrata from time to time, that is, every human should follow them at every place at every time and in every stage
 doosraa ang niyam kehalaata he
 For those who do not accept the authority of God, there is no one else to have allegiance to God
 parantu vah log bhi praaia: kisi na kisi aise vyakti par shraddha rakhte hai jo unke liye ishwar tulya he
 The allegiance Buddhist has to Buddhadev is no less than what any theist would have on God
 ek or baat he
 Whether one has reverence for God or not, there should be exclusive reverence for the teacher of yoga path
 yogabhyasi ke liye guru kaa sthaan kisi bhi drushti se ishwar se kam nahin
 God may or may not exist, but there can be no doubt about the existence of a guru
 ek sadhak charnadas ji kii shishyaa sahjobai ne kaha he: Now-a-days it is heard that knowledge is sufficient to achieve ultimate effort
 yoga kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Those who say so do not seriously consider the meaning of the word knowledge
 gyaan do prakaar kaa hota he-tajgyaan or tadvishyak gyaan
 There is a difference between the two
 koi vyakti apana sara jivan rasayan aadi shastron ke adhyayan main bitaakar shakkar ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt kar saktaa he
 Which chemical elements have how many atoms in a sugar molecule? How is Sugar Made? What are the normal actions and reactions on it? And so on
 yah sab shakkar vishyak gyaan he
 This can also be useful, but the actual knowledge of sugar is only when a pinch of sugar is placed in the mouth
 yah shakkar kaa tatvagyan he
 The knowledge gained from the study of the scriptures is true spiritual knowledge and in the light of this, the knowledge that is perceptible can also be fully understood
 isiliye upanishad ke anusaar jab yama ne nachiketa ko aadhyatm gyaan kaa upadesh diya to uske saath main yogavidhi c kritsnam kii bhi diksha di, nahin to nachiketa kaa bodh adhuraa hi rah jaataa
 Those who praise Bhakti etc
 in a spiritual way should also keep in mind that if there is any way to concentrate the finances in their path, then it is really under the concept of Yoga
 yah unki marji he ki sanathan yoga shabd ko chhodkar naye shabdon kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 The practice of yoga gives rise to the kind of powers which are called Vibhuti or Siddhi
 yadi paryaapt samay tak abhyaas karne ke baad bhi kisi manushya main aisi asaadhaaran shaktiyon kaa aagam nahin hua to yah maananaa chahie ki vah thik maarg par nahin chal rahaa he
 But there is no magic in siddhis
 indriyon kii shakti bahut adhik he parantu saadhaarant: hamako uskaa gyaan nahin hota or na ham usase kaam lete hai
 The practitioner gets to know about that power, he has such experiences in relation to the nature of the world which others do not have
 dur kii yaa chhipi hui vastu ko dekh lenaa, vyavahrut baton ko sun lenaa ityadi indriyon kii sahaj shakti kii seemaa ke bheetar kii bate hai parantu saadhaaran manushya ke liye yah aashcharyash kaa vishay hai, inakon siddhi kaha jaayga
 Similarly, there are many more powers in humans which remain dormant in the normal state
 yoga ke abhayas se jaag uthati hai
 If we are going somewhere on a road, then going ahead towards our goal, we will see the subjects present on the right and left
 sach to yah he ki jo koi in vishyon ko dekhne ke liye rukegaa vah gantavya sthaan tak pahunchega hi nahin ore bich main hi rah jaayga
 That is why it is said that whoever tries for Siddhis deprives himself of samadhi
 patanjali ne kaha he: That is, these icons are obstacles in samadhi, but in the state of rising from samadhi, it is called siddhi
 namaste yaa namaskara mukhyatah hinduon or bharatiyon dwaara ek duusare se milane par abhivadan or vinamrata pradarshit karne hetu prayukt shabd he
 This sense means that there is a divine consciousness and light in the heart of all human beings, which is situated in the Anahata Chakra
 yah shabd sanskrit ke namas shabd se niklaa he
 This Bhavamudra means the gratitude of one soul to another
 dainandin jivan main namaste shabd kaa prayog kisi se milane hai yaa vidaa lete samay shubhakamanaayen pradarshit karne yaa abhivadan karne hetu kiya jaataa he
 In addition to Namaste, use the word Namaskar and Pranam
 sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se isaki utpatti is prakaar he- namaste= namah+te
 That means hello to you
 sanskrit main pranaam yaa aadar ke liye 'namah' avyay prayukt hota he, jaise- "suryaay namah" 
 Similarly here, "chaturthi" of Yushmad is used for "I salute you"
 vaise "tumhaare liye" ke liye sanskrit kaa saamaanya prayog "tubhyan" he, parantu usee kaa vaikalpik, sankshipt rup "te" bhi bahut prayukt hota he, yahan vahi prayukt hua he
 So Namaste literally means hello to you
 ise "tumko pranaam" yaa "tumhen pranaam" bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 But its Sanskrit form always remains "namah for you", because Namah Avyay always accompanies Chaturthi Vibhakti, such is the rule
 namaste karne ke liye, dono haathon ko anahath chak par rakhaa jaataa he, ankhen band kii jaati hai or sir ko jhukaaya jaataa he
 other than this namaste shabd ab vishwavyaapee ho gaya he
 In most places of the world, its meaning and meaning is understood and used
 fishan ke taur par bhi kai jagah namaste bolne kaa rivaaj he
 Although "namaste" in the West is spoken in combination with Bhavamudra, in India it is believed that Bhavamudra means Namaste and therefore, it is not considered necessary to speak the word
 haathon ko hriday chakra par laakar divine prem kaa bahaav hota he
 Tilting the head and closing the eyes means surrendering oneself to the Lord seated in the heart
 gahare dhyaan main doobane ke liye bhi swayan ko namaste kiya ja saktaa he; jab yah kisi or ke saath kiya jaae to yah ek sundar or teevr dhyaan hota he
 When a teacher and a student say hello to each other, two people come to each other energetically at a connected point devoid of time and space and are free from ego
 yadi yah hriday kii gahari bhaavana se man ko samarpit karke kiya jaae to do atmaaon ke madhya ek athmiya sambandh banataa he
 Ideally, Namaste should be done at the beginning and end of the class
 aamtaur par yah kaksha kii samaapti par kiya jaataa he ktonki tab man kam sakriy hota he or kamare kii urja adhik shant hoti he
 The teacher greets his students and his teachers by saying hello and welcomes his students to become equally knowledgeable and that truth may flow

 Bank rate is the rate at which the central bank provides loans to commercial banks on first-class securities
 bainkon ko apane dainik kaamkaaj ke liye praaia: aisi badi rakam kii jarurat hoti he jinaki miyaad ek din se zyada nahin hoti
 For this, the most common option that banks adopt is to take an overnight loan from the central bank
 is karj par rigerv bank ko unhen jo byaaj dena padataa he, use hi ripo dar kehete hai
 Lowering the repo rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Reserve Bank and hence the banks reduce the interest rates so that the maximum amount can be given as loan
 ripo dar main badhotaree kaa sidhaa matlab yah hota he ki bainkon ke liye rigerv bank se raat bhar ke liye karj lenaa mahangaa ho jayega
 It is clear that the interest rate that banks decide to give loans to others, they also have to increase it
 ine-e-ekabari, ek 16veen shatabdi kaa byorevar granth he
 It was composed by Abul Fazal, a Navratan courtier of Akbar

 Combining more than 50 other satellites and rings makes up only 0

 The following objects have not been confirmed as solid bodies
 It is not yet clear if these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the f Ring
 Two moons were claimed to be discovered by different astronomers but never seen again
 Both moons were said to orbit between Titan and Hyperion

 arthshaastra ke sandarbh main, kisi aarthik prakram kaa model us prakram main nihit charon ke bich ek taarkik / sankhyatmak sammbandh he
 Like other models, an economic model is often a simplified mathematical representation of a complex economic process
 modelon kaa upyog karke is baat kii jaanch kii ja sakati he aarthik prakriya ke kisi char ko badalane par arthtantra par kya prabhaav hoga
 In general terms, economic models have two functional parts: the first is simplification as a means of selecting data based on a paradigm of econometric studies, and the second as abstraction from observed data
 sarleekaran aarthik prakriyaaon kii baari jatilta ko dekhte hue arthshaastra ke liye vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he
 This complexity can be attributed to the variety of factors that determine economic activity
 ; in karkon main shaamil hai: vyaktigat or sahakaari nirnay prakriyaaon, sansadhano kii seemaa, paryaavaran or bhugolic baadhaae, sansthagat or kanoonee aavashyaktaaon or vishuddh rup se betaratib utaar chadhaav
 Therefore econometric relationships between these variables are relevant and are useful in analyzing and presenting information
 is ke kaaran char or jinamein se ek tark kaa chayan karnaa chahie
 The nature of an economic model will often be seen as to what will determine the facts, and how they will be compiled, because selection is important
 udhaaharan ke mudrasphiti ke liye ek saamaanya aarthik avadharana he, lekin ek arthshaastri kii keemat main vaastavik parivartan ke bich antar kar sakate hai, iskaa kaaran ye he ki mudrasphiti ko maapne ke liye, vyavhaar kaa ek model kii aavashyaktaa he, or mulya main parivartan mudrasphiti ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he
 In addition to their professional academic interest, the use of the model includes: vitt main bhavishya kahanevaala model udhaaharan ke ubharate bazaar ke band ke liye, trading ke liye 1980 ke dashak ke baad se istemaal kiya gaya he aksar unhen jari karne vaale vikasshil raashtra ke vikaas kii bhavishyavaanee aarthik model ke aadhaar par kaarobaar kar rahe the
 Since the 1990s, many long-term risk management models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to explore high-risk future scenarios
 ek model tark or swatantra rup se charchaa kii or pareekshan kiya or kaha ki vibhinn maamalon main lagu kiya ja saktaa he ho saktaa he ki ganit ko lagu karne ke liye ek taarkik dhaancha sthapit karata he
 Policies and rationale soundness, relying on the economic model, do not have a clear basis for the semantic validity of the support model
 vartmaan main upyog main aarthik model aarthik sab kuch ke siddhanton hone kaa naatak nahin he; kisi bhi tarah ke dikhaavon turant computesnal, avyavhaarya or aarthik vyavhaar ke vibhinn prakaaron ke liye siddhanton kii apurnataa yaa kami se naakaam kar diya jayega
 Therefore the conclusions drawn from the model will be approximate representations of economic facts
 haalanki, thik se nirmaan model bahari jaankaree ko dur karne or mahatvapurn rishte kii upyogi anumaanit vishay alag kar sakate hai
 By trying to understand the whole economic process in this way more than can be understood about the relationships in question
 model nirmaan kaa byora model ke prakaar or uske aavedan ke saath badalati hai, lekin ek saamaanya prakriya pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Generally any modeling process has two stages: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy
 ek model yah sahi yah varnan abhipraay he ki rishton ko darpan he ki seemaa tak hi upyogi he kyonki naidanik kadam mahatvapurn he
 Creating and diagnosing a model is often an iterative process in which the model is modified and then modified with each iteration specified
 ek santoshjanak model paaya jaataa he ek baar, yah dabl ek alag data set karne ke liye ise lagu karne se jaanch kii jaani chahie
 Model Types All model variables are deterministic, according to whether the economic model can be classified as stochastic or non-stochastic model; All variables are quantitative, according to whether the economic models are classified as discrete or continuous election models; According to the intended purpose / function of the model, it can be classified as quantitative or qualitative; According to the scope of the model, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; According to the characteristics of the economic agent, the model can be classified as the representative agent model, rational agent model, etc
 • Stochastic models are formulated using procedures
 ve samay ke saath aarthik rup se namoodaar mulyon model
 Most of econometrics is based on statistics and test hypotheses to formulate about these processes or inference parameters for them
 tinberjen swachaalit pratigaami or baad main vold ne lokapriy saral arthmetiya model kii ek vyapak rup se istemaal saudebaaji varg stocastic prakriya vartmaan or ateet ke mulyon ke bich kuch sambandh santusht jisamen swachaalit pratigaami model hai
 Examples of these relate to the automatic regressive moving average model and thus the automatic regressive conditional heteroskedasticity for modeling heteroskedasticity and the Zi, A, Su, C, Ech model
 • gaiyr-stocastic model yaa maatraatmak vishuddh rup se gunatmak ho saktaa he
 In some cases, in a coincidence of a model, economic predictors only emphasize the direction of movement of economic variables, and therefore functional relations are only used in a qualitative sense to equate: for example, if demand for an item Increases, that item will decrease
 is tarah ke model ke liye, arthshaastriyon aksar bajaay kaaryon kii do-aiami rekhankan kaa upyog karen
 • Qualitative models - Although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are sometimes used
 ek udhaaharan sambhav bhavishya kii ghatnaon ke baahar khelaa jaataa he, jisamen gunatmak paridrishy kii yojana bana rahaa he
 Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis
 gunatmak model aksar parishuddhta kii kami se peedit hai
 • At a more practical level, quantitative modeling is applied to many fields of economics and many methods are developed more or less independent of each other
 natijatan, koi samgr model vargeekaran swaabhaavik rup se uplabdh he
 We do however model that an accounting model is based on the fact that there is a debit for every credit
 adhik pratikatmak, ek lekha model ke rup main sangrakshan ke kuch siddhant vyakt This principle is certainly true for money and is the basis for national income accounting
 lekha model sammelan se sach kar rahe hai, ki unhen is baat kii pushti karne ke liye kisi bhi prayogtmak vifaltaa he, dhokhadhadi, ganit truti yaa ham anuchit tareeke se yojit kiya gaya prayog dikhaane ke rup main vyakhya karegaa jo nakadi kii ek bahari injection, ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya kiya jayega
 Optimal utility and constrained optimization model - Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as maximizing profit or utility
 is tarah ke ek model kaa ek udhaaharan laabh adhiktam form par karadhaan kii tulanaatmak sthiti dwaara diya jaataa he
 The profit of a firm is given by \ pi = xp - c - tx \ quad laabh badhaane dharna he ki dar form ke laabh ko adhiktam karata he, to ek form utpaadan dar x par utpaadan hoga jo bataata he
 We use this differential algorithm, under which one can obtain x conditions
 eks ke liye pehle ke aadesh ko adhiktam shart he \ frac{ \ partial \ pi}{ \ partial x} = \ frac{ \ partial - C)}{ \ partial x} -t= 0 \ frac { \ partial ^ 2 - C)} { \ partial ^ 2 x} = { \ partial ^ 2 \ pi \ over \ partial x ^ 2}, jo ek sthaneey adhiktam ke liye doosraa aadesh kii sthiti se santusht hai, to nakaaratmak he
 Disadvantages Unrealistic assumptions capable of proving restrictive, unrealistic assumptions are widespread in neoclassical economic theory, and those beliefs are inherited by simple models for the theory
 joseph stigalits 'san 2001 main nobel puraskaar vyaakhyaan soochna vishmataaon par apane kaam kii samiksha karata he, "bilkul sahi jaankaree" kii, maanak model main, dharna ke saath virodhabhaason jo
 The Stiglitz surveys faulty policy implications and recommendations that arise from many aspects of these flawed normative models, and their unrealistic assumptions
 stigalits likhte hai: The Economic Model It is easy to ignore its limitations that it can be such a powerful tool in understanding certain economic relationships
 aarthik model kii seemaa vaastaviktaa se takaraa gai, lekin phir bhi nafta, uttar america mukt vyapaar samjhaute ke prabhaav kaa anukaran karne ke liye saarvajanik niti bahes, shaamil model main "saboot" ke rup main sweekaar kar liya gaya he, jahaan ek thos udhaaharan he
 James Stanford published his examination of 10 of these models
 moulik mudde ko gheraa he: tab us, vastav main, model ke "utpaadan" un manyataon kii vaidhata kaa samarthan karata he "sabit" ke liye aage badhane, ek model main moolbhoot "input" exioms rup main ek kii manyataon ke abhinn hissaa hone kaa kaaran he
 Such a model has adopted the same assumptions that correspond to similar models
 lekin yah vaastaviktaa ke anuroop he? ham apane bhavishya kahanevaala kshamta main koi vishwaas karne ke liye kar rahe hai, to kisi bhi vaigyanik siddhant ke rup main, anubhavjanya satyaapan kii jarurat he
 Those assumptions are, in fact, basic aspects of empirical reality, so the output of this model will accurately describe reality
 main kachra, kachra baahar "- un manyataon ek anukaran karne kaa prayaas vaastaviktaa kaa khaas pahalu ke liye maanya nahin hai lekin agar he, to yah" ji,i,ji,o 'kaa maamla ban jaataa he
 This issue is outlined by specific advocates for James Stanford NAFTA, in the public policy debate as evidence that specific countable general equilibrium models: stenford ke vishleshan par tippanee karte hue ek computer vaigyanik ne likhaa he, Joseph Stiglitz is only slightly more diplomatic in commenting on the general phenomenon integral to the unrealistic "G, A, G, O" assumptions in the neoclassical economic model stigalits 'san 2001 main nobel puraskaar vyaakhyaan kii pramukhataa ke baavjood, navashastreey model ko gumraah karne kaa upyog in lekhakon ke anusaar, 2007 main kaayam he: The "ridicule myths falsity of countable general equilibrium model" work provides both a paper, a history, and a readable theoretical analysis of what the C, G, ME models are, and are not
 vishesh rup se, unke naam ke baavjood, si,ji,i model walrus saamaanya santulan, or na hi saamaanya santulan vyavasthaaen na upyog karen
 The selves — which have been largely maligned by Joseph Stiglitz — thus distorting the simplifications of the C, G, e models — highly theoretical frameworks — collectively called the "neoclassical economic paradigm"
 apane 2001 ke nobel puraskaar vyaakhyaan ke "samaapan tippanee" main, stigalits kyon apane moulik parinaamon main se kuch kii ek dashak pehle se adhik apane prakaashan ke baavjood yah bani rahati he par aadhaarit navashastreey pratimaan or modelon, dikhaa rahaa he ki jaanch kii soochna vishmataaon ki pratimaan or apane modelon kii mul manyataon avaidh: In the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global economic downturn, the profession's attachment to the unrealistic model is increasingly being questioned and criticized
 ek hafte tak chali kaaryshaala ke baad, arthshaastriyon ke ek samooh avastavik model ke apane peshey ke aniatik upyog kii atyadhik mahatvapurn ek patr jari kiya
 His abstract provides an indictment of fundamental practices: galat aarthik model hai ? jaanch kii jane main sakasham aarthik model or koi se nahin kar rahe hai ki un logon ke bich teevr antar ek saarvbhaumik ek sweekaar kiye jate hai iskaa matlab he
 Indeed any claim in a setteris paribus economics is nothing more than an all-purpose escape clause that merits the argument that can and allows the claim to be equalized by reason about the model
 Attempting to hold all consecutive variables except a few
 is vishisht rishte kii judaai or spashtikaran kii anumati detaa he
 But, in reality everything else is never equal, so the economic models are determined not to be accurate
 model kelkshya ko alag-thalag or saral sambandh yah vaastaviktaa ke liye lagu kiya ja rahaa karne main sakasham ek siddhant he ki mukhya rup se pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he ki kuch bhavishyavaanee karne kii shakti he ki he
 To qualify as a theory, a model must answer three questions: What theory ?, we should pay attention to why ?, what merit lies in its explanation? If the model fails to do so, it probably differs from reality and meaningful social issues to qualify as too much theory
 is teen sawaal pareekshan ke anusaar anusandhan kaa aayojan aarthik siddhant ke jarnal ke 2004 sanskaran main, lekh kaa keval 12% teen aavashyaktaaon ko santusht he ki paata he
 Another failure is made when the Setteris Paribus assumption is made, neglecting the fact that a model is often implemented when major failures are often made

 2 - To provide general public health information - This work is mainly done by the Health Department but many voluntary health institutions and other organizations which are interested in this work can work in a supportive manner

 Apart from this, all other devices should also be used
 jisase adhik se adhik janata kaa dhyaan swasthya shiksha kii ore aakarshith ho sake
 For this it is best to appoint special types of practical and educated health teachers

 Berlin's condition deteriorated during World War II and it was severely devastated
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, yah kai bhaagon main vibhajit ho gaya or vibhinn shaktiyon ne isapar apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 In fact, at this time this city had become the subject of political pull
 phir bhi dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti ke baad se vibhinn khandon main hote hue bhi berlin ne phir unnati karnaa prarambh kiya parantu vah apni puraani sthiti main ab bhi nahin aa sakaa he
 Looking at the traffic and communication in Berlin shows that there is a lot of movement in West Berlin by air

 The manufactured goods of the local industries business here have been sent out by airplanes
 vaise saamanyat: rail dwaara bhi yatayaat prachlit he
 Sometimes, interruptions are interrupted by the Soviet government over certain things
 purvi kshetra se drutagami rele purvi germany tathaa madhya europe ke anya bhaagon main purv, pashchim rail yatayaat ke antargat, khub prachlit hai
 Whatever it is, it is certain that the traffic in Berlin has been very obstructive due to various political circumstances
 berlin main ek bhaag se duusare bhaag ke bich yatayaat seva prachlit he parantu vibhageeya simaaon par railgadiyaan badalani padati hai
 The people of East Berlin keep going to West Berlin every day for shoplifting
 vastav main dekha jaae to purvi tathaa pashchimi germany kii samasya ne berlin ke vyapaarik mahatv ko kam kar diya he, visheshkar jalayatayaat ke maamle main
 Prior to 1945, Berlin city was the center of Germany's famous trade, insurance, banking and brokerage
 saath hi asankhya vishaal bhawanon ke karyaalay bhi rahe
 The city remained unrivaled even in the matters of industry, and it had a prominent position in Europe in making scientific equipment, electrical goods, machines, motors, textiles, aircraft, machine tools, turbines, tractors, lenses, etc
 of every kind
 san 1945 ke baad se berlin ne apni aarthik kshamta ko phir se kaayam karne kii koshish kii parantu yahan kii vicitra kathin raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne pashchim berlin ko kaaphi pangu bana diya jisase berogari kii samasya kaaphi bad gai

 isamen kisi achumbakeey padaarth ke urdhwadhar dhaanche par vidyutarodhi taanbe ke taar kii ek vrittakar kundali lagi rahati he
 The horoscope usually consists of 552 rounds, with connective screws after 2, 50 and 500 rounds
 inaki sahaayta se aavashyatanusaar kam yaa adhik chakkaron se kaam le sakate hai
 The circular coil can be rotated around the vertical axis
 kundali ke centre par ek chumbakeey sui urdhwadhar kilak par sadhi rahati he or sui ke lamberup ek aluminium kaa lanbaa sanketak laga rahata he, jo sooyee ke saath saath kshaitij vrittakar scale par ghumta he or chumbakeey sooyee kaa vikshep batalaata he
 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 Before measuring the current, they make the base of the dielectric horizontal and rotate the plane of the coil to the magnetic meridian
 is dasha main chumbakeey sui ke baks ko kundali ke centre par kshaijit sthiti main rakhte hai or yah bhi dekh lete hai ki sanketak ke donon sire 0 degree - 0 degree par sthit he ab dharamapi ke do sanyojak penchon ko us paripath main sambhddha kar dete hai jisamen dhara kaa pravaah hota he
 As the current flows in the vertical coil, a magnetic field is created, which forms a right angled horizontal earth magnetic field
 un donon chumbakeey kshetron ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee par do vipareet disha main ghumaanevaale balyugma kaary karte hai
 The needle is deflected and stops in such a situation where the rotations of both the balugams are equal
 yadi sooyee kaa vikshep q ho, to dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : That is, the current flowing in the currentometer is proportional to the tangent of the deflection angle
 niyatank dharamapi kaa parivartan gunak kehalaata he
 The change multiplier is measured in amperes
 yah us vidyutdhara ke baraabar hota he, jo dharamapi kii sooyee main 45 degree kaa vikshep utpann kar sakati he
 This type of simple tangent dormometer is not sufficiently subtle and accurate
 vishesh rup se dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata chumbakeey sui ke donon dhruvon par ek si nahin hoti
 This leads to an error in the current, because the formula relies on having the same magnetic field at both poles
 isliye isi siddhant par aadhaarit ek doosraa dharamapi bana, jise helmholts galavenometer kehete hai
 This is not an error in the currentometer and it is much more sensitive than a simple tangentometer
 isamen achumbakeey padaarth ke do urdhwadhar dhaanchon par vrittakar kundaliyaan hoti hai
 The distance between their centers is equal to their radius
 chumbakeey sooyee kaa baks donon kundiliyon ke kshaitij aksh par thik bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The wires of both the coils are connected in such a way that the magnetic fields produced from both are in the same direction when current flows in them
 aisa hone se chumbakeey sooyee ke paas dharaa se utpann chumbakeey kshetra adhik teevr ho jaataa he or yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki is kshetra kii tivrata sooyee ke donon siron par ek si rahati he
 As a result of this change, this thermometer becomes more sensitive and accurate
 dhara naapane ke pehle sooyee ke baks ke samtal ko kshaitij karnaa or urdhwadhar kundaliyon ko chumbakeey yamyottar main karnaa aavashyak he
 After this adjustment, when current flows in the coil of the dielectric and there is an angle deflection in the magnetic needle, the value of the current is known by the following formula: g ko helmholts dharamapi kaa pavirthan gunak kehete hai
 This thermometer is also not sufficiently sensitive
 adhik sookshmagrahi dharamapi banane ke liye ek nayaa siddhant prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 That is, if the effect of the earth magnetic field is reduced on the magnetic needle, then any current will cause the magnetic needle to have greater deflection than before, meaning the device will become more sensitive
 isko asthaitik yugma kaa siddhant kehete hai
 If two nearly equal magnetic rotating magnets are attached to a rigid rod so that they are parallel to each other and their opposite poles are close together, they are called an inertial pair
 is yugma main donon chumbakon ke vipareet dhruv paas paas hote hai, is kaaran parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav is yugma par bahut kam padataa he
 The coil or coils of the wire are wrapped around a magnet or both magnets in such a way that the currents are exerted on the magnets in the same direction
 is dasha main yadi kundaliyon main nune dhara bhi pravahit ha, ta bha chumbakeey yugma main adhik vikshep hota he
 This type of dielectric is very sensitive
 yadi is chumbakeey yugma ko ek anthnrahit latakan dwaara lataka diya jaae or is latakan main ek chota sa darpan laga diya jaae, to prakaash kiran dwaara ati sakshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he
 The rays of light are reflected from the mirror of the photometer by moving from the lamp and come into focus on a scale by a lens
 jab dhara pravaah ke kaaran chumbakeey yugma main vikshep hota he or darpan kone q dwaara ghumta he, to parvartit prakaash kirne kone 2Q main gumti hai or scale par prakashabindu main sthanantaran ho jaataa he
 By this method, the micro-deflection of the needle can be measured and as a result, the extreme current can be measured with this thermometer
 asthaitik chumbakeey yugma kaa prayog kai prakaar se vibhinn naamon ke dharamapiyon main kiya gaya he
 Calvin Dharmapi, Pashen Dharmapi and Broca Dharmapi are some examples

 ‘nirmala’ ke baad ‘gaban’ premchand kaa doosraa yathartwaadee upanyaas he
 Must say that this is the sequel to its development
 gaban kaa mul vishay he - 'mahilaon kaa pati ke jivan par prabhaav'
 Gaban is a novel related to a particular worrying topic of Premchand
 yah vishay he, gahanon ke prati patni ke lagaav kaa pati ke jivan par prabhaav
 The real depiction of the middle class wandering in the darkness of the values crumbling in the drone was made

 saamaajik jivan or katha-sahitya ke liye yah ek nai disha kii ore sanket karata he
 This novel explores the reality of life more deeply, breaking the illusion
 nae raste talashne ke liye pathak ko nai prerana detaa he
 The heroine of 'gaban', Jalpa, is eager to get a moon
 uskaa pati kam vetan vaala clerk he yadhyapi vah apni patni ke saamne bahut amir hone kaa abhinay karata he
 To satisfy his wife, he smokes from his office and runs away to Calcutta where a bier and his wife shelter him
 dakaiti ke ek jaali maamle main police use fansaakar mubir kii bhoomika main prastut karti he
 His wife arrives in Calcutta, filled with rage, and helps him get out of prison
 isi bich police kii taanaashaahee ke viruddh ek badi jan-jagriti shuru hoti he
 In this novel, the reader experiences the touch of the vast mass movements
 laghu ghatnaon se aarambh hokar rashtriya jivan main bade-bade tufaan uth khadey hote hai
 The culmination of Jalpa from a greedy woman of petty instinct to a national heroine is the culmination of Premchand's pen's artistry
 isamen do kathanak hai - ek prayag se sambaddh or doosraa kolkata se sambaddh
 Both plotlines are interlinked by Jalpaki arbitration
 kathanak main anaavashyak ghatnaon or vistaar kaa abhaav he
 Mahasadh Deendayal, the headman of the zamindar of Prayag's small village, and Jalpa, the only daughter of Manki, had longed for jewelery, especially Chandrahar, since childhood
 vah swapn dekhati thi ki vivaah ke samay uske liye chandrahaar zarur chadhega
 When he was married to Ramanath, the useless son of servant Munshi Dayanath in the court, there were more ornaments in the offering, Chandrahar was not there
 isse jalpa ko ghor niraashaa hui
 Deendayal and Dayanath both spent more than their wedding in marriage
 dayanath ne kachhari main rahete hue rishwat kii kamai se munh mode rakhaa tha
 In the marriage of the son, he fell in debt
 dayanath to chandrahaar bhi chadhaanaa chaahate the lekin unki patni jageshwari ne unka prastaav radd kar diya tha
 a Sakhi princess of Jalpa instigates her to obtain Chandrahar
 jalpa chandrahaar kii tech lekar hi sasuraal gayi
 The condition of the house was poor, but Ramanath had taken great pride of his family in front of Jalpa
 karz utaarne ke liye jab pita ne jalpa ke kuch gahane chupake se laane ke liye kaha to ramanath kuch maansik sangharsh ke baad aabhushanon kaa sandook chupake se uthaakar unhen de aate he or jalpa se chori ho jane kaa bahaanaa kar dete hai kintu apane is kapatpurna vyavhaar se unhen aatmaglani hoti he, visheshat: jab ki ve apni patni se atyadhik prem karte hai
 Jalpa's life becomes angry
 ab ramanath ko naukari kii chintaa hoti he
 He gets a monthly job of thirty rupees in octroi with the help of his chess companions Vidhur and Ramesh Babu, a taxman
 jalpa ko ve apana vetan chalis rupee bataate hai
 At the same time, Jalpa receives a Chandrahar sent by her mother, but she does not accept it as a donation in kindness
 ab ramanath main jalpa ke liye gahane banavaane kaa hausala paidaa hota he
 This confidence is fulfilled even when they are laden with debt
 indubhushan vakil kii patni ratan ko jalpa ke jadaau kangan bahut achche lagate hai
 Similarly, she gives 600 rupees to Ramanath for fetching the bracelet
 sarraf in rupayon ko karjkhaate main jamaakar ramanath ko kangan udhaar dene se inkaar kar detaa hai
 Ratan continues to look for the bracelets equally
 ant main vah apane rupee hi waapas laane ke liye kahati he
 With the thought of returning his rupees, Ramanath brings home only Rs
 unki anupasthiti main jab ratan apane rupee maangane aati hai to jalpa unheen rupayon ko uthaakar de detii hai
 When Ramanath came to know about coming home, he was very worried
 gaban ke maamle main unki sazaa ho sakati thi
 Explaining the whole situation, he wrote a letter to his wife
 ve use apni patni ko dene yaa na dene ke bare main soch hi rahe the, ki vah patr jalpa ko mil jaataa hai
 Seeing her read the letter, they feel so self-deluded that they run away from home, Jalpa returns her tax money by selling her jewelry
 iske pashchaat katha kalkatte kii ore mudati he
 In Calcutta, Ramanath opens a tea shop after secretly staying with his benevolent Devidin Khatik for a few days
 ve apni vaastaviktaa chhipaae rahete hai
 One day while they were returning from watching the drama, the police catch them in Shubeh
 ghabrahat main ramanath apane gaban aadi ke bare main sari katha suna dete hai
 The policemen by their investigations do not leave them innocent and present them as witnesses of a case against the revolutionaries
 jail- jivan se bhaybheet hone ke kaaran ramanath pulisavaalon kii baat maan lete hai
 The police put them comfortably in a bungalow and a prostitute named Zohra was appointed to entertain them
 udhar jalpa ratan ke paraamarsh se shatranj- sambandhi 50 / - kaa ek vigyaapan prakashit karti he
 The person who won the advertisement was Ramanath and this made Jalpa aware that he was in Calcutta
 khojate- khojate vah devidin khatic ke yahan pahunch jaati he or ramanath ko police ke kuchakr se nikaalane kii asafal cheshtaa karti he
 Ratan also comes to Calcutta to treat her old husband on the same day
 pati kii mrityu ke baad vah jalpa kii sahaayta karne main kisi prakaar kaa sankoch prakat nahin karti
 After testifying against the revolutionaries, he received a letter from Jalpa, which changed his sentiment
 unhone jaj ke saamne sari vaastaviktaa prakat kar di, jisase usko vishwaas ho gaya ki nirparaadh vyaktiyon ko dand diya gaya he
 The judge withdrew his first decision
 ramanath, jalpa, johra aadi waapas aakar prayag ke sameep rahane lage
 The self-esteem rises again in Ramanath due to the Jalpa
 zohara vaishya- jivan chhodkar seva- vrath dhaaran karti he
 Ramanath and Jalpa also follow the seva-marg
 johra ne apni seva, aatm- tyaag or saral swabhaav se sabhi ko mugdh kar liya tha
 Ratan died
 ek baar prayag ke sameep ganga main duubate hue yatri ko bachaate samay bhi bah gayi
 Ramanath tried to go ahead to save him
 jalpa bhi pani main kud padi thi
 Ramanath could not proceed
 ek shakti aage khinchati thi, ek peeche
 The power ahead was Anurag, despair, sacrifice
 bandhan ne roak liya
 Zohra was an item of luxury in Calcutta
 prayag main uske ghar ke praani- jaisaa vyavhaar hota tha
 Dayanath and Rameshwari were pacified by saying that she is the widowed daughter-in-law of Devidin
 johra main aatmshuddhi kii jyoti jagamaga uthi thi
 Ramanath and Jalpa return home with their weak hope
 unki aankhon ke saamne johra kii tasviir khadi ho jaati thi

 This is called apartheid policy or objection

 This policy was abolished in 1994
 iske viruddh nelson mandela ne bahut sangharsh kiya jiske liye unhen lambe samay tak jail main rakhaa gaya
 In Afrikaans, the language of white citizens of Dutch descent living in South Africa, 'aparthide' literally means parthaka, or nonchalance

 The National Party was a coalition of Afrikaner groups and factions aimed at implementing a program of racial discrimination based on the pillars of racial superiority of whites
 malan dwaara chunaav ke dauraan diye gayi naare ne hi aparthid ko rangabhedi arth pradaan kiye
 The formulation of the philosophical and ideological aspects of apartheid was played by the Boer nationalist thinker Heinrich Varvord
 iske baad rangabhed agali aadhi sadi tak dakshin africa ke raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik jivan par chaa gaya
 He also influenced international relations
 nabbe ke dashak main african naishanal congress or nelson mandela ke netritv main bahusankhyak ashweton kaa loktantric shashan sthapit hone ke saath hi rangabhed kaa ant ho gaya
 The history of racial discrimination in the context of South Africa is very old
 isaki shuruyaat dach upniveshvaadiyon dwaara cap toun ko apane rifreshment stesan ke rup main sthapit karne se maani jaati he
 Dutch colonists used to go through this route to establish colonies in Asia

 In order to distinguish superiority and inferiority between rulers and the ruled, it was necessary to urge the Europeans to keep their hands away from the Europeans
 paristhiti kaa virodhabhas yah tha ki gore european maalikon ke jivan main kaalon kii antarang upasthiti bhi thi
 This intimacy resulted in the creation of a mixed race called 'blacks'

 Seventy percent of the land was also safe for the occupation of the whites

 It became clear to the British and Dutch colonists how important it was to capture South Africa's mines

 This was the main reference to South African politics of the late nineteenth century

 The Blacks and their political leadership hoped that the Boer War would result in political concessions for them
 par aisa nahin hua
 The British and the Dutch later entered into a treaty and together maintained the apartheid regime
 1911 tak british upniveshwaad dakshin africa main puri tarah parajeet ho gaya, lekin kaalon ko koi insaaf nahin mila
 In response to the formation of the South African Union in 1912, the African National Congress was established, which aimed at the struggle for the liberation of blacks based on the principles of liberalism, multiculturalism and non-violence

 Varvord had lost his election, but to take advantage of his intellectual abilities, Malan placed several government responsibilities on his shoulders
 varword ne hi vah kanoonee dhaanchaa taiyaar kiya jiske aadhaar par rangabhedi rajya kaa shiraja khadaa hua
 The most notorious of these laws were restrictions on the movement of African people
 1948 main rangabhed ke saath patibaddh naishanal party ke sattarudh hone ke saath hi eensi ne indian congress, colord pipuls congress or white congress of damocrates ke saath gathjod kar liya
 This group of whites was influenced by the South African Communist Party, which was banned by the government
 1955 main eensi ne freedom charter paarit kiya jisamen sarvasamaveshi rashtrawaad ke prati patibaddhta jari kii gayi
 Another provision drafted by Varvord was the Banatu Education Act of 1953, under which the education of the African people went completely into the hands of Varvord
 isi ke baad se africa shiksha pranali rangabhedi shashan ke kilaaf pratirodh kaa centre banati chali gayi
 In the sixties, the apartheid government restricted its opposing political powers, their leaders were either arrested or relegated

 The staunch nationalist Boer Afrikaner community of Dutch origin had also lost their former unity due to class divisions
