 In terms of physics, when the moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, the image of the Sun behind the Moon gets covered for some time, the same phenomenon is called Solar Eclipse
 prithvi suraj kii parikrama karti he or chaand prithvi kii
 Sometimes the moon comes between the sun and the earth
 phir vah suraj kii kuch yaa sari roshni roak letaa he jisase dharti par saaya fail jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called solar eclipse
 yah ghatana sadaa sarvada amavasya ko hi hoti he
 Often the moon covers only a part of the sun
 yah sthiti khand-grahan kehalaati he
 Sometimes it happens that the moon completely covers the sun
 ise purna-grahan kehete hai
 Complete eclipse can be seen only in a very small area of the earth
 zyaada se zyaada do sau pachaas kilometre ke sampark main
 Outside this region only the eclipse is visible
 purna-grahan ke samay chaand ko suraj ke saamne se guzarane main do ghante lagate hai
 The moon covers the sun completely, at most, for seven minutes
 in kuch kshanon ke liye aasmaan main andhera ho jaataa he, yaa yun kahen ki din main raat ho jaati he
 Eclipse is a wonderful miracle of nature
 jyotish ke drushtikon se yadi dekha jaae to abhootpurv anokhaa, vicitra jyotish gyaan, grah or upgrahon kii gatividhiyaan evam unka swaroop spasht karata he
 Solar eclipse occurs when the sun is partially or completely covered by the moon
 is prakaar ke grahan ke liye chandama kaa prithvi or surya ke bich aana aavashyak he
 Due to this, people living on the earth do not see the covered part of the sun
 uttari dhruv ko dakshini dhruv se milaane vaali rekhaon ko rekhaansh kaha jaataa he tathaa bumadhya rekha ke chaaro vrutakar main jane vaali rekhaon ko ankshash ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The solar eclipse always occurs on the new moon
 jab chandramaa kshintam ho or surya purna kshamta sampann tathaa deept hon
 The longitude of Moon and Rahu or Ketu must be very close
 chandra kaa akshansh lagbhag shunya hona chaiye or yah tab hoga jab chandra ravimaarg par yaa ravimaarg ke nikat hon, surya grahan ke din surya or chandra ke koniya vyas ek samaan hote hai
 For this reason, the moon is able to take the sun in its shadow only for a few minutes
 surya grahan ke samay jo kshetra dhak jaataa he use purna chaaya kshetra kehete hai
 There are three types of solar eclipse, which are called full solar eclipse, partial solar eclipse and annular eclipse because of the covering of the whole or less part of the image of the sun by the moon
 purna surya grahan us samay hota he jab chandramaa prithvi ke kaafii paas rahete hue prithvi or surya ke bich main aa jaataa he or chandramaa puri tarah se prithvi ko apane chaaya kshetra main le letaa he
 As a result, the sun's light does not reach the earth and a dark condition arises on the earth when the whole sun is not visible on the earth
 is prakaar banane vaala grahan purna surya grahan kehalaata he
 In partial solar eclipse, when the moon comes between the sun and the earth in such a way that only a part of the sun is not visible from the earth, that is, the moon is able to take only some part of the sun in its shadow
 isse surya kaa kuch bhaag grahan grass main tathaa kuch bhaag grahan se aprabhavit rahata he to prithvi ke us bhaag vishesh main laga grahan aanshik surya grahan kehalaata he
 In the annular solar eclipse, when the moon is far away from the earth, it comes between the earth and the sun, that is, the moon covers the sun in such a way that only the central part of the sun comes in the shadow area and when viewed from the earth by the moon The Sun does not appear completely covered, but the area outside the Sun appears to shine as a bracelet or ring
 kangan aakaar main bane suryagrahan ko hi valayakaar surya grahan kehalaata he
 Astronomers have determined from mathematics that 41 solar eclipses and 29 lunar eclipses occur in a period of 18 years and 18 days
 ek varsh main 5 suryagrahan tathaa 2 chandragrahan tak ho sakate hai
 But there should be 2 solar eclipses in a year
 haan, yadi kisi varsh 2 hi grahan hue to wo dono hi suryagrahan honge
 Although up to 7 eclipses are possible throughout the year, more than 4 eclipses are rarely seen
 prayek grahan 18 varsh 11 din biit jane par pun: hota he
 But it is not certain that he should be in his first place, because the point of wealth is constantly moving
 saadharantay suryagrahan kii apeksha chandragrahan adhik dekhe jate hai, parantu sachai yah he ki chandra grahan se kahin adhik suryagrahan hote hai
 The ratio of 4 solar eclipses is 3 lunar eclipses
 chandragrahanon ke adhik dekhe jane kaa kaaran yah hota he ki ve prithvi ke aadhe se adhik bhaag main dikhalaai passage hai, jab ki suryagrahan prithvi ke bahut bade bhaag main praaia sau mile se kam chode or do se teen hajaar mile lambe bhubhag main dikhalaai passage hai
 For example, if there is an eclipse in Madhya Pradesh, then the solar eclipse will be visible only in Gujarat and in North India it will not be visible
 chaahe grahan kaa koi aadhyatmik mahatva ho athwa na ho kintu duniya bhar ke vaigyanikon ke liye yah avasar kisi utsav se kam nahin hota
 Because eclipse is the time when many unique and wonderful events happen in the brahmand, so that scientists get an opportunity to work on new new facts

 This rendering of Einstein was also proved right on the occasion of solar eclipse, in which he talked about the light falling from the gravity of other bodies
 chandragrahan to apane sampurna tatkaaleen prakaash kshetra main dekha ja saktaa he kintu suryagrahan adhiktam 10 hajaar kilometre lambe or 250 kilometre chode kshetra main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 The actual duration of total solar eclipse can be only 11 minutes and not more than that

 Therefore, the creation period of Saraswati Kantha Bharan can be considered to be mid-eleventh century AD
 iske praneta kavyprakash ke rachayita mammat se kinchit purvavarti hai
 Although the sound of doctrine was established by Anandavardhana, the recognition of sound as Kavyatma was disputed till that time; Therefore, neither Bhojdev nor Bhatt Mammat adopted the determination to give voice as a soul in the definition of poetry in a literal sense
 donon aacharyon ne kavy main doshabhaav tathaa gunvattta ko pradhanta di he
 It is the specialty of Bhojdev that he has accepted the utility of ornaments and has considered it necessary for poetry to be restored
 yon bhojdev ke saraswatikanthabharan ne anshat: mammat ko evam vishwanath ko prabhavit kiya he
 Saraswati Kantha Bharan is a long text containing five passages
 pratham pariched main rachayita ne kavyasaamanya kii paribhaasha dene ke pashchaat sarvapratham kavy ke deergh evam gun kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this context, Bhojdev has given verse, sentence and syntactic defects
 har prakaar ke dosha kii sankhya solah he
 According to Bhojdev, qualities, words and sentences are known and each has twenty-four distinctions
 pratham pariched ke ant main katipay dosha kahin kahin gun ban jate hai
 By illustrating this poetry, he has accepted the routine of poetry
 dwitiya pariched main shabdalankar kaa nirnay karte hue unhone sarvapratham auchiti par bal diya tathaa jati, reeti, vritti, chaaya, mudra, ukti, yukti, bhaniti, gunfna, shayya evam pathiti kaa sodaaharan vivechan kiya he
 Except for the custom of these twelve elements, detailed explanation of the remaining elements is not found in any other available literature in Sanskrit
 banbhatta ne kavyasaushthav ke vishesh tatv, shayya kaa ullekh kiya he parantu uski paribhaasha keval saraswatikanthabharan main hi uplabdh hoti he
 Thereafter, an example is given of the vulgar distinctions of puns, puns, alliteration, pictures, pralica, esoteric and q & As
 is ansh main bhi saraswatikanthabharan kii sarvatha nijee visheshta he
 Subsequently, Bhojdev, discussing the causes of poetry, presents three distinctions of poetry in the form of audio, visual and pictorial
 drishykavy ke antargat unhone dasharupakon kaa ullekh nahin kiya he varan nritt evam nrity par hi unka vibhaajan simit he
 In the third passage, there is a discussion of the difference between the form and the type of economists, which take different forms than other literatures
 chauthe pariched main ubhayalankaron kaa vivechan he jisamen upama aadi alankaaron ke bhedopabhedon ko savistaar samajhaayaa he
 The last passage is rasvivechan
 isamen naikadi kaa tathaa vibhaavon, bhaavon evam anubhaavon kaa vistaarpurvak swaroop nirnay kiya gaya he; saath hi saath kavypaak, vividh ratiraag ke swaroop kaa bhi nirdesh he
 At the end there is a epilogue with a discussion of vrittis like Bharati, Kaishiki etc
 saraswatikanthabharan main rassidhant kii vivechna praaia: vishay par ek vihangam drushtimaatr he
 Poetic poetry is a serious matter, with a view to doing justice to it with dignity, Bhoja completes the chapter of Rasavivechan by composing an independent book called Shringarprakash
 saraswatikanthabharan kii visheshta yah he ki yah itar sahityashastreey granthon kii apeksha vyapak evam vyutpaadak granth he
 Its creator Bhojdev is not going to be afraid of Granthavistar, he always makes a generous effort to explain many subtle differences and strains by giving examples
 yadhyapi unke dwaara upasthaapit bhedopabhedon kii manyata parvarti granthkaaron ne sweekrut nahin kii he tathaapi unke tathvik vivechan se sahasaa asahmat hone kii dridhtaa bhi kutraapi drushtigochar nahin hoti

 If your red cells are below normal levels, you may need blood transfusions

 Contemporary critics and academics, including Vladimir Nabokov, believe that Kafka is one of the best writers of the 20th century
 "kafkaesque" angreji bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaya he jiskaa upyog 'bahakaanewaala','khatarnaak jatilta' aadi ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he
 In an article for the New Yorker, John Updike explained: "when Kafka was born, ideas of modernism began to flourish in that century - as in the midst of centuries a new self-consciousness, new-born consciousness was born
 
 apni mrityu ke itane saal baad bhi, kafka aadhunik vichaardhaara ke ek pahalu ke pratik he - chintaa or shame kii us anubhuti ke jise sthit nahin kiya ja saktaa he isliye shant nahin kiya ja saktaa he; chizon ke bheetar ek anant kathinaayee kii bhaavana ke, jo har kadam baadha dalti he; upyogita se pare teevr samvedansheeltaa ke, jaise ki saamaajik upyog or dharmik vishwaas kii apni puraani twachaa ke chhin jane par us sharir ke samaan jise har sparsh se pidaa ho
 This terrible quality of Kafka's strange and highly original case was full of his softness, quirky and good humor, some serious and assured formality
 yah sangyojan unhe ek kalakaar banaata he, par unhone apni kala kii keemat ke rup main adhik se adhik bheetar pratirodh or adhik gambhir sanshay ke khilaaf sangharsh kiya he
 Some of Kafka's most popular works are - Inquisition, a hunger-artist, etc
 kafka kaa janm praha, bohemia main, ek madhyam varg ke, german bhashi yahudee parivaar main hua
 Kafka's father, Harmann Kafka, ran a dry goods shop in the ghetto, and Kafka's mother, Julie, supported him
 unke pita ko vishaal, swaarthee, dabang vyapaaree kaha jaataa tha
 Kafka himself stated that his father was "a true Kafka in strength, health, hunger, height of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind and knowledge of human nature"

 hindu dharm main ekadshi kaa vrath mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 Every year there are 24 Ekadashis
 jab adhikmas yaa malmaas aata he tab inaki sankhya badhkar 26 ho jaati he
 The Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month is called Nirjala Ekadashi, drinking of water is forbidden in this fast, hence this is called Nirjala Ekadashi
 jab sarvajna vedavyas ne pandavon ko chaaron purusharth- dharm, arth, kaam or moksh dene vaale ekadshi vrath kaa sankalp karaayaa to mahabali bhim ne nivedan kiya- pitamah! aapane to prati paksh ek din ke upwas kii baat kahi he
 i cannot live without food for even a single day - i have to eat many times as many people as i can to keep the calm called 'vrak' in my stomach
 to kya apni us bhukh ke kaaran main ekadshi jaise punyavrat se vanchit rah jaaounga? Pitamah, while diagnosing Bhima's problem and boosting his morale, said- No Kuntinandan, this is the specialty of religion that it does not hold everyone, but it also provides a convenient and flexible system of fasting rules
 atah aap jyeshtha maas kii shukla paksh kii nirjala naam kii ek hi ekadshi kaa vrath karo or tumhen varsh kii samast ekadashiyon kaa fal praapt hoga
 Of course, you will get salvation, gain happiness, fame and attainment in this world
 itane aashwaasan par to vrikodar bhimsen bhi is ekadshi kaa vidhivat vrath karne ko sahamat ho gaye
 Therefore, this superior Nirjala Ekadashi, which gives the virtuous benefit of the year-long Ekadashi, is also called Pandava Ekadashi or Bhimseni Ekadashi in the world
 is din jo swayan nirjal rahakar brahman yaa jaruratmand vyakti ko shuddh pani se bharaa gadaa is mantra ke saath daan karata he
 Once Maharishi Vyas visited Pandavas here
 bhim ne maharishi vyas se kaha, bhagwaan! yudhishthar, arjuna, nakul, sahadev, mata kunti or draupadi sabhi ekadshi kaa vrath karte he or mujhase bhi vrath rakhane ko kehete he parantu main bina khaae rah nahi saktaa he isliye choubees ekadashio par nirahaar rahane kaa ksht sadhana se bachaakar mujhe koi aisa vrath bataaiye jise karne main mujhe vishesh asuvidha na ho or sabakaa fal bhi mujhe mil jaye
 Maharishi Vyas knew that there is a fire called Briq in the stomach of Bhima, so his hunger does not calm down on eating a large amount
 is vrath me snaan aachman me pani pine se dosha nahi hota he is vrath se anya taees ekadashio ke punya kaa laabh bhi milegaa tum jivan paryant is vrath kaa paalan karo bhim ne bade saahas ke saath nirjala ekadshi vrath kiya, jiske parinaam swaroop praatah hote hote vah sagyaheen ho gaya tab pandavo ne gagaajal, tulsi charnamrita prasad, dekar unki murcha dur kii
 Hence it is also called Bhimsen Ekadashi
 yah vrath par nar nari dono ko karnaa chahie
 On this day, worshiping Lord Vishnu in Sheshashi form while performing waterless fast has special significance
 is din namo bhagavate vasudevy kaa jap karke godaan, vastra daan, chhatra, fal aadi kaa daan karnaa chaahie

 Thousands of years ago, the extinct Vedic river Saraswati flowed here in the land of the womb, on whose banks the ascetic Aryan sages designed the sources of the Vedas

 Prior to that, this state has been famous by many provincial names

 The establishment of the Veer Bhumi Shekhawati region is a result of the unique talent of Maharao Shekha ji and his descendants to get the strength, Vikram, Shorey and state rights

 It is named after the battle of the city of Ilion

 The Iliad describes the Greek Longo's war with the kingdom of Troy
 is mahakavy main try ke vijay or dhwans kii kahani tathaa unani vir eklis ke virtv kii gaathaayen hai
 In a nutshell, the story of this epic is as follows: Paris, the son of Priam King of Ilion, abducted the supreme beauty Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, in the absence of her husband
 hellen ko pun: praapt karne tathaa ilian ko dand dene ke liye menelouse or uske bhai aagaamemnan ne samast greek raajaaon or saamanton kii sena ekatra karke ilian ke viruddh abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 But this poem does not have a direct description of the above mentioned reasons and its end result, ie the destruction of the Ilion
 iskaa aarambh to greek shivi main kavy ke nayak ekiles ke rosh se hota he
 Agamemnon has rapefully kept the daughter of the priest of Suryadev Apollo
 parinamat: greek shivi main mahamari faili hui he
 The prophet Kalkus stated that the epidemic would not stop until the daughter of the priest was returned
 agamemnan badi kathinaayee se iske liye prastut hota he par iske saath hi vah badale main ekilies ke paas se ek duusari beti briseis ko chin letaa he
 Angry and angry at this insult, vows not to fight in the war
 vah apni mirmidan sena or apane mitra patroklas ke saath apane deron main chalaa jaataa he or kisi bhi manuhaar ko nahin sunata
 As a result, Agamemnon's side in the war begins to grumble
 greek sena bhagkar apane shivi main sharan leti he
 Constrained by the circumstances, Agamemnon sends his messengers to the Achilles and agrees to do much to alleviate his fury
 parantu ekilies kaa rosh dur nahin hota or vah duusare din apane ghar laut jane kii ghoshnaa karata he
 But in fact he stays to see the plight of Agamemnon's army
 kintu uskaa mitra patroklas apane paksh kii is durdasha ko dekhakar ko dekhakar khiz uthta he or vah ekilies se yuddh main ladane kii ajna praapt kar letaa he
 The Achilles also give him his armor and send his Miramidan soldiers to battle with him as well
 patroklas ilian kii sena ko khaded detaa he par swayan ant main vah ilian ke maharathi hektar dwaara maar daalaa jaataa he
 Hearing the news of the death of Patroclus, Echilles is mad with grief and anger and after entering into a new armor with Agamemnon, enters the battlefield to avenge his friend from Hektor

 Now, to write computer programs, the machine language has been used in place of numerical implementation signals, as a memento reminder
 computer main prayog kii jane vaali vah bhashaa jisame angreji aksharo, sankhyao evam chinho kaa prayog karke program likhaa jaataa he, use ucch stareey programing bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 Writing programs in this language is very easy for the programmer, because there is no need to write any instructions in machine code
 jaise -BASIC, cobol,fortran,pascal|ab to ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa atyant vikaas ho chukaa he
 These programming languages are divided into four categories according to the work - scientific programming languages - they are mainly used to make programs for scientific work, but some of these languages are also those which other than scientific work are also similar

 jaise-algol,basic,pascal,fortran, aadi he
 Business programming languages-related to business functions such as ledger, daily paper, stock etc
, can be done very easily by programs of business programming languages
 jaise-pl1,cobol, DBASE aadi
 Special purpose programming languages - These languages are used to perform various tasks with special ability

 This is a very important achievement
 program ke prayogkarta ke computer badalane par arthath vibhinn ALU or Control unit main bhi yah program sookshmatam sudhaar ke baad samaan rup se chalata he
 The words used in these languages are in the common English language
 in programing bhashaao main galatiyo kii sambhaavna kam hoti he tathaa galatiyo ko jald dhundhakar sudhara ja saktaa he
 The translator used by the compiler or interpreter program itself informs which line and instructions are in error

 The programs written in these languages take more space in the main memory of the computer than the programs written in machine language and assembly language
 in bhashaao main lacheelaapan nahin hota he anuwadako ke swayan niyantrit hone ke kaaran yah programmer ke niyantran main nahin hota he
 Flexibility implies that certain tasks cannot be done in these programming languages or can be done with extreme difficulty
 phir bhi ucch stareey programing bhashaa kii visheshtaayen uski parisimaao kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hoti he
 Therefore, currently these languages are used

 He developed high-level languages around 1952
 jisame ek compiler kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Two high-level programming languages were developed under the direction of Dr
 Hopper, the first being FLOWMATIC and MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC ek vyavsaayik programing bhashaa thi or MATHEMATICS ek ankaganitiya gananaao main prayukt kii jane vaali bhashaa
 Since then, around 225 high-level programming languages have been developed
 udhaaharan:fortran, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL

 In the historical background of modern psychology, its two definite forms are visible
 ek to vaigyanik anusandhanon tathaa avishkaron dwaara prabhavit vaigyanik manovigyaan tathaa doosraa darshanashastra dwaara prabhavit darshan manovigyaan
 Scientific psychology began in the late 19th century
 san 1860 i main feknar ne german bhashaa main "eliments aav psycofizix" naamak pustak prakashit kii, jisamen ki unhone manovaigyanik samasyaon ko vaigyanik paddati ke parivesh main adhyayan karne kii teen vishesh pranaaliyon kaa vidhiwat varnan kiya : madhya truti vidhi, nunatam parivartan vidhi tathaa sthir uttejk bhed vidhi
 Even today, many important research is done in psychological laboratories on the basis of these systems
 vaigyanik manovigyaan main feknar ke baad do anya mahatvapurn naam he : helmolts tathaa wilhem vunt helmolts ne anek prayogon dwaara drushtirdriya vishyak mahatvapurn niyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya
 In this context, he raised the scientific existence of psychology through research work on the articulation
 vunt kaa naam manovigyaan main vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He established the first laboratory of psychology in Leipzig in 1879 AD
 manovigyaan kaa aupchaarik rup paribhaashit kiya
 Psychology is the science of experience, its purpose is to analyze the elements of the process of consciousness, to find out the nature of their interactions and the rules that determine them

 Mueller was indeed a student of philosophy and history, but as a result of his correspondence with Fekner, his attention turned to psychological problems
 unhone smriti tathaa drushtindriya ke kshetra main manodaihiki vidhiyon dwaara anusandhan kaary kiya
 In this context, he also discovered the "jast rule", that if there are two associates of the same power, then by repeating, the old association will become stronger than the new one
 manovigyaan par vaigyanik pravriti ke saath saath darshanashastra kaa bhi bahut adhik prabhaav padaa he

 Hartley can be named among the somatic psychological philosophers
 unke anusaar snaayu-tantuon main hue kampan ke aadhaar par samvednaa hoti he
 In the background of this idea were the facts propounded by Newton stating that the sensation continues even after the stimulant is removed
 hartle ne saahchary vishyak niyam bataate hue saannnidhya ke siddhant par adhik jor diya
 After Hartley, there was no notable work in the field of associativeism for nearly 70 years
 is bich scotland main read ne vastuon ke pratyakshikaran kaa varnan karte hue bataaya ki pratyakshikaran tathaa samvednaa main bhed karnaa aavashyak he
 The properties of a particular object are sensed while that of the whole object is perceptible
 samvednaa keval kisi vastu ke gunon tak hi simit rahati he, kintu pratyakshikaran dwaara hamen us puri vastu kaa gyaan hota he
 Meanwhile, in France, Condillac laid the foundations of empiricism and La Matrie the trends of materialism
 kandilank kaa kahana tha ki samvedan hi sampurna gyaan kaa "mul strot" he
 He did not consider the ideas or experiences stated by Locke to be absolutely necessary

 san 1851 i
 tathaa san 1860 i
 main feknar ne bhi manovaigyanik drushti se do mahatvapurn granth prakashit kiye
 In 1858, Wunt received a doctorate in medical science at the University of Hydelverg and was working in the field of action in a cooperative position
 usee varsh vahaan bon se helmolts bhi aa gaye
 This contact was very important for Wunt because after this he left psychology and made psychology his field
 vunt ne anginat vaigyanik lekh tathaa anek mahatvapurn pustak prakashit karke manovigyaan ko ek dhundle evam aspasht darshanik vaataavaran se baahar nikaala
 He only put psychological problems in the scientific environment and inaugurated the tendency to think and experiment with them from a new perspective
 uske baad se manovigyaan ko ek vigyaan mana jane laga
 Subsequently new problems arose as the patient experimented on scientific procedures
 vyavhaar vishyak niyamon kii khoj hi manovigyaan kaa mukhya dhyey tha
 Various approaches were presented at the theoretical level
 san 1912 i
 ke aasapaas manovigyaan ke kshetra main sanrachnawad, kriyavaad, vyavahaarwad, gestaltwad tathaa manovishleshan aadi mukhya mukhya shakhaon kaa vikaas hua
 The promoters of all these promises were unanimous that the scientific study of human behavior is the aim of psychology
 unamem paraspar matbhed kaa vishay tha ki is uddeshy ko praapt karne kaa sabase acha dhang koun sa he
 The followers of Structureism were of the opinion that to explain behavior, it is necessary to understand the anatomical structures through which behavior is possible
 kriyavaad ke maananevaalon kaa kahana tha ki shaareerik sanrachana ke sthaan par prekshan yogya tathaa drishyman vyavhaar par adhik jor hona chahie
 On this basis, Watson later established pragmatism
 gestaltwaadiyon ne pratyakshikaran ko vyavahaaravishayak samasyaon kaa mul aadhaar mana
 In practice, they were of the opinion that the tendency to get a well organized system was predominant
 frid ne manovishleshanvaad kii sthapana dwaara yah bataane kaa prayaas kiya ki hamaare vyavhaar ke adhikansh kaaran achetan prakriyaaon dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai
 All of these "promises" in modern psychology now remain of historical importance
 inke sthaan par manovigyaan main adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye vibhinn shakhaon kaa vibhaajan ho gaya he
 In experimental psychology, mainly the same problems were studied by psychological method which philosophers first solved by thinking or deliberation

 Around 1912, Thorndike developed comparative or animal psychology by experimenting on animals
 kintu pashuon par praapt kiye gaye parinaam kahan tak manushyon ke vishay main lagu ho sakate hai, yah jaanane ke liye vikasaatmak kram kaa gyaan bhi aavashyak tha
 Apart from this, the rules of behavior can be rendered in the same condition when there is complete and proper knowledge of the development of humans or animals

 Soon after 1912, social psychology was established as a result of macdougall's efforts, although its foundation was laid long ago by social scientist Herbert Spencer
 dhire-dhire gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon par manovigyaan kaa prabhaav anubhav kiya jane laga
 It was hoped that psychology could be useful in solving problems in other disciplines

 To fulfill this objective, our research should be in accordance with international standards
 The major weakness of Indian education and research is the relatively low share of private sector in research

 There are about one hundred and fifty more mach games made in Malvi by various mach gurus, which Dr
 Madhur has conveniently divided into four parts - religious and mythological stories, valor stories, previews and social stories
 in sabhi prakaar ke khelon main jivan kii vibhinn pahaluon kii abhivyakti ke saath hi kahin maanav man kii sukomal bhaawanaaon ke ragaatmak sandarbhon ko vyakt kiya gaya he,to kahin saahsee or vir charitron ko, kahin aadhyatmikta kii abhivyanjana he,to kahin samayik samasyaon se takaraane kii koshish
 Along with the expression of diverse life references, the accomplishment of the highest values has been the central tendency of macho, which is tangible through mythological or historical, folk and famous characters

 For more than two hundred years, Mach has remained the main folk dance of Malwa
 iske udbhav or vikaas main malwa kii anek lokanuranjak kala pravritiyon kaa yogadan rahaa he
 Dr
 Shivkumar Madhur is the prominent name among the people who consider Garbi songs prevalent in the Malwa region, the play of dhara-dhari, turra kalangi, imitation-farce, Gammat, Hazrat Vidya etc
 as important in the origin and development of Mach
 malwa ke in lok kala roopon main anternihit tattvon jaise-nrity, gaan evam abhinay, aadhyatmikta, nakal-swang pravriti, nirguni bhakthi ke tatva, purushon dwaara stri paatro kii bhoomika sahit anek rang vyavhaar aadi maach main aaj bhi maujuud hai
 According to Dr
 Madhur - acting from the games of dhara-dhari, music from garba-utsav, poetic-singing from Turrakkalangi and acting from farce-miming performances, the makers of this new color style by creating elements of humor, humor, chirpy satire and popular entertainment Thrived on rajasthan main prachlit lokanaty khyaal kaa prabhaav bhi maach ke khelon main dikhaai detaa he
 That is why the famous historian Dr
 Raghuvir Singh has called the ideas the father of machos
 maach kii style ke armbhkarta guru gopalji ko mana jaataa he, jo multah rajasthan ke rahane vaale the or baad main malwa main bas gaye the
 It is believed that Guru Gopal ji started the mach in Malwa region with the inclusion of local music and folk forms in the form of theatrical form of Rajasthan, which became progressively refined, preserved and cultured from the tradition
 bharat kii samrudh natya parampara kii jeevantta or nirantarata ko aadhaar dene main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn yogadan lok-naatyon kaa hi rahaa he
 Amongst the various mediums available for the expression of the folklore, folk-dramas appear to be interwoven in an inter-sutra despite the linguistic differences of their rapid taste and easy communicability
 lokmanas kii swaabhaavik abhivyakti in saare lok-natya roopon ko ekasutra main jodatii dikhaai detii he
 This instinctively arises from his complex intellectual-less emotionalism, which is clearly visible at all levels such as plot, dialogue, song-music, dance, performance-style, color-craft, language, etc
 is drushti se malwa kshetra kaa lok-natya rup maach bharat ke anya lok naatyon roopon se alag nahin he
 It also has the same musicality, folkloric acting and performance elements, religiosity as well as a plurality of social, political, folkloric and romantic narratives and exaggerated gestures and delicacy of social, political, folkloric and romantic narratives, which are other folklore of India
 Forms such as Nautanki, Khyal, Bhavai, Tamasha, Kariyala etc
 are found
 vastutah in sabhi kii soundarya drushti sanskrit naatakon kii bhaanti rasmoolak hi he
 In the same way, in these Loknatya forms, there is a tendency to identify individual and group relationships in place of personal struggle and to take the audience in a state of equilibrium by going through many situations of life, in which there is an achievement of Lokmangal
 Establishment of a locality in spite of a cruel end
 maach ke pravartak guru gopalji se lekar aaj tak srijanarat machakaaron kii ek lambi fehrist he jinhone maach ke lagbhag dedh sau khelon kaa pranayan kiya he
 In the early decades of the twentieth century, Mach was the representative theater of Malwa, with hundreds of spectators crowded throughout the night
 yadhyapi pichhali shatabdi ke dhalate-dhalate maach kii lokapriyata evam pradarshnon main kuch kami ai he phir bhi iske sangrakshan vistaar or nawachaari prayogon dwaara maach guruon ne ise aaj jeevant banaae rakhaa he
