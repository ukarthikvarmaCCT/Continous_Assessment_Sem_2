" "translation is a craft in which an attempt is made to present the same message in another language instead of a message written in one language
 " The following written definition is cited under this: "ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashabhed main pratipaadya ko sthaanantarit karne kii prakriya yaa uske parinaam ko anuwaad kehete hai
 " iske antargat nimnlikhit paribhaasha aati he : "translation is a relation between two or more texts; these texts perform the same function in the same situation
" " While this classification of translation definitions explains the multilaterality of the nature of translation, it also indicates that, definitions of translation can also vary according to different purposes
 is prakaar ye sabhi paribhaashaayen maanya hai
 Based on these definitions, two sides of translation are considered
 anuwaad ke do paksh hai - pehla sankriyaatmak paksh at ev gatisheel or doosraa saiddhanthik paksh at ev sthitisheel
 In operational terms, translation is a process
 anuwaad ke paksh kaa sambandh anuwaad karne ke kaary se he jiske liye 'anuwaad kaary' shabd kaa prayog karnaa uchit mana jaataa he
 In theory, translation is a relationship between two or more languages, but between texts in different languages; But they should be synonyms
 is sambandh kaa udghaatan tulanaatmak paddati ke adhyayan se kiya jaataa he
 The coordinated form of these two is found in the assumption that translation is an abstraction - the result of work is translation - which is related to the relation of synonymy to its original text
 nishpatti ke rup main anuwaad ko 'anudit paath' kaha jaataa he
 In this view, there can be many translations of an original text
 is prakaar sankriyaatmak drushti se anuwaad ko jahaan bhashaa prayog kii ek vidha ke rup main janaa jaataa he, vahaan saiddhanthik drushti se iskaa sambandh bhashaa paath tulana tathaa vyatireki vishleshan kii takneekon par aadhaarit bhashaa sambandhon ke prashn se joda jaataa he
 Translation has been called the branch of applied linguistics
 vastutah, apane is rup main yah apane prakriya rup tathaa sambandh rup paribhaashaon kii yojak kadi he, jiskaa sankriyaatmak aadhaar anudit paath he, jiske mul main 'anuwaad ek nishpatti he' kii dharna nihit he
 The other information about the translation from these definitions is as follows: anuwaad ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaa bhed main hota he
 It is of the nature of process, change, transfer, replacement, or repetition
 sthaanantarit hone vaali vastu ko vibhinn naamon se ingit kar sakate hai, jaise paathyasaamagree, sarthak anubhav, soochna, sandesh
 These different names are related to the difference between the various ions of the theoretical background of translation and the objectives of the translation work
 jaise, bhashaagat 'paathyasaamagree' naam se vyakt hone vaali sunishchitata anuwaad ke bhashavaigyanik aadhaar kii visheshta he, jiskaa vishesh upyog mashin anuwaad main hota he
 'information' and 'meaningful experience' indicate the sociocultural basis of translation; And 'sandesh' provides the textual background of the translation
 uparyukt kii visheshta yah hoti he ki iskaa donon bhashaaon main samaan arth hota he
 This similarity of meaning is broad-based and extends from linguistic meaning to contextual meaning
 sankshep main, ek bhashaa ke vishisht bhashabhed ke vishisht paath ko duusari bhashaa main is prakaar prastut karnaa anuwaad he, jisamen vah mul ke bhashik arth, prayog ke vaishishty se nishpann arth, prayukti or style kii visheshta, vishaywastu, tathaa sambaddh saanskrithik vaishashtyi ko yathasambhav sangrakshit rakhte hue duusari bhashaa ke pathak ko swaabhaavik rup se grahya prathit ho
 The twentieth century has been called the era of translation
 yadhyapi anuwaad sabase pracheen vyavsaay yaa vyavsaayon main se ek kehalaata he tathaapi uske jo mahatva beesvin sadi main praapt hua vah usase pehle use nahin mila aisa mana jaataa he
 The main reason for this is that it is only in the twentieth century that linguistic contact, that is, the status of contact started in different linguistic communities
 iske mul kaaran aarthik or raajnneetik maane jate hai
 As a result, the economic-political map of the world began to change
 vartmaan yag main adhiktar rashtron main yadi ek bhashaa pradhan he to ek yaa adhik bhashaayen gaun pad par dikhaai detii hai
 In other words, there are linguistic majorities and linguistic minorities within the same political-administrative unit boundary
 loktantr main sab logon kaa prashasan main samaan rup se bhaag lene kaa adhikaar tabhi sarthak mana jaataa he, jab unke saath unki bhashaa ke madhyam se sampark kiya jaae
 This creates a state of multilingualism and it becomes mandatory to take shelter of translation work in the process of its preservation
 iske atirikt anterrashtriya str par vibhinn rashtron ke bich raajnneetik, aarthik, vaigyanik or praudyogic, tathaa saahitiyik or saanskrithik str par badhate hue aadan-pradaan ke kaaran anuwaad kaary kii anivaaryta or mahatta kii nai chetana prabal rup se viksit hoti hui dikhti he
 Therefore, translation is considered to be a comprehensive and often mandatory and rational position
 anuwaad ke mahatva ko do bhinn, parantu sambandhit sandarbho main adhik spashtataa se samajhayaa jaataa he : saamaajik evam vyaavhaarik mahatva, shaikshanik evam gyanatmak mahatva
 In a social context, translation trade takes place in informal situations
 iskaa sambandh dwibhashikta kii sthiti se he
 Bilingualism generally means alternately using two languages at a time
 vartmaan yug ke samaaj kaa ek brihad bhaag aisa he, jo saamaajik sandarbh kii anaupchaarik sthiti main do bhashaaon kaa vaikalpik prayog karata he
 Normally every educated person, semi-educated person of the urban environment, people living in the border region of two different linguistic states, and linguistic minorities, more clearly see the status of bilingualism
 yah dwibhashikta praayah ashrith / sanyukt dwibhashikta kii koti kii hoti he
 The common feature of this is that, everyone thinks in one language, but expresses it in another language
 is sthiti main anuwaad prakriya kaa hona anivaary he
 But this process takes place informally
 vyakti man hi man pehali bhashaa se anya bhashaa main anuwaad kar apni baat kah dete hai
 It has been assumed that translation directly exists when learning another language in another language environment
 yadi swa-bhashaa ke hi parivesh main anya bhashaa sikhi jaae to "code" parivartan kii sthiti aati he, jisamen anuwaad kii sthiti kuch paroksh ho jaati he
 Hence all translations in bilingual form are informal
 is drushti se anuwaad ek saamaajik bhashaa vyavhaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika main dikhataa he
 The translation business takes place in a formal position in academic and cognitive context
 iske do bhed hai : saadhan rup main anuwaad or saadhy rup main anuwaad
 Translation in the form of instrument is used as a method of language teaching
 sangyanatmak kaushal ke rup main anuwaad ke abhyaas se bhashaa adhigam ke do kaushalon-bodhan or abhivyakti ko pusht kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, there are two more areas of translation in means: comparative study of languages and comparative literature discussion
 vastutah bhashaaon ke adhyayan-vishleshan ke liye anuwaad ke dwaara hi vyakti ko yah gyaat hota he ki, ek vaakya main kis shabd kaa kya arth he
 Only after that does he become aware of the point of equality and inequality in both
 atah vyatireki bhashaa vishleshan ko anuvaadatmak vishleshan bhi kaha gaya he
 Comparative literature interpretation refers to the use of translation as a means of comparative study of literatures, so that fractions can be compared
 iske atirikt anya bhashaa sahitya kii kritiyon ke anuwaad kaa abhyaas karnaa athwa / or unhen anudit rup main padhanaa tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main anuwaad ke yogadan kaa udhaaharan he
 The translation business, as practicable, appears in many fields
 koshkarya bhi uk prakaar kaa anuwaad kaary he
 a bilingual dictionary contains translation within a single language and a bilingual dictionary between two languages
 yah anuwaad, paath kii apeksha bhashaa ke aayam par hota he, jisamen bhashaa vishleshan ke do str prabhavit hote hai
 They are two levels - word and word series
 isi prakaar kisi bhashaa ke vikaas ke liye bhi anuwaad-vyapaar kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 When a language has an opportunity to work in areas that were not previously used, it needs to be developed from both a content and a method of expression
 iske liye anya bhashaaon se vibhinn prakaar ke sahitya kaa usamen anuwaad kiya jaataa he
 Consequently, with the expansion of the perimeter of the content, the area of the lexicon of the language also expands
 anek naye shabd ban jate hai, kai baar prachlit shabdon ko nayaa arth mil jaataa he, naye sahprayog viksit hone lagate hai, sankar-shabdaawalee prayog main aane lagati he, or bhashaa prayog ke sandarbh kii visheshta ke kaaran kul milakar bhashaa kaa ek naveen bhed viksit ho jaataa he
 Modern administrative Hindi and journalistic Hindi are good examples of this
 is prakriya ko bhashaa niyojan or bhashaa vikaas kehete hai, jo apane vyapaktar sandarbh main raashtra ke saamaajik-aarthik vikaas kaa ang he
 Thus through translation, necessary and important literature enters the developing language
 tab kah sakate hai ki is rup main anuwaad rashtriya vikaas main bhi yogadan karata he
 Translation in its widest form enhances the power of language, helps in the interpretation and interpretation of texts, clarifies the relationship between language and thought, propagates knowledge, is a conduit of culture, and mutual degradation between nations
 And contributes to the growth of harmony
 gete ke shabdon main, anuwaad asambhav hote hue bhi aavashyak tathaa mahatvapurn he
 There are two notable aspects of the nature of translation - coordination and balance
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa bahuvidyaparak aayam iskaa samanvayshil paksh he
 Accordingly, although the basic origin of translation theory is applied comparative textology, yet some other scriptures touch upon it
 'tulanaatmak' se anuwaad kaa do bhashaaon se sambandhit hona spasht hi he, jisamen bhashaaon kii samanta-asamanta ke prashn upasthit hote hai
 The three aspects of textual science - semantics, syntax and contextualism - are relevant to translation theory
 arthvichaar main bhashik sanket tathaa bhashaabahya yatharth ke bich main sambandh kaa adhyayan hota he
 The status of linguistics under contextualism refers to the various dimensions of the context - the social identity of the speaker and the listener, the purpose of linguistics and the speaker towards the message - the attitude of the listener, the physical conditions of linguistics and the expression, medium, etc
 spasht he ki sanketavigyaan kii paridhi bhashavigyaan kii apeksha vyapaktar he tathaa anuwaad kaary jaise vyapak sampreshan vyapaar ke adhyayan ke upyukt he
 The scripture that touches the translation principle is the communication principle, according to which the translation work is a communication business, and accordingly all the things that apply to it are in the nature of communication business, such as 100% of the communication is not true, imperfection , Ecstasy, partial artificiality etc
 isi se anuwaad kaary main shabd-prati-shabd tathaa arth-prati-arth samanta ke sthaan par sandesstareey samanta kaa auchity bhi saadhaa ja saktaa he
 From a operational point of view, a text or speech is the starting point of translation work
 ek paath kii apni sanrachana hoti he, bhashik sansakti tathaa sandesgat subaddhata kii sankalpanaaon dwaara uske sugathit athwa shithil hone kii jaanch kar sakate hai
 In addition, considering a text as a unified whole of linguistics, it provides more definite information about the linguistic functional distribution of language-use styles
 isi se sambandhit shaastra he, samajabhashashastra tathaa shailivigyaan, jisamen saamaajik boliyon tathaa prayuktiyon ke adhyayan ke saath sandarbhanukool bhashaprayog kii shailion ke vitaran kii jaankaree anuwaad siddhanth ke liye vaanchhneeya he
 Being connected to the language, logic and linguistics also confirm the translation principle
 tarkshastra ke anusaar anudit paath ke satyamulya kii pariksha anuwaad kii vishuddhta ko shuddh karne kaa aadhaar he
 Meaningful thinking in linguistics helps in understanding problems related to the transfer or repetition of meaning in translation work
 vitgenstin kii manyata 'bhashaa main shabd kaa 'prayog' hi uskaa arth he'
 The translation theory is particularly relevant for the reason that the text itself is the unit of translation work, which is the first requirement for successful semantic translation
 is prakaar vaktaa kii vivaksha main arth kaa mul khojna, bhashik arth tathaa bhashaabahya sthiti anuwaad siddhanth ke aavashyak ang hai
 While the above assumptions have a role in the transfer of meaning, the special utility of the method of subtractive analysis has been accepted in the determination of semantic bilingual equality
 yah baat vishesh rup se dhyaan main lee jaati he ki jahaan vividh shastron kii praasangik manyataon se anuwaad siddhanth kaa swaroop nirmit he, vahaan swayan anuwaad siddhanth un shastron kaa ek vishisht ang he
 Translation is also the 'general' aspect of the theory and also the specific aspect, and it is its equilibrium form - the balance of the general and the specific
 anuwaad kii paribhaasha ke anusaar kaha jaataa he ki anuwaad vyavahaaratah vishisht bhashabhed ke str par tathaa isiilie siddhantatah saamaanya bhashaa ke str par hota he - angreji bhashaa ke ek bhed patrakarita kii angreji se hindi bhashaa ke samamoolya bhed patrakarita kii hindi main
 Accordingly, translation is both a general aspect and a specific aspect of translation theory
 ham jo baat saamaanya ke str par kehete hai, use vyaavhaarik rup main bhashabhed ke vishisht str par udaahrit karte hai
 'determining a suitable and common translation system for as many text types as possible' is considered a pertinent question in the field of translation
 pranali ke nirdhaaran ke sambandh main anuwaad prakriya kii prakruti, anuwaad ke vibhinn prakaar, anuwaad ke sutara tathaa vibhinn koti ke paathon ke anuwaad ke nirdesh nishchit karne ke praaroop kaa nirdhaaran, aadi par vichaar karnaa hota he
 The main purpose of translation, unit of translation, nature of art-skills of translation, limitations of translation work, etc
 are some other subjects, which require consideration
 anuwaad kaary kaa merudand he mulbhasha paath
 Theoretical discussion and determination of its operational structure in relation to its structure, its type, the format of the text according to the linguistic format, etc
, along with semantics and various formats of analytical comprehension of grammatical structure, assessment of their strengths and limitations, etc
 , Are the main points under it
 anuwaad siddhanth ke hi antargat kuch gaun binduon kii charchaa bhi hoti he - roopak, vyaktivaachak sangyaayen, paribhaashik shabd, adyakshar shabd, bhugolic naam, vyapaarik naam, vyavsaayik pratishthanon ke naam, saanskrithik shabd, aadi ke anuwaad ke liye koun-si pranali apanaai jaae; saahitiyik rachanaaon, vaigyanik or praudyogikeey lekhan, prachaar sahitya aadi ke liye anuwaad pranali kaa rup kya ho, ityadi
 There is an important point related to this, various tips of translation - transliteration, word-to-word translation, concordant translation, input translation, interpretation, elaboration, interpretation, cultural synonym, interpreting, etc
 anuwaad kaa kaam antatogatva ek hi vyakti karata he
 In solitary translation, the translator is alone, even in collaborative translation, in the last period, the work of editing is done by the translator alone
 atah anuvadak ke saath anek daayitv jud jate hai or kaary ke safal nishpaadan main usase anek apekshaayen rahati hai
 In terms of language knowledge, subject knowledge, expression skills, personal qualities, etc
, the expectations from the translator have to be considered
 anuwaad shiksha or anuwaad samiksha, do anya mahatvapurn bindu hai
 Translation education can be imparted as a means of language-learning, especially other language learning
 isamen anuwaad shikshan, bhashaa-shikshan ke adheen he tathaa ek madhyavarti alpakaalik abhyaskram main isaki yojana kii jaati he, jisamen shikshan ke sopan tathaa lakshya bindu spasht tathaa nishchit hote hai
 The learner's goal in this is to learn the language, not to translate
 shiksha ke duusare charan main anuwaad kaa abhyaas, anuwaad ko ek shilp yaa kaushal ke rup main seekhney ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisaki pragat avasthaa 'anuwaad kala he' kii shabdaawalee main nirdisht kii jaati he
 In this case, the language which is not the translator's own, also confirms his learning in a casual way
 abhyaas saamagree ke rup main paath prakaaron kii vividhta tathaa kathinaayee kii maatra ke anusaar paathon kaa anustaran karnaa hota he
 If there is an aim to develop the ability to translate a homogeneous / heterogeneous, indigenous or foreign language into or from a scheme of learning, then both steps of translation-learning - both instrumental and practicable - can be seen as unconstrained
 anuwaad samiksha, anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa ang he, jiskaa shithil rup main vyavhaar, anudit kriti kaa ek saamaanya pathak bhi karata he, parantu jisaki ek paryaapt spasht saiddhanthik prishthbhumi he
 Theoretical translation review is a cognitive tradeoff
 isamen ek mulpath ke ek yaa ek se adhik anuwaadon kii samiksha kii jaati he, tathaa mul kii tulana main anuwaad kaa yaa mul ke vibhinn anuwaadon kaa parsparik tulana dwaara moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 It has three steps - an analysis of both the original language text and the target language text, a comparison of the two, and finally an evaluation of translation in terms of target language accuracy, appropriateness and naturalness
 moolankan ke sopan par anuwaad kii safalataa kii jaanch ke liye vibhinn pareekshan takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The mindset of accepting translation as both an art and a science has grown due to the fact that attempts at mutual translation of languages around the world point to many styles and methods of translation
 anuwaad kii ek bhangima to yahi he ki kisi rachana kaa saahitiyik-vidha ke aadhaar par anuwaad upasthit kiya jaae
 If a play is to be translated as a play, then in such translations, the translator's own creative talent is also required
 anuwaad kaa ek aadhaar anuwaad ke gadyatmak athwa padyatmak hone par bhi ashrith he
 It is found that most of the translation of prose is present in prose or verse itself, but sometimes this sequence seems to have changed
 kai gadhy kritiyon ke padyanuwaad milte hai, to kai kavyakritiyon ke gadyanuwaad bhi uplabdh hai
 Translations are also categorized on the basis of subject and on many levels it is also divided into two categories, original-focused and original-free, depending on the nature of the translation
 anuwaad ke jin sarthak or prachlit prabhedon kaa ullekh anuwaad vigyaniyon ne kiya he, unamem shabdanuwaad, bhavanuaad, chhayanuwaad, saranuwaad, vyakhyanuwaad, ashyanuwaad or roopantaran ko sarvaadhik sweekruti mili he
 The translation of every word of the source language into every word in the target language is called transliteration
 'makshika sthane makshika' par aadhaarit shabdanuwaad vastav main anuwaad kii sabase nikrusht koti kaa parichaayak hota he
 The nature of each language is different from other language and in every language there are many meanings of the word
 isiilie mul bhashaa kii har shabdabhivyakti ko yathavat lakshyabhasha main nahin anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa
 Sometimes such ridiculous situations arise
 sanskrit se hindi main kiye gayi anuwaad ko kai baar prakruti kii samyata ke kaaran sahya hote hai, lekin europea parivaar kii bhashaaon se kiye gaye anuwaad main arth or padakram ke dosha saamanytah najar aate hai
 In fact, if the source and the target language are similar in meaning, use, syntax, and style, then only eloquence is correct, otherwise the mechanized eloquence becomes ludicrous, funny and artificial
 aise anuvaadakon main strot-bhashaa ke shabd, padakram or vaakya-vinyas par dhyaan na dekar anuwaad mulbhasha kii vichaar-saamagree yaa bhavadhaara par apane aapako kendrit karata he
 The goal of the translator is to present the contents of the source language in such translations
 bhavanuaad kii prakriya main kabhi-kabhi mul rachana jaisaa moulik vaibhav aa jaataa he, lekin kai baar pathakon ko yah shikaayat hoti he ki anuvadak ne mulbhasha kii bhavadhaara ko samajhe bina, lakshya-bhashaa kii prakruti ke anuroop bhav saamagree prastut kar di he
 When a reader wants to read a work from the point of view of the expression skills of the creator, then paraphrasing is not helpful in its goal achievement
 sanskrit naatakon main lagaataar aise prayog milte hai ki unki stra-paatra tathaa sevak, daasi aadi jis praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai, uski sanskrit chaaya bhi naatak main vidyaman rahati he
 Chhayanuvaad has emerged from similar experiments
 anuwaad kii pravidhi ke antargat anuvadak na shabdanuwaad kii tarah keval mul shabdon kaa anusaran karata he or na sirf bhaavon kaa hi paripaalan karata he, balki mulbhasha se puri tarah bandhaa hua uski chaaya main lakshyabhasha main varnya-vishay kii prastuti karata he
 In this translation, the contents of the original language are abbreviated and shortened to the target language
 lambey bhaashanon or vaad-vivaadon ke anuwaad prastut karne main yah vidhi sahaayak hoti he
 In such translations, translation of the contents of the original language along with the interpretation in the target language is introduced
 isamen anuvadak apane adhyayan or dashshtikon ke anuroop mul bhashaa kii saamagree kii vyakhya apekshit pramaanon or udaahranon aadi ke saath karata he
 Lokmanya Tilak has translated 'geeta' in this style
 sanskrit ke bahut saare bhashyakaron or hindi ke tikaakaron ne vyakhyanuwaad kii style kaa hi anugaman kiya he
 By nature, linguism or linguism becomes much larger than the original and at many levels becomes absolutely fundamental
 jahaan anuwaad dubhashiye kii bhoomika main kaam karata he, vahaan vah keval ashyanuwaad kar paata he
 Interpreters become a medium of communication between the different languages of the two remote countries when they talk among themselves
 aise avasaron par ve anuwaad shabd or bhav kii simaaon ko todakar anuvadak kii satvar anuwaad kshamta par aadhaarit ho jaataa he
 He does not have enough time to think about the correct linguistic synonym of the word or to seek the help of the dictionary
 kai baar aise dubhashiye ke ashyanuwaad ke kaaran do deshon main tanaav kii sthiti bhi ban jaati he
 Short translation is now known as interpretation
 anuwaad ke is prabhed main anuvadak mulbhasha se lakshyabhasha main keval shabd or bhav kaa anuvaadan nahin karata, apitu apni pratibha or suvidha ke anusaar mul rachana kaa puri tarah roopantaran kar daalata he
 William Shakespeare's famous play 'merchant of Venice' has been translated by Bharatendu Harishchandra as 'rare Bandhu' meaning 'mahajan of Vanshipur', which is the best example of translation
 mul naatak ke antonio, basolio, porshia, shylock jaise naamon ko bhaaratendu ne kramshah anant, basant, purashri, shailaksh jaise roopaantar pradaan kiye hai
 The originality of translation emerges most in such a conversion
 anuvadak ke in prabhedon se gyaapit hota he ki sansar bhar kii bhashaaon main anuwaad kii kai sheliyaan or pravidhiyaan apanaai gai hai, lekin yadi anuvadak saavdhaneepurvak shabd or bhav kii aatma kaa sparsh karte hue mulbhasha kii prakruti ke anuroop lakshyabhasha main anuwaad upasthit kare to yahi adarsh anuwaad hoga
 That is why the best translator is said to be such a skilled doctor, who delivers the medicine kept in the bottle as it is in the patient's body through his syringe
 anuwaad siddhanth koi apane main swatantra, swanishtha, siddhanth nahin he or na hi yah us arth main koi ‘vigyaan' hi he, jis arth main ganitshastra, bhashashastra, samajashaastra aadi hai
 It also does not have any specific study material and study system, which is different from the study material and system of other scriptures in such a way that it can basically become an independent personality
 vastutah, yah anuwaad ke vibhinn muddon se sambandhit gyanatmak soochnaaon kaa ek nikaay he, jisase anuwaad ko ek prakriya, ek nishpatti, tathaa ek sambandh ke rup main samajhane main sahaayta milti he
 For this, the words 'translation science', 'translation science', and 'translation science' are also popular
 anuwaad, bhashaprayog sambandhi ek aisi prakriya he, jisaki ek sunishchit parinti hoti he tathaa jiske falswaroop mul evam nishpatti main 'mulya' kii drushti se samanta kaa sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 Thus, information about the general nature of translation as the integrated unit of process, execution, and relationship is the translation principle, which, despite not being originally collected, is collectible, interesting, informative, and to a lesser extent real for the translation work
 apane vikaas kii vartmaan avasthaa main yah bahu-vidyaparak anushaasan ban gaya he
 Whose knowledge is itself a goal and which is a source of intellectual satisfaction for the curious reader
 anuwaad siddhanth kii anuwaad kaary main upyogita kaa akalan ke samay is samayik tathy ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he ki vartmaan kaal main anuwaad ek sangathit vyavsaay ho gaya he, jisamen vyaktigat ruchi kii apeksha vyavsaayik-saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit prashikshanarthiyon kii sankhya adhik hoti he 
 The contribution of translation theory is demonstrated in developing proficiency in translation work especially for such people and for interested translators in general
 is yogadan kaa saiddhanthik auchity is drushti se bhi he ki anuwaad kaary sarjanaatmak hone ke kaaran hi gaun rup se samikshatmak bhi hota he 
 It is also called 'creative-critical'
 sarjanaatmakataa ko vishuddh tathaa pusht karne ke liye jo samikshatmak sphuranaayen anuvadak main hoti hai, ve anuwaad siddhanth ke gyaan se prarit hoti hai 
 Principle knowledge contributes to the accuracy of translation accuracy
 saath hi, anuwaad prakriya kii jaankaree use paryaay-chayan main adhik saavdhaanee se kaam karne main sahaayta kar sakati he 
 It is considered more important that he can avoid making silly errors
 mulpath kaa bhashik, vishyavastugat, tathaa saanskrithik mahatva kaa koi ansh anudit hone se na rah jaae, iske liye apekshit satark drushti ko viksit karne main bhi anuwaad siddhanth kaa gyaan anuvadak kii sahaayta karata he 
 The same question is also seen from the other end
 kaha jaataa he ki jo log moulik likh sakate hai, ve likhte hai, jo likh nahin pate ve anuwaad karte hai, or jo log anuwaad nahin kar sakate, ve anuwaad ke bare main charchaa kiya karte hai 
 In fact, these three are complementary - all three are different - however it is believed that the translation theory experience helps the student of translation theory to make the translation discussion more authentic and vivid
 yah baat kuch aisa hi he ki sarjanaatmakataa se anubhav ke str par parichit sahitya sameekshak apni samikshatmak pratikriyaaon ko adhik vishvasotpadak reeti se prastut kar saktaa he
 Looking at the current form of translation theory, its development is seen by dividing it into two stages from the vivid view: aadhunik bhashavigyaan, vishesh rup se anuprayukt bhashavigyaan, ke vikaas se purv kaa yug-beesvin sadi purvardh; Later era - late twentieth century
 saamaanya rup se kaha jaataa he ki, siddhanth vikaas ke vibhinn yugon main or usee vibhinn dhaaraon main vivaad kaa vishay yah rahaa ki, anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa arthanugami, yadhyapi vivaad kii 'bhashaa' badalati rahi 
 BCE begins in the first century from the Roman era, when Horrens and Cicero distinguished the word for vowel and semantic translation and gave priority to the semantic translation for literary works
 siciro ne achche anuvadak ko vyakhyaakaar tathaa alankaar prayog main daksh bataaya 
 After the Roman era, which dominated literary translations, the second powerful section is the Bible translation
 sant jerome ne bhi bible ke anuwaad main arthanugamita ko pradhanta di tathaa anuwaad main dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 The idea in this was that the message of the Bible should reach the masses and for this reason, the language of comprehension should be used for the masses, in which the economical approach by nature predominated
 jaan vicliff tathaa wiliam tindl ne is pravriti kaa samarthan kiya
 The propensity to translate the Bible was encouraged, in which Martin Luther's contribution was remarkable, in the language of comprehension and beauty, and protecting the harmony between style and meaning
 tritiy dhara shikshakram main anuwaad ke yogadan se sambandhit rahi he
 Quitilian saw the utility of translation and bilingual lexical translation in the context of developing writing practice and speech-skills
 jiskaa madhyakaalin europe main adhik prasar hua 
 This raised the level of local languages and also increased their expressive power
 samrudh or viksit bhashaaon se vikasshil bhashaaon main anuwaad kii pravriti madhyakaalin europe ke saahitiyik jagat kii ek pramukh pravriti he, jise urdhvastari aayam kii pravriti kaha gaya or isi samay prachlit samaan rup se viksit yaa aviksit bhashaaon ke madhya anuwaad kii pravriti ko samastari aayam kii pravriti ke rup main dekha gaya
 Among the early theories of medieval Europe, the French scholar E
 Dolet proposed five prohibitions of translation in the essay published in 1540: anuvadak ko mul lekhak kii bhashaa kii puraa gyaan ho, parantu vah chaahe to mulbhasha kii durbodhata or aspashtataa ko dur kar saktaa he
 The translator has complete knowledge of the native language and the target language; anuvadak shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bache; Use the language of translator Dainandin's practice; anuvadak aisa shabdachayan tathaa shabdavinyas kare ki uchit prabhaav kii nishpatti ho
 George Chapman likewise proposed three sources of translation with reference to the 'iliad': shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bachaa jaae; Try to reach the spirit of the original; anuwaad, vidvatta ke sparsh ke kaaran ati shithil na ho 
 The stream of translation was a secondary trend in the Renaissance era of Europe
 is yug ke anuvaadakon main arth kii pradhanta ke saath pathak ke hiton kii raksha kii pravriti dikhaai detii he 
 In the translation of the Netherlands, the meaning of the text is reflected in the rite of the translated text by the addition and modification
 satrahavin shatabdi main england main sar jaan denham ne kavita ke anuwaad main shabdanugami hone kii pravriti kaa virodh kiya or mul paath ke kendriya tatva ko grahan kar lakshyabhasha main uske punassarjan kii baat kahi; use 'anusarjan' kaha jane laga
 In this period, John Dryden revealed important ideas
 unhone anuwaad kaary kii teen kotiyaan nirdhaarit kii : Word-per-word translation; arthanugami anuwaad, Simulation
 dryden ke anusaar or ke madhya kaa maarg avlamban yogya he 
 According to him, in translating poetry, the translator should have authority over both languages, have knowledge of the literary qualities of the original author and his 'spirit', and follow the literary ideals of his time
 aleggender pope ne bhi dyden ke samaan hi vichaar prakat kiye 
 The problem of the translator's duty to his contemporary readers was a step further from the controversy over the superstition and hyper-freedom of translation in the eighteenth century
 pathak kii ore atyadhik jhukaav ke kaaran anudit paath kaa swaroop mul paath se kaaphi dur pad jaataa tha
 To this, Dr
 Samuel Johnson said that, in translation, the culmination due to additions rather than the text can be welcomed, but attention should be paid to the loss of the text
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jis prakaar lekhak apane samakaleen pathak ke liye likhata he, usee prakaar anuvadak bhi apane samakaleen pathak ke liye anuwaad karata he 
 In Dr
 Jansan's opinion, there is a balance between the basicity of the translation and the readership
 unhone anuvadak ko aisa chitrakaar yaa anukarta kaha jo mul ke prati nishthavan hote hue bhi uddisht darshak ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhata he 
 Alexander Fraser Tittler, whose book Principles of Translation is considered the first systematic book on translation theory
 titaler ne teen anuwaad sutara prastaavit kiye : The translation should have full maintenance of the sentiment of the original composition; anuwaad kii style mul ke anuroop ho; Translations should have original comprehension
 titaler ne hi yah kaha ki, anuwaad main mul kii bhaavana is prakaar purnataya sashakrant ho jaae ki use padhkar pathakon ko utani hi teevr anubhuti ho, jitani mul ke pathakon ko hui thi; prabhavasmata kaa siddhanth yahi he 
 The influence of erstwhile poetrymaking on translation thinking in the romantic and post-romantic eras in the nineteenth century is visible
 e0 dablyoo0 shlegal ne sab prakaar ke maukhik evam likhit bhashaa vyavhaar ko anuwaad kii sangya di, tathaa mul ke gathan ko sangrakshit rakhane par bal diya 
 In this age, on the one hand, there is a tendency for the translator to think like a creative writer, on the other hand, it was said that the translation should be emphasized to make it translatable
 kuch vidwaanon ne anuwaad kii bhinn upbhasha hone kaa charchaa kii jo uparyukt manyataon se mail khaati he
 The translators of the Victorian Section have been striving to preserve the distance between country and time in translation - foreign language and antiquity are not lost in the translation of ancient works of foreign languages - which in turn encouraged the trend of vernacular translation
 laungphelo iske samarthak the 
 But Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Khayyam's rubies, had the opposite view
 ve is manyata ke samarthak the ki, anuwaad ke pathak ko mul bhashaa paath ke nikat laane ke sthaan par mulbhasha paath kii saanskrithik visheshtaon ko lakshyabhasha main is prakaar prastut kiya jaae ki, vah lakshyabhasha kaa apni sajiv sampatti prathit ho, tathaa is prakriya main mulbhasha se anuwaad kii badhi hui duuri kii upeksha kar di jaae 
 Two-three translation thinkers are notable in the first half of the twentieth century
 kroche tathaa velri ne anuwaad kii safalataa, vishesh rup se kavita ke anuwaad kii safalataa, main sandeh vyakt kiye hai
 Matthew Arnold emphasized the adoption of a simple, direct and lofty style in the translation of Homer's works
 is prakaar aadhunik bhashavigyaan ke udai se purv kii avadhi main anuwaad chintan praayah do virodhatmak manyataon ke chaaron ore ghumta rahaa
 Those two beliefs are as follows - anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa swatantra ho, Translation is impossible from the point of view of its inner nature, but very important from the social point of view
 is avadhi ke anuwaad chintan main kul milakar sanghatnatmak tathaa vibhedatmak drushtiyon kaa santulan dekha jaataa rahaa - sanghatnatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa swaroop abhipret he jo saamaanya koti kaa ho, tathaa vibhedatmak drushti main paathon kii prakrutigat vibhinnata ke aadhaar par anuwaad kii pranali main aavashyak parivartan kii charchaa kaa antarbhaav he 
 The scholars pondered abstraction during this period, but they could not think of a translation system
 mulpath ke antargyanamoolak bodhan se ve vishleshnatmak bodhan ke lakshya kii ore to bade parantu uske peeche sunishchit siddhanth kii bhoomika nahin rahi
 Apart from translators, among these thinkers, there were more litterateurs and literature reviewers, not linguists
 iske atirikt ve ek-duusare ke chintan se parichit hon, aisa bhi prathit nahin hota tha
 Although modern linguistics emerged in the first half of the twentieth century, the latter period is important in terms of the relevance of translation theory
 is avadhi main bhashavigyaan se parichit anuvaadakon tathaa bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan anuwaad siddhanth kii ore aakrisht hua 
 The development of structural linguistics, the advancement of semantics, the coordination of communication theory and linguistics, and the development of various branches of applied linguistics - sociolinguistics, stylology, psychodynamics, propensity analysis - and the rise of semiotics, especially text signaling, are considered such phenomena, Which is important in terms of confirming and developing the translation theory It was considered angl-amareeki dhara main ek vidvan uzen naida bhi maane jate hai
 On the basis of Bible-translation experience, he gave his views on translation theory and practice as texts
 inamen anuwaad siddhanth kaa vistrut, vishad tathaa tarksangat rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Describing the translation process, Nida presented a definite linguistic principle for the analysis of the original language text and laid down various dimensions for restructuring the message in the target language
 unhone anuwaad kii sthiti se sambaddh donon bhashaaon ke bich vividhstareey samyojanon kaa vivaran prastut kiya 
 Other scholars are Catford, whose translation theory exemplifies the application of structural linguistics
 unhone shuddh bhashavaigyanik aadhaar par anuwaad ke praroopo kaa nirdhaaran kiya, anuwaad-parivritti kaa bhashavaigyanik vivaran diya, tathaa anuwaad kii simaaon par vichaar kiya 
 The third influential scholar is Peter Numark, who attempted to present a logical and thorough discussion of translation theory in a structured and intimate style
 ve apane vichaaron ko upyukt udaahranon se spasht karte chalate hai
 In contrast to Naida, he offered recognition of a specific translation system according to the text format
 unka anuwaad siddhanth ko yogadan he ki, anuwaad kii arthkendrit tathaa sampreshan kendrit pranali kii sankalpana 
 He presented several translation formulas related to text analysis, communication and expression situations in the target language; It is also considered to be a notable feature of them
 europea parampara main german bhashaa kaa lipsig skool prabhaavshaalee mana jaataa he 
 It is believed that translation of all kinds of experiences is possible
 yah skool paath ke sangyanatmak tathaa sandarbhparak angon main antar maanata he tathaa roopaantaran vyakaran or pathasanketavigyaan kaa bhi upyog karata he 
 This school focused more on the translation of non-literary texts

 In Russian tradition, Fedorov considers translation theory to be an independent linguistic discipline

 Formats of linguistic analysis of the language have been designed according to the needs of the device, and assistance has been taken especially in the translation of technological texts

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity
 kahin par 24 volt kii jarurat ho to 12 volt vaali do badariyon ko shreneekram main jodakar 24 volt praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components
 It depends

 There is a restriction on mixing these in one word
 "turki main" ko turki bhashaa main "tuirkiye de" kahenge, lekin "germany main" ko "almanya da" kahana hoga, kyonki i or uthh ke swar aage ke hai or inhen 'aa' ke saath milaanaa varjit he kyonki vah ek peeche kaa swar he
 In addition to the Turkish language, vocal support is seen in several languages of the Turkish language family, such as in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz and Uygur

 Jainism teaches that every living being is responsible for its actions
 It insists that we live, think and act respectfully and honor the spiritual nature of all life
 Jains view God as the unchanging traits of the pure soul of each living being, chiefly described as Infinite Knowledge, Perception, Consciousness, and Happiness 
 Jainism does not include a belief in an omnipotent supreme being or creator, but rather in an eternal universe governed by natural laws, and the interplay of its attributes of matter 
 Jain scriptures were written over a long period and the most cited is the Tattvartha Sutra, or Book of Reality written by Umasvati, the monk-scholar, more than 18 centuries ago
 The primary figures in Jainism are Tirthankars
 Jainism has two main divisions: Digambar and Shvetambar and both believe in ahimsa, asceticism, karma, sansar, and jiva
 Compassion for all life, human and non human, is central toja Jainism
 Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment and to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is unimaginably abhorrent
 It is the only religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian
 Some Indian regions have been strongly influenced by Jains and often, the majority of the local non Jain population has also become vegetarian
 History suggests that various strains of Hinduism became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences
 In many towns, Jains run animal shelters, e

 The cloth over his face is to prevent spit, mucus, or bacteria from the mouth or nose from landing on holy images, books or the idols of the Tirtankars Jainism's stance on nonviolence goes beyond vegetarianism
 Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty
 Many are vegan due to the violence of modern dairy farms
 The orthodox Jain diet excludes most root vegetables, as they believe this destroys life unnecessarily
 Another reason for refusing root vegetables is to avoid destroying entire plants
 If you eat apples, you do not destroy whole trees, but for root vegetables, whole plants are uprooted
 Garlic and onions are avoided as these are seen as creating passion, meaning anger, hatred, jealousy
 Observant Jains do not eat, drink, or travel after sunset and always rise before sunrise
 Anekantavada, a foundation of Jain philosophy literally meaning "nonsingular Conclusivity", or equivalently, "non-one-endedness"
 Anekantavad consists of tools for overcoming inherent biases in any one perspective on a topic, object, process, state, or on reality in general
 Another tool is The Doctrine of Postulation, Syādvāda
 Anekantavad is defined as a multiplicity of views for it stresses looking at things from another's perspective
 Jains are remarkably welcoming and friendly towards other faiths
 Several non-jain temples in India are administered by Jains
 The Jain Heggade family has run the Hindu institutions of Dharmasthala, including the Sri Manjunath Temple, for eight centuries
 Jains willingly donate money to churches and mosques and usually help with interfaith functions
 Jain monks, like Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Sushil Kumar, actively promoted harmony among rival faiths to defuse tension
 Jains have been a palpable presence in Indian culture, contributing to Indian philosophy, art, architecture, sciences, and to Mohandas Gandhi's politics, which led to the mainly non-violent movement for Indian independence
 Contour lines or lines are a curve that has the same value of a physical amount
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi kshetra ke maanchitr par saamaan oonchaai vaale biduon ko milaane vaali rekhaayen samocch rekhaayen kehalaayengi
 In other words, if a physical zodiac is a function of two variables, then imagine a curve in this plane which has the same physical zodiac at all points, then this curve will be called a circumference
 maanchitran main praayah samaan oonchaai vaale binduon ko milakar samocch rekhaayen banaayi jaatin hai
 But contour lines are used in many other areas besides mapping

 Chukafa and his followers established the Ahom dynasty in Assam
 chukaafaa or use uttaradhikariyon ne ahom samrajya ko 6 shatabdi tak chalaaya or vistaar kiya
 After winning the First anglo-burmese War in 1826, the British entered into a Treaty of Yandubu with the Ahom Kings and established control in the region

 The Ahom kingdom also accepted people from other communities as Ahom members for the utility of their talent and on the basis of their loyalty
 samay ke saath saath ahom logon ne hindu dharm or bhartiya samskruti ke anya pahaluon ko apana liya
 At the same time, instead of Ahom language, he adopted Assamese language as his language of speech
 haalanki ahom aabaadi ke ek tihaai log abhi bhi pracheen tai dharm phurlang kaa paalan karte hai
 By the middle of the 20th century, about 400–500 people belonging to the priestly and upper classes of the Ahom people spoke the Ahom language 
 parantu ab ahom bhashaa bolne vaale nahin yaa nammaatr ko rah gaye hai
 This is a matter of concern for the Ahom public meeting
 ab phir se aam janata ke bich phir se tai ahom bhashaa ko punerjeevit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 For this, various Tai Ahom organizations are setting up Tai schools in Upper Assam and motivating children to study Tai language

 1901 ke janaganana ke mutabik bharat main ahom logon kii kul jansankhya 1,79,000 ke aasapaas thi
 According to the 2011 census, now the population of Ahom people in India is more than 20,00,000, but if the population of people who convert from the original Ahom caste to another caste and sub-caste is added, then this number will be more than 80,00,000

 The succeeding generations of Ahom people married girls from these tribes and settled in Assam completely
 ahom raja suhungamung ne hindu naam 'swarg narayan' apanaaya or baad main sabhi ahom raajaaon ko asamiya bhashaa main “swargdev” bulaayaa gaya
 Ahom kings were called "chao-fa" in Tai language
 ahom raajaaon ke rajbhishek samaaroh ko Singarigharutha ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The Ahom rulers and people prevented the expansion of the Mughalia Sultanate into Assam

 digital watermarking soochna ko digital signal main ek aise tareeqe se antahsthapit karne kii prakriya he, jise hataanaa mushkil he
 This signal can be, for example, audio, picture, or video
 yadi signal kii nakal utaari jaati he, to soochna bhi pratilipi main utar jaati he
 a signal can have many different watermarks at the same time
 drishy watermarking main soochna, chitra yaa video main dikhaai detii he
 There is usually information, text, or logo that identifies the owner of the media
 dayee ore chhavi par ek drishy watermark he
 When a television broadcaster adds its logo to the corner of the communicated video, it is also a visual watermark
 adrishy watermarking main, soochna ko audio, chitra yaa video main digital data ke rup main joda jaataa he, lekin use pratyaksh dekha nahin ja saktaa 
 watermark vyapak upyog ke uddeshy se ho saktaa he or is prakaar aasaani se punah praapt karne yaa stegenographi ke rup main ho saktaa he, jahaan paksh digital signal main antarsthapit gupt sandesh ko sampreshit karti he
 In both cases the purpose, like visual watermarking, is to add ownership or other descriptive information to the signal in such a way that it is difficult to remove
 yah bhi sambhav he ki vyaktiyon ke bich gupt sanchaar ke saadhan ke rup main prachhann antarsthapit soochna kaa upyog kiya jaae
 An application of watermarking is the copyright protection system, intended to prevent or prevent unauthorized copying of digital media
 is prayog main ek pratilipi saadhan pratilipi banane se pehle signal se watermark ko punahprapt karata he; vah saadhan watermark kii antarvastu ke aadhaar par pratilipi banane yaa naa banane kaa nirnay letaa he
 Another application is in source tracking

 If a copy of the work is found later, the watermark can be retrieved from the copy and the source of the distribution can be found

 Another application of invisible watermarking is the interpretation of digital photographs with descriptive information
 jahaan digital media ke kuch fil praroopon main metadata naamak atirikt soochna shaamil ho sakati he, digital watermarking is arth main bhinn he ki data signal main hi shaamil hota he
 The use of the term watermarking is derived from the very old notion of placing visual watermarks on paper
 digital watermarking kaa upyog anuprayogon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: The information that is to be embedded is called a digital watermark, although in some contexts the phrase digital watermark means the difference between a watermarked signal and a cover signal
 signal jahaan watermark ko antarsthapit kiya janaa ho, poshak signal kehalaata he
 Typically the watermarking system is divided into three distinct phases, interconnection, attack, and detection
 In embedding, an algorithm accepts the nutrients and data to be embedded and produces a watermark signal
 iske baad watermark kiya gaya signal prasaarit yaa sangrahit kiya jaataa he, aam taur par kisi anya vyakti ko sampreshit hota he
 If the person makes an amendment, it is called an attack
 jabaki sanshodhan durbhaavnapurna nahin ho saktaa he, shabd hamalaa copirite sangrakshan anuprayog se aayaa he, jahaan piret sanshodhan ke madhyam se digital watermark ko hataane ke prayaas karte hai
 Several possible modifications exist, for example, lossy compression of data, visualization of an image or video, or deliberately adding noise
 sansuchan ek elgoridam he, jise akramit signal par lagu kiya jaataa he taaki usase watermark nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya jaae

 The time ball or kalgenda ek was the name of the now-defunct time-indicator tactic, which was previously used to indicate offshore ships and sailors exact times so that bandargahs or other ships going on a voyage would be able to sail their sea-going voyages
 To determine accurately before moving on
 19veen sadi main iskaa istamaal charam par tha
 With the invention and circulation of electronic time signals, the use of this past tactic gradually became widespread, but in some places it is still kept as historical tourist attractions
 iska avishkar san 1829 main rabart vashop naamak ek angrez admiral dwaara kiya gaya tha
 This instrument was very important for time measurement, its inventor Robert Washop gave the time ball in English
 yah shabd do angrezi shabdon se bana he- time arthath samay or bal arthath gend, jiskaa arth hota he samay / kaal kii gend
 It can be translated into Hindi as Kaalgenda or Samay Ball

 Sea chronometers are used for scheduling in ships

 For this purpose, Robert Washop invented the time ball
 vishv ke pehle time bal ko portsmouth, england main 1829 main avishkaarak rabart vashop dwaara lagaaya gaya tha, jo apane kaam main kaafii rafal rahaa
 Subsequently, it was gradually extended to UCO and other ports of the world
 isi silsile main ek time bal ko greenvich kii shahi vedhashala main bhi shodhakarta jaan pound dwaara lagaaya gaya, jo aaj bhi, har rose, ek baje apane maanak sthaan se neeche girti he
 Washope successfully presented the plan to the French and US ambassadors, and along with it the first Taimo Ball of America was established at the American Navigation Observatory in Washington DC
 kaalgendon ko aam taur par dopaher 1 baje giraaya jaataa tha
 Kaalgenda stations used to set their clocks according to the position of the sun and stars, otherwise they had to resort to an extreme clock which was fixed by hand again and again at altruistic times
 atah steshnon ko aam taur par kisi vedhashala main hi rakhaa jaataa tha
 This situation improved with the introduction of telegraph in 1850 and remote scheduling became possible
 is se kaalgend steshnon ko vedhashala se dur, tat ke paas sthapit kiya jane laga or sateek samay kii jaankaree taar dwaara bheji jane lagi
 In the 1920s, with the introduction of radio signaling, the calligraph became obsolete, and was gradually removed from all places
 saamaanya gyaay ke liye, har kaalgend main ek bada golakaar gend hoti thi, jise ek rad par upar se neeche tak hilaayaa ja saktaa tha
 There was a predetermined time to drop the ball in every Kaalgenda station, which was known to every sailor
 isi purvanirdhaarit samay par kriyanusaar pratidin bal ko giraaya jaataa tha
 About 5 minutes before dropping, the ball was flown up to halfway to alert the ships
 phir 2-3 minute pehle use rad par puri tarah upar uthaakar phir usee purvanirdhaarit samay par neeche giraaya jaataa tha or gend kaa girnaa shuru hote hi samay darj kar liya jaataa tha
 Inspired by this process, a time ball is picked up at 12 o'clock in New York's Times Square on New Year's Night

 pali pracheen uttar bharat ke logon kii bhashaa thi
 It was spoken from Bihar in the east to haryana-rajasthan in the west and nepal-uttar Pradesh in the north to Madhya Pradesh in the south
 bhagwaan buddha bhi inhen pradesho main viharan karte hue logon ko dharm samajhaate rahe
 Today Hindi is spoken in these regions
 isliye, paali pracheen hindi he
 It is a dialect or Prakrit in the indo-european language family
 isko buddha tripitak kii bhashaa ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Pali was written in the scripts of the Brahmi family
 pali shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke naanaa mat paae jate hai
 Some have tried to generate it from the word text and some from the pyad
 ek german vidvan maiks vailaser ne pali ko 'patli' kaa sankshipt rup bataakar yah mat vyakt kiya he ki uskaa arth patliputra kii pracheen bhashaa se he
 One of the two opinions that scholars have more inclination towards than these derivatives, is the opinion of Pt
 Vidushekhar Bhattacharya, according to which the word Pali is derived from the line
 is mat kaa prabal samarthan ek pracheen pali kosh abhidhanppadipika se hota he, kyonki usamen tanti, buddhavachan, panti or pali in shabdon me bhi spasht hi pali kaa arth pankti hi he
 The usage of Pali found in the above two meanings also proves meaningful in this sense
 buddhavachanon kii pankti yaa paath kii pankti kaa arth buddhaghosh ke prayogon main baith jaataa he
 However, according to phonology, derivation of Pali cannot be derived from the word line
 uski apeksha pankti ke arth main prachlit deshi shabd pali, paathth, padu se hi is shabd kaa sabandh jodna adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 The word Pali is also found to be prevalent in Sanskrit
 abhidhanppadipika main jo pali kii vyutpatti "paaleti rakkhtiti pali", is prakaar batalaai gai he usase bhi is mat kaa samarthan hota he
 But the monk Jagdish Kashyapa, the doer of "pali Mahavikaran", has raised some objections about taking Pali in the sense of line and has tried to explain it derived from the word 'pariyya' used in many places in the original Tripitaka texts
 samrat ashok ke bhabru shilaalekh main tripitak ke 'dhammpariyaay' shabd sthaan par magadhi pravriti ke anusaar 'dhamm paliyaay' shabd kaa prayog paaya jaataa he, jiskaa arth buddha-upadesh yaa vachan hota he
 According to Kashyap Ji, Pali was derived from this palyaan refuge
 mul tripitak main bhashaa kaa kahin koi naam nahin miltaa
 But Buddhaghosha etc
 Acharyas have called the language of Buddha's teachings as Magadhi
 visuddhimagg evam mahavans main is magadhi ko sab praaniyon kii mulbhasha kaha gaya he
 The use of the word Pali is not usually found before the 14th century AD
 haan, buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main pali shabd kaa prayog kiya he, kintu yah bhashaa ke arth main nahin, buddhavachan athwa mooltripitak ke paath ke arth main kiya he or vah bhi praaia: us paath ko atthkatha se bhinn dikhalaane ke liye
 Thus somewhere he has said that its policy is like this, but it is so in the story, or it is neither in the policy nor in the story
 buddhaghosh ke samay se kuch purv likhe gaye dipawans main tathaa unke pashchaatkaaleen mahavans aadi rachanaaon main bhi pali shabd kaa inhen do arthon main prayog kiya gaya paaya jaataa he
 With the same meaning, the word Pali started being used for that literature and its language respectively
 bhashaa kii drushti se pali us madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa ek rup he jiskaa vikaas lagbhag i
pus
 chhathi shatee se mana jaataa he
 Prior to that, the form of the ancient Indian Aryabhasha is found in the Vedas and the Brahmins, Upanishads and texts of Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc
, which are called 'vedic language' and 'sanskrit language'
 vaidic bhashaa evam sanskrit kii apeksha madhyakaalin bhashaaon kaa bhed pramukhataa se nimna baton main paaya jaataa he : Grammatically ye visheshtaayen madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke saamaanya lakshan hai or desh kii un lokbhashaon main paae jate hai jinka suprachaar ukt avadhi se koi do hajaar varsh tak rahaa or jinka bahut-sa sahitya bhi uplabdh he
 Apart from the above general characteristics, there are many differences in these languages as compared to their country and time
 kaal kii drushti se unke teen str maane gaye hai - The languages of all these eras have been given a common name Prakrit
 iske pratham str ko bhashaaon kaa swaroop ashok kii prashastiyon tathaa pali sahitya main praapt hota he
 Among the second level languages are Magadhi, Ardhamagadhi, Shaurseni and Maharashtri Prakrit languages whose rich literature is available
 tritiy str kii bhashaaon ko apbhransh ev avahatth naam die gaye hai
 The earliest introduction to the distinction of medieval languages is found in the scriptures of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka
 inamen teen pradeshbhed spasht hai - purvi, pashchimi or pashchimottaree
 The form of the Eastern language appears in the commendations of Dhauli and Jaugarh
 inamen r ke sthaan par l tathaa aakarant shabdon ke kartakarak ekvachan kii vibhakti e supratishthit he
 The grammar of Prakrit has counted these tendencies in the characteristic features of the Magadhi Prakrit
 vaiyakarnon ke matanusaar is magadhi praakrit kaa teesraa vishesh lakshan teenon ooshm varnon ke sthaan par sh kaa prayog he
 But this trend is not found in the above articles of Ashoka, because it is used here instead of three heaters
 isi kaaran ashok kii is purvi praakrit ko magadhi na kahkar ardhamagadhi kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt he
 Girnar commendations are among those representing the Western language distinction
 inamen r or l kaa bhed surakshit he
 Sc is used in place of thermodynamics and the causative factor ends in the singular form o
 in pravritiyon se spasht he ki yah bhashaa shauraseni kaa pracheen rup he
 The form of the Northwestern language appears in the commendations of Shahbazgarhi and Mansera
 inamen praaia: sh, sh, s ye teenon ooshm varna apane sthaan par surakshit hai
 Some obsessions are visible at some places
 rakaryukt sanyuktavarna bhi dikhaai dete hai, tathaa jna or nya ke sthaan par ranna, kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 These trends indicate that language is an earlier form of paischi prakrit
 pali tripitak kaa kuch bhaag avashya hi ashok ke kaal main saahitiyik rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha kyonki uske lahulovad, moneysutt aadi saat prakarnon kaa ullekh unki bhabru kii prashasti main hua he
 But in the language of available literature, the language related features of Ashoka's eastern inscription are often lacking
 vyapak rup se pali bhashaa kaa swaroop girnaar prashasti kii bhashaa se sarvaadhik mail khaataa he or isi kaaran pali mulat: purvadeshiy nahin, kintu madhyadeshiy he
 The feature that makes Pali the first level of medieval Indian Aryan Bhasha, not the second, is the lack of intermediate decadent consonants and the order of h in place of Mahaprana Varna
 ye pravritiyaan dwitiya str kii bhashaaon ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 Yes, somewhere in place of the negative characters such as the name of the dark characters, etc
 appears
 kintu yah ek to alpamaatra main hi he or duusare vah pratham str kii ukt maryaada ke bheetar apekshaakrit pashchaatkaal kii pravriti kaa dyotak he
 With regard to the Pali language and the medieval Indian Aryan languages, it is important to note that the Sanskrit language which is believed to be from Sanskrit is not correct
 yatharthat: vedikakaal se hi saahitiyik bhashaa ke saath saath usase milti julati lokbhasha ne desh evam kalbhedanusaar saahitiyik praakrit bhashaaon kaa rup dhaaran kiya he
 Pali is also not taking its entire heritage from Sanskrit, because its word forms are found in such a way that it does not match Sanskrit but with the language of the Vedas
 udaahranarth- pali evam anya prakriton main tritiya bahuvachan ke deverbhi, devehi, jaise rup milte hai
 Such forms of non-formative nouns are completely lacking in Sanskrit, but Devearbhi in Vedic is as well-known as Devaैī
 atev ukt rup kii parampara pali tathaa prakriton main vaidic bhashaa se hi udbhoot maani ja sakati he
 Similarly, in Pali, 'yamamase', 'masre', 'katwe', etc
 are many forms whose suffixes are not found in Sanskrit, but are present in Vedic language
 pali ke granthon tathaa ashok kii prashastiyon se purv kaa praakrit main likhit sahitya uplabdh nahin he tathaa praakrit vaiyakarnon ne apni suvidha ke liye sanskrit ko prakruti maanakar praakrit bhashaa kaa vyakarnatmak vishleshan kiya he or isiilie yah bhranti utpann ho gai he ki praakrit bhashaaon kii utpatti sanskrit se hui
 This flaw is not found in Pali's Kachchan, Moggallan etc
 grammar, because Sanskrit was not described as a standard of nature
