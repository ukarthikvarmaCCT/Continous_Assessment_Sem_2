 These people speak the Madi dialect of Gondi language
 abujhmaad ke angadh jangalon main nivas karne vaali is janajati nivas ne ajtak apni mul parampara or samskruti ko sahej kar rakhaa hua he
 The Madia tribe is mainly divided into two sub-castes - Abuz Madiya and Bison Horn Madia
 abujh maadiya abujhamaad ke pahari kshetron main nivas karte he or baisan horn maadiya indravati nadi se lage huye maidani jangalo main
 Bison horn madia is called by this name, because they wear the crown of Baisan ie Gaur horn when dancing in ghotools and on special occasions
 inke sthanantarit krishi ko jhum kehete hai
 The culture of both the tribes is very similar
 ye dono hi bahari logon se milanaa julna pasand nahin karte lekin dono main abujh maadiya zyada akramak hai, ve bahari logon ke apane ilaake main aane par tir-kaman se hamalaa karnaa nahin chookte
 While the Bison Horn Madia mostly like to run in the woods when outsiders come
 maadiya log behad khushmijaaj sharaab ke shaukeen or masamutiyaa hote he
 'masmutiya' is the local word of Chhattisgarh which means to be angry like a child quickly and then to forget it immediately
 maadiya kaksaar naam ke kul devtaa kii aradhana karte hai
 For good harvest, they perform magnificent dances in honor of their deity
 sangeet or naach main inaki bhavyata dekhne laayak hoti he
 They are very skilled hunters and have great courage
 hamalaa hone par yah baagh junglee bhise yaa bhaaluu se loha lene main nahin hichakate
 They highly respect the tiger and never hunt tigers unnecessarily
 yadi koi baagh kaa shikaar karne ke iraade se inke ilaake main jaay to maadiya use jinda nahin chhodte
 The people of Madiya are ready to fulfill their promise upon fulfilling it
 maadiya logo main ghotul parampara kaa paalan hota he jisame gaanv ke sabhi kunvaare ladke ladkiyaan shaam hone par gaanv ke ghetul ghar main rahane jate hai
 There is one head in Ghatul and one coat wise, both these positions are usually given to boys with big kuwanas
 sirdaar ghetul kaa pramukh hota he or kotwar use vahaan kii vyavastha sanbhaalane main madad karata he
 First of all the boys enter Ghatul and then the girls
 kotwar sabhi ladakiyon ko alag alag ladakon main baat detaa he
 No couple stays together for more than two or three days
 iske baad ladkiyaan ladakon ke bal savanrati he or hatho kii maalish karke unhe tarotaaja karti he
 After that everyone dances outside the ghotul
 naach main vivaahit aurate hissaa nahin le sakati lekin vivaahit purush le sakate hai
 Usually they play instruments
 naach main har ladke ek haath ek ladki ke kandhe par or duusari ke qamar par hota he
 They dance by making a circle around the fire
 nrity ke samay ke saath tej hota jaataa hai
 The lyrics of a song sung at the time of dance are like this - jaisaa ki is geet se spasht he maadiya janajaati main vivaah ke liye ladki kii keemat adaa kerani padati he keemat naa de paane kii sthiti main ladke ko ladki ke pita ke ghar kuch samay tak kaam karnaa padataa he yah avadhi teen se saat varsh tak kii ho sakati he
 In the event of such marriage, the couple is not allowed to make physical relations in the first year of service, but if the girl agrees, then the bond is removed
 maadiya logon main vivaah hi jivan kaa sabase bada kharch hota he
 To get married, both the parties sit and decide the price
 or var paksh ko yah keemat chukaani hoti he
 Madiya people are allowed to have sexual relations with single young girls
 ghotul main badi umr ke yuvak yuvatiyaan choti umr ke yuvak yuvatiyon ko shaareerik shiksha kii sikh dete hai
 Here, once the marriage is mutually agreed, the young women have to tell the family members to get married
 unke raji naa hone par aksar ve jangal bhaag jate hai
 But even in such a marriage one has to pay the price
 abujhmadiya ghotul main ladkiyaan raat main nahin soti, lekin ladke raat main ghotul main hi rukate hai
 But in Bison Horn Madia, they spend the night in Ghotul
 maadiya mahilayen apane pati ke saath khaat par nahin soti or kisi umr se bade purush ke ghar par hone par vah khaat par nahin baithti
 If Madia is taken away by a tiger, they consider her a divine wrath
 khaskar ise patni ke avaidh sambandh se joda jaataa he
 If the tiger also takes another animal of the same madia in a short time, then he starts keeping a close watch on his wife
 maadiya samaaj main aniatik sambandhu ko bilkul bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa
 But if the woman is not happy with her husband, then she can choose a second husband without any opposition, provided that the person pays the price of the marriage spent on the first wife
 maadiya jati main bahuvivaah kii ijaajat bhi he, lekin vivaah main aane vaale baari kharch ke kaaran aisa yada kada hi hota he
 Widow marriage is also allowed in these
 maadiya janajati main maut ke baad aam taur par kabr main dafanaaya jaataa he, lekin kuch maamalon main shav ko jalaayaa bhi jaataa he
 This age depends on the cause of death and disease etc
 bacchon ko mahua ke ped ke neeche dafanaaya jaataa he, aisa mana jaataa he ki mahua ke ped se ras paakar uski aatma trupt ho jaayegi
 With this song, you can know about his thinking about death- shilong times bharat main prakashit hone vaala ek angreji bhashaa kaa samachar patr he

 It falls in the Northern Thailand region and is contiguous with the Shan State of Burma, the Qin State and the Qayah State in the northwest part of the country
 pakaraa navgachhiya, bhagalpur, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 Dhakia Naru, this village is located in Tehsil Bilari, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh as per Indian census
 rajya code : 09 jila code : 135 tehsil code : 00720 In the context of Anglo law, the meaning of the right is 'right of one person to the land of another'
 'suvidhadhikaar' shabd french athwa norman udbhav kaa prathit hota he
 The privilege is probably as ancient as the right to property
 isaki pehali paribhaasha 'termes de Laley' naamak pustak main di gai he
 Privileges are discussed in both Hindu and Muslim law books, but the courts of British India did not enforce them, although they could enforce such individual laws which were not against justice, equity and clean conscience, or which were conservative or Had taken the form of custom
 bharat kii bhinn sthiti ko dekhte hue angreji kanoon ke niyamon ko bhi yahan lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Hence, in India, at the very beginning, the need for a codified law on this subject was felt
 san 1882 main bhartiya suvidhadhikaar kanoon paas kiya gaya
 This law was mainly based on the draft of Whitley Stokes
 aarambh main yah kanoon keval madras, kurg or madhya praant hi main lagu kiya gaya parantu samay-samay par ise anya kshetron main lagu kiya jaataa rahaa
 The Indian Limitation Act, 1877, was included in the Indian Legislation Act before the Bill of Rights passed
 bhartiya suvidhadhikaar vidheyak main suvidhadhikaar kii yah paribhaasha di gai he: The land which is given this right for the beneficial use is called the land of the facilitator - the owner of the land or the owner is called the owner of the land
 jis bhoomi par yah daayitv lagu hota he use suvidhabhaarit bhoomi or uske swami athwa adhibhokta ko suvidhabhaarit swami kehete hai
 a landlord named 'A' has the right to go to the land of 'B' and take water from a spring for his use from there - this will be called a privilege
 suvidhadhikaar sakaaratmak ho saktaa he athwa nakaaratmak- yah nirantar ho saktaa he athwa saviram
 The right to continue doing the right to do something on the land of the land is a positive privilege - the right to stop or to stop doing something on it is a negative right
 nirantar suvidhadhikaar vah he jiskaa upbhog athwa nirantar upbhog manushya dwaara kuch kiye bina hi hota rahata he jaise roshni paane kaa adhikaar
 Intermittent privileges are those for which man's active cooperation is necessary, such as the use of avenues for passing
 suvidhadhikaar pratyaksh ho saktaa he athwa apratyaksh
 a direct right is one in which there is a visible permanent sign of its existence
 agar aisa koi dikhaai dene vaala chinh nahin he, to suvidhadhikaar apratyaksh hoga
 The privilege may be permanent or periodically or periodically binding
 suvidhadhikaar keval vishesh sthaan athwa vishesh samay ke liye yaa kisi vishesh uddeshy ke liye bhi ho saktaa he
 The right of access may come from express or voided grants or from its use for a long time; It can be from chronic or it can become stereotyped
 jahaan suvidhadhikaar aavashyak ho, vahaan kanoon dhvanit suvidhadhikaar sweekaar karata he, jaise ek imaarat kii adla badali yaa vibhaajan ke falswaroop agar ise do yaa do se adhik alag hisson main vibhajit kiya jaae or in hisson main se koi ek is sthiti main ho ki use jab tak anya hisson par koi visheshadhikaar nahin de diya jaataa, tab tak uskaa sadupyog nahin ho saktaa, to is visheshadhikaar chirbhog ko kanoon sweekaar karegaa or ise dhvanit visheshadhikaar kahenge
 For the acceptance of privilege by the perpetrator, it is mandatory that this right has been exercised without any hindrance for the last twenty years
 suvidhadhikari or suvidhabhaarit ke bich hue samjhaute ke falswaroop agar kisi adhikaar kaa upbhog kiya gaya he to usase chirbhog suvidhadhikaar kii prapti nahin hoti
 Any obstruction that the facilitator has not given silent approval for one year, or an obstacle which has been accepted in the agreement between the facilitator and the facilitator, has no effect on the continuity of consumption and thus no obsolescence in the attainment of the privilege by the perpetrator There is no obstruction
 roodhi dwaara suvidhadhikaar kii prapti ke liye yah aavashyak he ki roodhi pracheen, ekarup or yuktisangat ho
 It has been consumed continuously and openly
 roodhi sambandhi suvidhadhikaron athwa abhivyakt anudaan se utpann suvidhadhikaron ko chhodkar baaki suvidhadhikaron or suvidhabhaarit swaamiyon ke liye bhartiya suvidhadhikaar vidheyak main kuch saamaanya kartavya or adhikaar nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai, jaise suvidhadhikari ko apane adhikaar kaa upbhog us dhang se karnaa chahie jo suvidhabhaarit swaamiyon ke liye kam se kam durbhar ho; suvidhadhikaar ke upbhog ke karm ke falswaroop agar suvidhabhaarit sampatti ityadi ko koi kshati pahunchati he, to jahaan tak sambhav ho suvidhadhikaron ko uski purti kerani chahie
 Under the Bill, the authority has been stripped of the owner of the authority to self-extinguish the undue obstacles put in the way of the officer
 suvidhadhikaar kii samaapti, nirmukti athwa anyrpan athwa niyat avadhi kii samaapti par ho sakati he
 Additionally, it can also be terminated if the attached termination phase is generated
 aavashyaktaa sambandhi suvidhadhikaar kii samaapti us aavashyaktaa kii samaapti par ho sakati he jiske liye yah suvidhadhikaar diya gaya tha
 The privilege is given only for the beneficial use of the property, hence the owner of the facility does not have the right to demand to keep it operational
 angreji kanoon main paraswabhoga varg main adhikaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 This is not so in Indian law
 paraswabhoga adhikaar ve hai jo padosi bhoomi ke laabhon main bhaag lene se sambhddha hai, jaise charaagaah ke adhikaar yaa shikaar athwa machhlee pakadaney kaa adhikaar
 Evolution is the change of genetic traits of a biological population with generations
 jaivik aabaadiyon main genetic parivartan ke kaaran avlokan yogya lakshanon main parivartan hota he
 As genetic diversity varies with generations, natural selection makes those traits more common that provide greater success in survival and reproduction
 prithvi kii umr lagbhag 4
54 arab varsh he
 The oldest undisputed evidence of life is 3
5 billion years old
 ye saboot pashchimi australia main 3
5 varsh puraane balua pathar main mili microbial chataayee ke jeevashm hai
 Older, but conflicting evidence of this life is: 1) 3
7 billion years old graphite found in Greenland, a biogenic substance, and 2) "remains of biotic life" found in 4
1 billion year old stones in Western Australia in 2015
 kram-vikaas jivan kii utpatti ko samajhane kii koshish nahin karata he 
 But evolution explains how today's complex life has evolved from ancient simple life
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyon ke bich samanta dekh kar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prithvi ke sabhi jeevon kaa ek saajha purvaj he
 This is called the last public ancestor
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyaan kram-vikaas kii prakriya ke dwaara is se utpann hui hai
 All individuals have a genetic material in the form of genes
 sabhi shaks ise apane mata-pita se grahan karte hai or apni santan ko dete hai
 The genes of the offspring vary slightly
 iskaa kaaran utparivartan or langik janan ke dauraan maujuuda jeens main pherbadal he
 Due to this, children are slightly different from parents and each other
 agar wo bhinnataayen upyogi hoti hai to santan ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Because of this, the chances of surviving and breeding different individuals of the next generation are not equal
 falswaroop jo lakshan jeevon ko apni paristhitiyon ke zyada anukulit banaate hai, agali pidiyon main wo zyada saamaanya ho jate hai
 These differences keep increasing gradually
 aaj dekhi jane vaali jeev vividhta ke liye yahi prakriya jimmedaar he
 Most genetic mutations provide no support to individuals, do not alter their appearance nor harm them
 genetic drift ke madhyam se ye nishpaksh genetic utparivartan keval sanyog se aabaadiyon main sthapit ho jate hai or bahut pidiyon tak jivit rahete hai
 In contrast, natural selection is not a random process because it protects the traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction
 prakritik varan or genetic drift jivan ke nity or gatisheel ang hai
 These processes have formed branches of the family tree of life over billions of years
 kram-vikaas kii aadhunik soch 1859 main prakashit charles darwin kii kitaab jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav se shuru hui
 In addition, studies by Gregor Mendel on plants helped to understand genetics
 jeevashmon kii khoj, jansankhya anuvanshiki main pragati or vaigyanik anusandhan ke vaishvik natwork ne kram-vikaas kii kriyavidhi kii or adhik vistrut jaankaree pradaan kii he
 Scientists now have a greater understanding of the origin of new castes and they have now observed the process of speciation in laboratory and nature
 kram-vikaas vah mul vaigyanik siddhant he jise jeevvaigyanik jivan ko samajhane ke liye prayog karte hai
 It is used in many disciplines such as medicine, psychology, bio-conservation, anthropology, forensic science, agriculture and other socio-cultural subjects
 kram-vikaas ke mukhya vichaar sankshep main nimnlikhit hai: Museums of natural history were very popular in the 19th century
 is dauraan europea khojayatraayen or nausena ke abhiyaan bade sangrahalayon ke prakritik vaigyanikon or sangrahadhyakshon ko saath le jate the
 Charles Darwin was a graduate educated and trained in the subject of natural history science
 unke jaise prakritik itihaaskaar sangrahalayon ke liye namoonon ko ikattha karte the, unki soochi banaate the, unka varnan or adhyayan karte the
 Darwin was working as a natural scientist on a ship called HMS Beagle
 unhen duniya bhar kii paanch varsh kii anusandhan yatra kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 During his travels he collected samples of many organisms and inspected them
 unhen dakshini america ke taton or nazadiiki gailapagos dweepasmooh ke vividh jeevon main khaas dilchaspee thi
 Darwin gained extensive experience collecting and studying specimens from far off places
 apane in adhyayanon se unhone yah vichaar pesh kiya ki har jati apane jaise lakshanon vaale purvajon se viksit hui he
 In 1938 he explained how this could be a natural process
 unhone is prakritik prakriya ko prakritik varan kaa naam diya
 The size of a population depends on the amount of resources present in its environment
 varshon tak aabaadi kaa aakaar sthir bana rahane ke liye aabaadi ke aakaar or uplabdh sansadhano main santulan bana rahanaa jaruri he
 More offspring are born than the environment the offspring can shelter
 iske kaaran kisi bhi peedi ke sabhi shaks jivit nahin rah sakate hai
 Therefore, there is always a competitive struggle for the resources necessary for survival
 is se darwin ko ehsaas hua kii uttarjivan keval sanyog par nirbhar nahin karata he
 He realized that survival depends on the individual's differences, or "traits"
 kuch lakshan shakson kii uttarjivita main sahaayta karte hai or kuch usamen baadha daalate hai
 The more customized personas of the environment give more children to the next generation than their less adapted rivals
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main baadha daalate hai wo kuch pidiyon ke baad lupt ho jate hai
 The traits that help in survival and reproduction accumulate from generation to generation
 is prakaar shakson kii uttarjivan or prajnan kii asmaan kshamta ke kaaran dhire-dhire aabaadiyon main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Observations of differences in animals and plants became the basis of the theory of natural selection
 darwin ne dekha ki orchidon or kiton main ek khaas saajhedaari hoti he jo padpon ke paragan main madad karti he
 He observed that orchids have many structures that attract insects, so that the pollen of the flowers sticks to their bodies
 is prakaar se kit ek nar orchid se ek maadaa orchid tak paraag dhote hai
 Despite the intricate appearance of the orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that other flowers form
 apni pustak orchidon kaa nishechan main darwin prastaavit karte hai ki orchid pushp pehle se maujuud pushp bhaagon se prakritik varan kii prakriya ke dwaara parivesh ke zyada anukulit bane hai
 Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas that he received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace
 is chitthee main vailes ne darwin ke siddhant ke jaise ek siddhant kaa varnan kiya tha
 Due to this both of them jointly published these principles
 vailes or darwin donon jivan ke itihaas ko ek vansh vriksh kii tarah dekhte the, jisamen shakhaon kii nok aaj kii jatiyon ko darshaati he or shakhaon ke vibhajit hone kii jagah ek saajhe purvaj ko
 Darwin said that living things are relatives
 iskaa matlab tha ki sara jivan thode se saral purvajon se utpann hua he
 And it was also likely that all organisms had the same ancestor
 darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas ke apane siddhant ko 1859 main apni pustak jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 His theory means that all organisms, including humans, are the byproduct of continuous natural processes
 iske kaaran kuch dharmik guton ne kram-vikaas ke siddhant par aapatti uthaai he
 In contrast, more than 99 percent of the people in the scientific community support this theory
 aksar prakritik varan ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita kaa paryaay samajha jaataa he, par ye abhivyakti 1864 main prakashit harbart spencer kii pustak jeevigyaan ke siddhant se janmi he, jo darwin kii kitaab ke paanch varsh baad prakashit hui thi
 Survival of the fittest misunderstands the process of natural selection because natural selection is not just about survival and not always the healthiest
 darwin ke prakritik varan ke siddhant ne kram-vikaas ke aadhunik siddhant kii neenv rakhi
 Their research and observations have shown that individuals in a population differ from each other, some of these differences are from parents, and natural selection chooses and discards these differences
 par ve in bhinnataaon kaa kaaran nahin bataa sake
 Like biologists before them they continued to understand that genetic traits were the cause of use or non-use, and that the traits that were ingested over their lifetimes could be passed on to their children
 unhone iske udhaaharan khojane kii koshish kii
 They thought that the legs of large flightless birds like the ostrich would have been overly powerful from generation to generation, and their wings would have been weakened from generation to generation due to less flying
 is galatarahami ko "adhigrahit lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta" kaha jaataa tha jo ki jin baptist lamark dwaara 1809 main prastaavit siddhant "jatiyon kaa parivartan" kaa bhaag thi
 At the end of the 19th century this theory was called Lamarckism
 darwin ne jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta samajhane ke liye pangenesis naam kaa ek asafal siddhant prastaavit kiya
 The experiments of August Weissmann in the 1880s showed that the symptoms acquired during their lifetimes could not be passed on to children
 iske kaaran kuch samay main lamarkwaad ko tyaag diya gaya
 How new traits are given to parents by offspring is answered by Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on genetics
 matar ke paudhon kii kai pidiyon par kiye gaye unke prayogon ne sabit kiya ki mata or pita main sex koshikaon ke gathan ke samay anuvaanshik jaankaree vibhajit ho jaati he or nishechan ke samay mata or pita se mili jaankaree yadrichhik dhang se jud jaati he
 This can be compared to playing cards where an organism gets half its leaves at random from the mother and the other half at random from the father
 mendal ne is jaankaree ko factors kaha, par baad main jin naam zyada prachlit ho gaya
 Genes are the basic unit of genetics
 inamen vah jaankaree hoti he jo jeev ke shaareerik vikaas or vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti he
 Genes are made of DNA
 diene ek lanbaa anu he jo newcliotide kehalaae jane vaale chote anuon se banataa he
 Genetic information is stored in DNA as a series of nucleotides
 diene kii tulana ek lekh se kii ja sakati he jisamen newcliotide varnon kaa kaam karte hai
 Just as an article composed of a series of characters stores information, DNA composed of a series of nucleotides stores genetic information
 jin diene kii varnmaala ke varnon se bane nirdesh hote hai
 All genes come together like an "instruction manual" which contains all the information about making and functioning an organism
 diene main likhe gaye in nirdeshon kaa utparivartan ke kaaran badalanaa aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the capillaries
 nishechan ke samay mata-pita se mili chromosomon ke yadrichhik mishran se santan ko jeenon kaa adwitiya sangyojan miltaa he
 This random mixing of genes during sexual reproduction also increases the genetic variation of the population
 aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata kisi duusari aabaadi ke saath prajnan karne se bhi badhati he
 For this reason, the population may have genes which were not already present in it
 kram-vikaas ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he
 Although mutations in DNA occur randomly, natural selection is not a random process, the probability of survival and reproduction depends on the environment
 kram-vikaas arabon varshon ke trutipurna pratilipikaran par prakritik varan kaa parinaam he
 The result of evolution is not a well-formed organism
 prakritik varan kaa parinaam apane maujuuda parivesh ke anukulit jeev hote hai
 Progress is not progress towards any ultimate goal
 kram-vikaas zyada viksit, zyada budhimaan yaa zyada jatil jeev banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he
 For example, the flea scorpion is a descendant of a winged creature called a fly, and pythons still have small structures that are remnants of their ancestors' hind legs
 parivesh main teevr parivartan aam taur par adhiktam jatiyon ko vilupt kar detaa he
 More than 99 percent of the castes on the earth have become extinct
 prithvi par jivan kii shruwaat ke baad se paanch pramukh samuhik viluptiyaan ho chuki hai
 Due to these there has been a big and sudden decline in the diversity of castes
 in main sabase tazaa kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana he, jo 6
6 karod varsh purv hui thi
 Genetic drift refers to the change in the frequency of alleles in the populations of a caste
 elil kisi jin ke vibhinn roopantaron ko kehete hai
 They determine hair color, skin color, eye color, blood type etc
 genetic drift aabaadi main nae elil nahin laati he, par ye kisi elil ko aabaadi se hataa kar genetic vividhta ko kam kar sakati he
 Genetic drift occurs by random selection of alleles
 chayan sahi myne main yadrichhik tab hota he jab us par koi bahari bal prabhaav nahin daalata he
 For example, a random selection is to remove some marbles from an opaque bag filled with marbles of different colors at the same measurement and weight
 koi shaks apane elil apane bacchon ko de paaegaa yaa nahin, ye uske jivit rahane par nirbhar karata he jisamen sanyog bhi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This process of changing the frequency of alleles in the population due to coincidence is called genetic drift
 genetic drift badi aabaadiyon kii tulana main choti aabaadiyon par zyada prabhaav daalati he
 The Hardy – Weinberg rule states that the frequency of alleles will not change over generations in a large population occurring in the Hardy – Weinberg society
 magar ek paryaapt aakaar kii aabaadi kaa is samyavastha main pahunchnaa asambhav he kyonki is samyavastha main pahunchane ke liye ye paanch chijen jaruri hai
 1) The population size should be infinite
 2) utparivartan kii dar shunya pratishat honi chahie, kyonki utparivartan eleelon ko badal saktaa he yaa nae elil bana saktaa he
 3) There should not be migration from or into the population, as individuals coming into or leaving the population can change the frequency of alleles
 4) aabaadi par koi chaynaatmak dabaav nahin hone chahie, arthath kisi shaks ke uttarjivan yaa prajnan kii sambhaavna dusron se zyada nahin honi chahie
 5) The intercourse should be completely random, where all males are equally attractive mates
 yah alilon kii sahi myne main yadrichhik milawat sunishchit karata he
 The population in the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium corresponds to a deck of cards; Regardless of the number of times the deck is thrown, there will be no new leaf and no leaf will come out
 yahan aabaadi main eleelon kii tulana deck ke patton se kii gai he
 Population Bottlenac refers to the rapid decline of a race's population due to environmental events
 ek sahi myne main yadrichhik aabaadi bottlenake kisi elil kaa paksh nahin letaa he; arthath yah yadrichhik hota he ki koun se shaks jivit rahenge
 a bottleneck can reduce or eliminate the genetic diversity of a population
 iske baad kii genetic drift aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko or kam kar sakati he
 Lack of genetic diversity may place populations at risk of other selective pressures
 aabaadi bottlenake kaa ek udhaaharan "uttari eliphant jalavyaghr" he
 The population of the Northern Elephant Sea was reduced by thirty persons due to the excessive hunting of the 19th
 sangrakshan ke kaaran in kii aabaadi ek lakh se zyada ho gai he or lagaataar bad rahi he
 The effects of bottleneck on the population are clearly visible
 aabaadi main genetic vividhta ke abhaav main in jalavyaghron ko rogon se kaaphi khatra he or anuvanshiki vikaar hone kii bahut sambhaavna he
 The founder's influence occurs when a small group of populations diverge from the rest of the population to form a new population
 aksar iskaa kaaran bhugolic algaav hota he
 The frequency of alleles in this new population is often different from that of the old population
 agali pidiyon kii genetic banaavat sansthaapakon kii genetic banaavat par nirbhar karegi jo puraani aabaadi se alag hogi
 An example of the founder's influence is found in the 1744 Pennsylvania transfusion of the Amish people
 amishon kii pencilvenia kii colony ke do sansthaapakon main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan ke risasive elil the
 Due to the practice of Amish people not marrying outside their community for many generations, the frequency of Ellis-van Kreveld syndrome among them is much higher than the rest of the population

 Durga Bhabhi was a major collaborator of revolutionaries in India's freedom struggle
 18 disambar 1928 ko bhagat singh ne inhi durga bhabhi ke saath vesh badal kar kalakatta-mail se yatra kii thi
 Durga Bhabhi was the wife of the revolutionary Bhagwati Charan Bohra
 durga bhabhi kaa janm saat oktober 1902 ko shahjadpur gram ab kaushambi jila main pandit banke bihari ke yahaan hua
 His father was a Nazir in the Allahabad Collectorate and his Baba Mahesh Prasad Bhatt was posted as a Thanedar in Jalaun district
 inke dada pan shivashankar shahjadpur main jameendaar the jinhone bachapan se hi durga bhabhi ke sabhi baton ko purna karte the
 At the young age of ten, he was married to Bhagwati Charan Bohra of Lahore
 inke sasur shivacharan ji railway main oonche pad par tainaat the
 The British government gave him the title of Rai Sahab
 bhagwati charan bohara raay sahab kaa putr hone ke baavjood angrejon kii daastaa se desh ko mukt karana chaahate the
 He was the propaganda secretary of the revolutionary organization
 varsh 1920 main pita ji kii mrityu ke pashchaat bhagwati charan vohara khulkar kranti main aa gaye or unki patni durga bhabhi ne bhi purna rup se sahyog kiya
 In 1923, Bhagwati Charan Vohra passed the National College BA examination and Durga Bhabhi obtained Prabhakar's degree
 durga bhabhi kaa maayka va sasuraal donon paksh sampann tha
 Father-in-law Shivcharan ji gave 40 thousand rupees to Durga Bhabhi and five thousand rupees by Father Banke Bihari to come to work in the days of crisis, but this couple used these money with the revolutionaries to liberate the country
 march 1926 main bhagwati charan vohara va bhagat singh ne sanyukt rup se noujvaan bharat sabha kaa praaroop taiyaar kiya or ramchandra kapur ke saath milakar isaki sthapana kii
 Hundreds of youths took an oath to sacrifice their lives on the altar to liberate the country
 bhagat singh va bhagwati charan vohara sahit sadasyon ne apane rakt se pratigya patr par hastakshar kiye
 On 28 May 1930, Vohra ji was martyred while conducting tests after making a bomb with his companions on the banks of river Ravi
 unke shahid hone ke baavjood durga bhabhi saathi krantikariyon ke saath sakriy raheen
 On 9 October 1930, Durga Bhabhi fired on Governor Hailey, in which Governor Hailey survived but military officer Taylor was injured
 mumbai ke police kamishnar ko bhi durga bhabhi ne goli maari thi jiske parinaam swaroop angrej police inke peeche pad gai
 Durga Bhabhi and partner Yashpal were arrested from a flat in Mumbai
 durga bhabhi kaa kaam saathi krantikariyon ke liye rajasthan se pistaul laana va le janaa tha
 Chandra Shekhar Azad, while fighting the British, shot the pistol with which Durga Bhabhi brought it to him
 us samay bhi durga bhabhi unke saath hi thim
 He took pistol training in Lahore and Kanpur
 bhagat singh va batukeshwar dutt jab kendriya assembly main bam phenkane jane lage to durga bhabhi va sushila mohan ne apni baanhen kaat kar apane rakt se donon logon ko tilak lagaakar vidaa kiya tha
 After throwing bombs in the assembly, these people were arrested and hanged
 saathi krantikariyon ke shahid ho jane ke baad durga bhabhi ekadam akeli pad gai
 She daringly moved to Delhi with the aim of arranging for her five-year-old son, Shachindra
 jahaan par police unhen baraabar pareshaan karti raheen
 Durga Bhabhi then moved from Delhi to Lahore, where the police arrested her and kept her under arrest for three years
 faraari, giraftaar va rihaai kaa yah silsilaa 1931 se 1935 tak chalata rahaa
 Finally after being raised from Lahore, in 1935 Pyarelal Kanya Vidyalaya in Ghaziabad started working as a teacher and after some time she moved to Delhi again and started working in Congress
 congress kaa jivan raas na aane ke kaaran unhone 1937 main chhod diya
 In 1939, he went to Madras and trained in the Montessori method from Maria Montessori and in 1940 opened a Montessori school with only five children in a private house on Cantt Road in Lucknow
 aaj bhi yah vidhyalay lakhanu main maantesri inter kalege ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 On October 14, 1999, in Ghaziabad, he broke off his ties and retired from this world

 Digital electronics or digital electronics is a branch of electronics in which electrical signals are numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc
 are the product of digital electronics
 ankiy electronic, yaa sookshmadvik aankik paddati aisi pranali he jo vidyut sanketon ko, rekhiy str ke ek nirantar pattiyon ke bajaae ek alag alag pattiyon kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main darshaati he
 All levels in this stripe indicate the same state of signals
 sanketo kii is pruthakta kii vajah se nirmaan sahansheeltaa ke kaadan rekhiy sanketo ke str main aaye apekshaakrit chote badlaav alag aavaran nahin chhodte he
 As a result, the circuit sensing the state of the signals ignores them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main sanketo kii avasthaa kii sankhya do hoti he or in do avasthaaon ko do voltage staron dwaara darshaya jaataa he: prayog main aapurti voltage ke aadhaar par ek va doosraa | 1 ucch str par hota he va 0 nimna str par
 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"
 aankik takanic kaa mul laabh is tathy par aadhaarit he ki sanketo kii ek satat shrinkhalaa ko punarutpaadit karne ke bajaae, electronic upkaran ko sanketo kii 0 yaa 1 jaise kisi gyaat avasthaa main bhejnaa zyada aasaan hota he
 Digital electronics are generally made up of large combinations of logic gates and simple electronics of Boolean logic functions
 rekhiy paripath kii tulana main aankik paripath ko istemaal karne kii vajah iskaa ek laabh yah he ki shor ke kaaran sanketo kaa vighatan nahin hota he va unhen aasaani se bheja or darshaya ja saktaa he
 For example, a signal of a long sound made in the order of 1 and 0 can be reconstructed without error provided that the noise produced during the making of the signal is not so much that 1 and 0 cannot be detected
 
 sidi main ek ghante ke sangeet ko kareeb 60 lakh dwiadhari ankon ke rup main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, more binary digits can be used to represent a more accurate signal
 haalanki is prakriya ke liye isamen adhik aankik paripath kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki prayek ank ek hi prakaar ke hardware dwaara sambhala jaataa he natijatan ek aasaan maapneey tantra kaa nirmaan ho jaataa he
 An analog system requires a basic improvement in additional resolution linearity and a basic improvement in the noise characteristics of each phase of the signal chain
 computer niyantrit digital system ko software dwaara niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki hardware ko badale bina nae function ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 And often this can be done outside the factory with the updated product software
 jisase utpaada ke dizin kii trutiyon ko graahak ke haath main utpaada ke aane ke baad sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Storage of information can be done easily in digital system as compared to analog
 digital system kaa shor pratiraksha vighatan ke bina data ko sangrahit or punah praapt karne kii anumati detaa he
 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station
 haalanki ek base stesan ke paas grid kii shakti hoti he or apekshit vidyut kaa prayog kar sakati he, lekin bahut lacheele software radio main
 is tarah ke base steshnon ke liye aasaani se nae cellular maanakon main prayukt sanket prakriya ko aasaani se riprogram kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal
 kuch pranaaliyon main yadi digital data kaa ek bhaag lupt ho jaae yaa galat tareeke se vyavahrut hon, to sambandhit data ke vishaal khandon kaa arth puri tarah se badal saktaa he
 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he
 State transition logic in a state machine can be designed to hold unused state and trigger a reset sequence or other routine error recovery
 ambeded software dizin immunity aware programing kaa prayog karata he, jaise avrodh nirdesh ke saath aprayukt kaarykram smriti ke rup main bharne kaa prayaas karata he jo truti ke punah prapti kaarykram kii ore sanket detaa he
 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable
 ye takanic tabhi sweekaarya hote hai jab antarnihit bits un trutiyon ke nahin hone kii sambhaavna se kaaphi vishwasaneey hote hai
 Digital circuits are composed of analog components
 iske dizin se sunishchit hona chahie ki analog ghatakon ke lakshan icchit digital vyavhaar par haaavee naa hon
 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates
 aksar logic gates unke aakaar, bijli kii khapat or laagat ko kam karne or unki vishwasaneeyata kii vruddhi karne ke liye sabase kam sankhya main transistor kaa upyog karata he
 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates
 aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar ekikrut circuit kaa dizin kiya hota he 
 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement
 isliye choti maatra main utpaada programeble logic divaais aksar adhimaanya samaadhaan kar rahe hai
 They are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 jab sanskaran madhyam se bade hote hai or tark dhime ho sakate hai yaa jatil elgoritham yaa anukram shaamil kiye jate hai, tab aksar ambeded pranali banane ke liye ek chota-se microcontrolar ko program kiya jaataa he
 These are usually programmed by software engineers
 jab keval ek digital circuit kii aavashyaktaa ho or isaki dizin puri tarah se customiod ho, tab fectory production line controlar ke liye paaramparik samaadhaan programeble logic controlar yaa PLC he
 These are typically programmed by electricians using logic ladders
 logic kriyaaon ko kam karne ke liye ejeeniyar kai tareekon ko apanaate hai, taaki circuit kii jatilta ko kam kiya ja sake
 When complexity is low, circuit errors and electronics are also less and hence they are less expensive
 ek CAD pranali ke bheetar aspreso hiuristic logic minumaizar kii tarah ek nunatam elgorithm sabase vyapak rup se istemaal kiya gaya sarleekaran he haalanki aitihaasik rup se dwiadhari nirnay rekhachitr ek swachaalit quine-mccluskey elgorithm, truth teble, karnog maanchitr or bulian bijganit kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate
 tathaapi, atulykaalik tark ko behatar samajha jaataa he, yadi usase kaam nikaala ja sake to, kyonki uski gati ghadi dwaara manamaane dhang se gati simit nahin he, bajaay, yah un logic geton dwaara anumat gati par saamaanya rup se chalati he, jinase inkaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used
 iske liye kuch apekshaakrit saral tulykaalan circuit kii aavashyaktaa he
 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer
 yah multah ek swat: binary abekas he
 The control unit of a computer is typically designed as a micro program run by a microsensor
 yah micro program ek player-piano role kii tarah hoti he
 Each table commands every bit of entry or "word" state of the micro program that controls the computer
 anukramak phir use ginati karata he or memory yaa sangyojan logic mashin main yah ginati sambodhit karata he jisamen micro program samahit hota he
 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system
 kai computer architech microprogrammers ke rup main vistrut prashikshuta kii seva de rahe hai
 "typical computers" are typically a traditional computer with a special purpose micro program
 mahange ejineering prayaason se bachane ke liye, badi logic mashiinon ke dizine banane ke prayaas kaaphi kuch swachaalit kar die gaye hai
 Computer programs are called "electronic design automation devices" or simply "EDA"
 logic kaa, saral truth teble-style kaa vivaran, aksar EDA ke saath ishtatam kiya jaataa he jo logic get kii ghatit pranaaliyon ko swatah utpaadit karata he yaa chote lukup teble ko, jo abhi bhi vaanchit parinaam dete hai
 The most common example of this type of software is the espresso heuristic logic minimizer
 vishaal logic pranaliyon ke anukulan ke liye adhikansh vyaavhaarik elgoridam, bijiy jodtod yaa dwiadhari nirnay aarekh kaa upyog karte hai or anuvanshik kalan vidhi or tapiya anukulan ke saath prayog, sambhaavna se bhare hai
 To automate costly engineering processes, some edas can take state tables that describe a state machine and can produce a truth table or a function table for a mixed part of a state machine
 state teble paath kaa ek tukdaa he jo prayek state ko paristhitiyon ke saath soochibaddh karata he, jo unke or sambandhit utpaadan sanketon ke bich sankraman ko niyantrit karata he
 It is common for function tables of such computer generated state machines to be optimized with the logic minimization software Minelog
 aksar, vaastavik logic pranaliyaan, up-pariyojnaon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main dizin kii gai hoti hai, jinhen ek "upkaran pravaah" ke upyog se sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 The tool flow is usually a "script", a simple computer language that can implement software design tools in the correct order
 bade logic system ke liye upkaran pravaah, jaise microprocesar, hajaaron cmand lambey ho sakate hai or saikadon ejiniyaron ke kaam ko sanyojit karte hai
 Writing and debugging equipment flow is an established engineering specialty in companies producing digital design
 upkaran pravaah aam taur par ek vistrut computer fil yaa filon ke set main mit jaataa he jo yah varnan karata he ki kaise logic kaa bhautik rup se nirmaan karen
 This often includes transistor and wire drawing instructions on an integrated circuit or printed circuit board
 upkaran pravaah ke hisson ko, apekshit input ke khilaaf nakli logic ke output kii pushti karne ke dwaara dibag kiya jaataa he
 Testing equipment takes computer files with a set of inputs and outputs and highlights discrepancies between simulated behavior and expected behavior
 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan vector ko sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he or kaarkaane main yah pareekshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit logic sahi dhang se kaam karata he yaa nahin
 Functional test patterns, however, do not discover common construction mistakes
 Production tests, often designed by software tools, are called "test pattern generators"
 logic kii sanrachana kii jaanch or vyavasthit dhang se vishesh dosha ke liye test janit kar, ye pareekshan vector ko utpann karte hai
 In this way fault coverage can reach around 100%, provided the design is properly testable
 ek baar koi dizine maujuud he or satyapit or pareekshan yogya he, to ise utpaadit yogya hone ke liye aksar sansaadhit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In modern integrated circuits, the wavelength of light used to illuminate photoresistance has smaller characteristics
 utpaadakta software, expozar mask main mukt-paripath ko samaapt karne ke liye hastkshep pattern jodate hai or mask ke rizolution or contrast main vruddhi karte hai
 a large logic machine can have an astronomical number of possible states
 jaahir he, kaarkaane main, har state kaa pareekshan avyaavhaarik he agar har state ke pareekshan main ek microsecond lagata he or brahmad ke shuru hone se hi microsecond kii sankhya se kahin adhik state hai
 Unfortunately, this ridiculous case is typical
 saubhaahgya se, badi logic mashiinon ko lagbhag hameshaa chote logic mashiinon ke sangyojan ke rup main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To save time, small sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for Test" circuitry and tested independently
 "scan dizin" naam kii ek aam pareekshan yojana, test bits ko kramik rup se ek yaa ek se adhik "scan chen" naam ke kramik shift register ke madhyam se hataati he
 In sequential scans, there are only one or two wires to carry the data and reduce the physical size and expenses of the frequently used test logic
 saare pareekshan ke baad, data bits jagah par hai, dizine ko "saamaanya mod" ke liye rikanfigure kiya jaataa he or ek yaa ek se adhik clock pulse ko lagu kiya jaataa hai, taaki dosha kaa pataa lag sake or pareekshan ke parinaam kaa pragrahan scan shift register main flip-flop main or / yaa leches main kiya jaataa he
 Finally, the test result is shifted to the block boundary and the forecast is compared against the "good machine" result
 ek board test paryaavaran main samanaantar testing ke kram ko, ek maanak "JTAG" ke saath aupchaarik rup diya gaya he 
 Another common test scheme provides a test mode that forces parts of the logic machine to enter a "probe cycle"
 pareekshan chakra, aam taur par mashin ke bade swatantra bhaagon kaa prayog karata he
 The practicality of a system of digital logic determines many things
 fainout, gati, kam laagat or vishwasaneeyata kaa ek adarsh sangyojan praapt karne ke liye, ejiniyaron ne kai electronic upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya
 The cost of a logic gate is significant
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik digital logic system, telephone riley se banaae jate the kyonki ye saste or apekshaakrit vishwasaneey the
 After that, engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switch, which could still meet the requirements
 praarambhik ekikrut paripath ek aanandadaayak sanyog the
 They were not built to save money, but to save weight, and to allow the Apollo Guidance computer to control a spacecraft an internal guidance system
 pehla ekikrut paripath logic get kii keemat kareeb $50 thi 
 Surprising everyone, when circuits began to be produced in bulk, they became the cheapest method of manufacturing digital logic
 is praudyogiki main sudhaar ne laagat main sabhi baad ke sudhaaron ko prerit kiya
 With the increase of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used introduced another way of saving costs
 ek diziner kaa lakshya sirf aasaan circuit bananaa nahin he, balki ghatak kii ginati kam rakhana he
 Sometimes this results in a slightly more complex design with respect to the underlying digital logic, but still reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch logic pariwaron main, NAND get, nirmaan hone vaale saralatam digital get hai
 All other logic operations can be implemented by the NAND gate
 yadi ek circuit ko pehle se hi ek NAND get kii aavashyaktaa he or ek ekal chip aam taur par chaar NAND get rakhata he, to baaki ke get ko anya logic karravaiyon ko jaise logical and lagu karne ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 This can eliminate the need for a chip with those different types of gate
 ek logic get kii "vishwasaneeyata", asafalataa ke bich uske ausat samay kaa varnan karti he
 Digital machines often have millions of logic gates
 iske alaava, adhikansh digital mashiinon ko unki laagat ko kam karne ke liye "anukulit" kiya jaataa he
 The result is clear, failure of a single logic gate will cause a digital machine to stop working
 digital mashine, pehali baar upyogi tab baniin jab ek switch ke liye MTBF kuch sau ghante se upar ho gaya
 Nevertheless, many of these machines had complications, well-practiced repair procedures, and did not work for many hours due to a tube burning or an insect getting stuck in a relay

 diazo yogic ek prakaar ke carbonic yogic hai jinamein do linkit nitrogen parmaanu function samooh ke rup main hote hai
 Its general formula is R2C = N2
 diajomethane ek saralatam diajo-yogic he
 German chemist Peter Grice first discovered aromatic diazo compounds in 1858 AD
 ve arometic praathmik amino yogicon par nitras amla kaa adhyayan kar rahe the
 He observed that if the temperature of the reaction is kept at or around zero C, then the primary amino nitrous acid does not form a new compound, which is not formed by aliphatic amino compounds
 is nae yogic ko unhone "diazo" sangya di or is kriya ko unhone diazotikaran naam diya
 The compounds formed by this action are called diazonium compounds
 ye yogic kuch gunon main ammonium yogicon se samanta rakhte hai
 By dissolving the primary aromatic amine in excess of a mineral acid, its temperature is reduced to 50 ° c by adding sodium nitrite solution, which forms a diazo compound, which is soluble in water
 pani ke sthaan main yadi ethil alcohol kaa upyog ho to diazo yogic kaa thos avakshep praapt ho saktaa he
 Aqueous solution can also give precipitate of a solid compound by ether
 isaki abhikriyaaon ke adhyayan ke liye jaleey vilyan paryaapt he
 Diazo compounds are formed as a colorless solid crystal
 ye jal main bahut viley, par ether or alcohol main alp viley hote hai
 They are very temporary
 garam karne yaa aghat se bade jor se visphotit hote hai
 Similar to ammonium salts, they form salts from acids and form double salts from chlorides of metals
 diazo yogic rasayanat: bade sakriy hote hai
 Many types of compounds can be prepared by their reactions
 inamen sabase adhik mahatv ke padaarth kritrim ranjak hai, jinka nirmaan aaj bahut bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Below, for example, benzene diazonium chloride is used to demonstrate their reactions: 1
 shuddh alcohol ke saath ise ubaalane se diazo samooh kaa sthaan hydrogen le letaa he : c6h5n2cl + C2H5OH -> C6H6 + N2 + CH3 CHO 2
 kuprus chloride ke hydrochloric amla main vilyan ke saath garam karne se chlorobanzeen praapt hota he
 Similarly, treatment with cuprous bromide and cuprous cyanide yields bromobenzene and benzene cyanide, respectively
 ise "sandmair abhikriya" kehete hai
 Treatment with copper powder also gives benzene chloride, bromide and cyanide
 ise "gaterman abhikriya kehete hai
 3
 The diazo group is replaced by the hydroxyl group by heating with water
 is prakaar is abhikriya ke dwaara phenol taiyaar ho sakate hai
 c6h5n2cl + HOH -> C6H5OH + N2 + hcl 4
 ajal aluminium chloride kii upasthiti main benzin ke saath abhikriya se diazo samooh kaa sthaan fenil samooh le letaa he
 c6h5n2cl + C6H6 -> C6H5
C6H5 + N2 + hcl 5
 stans chloride or hydrochloric amla ke upachaar se diazo samooh kaa avkaran hokar hydrazin yogic banate hai
 c6h5n2cl + 4H -> C6H5NH NH2 + hcl 6
 diadonium lavenon kaa kshareey avasthaa main phenol, yaa tritiyak amin, dwaara upachaar karne se amleey yaa samaakshareey pile, laal yaa bhure rang ke ranjak banate hai
 c6h5n2cl + C6H5OH -> C6H5N2
C6H4
OH + hcl c6h5n2cl + C6H5N2 --> C6H5N2C6H4N2 + hcl The above reactions are called coupling reactions
 arometic shrenee ke praaia: sabhi praathmik amino yogicon se diazotikaran abhikriyaayein hoti hai
 The formula that Blomstrand proposed regarding the composition of aromatic diazo compounds is still accepted today
 benzin diazochloride kaa sutara, jisamen ek nitrogen parmaanu trisanyojak or doosraa parmaanu panchasanyojak he, is prakaar kaa he: Only a few diazo compounds in the aliphatic category are known and are prepared by special methods
 aise yogico main diazomethen tathaa diazo aseetic aster adhik mahatv ke hai
 The first is a yellow odorless, toxic gas and the second is a thick, yellow liquid similar to oil
