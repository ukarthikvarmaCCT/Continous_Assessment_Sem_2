 visheshkar dispojable narm lainson se samasyaayein utpann ho sakati hai – yadi lens or ungali ke bich sataha kaa tanaav bahut adhik ho, to lens ulta ho saktaa he, yaa vah doharaa ho saktaa he
 When the lens first makes contact with the eye, the eye may feel irritated for a short time until it becomes habitual or due to the dust on the lens
 aise samay aankh ko dhone se laabh ho saktaa he lekin yah ek minute se adhik nahin karnaa chaiye
 It is to be noted that although in some contact lenses it is easy to know that you have reversed the lens, you can find out the exact position of the lens beforehand
 iske liye lens ko apni ungali ke sire par rakh kar apane duusare haath kii do ungaliyon se uske nichle bhaag ko nichodna chaiye – aapako sahi sthiti gyaat ho jaaegi yadi lens ke sire kisi taco kii tarah bheetar kii ore mud gai hon
 yadi ve baahar kii ore mud jaaen to aapako lens ko flip karne kii jarurat padegi
 lekin kuch tarah ke laison main yah kathin hota he kyonki ve donon ore se samaan dikhte hai
 Even after applying several lenses in the eye, it is difficult to tell that they have been turned upside down
 aisa isaliye hota he kyonki in lainson ke donon taraf se najar va anubhuti samaan hoti he
 Because of this, many people try to identify their contact lenses from the first day on both sides so that when they feel that the lens is turned upside down, they can always apply it properly
 Lenses should never be worn upside down even if they look comfortable and do not have a clear look
 narm las ko aankh kii palkon ko pakad kar khulaa rakh kar or lens ko do ungaliyon se pakad kar nikaala jaataa he
 This method can cause irritation, injury to the eye, and sometimes it can be difficult to blink the eyelid
 yadi lens ko cornia par se dhakel diya jaay to yah mud saktaa he, jisase ise saralata se pakadaa ja saktaa he
 As an alternative, once the lens is moved from the cornea to the inner corner of the eye, it can be pulled out by pressing the upper eyelid downwards with the finger
 is tareeke main aankh ko ungaliyon se chune kaa jokham kam ho jaataa he or lambey nakhunon vaale logon ke liye aasaan tarika he
 Hardened contact lenses can be pulled out by weakening the adhesion of the lens by pulling it with a finger on the outer corner and then blinking
 duusare haath ko lens ko pakadaney ke liye aankh ke neeche pyaale kii tarah rakhaa jaataa he
 There are also some small devices available to remove the lens, which are similar to small ones made of flexible plastic
 avatal sire ko uthaakar aankh tak le jaaya jaataa he or lens ko chuaa jaataa he, jisase lens or cornia ke bich kii sil se adhik majboot sil ban jaati he or lens aankh ke baahar nikal jaataa he
 Although daily disposable lenses are not required to be cleaned, other types require regular cleaning and disinfecting in order to appear clean and cause discomfort and infections arising from many microorganisms, including biofilm-forming bacteria, fungi, and acantheba on the surface of the lens
 Can be prevented

 Some products should only be used with certain types of contact lenses
 yah aavashyak he ki utpaadan ke label kii is baat ke liye jaanch kar lee jaay ki use kis prakaar ke lens ke saath istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Only water should not be used to clean the contact lens because water cannot completely disinfect the lens
 Using water to clean the contact lens can contaminate the lens and sometimes it can cause undesirable damage to the eye
 aankh ke sankraman yaa kshobh se bachaav ke liye utpaadan ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Also, do not forget to thoroughly wash the contact compartments or lenses with water or multipurpose solution or hydrogen peroxide so that biofilms are not formed on its surfaces
 yah nishchit karnaa jaruri he ki utpaadan sookshmjeevanuon se dooshit na ho
 The ends of the characters of these solutions should never come in contact with any surface and the container should be kept closed when not in use

 It is generally believed by physicians that the biggest problem with the use of contact lenses is bacteriogenic keratitis and the most common microorganism is Pseudomonas aeruginoza
 anya jeevanu bhi kantact lens ko pahanane se sambandhit bacterial keretitis kaa mukhya kaaran hote hai, haalanki unki vyapaktaa bhinn sthanon par bhinn hoti he
 These include the staphylococcal species and the streptococcal species, among other castes
 vartmaan shodh main sookshmjeevanujnya keretitis iske aankh par hone vaale andhepan sahit bhayankar prabhaav ke kaaran ek gambhir kendra bindu he
 a particularly interesting subject of research is knowing how microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginoza penetrate and infect the eye

 Some researchers have shown that oxygen deficiency in the cornea promotes coincidence with the corneal epithelium of Pseudomonas, the internalization of microorganisms and the onset of the inflammatory process
 alpaxiyata ko kam karne kaa ek tarika cornia ko praapt oxygen kii maatra ko badhanaa he
 Although silicon-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia due to their very high oxygen permeability, they also appear to provide a more effective condition for bacterial contamination and corneal translocation than traditional hydrogel soft contact lenses
 haal ke ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki sudomonas airuginoja or staphilokacal epidermis parmparik hydrogel kantact lainson kii apeksha silicon hydrogel kantact lainson se adhik majbootee se chipakate hai or sudomonas airuginoja kaa aasanjan staphilokacas epididermis se 20 guna adhik majboot hota he
 This suggests that Pseudomonas infection is most common

 These compounds are interesting to the manufacturers and optonists of contact lenses because their use does not require patient approval to effectively prevent the effects of bacterial deposition

 Saint Dnyaneshwar Maharashtra was a great saint of the thirteenth century who composed Dnyaneshwari
 sant gyaneshwar kii gananaa bharat ke mahaan santon evam marathi kaviyon main hoti he
 These saints were contemporaries of Namdev and with him he traveled all over Maharashtra to introduce people to knowledge and devotion and preached Samata, Samabhav
 ve maharashtra-samskruti ke 'aadya-pravartakon' main bhi maane jate hai
 Sant Dnyaneshwar was born in 1275 AD on the Ashtami of the Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada in Apegaon near the Paithan in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra
 inke pita kaa naam vitthal pant evam mata kaa naam rukmini bai tha
 His father was a high-ranking Mumukshu and an exclusive worshiper of Lord Vitthalnath
 vivaah ke uparaant unhone sanyas diksha grahan kii thi, kintu unhen apane gurudev kii ajna se phir grihasthashram main pravesh karnaa padaa
 In this stage he had three sons named Nivrithinath, Gyanadev and Sopan and a girl named Muktabai
 sanyas-diksha-grahan ke uparaant in santanon kaa janm hone ke kaaran inhen 'sanyasi kii santan' yah apmanjanak sambodhan nirantar sahanaa padataa tha
 Vitthal Pant even had to commit suicide as per the command given by the society of that time

 "impressed by this supernatural miracle, the leading scholars of Paithan gave those four siblings 'shuddhipatra' in Saka Samvat 1209
 ukt shuddhipatr ko lekar ye chaaron pravara nadi ke kinare based nevaase gram main pahunche
 The eldest brother of Jnanadev had preached from Gahinath of Nath sect of Nivrithinath
 inhone us aadhyatmik dharohar ko gyandev ke dwaara apni choti bahan muktabai tak yathavat pahunchaa diya
 In this way, in the Paramartha Marg, Gyanadev, gratitude and socially wise, wrote a commentary on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita in Marathi with the aim of providing a simple introduction of spirituality to the elites
 isi kaa naam he bhavarthadipika athwa gyaneshwari
 The completion of this scripture took place in the temple of Mahalaya Devi of Saka Samvat 1212 village of Nevasse
 kuch vidwaanon kaa abhimath he- inhone abhang-vrutt kii ek marathi tikaa yogavasishth par bhi likhi thi, par durbhaagya se vah aprapya he
 Almost all the scriptures in those days were in Sanskrit and the general public did not know very much Sanskrit, Asu Tejaswi Balak Dnyaneshwar composed the gita-bhashya named 'dnyaneshwari' in Marathi on Gita only at the age of 15 years
 He preached in his own language as if he opened the bag of knowledge
 swayan tikaakar ne likhaa he- "ab yadi main gita kaa thik-thik vivechan marathi bhashaa main karun to is main aashcharya kaa kya kaaran he 


guru-krupa se kya kuch sambhav nahin ?" After the completion of this book, Dnyaneshwar produced another book called 'amritanubhav', which was an independent investigator of his political principles
 is granth ke purna hone ke baad ye chaaron bhai-bahan pune ke nikatavarti gram alandi aa pahunche
 From here, the letter he wrote in 65 ovis to Yogiraj Changdev is famous in Maharashtra as 'changdev Pasthi'

 In particular, the relationship between Namdev and Jnanadev was so affectionate that it seemed as if both the knowledge and the deeds had become identical in the disguise of the ascetics in the guise of this pilgrimage
 tirthayatra se lautate hue gyandev pangarpur maarg se alandi aa pahunche
 Scholars speculate that Jnanadeva may have composed his 'abhangas' during this period
 balak se lekar vridhon tak ko bhaktimaarg kaa parichay kara kar bhagwat-dharm kii pun:sthapana karne baad gyandev ne alandi gram main atyant yuva hote hue bhi jivit samadhi lene kaa nishchay kiya
 At the age of just 21 years, three months and five days, he renounced this mortal world and became a tomb
 gyandev ke samadhigrahan kaa vrittant sant namdev ne atyant hridayasparshi shabdon main likhaa he
 After finishing his last prayer to his Guru Nivrithinath, he sat in the Samadhimandir like a wisdom located at Gyanadev

 gyaneshwar ji kii likhi 'gyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev pasthi' tathaa 'abhang' jaisi kai kritiyaan sarvamaanya hai
 a few years ago this theory was presented that the author of Dnyaneshwari and the author of Abhang, are two different persons of the same name
 kintu ab anek pusht aadhaaron se is siddhant kaa khandan hokar yah baat sarvamaanya ho chuki he ki ye rachanaaen hi vyakti sant gyaneshwar / dhyaneshwar kii hi hai
 Dnyaneshwar in his unbroken teachings of ethics to the common people with authority, not measuring the depths of the element of discussion
 fal yah hua ki baalkon se vridhon tak ke man par yah abhangavani purna rup se pratibimbit hui
 Gurukrupa, Namasramana and Satsang These are the three steps of Paramarthpath, which have been originally described by Saint Dnyaneshwar in his teachings

 His spiritual practice is enlivened by poetry, his poetry has received the master-seriousness of philosophy

 'dnyaneshwari' was composed keeping spiritual philosophy limited to the texts of the pundits and is easily accessible to the Shudradikas as well
 'neech' samajhe jane vaale kul main janm lene ke kaaran manushya ko saamaajik drushti se kitna hi 'nimna' kyon na mana jaataa ho, parantu ishwar ke yahan sabhi ko samaan aashray miltaa he, is siddhant ko pratipaadit karne kaa shrey gyaneshwar ko he
 His book Dnyaneshwari in Maharashtra is also called 'mauli' or Mother

 God is not only a harsh judge, but also a spontaneous father
 unki drushti main ek mata kii si karunaa he- yah baat sampurna maharashtra main gyaneshwar ne apni saadi-madhur-bhashaa main batalaai
 For this reason, once again the Bhagavata religion was established and 'dnyaneshwari' as the main scripture of this sect also gained prestige among the common people

 Sholay is a robbery-western film, which combines Indian robbery traditions with the Western style, and is also a defining example of masala films, combining a variety of film genres
 vidwaanon ne film ke kai vishyon kaa ullekh kiya he, jaise ki hinsa kii mahima, saamanti vichaaron kaa parivartan, saamaajik vyavastha ko banaae rakhane waalon or sangathit hokar lut karne waalon ke bich bahes, samalangik gaiyr romani saamaajik bandhan or rashtriya ruparekha ke rup main film kii bhoomika
 The combined sales of the music album and separately released dialogues of the film composed by Rahul Dev Burman set several new sales records
 film ke samvaad or kuch paatr behad lokapriy ho gaye or bharatiyon ke dainik rahan-sahan hissaa ban gaye
 In January 2014, Sholay was re-released in theaters in 3D format
 ramgarh naamak ek chote se gaanv main sevanivruth police adhikari thakur baldev singh do choron ko bulaata he, jinhen usne ek baar giraftaar kiya tha
 Thakur is sure that both of them - Jai and Viru - can help him in catching the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh
 gabbar singh ko jivit yaa mrit police ke hawaale karne par pachaas hazaar rupee kaa nagad inaam to tha hi, saath hi thakur ne un donon ko gabbar ko jivit pakadakar uske paas laane par bees hazaar rupee ke atirikt inaam kii peshkash bhi kii
 Gabbar's three companions come to Ramgarh to get food from the villagers, but because of Jai and Viru, they have to go empty-handed
 gabbar unke maatr do logon se haarane par bahut krodhit hota he or un tino ko maar daalata he
 He then attacks the village on Holi day and takes Jai and Viru hostage after a long fight
 thakur un donon kii madad karne kii sthiti main hote hue bhi unki madad nahin karata
 Jai and Veeru somehow escape, and angered by Thakur's inaction, they decide to leave the village
 tab thakur unhen bataata he ki kis tarah kuch varsh pehle usne gabbar ko giraftaar kiya tha par wo jail se bhaag gaya or phir pratishodh lene ke liye usne pehle to thakur ke puure parivaar ko maar daalaa, or phir thakur ke dono haath kaat diye
 Thakur used to cover it after wearing a shawl to hide it
 ramgarh main rahete huye jai or viru dhire dhire gaanv waalon ko pasand karne lage the
 Jai falls in love with Thakur's widow daughter-in-law Radha, and Veeru, who runs a tanga in the village
 isi bich jai-viru or gabbar ke bich choti-moti takaraaren hoti rahati hai, or ek din uske aadmi basanti or veeru ko pakad kar le jate hai
 Jai goes to save them, and the three of them escape
 is ladaai main jai ko goli lag jaati he, jisase uski mrityu ho jaati he
 Enraged by Jai's death, Viru alone chases Gabbar and captures him
 donon ke bich hathapayee hoti he, jisamen viru gabbar ko maarane hi vaala hota he ki thakur vahaan aa jaataa he or gabbar ko jivit uske hawaale karne kaa jai kaa vaayada yaad dilaataa he
 Veeru hands over Gabbar to Thakur, who crushes Gabbar's hand with his pointed shoes and then hands him over to the police
 viru akelaa gaanv chhodkar railway stesan ke liye nikal jaataa he, jahaan basanti uskaa intazaar kar rahi hoti he
 Radha remains alone once again
 is yojana kii shuruyaat tab hui, jab zanjeer film kii release ke lagbhag 6 maheene baad saleem-javed ji pi sippi or ramesh sippi se mili, or unhen isaki chaar pankti kii kahani sunai
 Since 1973, he had narrated this story to many producers
 do nirmaataa / nirdeshkon ne bhi unki is kahani ko sire se nakaar diya tha
 Ramesh Sippy liked his concept and chose him to work further
 isaki vaastavik yojana ke anusaar film main ek sainya adhikari dwaara do purv sainikon ko apane parivaar kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye chunaa janaa tha
 The military officer was later replaced by a policeman, as Sippy felt it would be difficult to get permission to show such scenes
 saleem-javed ne mil kar isaki kahani ko ek maheene main puraa kar liya
 This included everything from his name to the manner of those people
 film kii patakatha or samvaad hindi-urdu main, visheshkar sirf urdu main likhe gaye hai
 salim-javed wrote them originally in Urdu script, and then an assistant translated them into Devanagari, so that those who read Hindi also understand it
 yah film akira kurosava kii 1954 kii film seven samurai par aadhaarit he, or dakaiti western film kaa ek paribhaashit udhaaharan he, jisamen bhartiya dakaiti filmon, vishesh rup se mehboob khan kii madar india or dilip kumaar kii ganga jamana, or western filmon, vishesh rup se sarjio leone ke spegati western jaise ki vans apon e time in da west ke saath-saath da magnifishent seven ke sammelan shaamil hai
 Some elements in the film's plot are drawn from other Indian films, such as Mera Gaon Mera Desh and Khote Sik
 train lut ke ek prayaas kaa chithran karne vaala ek drishy ganga jamana main ek samaan drishy se prerit tha, or isaki tulana north west frontier main isi tarah ke ek anya drishy se bhi kii gai he
 a scene showing the genocide of Thakur's family has also been compared to the Macaben family massacre in Once Upon a Time in the West
 sam pekinpa ke western, jaise da wild banch or pat getate and billy da kid, or jorge roy hill ke buch casidy or sundence kid ne bhi sholay ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The character Gabbar Singh was built on an actual bandit of the same name, who had terror in the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s
 asli gabbar singh jab kisi bhi pulicekarmi ko pakadta tha, to uske kaan or naak katkar use chhod detaa tha, taaki use anya pulicekarmiyon ke liye chetavanee ke rup main darshaya ja sake
 The character was also inspired by Ganga Jamna, where Dilip Kumar's character Ganga was a bandit who spoke a dialect composed of a mixture of Khadiboli and Awadhi, similar to Gabbar
 yah charitra sergio leone ke for e fu dollars mor ke khalanaayak "el indio" se bhi prabhavit tha
 Surma Bhopali, a minor character in the film, was based on a jungle officer named Surma of Bhopal, who was familiar to actor Jagdeep
 suurama ko aakhirkaar mukadmaa daayar karne kii dhamkee deni padi thi, jab film dekhne vaale logon ne unhen bhi ek lakadahare ke rup main sanderbhit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The makers of Sholay had initially chosen Danny Denzongpa for the role of Gabbar Singh, but they were not ready for the role, as he had already agreed to work in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma, whose filming time also included Sholay's
 Was the same
 nirmaataaon kii duusari pasand amjad khan the
 He agreed to play this character and started preparing for this character by reading a book called Abhishapt Chambal
 chambal ke dakaiton ke shoshan ke bare main bataati yah pustak unki saathi kalakaar jaya bhaduree ke pita tarun kumaar bhaduree ne likhi thi
 Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but salim-javed felt that "the audience was sympathetic to him because of his earlier roles; Gabbar had to be completely disgusted
" " Sippy wanted Jai to play Shatrughan Sinha, but many other big stars were working in the film, and so Sinha refused
 amitabh bachchan us samay itane prasiddh nahin hue the; unhen is kirdaar ko paane ke liye kathor parishram karnaa padaa tha
 salim-javed, however, recommended Bachchan's name for Sholay in 1973; Because salim-javed was convinced that Bachchan was the right actor for this film after seeing his acting in the film Zanjeer
 kyonki film ke kai sadasyon ne kathanak pehle hi pard liya tha, kai abhinayta alag alag kirdaar nibhaane hetu icchhuk the
 Pran was first cast for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy found Sanjeev Kumar better for the role
 saleem-javed ne bhi thakur ke charitra ke liye dilip kumaar se baat kii thi, lekin unhone us samay man kar diya; dilip kumaar ne baad main mana ki yah un kuch filmon main se ek thi jise chhodane par unhen khed tha
 Dharmendra was also interested in Thakur's character, but when he was told by Sippy that if he became Thakur, Sanjeev Kumar would be given the role of Veeru and then he would team up with Hema Malini
 film ke nirmaan ke dauraan chaar mukhya kirdaaron ke kaaran iske nirmaan main kaaphi samay lag gaya
 Four months before its filming started, Amitabh married Jaya
 jaya ke maan banane ke kaaran is film ke nirmaan main or deree hui or is film ke pradarshan ke dauraan hi abhishek bachchan kaa janm hua tha
 Even during the courtship scenes of Dharmendra and Hema Malini, Dharmendra used to lose his hard work, and due to this he had to work many times for the same scene
 is film ke pradarshit hone ke paanch varsh baad in donon ne bhi shaadi kar lee
 Most parts of Sholay were shot in the rocky areas of Ramnagar, a small town near Bangalore city in Karnataka
 film ke seton tak suvidhajanak pahunch sunishchit ke liye nirmaataaon ko bangalore rajmarg se ramnagar tak ek sadak banani padi thi
 An entire artificial city was built near the site by art director Ram Yedkar
 on-lokation set kii prakritik prakaash vyavastha se mail khaane ke liye, mumbai ke raajakmal studio ke paas bhi ek jail kaa set banaaya gaya tha
 Later, a part of Ramnagar was also renamed "sippy Nagar" in honor of the film's director
 2010 tak, "sholay chattaanon" kii ek yatra bhi ramnagar aane vaale paryatakon ke liye uplabdh thi
 Filming began on 3 October 1973, filming a scene of Bachchan and Bhaduri
 film kaa nirmaan apane samay ke liye bhavy tha; aksar kalakaaron ke liye partiyon or bhojon kaa aayojan hota rahata tha, or is kaaran iskaa bajet to badha hi, saathi hi ise puraa karne main dhai saal lag gaye
 One of the reasons for its high cost was that Sippy re-shot the scenes he had shot several times to get his desired effect
 geet "ye dosti" ke 5 minute ke geet anukram ko shoot karne main 21 din lag gaye, do chote drishy jisamen radha deepak jalaati he, prakaash kii samasyaon ke kaaran 20 dinon main filmaae ja sake, or ek drishy, jisamen gabbar imam ke bete kii hatya karata he, 19 dinon main jaakar shoot ho paaya
 The theft scene in the train, which was filmed near Panvel on the mumbai-pune railroad, was completed in more than 7 weeks
 sholay steriophonic soundtrack rakhane or 70 mimi widescreen praaroop kaa upyog karne vaali pehali bhartiya film thim
 However, real 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, so the film was first shot on traditional 35mm film, and the 4: 3 images made from it were later converted to 2
2: 1 frames
 is prakriya ke bare main sippi ne kaha, "ek 70 mimi praaroop badi screen kaa vaastavik anand detaa he or tasviir ko or bhi bada banane ke liye iskaa or adhik aavardhan karata he, lekin chunki main dhwani kaa bhi baraabar prasar chahta tha, to hamane 'chah trek-steriophonic' dhwani kaa prayog kiya or phir ise badi screen ke saath sanyukt kiya
 This was definitely a differentiator
 " film ke postaron dwaara bhi iske 70 mimi kii film ke upyog par jor diya gaya, jin par film kaa naam cinemascope ke logo se mail khaataa hua sa shailibaddh kiya gaya tha
 The film's posters also served to distinguish Sholay from other films older than this; One of them even added the English tagline: "the Greatest Starcast Ever Assembled - The Greatest Story Ever Told" vastav main jo film us samay filmaayi gayi thi, uskaa ant bahut alag tha
 Thakur kills Gabbar in the original story, and apart from this there were many such scenes, which were different in the original story
 gabbar kii mrityu kaa drishy, or iske saath saath gabbar dwaara imam ke bete kii hatya or thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar vaale sabhi drishyon ko bhartiya sensor board ne hataa diya tha
 The Censor Board was concerned that people should not be affected by such violent scenes and people would not be killed in the same way to take revenge on other people irrespective of the law
 haalanki sippi ne is drishy ko film kaa hissaa banaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi ladaai ladi, par baad main is drishy ko sensor board ke nirdeshaanusaar phir se shoot kiya gaya, jisamen thakur ke gabbar ko maarane se kuch hi samay pehle police aa jaati he
 For 15 years before it was screened in theaters, people got to see the film directed by the censor board
 1990 main iskaa bina sensor kiya hua british sanskaran vieches main pradarshit hua
 Eros Entertainment then released two separate DVD versions of it; The first was an uncensored 204-minute original film, and the second was a 198-minute film approved by the censor board
 vidwaanon ne film ke kai vishyon kaa ullekh kiya he, jaise ki hinsa kii mahima, saamanti vichaaron kaa parivartan, saamaajik vyavastha ko banaae rakhane waalon or sangathit hokar lut karne waalon ke bich bahes, samalangik gaiyr romani saamaajik bandhan or rashtriya ruparekha ke rup main film kii bhoomika
 Kaushik Banerjee, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, noted that Sholay demonstrated a "sympathetic construction of fake virility" through the examples of Jai and Viru
 banerjee ne yah bhi tark diya ki film ke dauraan vaidhata or aapraadhikta ke bich kii naitik seemaa dhire-dhire khatm ho jaati he
 Film scholar Vimal Dissanayake agrees that the film served to bring "a new stage in the dialectic developed between violence and social order" in Indian cinema
 film vidwaan em
 madhav prasad ke anusaar jai or viru ek haashie vaali aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jo paramparaagat samaaj main pesh kii jaati he
 Prasad also said that, through the elements of revenge, while highlighting the criminality of Jai and Veeru, the way they were embedded in the story, it reflected reactionary politics, forcing the audience to accept the feudal order
 is
 banerjee ne samajhaayaa ki yadhyapi jai or viru dusht hai, lekin phir bhi ve apni bhaavnaatmak jaruraton ke kaaran se maanviya hai, or is tarah kaa dwaitvaad unhen gabbar singh kii shuddh buraai ke saamne kamjor banaata he
 The villain of the film, Gabbar Singh, received good reactions from the audience despite his widespread sadistic cruelty
 disanayake bataate hai ki darshakon ko charitra ke samvaad or vyavhaar se mohit kiya gaya tha, or inhen tatwon ne gabbar ke karnaamon par pardaa daalane kaa bhi kaam kiya, jo ki kisi bhartiya drama film main pehali baar hua tha
 He noted that the portrayal of violence in the film was seductive but unbearable
 unhone aage kaha ki, "puraani drama filmon ke vipareet, jinamein maadaa sharir darshakon ke dhyaan ko apni ore aakarshith rakhata tha, sholay main ek nar centrebindu par he; yah ek yuddh ke maidan sa he jahaan achchhai or buraai ke bich sarvocchata ke liye pratispardhaa chalati he
 Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be seen as an icon of the national framework: it lacks a cozy logical narrative, it repeatedly challenges social stability, and at the same time lacks emotion in human Depreciation of life is also shown
 ek saath rakhane par, ye sabhi tatv bharat kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Sholay's narrative style, its violence, and the actions of revenge and vigilance are sometimes compared by scholars to political unrest in India at the time of its release
 yah tanaav 1975 main pradhan mantri indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal main samaapt hua
 Dissanayake and Sahay also noted the fact that, although many elements in the film were derived from Hollywood's Western style films, especially its scenes, the film was still successfully "indianized"
 udhaaharan ke taur par, wiliam vine der hide ne sholay main ek narsanhaar drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west ke ek drishy se kii thi
 Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasized the values and melodramatic tradition of Indian families, whereas Western films were more materialistic and restrained in outlook
 inacychlopedia of hindi cinema main maithili raav ne note kiya ki sholay western style ko "saamantivaadi vichaar" main dhaal detii he
 Ted Shane of the Chicago Reader noted Sholay's "historical Visual Style" and the intermittent "populist Message"
 saanskrithik aalochak or islamvaadi vidwaan jiauddin sardaar ne apni pustak da sikret politics of a desers: inosense, kalpapebility and indian popular cinema main sholay main muslim or mahila paatro kii roodhiwaadeeta par prahaar kiya, jise unhone "nirdosh graminon ke majaak" kaha
 Sardar noted that the film had two major Muslim characters; Surma Bhopali, and another a helpless victim of dacoits; Additionally, the only function of a female character is to face fate by remaining silent, while the other female character is nothing but a beautiful rural woman
 kuch vidwaanon ne sanket diya he ki sholay main samalangik gaiyr prem prasangayukt vishay bhi hai
 Ted Shane describes the relationship shown between Jay and Veeru in the film as compared to the camp genre
 apni pustak bollywood and globalaligeshan: indian popular cinema, nesan and diaspora main dina holtzman kaa kahana he ki jai kii mrityu ne donon purush paatro ke bich ke sambandhon ko todane kaa kaam kiya taaki ek maanak sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake

 sholay film 15 agast 1975 ko bharat ke swatantrata diwas ke maukey par mumbai main release hui
 Due to negative reviews and lack of effective publicity, the film did not do much for the first two weeks of its debut, although its viewership began to grow from the third week onwards due to positive oral hype

 In 1994 British car magazine Autocar referenced the F1 in a road test stating that "despite being built for the public road, the mclaren F1 is the best driving machine
" " or "epa1 ko car ke itihaas main mahaan ghatnaon main se ek ke rup main yaad kiya jayega or shaayad yah sabase tej utpaadan sadak car ban sakati he jise duniya kabhi dekh sakegi
"
 Chief Engineer Gordon Murray's design concept was a common concept similar to the concepts of high-performance car designers: underweight and overpowered
 This was achieved through the use of high-tech and expensive materials such as carbon fiber, titanium, gold, magnesium and Kevlar
 epa1 carbon fibre monocok chaisi ke istemaal vaali pehali utpaadan car thi
 Gordon Murray had been thinking of a three-seater sports car since his youth, but while Murray was waiting for a flight to go home from the decisive Italian Grand Prix in 1988, he took a three-seater sports car Sketched out and presented it to Ron Dennis, which led to the idea of building the ultimate road car, which was based on the experience of Formula One and the company's performance
 The Udyogiki was Atiprbavit concept and thus the performance of the skills and knowledge through the mclaren F1
 mare ne ghoshnaa kii ki "is samay ke dauraan humlog yrton sena or honda ke tochigi research centre kaa daura karne main sakasham hue
 yah daura is tathy se sambandhit tha ki us samay maclaren epa1 grand pricks kii kaaron main honda ke injanon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 While it is true that i think it would have been better to put a bigger engine on it, but as soon as i drove the Honda NSX, all the benchmark cars like Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini that i think of as a reference in the development of my car are in my mind
 Disappeared
 Of course the car we manufacture called the mclaren F1 will have to be faster than the NSX but the ride quality and handling of the NSX will be our new design goal
 Being a fan of Honda engines, i later went to Honda's Tochigi Research Center twice and requested that they consider building the mclaren F1 a 4
5 liter V10 or V12
 i said, i tried to convince them, but in the end could not convince them to do so and the mclaren F1 was finally equipped with a BMW engine
 " Later a pair of Ultima Mk3 kit cars, chassis numbers 12 and 13, "albert" and "edward", the last two Mk3s, were used as "mules" to test various components and concepts before the first cars were built
 Gone

 This car was not considered valid for the road as it did not have any indicator on the front; As a result, mclaren was forced to make changes to the car
 The original wing mirrors also featured a pair of indicators that other car manufacturers adopted years later

 The driver managed to escape completely
 Later that same year a second prototype was built specifically for crashtesting and it escaped without touching the front wheel arch

 Carbon fiber body panels and monocoque required a lot of heat insulation in the engine compartment, so Murray solved the solution by aligning the engine bay with a highly efficient heat reflector: gold foil
 har car main lagbhag 25 gram sone kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The road version used compression in the ratio of 11: 1 to generate 627 horsepower at 7400 rpm and 480 foot-pound torque output at 5600 rpm
 ingine main 7500 arpm par ek redline rev limetre set he
 The ratio of the power and weight of a car is a better way of determining the magnitude of acceleration performance than the peak output of a vehicle's powerplant as opposed to the raw engine power

 Camshafts are constantly changing for enhanced performance, with a system based on bmw's VANOS variable timing system quite closely to the BMW M3; It is a hydraulically-actuated phasing mechanism that slows the exhaust cam-related inlet cams at low revs which reduces valve overlap and provides greater idle stability and more low-speed torque
 ucchtar arpm par silinderon main hawa ke bade hue bahaav or is tarah bade hue pradarshan ke liye valve overlap ko computer niyantran dwaara 42 degree tak badha diya jaataa he
 The engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder to fully atomize the fuel, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve operating at low engine rpm while the second injector positioned far above the inlet tract
 Which operates at higher rpm

 computer vigyaan main ek software sarthak kramadeshon or zaruri soochnaaon kaa ek aisa tantra he jo computer ke yantransh or duusare softwaron ko aadesh dekar kramadeshak kaa manachaaha kaam karata he
 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer
 aavashyaktaanusaar bhinn-bhinn upyogon ke liye bhinn-bhinn software hote hai
 The programs written for the work of calculating salary, accounting of transactions, stock of goods, accounting of sales, etc
 are called application software

 Seven types of intellectual property rights are discussed in TRIPS
 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software
 software ko patent karaane kaa mudda vivaadaaspad he tathaa kuch kathin bhi
 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime
 open sorce sauftware main sorce code hameshaa prakashit hota he
 What kind of authority its writers have over it depends on the terms of the licenses under which they are published
 open sorce sauftware main kuch license kii sharten use copileft karti hai
 It is also known as free software or GPOLD software
 in software ko koi bhi vyakti muft main downlod kar saktaa he, istemaal kar saktaa he, vitareet kar saktaa haievam isame apni jarurat ke mutabik badlaav bhi kar saktaa he
 Open source software is a wonderful tool of technology, science and art, not just mechanical content
 isane computer jagat main ek kranti kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Only open source software fulfills the dream of making computer technology accessible to more people all over the world

 Ustad Badal Khan and Manna Dey's uncles were once doing Riyaz together
 tabhi badal khan ne manna de kii aawaaj suni or unke chachaa se poocha - "yah koun ga rahaa he?" jab manna de ko bulaayaa gaya to unhone ustad se kaha -"bas aise hi ga letaa hoon

 Manna Dey had great reverence for singing
 kisi bhi nirmaataa ko yadi apni film main shastreey geet gavaana hota tha to vah sirf manna de ko hi sin karata tha
 a song from the film Padrasan, released in 1968, was being recorded while Kishore Kumar, who did not know Sargam and Manna Dey, who was its master, got drawn into this
 nirmaataa ne kaha ki ise vaisaa hi gaanaa he jaisaa geetkaar rajendra krishna ne likhaa he
