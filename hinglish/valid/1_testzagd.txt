 Fearing the stories of the Rajput valleys and seeing the huge army of Maldev before him, Sher Shah decided to return in awe

 It was written in them that Sardar Rao would imprison Maldev and hand it over to Sher Shah

 The 1975 European Cup final was a football match between Leeds United and Bayern Munich on 28 May 1975, at the Park des Princes, Paris

 bundeslig mausam 1974-75 main bern pichley teen german championships jeetne ke baad ek gambhir mandi ke kaaran tha
 Six of the Bayern players won the 1972 European Championship and the 1974 World Cup, especially as it was said to be due to motivational losses
 leeds united ke liye, keval duusare angreji club epasi barsilona ke baad sabhi teen europea cap pratiyogitaaon ke final tak pahunchane ke liye manchester 1968 main sanyukt or itihaas main duusari team ke baad final main pahunchane ke liye, khel kii 'yash' varsh kaa charmotkarsh tha purv prabandhak don revie dwaara nirmit team

 This would be the club's final appearance in a major cup final until the League Cup in 1996
 Thus, only the winners of the final between Bayern and Leeds will be entitled to participate in the season after the European Cup competition

 Only the second time an English club's appearance in the final would eventually precede a period of dominance by Football League clubs Liverpool, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest in European football
 However, after the violence and the long ban down to Leeds, the final 10 years of the European Cup have to be foreshadowed by tragic events
 The violence was reduced to two years, although the violence saw Leeds banned from Europe for four years
 Finally, this ban was not implemented until 1979–80 due to a decline in the club's performance in the late 1970s preventing European qualification

 a capacitor or capacitor is a two-headed component used in electrical circuits
 yadi do yaa do se adhik chaalkon ko ek vidyutrodhi madhyam dwaara alag karke sameep rakhaa jaae, to yah vyavastha sandharitra kehalaati he
 These drivers have equal and opposite charges
 yadi sandharitra ko ek bydaree se joda jaae, to isamen se dhara kaa pravaah nahin hoga, parantu isaki platon par baraabar maatra main ghanaatmak evam rinatmak aavesh sanchay ho jaayenge
 Electrical capacitors are used to store electric charge, or static electrical energy, and in electrical filters, snubbers, etc
 sandharitra main dhaatu kii do platen hotin hai jinke bich ke sthaan main koi kuchaalak dielectric padaarth bharaa hota he
 The current flows between the capacitor plates only when the voltage between its two plates changes over time
 is kaaran niyat disi vibhavaantar lagane par sthaayee avasthaa main sandharitra main koi dhara nahin bahati
 But by applying alternating capacitance between the two ends of the capacitor, the accumulated charge on its plates keeps decreasing or increasing due to which current flows in the outer circuit
 sandharitra se hokar disi dhara nahi bah sakati
 The relationship between the capacitor current and its plates is given by the following equation: jahaan : The work that has to be done in charging the capacitor is stored in the capacitor
 sandharitra main sangrahit yah urja vidyut kshetra ke rup main hoti he
 The value of stored energy u is expressed by the following formula- vaidyut kshetra ke kisi bindu par ikai aaytan main sangrahit urja kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se diya ja saktaa he- Just as resistors and inductances are added in series or parallel order as required, proper values and proper ratings are obtained, similarly two or more capacitors are also connected as needed
 shreneekram main jude hue n sandharitron kaa tulya dharita nimnlikhit sutara se di jaati he: If two capacitors are connected in series, their equivalent capacitance can be extracted from the following simple formula- or agar dono sandharitra samaan maan vaale hon to shreneekram main sanyojit karne par unki tulya dharita prayek kii dharita kii aadhi ho jaati he
 For example, adding two capacitors of 10 microfarad in series, the equivalent capacitance would be 5 microfarad
 samaantar kram main jude sandharitron kii kul dharita unki dharitaaon ke yoga ke baraabar hoti he
 For example, if 4 capacitors with 10 microfarad are added in parallel, their total capacitance will be 40 microfarad

 Thus capacitors are also of many types

 Heer Ranjha is one of the four famous love stories of Punjab
 iske alaava mirza-sahiba, sassi-punnun or sohani-mahiwal baaqi teen hai
 Many narratives of this story have been written, but the most famous is the story of Baba Waris Shah
 damodar das aroda, mukabaaz or ahamed gujjar ne bhi iske apane rup likhe hai
 Heer was a very beautiful woman born in a wealthy family of Sial sub-castes of Jats in Jhang city of Punjab
 dhido ranjha chanaab nadi ke kinare takht hazaaraa naamak gaanv ke ek ranjha upjati vaale jat parivaar ke chaar ladakon main sabase chota bhai tha
 He was the beloved son of his father, so where his brother used to work in the fields, Ranjha was playing the flute, living the life of comfort
 uski bhabhiyon ne use khaanaa dene se inkaar kar diya or vah ghar chhodkar nikal padaa or chalate-chalate hir ke gaanv pahunch gaya
 He fell in love with Heer there
 hir ne use apane pita kii gaay-bhaisen charaane kaa kaam diya
 Hearing Ranjhe's flute, she became enchanted and fell in love with him
 vah ek-duusare se chup-chup kar milane lage
 One day he is seen by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and his father and mother forcefully marry Heer to a man named Saida Kheda
 raanjhe kaa dil tut jaataa he or vah jog lene ke liye baba gorakhnath ke prasiddh dere, tilla jogiyaan, chalaa jaataa he
 Gorakhnath's disciples are called kanfte because they wear earrings with their ears pierced
 ranjha bhi kaan chhidaakar 'alakh niranjan' kaa jaap karata puure punjab main ghumta he
 Finally, one day he reaches the village of Heer's in-laws
 hir-raanjha donon hir ke gaanv aa jate hai jahaan hir ke maan-pita unhen shaadi karne kii ijazat de dete hai lekin hir kaa chachaa kaido unhen kush dekhakar jalataa he
 On the wedding day, Kaido adds poison to Heer's dinner
 yah khabar sunakar ranjha use bachane dauda aata he lekin bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Ranjha, after suffering more than he can tolerate, consumes the same poisonous laddu and succumbs to Heer's side
 unhen hir ke shahar, jhang, main dafanaaya jaataa he or har taraf se log unke mazaar par aakar unhen yaad karte hai
 The Damodar poet, lived in the reign of Akbar and describes himself as a friend of Heer's father Chuchak and says that this is all my eyes saw
 damodar ke baad punjabi sahitya main lagbhag 30 kisse "hir" yaa "hir raanjha" naam se uplabdh hai jinamein gurdas, ahamed gujjar, guru govindsingh, miyaan chiraag awan, mukbal, vaaris shah, hamidshah, hashim, ahmadayaar, pir mohammad baksh, fajalshah, maulashah, maulabaksh, bhagavaansingh, kishansingh aarif, sant hajarasingh or gokulchand sharma ke kisse sarvavidit hai, kintu jo prasiddhi vaarisshah kii kriti ko praapt hui vah kisi anya kavi ko nahin mil pai

 He considered Hindi as a means - "if Hindi comes in the way of Indian freedom, i myself will strangle him
" ve hindi ko desh kii aazaadee ke pehle aazaadee praapt karne kaa saadhan maanate rahe or aazaadee milane ke baad aazaadee ko banaaye rakhane kaa
 "it should not be forgotten here that Tandon's entry into politics was due to his love for Hindi
 tandon ji ne gwalior ke victoria college main hindi ke lekturer ke rup main kaary kiya us samay atal bihari vaajapei victoria college ke chaatr hua karte the
 On 17 February 1951, on the occasion of the 17th anniversary celebration of Muzaffarnagar 'suhrid Sangh', Tandon ji said- "I entered into an organization like Congress with the aim of strengthening the Hindi side, because Hindi's influence on my heart is the most
 It was more and i made him the greatest vow of my life
 xxrep 6 
 hindi sahitya ke prati mere prem ne uske swaarthon kii raksha or uske vikaas ke path ko spasht karne ke liye mujhe raajnneeti main sammilit hone ko baadhya kiya
 "therefore, it can be said that Tandon Ji had both the independence and Hindi
 rajarshi main balykaal se hi hindi ke prati anuraag tha
 Balakrishna Bhatt and Madan Mohan Malaviya ji gave maturity to this love
 10 oktover 1910 ko kaashi main hindi sahitya sammelan kaa pratham adhiveshan mahaamanaa malviya ji kii adhyakshata main hua or tandon ji sammelan ke mantri niyukt hue
 Subsequently, he served Hindi extensively through Hindi Sahitya Sammelan

 The purpose of setting up this Chair was to spread Hindi education and end the domination of English

 He knew that the cooperation of non-hindi speakers is necessary for the spread of Hindi throughout India
 shaayad unki isi soch kaa parinaam tha sammelan main gandhi kaa liya janaa
 Later, there was a difference of opinion between Tandonji and Mahatma Gandhi on the question of 'hindustani'
 tandon ji aparaajey yoddha the
 He could take on anyone for truth and justice
 apane siddhanton par chattan kii tarah adig evam sthir rahete the
 As a result Gandhiji had to separate himself from the conference, Tandon ji continued on his path
 san 1949 main jab samvidhan sabha main rajbhasha sambandhi prashn uthaaya gaya to us samay ek vicitra sthiti thi
 Mahatma Gandhi was a supporter of Hindustani, Pandit Nehru and Dr
 Rajendra Prasad and many other leaders were also in favor of Hindustani, but Tandon ji did not lose, not bow down
 parinamat: vijay bhi unki hui
 After the heated debate on 11, 12, 13, 14 December 1949, the Congress voted on Hindi and Hindustani, Hindi got 62 and Hindustani got 32 votes
 antat: hindi rashtrabhasha or devanagari rajalipi ghoshit hui
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 It is also necessary to mention here that Tandon ji tried his best to give recognition to the civilian marks in the constitution, for this he left the institution which he served for almost five decades
 samvidhan-sabha main rajarshi ne angreji ankon kaa virodh kiya par nehru ji kii hidaayat ke kaaran congressi sadsy shri kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi, shri gopal swami ingar ke formule ke paksh main rahe
 Tandon ji's protest motion fell and the civil issue could not be recognized in the constitution
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 rajarshi ke vyaktitv evam krititv kaa akalan karte samay praaia: unke sahityakar rup ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 He was the creator of a high court
 unki rachanaaon main tatkaaleen itihaas kii khoj kii ja sakati he
 As a litterateur, Tandon appears as an essayist, poet and journalist
 unke niabandh hindi bhashaa or sahitya, dharm or samskruti tathaa anya vividh kshetron se sambandhit hai
 Among the poetic compositions, 'bandar Sabha Epic', 'cottage Flower' and 'freedom' have their historical significance
 in kavitaaon main rashtriyata or deshbhakti kii pramukhataa he
 In his works, to find closely the poetics will have to be pierced, but the expression with which the Tandan ji has expressed the age-old reality is certainly praiseworthy - 'bandar sabha mahakavy` main aalha style main angrejon kii nitiyon kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Enjoy one or two of the jokes he has taken against the British - patrakarita ke kshetra main tandon ji angreji ke bhi udbhat vidwaan the
 Shri Tribhuvan Narayan Singh ji has mentioned that when he was elected the President of the Congress in 1950, he wrote his address in Hindi and i did the English translation
 shri sampoornanand ji ne bhi us angreji anuwaad ko dekha, lekin jab tandon ji ne us anuwaad ko padhaa, to usamen kai pannon ko phir se likhaa
 Then i realized that while he was a learned scholar of Hindi, he also had great authority over English literature
 purushottams tandon ke bahu aiami or pratibhashali vyaktitv ko dekhakar unhen 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 On the evening of 15 April 1948, Mahanta Devaraha Baba honored you with the title of 'rajarshi' with a Vedic chant on the Saryu coast
 kuch logon ne ise anuchit tehraaya, par jyotirmath ke shri shankaracharya maharaj ne ise shastrasammat mana or kaashi kii pandit sabha ne 1948 ke akhil bhartiya saanskrithik sammelan ke oopaadhi vitaran samaaroh main isaki pushti kii
 Since then, this title has been embellished with its name inextricably linked
 bhartiya samskruti ke param himachati or pakshdhar hone par bhi rajarshi roodhiyon or andhvishwaason ke kattar virdohi the
 He also expressed his blunt thoughts on the evils and malpractices prevalent in Indian society
 unamem ek adbhut aatmbal tha, jisase ve kathin se kathin kaary ko aasaani se sampann kar lete the
 In relation to child marriage and widow marriage, he believed that "the promotion of widow marriage is contrary to our civilizational, our literature and the pativrat religion, the mainstay of our society organization"
 He clarified that the demand for widow-marriage is increasing because In our society, the system against child marriage has run and the question of child widows is the main problem of Indian society
 at: "bal-vivaah kii pratha ko rokna hi vidhwaa vivaah karne kii apeksha adhik mahatv kaa kartavya siddh hota he
 " unke vyaktitv ke is pahalu ke ek-do udhaaharan paryaapt honge- praaia: log samajhate hai ki pakaa hua bhojan supachya hota he, par rajarshi ne ise ek roodhi mana or unhone varshon tak aag se pake hue bhojan ko nahin grahan kiya
 Once left the Chinese food
 ek ore unhen gaay ke doodh se parhez tha to duusari ore chamade ke juute se
 Thus he was the holder of a wonderful personality
 bharatvarsh main swatantraaa ke purv se hi sampradayikta kii samasya apane vikat rup main vidyaman rahi
 Some leaders have also accused Tandonji of being communal
 yah sach he ki rajarshi apni samskruti ke param bhakt or poshak the
 He also did not feel hesitant to say that keeping two cultures alive in India would be a betrayal of the country, but this did not mean that Tandonji was communal, anti-muslim
 is sambandh main kulkusum ke vichaar kitne sarthak hai- Tandonji himself has also written- vastav main tandon ji kaa vyaktitv maanavvaadi tha
 The child who supported him at his home was a Muslim, but how ironic that people say that Tandonji was communal
 rajarshi tandon ji ke vyaktitv ke anya anek pahalu or bhi hai; jaise ve garibon, peediton ke sahaayak the, sahi arthon main deenabandhu the, karunaa kii murti the or babu ji kitne naitik aacharan ke vyakti the iskaa anumaan is udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he- "the year 1950 was Mahakumbh
 bahua ne ganga snaan ke liye gaadi se jane kii baat kahi
 Babu Ji replied that the car belonged to the 'speaker'
 tum mere saath to ja sakati ho, kintu akele nahin
 " uparyukt sankshipt vivechan ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki rajarshi kaa vyaktitv bahuaiami or rajarshi ke anuroop tha
 He was rich in versatility
 ve hindi ke anany premi hi nahin, balki hindi ke paryaay the
 He is mentioned in the history of Hindi literature as an able poet and essay writer
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke amar sannaniyon main unki gananaa agrim pankti ke senaniyon main kii jaati he or unka naam bhartiya swantantraa sangram ke itihaas main swarna aksharon se ankit he
 He was the holder of the steel personality, despite being an affectionate, generous and compassionate idol
 himalay kii tarah achal or atal

 In modern parlance, a sophist is someone who can invent tips, explanations, and ideas to help others
 kintu yah "sofist" kaa mul arth nahin he
 In ancient Greek philosophy, only philosophers were philosophers
 tab "filosphos" kaa prachlan na tha
 In the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, some border philosophers of Greece agitated against cultural ideas

 sucraat ke aatmatyag se yunaan main uskaa sammaan itnaa adhik ho gaya tha ki sucraat ko sophist andolan kaa virdohi samajhakar, parampara ne "sofist" shabd apmaanasoochak maan liya
 In fact, it was the philosophers who humanized Greek civilization
 inase purv, kabhi kisi unani darshanik ne manushya ko sabhyataa evam samskruti kaa nirmaataa nahin samajha tha
 In the Ekian civilization, which is reflected in Hamar's epic titled Iliad, the weight of creation was assigned to the goddesses of Olympus
 chhathi shatabdi isa purv main devi devataaon se anichhaa hone par jis darshan kaa sutarapaat hua, vah prakruti, athwa niyati ko sansar or uski sampurna gati vidhi kii janani maan baitha tha
 But the attention of sophist thinkers went directly towards this idea
 unhone dekha, devputra, athwa prakrutiputra unani kuleen pratha se aakraant the
 He divided the society into free men and slaves
 saarvajanik shiksha kii koi ruparekha bani hi na thi
 The neglected class had no place in public works
 parivartan kii kisi bhi yojana ke safal hone kii aashaa tabhi kii ja sakati thi, jab puraani dooshit paramparaon ke surakshit rakhane kaa shrey manushya ko diya jaataa
 Therefore, the Sophists established humanistic philosophy in place of naturalist philosophy
 afalaatoon ke "protagoras" naamak samvaad main prasiddh sofist protagoras ke mukh se kahalaaya gaya he - manushya sabhi vastuon kii maap he, jo hai unka ki ve hai, jo nahin hai unka ki ve nahin hai
 This was the main voice of the philosophy of sophist thinkers
 isi se pracheen paramparaon ke poshakon ne, "sofist" kahkar unka uphaas kiya
 But he was the pioneer of the revival of Greek civilization

 From the point of view of education, how important was this work in the ancient times when the dictionary of Greek language was not created
 yahi nahin, sofiston ne vigyaan aadi vishyon par bhi paath taiyaar kiye
 It is famous that sophists used arbitrary meanings of any word
 par unke is kaary kaa ek doosraa paksh bhi he
 Till then no limited lecture was developed
 sofiston ke is kaary se vichaarkon kii ankhen khuleen or unhone samajha ki chintan ke niyam sthir karke hi vyakhyaaon ko simit kiya ja saktaa he
 It would probably not be unfair to consider Aristotle's "law of identification" as the result of the independent interpretation of the sophists
 parampara ne sofiston ko sthool vyaktvaad kaa poshak tehraaya he
 But if Protagoras's statement that "man is the measure of all things" would be a big mistake, if we take a brief commentary of the philosophical views developed by that time

 He did not believe in religious virtue
 Because of this they had no children
 One day Sahukarni went to a neighbor's house
 Sakat Chauth was there that day, there was a neighborhood worshiping Sakat Chauth and telling the story
 sahukaarani ne padosan se poocha - "tum kya kar rahi ho ?" tab padosan boli kii aaj chouth kaa vrath he, isliye kahani suna rahi hoon | tab sahukaarani boli chouth ke vrath karne se kya hota he ? tab padosan boli ise karne se ann, dhan, suhaag, putr sab miltaa he | tab sahukaarani ne kaha yadi meraa garbh rah jaye to main sava ser tilkut karungi or chouth kaa vrath karungi | Lord Ganesha left the womb of a money lender with the help of God
 So she said that if i become a boy, i will do two and a half ser tilkut
 a few days later her boy was done, so she said, o Lord Chauth! If my son gets married, i will do a quarter of a fifth of tilakut
 a few years later, her son's marriage was finalized and her beta went on to marry
 But that money lender did not tilkut
 For this reason, Chauth Dev became angry and he picked up his son from Faro and placed him on a Peepal tree
 Everyone started searching for the groom, but he could not be found, due to desperation, all the people went to their own house
 Here, the girl with whom the moneylender's boy was about to get married, she went to the forest to worship Gangaur with her friends
 tabhi raste main pipal ke ped se aawaaj ai - "o meri ardhabyahi " yah baat sunakar jab ladki ghar aayi uske baad vah dhire dhire sukh kar kataa hone lagi | ek din ladki kii maan ne kaha - "main tumhe acha khilaati hoon, acha pahanaati hoon, phir bhi tu sookhti ja rahi he ? aisa kyon ?" tab ladki apni maan se boli kii vah jab bhi dub lene jangal jaati he, to pipal ke ped se ek aadmi bolta he kii o meri ardhabyahi | He has tied henna and has tied sehra as well
 Then his mother went to the Peepal tree and saw that it was her deposit
 Then his mother said to Jamai - why is sitting here? My daughter was half dead and what will she take now? sahukaarani kaa betaa bole - "meri maan ne chouth kaa tilkut bolaa tha lekin nahin kiya, is liye chouth mata ne naaraaz ho kar yahaan baitha diya | " Hearing this, the girl's mother went to Sahukarni's house and asked her, "have you said anything to Sakut Chauth?" Then Sahukarni said - Tilakut was spoken
 After that the moneylender said if my son tries home, i will do two and a half tilkut
 isse shri ganesh bhagwan prasann ho gaye or uske bete ko phero main laa kar baitha diya | bete kaa vivaah dhooma dham se ho gaya | jab sahukaarani ke bete bahu ghar ko aa gaye tab sahukaarani ne dhai man tilkut kiya or boli he chouth dev ! aap ke aashirwad se mere bet bahu ghar aaye he, jisase main hamesa tilkut karke vrath karungi | iske baad saare nagar vaasiyo ne tilkut ke saath sakat vrath karnaa prarambh kar diya | o Sakat Chauth, to introduce us all to the way the moneylender was introduced to his son-in-law

 The Pratihara dynasty was a dynasty that ruled a large part of central-north India during the medieval period, founded in 725 AD by a feudal named Nagabhatta
 is rajvansh ke log swayan ko ram ke anuj lakshmana ke vanshaj maanate the, jisane apane bhai ram ko ek vishesh avasar par pratihaar kii bhanti seva kii
 The origin of this dynasty is known from the ancient Gwalior citation records
 apane swarnakaal main samrajya pashchim main sutluj nadi se uttar main himalay kii tarai or purv main bengal-assam se dakshin main saurashtra or narmada nadi tak failaa hua tha
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja was the most powerful and great king of this dynasty
 arab lekhakon ne mihirbhoj ke kaal ko sampann kaal bataate hai
 Historians believe that the Gurjara Pratihara dynasty kept India from Arab attacks for almost 300 years, hence the name Gurjar Pratihara
 gurjar pratihaaron ne uttar bharat main jo samrajya banaaya, vah vistaar main harshavardhan ke samrajya se bhi bada or adhik sangathit tha
 The credit for creating an atmosphere of growth and progress in peace, prosperity and culture, literature and art etc
 goes to the Pratiharas only by political integration of the country
 gurjar pratihaarakalin mandiro kii visheshta or murtiyon kii kaarigari se us samay kii pratihaar style kii sampannataa kaa bodh hota he
 Many important things about this dynasty are known from the Gwalior Commendation Records
 nagabhatta pratham ko is rajvansh kaa pehla raja mana gaya he
 The Arabs' invasion of India had begun in the eighth century
 sindh or multan par unka adhikaar ho chukaa tha
 Then under the leadership of Junaid, the governor of Sindh, the army moved forward to attack Malwa, Jurj and Avanti, where Jurj was captured
 parantu aage avanti par nagabhatta ne unhain khadaid diya
 Nagabhata's fame spread all around by defeating the invincible Arabs' army
 arabon ko khadedane ke baad nagabhatta vahiin na rukate hue aage badhate gayi
 And they extended their control east and south to the ports of Mandore, Gwalior, Malwa and Bharuch in Gujarat
 unhone malwa main avanti main apni rajdhani kii sthapana kii, or arabon ke vistaar ko roke rakhaa, jo sindh main swayan ko sthapit kar chuke the
 Nagbhatta led a confederacy of gurjara-pratiharas in this war with the Muslim Arabs
 nagabhatta ke baad do kamjor uttaradhikari aaye, unke baad aaye vatsaraj ne samrajya kaa or vistaar kiya
 After the death of Harshavardhana, Kannauj faced a power vacuum, which resulted in the disintegration of Harsha's empire
 joki antat lagbhag ek sadi ke baad yashovarman ne bharaa
 But his position also depended on an alliance with Lalitaditya Muktpeed
 jab muktapida ne yashovarman ko kamjor kar diya, to shahar par niyantran ke liye trikoniya sangharsh viksit hua, jisamen pashchim or uttar kshetra se pratihaar samrajya, purv se bengal ke paal samrajya or dakshin main dakkan main aadharbhoot rashtrakut samrajya shaamil the
 Vatsaraja successfully challenged and defeated the Pala ruler Dharmapala and the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga for control of Kannauj and captured the two Rajashatras
 786 ke aasapaas, rashtrakut shaasha dhruv dharvarsh narmada nadi ko paar kar malwa pahunchaa or vahaan se kannauj par kabja karne kii koshish karne laga
 In about 800 AD, Vatsaraja was defeated by Dhruva Dharvarsha and forced to seek refuge in Marudesh
 or uske dwaar gaundraj se jite kshetron par bhi apana kabja kar liya
 Vatsaraja again had to rule from his old territory Jallon, with the repatriation of Dhruva, Pal Naresh Dharmapala captured Kannauj and made Chakrayudh king under him
 vatsaraj ke baad uskaa putr nagabhatta dwitiya raja bana, use shuru main rashtrakut shaasha govind tritiy ne parajeet kiya tha, lekin baad main vah apni shakti ko pun: badha kar rashtrakooton se malwa chin liya
 Accordingly, he defeated the kings of Andhra, Sindh, Vidarbha and Kalinga
 chakrayudh ko haraa kar kannauj par vijay praapt kar liya
 He went ahead and defeated Dharmapala and conquered the hill fort of Balpurvak Anarta, Malav, Kirat, Turushaka, Vatsa and Matsya
 shakambhari ke chaahmaanon ne kannoj ke gurjar pratiharon ki adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 He spread the Pratihara kingdom further to the Pataliputra in the Gangetic plain
 aage usne pashchim main punah musalamaanon ko roak diya
 He rebuilt the great Shiva temple of Somnath in Gujarat, which was broken from Sind into Arab hamlets
 kannauj gurjar-pratihaar rajya kaa centre ban gaya, apni shakti ke charmotkarsh ke dauraan adhiktar uttari bharat par inkaa adhikaar rahaa
 After the Strait of Nagabhata in 833 AD, his son Rambhadra or Ram Gurjar became the next king of the Pratihara Empire
 rambhadra ne sarvottam ghodo se susajjit apane samanto ke ghudsavaar saina ke bal par apane saare virodhiyo ko roke rakhaa
 However, he was facing tough challenges from the Devpal of the Pala empire
 or vah gurjar pratiharon se kalinger kshetra lene me safal rahaa
 After Rambhadra, his son Mihirbhoja or Bhoj i assumed the power of Gurjara Pratihara
 mihirbhoj kaa shasankaal pratihaar samrajya ke liye swarnakaal mana gaya he
 Arab writers describe the period of Mihirbhoja as a prosperous period
 mihirbhoj ke shasankaal me kannauj ke rajya kaa adhik vistaar hua
 His kingdom was spread in the north-west of Satulj, in the north the Himalayan foothills, in the east the western border of the Pala empire, in the south-east the border of Bundelkhand and Vatsa, Saurashtra in the south-west, and most of Rajasthan in the west
 isi samay paalvansh kaa shaasha devpal bhi bada yashasvi tha
 Therefore, many fierce wars took place between the two
 ant main is paal-pratihaar sanghars main bhoj ki vijay hui
 Amoghavarsha and Krishna II were ruling the Rashtrakuta at the time of Mihirbhoj towards the south
 atah is daur main gurjar pratihaar-rashtrakut ke bich shaanti hi rahi, halanki varato sangrahalayake ek khandit lekh se gyaat hota he ki avanti par adhikaar ke liye bhoj or rashtrakut raja krishna dwitiya ke bich narmada nadi ke paas yuddh hua tha
 In which the Rashtrakutas had to return
 avanti par gurjar pratihaaron kaa shashan bhoj ke kaarykaal se mahendrapal dwitiya ke shasankaal tak chalata rahaa
 After Mihir Bhoja his son Mahenderpal i became the new king
 In this period, empire expansion was halted but all its territories remained in authority
 is daur main kala or sahitya kaa bahut vistaar hua
 Mahendrapal appointed Rajashekhar as his regent
 isi dauraan "karpurmanjari" tathaa sanskrit naatak "balramayana" kaa abhinit kiya gaya
 The gurjara-pratihara empire had now attained its highest peak
 mahendrapal kii mrityu ke baad uttaradhikari kaa yuddh hua, or rashtrakuton ki madad se mahipal kaa sautela bhai bhoj dwitiya kannauj par adhikaar kar liya halanki yah alpakaal ke liye tha, rashtrakuton ke jate hi mahipal pratham ne bhoj dwitiya ke shashan ko ukhaad phenkaa
 Taking advantage of the temporary weakness of the gurjara-pratiharas, many feudalists of the empire especially the Parmars of Malwa, the Chandels of Bundelkhand, the Kalchuri of Mahakoshal, the Tomars and the Chauhans of Haryana began to become independent
 rashtrakut vansh ke dakshini bhartiya samraat indra tritiy ne 912 i0 main kannauj par kabja kar liya
 Although the Gurjara Pratiharas reclaimed the city, their position remained weak in the 10th century, the main reasons being the Turko invasions from the west, the Rashtrakuta dynasty from the south, and the progress of the Pala empire to the east
 gurjar-pratihaar rajasthan kaa niyantran apane saamanton ke haath kho diya or chandelo ne 950 i ke aasapaas madhya bharat ke gwalior ke samrik kile par kabja kar liya
 By the end of the 10th century, the gurjara-pratihara merged into a small state centered on Kannauj
 shashan kaa pramukh raja hota tha
 The Gurjara Pratihara kings were masters of unlimited power
 ve samanton, prantiya pramukho or nyayadhishon ki niyukti karte the
 Since the king depended on the army of the feudal forces, so the feudal lord could stop the arbitrariness of the king
 yuddh ke samay samant sainik sahaayta dete the or swayan samraat ke saath ladane jate the
 The Council of Ministers was assisted by the king in administrative work, which had two parts "bahir Upasthana" and "abhyantar Upasthana"
 bahir upasthaan main mantri, senanayake, mahapratihaar, mahasaamant, mahapurohit, mahakavi, jyotishi or sabhi pramukh vyakti sammalit rahete the, jabaki abhyantariya upasthaan main raja ke chune hue vishwaasapaatr vyakti hi sammilit hote the
 The Chief Minister was called the "general Minister" or "prime Minister"
 gurjar pratihaar samrajya anek bhaagon main vibhakt tha
 These parts were ruled by the feudal lords
 inamen se mukhya bhaagon ke naam the: The rest of northern India was administered directly from the central capital, Kannauj

 Rajasekhar became famous as a poet from Balakavi and then poet
 isi dauraan "karpurmanjari" tathaa sanskrit naatak "balramayana" kaa abhinit kiya gaya
 This shows that literature in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa were written in three languages during Pratihara period
 kintu praakrit dino-din kam hoti gai or uski jagah apbhransh leti rahi
 Compared to Brahmins, there are more literature written by Jains
 jiskaa kaaran jain granthon kaa bhandar main surakshit batch janaa jabaki bramhan grantho kaa nasht ho janaa ho saktaa he

 aar ke narayan kaa puraa naam rasipuram krishnaswami ayyar narayanswami tha
 Narayan is considered among the three greatest novelists among Indian writers of English literature
 mulkraj anand tathaa raja raav ke saath unka naam bhartiya angreji lekhan ke aarambhik samay main 'brihattrayee' ke rup main prasiddh he
 Adopting primarily novel and storytelling, he has set a creative record through his serious realism, expressing the saga of human rise and fall in various levels and forms
 aar ke narayan kaa puraa naam raashipuram krishna swaminarayan tha
 He is also taken by adding the traditional family title 'iyer' to it
 narayan ke pita ek tamil adhyaaapak the, jinhone apana adhikansh samay mysore ke shant shahar main bitaayaa tha
 Narayan, apart from working as a teacher and journalist for a very short time, devoted his entire life to writing
 aar ke narayan mysore ke yadavgiri main kareeb do dashak tak rahe
 In 1990, he shifted to Chennai due to illness
 inke dwaara rachit ek upanyaas guide ke liye unhen san 1960 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 He has done many of his own works by making Malgudi a fictional city
 malgudi ko praayah dakshin bharat kaa ek kaalpanik kasbaa mana jaataa he; parantu swayan lekhak ke kathananusaar "agar main kahoon ki malgudi dakshin bharat main ek kasbaa he to yah bhi adhuri sachai hogi, kyonki malgudi ke lakshan duniya main har jagah mil jaayenge
 " unka pehla upanyaas swami or uske dost 1935 i0 main prakashit hua
 The novel has a very entertaining description of Swaminathan, a schoolboy, and the title of the novel is an abbreviation of Swami's own name
 is upanyaas ke sheershak main hi vyangy sannihit he
 The title completely destroys what the reader expects of the story
 yah swami aisa ladkaa he jo skool main varg main anupasthit rahakar head master ke daftar kii khidakiyon ke shishe todta he or agle din sawaal kiye jane par koi jawaab nahin de paata he to bevakoofon kii tarah takate rahata he or saraasar peeth par bent padane par tathaa desk par khadey kiye jane par achaanak kudakar kitaaben uthaa kar yah kehete hue bhaag nikalataa he ki 'main tumhaare gande skool kii parvaah nahin karata'
 Similarly, Swami's story describes the common mischief of a boy and the punishments found in lieu of it
 kintu lekhak use bade mazaakia lahaze main kisi ladke ke man ko puri tarah samajhate hue kehete hai
 Being an early novel, Narayan is not able to give a complete introduction to creative maturity in terms of the discomfort experienced with increasing age and the feeling of passage of time, but it is quite successful in bringing the whole freshness of childhood into the narrative
 Occur
 'snaatak' 1935 i0 main prakashit hua
 It is the story of Chandan, a sensitive young man who presents the duality between the Western ideas about love and marriage acquired by his education and the social structure in which he lives
 da dark room bhi dainandin jivan kii choti-choti baton or ghatnaon ke vivaran se buni kahani he
 In this, there is the story of a traditional woman named Savitri who endures all the sufferings silently
 uskaa pati duusari kaamkaaji mahila kii ore aakarshith hota he or is baat se aahat hone ke baavjood antat savitri saamanjasy sthapit karke hi rahati he
 However, it is not the case that the story is told in a flat form
 bhaawanaaon kaa bimb ukerne main lekhak ne kushalta kaa parichay diya he
 Savitri fights and also leaves the house in despair caused by her husband not leaving the other woman
 niraashaa kii is sthiti main use mahasoos hota he ki swaavlamban ke yogya banane par hi jivan vastav main jivan hota he
 Otherwise "what is the difference between a prostitute and a married woman? - Only that the prostitute keeps changing and the wife clings to one
 donon apni roti or sahare ke liye aadmi par hi nirbhar he
 "in the same sense of despair, she also tries suicide
 bachaa liye jane par ghar na lautakar swabhimaan se apni kamai se guzaara chalaane kaa nishchay karke ek mandir main naukari bhi kar leti he
 But, finally realizing the futility, frustration and weakness of all this, she gives up and then decides to return home
 choti-choti baton kaa vivaran dete hue lekhak bhaawanaaon kii purnataa kaa chitra ankit karata he
 The author's last novel, The English Teacher, was published in 1946 before independence
 yah upanyaas america main 'greatful tu life and deth' sheershak se prakashit hua tha
 In it, the writer has chosen a story after which the excerpt has become unbelievable
 kahani ke aarambh main ghar or ghar kii lakshmi arthath patni ke prati prem purna vyavhaar kaa uttam nidarshan he, lekin kahani ke uttaransh main us patni ke nidhan ho jane ke baad uski aatma se sampark sthapit kar lene kii baaten aayi hai, jo ki rachanaatmak str par avishwasaneey si lagati he
 In fact, Narayan has three levels of creativity
 unki rachanaatmak shreshthata kaa 'swarnyug' bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad aayaa
 From 1952 AD to 1962 AD, the period of more than a decade was the golden age of his creativity
 isse pehle or iske baad ke samay ko spasht vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The trilogy of author's novels followed in this period of creative maturity
 ye teen upanyaas the- da financiel export, guide tathaa malgudi kaa aadamkhor 
 Awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960, 'guide' is the pinnacle of Narayan's creativity
 ise unka shreshthatam upanyaas mana gaya he
 His satirical vision is not connected to such sharp and moral concerns anywhere else, nor is the technique so subtle
 'malgudi kaa aadamkhor' main lekhak ne apane naitik sarokaar ko bhasmasur kii pracheen puranic niti katha ke sandarbh ko rachanaatmak rup main aadhuniktaa ke saath punar srujit kar abhivyakt kiya he
 This modern Bhasmasura is a selfish, eerie and ungodly Uddand Vasu, a straw-filler in animal skins, who is ambushed to shoot the temple elephant, but spontaneously kills a fly hovering near his forehead
 In an attempt, he kills himself by being fired
 hasya mishrit vyangy kaa bhi lanbaa vivaran kahin-kahin lekhak ne diya he
 For example, when asked by an astrologer about half a good date, what could be the obstacle, the astrologer says that the thumb may be hurt, or the milk for coffee may turn sour, or the water running in the tube suddenly
 Be closed spashtatah lekhak yahaan jyotish ke uttam paksh ko bilkul nazarandaaj karte hue prachlit paakhand ke rup main uskaa majaak udaate hai
 There is a Gandhian struggle in the 'mahatma's Waiting' published between the above mentioned Upanishadic Brihatrayi and in the background of 'the Vendor of Sweets' later published
 'mahatma kaa intjaar' is baat kaa adhyayan he ki gandhivadi kranti kii bhartiya jan saadhaaran par kisi pratikriya hui
 This study has been completed as a complete creative work away from political propaganda
 'da vendor of sweets' ke 9 saal baad 1976 main 'da painter of sinz' kaa prakaashan hua
 Despite the display of writing ability in reading these novels, it seems that the golden age of the author's 'guide' and 'mangkhor of Malgudi' has now come down
 haalaanki narayan kii srijan-yatra jari rahi or vishay-vaividhya se bhari kritiyaan aati raheen
 In fact, through his multi-faceted works, he has successfully described the peculiarities of the elegant society of South India
 lekhak kaa vishesh lakshya angrejiyat se bharaa bhartiya he
 He has described it in his novels as well as in the stories with his fragmented personality, self-deception, and the stupidity inherent in it
 ek kahanikar ke rup main narayan kaa pramukh swar komal vyangy kaa he
 Through satire, the author continues to throw light on human psychology
 kuch kahaniyaan rekhachitr ke rup main bhi he or ve narayan ke sanakee paatro kii samaj ko pakadaney kii kshamta se bhari hui hai
 Almost all the stories of RK Narayan have been told in the same fit and fit style which seems flat from above
 kahani main ve kisi krantikari style ko nahin apanaate hai
 Easy readability is an added feature of his story
 iske baavjood uttam kahaniyon main bhi vyangy ke ek saamaanya mudra se upar uthakar ek sarthak jivan drushti ke rup main viksit na ho paane ke kaaran lekhak kaa 'guide' or 'malgudi kaa aadamkhor' vaala upanyaaskaar rup unke kahanikar rup par baari padataa he
