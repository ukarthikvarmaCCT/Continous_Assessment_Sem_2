maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean
 in beringian logon kaa jivan yaqinan kathin tha kyonki yah ek atyant sard ilaaka tha
 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery
 uttar america mahadweep main maimath, mastodon or baldaar gande ke vilupt ho jane kaa yah ek bada kaaran mana jaataa he

 Dalit used to mean pidit, exploited, suppressed, disgusted, depressed, broken, fragmented, broken, crushed, burnt, crushed, mashed, roughed, destroyed, but now SC is now called dalit The term Dalit is used collectively for all the exploited castes considered untouchable or untouchable for thousands of years for uttering a particular caste which is Hindu society by Hindu scriptures It is located at the lowest rung in the system

14 crore population of India
 aaj adhikansh hindu dalit buddha dharm ke taraf aakarshith hue hai or ho rahe hai, kyonki buddha banane se hindu daliton kaa vikaas hua hai
 If we look at the meaning of the term "dalit" from a comparative point of view, the poisoning against it is as follows
 "dalit" - : pidit, shoshit, dabaa hua, khinn, udhaas, tukda, khandit, todna, kuchalanaa, dala hua, pisa hua, masalaa hua, rondahua, vinasht "fruited" -: piedamukta, high, happy, joyful, unbroken, unbroken, connecting, equality, uniform, complete, complete dalit shabd kaa shabdic arth he- dalan kiya hua
 Under this comes every person who has been exploited and harassed
 ramchandra verma ne apane shabdkosh main dalit kaa arth likhaa he, masalaa hua, mardit, dabaaya, ronda yaa kuchlaa hua, vinasht kiya hua
 The meaning of the term 'dalit' has changed considerably in the last six-seven decades

 Now the post of Dalit has become a symbol of agitationalism of the castes considered untouchable

 Valmiki or Bhangi is considered the lowest caste in Indian society and its traditional profession has been to clean the human excreta

 The meaning of dalit is derived by Shankaracharya from dvaita in Madhurashtakam

 The Dalit movement in India started under the leadership of Jyotirao Govindrao Phule
 jyotiba jati se mali the or samaaj ke aise tabake se sambadh rakhte the jinhe ucch jati ke samaan adhikaar nahin praapt the
 Despite this, Jyotiba Phule always advocated the rights of the so-called 'low' caste people
 bhartiya samaaj main jyotiba kaa sabase daliton kii shiksha kaa prayaas tha
 Jyotiba was the first person who advocated the rights of Dalits as well as education of Dalits
 iske saath hi jyoti ne mahilaon ke shiksha ke liye saharaneey kadam uthaae
 Jyotiba was the first person in Indian history who not only advocated school for the education of Dalits but also established the first Dalit school
 jyoti main bhartiya samaaj main daliton ko ek aisa path dikhaaya tha jisapar aage chalakar dalit samaaj or anya samaaj ke logon ne chalakar daliton ke adhikaron kii kai ladaai ladi
 Though Jyotiba had initiated the Dalit movements in India, but Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar did the work of connecting it with the mainstream of society
 ek baat or jiskaa zikr kiye bina dalit andolan kii baat bemaani hogi wo he buddha dharm
 In 600 BCE, Buddhism raised the voice for the rights of the lower sections of Hindu society
 bhagwaan gautam buddha ne iske saath hi buddha dharm ke jariye ek saamaajik or raajnneetik kranti laane kii bhi pahal kii
 It is important to call it a political revolution because at that time religion dominated the power and the direction of society was decided by religion
 aise main samaaj ke nichle talabe ko kranti kii jo disha bhagwaan buddha ne dikhaai wo aaj bhi prasangik he
 After Charvak in India, Lord Buddha was the first person who not only raised voice against Brahminism, casteism and superstition but also gave a philosophy
 jisase ki samaaj ke log bauddhik dasyata kii zanjeeron se mukt ho saken
 If the history of the movements of the lower sections of society is seen from time to time, it will not be possible to deny Charvak
 yadhyapi charvak par kai tarah ke aarope lagaae jate hai iske baavjood charvak wo pehla shaks tha jisane logon ko bhagwaan ke bhay se mukt hone sikhaaya
 In Indian philosophy, Charvak imagined happiness without religion and God
 is tarj par dekhne par charvak bhi daliton kii awaz uthaata nazar aata he
 Well, let's return to that point when Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar started a fight to legalize the rights of Dalits
 

vakt tha jab hamaara desh bharat british upnivesh kii shrenee main aata tha
 It may have been a time of enslavement of the people but in many ways it was a golden period for the Dalits

 Through these ideals, a society was created in Europe in which human values were given priority

 But in spite of this human rights were first recognized in Europe
 iskaa sidhaa asar bharat par padana laazmi tha or padaa bhi
 We can see its direct effect in the Constitution of India
 bhartiya samvidhan kii prastaavna se lekar sabhi anuchhed inhi maanviya adhikaron kii raksha karte nazar aate hai
 Dr
 Ambedkar took up the task of fighting the legal battle of Dalits in India as the most powerful
 dow ambedkar dalit samaaj ke praneta hai
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar first advocated social, political and economic rights for Dalits in the country
 saaf daur bhartiya samaaj ke taatkaalik swaroop kaa virodh or samaaj ke sabase pichhade or tiraskrit logon ke adhikaron kii baat kii
 Its opposition in all forms, political and social, was natural
 yahaan tak kii mahatma gandhi bhi in maangon ke virodh main kud pade
 Baba Saheb demanded that Dalits should get separate representation
 This was the most powerful and strong demand in Dalit politics till date
 desh kii swatantraaa kaa bidaa apane kandhe par maanane vaali congress kii saansen bhi is maang par tham gai thim
 The reason was obvious: People had a direct interest in the fabric of the society and no one wanted to change even a little
 mahatma gandhi ji ko iske virodh kii lathi banaaya gai or baitha diya gaya aamaran anshan par
 The fast unto death was likewise the most powerful weapon of the Mahatma of the country and he used to use this weapon to celebrate his words on the coming days
 baba sahab kisi bhi keemat par is maang se peeche nahin hatana chaahate the wo jaanate the ki is maang se peeche hatane kaa sidhaa sa matlab tha daliton ke liye uthaai gai sabase mahatvapurn maang ke khilaaf main hami bharna
 But there was pressure on them from all around
 or antat puna pact ke naam se ek samjhaute main daliton ke adhikaron kii maang ko dharm kii duhai dekar samaapt kar diya gaya
 In spite of all this, Dr
 Ambedkar did not give up and continued the fight of the people from the lower strata of the society
 ambedkar kii prayaason kaa hi ye parinaam he ki daliton ke adhikaron ko bhartiya samvidhan main jagah di gai
 Even attempts were made to protect the rights of Dalits through the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution

 hindu daliton ke 936 kii tulana main baudhon ke bich mahila or purush kaa ling anupaat 953 prati hajaar he
 This proves that the status of women in Buddhist families is far superior to that of Hindu Dalits
 yah kaaphi buddha samaaj main mahilaon kii ucch sthiti ke anusaar he
 This proportion of Buddhists is higher than that of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains
 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar baudhon ke bich ladakiyon or ladakon kaa ling anupaat 942 he, hindu daliton ke 938 ke mukaable ke anusaar yah adhik hai
 This sex ratio is much higher than Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains
 yah hindu dalit pariwaron ke saath tulana main he ki ladakiyon ko baudhon ke bich behatar dekhbhaal or sangrakshan mila hai
 The literacy rate of Buddhist followers is 72
7 percent, which is much higher than Hindu Dalits
 is dar main bhi hinduon, musalamaanon or sikhon kii tulana main kaaphi zyada yah pataa chalata he ki buddha dharm hindu daliton se bhi adhik sakshar hai
 While it is much lower than the literacy rate of Jains
 jain 95% sakshar hai
 The literacy rate of Buddhist women is 61
7 percent as compared to 41
9 percent of Hindu Dalit women

 All these requests were denied by the Bureau of Equipment based on the principle that, once approved, they would "in fact permanently pawn over this property and eventually split it between the two departments, or We will do a complete boycott of the Navy Department based on the military justification established by the frequency of use
 " However, the Army Depot Quartermaster in Honolulu contracted to sink an emissive well at the Naval Station upon the Commandant's approval, and that Commandant in turn acted on the recommendation of the Bureau of Yards and Docks

 While "legal" insider transactions may not be based on non-public information, some investors believe the health of the company is that company insiders may have better understanding and transactions

 jab koi antarangi company ke swayan kii soochna ke aadhaar par kharidta yaa bechata he, to iskaa yah arth hua ki shairdharakon ke prati apane daayitv kaa vah ulanghan kar rahaa he
 For example, the occurrence of illegal insider transactions would be possible only if the CEO of Company a comes to know that Company a is about to be acquired and buys the shares of Company a knowing that the price of the shares Are going to increase

 In 1980, the West Bengal Government Foreigners' Registration Office noted that Prager took donations from a missionary organization based in the United States
 isi ko dekhte hue karyaalay ne maang ki jaik doctor hone ke saath-saath ek mishanri kaaryakarta he
 Jack was able to settle the matter only after he explained to the Delhi authorities that he was not a missionary worker and Kolkata Rescue was completely secular

 broadband internet abhigam, jise sankshipt rup se aksar broadband kaha jaataa he, ek ucch data dar internet abhigam he- jisaki tulana aam taur par 56K modem kaa upyog karne vaale dial-ap abhigam se kii jaati he
 Dial-up modems are limited to bitrates of less than 56 kbit / s and require the use of the entire telephone line - while broadband technologies often double this rate without interrupting telephone usage
 haalanki broadband kii paribhaasha main vibhinn nunatam bandwidth kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, jisaki seemaa 64kbit / s se lekar 2
0mbit / s tak he, 2006 OECD kii report broadband ko vishisht rup se paribhaashit karti he ki isamen downlod kaa data antaran dar 256 kbit / s ke baraabar yaa tej hota he, jabaki sanyukt rajya america kaa sangheey sanchaar ayog yatha 2009, "basic broadband" ko paribhaashit karata he ki 768 kilobits prati second se adhik, yaa 768,000 bits prati second kii data sancharan gati, kam se kam ek disha main: neeche kii ore yaa upar kii ore 
 The trend is that as the market is providing faster services, the broadening of the definition of broadband is being extended

 broadband ko internet ke liye praayah "ucch gati " abhigam kaha jaataa he, kyonki isamen data kaa sancharan dar aam taur par ucch hota he
 In general, any connection of 256 kbit / s or more to the subscriber is more broadly considered broadband Internet access
 international telecommunication union maanakeekaran sector 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has defined broadband as having a speed of 256 kbit / s in at least one direction and this bit rate, the most common baseline distributed as "broadband" in the world
 lekin udyog dwaara koi vishisht bitret paribhaashit nahin he or "broadband" kaa matlab nune-bitret sancharan ho saktaa he
 Some Internet service providers use low-bitrate connections as broadband for selfish purposes
 vyavhaar main, vigyaapit bandwidth, graahakon ke liye aavashyak rup main hameshaa uplabdh nahin hota he, ISP aksar, itane graahakon ko conection de dete hai jitna unka bakabon conection yaa nebarhud acces network sambhaal nahin saktaa, ve aisa is dharna ke tahat karte hai ki adhikansh upyogkarta, adhikansh samay apane conection kii purna kshamta kaa upyog nahin karenge
 This aggregation strategy works most of the time, so users can typically achieve their full bandwidth most of the time; However, peer-to-peer file sharing systems, which often require high bandwidth usage, circumvent these assumptions and can cause major problems for isps who have booked more than their capacity

 Integrated service digital networks are one of the oldest broadband digital access methods for consumers and industries to connect to the Internet
 yah ek telephone data seva maanak he
 Its use in the United States peaked in the late 1990s, before the availability of DSL and cable modem technologies
 broadband seva kii aam taur par ISDN-BRI se tulana kii jaati he kyonki yah maanak broadband abhigam praudyogiki thi jisane aarambhik broadband pradaataaon dwaara saamana kii ja rahi chunautiyon ke liye ek aadharekha nirmit kii
 These providers attempted to compete against ISDN by offering relatively fast and inexpensive services to consumers
 ek mul dar ISDN line, do data "bearer" channel vaali ISDN line he
 Using an ISDN terminal adapter, it is possible to combine two or more separate ISDN-BRI lines together to reach a bandwidth of 256 kbit / s or more
 ISDN channel baunding praudyogiki, video conference anuprayogon or broadband data sancharan ke liye prayog kii jaati rahi he
 Known as ISDN-PRI, the primary rate ISDN is a line with 23 DS0 channels and a total bandwidth of 1,544 kbit / s
 ISDN E1 line, ek ISDN line he jisamen 30 DS0 channel or kul bandwidth 2,048 kbit / s he
 Because ISDN is a telephone-based product, many of the terminology and physical aspects of the line are shared by ISDN-PRI used for voice services
 ek ISDN line ko, is prakaar dhwani yaa data or vibhinn vikalpon ke liye prabandhit kiya ja saktaa he, jo kisi vishesh sthapana main prayukt upkaran par hoga or telephone company kii central offis switch kii peshkashon par aadhaarit hoga
 Most ISDN-PRI data is used for telephone voice communication instead of data, using large PBX systems
 ek spasht apwaad yah he ki, isps main aam taur par ISDN-PRI hota he jo ISDN data or modem colls ko sambhalata he
 It is primarily a matter of historical interest that many early ISDN data lines used 56 kbit / s instead of 64 kbit / s "B" channels of data
 is vajah se ISDN-BRI ko 128 kbit / s or 112 kbit / s, donon dar par pesh kiya jane laga, jo kendriya karyaalay ke swichan upkarnon par nirbhar karata tha
 Benefit: haani: These are highly-regulated services traditionally intended for trade, which are managed through the Public Service Commission in each state and must be fully defined in PSC tariff documents and their management rules of the 1980s Which still refer to teletypes as possible connection devices
 vaise, T-1 sevaaon kii bahut sakht or kathor seva aavashyaktaaen hai jo seva pradaata ke rakrakhaav ke kharch ko badha detii hai or unhen din ke 24 ghante ek atirikt takanisian ko rakhana pad saktaa he taaki vah line kharaab hone par uski marammat kar sake
 Because of the expensive and regulated nature of T-1 lines, they are normally established under the provisions of a written agreement and the contract is usually one to three years old
 haalanki, aam taur par ek upyogkarta ke T-1 upyog par kuch kam pratibandh hai, apatime or bandwidth data daron kii guarantee ho sakati he, seva kii gunvattta kaa samarthan kiya ja saktaa he or sthir IP pate ke khand saamanytah shaamil hote hai
 Since a T-1 was originally conceived for voice transmission, and since a sound T-1 is still widely used in business, it can be confusing for a new customer
 T-1 ke prakaar ke ullekh par vichaar kiya janaa aksar sabase acha hota he, jiske liye upyukt "data" yaa "dhwani" upsarg kaa upyog kiya jaataa he taaki donon ke bich antar spasht ho sake
 a phonetic T-1 will terminate at the central office of the phone company for connection to the PSTN; a data T-1 will end at a point of presence or data center
 The T-1 line between a customer's premises and POP or CO is called a local loop
 local loop kaa maalik zaruri nahin ki POP par network kaa maalik ho jahaan aapkaa T-1 internet se judata he or isliye ek T-1 graahak kaa, in donon sanghathanon ke saath alag-alag anubandh ho saktaa he
 The nomenclature for a T-1 varies widely, with some areas referred to as a DS-1, a T1
5, a T1, or a DS1
 inamen se kuch, line ke vibhinn pahaluon ke bich bhed karne kaa prayaas karte hai, jahaan ye data maanak ko DS-1 samajhate hai or trunk line kii bhautik sanrachana ko ek T-1 yaa T-1
5
 inhen lijd line bhi kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aam taur par 1
5 Mbit / s ke andar ke data dar ke liye he
 Occasionally, a T-1 may be included in a "leased line" or excluded from it
 ise chaahe jo kuch bhi kaha jaataa he, yah swaabhaavik rup se anya broadband abhigam vidhi se sambandhit he, jisamen shaamil he T-3, SONET OC-3 or anya T-vaahak or optical vaahak
 iske atirikt, ek T-1 ko ek se adhik T-1 ke saath joda ja saktaa he, jo nxt-1 kaa nirmaan karegaa, jaise ek 4xt-1-1 jisaki bandwidth T-1 se bilkul 4 guna he
 When a T-1 is installed, several options are encountered: the WAN IP router used, in the chosen carrier, in place of the demarcation point, in the type of channel service unit, or in the data service unit used, selected Type of bandwidth, etc
 Specialized wans are used with a T-1 line that sends Internet or VPN data from a customer's packet-based network to a T-1 line for which that customer uses the premises equipment
 CPE ek vishisht CSU / DSU se nirmit he jo graahak ke ethernet LAN main upyog karne ke liye, T-1 ke DS-1 data stream ko TCP / IP packet data stream main parivartit karata he
 It is notable that many T-1 providers optionally maintain and / or sell cpes as part of a service contract, which may affect demarcation points and ownership of routers, csus, or dsus
 is
 haalanki ek T-1 main adhiktam 1
544 Mbit / s hota he, ek bhinnaatmak T-1 ko pradaan kiya ja saktaa he jo bandwidth ke liye sirf 128 kbit / s ke purnank gunaj kaa upyog karata he
 In this manner, it is possible that a customer would buy only 1 / 12th or 1 / 3 of a T-1, which would be 128 kbit / s and 512 kbit / s respectively
 T-1 or bhinnaatmak T-1 data line samamit hai, jiskaa arth he ki unke aplod or downlod data daren samaan hai
 Where it remains available, this method of broadband connection to the Internet indicates that Internet access is very fast
 haalanki, sirf isliye ki ethernet pradaan kiya ja rahaa he kaa arth yah nahin he ki pratyaksh internet abhigam ke liye puure 10, 100 yaa 1000 Mbit / s kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 In a college hostel, for example, 100 Mbit / s Ethernet access may be fully available for campus networks, but Internet access bandwidth may be close to 4xt-1 data rate
 yadi aap ek imaarat main dusron ke saath broadband conection saajha kar rahe hai, to imaarat main lijd line kaa abhigamit bandwidth, beshak upyogkarta ke data dar ko sanchalit karegaa
 In some locations, however, real Ethernet broadband access may be available
 yah ek POP yaa data centre par sabase saamaanya maamla hoga or kisi aam ghar yaa vyapaar main nahin
 jab ethernet internet abhigam pradaan kiya jaataa he, to yah fibre optic yaa tambe kii ghumaavdaar jodi ho sakati he or bandwidth, 10 Gbit / s tak ke maanak ethernet data daron ke anuroop hoga
 The primary advantage is that Ethernet does not require any special hardware
 ethernet main vilambtaa bhi bahut kam he
 a major challenge facing broadband is to make this service available to potential customers in areas of low population density, such as farmers, pastoralists and small towns
 In cities where the population density is high, it is easy for a service provider to recover the cost of equipment, but each rural customer may need expensive equipment to connect

 Satellite Internet is generally the most expensive way to gain broadband Internet access, but in rural areas it may be the only option other than cellular broadband
 haalanki, laagat main haal ke varshon main itani kami hui he ki yah broadband ke anya vikalpon ke saath pratispardhi hota ja rahaa he
 Broadband satellite Internet also has a high latency problem due to the fact that the signal has to travel to a satellite in geostationary orbit in space up to an altitude of 35,786 km above sea level and from there back to Earth again
 is
 signal vilamb 500 se 900 milisecond tak ho saktaa he, jo ise rial-time upyogkarta input kii zarurat vaale anuprayogon ke liye anupyukt banaata he, jaise kuch khaas multiplayer games or conection par khele jane vaale first-person shooters
 iske baavjood, abhi bhi kai game khelnaa sambhav he, lekin gunjaaish, rial-time ranneeti yaa baari aadhaarit khel tak simit he
 The live interactive access functionality of a remote computer may be subject to problems arising due to high latency
 ye samasyaayein, sirf buniyadi email abhigam or web browzing ke liye dhyaan dene yogya nahin hai or zyaadaatar maamalon main bamushkil nazar aati hai
 There is no way to eliminate this problem for geostationary satellites
 yah deree, mukhyatah tay kii jane vaali lambi duuri kii vajah se he, jo prakaash kii gati main bhi, maujuud rahegi
 yahaan tak ki yadi signal kii anya sabhi deree ko samaapt kar diya jaae, to bhi vidyut chumbakeey radio tarangon ko, bhu-str se upgrah kii yatra or phir vahaan se waapas prithvi tak aane main 500 milisecond, yaa aadha second lagegaa, kul milakar strot se gantavy tak kii yatra karne main 71,400 kimi or 143,000 kimi ek vaapasi yatra ke liye 
 Factoring in other common delays from network sources, there is a one-way connection latency data of 500–700 ms from the user to the ISP, or about 1,000–1,400 millisecond latency back to the user for a total round trip time
 yah, adhikansh dial-ap modem upyogkartaaon ke anubhav se bhi badtar he, aam taur par keval 150-200 ms kii kul vilambtaa he
 Medium ground orbit and low ground orbit satellites, however, do not have such long delays
 globalstar or iridium upgrah ke maujuuda LEO punj main vaapasi daure kii 40 ms se kam kii deree he, lekin unka thruput, prati channel 64 kbps hote hue broadband se kam he
 The Globalstar Punj rotates in an orbit 1,420 km above the Earth and Iridium at a height of 670 km
 The proposed MEO bridge of the O3b network, whose deployment is scheduled in 2010, will operate in a chamber of 8,062 km, where its RTT latency will be approximately 125 ms
 prastaavit nayaa network bhi bahut ucch thruput ke liye banaaya gaya he jahaan link 1 Gbps se adhik hai 
 Most satellite internet providers have a FAP
 upgrah internet kaa sabase bada nuksaan, shaayad yah he ki, ye faps aamtaur par ek khaas "adrishy diwaar" ke hit hone ke baad data daron ko dial karne ke liye ek upyogkarta ke thruput ko pratibandhit karte hai
