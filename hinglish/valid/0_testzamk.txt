 dengue bukaar ek sankraman he jo dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 It is very important to treat dengue on time
 Mosquitoes transmit dengue virus
 dengue bukaar ko "hadditod bukaar" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, kyonki isse peedit logon ko itnaa adhik dard ho saktaa he ki jaise unki haddiyaan tut gayi hon
 Some symptoms of dengue fever include fever; Headache; Skin rashes such as rash and muscle and joint pain are included
 kuch logon main, dengue bukaar ek yaa do aise roopon main ho saktaa he jo jivan ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 First, dengue is hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding or leakage in blood vessels, and low levels of blood platelets
 doosraa dengue shock syndrome he, jisase khatarnaak rup se nimna raktchaap hota he
 There are four different types of dengue virus
 yadi kisi vyakti ko inamen se kisi ek prakaar ke virus kaa sankraman ho jaye to aamtaur par uske puure jivan main vah us prakaar ke dengue virus se surakshit rahata he
 However, with the remaining three types, he remains safe for some time
 yadi usko in teen main se kisi ek prakaar ke virus se sankraman ho to use gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi adhik hoti he
 There is no vaccine available to protect people from dengue virus
 dengue bukaar se logon ko bachaane ke liye kuch upaay hai, jo kiye jane chaiye
 People can protect themselves from mosquitoes and limit the number of bites from them
 vaigyanik machharon ke panpane kii jagahon ko chota tathaa kam karne ko kehete hai
 If someone has dengue fever, he can usually be cured by drinking enough liquid until his illness is reduced or limited
 yadi vyakti kii sthiti adhik gambhir he to, use antah shira dravya yaa rakt aadhaan kii jarurat ho sakati he
 Since 1960, many people are suffering from dengue fever
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se yah beemaari ek vishwavyaapee samasya ho gayi he
 It is common in 110 countries
 prayek varsh lagbhag 50-100 million log dengue bukaar se peedit hote hai
 People are working on vaccines and medicines to directly treat the virus
 machharon se mukti paane ke liye log, kai saare alag-alag upaay bhi karte hai
 The first description of dengue fever was written in 1779
 20veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main vaigyanikon ne yah janaa ki beemaari dengue virus ke kaaran hoti he tathaa yah machharon ke madhyam se sancharit hoti he
 Dengue was first written many years ago
 jin samrajya ke ek chini chikitsa vishwakosh ek aise vyakti kii baat karata he jise sambhawatah dengue hua tha
 The book tells of a "water poison" disease that was related to flying insects
 17 veen shatabdi ke likhit dastauez bhi ek aisi mahamari kii charchaa karte hai jo dengue ho sakati he 
 The earliest reports of the most likely dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780
 ye report ek aisi mahamari kii baat karti hai jisane asia, africa tathaa uttari america ko apane ghere main le liya tha
 Not many pandemics occurred from that time until 1940
 1906 main vaigyanikon ne siddh kiya ki logon ko "adies" machharon se sankraman ho rahaa tha
 In 1907, scientists showed that viruses are the cause of dengue
 yah maatr doosraa rog tha jise virus se hota dikhaaya gaya tha 
 John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler continued to study dengue virus and found out the basis of the virus's expansion
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad dengue adhik teji se failane laga
 The war is believed to have changed the environment in many ways
 bhinn prakaar ke dengue naye kshetron main faile
 People started having hemorrhagic dengue fever for the first time
 degu kaa yah bheeshan prakaar sabase pehle 1953 main philippines main report kiya gaya
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever became the leading cause of death in children in the 1970s
 yah prashanth kshetra tathaa america main bhi hone laga
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central and South America in 1981
 is samay swasthya seva peshewaron ne yah dekha ki jin logon ko tip 1 dengue virus kaa asar ho chukaa tha unako kuch varshon ke baad tip 2 dengue virus kaa asar ho rahaa tha
 It is not clear where the word "dengue" came from
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah shabd swahili ke vaakyansh kaa-dinga pepo se aayaa he
 This phrase refers to the disease caused by evil spirits
 mana jaataa he ki swahili shabd dinga spani ke shabd dengue se bana he
 The word means "careful"
 vah shabd ek aise vyakti ke bare main bataane ke liye upyog kiya gaya ho saktaa he jo dengue bukhaar ke haddi ke dard se peedit ho; vah dard us vyakti ko saavdhaanee ke saath chalane par majaboor karata hoga
 However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili language, not as mentioned above
 anya logon kaa maananaa he ki "dengue" naam west indies se aayaa he
 In the West Indies, dengue-afflicted slaves were called standing and walking like "a dandy", and for this reason the disease was also called "dandy fever"
 "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam sabase pehle ek chikitsak sanyukt rajya amareeki "sansthaapak janak" benjamin rash dwaara upyog kiya gaya tha
 In 1789 Rush used the name "bone-breaking fever" in a report on the outbreak of dengue in 1780 in Philadelphia
 report main rash ne adhik aupchaarik naam "billiyas remitting fever" kaa adhiktar upyog kiya
 The term "dengue fever" was not generally in use until 1828
 iske pehle rog ke liye bhinn log bhinn naam upyog karte the
 For example, dengue was also called "breakheart fever" and "la dengue"
 jatil dengue ke liye kai naam upyog kiye jate the: udhaaharan ke liye "infectios thrombokytopanic parpura", "philipine", "thai" tathaa "singapore hemoragic fever"
 The first pandemic attack of Dangu occurred simultaneously in Asia, Africa, North America, around 1780, the disease was recognized and named in 1779
 1950 ke dashak me yah dakshin purv asia yah nirantar mahamari rup me failana shuru hua tathaa 1975 tak dengue hemarej fever in deshon me bal mrityu kaa pradhan kaaran ban gaya he
 By the 1990s, dengue became the second largest disease spread by mosquitoes after malaria, infecting 40 million people a year, while thousands of cases of dengue haemorrhage also occur
 farvari 2002 me hi jab rio-di-genero me dengue ke prasar hua to 10 lakh log isaki chapet me aa gayi the jisase 16 log mar gayi
 Till March 2008, the condition was not very good in this city, there were 23,555 cases and 30 deaths in only 3 months
 lagbhag har paanch se chah saal me dengue kaa bada prakope hota he aisa is liye hota he ki vaarshik chakra jo is rog ke aate he wo rogiyon ko kuch samay hetu pratirodh kshamta de detaa he jaise ki chikangunia ke maamalon me hota he
 When this resistance ceases, people become susceptible to the disease again, then there are four types of dengue viruses, besides new ones are added to the population by birth or migration
 is baat ke paryaapt pramaan he es
bi
helstid ne ek adhyayan dwaara siddh kar diya he ki dengue hamerej fever un rogiyon ko zyada hota he jo dwitiyak sankraman se grast hue ho jo ki praathmik sankraman se bhinn prakaar ke virus se hota he
 Although this notion has not been properly understood, there are only a few models that express their views about it, this condition is called the condition of transitivity
 singapore me prativarsh is rog ke 4000-5000 maamle saamne aate he yadhpi aam dharna yah he ki bahut se maamle chupe rah jate he
 Dengue symptoms About 80% of people infected with dengue virus have no symptoms or very mild symptoms
 sankramit logon main se lagbhag 5% log gambhir rup se biimaar padate hai
 In a small number of these people, the disease is life-threatening
 dengue virus se peedit hone ke 3 se 14 dinon ke baad kisi vyakti main lakshan dikhte hai
 Symptoms often appear only after 4 to 7 days
 is tarah yadi koi vyakti aise kshetra se lautataa he jahaan dengue aam he or uske lautne ke 14 din yaa uske baad usko bukaar hota he yaa anya lakshan dikhte hai to shaayad usko dengue nahin he
 Often when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are common cold (cold or gastroenteritis)
 halanki, bacchon main dengue bukaar dwaara gambhir samasyaayein hone kii adhik sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 The ideal symptoms of dengue fever are less which start suddenly like headache; Rashes and muscle and joint pain
 beemaari kaa upnaam "hadditod bukaar" yah darshata he ki yah dard kitna gambhir ho saktaa he
 Dengue fever three stages bukaar sambandhi charan main, kisi vyakti ko aamtaur par ucch bukaar hota he
 Fever is often 40 ° C
 vyakti ko saamaanya dard tathaa sirdard ho saktaa he
 This phase usually lasts 2 to 7 days
 is charan main jin logon main lakshan hote hai unamem se lagbhag 50 se 80% logon ko chakatte ho jate hai
 On the first or second day, the rash may look like red skin
 beemaari ke baad ke dinon main chakatte chechak jaise lag sakate hai
 Small red spots may emerge on the skin
 twachaa ko dabaane par yah daag hatate nahin hai
 These red stains are formed due to broken capillaries
 vyakti ko shleshm jhilli dwaara munh tathaa naak se halkaa raktasrav ho saktaa he
 Fever starts decreasing on its own and returns for a day or two
 halanki, bhinn logon main yah pattern bhinn hota he
 In some people, the disease enters a critical stage after high fever
 gambhir charan ek se do dinon tak chalata he
 During this phase, fluid can build up in the chest and abdomen, because there is a leakage in the blood vessels
 taral banataa he tathaa yah puure sharir main parisancharit hota he
 This means that vital organs do not usually receive blood as per their requirement
 is kaaran se, ang saamaanya tareeke se kaam nahin kar pate hai
 The person may also have excessive bleeding
 dengue se peedit 5% se kam vyaktiyon ko parisancharan aghat, dengue aghat syndrome tathaa dengue rakthasravi bukaar hota he
 If a person has had any other type of dengue before, then he is more likely to have such serious problems
 sudhaar charan main, vah taral jo rakt nalikaaon se baahar ris jaataa he, raktapravaah main waapas shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 The correction phase lasts 2 to 3 days
 vyakti aksar is charan ke dauraan kaaphi behatar ho jaataa he
 However, they may complain of severe itching and slow heart rate
 is charan ke dauraan, vyakti taral overlod sthiti main ja saktaa he
 If it affects the brain, it can cause a change in the level of consciousness or a condition like seizures
 kabhi-kabhaar dengue hamaare sharir ke anya tantron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 a person may have only symptoms or may even have ideal dengue symptoms
 0
5–6% maamalon main chetana kaa str ghat saktaa hai
 This can happen when the dengue virus causes brain infection
 aisa tab bhi ho saktaa he jab mahatvapurn ang sahi bhang se kaam na kar rahe hon
 Other nervous disorders have been reported in people who have dengue fever
 udhaaharan ke liye, dengue transwars militis tathaa guilian-bare syndrome paidaa kar saktaa he
 Although this is not nearly the case, dengue can cause heart infection and severe liver failure
 dengue bukhaar dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 The scientific system in which the virus is classified and named includes the dengue virus as part of the "flaviviridae" family and the "flavivirus" gene
 anya virus bhi is parivaar se sambandhit hai tathaa maanvon main bimaariyaan paidaa kar sakate hai
 For example, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St
 Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kaysanur jungle disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever, all belong to the "flaviviridae" family
 
 inamen se adhiktar virus machharon yaa tik dwaara failte hai
 Dengue virus is mostly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti type mosquitoes
 ye machhar aamtaur par 350 uttar tathaa 350 dakshin akshans par, 1000 meter se kam oonchai par hote hai
 They are mostly cut during the day
 inke ek baar kaatane se bhi maanav sankramit ho saktaa he
 Sometimes mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans
 yadi maadaa machhar kisi sankramit vyakti ko kaat le to machhar ko dengue virus mil saktaa he
 First the virus resides in the cells that are in the stomach of the mosquito
 lagbhag 8 se 10 dinon ke baad virus, machhar kii laar granthiyaan jo laar banaati hai, unamem sankramit ho jate hai
 This means that the saliva made by the mosquito is infected with the dengue virus
 isaliye jab machhar maanav ko katate hai to inaki sankramit laar maanav ko sankramit kar sakati he
 Viruses do not appear to cause any problems for infected mosquitoes, which will remain infected throughout their life
 is baat kii sambhaavna sabase adhik hoti he ki adies aegypti machhar dengue failaata he
 This is because they live closest to humans and live on humans rather than animals
 yah maanav-nirmit pani rakhane ke paatro main andey dena pasand karte hai
 Dengue can spread through infected blood products and organ donation
 yadi dengue se sankramit vyakti rakt daan yaa ang daan karata he, jo kisi anya vyakti ko diya jaataa he, is vyakti ko daan diye gayi rakt yaa ang se dengue ho saktaa he
 Dengue is common in some countries such as Singapore
 in deshon main, 10,000 rakt aadhanon main se 1
6 se 6 tak dengue failaate hai
 Dengue virus can also spread from mother to child during pregnancy or while giving birth to a child
 dengue aamtaur par kinhi or tareekon se nahin failata he
 Infants and children are more likely to develop the disease severity than adults with dengue
 bachche yadi acchhee tarah se poshit hon to unke gambhir rup se biimaar hone kii adhik sambhaavna he 
 Men are more prone to serious illness than women
 puraani kii bimaariyaan jaise madhumeh tathaa asthma vaale logon main dengue jivan ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 When a mosquito bites a person, its saliva enters the human skin
 yadi machhar ko dengue he to virus isaki laar main hota he
 Therefore, when a mosquito bites a person, the virus enters the person's skin along with the mosquito's saliva
 virus vyakti kii shwet rakt kanikaon se jud kar unamem pravesh kar jaataa he 
 The virus regenerates when white blood cells move around the body
 shwet rakt kanikaayen kai tarah ke sanketon protein ke madhyam se pratikriya karti hai jaise interlukins, interferon tathaa tumor parigalan kaarak
 Dengue causes fever, flu-like symptoms and severe pain due to these proteins
 yadi kisi vyakti ko gambhir sankraman hai to virus uske sharir main or adhik teji se badhata he
 Because the number of viruses is very high, it can affect many more organs
 choti rakt keshikaon kii deevaaron se rakt ris karke sharir ke cotaron main chalaa jaataa he
 For this reason there is less blood flow to the blood capillaries
 vyakti kaa raktchaap itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki hriday mahatvapurn angon ko paryaapt rakt kii aapurti nahin kar paata he
 Also, the bone marrow does not produce enough platelets, which is necessary to make a blood clot
 paryaapt platelets ke bina, vyakti ko raktasrav hone kii samasya hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 Bleeding is the main complication caused by dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar aamtaur par sankramit vyakti kii jaanch karke or yah dekh kar ki uske lakshan dengue se milte hai, dengue kaa nidaan karte hai
 Healthcare professionals may thus be particularly capable of diagnosing dengue in areas where it typically occurs
 halanki, jab dengue praarambhik avasthaa main hota he to ise anya viral sankramanon se alag kar paanaa kathin hota he
 Dengue can possibly occur when a person has fever and has two of the following symptoms: nausea and vomiting; Red spots; General pain; Reduced number of white blood cells; Or positive tourniquet test
 ve kshetra jahaan par yah biimaar aam he vahaan par koi bhi chetavanee chihn tathaa bukhaar is baat kaa sanket he ki vyakti ko dengue he
 Warning signs usually appear before dengue becomes severe
 turnicket pareekshan tab kaaphi hota he jab koi prayogshaala pareekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In a tourniquet test, a healthcare professional ties the blood pressure measuring device strap around the person's arms for 5 minutes
 phir yadi us vyakti kii twachaa par laal dhabbe dikhen to swasthya seva peshewar unki ginati karata he
 The higher the number of spots, the more likely a person is to have dengue fever
 chikangunia tathaa dengue bukhaar ke bich antar karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Chikungunya is a viral infection that has similar symptoms as dengue and it also occurs in those parts of the world
 dengue ke lakshan anya bimariyon malaria, leptopyrosis, typhoed bukhaar tathaa meningocokkal rog jaise ho sakate hai
 Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their healthcare professionals will do some tests to make sure that the person does not suffer from one of these conditions
 jab kisi vyakti ko dengue hota he to uski shwet rakt kanikaon kii kam sankhya kaa prayogshaala pareekshan main dikhnaa sabase pehla parivartan dekha ja saktaa he
 Low platelet counts and metabolic acidosis are also symptoms of dengue
 yadi vyakti ko gambhir dengue he to aise anya badlaav bhi honge jo rakt kaa adhyayan karne par dekhe ja sakate hai
 Severe dengue can cause fluid leakage from blood streams
 jiske kaaran hemokonsontrishan ho saktaa he
 It also reduces albumin levels in the blood
 kabhi-kabhaar gambhir dengue adhik phuffus pravaah yaa jalodar bhi utpann karata he
 If its volume is sufficient, the healthcare professional may observe it at the time of the patient's testing
 koi swasthya seva peshewar dengue ke shock syndrome ko pehle hi dekh saktaa he yadi vah sharir ke bheetar dravya dekhne ke liye chikitsiya ultrasound kaa upyog kar sake
 But in many areas where dengue is common, most healthcare professionals and clinics do not have ultrasound machines
 2009 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan nen dengue bukhaar ko do prakaaron main vargeekrut yaa vibhajit kiya: saral tathaa gambhir
 Earlier in 1997, WHO divided the disease into indistinguishable and dengue fever
 WHO ne tay kiya ki dengue bukhaar ko vibhajit karne ke is puraane tareeke ko saral karne kii zarurat he
 It also decided that the old method was quite limited: it did not include all the ways in which dengue could present itself
 halanki dengue vargeekaran kaa tarika aadhikarik rup se badla gaya tha lekin purana vargeekaran abhi bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the old method of WHO, dengue hemorrhagic fever was divided into four stages, which were called grades i – IV: dengue bukhaar kaa nidaan microbiloji sambandhi prayogshaala pareekshan dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Some different tests can also be done
 koshikaon ke culture main ek pareekshan dengue virus ko pruthak karata he
 Another test identifies nucleic acids from viruses, using a technique called polymerase chain reaction
 ek teesraa pareekshan virus ke antigen kii pahchaan karata he
 Another test identifies antibodies in the blood that give the body the ability to fight against dengue virus
 virus isolation tathaa neucleic amla pahchaan pareekshan, antigen pahchaan se behatar kaam ke hote hai
 Although these tests cost more, they are not available in many locations
 jab dengue rog apane praarambhik charnon main hota he to yah saare pareekshan nakaaratmak ho sakate hai Apart from immunological testing, these laboratory tests can only be helpful in the diagnosis of dengue fever during the acute phase of the disease
 halanki, pratirakshi pareekshan is baat kii pushti kar sakate hai ke vyakti ko dengue, sankraman kii baad kii avasthaa kaa he
 The body produces antibodies that typically fight the dengue virus 5 to 7 days later
 dengue virus se logon ko bachaane ke liye abhi tak kisi vaxin ko sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 To prevent infection, the World Health Organization has suggested controlling the mosquito population and protecting people from mosquito bites
 WHO ne dengue ke rokthaam ke liye ek kaarykram kaa suzav diya he jisamen 5 bhinn bhaag shaamil hai: The WHO also makes some specific suggestions to control mosquitoes and protect people from being bitten by it
 "adies aegypti" machhar ko niyantrit karne kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki iske nivaason se mukti paayi jaay
 People should keep empty containers of water empty
 in kshetron main machharon ko niyantrit karne ke liye kitnashkon yaa jaivik niyantran agenton kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Scientists believe that spraying of organophosphate or pyrethyroid insecticide does not help
 tehre hue pani ko samaapt karnaa chaiye kyonki yah machharon ko aakarshith karata he or isaliye bhi ki is tehre huye pani main jeevanuon ke paidaa hone se logon ko swasthya sambandhi samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 To avoid mosquito bites, people can wear clothes that completely cover their skin
 ve ketterodhiyon kaa upyog kar sakate hai, jo machharon ko dur rakhenge 
 People can also use miscarriages while resting
 is samay koi vaxin bazaar me maujuud nahin he yadhpi thailand me prayog kaaphi had tak safal rahe he
 The most effective way to prevent dengue is to control the population of mosquitoes by either controlling larvae or the population of adult mosquitoes
 adis machhar kritrim jal sangrah paatro me janan karte he jaise tair, bottlen, cooler, guladaste in jalpatro ko aksar khaali karnaa chahie yahi sabase behatar tarika larva niyantran kaa mana jaataa he
 Pesticide fumes can be effective to some extent to control adult mosquitoes, preventing mosquitoes from biting is also a way, but mosquitoes of this species bite during the day, making the case serious
 ek nayaa tarika messosaclopus naamak jaleey keet jo larva bhakshi he ko ruke jal me daal dena he jaise ki gambushia machhlee malaria ke viruddh prabhavi upaay he
 This is a very effective, inexpensive and environment friendly method, mosquitoes can never gain immunity against it, but community participation is actively needed for this
 machharadaani, riplent, sharir ko dhak ke rakhana, tathaa prabhavit kshetron se dur rahanaa
 The yellow fever of yellow fever is against a related flavivirus, it is recommended to use it in a mutated form against dengue, but no detailed study has been done in this regard
 argentina ke ek vaigyanik samooh ne 2006 me vishaanu ke prajnan tareeke ko khoj nikaala he jiske chalate aashaa kii jaati he ki uske viruddh prabhavi aushadhi khoj nikaali jaayegi
 There is no specific treatment for dengue fever
 lakshanon ke aadhaar par, bhinn logon ke liye bhinn upachaar hai
 Some people may be better off just by drinking liquid at home, with their healthcare professionals monitoring their health closely to ensure they are getting better
 kuch anya logon ko antahshira dravya yaa rakt aadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 If a person already has a problem with a complex health condition, healthcare professionals may decide to hospitalize the person
 jab kisi vyakti ko antahshira dravya kii jarurat hoti he to aam taur par unako isaki jarurat ek yaa do din ke liye ho sakati he
 The healthcare professional will increase the amount of fluid so that the person can release a specified amount of urine
 taral kii maatra isaliye bhi badhaayi ja sakati he jisase ki vyakti kii hematokrit tathaa mahatvapurn chihn saamaanya sthiti par waapas aa sake
 Due to the risk of bleeding, healthcare professionals avoid invasive medical procedures such as nasogastric intubation, intra-articular injection and puncture in the arteries
 bukhaar tathaa dard ke liye essetaminophen di ja sakati he
 a type of anti-inflammatory drug called NSAID should not be used as there is a high chance of bleeding
 yadi vyakti ke mahatvapurn chihn badalen yaa saamaanya na ho or yadi unke rakt main laal rakt kanikaon kii sankhya kam hoti ja rahi ho to rakt aadhaan ko jaldi shuru kiya janaa chaiye
 When blood transfusion is required, the person should be given whole blood or packed red blood cells
 platelets tathaa tazaa freez kiya plasma, aam taur par sanstut nahin kiya jaataa he
 When a person is in the dengue correction phase, he or she is usually not given any intravenous fluid so that the amount of fluid in his body is not high
 yadi dravya kii adhikta ho jaay lekin us vyakti ke mahatvapurn chihn sthir hon to sirf or dravya diye jane ko rokna hi paryaapt he
 If the person is not in a complicated state of the disease, he may be given loop diuretics like furosemide
 yah us vyakti ke rakt parisancharan se atirikt dravya ko baahar karne main sahaayak honge
 Most people suffering from dengue recover and do not have any problems later
 dengue se sankramit logon main 1 se 5% kii upachaar ke abhaav main mrityu ho jaati he
 Despite good treatment, less than 1% of people die
 halanki, gambhir dengue se peedit logon main se 26% kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Dengue is common in more than 110 countries
 prayek varsh, puri duniya ke 50 se 100 million log isse prabhavit hote hai
 Each year, half a million people are hospitalized and around 12,500 to 25,000 people die due to it all over the world
 dengue, sandhipadon dwaara failane vaala sabase aam viral rog he
 It is believed that over 1600 per dengue population per million of dengue has a disability adjusted life year weight
 iskaa arth he ki dengue ke kaaran prati million jansankhya main se 1600 varshon kaa jivan samaapt ho jaataa he
 This is the same as the disease burden of other childhood or tropical diseases like TB
 dengue malariake baad duusare number kii sabase mahatvapurn ushnkaribandheey beemaari he
 The World Health Organization also considers dengue one of the 16 neglected tropical diseases
 dengue puri duniya main or adhik aam hota ja rahaa he
 Dengue was 30 times more common in 2010 than in 1960
 dengue ke vistaar ke liye kai sari chijen jimmedaar hai
 More people have started living in cities
 duniya kii jansankhya bad rahi he
 More and more people are now taking international trips
 global varming ko bhi dengue ke vistaar kaa ek kaaran mana jaataa he
 Dengue is most commonly around the equator
 jahaan dengue hota he us kshetra main 2
5 billian log nivas karte hai
 70 percent of these people are from Asia and the Pacific
 america main dengue prabhavit in kshetron se yatra karke waapas aaye logon main se 2
9% se 8% log aise hai, jinako bukhaar ho jaataa he or jo yatra ke dauraan prabhavit ho jate hai
 Dengue is the second most common infection diagnosed after malaria in this group of people
 vaigyanik, dengue kii rokthaam tathaa upachaar ke margon par shodh kar rahe hai
 People are working on making vaccines to control mosquitoes and making medicines to fight the virus
 machharon ko niyantrit karne ke liye kai saral kaam kiye gayi hai
 For example gappies or coppods can be put in stagnant water to feed mosquito larvae
 vaigyanik, logon ko sabhi chaar prakaar ke dengue se surakshit karne ke liye vaxin banane par kaam kar rahe hai
 Some scientists are concerned that the vaccine may increase the risk of severe disease due to antibody-dependent increases
 sarvshereshth sambhav vaxin kii kuch bhinn gunvatttaayen hongi
 First, it will be safe

 Third, it will provide protection against all types of dengue virus

 unke pitashri ko log 'pir ji' ke naam se pukaarte the
 He was a respected person of his field

 Because of this your attachment was more than mother
 aapaki maan ek vidhushi mahila thim
 He had memorized the poetry of the great poets of Hafiz Shiraji, Saadi and Nazira in his childhood
 vah swayan bhi shaayari karti thim
 'nishtar Khanqahi's mother was a Persian student
 unhone unani chikitsa-shaastra kaa adhyayan farsi madhyam se kiya or farsi bhashaa main hi shaayari bhi kii
 He also had a Ghazal collection, which was destroyed along with the rare library of Nishtar Saheb
 ' is prakaar nishtar sahab par apni matashri kaa purna prabhaav padaa
 It was probably these rites that he met his mother in childhood that he could become a successful poet

 isi umr se unhone urdu va farsi kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 He had a special attachment to the literature of these languages
 isi kaaran unhone utkrisht shaayari kii anek pustakon kaa adhyayan kiya

 He would accept it with a heavy heart when his parents used to propel him towards sports
 nishtar ji bataate hai ki 'jab bhi gharavaale khilne ke liye vivash karte to meri majaburi hi thi ki mujhe janaa padataa tha
 'all the books related to literature and literature continued to be read day and night
 ek samay vah bhi aayaa ki unki maan tathaa nikat sambandhiyon ko yah ashanka hone lagi ki ve padhate-padhate apana swasthya na kho baithen

 ' yun to nishtar ji ne vidyalayan shiksha inter tak hi praapt kii he, kintu sahityakar kaa jivan to sadaiv adhyayan-lekhan main hi vyateet hota he
 He constantly reads new, learns new and creates new ones according to his experiences
 uski shiksha to abaadh gati se chalane vaali nadi ke samaan he
 Entering the field of literature: Ghazalakar Khanqahi had taken steps in the field of literature from his childhood
 likhane kii pratibha unamem ishwar-pradutt thi
 His mother was a good ghazalkara herself
 unka prabhaav nishtar ji par padana swaabhaavik tha
 He was involved in ghazal writing from the first decade of his age
 is sambandh main swayan nishtar ji likhte hai- 'koi aath yaa nau varsh kii aayu se kavita likhnaa aarambh kar diya tha or baarah-teraa varsh kii umr ko pahonchte-pahonchte kalam kaafii pukhtagi paa gai thi
 Usually at night, when everyone was asleep, i would meditate

 Throughout the night, a hundred lions would say, and the specialty was that only on the basis of counting, all these lions would take them out on paper in the morning
 un dinon meri yaaddaasht gazab kii thi
 On being asked by eminent Ghazalkar and critic Dr
 Giriraj Sharan Agarwal, he says - 'the idea of reading poetry was taken long ago, but it was not yet Shayari
 ek din apane makaan kii chat par patang uda rahaa tha
 a related youth was also with me
 patang udaate-udaate kehane laga ki chalo aaj ghazal likhte hai
 We stopped flying kites and started writing ghazals

 The last lion of them is still remembered today
 bacchon kii shaayari he pi r bhi aap sun len-karam main bhi khush he sitam main bhi shadanbahar taur 'nishtar' gulam aapkaa he
 After passing his inter examination, Nishtar was introduced to eminent Urdu journalist Mr
 Hamidul Ansari Ghazi
 falswaroop ve bees varsh kii avasthaa main san 1950 main bombai jaakar 'jamhuriyat' dainik samachar-patr main kaam karne lage
 Shortly thereafter, his father fell victim to an accident in the village

 He returned to Bijnor, but he did not feel here
 ve bombai main 'jamhuriyat' main rahakar sikhi patrakarita kaa upyog karnaa chaahate the
 At the same time, journalists wanted to provide a solid ground by furthering their little knowledge
 isliye ve san 1952 main dilli chale gaye
 Going to Delhi, Nistar ji got involved with various journals and magazines, which he edited efficiently with his hard work
 apane dilli-gaman evam pravaas ke sambandh main ve likhte hai- 'main 1952 ke aas-paas dilli chalaa gaya tha, jahaan mujhe pragatisheel lekhak sangh kii prasiddh patrika 'shahrah' ko sampadit karne kaa avasar mila
 It was a historical magazine in Delhi that had been edited by me before by celebrities like Sahir Ludhianvi, Fikar Tousvi, Makhmur Jalandhari, Zoë Ansari and Vamik Jaunpuri
 baad main main suprasiddh urdu masik 'beesvin sadi' se sambandh ho gaya

 Khashtar Girmi, had a problem with something
 isliye 'beesvin sadi' main kaam karnaa chhodir, doston dwaara prarambh kii gai patrika 'mushahida' kaa sampadan-kaary sanbhaala
 The publication of 'mushahida' magazine could be done only for a short period of one and a half years
 is prakaar vibhinn saahitiyik sansthaaon or patrikaon se judqar to kabhi faqamasti ke din vyateet karke nishtar ji ne apni jindagi ke solah varsh dilli main bitaye
 Jeevadayini living in a free environment on the banks of the Ganges, Nistar ji, who watched the ganga-cachar far away, did not like the colorful life of Delhi, which is something else from inside, nothing else from outside
 unka swasthya kharaab hone laga or ve solah varsh tak dilli kii vibhinn saahitiyik gatividhiyon main sakriy bhagidaari karke saare vaataavaraan ko mahakaakar, gathiya rog se peedit hokar pun: bijanour laut aae
 Since then he has been associated with many literary institutions in Bijnor
 bijanour mukhyalay se prakashit hone vaale dainik samachar patron 'bijanour times', bijanour times urdu or 'chingaari' se lambey samay tak jude rahe
 Presently, Nishtar Saheb is engaged in literary practice independently
 or ab yahi unka dhyey he, yahi unka mishan bhi ki jivan kii antim saans tak ve sahitya-sadhana main nirat rahen
 On the psychological plane, it is accepted that the physical and mental qualities of each creature are mostly inherited
 saath hi is satya kii bhi avhelnaa nahin kii ja sakati ki vaataavaran, deshkal evam bhugolic paristhatiyon kaa bhi us par prabhaav padataa he
 Ghazalkar Nishtar Khanqahi's personality has had an impact on his environment, as well as the poetic talent he has inherited from his family, especially from the mother
 ' is baat se swayan khaanqaahi ji bhi sahamat dikhaai dete hai- 'mujhe apni maan kii viraasat se jo kuch mila he, usamen shaayari or sahitya ke prati lagan to he hi, vipareet paristhitiyon or dukh-bhare halaat ko bardaasht karne kaa gun bhi he
 i have more stamina than ordinary people
 meri bardaasht kaa band aasaani se nahin tuutata
 'nishtar Khanqahi tells an interesting story regarding his naming
 vastav main aarambh main unka naam anawaar hossain tha
 Anwar Hussain started shayari from the first decade of his age
 nau varsh kii umr main jab unhone apane ek mitra ke saath milakar ghazal likhane kaa prayaas kiya to us samay upnaam rakhane ke liye 'nishtar' naam unke mitra ne hi unhen sujhaayaa
 'though Nishtar ji got the talent for shayari from his mother
 patrakarita, vyangy, ekanki, kahani, kavita evam anya prakaar kii lekhan-pratibha unhen uttaradhikaar main nahin mili, kintu yah unke lambey saahitiyik sangharsh, vibhinn sahityakaron, rachanakaaron se sampark tathaa swa-arjeet gyaan kaa pratifal he
 Rich scholar of literature-surgeon-oriented talent, Nishtar Khanqahi along with Urdu are the pillars of Hindi literature
 unke bahuaiami vyaktitv-krititv se hindi-sahitya evam urdu-sahitya samrudh hua he
 Nishtar has embellished Hindi literature with both prose-verse genres

 You have introduced your multi-dimensional talent in literature through literary genres like Ghazals, Ekanki, Criticism, Articles, Story, satire-essays etc
 dow minaa agarwal unke lekhan ke sambandh main likhti hai- 'nishtar sahab ke srijan kaa kshetra ek nahin he balki yah kahie ki sahitya kii koi bhi aisi vidha nahin he, jisamen unhone likhaa na ho, chaahe kavita ho yaa kahani
 Even in his editors, accurate depictions of today's conditions are found
 ' prakhyat sahityakar dow girirajsharan agarwal do dashak se bhi adhik samay se nishtar ji ke atyant nikat rahe hai
 He also considers Nishtar ji as his poetry guru
 dow agarwal ne khaanqaahi ji kii prayek sam-visham paristhiti ko atyant nikatataa se dekha he
 At the same time his literary talent is deeply felt
 isiilie ve kehete hai- 'agar main kahoon ki nishtar khaanqaahi, jinhone ek shaayar yaa gazalkaar ke rup main khyaati praapt kii, maatr ek shaayar yaa gazalkaar hi nahin, ve ek safal kahanikar, naatakkaar balki gadhy kii lagbhag har vidha main samaan adhikaar ke saath likhane vaale sahityakar hai, to aapmen se bahut se pathakon ko aashcharya hoga
 Mr
 Khanqahi not only wrote nazams, ghazals, or poems, but also wrote stories, dramas, essays, articles of political references, sketches, satire, in almost all genres of prose and did it with full scale
 yah baat or he ki apni kavy-pustakon ke prakaashan se ve ek shaayar ke rup main to prasiddh hue kintu gadhy ke aprakashit rah jane ke kaaran yaa kam prakashit hone kaaran sahitya ke anya kshetron main vah sthaan praapt nahin kar sake, jo unhen milanaa chahie tha
 'while Khanqahi is a well-known poet and poet, he gave his literary introduction as a storyteller when his story' Maryam 'in the then famous literary magazine' Twentieth Century 'in 1950-51
 Was published
 yah kahani itani shashakt thi ki kahani tathaa sampadak ko bheje patr par ve anjaane main apana naam likhnaa bhi bhul gaye the, kintu kahani keval gaanv ke naam ke saath prakashit hui
 The fact of forgetting to write his name on the story is a reflection of Mr
 Khanqahi's sense of carelessness and disinterest in his creations
 sach yah he ki vah apni rachanaaon ke prati hameshaa se bahut adhik laaparvaah bane rahe hai
 No one knows where he has gone, as he has written, in prose or verse, throughout his literary life
 ek bhent main unhone bataaya tha ki yuvavastha main unhone urdu main kuch lambey kavy-naatak likhe the, inamen 'shaitan baksha gaya' or 'farishte khuda ke darbar main' prakashit hokar prasiddh bhi hue kintu unka ab kuch ata-pataa nahin
 It is normal for Nishtar Saheb to write in any genre, but there is an effective aspect of his personality that his vision always rests on the man and his inner man, society and the society within him, which makes the reality of art It presents in beautiful form
 iskaa sateek pramaan unki kahani 'aadha haath puraa jivan' he
 The heroine of the story, Miria Simon, does not want to make herself eligible for the mercy of society even after being disabled, struggles herself and says- 'people have mercy on me, do not praise my courage
 kya dharm kaa arth yahi he ki dusron ko hin samajhakar, kamazor samajhakar, nissahay samajhakar, shashakt log apane ahan kii tripti karte rahen
 God forgive me

 'sir Nishtar Khanqahi is a multi-talented talent creator
 ve apanepan ke bhav se aapurit vyakti hai evam rachanakaaron ke sachche maardarshak hai
 Nishtar ji is a very sensitive person
 ve kehete hai- 'mausi ne pramanit kiya tha ki maan ke pet se hi main itnaa samvedansheel tha, jitne aam bachche saadharantaya nahin hote hai
 How much of this sensitivity later added to my personality, this story is very long
 ' nishtar ji kii samvedansheeltaa itani gahari he ki ve isi kaaran jivan main anek kashton ko bhi sehate rahe hai
 He did not even oppose what he should have opposed, but kept feeling silent and dissolving inside himself, persisting in discipline on his own
 ve likhte hai- 'apane jivan main mere liye sabase bada abhishaap meraa samvedansheel hona rahaa he
 My character's weakness and fear-mongering hawthorn was born from this sensibility
 samvedansheel na hota, keval bhavuk hota to halaat athwa apane-paraayon ke vyavhaar kii pratikriya main chikh saktaa tha, shor machaa saktaa tha, vidroh kar saktaa tha
 But i could not do it, because the instinct of a sensitive man is to feel silent and dissolve for long
 vah bhadqata nahin dhire-dhire sulagta he or antat: swayan apni hi aag main jal-bujhakar raakh ho jaataa he
 'nishtar ji hates lies and false speech, deceit
 apni balyavastha se hi ve in durgunon se dur rahe hai
 For any greed or self-fulfillment, he did not take the side of wrong, anti-socialists
 ve sahruday evam nishpaksh sahityakar hai
 The quality of Nishtar ji is, to stay away from any kind of cleverness, manipulation
 ve sadaiv chapaluson se alag rahe hai-chalan chapaluson main sach kaa na thaso hamane swayan ko nilambit kiya
 Among the current writers is a senior and prominent name - Nishtar Khanqahi ji
 dublaa-patala sharir, thodi jhuki qamar, lekin aise vyaktitv ke swami ki dekhakar hi naam kaa arth samaj main aa jaae
 The height of Nishtar ji is neither too tall nor short, the owner of a tall saddle, white pajamas with wide seal, baskets on top of kurtas and kurtas, hair straightening behind the back, flat forehead, right, rickshaw found , If not found, then on foot of a road, there is no rickshaw on foot, that is, do not have to wait for any kind
 vastut: yahi siddhant nishtar ji ne apane jivan main apanaaya he, kuch praapt ho athwa nahin, kintu sahitya ke kshetra main vividh ayaamon main gatisheel rahe hai
 Dr
 Meena Agarwal writes the name of Nishtar Khanqahi in literary form- 'nastar or Nishtar means rip-off machine
 sahitya main cheer-faad shabdon ke str par bhi hoti he
 The poetry of Nishtar Saheb is also such a dance that binds itself in the heart of the reader
 unki shaayari hriday ko chune vaali he
 'nishtar ji has a tendency and quality, to believe in everyone easily
 unke sampark main yadi koi vyakti pehali baar bhi aata he, to ve uski baton main, usamen vishwaas kar lete hai
 Due to this many times they have to be hurt, they have also cheated
 ve keval dukhi hokar kehete hai-jindagi se sikh leen, hamane bhi duniyaadaariyanraftaa-raftaa tumme bhi mauqaa-parasti aa gai kyonki nishtar ji kaa swaabhaavik gun he dusron par sahaj rup main vishwaas kar lenaa
 They are always searching for belongingness in their old relationships
 unhone sadaiv sangharsh kiya
 Whether it is social field or literary field
 unhone til-til jalakar jindagi ko jeena siikhaa he
 In fact, he is a rich man of life - after having learned how to make fire with learned skills, he has always seen the fire of the house on paper, with respect to the female race
 unhone uske jivan kii pidaa ko nikatataa se samajha he
 That anguish is expressed in his stories, poems, plays etc
 prakhyat urdu shaayar izhaar asar nishtar ji ko chhathi indriya kaa shaayar bataate hue unke vyaktitv par prakaash daalate hue likhte hai- 'nishtar is yug ke jite-jaagate samvedansheel insaan hai or is yug kii jitani samasyaayen ho sakati hai, nishtar un sabase guzare hai
 Grief of self, grief of employment, grief of one's own people, grief of relationships and relationships
 taatpary yah he ki dukh jitne bhi ho sakate hai, nishtar ne un sabakaa swaad liya he
 'in fact, Khanakhi is a rich man of such a fighting personality who does not deviate, scream and shout at any level even after taking the arrows of the body and soul to the depths of the sorrow, but like a philosopher of this age
 Reviewing the relationship and moving on its path
 nishtar sahab kii ek pahchaan yah bhi he ki ve dharmik str par koi bhedbhaav nahin rakhte hai
 His thinking has always risen above caste-caste and social discrimination to a practical level
 kintu ve swayan ko aasthavan bhi sweekaarte hai
 His own statement is - 'literature and scientific thinking have taught me and many others like me to think and behave above religion, caste, caste and social discrimination
 aap chahen to mere vyaktitv main ek arddh naastik pahalu jod sakate hai, jiske bheetar kahin-na-kahin aasthavan chor chipa he, lekin jo dharmik bhedbhaav se purnataya alag he, jo aadmi ko dharm, jati yaa anya kisi kaane main rakhkar nahin dekhtaa
 Human is human to him first and finally human too, who accepts him with all his weaknesses and strengths
 ' nishtar sahab saamaajik str par aasthavan bhi hai or dharm main bhi aasthaa rakhte hai, lekin buddhi ke str par dharm main ve koi aasthaa nahin rakhte hai
 They believe that just as materialists have made power the basis for their power, similarly those who establish spiritual power tried to establish a system that is more powerful than before, with their conscience and mental strength
 isi sandarbh main apni rachana 'kaise-kaise log mili' main likhte hai- 'buddhi ke str par meri kisi bhi dharm main koi aasthaa nahin he
 i think, just as those who establish physical power have kept the people under control by working with their power, in the same way, those who establish spiritual power, by working with their conscience and mental power, made such a big system, even from the first system
 It was far more powerful and then these two powers combined to make man root and slave
 ' 'I am a very soft-hearted man
 mom kii tarah jald pigal jane vaala
 The feeling of compassion is filled in my vein
 agar aap kabhi koi dukh-bhari kahani padhate hue, pi lm kaa koi dardila drishy dekhte hue sabase aankh bachaakar apane roomaal se ansu ponchhate dekh len to hairat na karen
 My eyes spill too soon
 ateet kii yaaden mujhe ekant main bhi rulaa detii hai
 Many times i have thought that if my heightened sensitivity was not controlled by intelligence, then i could have committed suicide without facing any unbearable situation due to the weakness of my nature
 lekin mujhe komalhridayata ke saath asaadhaaran sahanshakti to mili hi, saath main vivek se kaam lene kii kshamta bhi xxrep 7 
 isliye main kharaab se kharaab haal main main jivit rahaa
 'it is the sensitivity of Nishtar ji, who not only feel his own but also feel the pain of every misery of the society, that is why he writes -' There is a threat, there is a window, my eyes are somewhere, dripping pentoon is mine
 ' shaayar izhaar asar zanaab nishtar khaanqaahi kii samvedansheeltaa par prakaash daalate hue likhte hai- 'nishtar atyadhik samvedansheel shaayar hai isiilie unki rachanaaon main samakaleen chetana apni puri prakharata ke saath vidyaman he
 Their existence is like a sensitive photographic plate
 jis tarah photograpi k plate us par padane vaale har prakaash kaa pratibimb khinchakar uskaa chitra ubhaar detii he, usee prakaar nishtar kii jindagi har dukh, har sukh, har rang, har chaaya, har andheraa, har kiran arthath har sthiti ko aatmsaat kar leti he or pi r us anubhuti ko shabd-chitra ke rup main ubhaar detii he
 'astu, the life of Ghazalkar, litterateur and senior journalist Zanab Nishtar Khanqahi, who was in the seventh decade of his age, started from a very rural environment that reached Delhi, Bombay, but returned back to his home district headquarters and remained here
 
 lautne ke baad apni sahitya-sadhana main leen ho gaya, jo aaj bhi sadhnarat he
 We wish that multidisciplinary talent-rich litterateur Nishtar Khanakhi can get longevity and continue to enrich Hindi literature
 prakhyat sameekshak, naatakkaar, gazalkaar or vyangyakaar nishtar khaanqaahi ke saahitiyik krititv kii ore drushti daalate hai to vah jahaan vistrut rup main failaa he, vahiin uplabdh kritiyon kii drushti se ungliyon main gina ja saktaa he
 a person who has started writing from the first decade of his life and who has been writing at an uninterrupted pace for seven decades of life, it is a matter of surprise and astonishment if his works are available in such small quantities
 itane lambey saahitiyik jivan main bhi nishtar kaa itnaa kam sahitya kyon uplabdh he? yah prashn sahaj jigyaasa kaa vishay he
 There are two reasons behind this
 unhone apni rachanaaon kii koi prati apane paas nahin rakhi
 They do not have any copy of the works published in All India Radio or published in newspapers and magazines - metaphors, stories, articles, nazams or ghazals
 doosraa kaaran to or bhi kshtprad he
 In his words- 'disappointed with the search for masters, when i considered the practice and books as my master, every year a large collection of compositions would be prepared, but every year i would set myself on fire
 yah silsilaa lagbhag bees varsh tak chalata rahaa
 Each manuscript ranged from five hundred to seven hundred pages

 The life cycle of Nishtar ji continued to progress with the speed of time, going from two to four different problems of life
 ab yadi ham unke rachana-sansar main jhaankane kaa prayaas karte hai to hindi bhashaa main prakashit unki nimnlikhit kritiyaan uplabdh hai- 1

 Mars has two relatively small natural moons, Phobos and Dimose, whose orbit is closer to the planet
 kshudragrah par kabja ek zyada samarthit siddhant he lekin isaki utpatti anishchit bani hui he
 Both satellites were discovered by Asaf Hall in 1877 and were named after the characters Phobos and Dimos, who, in battle in Greek mythology, accompanied their father, the god of war, Eris
 aries rome ke logon ke liye mangal grah ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 From the surface of Mars, the movements of Phobos and Demos appear to be quite different from our own moon
 phobose pashchim main udai hota he, purv main ast hota he or maatr 11 ghante baad phir se udit hota he
 There is a slightly outward synchronous orbit of the dimose, that is, its orbital period corresponds to its rotation period, as it rises in the east but very slowly

 Since Phobos' orbit is below synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually shortening its orbit
 lagbhag 5 karod varsh main yah yaa to mangal kii sataha main durghatnagrast ho jayega yaa grah ke chaaron ore challe ke rup main tuutakar bikhar jayega
 The origins of both moons are not well understood, due to the low albedo and carbonized condrite structure that is thought to be similar to an asteroid, which supports the theory of grabbing
 phobose kii asthir kaksha ek apekshaakrit haal hi main hathiyaane kii pravriti kii ore ingit prathit hoti he
 But the orbits of both are circular, very close to the equator, which is very unusual for forcibly stripped bodies and also complicates the necessary acquisition dynamics

 duusari ore, aadhiky-utpaadit maal ke maamle main, anukulit niyantran system ghatakon kii kam keemat ke kaaran kifayati hai, jinhen ek "saamaanya" hal kii bajaay sarvotkrisht rup se chunaa ja saktaa he or jaha gaiyr-punaravarti ejineering qeemat hajaaron yaa lakhon ikaayiyon main faili hoti he
 Various techniques are used for high-volume or very easy scheduled automation tasks
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta dishvashr ek vidyut-yantric kem timer dwaara niyantrit kiya jayega, jisaki laagat utpaadan maatra main keval kuch dollar hogi
 a microcontroller-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units would be generated and thus the cost of development could be spread across multiple sales and where the end user would not need to change the controls
 automotive aavedan ek udhaaharan he, prayek varsh lakhon ikaiyaan banaai jaati hai or bahut kam ant upyogkarta in niyantrakon kii programing ko badalte hai
 However, some special transports such as transit buses use economical PLC rather than specially designed controls, as they are smaller in volume and development costs would be uneconomical

 Very high speeds or precise controls may also require customized solutions, for example, aircraft flight control
 programable niyantrak gati niyantran, sthaapan niyantran or tark niyantran main vyapak rup se upyog kiye jate hai
 Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be compiled with PLC so that the G-code can be used in ordering machine movements
 PLC main ekal-parivartaneey feedback analog niyantran loop ke liye laajik, ek "anupatik, sampurna, sanjaat" yaa "PID niyantrak" shaamil ho saktaa he
 For example, a PID loop can be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process
 aitihaasik rup se, PLC saadharantah keval kuch analog niyantran loop ke saath configar kiye jate the, jaha prakriyaaon ko saikadon yaa hajaaron loop kii aavashyaktaa hoti, vahaan isaki jagah ek vitarit niyantran system istemaal ho jaati

 Digital or discrete signals behave as binary switches and easily generate an on or off signal
 Push buttons, limit switches, and photoelectric sensors are examples of devices providing a discrete signal
 asatat sanket yaa to voltage, yaa bijli ke prayog se bheje jate hai, jaha ek vishisht shrenee on ke rup main niyukt kii jaati he or duusari of ke
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek PLC sambhawatah 24 v DC i / o upyog kar sakati he, jisamen 22 v DC ke upar ke mulya on darshaate hai, 2VDC se neeche ke mulya of or madhyavarti mulya anishchit hote hai
 Initially, the PLC had only discrete i / O
 analog sanket maatra niyantran kii tarah hai, jinamein shunya or purna paimaane ke bich mulyon kii ek pankti he
 These are typically translated as integer values by the PLC, depending on the different range of accuracy or number of bits available on the device and to store data
 kyunki PLC aamtaur par 16 bit sankethik binary procesar upyog karte hai, isliye purnank mulya -32,768 or +32,767 ke bich simit hai
 Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals
 analog sanket, prakriya sanket ke mulya se anupatik gurutv kii voltage yaa bijli kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, an analog 4-20 ma or 0 - 10 v input would be converted to an integer value of 0 - 32767
 maujuuda nivesh vidyut awaz ke sambandh main voltage nivesh, se kam samvedansheel hai
 For example, suppose a facility needs to collect water in a tank
 zarurat padane par, pani ek anya system dwaara tanks se khinchaa jaataa he or hamaare udahaaran system ke liye tanks ke jal str kaa prabandhan karnaa aavashyak he
 Using only digital signals, the PLA has two digital inputs from the float switch
 When the water level is above the switch, it closes a contact and sends the signal to an input
 PLC, tanks main pravesh valve ko kholane or band karne ke liye digital nirgam kaa upyog karata he
 When the level of the water gets low enough that the float switch at the bottom level closes, then the PLC will open the valve so that more water comes in
 Once the water level rises high enough so that the switch to the top level is turned on, the PLC will close the entrance to prevent water from flowing out
 yah seedhi sil-in laajik kaa ek udhaaharan he
 This output remains closed until a situation breaks the circuit
 ek analogus system ek pani kasaav sensor yaa ek baari cell or ek tenk ke baahar tapakaav karte samyojya kaa prayog kar saktaa he, valve pani ko dhire dhire vaapis tenk main samyojit kar detaa he
 This system incorporates PLC "hysteresis", which basically creates a "deadband" of activity, to prevent 'flutter' adjustments that can break the valve
 ek takanisian is deadband ko samyojit kar detaa he to valve rate main keval ek mahatvapurn badlaav ke liye chalata he
 This in turn reduces the speed of the valve, reducing its rigidity
 ek asli system donon drushtikon kaa gathbandhan kar saktaa he, jisamen flot switch or saral valve kaa upyog chhalkaav rokane ke liye hota he or ek rate sensor or rate valve kaa phir se bharne ke rate ko anukultam karne env pani ke haimer ko rokane ke liye
 Backup and maintenance methods can make a real system very complex

 According to Shrivallabhacharyaji, there are three acceptable elements - Brahma, Jagat and Jeeva
 brahm ke teen swaroop varnit hai- aadhidaivik, aadhyatmik evam antaryami rup
 Purshottam Sri Krishna, who has infinite divine qualities, while accepting Parabrahma as his sweet form and pastimes, is considered the source of the manifestation of bliss in life
 jagat brahm kii lila kaa vilaas he
 The entire creation is Brahma's self-work for Leela
 bhagwaan shrikrishna ke anugrah ko pushti kaha gaya he
 The devotion arising from this special grace of God is called ‘affirmation’
 jeevon ke teen prakaar hai- pushti jeev jo bhagwaan ke anugrah par nirbhar rahete hue nityalila main pravesh ke adhikari banate hai), maryaada jeev or pravaah jeev 
 Lord Shri Krishna performs regular sports in Vaikuntha for the sake of devotees
 isi vyapee vaikuntha kaa ek khand he- golok, jisamen yamuna, vrindavan, nikunj va gopiyaan sabhi nity vidyaman hai
 Through the Bhagavadseva, the entry of God into the continual pastimes of creation is the best speed of the living being
 premalakshana bhakthi ukt manorath kii purti kaa maarg he, jis ore jeev kii pravriti maatr bhagavadnugrah dwaara hi sambhav he
 This is the basic principle of the affirmation of Shri Manmahaprabhu Vallabhacharyaji
 pushti-bhakthi kii teen uttarottar avasthaaen hai-prem, aasakti or vyasan
 In Maryada-bhakti, Bhagavadpraप्रi is achieved by Shammadamadi means, but in affirmation-bhakti, the devotee does not need any means, but only has the shelter of Bhagavadkripa
 maryaada-bhakthi sweekaarya karte hue bhi pushti-bhakthi hi shreshth maani gai he
 It is a constant state of mind in God
 pushtibhakti kaa lakshan yah he ki bhagwaan ke swaroop kii prapti ke atirikt bhakt anya kisi fal kii aakanksha hi na rakhe
 The creation of the confirmatory organism is Bhagavat Sevartha - Bhagavadrup Sevartha Tatsrishtarnanayatha Bhave
 prempurvak bhagavatsevabhakti kaa yatharth swaroop he-bhaktisch prempurvikaseva
 On the Bhagwati basis, Lord Krishna is always eternal, memorable and noteworthy - brahm ke saath jeev-jagat kaa sambandh nirupan karte hue unka mat tha ki jeev brahm kaa sadansh he, jagat bhi brahm kaa sadansh he
 Due to the absence of difference between fraction and Anshi, there is mutual inequality between jiva-jagat and Brahma
 antar maatr itnaa he ki jeev main brahm kaa anandansh aavrutt rahata he, jabaki jad jagat main iske anandansh va chaitanyansh donon hi aavrutt rahete hai
 In contrast to Sree Sankaracharya's monotheism, Kevaladvaita, in Srivallabhacharya's monotheism, rejecting the relation of Maya, describing Brahma as the cause and the living world as his work, and rendering the unity of the three pure elements, the above opinion is called Shuddhavaitaism
