 1947 main angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke pehle or baad main jammu evam kashmir kii riyasat par naye bane dono rashtron main se ek main vilay kaa baari dabaav tha
 According to the document of the agreement on the partition of India, the kings of the princely states had the right to choose one of the two nations, but Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Kashmir, wanted to keep his princely state independent and refrained from joining any nation
 angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke baad riyasat par riyasat par pakistani sainiko or pashtuno ke kabeelai ladaako ne hamalaa kar diya
 Fearing that the princely army would not be able to face them, the Maharaja sought military assistance from India
 bharat ne sainik sahaayta ke evaj main kashmir ke bharat main vilay kii shart rakh di
 Upon the assent of the Maharaja, India recognized this merger and made the princely state a new state in the name of Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya sena kii tukadiyaan turant rajya kii raksha ke liye tainaat kar di gayi
 But Pakistan disagreed on the validity of this merger
 chunki jati aadhaarit aankade uplabdh nahin the isaliye maharaj ke bharat se vilay ke peeche kya kaaran the yah tay paanaa kathin tha
 Pakistan argued that the Maharaja did not have the right to call the Indian Army because before the arrival of the British there was no post of the Maharaja of Kashmir and this post was appointed by the British only
 isaliye pakistan ne yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya par uske sena pramukh duglas greysi ne is aashay ke pakistani pradhanmantri kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya
 His reasoning was that the Indian forces occupying Kashmir were representing the British state and hence they could not fight it
 haalanki baad main pakistan ne senaayen bhej di par tab tak bharat kareeb kareeb do tihaayi kashmir par kabja kar chukaa tha This war was within the boundaries of the pre-jammu and Kashmir princely state, the Indian Army paramilitary force and the armies of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state and the Pakistan Army paramilitary force and the tribal fighters of the North West Frontier State of Pakistan who called themselves as the Army of Azad Kashmir
 Was fought between prarambh main purv jammu or kashmir riyasat kii sena aaazaad kashmir ke kabeelai ladaako ke shruwati hamalo ke liye taiyaar nahin thi use keval seemaa kii rakhwali ke liye bahut kam sankhya main tainaat kiya gaya tha isaliye unki raksha pranali akraman ke saamne turant dhah gayi or unki kuch tukadiya dushmano se ja mili
 The tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir were busy in looting after the initial successes, and they proceeded to delay attacking the easily occupied new territories, and the Indian army was flown in as soon as the Maharaja agreed to merge with India
 With the help, he gave a chance to reach the soldiers
 1947 ke ant tak kashmir main kabja karne ke pakistani abhiyaan kii hawa nikal gayi
 Only in the upper parts of the Himalayas, a Pakistani army called Azad Kashmir received some successes, but finally they were repulsed from the outer part of Leh in June 1998
 puure 1948 ke dauraan dono paksho ke bich anek choti ladaaiyaan hui par kisi ko bhi koi mahtvapurn samrik safalata nahin mili or dhire dhire ek seemaa jise aaj niyantran rekha ke naam se janaa jaataa he sthapit ho gai
 a formal cease-fire was declared on 31 December 1948
 is yuddh ko das bhaago main bata ja saktaa he
 These parts are as follows
 shuruwati hamale kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir ghati or iske pramukh shahar srinagar ke niyantran ko apane haath main lenaa tha
 The summer capital of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was Srinagar and the winter capital was Jammu
 mujjafarabad or domel main tainaat riyasat kii sena turant hi aaazaad kashmir sena naam kii pakistani sena se haar gayi or srinagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Instead of occupying Srinagar before the princely army regrouped, the Azad Kashmir Army engaged in capturing frontier cities and looting and other atrocities from its inhabitants
 poonch kii ghati main riyasat kii sena peeche hat kar shahro main kendrit ho gayin or unako kai mahino ke baad bhartiya sena gheraa bandi se mukt karaayaa
 After the merger of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir with India, India brought troops and equipment to Srinagar by plane
 vahaan pahunch kar unhone riyasat kii sena ko majboot kiya or srinagar ke chaaro ore rk suraksha gheraa banaaya or aaazaad kashmir sena ko haraa diya
 This security circle also included the rear-circulating of the opponents by armored vehicles of the Indian Army
 harkar peeche hatati hui pakistani sena kaa baraamula or uri tak peechha karke in dono shahro ko mukt kara liya gaya haalanki poonch ghati main pakistani sena ke dwaara shahro kii gheraa bandi jari rahi
 The tribal army of Azad Kashmir joined Gilgit's paramilitary force in Gilgit and the army of Mehtar Jagirdar of Chitral also joined it after his Jagirdar announced his merger with Pakistan
 bhartiya sena ne aaazaad kashmir kii sena kaa uri or baraamula par kabje ke baad peechha karnaa band kar diya or ek sahaayta tukdi ko dakshin disha main poonch kii gheraa bandi todane ke prayaas main bheja
 Although the support troops reached Poonch, she could not break the siege and she was also trapped
 ek duusari sahaayta tukdi kotli tak pahuch gayi par use apana kotli kii morchabandi ko chhodkar peeche hatana padaa isi bich mirpur par aaazaad kashmir kii sena kaa kabja ho gaya
 The army of Pakistan / Azad Kashmir captured Jhanger and then attacked Nakhera on Nakhera

 The Azad Kashmir Army closed the cordon of Skardu in the north

 Indians attacked and captured Tithwal in Kashmir valley
 unche himalay ke kshetron main aaazaad kashmir kii sena ko acchhee badhat mil rahi thi
 They infiltrated the troops and laid siege on Kargil and defeated the Indian military squads going to help Skardu
 bhartiya sena balo ne kashmir ghati main hamalaa jari rakhaa or uttar kii ore aage batch kar keran or gurants par kabja kar liya
 He repulsed a counter-attack done on Tithwal
 poonch ghati main poonch main fasee bhartiya tukdi gheraabandi todakar kuch samay ke liye bahari duniya se waapas jud gayi
 For a long time, the contingent of the princely Kashmir state was still successful in protecting Skardu from Gilgit Scout, so the Pakistani army was not able to move towards Leh
 agast main chitral kii sena ne mata-ul-mulk ke netrutv main scardu par hamalaa kar diya or topakhane kii madad se scardu par kabja kar liya
 This led to Gilgit Scout going further towards Ladakh
 is samay ke dauraan niyantran rekha sthapit hone lagi thi or dono paksho main apane niyantran vaale kshetron kii raksha kaa zyada mahatv tha banisbat kii hamalaa karne ke
 During this time, only one important campaign was carried out, this was the campaign Duck which was for the possession of Dras by the Indian Balos
 During this time the siege on Poonch continued
 ab bhartiya sena sabhi kshetron par pakistani sena or usase samarthit aaazaad kashmir sena par baari hone lagi thi
 Poonch was liberated from a year-long siege and the Indian Army liberated Kargil by chasing him down after finally defeating him by the Gilgit Scout, who had been achieving good success so far, but the Indian Army was forced to attack further
 The problem of supply of logistics could have come, so they had to stop the Pakistan Army was not expecting the tank to capture the Zojila Pass with the help of tanks
 And have uprooted their feet immediately
 tanks kaa istemaal burma yuddh se mili anubhav ke kaaran hi sambhav ho paaya tha
 After occupying this pass, Dras was easily captured
 ladaai ke is daur main pahunchane par bhartiya pradhanmantri ne maamle ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main le ja kar unke dwaara maamle kaa samaadhaan karwaane kaa man bana liya
 a ceasefire was declared by the United Nations on 31 December 1948
 yuddh viraam hone se kuch dinon pehle pakistani sena ne ek pratiakraman karke uri or poonch ke bich ke raste par kabja karke dono ke bich sadak sampark tod diya
 After a long negotiation, both sides agreed to a ceasefire
 is yudhviram kii sharten agast 13, 1948 ko sanyukt raashtra ne apanaaya
 In this, Pakistan was proposed to remove its regular and irregular personnel completely and India should have the necessary troops to implement law and order in the state
 is shart ke puraa hone par janamat sangrah karke rajya ke bhavishya or malikana haq tay karne kaa nirdhaaran hota
 It is estimated that about 15-15 hundred soldiers of both sides were killed in this war
 or is yuddh ke baad bharat kaa riyasat ke saath pratishat or pakistan kaa 40 pratishat bhubhag par kabja rahaa
 The use of armored vehicles and light tanks was very important in the two phases of this war, they were used in very small numbers in both
 ye charan the These incidents suggest that the attack of armored vehicles in unlikely places puts mental pressure on the enemy
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki hamalaavaron ne tagerodhi hathiyaaro kaa prayog nahin kiya shaayad unhone aavashyak na jaanakar unhe peeche hi chhod diya
 The success of the use of armored vehicles left a deep impression on India's war policy
 During the war with China, the Indians worked very hard to use armored vehicles in the inaccessible terrain, but the armored vehicles did not get the expected success in that war
 seemaa rekha main aaye parivartano kaa yadi adhyayan kiya jaay to kaaphi rochak tathy ubhar kar aate hai
 Once the mobilization was completed, the change in the Line of Control slowed down and victory was limited to only those areas with low military density, such as the high areas of the northern Himalayas in which the army of Azad Kashmir was initially successful
 1948 main pakistan ne kashmir par akraman karke, uske ek tihaai bhaag par adhikaar kar liya
 As of now, one third of it is with Pakistan
 jammu or kashmir riyasat kii senaayen is yuddh ke prarambh main faili huin or choti sankhya main keval aatankwaadi hamalo se nipatane ke liye tainaat thim
 Due to which they proved fruitless in the face of traditional military attack

 Dadabhai Naorozi and Major B
 Dutt was the third economic thinker along with D
 Basu to present authentic accounts of the damage done to the Indian economy under colonial rule and the famous 'drain Theory'
 iskaa matlab yah tha ki angrej apane laabh ke liye nirantar niryaat thopane or anaavashyak adhibhaar vasuulne ke jariye bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nichod rahe hai
 Ramesh Chandra Dutt was born in 1848 in a family in Kolkata who had acquired considerable wealth by doing business under the East India Company

 san 1897 se 1904 tak ye landan vishvavidhyalay main bhartiya itihaas ke praadhyaapak rahe
 He died in 1909
 apane gahan anusandhan or vishleshan se dutt ne dikhaaya ki british shashan na keval bharat kii bhautik sthiti sudhaarney main vifal rahaa, balki uske kaal main bharat kaa vi-udyogikaran hua
 As a result of British economic policy, India's handicrafts production fell drastically and industrial production did not increase as a compensation
 na hi bhartiya udyogon ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sangrakshan pradaan kiya gaya
 As a result, the Indian economy was forced to depend on agriculture more than ever before
 bhartiya samaaj kaa dehathikaran hota chalaa gaya
 Dutt said that India did not benefit from the perceived constructive steps of British colonialism
 angrezon dwaara shuru kiye gayi rail- parivahan ke kaaran parmparik parivahan sevaayen maari gayin or trainon kaa istemaal british kaarakaanon main bane maal kii dhulaai ke liye hota rahaa
 Dutt concluded that the Indian economy is not underdeveloped, but its growth has been stunted
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya itihaas vidwaanon ke ek hisse main prachlit us marxvaadi dharna ko jhuthlaata he jiske mutabik british upniveshwaad kii bhoomika pragatisheel tehraayi jaati he
 Apart from economic historian Ramesh Chandra Dutt was also a talented and skilled cultural historian
 bangeey sahitya parishad ke sansthaapak adhyaksh rahane ke saath-saath unhone mahabharat or ramayana kaa angrezi main sankshipt kavyanuwaad bhi kiya
 Based on the evidence of Sanskrit literature, Dutt also composed the history of ancient civilization of India
 british aarthik niti ke dushprinaamon par prakaash daalane ke alaava aarthik vichaaron ke vikaas main dutt kaa doosraa pramukh yogadan yah tha ki unhone arthvyavastha main sarkari hastkshep kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii vakaalat kii
 He recommended this in the early twentieth century at a time when other Indian economists were seeking to reduce the government's interference in economic life
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko nijee pahalakadami ghataane vaale hastkshepon se bachanaa chahie, lekin khaas paristhitiyon main dakhsandaazi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie taaki asthai kism ke sankaton se bachate hue hiton kaa takaraav taala ja sake
 Dutt's method of estimating the reality was also different in that era
 vaastaviktaa ke anek kaarnon main ek ko pramukh or dusron ko uskaa prabhaav maan kar chalane ke bajaay dutt ne aarthik or raajnneetik tathyon kii paraspar nirbharta kii avadharana viksit kii
 He believed that everything in the system of society is interdependent, interconnected, so nothing should be done like disturbing the balance
 lekin, saath main dutt yah bhi samajhate the ki santulan hameshaa ek jaisaa nahin rahata he
 He is constantly changing
 isliye sarkaar ko hastkshep karte samay kii fori sthiti kii antarnihit gatishiltaa par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, varanaa uske hastkshepkaaree kadamon kaa parinaam vipareet bhi nikal saktaa he
 The publication of Dutt's works on economics began from 1900
 unki pehali pustak thi bharat main padane vaale akalon kaa adhyayan karne vaali 'femins and land acesment in india' jisaki saraahna roosi araajaktaavaadi darshanik prince kropatakin ne bhi kii thi
 His work showed how interested he was in the living conditions of the Indian farmer and how his economic thinking was focused on improving his condition
 dutt ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1858 ke baad se chalis saal kii avadhi main bharat kii janata ko das bheeshan akalon kaa saamana kyon karnaa padaa? unhone poocha ki is dauraan hukumat east india company ke bajaay samraji ke haath main thi
 During this time there was usually peace and only one war took place
 hukumat ke paas prashikshit prashaasak the jinhen bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa paryaapt anubhav tha
 The land was fertile, farmers were entrepreneurs and economists
 aisi anukool paristhitiyon ke baavjood aisa kyon hua ki in akalon ke dauraan kareeb dedh karod log bhukh ke shikaar ho kar jaan se haath se dho baithe? dutt yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki akalon kaa kaaran aabaadi main tej rakrataar se hui badhotaree he yaa bharat ke kisaan laaparvaah, kahil or fizoolsearch hai
 He also did not accept that farmers being trapped under the clutches of usurers could be the cause of famine
 dutt ne apane adhyayan main dikhaaya ki bharat main aabaadi badhane kii raftaar england ke mukaable na keval hameshaa kam rahi, balki unke adhyayan se pehle ke das varshon main is desh kii aabaadi main badhotaree ruk hi gayi thi
 According to Dutt, more hardworking and less spending farmers than India are nowhere else in the world
 unhone akaal ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaale aayogon kii rapaton kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkari rajasav kii kathortapurvak vasuuli ke kaaran hi kisaanon ko mahajanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Showing a mirror to the British government, Dutt demonstrated that despite the famine, there was no year when all the crops had fallen
 sarkari godaamon main anaaj hameshaa bharaa rahaa
 If the crop in one province has deteriorated, the crop has been good in another province
 kheti kaa vistaar hua he, vah saghan bhi hui he, pehle ke mukaable paidaavaar bhi badi he, khetihar upaj kii keemten bhi badi hai, par iske baad bhi kisaanon kii haalat lagaataar karaab hoti gayi he
 Dutt blamed British policies for this
 1902 main dutt ke mahaan granth 'da iconomic history of british india' kaa pehla khand prakashit hua
 It is known as the best text written on British rule
 isamen 1757 main angrezon kii satta kii sthapana se lekar samraji kii hukumat lagu hone tak kaa aarthik itihaas pesh kiya gaya tha
 It contained an analytical account of policies related to farming and land settlement, trade and factory production policies as well as finance and administration policies adopted under the East India Company
 pustak ke british samikshakon ne bhi isaki nishpakshta or gaharaai kaa loha mana
 In 1904, the second volume of this epic was published
 unhone pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki british shashan ke praarambhik varshon main apanaayi gayi swarthpurna nitiyaan bhartiya udyogon ke patan ke liye zimmedaar rahi hai
 Dutt, highlighting the causes of poverty in India, proved that the British industry had to destroy the indigenous industries and handicrafts
 lakhon log berojgaar ho gayi jisase jivan-yaapan ke liye unke saamne kheti ke alaava koi or chaara nahin rah gaya
 In this way, the number of people living on the basis of agriculture increased and the standard of living of all fell
 iske saath-saath angrez bharat par hukumat karne ke liye baari dhan karchate rahe jiskaa mulk ko koi faaydaa nahin pahunchaa
 The fiscal policy and the land revenue system were made in such a way that only the surviving resources remained with the farmer
 dutt ke paas in samasyaon kaa ilaaj karne kaa nuskhaa bhi tha
 He recommended that the excise duty should be removed from the Indian mill industry, farmers should be rid of all taxes other than the soft taxation of low rates, military and royal expenditure in England should not be recovered from India and also in India Expenses must be reduced dutt ne jaise hi ye suzav diye, british hukumat or uske himytiyon ne unki chautarfa aalochana shuru kar di
 An attempt was made to dismiss his facts and analysis
 dhyaan rahe ki dutt indian civil services ke varisht adhikari the or british shashan kii seva karne ke daayitv se bandhe hue the
 However, he continued to argue with his opponents and urged the government to change the policies to improve India's economic condition
 inaki vilakshan pratibha keval prashasnic kaaryon tak hi simit nahin thi, varan ye moulik lekhak tathaa itihasajna bhi the
 At the beginning of his writing, he wrote in English, but later also composed in Bengali with the influence of Bankim Chandra

 coffee or chaay nashe main kaale, yaa ke saath doodh or safed chini yaa aprishkrut tad chini, aamtaur par nashe main hai
 Many small shops dotted around the country sell fresh lime juice and many now offer milk shakes and other fruit juices
 Cooking utensils There are utensils that are used in Kerala which are important for food in Kerala
 china chatti, ek aduppu ek varg chulhaa, mun chatti mitti se bane bartan pak rahaa he ek gahari fring pan he
 Food offerings in ritual bhojan atyant mahatvapurn he jab yah anushthan yaa tyoharon kii baat aati he
 Food offerings in ritual are important in Kerala and throughout South India
 bhojan prasad aksar dharm ke devataaon se sambandhit hai
 In India, there are many proposals for Hindu deities and there are many differences between food offerings in North and South India
 adhikansh prasad khaane kii ek se adhik prakaar ke hote hai
 There are many reasons people use the practice of food offerings
 kuch karne ke liye pyaar kaa izhaar he, yaa baatcheet yaa devataaon dhanyavad kar rahe hai
 It can also be used to "stress some structural features of Hinduism"
 beshak, nahin har anushthan devataaon bhojan prasad kii aavashyaktaa he
 Most have a liking for certain foods
 udhaaharan ke liye, makkhan ek bhagwaan krishna ke dwaara pasandida khaadya padaarthon main se ek he
 In addition, wild orange and a sugarcane stalk are associated for Ganapati
 vahaan shuddh or ashuddh jo devataaon par bal diya he, lekin bhojan prasad dwaara aakaar main hindu sab devataaon kaa mandir kii ek shrenee he
 Pure vegetarian foods are offered to the deities while impure deities are offered to their craving for blood due to the flesh a specific dish is offered to both pure and impure deities
 
 yah ek aataa deepak jo meetha chaaval kaa aataa paste jo baahar pakade jate or ghi ke saath pack se bana he
 The dough lamp only partially baked and then eaten
 Another aspect of food offerings is the hierarchy that food items have
 yah ajeeb lag saktaa he ki khaadya padaarthon ke liye ek padanukram he, lekin yah he kyonki vahaan shuddh or ashuddh devataaon ke bich ek dohari vipaksh jo hierarchal he ke do devataaon jo is dohari virodh kiya he
 
 They are Vishnu and Shiva
 loh kaa Luzzi bataate hai ki vishnu tarah jabaki prasad he ki shiv ko diya jaataa he or adhik mitavyayi rahe hai 'ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 An offering to Shiva is likely to be plain rice with no salt or other toppings, while an offering to Vishnu may seem like a South Indian dish that can combine rice with other side dishes
 vishesh rup se dakshin bhartiya prasad main, ve sankhya main dene kii peshkash kar rahe hai
 For example, number three is important in Kerala offerings
 vahaan trimadhura kar rahe hai main 'teen mithai' 
 anushthan main bhojan prasad kii in prathaon ke sabhi jo anuwaad kerala samskruti main mahatvapurn ke rup main dakshin bhartiya samskruti ke rup main acchhee tarah se kar rahe hai
 Cooking as a sacred ritual The cooking as a sacred ritual of the last decade has increased in South Kerala, almost exclusively by women
 This practice, called 'pongala', seems to have been associated with the historic moving city temple Attukal in Thiruvananthapuram which was begotten by the Tamil tradition
 abhilekhon kaa naam ginis book ke mutabik, Attukal Pongala duniya main mahilaon kii sabase badi sabha he pongala kii mahila pratibhaagiyon ke aane ke khaanaa pakaane ke bartan, sookhe eendhan or saamagree ke saath susajjit he
 Set your hearths around the temple such as rice flour, palm sugar and spices, often last evening, and on the morning of the festival day
 aksar, mahilaon pongala din ke dauraan sadakon or tiruvanantpuram shahar kii galiyon main se zyaadaatar par le lo
 2009 main, mahilaon kii anumaanit sankhya 2
5 million jo bhaag liya tha
 The women waited till the Attukal Temple ceremoniously distributed the fire and set about their cooking when the fire reached them passed from the stove to the stove
 They go home with prasad cooked till late afternoon
 While men are not allowed in the area, they help in providing my support for women coming from outside and departing and organizing free drinks by organizing transport
 Trivandrum city, police and civil authorities have been able to successfully manage the festival, but it is quintessentially a women's festival
 suvidhaon kii kami ke baavjood, kaaphi kathinaayee upkaran or saamagree pakaane ke parivahan main shaamil he or chamakdaar farvari suraj, pratibhaagiyon kii sankhya ko varsh varsh ke baad badhati hone lagate hai or shaamil kuch cinema se prasiddh chehron main se, saamaajik rup main bhi halkon saadhaaran
 yah bhi dekha gaya he ki pongala kaa abhyaas teji se trivendrum shahar or jile main kai anya mandiron main fail rahaa he
 Syrian Christian Cuisine The food of the state of Kerala, India is influenced by its large minority Christianity
 kerala syrian isaayiyon kii ek pasandida pakwaan stu he: chikan, aalu or pyaaj ek malaaidaar safed kaali mirch, dalacheenee, laung, hari mirch, neembu kaa ras, shallots or nariyal ke doodh ke saath anuroopit sos main dhire simmered
 unhone yah bhi chikan, bhed kaa baccha or batakh ke saath stews taiyaar karte hai
 Other dishes include piralen, meat thoran, fiery vindaloos, sardine and duck curry and meen molee
 This appam is eaten together
 Appams, kallappams, yaa vellayappams chaaval kaa aataa penkex jo naram, moti safed khankhara kendron or kurkura, bel kii tarah kinaaron kiya he
 Pisces vevichathu is another favorite item
 chikan or machhlee ke alaava, syrian isai bhi laal maance khate hai
 For example, erachi orlarthiathu is a dish cooked with beef or mutton spices

 Please discuss it before canceling or changing it
 anek malaria-grast kshetron main bukhaar ke har marij ko malaria kaa anumanik nidaan de diya jaataa he or kunain se ilaaj shuru kar diya jaataa he
 Along with this, blood plaques are also made, but the results are not awaited to start treatment
 aisa kai aise kshetron main bhi kiya jaataa he jahaan saamaanya prayogshaala pareekshanon kii suvidhaae uplabdh nahin hon
 But a study in Malawi suggests that unnecessary treatment of malaria can be avoided if the temperature of the anus, anemia, and spleen size are taken into consideration along with fever
 )
 Testing blood vessels under a microscope is considered the cheapest, best and reliable method of diagnosing malaria
 is pareekshan se chaaron malaria parjiviyon ke vishisht lakshanon ke dwaara alag-alag nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Blood plaques are made in two ways - thin and thick
 patali patticoon main paraseete kii banaavat ko behatar dhang se surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he, vahiin duusari ore moti patticoon se kam samay main rakt kii adhik maatra kii jaanch kii ja sakati he or isse kam maatra ke sankraman kaa bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Experienced testers can detect up to 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 percent infection in the blood
 in kaarnon se moti or patali donon pattiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Also, it is necessary to examine more than one ring phase, because the ring phases of the four parasites often look the same
 
 Several antigen-based dipstick tests or malaria rapid antigen tests are also available to diagnose malaria
 inhen rakt kii keval ek boond kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, or sirf 15-20 minute main hi parinaam saamne aa jaataa he, prayogshaala kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 These are considered to be slightly inferior to microscopic examination
 lekin jin kshetron main sookshmdarshi jaanch kii suvidha uplabdh nahin hoti yaa pareekshakon ko malaria ke nidaan kaa anubhav nahin hota vahaan prabhavit kshetra main ja kar rakt kii ek boond se antigen pareekshan kar liya jaataa he
 These tests were first developed using the fermented glutamate dehydrogenase of P
 falciparum as an antigen
 lekin jaldi hi ek anya kinvak lactate dihadrosenez kaa prayog karke optimal-iti naamak pareekshan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These enzymes are not present in the blood for a long time and when the parasite is eliminated, they also get out of the blood, so these tests are also used to know the success or failure of treatment
 optimal-iti failciparum or gaiyr-failciparum malaria main antar bhi kar saktaa he
 It can diagnose P
 falciparum by 0
01 percent and non-falciparum malaria parasites in the blood by 0
1 percent
 iske atirikt pi
 failciparum vishisht histidin-bharpoor proteinon par aadhaarit parachake-pief rakt main 0
002 pratishat tak malaria paraseete kaa nidaan kar saktaa he, lekin yah failciparum or gaiyr-failciparum malaria main antar nahin kar paata he
 In addition to this, some tests have also been developed using polymerase chain reactions and using molecular methods, but they are still quite expensive, and are available only in specialized laboratories
 saste, samvedi tathaa saral pareekshanon ke vikaas kii ab bhi aavashyaktaa he, jinka prayog kshetra main, malaria ke nidaan ke liye kiya ja sake
 It is often a mistake to identify severe malaria in Africa, due to which other mortal diseases are not treated
 rakt main paraseete kii maujuudagi keval gambhir malaria se hi nahin, anya kai jaanaleva bimariyon ke chalate bhi ho sakati he
 Recent studies suggest that malarial retinopathy is superior to any other test for distinguishing between malaria-borne unconsciousness and non-malaria-borne unconsciousness
 vyavsaay evam sanghathan ke sandarbh main prabandhan kaa arth he - uplabdh sansadhano kaa dakshatapurvak tathaa prabhaavapurn tareeke se upyog karte hue logon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa taaki lakshyon kii prapti sunishchit kii ja sake
 Management includes organizing, organization-building, staffing, leadership, and controlling the organization or initiative
 sanghathan bhale hi bada ho yaa chota, laabh ke liye ho athwa gaiyr-laabh vaala, seva pradaan karata ho athwa vinirmaankarta, prabandh sabhi keliye aavashyak he
 Management is necessary so that individuals can make their best contribution towards the accomplishment of collective objectives
 prabandh main parsparik rup se sambandhit vah kaary sammilit hai jinhen sabhi prabandhak karte hai
 Managers spend different time on different tasks
 sanghathan ke ucchstar par baithe prabandhak niyojan evam sanghathan par neeche str ke prabandhakon kii tulana main adhik samay lagaate hai
 Many authors have given the definition of management
 prabandh shabd ek bahuprachlit shabd he jise sabhi prakaar kii kriyaaon ke liye vyapak rup se prayukt kiya gaya he
 By the way, it is mainly used for various activities of any enterprise
 uparokt udhaaharan evam vastusthiti ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho gaya hoga ki prabandh vah kriya he jo har us sanghathan main aavashyak he jisamen log samooh ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 People do different types of tasks in the organization but they still work to achieve the same purpose
 prabandh logon ke prayatnon evam samaan uddeshy ko praapt karne main disha pradaan karata he
 In this way, the management sees that the tasks are completed and the targets are achieved, at least at the least cost and minimum cost
 atah prabandh ko paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se praapt karne ke uddeshy se kaaryon ko puraa karaane kii prakriya he
 We need to analyze this definition
 kuch shabd aise hai jinka vistaar se varnan karnaa aavashyak he
 These words are- paribhaasha main prayukt prakriya se abhipraay he praathmik kaary athwa kriyaayein jinhen prabandh kaaryon ko puraa karaane ke liye karata he
 These tasks are - planning, organization, appointment, direction and control which will be discussed further in this chapter and in the book
 prabhavi athwa kaary ko prabhavi dhang se karne kaa vastav main abhipraayah die gaye kaary ko sampann karnaa he
 Effective management is about doing the right thing, completing actions and achieving objectives
 duusare shabdon main, iskaa kaary antim parinaam praapt karnaa he
 But just completing the work is not enough, there is another aspect of it and that is efficiency ie doing the work efficiently
 kushalta kaa arth he kaary ko sahi dhang se nunatam laagat par karnaa
 There is a kind of cost-benefit analysis and the relation between input and output
 yadi kam sadhano kaa upyog kar adhik laabh praapt karte hai to ham kahenge ki kshamta main vruddhi hui he
 Efficiency will be increased if less resources are used for the same benefit or output and less cost is incurred
 aagat saadhan ve hai jo kisi kaary vishesh ko karne ke liye aavashyak dhan, maal upkaran evam maanav sansaadhan hon
 Naturally, management is related to the efficient use of these resources because they reduce costs and in the end they increase profits
 yah donon shabd alag-alag hote hue bhi ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 It is important to have both effective and efficient management
 prabhaavapurntaa evam kaushal donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 But balance between these two sides is necessary and sometimes management has to compromise efficiency
 udhaaharan ke liye prabhaavapurn hona evam kushalta kii andekhi karnaa saral he jiskaa arth he kaary ko puraa karnaa lekin unchi laagat par
 For example, suppose a company aims to produce 8,000 units in a year
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye adhikansh samay bijli na milane par prabandhak prabhavotpadak to tha lekin kshamtawan nahin tha kyonki, usee nirgat ke liye adhik aagat kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Sometimes business focuses more on the production of goods with less resources, ie reduced the cost but failed to produce the scheduled production
 parinamswaroop maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya isliye isaki maang kam ho gai tathaa iskaa sthaan pratiyogiyon ne le liya
 This is a situation of lack of efficiency but effectiveness as the goods did not reach the market
 isliye nunatam laagat par prabandhak liye lakshyon ko praapt karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he
 For this, balance has to be made in effectiveness and efficiency
 saadharantaya ucch kaary kushalta ke saath ucch prabhaavapurntaa hoti he jo ki sabhi prabandhakon kaa lakshya hota he
 But unduly emphasizing high work efficiency without effectiveness is also undesirable
 kamjor prabandhan prabhaavapurntaa evam kaarykushal dona kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 After studying some definitions, we get to know some elements which we call the basic features of management
 prabandh kuch uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kaary karata he
 Objectives are the expected results of any action
 inhen vyavsaay ke mul prayojan se praapt kiya janaa chahie
 Any organization has different objectives and management has to achieve all these objectives effectively and efficiently
 uddeshyon ko sanghathanaatmak uddeshy, saamaajik uddeshy evam vyaktigat uddeshyon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The management is responsible for determining and accomplishing the objectives for the organization
 ise sabhi kshetren ke anek prakaar ke uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa hota he tathaa sabhi hitarthiyon jaise-anshadhari, karmchaaree, graahak, sarkaar aadi ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 The main objective of any organization should be to utilize human and material resources for maximum possible benefit
 jiskaa taatpary he vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ko puraa karnaa
 These objectives are - to keep oneself alive, to earn profit and to grow
 kisi bhi vyavsaay kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy apane astitv ko banaae rakhana hota he
 Management should strive towards the survival of the organization
 iske liye sanghathan ko paryaapt dhan kamanaa chahie jisase ki laagton ko puraa kiya ja sake
 It is not enough for business to survive
 prabandh ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki sanghathan laabh kamaaye
 Profit serves as an important impetus for the continued successful operation of the enterprise
 laabh vyavsaay kii laagat evam jokhimon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Increasing your prospects in the long term is very important for the business
 iske liye vyavsaay kaa badhanaa bahut mahatva rakhata he
 Management should take full advantage of the potential of organization development to remain in the industry
 vyavsaay ke vikaas ko vikray aavart, karmchaariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi yaa phir utpaadon kii sankhya yaa poonji ke nivesh main vruddhi aadi ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 Creating benefits for society
 sanghathan chaahe vyavsaayik he athwa gaiyr vyavsaayik, samaaj ke ang hone ke kaaran use kuch saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 This means creating favorable economic values for different parts of society
 isamen sammilit hai- utpaadan ke paryaavaran bhinn paddati apnaanaa, samaaj ke logon se vanchit virgon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa evam karmchaariyon ke liye vidhyalay, shishugrih jaisi suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa
 The box further gives an example of an organization fulfilling a corporate social responsibility
 sanghathan un logon se milakar banataa he jinase unka vyaktitv, prishthbhumi, anubhav evam uddeshy alag-alag hote hai
 All these become part of the organization to satisfy their diverse needs
 yah pratiyogi vetan evam anya laabh jaisi vittiya aavashyaktaaon se lekar saathiyon dwaara manyata jaisi saamaajik aavashyaktaaon evam vyaktigat badhotaree evam vikaas jaisi ucch stareey aavashyaktaaon ke rup main alag-alag hoti hai
 Management has to match individual objectives with organizational objectives to align with the organization
 prabandh ek saarvbhaumik kriya he jo kisi bhi sanghathan kaa abhinn ang he
 Now we will study some of the reasons why management has become so important- prabandh itnaa hi purana he jitani kii sabhyataa
 Although the origin of modern organization is new, but organized work has been taking place since ancient times of civilization
 vastav main sanghathan ko vishisht lakshan mana ja saktaa he jo sabhy samaaj ko asabhy samaaj se alag karata he
 The early practices of management were the rules and laws that emerged from the experience of government and commercial activities
 vyapaar evam vaanijya ke vikaas se kramshah prabandh ke siddhant evam vyavhaaron kaa vikaas hua
 The word 'prabandha' is used today in many meanings which highlight various aspects of its nature
 prabandh ke adhyayan kaa vikaas beete samay main aadhunik sanghathanon ke saath-saath hua he
 It has been based on both the experience and behavior of managers and the associated set of principles
 beete samay main iskaa ek gatisheel vishay ke rup main vikaas hua he
 Which has its own special characteristics
 lekin prabandh kii prakruti se sambandhit ek prashn kaa uttar dena aavashyak he ki prabandh vigyaan he yaa kala he yaa phir donon he? iskaa uttar dene ke liye aaie vigyaan evam kala donon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen tathaa dekhen ki prabandh kahan tak inaki purti karata he
 What is art Art is the personal and efficient use of current knowledge to achieve desired results
 ise adhyayan, avlokan evam anubhav se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now, because art is concerned with personal use of knowledge, a kind of originality and creativity is required to put into practice the fundamental principles studied
 kala ke aadharbhoot lakshan is prakaar hai- Art assumes that there is some theoretical knowledge already
 visheshgyon ne apane-apane kshetron main kuch moolbhoot siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jo ek vishesh prakaar kii kala main prayukt hota he
 For example, literature on dance, public address / speech, art or music is acceptable
 is moolbhoot gyaan kaa upyog vyakti, vyakti ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 Art is, therefore, a very personal concept
 udhaaharan ke liye do nartak, do vaktaa, do kalakaar athwa do lekhakon kii apni kala ke pradarshan main bhinnata hogi
 All art is practical
 kala vartmaan siddhanton ko gyaan kaa rachanaatmak upyog he
 We know that music is based on seven notes
 lekin kisi sangeetkaar kii sangeet rachana vishisht athwa bhinn hoti he yah is baat par nirbhar karti he ki in suron kaa kis prakaar se sangeet srijan main prayog kiya gaya he, jo ki uski apni vyakhya hoti he
 Management is an art because, it fulfills the following characteristics- prabandhak ek krambaddh gyaan-samooh he kinhin saamaanya satya athwa saamaanya siddhanton ko spasht karata he vigyaan kii moolbhoot visheshtaayen nimna hai- Science is a hierarchical set of knowledge
 iske siddhant kaaran evam parinaam ke bich main sambandh aadhaarit hai
 For example, the occurrence of the apple falling from the tree to Earth gives rise to the principle of gravity
 vaigyanik siddhanton ko pehle avlokan ke madhyam se viksit kiya jaataa he or phir niyantrit paristhitiyon main baar-baar pareekshan kar uski jaanch kii jaati he
 Scientific theories are universal for validity and application
 uparyukt visheshtaon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai prabandh vigyaan ke rup main kuch visheshtaon ko dhaaran karata he- It is necessary to manage all types of organization processes
 aapane yah bhi avlokan kiya hoga ki sanghathanon ko unka prabandh karne ke liye kuch vishisht yogyataon evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You may have also noticed that on the one hand there has been an increase in the corporate form and on the other hand more emphasis is being placed on managing the business
 kya iskaa arth yah hua ki prabandh ek pesha he? is prashn kaa uttar jaanane ke liye aaie peshey kii pramukh visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen evam dekhen ki kya prabandh inako puraa karata he
 The following are the characteristics of the profession sabhi peshey bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit gyaan ke samooh par aadhaarit hote hai jise shiksha se arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 Admission to the profession is limited by examination or educational qualification
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat main yadi kisi ko chartered accountint bananaa he to use bhartiya chartered accountint santhaan dwaara yojit kii jane vaali ek vishesh pariksha ko paas karnaa hoga
 All professions are associated with one or the other councils, which regulate their entry, issue certificates to work and prepare and implement the Aadhaar Code
 bharat main vakaalat karne ke liye vakeelon ko baar council kaa sadsy bananaa hota he jo unke kaaryon kaa niyaman evam niyantran karata he
 All professions are bound by a code of conduct that gives direction to the behavior of their members
 udhaaharan ke liye jab doctor apane peshey main pravesh karte hai to vah apane kaary naitikta kii shapath lete hai
 The basic purpose of the profession is loyalty and commitment and the interests of its customers
 ek vakil yah sunishchit karata he ki uske muvakkil ko nyaay mili
 Management does not fully meet the principles of the profession
 vaise isamen kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jo nimna hai- Management is a universal term used in a group of relationships in an enterprise by people connected to each other to perform certain tasks
 prayek-vyakti kaa sambandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main kisi na kisi kaary vishesh ko puraa karne kaa uttardaayitv hota he
 In order to fulfill this responsibility, he is given some rights ie decision making authority
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv kaa yah sambandh vyaktiyon ko adhikari evam adhinsth ke rup main ek duusare ko bandhate hai
 This creates different levels in the organization
 kisi sanghathan ke adhikaar shrunkhlaa main teen str hote hai- High Level Management - These are the senior most executive officers of the organization who are called by many names
 yah saamanytah chairman, mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, mukhya prachaalan adhikari, pradhan, uppradhan aadi ke naam se jane jate hai
 High management is a team of managers of different functional levels
 unka mul kaary sanghathan ke kul uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn tatwon main ekta evam vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa he
 These high level managers are responsible for the welfare and continuity of the organization
 form ke jivan ke liye ye vyavsaay ke paryaavaran evam uske prabhaav kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They formulate the goals and armaments of the new organization for their achievement
 vyavsaay ke sabhi kaaryon evam unke samaaj par prabhaav ke liye ye hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 The task of higher management is complex and stressful
 isamen lanbaa samay lagata he to sanghathan ke prati purnapatibaddhta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Middle level management- These are the link between upper managers and lower level, they are subordinate to upper managers and heads of first linear managers
 inhen saamanytah vibhaag pramukh, parichaalan prabandhak athwa sanyantr adheekshak kehete hai
 Middle level managers are responsible for the implementation of control plans and armaments developed by higher management
 iske saath-saath ye pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke sabhi kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Their main task is to complete the plans prepared by the higher level managers
 iske liye Supervisory or Operations Manager - Foremen and supervisors come at the lower level in the authority line of the organization
 paryvekshak kaarybal ke kaaryon kaa pratyaksh rup se avlokan karte hai
 Their rights and duties are determined by schemes made by higher managers
 paryvekshan, prabandhakon kii sanghathan main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he kyonki yah sidhe vaastavik kaary bal se samvaad karte hai evam madhya stareey prabandhakon ke dishanirdeshon ko karmchaariyon tak pahunchaate hai
 By these efforts, the quality of the product is maintained, the loss of goods is kept to a minimum and the level of safety is maintained
 kaarigari kii gunvattta, evam utpaadan kii maatr karmchaariyon ke parishram, anushaasan evam swamibhakti par nirbhar karti he
 Management is considered as the process of planning, organization, direction and control of tasks from members to the organization and the use of resources of the organization for achieving the set objectives
 yah pehle se hi yah nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary he ki kya karnaa he, kis prakaar tathaa kisko karnaa he
 This means setting objectives in advance and setting a path to achieve them efficiently and effectively
 suhasini ke sanghathan kaa uddeshy he paramparaagat bhartiya hathkargha evam hastshilp kii vastuon ko kharidkar unhen bechnaa
 He sells woven garments, decoration items, garments and household articles made from traditional Indian clothes
 suhasini inaki maatr, inke vibhinn prakaar, rang evam banaavat ke sambandh main nirnay leti he phir vibhinn aapurtikartaaon se unke kray athwa unke ghar main taiyaar karaane par sansadhano kaa aavanton karti he
 No one can prevent planning problems from occurring, but they can be anticipated and they can form contingency plans whenever they arise
 yah nirdhaarit yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye kaary saunpane, kaaryon ko samoohon main baantne, adhikaar nishchit karne evam sansadhano ke aavanton ke kaary kaa prabandhan karata he
 Once a specific plan is prepared to meet the objectives of the organization, then the organization will examine the actions and resources necessary for the implementation of the plan
 yah aavashyak kaaryon evam sansadhano kaa nirdhaaran karegaa
 It decides who will do what work, where it will be done and when
 sanghathan main aavashyak kaaryon ko prabandh ke yogya vibhaag evam kaary ikaiyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he evam sanghathan kii adhikaar shrunkhlaa main adhikaar evam vivaran dene ke sambandhon kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he

 saral shabdon main iskaa arth he sahi kaary ke liye uchit vyakti ko foondnaa
 An important aspect of management is to ensure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right place and time to achieve the objectives of the organization
 ise maanav sansaadhan kaary bhi kehete hai tathaa isamen karmchaariyon kii bhartee, chayan, kaary par niyukti evam prashikshan sammilit hai
 Infosys Technology, which develops software, requires system analysts and programmers, while Labmart requires a team of designers and craftspeople
 nideshan kaa kaary karmchaariyon ko netritv pradaan karnaa, prabhavit karnaa evam abhiprerit karnaa he jisase ki vah supurd kaary ko puraa kar saken
 This requires creating an environment that inspires employees to function optimally
 abhiprerana evam netritv-nirdesan ke do mul tatv hai
 Motivating employees simply means creating an environment that motivates them to work
 netritv kaa arth he dusron ko is prakaar se prabhavit karnaa, ki vah apane netaa ke icchit kaary sampann karen
 a good manager, with the help of praise and criticism, directs in such a way that employees can contribute their best
 suhasini ke dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii chaadaron ke liye silk par bhadkile rangon ke chaape viksit kiye
 Although it looked very attractive, but due to the use of silk, it was very expensive for the common man
 unke kaary kii prashansa karte hue suhasini ne unhen suzav diya ki in silk kii chaadaron ko vah deepawali, christmas jaise vishesh avasaron ke liye sahej kar rakhen tathaa unhen niyamit rup se sooti vastren par chhaapen
 Control is defined as the act of managing in which it directs the execution of organization work to achieve the goals of the organization
 niyantran kaary main nishpaadan ke str nirdhaarit kiye jate hai, vartmaan nishpaadan ko mapa jaataa he
 It is matched to predefined levels and corrective steps are taken in the event of deviation
 iske liye prabandhakon ko yah nirdhaarit karnaa hoga ki safalataa ke liye kya kaary evam utpaadan mahatvapurn hai, uskaa kaise or kahan maapan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sudharatmak kadam uthaane ke liye koun adhikrut he
 When Suhasini found that his team of designers made a bed sheet that was more expensive than the fixed price for his sale, he changed the cloth for the sheet to control costs
 prabandhak ke vibhinn kaaryon par saadharantaya uparokt kram main hi charchaa kii jaati he jiske anusaar ek prabandhak pehle yojana taiyaar karata he; phir sanghathan banaata he; tatpashchaat nirdesan karata he; or ant main niyantran karata he
 In fact the manager rarely performs these tasks one by one
 prabandhak ke kaary ek duusare se jude hai tathaa yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he koun-sa kaary kahan samaapt hua tathaa koun-sa kaary kahan se prarambh hua
 In the process of managing an organization, a manager has to perform five tasks related to each other
 sanghathan ek aisi paddati he jo ek duusare se jude evam ek duusare par aadhaarit upapaddatiyon se bani he
 The manager has to connect these different groups to achieve the same objectives
 vibhinn vibhaagon kii gatividhiyon kii ekaatmakataa kii prakriya ko samanvay kehete hai
 Coordination is the power that binds all other functions of management to each other
 yah aisa dhaagaa he jo sanghathan ke kaary main nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye kray, utpaadan, vikray evam vitt jaise sabhi kaaryon ko piroe rakhata he
 Coordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management
 lekin yah prabandh kaa saar he kyonki yah samuhik lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kiye gaye vyaktigat prayatnon main ekta laata he
 Each managerial task is an activity that contributes to the coordination in itself
 samanvay kisi bhi sanghathan ke sabhi kaaryon main lakshith evam anternihit hai
 The process of coordinating the actions of the organization starts with planning
 ucch prabandh puure sanghathan ke liye yojana banaata he
 According to these plans organization structures are developed and employees are appointed
 yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan yojana ke anusaar hi yah sunishchit karne ke liye nirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If there is any difference between the actual actions and their achievements, it is resolved at the time of control
 samanvay kii kriya ke madhyam se prabandh kaa samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon main ekta ko sunishchit karne ke liye vyaktigat evam samuhik prayatnon kii sahi vyavastha karata he, samanvay sanghathan kii vibhinn ikaayiyon ke bhinn-bhinn kaaryon evam prayatnon main ekta sthapit karata he
 It provides the required amount of effort, quantity, time and serialization that ensures the minimum attainment of planned objectives
 uparokt paribhaashaon se samanvay kii nimna visheshtaayen spasht hoti hai- Co-ordination brings togetherness in collective work - Coordination brings interests that are not related to each other or different from each other, unity in objective work activity
 yah samooh ke kaaryon ko ek kendra bindu pradaan karata he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki nishpaadan yojana evam nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar ho
 Coordination brings unity in action - The objective of coordination is to bring unity in action to achieve the same objectives
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon ko jodne kii shakti kaa kaary karata he tathaa yah sunishchit karata he ki sabhi kriyaayein sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii jaaen
 You found that the production and sales departments of Labmart have to coordinate their work so that production can be done as per the market demand
 samanvay nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he- samanvay koi ek baar kaa kaary nahin he balki ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 It starts with planning and runs till control
 suhasini thand ke samay ke liye vastren ke sambandh main june ke maheene main hi yojana bana leti he
 She then arranges for an adequate workforce
 utpaadan yojana ke anusaar hi iske liye lagaataar nigaraanee rakhti he use apane vipanan vibhaag ko samay rahete bataanaa hoga ki vah vikray pravartan evam vigyaapan ke prachaar ke liye taiyaar karen
 Coordination is a universal task - the actions of different departments depend on each other by nature, hence coordination is required at all levels of management
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon evam vibhinn staron ke kaaryon main ekta sthapit karata he
 Suhasini has to coordinate the works of the purchasing, production and sales departments in order to achieve opposition to the organization's purpose
 kray vibhaag kaa kaary kapadaa khareednaa he
 This becomes the basis for the activities of the production department and finally the sale becomes possible
 yadi kapadaa ghatiya gunvattta vaala he yaa phir utpaadan vibhaag dwaara nirdhaarit vishistataaen liye hue nahin he to isse aage kii bikri kam ho jaaegi
 If there is no coordination, there will be repetition and chaos in place of unity and integration in actions
 samanvay sabhi prabandhakon kaa uttardaayitv he- kisi bhi sanghathan main samanvay prayek prabandhak kaa kaary he ucch str ke prabandhak yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sanghathan kii nitiyon kaa kriyanvayan ho, apane adhinsthon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Middle-level managers coordinate with both upper-level managers and first-line managers
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki kaary yojanaon ke anusaar kiya jaae, prachaalan str ke prabandhak apane karmchaariyon ke kaaryon main samanvay karte hai
 Coordination is a thought-provoking task - a manager has to coordinate the actions of different people carefully and thoughtfully
 kisi vibhaag main sadsy swechha se ek duusare se sahyog karte hue kaary karte hai, samanvay is sahyog kii bhaavana ko dishanirdesh detaa he
 In the absence of coordination, cooperation will also prove fruitless and coordination without cooperation will lead to dissatisfaction among the employees
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki samanvay, prabandh kaa pruthak se ek kaary nahin he balki yah uskaa saar he
 If an organization wants to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently, it will require coordination
 maala main dhaage ke samaan hi samanvay prabandh ke sabhi kaaryon kaa abhinn ang he
 Integrating various managerial functions ensures adequate coordination among individuals and departments
 jaise samanvay kii samasya ke paidaa hone ke kaaran bade paimaane ke sanghathan main antarnihit nirantar parivartan kamjor athwa niskriy netritv evam jatiltaayen hai
 Coordinating these kinds of complexities in large organizations requires special efforts
 sanghathan kaa aakaar-bade sanghathanon main lage badi sankhya main log samanvay kii samasya ko jatil bana dete hai
 Each person is unique in itself
 tathaa apni evam sanghathan kii aavashyaktaaon ko mahasoos karata he
 Each has his / her own working habits, his / her background, proposals / ways of dealing with situations and relationships with others
 vaise ek akelaa vyakti sadaa budhimaani se kaary nahin karata he
 His behavior is neither always well understood nor fully predictable
 isliye sanghathan kii kaary kushalta ke liye yah anivaary he ki vyakti evam samooh ke uddeshyon ko samanvay dwaara ekikrut kar diya jaae
 Functional Differentiation - The functions of the organization are repeatedly divided into departments, divisions, sections etc
 samanvay kii samasya isliye paidaa hoti he kyonki adhikaar kshetren kaa drudhikaran ho jaataa he or unke bich ke avarohak or bhi adhik majboot ho jate hai
 Many times this is because the classification of tasks is not tactical or the managers do not follow a logical path, but take the path of experience
 aise maamalon main sanghathan main prabhavi dhang se kaary karne ke liye samanvay aavashyak he
 Specialization - There is a high degree of specialization in modern organizations
 vishishtikaran kaa janm aadhunik takneekon kii jatiltaaon tathaa kaaryon evam inhen karne waalon kii vividhta ke kaaran hota he
 Experts think that they are capable of testing each other on the basis of profession but other people may not have any adequate basis for such a decision
 yadi visheshgyon ko bina samanvay ek bhumandaleey prabandhak ke saamne chunauti ke kaary karne kii anumati de di jaae to parinaam kaaphi manhage honge
 That is why a composition mechanism is needed to coordinate the work of various experts engaged in the organization
 samanvay prabandh kaa saar he
 This is not something a manager may order
 balki yah to vah cheez he jise ek prabandhak niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan niyantran kaaryon ko karte hue praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Hence each task is a practice of coordination
 sanghathan evam inke prabandh main parivartan aa rahaa he
 As the boundaries of different cultures and countries are getting blurred and new technologies of communication can be considered as a global village
 antarrashtriya evam antar samskruti sambandh bhi teji se bad rahe hai
 Today's organization is a global organization that is managed in the global scenario
 saransh main kah sakate hai ki ek vaishvik prabandhak vah he jiske paas ‘hard’ evam ‘soft’ donon prakaar kaa kaushal hai
 Managers who have knowledge of analyzing, analyzing, engineering and technology are still needed today, but how teams work in individuals, how organizations work and how they can motivate people for worldwide success
 It is very important to have understanding of everyone
 udhaaharan ke liye jo prabandhak vibhinn samskritiyon main paith rakhata he vah pashchimi europe, gaiyr angreji bolne vaale desh main kaary kar saktaa he phir malaysia athwa kenya jaise vikasshil deshon main ja saktaa he or phir use neuyark, you- es- e- ke karyaalay main hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 He will be able to work effectively at these three places immediately
 vaishvik prabandhak kii bhoomika kaa vikaas usee prakaar se hua he jis prakaar se vaishvik udyog evam arthvyavastha kaa vikaas hua he
 It has transformed from a one-dimensional role to a multi-faceted role in the context of a defined occupation which requires a combination of technical skills, soft management and skills and learning and learning of different cultures

 Through this chariot, about 10 lakh forest dwellers and women visited Lord Jagannath and worshiped reverently
 isi rath ke madhyam se swami ji ne nashaabandi, saamaajik kuritiyon ke viruddh evam goraksha ke liye jan jaagran kiya
 This awakened consciousness and devotion among the forest dwellers
 san 1970 se disambar 2007 tak swami ji par 8 baar jaanaleva hamale kiye gaye
 But in spite of these attacks, Swamiji's vow was unwavering and that was the vow - to stop the conversion, to awaken the tribal identity

 According to the information received, they open L's guitar in anticipation of having a weapon and hold it at the tip of the gun until then, but they only see the guitar
 vah usko jane dete hai, ki tabhi vah dekhte hai ki guitar rakhane vaale sandook ke andar rakhaa guitar to uski banduukon ko chupaane ke liye ek aavaran maatr he

 vah bataati he ki uskaa naam carolina he
 He wants to go to the hospital but she says that he should not go to the hospital otherwise they can see him
 is par vah usase poochta he ki vah kahaan he or vah kahati he ki yah uski kitaab kii dukaan he, lekin uskaa kaam acha nahin chal rahaa he

 She eagerly opens her guitar box and sees that she has a guitar, but then she finds that she has El's spooks
 tabhi el use pakad letaa he
 She says that now she understands who she is, she does not seem afraid of him
 He then proposes to give her one of his guns as a gift, but she refuses
 phir vah carch jane ke liye vahaan se chalaa jaataa he, jahaan vah buskemi se miltaa he jo use kahata he ki use samay rahete vahaan se nikal janaa chahie, kyunki vah swayan bhi yahi kar rahaa he
 At this, El follows Buscemi and starts arguing with him, never again realizing that he is being chased, this time by another man who wears black clothes, just like El, the entire film
 Chases l during
 iske baad vah buskemi se bataata he ki shaayad, antat use yah chhod dena chahie
 Buscemi agrees with his idea, but only then is he killed by Navajas, who was throwing several knives
 iske baad el ko bhi chot lagati he, lekin vah sirf ghayal hota he or ek gali main bhaag jaataa he
 Navajas was confidently waiting for him at the entrance
 buko kii limogin, jisame uski premika thi or uske aadmi bhare hue the, vah uski pahchaan jaanane ke liye uske peeche aakar rukati he
 He kills many of his men with his knife, but is then shot
 bina kisi kii nazar main aaye el bhaagane main safal ho jaataa he or vah phir se sanyogvash usee chote ladke se miltaa he jisase pehle mila tha, jo el ko apana vaastavik guitar dikhaanaa chahta he
 El goes after him, he is clearly having a lot of pain and is also bleeding heavily
 ek car vahaan par aati he or uske andar baitha ek aadmi ladke ke saath guitar kaa sauda karata he
 He then goes to the car a little further and sees El
 car main baitha vyakti bandook nikaalane kaa prayaas karata he, lekin el usase adhik twarit hota he or doosraa guitar maangata he
 He gives him the guitar and walks ahead of the car
 phir vah use dekhne ke liye tod detaa he, use uske andar cocaine kaa packet miltaa he
 He questions the younger boy who tells him that everyone in the city is involved in it and that the trade is going on under the guise of several businesses; Including Carolina's book store
 gusse main, el waapas kitaab kii dukaan kii ore badhata he
 Meanwhile, Bucho's men return Navajas' corpse
 buko apane varisht adhikariyon ko phone karata he or us aadmi huliya poochta he jise unhone el kii khoj main bheja tha
 The hulia he is told met Navajas, but Bucho is unwilling to believe that his men killed the same man sent by his superiors to find El
 iske baad vah apane sahaayak ko yah sochane ke liye dandit karata he ki el ek adbhud vyakti he
 Returning to the bookstore, l yells at Carolina, angry at the fact that she is also working for the person who wants to kill and is angry that the same person caused her friend , Buscemi is also murdered
 is par carolina kahati he ki vah buko ke liye kaam nahin karaati, bas uski dukaan se vah saamaan uthaaya or choda jaataa he or iske liye use prativarsh 50,000 dollar milte hai
 She says that out of what she gets, she spends running a bookstore and saves the rest because she might have to leave from here, but once she gets involved with the job she has to leave it Was not allowed
 yah sunakar el shant ho jaataa he or counter par let jaataa he jisase vah uske ghaav ko saafe kar sake, lekin tabhi buko vahaan aata he or carolina shighrata se el ko counter ke peeche dhakka de detii he
 He asks Carolina if she has seen any strangers, but she says that she has not seen any strangers and will definitely call her if she sees
 counter ke peeche el chupchaap apni bandook main goliyaan daalane kaa prayaas karata he, lekin buko ke jane ke pehle vah aisa nahin kar pataa
 vah vahaan se buko kaa peechha karne ke liye jane kaa prayaas karata he, lekin carolina kahati he ki yah aatmahatya karne ke jaisaa hoga or use abhi or pratiksha kerani chahie
 Later, while l is healing and is recuperating, Carolina gives him a guitar as a gift
 vah donon ek saath guitar bajaane kaa prayaas karte hai, lekin aisa nahin kar pate
 carolina, el kaa chumban leti he or vah donon carolina ke bedroom main sambandh banane lagate hai
 Meanwhile, Bucho calls his men to town and tells them to search the bookstore and if El is there, set the bookstore on fire and kill them both
 The next day, l wakes up while Carolina is singing with her eyes closed, l is seen through the curtains shadowing two armed men
 vah chupchaap apni ek pistal or dunali bandook lene ke liye badhata he or bandook chalaane va un donon ko maarane ke dauraan vah carolina ko apane raste se hataa detaa he
 He attempts to run away from the bookstore, but then sees that there has been a fire
 vah kai aadamiyon ko maarthe hue chat par pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai or pate hai ki zamin par gire hue logon ke kaaran upar pahunchane kaa rasta bhi band he
 Carolina jumps while l shoots at the men and then throws his guitar-laden chest towards the adjacent building
 iske baad aadmi uske peeche aa jate hai or vah un par goli chalaate hue peeche kii ore kudane ke liye vivash ho jaataa he
 He turns and reaches the ground without any injury
 phir vah aakhri bache gundon ko marane ke liye grenade kaa istemaal karata he

 In this mission, an attempt has been made to bring down the rate of illiteracy of women
 buniyadi shiksha unhen anivaary he or apane swayan ke jivan or sharir par faisla karne kaa adhikaar dene, buniyadi swasthya, poshan or parivaar niyojan kii samaj ke saath ladakiyon or mahilaon ko shiksha pradaan ho rahi he
 Education of girls and women is an important step in overcoming poverty
 kuch pariwaron kaa kaam kar rahe purush durbhagyapurna durghatnaon main viklang ho jate hai
 In that case, the entire burden of the family rests on the women of the families
 mahilaon kii aisi zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye unhe shikshit kiya janaa chahie
 They can enter various fields
 mahilaayein shikshakon, doctoron, vakeelon or prashaasak ke rup main kaam kar rahi hai
 Educated women can become good mothers
 mahilaon kii shiksha se dahej samasya, berojgaare kii samasya, aadi saamaajik shanti se jude maamalon ko aasaani se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 This utterance is famous in Sanskrit- 'nasti vidyasam chakshurnasti matri samoguru:'
 This means that this world does not have the same field of learning and does not have the same guru as mother
 ’ yah baat puri tarah sach he
 The first and most impact on the child's development is that of his mother
 mata hi apane bachche ko paath padhaati he
 This initial knowledge of the child becomes a permanent basis of life, like the indelible streak on the stone
 lekin aaj puure bharatvarsh main itane asaamaajik tatv ubhar aae hai, jinhone maa-bahanon kaa rishta khatm kar diya he or jo bhoga-vilaas kii jindagi jeena adhik upyogi samajhane lage hai
 This is the reason why mothers and sisters from towns to cities are insecure
 asuraksha ke kaaran hi balaatkaar or samuhik balaatkaar jaisi anek ghatnaon ke jaal main fasakar mahilaon kaa jivan nark ban chukaa he
 In fact, it is said that the education of women is no less important than the education of any man
 samaaj kii nai ruparekha taiyaar karne main mahilaon kii shiksha purushon se sau guna adhik upyogi he
 Therefore, the government should strive for women's education
 tabhi atyaachaar jaisi ghatnaon par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 Being financially self-reliant after receiving education does not mean that a woman should become educated and take a front in front of her, considering the male as her rival
 balki vah aarthik kshetra main bhi purush ke baraabar samanta kaa adhikaar praapt karke uske saath maitrapurna sambandh ke samikarn banane main sakasham bane
 Just as the body requires food, education is necessary for mental development
 agar nari hi shikshit nahin hogi to vah na to safal gruhinee ban sakegi or na kushal mata
 The reason for the rise of child crime in the society is not the mental development of the child
 agar ek maan hi ashikshit hogi to vah apane bacchon kaa sahi maargdarshan karke unka maansik vikaas kaise kar paaegi or ek swasth samaaj kaa nirmaan evam vikaas sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, it can be said that in the future only educated women can come out of the darkness of despair and exploitation and show the right path to the family
 iskaa ek rup shiksha main striyon ko purushon kii hi tarah shaamil karne se sambandhit he
 In another way it refers to the special education system made for women
 bharat main madhya or punarjagran kaal ke dauraan striyon ko purushon se alag tarah kii shiksha dene kii dharna viksit hui thi
 It is well accepted in the present era that a woman should be educated as much as a man
 yah siddh satya he ki yadi mata shikshit na hogi to desh kii santaano kaa kadaapi kalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 Education plays a particularly important role as a basis for women's development towards adult life
 shiksha anya adhikaron ko surakshit karne ke liye ladakiyon or mahilaon ko sakasham karne main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Women continue to face difficulties due to not being able to say many problems to men
 agar mahilaayein shikshit hon to ve apane gharon kii sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar sakati hai
 Women's education helps in national and international development
 aarthik vikaas or ek raashtra ke sakal gharelu utpaada kii vruddhi main madad karata he
 Women's education helps in building a good society
