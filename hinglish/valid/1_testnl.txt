 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India

 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript

 The father of Homoeopathy medical practice is Dr
 Henniman, who was an allopathic doctor but he was dissatisfied with the side effects of allopathic medicines, so he used to take this option! He also used to work as a language translator
 During this work he got information about a medicine
 Which used to cause the same symptoms that are found in malarial fever till he made the first such medicine in China and during this time he introduced the fundamental law of homoeopathic medical practice "similia simi libus curenter "which meant healing from equal to equal! or lakshanon ke anusaar dawa kaa chunaav reperatory naamak pustak se kiya jaataa he !

 ek neeche se makaan ke teesri manzil par, su jore jansi kaa studio tha
 Jansi was the apostle of Joanna
 ek 'mein' se aayi thi or duusari 'kailafornia' se
 The two met at a very cheap hotel on Eighth Street
 donon kii kalaruchi or khaane-pine kii pasand main itani samanta thi ki donon ke mili-jule studio kaa janm ho gaya
 This was in the month of May
 navambar kii sardiyon main ek agyaat ajanabi ne, jise doctor log 'nimonia' kehete hai
 Camping in the neighborhood, he started teasing people with his freezing fingers
 purvi ilaake main to is satyanashi ne bisiyon logon kii bali lekar tahalaka machaa diya tha, parantu pashchim kii tang galiyon vaale jaal main uski chaal kuch dhimi pad gayi
 Mr
 'pneumonia' did not make any concessions even with women
 kailifornia kii aandhiyon se jiskaa khun fika pad gaya ho, aanse kisi dubli-patali ladki kaa is bhimkaay funkaarte daitya se koi muqabla to nahi tha, fir bhi usne jansi par hamalaa bol diya
 The poor poor man lay quietly on his iron cot and looked at the blank wall of the front brick house from the glass window
 ek din uskaa ilaaj karne vaale buudhe doctor ne, tharmametre jhatakate huye, su ko baahar ke baraamde main bulaakar kaha,"uske jeene kii sambhaavna rupaye main do aana he or, vah bhi tab, yadi uski ichha-shakti bani rahe
 When people do not have the desire to live and they are ready to welcome death, then they cannot even cure them
 is ladki ke dimag par bhoot savaar ho gaya he ki vah ab acchhee nahin hogi
 Is there a burden on his mind? " su boli,"or to kuch nahin, par kisi roj neples kii khadi kaa chitra banane kii uski prabal aakanksha he
 " "chitra? hum! main puch rahaa tha, ki uske jivan main koi aansa aakarshan bhi he ki jisase jeene kii ichha teevr ho? jaise koi noujvaan!" In a stinging voice of a scorpion sting, Suu said, "young man? Men and love-quit too - no doctor sir, there is no such thing
" " The doctor said, "this is the root of all evil
 doctori vidya ke anusaar jo kuch mujhase mumkin he, use kiye bina nahin chhoduunga
 But when a patient starts counting the number of people who walk with their meaning, then the strength of medicines is reduced to half
 agar tum uske jivan main koi aakarshan paidaa kar sako, jisase vaungali sardiyon main prachlit hone vaale kapado ke faishan ke bare main charchaa karne lage, to uske jeene kii sambhaavna kam se kam dooni ho jaayegi
 " doctor ke jane ke baad su apane kamare main gayi or usne ro-ro kar kai roomaal nichodne kaabil kar diye
 After a while, carrying the painting material, she arrives at Janci's room whistling
 jansi, chaddar odhe, chupchaap, bina hile-dule, khidki kii ore dekhati padi thi
 Knowing him asleep, he stopped whistling
 takhte par kaagaj lagaakar vah kisi patrika kii kahani ke liye, kalam syaahi se ek tasviir banane baithi
 In order to reach the stage of 'kala', budding artists have to make photographs for magazines
 jaise sahitya kii manzil tak pahunchane ke liye, navdith lekhakon ko patrikaon kii kahaniyaan likhni padatihai
 As soon as Su, wearing breezes like a horseman, wearing an eyeglass, began drawing lines of an Idaho shepherd's image, he heard a slow sound repeated several times
 vah sheeghra hi biimaar ke bistare ke paas gayi
 Jansi's eyes were wide open
 vah khidki se baahar dekh rahi thi or kuch ginati bol rahi thi
 But she is chanting in reverse
 vah boli,"baarah" fir kuch der baad "gyaarah" fir "das" or "nau" or tab ek saath "aath" or "saat"
 Soo glanced out of the window, eagerly
 vahaan ginaney laayak kya tha
 An open, barren square or a blank wall of a brick house twenty feet away! ek puraani, shanthi hui, jade nikali hue,
 sadabahaar kii bel diwaar kii aadhi oonchai tak chadhi hui thi
 Shishir's cold breath had broken the leaves of his body and his skeletal branches, utterly oblivious, were hanging from those broken bricks
 su ne poocha,"kya he jaani?" Jansi said in very slow voices, "six! Now she is falling fast
 teen din pehle vahaan kareeb ek sau tha
 He used to hurt them by counting their heads
 vah, ek or giri
 Now only five left
 " "five what? Jani, five what? Tell your sou!" "pattiyaan
 The leaves of that vine
 jis vakt aakhri pattee giregi, main bhi chali jaaoongi
 i have known this for three days
 kya doctor ne tumhen nahin bataaya?" With great disdain, Soo complained, "oh! i have never seen anything so stupid
" tere thik hone kaa in pattiyon se kya sambandh he? tu us bail se pyaar kiya karti thi-kyon isliye? badmaash! apni bevakoofi band kar! abhi subah hi to doctor ne bataaya tha ki tere jaldi se thik hone kii sambhaavna-thik kin shabdo main kahaan tha-haa, kaha tha, sambhaavna rupaye main chaudaa aana he or neuyark main, jab ham kisi taxi main baithte hai yaa kisi nayi imaarat ke paas se guzarate hai, tab bhi jeene kii sambhaavna isse aadhik nahin rahati
 Now try to drink a little broth and let your soo make a picture, so that by selling it to the editor, he can get some medicine for his sick girl and some bread and water for his own stomach
 " Jansi said keeping her eyes outside the window, "you don't need to bring alcohol for me anymore
 vah, ek or giri
 No, i don't even need broth
 ab sirf chaar rah gayin
 Before i get dark, i can see that last leaf falling - that's all
 fir main bhi chali jaaoongi
 " su us par jhukati hui boli,'pyaari jansi! tuje pratigya kerani hogi ki tu ankhe band rakhegi or jab tak main kaam karti hum, khidki se baahar nahin dekhegi
 This picture has to be delivered by tomorrow
 mujhe roshni kii jarurat he, varna abhi khidki band kar detii
 " jansi ne ruukhaai se poocha,"kya tum duusare kamare main baithkar tasviren nahin ban sakati?" Soo said, "I must stay with you
" iske alaava, main tuje us bel kii taraf dekhne dena nahin chaahati
 " kisi giri hui murti kii tarah nishchal or safed, apni aakhe band karti hui, jansi boli,"kaam khatm hote hi mujhe bol dena, kyoking main us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Now i want to loosen my grip and let it float down and down like those tired leaves
 " Soo said, "you trying to sleep
" main khan main majdoor kaa model banane ke liye us beharman ko bula laati hum
 Now, it came in a minute
 jab tak main nahin launtun, tu hilanaa mat!" The old Behrman lived in a room under him
 vah bhi chitrakaar tha
 He was over sixty years old
 uski dadhi, maaykele angelo kii tasviir ke mojes kii dadhi kii tarah, kisi badashakl bandar ke sir se kisi bhoot ke sharir tak laharaati maaloom padati thi
 Beraham was a failed artist
 chalis varsho se vah sadhana kar rahaa tha, lekin abhi tak apni kala ke charan bhi nahin chhu sakaa tha
 While making every picture, he would think that it would be his masterpiece, but could never make it like that
 idhar kai varsho se usne vyavsaayik yaa vigyaapan-chitra banane ke sivaay, yah dhandha hi chhod diya tha
 Being a Mandal for young artists who could not pay the fees of a professional Mandal, he used to fill his stomach nowadays
 vah jarurat se zyada sharaab pi letaa or apni us utkrasht krati ke vishay main bakawaas karata jiske sapane vah sanjota tha
 By the way, he was a very old man who used to make fun of meek men and would think of himself as the guard dog of these two young artists
 su ne beharman ko apane andhere adde main padaa paaya
 The smell of plum was coming out of it
 ek kone main vah kora canvaas khadaa tha, jo uski utkrasht kalakrati kii pahili rekha kaa ankan paane kii, pachchis varsho se baat joh rahaa tha
 He tells the old man how Jansi, fearfully imagining his leaves to be swayed by associating them with those soft bodies like his leaves, thinks that his grip on the world will be loosened
 buudhe beharman ne in murkh kalpanaaon par gusse se ankhe nikaal kar apana tiraskaar vyakt kiya
 He said, "what did you say? Are there even such fools in the world, who just because they are falling leaves with a bruised vine, imagine themselves dead? i have never heard such a thing! i am a fool like you
 Can never be a model for crazy people
 tumne uske dimag main is baat ko ghusane hi kaise diya? are, bichaari jansi!" Suu said, "she has become very weak due to illness and due to fever, such strange fantasies have arisen in her mind
 acha; buudhe beharman, tum agar mere liye model nahin bananaa chaahate to mat bano
 After all, it's the owl's tail! " berahaman chillaaya,"tu to ladki kii ladki hi rahi! kisne kaha ki main model nahin banuunga? chal, main tere saath chalata hum
 i have been whining for half an hour that i will walk! But let me say one thing - this place is not fit for a good girl like Jansi to die
 kisi din jab mai apni utkrasht kalakrati bana luungaa tab ham sab yahaan se chal chalenge
 Understand? Yes! " jab ve log upar pahunche to jansi so rahi thi
 Soo dropped the curtains on the windowsill and took Behrman to another room
 vahaan se unhone bhaybheet drashti se khidki ke baahar us bel kii ore dekha
 Then they, without uttering a single word, looked at each other
 apane saath barf liye huye thandi barsaat lagaataar gir rahi thi
 a kettle was turned upside down and Behrman was placed in a blue shirt to make it the model of a mine worker sitting on a rock
 ek ghante kii neend ke baad jab duusare din subah, su kii aankh khuli to usne dekha ki jansi jad hokar, khidki ke hare parde kii ore ankhe faad kar dekh rahi he
 In a tone of fury, he ordered, "raise the curtain, i want to see
 " Su was helpless and had to obey
 lekin yah kya! raat bhar varsha, aandhi toofaan or barf girane par bhi into kii diwaar se lagi hui, us bel main ek pattee thi
 Some dark green near her stalk, but pale yellow around its edges and anticipating further loss, that leaf was some twenty feet high from the ground yet hanging from its branch
 jansi ne kaha," yahi aakhri he
 i thought it would fall in the night
 mainen toofaan kii aawaaj bhi suni
 Well, never mind it will fall today and i will die at the same time
 " Tilting her tired face on the pillow, Soo said, "what does she say! Take care of me if not your own! What shall i do?" par jansi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 The lonely thing in this world is this 'soul', when it prepares to go on its mysterious long journey
 jyon-tyon sansar or mitrataa se baandhne vaale uske bandhan dhile padate gayi tyon-tyon uski kalpana ne use adhik jor se jakadna shuru kar diya
 The day passed, and even in the faint light of the evening, the leaf hanging from the wall-mounted vine, was visible to them
 par tabhi raat padane ke saath-saath, uttari hawaaen fir chalane lageen or varsha kii jhadiyaan khidki se takaraa kar chajje par bah aayin
 As soon as the lights came on, the merciless Jansi ordered that the curtain be lifted
 bel main pattee ab tak maujuud thi
 Jansi kept staring at it for long
 usne su ko pukaara, jo chauke main stove par murgi kaa shorwa bana rahi thi
 Jancy said, "sudi, I'm a very bad girl
 kudarat kii kisi shakti ne, us antim pattee ko vahiin roak kar, mujhe yah bataa diya ki main kitni dusht hum
 To die in this way is a sin
 laa, mujhe thodaa-sa shorwa de or kuch doodh main jehar milakar laa de
 But no, before that give me a little mirror and put some pillows at my head so that i can see you sitting and cooking
 " After an hour she said, "sudi, i think i will make a picture of the Bay of Naples at some time
" " In the evening, Dr
 Saheb came again, made some excuse and went outside and met him
 su de durbal kaanpate haath ko apane haathon main lekar doctor sahab bole, "ab sambhaavna aath aana maani ja sakati he
 If the care is good then you will win and now i am going to see each other on the floor below
 kya naam he uskaa- beharman!-shaayad koi kalakaar he-nimonia ho gaya he
 He is very weak and bad man, and he is very loud
 bachane kii koi sambhaavna nahin
 Today i will send him to the hospital
 vahaan aaraam zyada milegaa
 " duusare din doctor ne su se kaha,"jansi, ab khatre se baahar he
 You won ab to sirf pathya or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he
 " us din shaam ko su, jansi ke palang ke paas aakar baith gayi
 She was weaving a pale bouquet of blue wool, restless
 usne takiye ke us ore se, apni baanh, su ke gale main daal di
 Soo said, "my naive cat, you have one thing to say
 aaj subah aspataal main, mistar beharman kii nimonia se mratyu ho gayi
 He had been ill only twice
 parason subah hi chaukeedaar ne use apane kamare main dard se tadapata paaya tha
 His clothes — even shoes — were completely soaked and cold as ice
 koi nahin jaanata ki ansi bhayanak raat main vah kahaan gaya tha
 But a burning lantern, a cistern, two-four brushes and some green and yellow paint were found on the panel from his room
 jaraa khidki se baahar to dekh-diwaar ke paas kii us antim pattee ko
 Have you ever wondered why that leaf does not move even in such a storm and storm? Pyari Sakhi, this was Behrman's masterpiece, the night the last leaf fell, the night he produced it

 Farmers who have contracted the supply of liquid milk for human consumption often manage their herd so that they continue to deliver milk throughout the year or maintain the required minimum milk production
 This is done by mating cows outside of their natural mating time so that when they are in the herd, a cow gives maximum production and this rotation continues throughout the year

 When milking by hand became inefficient or labor intensive, machines were used for milking cows
 The milking unit is a part of the machine to extract milk from a udder
 yah ek panja he, jo chaar chuchuk kaps, lambii doodh tub, lambii dhadkan tub or ek compymanak se bana he
 The claws are attached to a long pulse tube and the short pulse tube to the chukuk tube and the long pulse milk tube

 Patti-style sheds - This type of milking facility was first developed after milking in an open paddock
 ek lambii sankeern, patali, ek taraf se jhuki or khuli hui lambii shed kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 The cows were kept on the open side of the yard and they were made to stand in a strip while milking
 aamtaur par gaayon ko ek shrinkhalaa main niyantrit rakhane ke liye unke peeche ke pairon ko rassi se baandh diya jaataa tha
 The cows could not move much from their place and could not kick the milker when the milk milker sat on a stool and extracted milk in a bucket
 jab prayek gaay se doodh nikaalane kaa kaam samaapt ho jaataa to unhen waapas apni jagah par bhej diya jaataa tha
 In Britain, this type of shed was developed by Rex Patterson, with six mobile standing sheds on which cows would be erected so that shepherds would not have to bend too low
 The milking device was modern-day, a vacuum from a pump, pulsation, claw with pipe, armor and liners that excite and suck milk from the teat causing a vacuum from a claw piece along the pipe
 The milk goes into a churn through the cooler
 jaise hi jhund ke aakaar main vruddhi hoti thi prayek pattee ke saamne ek darwaja sthapit kar diya jaataa tha taaki jaise hi gaay ko duhane kaam puraa ho, pairon main bandhi rassi ko kholkar dur se hi us daravaaje ko kholkar gaay ko baahar charne ke liye bhej diya jaataa tha
 The door used to be locked, the next cow secured in a strip
 jab doodh dene kii mashin kii shuruuaat kii gai to ek jode main gaayon se doodh nikaala jaataa tha tabatak anya ko doodh dene ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 At the end of the earlier machine cup was applied to the other cow
 yah bilkul swingover doodh duhane kaa parlor ke samaan tha jiskaa varnan neeche kiya gaya he
 With the increase in the number of herds, instead of increasing the number of strips, milk was easily milked from cows by double doubling the number of cups
 ek shed main ghante bhar main 8 pattiyon ke saath ek vyakti dwaara 50 gaayon ko duh liya jaataa he, baar-baar gaayon ke liye ek hi chuchee cap kaa upyog karne se sankraman, stan kii sujan sanchaarit hone kaa khatra rahata he
 Some farmers have found their own ways to disinfect cows groups
 herringbon milking parlor -herringbon milking shed yaa parlor main, gaay ekal tareeke se pravesh karti hai or unhen galiyare main lagbhag lambavatt khadaa kar doodh duhanevaale apana kaam karte hai than or chuchuk kii dhulaai ke baad or doodh dene kii mashin ke cap ko gaayon ko laga diya jaataa, unke pichley pairon ke peeche se, kaam karne ke kshetra ke donon kinaaron par
 bade herringbon shed main do logon ke saath 600 gaayon se kushaltapurvak doodh nikaala ja saktaa he
 Swingover milking parlor - Swingover parlor is exactly the same as herringbone parlor with only one set of milking cups between two rows of cows, which are shared between the cows, with one side replaced by the other after milking
 It is done

 Rotary Milking Shed - Rotary milking sheds have a rotating wheel with approximately 12 to 100 separate stalls for cows around the outer end
 ek "achche" rotary ke saath ek saath 24-32 stallon ek yaa duhane waalon dwaara sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 The cycle is driven by an electric motor and rotates at such a speed that milk is completely released from one cow at a time
 As soon as a stall is empty, a cow steps in from the entrance and starts walking with the wheel
 isprakaar agali gaay agle khaali stall ke taraf chali jaati he
 The operator or milk weaners clean the nipples and attach them to the cup and do any other food or whatever work is necessary
 jabatak doodh nikaala jaataa he gaayen manch par hi rahati hai
 The milker, or an automatic device, removes the cup of the milking machine and holds the cow's back and leaves it at an exit just before the entrance
 rotary pranali ek hajaar gaayon se bhi adhik bade jhund kaa doodh duhane main sakasham he
 Automatic Milking Sheds - Automatic milking or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in Australia, New Zealand and many European countries
 Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking method
 isamen gaayon ko swechha se din ho yaa raat ke kisi bhi samay doodh dene ke liye khud ko prastut karte hai, haalanki dohraane kaa daura computer software ke madhyam se kisaan dwaara simit kiya ja saktaa he
 a robot arm cleans the device and the nipple before being used for milking, while the gates move the cow out of the way automatically, during which the farmer does not need to be present
 The entire process is controlled by a computer
 yahaan swat: pranali kaa vivaran diya gaya he- Supplementary Equipment in the Shed - Farmers soon realized that a milking shed was a good supplementary diet for cows that could be fueled by a lack of local diet or 'cows' goodness and production
 prayek puaal ke box ko is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he ki gaay ke aate hi use khaanaa mil jaae taaki duhane ke samay main vah khaati rahe
 ek computer prayek jaanavar ke liye sahi poorak rashan ko pard saktaa he
 In the stalls of a close alternative 'out-of-parlor-feeder', a transponder around the neck of the cow, it was programmed to benefit by providing the main ration for each cow, depending on the age and production capacity of the cow 
 shed ke pravesh dwaar par gaayon ko pakad kar shed main rakhane ke liye shed yard ek mahatvapurn saadhan he
 a powered gate ensures how cows are kept closed
 deyari farm par pani bahut mahatvapurn he: gaayon dinabhar main 20 galen pani pi leti hai or baaki pani kii jarurat shed ko saaf or svachh rakhane ke liye hoti he
 Pumping and reservoir facilities are common in milking locations
 pani ko doodh ke saath garmi hastantaran dwaara garam kiya ja saktaa he
 The milk coming from the cow is transported around the cup by air inlet in a special claw to a storage container near it
 vahaan se yah ek yantric pump dwaara nikaala or garmi excanger dwaara thanda kiya jaataa he doodh ke bade bartan yaa thok tanks main sangrahit kar, aamtaur par prashitit kar sansaadhit kiya jaataa he Subject: aise deshon main, jahaan gaay saal bhar baahar jaakar charati hai vahaan bahut kam apshisht niptaan karnaa padataa he
 The most waste milk is at the milking shed, where animal waste is liquefied and poured with ponds anaerobic bacteria mixed with effluent or with a solid pump
 sansaadhit pani or poshak tatwon ko pump dwaara waapas nikaalkar urvarak ke rup main sinchai ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Surplus animals are converted to sacrificial meat and to other products
 sambaddhit doodh processing kaarkaanon main, aamtaur par dhulaai ke baad bachaa hua ganda pani hi apshisht hota he jise parishkrut karne ke baad jalmaarg main lautaa diya jaataa he
 This is very different from half a century ago when the main products were butter, cheese, and casein, and the rest of the milk was disposed of as waste
 aise kshetron main jahaan gaayon puure varsh bhar rakhe jate hai, apshisht kii samasya bahut jatil hoti he bachi hui khaadya saamagree he or beding apshisht ko bhi sangrahit kar nipataara karnaa padataa he
 The size of this problem can be seen in the standing enclosure where such dairy is run

 Attempting to dispose of huge amounts of milk can be a major disaster if anything goes wrong or something goes wrong with milking, transportation or processing facilities
 agar sadak par tanker palat jaataa he to sadak par bachaav dal ko 20-45 hajaar galen doodh ko niptaana padataa he

 kravyadant yaa 'criodonta' ek pracheen pashu-varg he
 Animals of this class are considered to be the ancestors of today's carnivorous animals
 yahi is jati ke jeevon kii visheshta he
 It appears that this class of organisms had a distinct lineage, the first branch of insectivores from the Cretaceous and Paleocene eras
 kravyadant vikaas kii praarambhik dasha main the or ketahariyon ke samaan hi ve aakaar main bhi chote the
 Similarly, it can also be said that in the tradition of development of carnivorous animals, these observations were in the lowest position
 mansabhakshan kaa swabhaav unke daanton tathaa shaareerik rachana ke kramik vikaas se prakat hota he
 Meat eating is the specialty of animals of this caste, but there were no teeth to cut meat in these early cravings
 inke daanton kii panktiyaan pratham premoller or antim molr ko chhodkar iske cheer faad karanevaale daanton kaa vikaas ho gaya he or ve anya kravyadanton tathaa iske purvaj kitahari praaniyon ke isi prakaar ke daanton ke sadrush tathaa saral nahin rah gaye hai
 Often full grown
 kalantar main inke daanton kii banaavat main vibhinnata hone lagi or kuch kute ke cheerfaad karanevaale kenine daant kii bhanti bade or nukile hone lage
 The architecture of these ancient carnivorous carnivores was basically similar to that of ancient insectivores
 coup tathaa mathew naamak visheshgyon ke matanusaar peleosin tathaa eosin yugon ke micidi jantu kravyadant ke hi parivaar ke the
 According to both of them they originated from the animals of the Maisidi Vyaghra family and from the animals of the dog family
 is prakaar nukile daantvaale aadhunik mansabhakshi varg ke jantuon ke purvaj peleosin yug ke kravyadant hi hai
 These small carnivorous creatures lived in small bushes or forests
 apane shikaar kii khoj main tathaa apni raksha ke liye ye pedo bhi chadh jate the
 Among them were some carnivores, some omnivores and some insectivores
 sada galaa maance khaanevaale in kravyadanton main se kuch kaa mastishk bahut hi chote aakaar kaa tha or unki samajhadaari bhi nimnatam avasthaa main thi
 Lack of understanding may be one of the reasons for this category being quickly destroyed
 kravyadanton kaa vibhaajan nimnlikhit teen upvargon main kiya gaya he : They are also known as Arctosioniodae
 ye tershari yug ke kravyadant hai, jo peleosin yug main apni sankhya kii charam seemaa par pahunch gaye the
 After this, their numbers started decreasing rapidly, yet they existed in the Eocene era
 europe ke peleosin yug ke upree tahon ke arctoceon aajkal ke richon ke samaan he
 The only resemblance of his works with bears
 inke anguuthon main khur the or inke daanton kii rachana bhi atyant saral thi
 They are also referred to as Masonicidi, the second caste of Kravadantas
 is jati ke kravyadanton main bade aakaar main viksit hone kaa bhi abhas prathit hota he
 Now the specialty is seen in the composition of their teeth
 inke daant cheerfaad ke upyukt nahin hote the, parantu inke dadh ke daanton main ek vishesh prakaar ke kund dikhaai padate hai, jinaki sahaayta se is upvarg ke praani apane shikaar tathaa unki haddiyon ko bahut saralata se todate or chabate the
 Their feet were like wolves, with fingers far apart and nails clipped
 inamen aajkal ke lakadabagghon kii bhanti panje nahin the, varan chote-chote khur the
 The importance of these cations of the Masonicidi subclass is due to their specific size
 mongolia kaa antim acreodi kravyadanton main sabase dderghaayu tha
 Its skull was more than three feet long
 kravyadanton kii teesri jati he
 His specialty is tearing teeth
 duusare jaanwaron par akraman karke ye jivan nirvaah karte the
 His anatomy was particularly favorable for this work
 vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main hi yah upvarg do-shakhaon oxinidi tathaa hinodontidi main bant gaya tha
 The only difference between the crystals of these two branches was that the first molar of the upper part of the first class and the second molar tooth of the lower part were now completely cut
 isi prakaar duusari shrenee ke kravyadanton main upree bhaag ke duusare molr or nichle jabade main tisare molr kaatane ke kaam aane lage the
 In the Paleocene era, the development of cravings of this caste reached its culmination, but only after that their decline started at a rapid pace
 is jati ke praaniyon ke jivit rahane ke chihn hamen eosin yug main bhi milte hai
 The cravings of this caste lived on the prey of the ancient ancient Shaf class or hoofed creatures
 in ‘shaf’ varg ke praaniyon ke samaapt hone par kravyadanton kii yah vanshashakha bhi dhire-dhire lupt ho gai or eligosin main to in kravyadanton ke sthaan par inase milte julate nae jivan kaa pradurbhaav ho gaya tha, jinhen phiciped kehete hai
 Among them, the composition of life was of high order, but they were also of small size and were of the same carnivorous nature and size as their ancestors

 Wild animals are called every tree, plant, animal and other animal that has not been domesticated by humans
 junglee jeev duniya ke sabhi paritantron main paae jate hai, jinamein registan, van, ghasbhumi, maidan, parvat or shahari kshetra sabhi shaamil hai
 Wildlife is a class of wild animals that live in the forests and mountains outside human shelters
 iske vipareet bahut se gilahariyon, kabutaron or chamagaadadon jaise junglee jeev wanon se baahar shaharon main bhi basate hai
 Humans have domesticated many wild animals for their worldwide use, which has a profound impact on the environment
 bahut si samskritiyon main paaltu or junglee jeevon main gaharaa antar samajha jaataa he
 Often, animals and birds and fish are only recognized in the simple and legal definition of wild animals and do not include members of the flora, pests and insects
 singh, baagh, hathi, siyaar, lomadee, boar, lakadbaggha, jiraph, khargosh, hiran, barasingha, chital kuch pramukh vanya jeev hai
 Tallapadu has a village in Kadap district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 band jalsambar yaa samaavruth jalsambar bhugol main aise jalsambar kshetra ko kaha jaataa he jisamen varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani ekatrit ho kar kisi nadi ke zariye samudr yaa mahaasaagar main bahane kii bajaay kisi sarovar, daldali kshetra yaa shushk kshetra main jaakar vahin ruk jaataa he
 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls
 yah chalate pani ke samooh ek-dusre se sangam karte rahete hai jab tak ke ek hi badi nadi na ban jaae
 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect
 aisa hi kuch madhya asia ke aral sagar ke saath hua he

 Paracetamol poisoning is the leading cause of fatal liver failure in the Western world, and the drug is the most commonly reported overdose in the United States, United Nations, Australia, and New Zealand
 peracetamol kii vyutpatti koltar se hui he or yah "anilin analgesic" naamak dawaaon ke varg kaa ek bhaag he
 It is an active metabolizer of phenacetin, which was once popular as an analgesic and antipyretic, but unlike phenacetin and its combination, paracetamol is not considered to be carcinogenic at therapeutic doses
 donon shabd acitaminophen or peracetamol ek hi yogic ke rasinic naam se aaye hai, yah yogic he: pera -acita ileminophino l or pera -acita ilemi nophenol kuch sandarbhon main, ise sankshipt rup main keval APAP kaha jaataa he, yah sankshipt rup N-acetile -pera-aminophenol ke liye he
 Acetenolide was the first aniline derivative that had analgesic and antipyretic properties and it was very early in 1886 that A

 In 1877, at the Johns Hopkins University, the hormones had already been synthesized by paracetamol through the reduction of "P" -nitro phenol with tin in northrop Morse glacial acetic acid
 lekin 1887 main pehali baar naidanik aushadh vigyaani joseph won mering ne peracetamol kaa marijon par pareekshan kiya
 In 1893, von Mering published a paper that reported on the clinical results of paracetamol with phenacetin and another aniline derivative
 won mering ne daawa kiya ki, phenacetin ke vipareet, peracetamol kii methemoglobinemia utpann karne kii maamuli pravriti he
 Paracetamol was quickly removed in favor of phenacetin
 phenacetin kii bikri ne bear ko ek agrani pharmasyuthical company ke rup main sthapit kiya
 Aspirin was partially heavy on phenacetin, phenacetin was introduced to the drug in 1899 by Heinrich Dresser, phenacetin remained popular for decades, especially the over-the-counter "head pain mixtures" that were widely advertised , Typically consisted of phenacetin, an aminopyrine derivative or aspirin, caffeine, and sometimes a barbiturate

 In 1947, David Lester and Leon Greenberg found strong evidence that paracetamol is a major metabolizer of acetanilide in human blood, and in a later study they reported that albino rats do not produce methemoglobinemia even when given large doses of paracetamol
 Happened
 jarnal of ferrmkology or experimental therapautix, ke sitambar 1948 ke ank main prakashit hue teen patron main Bernard brodiebarnarda broady, Julius axelrodjuliyasa accerold or fredrick flinn ne adhik vishisht vidhiyon kaa upyog karte hue yah sunishchit kiya ki peracetamol maanav rakt main acetanilide kaa mukhya metabolismak he or yah bataaya ki yah apane purvagami kii tarah ek prabhavotpadak analgesic he
 He also suggested that the production of methemoglobinemia in humans is mainly through another metabolic phenylhydroxylamine
 iske baad 1949 main broady or accerold ke dwaara die gaye ek patr main yah bataaya gaya ki phenacetin metabolizam ke dwaara peracetamol bhi banaati he
 This led to the "discovery of paracetamol once again"
 It has been suggested that infection with paracetamol with 4-aminophenol, a substance from which it was synthesized by von Mering, may have led to its erroneous findings
 peracetamol ko sabase pehle 1953 main sanyukt rajya america main sterling-vinthorp company ke dwaara bazaar main laayaa gaya, is company ne ise aspirin se behatar bataaya kyonki ise bacchon or ulcer se peedit logon ko bhi surakshit rup se diya ja saktaa tha
 Tylenol, currently the most well-known brand for paracetamol in the United States, was founded in 1955 when the macneil lab began selling paracetamol as a pain and fever reliever for children, its brand name was Tylenol Children's
 Elixir — the word "tylenol" was derived from the abbreviation para -acetyl aminophenol
 1956 main, sanyukt raashtra main peracetamol kii 500 milligram kii goliyaan trade naam penadol ke naam se bechi jane lageen, ise sterling drug incorporation kii ek sahaayak freedrick sterns and company ke dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Panadol was originally available only on doctor's advice for pain and fever relief and was being promoted as being "harmless to the stomach", as other analgesic factors at the time were aspirin, which was the stomach
 Hurts 1963 main, peracetamol British Pharmacopoeia ke saath jud gayi or isane tabhi se ek aise analgesic kaarak ke rup main lokapriyata praapt kar lee he, jiske parshv prabhaav bahut kam hai or yah anya aushadhi karkon ke saath bahut kam abhikriyaayein karti he
 Issues about paracetamol's safety made its widespread acceptance impossible until 1970, but in 1980 sales of paracetamol exceeded aspirin in many countries, including the United Nations
 isse phenacetin vyavsaayik rup se bilkul band ho gayi, kyonki yah analgesic nephropathy or rakt kii vishaaktata kaa kaaran thi
 US patents of paracetamol have long expired and generic versions of the drug, drug price competition and the Patent Period Restoration Act, 1984 are widely available, although some specific drugs containing tylenol were protected until 2007
 3 sitambar ko daayar america patent 6,126,967 ko "vistrut relies acitaminophen kanon" ke liye jari kiya gaya tha
 Paracetamol consists of a benzene ring core, to which the paraoxide is bound by a hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom substitution reaction of an amide group
 amide samooh acetamide hota he
 It is broadly a conjugated system, because a paired pair on hydroxyl oxygen, benzene pie clouds, nitrogen coupled pair, p chamber on carbonyl carbon and paired pair on carbonyl oxygen are all conjugated
 do sakriyan samoohon kii upasthiti bhi benzin valay ko electron snehi aromatic pratisthaapan ke liye ucch abhikriyasheel banaati he
 Since all substituents are ortho, para-directed and para relative to each other, all positions on the ring are more or less equally active
 sanyugman oxigen or nitrogen kii kshariyata ko bahut kam kar detaa he, jabaki finokaside anayan par viksit visthanikaran ke madhyam se hydroxil ko amleey banaata he
 Compared to many other drugs, paracetamol is easier to synthesize, because it lacks stereocenter
 iske parinamswaroop, ek sterio-chaynaatmak sanshleshan ko dizin karne kii koi zarurat nahin hoti he
 Industrial synthesis of paracetamol usually begins with nitrobenzene
 ek ek-padiya apchayan acitamidikaran abhikriya thayo-acetate ke dwaara madhyasth ho sakati he
 In the laboratory, paracetamol can be readily formed by nitration of phenol from sodium nitrate, separation of the desired p-nitrophenol from the ortho-byproduct, and reduction of the nitro group from sodium borohydride
 iske baad parinami p-aminophenol kaa acetic enhidride se asitelikaran kiya jaataa he
 In this reaction, phenol is strongly reactive, thus the reaction requires very slow tending conditions
 : p-aminophenol can be obtained by amide hydration of paracetamol
 is prakaar se taiyaar p -aminophenol or jo vanijyik rup se uplabdh metol se sambandhit he, kaa upyog photography main ek develper ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Paracetamol is commonly available as a tablet, capsules, liquid suspension, suppository, intercostal, and intramuscular form
 aam vayask kii khuraaq 500 se 1000 milligram tak hoti he
 a daily dose of up to 4 grams is recommended for an adult
 doctor dwaara bataayi gayi maatra main, peracetamol aam taur par bacchon, navjaat shishuon or vayaskon ke liye bhi surakshit hoti he
 Penadol, which is marketed in Africa, Asia, Central America and Australia, is the most widely available brand that is sold in more than 80 countries
 uttari america main, peracetamol ko saamaanya rup main yaa ek vyapaarik naam se bechaa jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye tylinol,, anacin-3, tempra or detril 
 haalanki britain main brands naam se yukt peracetamol uplabdh he, phir bhi bina brands kii saamaanya peracetamol ko bhi saamaanya rup se bechaa jaataa he
 In Europe, the most common brands of paracetamol are Epheralgan and Dolipren
 bangladesh main sabase lokapriy brands napa he jise beximco pharma dwaara nirmit kiya jaataa he
 In some combinations paracetamol is with opioidacidin, sometimes called co-codamol
 sanyukt rajya america or canada main, iskaa vipanan tylinol # 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, ke naam se kiya jaataa he, jisamen kramshah 8–10 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg kodin hoti he
 In the US, this combination is available only on doctor's advice, while the lowest capacity combination is available over the counter in Canada and in other countries, other capabilities may also be available over the counter
 in sanyojanon ke saamaanya rup bhi uplabdh hai
 In the UK and many other countries, this combination is marketed under the names of Tylex CD and Penadine
 anya naam hai captin, dysprol, diamadon, fensom, hedex, mekasalen, nofedol, peralen, pediepirin, parfalgan or solpadin
 peracetamol ko anya opioid ke saath bhi sanyojit kiya jaataa he, jaise diahydrocodin, jise ko-dydramol, oxicodon, yaa hidrocodon ke naam se janaa jaataa he, america main iskaa vipanan kramshah parcosette or vicodinake rup main kiya jaataa he
 Another very commonly used analgesic combination is found to contain propoxyphene napsilate with paracetamol, which is sold from a brand called Darvocet
 peracetamol, kodin or kalmative doxillemin saxinet kaa ek sangyojan sindol yaa marsindol ke naam se bechaa jaataa he
 Paracetamol is used to create a multi-component combination for migraine headaches, typically containing butalbital and paracetamol with caffeine without caffeine and sometimes with codeine
 peracetamol ko aam taur par gaiyr-steroid pratishodh dawaaon ke saath vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, lekin ise ek nahin mana jaataa he
 Like all drugs of this class, its main mechanism of action is inhibition of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are the main mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever
 isliye, sabhi nsaids main prati-shoth, analgesic, antipyretic gun hote hai
 The specific reactions of each NSAID drug depend on their pharmacological properties, distribution and metabolism
 jahaan ek ore aspirin kii tulana main peracetamol main analgesic or antipyretic gun hote hai, yah prati-shoth kriyaaon par kaary karne main asafal hai, kyonki peracetamol shoth ke ghaavon main upasthit parakside ke ucch str ke liye samvedansheel hota he
 However, the mechanism by which paracetamol reduces fever and pain is still widely debated as paracetamol reduces the production of prostaglandins
 aspirin bhi prostaglandins ke utpaadan kaa sandman karti he, lekin peracetamol ke vipareet isaki prati-shoth kriya kam hoti he
 Similarly, aspirin inhibits the production of the pre-quenching chemical thromboxane, while paracetamol does not
 aspirin ko anzimon ke cychlooxijinej varg ko sandamit karne ke liye janaa jaataa he or peracetamol kii aspirin kii kriya ke saath aanshik samanta ke kaaran, is vishay par adhik anusandhan ho rahaa he ki peracetamol bhi COX ko sandamit karti he yaa nahin
 yah ab spasht he ki peracetamol kam se kam do pathon ke madhyam se kriya karti he
 The COX class of enzymes is responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to a temporary molecule, prostaglandin H2, which turns into a myriad of other pre-inflammatory compounds
 clasical shoth virdohi, jaise nsaids, is pad ko roak dete hai
 Only when suitably oxidized COX enzyme is highly active
 peracetamol COX anzime ke oxykrut rup ko kam karata he, is prakaar se ise purv-shoth rasayanon ko banane se roktaa he
 
 Thus prostaglandin in the CNS reduces the set point of the hypothalamus in the heat regulatory center by reducing the amount of E2
 ek anya anzime COX3 kaa sandman peracetamol ke maamle main vishesh rup se prabhavit hota he
 COX3 is not seen outside of the CNS paragraph text
 peracetamol antarjaat kenabinoid pranali kaa bhi niyaman karti he
 Paracetamol forms AM404 via metabolism, the compound has many functions; Most importantly, it inhibits the endogenous cannabinoid / vanilloid anandamide by the neuron
 jisase sharir ke mukhya dard grahi, TRPV1 kaa sakriyan hota he
 In addition, AM404 inhibits the sodium channel, as do anesthesia lidocaine and procaine
 aisa paaya gaya he ki in main se koi bhi kriya dard ko kam karti he or ye peracetamol kii sambhav kriya pranali ho sakati he, haalanki yah darshaya gaya he ki kenabinoid grahi ko sandamit karke or kenabinoid kii kisi bhi kriyavidhi ko roak kar, peracetamol analgesic prabhaav ko kho detii he, iske liye kaha jaataa he ki isaki dard nivarak kriya main antarjaat kenabinoid pranali kii madhyasthata hoti he
 According to one theory, paracetamol works by inhibiting the COX-3 isoform of the COX class of enzymes
 yah anzime, jab kutton main kaary karata he, ani COX anzimon kii tarah kaaphi samanta darshata he, purv-shoth rasayan banataa he or chaynaatmak rup se peracetamol ke dwaara sandamit hota he
 However, some research suggests that in humans and mice, the COX-3 enzyme occurs without inflammatory action
 ek or sambhaavna yah he ki peracetamol cychlooxijinej ko roktaa he,, lekin aisa shoth ke vaataavaran main hota he, jahaan peroccides kaa sandran ucch hota he, peracetamol kii oxikaran avasthaa ucch hoti he jo isaki kriya ko rokatii he
 This means that paracetamol does not have a direct effect on the location of inflammation, but instead acts by reducing heat, etc
 by acting in the CNS where the atmosphere is not oxidative
 sateek kriyapranali jiske dwaara mana jaataa he ki peracetamol kaary karti he, yah COX-3 ko prabhavit karti he yaa nahin, yah vivaadit he
 Metabolism of paracetamol initially occurs in the liver, producing non-toxic products
 teen metabolizam maarg ullekhneey hai: The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system metabolizes paracetamol and produces a small but important alkylike metabolomic NAPQI
 NAPQI ab anutkramntic rup se glutetheon ke salphhaidrill samooh ke saath sanyugmit ho jaataa he
 The end products obtained from these three routes are inactive, non-toxic and are eventually excreted by the kidneys
 tisare maarg main, haalanki, madhyasth utpaada NAPQI vishaiylla hota he
 NAPQI is primarily responsible for the toxic effect of paracetamol; This is a classic example of poisoning
 NAPQI kaa utpaadan praathmik rup se cytochrome P450 ke do isoenzimon ke karan hota he: CYP2E1 or cyp1a2
haalanki P450 jin atyadhik bahurupi hota he or peracetamol kii vishaaktata main vyaktigat antar tisare isoengim CYP2D6 ke kaaran maane jate hai
 Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 may contribute to significantly different rates of production of NAPQI
 iske alaava, vyaktiyon ko unki CYP2D6 abhivyakti ke staron ke aadhaar par "extensive", "ultrarapid" or "poor" metabolizamakon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa ha i
 haalanki anya P450 anzimon kii tulana main CYP2D6 kam seemaa tak peracetamol ke metabolizam se NAPQI banaata he, isaki kriya extensive or ultrarepid metabolizamakon main peracetamol kii vishaaktata main yogadan karti he, jab peracetamol kii bahut adhik khuraaq le lee jaati he
 At normal doses, NAPQI is quickly uncontrolled by conjugation
 adhik khuraaq le lene ke baad or sambhavatya extensive or ultrarepid metabolizamakon main bhi, yah nirvishikaran kaa maarg santrupt ho jaataa he or ant main NAPQI sanchit ho jaataa he
 The WHO recommends that paracetamol be given to children only when the fever is above 38
5 ° C
 101
3 ° F) peracetamol aspirin ke liye ek upyukt vikalp he, vishesh rup se un rogiyon main jinamein gestric amla kaa srav bahut adhik maatra main hota ho yaa rakt srav kaa samay adhik ho
 jahaan ek ore aspirin kii tulana main peracetamol main analgesic ore antipyretic gun hote hai, iskaa prati-shoth prabhaav kamjor hota he
 Since paracetamol can be easily tolerated, it is also available without a prescription, as it does not have gastric side effects like aspirin, it has become a common household medicine in recent years
 anya saamaanya analgesic jaise aspirin ore ibuprophen ke vipareet, peracetamol kii prati-shoth kriya kaaphi kam hoti he, isliye ise gaiyr-steroid prati-shoth dawa nahin mana gaya he
 Regarding the comparative efficacy, studies show conflicting results when compared with nsaids
 vayaskon main osteoarthritis ke puraane dard ke ek yadrichhik niyantrit pareekshan main paaya gaya ki peracetamol ore ibuprophen samaan rup se laabhakaari he
 However, a randomized controlled trial of acute skeletal muscle pain in children found that the standard dose of ibuprofen provides greater comfort than the standard dose of paracetamol
 bataayi gayi maatra main, peracetamol amashay ke astr ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaati he, rakt ke skandan ko bhi utana hi prabhavit karti he, jitna ki nsaids yaa vrikkon ke kaaryon ko prabhavit karti hai
 However, some studies have shown that the use of high doses increases the risk of high gastrointestinal complications such as catarrhal bleeding
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki aspirin yaa peracetamol kaa adhik upyog-prati varsh 300 gram -ek aisi sthiti se sambandhit he jisamen vrikk chote, dantedaar, ore kelsikrut ho jate hai
 Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy and does not affect the closure of fetal ductus arteriosus like nsaids
 aspirin ke vipareet, yah bacchon main surakshit he, kyonki peracetamol viral beemaari se yukt bacchon main reye syndrome ke jokhim se sambandhit nahin he
 Unlike nsaids and opioid analgesic drugs, paracetamol has not been shown to cause excitement or mood changes in any way
 2008 main, bacchon main peracetamol ke dirghakaalik parshv prabhaavon ke sabase bade adhyayan kaa prakaashan da lanset main kiya gaya
 Studies on more than 200,000 children in 31 countries found that paracetamol use for fever in the first year of life was associated with an increase in asthma symptoms at the age of 6–7 years and 6–7 with the first year of life
 Paracetamol use even at the age of age is associated with an increase in rhinocystivitis and eczema
 lekhakon ne yah sweekaar kiya ki unki "khojein keval sanketon se praapt bhi ho sakati hai", udhaaharan ke liye yah sambandh saamaanya nahin ho saktaa he, lekin peracetamol se ilaaj kii ja rahi beemaari ke kaaran bhi saktaa he or yah bhi kaha gaya ki is vishay main or shodh kii aavashyaktaa he
 In addition, numerous editors, comments, correspondence and their responses were published in The Lancet, which related to the findings and types of this study
 britain kii niamak sanstha da medisin and healthcare products regulatory agency, ne bhi is anusandhan kii samiksha kii or in aankadon par kai vyakhyaayein prakashit kii gayin or mata pita, swasthya peshewaron or anya dekhbhaal karne waalon ko yah salaah di gayi: "is nae adhyayan kaa parinaam bacchon main vartmaan dishanirdesh main kisi bhi prakaar ke upyog main parivartan ko aavashyak nahin banaata he
 Paracetamol is a safe and suitable alternative to analgesics in children
 is shodh se bacchon main antipyretic ke upyog ke sambandh main dishanirdeshon ko parivartit karne ke aparyaapt pramaan milte hai

 kisi company ke karmchaariyon yaa kisi samudaay ke nagarikon ko sanghathan ke nirnay lene kii prakriya main sahabhaagi banaakar unka shashaktikaran karnaa sahabhaagi prabandhan kehalaata he
 There are two important aspects of industrial relations, the aspects of conflict and cooperation
 aadhunik udyog prabandh or shram ke sahyog ke kaaran hi chalate rahete hai
 This collaboration happens informally automatically in planning
 udyogon kaa chalate rahanaa donon k hiton main aavashyak he
 At the same time, protests are also found in some interests of management and workers
 jisase unke bich sangharsh bhi hota rahata he
 Many interests of managers and managers are not opposed, due to which they continue to cooperate
 inhi ubhay hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue shram-prabandh sahyog kii kai aupchaarik sansthaayen sthapit kii gai hai, jo niyamit rup se ubhay samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karti he
 These organizations are called by many names; Such as labor-management cooperation, joint consultation, co-determination, joint decision making, workers 'participation in industry, or workers' participation in management
 saadharantah uparyukt sabhi shabd-samooh kaa prayog samaan arthon main kiya jaataa he, lekin unamem kabhi-kabhi sahabhaagita ke vishisht roopon, staron yaa uski maatra ke aadhaar par antar bataane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 There are several objectives of labor participation in the management, the following are the main ones
 utpaadakta main vruddhi prabandh or shram ke ubhay hit main he
 Increase in productivity leads to higher wages of workers and achievement of different types of facilities and more benefits to the employer
 shram-prabandh sahyog se utpaadakta yaa kaushal main vruddhi kii ja sakati he tathaa utpaadit vastuon kii gunvattta main sudhaar laayaa ja saktaa he
 This can also help prevent wastage and reduce costs
 utpaadakta main vruddhi ke fal k vibhaajan ke silsile main shramikon or prabandhakon yaa niojak ke bich matbhed ho saktaa he, lekin use badhaane yaa usamen sudhaar laane ke sambandh main unke bich virodh kii baat nahi uthati
 Where there is proper system of division of fruits of productivity growth, most of the participation of workers in management, productivity-enhancement, tools and machines or proper use, wastage prevention, maintaining the quality of goods produced, production-hours maximum Improvement in use, manufacturing process and physical condition of work is specially included
 kai logon ke mat main aadhunik udyogon main un vishyon ke nirdhaaran main shramikon ko sahabhaagita ke avasar pradaan karnaa aavashyak he, jinase ve pratyaksh rup se sabanddh rahete hai
 In collective bargaining, the workers take a lot of pressure off the employer, but this does not give them a regular opportunity to participate in the day-to-day management
 samuhik saudebaaji ke vikaas, shramsanghon kii shakti main vruddhi tathaa niojakon kii pravriti main parivartan ke kaaran aisi sansthaaon ke gathan par jor diya jane laga hai, jisamen shramikon ke pratinidhi prabandhakon ke saath niyamit rup sa baithkar sanyukt nirnay le saken
 This strengthens the faith of the establishment among the workers and gives them the satisfaction of participating in the management
 samajavaadee deshon main to prabandh ke kai kshetron main shramikon kii sahabhaagita ko protsaahit karne par vishesh rup se jor diya jaataa he
 In some such countries, workers make joint decisions with managers on several important topics at different levels of the industry
 is tarah, prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita se audyogic prajatantr kii sthapana ko protsaahan miltaa he
 The cooperation between labor and management makes the two well aware of each other's problems and situations and they try to solve them in an environment of friendship
 is tarah, shram-prabandh sahyog se udyog main achh niojak-niojit sabandh kii sthapana hoti he
 With the experience of solving problems by joint decisions, both parties are also able to solve controversial issues
 koi bhi paksh sanyukt nirnyon se asantusht hone par unka virodh nahin karata, kyonki unamem vah bhi sakriy pakshakaar rahaa he
 In this way, the participation of workers in management greatly helps in maintaining industrial peace
 prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita kii yojanaon se shramikon ko atmabhivyakti or vichaaron ke aadan-pradaan kaa prachur avasar miltaa he
 Their ideas and suggestions help in accomplishing the objectives of the organization and management also continues to provide ample opportunities for the development of workers
 prabandh kii sahanubhutipurna pravriti evam sanghathan main vyaapt sahyog ke vaataavaran se shramikon ke kaaryatosh main bhi vruddhi hoti rahati he
 Also, the workers understand that through these schemes their human rights are being taken care of at the workplace and they continue to contribute towards achieving the objectives of the organization as active participants
 prabandh main shramikon kii bhagidaari se prabandh ko utpaadak tathaa sanghathan ke anya uddeshyon kii prapti main shramikon ke upyogi suzav milte rahete he
 Keeping these suggestions in mind, managers keep on improving their work processes and production processes
 sahabhaagita kii yojanaon ke lagu hone ke falswaroop doshapurn prabandhkeey kriyalap evam tareekon ko tyaage jane evam sahi margo ke apanaae jane k kai udhaaharan milte hai
 In this way, managerial skills are enhanced and the objectives of the organization are easily achieved
 prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita kaa str yaa uski maatra ek samaan nahin hoti
 Somewhere the participation is very limited, and elsewhere the workers actively participate in many managerial areas
 vibhinn deshon ke prabandh main shramikon kii bhagidaari kii yojanaon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par viddhanon ne sahabhaagita ke vibhinn staron kaa ullekh kiya he
 These scholars include Alexander, Mehtraja, Raghavan, Dutta, Taniq and Adam
 bhagidaari kii yojanaon ke kriyanvayan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita ke agralikhit staron yaa maatra kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he- At this level of participation, the employer agrees to provide information in relation to some specific areas related to the enterprise such as business conditions, future of the enterprise, change in production system, etc
 sahabhaagita kaa yah str nunatam hota he
 With informative participation, employees become aware of the position of the employer and keep their demands and suggestions in mind
 isse shramsangh ko apni nitiyon evam kaaryakramon main sanshodhan karne tathaa karmchaariyon kii pravritimein parivartan laane main sahaayta milti he
 The areas in which arrangements have been made to provide information to employees under the schemes of labor participation in management in India are the main ones - general economic condition of the enterprise, organization and general operation of the enterprise, market, sales and production status, Work and manufacturing methods, annual balance sheet and expansion and deployment plans
 sahabhaagita ke is str par niojak utpaadan yaa udhyam se sambhddha vishesh samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye karmchaariyon yaa shramsangh se paraamarsh karata he or is sambandh main unka sahyog praapt karata he
 This level of participation usually occurs temporarily to resolve specific problems when needed
 anubhav ke aadhaar par ise vyapak or sthaayee rup diya ja saktaa he
 There are many examples of such involvement in the textile industry of the United States
 sahabhaagita ke is str yaa maatra main niojak or karmchaaria yaa shramsangh ke bich kai purv-nirdhaarit ubhay vishyon par aupchaarik evam niyamit paraamarsh kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 Under this, the employer consults the employees or the unions before deciding on important topics related to the enterprise and after taking their views, the employees or the unions inform the employer of their views and also make their suggestions before taking the decision
 But do not force the employer to accept them
 paramarshi sahabhaagita main sanyukt-nirnayan nahin hota
 This level of participation gives definite recognition of the situation of the employees and the union
 is str kii sahabhaagita main udhyam se sambhddha kuch kshetron main prashasan kaa bhaar karmchaariyon or prabandhakon kii sanyukt samitiyon ko saunp diya jaataa he
 Employees in this level of participation have relatively more responsibility and authority and more autonomy in administration and inspection-related tasks
 yah prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita kaa ucchtam str he
 In this stage the decision process is actually combined
 isamen prabandh or shramsangh yaa shramikon ke pratinidhi donon ko sanyukt rup se nirnay lene ke avasar milte hai or nirnyon ke parinaamon kaa daayitv donon par sanyukt rup se rahata he
 In most schemes the areas of joint adjudication remain predetermined, but the prevalence of these areas or themes varies
 nideshak board main shramikon kaa pratinidhitiv bhi is str kii sahabhaagita kaa udhaaharan yaa vishyon main antar paaya jaataa he
 Representation of workers in the Board of Directors is also an example of this level of participation
 bharat main sanyukt-nirnayan ke kshetra simit hai, lekin germany, sweden, italy, yugoslavia, poland or japan main ye vyapak hai
 Some people also view collective bargaining as decisive participation
 lekin, prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita or samuhik saudebaaji main keval vishaywastu ke aadhaar par hi antar nahin hota, balki donon ke swaroop main bhi antar hota he
 Participation is mainly on subjects of common interest, while collective bargaining is mainly on conflicting interests
 prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita main sadbhaavna evam parsparik vishwaas ke aadhaar par ubhay hiton ke vishyon par sahyog karnaa tathaa utpaadan-vruddhi yaa kaarykushalta ke sudhaar karnaa aavashyak tatv hote hai, lekin samuhik saudebaaji dona pakshakaron ko utpeedak shakti se utpann ho sakane vaale parinaamon par aadhrut rahata he
 -57 ° C, 216
6 K, -70 ° f carbon diaksaide ek rangahin tathaa gandhhin gas he jo prithvi par jivan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 It is found naturally on the earth
 dharti ke vayumandal main yah gas aaytan ke hisaab se lagbhag 0
03 pratishat hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is composed of two atoms of oxygen and one atom of carbon
 saamaanya taapmaana tathaa dabaav par yah gasiy avasthaa main rahati he
 This gas is found to be 0
03% to 0
04% in the atmosphere, but its concentration in the air also changes slightly as the weather changes
 yah ek greenhouse gas he, kyonki surya se aane vaali kirnon ko to yah prithvi ke dharaatal par pahunchane detii he parantu prithvi kii garmi jab waapas antariksh main janaa chaahati he to yah use rokatii he
 All living organisms on Earth give up carbon dioxide in their respiration
 jabaki hare ped-paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya karte samay is gas ko grahan karke carbohydrate kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Thus, carbon dioxide is a major component of the carbon cycle
 carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa parampara gat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly, carbon dioxide can also be taken in various uses

 ganitiya vishleshan main, sisero sankalan saamaanya arthon main abhisaran nahin karne vaale anant sankalan ko maan nirdisht karata he jo maanak sankalan ke saath sannipatit hota he yadi vah abhisari ho
 The Sisera compilation is defined as the marginal value of the mean parallel to the partial compilation of the range
 sisera sankalan kaa namakaran italvi vishleshak arnesto sisera ke sammaan main rakhaa gaya
 Let {an} be a sequence and consider shrenee kaa kvaz aanshik sankalan he The range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} Sisera sum a ∈ r { \ displaystyle a \ in \ mathbb {R}} is called Sisaira computable
 Is if the mean of the sum of its partial collections is sk { \ displaystyle s_ {k}}, leading to a { \ displaystyle A}: anya shabdon main, kisi anant shrenee kaa sisera sankalan shrenee ke pratham n aanshik sankalnon kaa samaantar madhya kaa seemaant maan hota he jabaki n anant kii ore agrasar ho
 It can be proved that the convergent series Sisaira are computable and the sum of the series is the same as the Sisaira compilation
 haalanki, nimnlikhit udhaaharan ullikhit karata he ki shrenee apsaari he lekin sisera sankalneey he
 Let an = n + 1 for n ≥ 1
 arthath {an} ek anukram he And let g be a range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n} = 1-1 + 1-
 1 + 1- \ cdots} represents
 tab aanshik sankalnon {sn} = ∑ k = 1 n a k { \ displaystyle = \ sum _{k=1}^{n}a_{k}} kaa anukram nimnlikhit hoga This category g is known as Grandi category which is not convergent
 anya rup main, {sn} ke padon ke madhya anukram {tn} he jahaan Are as follows atah Therefore, the value of Sisaira collection of category g is 1 / 2
 anya rup main, mana n ≥ 1 ke liye an = n he
 That is, {an} is a sequence
 or mana g ek shrenee ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _{n=1}^{ \ infty }a_{n}=1+2+3+4+5+ \ cdots } ko nirupit karata he
 Then the sequence of partial compilations of {sn} hoga or g kaa maan anant kii ore apasarit hoga
 Hence, this sequence diverges to infinity like g and now g Sisaira is not computable

 After leaving school, Watson took a year off for filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which began in February 2009 but said she "definitely wants to go to university"
 Despite countless conflicting dialogue narratives, some highly-regarded sources claim that she would 'definitely' have studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, Columbia University, Brown University or Yale University, but Watson publicly made her commitment to one institution Reluctant to express, he said that he should first announce his decision on his official website Will In a July 2009 interview with Jonathan Ross and David Letterman, she confirmed that she was planning to study Liberal Arts in the United States
