 maan purnagiri Maa Purnagiri's court mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kaary kaa adhyayan hai
 It is a branch of philosophical ethics that examines the questions that arise when thinking how one should act morally
 isaki vyupatti mandandak se hui, jiskaa sambandh kisi adarsh maanak yaa model se hai, yaa us par aadhaarit hai, jo, koi chiz karne kaa saamaanya yaa uchit tarika mana jaataa ho
 Critical ethics differs from ethics in that it tests the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 zyaadaatar paramparaagat naitik siddhant un siddhanton par aadhaarit hai jo nirdhaarit karte hai ki koi kaary sahi yaa galat hai yaa nahin
 In this style, classical theories include forms of utilitarianism, Kantianism and some constitutionalism
 yah siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu mukhyatah naitik siddhanton kaa vyapak upyog pradaan karte hai
 There are disagreements about what exactly it is that gives its moral force to an action, rule or ayan
 Broadly speaking, there are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each
 gun nitishastra kaa focus kaary karne waalon ke charitra par hota hai, jabaki donon, karttavyavaigyanik nitishastra or parinamwad kaa focus kaary, niyam yaa ayaan kii sthiti par hota hai
 Both theories of the so-called ethics, in themselves, come in many forms

 He is often respected as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist; However some question the possibilities of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy
 herodots unhen "unaniyon ke bich sabase adhik sakasham darshanik" maanate hai
 His name connects him to Pythia and Apollo; Aristippus clarified his name by saying that "they spoke no less true than the Pythians," and Lumblikas tells a story that Pythia predicted that her pregnant mother would give birth to a very beautiful, intelligent child who would go to mankind

 Pythagoras, known as the "father of numbers", made significant contributions to religious teaching and philosophy in the sixth century BCE
 purv sukaraati kaal ke anya logon kii tulana main unke kaary ne katha kahaniyon ko adhik prabhavit kiya, unke jivan or shikshaaon ke bare main adhik vishwaas ke saath kaha ja saktaa he
 We know that Pythagoras and his disciples believed that everything is related to mathematics and that numbers are ultimately the reality and that everything can be predicted through mathematics and everything is aligned in a rhythmic pattern or cycle
 Can be measured in the form
 lamblicas ke anusaar, pithogoras ne kaha ki "sankhya hi vichaaron or roopon kaa shaasha he or devataaon or rakshason kaa kaaran he
 " wo pehle aadmi the jo apane aap ko ek darshanik, yaa buddhi kaa premi kehete the, or pithogoras ke vichaaron ne plato par ek bahut gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 Unfortunately, very few facts are known about Pythagoras, as very few of his writings remain
 pithogoras kii kai uplabdhiyaan vastav main unke sahyogiyon or uttaradhikariyon kii uplabdhiyaan hai
 Pythagoras was born in Samos, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean, on the shores of Asia Minor
 unki maan paaythis or pita manesarchas ke ek phonician vyapaaree) the
 When he was young, he left his place of birth and escaped from the tyrannical government of the Policrates and moved to Croton Celebria in southern Italy
 lamblicus ke anusaar thels unki kshamtaaon se bahut adhik prabhavit tha, usne pithogoras ko egypt main memphis ko chalane or vahaan ke pujaariyon ke saath adhyayan karne kii salaah di jo apni buddhi ke liye jane jate the
 He also served as a disciple in Tires and Bablos in Phenicia
 egypt main unhone kuch jyamitiya siddhanton ko sikhaa jisase prerit hokar unhone antat prameya di jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he
 This possible inspiration is presented as an extraordinary problem in the Berlin papyrus
 samos se crotone, celebria, italy, aane par unhone ek gupt dharmik samaaj kii sthapana kii jo praarambhik orfic kalt se bahut adhik milti julati thi or sambhawatah usase prabhavit bhi thi
 Pythagoras tried to improve the cultural life of Croton, inspired citizens to follow virtue and established a group of followers around him who were called Pythegoreans
 is saanskrithik kendra ke sanchaalan ke niyam bahut hi sakht the
 He opened his school as a liye for both boys and girls
 Those who took part in the social interiors of Pythagoras called themselves Methmetkoi

 He was known as Akausmetikoi and was allowed to eat meat and keep his personal property
 richard blekmor ne apni pustak di le monastery main pithogorieno ke dharmik prekshanon ko bataaya, "yah itihaas main darj sanyasi jivan kaa pehla udhaaharan tha
 According to Lumblikas, Pythagoras followed a life consisting of religious teaching, simple eating, exercise, reading, and philosophical study

 Flavius jozefus, against Appian, in defense of Judaism, said against Greek philosophy that Pythagoras was familiar with Jewish beliefs, according to Hermippus of Samarna, he included some of them in his philosophy

 This organization was in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood and in some ways a monastery
 yah pithogoras ke dharmik upadeshon par aadhaarit tha or bahut hi gupt tha
 First, the school was very much concerned with the morality of society
 sadasyon ko naitikta ke drushtikon ke saath jeena hota tha, ek duusare se pyaar karnaa hota tha, raajnneetik manyataon ko baantna hota tha, shanti kaa anusaran karnaa hota tha or swayan ko prakruti ke ganit ko samarpit kar dena hota tha
 The followers of Pythagoras were commonly called "pathogorians"
 unhen saamanytah darshanik ganitagya kaha jaataa he, jinka aksheeya jyamiti kii shuruyaat par ek prabhaav tha, jo iske vikaas ke 200 saalon ke baad euclid ke dwaara di eliments main likhaa gaya
 Pythagoras observed a law of peace known as Ekmeithia, breaking this rule to be punished with death
 aisa isliye tha kyonki pithogoras kaa maananaa tha ki ek vyakti ke shabd aam taur par laaparvaahee se yukt hote hai, jisase uski galat abhivyakti hoti he or unke anusaar yadi kisi ko is baat par andeh he ki use kya kahana chahie to use hameshaa chup rahanaa chahie
 Another rule of his was that "anyone who should help in a trouble should not let it fall down, because it is a great sin to encourage inaction
" " or ve kehete the ki "apane ghar se nikal jane ke baad vaapis mat jaao, kyoki furis aapke saath honge," yah unhen yaad dilaataa tha ki sab kuch siikhe bina bahut kam seekhney se acha he sristi, bhagwaan or ganit ke bare main, sachai ko siikhnaa 
 In the biographical porphyry of Pythagoras, it is stated that "this peace was not an ordinary peace
 "pithogoriens ek aantarik sarkal methmeticoi or ek bahari sarkal akusameticoi main vibhajit the
 The Porphyry wrote that Methmetkoikois learned the knowledge more extensively, and Akusmatikoi listened to only the summary headings of Pythagoras's writings without any precise exposition
 lamblikaas ke anusaar akusameticoi aamayaham shishy the jo pithogoras ke vyakhyanon ko ek parde ke baahar se sunate the
 The Akausmatikoi were not allowed to see Pythagoras and were not taught the inner secrets of the cult
 iske bajaay unhen gupt tareeke se vyavhaar or naitikta sikhaai jaati thi, gupt arthon se yukt sankshipt baaten bataai jaati thi
 Akusmatikoine Methmetikoiko believed to be genuine Pythagoreans but not the opposite

 aisa kaha jaataa he ki unhone bhi ganit, bhautik vigyaan, chikitsa or bal manovigyaan par kai pustaken likhin, haalaanki unke lekhan main se kuch nahin bachaa he
 His most important work is a book on the philosophical theory of the Golden Mean, at a time when women were considered to be the property of their husbands and only had to take care of their husbands' home, Pythagoras gave women equal status to work
 pithogoras ke samaaj main kai roak thim
 Like do not step on a crossbar and do not eat beans
 ye niyam puraane andhvishwaas the, jaise "ek seedhi ke neeche chalanaa durbhaagya purna hota he
 "even in ancient times, a derogatory title called Mysticos Logos was given to discredit Pythagoras
 faliyon par roak fevism se sambandhit ho sakati he jo bumadhya kshetra ke aas paas vyapak rup se failaa he
 The main point here is akousmata, meaning "rules", so that superstitious prohibitions were primarily applicable to the akousmeticoe and most of the rules came after the death of Pythagoras and were completely free from methmeticoe
 jo taarkik rup se pithogoras kii parampara ke vaastavik sangrakshak hai
 Methmetocycone emphasized more on the inside understanding than the acosmeticoin
 yahan tak ki kuch niyamon or puja paddatiyon ke vistaar par bhi bal diya
 For Methmetikoi to be Pythagorean means an innate quality and presence of inner understanding
 akusamata or -ke saath nipatane kaa ek or tarika bhi tha; unke pratik kathatmak chithran dwaara
 We have some examples of this, one is his explanation of Aristotle: "do not step on a balance", that is, do not be greedy; 'do not strike with a sword on fire ", that is, do not talk in sharp words to an angry person
 , "do not eat the heart" means do not hold yourself in sorrow etc
 hamaare paas paanchavin sadi isa purv tak ke pithogorian sajiv chithran ke saboot hai, iskaa matlab he ki aisi ajeeb baaten paheli ke rup main kahi gayi
 The Pythagoreans are also known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, as well as their theory that number is the true nature of things
 unhone shuddhikaran sanskaron ko apanaaya or jeene ke bhinn niyamon ko viksit kiya, ve aisa maanate the ki ye niyam devataaon ke bich unhen ek ucch pad ko praapt karne ke liye sakasham banaayenge
 Much of their mysticism appears to be keeping the soul integral to the orphic tradition
 orfiks ne kai parishodhak sanskaron ko apanaaya or saath hi anderworld main vibhinn vikaas sanskaron ko apanaaya
 Pythagoras is also closely related to Pherecidus of Ciroce, an ancient commentator who is believed to be the first Greek to teach the transmigration of souls
 pracheen tippaneekar maanate hai ki feresids pithogoras kaa sabase antarang shikshak tha
 Pheresidus taught about the soul in the words of Penta Maycos and-; The most likely origins of the Pythagorean use of the pentagram were their use as a symbol of identity among members and as a symbol of internal health
 pai thogoras sangeet main bahut adhik ruchi lete the, atah unke anuyaayi bhi sangeet main ruchi rakhte the
 Pythagoras was a musician and mathematician
 pithogoras apane samay ke sangeet main sudhaar laana chaahate the, unka maananaa tha ki is sangeet main paryaapt saamanjasy nahin he, yah bahut hi vyast rakhane vaala tha
 According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that the musical note could be translated into mathematical equations, when he one day passed by a working blacksmith and thought that his anvil resulted from an injury The sound being made was beautiful and harmonious and he determined that whatever scientific rule is the reason for it must be mathematical and can be applied to music
 vah lohaar ke paas gaya or uske aujaaron ko dekh kar yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki yah kaise hua
 He found that the snows were in simple proportion to each other

) pithogoras ne sankhya ke siddhant ko vistaarpurvak spasht kiya, jiskaa sahi arth aaj bhi vidwaanon ke bich bahes kaa vishay bana hua he
 Pythagoras believed in the "spontaneity of the balls", believing that planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, with some similarities found in musical tones and producing a melodious melody
 saanchaa:academia From the fourth century A
D
, Pythagoras is credited with discovering Pythagoras's theorem, a theorem in geometry that establishes that the square of the diagonal s in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides b and A
 arthath a2 + b2 = c2
 Although the theorem, now known by his name, was first used by the Babylonians and Indians
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki unhone yaa unke vidhyaarthiyon ne iske pehle pramaan die
 It must be stressed, however, that the manner in which the Babylonians handled the numbers of Pythagoras suggests that they knew that this theory generally proved to be true and that they also knew of some of the evidences which were hitherto unverified Not discovered in sources
 unke skool kii gupt prakruti kii vajah se or iske vidhyaarthiyon ke dwaara sab kuch apane shikshakon ko arpit kar dene kii vajah se, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki pithogoras ne is prameya ko sabit karne ke liye is par khud kaam kiya
 For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or post-mathematical problems
 kuch log maanate hai ki yah pithogoras kii mrityu ke do sadiyon ke baad plato ke anuyaayiyon ke dwaara saavdhaneepurvak nirmit ek myth he
 Primarily to justify the case of Plato's paraphysics, which worked well with the ideas he devoted to Pythagoras
 yah adhyaropan sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he or aadhunik samay se bhi juda hua he
 The earliest reference to Pythagoras's name being associated with this theorem is found in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch five centuries after his death
 aaj pithogoras ko uske anuyaayi greek plato ke saath ahal al tauhid yaa druj vishwaas ke dwaara ek bhakt ke rup main pratishthit kiya jaataa he, lekin pithogoras ke aalochak bhi the, jaise heraclitas jinhone kaha ki "zyada sikh pard lene se buddhi nahin aati he; anyathaa yah hesiod or pithogoras ko or phir se jenophens or hekateyas ko sikhaaya gaya
 Pythagoras had a religious and scientific outlook, in his view science and religion are related to each other
 dharmik rup se pithogoras metempcychosis ke anuyaayi the
 They believed in the relocation or the rebirth of the soul, believing that the soul would incarnate repeatedly in humans, animals, or vegetables until it became virtuous
 unka punarjanm kaa vichaar pracheen unani dharm se prabhavit tha
 He was the first to propose that thought process and soul are located in the brain and not in the heart
 unhen khud vistaar se chaar jivan yaad the jaisaa ki ve daawa karte the ki unhone jie hai or ve apane mrit mitra ke rone kii aawaaj ko ek kute ke bhunkane ke rup main sunate the
 One belief of Pythagoras was that the essence of life is number
 is prakaar se, sabhi chizon kii sthirataa brahmand ko banaati he
 Things like health depend on a constant proportion of the elements; Too little or too much of anything causes an imbalance that can make any organism unhealthy
 ve vichaaron kii tulana sankhya kii gananaaon se karte the
 When philosophy joins folk principles, it becomes a belief that knowledge of the essence of life can be discovered in the form of numbers

 None of the writings of Pythagoras are found, although some forged writings are associated with his name, and these are presently also found; These have been transmitted in antiquity
 jatil pracheen strot jaise arestu or aristogens in lekhanon par andeh prastut karte hai
 The ancient Pythagoreans usually explained their master's phrases with the idiom autos aphe and emphasized the fundamentally oral nature of their teaching
 pithogoras ovid ke metamorfocess kii aakhri kitaab ke charitra ke rup main, jahaan ovid ne uske darshanik drushtikon par vyakhya kii he
 Pythagoras is quoted as saying, "there is no man free who cannot control himself 
 " Pythagoras also has another side, in which he became a subject of elaborate legends surrounding his historical personality
 arestu ne pithogoras ko ek alokik vyakti ke rup main varnit kiya he jo aashcharya janak kaary karata he, unhen ek golden thai ke rup main aise pahalu ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo devatv kii nishaani he
 According to Aristotle and others, some ancient people believed that they had the ability to travel through space and time, and to talk with animals and plants
 bruers dictionari of fres and feble kii pravishti se ek uddhran he "golden thai" It was said that Pythagoras had a Golden Thai, which he represented to Iberis, a northwest priest, and performed at the Olympic Games
 ek anya katha jo bryker ke shabdkosh se lee gayi he
 She depicts his description of the moon
 pithogoras ne mana kii vah chandramaa par likh saktaa tha
 His plan was to write on a mirror in blood and put it in front of the moon and when the inscription would reflect on the moon's disk
 pithogoras kii ek mukhya uplabdhi thi ek khoj, ki sangeet 1 se 4 tak sankhyaon ke anupaatik interval par aadhaarit hota he
 He believed that the number system and therefore the cosmos system were based on the sum of these numbers: swearing of Pythagoras by the ten or tetrakatis of the decks rather than the ten deities
 visham sankhyaayein nar the or sam sankhyae maadaa thim
 He discovered the principles of mathematical ratios, constructed from 3 to 5 geometric solids
 uske kram ke ek sadsy hippasus ne an anupaatik sankhya kii bhi khoj kii, lekin yah vichaar pithogoras ke liye sochane yogya nahin tha or puranic katha ke anusaar hippasus ko maar daalaa gaya tha
 Pythagoras or also discovered square numbers
 unhone paaya ki udhaaharan ke liye yadi chaar pathar lekar unhen ek varg ke rup main vyavasthit kar diya jaye, to na keval prayek bhujaa duusari bhujaa ke baraabar hoti he, balki yadi do bhujaaon ko ek duusare se guna kiya jaye to, ve varg kii vyavastha main pattharon kii kul sankhya ke yoga ke baraabar hoti hai
 That is why it is called "square root"
 ve ye sochane vaale pehle vyaktiyon main se ek the, ki prithvi gol he or sabhi grahon kaa ek aksh he or sabhi grah ek kendriya bindu ke chaaron or ghoomte hai
 He stated that this central point is the Earth, but later stated that this central point is "agni" which he never identified as the Sun
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chaand ek anya grah he jise unhone "counter arth "kaha- baad main unhone simit-aseemit main vishwaas jataayaa
 Pythagoras or in a broader sense the Pythagoreans made a significant impact on Plato's work
 aar em hare ke anusaar unke prabhaav main teen bindu shaamil the: a) platonic ganraajya "ek samaan soch vaale logon ke ek sangathit samudaay " ke vichaaron se sambandhit ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki pithogoras ne crotone main sthapit kiya
 B) There is evidence that Plato may have taken the idea from Pythagoras that mathematics and common language, abstract thinking is a safe basis for philosophical thinking, as well as an adequate thesis in science and ethics
 sa) plato or pithogoras ne "aatma or bhautik duniya main iske sthaan ke liye rahasywaadee drushtikon" main saamaan vichaar prastut kiya
 It seems that both were influenced by orphism
 plato ke vichaar spasht rup se arkitas ke kaam se prabhavit hue, jo teesri peedhee kaa ek vaastavik pithogorian tha, usne jyamiti main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, jo euclid ke tatvonki aathvin pustak main pratibimbit hota he
 In the legends of ancient Rome and Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome studied under Pythagoras, it is said
 isaki sambhaavna nahin he kyonki do jeevon ke liye saamaan rup se sweekrut tareekhen adhyaropit nahin karti hai
 Pythagoras established a secret society called the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which was devoted to the study of mathematics
 iskaa bhavi gupt paramparaon par gaharaa prabhaav padaa, jaise rosicrusienism or freemasenary, ye donon aise samooh ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit the, donon kaa daawa tha ki ve pithogorian brotherhud se viksit hue hai
 The mysterious and secretive properties of Pythagoras' mathematics are discussed in Menley P's recent chapter The Secret Teachings of All Ages entitled "pythagorean Mathematics"

 pithogoras ke bare main koi praathmik strot nahin bache hai
 This article gives a classical interpretation of Pythagoras based on the writings of later authors
 chunki bahut si jaankaree jo uplabdh he vah pithogoras ke jivan ke sadiyon ke baad likhi gayi, unki sateekta anishchit he
 It is believed that the mathematical significance of the early Pythagoreans is exaggerated and the Pythagoreans were orphic
 unka sankhya vigyaan par prabhaav tha, baad main unamem se hi gambhir ganitagyon kaa janm hua jab jyamiti puure greece main lokapriy ho gayi

 Jesus or Jesus Christ, also called Jesus of Nazareth, is the originator of Christianity
 isai log unhen parampita parameshwar kaa putr or isai triek parameshwar kaa tritiy sadsy maanate hai
 The biography and teachings of Jesus are given in the New Testament of the Bible
 yishu messiah ko islam main isa kaha jaataa he, or unhen islam ke bhi mahanatam pegambaron main se ek mana jaataa he
 According to the Bible, Mary, the mother of Jesus, was from the village of Nazareth in Galilee province
 unki sagaai daaud ke rajwanshi yusuf naamak badhai se hui thi
 Even before marriage, she became pregnant with divine influence while being a virgin
 ishwar kii ore se sanket paakar yusuf ne unhen patniswaroop grahan kiya
 Thus, the people were not aware of the supernatural origin of Jesus
 vivaah sampann hone ke baad yusuf galilia chhodkar yahudiya praant ke bethalehem naamak nagari main jaakar rahane lage, vahaan isa kaa janm hua
 Joseph fled to Egypt to save the infant from the tyranny of King Herod
 herod 4 i
pus
 main chal based at: isa kaa janm sambhavat: 4 i
pus
 main hua tha
 After Herod's death, Joseph returned and settled in the village of Nazareth
 isa jab baarah varsh ke hue, to jerusalem main teen din rukkar mandir main upadeshkon ke bich main baithe, un kii sunate or un se prashn karte hue paaya
 Luke 2:47 And all who heard them were amazed at their understanding and their answers
 tab isa apane mata pita ke saath apana gaanv vaapis laut gaye
 Jesus learned Joseph's profession and continued to work as a carpenter until he was about 30 years old
 bible main unke 13 se 29 varshon ke bich kaa koi zikr nahin miltaa
 At the age of 30, he took a dip in water from John
 dubkee ke baad isa par pavitra aatma aayaa
 After 40 days of fasting, Jesus started teaching people
 tees saal kii umr main isa ne israel kii janata ko yahudee dharm kaa ek nayaa rup prachaarit karnaa shuru kar diya
 At that time, those below thirty years old were not given to read scripture in the hall and to teach
 unhone kaha ki ishwar saakshaat premrup he or us vaqt ke varttman yahudee dharm kii pashubali or karmkand nahin chahta
 Judaism is not the beloved race of God, God loves all countries
 insaan ko krodh main badla nahin lenaa chahie or kshamaa karnaa siikhnaa chahie
 He clearly stated that he is the son of God, he is the Christ and the way to heaven and salvation
 yahudee dharm main qayamat ke din kaa koi khaas zikr yaa mahatva nahin tha, par isa ne qayamat ke din par khaas jor diya - kyonki usee vaqt swarg yaa nark insaani aatma ko milegaa
 Jesus also performed many miracles
 yahudiyon ke kattarpanthi rabbiyon ne isa kaa baari virodh kiya
 He did not find anything special in Jesus like the Messiah
 unhen apane karmkandon se prem tha
 It was a huge sin for him to call himself the son of God
 isaliye unhone us vaqt ke roman governor pilaatus ko isaki shikaayat kar di
 The Romans always feared the Jewish Revolution
 isaliye kattarpanthiyon ko prasann karne ke liye pilaatus ne isa ko cross par maut kii dardanaak sazaa sunai
 According to the Bible, Roman soldiers killed Jesus with a whip
 unhen shahi kapade pahanaae, unke sar par kaanton kaa taj sajaayaa or unpar thuka or aise unhen tauheen main "yahudiyon kaa badshaah" banaaya
 Having carried his own cross on the back, the Romans took him to Galgata, where he was to be hanged on the cross
 galgata pahunchane par, unhen madiraa or pitt kaa mishran pesh kiya gaya tha
 In that era, this mixture was given to reduce the extreme pain of capital punishment
 isa ne ise inkaar kiya
 According to the Bible, Jesus was hung on a cross between two thieves
 isaayiyon kaa maananaa he ki cross par marate samay isa messiah ne sabhi insaanon ke paap swayan par le liye the or isliye jo bhi isa main vishwaas karegaa, use hi swarg milegaa
 Three days after his death, Jesus resurrected and went to heaven 40 days later
 isa ke 12 shishyon ne unke naye dharm ko sabhi jagah failaayaa
 This religion was called Christianity
 herodes raja ke dinon main jab yahudiya ke baitalaham main yishu kaa janm hua, to dekho, purv se kai jyotishi jerushlem main aakar poochne lage
 Where is the king of the Jews who is born? Because we have seen his star in the past and have come to bow down to him
 yah sunakar herodes raja or uske saath sara jerushlem ghabara gaya
 And he gathered all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them, where should Christ be born? They said to him, in Bethlehem, Judea; Because that's how it is written by the prophet
 ki he baitalaham, jo yahuda ke desh main he, tu kisi reeti se yahuda ke adhikariyon main sab se chota nahin; kyonki tujh main se ek adhipati nikalegaa, jo meri praja israel kii rakhwali karegaa
 Then Herod secretly called the astrologers and asked them, at what time did the star appear
 or us ne yah kahkar unhen baitalaham bheja, ki jaakar us balak ke vishay main thik thik maaloom karo or jab vah mil jaae to mujhe samachar do taaki main bhi aakar us ko pranaam karun
 Hearing the king, they went away and, look, the star which they had seen in the past, went ahead of them and reached the place where the child was
 They were very happy to see that star
 or us ghar main pahunchakar us balak ko us kii mata mariyam ke saath dekha or munh ke bal girakar use pranaam kiya; or apana apana yaila kholkar use sona or lohban or gandharas kii bhent chadhaai
 And having received a warning in his dream that he should not go back to Herod, he went to his country by another route
 After they left, see, a messenger of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Get up; Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Egypt; And stay there until i tell you; Because Herod is looking for this child to have him killed
 vah raat hi ko uthakar balak or us kii mata ko lekar misr ko chal diya
 And remained there until Herod died; Because that word that the Lord had said through the prophet that i had called my son from Egypt to be fulfilled
 jab herodes ne yah dekha, ki jyotishiyon ne mere saath thattha kiya he, tab vah krodh se bhar gaya; or logon ko bhejkar jyotishiyon se thik thik puche hue samay ke anusaar baitalaham or uske aas paas ke sab ladakon ko jo do varsh ke, vaa us se chote the, marava daalaa
 Then the word that was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, that a shrill sound was heard in Ramah, weeping and great lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children and did not want to be calm, because they are not
 Look after Herod's death, the angel of the Lord said to Joseph in Egypt in a dream
 ki uth, balak or us kii mata ko lekar israel ke desh main chalaa ja; kyonking jo balak ke praan lenaa chaahate the, ve mar gaye
 He got up and took the boy and his mother along and came to the land of Israel
 parantu yah sunakar ki arikhalouse apane pita herodes kii jagah yahudiya par rajya kar rahaa he, vahaan jane se daraa; or swapn main chituni paakar galeel desh main chalaa gaya
 And settled in the city of Nazareth; So that the word that was said by the prophets would be called Nazarene
 or balak badhata or balwant hota or buddhi se paripurna hota gaya; or parameshwar kaa anugrah us par tha
 His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year at the Passover
 jab vah baarah varsh kaa hua, to ve parv kii reeti ke anusaar jerushlem ko gaye
 And when they completed those days and returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem; And this was not known by his parents
 ve yah samajhakar, ki vah or yatriyon ke saath hoga, ek din kaa padaav nikal gaye: or use apane kutumbiyon or jaan-pahachaanon main dhundhane lage
 But when they were not found, they returned again to Jerusalem in search of seekers
 or teen din ke baad unhone use mandir main upadeshkon ke bich main baithe, un kii sunate or un se prashn karte hue paaya
 And all those who were listening to him were amazed at his understanding and answers
 tab ve use dekhakar chakit hue or us kii mata ne us se kaha; he putr, tu ne ham se kyon aisa vyavhaar kiya? dekh, tera pita or main kudhate hue tuje dhundhate the
 he told them; Why did you find me Didn't you know that i must be in my father's house? But what he said to them, they did not understand
 tab vah un ke saath gaya or nasarat main aayaa or un ke vash main rahaa; or us kii mata ne ye sab baaten apane man main rakhin
 or yishu buddhi or deal-doll main or parameshwar or manushyon ke anugrah main badhata gaya
 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a virgin in the city of Nazareth in Galilee
 jis kii mangani yusuf naam daaud ke gharaane ke ek purush se hui thi: us kunvaari kaa naam mariyam tha
 And the angel came to him and said, Glory and joy be yours, God is with you, the Lord is with you
 vah us vachan se bahut ghabara gai or sochane lagi, ki yah kis prakaar kaa abhivadan he? swargadoot ne us se kaha, he mariyam; bhaybheet na ho, kyonki parameshwar kaa anugrah tujh par hua he
 And see, you will be pregnant and you will have a son; You name him Jesus
 vah mahaan hoga; or parampradhan kaa putr kehalaayegaa; or prabhu parameshwar uske pita daaud kaa singhaasana us ko degaa
 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; And his kingdom will not end
 mariyam ne swargadoot se kaha, yah kyonkar hoga? main to purush ko jaanati hi nahin
 The angel answered him; That the Holy Spirit will descend upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so the Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God
 yishu ne or bhi bahut chinh chelon ke samhane dikhaae, jo is pustak main likhe nahin gaye
 But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and believe that you may have life in his name
 
 This was a very good man with a hand on his head and he was blessed by Jesus who performed countless miracles in his life that were impossible for anyone else on earth
 islam bible main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha
 The name of Jesus in the Quran is more than that of Muhammad, and Mussulman believes in the birth of Jesus by virgin
 islam main isa messiah mahaz ek nashwar insaan mana jaataa he, sab nabiyon kii tarah or ishwar-putr yaa trimurti kaa sadsy nahin, or unki puja par manaahi he
 He got the ability to perform miracles from God and such powers were not present in Jesus Christ himself
 yah bhi nahin mana jaataa he ki ve cross par latake
 According to Islamic tradition, he was raised directly to heaven by God, despite dying on the cross
 sab nabiyon kii tarah, isa messiah bhi quran main ek muslim kehalaata he
 According to the Quran, Jesus never considered himself a God-son and would deny this on the Day of Judgment
 musulmaanon kii manyata he ki qayamat ke din par, isa messiah prithvi par lautegaa or nyaay qaiyam karegaa
 His name appears 25 times in the Quran
 suraah mariyam main inke janm kii katha he or isi tarah suraah ali imran main bhi
 In the hadiths of Muhammad, "all prophets are brothers and Christ is my closest brother because no prophet has come between me and Jesus"
 isa messiah unase kaha, yon likhaa he; ki messiah du:kha uthayega or tisare din mare huon main se ji uthegaa
 And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name in all nations from Jerusalem
 tum in sab baaten ke gavaah ho
 And, behold, my father has promised me, i will take him down on you and stay in this city until you are empowered by heaven
 Then he took them out to Bethany and raised his hands and blessed them
 Granted
 or unhen ashish dete hue vah un se alag ho gaya or swarg se uthaa liya gaya
 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy
 or lagaataar mandir main upasthit hokar parameshwar kii stuti kiya karte the
 Jews do not consider Jesus Christ as the Messiah or God the Son
 ve apane maseehaa kaa aaj bhi intazaar karte hai

 Their ancestors were originally Telugu-speaking high-profile Panchadravida Vellanadu Brahmins from Telangana, who came to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and other provinces of North India at the insistence and invitation of the North Indian kings and emperors to occupy the posts of vice-chancellor, Rajguru, Dharampeeth, etc

 " Among the great men whose contribution to the creation of India's glorious and varied cultural-history has been memorable - among them the strong culture of seventeenth-century Telang Brahmin, philosopher-poet tantra-chudamani Shivanand Goswami as a strong link to the long scholarly tradition of Andhra Pradesh
 And literary contribution is very important
 According to the description of the North Indian andhra-tailang-bhatt-family tree, "in the Atreya gotra of the Tailang Brahmins, there was the original ancestor Srivayenkatesha Ananamma in the Taittriya Aastambha of the Yaturveda" - in whose sixth generation was born in the family of Jagannivasji such a remarkable scholar as Shivanand Goswami

 Historical Sanskrit texts - 'muhurtratna' and 'sanheda Aryasaptashti' have some kind of 'kavitamya' introduction of the Dravidian clan of Shivanand - "panampatta on the banks of the holy river Penna, destroying all sins in the 'dravidian' region in the south of India
 In the family of Atreya gotra residing in the city, he was a scholar of knowledge of Agam Nigam Mystery and veda-vedang / Gon, who was a scholar
 Many scholars of the time had 'defeated' them and received their discipleship
 Jagannivasji, who was born in this family of Yashopataka of the same Atreya clan, spread across rivers and seas, was invited by the King of Bundelkhand and received 'initiation' from them
 The king became his disciple
 The same great scholar Jagannivasji had three sons - Srisiromani Bhatt, Sreejanardan and Srichakrapani
 " 'saheeda Aryasaptashati' shivanandji ke pitamah shri shrinivas bhatta dakshin se aaye the
 In his youth, he took the initiation of Tantrashastra and 'srividya' from Deshikendra Sachchidananda Sundaracharya, a Manish of the Dravidian region, who was the ruler of jalandhar-peetha - the Guru then gave him the title of 'goswami' in Samvat 1630
 diksha ke uparaant inkaa nayaa naam goswami vidyanandnath padaa| lalita kii archa main, shrividya main nirat ho jane se inhen kaa teesraa naam lalitanandanath goswami bhi he
 Therefore, among these Atreyya Brahmins from Telangana, 'goswami' is not a caste word, a title given to scholarship

 The number of original shlokas composed in this is shocking

 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings

 Classical texts such as the Srimad Bhagavat Maha Purana and the 'mahabharata' are the result of the combined long-form writing tradition of many sages-scholars, as Ved Vyasa is not the name of a single individual, an 'academic post' assumed by various scholars from time to time
 ) But a single writer has prepared such a huge manuscript, it is rare to find such a unique example in the literary history of Sanskrit

 Handwritten copies of some of his compositions are also in the Pothikhana of Jaipur as mentioned in this list
 yadhyapi prakaash parimal jaise anusandhankartaaon ne shivanand ji kaa janm vikram samvath 1710 ankit kiya he, tathaapi unki laghu-pustak main is tathy ke sakshya kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 The truth is that in which year and where he was born, it is a matter of research
 is kaa kaaran keval yah he ki puraane jamaane main mahaan se mahaan lekhak tak apane nijee-jivan ke bare main koi soochna yaa jaankaree apni kritiyon main aksar nahin dete the
 In that era, to remain completely secret or unaware and to engage in high level silent saraswat-sadhana would have been the internal psychopathy of many scholars like Shivanand ji
 aisa anumaan bahuprachlit he ki anek nareshon ke sammanit kulguru hone ke baavjood, apana antim samay goswamiji ne bikaner ke maharaja anupasingh ke aagrah par unke saath hi vyateet kiya
 But where Shivanand Goswami died - somewhere in South India, or in Bikaner - is a matter of research
 shivanand goswami chanderi ke governor devisingh bundela ke samakaleen the, jinhone goswamiji se 'mantra-diksha' lekar bhent main kuch gaanvon kii jaagir bakshi thi
 Similarly, the seventh generation king of Orchha, Devi Singh, was impressed by his scholarship and gave a jagir of 4 villages

 Today Mahapura village has become a part of the Jaipur metropolis, which is situated on Ajmer road, 10 km from Jaipur

 It was here that in 1922, the famous Sanskrit litterateur Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was married to Ramadevi Bhatt, the daughter of Acharya Gopikrishna Goswami of Srimad Bhagwat, a descendant of Shivanandji
 bikaner ke maharaja anup singh dwaara goswamiji ko do gaanvon - pulasar or chilkoi kii jaagir bhent kii gai thi
 He stayed in Bikaner in the evening of his life
 sambhawatah inkaa dehavsaan bhi vahiin hua ho- kintu inke antim dinon ke bare main koi aitihaasik saamagree uplabdh nahin hoti| After Shivanand ji, his sons also continued to achieve many achievements in royalty, keeping their clan tradition intact, as evidenced by the following English document- 'maharaj shri Shivanandji, sole ascendant, gave purnabhishek-mantra to Maharaja Shri Anoop Singh ji Bahadur of Bikaner at Dilsuri 
 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur,the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, village SURJANSAR devisingh ke darbari vidvan unke viruddh anek prakaar ke pravaad unki anupasthiti main bana kar raja ke kaan bharte rahete the| yah baat to sarvavidit thi ki orchha yaa bundelon ke isht devtaa, bhagwaan ram the or isi kaaran is kshetra main anek ram or hanuman mandiron kii sthapana bhi hui he, vaise orchha main hi bundelon ke isht hanumanji kaa ek mandir aaj bhi he| yah mandir shivanandji ke ashram or devisingh ke mehalon ke bich padataa tha
 The scholars of Shivanand complained to the king that the temple of the presiding deity of Bundelkhand, while on the way, never bowed down to his guru, the presiding deity
 When King Devisingh himself presented the same thing in front of them, he avoided it in humor, saying that "this matter is of personal reverence and since i am absorbed in the feeling of Ahornish Devi, therefore going into the 'other' sense in it Mine and yours will be evil! All gods are the form of God anyway
 

 " inke uttar se raja kadaachit puri tarah santusht nahin ho sakaa
 So once both of them were coming through the path of the same Hanuman temple, the king begged them to bow down to their favorite Hanuman
 kehete hai- jaise hi shakti ke param aradhak shivanandji ne apane haath pranaam hetu uthaae, usase purv hi hanumanji kii murti main pathar fatne kii awaz ke saath upar se neeche tak ek gahari daraar pads gayi! raja is chamatkaar se bahut bhaybheet ho gaya
 And since then, a deep loyalty to Adyashakti has also awakened in his mind
 orchha main hanuman mandir main aaj bhi vah gahari daraar dekhi ja sakati he
 


 After this incident, Shivanand Goswami's mind became somewhat unsympathetic to the learned politicians and devout politicians in the court on the strength of miracles

 " aurangzeb shashan ke dauraan amer ke rajya par aaye rajnatik-sankaton ke nivaaran ke liye jaipur ke tatkaaleen panditon ne maharaja vishnusingh ko nagar main shanti banaaye rakhane ke liye 'vaajapeya-yajna' karwaane kaa mashvira diya tha
 Then some pandits of Kashi and Mithila were very famous for their cultivation and siddhis
 amer ke naresh ne unhen hi is kaam ke liye jaipur aamantrit kiya
 But whenever there was a veela of Purnahuti in that royal Vajpayee-yajna due to misuse, the sacrificial priest would die accidentally
 This happened many times, not once
 ek ke baad ek kaashi-mithila ke paanch siddh purohit yajna puraa karaane se purv hi kaal-kavlit ho gaye
 Seeing such a terrible vengeance, the king sent a message through Bikaner King Anupsinh to Orchha Maharaj that he should kindly send his vice-chancellor and the great Tantric Shivanandji to Jaipur so that he can get the vajpayee-yajna done
 Shivanand Goswami finally reached Amer in 1680 AD and near the Jalmahal, he completed the vajpayee-yajna of Jaipur King uninterrupted
 The night before Purnahuti, it is said that a formidable Brahmarakshas appeared before Goswamiji in a dream - who challenged him to debate with the information that the earlier five kashi-pandits had become his grasps by defeating him in debate
 goswamiji ne brahmarakshas kii is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or use shastrarth main haraa kar vaajapeya-yajna purnahuti ke saath vidhivat sampann karaayaa| But to disguise the fact that the first five kashi-pandits had defeated the Brahmarakshas in scripture and become his morsels, the king returned to Mahapura from Amber without any alms from Amber Maharaja
 It is said that when Maharaja Vishnusinh sensed Shivanandji's displeasure, he persuaded himself to reach Mahapura with his son Sawai Jai Singh
 Shivanandji, while making some very accurate predictions about Sawai Jai Singh, instructed the Maharaja that he go to some well-known ritualist Pandit and send Kashi for the 'pratamukti' of Brahmarakshas
 He somewhat unhappily held the Maharaja responsible for the killing of the five Pandits, He would have been advised to get Ashwamedha Yagya done as a result of citing many ancient scriptures
 Being distressed by the death of innocent Brahmins, he also showed humility in front of Maharaja in Mahapura and reluctance to stay
 Goswamiji eventually left the estate of five villages with his younger brother to Maharaja Anoop Singh as the Rajguru of Bikaner "after some time" - whose invitation / request to be Bikaner vice-chancellor-rajguru has been pending with him ever since

 parantu duniya kii sabase kathin bhashaa to chini he, phir unhone chini bhashaa kaa prayog band kyon nahin kar diya
 It is very strange to convert Sanskrit from our society to Hindi and other languages

 And there can be only one reason for doing this, because all our Vedas and ancient texts which are full of knowledge and mystery are all in Sanskrit

 Many scholars believe that the word "sanskrit" for the language has been used adjectively by Hanuman in the Sundarkand of the first Valmiki Ramayana
 bhartiya parampara kii kinvadanti ke anusaar sanskrit bhashaa pehle avyaakrit thi, arthath uski prakruti evam pratyayadi kaa vishlisht vivechan nahin hua tha
 On praying by the Devas, Devraj Indra introduced the metaphysical legislation of analysis, analysis of nature, suffixes etc
 isi "sanskaar" vidhaan ke kaaran bharat kii pracheenatam aryabhasha kaa naam "sanskrit" padaa
 The "developed cosmic Sanskrit" or "paninian Sanskrit" is the only ever-evolving form of the literary "vedic language" of the texts of the Raksanhitha period, "sadhubhasha" and "brahmana", "aranyak" and "dasopanishad"
 isi bhashaa ko "sanskrit","sanskrit bhashaa" yaa "saahitiyik sanskrit" naamon se janaa jaataa he
 From the point of view of development, "sanskrit" means - made of Sansa
 aadhyatm evam samprak-vikaas kii drushti se "sanskrit" kaa arth he - swayan se krit yaa jo aarmabhik logon ko swayan dhyaan lagane evam parasapar samprak se aa gai
 Some people also consider Sanskrit as a sacrament
 desh-kaal kii drushti se sanskrit ke sabhi swarupon kaa muladhar purvatar kaal main udichy, madhyadeshiy evam aryavartiya vibhaashaayen hai
 These divisions are mentioned by the words "vibhasha" or "udicham" in the Paninisutras
 inke atirikt kuch kshetron main "praachya" aadi boliyaan bhi boli jaati thim
 But Panini gave the language a sophisticated and universally usable form by regular grammar
 dhire-dhire paninisammat bhashaa kaa prayogrup or vikaas praaia: sthaayee ho gaya
 By the time of Patanjali, Sanskrit became a colloquial language among the noble people of Aryavarta

 From the point of view of the development of Sanskrit language, many scholars have chronicled its history in many ways
 saamaanya suvidha kii drushti se adhik maanya nimnaankit kalvibhaajan diya ja rahaa he - Time madhyakaal Later is yug main kavy, naatak, sahityashastra, tantrashastra, shilpashaastra aadi ke granthon kii rachana ke saath-saath mul granthon kii vyaakhyaatmak, kritiyon kii mahatvapurn sarjana hui
 In the thousands of texts which were produced in the form of commentaries, commentaries, descriptions, lectures, etc
, the reputation, recognition and fame of many commentaries and commentaries went far beyond the texts
 pramanikta ke vichaar se is bhashaa kaa sarvapracheen uplabdh vyakaran panini kii ashtaadhi he
 At least 600 BC Even today, this book is an incomparable grammar in the whole world
 vishwa ke or mukhyat: america ke bhashashasthri sanghatnatmak bhashavigyaan kii drushti se ashtaadhi ko aaj bhi vishwa kaa sarvottam granth maanate hai
 "broomfield" has established this fact in his "language" and other works
 panini ke purv sanskrit bhashaa nishchay hi shisht evam vaidic janon kii vyavahaarabhasha thi
 Many of the dialects would have been prevalent at that time also among the untrained people
 par yah mat aadhunik bhashavigyon ko maanya nahin he
 He says that Sanskrit was never a lingua franca
 janata kii bhashaaon ko tatkaaleen praakrit kaha ja saktaa he
 Devbhasha was essentially the language of Brahmin Pandits created by artificers or sacraments, not the lingua franca
 parantu yah mat sarvamaanya nahin he
 Everyone from Panini to Patanjali have called Sanskrit the language of the folk, a cosmic language
 anya saikadon pramaan siddh karte hai ki "sanskrit" vaidic or vaidicottar purvapaninikaal main lokbhasha or vyavahaarabhasha thi
 It must have been that in terms of country, age and society, it must have had its own limits
 baad main chalakar vah pathit samaaj kii saahitiyik or saanskrithik bhashaa ban gai
 Subsequently, it became a widely accepted cultural language of all the pandits all over India, whether they were Aryans or non-aryans, and Asetuhimachal has been spreading, respecting and propagating and continues to this day
 lagbhag satrahavin shatabdi ke purvardh se yorape or pashchimi deshon ke mishanri evam anya vidyapremiyon ko sanskrit kaa parichay praapt hua
 Gradually Sanskrit was propagated not only in the West but in the whole world
 german, angrej, francisi, amareeki tathaa yorape ke anek chote bade desh ke nivasee vidwaanon ne vishesh rup se sanskrit ke adhyayan anushilan ko aadhunik vidwaanon main prajapriy banaaya
 Sanskrit is the most systematic, scientific and thriving language among the world's languages in the opinion of modern scholars and followers
 vah aaj keval bhartiya bhashaa hi nahin, ek rup se vishwabhasha bhi he
 It can be said that Sanskrit is perhaps the largest, broadest, most versatile and accomplished in the Bhumandal effort-language literature
 sansar ke praaia: sabhi viksit or sansar ke praaia: sabhi vikasman deshon main sanskrit bhashaa or sahitya kaa aaj adhyayan-adhyaapan ho rahaa he
 It has been said that it was only after the introduction of this language that Western scholars gained a solid foundation in the study of subjects related to the Arya caste, its culture, life and the so-called original Aryan language
 pracheen greek, latin, avastaa or riksanskrit aadi ke aadhaar par mul aadya aryabhasha kii dhwani, vyakaran or swaroop kii pariklpana kii ja saki jisen riksanskrit kaa avdaan sabase adhik mahatv kaa he
 Sanskrit has a close and familial relationship with Greek, Latin, etc
 par bharat-irani-varg kii bhashaaon ke saath sanskrit kii sarvaadhik nikatataa he
 Originally the Rigveda and the Sanskrit of Sanskrit in the development of all the ancient, medieval and modern Aryan languages of India have been the basic and industrial contribution
 aadhunik bhashavaigyanik maanate hai ki rugvedakaal se hi jansamanya main bolchaal kii tathabhoot praakrit bhashaayen avashya prachlit rahi hongi
 From them, Pali, Prakrit, Apabhramsa and post-aryan languages were developed
 parantu is vikaas main sanskrit bhashaa kaa sarvaadhik or sarvavidh yogadan rahaa he
 It is also to be remembered here that Sanskrit language greatly influenced and influenced the non-aryan languages of different regions and regions of India; Not only did they influence the culture and literature of those languages and their speakers, their languages dictionary also benefited from their contribution to their soundtrack and clerical

 ye shuddh aryavanshi shatkarma vedapathi adikalik samooh he jo kii adikaal se hi brahman dharm kaa adhishthata rahaa he
 Eight Pandits have written books about the origin of Saryuparin Brahmin and its pedigree, but all of them make contradictory arguments

 In which Rishis like Vashistha, Vamdev and Jabali participated
 parantu sarauparin bramhanon main vamdev or jabali ke bramhan nahin milte
 Therefore, it would be considered illusory that the ancestors of the Sarauparin Brahmins were involved in this yagya

 According to an article by the British historian Sir S
 Eliot, one of the five branches of Kanyakubj, who lived in Kannauj, spread around Saryu
 iske alaava anya angrej lekhakon sar jon voms, dablue crook ke anusaar kanya or kubja do bhai the jinaki santane hi aage jaakar kanyakubj kahalaai
 And at the time of King Aja, a branch of these settled and settled on the banks of the Saryu river and started to be called Sarvariya Brahmana
 is kahani main bhi kai matbhed dekhe ja sakate hai
 Like in the Bhuvan configuration of Vayu Purana there are stories from the birth of Brahma to the birth of Brahman
 parantu raja aj ke samay main bramhano ke vahaan aakar basane yaa unka shakhao main virakt hone kaa koi sandarbh nahin hai
 The Puranas show that the gods lived around the Himalayas and used to have ashrams of the greatest sages near them
 chuki puraanon main himalay parvat shrankhla ko bahut hi pavitra mana gaya hai atah rishiyon kaa vahaan rahanaa sambhav lagata hai
 If you look at the mythological references, when returning to his capital after accepting the hospitality of Devraj Indra, King Dushyant looked towards Hemkut mountain, the supreme region of the sages, which is described in the Padma Purana: dakshine bhaaratan varsh uttare lavanodadheh
 Kuladeva Mahabhag Tasya Seema Himalaya
 
 Thus kimpursham hemkutadadh: position
 hari varsh tato gyeyan nivadhobdhiruchyate
 
 isi prakaar barah puraana ke ek prasang main maharishi pulasthya, dharmraj yudhisthir se yatra ke sandarbh main bataate hai kii: Tato Gachchet Rajendra Devikam Lok Vishrutam

 Prosperity 
 That is, o Rajendra Lok Vishruta Devika river should go where the origin of Brahmins is heard
 devika nadi ke tat par veernagar naamak sundar puri he jo samrudh or sundar hai
 With reference to another Purana, it is certain that on the banks of the river Devika, there used to live sage-muni in the Kampurush area called Hemkut
 "devikayaan sarayvachan bhavedaviksargau" That is, Devika and Saryu are residents of the region called Aavik and Sarava
 anumaan hai, kii sarav or awaar ke sanyog se sarawwar bana hoga, or phir samay ke saath uccharan main sarvar ban gaya hoga
 Residents of the same Sarwar region must have been called Sarwaria
 is sambandh main matsay puraana main nimna sandarbh miltaa hai: Ayodhya Dakshin Yasya: Sarayutta: Again
 saravavar deshoyan tathaa gaudh prakirtitah
 
 arthath- ayodhya ke dakshin main sarayu nadi ke tat par sarvavar desh hai usee prakaar gonda desh bhi maananaa chahie
 The Saryu river rises from Mount Kailash and joins the Narayani river near Chhapra town in the Vihara region
 devika nadi gorakhpur se 60 mile dur himalay se nikal kar bramhaputra ke saath gandki main milti hai
 The Gandaki River, originating from the foothills of Nepal, flows through the Saravar region and joins the Saryu River
 sarayu, ghaghara, devika ye tino nadiyaan ek hi main mil kar kahi-kahi pravaahit hoti hai
 It is mentioned in the Mahabharata that the Saryu, Ghaghra and Devika rivers originate from the Himalayas, the confluence of the three rivers was in the mountain itself
 isiilie sarayu ko kahi ghaghara to kahi devika kaha jaataa hai
 According to the Puranas, this is the Brahma region, where Brahmins originated from Brahma country as soon as Brahmins went to other country, they were named as that country
 jo vindhyas ke dakshin kshetra main gaye ve maharashtriya, dravid, karnataka or gurjar bramhan ke rup main pratishthit hue
 And those who settled in the north countries of the Vindhyas, they were revered as Saraswat, Kanyakubj, Gond, Utkal, Maithil Brahman
 is tarah dashavidh bramhanon ke pratishthit ho jane par bramhadesh ke nivasee bramhanon kii pahchaan ke liye unki sarvary sangya ho gai
 Later, he started being called Sarvarya, Sarvariya, Saryuparin etc
 atah jo log sarauparin bramhanon ko kanyakubj kii hi ek shakha kehete hai, yah ek bhranti maatr hai
 There is a mention of the row holy Brahmins in the memories
 pankti paavan bramhan saruparino main hi hote hai
 Which are still known today as Panthiha or Rowanpavan
 vaise to bharatvarsh main rishiyon kii sankhya bahut rahi hai, par maatr 49 rishi hi gotrakaar hue hai
 The disciples of the sages were considered to be the promoters and the Vedas, shakhas etc
 that were taught in the ashrams of the sages, the same Veda, Upveda shakha sutra started to be considered as the gotra, which continues till the present day
 vartmaan main sarauparin bramhanon main 3, 13, 16 ghar jo kahe jate hai uske peeche ek puranic sandarbh hai jiske anusaar vedo kii raksha evam use agali peedi tak pahunchane ke liye rishi garg ke ashram main shukla yajurveda ke pathan-pathan kii prakriya aarambh hui
 Hence Rishi Garg is considered the first tribe
 rishi garg ke baad gautam phir shandilya rishi ke ashram main yajurveda or samaveda ke adhyayan kii parampara armbh ho gai
 And then these three ashrams went on to be considered the first category of Garg, Gautama and Shandilya houses
 uske baad 13 anya rishiyon ke ashramon main vedo kii anya shakhaon kaa pathan-pathan armbh ho gaya
 Which today are considered 13 houses
 chuki in tarah rishiyon ke koi kram nahin milte hai, atah inhen ek hi shrenee main mana jane laga
 Because the Atharvaveda and Dhanurveda etc
 were also taught in the ashrams of these sages, which was not considered Shreyaskar at that time
 atah aadhyatimak shiksha de rahe garg, gautam or shandilya rishi ke shrenee main anya nahin aa sake
