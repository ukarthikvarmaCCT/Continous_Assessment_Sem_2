 Electronic sports organizations are becoming popular day by day
 kriyaayein, jahaan parinaam gatividhi par nirnay se nirdhaarit hota he, unhen pradarshan yaa pratispardhaa mana jaataa he
 Sportsmanship is an attitude that inspires honest play, courtesy to teammates and opponents, ethical behavior and integrity, and a display of nobility in victory or defeat
 khel bhaavana ek aakanksha yaa lokachar ko abhivyakt karti he ki gatividhi kaa anand khud gatividhi hi uthaaye
 The famous statement by sports journalist Grantland Rice that "it is not important whether you lose or win, it is how you played the game", an expression of modern Olympic sentiment by its founder Pierre de Cobirtein that "the most important thing is
 

jeetna nahin, balki isamen hissaa lenaa" ye is bhaavana kii vishisht abhivyakti hai
 Violence arises from crossing the line between healthy competition and deliberate aggressive violence in sports
 athlete, coach, prashansak, kabhi abhibhavak kabhi-kabhi gumraah vafadari, prabhutv, krodh, yaa utsav ke taur par logon or sampatti ko hinsa kii bhent chadha dete hai
 Hooding and hooliganism have become common in national and international sports competitions and have become a major problem
 khel ke manoranjan vaale pahalu, maas media ke prasar or avkaash ke liye samay badhane ke saath-saath khelon main vyavsaayikta badi he
 This has also led to some conflict situations, where pay check becomes more important than recreational aspects or where efforts are made to make sports more and more profitable and popular and thus some important traditions are lost
 She goes
 khel ke manoranjan pahalu kaa matlab yah bhi he ki khilaadiyon or mahilaon ko aksar celibrity kii haisiyat hasil hoti he
 Over time, sports and politics have greatly influenced each other
 jab dakshin africa main rangabhed sarkari niti thi, khelon se jude kai log, vishesh rup se rugby union main aam sahmati se ek drushtikon apanaaya gaya ki unhen vahaan pratispardhaatmak khelon main hissaa nahin lenaa chahie

 In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were associated with cultural nationalism
 20veen sadi ke madhya tak koi vyakti gelic footbal khilne, prakshepan, yaa gelic athlettic association dwaara prashasit khelon main bhaag lene se roka ja saktaa tha, agar vah british mul ke footbal yaa anya khelon main bhaag letaa yaa samarthan karata
 Until recently, the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union in Gaelic locations
 yah pratibandh aaj bhi lagu he, lekin croke park main footbal or rugby khilne kii anumati dene ke liye kuch sanshodhan kiya gaya
 While Lansdowne Road is being redeveloped
 haal tak niyam 21 ke tahat, GAA ne bhi british suraksha balon or RUC ke sadasyon par gerik khel khilne par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin 1998 main good friday samjhaute ke baad is pratibandh ko hataaya ja sakaa
 Nationalism emerges many times during sports activities, or in its reporting
 rashtriya dalon main bhaag lene vaale khilaadi yaa camentator or darshak pakshpatpurna drushtikon apanaate hai
 On many occasions such tension leads to violent clashes between players or spectators within or outside the field
 khel ke buniyadi mulyon ke vipareet ye pravritiyaan apane hit or pratiyogiyon ke manoranjan ke liye apanaai jaati rahi hai
 There are many similarities with the art of sports
 aais skating va tai chi or udhaaharan ke liye daans sport, aise khel hai jo kalatmak najariye ke kareeb hote hai
 Similarly, elements of both sports and art are seen in activities such as artistic gymnastics, bodybuilding, park life, performing arts, yoga, baseball, dressage, cooking
 shaayad iskaa sabase acha udhaaharan bul fiting he, jinaki khabaren samachar patron ke kala pannon main chhaapi jaati hai
 In fact, in some situations, the game is so close to the art that it is probably related to the nature of the game
 uparokt "khel" kii paribhaasha ek gatividhi kaa vichaar vyakt karti he, jo saamaanya prayojanon ke liye nahin hoti, udhaaharan ke liye daudna keval kahin pahunchane ke liye nahin hota, balki apane liye daudna he, jaise ki ham daudane main sakasham hai
 This is close to the common idea of aesthetic value, which is above the purely executive value derived from the general use of the commodity
 jaise, saundaryabodh vaali manabhaavan car vah nahin he jo e se bi ko milti he, balki jo anugrah, shishtataa or karishmein se hamen prabhavit karti he
 In the same way, the performance of a sport like high jump does not affect us just by avoiding obstacles or crossing rivers
 isamen dikhi yogyata, kaushal or style se ham prabhavit hote hai
 The possibly obvious contact between art and sport dates back to the time of ancient Greece, when gymnastics and cholisthenics began to appreciate the physical formation, strength, and 'erate' beauty exhibited by participants
 kaushal ke rup main 'kala' aadhunik arth pracheen greek shabd 'arete se sambandhit he
 In this era, the proximity of art and sports was seen through the Olympic Games, as we have seen in ceremonies, poetry, sculpture and architecture of both sporting and artistic achievements

 nai takanic ke prayog se golf club, footbal helmet, besabaal ke balle, footbal kii gend, hockey, skates or anya upkarnon main ullekhneey badlaav dekhe gayi hai
 From health nutrition to the treatment of injuries, a player's chances have also increased as knowledge of the human body has increased over time
 athlete ab zyada umr kaa hone ke baavjood khilne main sakasham hai, unke chot jaldi thik ho rahe hai or pichhali pidiyon ke athleton kii tulana main adhik prabhavi dhang se prashikshit ho rahe hai
 The development of instruction technology has created new opportunities for research in sports
 ab khel ke pahaluon kaa vishleshan sambhav he, jinhen pehle pahunch se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 From taking motion pictures to capturing player movements or advanced computer simulations, being able to capture model physical conditions has created the ability to understand and improve an athlete's movements
 british angreji main khel kii gatividhiyaan saamaanya sangya "khel" ke rup main chihnit hai
 "sport" is more commonly used in American English
 angreji kii sabhi boliyon main, "khel" ek se adhik vishisht khelon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, "football and swimming are my favorite sports", all English speakers would feel natural, while "I enjoy sports" would be less natural to North Americans than "I enjoy sports
" 
 "khel" shabd kaa upyog kabhi-kabhi shaareerik gatividhi ke str ke alaava sabhi pratispardhaatmak gatividhiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Both sport and motor sport exhibit physical activity, such as efficiency, sportsmanship, and even professional sponsorship at high levels are associated with physically played sports

 Despite being a form of entertainment for the game participants, many games are played in front of the audience
 zyaadaatar peshewar khel kisi tarah ke 'theatre', ek stadium, maidan, golf course, daud trek, yaa khuli sadak par aam janata ke dekhne ke praavdhaan ke tahat khele jate hai
 The game now also attracts large TV viewers or radio listeners, as rival broadcasters bid large sums for 'rights' broadcasting certain sports
 footbal vishwa cap, vishwa ke lakhon-karodon tivi darshakon ko aakarshith karata he, jaise 2006 ke final ne akele puri duniya main 700 million darshakon ko aakarshith kiya
 The nfl's championship game in the United States — the Super Bowl — became one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year
 super boul ravivaar ek tarah se america main rashtriya avkaash ban jaataa he or darshakon kii sankhya itani zyada hoti he ki 2007 main prati 30 second ke slot ke liye 2

 Over the years, Naga saints meditated here for nearly 400 years by consecrating the life of the huge Anupam supernatural Shivalinga built in the main temple on the basis of the Mahamrityunjaya Yantra
 lambey samay tak yah mandir sunsaan or vismrit rahaa
 In 1850, Ayodhya Prasad, a resident of Lucknow, extended the old original temple established by the Naga saints and gave grandeur to the complex

 Diffusion plays a key role in the transport of amino acids in living cells
 sabhi vastuen, thos, drav or gaisen, bade sookshm kanon se bani hui hai
 The smallest particles are called molecules
 anu padaarthon main satat gatisheel rahete hai
 Their speeds also depend a lot on temperature
 bhinn bhinn vastuon ko yadi ek saath rakhaa jaae, to in gatiyon ke kaaran ve paraspar mil jaati hai
 The molecules of solids are very closely adjacent to each other
 dravon ke anu thoson ke anuon kii apeksha kam sate hue rahete hai
 Molecules of gases remain at a sufficient distance from each other, which is why gases mix into each other very quickly
 dravon ke anu utani shighrata se nahin milte or thoson ke anu to or der se paraspar milte hai
 Thus the joining of molecules of substances is called diffusion
 visaran ek aparivartaneey kriya he, jisamen padaarthon ke swaabhaavik bahaav se sandran kaa antar kam hota rahata he
 This action occurs in all substances
 chlorine gas ke jaar par yadi ek hawa bharaa jaar rakh diya jaae, to chlorine gas ke baari hone par bhi uske anu visaran dwaara upar uthakar donon jaaron main mil jate hai or kuch samay main ve ek se sanghathan ke ho jate hai
 If a crystal of plinth is placed in a water vessel, first the water near the crystal will become like a solution of the saucer and after some time all the water will become of the color of the saucer and after some time all the color of the saucer Will be done aisa visaran ke kaaran hota he
 If a piece of gold is placed in contact with a piece of sis, then after a few days the presence of gold in the sis and the presence of sis in the gold can be detected
 gurutvkarshan se visaran main koi rukaawat nahin padati or na utplavakta kaa hi usapar koi prabhaav padataa he
 Gases diffuse quickly
 halaki gaisen, kam ghanatv ke kaaran, adhik shighrata se or baari gaisen, adhik ghanatv ke kaaran, kam shighrata se visaran karti hai
 In this regard, Graham has proposed a law known as 'graham's Law of Gas Diffusion'
 is niyam ke anusaar samaan daav or taap par visaran kii gati gaison ke aapekshik ghanatv ke vargamul kaa vutkrmanupati hoti he
 Diffusion of gases gives us many useful results
 isaki sahaayta se ham kuch gaison kaa aapekshik ghanatv or isse anubhaar nikaal sakate hai tathaa kuch gaison ke mishran se unke sanghatakon ko alag alag kar sakate hai
 We have succeeded in the separation of isotopes of some gases by diffusion
 kuch jahrili gaisen visaran ke kaaran vaayu main itani fail jaati he ki unase haani hone kii sambhaavna bahut kam ho jaati he
 Living more than a certain amount of carbon dioxide gas in the air is very harmful for health
 prithvital par idhan aadi se bana or saans dwaara niklaa carbon dioxide baari hone par bhi visaran dwaara samast vaayu main aisa mil jaataa he ki uske anupaat main vishesh antar nahin paaya jaataa
 Marsh gas, the main gas found in coal mines, diffuses into all mines only by diffusion and is detected by testing air at one of its locations
 dravon kaa visaran gaison ke visaran kii apeksha adhik penchida he
 Their diffusion greatly depends on the nature of the substances
 sandran or taap kii vruddhi se visaran apekshaya saral hota he

 babu gulabry kaa janm main itawa, uttar pradesh main hua
 His father Shri Bhavani Prasad was a person of religious instinct
 unki mata bhi krishna kii upasika thim or sur, kabir ke padon ko tallin hokar gaaya karti thim
 This religious tendency of parents also affected Babu Gulab Rai

 MA in Philosophy After passing the examination of Gulab Rai went to Chhatarpur and became the personal secretary of the Maharaj
 iske baad ve vahaan dewan or cheef jaj bhi rahe
 After the death of Chhatarpur Maharaja Gulab Rai retired from there and started coming to Agra
 agra aakar unhone saint johns main hindi vibhaagadhyaksh ke pad par kaary kiya
 Gulab Rai remained engaged in literary practice till the last period of his life
 unki saahitiyik sevaaon ke falswaroop agra vishvavidhyalay ne unhen di

 He died in 1963 in Agra
 gulab raay ji kii rachanaayen do prakaar kii hai- darshanik or saahitiyik
 Gulab Rai Ji's philosophical works are the result of his serious study and contemplation
 unhone sarv pratham hindi ko apane darshanik vichaaron kaa daan diya
 Before them, there was a complete lack of this subject in Hindi
 gulabry ji kii saahitiyik rachanaaon ke antargat unke aalochanatmak niabandh aate hai
 These critical essays are both theoretical and practical
 gulabry ji ne saamaajik, saanskrithik, manovaigyanik aadi vividh vishyon par bhi apni lekhnee chalaakar hindi sahitya kii abhivruddhi kii he
 Gulabrai ji's language is a pure and sophisticated standing dialect
 uske mukhyatah do rup dekhne ko milte hai - clisht tathaa saral
 The language of reflective essays is clean and sophisticated
 usamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he, bhavatmak nibandhon kii bhashaa saral he
 It has the predominance of the prevalent Hindi words, as well as the use of Urdu and English words
 kahawaton or muhaavaron ko bhi apanaaya gaya he
 Gulabrai ji's language is pageant zero
 sanskrit ke prakand pandit hote hue bhi gulabry ji ne apni bhashaa main kahin bhi paanditya-pradarshan kaa praytn nahin kiya
 In short, Gulab Rai Ji's language is moderate, serious and fluent
 gulab raay ji kii rachanaaon main hamen nimnlikhit shaileyon ke darshan hote hai- 1
 Deliberative Style - This style is found in Gulab Rai Ji's critical and reflective essays
 is style main saahitiyik tathaa darshanik vishyon par gambhirtha se vichaar karte samay vaakya apekshaakrit lambey or duruh ho jate hai, kintu jahaan vartmaan samasyaayen, pracheen siddhanton kii vyakhyaayein athwa kaviyon kii vyaakhyaatmak aalochanaayen prastut kii gai hai, vahaan vaakya saral or bhavpurn hai
 An example of this style - celebrating 'rashtriya Parva' is not a sentimental sentiment
 is bhavukta kaa mulya he
 Sentimentality involves infectiousness and then infuses power
 vichaar hamaari dasha kaa nidarshan kar sakate hai kintu kaary sampadan kii prabal prerana or shakti bhaavon main hi nihit rahati he
 2
 Emotional style - This style of Gulab Rai ji has a beautiful fusion of thoughts and feelings
 yah style prabhaavshaaleen he or isamen gadhy kavy kaa sa anand aata he
 Its language is very simple
 vaakya chote-chote hai or kahin-kahin urdu ke prachlit shabdon kaa bhi prayog hua he
 An example of this style from an essay titled ‘nar to Narayana’ - ‘there was an outbreak of water in Agra in the month of September
 maine bhi vaisya dharm ke paalane ke liye paas ke ek khet main chari 'bo' rakhi thi
 The leaves of jowar were twisted into lumps
 3
 hasya or vinodpurn style - gulab raay ji ne apane nibandhon kii neerasata ko dur karne ke liye gambhir vishyon ke varnan main hasya or vyangy kaa put bhi diya he
 In this subject, he has written- 'now i have started incorporating humor in serious subjects too
 jahaan hasya ke kaaran arth kaa anarth hone kii sambhaavna ho athwa atyant karun prasang ho to hasya se bachuungaa anyathaa main prasang gat hasya kaa utana hi swaagat karata hoon jitna ki kripan yaa koi bhi anayas aae hue dhan kaa
 In order to incorporate humor in this style, Gubab Rai ji either resorts to idioms or puns
 is style ke vaakya kuch bade hai
 Urdu, Persian words and idioms have also been used in it
 gulabry ji ne moulik granthon kii rachana ke saath-saath anek granthon kaa sampadan bhi kiya he
 His works are as follows: aalochanatmak rachanaayen- navras, hindi sahitya kaa subodh itihaas hindi, natya vimarsh, aalochana kusumanjali, kavy ke rup, siddhant or adhyayan aadi
 Philosophical - Duty scripture, logic, Buddhism, history of western philosophies, outline of Indian culture
 niabandh sangrah- prakaar prabhakar, jivan-pashu, thalua club, meri asafalataayen, mere maansik upadan aadi
 Children's Literature- Science talks, Child Prabodh etc
 sampadan granth- satya harishchandra, bhashaa-bhushan, kadambari katha-saar aadi
 Apart from these, many spoon compositions of Gulab Rai have been published in magazines and magazines

 unhone aalochana or niabandh donon hi kshetron main apni pratibha or moulikta kaa parichay diya he
 He was the first person in Hindi to compose philosophical essays
 gulab raay ji ke nibandhon main naitikta kaa sandesh, samaaj ke liye pragati, sheel drushtikon, darshan ke jatil siddhaton kii saralatam vyakhya or raashtra prem kii udaatt bhaavana he
 As an original essayist, outstanding critic and successful editor, Gulab Rai ji always deserves praise and thanks for the service he has rendered in Hindi
 unke sammaan main bhartiya daktaar vibhaag ne 22 june 2002 ko ek tikat jari kiya jiskaa mulya 5 rupee tha or jis par babu gulabry ke chitra ke saath unki teen pramukh pustakon ko bhi pradarshit kiya gaya tha

06 Somna Gabbhana is a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 raja puruvaas yaa raja poras kaa rajya punjab main jhelum se lekar chenab nadi tak failaa hua tha
 It was the capital around present-day Lahore
 raja poras porawa rajvansh ke vashanj the, jinka samrajya punjab main jhelum or chenab nadiyon tak or upnivesh hipsis tak failaa hua tha
 Porus or Poros was the king of the Powers
 inkaa kshetra hidespesh or asicense ke bich tha jo ki ab punjab kaa kshetra he
 Porus fought with Alexander the Great at the Battle of Hydaspes
 poras kaa samrajya : puruvanshi mahaan samraat poras kaa samrajya vishalkay tha
 Maharaja Porus was the owner of a very large area including sindh-punjab
 poras kaa samrajya jehalam or chenab nadiyon ke bich sthit tha
 It is noteworthy that the Khokhars living in this area had killed Mohammad Ghori to avenge the murder of Rajput Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan
 ‘poras apni bahaduree ke liye vikhyath tha
 He built his empire with the support of all those who accepted his leadership over the Khukrayans
 jab sikandar hindustan aayaa or jehalam ke sameep poras ke saath uskaa sangharsh hua, tab poras ko khukhrayanon kaa bharpoor samarthan mila tha
 Thus Porus, who was himself a subharwal sub-caste and a part of the Khukrayan caste group, became their powerful leader
 ’ -ypi anand thapar Indus and Jhelum: It was difficult to set foot in the kingdom of Porus without crossing Indus and Jhelum
 raja poras apane kshetra kii prakritik sthiti, bhugol or jhelum nadi kii prakruti se acchhee tarah waakif the
 Maharaja Porus was the owner of a very large area including sindh-punjab
 puru ne is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish nahin kii ki yavan sena kii shakti kaa rahasy kya he? yavan sena kaa mukhya bal uske drutagami ashwarohi tathaa ghodon par savaar furtile teerandaaj the
 Historians believe that Puru had faith in his valor and Hastisena but that did not stop Alexander from crossing the Jhelum River and that was his mistake
 lekin itihaaskaar yah nahin jaanate ki jhelum nadi ke is paar aane ke baad sikandar buree tarah funs gaya tha, kyonki nadi paar karne ke baad nadi main baadh aa gai thi
 When Alexander attacked, he was welcomed by Ambhi, the king of gandhara-taxila and Ambi secretly assisted Alexander
 aambhi raja poras ko apana dushman samajhataa tha
 Alexander sent a message to Porus, in which he wrote to Porus surrendering to Alexander, but Porus then did not accept Alexander's subjection
 agle panne par yuddh kaa varnan


 Alexander's nobles were fully confident of winning the war on the strength of spies and deceit
 raja puru ke shatru laalchee aambhi kii sena lekar sikandar ne jhelum paar kii
 Raja Puru whom the Yavni himself describes as above 7 feet, with his powerful Gajsena, broke on the Yavani army
 poras kii hasti sena ne unaniyon kaa jis bhayankar rup se sanhaar kiya tha usase sikandar or uske sainik aatankit ho uthe the
 Indians had the stubbornness of every citizen to kill a foreigner, powerful Gaj Sena and some unseen weapons like Satfuta spear so that a single soldier could kill many enemy soldiers and horsemen including horse
 is yuddh main pehle din hi sikandar kii sena ko jamkar takkar mili
 Many valiant soldiers of Alexander's army were casualties
 yavani saradaaron ke bhayakrant hone ke baavjood sikandar apane hath par ada rahaa or apni vishisht angrakshak evam ant: pratiraksha tukdi ko lekar wo bich yuddh kshetra main ghus gaya
 There could be no threat to any Indian commander being on elephants, the king is far away
 raja puru ke bhai amar ne sikandar ke ghode bookifilas ko apane bhaale se maar daalaa or sikandar ko jameen par gira diya
 The Greek army had never seen this happen in all its wars
 sikandar jameen pargira to saamne raja puru talwaar liye saamne khadaa tha
 Sikandar was just a moment's guest when Raja Puru shouted
 yah dar nahin tha, shaayad yah arya raja kaa kshaatr dharm tha, baharhaal tabhi sikandar ke angrakshak use teji se vahaan se bhaga le gaye
 The only information available on Porus is from Greek sources, though historians have argued that Porus was likely to be a descendant of the Puru tribe mentioned in the Rigveda, based on his name and location of his domain
 itihaaskaar ishwari prasad ne kaha ki poras yaduwanshi shorseni ho saktaa tha
 He argued that Porus' troops from Porus saw a banner of Herakles by Megasthanis, who was clearly identified with the Shorasanis of Mathura by Chandragupta on his visit to India after Porus
 megastenis or arian ke heracals kuch vidwaanon dwaara krishna ke rup main or anya logon dwaara unke bade bhai baldev ke rup main pahachaane gaye hai, jo shorsenis ke purvajon or sangrakshak devataaon donon the
 Ishri Prasad and others, following his lead, found more support for this conclusion in the fact that a part of the Shoresenites migrated west from Punjab and modern Afghanistan to Mathura and Dwarka after Krishna's demise and there were new States were established
 sindhu or jhelum ko paar kiye bagaiyr poras ke rajya main pair rakhana mushkil tha
 King Porus was well aware of the natural condition of his region, the geography and nature of the Jhelum River
 maharaja poras sindh-punjab sahit ek bahut bade bhu-bhaag ke swami the
 Puru did not try to find out what is the secret of the power of the Yavana army? The main force of the Yavana army was its fast cavalry and agile archers riding horses
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki puru ko apni veerta or hastisena par vishwaas tha lekin usne sikandar ko jhelum nadi paar karne se nahin roka or yahi uski bhul thi
 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river
 jab sikandar ne akraman kiya to uskaa gandhar-takshashila ke raja aambhi ne swaagat kiya or aambhi ne sikandar kii gupt rup se sahaayta kii

 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized

 His father believed that his mother tongue should be well versed before learning English
 vikrampur main 1915 main ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue basu ne kaha- "us samay par bacchon ko angreji vidyalayon main bhejnaa haisiyat kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 In the Bengali school i was sent to, i used to sit on my right side, the son of my father's Muslim attendant and on my left the son of a fisherman

 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887–88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia

 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye
 Bose had done all his research without any good equipment and laboratory, so Jagdish Chandra Bose was thinking of making a good laboratory

 The russia-japan war was the result of this challenge
 rus or japan ke bich kai kshetron par prabhutv jamaane ke liye ghor tanatin chal rahi thi
 There was a big difference of opinion about both Manchuria and Korea and due to these problems a war broke out between the two

 Coal, iron and gold are found here in abundance
 aise kshetra par prabhutv sthaapan ke liye rus or japan ke bich sangharsh hona swaabhaavik tha
 Russia wanted to bring this territory under its influence and for this it had many schemes
 1894 i
 ke baad rus ne china kaa paksh liya tha or japan par prabhaav daalkar liyaotung pradesh se japani adhikaar hataane ke liye japan ko baadhya kiya
 After some time there was a treaty between Russia and China, according to which Russia got the right to lay a thousand miles long rail-line to Bladivostok in Manchuria
 port arthur or uske sameep kaa pradesh pachchis varsh ke liye rus ko patte par mila or yahan roosi sarkaar apane jangi jahaaj surakshit rakhane ke liye kilabandi shuru kar chuki thi
 Port Arthur had become Russia's largest military base in the Pacific Ocean, due to which Russia's power in the region became very strong
 manchuriya main railway line ke nirmaan ke liye do companiyon kaa sanghathan kiya gaya tha, jin par rus kaa niyantran tha
 a bank was established for the financial management of these companies, which was also controlled by Russia
 rail linon ke nirmaan ke liye bahut-se roosi manchuriya main aa rahe the
 To protect these lines, a large army of Russians also started living in this region
 manchuriya main rus ke badhate prabhaav se japan bahut adhik chintit ho rahaa tha
 He did not want Russia to control the region
 japan swayan manchuriya par apana adhikaar kaayam karnaa chahta tha
 This was a very suitable place for the expansion of the Japanese Empire
 china-japan yuddh ke baad japan ke liyaotung pradesh par apana jo adhikaar kaayam kiya tha, uske peeche yahi swaarth chipa hua tha
 However, due to opposition from Russia, Japan had to take suzerainty over the region by accepting amendments to the Treaty of Shimonoseki
