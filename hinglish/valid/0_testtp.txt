 samudri toofaan - ko japani bhashaa main sunami bolte hai, yani bandargah ke nikat kii lahar
 Actually, they are very long - that is, hundreds of kilometers in width, that is, the distance between the lower parts of the waves is hundreds of kilometers
 par jab ye tat ke paas aati hai, to laharon kaa nichalaa hissaa zamin ko chune lagata he,- inaki gati kam ho jaati he or oonchaai bad jaati he
 In such a situation, when they hit the coast, there is catastrophe
 gati 420 kilometre prati ghanta tak or oonchaai 10 se 18 meter tak
 That is, a running wall of saltwater
 aksar samudri bhukampon kii vajah se ye toofaan paidaa hote hai
 They are very common in the Pacific Ocean, but not in the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea

 When there is a very fast movement within the sea, a storm rises in it, causing a surge of long and very high waves that move with a strong impulse, these waves are called tsunamis
 darasal sunami japani shabd he jo su or nami se mil kar bana he su kaa arth he samudr tat auki nami kaa arth he lehren
 The first tsunami has also been taken as a rising tide in the sea, but it is not so
 darasal samudr main lehren chaand suraj or grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav se uthati hai lekin sunami lehren in aam laharon se alag hoti hai
 The same thing happened on 11 / 03 / 2011 sunami laharon ke peeche vaise to kai kaaran hote hai lekin sabase zyada asardaar kaaran he bukamp
 iske alaava zamin dhansane, jwalamukhi fatne, kisi tarah kaa visphot hone or kabhi-kabhi ulkapaat ke asar se bhi sunami lehren uthati hai
 Whenever the upper layer of the sea suddenly moves forward due to a severe earthquake, the sea starts moving upwards in its parallel position
 jo lehren us vaqt banati hai wo sunami lehren hoti hai
 An example of this may be that the top layer of the earth is interlinked like the layers of football or that it is like an egg with cracks
 pehle sunami ko samudr main uthne vaale jowar ke rup main bhi liya jaataa rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he
 Actually, the moon flying in the sea rises under the influence of sun and planetary gravity, but tsunami waves are different from these common waves
 jaise andey kaa khol sakht hota he lekin uske bheetar kaa padaarth lizlija or geela hota he
 Due to the impact of the earthquake, these cracks widen and cause such a stir in the material inside that it quickly moves upwards
 dharti kii paraten bhi jab kisi bhi asar se chaudee hoti hai to wo khisakati hai jiske kaaran mahadweep banate hai
 So this way these tsunami waves are formed
 lekin ye bhi zaruri nahin ki har bukamp se sunami lehren bane
 For this, the center of the earthquake must be in or around the sea
 jab ye tsunami lehren kisi bhi mahadweep kii us parat ke uthle pani tak pahunchati hai jahaan se wo duusare mahadweep se judaa he or jo ki ek daraar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 There the intensity of the tsunami wave decreases
 wo isliye kyon ki us jagah doosraa mahadweep bhi jud rahaa he or vahaan dharti kii judi hui parat kii vajah se daraar jaisi jo jagah hoti he wo pani ko apane andar rasta detii he
 But after that when the tsunami moves along the inner water towards the shore, it is so fast that it can rise up to 30 meters and whatever way trees, forests or buildings come in its way - can clear everything is
 sunami lehren samudri tat par bheeshan tareeke se hamalaa karti hai or jaan-maal kaa buree tarah nuqasaan kar sakati he
 These are difficult to predict
 jis tarah vaigyanik bukamp ke bare main bhavishya vaani nahin kar sakate vaise hi sunami ke bare main bhi andaaza nahin laga sakate
 But by looking at the record of the tsunami so far and the condition of the continents, scientists can make some guesses
 dharti kii jo plates yaa paraten jahaan-jahaan milti he vahaan ke aasapaas ke samudr main sunami kaa khatara zyaada hota he
 Like where the Australian layer and the Eurasian layer meet, there is Sumatra which is connected to the Philippine layer on the other side
 sunami laharon kaa kahar vahaan bhayankar rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 saanchaa:bhopal Division Quantum Number Related: sanyukt: In particle physics, the lepton number is the subtracted number subtracting the number of perleptons from the lepton
 sameekaran rup main, Thus all leptons are assigned a +1, all perleptons are assumed to be −1 and leptons numbered 0 for those that are not leptons
 lepton sankhya ek yogaj kwantum sankhya he, arthath kisi bhi anyonya kriya main kul lepton sankhya sangrakshit rahati he
 Compared to leptonic numbers, leptonic family numbers are also defined: uparokt leptoneey pranali ke anusaar hi sambaddh kan parivaar ko +1, pratikan parivaar ko −1 or donon se rahit ko 0 aavantit kiya jaataa he
 The law of conservation of lepton number is applied in various physics models, including the standard model of particle physics, in which the lepton number is preserved, an example is beta decay: yahan abhikriya se purv lepton sankhya 0 he ek berion he atah abhikriya se purv koi lepton nahin he) evam abhikriya ke pashchaat kul lepton sankhya 0 honi chahie, proton kii lepton sankhya 0, electron kii +1, evam pratinutrino ke liye −1 he
 Hence the total lepton number after the reaction is zero and this amount is preserved
 lepton parivaar sankhya paribhaashit karne kaa aadhaar yah he ki saamanytah prayek lepton parivaar kii lepton parivaar sankhya sangrakshit rahati he
 For example, the decay of muon is usually as follows: arthath electroni tathaa muaneey sankhya sangrakshit rahati he
 This means that the leptonic family number is preserved for each l e { \ displaystyle L_ {e}}, l μ { \ displaystyle l _ { \ mu}} and l τ { \ displaystyle l _ { \ tau}}
 maanak pratimaan main leptoneey parivaar sankhya sangrakshit rahati he yadi nutrinon dravyaman rahit kan hai
 Since neutrino oscillations have been observed, the mass of neutrinos is very small but rather zero and the LF number is just an approximation
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki lepton sankhya sangrakshan niyam kaa yahan paalan nahin hota
 Thus the following muon decay can also be seen: chahat 1996 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he

 tamil main is dharm ko shivadvait dharm athwa lingayat dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in North India is Shaivagam

 In the first four Vedas, Shreekar Bhashya, who was the first of the Rigveda, attested the rendering of Parambrahm to the Lord Shiva
