 It is estimated that there will be some 4 million Mongol speakers in all these areas
 in vishaal kshetron main rahanevaale mongol jati ke sab logon ke dwaara sweekrut koi ek adarsh bhashaa nahin he
 But within the so-called Mongolia, the Halha dialect of Democracy Mongol is gradually assuming the role of ideal language
 swayan mongolia ke log bhi is halha boli ko parishkrut boli maanate hai or isi boli ke nikat bhavishya main adarsh bhashaa banane kii sambhaavna he
 In ancient times, the literary Mongol written in the Mongol script was considered an ideal language among the educated people
 parantu ab yah mongol lipi janatantr mongolia dwaara tyaag di gai he or isaki jagah roosi lipi se banaai gai nai mongol lipi sweekaar kii gai he
 Thus, now the literary language written in Mongol script is less and the Halah dialect written in New Mongol script is considered more valid

 There is not much difference between medieval and modern Mongol
 pracheen mongol ke bare main spasht gyaat nahin he
 The history of Mongol literature begins with the history of the mystery of Mongolia built in the middle of the 13th century
 tathakthith aadhunik sahitya 1921 main hui anakranti ke aasapaas se aarambh hota he parantu ab tak mahatv kii rachanaayen adhik nahin hai
 Three important texts were written in the seven centuries up to 1920 before the birth of modern literature - the history of the mystery of Mongolia, the story of Gezer Khan and the city "mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas" sheershak granth main mongol jati ke janm se lekar chinagis khan tak kaa itihaas he or chinagis khan par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 It is written in very simple and beautiful language and poems are also mixed in between
 isamen choti si kamjor jati ke mongol logon ke ikatthe hokar kendriya sattatmak desh banane, parivarapradhan samaaj se badalakar jagiradaari samaaj banane tathaa chote se jagiradaaron ke ikatthe hokar bahut prabal desh banane tak kaa itihaas varnit he
 "the story of Gesar Khan" is the story of a man based on mythology
 isamen jagirdaar ore pujari varg ke virudv ladanevaali janata kii prashansa kii gai he
 "jangar" is a historical tale made in western Mongolia
 isamen ek purush ke kaaryo ke madhyam se janata ke kalyaan or sukh par jor diya gaya he
 Golden history is very famous in historical texts, the gem of history

 These include ancient Mongol mythology, folklore etc

 She was named Billy by her aunt, Amrit Kaur, who was the secretary of Mahatma Gandhi and the first woman health minister in the Nehru government, her education took place in the British Raj, her father in the Balrampur princely state was given the court-office by the British Ward was appointed, so his childhood was spent in the princely state of Balrampur

 Being the son of a royal family and a great officer, he achieved a high status and joined the british-indian Army, after the Second World War, he made sure to make the Kheri forests a shelter
 purv main inaki riyasat kii tamaam sampattiyaan khiri va baharich main rahi thim jinhen angrejon ne inke purakhon ko riward ke taur par di thi
 After the Second World War, Billy made the forests of Kheri his home and lived here for fifty years and made his matchless contribution to wildlife conservation, which is an example in the whole world today
 billy jivan paryant dudhwa neshnal park ke onreri wildlife warden rahe
 Billy, who was a member of the UP Wildlife Board and the Indian Wildlife Board, was in close association with Mrs Gandhi, who has dedicated his book to tara-a Tigress, Mrs Indira Gandhi

 The determination to live and cultivate in the middle of the forests in Kheri was the first step of Dudhwa National Park to come into existence
 1946 main apane pita ke naam par jasvir nagar farm kaa sthapit karnaa or fir 1968 main tiger haven kaa, yah pehla sanket tha niyati kaa ki ab khiri ke yah van apana vajood barkaraar rakh sakege, nahin to aaazaad bharat main angrejon dwaara sthantarit kiye gayi shakhu ke vishaal van betahasha kaate ja rahe the, jaahir si baat he hamane aazaadee to le lee thi kintu hamaari nirbharta prakritik sansadhano par hi thi or shaayad aaj bhi he! indira ji kii vajah se hi tiger haven main baaghon va tenduon ke punarvaasan kaa prayog sambhav hua
 This was a period when film makers from across the country and abroad were competing for who would make their best documentary on these unique experiments of Billy
 bharat ke kisi bhi abhayaarany kii charchaa itani nahin thi jitani billy ke is privet faresti kii thi jise sari duniya tiger haven ko jaanati he
 After the Second World War, this international figure, Billy Arjan Singh, left the british-indian Army, made the vast jungles of Kheri a great one and gave it a beautiful result, which we know today as Dudhwa National Park
 shuruwati dinon main palia se sampoornanagar jane vaali sadak par apane pita jasvir singh ke naam par ek farm house kaa nirmaan kiya or kheti ko apana jariya banaaya
 Once a hunter, Billy, riding in his forest one day, entered the forest and was stunned to see the middle part of the Suheli and Nevara rivers, covered with incomparable natural beauty, the earth around which extended forests of shaku
 yahi vah ghadi thi jisane tiger haven ke pradurbhaav kaa nishchay kar diya tha
 This forest was purchased by Billy in 1969 AD, with saritas in the south-north and dense forests in the west-east
 or yahan baaghon or tenduon ke liye tiger haven kii sthapana kii
 Due to the continuous efforts of Arjan Singh, Dudhwa National Park was started in 1977 and then the Tiger Project was started and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve was established in 1988 by combining Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Vihar
 tiger haven se sate sathiana renj ke jangalon main barasinha ke awaas he jise sangrakshit karwaane main billy kaa yogadan vismaraneey he
 Arjan Singh always kept saying that wild-life should be separated from forest department and made a separate department, wild-life department! Because at that time, the forest department was more in the attempt to cut down the forest than to save it, the government was treating the forests by timber mafia
 yadi yah alag vibhaag bana diya jaay to isamen shaamil hone vaale log vanya-jivan kii visheshgyata hasil karke aayenge
 The broken chains of forests were a matter of concern for Billy, because the tigers are very large and if the forests shrink, the tigers will also become less! In this once inaccessible area, "the Collective Farms and Forest Limited cleared 10,000 hectares of forested land and people migrated from Pakistan and later settled in Bhoodan Andolan
 Turned into fields
 or dudhwa jangal kaa van-tapu main tabdeel ho gaya
 Which always annoyed Billy
 aazaadee ke baad jis tarah is junglee kshetra main logon ne ruukh kiya or van-bhoomi ko krishi bhumin main tabdeel karte chale gayi vahi vajah ab baaghon or anya jeevon ke astitv ko mitaa rahi he
 It was because of his desire to have more protected areas for tigers that the Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary came into existence, which is now a part of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve

 The result is the generation of Tara which is flourishing in the forests of Dudhwa
 billy ko tara ke siberian yaa anya naslon kaa mila-jula hona bataakar badnaam karne kii koshish kii or ise naam diya "anuvanshik pradooshan" jabaki anuvashik vigyaan ke mutabik bhugolic simaaon va vibhinn vaataavaraniya kshetron main rahane vaali jatiyon kaa aapas main sambadh hanikaarak nahin hota he balki behatar hota hai
 If that were the case, no British would establish matrimonial relations in any Asian country, nor any Asian or American
 bhartiya parampara main bhi samgotreey vaivaahik sambadh amaanya he or vigyaan kii drushti main bhi, fir kaise siberian yani rus kii nasl vaali is baghin kaa bharat ke baaghon se sambadh anuvashik pradooshan hai
 In order to avoid the dangers of in-breeding, they establish relationships between organisms of different communities so that their gene-diversity is maintained and Billy thus established this diversity among the tigers of Dudhwa
 dudhwa main tara kii vashanwali nirantar sanmriddh ho rahi he, dudhwa ke baaghon main indo-siberian nasl kii upasthit ko ek vaigyanik santhaan bhi maan chukaa he, kintu adhikarik taur par ise maanane main intjamiyaan dar rahi he
 It has been proved that tigers in Dudhwa forest are strengthening this breed with gene diversity of siberian-royal Bengal tiger
 is anuvanshik vivadhita ke kaaran bhartiya baaghon kii nasl ab or behatar hogi
 Otherwise, these tigers in the jungles of the shrunk forests would maintain a relationship 


 in the same gene pool 


 and in-breeding would weaken their breed

 The Rawat people sing the story of a buffalo named "buffalo Son Sagar"
 kahani is prakaar he : Raja Mahar Singh had a cattle herd of close to a million
 unamem se ek thi son sagar naam kii bhens, son sagar har saal janmashtami ke din sone kaa baccha paidaa karti thi
 But that golden child was not visible to anyone
 raja mahar singh ne ek baar ghoshan kii ki agar koi vyakti unhen sone kaa baccha ko dikhaa de, to usko apana aadha rajya, aadhi maweshia de degaa or apni bahan khoilan ke saath shaadi bhi kara degaa
 But the person who fails will be put in jail
 na jane kitne ravat ahiron aaye par kisi ko bhi safalataa nahin mili
 Everyone was imprisoned
 ant main aaye teen bhai-teen bhaiyon jo the bahut kam varsh ke: bada kathaita - 12 varsh kaa tha, selhan 9 saal kaa or sabase chota kaubia jo sirf 6 saal kaa tha
 The king felt very sad, he tried to convince the three brothers "why do you three brothers want to go to jail?" But the three said that they would try not to go to jail
 iske baad teenon bhaiyon son sagar bhens ko duusare jaanwaron ke saath charaane lage
 On seeing the night of Janmashtami arrived
 teenon bhaiyon ne kya kiya pataa he, son sagar bhens ke gale main ghanti band di
 The night progressed
 bhens ek dabre ke andar chali gai
 The elder brother Kathaita did not lay on the buffalo and Selhan and Kaubiya slept there
 par jaise raat badhati gai, kathaita ko bhi badi jor kii neend lagi or vah bhi so gaya
 At the same time, Sone Buffalo went out of the tomb and went to the Shiva temple
 har saal janmashtami kii raat main rajkumaari khoilan usee mandir main puja karne aati thi
 And as soon as Son Sagar gave birth to the golden child, Princess Khauilan offered her as a vase
 use bhagwaan shankar ne aashirwad diya tha ki janmashtami main use apana pati milegaa
 The princess was going for a bath
 son sagar bhens jaise hi sone kaa bachche ko janm diya, rajkumaari khoilan turant use apni sari main chipa lee or phir nahaane chali gai
 Sone Sagar Buffalo went back to the same dabber
 kathaiti kii sabase pehle neend khul gai - vah turant dabre bheetar gaya or phir hairaan khadaa rah gaya
 Selahn and Cobia also went in as soon as they woke up and understood Kathaata by surprise
 ab kya hogo? teenon bhaiyon bade du:khee hokar khadey rah gayi - iske baad kathaita ne budhimatta kaa parichay diya - usne dhyaan se janmin kii or dekhne laga - ye to son sagar ke pav kaa nishaan - to iskaa matlab he ki vah kahin baahar gai thi
 Selhan and Cobia were searching within that tomb, if they found the sleeping child somewhere
 idhar kathaita son sagar ke paanv ke nishaan ke saath chalata gaya, chalata gaya - jab vah shiv mandir tak pahunch gaya to dekha ki rajkumaari khoilan nahaake aa rahi thi
 Kathaita felt that the princess was taking away something
 usne puchh rajkumaari se, to rajkumaari bahut naaraaz ho gai
 As both were quarreling, the sleeping child suddenly fell
 rajkumaari ko achaanak yaad ai ki bhagwaan shankar ne to mujhe vardaan di thi ki mujhe meraa pati yanhi milegaa
 He told the whole thing to Kathaita
 kathaita bada khush hokar sone ke bachche ko lekar raja ke paas pahunchaa
 The king was surprised at first - after that he fulfilled his promise
 isi tarah kathaita or khoilan kii shaadi ho gai

 The Kurukshetra war was fought between the Kauravas and the Pandavas to attain the throne of the Kuru kingdom
 mahabharat ke anusaar is yuddh main bharat ke praayah sabhi janapadon ne bhaag liya tha
 According to Mahabharata and other Vedic literature, it was the largest war in the history of Vedic period in ancient India
 is yuddh main lakhon kshatriya yoddha maare gayi jiske parinamswaroop vaidic samskruti tathaa sabhyataa kaa patan ho gaya tha
 Apart from kings from all over India, Kshatriya heroes from many other countries also participated in this war and all the heroes gained momentum
 is yuddh ke parinamswarup bharat main gyaan or vigyaan donon ke saath-saath vir kshatriyon kaa abhaav ho gaya
 In a way, the Vedic culture and civilization which was at the peak of development was abruptly destroyed
 pracheen bharat kii svarnim vaidic sabhyataa is yuddh kii samaapti ke saath hi samaapt ho gayi
 This great war was described by the great sage and philosopher of the time, Lord Ved Vyasa, in his epic Mahabharata, which was remembered by singing and listening throughout India for millennia
 mahabharat main mukhyatah chandravanshiyon ke do parivaar kaurav or pandav ke bich hue yuddh kaa vrittant he

 ukt yuddh ko haryana main sthit kurukshetra ke aasapaas hua mana jaataa he
 The Pandavas were victorious in this war
 mahabharat main is yuddh ko dharmayuddh kaha gaya he, kyonki yah satya or nyaay ke liye ladaa jane vaala yuddh tha
 Many remains associated with the Mahabharata period have been found in Purana Qila in Delhi
 purana kila ko pandavon kaa kila bhi kaha jaataa he
 Arms and spears of the Mahabharata period have also been received by the Archaeological Survey of India in Kurukshetra
 gujarat ke pashchimi tat par samudr main duube 7000-3500 varsh puraane shahar khoje gayi hai, jinako mahabharat main varnit dwarka ke sandarbhon se joda gaya, iske alaava barnava main bhi laakshagrih ke avshesh mili hai, ye sabhi pramaan mahabharat kii vaastaviktaa ko siddh karte hai
 The main reason for the Mahabharata war was the high ambitions of the Kauravas and the infatuation of Dhritarashtra's son
 kaurav or pandav aapas main sahodar bhai the
 Vedavyas ji was born to Niagara through the womb of Vichitravirya, Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu were born from the womb of Ambalika
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari ke garbh se sau putron ko janm diya, unamem duryodhana sabase bada tha
 Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was ruled in his place, so that Dhritarashtra always had a grudge against Pandu and his sons
 yah dwesh duryodhana ke rup me faleebhoot hua or shakuni ne is aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 At Shakuni's behest, Duryodhana made many conspiracies from childhood to Lakshgriha
 parantu har baar wo vifal rahaa
 When Yudhishthira was made the crown prince when he was young, he tried to kill him by sending him to Lakshagriha, but the Pandavas escaped
 pandavon kii anupasthiti main dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya parantu jab pandavon ne vaapis aakar apana rajya vaapis maanga to unhen rajya ke naam par khandahar rupi khandav van diya gaya
 At Dhritarashtra's request, Yudhishthira accepted this proposal to avoid the crisis of civil war
 pandavon ne shrikrishna kii sahaayta se indra kii amaravati puri jitani bhavy nagari indraprastha kaa nirmaan kiya
 The Pandavas collected abundant gems and money and performed the Rajasuya Yajna
 duryodhana pandavon kii unnati dekh nahin paaya or shakuni ke sahyog se dyut main chhal se yudhisthir se uskaa sara rajya jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kar use apamaanit kiya
 Probably the seeds of the war of Mahabharata had fallen on this day
 antatah punah dyut main harkar pandavon ko 12 varsho ko gyaatvaas or 1 varsh kaa agyatavaas sweekaar karnaa padaa
 But even after fulfilling this condition, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa, parantu shrikrishna ne yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Then Sri Krishna went to the Kurujya Sabha on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacemaker and there, Krishna offered Duryodhana to stop the war by giving only five villages to the Pandavas
 parantu jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to antatah yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahunche, jahaan yah bhayankar yuddh ladaa gaya kurukshetra ke us bhayanak or ghamaasan sanhaarak yuddh kaa anumaan mahabharat ke bhishma parv main diye ek shloke se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki Bhrata bharatrantra swatriyaan ma matulah॥ 12 varshon ke gyaatvaas or 1 varsh ke agyatavaas kii shart puri karne par bhi jab kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 But Shri Krishna said that this war can cause destruction of the entire world civilization, so he suggested to make every effort to stop the war
 shrikrishna ne kaha ki duryodhana ko ek antim avasar avashya dena chahie, isaliye shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or duryodhana se pandavon ke saamne keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 When Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Sri Krishna explained to him that due to this persistence of Duryodhana, many innocent people along with his descendants and companions would have to sacrifice war
 is baat krodhit hokar duryodhana ne shrikrishna ko bandi banane kii koshish kii parantu shrikrishna maaya kaa prayog karke sabko apane viraat rup se bhaybheet kar vahaan se chale gayi
 After this Yudhishthira had to be forced to fight
 usee samay bhagwaan vedavyas ne dhritarashtra ke paas jaakar kaha ki tumhaare putron ne samast gurujanon kii baton kii avhelnaa karke antatah mahavinashkari yuddh ko khadaa hi kar diya
 On requesting to know the information of Dhritarashtra war, Ved Vyas told him that if you want to see this great war, then i can give you divine vision
 is par dhritarashtra ne kaha ki isamen mere hi kul kaa vinaash hona he, isaliye main is yuddh apni aankhon se nahin dekhuungaa
 So please make such a arrangement that i keep getting news of this war
 yah sunakar vedavyas ji ne sanjay ko bulaakar use divya drushti de di or kaha, “he dhritarashtra! maine sanjay ko divya drushti pradaan kar diya he
 There will be no such thing in the entire war zone which is hidden from it
 yah tumhen is mahayuddh kaa sara vrittant sunaayegaa
 After saying this, Ved Vyas went away
 jab yah nishchit ho gaya ki yuddh to hoga hi, to donon pakshon ne yuddh ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar deen
 Duryodhana was preparing for war for the last 13 years, he got education of mace war from Balram ji and with hard work and practice, he became better than Bhima in fighting mace war
 shakuni ne in varshon me kii vishwa ke adhiktar janapadon ko apni taraf kar liya
 Duryodhana wanted to make Karna the commander of his army, but on Shakuni's persuasion, Duryodhana made Pithama Bhishma the commander of his army, due to which many districts of India and the world were in favor of Duryodhana
 pandavon kii taraf keval vahi janapad the jo dharm or shrikrishna ke paksh me the
 According to Mahabharata, Kurujaya was the largest and powerful district in the world during the Mahabharata period
 vishwa ke sabhi janapad kururajya se kabhi yuddh karne kii bhul nahin karte the evam sauhardpurn sambandh banaae rakhte the
 Therefore, all the districts agreed to help them in the war with the greed of benefiting by the Kurus
 pandavon or kauravon dwaara yadavon se sahaayta maangane par shrikrishna ne pehle to yuddh main shastr na uthaane kii pratigya kii or phir kaha ki "ek taraf main akelaa or duusari taraf meri ek akshuhinee narayani sena", ab arjuna va duryodhana ko inamen se ek kaa chunaav karnaa tha
 Arjuna chose Shri Krishna, then Shri Krishna gave one of his Akshohini army to Duryodhana and himself accepted to be the charioteer of Arjuna

 Then Krishna met Karna and explained to him that he was the brother of the Pandavas, so he should fight on behalf of the Pandavas, but Karna did not leave the Kauravas with Duryodhana's debt and friendship
 iske baad kunti ke vinati karne par karn ne arjuna ko chhodkar uske shesh chaar putron ko avasar praapt hone par bhi na maarane kaa vachan diya

 Before the war, Arjun asks Shri Krishna to take his chariot to the middle of both the armies so that he can see which of the warriors he has to face in the war
 jab arjuna yuddh kshetra main apane guru dron, pitamah bhishma evam anya sambandhiyon ko dekhtaa he to vah bahut shokgrast evam udhaas ho jaataa he

 The content of Sociology extends from the microscopic level of face-to-face contact to the broader level of society at large

 Traditionally, its focus has been on social stratification, social relations, social interaction, religion, sociology | culture] and divergence, and its approach incorporates both qualitative and quantitative research techniques

 The origins of sociology, including economic, political and cultural systems, are proto-sociological in the combined repository of Western knowledge and philosophy
 plato ke samay se hi saamaajik vishleshan kiya janaa shuru ho gaya
 It can be said that the first sociologist was the 14th century North African Arab scholar, Ibn Khaldun, whose first work to bring forward socio-scientific theories of litigation, social unity and social struggle

 It was later founded in 1838 by August Comt

 comt ne saamaajik kshetron kii vaigyanik samaj ke madhyam se itihaas, manovigyaan or arthshaastra ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Writing shortly after the distraction of the French Revolution, he established that social evils can be overcome through social determinism, a philosophical approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy and a General View of Positiveism
 comt ko vishwaas tha ki ek 'pratyakshvaadi str' maanviya samaj ke kram main, dharmik atakalon or aadhyatmik charnon ke baad antim daur ko chihnit karegaa
 Although Comt is often considered the "father of sociology", the subject was formally founded by another structural pragmatic thinker Emil Durkheim, who established the first European Academic Department and later developed positivism

 The systematic approach of early theorists towards sociology was to deal with this subject in the same manner as natural science
 kisi bhi saamaajik daawey yaa nishkarsh ko ek nirvivaad aadhaar pradaan karne hetu or apekshaakrit kam anubhavjanya kshetron se jaise darshan se samajashaastra ko pruthak karne ke liye anubhavvaad or vaigyanik vidhi ko mahatv dene kii talash kii gai
 This approach, called positivism, is based on the assumption that only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge and that such knowledge can only come from positive confirmation of theories, through rigorous scientific and quantitative methods
 emil durkhim saidhantik rup se aadhaarit anubhavjanya anusandhan ke ek bade samarthak the, jo sanrachanaatmak niyamon ko darshane ke liye "saamaajik tathyon" ke bich sambandho ko talash rahe the
 His position was stimulated by his dismissal of "anomie" and his interest in social findings for social reform

 Reactions against positivism began when the German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel voiced against both empiricism, which he dismissed as non-critical and determinism, and which he saw as over-mechanistic
 Karl Marx's methodology was not only derived from Hegel's provincial linguism, but also the exclusion of positivism in favor of critical analysis, seeking to complete the empirical acquisition of "facts" while erasing illusions
 uskaa maananaa rahaa ki anumaanon ko sirf likhane kii bajaay unki samiksha honi chahie
 Despite this, Marx attempted to publish a science of society based on economic determinism of historical materialism

 The first generation of German sociologists at the end of the 20th century formally introduced procedural non-positivism, with the proposition that research should focus on human culture's standards, values, symbols, and subjective perspectives on social processes
 maiks webar ne tark diya ki samajashaastra kii vyakhya halke taur par ek 'vigyaan' ke rup main kii ja sakati he, kyonki yah khaas kar jatil saamaajik ghatana ke adarsh varg athwa kaalpanik sarleekaran ke bich - kaaran-sambandhon ko pahchaanane main sakasham he
 However, as a non-positivist, in contrast to the relationships discovered by natural scientists, a person seeks relationships that are "unhistorical, immutable, or commonplace"
 Ferdinand Tönnis described the two common types of human organizations as the gameshafts and Presented to Gesellschaft
 toniz ne avadharana or saamaajik kriya kii vaastaviktaa ke kshetron ke bich ek spasht rekha khinchi: pehle vaale ke saath hamen swatahsiddh or nigamanaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa chahie, jabaki duusare se prayogsiddh or ek aagamanaatmak tareeke se

 In Austria and later America, Alfred Schutz developed social phenomenology, which later brought about social constructionism

 samajashastriyon ne nae prakaar ke maatraatmak or gunatmak shodh vidhiyon kaa vikaas kiya
 Parallel to the rise of various social movements in the 1960s, particularly in Britain, cultural change saw the rise of anti-social theory emphasizing social conflict, which confronted the functionalist approach

 Often, social analysis of postmodernism, marked by intertextuality, mixing and satire, and generally perceived as the cultural genre 'postmodernism', introduced a distinct era that concerned the disintegration of metanarratives and object worship and capitalist
 In the latter half of the society, the reflection reflected with consumption
 Postmodernism is also associated with some thinkers' rejection of Enlightenment conceptions of the human entity, such as Michel Fuco, Claude lévi-strauss, and to a lesser extent Lewis Altuser, an attempt to reconcile Marxism with non-humanism
 Most theorists associated with these movements actively rejected this label, giving the importance of accepting postmodernism as a historical event rather than some kind of critical method
 phir bhi, sachet uttaradhuniktaa ke ansh saamaanya rup main saamaajik or raajnneetik vigyaan main ubharate rahe
 Sociologists working in the anglo-saxon world, such as Anthony Giddens and Jigmant Baumann, focused on the principles of iterative iteration in terms of the 'higher stage' of communication, globalization, and modernity rather than proposing a specific "new" natural age

 The extent to which the subject can be portrayed as a science has been a major issue in the context of basic nature philosophy and knowledge epistemology questions

 Although essentially since the 19th century, all the leading theorists have acknowledged that sociology is not a science in the traditional sense of the word, the ability to strengthen causal relations is the same as the basic philosophical discussions made in science trans-theory

 Structure and means is a permanent debate point in social theory: "do social structures or human means determine a person's behavior?"
