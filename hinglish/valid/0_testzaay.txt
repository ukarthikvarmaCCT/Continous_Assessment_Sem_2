 Ballet continued to develop even in the 20th century and had a tremendous influence on concert dance
 For example, let us tell you that the style of dance that choreographer George Balanchine developed in America is known as neoclassical ballet
 uske baad ke vikaason main shaamil hai samakaleen baile or post-strectural baile, jo ki germany main wiliam forsithe kii kritiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 Classical ballet is the most organized among ballet styles; It follows the traditional ballet technique

 Talking about the most popular ballet styles, they include the Russian method, the Italian method, the Danish method, the Balanchine method, or the New York City ballet method, and the Royal Academy of Dance and Royal Ballet School originated from the Sesetti Method prepared in England

 Around this time, Ali was unable to secure a zoological survey of India's post of zoological survey of India due to lack of a formal university degree, which was eventually given to ML Runwal
 haalaanki 1926 main mumbai ke prince of wales sangrahalay main haal main shuru hue ek prakritik itihaas khand main 350 rupe ke vetan par ek guide ke rup main vyaakhyaata niyukt hone ke baad unhone padhai karne kaa faisla kiya
 However, he was tired of work after working for two years and in 1928 decided to take a study leave for Germany, where he was to work under Professor Irwin Stresemann at the Museum of Zoology of the University of Berlin

 unhen hug wislar se kaaphi sahaayta or samarthan praapt hua jinhone bharat ke kai bhaagon kaa surveykshan kiya tha or isse sambandhit kaaphi mahatvapurn nots rakhe the
 Interestingly, Whistler was initially irritated by this unknown Indian
 da study of indian bards main wislar ne ullekh kiya ki greater racket-tail drongo kii lambii punch main aantarik falak par weabing kii kami hoti he
 Salim Ali wrote that such inaccuracies have been extant from early literature and made it clear that this was wrong about the turning of the spinal cord
 shuru-shuru main wislar ek agyaat bhartiya dwaara galat surveykshan se naaraaz hue or jarnal ke sampadak esech pretor or sar reginald spence ko "ghamand" se bharaa hua ek patr likhaa
 Whistler later examined the samples again and not only admitted his error but also became a close friend of Ali's
 wislar ne saalim kaa parichay richard menortzegan se bhi karavaaya or donon ne milakar afghanistan main abhiyaan kiya
 Although Meinertzhagen's views about Salim were also critical, they also became friends
 saalim ali ne menortzegan ke pakshi kaaryon main kuch bhi khaas nahin paaya lekin baad ke kai adhyayanon main kapatata ko paaya gaya
 Meinertzhagen used to write a diary from the days of the survey and Salim Ali reproduced it in his autobiography: 30

1937 'I am disappointed in Salim
 He is quite useless at anything but collecting
 He cannot skin a bird, nor cook, nor do anything connected with camp life, packing up or chopping wood
 He writes interminable notes about something-perhaps me


 Even collecting he never does on his own initiative

1937 'salim is the personification of the educated Indian and interests me a great deal
 He is excellent at his own theoretical subjects, but has no practical ability, and at everyday little problems is hopelessly inefficient 


 His views are astounding
 He is prepared to turn the British out of India tomorrow and govern the country himself
 i have repeatedly told him that the British Government have no intention of handing over millions of uneducated Indians to the mercy of such men as Salim:

 Ali was not very keen about the details of bird classification and taxonomy and is more interested in studying birds in the area
 arst mer ne riple ko shikaayat karte hue likhaa ki ali paryaapt namoonon ko ikattha karne main vifal rahe hai: "jahaan tak sangrah karne kii baat he mujhe nahin lagata ki ve kabhi shrinkhalaa ekatrikaran kii aavashyaktaaon ko samaj sake hai

 Ali had considerable influence on conservation related issues in post-independence India, especially through Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi

 Some historians noted that the approach used by Salim Ali and BNHS for conservation was undemocratic
 saalim ali ke kai vichaar apane samay ke mukhya dhara ke vichaaron se vipareet the
 One of the questions he was often asked was the collection of bird specimens, especially later in life when he was known for conservation-related activism
 haalaanki kabhi shikaar sahitya ke prashansak rahe ali ke vichaar shikaar ko lekar kade rahe lekin unhone vaigyanik adhyayan ke liye pakshi ke namoonon kaa sangrah jari rakhaa
 His own view was that the practice of wildlife conservation requires practicality and should not be based on a philosophy like non-violence
 unhone kaha ki yah moulik dharmik bhaavana bharat main pakshi adhyayan ke vikaas main ek baadha tha
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics
 – Ali :195 He grew up in a Muslim home and was taught to read the Quran in his childhood days without understanding Arabic

 Sant Tukaram, also known as Tukaram was a great saint poet of the seventeenth century who was a major pillar of the long-standing devotional movement in India
 tukaraam kaa janm pune jile ke antargat dehu naamak gram main shake 1520; san 1598 main hua
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding his date of birth, and considering it from all angles, birth in 1520 seems to be valid
 purv ke aathven purush vishwambhar baba se inke kul main vitthal kii upasna baraabar chali aa rahi thi
 All the people of his family used to visit Pandharpur regularly
 dehu gaanv ke mahajan hone ke kaaran vahaan inkaa kutumb pratishthit mana jaataa tha
 His childhood was spent under the supervision of mother Kanakai and father Baheba, but when he was 18 years old, his parents died and at the same time due to the famine in the country due to the hunger of their first wife and small child
 Died in agony
 vipattiyon kii ye baaten jhuti hai sant tukaraam us jamaane main bahut bade jamidaar or saavkaar the ye jhute batehai ye likhaawate juthi he jwaalaon main jhulase hue tukaraam kaa man prapanch se ub gaya
 His second wife, brother-in-law, was in great shock
 ye sansaarik sukhon se virakt ho gaye
 With the idea of peace of mind, Tukaram would go to a hill called Bhavnath near Dehu village every day and spend days in remembrance of Lord Vitthal
 prapachaparaduukh ho tanmayata se parameshwar prapti ke liye uthkanthit tukaraam ko baba ji chaitanya naamak sadhu ne magh shuddh 10 shake 1541 main 'ramakrishna hari' mantra kaa swapn main upadesh diya
 After this, he spent 17 years preaching the world equally
 sachche vairaygy tathaa kshamashil ant:karan ke kaaran inaki ninda karanevaale nandak bhi paschataap karte huue inke bhakt ban gaye
 Thus, while teaching everyone of Bhagavata religion and highlighting the path of charity, Tukaram, who denied the iniquity, worshiped Falgun Badi Dwadashi, Ske 1571
 tukaraam ke mukh se samay samay par sahaj rup se parisphutit honevaali 'abhang' vaani ke atirikt inaki anya koi vishesh saahitiyik kriti nahin he
 Nearly 4000 abhagas sung by him in the latter part of his life and written by his disciples are available today
 sant gyaneshwar dwaara likhi gai 'gyaneshravari' tathaa shri ekanath dwaara likhit 'ekanathi bhagwat' ke barkari sampradaywaalon ke pramukh dharmagranth hai
 The impression of this Vandmay is reflected on Tukaram's violations
 tukaraam ne apni sadhak avasthaa main in purvakaleen santon ke granthon kaa gaharaai tathaa shraddha se adhyayan kiya
 The same spiritual thread is threaded in the literature of these three saint-poets, and the intimacy of the transcendental ideas of the three is also consistent
 gyandev kii sumdhur vaani kaavyalankar se mandit he, ekanath kii bhashaa vistrut or rasplavit he par tukaraam kii vaani sutarabaddh, alpakshar, romantic tathaa marmbhedak hai
 Tukaram's unbroken Vadmay is extremely self-centered and he has a complete vision of his spiritual life
 kautumbik aapattiyon se trast ek saamaanya vyakti kis prakaar aatmasaakshatkaari sant ban sakaa, iskaa spasht rup unke abhangon main dikhalaai padataa he
 In them, three stages are seen in the form of realization of their spiritual character
 pratham sadhak avasthaa main tukaraam man main kiye kisi nishchayanusaar sansar se nivruth tathaa parmarth kii ore pravruth dikhalaai padate hai
 In the second stage, Tukaram started living in a state of extreme despair after seeing the efforts of God interview failed
 unke dwaara anubhoot is chanam nairashya kaa jo savistaar chithran anbhang vaani main hua hai uski hridayavedhakta marathi bhashaa main sarvatha adwitiya he
 In the darkness of Kinkartavyamudha, the fierce Tamswini, who was tormenting Tukaram Ji's soul, came to an end soon and Tukaram, enlightened by the sun of self-realization, entered into Brahmananda
 unke aadhyatmik jeevanpath kii yah antim evam chirvaanchit safalataa kii avasthaa thi
 In this way, after the completion of the cultivation of Ishvapriya, the sermon that appeared from Tukaram's mouth is very important and meaningful
 swabhaavat: spashtvaadi hone ke kaaran inaki vaani main jo kathorta dikhalaai padati he, uske peeche inkaa pramukh uddeshy samaaj se dushton kaa nirdalan kar dharm kaa sangrakshan karnaa hi tha
 He always followed the truth and continued the work of hypocrisy as well as hypocrisy while not paying attention to anyone's happiness and unhappiness
 dabhik sant, anubhavshoonya potheepandit, duraachaari dharmaguru ityadi samaajakantkon kii unhone atyant teevr aalochana kii he
 Tukaram was a fatalist from the heart, so the picture of the human world depicted by him is crawling with despair, failure and impulse, however he never gave such a sermon to 'renounce the world' for the worldly
 inke upadesh kaa yahi saar he ki sansar ke kshanik sukh kii apeksha parmarth ke shaashvat sukh kii prapti ke liye maanav kaa praytn hona chahie
 Poetically fortunate, so the picture of the human world depicted by him is depressed, failure and impassioned, yet he never gave such a sermon to 'renounce the world' for the worldly
 inke upadesh kaa yahi saar he ki sansar ke kshanik sukh kii apeksha parmarth ke shaashvat sukh kii prapti ke liye maanav kaa praytn hona chahie
 Most of Tukaram's poetry is in the Kabal Abhang verses, however he has also written allegorical works
 sabhi roopak kavy kii drushti se utkrisht hai
 His voice has the wonderful ability to catch the listener's heart as soon as it falls
 inke kaavyon main alankaaron kaa yaa shabdachamatkaar kaa prachurya nahin he
 Their unbroken form are formed
 thode shabdon main mahan arthon ko vyakt karne kaa inkaa kaushal marathi sahitya main adwitiya he
 Tukaram's soulful disguise is also dear to the masses
 iskaa pramukh kaaran he ki saamaanya maanav ke hriday main udbhoot honevaale sukh, du:kha, aashaa, niraashaa, raag, lobh aadi kaa prakatikaran isamen dikhalaai padataa he
 Tukaram's Vadmany has attained the pole position in Janaka's heart
 gyaneshwar, namdev aadi santon ne bhagwat dharm kii pattaaka ko apane kandhon par hi liya tha kintu tukaraam ne use apane jeevankaal hi main adhik unche sthaan par fahraa diya
 He made spiritual science accessible and, while playing the sting of devotion, made such a path of devotion easily accessible to the elderly
 sant tukaraam ne is baat par bal diya he ki sabhi manushya parampita ishwar kii santan hai or is kaaran samaan hai
 The 'maharashtra Dharma' was propagated by Sant Tukaram whose principles were influenced by the Bhakti movement
 maharashtra dharm kaa tatkaaleen saamaajik vichaardhaara par bahut gaharaa prabhaav pana
 Although it did not succeed in fudging caste and varna system, it cannot be denied that its proponents did succeed in making the varna system flexible by rendering the principle of equality
 maharashtra dharm kaa upyog shivaji ne ucchwargeey maraathon tathaa kunbiyon bahujan shudra ko ekasutra main baandhane ke liye kiya

 Brightness, luminosity or lightness is an aspect of visual perception in which light appears to be emerging or reflected from a source

 In 2005, at a ceremony in his honor upon the retirement of Alan Greenspan's US Federal Reserve, Rajan presented a controversial paper criticizing the financial sector
 us shodhpatr main unhone sthapit kiya ki andhaadhundh vikaas se vishwa main aapadaa haaavee ho sakati he
 Rajan argued that financial sector managers are motivated to: "unhen aise jokhim uthaane hai jo gambheer va pratikul parinaam utpann kar sakate hai magar isaki sambhaavna kam hoti he
 But these risks in turn provide unaccounted compensation for the rest of the time
 in jokhimon ko tail risk ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 But the most important concern is whether the banks will be able to provide the financial markets with the liquidity that can reduce the stress of the financial situation if the Tel Risk is implemented? And the loss should be allocated in such a way that its impact on the real economy is minimized
 " And thus Rajan predicted the collapse of the world financial system for 2007-2008, just 3 years ago

 Before the arrival of semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube diodes or copper-oxide or selenic-stack diacritics were used
 dishtakaari ke kaary ke ulta kaary karne vaali yukti ko inwarter kehete hai
 Often all decorators are made by connecting one or more diodes in a particular order
 adhik diod ke prayog se praayah disi apekshaakrit adhik shuddh hoti he arthath isamen In this type of rectifier, only half of the A-C is sent under load while the remaining half is prevented from entering the load
 yah bahut kam shakti ke output ke liye hi prayog main liya jaataa he, adhik shakti ke liye nahin
 Because it transfers electric power with very little efficiency
 ek phej ke paripathon main half-wave ractifire keval ek diod kaa istemaal karke banaaya ja saktaa he
 
 teen-feji supplai main iske liye teen diod lagate hai
 Voltage Regulation = Good everej voltage = ve maiks / pai Average current = i max / pi aaremes voltage yaa prabhavi voltage = ve maximum / 2 RMS current or effective current = i max / 2 dakshata = 40

 Two types of full-wave rectifiers are used in one-phase circuits: centre-tap ractifire ke liye do hi diod lagane passage hai kintu iske liye ek centre-tap yukt transfarmar kii zarurat padati harrchhentre tap / midpoint rectifier-supplai ke positive cycle ke dauraan diod D1 farward bis ho jaataa he or band kunjee kii tarah vyavhaar karata he is diod D2 reverse by so jaataa he tathaa khuli kunjee kii tarah vyavhaar karata he supplai ke negative cycle ke dauraan diod D2 farward bis so jaataa he band kunjee kii tarah vyavhaar karata he is dauraan diod D1 reverse bis ho jaataa he tathaa khuli kunjee kii tarah vyavhaar karata he!average voltage =2vmax / fhaievareja karant = do imax / When more power DC is required, it is more appropriate to rectify three-phase AC rather than one-phase electric power
 iske liye 6-diod lagate hai
 For example, today's automobiles have a 3-phase bridge alternator with a 3-phase alternator that creates DC to charge the battery

 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised

 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"

 dhaatuon kaa sanksharan rasinic kriya he, jiske falswaroop dhaatuon kaa kshay evam hraas hota he
 The erosion of metals , which results in the degradation of metals due to mechanical factors, is different from this action
 dhaatuon main sanksharan vastut: rasinic kriya, athwa vaidyutracinic kriya, ke rup main hota he
 According to the root base, both of the above types of corrosion actions are different stages of the root action
 dhaatuon kii sanksharan kriyapranali kii mukt urja main vishisht evam aavashyak rup main nunata utpann hoti he
 The interaction of a gas, or a humid environment, in the corrosion of metals by direct chemical action produces suitable conditions for corrosion
 sanksharan kii vidyutracinic kriya main, dhaatuon ke drav main nimajjit hone se, vidyutdhara utpann hone kii upyukt paristhitiyaan utpann ho jaati hai
 Thus, there is electrodynamic degradation of metals in corrosion
 unamem tathaa dravon main nimajjit hone se dhaatuon kii sanksharan keval uparyukt paristhitiyon par nirbhar nahin karti, anya karkon kaa bhi vishesh evam mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 Generally, the final product produced in the corrosion reaction of metals is a compound which is found in nature as a mineral substance
 udaahranarth, taanbe ke patt ko bahut varshon tak aantarasthaleey vaataavaran main, khuli avasthaa main rakhane se patt ke upree tal par ksharak sulphate kii ek parat germ jaati he
 This copper base sulfate is similar to brokatite mineral found in nature
 isi prakaar lohe athwa ispaat ke patt ko lavniya jal main purnat: nimajjit rakhane par varsha main uske tal par jalyojit loh oxide kii kathor parat jam jaati he
 Hydrated ferric oxide is similar to the mineral gothite found in nature
 is prakaar dhaatuon kii sanksharan kriya dhaatuon ke madhyasthayee dhatvik avasthaa main sthaayee oxikrut avasthaa main prayaavartan kii kriya he
 Metals that are found in nature in their pure form, such as gold, do not usually have corrosion action by the factors present in nature and consequently such metals are found in an unconnected state
 sanrachanaatmak aadhaar par sanksharan kriya nimnaankit vibhinn swaroopon main dhaatuon par prabhaav utpann karti he : Prevention of corrosion of metals theoretically excludes all measures and factors that encourage the reversal of the permanent state

 Complete exclusion of the above factors is often impossible in the prevention of corrosion
 at: inaki upasthiti main swayansthirak kriyaaon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The factor that causes maximum inhibition on the speed of corrosion under special conditions of metal corrosion is called the controlling factor of corrosion
 audyogic drushti se mahatvapurn praaia: sabhi dhaatuon ke bahya tal par vaataavaran main khule rahane se dikhaai denevaali, athwa na dikhaai denevaali, sookshm parat jam jaati he, jo anuvarthi sanksharan prakriyaayon ko prabhavit karti he
 Generally this layer is made of open metal oxide
 iske gun mul dhaatu ke gunon se bhinn hote hai tathaa khule rahane kii paristhitiyon se bhi vyavahaarabhinnata utpann hoti he
 In most circumstances this layer of oxide prevents corrosion of the parent
 is prakaar kii moti parat jab prasaaran evam sankuchan ke kaaran kahin kahin se tut jaati he, tab in sthanon par vidyut-rasinic-sanksharan prarambh ho jaataa he
 Corrosion of metals is divided into the following six parts: uparyukt prayek dasha ke sanksharan prakram main visheshta hoti he or iske nivaaran ke liye bhinn bhinn upaay kiye jate hai
 Various methods are used in the corrosion prevention of metals, the following being: sanksharan nivaaran kii antim reeti sarvaadhik upyog main aati he
 In this manner, a natural preventive overlap of oxides, such as oxides on the clean outer surface of the metal, is used or a similar synthetic surplus material is used
 adhilep dwaara nivaaran kii is reeti main rangalep evam isi prakaar ke anya lepon kaa upyog hota he, jinamein ksharak chromet padaarth, litharge, rakt sis, laal loh oxide, graphite, vitumini padaarth aadi pramukh hai
 Galvanization, metallization, cementization, electrolytic overlap and other metal overlays are increasingly used in corrosion prevention

 dharmasudhar kaa yah naveen swaroop samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti par vichaar karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 The sense of reverence that Christians have had for centuries for the Catholic Church promoted by Christ had been reduced for several reasons
 14veen shatabdi main ek francisi pope kaa chunaav hua tha, jo jivan bhar france main hi rahe
 As a result, for 40 years later two pope existed, one in France and one in Rome, dividing the entire Catholic world into two parts
 aathvin shatabdi main frank jati ke katholic raja ne italy par akraman karne vaali lonward sena ko haraakar italy kaa madhya bhaag pope ke adhikaar main de diya or is prakaar roman katholic carch ke parmadhikari dharmaguru ke atirikt ek saadhaaran shaasha bhi ban gaye
 For this reason, the kings of Germany and France instinctively tried to interfere in the affairs of the Church and especially in the election of the Pope
 14veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main yah chunaav italy ke abhijaat varg kii pratiyogita kaa maidan ban gaya tha jisase vyakti kii yogyata par kam, uske vansh par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga
 As a result, at that time, extremely inept pope was elected and morality and religion began to be neglected in the court of Rome
 at: rome ke carch ke prati shraddha kaa ghat janaa nitant swaabhaavik tha
 Another reason for dissatisfaction was that the institutions of the entire church were taxed according to their property and the representatives of Rome always wandered and collected this money

 is safalataa ke anek kaarnon kii kalpana kii gai he : The pathetic condition of the Catholic Church in the early 15th century and the inaction of its masters, the aid of politicians eager to seize the property of the Church, the movement of personal freedom due to the Renaissance, new features of propaganda from the invention of printing

 anterdahan ingine aisa ingine he jisamen eendhan evam oxykaarak sabhi taraf se band ek belanakaar dahan kaksh main jalte hai
 In this process of combustion, often the air acts as an oxidizer
 jis band kaksh main dahan hota he use dahan kaksh kehete hai
 This combustion reaction is exothermic which produces high temperature and high pressure gases
 ye gaisen dahan kaksh main lage hue ek piston ko dhakelti hue failtin he
 The piston is connected to a crank shaft through a connecting rod, thus when the piston moves downwards the crank shaft attached to the connecting rod starts to rotate, thus converting the chemical energy of the fuel into first thermal energy and then thermal Energy is converted into mechanical energy
 anterdahan ingine ke vipareet bahirdahan ingine, main kaary karne vaala taral kisi anya kaksh main kisi taral ko garam karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 Often the piston reciprocating engine, in which combustion occurs after a period of time, is called the internal combustion engine, but jet engines, most rockets and many gas turbines also fall under the category of internal combustion engines in which combustion is going on continuously

 aajkal automobile main prayukt adhikansh ingine anterdahan ingine hi hote hai
 The idea of the invention of the combustion engine began in the medieval period

 main dach vaigyanik chrishchiyan higes ne ek urdhv silinder or piston ke ingine kaa suzav rakhaa tha, jisamen barood ke visphot se piston upar chadhe
 But this type of engine never worked
 baad main dahansheel gaison tathaa khanij tailon ke avishkaar se unka suzav vyaavhaarik ho gaya kyonki barood kii jagah idhan dene kii samasya sulajh gai
 But still many years of practical and theoretical studies were needed to make the engines of this class compatible with practical utility
 antardahan injanon main idhan ke rup main dijal, petrol, alcohol athwa prakritik yaa kritrim gas ityadi kaa prayog hota he
 But generally petrol and diesel are used only
 antardahan ingine do siddhanto par kaary karte hai - chaturghaat chakra or dwighat chakra In a four-stroke engine, the four-stroke suspension, compression, power and exhaust process is complete

 Inertial locomotives have two species, direct-activated engines and amphibious active engines
 ekadish sakriy injanon main kaaryakari padaarth piston ke keval ek ore rahata he; ubhaydish sakriy injanon main donon ore
 They have a long cylinder and both parts of the piston have suction, compression etc
 adhikansh antardah ingine ekadish sakriy hote hai
 For example, engines in motorcars are of this type
 parantu bahuterey bade ingine ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai
 Amphibious active engines generate nearly twice as much energy as direct-activated engines and have a nominal increase in size, but there are many mechanical difficulties in building amphibious active engines
 isliye keval badi naav ke injanon main hi ubhaydish sakriy ingine laabh daayak hote hai
 On the other hand, steam engines and air compressors are usually made active amphibians, although this is not a mandatory rule

 For simplicity of calculation, we can imagine that the two actions in a cycle are both sub-entropic and two constant
 kalpit chakra ke vishleshan main sugamawa ke liye maan liya jaataa he ki kaaryakari padaarth keval vaayu he
 It is also assumed that neither suction shock nor exhaust shock occurs
 is vishleshan ko vayumatrik vishleshan kehete hai
 In actual engines, gases are exhausted
 uske badale mana jaataa he ki sthir aaytan par gaisen thandi ho jaati hai
 The work is the same, whether the gases are discharged, whether they are cooled, in every case the heat generated by the burning of fuel remains the same
 jis dar se urja kaary main roopantarit hoti he use shakti kehete hai; yah samay ke ekak main kaary kii maatra he
 The work that is done on the piston of the engine with the piston moving back and forth is called the specified function and the power calculated according to the specified work is called the specified horsepower
 ingine kii dhuree tak jitna kaary pahunchataa he vah dhuree kaary athwa brake kaary kehalaata he or is kaary ke anusaar utpann shakti ko brake ashwashakti kehete hai
 Several grounds can be taken to determine how much power an internal engine can receive
 motorcar ingine banaanevaale apane vigyapanon main apane ingine kii mahattam shakti bataate hai, jo tab praapt hota he jab samast paristhitiyaan mahattam rup se anukool hoti hai
 But manufacturers of industrial engines generally determine the power of their engines according to the power generated at approximately the greatest thermal efficiency
 audyogic injanon kaa samarthy isi prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa uttam bhi he
 The reason is that if the engines are run at the prescribed capacity, then the fuel cost will be minimal and then they will be able to operate at higher power for some time if needed
 prayek antardahan ingine main praapt shakti isapar nirbhar rahata he ki piston kii ek daud main jitna idhan-vaayu-mishran silinder main pravisht hota he uskaa dravyaman kya he
 Therefore, the reasons for which this mass will decrease will reduce the power of the engine
