 GPRS was developed as a GSM response to earlier CDPD and i-mode packet switched technology
 GPRS, GSM circuit switchd data kshamtaaon kaa vistaar karata he or nimnlikhit sevaaon ko sambhav banaata he: If SMS is used over GPRS, an SMS transmission speed of 30 SMS per minute can be achieved
 yah GSM par saadhaaran SMS kaa upyog karne se adhik tej he, jisaki prasaaran gati 6 se 10 SMS prati minute he
 GPRS supports the following protocols: jab TCP / IP kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, to prayek phone ko ek yaa ek se adhik IP pataa abantit kar sakate hai
 GPRS, during cell transfer, will store IP packets and forward them to the phone
 TCP handles any packet loss resulting in a temporary flow-stop in transmission speed
 GPRS kaa samarthan karne vaale upkarnon ko teen virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: To broadcast at two different frequencies at the same time, a true class a device may be required and thus two radios will be required
 is mahangi aavashyaktaa se bachane ke liye, ek GPRS mobile dohari antaran vidha ko lagu kar saktaa he

 In addition to GPRS, two other GSM technologies exist that provide data services: circuit-switched data and high-speed circuit-switched data
 Unlike the shared nature of GPRS, these rather establish a dedicated circuit
 Some applications, such as video phones, may prefer HSCSD, especially when there is a continuous flow of data between the ends
 nimnlikhit talika, GPRS or circuit switchd data sevaaon ke kuch sambhav vinyas ko prastut karti he
 The multiple access method used in GPS with GPRS is based on frequency division duplex and TDMA
 ek satr ke dauraan, ek upyogkarta ko ek jodi ap-link or down-link frequency channel saunpa jaataa he
 This time domain is combined with statistical multiplexing, that is, packet mode communication, which makes it possible for multiple users to share the same frequency channel

 apan, sevaaon ko paribhaashit karata he jaise wireles aplicoshan protocol abhigam, sankshipt sandesh seva, multimedia sandesh seva or internet sanchaar sevaaon ke liye jaise email or world wide web
 To establish a GPRS connection to a wireless modem, the user must specify an APN, optionally a username and password, and rarely an IP address, provided by all network operators

 shailivigyaan bhashavigyaan evam sahityashastra donon kii sahaayta letaa hua bhi donon se alag swatantra vigyaan he
 On the one hand stylology studies linguistics on the basis of the principles of literature, which includes rasa, ornamentation, curvature, sound, manner, instinct, tendency, word-power, virtues, defects, images, symbols etc
 duusari ore shailivigyaan ke antargat bhashaa-style kaa adhyayan bhashavigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jisamen bhashaa kii prakruti or sanrachana ke anushilan ko mahatva diya jaataa he
 There are mainly two directions for the study of stylistics: sahityashastra ke aadhaar par kisi kavi, lekhak, kriti kaa stylivaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he arthath ras, alankaar, vakrokti, reeti, dhwani, gun, dosha, vritti, pravriti, bimb, chand aadi ke aadhaar par dekha jaataa he ki lekhak yaa kavi ne sahityashastra ke siddhanton kaa anusaran uchit rup main kahan tak kiya he evam kriti yaa rachana kii style main sahityashastra ke niyamon kaa paalan vyavasthit dhang se kahan tak hua he
 This type of study will be considered as the object of the field of literature
 bhashavigyaan ke aadhaar par kisi kavi yaa lekhak kii rachana main prayukt bhashaa kii prakruti or sanrachana ke tattvon kaa vaigyanik vishleshan karte hai
 Five elements of language are considered on the basis of nature and structure - sound, word, form, sentence and meaning
 iske aadhaar par dekha jaataa he ki kavi kii bhashaa main kahan dhwani-vichlan, dhwani-chayan, dhwani-samaanaantar kaa prayog hua, kahan shabd-vichlan, shabd -chayan, shabd-samaanaantar kiya gaya
 Similarly, study is also done at the form-level, sentence-level and meaning-level

 Thus on the basis of linguistics, the language of the writer is analyzed with great depth

 There have been many important works on stylistics in Western literature
 saath hi anekanek granth bhi prakashit hue hai, in grantho main shailivigyaan ke swaroop ko atyant vistaarpurvak samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Indian scholars are trying to understand and explain the form of stylistics by following these texts
 yahi kaaran he ki kuch vidwaan shailivigyaan ko bhashavigyaan se jodate hai, kuch sahitya shaastra se tathaa kuch bhashavigyaan tathaa sahityashastra dono se
 Some scholars accept it as an independent subject and some consider it part of experimental linguistics
 jaise bhashavigyaan ke do rup hai- saidhantik bhashavigyaan evam praayogic bhashavigyaan; usee prakaar shailivigyaan ke bhi do rup hai - saidhantik shailivigyaan evam prayogic shailivigyaan
 Theoretical stylology is the scientific interpretation of the principles of style, and in experimental stylology, a book or author's style is classified, analyzed, and analyzed on the basis of theory

 ek din nilkanthavarni mangrol ke paas 'loj' gaanv main pahunche
 There he was introduced to Swami Muktananda, who was a disciple of Swami Ramanand
 nilkanthavarni swami ramanand ke darshan ko utsuk the
 On the other hand, Ramanand Ji also used to say to the devotees that the real nut would come now, i am playing dugdugi before his arrival

 Neelkanthvarni obeyed his order

 Both men and women used to attend it

 Therefore, they arranged a separate story for men and women and also tried to prepare women storytellers
 unka mat tha ki sanyasi ko uske liye banaaye gayi sabhi niyamon kaa kathortapurvak paalan karnaa chahie
 After some time, Swami Ramanand gave initiation to Nilkanthvarni at Piplana village and named him 'sahajanand'
 ek saal baad jetpur main unhone sahjanand ko apane sampradaay kaa acharya pad bhi de diya
 Shortly thereafter, Swami Ramanand ji became corporeal

 shikshapatri, vachanamritam, satsangijivan va bhaktachintamani Famous stone art of the Iberian gram flour of the Mediterranean Sea spain main bumadhya sagar ke ibirian besan ke paas 700 se adhik sthalon jinhen samuhik rup se leventine kala kaha jaataa he, sabko milakar unesco ke zarie ek vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main 1998 main ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 All these sites fall in the eastern part of Spain and there is stone art found here which is related to the early stone era or perhaps the later stone period
 is kala main kuch chote se chitrit insaanon or jaanwaron ke chitra hai jo bahut hi aage ke daur kii takanic se bane the or aaj bhi vah baaqi hai
 It is notable for many things, including perhaps the largest area of art
 haalanki naam bumadhya sagar se sambandhit he, magar kuch sthal sagar ke paas hone ke baavjood bhi adhiktar sagar se dur aragon or kastile-laa maanchaa main hai
 It is often called Levantine art, which is indicative of being from central Spain and not in the Levant region
 vahaan maujuud chitron ke samy par kaafii bahes hui he, or kya vah pathar ke auzaar ke istemaal ke daur ke bich ke daur kaa he, shuru ke daur kaa he yaa lagbhag aakhri ke daur kaa he, yah puri tarah se tay nahin he
 Although it begins with a few glimpses of the early phase of the use of stone tools, but later shows different glimpses of different times, but a necessary sequence is clearly visible
 unesco ke hisaab se, shaayad vishwa viraasat sthal main sabase puraani kala ke anusaar 8000 isa purv or 3500 isa purv ke aasapaas rahi he jaisaaki haal ke udhaaharan se pataa chalata he

 It is these people who have been gradually incorporating new age elements into their cultural baggage
 baad ke daur main dekha ja saktaa he ki kuch purushon ne ghodon ko chalaaya or kuch pashu paalan kii parampara pai gai hai
 Chronologically, Iberian works closely with schematic art and Levantine art, and examples of both types of art can be found in some places

 Levantine art: He named it the earliest stone art on a regional basis
 magar kuch anya itihaaskaaron ne is daawey par sandeh prakat kiya tha kyonki is kala main koi jaanwaron ke chitra nahin milte jo ki aksar us samay kii kala main jhalkata tha
 Antonio Beltrán Martínez and some other historians have added time to use the tools of this stone Levantine art

 leventine kala main haalaanki maanav akruti kaa paaya janaa apane aap main durlabh he, lekin yahan par vishesh rup se paaya janaa itihaaskaaron ke gahare shodh kaa vishay he
 Human figure is not only present here but it is also a main subject of painting
 ek or visheshta yah he jahaan-jahaan maanav chitra jaanwaron ke saath aate hai to maanvon ko daudte hue drishy main dikhaaya gaya he
 In the same category of paintings, the well-known "picture of the dancers of Kogul" is considered a very good example
 deevaaron par chitrit adhikansh chitra shikaar karne se jude hai
 Apart from this, war and dance scenes are also found here
 chunki us samay krishi prarambh ho chukaa tha, yahan par kheti se sambandhit chitra bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 Like today's era, animals were reared in that era and this is seen from the pictures

 Prominent among these are portraits of Cuevas de la Aranya en Bicorp
 inasaanon kii tasveeron main sharir kaa upree hissaa bina kapadon ke he parantu mahilaon ko skirt pahane dikhaaya gaya he
 Men have been shown wearing skirts, diapers or trousers of some sort
 kabhi-kabhi chitron main pagadi yaa makhauta bhi dekha gaya he jisase shaayad saamaajik rutaba jhalkata he
 Some people associate this dress with the ancestors of American Red Indians, where the turban on the head was a sign of being a chieftain
 kuch yuddh ke chitra kisi ek paksh ko sharirik banaavat, kapadon or shastron ke aadhaar par bhinn dikhaate hai, haalaanki iskaa sahi arth samajhnaa behad mushkil he

 Be with saadhaaran sthal sena ko keval jude hue kirdaaron ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 In this period, a better sense of composition had developed among the subjects of the group, whose visual presentation can be seen in pictures such as animals leaping into the air
 maanav chaharon ko kai bhaawanaaon ke saath dikhaaya gaya yaa phir unhen bhi duusare jaanwaron kii tarah hawa main udate yaa aasmaan ko choote hue dikhaaya gaya he
 The feet are shown in opposite directions many times
 dikhaae gaye drishy kai baar drame ke drishy hai
 The images have many times shown dead and lying men and mortals
 kabhi-kabhi logon ke piv yuddh se jude chitra behad lambe or kaafii se zyaada jagah gherte the jaisaa ki kai yuddh chitron main dikhaaya gaya he jahaan par chavalis ke lagbhag purushon ke chitra dikhaai padate he
 It is clearly visible in the battle to kill the soldiers of the opposing army
 ek chitra main ek purush ko phaansi diya janaa dikhaai diya he
 These battle scenes appear to be related to later painting
 ek or mahatvapurn baat yah he ki yah saare drishy gasulla or vallota gorges ke paas se hai jo kastellon praant main he
 The bow of arrow-arrow was considered very important at that time
 yah us samay kaa sabase pramukh hathiyaar tha
 Some caves have shown illustrations showing the means of hunting prey and the intractable aiming of a sophisticated and effective solution to convey the distance between the hunter and the distant prey animal
 kuch chitron main badi sankhya ke saath hathiyaarband logon ko nrityon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Some of the other paintings also show women dancing and singing together
 mahilaon ke nrity main aisa lagata he ki unke paanv sthir hai or keval apane haathon or sharir ke upree bhaag kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 a prominent glimpse of the male-female relationship can be seen in the caves of El Kogul where eleven women are depicted wearing a nude male skirt while the male gender pattern can be seen
 maanav sharir ko dikhaane main kai saron ko utaara gaya he jinaki alag-alag visheshtaayen hai: The Levantine art mainly depicts tools such as arrows, wood, quiver, bags and ropes
 in sabhi ko maanav sharir se kisi na kisi prakaar se sambandhit bataaya gaya he
 Arrows are excluded from the category
 adhikansh chitron main tiron yun hi zamin par gira hua dikhaaya gaya he jaise ki nishaanaa chhot gaya ho
 In the Levantine art, the design of the earth is not given any importance
 ped-paudhon ke ugane kaa bhi bahut kam chitrit kiya janaa dikhataa he
 An interesting exception is the mushroom growing which is likely to be pictured of Silosibe Hispanica
 iske vipareet, leventine kala main jaanavaaron aksar pratinidhitiv diya gaya he
 In this, particularly large milking animals that are used for hunting or who can become domesticated, are notable
 parindon, machhliyon or keede-makodon ko kam hi dikhaaya gaya he
 The one exception is the spider and honey bees in the photo of honey deposition
 kuch jaanavar jo dikhaae gaye hai, vah aaj ke daur ke prajatiyon main dikhaai padate hai
 The time and history of that place is decided by the way and time it is given to Janavari
 kuch jaanwaron ke bare main daawa kiya gaya he ki ye him kaal ke hai or aaj ke yorape main viloopt ho chuke hai
 But this matter is surrounded by controversies
 kuch jaanavaaron ko aavashyaktaa se adhik maatra main rang chadaaye gaye hai taaki unki prajati ko badla ja sake, jisase badale hue samay kii nai prajatiyon ko shaamil kiya ja sake
 The main species shown are as follows: jaanavar kabhi akele to kabhi samoohon main dikhaai dete he

 There is no clear preference as to which part of the stone shelter is used for art
 kabhi yah ucch yaa aadhe maarg se upar kii deevaaron par kiya ja saktaa he
 The places were not used for settlement and no garbage deposits or organic remains are found here so that the date of the place can be fixed
 kai sthal zahiri rup se bahut adhik saje hai or kai chitra ek ke upar duusare banaae gaye hai
 Sometimes no other place near a venue holds a painting
 yah sthal adhiktar pahari ilaaqon main sthit hai or is kaaran kheti ke liye upyukt nahin hai
 But these places may be suitable for hunting because some animal may be stopped and hunted from here

 nauijiniyari, naukaaon ke nirmaan tathaa unke sanchaalan kii kala bahut puraani he
 Its discussion is found in the oldest literature
 yadhyapi bharat ke pracheen granthon kaa ek bada bhaag lupt ho gaya he, kintu veda, puranadi jitne bhi pracheen granth is samay uplabdh hai unke adhyayan se siddh hota he ki vaidic kaal main bhi bhartiya log sadrudh jahaaj banaakar samudrapar ke sudur deshon main vyapaar tathaa digvijay ke liye jaaya karte the
 An ancient treatise called Yuktikalpataru also mentions ten differences between boats and ships
 bhojraj ke samay main likhit ek granth main kaashthon kaa vargeekaran karke bataaya he ki naukanirmaan ke liye se kashtha adhik upyukt honge
 
 mahabharat ke aadi parv main vidura dwaara sthapit ek nauka ke liye "sarvavatasahaan naavan yantrayuktaan pataakinim" kahkar uske yantrachaalit hone kaa bhi sanket kiya he
 European history also shows that until the last part of the 18th century, ships were made by attaching wood to metal nails and leaves, and were driven by the power of the wind with the help of sails in the sea
 1784 i
 main jab james wat ne apana dvikriyaatmak pump ingine bana liya, tab vahaan ke logon kaa dhyaan jahaajon main vaashp kii shakti kaa prayog karne kii taraf gaya or kramash: unka dhaanchaa bhi purnataya ispaat kaa banaaya gaya
 In fact, efforts were being made to use engines on boats from the 18th century itself
 vashpainjanchalit naukaaon kaa sankshipt vikascram nimna prakaar he : In the above description, we see that all the experiments conducted by engines in the 18th century were almost unsuccessful, because the engine's structure was unidirectional, and its speed could not stabilize
 wat ke dvikriyaatmak ingine main bhi kai aise dosha the jinke kaaran naukasanchalan main badi asuvidha hoti thi
 Stephanson's valve mobilizer was also used in the early days, but when the valve valves system was invented, its use for navigation proved to be very convenient
 naukaaon par jagah kii kami ke kaaran uparyukt prakaar ke aade ingine bade asuvidha janak rahete the, at: logon ne kai prakaar ke khadey injanon kaa bhi avishkaar kiya
 By 1850, all ships or boats built in England were dominated by engines with side levers to drive their paddle cycles, which were sophisticated forms of ordinary beam engines for ships
 iske baad, graphoper naamak ek vishesh prakaar ke beam ingine kaa avishkaar hua, jo apane purvavatrti aade injanon kii apeksha kam jagah gherta tha Now even the ship boilers have become so advanced that 575 pounds per square inch of steam from the water tube boilers, whose temperature is about Rs
 399
 It can be achieved up to £ 200,000 per hour
 aadhunik jahaji vaashp ingine bhi ab itane shaktishaalee banaae jane lage hai ki unke dwaara chatushprasar kram ke prayek silinder se 1,000 se lekar 3,000 tak ashwashakti praapt kii ja sakati he
 The firm named Sulzer Brothers of Winterther makes this type of diesel engine for ship uses with up to 10 cylinders generating 1,000 horsepower in each unit
 ye dohare stroke kii vidhi se kaam karte hai
 In the early days of engine-driven ships, all boats were driven by paddle cycles, but after the propellant was invented, the use of paddle cycles in marine vessels stopped, yet they are still used in river boats
 lakdi ke pluvon kii banaavat ke anusaar pedalchakra do prakaar ke hote hai : Aryo-plavas are tightened in a radius direction above the circumference of the cycle
 pankhanuma plav apni chul par thodaa ghumkar aavashyaktaanusaar tirchhe bhi ho jate hai
 The drawback of the invertebrates is that while lifting above the water, they also carry some water with them, which causes little dissipation of engine power
 doosraa dosha yah he ki pedal chakra ke chakkar ke keval thode se bhaag main ve lagbhag udhrvadhar sthiti main rah pate hai
 In this, they can apply good power on water
 pankhanuma plav apane traigy sanyojak dandon kii sahaayta se, jo chakra ke vaksh se sambandhit rahete hai, aavashyaktaanusaar apni chul par ghumkar apane kone ko badalakar, jab tak ve pani main rahete hai usapar puraa dabaav daalate hai
 They do not carry much water with them when they go out
 pedal chakron ko chalaanevaale dhure naukaaon ke madhya bhaag main aade lagaae jate hai or nauka ke madhya main do ingine is prakaar lagaae jate hai ki yadi chahen to donon ingine milakar donon hi pedalchakron ko ek saath chalaaen or chahen to asambaddha hokar keval apane apane hi pedalchakra ko yathechha, ek aage or doosraa peeche kii taraf chalaakar, aavashyaktaanusaar nauka kii disha ko badal den yaa paitara badali karen
 To do this, the axles of the two engines meet in the middle of the axle, where the head of a axle is galvanized and the driver moves a wheel
 jab donon ko ek saath chalaanaa hota he tab vah charkhi sarakkar duusare dhure par bani ek crank pin main fas jaati he
 The engines standing to drive small boats of paddle cycles are inappropriate due to their puffy and cross-engined engines occupy a lot of space; Therefore, many special types of engines were built for them in the 19th century, which were not too high and did not occupy much space
 in injanon main stpul ingine, dyagonail ingine, ocilating ingine, pen kaa trunk ingine or moudsle kaa ritern cancting rod ingine mukhya hai
 For operating modern ships, the pendulum mounted on their rear end is called propellant or propellant or 'propellant screw'
 isaki akruti pankhenuma dikhaai detii hai, lekin kriya thik chudeedaar pench ke samaan hi hoti he
 This fanciful screw goes forward with the ship cutting the bangle in the sea water
 pench ke upar to hamen chudiyon kii puri veshthane dikhaai padati hai, lekin in pankhons main nahin dikhaai padatin, kyonki prayek pankhudi, ek bahut bade pichavaale abhikalpit pench kii patali si angodi kii ek traigy phaak hai
 As the number of lanes of bangle increases in ordinary screw, its lead length also increases by the same proportion
 pranoditr kii pankhudiyon kaa vakr bhi ek bahut badi lead main feet hota hua banaate hai
 Therefore, if a fan is of short lead then he will have to make more rounds to fix the long distance and if he is of big lead then he can fix that distance in short rounds
 jis prakaar thos pench or lead ke hisaab se chakkar lagane par ek nishchit faasla tay kar letaa he, pani main chalanevaala yah pankhenuma pench vaisaa hi nahin kar saktaa, kyonki pani taral padaarth hone ke kaaran idhar udhar vah jaataa he
 In this way, the reduction in the speed of the ship is called the propulsion or sliding of the propellant
 sarvapratham jab pranoditr kaa avishkaar hua, us samay jahaji ejiniyaron ke saamne use tej chaal se chalaane kii samasya ai
 The engine running the paddle cycles had to be very slow
 baad main drut gati se chalanevaale khadey ingine ban jane or phir tarabine tathaa dijal injanon kaa prayog aarambh ho jane se yah samasya hal ho gai
 For the propellant to function properly it is necessary that its fans are fully immersed in water
 at: use chalaanevaale dhure bhi jahaaj ke peeche kii taraf kisi upyukt prakaar ke chhed main se hokar uske frem or aavaran ke baahar nikle rahen
 It is well below the water level
 un chhedon kii paridhi or dhuron kii paridhi ke bich aisa prabandh bhi hota he ki samudr kaa pani usamen se jahaaj main na ghusane paae
 Many types of tips have been made for this work
 saadhaaran yuktiyon main dhura garam bhi ho jaataa he, at: isamen tel bharkar chalaane kaa prarvadh or vishesh avasaron par garam pani se taap kam karne kaa prabandh bhi kiya gaya he
 In ships where two or three propellants are fitted, the propellant axle is driven by fastening the shells properly to the brackets in the side frame of the ship to support the shells of the side propellants
 pranoditr ghoomte samay jab pani ko chirakar jahaaj ko aage kii taraf dhakelta he, us samay uski pratikriya ke rup main usee pariman kaa nod aage kii taraf mudata he, jisase beringon ke bahut hi sheeghra ghis jane tathaa purjon ke sthanut ho jane kaa dar rahata he
 Therefore, the back shell of the propellant axle, from which the axle exits at the rear and a boxed propellant bearing is placed between the engine or the turbine, inside which many of the callers on the axle are seated right in the grooves
 And they all bear the Nod coming from the propulsion fan
 bering ke khaanchon main, dhure kii kaalron ke donon taraf, mulaayam pital ke bane ardhachandrakaar astropatt daal diejate hai or upar se unpar tel chuane kaa prabandh rahata he
 In many propellant bearing boxes, the oil canal is made downwards, in which the axle collars run submerged
 inamen lage astropatt ghode kii naal kii akruti ke hote hai
 Until the invention of steam turbines, standing steam locomotives with cylinders were used to drive the propellants, often of an anesthetic type
 jahaajon main prayek pranoditr ko chalaane ke liye do do ingine ek jode main lagaae jate hai
 Only one of those two is used when the ship is cruising or changing direction
 jahaaj ko teji se aage chalaate samay donon ingine milakar ek pranoditr ko chalaate he
 The practice of turbines for propellants is increasing nowadays, as they are more convenient and cheaper than engines in many respects
 vaise inamen injanon kii apeksha vaashp kaa kharchaa prati ashwashakti adhik hota he
 In Fig
 16, a small ship with a propellant shows a pair of high pressure and low pressure turbines, including their condenser
 tarabine badi teji se ghoomanevaala yantra he, idhar pranoditr se dakshatapurvak kaam lene ke liye use tarabine kii apeksha kaaphi mand gati se chalaanaa padataahai
 Therefore, to slow down the speed of the propellant, it is necessary to place small and big garris in between
 tarabine kii dhuree par chota pinian or pranoditr ke dhure par bada pinian lagaaya jaataa he
 Where turbines are placed in a ship depends on the size and type of the ship
 sab se saral tarika to yah he ki ek pranoditr ke liye kam se kam ek tarabine to avashya hi hona chahie
 The second way is to have a pair of high pressure and low pressure turbine fitted with each propellant including condenser
 is prabandh main boyler main se aanevaala taaja vaashp pehle ucchdaab ke tarabine main or phir alpadaab ke tarabine main kaam karne ke baad sanghnitr main jaakar visarjeet ho jayega
 The power produced in this arrangement is partitioned in such a way that each pair of turbines can run one propellant freely on both sides through the gears
 kai jahaajon main, jinamein teen pranoditr hote hai, ucchdaab kii tarabine to bich ke pranoditr ko chalaata he or donon baajuon main lage alpadaab tarabine bagali pranoditron ko chalaate hai
 In the early period of the use of turbines, and even nowadays, turbines are also used in many large ships along with connective engines
 jab jahaaj puure veg se aage chalata he tab to tarabine or ingine donon hi milakar kaam karte hai, lekin jab jahaaj ko ulta chalaanaa hota he tab tarabine kaa sambandh dhure se kaat diya jaataa he
 While doing so, the vapor after working in the cylinder of the low pressure goes directly into the condenser instead of working in the turbine
 isamen jahaaj kaa madhyavarti pranoditr to ucchdaab, madhyadaab or alpadaab ke triprasareey sanyoji ingine dwaara chalaaya jaataa he or alpadaab ke silinder main kaam kar chukne ke baad vaashp lagbhag nau pound prativarg inch kii daab par, baajuon main lagi tarabinon ko chalaata he, jisase baajuon ke pranoditr chalate hai
 Then later this vapor is immersed in the condenser
 jin bade jahaajon kii raftaar 16 note prati ghanta se nichi ho unheen main ingine or tarabinon kaa sanyukt vinyas upyogi ho saktaa he
 This makes the use of turbines solely for high speed ships
 20veen shatabdi ke pratham charan tak jahaji injanon ko vaashp dene ke liye agninal byleron kaa hi adhiktar prayog hua karata tha, jinamein scoch sarvottam samajha jaataa tha or jalanaal byleron main vilcox-babacock byler hi shreshth samajha jaataa tha
 Now the propagation of the water tube boilers is increasing, because high volume of vapor can be obtained by them in very short time
 ab vilcox-bangkock main bhi bahut sudhaar ho gaye hai
 Apart from these, stling boilers, thornicrapt boilers, yarrow boilers, whitefowler boilers, etc
, the Jalanalika boilers are used a lot in shipbuilding
 samudri pani khaaraa hota he at: uskaa prayog sidhaa hi boyleron main nahin kiya ja saktaa or yah pine ke yogya bhi nahin hota
 To make this water workable on ships, distillation equipment, evaporators etc
 are used
 boyler ke bheetar pani pahunchaane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke bharanyantr or boyler main pravesh karne ke pehle hi use kaaphi garam karne ke liye bharan taapak lagaae jate hai
 After being used in engines and turbines, the vapor is not allowed to evaporate, stored in condensers and cooled to make it reusable as water
 asvanayantr or udvashpak to sanghnitr ke pani main honevaali kami ko hi puraa karte hai
 Refrigerators are placed to keep the food items safe throughout the journey
 sanvathan tathaa chote yantronpkarnon ko atkav kii jagahon par chalaane ke liye vayusampidak, prakaash ke liye vidyudatpadak yantra, karn gear tathaa crenon ke liye dravchaalit pump aadi upsadhitron ke rup main lagaae jate hai
 On reaching the ports, the main steam engines are turned off
 vahaan jahaaj ko aage peeche chalaane tathaa prakaash or marammat ke kaamon ke liye chote deazal or tel ingine lagaae jate hai
 Nowadays oil and petrol engines are mostly used for operating ferries and river boats
 samudr main chalanevaale chote jahaaj auto saaikal ke anusaar kaam karanevaale deazal injanon se chalaae jate hai
 Very large ships still run with steam engines and turbines, as about 5-6 diesel engines on diesel ships are able to run a propellant axle
 deazal injanon main ek hi silinder hota he, jo saadharantaya 1,000 ashwashakti se adhik kaa nahin hota
 No more than two or two and a half thousand horsepower per cylinder can be obtained from even the best of the modern, special type, diesel engines
 yadi ek pranoditr ke liye paanch deazal ingine bhi ek saath lagaae jaaen to ve hajaar ashwashakti hi praapt hogi, jabaki ek aadhunik prakaar ke bade jahaaj ko niratar 70-80 hajaar ashwashakti kii aavashyaktaa hua karti he
 Therefore, steam engines are still used to run very large ships
 haan, unpar chote mote kaamon ke liye deazal injanon se sahaayta lee ja sakati he
 Of course, diesel engines are best suited for small ships, because using them does not require boilers, coal, evaporators, fill filters, fill filters, fill tanks and condensers, and the rest of them can be used for cargo loading
 
 thodi si jagah main hi puri yatra ke liye tel bhar kar rakhaa ja saktaa he, deazal injanon ke chougird acchhee safai rakhi ja sakati he, kyonki vahaan raakh, koyala or dhuen kaa kaam hi nahin hota
 There is also no need for skilled employees like firemen and the same driver can handle multiple engines, hence there is a savings in salary
 jahaajon tathaa naukaaon kaa sanchaalan radar ke dwaara hota he, jo sternpost ke aadhaar par laga hota he
 To run it, small boats have handcuffs on the top end of the rudder's stalk, but in larger ships use small engines or hydropower devices to drive it
 radar ko ghumaane ke liye aavashyak bal radar ke aakaar, jahaaj kii raftaar or jahaaj kii anudairthay madhyarekha se radar ke palle ke kone par nirbhar karata he
 For example, if a ship is moving at a speed of 15 knots per hour, the area of its rudder submerged in water is 100 square feet and its angle is 30 degrees from the midline, then by mathematics it can be proved that that rudder It would take 32,130 pounds of force to rotate, which is beyond human capability
 is kaam ke liye brown kii hydrolic stearing telemotor, harrison kaa stearing gear, hesty kaa stearing gear or haile-shaw martineau kaa hydrolic stearing gear aadi mukhya hai
 With the thrust of small steam engines, some tread wheel rotates a large tread wheel above the rudder lashing as needed
 us chakra ko icchit jagah par roak rakhane ke liye vishesh prakaar kii kamaani or klach brake aadi bhi lage hote hai
 Plastic recycling is the process of reclaiming waste or waste plastic products and converting this material back into useful products, which at times are completely different from their original state
 udhaaharan ke liye, sheethal peya padaarth kii plastic kii botalon ko pighla kar unhen plastic kii kursiyon yaa mejon ke rup main dhaala ja saktaa he
 Usually, a plastic is not recycled into the same type of plastic, and products made from the recycled plastic are not recyclable
 sheesha yaa dhaatu jaise anya padaarthon kii tulana main, plastic polimur ke punarnavinikaran ke liye atyadhik prasanskaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Plastics have very low solubility due to their high molecular weight of large polymer chains
 ek bada anu apni puri lambaai ke saath apane aas paas ke vaataavaran se sampark sthapit karata he isliye samaan sanrachana ke carbonic anu kii tulana main iske mishran kii tapiya dharita adhik he
 Heat alone is not sufficient to melt such a large molecule, because of this, it is often necessary to have the same plastic structure to be properly mixed
 jab vibhinn kismon ke plastic ko ek saath pighalaaya jaataa he to ve tel or pani kii tarah charanbaddh dhang se or tahon ke rup main alag hote hai
 Structural weakness is found in the material obtained as a result of phase boundaries, which means that polymer mixtures are only useful in limited applications
 ricycling ke liye ek or baadha plastic main rangon, bharaav padaarthon or anya rasayanon kaa badhata upyog he
 Due to the viscosity of the polymer, filler is usually difficult to remove at low cost and will be damaged by many processes that can easily remove excess paint
 sheethal peya ke dibbon or plastic kii theliyon main rasayanon ke kam istemaal ke kaaran aksar inkaa prayog ricycling ke liye adhik kiya jaataa he
 The use of biologically degradable plastics is increasing
 yadi ricycling ke liye inamen se kuch utpaada anya plastic utpaadon ke saath mishrit ho jaaen to gunon or galnaank main antar ke kaaran isse praapt hone vaale plastic kii ricycling nahin ho sakati
 Before recycling, plastic products are separated according to their resin identification code, a method for categorizing polymer varieties, which was developed in 1988 by the Plastics Industry Association
 udhaaharan ke liye, poliethylin terrephthalet, jise aam taur par piiti kaha jaataa he, kaa rezin code 1 he
 They are also often separated according to colors
 iske baad plastic ke ricycling yogya padaarthon ko chote-chote tukdon main kaata jaataa he
 These cut pieces then undergo several processes to eliminate impurities such as paper labels
 is saamagree ko pighalaaya jaataa he or aksar tikia ke rup main baahar nikaala jaataa he jiske baad inkaa prayog anya padaarthon ke nirmaan main kiya jaataa he
 Several challenges can be solved by using a more elaborate monomer recycling process, in which condensation polymers essentially undergo the inversion of the polymerization process that produced it
 isse un rasayanon kaa mishran praapt hota he jinase mil kar mul polimar bana tha, jise shuddh kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa prayog samaan kism kii nai polimar shrinkhalaaon ko jodne main kiya ja saktaa he
 a major plant of this variety for recycling PET through the methanolysis process was opened in Cape Fear, North Carolina, USA by Du Pont, but due to economic pressures, it closed the plant
 ek anya prakriya jisame vibhinn polimar kaa petroleum main roopantaran ek kam sateek thermal dipolimerizeshan prakriya dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Such a process is capable of accepting almost any type of polymer or polymer mixture, including thermostat materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and biopolymers found in feathers and other waste agricultural products
 prakritik petroleum kii hi tarah, utpaadit rasayanon se eendhan ke saath polimur bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 a major plant of this type exists in Carthage, Missouri, United States, which uses turkey waste as an input material
 gasikaran bhi ek samaan prakriya he, lekin takneekee rup se yah ricycling nahin he kyonki antim parinaam ke rup main polimar banane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Heat compression is another process that new companies are becoming popular
 taap sampeedan prakriya main sabhi prakaar ke bina chante, sabhi kismon ke saafe plastic kaa prayog hota he, jisame naram plastic theliyon se lekar sakht audyogic kachra shaamil he or is kachare ko tambler / drum main milaayaa jaataa he
 The biggest advantage of this method is that all varieties of plastics are recyclable rather than just mixed varieties
 haalanki, drumon ko ghumaane main or post-melt pipon ko garm karne main kharch hone vaali urja ke kaaran is prakriya kii aalochana kii jaati he
 a process has also been developed in which several varieties of plastics can be used as a carbon source in recycling scrap steel
 upbhog ke pashchaat poliethylin ko vibhinn rangon ke anusaar chhanta jaataa he, saafe kiya jaataa he or prasanskaran ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 After being consumed by the consumer, this sorted PET waste is crushed, cut into layers, pressed into bundles and offered for sale
 ricycle kiye gaye piiti kaa ek anya upyog, jo abhi haal hi main lokapriy hona shuru hua he, kapadaa udyog main kapadaa banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These fabrics are made by spinning PET flakes
 yah ekadam nae piiti se poliester banane jitne saral dhang se kiya jaataa he
 Recycled PET yarn or cotton can be used alone or with other fibers to produce a wide variety of fabrics
 paramparaagat rup se in kapadon kaa upyog majboot, tikaoo, kathor utpaadon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha jaise ki jacket, kot, juute, bag, tapiyaan or anya vasteen
 haalanki, aamtaur par ye kapade twachaa ke liye atyadhik ruukhe hote hai or jhunjhalaahat paidaa kar sakate hai
 Therefore, they are generally not used in any garment that may dry out the skin, or where comfortable clothing is required
 lekin aaj nai paryaavaran ke anukool duniya main "green" utpaadon kii maang bad rahi he
 As a result, many textile companies have begun to find ways to profit in this new market and have developed new innovations to use recycled PET fabrics
 in khojon main vibhinn prakaaron se kapade kaa prasanskaran, kapade kaa upyog, yaa kapade ko anya samagriyon ke saath mishrit karnaa shaamil he

 fasiwad yaa fasistwad italy main benito musolini dwaara sangathit "fasio di kambatimento" kaa raajnneetik andolan tha jo march, 1919 main prarambh hua
 Its inspiration and name were derived from the 19th century revolutionaries of Sicily - "faces"
 mul rup main yah andolan samaajwaad yaa samyawad ke viruddh nahin, apitu udaarataavaad ke viruddh tha
 It had its origins in the pre-1914 socialist movement, which was influenced by the philosophy of the French thinker Jazzenz Sarel

 Between 1919 and 1922, Italy's law and order was being challenged by syndicalists, communists and other leftist parties

 It had successful experiments in Germany, Spain and South America
 hitler to fasism kaa karta hi tha
 Before the rise of Nazism, Riviera of Spain and Dalfas of Austria had full support of Mussolini
