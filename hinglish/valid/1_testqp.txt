 dootvakyam sanskrit ke pracheenatam naatakkaar mahakavi bhaas kii suprasiddh kavyakruti he
 It is calculated under visuals
 natyakala kii drushti se dootvaakya kii pariksha karne par ise 'vyayog' naamak roopak-bhed ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he
 Giving the definition of Vyayoga, Acharya Vishwanath has said- arthath vyayog us roopak ko kehete hai jisamen prasiddh itivrutt kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 Male characters have excess and lack of patriarchs, planning for pregnancy and discourse treaties is not expected and the entire composition ends in a number
 isamen aise yuddh kaa varnan hota he jisamen stri nimitt na ho
 There is a lack of cash flow
 iskaa nayak dhiroddhat prakruti kaa koi prakhyat vyakti hota he yaa phir koi rajarshi athwa devpurush
 It consists of any juice other than makeup, humor and cool juices
 dootvaakya main ‘vyayog’ ke mukhya lakshan ghatit hote hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 Its plot is taken from that part of the story of Mahabharata in which Lord Shri Krishna becomes the messenger of the Pandavas and goes to the Kaurava assembly
 is roopak main streepatro kaa sarvatha abhaav he
 There is talk of war on the division of the state
 kauravon main se dhiroddhat prakruti kaa duryodhana dootvaakya kaa nayak he
 In this, the predominance of Veer Rasa is not of makeup and of shanti juices
 is roopak main keval ek ank he
 The Sanskrit metaphor mainly has three elements - Kathavastu, Neta and Ras
 pracheen kaal se hi sanskrit naatak manch par khele jate rahe hai, isliye inke moolyankan main abhinay kii drushti se manchan -yogyata ko bhi paryaapt mahatva diya jaataa he
 The plot is the main element of the metaphor
 yah prakhyat, utpaada yaa mishra kisi bhi prakaar kii ho sakati he
 There is often a famous chronicle in the metaphor called Vyayoga
 mahakavi bhaas ne dootvaakya kii kathavstu mahabharat ke udyog parv se lee he
 The basic story of Mahabharata is as follows- dyutakrida main haarane ke baad pandav baarah varsh tak vanvaas main or ek varsh tak agyatavaas main vyateet karne kii shart puri karke waapas laute
 When he asked for his share of the kingdom from the Kauravas, Duryodhana declined
 kauravon or pandavon ke bich samjhaute ke praytn prarambh hue
 When this work was not done easily, Yudhishthira requested Sri Krishna to be his messenger for the purpose of making an alliance with the Kauravas in place of the destructive pure
 doot ke rup main unke hastinapur pahunchane par dhritaraashta ne unke swaagat kaa puraa prabandh kiya
 Sri Krishna went first to Kunti, then to Duryadhan etc
 ve vidura ke ghar tehre, jahaan unhone suna ki kaurav yuddh kii puri taiyaari kar chuke hai or ve log shrikrishna kii koi baat maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai; atah shrikrishna kaa dautya karm vyarth ko jayega
 Nevertheless he attended the Rajya Sabha with Vidur on the second day
 jab sab sabhasad yathasthaan baith gayi tab unhone dhritaraashta ko bataaya ki ve pandavon kii ore se kauravon se shaanti-vaarta karne aaye hai
 Sri Krishna proposed to give scope to the Pandavas in front of Duryodhana
 kaurav-pramukh bhishma, dron, vidura or dhritaraashta ne bhi duryodhana se pandavon ko daay bhaag de dene ko kaha, kintu durvinith duryodhana pandavon ko sui kii nonk ke baraabar kii bhoomi dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 He rejected the proposal of the treaty and asked him to leave the decision on the war itself
 vah cruddh hokar gandhari kii baat ansuni karke apane bhaiyon ke saath rajsabha se chalaa gaya
 Somehow on the request of Vidur, he again came to the Rajya Sabha
 punah usne shakuni, karn, duhshasan aadi se shrikrishna ko bandi banane ko kaha
 Somehow Dhritarashtra stopped him from this blasphemous act
 tab shrikrishna ne apana virat rup darshaya, jise shrikrishna kii krupa se andhe dhritaraashta, dron, bhishma, vidura or sanjay ne dekha
 Dhritarashtra apologized by placing his head at the feet of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ke paas waapas lautakar shrikrishna ne apni sandhivaarta kii asafalataa kaa varnan kiya
 In 'dootavakya', the poet has presented the same story of Mahabharata in a different way - the narrator who entered after Nandipatha was going to tell something as soon as he heard some words from the background
 usase gyaat hota he ki kauravon or pandavon main virodh ho gaya he or usee ke liye duryodhana kii ajna se uskaa sevak mantrashala kii vyavastha kar rahaa he
 Duryodhana appears on the stage as a heroic king
 vah sab aamantirat raajaaon or sabhaasadon ko sammaan ke saath sabhabhavan main baithaata he
 On the suggestion of Shakuni among all the councilors, Bhishma Senapati is elected
 isi samay kanchukeey baadaraayan pandavon ke shivi se doot ke rup main purushottam narayan ke aane kii soochna detaa he
 Duryodhana gets angry when he calls Shri Krishna as Narayan and asks Kanchukiya to say that a messenger named Keshav has come
 baad main vah upasthit raajaaon se poochta he ki krishna ke saath hamaara vyavhaar kaisaa hona chahie
 On hearing his respectful reply, he gets excited again and says that he is interested in capturing Krishna
 vah ajna detaa he ki keshav ke aane par koi bhi sammanarth apane asana se nahin uthegaa
 If anyone does this, he will be punished hard by the state
 swayan apane ko uthne se rokane ke liye vah baadaraayan se draupadi ke keshaharan kaa chitrapat mangavata he jise dekhtaa hua vah baitha rah sake
 Looking at the picture, he portrays the gestures of Draupadi, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, nakula-sahadeva, Shakuni, Acharya etc
 duryodhana ke kehane par kanchukeey doot krishna ko lene jaataa he
 Duryadhan asks Karna to be ready to listen to Krishna's soft words like women
 shrikrishna ke sabha main pravesh karte hi sabhi raja or kshatriya ghabadaa kar khadey ho jate hai
 Duryodhana also falls from his posture
 vasudev krishna sabhi raajaaon ko sammaan ke saath asana grahan karne kaa anurodh karte hai
 Seeing Draupadi's hairstyle and clothes drawing near Duryodhana, he heartily praises him that Duryadhan considers his valor due to foolishness to insult his captives
 aupchaarik kushalvarta ke anantar vasudev pandavon kaa sandesh sunaate hai ki ‘jo hamaara daybhag he, vah hamen milanaa chahie
 'duryodhana says that' Pandu got the Munishap, so the Pandavas are Devaputra, then how are our brothers? What right in his father's wealth? ' Vasudev asks Duryodhana how Dhritarashtra can also inherit the wealth of his father Vichitravirya? Duryodhana Vasudev is also rebuked for his childish acts
 shrikrishna kii tarksangat spashtvaadita se duryodhana or baukhala jaataa he
 He states that the kingdom is not an object to be received in alms
 vah rajya kaa trinmaatr bhi pandavon ko nahin degaa
 Vasudev warns him that due to you the entire Kuru dynasty will be destroyed soon
 ve jane lagate hai
 Duryodhana orders them to be arrested
 vasudev vishwaroop main prakat ho jate hai
 Duryoghan becomes more confused by his illusion and walks out
 vasudev krodhit hokar sudarshan chakra ko bulaate hai, vah maanav rup main prakat hota he
 Vasudeva is composed by Sudarshan's explanation
 anantar vasudev ke divyastra sharrg dhanush, coumodaki gada, paanchajnya shankh or nandak asi ek ke baad ek pravesh karte hai or sudarshan ke samajhane par laut jate hai
 Then Vishnuvahana Garuda enters
 bhagavan ko shaantarosh jaanakar sabhi apane-apane dham laut jate hai
 Later, Sri Krishna also starts returning to the Pandavas' camp, that is when the old Dhritarashtra enters
 dhritaraashta vasudev ke pairon par girakar putron ke aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangate hai
 The Envoy metaphor ends with Bharatavakya
 mahabharat kii mul katha se dootvaakya kii katha kii tulana karne par hamen mahakavi bhaas dwaara kiye gayi kuch moulik parivartan dikhaayi dete hai
 In the Mahabharata, Dhritarashtra is the king, he sits on the throne when Krishna comes as the messenger, while Duryodhana is depicted as the king in the envoy
 dootvaakya main draupadi ke kesh or vastra khinchne se sambandhit chitra kavi kii udbhaavna he
 In the Mahabharata, no special attempt is made to imprison Shri Krishna, while the attempt to bind him is shown in the envoy
 dootvaakya main divya ayudhon or vaahan garud kii maanav rup main avatarana kavi kii apni kalpana he
 The poet has made the lengthy conversation between Sri Krishna and Duryodhana very satirical and interesting
 in sab naveentaaon se hi dootvaakya kii katha or samvaad sundar or prabhaavshaalee ho gayi hai
 The name of this metaphor, 'dootavakya', is completely meaningful because it is based on Sri Krishna's sentence, ie, Sandhi - offer
 gwaala yaa bootes taramandal khagoleey gole ke uttari bhaag main dikhne vaala ek taramandal he

 It usually contains 60% copper, 20% nickel and 20% zinc
 ise 'german silver', nayi chaandi, nikal pital, electrum aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is called 'nickel silver' because it looks like silver
 kintu isamen chaandi nahin hota
 The name 'german' has come up because it was developed by German metallurgists in the 19th century

 apane bade bhai or raja kii aajnaaon ko praapt kiye bina bhi vah swayan bhoomi aadi kaa daan dene laga or anek daanpatr apane naam se usne prachaarit kiye
 These tendencies of Dhruva led to the suspicion of Govind II towards him, it was somewhat unexpected and he was removed from his post

 Ultimately, he dies in a hospital, and he may be buried in a public crematorium
 manushya kitna hi roodhiwaadee kyon na ho, vah apana din pratidin kaa jivan uparyukt yaa anya kai saarvajanik sevaaon ke sambandh main sarkaar ke nirnay se bandhaa hua paata he
 With the emergence of public administration as a field of study parallel to political science and emerging as a separate academic department, public policy was recognized in the 1960s as a subfield of study under political science
 ‘saarvajanik niti‘ sawarjanik maamalon ke prati sarkaar ke ruukh kaa saiddhanthik adhyayan karti he
 The emphasis of political science is on theory, and the emphasis of aesthetic policy is on its application
 raajnneeti vigyaan main vyavahaaravaadi kranti ke parinamswaroop adhiktar raajnneetik vaigyanikon ke liye ‘praasangikta‘ adhyayan kaa kendriya vishay ho gaya he
 Political scientists, especially in the United States, realized in the latter part of the sixth decade that the presence before society was an urgent need to solve many crisis problems
 udhaaharan ke liye, vietnam main america kaa uljhaav america janata ke liye daraavna anubhav tha
 The worldwide arms race put the world's existence in great danger
 nrijaateey samasyaayen kai samaajon ke liye badi chunauti ban gai hai
 Decisions taken by superpowers like the United States and Russia can result in war or peace, economic progress or end, nuclear demolition or peaceful co-existence
 raajnneeti vaigyanikon ne saarvajanik niti ke sambhavit khataron tathaa sakaaratmak laabhon ko mahasoos kiya he or is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki saarvajanik nitiyon ke adhyayan or vishleshan kii atyadhik aavashyaktaa he
 Governments can make several policies and provide funds to meet these objectives
 to bhi, keval kanoon banane tathaa bajet paarit karne maatr se siddh nahin ho sakegaa ki abhisht uddeshy praapt ho jaavenge
 There is always a big gap between objectives and achievements in Indian plans
 un asafalataaon ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan karnaa hoga
 To be expressed in simple terms, public policy is the sum of the activities of governments, whether the government acts on its own or acts through an agent
 saarvajanik niti kaa nagarikon ke jivan par prabhaav padataa he
 Whatever the government likes to do or not, there is a public policy
 raajnneeti vaigyanik david easton ne saarvajanik niti ke ‘‘sampoorn samaaj ke liye badi maatra main dhanrashi kaa adhikadhik vinogen‘‘ ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 Political scientists Heinz Eula and Kenneth Prewitt give another definition of public policy
 unke anusaar niti ko ‘sthaayee nirmaan‘ ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Public policy analysis is often done in the light of the consequences of a policy decision or policy statement
 nitigat parinaam saarvajanik nitiyon kii saakaar abhivyakti he
 In simple words, the policy results reflect what the government actually does
 saarvajanik nitiyaan kisi raajnneetik pranali kaa samgr chithran karti he
 The circulated area of public policy is very wide and its reach and coverage are large enough
 maanav jivan ke kisi bhi pahalu par gaur karen, ham kisi ek yaa anya niti se mukti nahin mil sakati
 From the birth of the child to the death of man and whenever the dead body is brought to the crematorium for the last rites, there is a policy that we have to face and we take advantage of
 bachche kii shiksha, rogon se bachaav, behatar evam poshtik bhojan, achche libaas, sarvottam ucch shiksha, kaam kii sambhaavnaayen, behatar vetan, paryaapt awaas grih va anya suvidhaayen, rashtiy va anterrashtiy khataron se suraksha or prakritik aapadaaon se bachaav kuch aisi nitiyaan hai jinke bare main ham sugamawa se charchaa karte hai
 Keeping in view the interdependence of other national powers, public policies of a political system also include policies related to import-export and good and friendly relations with other nations
 saarvajanik niti ke kshetra evam pahunch ko shabdon main simit karnaa yaa paribhaashit karnaa nishchay hi kathin he
 Public policy encompasses a large part of its activities that are consistent with development policy
 saamaajik-aarthik vikaas, samanta, swatantraaa yaa aatmanirnay yaa kaaryakalapon ke maarg darshan jaise bade siddhaton ko vikaas niti yaa rashtriya lakshya ke rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Public policy can be narrow when it involves a specific activity such as family planning
 sawarjanik niti desh ke sabhi logon par yaa logon ko ek simit varg par lagu kii ja sakati he
 Public policy can be in a positive or negative form
 sakaaratmak rup main yah kisi vishisht samasya ko hal karne ke liye pratyaksh sarkari kaarywahi ke rup main ho sakati he
 On the other hand, it includes in its negative form no action by the Government servant, on a matter about which a government order was required
 sawarjanik niti, is prakaar se, ek vaidhanik utpeedak gun rakhti he jise naagarikgan vidhik rup se uchit maanate hai
 For example, taxes must be paid otherwise one must be willing to risk jail travel or fines
 saarvajanik nitiyon kii yah vidhik rup se utpeedak sawarjanik sanghathanon ko nijee sanghathanon se bhinn banaati he
 In a democratic system, government is nothing but a reflection of the whole society
 sarkaar ke paas prashasan ke anek kshetra, yatha-shiksha, pratiraksha, vitt aadi hote hai
 The government formulates policies for each region or for a specific region, commonly known as public policies
 yadi niti dderghaavadhi he to uddeshy bhi usee hisaab se nirdhaarit hoga
 For example, long-term objectives will be taken into account in the defense policy
 ye dderghaavadhi uddeshy utkrisht bharti, upyukt prashikshan, uchit vyavastha aadi ke ho sakate hai
 Similarly, the objectives of policies related to education, health, finance and family welfare etc
 will also be determined on a long-term basis
 kuch samasyaain sanyogvash utpann ho jaati he
 In such cases policies are formulated with short-term objectives
 udhaaharan ke liye, yuddh ke samay blike out kaa aadesh diya jaataa he or seemaa-kshetron main najadik ke gaanvon se logon ko hataaya jaataa he
 Similarly, if violence erupts, then the police restores the law and justice system there on the basis of short-term objectives
 saarvajanik niti kii samgr samaj ke liye, saarvajanik niti paridrishyon evam paryaavarniya shaktiyon ke madhya ke sangyojan kaa vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 There is a great need to understand the various dimensions of public policy
 vastav main aadhunik vishwa main, saarvajanik nitiyaan maanav jati kii niyati kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 The welfare and economic salvation of human beings depends on the mastery of public policy
 yadi akushal nitiyaan saal dar saal jari rakhi gayi to ve nitiyaan logon ke aarthik str kaa hraas karne main yogadan degi
 Unskilled policies have to be abandoned
 sahi lakshyon ke saath yahi saarvajanik nitiyon ko apnaanaa hoga

 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher
 unhone ishwar ke bare main koi upadesh nahin diya, parantu phir bhi baad main log unhen dharmik guru maanane lage
 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him

 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes

 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he

 Among all the Puranas, Shiva Purana has the status of being the most important
 isamen bhagwaan shiv ke vividh roopon, avtaron, jyotirlingon, bhakton or bhakthi kaa vishad varnan kiya gaya he
 'shiva Purana' is related to Shaivism
 is puraana main pramukh rup se shiv-bhakthi or shiv-mahima kaa prachaar-prasar kiya gaya he
 In almost all the Puranas, Shiva is described as an idol of sacrifice, penance, Vatsalya and compassion
 kaha gaya he ki shiv sahaj hi prasann ho jane vaale evam manovanchit fal dene vaale hai
 But in the 'shiva Purana', highlighting the life character of Shiva, it is specifically mentioned about their way of life, marriage and the origin of their sons

 Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was an Indian teacher and leader who introduced modern education for the Muslims of India
 unhone mohammadan anglo-oriental kalege kii sthapana kii jo baad main viksit hokar aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay bana
 His efforts marked the beginning of the Aligarh Revolution, in which Muslim intellectuals and leaders involved worked to separate Indian Muslims from Hindus and laid the foundation of Pakistan
 sayed ahamed khan east india company main kaam karte hue kaafii prasiddh hue
 Sayyid Ahmad remained loyal to the British Empire during the first Indian independence struggle of 1857 and saved the lives of many Europeans
 baad main us sangram ke vishay main unhone ek kitaab likhi: asabaab-e-baghaavat-e-hind, jisamen unhone british sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana kii
 He was the most influential Muslim leader of his time
 unka vichaar tha ki bharat ke musalamaanon ko british sarkaar ke prati vafaadaar nahin rahanaa chaiye
 He insisted on making Urdu a collective language of Indian Muslims
 saiyad ahamed khaan kaa janm 17 oktober 1817 main dilli ke saadaat khandaan main hua tha
 He was fond of reading and writing since childhood and his mother had more influence than father
 maan ke kushal paalan poshan or unase mili sanskaron kaa asar sar saiyad ke baad ke dinon main spasht dikhaa, jab vah saamaajik utthan ke kshetra main aae
 After the father's death at the age of 22, the family faced financial difficulties and had to earn a living only after a little education
 unhone 1830 i
 main east india company main lipic ke pad par kaam karnaa shuru kiya, kintu 1841 i
 main mainpuri main up-nyaayadhish kii yogyata hasil kii or vibhinn sthanon par nyaayik vibhaagon main kaam kiya
 However, despite being in the highest rank, he spent all his life in Fatehali
 1857 kii mahakranti or uski asafalataa ke dushprinaam unhone apni aankhon se dekha
 His house was destroyed, close relatives were killed, his mother was saved in a horse stables for a week after saving her life
 apane parivaar kii is barbaadi ko dekhakar unka man vichlit ho gaya or unke dilo-dimaag main rashtrabhakti kii lahar karavatein lene lageen
 Troubled by this uneasiness, he decided to leave India and settle in Egypt
 angrezon ne unako apni ore karne ke liye mir sadiq or mir rustam ali ko unke paas bheja or unhe talluka jahanabad dene kaa laalach diya
 This was an opportunity that they could be trapped in their web
 ve dhanadhy kii zindagi basar kar sakate the, lekin ve bahut hi budhimaan or samajhadaar vyakti the
 He rejected greed at that time and considered it better to adopt patriotism
 baad main unhone yah mahasoos kiya ki agar bharat ke musalamaanon ko is kothri se nahin nikaala gaya to ek din hamaari qaom tabah or barbaad ho jaaegi or vah kabhi bhi uth na sakegi
 Therefore, he changed his intention to go to Egypt and started taking the torch of welfare and existence towards his community and country
 yah sach he ki unhone gair faujee angrezon ko apane ghar main panaah di, lekin unke samarthak bilkul na the, balki vah islamic shiksha va samskruti ke chaahane vaale the
 His vision was well aware of the conspiracy of the British
 unhen maaloom tha ki angrezi hukumat bharat par sthapit ho chuki he or unhone unhen haraane ke liye shaikshik maidan ko behatar samajha
 Therefore, through his excellent articles, he tried to inculcate the spirit of education and culture in the community so that no one can dominate our demos in the educational field
 musalmaan unhen kufr kaa fatwa dete rahe baavzood iske qaom ke dushman banakar yaa bigadakar na mili balki narmi se unhen samajhane kii koshish karte rahe
 They knew very well that this demoness was there, so regardless of what they said, they kept trying to reach their destination
 aaj muslim qaom ye baat sweekaar karti he ki sar saiyad ahamed khan ne qaom ke liye kya kuch nahin kiya
 Sir Syed's tradition in Muslim politics emerged as the Muslim League
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke virudhd unka propaganda tha ki congress hindu aadhipaty party he or propaganda azaad-purv bharat ke muslimon main jivit rahaa
 He remained away from the Congress with few exceptions and even he did not participate in the freedom struggle
 isamen koi aashcharya kii baat nahin ki british-bharat ke muslim bahul rajyon masalan-bengal, punjab main lagbhag sabhi swatantraaa senaanee hindu yaa sikh the

 Geomorphology scientists try to understand what is the reason behind what the landscape looks like, they try to find out the history and dynamics of the landforms and to explore land observations, physical tests and numerical modeling
 Forecast future changes through a combination
 bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa adhyayan bhugol, bhuvigyaan, bhuganit, ejineering bhuvigyaan, puraatatv or bhu-takneekee ejineering main kiya jaataa he or ruchi kaa yah vyapak aadhaar is vishay ke tahat anusandhan style or ruchiyon kii vyapak vividhta ko utpann karata he
 The Earth's surface develops in response to a combination of natural and anthropological processes, and responds with a balance between the processes that add and remove materials
 aisi prakriyaayein sthaan or samay ke vibhinn paimaanon par kaary kar sakati hai
 On the broadest scale, the landscape is formed through tectonic uplift and volcanoes
 anaachhadan, kataav or vyapak barbaadi se hota he, jo aise talachat kaa nirmaan karata he jiskaa parivahan or jamaav bhu-drishy ke bheetar yaa tat se dur kahin anya sthaan par ho jaataa he
 On a progressively smaller scale, a similar concept applies, where unit landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive and subtraction processes
 aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, kisi grah ke sataha par saamagree ke pravaah ke apsaran kaa adhyayan he or isliye talachat vigyaan ke saath nikat rup se sambhddha he, jise samaan rup se us pravaah ke abhisaran ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Geomorphic processes are influenced by tectonics, climate, ecology, and human activities, and equally many of these factors may be influenced by ongoing development on the Earth's surface, for example, through isostasis or mountain precipitation

 This section provides a brief outline of some of the major figures and events of their development
 bahujna chini vaigyanik or rajaneta shen kuo bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek siddhant khojane vaala shaayad sabase praarambhik vyakti tha
 It is based on his observation of a marine fossil shell in a geological layer of a mountain hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean
 jab usne chattan ke kataav khand kii taraf dwikpaati khol ko ek kshaitij vistaar main chalate dekha, to usne siddhant nikaala ki yah chattan kabhi praha-aitihaasik kaal ke samudri tat kaa sthaan thi jo kai sadiyon ke dauraan saikadon mile kii duuri par sthanantarit ho gaya
 He concluded that the land was reorganized differently due to soil erosion of the mountains and deposition of silt
 aisa usne tab kaha jab usne vanjau ke nikat taihang parvat or yandang parvat ke ajeeb prakritik apradan ko dekha
 Furthermore, when he found the ancient vulcanised bamboo underground underground in the arid, northern climatic zone of Yanzhou, what is now modern-day Yanan, Zansi province, he proposed the theory of gradual climate change over the course of several centuries
 jiomorfology shabd kaa pehla prayog sambhawatah german bhashaa main hua tha, jab yah lauman ke 1858 ke kaaryon main chapa
 Keith Tinckler suggests that when John Wesley Powell and W
J
 When mcgee used the term at the International Geological Conference of 1891, it became common usage in English, German and French
 ek aarambhik lokapriy bhu-akritik model bhugolic chakra yaa kataav kaa chakra tha jise 1884 or 1899 ke bich wiliam morris davis dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This cycle was inspired by the principles of homogeneity that James Hutton first proposed
 ghati jaisi akritiyon ke sambandh main, ekarupathavaad ne is chakra ko aise anukram main chitrit kiya jisamen ek nadi kisi ghati ko adhik se adhik gaharaa katati he, lekin phir paksh ghaatiyon kaa kataav us ilaake ko antat punah samtal kar detaa he or oonchai ko kam kar detaa he, jiske baad utthan us chakra ko phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 Decades after Davis developed his theory, many studies of geomorphology attempted to fit his ideas into this mold for landscape development on a large scale, and are often referred to today as "davisian"
 davis ke vichaaron ko kaaphi had tak aaj paar kar liya gaya he, mukhya rup se unamem purvanumaan kshamta or gunatmak prakruti kii kami kii vajah se, lekin ve is vishay ke itihaas main ek atyant mahatvapurn vyakti bane hue hai
 In the 1920s, Walter Pank developed an alternative model to Davis's model, assuming that topographic evolution could be better defined as a balance between continuous processes of uplift and denudation, not Davis's single uplift
 As decay occurring after
 haalanki, apekshaakrit yuvavastha main hi uski asamyik mrityu kii vajah se, davis ke saath vivaad or unke kaaryon ke angreji anuwaad kii kami se unke vichaaron ko kai varshon tak vyapak manyata nahin mili
 These authors attempted to give the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface a more generalized, globally relevant basis than before
 19veen sadi ke aarmabhik kaal main, lekhakon ne - vishesh rup se europe main - bhu-akritiyon ke liye sthaneey jalwaayu ko shrey diya or vishesh rup se himachhadan or perigleshial prakriyaaon ko
 In contrast, Davis and Pank both attempted to emphasize the importance of landscape development over time and the generality of Earth's surface processes over different landscapes under different conditions
 jabaki penk or davis or unke anuyaayi mukhyatah pashchimi europe main lekhan or adhyayan kar rahe the, bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek anya, mote taur par pruthak skool 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main sanyukt rajya america main viksit hua
 Following the pioneering works of Grove Carl Gilbert in the early 20th century, a group of natural scientists, geologists and hydraulic engineers, including Ralph Elgar Bagnold, John Hack, Luna Leopold, Thomas Medoc, and Arthur Stroller, on elements of landscape shapes Started research such as river and hill slopes, for which they arranged, direct, outperformed their aspects Ratmk took measurements and investigating the scaling of these measurements

 Today, the field of geomorphology covers a very wide range of different perspectives and interests
 aadhunik shodhakarta maatraatmak "siddhant" nikaalane kaa prayaas karte hai jo prithvi kii sataha kii prakriyaaon ko niyantrit karte hai, lekin samaan rup se, ve prayek bhudrishy or vaataavaran kii vishistataa ko pahachaanate hai, jinamein ye prakriyaayein sanchalit hoti hai
 Particular important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include: aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, paraspar sambandhit prakriyaaon ke maatraatmak vishleshan par kendrit he
 Modern advances in geochemistry, especially cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry and fission track dating, have enabled us to first measure the rates at which geomorphic processes occur on a geologically relevant timeline
 usee samay, adhik sateek bhautik maapan takanic ke upyog se, jisamen shaamil he bhedatmak jeepies, duurastha rup mahasoos kiye gaye digital terren model or lager scanning takneekon ne in prakriyaaon ke hote hue unke parimann or adhyayan kii anumati di he
 Computer simulation and modeling can then be used to understand how these processes work together and over time
 bhugarbheey rup se praasangik adhikansh prakriyaaon ko yaa to apradankaree, sthaanantaran kaari mana ja saktaa he yaa phir donon kaa sangyojan
 jamaav prakriyaaon ko adhiktar avsaad-vigyaan ke kshetra ke bheetar mana jaataa he, lekin aksar bhu-akruti vigyaan ke hisse ke rup main bhi samajha jaataa he
 Weathering is the chemical and physical disintegration of Earth's material caused by contact with atmospheric or near surface agents
 sataha ke nazadik in parivartanon ke utpaadon ko baad main kataav ke vibhinn karkon dwaara dur le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The nature of the processes investigated by a geologist is strongly dependent on the landscape or topography involved in the investigation, and the interest of the time and length line
 haalanki, nimnlikhit gaiyr-vistrut suchi inamen se kuch ke saath jude bhudrishy tatwon kii ek jhalak pradaan karti he
 The primary surface processes responsible for most topographic forms include wind, wave, chemical dissolution, mass destruction, groundwater activity, surface water flow, ice action, tectonics, and volcanoes
 anya adhik gambhir bhu-akritik prakriyaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he perigleshial prakriyaayein, namak kii madhyasthata vaali kriya, yaa parloukik prabhaav
 Rivers and streams are not only carriers of water but also sediment
 pani, jab sataha par pravaahman rahata he, to vah talachhaton kaa istemaal karne main sakasham hota he or inhen neeche kii taraf baha le jaataa he, yaa to tal bhaar athwa prasupt bhaar ke rup main yaa phir vighatit bhaar ke rup main
 The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and the discharge of the river
 nadiyaan nae chattaanon kaa apradan karne or nae talachat banane main bhi sakasham hai, apane tal dwaara or aasapaas pahari dhalaanon ke saath yugman dwaara
 is tarah, nadiyon ko gaiyr-himandeey vaataavaran main bade paimaane ke bhudrishy ke liye aadhaar str kii sthapana karne ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Rivers are important sources of exposure to various landscape elements
 jab nadiyaan sthalakritiyon se hote hue pravaahit hoti hai, ve aam taur par aakaar main badi ho jaati hai or anya nadiyon ke saath mil jaati hai
 The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system and is often dendritic, but may also assume other forms depending on the underlying geology and local topography
 vaiudh prakriyaayein hawa kii gatividhi se sambandhit he or adhik vishisht rup se, prithvi kii sataha ko aakaar dene kii hava kii kshamta se
 hawaaen chizon kaa apradan, parivahan or jamaav kar sakati hai or ye hawaaen un kshetron main adhik prabhavi hoti hai jahaan vanaspati viral hote he or talachat kii paryaapt aapurti hoti he
 Although water and large flows use more material than air in most environments, aeration processes are important in dry environments, deserts
 mitti, regolyth or pathar, gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat rengte hue, ludhakte hue, behate hue, girte hue nichi kii taraf jate hai
 Such massive breakdowns occur on terrestrial and slopes and have been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Eeapetus
 pahaad ke dhalaanon par chal rahi prakriyaayein dhalaan ke sataha kii sansthiti ko badal sakati hai, jo badale main un prakriyaaon kii daron ko parivartit kar sakati he
 Slopes that deepen to a delicate state are able to quickly release large amounts of material, making the sloping process an important element of landscape in tectonically active areas
 prithvi par, jaivik prakriyaayein jaise ki khudaai yaa tree thro kuch dhalaani prakriyaaon kii daron ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Glaciers, which are geographically limited, are effective factors for landscape change
 ghati main neeche kii taraf dhire-dhire jate barf kii gatividhi neeche kii chattan kaa gharshan karti he or use ukhaad detii he
 Friction produces fine sediment, called glacial flour
 himand ke samaapt ho jane ke baad uske dwaara parivahan kiye gaye malbe ko moren kaha jaataa he
 Glacial erosion is attributed to U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys formed by the river
 himand kii prakriya jis tarah se anya bhudrishy tatwon ke saath sampark karti he, vishesh rup se dhalaani or nadi kii prakriyaaon ke saath, vah plio-plistosin bhudrishy vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he or uske talachat kai oonchi pahari ke vaataavaran main milte hai
 Environments that have been snow-capped relatively recently but are no longer can still show higher landscape change rates than landscapes that have never been snow-capped
 gaiyr-himand bhu-akritik prakriyaayein jinhen tis par bhi purv himachhadan dwaara anukulit kiya gaya he unhen parahimanad prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he
 This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by the formation or melting of ice or frost
 bhu-akruti vigyaan par vivartanik prabhaav lakhon saal se lekar ek minute yaa usase kam ke paimaane kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 The effect of tectonics on the landscape largely depends on the design of the underlying rocky bedrock that governs what type of local morphology the tectonics will give
 bukamp, minuton ke andar, vistrut bhu-bhaag ko jalplavit kar sakate hai or ne ardrapradeshon ko janm de sakate hai
 Isostatic rebound can result in significant changes over hundreds or thousands of years and allows additional erosion of the mountain chain, as larger portions are removed from the chain and uplift of the tropics
 dirghakaalik plate vivartanik gatishiltaa, lakhon varshiya jeevankaal vaale orogenic katibandh, vishaal parvat maalaon ko ubharti he, jo nadi or pahari dhalaan kii ucch dar kii prakriyaaon kaa centre hoti he or is prakaar dirghakaalik avsaad utpaadan karti he
 Characteristics of deep crust dynamics, such as plumes and non-lamination of the lower lithosphere, are also believed to play an important role in the large-scale evolution of the Earth's topography in the long term
 donon hi isostacy ke madhyam se utthan ko prerit kar sakate hai, kyonki garam, kam ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaane, dharti ke andar apekshaakrit thandi, adhik ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaanon ko visthapit kar detii hai
 Volcanic and volcanic igneous processes can have a significant impact on geomorphology
 jwalamukhi kii ghatana bhu-drishy kaa navinikaran karti he or jameen kii puraani sataha ko lava or tephra se dhak detii he or piroclostic saamagree ko chodta he or nadiyon ko nae raaston par agrasar karti he
 The cone formed by detonation also creates substantial new topography, on which other surface processes can perform their work
 lava kii upsatahi gatividhi bhi bhu-akruti vigyaan main ek bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The melting below the surface can cause inflation and deflation of the ground surface and the partially molten crust layer beneath Tibet has been contributed to control the landscape of the Tibetan plateau spanning thousands of kilometers
 bhu-akritiyon ke saath jeevon kaa sampark yaa jaev-bhu-akritik prakriyaayein kai roopon kii ho sakati hai or shaayad sthaliy bhu-akritik pranali ke liye samgr rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn he

 unchi-nichi, parvatiy athwa pankil bhoomi ko paar kar niyat sthaan par saamagree pahunchaane ke liye akashiya rajjumarg adwitiya saadhan he
 They are used a lot to carry raw materials from one place to another in factories and construction dams
 rajjumarg do prakaar ke hote hai : ekal rajju tathaa dvirajju 
 a single rope has only a single string, which keeps on running continuously
 yah apane saath khaali yaa bhare hue dolon ko apane gantavy sthaan par le jaati he
 a dole is tied with its carrier in the rope
 ispaat ke ek kankal yaa attalak par rajju tiki rahati he, jisamen dol apane vaahak sahit lathi ke phanson dwaara bandhaa rahata he
 The rope goes on continuously and carries the bags with it
 rajjumarg ke donon chhoron par gumti hui ghiraniyaan rahati hai, jinpar rajju chadhi rahati he
 Figure b shows the loading location
 prayek chor par ek apnayan patari rahati he, jisapar bhaar ladane yaa khaali karne ke liye dol chadh jaataa he
 When the work is complete, the dole is then pushed onto the rope
 apnayan patari tathaa rajju kii sthiti main is prakaar kaa prabandh rahata he ki dol ko ek se duusare par bhejne main badi sugamawa hoti he or rajju par ranch maatr bhi jhatka nahin padataa; yah rajju ke tikaoo hone ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 If the ropeway is longer, a dividing station is made every three or four miles, where the doles leave the first rope and their wheels climb to the stationary tracks
 tab ve duusare bhaag kii rajju par chadhane ke liye aage kii ore thel die jate hai
 If there is a need for directionality in the ropeway, a platform is made at the site of the transformation with two horizontal pulleys
 rajju in ghiraniyon par se hokar jaati he or saralata se uski disha badal jaati he
 The rope remains intact by wiring steel wires
 uske chunaav main nimnlikhit baton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he : How much burden will you bear in each dose
 boj ladane tathaa utaarne ke liye kitna samay milegaa or What will be the velocity of the ropeway? inhen baton par vichaar karke rajjumarg kii kaaryakshmata niyat kii jaati he, arthath yah sthir kiya jaataa he ki prati ghanta kitna boj vahan ho sakegaa
 Usually the time to load the load is from twenty to thirty seconds
 aavashyaktaanusaar ek yaa isse adhik dol ek saath bhare ja sakate hai
 The velocity of the rope also depends on the slope of the ropeway
 saadharantaya isaki chaal do se paanch mile prati ghanta rakhi jaati he, kintu yah saat mile prati ghanta tak bhi kii ja sakati he
 But it should be remembered that the higher the speed, the greater will be the chance of shock of change in it
 atev adhik duuri tathaa adhik kshamta ke liye dvirjjupranali kaa hi upyog uchit hota he
 Thus the thickness of the rope is dependent on the distance between the serial attorneys, the amount of maximum load on the rope between them and the strength of the rope according to the thickness per inch
 motaai main rajju 1⁄2 inch' se 11⁄2 eench tak ke vyas kii hoti he
 The rope is made so much at first that its center at the center of finance is 1 / 20 of maximum finance
 isliye achal boj, vaayu kii daab, jhatkon or companon ke prabhaav aadi, ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi rajjumarg kaa antim rup nishchit kiya jaataa he
 Fixed load, pressure etc
 can be taken as 25 percent of the total load
 rajju ko purvanishchit gati ke anusaar chalaane ke liye ingine kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or uski shakti rajju kii dhaal par nirbhar he
 Sometimes the loading station is so much higher than the unloading station that the gravity-laden dowels not only descend themselves, but the surplus power generated from them can also be helpful in other tasks

 Sa'al / 12 horsepower is required for friction on the atalics and on the rope, where sa is the capacity of the ropeway per hour per ton and the length of the passage is in miles

 The construction of the stools takes care of other things such as their gradual distance, such as dohari rajjupranali main ek maargdarshi rajju rahati he, jo dolvahakon kaa boj sanbhaalati he or unhen thik maarg se vichlit nahin hone detii
 The second rope keeps moving and dragging the balls, as shown in Figure 4
 ghaseetanevaali rajju thik usee prakaar kii hoti he jaisi ekal-rajju-pranali main
 It is very difficult to tell which system should be chosen in these two systems
 dvirjjupranali main aarambh main adhik kharch avashya baithta he, par adhik duuri tak tathaa adhik dhaal par adhik boj ke yatayaat ke liye yahi pranali adhik upyukt thaharti he
 The single-rope system is simpler and is relatively inexpensive for light and temporary tasks
 parvatiy pradeshon main railmargon main adhik se adhik teen pratishat dhaal rakhi ja sakati he, parantu rajjumarg 40 pratishat dhaal tak par kaam kar saktaa he
 If the difference between the two point planks in a mountainous region is 2,640 feet and they are two miles from each other, then work will be done by two miles of ropeway; But the length of the 2 percent gradient will have to be 20 miles
 phir, rail ke liye maarg ke behad naalon ko paar karne or sthaan-sthaan par pul, tatbandh tathaa pushtavan banane kii kathinaaiyaan bhi atyadhik ho sakati hai

 Of these, only one egg normally matures inside the Gryphian follicle every 20–21 days and enters the ovaries after about 10 hours after the termination of the mantle
 yadi iskaa is sthaan par nishechan nahin hota, to ye andanuyaheen nasht ho jaataa hai tathaa andashay main doosraa andanu paripakk / viksit hone lagata hai
 This cycle continues until the animal conceives
 is chakra ko hi mad chakra kehete hai
 In the ovary, the gryphon follicle in the ovary, which contains the testes of the egg, produces a hormone called estrogen, and not only hormones that cause heat symptoms in the animal
 graphian folical pashu ke madakal kii samaapti ke kuch samay baad fat jaataa hai tathaa is sthaan par ek anya rachana jise korampas lutium kehete hai, viksit hone lagati he

 Hui corpus dissolves luteum
 falswaroop progesteron hormone kaa bananaa band ho jaataa hai tathaa anya andanu kaa paripakkikaran shuru ho jaataa hai or kuch samay baad pashu pun: garmi main aa jaataa hai
 If the animal has been conceived during the time of fertilization and the egg has been fertilized successfully, then a special type of substance is produced from the embryo being fertilized on the 5th day, due to which the effect comes to the uterus
