 catherine mansfield :katherine Mansfield) newzealand mul kii atyadhik khyatipraapt aadhuniktaavaadi angreji kahanikar thi
 Katherine, the daughter of a banker father and a mother of a relatively narrow nature, was naturally natural
 paramparaagat rup se striyon kaa anishchit bhavishya vaala jivan usamen aarambh se hi vidroh kaa beej-vapan karte rahaa
 Due to not being able to give the required turn to his life, his nature remained unbalanced and life was chaotic
 aarambh main jivan kii kathorataaon ne uski rachanaaon ko bhi katutaa tathaa tikhe vyangy se purna banaaya
 For a long time she could not accept the justness of excellence and order in life
 kaaphi baad main chekhav ke prabhaav se usne lekhan ke saath lekhak ke jivan main bhi achchhai kaa mahatv samajha
 Catherine was a modernist storyteller and did not allow the emotional style of her compositions and the symbolism used to be as realistic as possible
 iske saath hi uski rachanaaon main aadyant vidyaman pathneeyata bhi atirikt vaishishty pradaan karti he
 Catherine Mansfield was born on 14 October 1888 in Wellington, New Zealand
 uskaa mul naam katholin mansfield boshamp tha
 Her father Harold Boshamp was a successful banker
 uski maan eni diar swabhaav vaali tathaa apane aap main simati rahane vaali mahila thim, parantu unheen kii putree catherine mansfield apni maan se sarvatha vipareet swabhaav vaali hui
 Katherine spent 6 years of her childhood in a village called Karori
 bachapan se hi use sarthak yaa nirarthak kuch na kuch likhte rahane kaa shauk tha
 At the tender age of 9, some of his writings were also published
 15 varsh kii aayu main hi usne vidrohi swabhaav kaa pehla parichay diya or parivaar kii ichha ke viruddh hathpurvak landan ke queens college main daakhila le liya
 Queens College was famous for its liberal education of women
 parantu, catherine ko 3 varsh baad hi apni ichha ke viruddh newjiland waapas lautnaa padaa
 Katherine was initially very fond of music and even when she returned to New Zealand she wanted to become a professional chelo-maestro, but her father did not approve of it
 1908 main apni antarang mitra ida baker kii sahaayta se vah pita ko rajikar england jane main safal hui or phir kabhi lautakar newjiland nahin aayi
 In London, Catherine became fully engaged in writing
 apni mathrubhumi se hameshaa ke liye dur ho jane ke baavjood uske lekhan main uski mathrubhumi kii awajahi hoti rahi
 Paradoxical behavior was Catherine's nature
 vah akasar kahati thi ki use england kii har cheez naapsand he
 On the other hand many of her contemporaries said that she was too "english"
 catherine kaa pehla pyaar garnet travel naamak yuva vaayalin vadak se hua tha, lekin kuch samay uparaant yah rishta tut gaya or usee aavesh main usne ek sangeet shikshak jorge bouden se vivaah kar liya
 The marriage did not last a day and Catherine left the next day
 kuch dinon tak ek opera mandali ke saath gumti rahane ke baad vah punah garnet ke paas laut gayi
 After some time she found herself pregnant and due to her poor health her mother took her to a sanatorium in Bavaria where she gave birth to a dead baby prematurely
 1910 main hi use gonoria ho gaya tha, jiske kaaran vah jivan bhar aswasth rahi
 In 1911, Catherine met Rhythm magazine editor John Middleton Murry
 jaldi hi donon main ghanishthata hui or mari catherine ke hi flats main rahane laga
 During this time, Katherine was also deeply friends with DH Lawrence and his wife Freida
 apane swabhaav kii asthirataa tathaa udignata ke kaaran jivan bhar catherine kaa kisi se lagaataar acha sambandh nahin rahaa
 There was always ups and downs in the relationship
 1918 ke aarambh main catherine ko tapedic kii beemaari ho gayi
 In the same year, he formally divorced George Baudan and married Mary
 1920 main vah france ke mento shahar main kiraye ke bangale main rahane lagi
 While there, he wrote many of his most successful stories
 lagaataar kharaab swasthya tathaa rog ke laailaaj ho jane se maatr 34 varsh kii aayu main 9 janvari 1923 ko phontenblo main catherine kaa dehanth ho gaya
 As mentioned, Catherine was free-spirited from the beginning
 16 saal kii umr main apni schuli dost ko likhe patr main uski swaabhaavik swatantraaa kii spasht jhalak milti he: main kis kadar chaahati hoon ki sabhi striyon kaa ek nishchit bhavishya ho-- kya tum nahin chaahati? baithe-baithe ek adad pati kaa intjaar karne ke khyaal se hi mujhe sakht nafrat he, lekin bahuteri ladkiyaan to aise hi sochati hai
 


 i smiled after reading about your wish that you want to make your fortune yourself - oh, how many times i have felt the same
 meri lalak he ki main paristhitiyon ko apane vash main kar sakun
 Loud slaps of love, breakup, marriage, and distance filled some acrimony and pungent satire in Katherine's nature
 isliye us daur main likhi us kii kahaniyaan tikhe vyangy se bhari he
 These stories are compiled in his first story collection In a German Pension published in 1911
 keval 23 varsh kii umr main prakashit is sangrah kii kahaniyon main german madhyavarg ke aadambar evam paakhand kaa majaak udaaya gaya he
 These stories were praised, and as an outspoken, quick-witted and flamboyant genius, Catherine was accepted into the literary world
 beesvin shatabdi ke tisare dashak main angreji kahani ne upanyaas se bhinn margon kaa anusaran kiya
 The main reason for this was the influence of the Russian writer Chekhov who focused not on the plot and strong characterization but on the creation of the atmosphere
 catherine chekhav se atyadhik prabhavit thi or ukraini lekhak es0 es0 kotelionski ke saath milakar usne baad main chekhav ke patron kaa roosi se angreji main anuwaad bhi kiya
 However, according to AC Ward, Catherine's stylistic resemblance was more than that of Chekhav
 unhone likhaa he ki catherine mansfield ke vishay main jitna us samay sochaa jaataa tha kadachit usase kam hi vah chekhav kii shishyaa thi, yadhyapi uski style kisi angrej lekhak kii apeksha chekhav kii style se adhik milti-julati thi
 Much later, from the life of Chekhav, he also realized that the life of a good writer must be good and he tried as much as possible; But before that, due to his unstable and unbalanced nature, he faced great crises and also caused great turmoil
 middlaton mari se bhi sambandh banate-bigadate rahaa or 1915 main ek baar use chhod kar vah bohemian francisi lekhak or patrkaar francis carco se yuddh kshetra main milane ke baad usee ke ghar main rahane bhi chali gayi thi
 This love affair was brief and it was on this background that he wrote his story An Indiscreet Journey
 catherine apane chote bhai lesley se bahut snehabhav rakhti thi
 She was deeply distressed after she joined the British Army in World War i and was killed in Belgium in October 1915, and her pain in the novel 'the Elo', written on her family background, manifested as a deep sensation
 1917 main varjeenia woolf dwaara prakaashan hetu kahani maangane par usne isi upanyaas kii kathavstu ko ek lambii kahani ke rup main dhaal diya, jo uski suprasiddh lambii kahani prelude ke rup main saamne aayi
 Contrary to Catherine's fears, the story was well praised
 isamen nihit saghan evam sajiv bhaavnaatmakataa ke saath pratikatmakataa tathaa yatharthwaad kii sahavartita kaaphi prashansaneey siddh hui
 The novelist 'rebecca West' accepted it as a work of genius
 vastutah uski style saavdhaneepurvak sugathit parantu bhaavnaatmak thi
 In addition, he had the extraordinary ability to understand children and unhappy and fractious-hearted people
 mansfield ke rachanaatmak jivan kaa sarvaadhik falprad daur 1920 main france main nivas karne kaa tha
 Many of his most successful stories were written there
 miss bril, di stranger, di dotrs of di let karnal, at da be, har first ball, da garden party aadi catherine ke yash ko tejoddipt karne vaali isi daur kii kahaniyaan hai jo uske tisare kahani sangrah da garden party main sankalit hai
 After his illness proved incurable, his famous story, The Fly, came at the center of life's emotions, war and courage
 aakhri kahani di canary main uske abhasith ant kii niraashaa tathaa lekhan kii simaaon ke prati akulata bhi vyakt hui he
 Robert Gorham Davis believes that Catherine Mansfield is historically the most influential and read storyteller among great story writers
 samay athwa atiparichay in kahaniyon ko basi nahin kar paata
 Apart from these, later 'composite Compositions' were also published along with compilation of unrelated compositions

48 manbodh-tola Khagadia is a village in Khagaria, Bihar
 bhautikee main, kisi ghurnan karne vaali vastu ke aksh ke ghurnan ko purassaran yaa ayan kehete hai
 There are two types of awards - praayah ham dekhte hai ki ghurnan karne vaali vastu kaa aksh apni sthiti badalata rahata he
 In other words, the rotation-axis itself is rotating in parallel to another axis
 khagolvigyaan main, khagoleey pind ke kisi ghurniy yaa kakshiya prachal kaa dhire-dhire parivartit hona ayan kehalaata he
 For half a year, the sun remains in the north hemisphere of the sky, for half a year in the south hemisphere
 dakshin golardh se uttar golardh main jate samay surya kaa centre akaash ke jis bindu par rahata he use vasantvishuv kehete hai
 This point is not stable relative to stars; It moves slowly
 is khisakane ko vishuv ayan yaa sankshep main keval ayan kehete hai
 The period in which the Sun returns again after walking from Vasant Vishuv and taking a round is called a cyan year
 kisi taare se chalakar surya ke vahiin lautne ko nakshatra varsh kehete hai
 If the equinox had not moved, the cyan and sidereal year would have been equal
 ayan ke kaaran donon varshon main kuch minuton kaa antar padataa he
 According to modern measurements, the average sidereal year value is approximately 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9
6 seconds, and the average cyan year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46
054 seconds
 sayan varsh ke anusaar hi vyaavhaarik varsh rakhana chahie, anyathaa varsh kaa aarambh sadaa ek ritu main na padegaa
 The year that was still prevalent among the Hindus was a few minutes larger than the Sion year
 isliye varsh kaa aarambh aage kii ore khisakta ja rahaa tha
 For example, in the last two and a half thousand years there has been a difference of 21 or 22 days
 thik-thik bataanaa sambhav nahin he, kyonki suryasiddhant, brahmasiddhanth, aryabhatiy ityadi main varshmaan thodaa bahut bhinn he
 If we use the old Varshaman for two to four thousand years, then the months of spring monsoon will fall in that season when the winter will continue to fall
 isiilie bharat sarkaar ne ab apane rashtriya panchang main 365
2422 dinon kaa sayan varsh apanaaya he
 One consequence of aion is that the celestial pole, that is, the point of the sky that is in line with the axis of the earth, moves between the stars
 vah ek chakkar lagbhag 26,000 varshon main lagaataa he
 Whenever the north celestial pole comes near a bright star, that star is called Dhruvatara in the northern hemisphere of the earth
 is samay uttar akashiya dhruv pratham laghu saptarshi ke paas he
 That is why we call this star Dhruvatara
 abhi akashiya dhruv dhruvatare ke paas ja rahaa he, isliye abhi saikadon varshon tak purvokt tara dhruvatara kahala sakegaa
 About 5,000 years ago, the first Kaliya named Tara was worthy of being called Dhruvatara
 bich main koi tara aisa nahin tha jo dhruvatara kehalaata
 15,000 years ago today, there was a star Dhruvatara named Abhijit
 hamaare gruhm sutron main vivaah ke avasar par dhruvadarshan karne kaa aadesh he
 It is clear that at that time there was some Dhruvatara
 isse anumaan kiya gaya he ki yah pratha aaj se lagbhag 5,000 varsh pehle chali hogi
 It is written in the Shatapatha Brahmin that kritikas arise in the east
 isse shatapath lagbhag 3,000 i
 pus
 kaa granth jaan padataa he, kyonki ayan ke kaaran krittikas uske pehle or baad main purv main nahin udai hoti thim
 By drawing the braid and placing it on the ground in such a way that the spindle of the braid is no longer standing, the axis of the braid keeps hovering slowly and it marks a cone
 thik isi tarah prithvi kaa aksh ek shanku parilikhit karata he jiskaa ardh sheershakon lagbhag 23 degree hota he
 The reason is that the Earth is not exactly spherical
 bumadhya par vyas adhik he
 By rough calculation we can assume that the central part is purely spherical and its exit is a ring affixed to the equator
 surya sadaa ravimaarg ke samtal main rahakar prithvi ko aakarshith karata he
 This attraction does not pass through the center of the Earth, because one segment of the pre-conceived ring is relatively close to the Sun, the other is far away
 nearesth bhaag par aakarshan adhik padataa he, duurastha par kam
 Therefore, there is a tendency for these attractions to rotate the earth and make its axis perpendicular to the surface of the sun
 yah ghurnanaj ba prithvi ke apane aksh ke parit: ghurnan ke saath sanlisht kiya jaataa he to parinami ghurnan aksh kii disha nikalati he jo prithvi ke aksh kii puraani disha se jaraa si bhinn hoti he, arthath prithvi kaa aksh apni puraani sthiti se is naveen sthiti main aa jaataa he
 In other words, the Earth's axis rotates
 aksh ke is prakaar ghoomane main chandramaa bhi sahaayta karata he
 In fact, the Moon has twice the effect of the Sun
 sookshm gananaa karne par sab baaten thik vahi nikalati hai jo bedh dwaara dekhi jaati hai
 On the puffed substance of the Earth's midline, the Sun's Assam attraction reflects the Earth's axis as a cone
 chandramaarg kaa samtal ravimaarg ke samtal se 5 degree kaa kone banaata he
 For this reason, the Moon sometimes pulls the Earth from the top of the sun, sometimes from below
 falat:, bumadhyarekha tathaa ravimaarg ke dharaatalon ke bich kaa kone bhi thod bahut badalata rahata he
 Which is called "vidolan"
 prithviaksh ke chalane se vasant or sharad vishuv donon chalate rahete hai
 The ayan mentioned above is called lunar-solar-ayan
 isamen bumadhya kaa dharaatal badalata rahata he
 But due to the attraction of the planets, the Ravimar itself is slightly disturbed
 isse bhi vishuv kii sthiti main antar padataa he
 This is called planetary aion

 mahabharat ke anusaar yadav 2 se 3 ghanto me prabhas se dwarka pohach sakate the
 Before Lord Krishna killed his deity, a Bhill made a deaf to the feet of Lord Krishna and dismembered the deer before departing to Paramdham
 uske baad jis prakaar capur jalane ke baad uski koi raakh nahi bachati usee prakaar bhagwaan shrikrishna ne apana atyant sudanr or pavitra parthav sharir panchtatv me villin karke paramdhaam ko prasthaan kiya
 a small village called Prabhas Tirth is left in his memory

 Lord Sri Krishna had 24 scum in Dwarka, then Harikot and today's Hirakot spread to Kodinar village

 Although many of its subspecies have been identified, the appearance of this bird does not change much between its broad subspecies
 ureshian vriksh gauraiya kaa ganda ghonslaa kisi bhi prakritik kotor main bana hota he, jo ki kisi imaarat main bana chhed yaa megpai athwa saras pakshi kaa bada ghonslaa ho saktaa he
 Ideally they lay 5 to 6 eggs in a set that matures in two weeks

 The unfriendly appearance of its face makes this species easily recognizable among other species; The other difference between the domestic male sparrow and theirs is their small size and brown color, not gray and the upper part of the head
 vayask or yuva ureshian vriksh gauraiya sharad ritu main dhimi gati se hone vaali nirmochan prakriya se guzarati hai or sanchit vasa main kami hone ke baavjood bhi shaareerik vazan main vruddhi pradarshit karti hai
 This change in their weight is due to the increased amount of blood to aid in the growth of the active fins and generally the excess of the aqueous fraction in the body

 The Eurasian species is not very closely related to the American tree sparrow, which is an American sparrow
 ureshian vriksh gauraiya kaa dwipadeey naam do latin shabdon se liya gaya he: passer, "gauraiya" or mauntanas, "parvaton kii" 
 The earliest description of the Eurasian tree sparrow was made by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in Sistema naturae as Fringilla montana, but along with the domestic sparrow, it was soon removed from the Finches family and became a member of the new species Passer, which was formed The French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brison did it in 1760
 ureshian vriksh gauraiya kaa saamaanya naam iske dwaara ghonsle ke rup main vrikshon ko variyata diye jane ke kaaran rakhaa gaya he
 Both this name and the zoological name montaneus do not uniquely explain the naturalistic preference of this species: the German name Feldsparling nevertheless approaches it somewhat
 apni vistrut shrinkhalaa main is prajati ke pakshiyon ke bich koi vishesh antar nahin hota he or aathvin prachlit up-prajatiyon ke madhya clement dwaara pahachaane gaye sabhi antar bhi bahut sookshm hai

 When the Eurasian tree sparrow and the larger domestic sparrow live in the same area, the domestic sparrow usually breeds in urban areas while the smaller, Eurasian tree sparrow nests in rural areas
 jahaan par pedo kii sankhya kam ho, jaise ki mongolia, ye donon hi prajatiyaan apana ghonslaa banane ke liye maanav-nirmit sthalon kaa prayog bhi kar sakati hai
 The Eurasian tree sparrow is considered a rural bird in Europe, but in East Asia it is an urban bird; In southern and central Asia, both Passer species can be found near towns and villages

 Some nests do not occur in this type of furrow, but they are also built in the roots hanging out of a thorny shrub or any other similar shrub
 gharon ke chhaton kii cotaron kaa bhi prayog inke dwaara apana ghonslaa banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or ushnkaribandheey kshetron main, tad vrikshon ke sheersh bhaag yaa kisi baraamde kii chat main bhi yah apane ghonslaa bana sakati hai
 This species can also breed in the dome and useless nests of the magpie bird, or the use of a large bird such as a white stork, white-tailed eagle, fish eagle, black eagle, or gray heron, or in the shape of unused poles
 Can also use nests
 yah kabhi-kabhi chhedon yaa samaavruth sthanon par andey dene vaale anya pakshiyon, jaise barn swello, house martin, sand martin yaa europi bi-iter, ke ghonslon par adhikaar karne ke kaa bhi prayaas kar sakate hai
 Their pairs can lay eggs in seclusion or in uninhabited settlements, and they also use boxes fitted to lay eggs promptly
 ek spanish adhyayan main, lakdi or kancreet ke mishran se banaaye gaye box main inke dwaara andey die jane kii dar lakdi ke boxon main andey die jane kii tulana main kaaphi adhik thi or woodcreet boxon main prajnan karne vaale pakshiyon ke andey zaldi hote the, unke sene kaa samay bhi kam hota tha or prati prajnan ritu ke anusaar unke prajnan kii sankhya bhi adhik hoti thi
 Eggs in boxes did not differ on the number of eggs laid at one time and the state of the chickens, but birds with eggs in woodcrete boxes had higher reproductive success rates, presumably because synthetic nests of wood The nests lived 1
5 degrees warmer than that
 garmiyon ke mausam main nar pakshi ghonsle ke nikat se awaz karata he, iske dwaara vah ghonsle kaa swaamitv prakat karata he or apane liye jode ko aakarshith karata he
 It can also carry nesting material to the nesting hole
 unka yah pradarshan or ghonsle banane kii kriya sharad ritu main phir se dohraayi jaati he
 In the autumn, these birds prefer the nests of the old Eurasian tree sparrow, especially those nests where the eggs have matured and hatched

 yah ghaason ke beej, jaise chikavid, bathua or chhitake hue ann ke dane khaati he, yah khaastaur par moongfaliyon ke liye khaadya padaarth milane vaale sthanon tak bhi ja sakati he
 It also eats invertebrates, especially during breeding times when young bird cubs rely mainly on animals for their food, eating insects, termites, earrings, goats, spiders and harvestmen
 apane chuujon ko khilne ke liye aksheruki jeevon kii talash main vayask bhinn prakaar kii ardra bhoomi tak tak jate hai or aksheruki jeevon kii vividhta or uplabdhta main jaldaar sthaan mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hai jiske falswaroop is ekaadhik andey dene vaali prajati ke sampurna lambe prajnan kaal ke dauraan chuujon kaa safaltaapurvak paalan-poshan hota he
 Large areas of former farms no longer provide invertebrates to them due to intensive agriculture, and the availability of any supplemental seed food within 1 km of the nesting site has no effect on the choice of nesting sites, or that of chicks
 The number also has no effect
 jaadon main, bijon ke strot hi inaki gatividhi ko simit karne kaa mukhya kaaran hote hai
 During this period of the year, each individual bird forms a linear dominance sequence in a group, but there is no strong correlation between the size of the neck spots and the location in this dominance sequence

 The risk of predation affects their diet plans
 ek adhyayan ke anusaar, aashray sthal or bhojan ke strot ke bich kii adhik duuri kaa arth hota he ki pakshi chote samoohon main poshak tak jate hai, is par kam samay vyateet karte hai or aashray se dur hone par adhik chaukanne rahete hai
 Sparrows can take food as "producers", searching for food directly, or as "seekers" with other group members who have already found a source of food
 sarvaprachlit bhojan sthalon par talashkarta rup main bhojan praapt karne kii sambhaavna adhik rahati he, haalanki yah parbhakshan-virdohi satarkta ke badhane ke kaaran nahin he
 One possible explanation for this is that only those birds that have low levels of fat accumulation will go to risky places in search of food
 vriksh gauraiya kaa parbhakshan karne waalon main kai prakaar ke baaj, shikara or ullu shaamil hai, jaise ureshian gauraiyabaaz, saadhaaran khermutiya, chote ullu, or kabhi-kabhi lambe kaanon vaale ullu or safed saras aate hai
 During its autumn release, it does not appear to suffer from the increased risk of predation despite the low number of flying feathers
 ureshian megpai, jes, list visals, chuhon, billiyon or sankuchit sanpon, jaise horseshoe vip sneke, dwaara inke ghonsle par hamalaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Many types of birds of insects thrive on these birds and in their nests, and the gnaw of the Nemidocopteus species is also known to inflame the population, resulting in wounds to their feet and toes

 Egg size does not affect neonatal mortality, but chickens born with large eggs develop quickly
 vriksh gauraiya ko bacteria janit or vishaanu janit sankraman bhi ho jate hai
 Bacteria have been found to play an important role in the failure of eggs to mature and in relation to the mortality of newborns, and due to the death of salmonella infection in large numbers, this phenomenon has been reported in Japan

 The immune response of the tree sparrow is less robust than that of the domestic sparrow and is considered a cause of greater aggression of the domestic sparrow
 gharelu gauraiya or vriksh gauraiya aksar hi kendriya, purvi or dakshini europe main sadak durghatnaon kaa shikaar ho jaati hai
 Their maximum recorded age limit is 13
1 years, but their ideal life span is 3 years
 vriksh gauraiya kii shrinkhalaa ativistrut he jo vartmaan main aparimanit he; vishwa str par isaki kul aabaadi bhi agyaat he lekin anumaanit aadhaar par isamen europe ke 52-96 million pakshi sammilit hai
 Although its population trend has not been evaluated, it is believed that the decline in the population of this species has not yet reached the threshold that it should be included in the IUCN Redlist
 For these reasons, the conservation status of this species has been rated as "the least worrying" globally
 haalanki vriksh gauraiya apana kshetra phenoscandia main or purvi europe main vistrut kar rahi he, lekin adhikansh pashchimi europe main isaki aabaadi main giravat aa rahi he, yahi pravriti anya krishibhumi vaale pakshiyon main bhi parilakshith he jaise chatak pakshi, corn banting or uttari lapaving
 1980 se 2003 tak, saadhaaran krishibhumi vaale pakshiyon kii kul aabaadi main 28 pratishat kii giravat ai he
 This decline in population is more severe in Great Britain, where it declined by 95 percent between 1970 and 1998, and is also severe in Ireland as they have only 1,000–1,500 pairs left
 british tapuon main, is prakaar kii giravat prakritik utaar-chadhaavon ke kaaran aa sakati he, jiske prati vriksh gauraiya gyaat rup se pravrutt hoti hai
 As fertility decreases, their fertility has improved significantly, indicating that their decline in fertility is not the reason for their population decline and their survival is a major concern
 vriksh gauraiya kii sankhya main ai badi giravat sambhawatah gahan krishi or krishi kshetra main visheshgyata ke kaaran he, visheshrup se laghu vanaspati naashak rasayan kaa prayog or sharad ritu main fasalon ke boye jane kaa chalan

 The pharaohs also provided land to their morgue cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death
 By the end of the ancient empire, five centuries of these feudal practices gradually eroded the economic power of the pharaohs, now incapable of maintaining a vast centralized administration

 Freed from their loyalty to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
 2160 BC Till, the rulers of Herakleopolis held control of Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt

 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asian settlers in the delta region to provide sufficient manpower for their particularly active mining and construction operations
 These ambitious activities of construction and mining, however, combined with the inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, made the economy tense and prompted a second intermediate period with a slow decline during the 13th and 14th dynasties

 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic relations with their neighbors
 The military campaigns waged under the command of Thutmose i and his grandson Thutmose III spread the influence of the pharaohs to Syria and Nubia, which strengthened loyalty and gave them access to important imports such as brass and wood
 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom began a massive construction campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak
 He also constructed monuments in glorification of his achievements, both real and imaginary
 The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to justify her claim to the throne

 Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies faced the challenges of native contradiction, incisive family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria formed after the death of Ptolemy IV
 Additionally, as Rome relied more heavily on Egypt for grain imports, the Romans took considerable interest in Egypt's political situation
 Continuing Egyptian revolts, ambitious leaders, and powerful Syrian opponents unbalanced this situation, resulting in Rome being forced to send forces to make this country a province of its empire

 However, it was an anti-religion whose tendency was to win converts to paganism and it challenged popular religious traditions
 As a result, persecution of converts to Christianity began which culminated in the great march of Diocletian in 303 AD, but Christianity eventually prospered
 In 391 AD the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced a bill that prohibited pagan rites and closed temples
 Alexandria became the center of great anti-pagan riots where public and private religious symbols were destroyed
 As a result, the Egyptian pagan culture continued to decline

 1599 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1599 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India

 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 chetana kuch jeevadhariyon main swayan ke or apane aasapaas ke vaataavaran ke tatwon kaa bodh hone, unhen samajhane tathaa unki baton kaa moolyankan karne kii shakti kaa naam he
 According to science, consciousness is the feeling that arises from the impulses reaching the brain
 in aavegon kaa arth turant athwa baad main lagaaya jaataa he
 The cerebral cortex has been considered the main sense, or principal place of consciousness, since a very old period
 isamen se bhi purvallat ke kshetra ko vishesh mahatv diya gaya he
 But Penfield and Yaspers explain consciousness in a new way
 unke matanusaar chetana kaa sthaan chetak, adhashchetak or upree mastishk ke upree bhaag ke aasapaas he
 They consider these parts of the brain and their combinations to be the highest level of organization of nerves
 purv lalaat kshetra tathaa adhashchetak ke bich bahirgami naadiyon dwaara sangyojan he
 The combination is direct or indirect
 paroksh sangyojan prishth cendrak ke dwaara hota he
 These pulse are also related to pence
 chetana manushya kii vah visheshta he jo use jivit rakhti he or jo use vyaktigat vishay main tathaa apane vaataavaran ke vishay main gyaan karaati he
 This knowledge is called thinking power
 yahi visheshta manushya main aise kaam karti he jiske kaaran vah jivit praani samajha jaataa he
 Man cannot do any of his physical activities unless he has the knowledge that he will be able to do that action
 koi bhi manushya kisi vighatak padaarth athwa ghatana se bachane ke liye apane kisi ang ko tab tak nahin hilaa saktaa, jab tak ki usko yah gyaan na ho ki koi ghaatak padaarth uske saamne he or usase bachane ke liye vah apane angon ko kaam main laa saktaa he
 For example, we can think of a man who is going towards the river
 yadi vah chalate-chalate nadi tak pahunch jaataa he or nadi main ghus jaataa he to vah duubakar mar jayega
 He cannot stop his walk and cannot save himself from entering the river until the knowledge is produced in his consciousness that he has a river and he can walk on land, but cannot walk on water
 can
 manushya kii sabhi kriyaaon par uparyukt niyam lagu hota he chaahe, ye kriyaayein pehle kabhi hui hon athwa bhavishya main kabhi hon
 Human beings can do any work only because of the inspiration arising from consciousness
 chetana or manushya ke charitra main moulik sambandh he
 Consciousness is the special quality that makes a man alive and character is his entire organization through which the reality of his survival is expressed and through which various functions of life are carried out
 kisi manushya kii chetana or charitra keval usee kii vyaktigat sampatti nahin hote
 These are the result of the social process of many days
 prayek vyakti apane vanshanukram ko swayan main prastut karata he
 He finds special types of rites as ancestral property
 vah itihaas ko bhi swayan main nirupit karata he, kyonki usne vibhinn prakaar kii shiksha tathaa prashikshan ko jivan main paaya he
 Apart from this, he also represents other people by himself, because they have had an impact on his life through his example, preaching and oppression
 jab ek baar manushya kii chetana viksit ho jaati he, tab uski prakritik swatantraaa chali jaati he
 Even in such a state, he is inspired by various motivations and inner instincts, but he cannot publish them freely
 vah yaa to unhen isliye sarvatha dabaa detaa he jisase ki samaaj ke duusare logon kii aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon main ve baadhak na bane, athwa unhen is prakaar chapet diya jaataa he, yaa kritrim banaaya jaataa he, jisamen unka prakaashan samajavirohi na ho
 In this way, the human consciousness or prudent mind exercises control over his subconscious, or natural, mind
 manushya or pashu main yahi vishesh bhed he
 This type of control is not there in the life of animals, so they do as they want
 manushya chetanayukta praani he, atev koi bhi kriya karne ke pehle vah uske parinaam ke bare main bhalee prakaar soch letaa he
 From the point of view of psychology, consciousness is the element present in human beings due to which he has all kinds of sensations
 chetana ke kaaran hi ham dekhte, sunate, samajhate or anek vishay par chintan karte hai
 Due to this we also feel happiness and sorrow and due to this we make many kinds of decisions and try to get many things
 maanav chetana kii teen visheshtaayen hai
 She is knowledgeable, emotional and functional
 bhartiya darshanikon ne ise sachchidanand rup kaha he
 The views of modern psychologists confirm the said prohibition
 chetana vah tatv he jisamen gyaan kii, bhav kii or vyakti, arthath kriyasheeltaa kii anubhuti he
 When we know a substance, we are aware of its nature, a dear or unpleasant feeling is born towards it and a desire is created towards it, due to which we either bring it closer to us or remove it away from us
 
 chetana ko darshan main swayamprakash tatv mana gaya he
 Psychology has not yet progressed in the form of consciousness
 chetana hi sabhi padaartho ko, jad chetan, sharir man, nirjeev jivit, mastishk snaayu aadi ko banaati he, unka swaroop nirupit karti he
 Then it is indiscriminate to try to explain consciousness through them
 megadugal mahashay ke kathananusaar jis prakaar bhautik vigyaan kii apni hi sochane kii vidhiyaan or vishesh prakaar ke pradutt hai usee prakaar chetana ke vishay main chintan karne kii apni hi vidhiyaan or pradutt hai
 Therefore, the subject of consciousness can neither be thought of by the methods of physics nor can it be used in its work
 phir bhautik vigyaan swayan apni un antim ikaayiyon ke swaroop ke vishay main nishchit mat prakashit nahin kar paaya he jo us vigyaan ke aadhaar hai
 So far, improvisation has been made about matter, power, speed, etc
 abhi tak unke swaroop ke vishay main antim nirnay nahin hua he
 Therefore, it is not rational to expect a final decision about consciousness
 chetana ko achetan tatv ke dwaara samajhaana, arthath usamen kaary-kaaran sambandh jodna sarvatha avivekpurna he
 Psychologists who have tried to explain consciousness as the result of the actions of the root matter, ie those who have considered it to be the result of physical actions, pulsing of nerves, etc
, have eliminated the presence of consciousness
 unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 This is the result of the contemplation of Pavlaf and Watson sir
 unke kathananusaar man athwa chetana ke vishay main manovigyaan main sochna hi vyarth he
 The subject of psychology should be the visible behavior of man
 chetana ke sharir main sambandh ke vishay main manovaigyanikon ke vibhinn mat hai
 According to some, consciousness is the result of the actions that occur in the large brain of man, that is, the pulsing of some pulse
 yah apane main swatantra koi tatv nahin he
 According to others, consciousness is a self-element and has a relationship with the body, that is, actions in consciousness affect the body
 kabhi-kabhi chetana kii kriyaaon se sharir prabhavit nahin hota or kabhi sharir kii kriyaaon se chetana prabhavit nahin hoti
 According to one belief, the body is just a tool for the functioning of consciousness, which it sometimes uses and never brings
 parantu yadi yantra bighad jaae, athwa tut jaae, to chetana apane kaamon ke liye aapng ho jaati he
 The above opinion has been considered the best in the state of current progress of science by some serious psychological thinkers
 chetana ke teen str maane gaye hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 At the conscious level, all the things through which we think, understand and work
 chetana main hi manushya kaa ahambhaav rahata he or yaheen vichaaron kaa sanghathan hota he
 In the subconscious level, there are things whose knowledge we do not know immediately, but can be remembered in time
 achetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jo ham bhul chuke hai or jo hamaare ytn karne par bhi hamen yaad nahin aatin or vishesh prakriya se jinhen yaad karaayaa jaataa he
 The sensations that once remain in consciousness, they sometimes go into the subconscious and unconscious mind
 ye anubhutiyaan sarvatha niskriy nahin hotin, varan maanav ko anjaane hi prabhavit karti rahati hai
 Consciousness develops through interaction with the social environment
 vaataavaran ke prabhaav se manushya naitikta, auchity or vyavahaarakushalata praapt karata he
 This is called development of consciousness
 vikaas kii charam seemaa main chetana nij swatantraaa kii anubhuti karti he
 She can influence and influence social things, but can also separate herself from this effect
 chetana ko is prakaar kii anubhuti ko shuddh chaitanya athwa pramaata, aatma aadi shabdon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 It has been discussed by scholars like Charles Yung, Spengel, William Brown etc
 ise deshkal kii seemaa ke baahar mana gaya he
