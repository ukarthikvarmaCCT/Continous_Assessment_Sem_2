anubhav ke do bhed hote hai- upekshaatmak or anupekshaatmak
 The experience that dissolves without imposing a sacrament of its subject is called "neglectful experience" and the experience which is destroyed by generating the sacrament of its subject is called "unimportant" experience
 kalantar main isi sanskaar ke jaagran se jo purv anubhav ke samaan gyanantar paidaa hota he use hi "samaran" kaha jaataa he
 The precision and inexactness of remembrance depends on the reality and inexactness of experience
 samaran ko pramaan or bhram donon se bhinn mana jaataa he, kyonki use pramaan maanane par uske liye atirikt pramaan tathaa bhram maanane par uske kaaran rup main atirikt dosha kii kalpana kerani hogi, jo uchit nahin he
 Pratyabhijya - Fluent cognition is called "pratyabhidya"
 sanskaar or indriya ke sammilit vyapaar se uski utpatti hoti he
 Being a customer of the unity of a predetermined and visible substance is the proof of the same permanent substance in power
 jab man sanyukt indriya ke sannikarsh se kisi vishay kaa pratyaksh hota he, jab tak us vishay ke saath indriya kaa tathaa indriya ke saath man kaa sanyog bana rahata he, pratirakshan us vishay kaa nayaa nayaa pratyakshgyaan hota rahata he
 This direct group is called streamwise knowledge
 vishay ke abaadhit hone se yah gyaan bhi pramaatmak mana jaataa he
 Otherwise, there are two distinctions of popular choice knowledge - prama and delusion
 bhram kaa hi doosraa naam he "anyathaakhyati"
 It has three distinctions - skepticism and accusation
 ek hi aashay main paraspar virdohi do padaarthon ke ek gyaan ko "sanshay" kaha jaataa he, jaise- "shabd: nityo na vaa" 
 The determination of the religion of another object in an object is called "antonyms", such as the knowledge of silverness in the CP glowing in the light of the sun
 virdohi gyaan ke rahete hue gyaata kii ichha se utpann honevaala gyaan "aarope" yaa "aharya" kaha jaataa he, jaise ranga ko chaandi bataakar kisi ganvaar ke haath use bechnewale thag ko range main chandeepan ke abhaav kaa gyaan hote hue bhi usamen ichhaapurvak chandeepan kaa gyaan
 In order to derive these other interpreters, the "enlightenment" supernatural approximation has been conceived in jurisprudence
 swatastv, paratstv- gyaan ke prama or bhram do bhed bataae gaye hai
 There are different views of different philosophies about their origin and their knowledge of divinity or illusion, but in jurisprudence, it is assumed that the origin of pramma is not only due to general knowledge but with the help of qualitative reason
 And the illusion originates with the help of discriminatory reason rather than by itself
 isi prakaar gyaan ke pramaatv evam bhramatv kaa gyaan bhi swat: arthath gyaan ke swaroopagraahak kaaran maatr se na hokar anya kaaran ke sannidhan se hota he, jaise pramaatv kaa gyaan "safal pravritihetuk anumaan" or bhramatv kaa gyaan "vifalpravritihetuk anumaan" se hota he
 The knowledge from which the tendency is successful i
e
 the attainment of the known subject is considered prama and the knowledge from which the tendency to fail is not the root of the known subject, it is called illusion
 nyaayashastra ke gyatavya vishyon me vaad, jalp or vitanda kaa bhi mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Vatsyayan has treated these three with the word "katha" in his judgment
 katha kaa arth he kisi vishay par vidwaanon kaa vah parsparik vichaar jo vaad, jalp or vitanda ke rup main uplabdh hota he
 The idea that is aimed at elemental decision is called "plead" and the idea that is aimed at conquering the opponent is called "jalp" and "vittanda"
 vaadaatmak vichaar main "chal" or "jati" kaa prayog tathaa "apsiddhant" "nune", adhik" or "hetvabhaas" se atirikt nigrah sthanon kaa udbhaavan vajry mana gaya he
 In this view, there is no need for assembly, arbitrator and king or royal representative
 isamen bhaag lenevaale vidvan avinitvanchak, asuyavan yaa duragrahi nahin hote
 Its goal is to reach elementality with pure justice
 isamen vichaarkon ke bich jayaparajay kii koi bhaavana nahin hoti
 The nature of jalp and vitanda is quite different from that of the suit
 in vichaaron main bhaag lene vaale vidwaanon kaa uddeshy tatvanirnay nahin, apitu jis kisi prakaar apane pratidwandvi ko mook banaakar apane aapako vijayi siddh karnaa hota he
 That is why the use of deceit and caste in these ideas and the emergence of all types of control places are cut off, as well as the smooth conduct of the idea requires assembly, arbitrator and state control
 jalp or vitanda ke uddeshy main aikya hone par bhi unki prakruti main bahut antar he
 Just as in the Zalp both the plaintiff and the defendant deny their party's means and antagonism, but in Vitanda only the plaintiff seeks his party's means, the defendant establishes his favor by defending the plaintiff's favor only And keeps on trying his means
 tatv nirnay ke liye "vaad" tathaa nirnit tatv kii raksha ke liye "jalp" or vitanda kii upyogita maani jaati he
 These subjects are also major subjects of jurisprudence
 prativaadee ke chhalpurvak akraman se apane paksh kii raksha ke liye chal kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 To denounce the plaintiff's side, his word conceives of his unnamed meaning as "deceit"
 chal ke teen bhed hote hai- vaakchal, saamanyachchhal or upachaarchchhal
 Knowledge of "caste" is necessary to avoid the use of "caste" itself, and to gain the ability to declare it unresponsive when the defendant uses "caste"
 vyapti ke abhaav main keval sadhamry yaa vaidharmy se vaadi ke paksh main dosha-pradarshan karne kaa naam "jati" he : There are twenty four distinctions of caste - apane aapako nigrahasthaan main padane se bachaane ke liye tathaa prativaadee ke nigrahasthaan main pahunchne par vigrahasthaan kaa nirdesh kar prativaadee ko nigruhit karne kii arhata praapt karne ke liye nigrahasthaan kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Its twenty-two distinctions are pledge, pledge, objection, pledge, oblation, subordination, meaningless, nonsense, unquestionable, non-committal, non-existent, inferior, excess, repetitive, non-objection, ignorance, retribution, deflection, obloquy, apportionment, abrogation, abstention
 chal, jati or nigrahasthaan ke ukt bhedon ke lakshan or udhaaharan kii jaankaree ke liye nyaayadarshan ke pratham adhyay ke dwitiya aahrik tathaa pancham adhyay or unpar vatsyayan ke nyaaybhashya kaa avlokan karnaa chahie
 Atma - The avidya, which is the Divine consciousness, is called Atma
 uske do bhed hai- jeevatma or paramatma
 God - The name of God is God
 vah ek or vyapak he
 Knowledge, desire and effort are its special qualities and they are all continual and universal
 ishwar hi jeevon ke purvarjit shubh, ashubh karmon ke anusaar jagat kii rachana karata he
 At the beginning of creation, Vedas are constructed for the benefit of the living beings
 brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra in chaar varnon tathaa brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanprastha or sanyas in chaar ashramon kii vyavastha kar manushyon ko varnashram dharm kii tathaa anya prakaar ke vividh lokvyavahaar kii shiksha pradaan karata he

 prayek jeev shubhashubh karmon kii punya paaparup vaasana tathaa vividh prakaar ke anubhavon kii vaasana dwaara anadi kaal se baddh hota he
 Dev, demon, yaksha, gandharva, man, animal, bird, snake, scorpion, insects, moths, creeper, vegetation etc
 He is born in various varietal vagaries
 ukt bandhan tathaa tanmoolak du:khayantranaa se use chhutkaaraa nahin miltaa jab tab use paramatma or swatma kaa tatvasaakshaatkaar nahin ho jaataa
 Twenty-one types of sorrow have been considered in salvation - jurisprudence
 ghran rasna, chakshu, tvak, shroatra or man ye chha: indriyaan; gandh, ras, rup, sparsh, shabd or ragadveshmohatmak dosha ye chha: vishay; vishayendriyon ke sampark se hone vaale chha: vishayanubhav, sharir sukh or du:kha- inamen antim "du:kha" swabhaavat: dweshya hone ke kaaran mukhya du:kha he, kintu sukh mukhya du:kha se anubiddh hone ke kaaran tathaa anya unniis mukhya du:kha ke janak hone ke kaaran gaun du:kha hai- in ikkis prakaar ke du:khon se sarvada ke liye purna rup se chhutkaaraa paane kaa hi naam he "moksh"he Mokshaksara - The "purification of the mind" from the ritual of Siddharma, "element knowledge of substances" and "direct realization of the real nature of the soul" These three are the means of salvation
 nity, naimitthik or nishkaam karm ke shraddha evam niyampurvak chir anushthan se jab manushya apane chitt kaa shodhan kar letaa he, sansar ke vishyon se use virakti ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop use jagat ke padaarthon visheshat: paramatma or swatma kii tatvajigyaasa hoti he
 Inspired by that curiosity, he reached the feet of Sadhguru, proof of this, by studying Shastra
 Theorem, etc
, of sixteen substances - whose justice - Vaishika's penetrating scholars have ingrained into these seven substances - matter, virtue, action, general, special, equitable and absence - earns philosophy
 ananthar manan, nididhyasana evam adarpurvak dirghakalvyapee avichhinn abhyaas se paramatma kaa alokik maanas tathaa visheshgunamukt aatma kaa loukik maanas tatv saakshaatkaar praapt kar nyaay darshan ke dwitiya sutara main kahe gaye kram se pehle jeevanmukti praapt karata he, arthath jivan kaal main hi sab bandhanon se mukt ho jaataa he or uske baad praarabdh karmon kaa bhoga dwaara avsaan ho jane par vartmaan sharir se sambandh todakar videhamukti ko praapt karata he
 He is never born again in any form, and he becomes eternally unhappy like God and is eternally reputed in his pure pure form

 Even after so many years after his death, Kafka embodies one aspect of modern ideology - that feeling of worry and shame that cannot be located therefore cannot be pacified; Within every step of the feeling of an infinite difficulty, which hinders every step; Like the body that suffers from every touch when its old skin is stripped of its sensitivity beyond utility, such as social use and religious belief

 The art and practice of discussing and negotiating an issue by representatives of nations or groups is called diplomacy
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main koi desh alag-alag nahin rah saktaa
 In these countries, it has become necessary to add mutual relations in these countries
 in sambandhon ko jodne ke liye yogya vyakti ek desh se duusare desh main bheje jate hai
 These people, by their ability, skill and diplomacy, often make friends of another country
 pracheen kaal main bhi ek rajya duusare rajya se kootnithik sambandh jodne ke liye apane kootneetijna bhejtaa tha
 Earlier, diplomacy used to mean 'in the deal or transaction, the sentence is chaturi, deceit-deception, cheating
' jo vyakti kam mulya dekar adhikadhik laabh apane desh ke liye praapt karata tha, kushal kootneetijna kehalaata tha
 But today, deceit is not called diplomacy
 vaigyanik drushti se aadhunik kaal main is shabd kaa prayog do rajyon main shantipurna samjhaute ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For diplomacy, the word diplomacy is being used in place of diplomacy in Hindi
 anterrashtriya jagat ek parivaar ke samaan ban gaya he
 It is the job of a skilled diplomat to add love, cooperation, goodwill and friendship among family members
 'rajnay' shabd angreji shabd 'diplomaisi' kaa hindi roopaantaran he
 The word diplomacy originated from the Greek word diplown which means to twist or repeat
 greek rajyon ke patan ke baad roman samrajya kaa vikaas hua
 In the Roman Empire, passports and permission to walk on the streets were doubled and sealed
 ye paasapart tathaa anumati patr dhaatu ke patron par khude rahete the
 These were called 'diplomas'
 dhire-dhire diploma shabd kaa prayog sabhi sarkari kagajaton ke liye hone laga
 The documents related to foreigners' privileges or immunities and foreign treaties also came to be called 'diplomas'
 jab in sandhiyon kii sankhya adhik ho gai to unhen surikshat sthanon par rakhaa jane laga

 The work of these employees was called a diplomatic act
 dhire-dhire is kaary vyapaar ke liye diplomasi shabd prayukt hone laga
 The word diplomacy has been used by thinkers in many ways
 herold nickelson ke anusaar kabhi iskaa prayog videsh niti ke samanarthak ke rup main liya jaataa he, jaise bhartiya rajnay padosi deshon main safal nahin rahi
 Sometimes the term refers to treaty negotiations, such that this problem can be solved by diplomacy
 rajnay sandhi vaarta kii prakriya evam yantra ko bhi ingit karata he
 Sometimes a branch of the Foreign Service is called diplomacy
 rajnay ko anterrashtriya sandhi vaarta karne kaa amoort gun yaa kushalta bhi maan liya jaataa he
 Its most corrupt use is when it is taken in a fraudulent act
 is prakaar rajnay shabd vibhinn arthon main prayeg kiye jane ke kaaran pathak ke man main bhram utpann kar detaa he
 Perhaps the term is most confusing in political science
 is vishay main aargensky ne kaha he ki 'kushalta, chaturaai evam kapat’ sareekhe gun ek achche rajnay ke lakshan ho sakate hai kintu inhen rajnay ko paribhaashit karne vaali visheshta nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Not even equivalent to diplomatic foreign policy
 yah videsh niti kaa aisa ang he jo uski rachana or kriyanviti main sakriy yogadan karata he
 ' argenski ke ansaar- According to Sir Ernest Saints, is sambandh main paamar tathaa parkins ne yah jigyaasa prakat kii he ki yadi rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon main buddhi or chaaturya kaa abhaav he to kya rajnay asambhav hoga ? spasht he ki rajnay do athwa do se adhik swatantra rajyon ke madhya sthit sambandh he tadnusaar prayek rajya buddhi, kushalta evam chaaturya kaa prayog karata he
 In the words of KM Panikkar, quinci rhite ne rajnay ko do arthon main paribhaashit kiya he - lokapriy arth main tathaa vishesh arth main
 In the popular sense - is paribhaasha kii khaas baat yah he ki lokapriy arth main rajnay ko aisi sandhi-vaarta mana gaya he jo dabaav par nahin varan samajhane-bujhane par aadhaarit rahati he
 In its special sense, diplomats have been considered devotional towards the national interest
 raajnneeti shaastra main rajnay kaa lokapriy arth lagu nahin hota
 In international relations, diplomacy only works where there is a possibility of pressure
 rajnay dwaara in sambhaawanaaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 The purpose of diplomacy is to make agreements and agreements are made only where there are some disagreements
 ye asahmatiyaan aisi honi chaiye jinamein vaarta dwaara sahmati kaayam kii ja sake
 Diplomacy is irrelevant in areas of absolute consensus and it is ineffective in areas of absolute disagreement
 rabrto regela ke anusaar rajnay shabd kaa kaaphi durupyog hua he
 Actually, diplomacy is a profession that involves many activities
 yah duniya ke aise kuch vyavsaayon main se ek he jisaki paridhi main maanviya kriya kii prayek shakha shaamil ho jaati he
 Its power politics is related to the struggle of economic power and ideologies
 regela rajnay ko ‘samjhauta vaarta kii kala’ maanata he
 In 1796, Edmund Burke, while defining diplomacy, wrote that diplomacy is the operation or operation of international relations
 george epa0 kenon kaa kahana he ki takneekee arth main rajnay kii vyavastha sarkaron ke bich sampark ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 Thus, different thinkers have given different definitions of diplomacy
 ye sabhi paribhaashayen purnatah upyukt nahin hai kyonki samay tathaa paristhitiyon main parivartan ke saath-saath rajnay kaa arth bhi badalata rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered diplomacy not only as an occupation but also an art
 adhikansh sarkarein apane hiton kii prapti evam abhivruddhi ke liye ise apnaane lagi he
 It is gradually becoming an effective means of peace
 shuru main rajya aseemit shaktiyon se sampann hote the faltah rajanyagyaan ko samprabhu mana jaataa tha
 They were given enough freedom to work
 is swatantraaa kaa anya kaaran yah tha ki us samay sanchaar ke drutagami sadhano kaa abhaav tha
 This widespread independence of diplomats began to be limited in the late 19th century
 us samay rajnay kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi thi ki rajanyagnon ko unke kaary se sambandhit aadesh tathaa nirdesh dekar hi bheja jaataa tha
 Nowadays it has not been necessary due to the convenience of rapid means of communication
 rajnay ko kuch log ek rahasypurna vyavsaay maanate hai
 this is not right
 hoodh gibason ke anusaar, ”asal main rajnay ek bhramasadhy vyavsaay he
 It is beyond magic or mystery
 ise kisi bhi anya sarkari kaary kii bhaanti ek gambheer vyavsaay ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Palmer and Parikans have described some features of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen rajnay ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye upyogi siddh hogi
 These features are the following: - nickelson kaa yah kahana thik nahin he ki yuddh armbh hone par rajanyik kaary band ho jate hai, kyonki paamar or parkins ke vichaar se rajanyagnon kaa kaary desh kii raksha karnaa he
 Therefore, during the war, they do not sit hand in hand, but at that time they cooperate in military work
 is prakaar yudhkaal main rajanyagnon kaa kaary rukta nahin, balki unke kaary kaa rup badal jaataa he
 During wartime, the work of diplomacy increases
 pichley do vishwayudhon kii ghatnaon ke avlokan se yah baat spasht ho jaati he
 To understand the nature of diplomacy, it is useful to study its relation and difference with foreign policy, international law and diplomatic politics
 pracheen bharat ke rajwanshon va rajyon main rajnay kii sudeergh parampara rahi he
 The earliest work on statecraft and diplomacy is Arthashastra, the credit of which goes to Kautilya, the principal adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya dynasty
 arthshaastra rajtv kii kala par ek sampurna rachana he
 It also has the principles of diplomacy, which describes how intelligent kings form alliances between mutually competitive states and put their enemies in stalemate
 us samay rajdarbaron ko bheje gayi doot deergh kaal tak rukaa karte the
 There are instructions in economics dealing with messengers
 kaha he ki - raja ke liye sabase badi naitikta he ki uskaa rajya samruddhi ko praapt kare aadi
 The policy to carry out the national program is 'policy'
 yah aantarik athwa bahari kisi bhi ho sakati he
 Internal policy is related to home affairs whereas foreign policy is related to the external arrangements of the nation
 videsh niti or rajnay, raajnneeti ke ve pahiye hai jinaki sahaayta se anterrashtriya raajnneeti chalati he
 Foreign policy is the fulfillment of its objectives in relation to other states by a nation
 aisi videsh niti ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa jo rashtriya hiton kii upeksha karen
 Therefore, foreign policy is interpreted as the behavior of the state through which states fulfill their interests
 arvachin yug main koi rajya apane aap main parthaky kii niti apanaakar alag rah saken, yah sarvatha asambhav he
 Foreign policy is made with much thought because the future of the state depends only on its right decision
 videsh niti ke nirmaan main rajya ko kai tatwon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 For example, the foreign policy of Britain and Japan has been deeply influenced by its geographical location
 rajyon ke prakritik strot athwa unka samrik mahatv aadi rajya kii videsh niti ko prabhavit karte hai
 Underdeveloped states, which continue to receive assistance from various powers and depend on them, can never form an independent foreign policy
 kisi desh kii sainik shakti uski videsh niti ko utsaahi banaakar galat maarg par le jaati he
 Germany, Italy and Japan invaded their neighboring states due to military power and called for world war
 rajyon kii raajnneeti tathaa unki videsh niti kaa nirmaan desh ke rajaneta karte hai, to rajdoot iskaa kriyanyavan
 In determining foreign policy, states have to take into account many perspectives of national and international situations
 jaise rajya kii bhugolic sthiti, aarthik aavashyaktaaen, prakritik strot, pratiraksha kii aavashyaktaaen tathaa sandhiyaan aadi
 Through this, efforts are made to make the adversary or enemy side powerless or the friendly state even more enigmatic
 videsh niti ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya santulan banaaye rakhane athwa samuhik suraksha aadi ke kadam uthaaye jate hai
 The basic mantra of foreign policy is 'enemy of enemy is friend'
 china ne isi niti ke antargat bharat ke shatru pakistan ke saath maitri sambandh banaaye the
 Similarly, the objective of foreign policy is also to establish 'neutral borders'
 seemaa ke prashn ko lekar rajyon ke madhya sambandh praayah bigadate hai
 There has been a situation of war or war between countries like india-pakistan, india-china, russia-china etc
 rajyon kii aarthik sthiti, vyapaar or vaanijya aadi ke sandarbh main bhi videshniti ke nirnay liye jate hai
 States sometimes lose their right to free decisions in their efforts to attain power
 rajya kii videsh niti ke nirnay uski samrik sthiti tathaa sainik shakti par nirnay karte hai
 The more powerful the state is, the more successful its diplomacy will be
 fradrik mahaan ke anusaar,” shakti bina rajnay thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa vaadun bina sangeet
 “united States diplomacy is successful only because of its power
 yadi koi rajya nirbal ho to vah swayan anya rajyon kaa us desh main hastkshep athwa akraman kaa nimantran detaa he
 The partition of Poland, the making of Italy a European destination, the merger of Austria and Czechoslovakia by Hitler and the invasion of China by India, were possible due to the powerless states
 niti nirmaataaon dwaara apane uddeshyon ko nirdhaarit karne ke pashchaat rajya ke samaksh in uddeshyon kii prapti kaa prashn aata he or yahi rajnay kaa prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 The state can be active or passive in the field of foreign policy
 yadi rajya sakriy he to rajya ke samaksh chaar vikalp hote hai, jiske aadhaar par vah kaary karata he - raajnneetik aarthik, manovaigyanik tathaa sainik
 Depending on the time and situation, the state can adopt any one of these options or can use its combined form
 niskriyata vartmaan anterrashtriya paristhitiyon main kisi bhi rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh ho sakati he
 States often use the path of diplomacy
 videsh niti kaa uddeshy mitra rajyon ke saath sambandhon ke adhik pragadh or shatru paksh ko niskriy bananaa hota he
 Diplomacy is the tool that helps in achieving this objective through dialogue and cleverness
 videsh niti ke uddeshyon kii prapti kaa sarvocch evam mahatvapurn saadhan hi he
 In fact, foreign policy is the skill of diplomacy
 kisi bhi videsh niti kaa nirmaan in adhikariyon kaa kaary he, vahi duusare deshon ke sandarbh main iskaa kriyanvayan rajdooton kaa
 In this complex era of today, even though technically, the State Department alone is considered to be the creator of foreign policy, it cannot be denied that ambassadors also contribute significantly in its construction
 rajdoot kii gatividhiyaan uske desh kii videsh niti par aadhaarit rahati he
 Although it is true that ambassadors are not independent in its operation
 videsh niti or rajnay ek-duusare ke paryaay nahin hai
 Some scholars use them in place of each other in a bond-free manner
 inamen paryaapt antar he
 Foreign policy involves efforts to protect the interests of nations, establish relations between them and maintain them
 je0aar0 childs ke anusaar “kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti uske vaideshik sambandhon kaa saar he” jabaki “rajnay vah prakriya he jisaki sahaayta se videsh niti karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 "in the words of Sir Charles Waxter," Most of the assumptions of policy are meaningless even if there is no means to convert them into action
 ” yah kaary rajnay karata he The diplomatic relations between the states have been going on since time immemorial
 ye utane hi pracheen hai jitne ki rajya
 In Greece, Rome, and ancient India, diplomatic relations were very extensive, and the rules determining these relations were also formulated
 puraane rajnay kaa arth pracheen kaaleen rajnay se kadaapi nahin he
 This refers to the diplomacy prevalent in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
 richalu dwaara pratipaadit va callears dwaara vyakhyayit rajnay ko, jise puraane rajnay kii sangya di jaati he, saare europe ne sweekaar kiya tha
 This diplomacy ran successfully on the basis of secrecy until the eighteenth century
 1919 ke purv kaa rajnay purana rajnay tha
 The period between the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 and the First World War of 1914 was a golden period of prestigious diplomacy
 yah nishchit niyamon se bandhaa tha
 The diplomacy of this time was based on chivalry, experience and objectivity
 yah vishwaas, spashtataa or yatharth ko safal rajnay kaa aadhaar maanata tha
 The talks were held in secret
 avaagaman va andeh vaahan ke sadhano ke samuchit vikaas ke abhaav main raajaneeyak prakriya kii gati mand thi
 The talks continued slowly
 isamen gatirodh aane par, inhen thode samay ke liye sthagit kar diya jaataa tha, evam anukool samay va paristhiti aane par inhen phir chaalu kar diya jaataa tha
 People did not get any news
 1907 main anglo-rashan kanvension kii vaartaayen pandraa maah tak chalin thi
 The new form of diplomacy that came to us after 1918 was called 'new diplomacy'
 yadhyapi 1919 main rajnay kii sthiti main parivartan aayaa, kintu 1919 kaa varsh vastav main koi vibhaajak rekha nahin he
 According to Nicholson, this has only happened that diplomacy has changed itself according to the new changing circumstances
 jules camban kaa bhi mat tha ki puraane tathaa nae rajnay ke madhya bhed bhram he
 Regala is of the opinion that even though the method of working has changed, modern new diplomacy is still adopting many qualities of old diplomacy
 rajnay ek nirantar gatisheel vyavastha he
 The basis of its ideas and principles today is the experience of hundreds of years
 ve, jinhone puraane rajnay kii katu aalochana kii or nayi vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya, jaisaa raashtrapati vilson ne kiya tha, unhen bhi sheeghra hi puraani vyavastha par phir aana padaa tha
 In this era of open diplomacy, treaty negotiations still operate in secret
 itnaa sab kuch likhane ke baad bhi is baat se nakaara nahin ja saktaa he ki yadhyapi tailoran or bismark tathaa kisinger ke dwaara prayukt rajnay ke sadhano main vibhaajan rekha khinchi ja sakati he, tathaapi rajanyik vichaardhaara main krantikari parirvatan aaye hai
 Today, diplomacy is run by the people and their representatives, not by a few select people, the kings and emperors or their beloved characters
 alag alag desho main rajnay sikhaane ke liye mahavidhyalay khole gaye hai
 Government officials are educated in Mussoorie before they are sent to the International Embassy in India

 In contrast, the author of the Upadhyaya-nirksini tika of Kamandakya Niti Sasar has considered Kautalya to be the judge, Kautalya Bhasya, Vatsyayanabhashya and Gautamsamritibhashya - the author of these four commentaries
 yadi ham kaamandakeey nitisar evam gautamadharmasutra ke muscari bhashya ko dekhte hai to kautaly ke liye 'ekaaki’ or ‘asahaay' visheshnon ke prayog milte hai
 The name 'mallanag' is mentioned to Kamasutrakara in the Vasavadatta composed by Subandhu
 kamasutra ke labdhpratishth jaimangla tikaakar yashodhar ne vatsyayan kaa vaastavik naam mallanag mana he
 Thus Kautalya, Varruchi, Mallanag are all called Vatsyayana
 abhi tak yah nirnay nahin kiya ja sakaa he ki vatsyayan koun the
 The judge Vatsyayan and Kamasutrakara Vatsyayan were the same, or different

 Among modern historians, M
 Harprasad Shastri urges Vatsyayana to be of the first century AD, but almost all the idolized historians accept some third century and some fourth century

 The Autobots immediately reveal their betrayal by killing Ironhide, arriving at the base with the Sentinel and protecting the pillars, he had just tied up with Megatron to rebuild the planet Cybertron

 After the French State Revolution, the artistic materials of the kingdoms were divided among various people
 tab tak landan main kalatmak vastuon ke sangrah kii pratha joro se chal padi thi
 As a result, many valuable and exquisite works of art from France were sold in the markets of London and Europe
 ise rokane ke liye france sarkaar ne rajkeey sangrahalay tathaa chitrashaala kii yojana banaai taaki desh kii anupam kalakritiyon ko rashtriya nidhi ke rup main surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 With this in view, a commission was set up there under the leadership of Alicjande Lenoa and the first national museum was established called "muje National de Manuments Française"
 tatpashchaat sansar ke anya pragatisheel deshon main bhi rashtriya sangrahalay tathaa chitrashalas sthapit hone lageen

 isiliye shuru main golakaar kalasangrahalay banane kaa bhi prachlan hua
 In Paris, Paul Nelson designed similar museum buildings

 Such famous museums are worth visiting Berlin, Munich, British Museum, National Gallery of London, Dresden Museum, Vienna and Marseille Museum

 Some of the artistic material that Napoleon had available in his European invasions was kept in this museum

 Christian Vann Michel, director of artistic materials in Vienna, first decorated the National Museum in this manner and this practice followed
 falat: landan, berlin munich tathaa anya kai nagaron main is prakaar ke rashtriya sangrahalay bane
 The planned museum gradually developed into the 19th century
 england main victoria tathaa albert sangrahalay bade hi suniyojit dhang se har prakaar kii kala ko unke vikascram se sajaayaa taaki unka vaigyanik dhang se adhyayan kiya ja sake
 All the artistic materials from prehistoric times to the east and west were arranged in sequence
 yahan tak ki adivaasiyon kii kala tathaa lokkala ko bhi unke vikascram se pradarshit kiya jane laga
 The museum thus became a science of its own and continued to progress
 sangrahalay ke liye visheshgy taiyaar hone lage jinhen "curator" kaha jaataa he
 Experts initially divided them into four departments to further refine the museum - kala se sambandhit sangrahalay ke antargat hi chitrashaala yaa art gailaree aati he
 Museum buildings have begun to become more scientific in the 20th century

 Gradually the museum is becoming so big that the viewer's mind is getting bored
 isiliye ab isapar vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he ki kalasangrahalay kaa vaataavaran adhik adhik ruchikar banaaya jaay
 Different rooms have different textures, they are painted in different colors, have different shapes, they are made attractive by garden gardens, display screens and other interesting materials
 samagriyon kii pustakaakaar suchi darshakon ko di jaati he taaki ve unase parichit ho saken
