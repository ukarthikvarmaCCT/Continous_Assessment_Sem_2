 " Since its inception, the band has sold over 30 million records in the US and the figure for the entire world is over 60 million

 The Green River tours and records were a general success, but in 1987 the band disintegrated due to a stylistic differences between the pair and other bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner

 a few months later, Gossard began practicing with Seattle's guitarist partner mccready, whose band 'shadow' had broken up; mccready encouraged Gossard to try to team up with Ament once again
 After practicing for some time, the three sent a demo tape of five songs to find a singer and a drummer
 He gave a demo to former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jake Irons to find out if they were willing to join the band, as well as to send the demo to others who, in their eyes, Be the right candidate for the lead singer
 aayran ne nimantran ko to asweekaar kar diya lekin parantu demo ko apane basketbaal mitra tathaa san diego, celifornia ke gayak eddy wedder ko de diya

 However, in a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story, Vedder admitted that the story was "utter nonsense"
 Ament and mccready make it clear that the name "pearl" is suggested by Ament, and the band later decide to name it "pearl Jam" after Neil Young attends a concert, in which they take their songs to novelty lane They were lengthened to 15–20 minutes and this practice was called jamming

 Initially the album sales were very slow but in the second half of 1992 it became a record breaking success which led to it being certified Gold and reached the second position on the Billboard charts
 ten ne "alive", "evan flo" or "jeremi" jaise hit gaanon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Initially considered by many to be an anthem, Vedder later states that "alive" is a semi-biographical story of a son who discovers that his father is in fact his stepfather, while his mother's grief over his son
 Appears to be having a sexual relationship with her as her appearance closely resembles that of her real father

 paristhitiki jeevigyaan kii ek shakha he jisamen jeev samudaayon kaa uske vaataavaran ke saath parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan karaten hai
 Each animal or plant lives in a certain environment
 paristhitigya is tathy kaa pataa lagaate hai ki jeev aapas main or paryaavaran ke saath kis tarah kriya karte hai or vah prithvi par jivan kii jatil sanrachana kaa pataa lagaate hai
 Ecology is also known as Environmental Biology
 is vishay main vyakti, jansankhya, samudaayon or echosystem kaa adhyayan hota he
 The term ecology, the first ecology, was used in 1866 by the German biologist Ernest Häckel in his book "general Morpology Late Organisms"
 beesvin sadi ke armbh main manushya or uske paryaavaran ke bich sambandhon par adhyayan prarambh hua or ek saath kai vishyon main is ore dhyaan diya gaya
 The result was the compilation of human ecology
 prakritik vaataavaran behad jatil he isliye shodhakarta adhikanshat: kisi ek kism ke praaniyon kii nasl yaa paudhon par shodh karte hai
 For example mankind builds on the earth and also affects vegetation
 manushya vanaspati kaa kuch bhaag seven karte hai or kuch bhaag bilkul hi anopyogi chhod dete hai
 Those plants continue to spread
 beesvin shatabdi sadi main ye gyaat hua ki manushyon kii gatividhiyon kaa prabhaav prithvi or prakruti par sarvada sakaaratmak hi nahin padataa rahaa he
 Then humans became aware of the serious impact on the environment
 nadiyon main vishakt audyogic kachare kaa nikaas unhen pradooshit kar rahaa he, usee tarah jangal kaatane se jaanwaron ke rahane kaa sthaan khatm ho rahaa he
 a variety of plant and animal species are found in each of the Earth's ecosystems, the study of which ecologists trace the history and formation of a particular ecosystem
 iske atirikt paristhitiki kaa adhyayan shahari parivesh main bhi ho saktaa he
 By the way, the study of ecology is not limited to the surface of the earth, marine life and water resources etc
 are also studied
 samudri janajivan par abhi tak adhyayan bahut kam ho paaya he, kyonki beesvin shatabdi main samudri tah ke bare main nai jaankariyon ke saath kai puraane myth toote or gaharaai main adhik dabaav or kam oxigen par rahane vaale jeevon kaa pataa chalaa tha
 There are mainly two types of components of an ecosystem - paristhitiki sajivon or unke nirjeev paryaavaran ke madhya sambandhon kaa adhyayan alag-alag staron yaa paimaanon par karti he
 From a living cell to organ, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome and biosphere, interactions between organisms and their environment have different forms and evolution
 atah paristhitikeey adhyayan ke staron main pramukh hai: Like other ancient religions, Vedic philosophy has also believed that nature is vibrated with life
 sampoorn charachar jagat arthath prithvi, akaash, swarg, aag, vaayu, jal, vanaspati or jeev-jantu sab main daivatv kii dhara pravaahit he
 Knowledge of this approach comes from the fact that when Shakuntala of Kalidas, who grew up in an ashram in the lap of nature, started going to the city to meet her husband Dushyant, the trees and flowers, the deer fed by her, were very sad
 Happened
 yahaan tak ki lataaon ne bhi apane pile pattey jhaadkar rudan karnaa shuru kar diya
 In that era there was complete identification and direct contact between man and nature
 manushya kii aavashyaktaaen simit thim or santosh itan tha ki prakruti ke shoshan kii baat to vah sapane main bhi nahin soch saktaa tha
 Close association with nature was the heart of all religions
 samay ke saath shaharikaran or audyogikaran ke chalate manushya kaa prakruti se sampark tuutata gaya or tathakthith vikaas kii andhi daud main uski yah anubhuti samaapt ho gai ki prakruti bhi ek jivant shakti he
 The Vedic ethos refers to a holistic life in which the needs of the body, intellect, mind and soul are taken care of
 sharir kii moolbhoot aavashyaktaa he khaanaa, kapadaa, makaan or iske baad chikitsa va anya sabhi bhautik sukh-suvidhaayen
 The mind is the center of desires, which wants wishes to be fulfilled
 lekin buddhi aavashyaktaaon ko simit karne tathaa ichchhaaon ko niyantrit karne ke liye is tarah maargdarshan karti he ki prakruti ke punarchakreekaran kii prakriya va sabhy samaaj ke maheen tantu ast-vyast nahin hon
 According to a paper presented by Mr
 Gulab Kothari in Melbourne, so-called educated people are responsible for the destruction of ecology and environmental harmony

 a bullet is a projectile that is fired by a revolver, slingshot, or aerial gun
 goliyon main saamanytah visphotak nahin hote, lekin ye apane lakshya ko puure prabhaav ke saath bhedit kar use nuksaan pahunchaati he
 The term "pellet" is also commonly used for ammo, or a cartridge, which is a mixture of pellet, shell, powder, and primer
 isliye gola barood yaa kaartoos ke varnan ke liye "goli" shabd kaa prayog takneekee rup se sahi nahin he
 The history of bullets is as old as that of guns
 multah, goliyaan dhaatu yaa pathar kii genden hoti thim jinka upyog ek hathiyaar ke rup main or shikaar ke liye ek gulel main kiya jaataa tha
 Finally as the guns developed, these small balls were placed at the end of a closed tube in front of an explosive charge of gun powder
 jaise jaise bandook takneekee rup se adhik unnat hone lagi, 1500 se 1800 tak goliyon main bahut kam parivartan aayaa
 They were simple round balls of lead, called rounds, which differed only in diameter
 haath kii kalvarin or mechalok arcwebus ke vikaas ke saath prakshepya ke rup main dhalwaan sise kii gendon kaa prayog hone laga
 "bullate" shabd kii vyutpatti francisi shabd bulete se hui he, jiskaa arth choti gend hota he
 The original bullet used in the gun was a round lead ball smaller than a bore, wrapped in a patch of loosely fitted paper that held the bullet firmly above the powder in the beral
 kaha jaataa tha
 Therefore, with the old smooth bore brown base and similar military guns, it was easier to load bullets into guns
 duusari ore, mul mazal-loding rifl, jisamen grouves ko rifl karne ke liye goliyaan zyada najdiki se feet kii jaati thi, use lod karnaa zyada mushkil tha, vishesh rup se tab bairal kaa bor pichhali firing se kharaab ho gaya ho
 isi kaaran se, praarambhik riflon kaa upyog sainya uddeshyon ke liye nahin kiya jaataa tha
 The first fifty years of the nineteenth century saw distinct changes in the shape and function of the bullet
 1826 main, ek francisi infentry adhikari, delvigne ne asambaddh kandhon se yukt ek brich kaa avishkaar kiya, jis par ek golakaar goli ko tab tak ghusaaya gaya jab tak yah rifl kii grouves main lod naa ho jaye
 However, Delvigne's method was not correct and it distorted the bullet
 nukili yaa "shanku ke aakaar kii" goliyon kii shrinkhalaa main pehali goli ko 1823 main british sena ke captin jon norton ke dwaara dizin kiya gaya tha
 Norton's bullet had a hollow base which, for rifling the barrel, spread with pressure when firing
 british aayudh board ne ise asweekrut kar diya kyonki golakaar goli kaa upyog pichley 300 saalon se kiya ja rahaa tha
 In 1836, the greener pellet was invented by William Greener, the famous English shotgun maker
 yah norton kii goli se bahut adhik milti julati thi, isamen ek antar yah tha ki iske khokhale aadhaar main ek lakdi kaa plag feet kar diy gaya tha jo rifling ko vistrut karne or pakadaney ke liye aadhaar par adhik nishchit dabaav daalata tha
 The test proved that Greiner's pill was very effective but it was rejected for military use, as it was believed to be very difficult to manufacture due to its two parts
 mulaayam sise kii mini ball ko francisi sena ke ek captain, clade etini mini ne 1847 main jari kiya
 It was almost like a greener pill
 mini ke dwaara dizin kii gayi goli shanku ke akar kii thi iske rear main ek khokhli guha thi, jisamen lakdi ke plag ke bajaay choti lohe kii topi feet kii gayi thi
 When it was fired, that is, the iron cap went into a hollow cave on the rear of the bullet, by which the bullet's sides were spread to strengthen the raffling
 1855 main, british ne apni enfield rifl ke liye mini ball ko apanaaya
 The Mini Ball was first used most during the American Civil War
 mote taur par is yuddh main, 90% hataahaton kii sankhya rifl se fire kii gayi mini balls ke kaaran hui
 Between 1854 and 1857, Sir Joseph Witworth conducted a long series of experiments on the rifle and, among other points, proved the advantages of the short bore and, in particular, the advantages of the longer bullet
 vitworth kii goli is prakaar se banaayi gayi thi ki rifl kii grouves main yantric rup se feet kii ja sake
 vitworth kii goli ko sarkaar ke dwaara kabhi bhi nahin apanaaya gaya, haalanki 1857 or 1866 ke bich match uddeshyon or lakshya abhyaas ke liye inkaa upyog bade paimaane par kiya gaya, jab dhire dhire metford ke dwaara ise pratisthapit kiya gaya
 Around and after 1862, W

 Metford conducted many experiments on bullets and rifles and invented an important system of light rifling with increasing spiral and a hardened bullet
 iskaa sanyukt parinaam yah hua ki disambar 1888 main lee-metford kii chote bor kii rifl, mark I, ko antat british sena ke dwaara apana liya gaya
 lee-metford was the predecessor of lee-enfield
 rifl kii goli ke itihaas main aglaa mahatvapurn parivartan 1882 main aayaa jab, edward rubin, jo thun main swiss sena prayogshaala ke nideshak the, ne ek tambe ke jacket vaali goli kaa avishkaar kiya-yah ek lambi goli thi jiskaa sise kaa kor ek tambe kii jacket main rakhaa gaya tha
 It was also small bore and was a successor to the 8mm "label bullet" adopted for the smokeless powder ammo of the Mle 1886 label rifle
 tej gati se fire kii gayi sise kii goliyon kii sataha pigal sakati he aisa peeche upasthit garm gaison or bor ke saath gharshan ke kaaran hota he
 Because the melting point of copper is high and the specific heat and hardness values are also high, the muzzle speed increases due to the bullets present in the copper jacket
 vayugatiki main aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran nukili spitzar goli kaa vikaas hua
 By the early twentieth century, most of the world's armies had become infected with Spitzer bullets
 in goliyon ko zyada sateek rup se adhik duuri tak daaga ja saktaa tha or inamen adhik urja hoti thi
 The combination of Spitzer bullets and machine guns greatly increased the lethality of war
 bullate yaa goli kii akruti main sabase aadhunik navinikaran jo hua, vah he naav jaisi poonch, spitzar bullate ke liye ek aadharekhit aadhaar
 High when the air rapidly passes over the end of the bullet, a vacuum is created, which reduces the velocity of the projectile
 aadharekhit naav jaisi poonch kaa dizin, iske antim sire kii sataha par hawa ke pravaah kii anumati detaa he, jisase yah form dreg kam ho jaataa he
 The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as a favorable shape for rifle technology
 spitzar or naav jaisi poonch vaali goli ke pehle sangyojan ko iske khojakarta ke naam par bel "di" naam diya gaya he, ise francisi label model 1886 rifl ke liye, 1901 main maanak sainya barood ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Two primary problems have to be resolved in the design of a bullet
 unamem pehle bandook ke bor ke saath ek sil banaayi jaani chahie
 agar ek majboot sil nahin banaayi jaati he, bullate ke nikal jane ke baad pranodak charge se gas li hogi, jo isi dakshata ko kam kar degi
 Bullets should work in the rifling process in such a way that there is no damage to the bore of the gun
 goliyon par ek aisi sataha honi chahie jo bahut zyada gharshan paidaa kiye bina is sil kaa nirmaan kare
 This interaction between the bullet and the bore is called internal ballistics
 goliyon kaa utpaadan unche maanak par kiya janaa chahie, kyonki satahi virupata firing kii sateekta ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The physics affecting the bullet after it comes out of the barrel is called external ballistics
 udaan bhar rahi ek goli kii vayugatiki ko prabhavit karne vaale kaarak hai goli kii akruti or bandook kii bairal kii rifling ke dwaara utpann ghurnan
 Rotational forces stabilize the bullet aerodynamically and gyroscopically
 goli yaa bullate main kisi bhi prakaar ki asamamiti bade paimaane par radd ho jaati he jab yah spin hoti he
 With smooth bore guns, a spherical shape was favorable because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a flat front
 ye asthir goliyaan anishchit rup se gir jaati thim, yaa avyavasthit rup se aage peeche ludhakne lagati thim or keval madhyam sateekta uplabdh karaati thim, haalaanki vayugathik akruti main sadiyon main bahut kam parivartan aayaa
 Generally, bullet shapes were a compromise between aerodynamics, internal ballistics requirements, and end ballistics requirements
 goli ke dravyaman centre ke liye sthirikaran kii ek or vidhi he aage utani duuri par rahanaa jitna ki vyavhaar main mini ball yaa shatalkock main hota he
 This allows the bullet to fly forward towards the front through aerodynamics
 dekhen terminal prakshepiki or / yaa goli kaa dijin kaise prabhavit karata he iske rokane kii kshamta kaa avlokan karen, kya hota he jab ek goli ek vaastu ko prabhavit karti he
 The result of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical properties of the bullet itself
 goli ko aamtaur par is prakaar se dizin kiya jaataa he ki yah lakshya ko bhed sake, use viroopit kar sake or / yaa use tod sake
 For a given material and bullet, the hitting velocity is the primary factor that determines the result
 vastav main goli kii kai akritiyaan hai or ye kai prakaar kii hai or unki ek sarini ko kisi bhi reloding menual main praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo bullate mould ko bechati he
 RCBS is one of several manufacturers offering several different designs, starting with a basic round ball
 ek mould ke saath, koi apane gole barood ko relod karne ke liye goliyon ko ghar par bhi bana saktaa he, jahaan sthaneey kanoon is baat kii anumati dete hai
 Hand casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead tablets
 cast or jacket se yukt goliyaan bhi vyavsaayik rup se haath ladaan ke liye asankhya nirmaataaon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi hai or ye sise kii casting goliyon se kahin adhik suvidhajanak hai
 Bullets were manufactured by casting pure lead to guns or black powder loaded from the muzzle
 yah kam gati kii bulats ke liye acchhee tarah se kaam karti thi, jinhen 450 m / s se kam veg par daaga jaataa tha
 For slightly higher speed bullets fired by modern guns, a more hard alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead is preferable
 or adhik zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, jacket yukt bulats kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The common element in all of these is lead, which is used extensively because of its high density and therefore it provides more mass — and thus, produces more kinetic energy for a given volume
 sisa sasta bhi hota he, ise praapt karnaa aasaan he, is par kaam karnaa aasaan he, yah kam taapmaana par pigal jaataa he, inhen sab kaarnon se goliyaan yaa bulats banane main inkaa upyog karnaa aasaan he
 It can also be said that lead is toxic, making it a more dangerous weapon
 saint petersburg kii 1868 kii ghoshnaa main 400 gram se kam vajan ke visphotak projectile ke upyog ko nishiddh kar diya gaya
 The Hague Convention prohibits the use of special types of ammo by uniformed military personnel against uniformed military personnel on the opposing side
 inamen ve projectile shaamil hai jo ek vyaktigat, visheile or expending bullate ke bheetar visphotit hote hai
 In Protocol III of the 1983 Convention on Special Conventional Weapons, relating to the Geneva Conventions, the use of ammo to fire against civilians was prohibited
 in sandhiyon main koi bhi tressor ko nishiddh nahin karti he yaa sainya upkarnon main nishiddh goliyon kii baat karti he
 These treaties even apply to 
22 LR bullets used in pistols, rifles and machine guns
 isliye, ucch maanak HDM pistal, ek 
22 LR sapresd pistal, ke liye dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan vishesh bulats ko viksit kiya gaya, inamen holo point bullate ke bajaay aisi goliyon kaa upyog kiya gaya jin par puri dhaatu kii jacket thi, jo 
22 LR rounds ke liye upyukt the
 The term bullet is sometimes used figuratively because of its speed, eg: is lekh kii saamagree sammilit hui he britnica vishwakosh ekadashwein sanskaran se, ek prakaashan, jo ki jan saamaanya hetu pradarshit he

 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii janmbhumi nadi tigrees va ganga ke madhya kaa kshetra hi he
 a total of two types of religions were born
 pehla abrahamik ev doosraa hindu
 Under the Abrahamic religion, basically three religions are Jewish, Christian and Muslim

 Although the Crusade and Jihad have been going on since Islam was established
 teenon dharm ke anuyaayiyon ne talwaar kii dhar par vistaarwaad kaa anwarat prayaas kiya he
 The emergence of violence has also been the result of geographical situations
 marusthal kabhi behad thande or kabhi kabhi behad garm
 The birth of violent spirit in extreme weather nature is a natural process
 vishwa main in sabase bhinn ek or bhi mukhya dharm he vah he hindu dharm
 The birthplace of this religion has been the year of India
 pehle teenon dharmon main ek jo mukhya samyata he, vah he akeshwarwad kii
 At the same time Hinduism is a religion that believes in diversity
 hindu dharm ke antargat to tat tvam asi ko udghosh ke saath hi har vyakti ishvar yaa ishvar kii pratimurti he
 It is a process of multiplying from one
 hamen in dharmon kii tulana karne hetu inaki prishthbhumi khangaalane kii aavashyaktaa
 The three religions of the Abrahamic family are religions born in the desert and Hinduism is basically a religion born on the banks of the river
 marusthal main vividhta nahin hoti he
 The only sandy earth spread all around is visible
 aise main ek hi aseem shakti kaa anubhav ek sahaj manobhaav he
 Man's consciousness of God is ordinarily through nature
 jab prakruti main koi vividhta nahin dikhaayi degi tab vahaan se sanskaar or sanskaron se niklaa hua dharm bhi vividhta viheen hi hoga
 The three Abrahamic religions originated in the desert
 to marusthal kii bhaanti MONOTONY yaa ekresata he va marusthal kii tarah hi aparivartansheel bhi he
 There are many similarities among the three religions
 yatha ek ishvar
 An almighty God who governs the creatures of the world and punishes them for their sins
 yani ishvar kaa shashan bhay kii satta par tikaa hua he
 Surprisingly, there is no word for any language "virtue" in the languages associated with these three religions
 sirf paap ke liye shabd he
 That is, there is an attempt to establish God completely through fear
 ishvar kisi unchen sthaan par baith sabake paapon kii ginati kar qayaamat kaa intjaar karata he
 In Hinduism, like the flow of a river, a waiting change is novelty
 isi kaaran se indradhanushi vividhta bhi he
 There is a Prophet in the Abrahamic religions through which God commands the people of TEN COMMANDMENTS
 evam unki avhelnaa karne par sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 It is a process of descending of divinity
 upar se neeche aane kii prakriya he
 In Hinduism, ego is the epitome of Brahmasmi
 yani arohan kii prakriya he
 Man is the process of attaining Brahmanism through his own practices

 a lava tube is a naturally formed pipe, tube, or tunnel shaped structure formed by lava flows

 Microscopy or microscopy is a branch of science, in which micro and microscopic organisms are able to enlarge, which is not possible to see with ordinary eyes
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy sookshmjeev sansar kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 It uses light reflection, refraction, diffraction and electromagnetic radiation
 vigyaan kii is shakha mukhya prayog jeev vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Microscopy is used to control diseases and discover new drugs around the world
 sookshmdarshan kii teen prachlit shakhaon main optical, electron evam scanning prob sookshmdarshan aate hai
 The subject of microscopy is thought to have originated in the early 17th century
 isi samay jab vaigyanikon or abhiyantrikon ne bhautikee main lens kii khoj kii thi
 After the invention of the lens, it was possible to see objects larger than their original size
 isse pani main paae jane vaale chote or anya ati sookshm jantuon kii gatividhiyon ke darshan sulabh hue or vaigyanikon ko unke bare main naye tathyon kaa gyaan hua
 Only after this, the scientists also came to know that the vast world is waiting for them about the living world and how little their knowledge was till now
 microscopy kii shakha ke rup main drushti sambandhi sookshmdarshan kaa janm sabase pehle mana jaataa he
 It is also called light microscope
 jeev-jantuon ke angon ko dekhne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 Light microscopes are relatively expensive but better equipment
 sookshmdarshan ke kshetra main electron sookshmdarshi kii khoj atyant mahatvapurn mile kaa pathar mana jaataa he kyonki isaki khoj ke baad vastuon ko unke vaastavik aakaar se kai hajaar guna bada karke dekhnaa sambhav hua tha
 It was discovered in the twentieth century
 haalanki electron microscope anya sookshmdarshiyon se mahangaa hota he or prayogshaala main iskaa prayog karnaa chaatro ke liye sambhav nahin hota, lekin iske parinaam kaaphi behatar hote hai
 The images obtained from this are very clear
 sookshmdarshan main ek anya takanic kaa prayog hota he, jo electron sookshmdarshan se bhi behatar maani jaati he
 In this, the object is tested from many angles using hand and needle
 graham sten ne isi prakriya main sabase pehle jeevanu ko dekha tha
 Microscopy is an integral part of physics
 aaj sookshmdarshi kaa upyog kaaychikitsa, jeevigyaan, shailavigyaan, maapvigyaan, crystalavigyaan evam dhaatuon or plastic kii talakriti ke adhyayan main vyapak rup se hi ho rahaa he
 Today, microscopes are not only used for viewing objects, but also for measuring, counting and weighing particles of liquids
 manushya kii pravriti sadaa hi adhik se adhik jaanane or dekhne kii rahi he, isi se vah prakruti ke rahasyon ko adhik se adhik suljhaana chahta he
 Our senses have limited ability to function, and so is our eyes
 isaki bhi apana ek seemaa he
 a very distant object that cannot be seen with an empty eye can be seen with a telescope or a detailed description of a very close object can be seen more clearly than a microscope
 yahan sookshmdarshi ke kshetra main 1865 i
 se ab tak jo pragati hui he usee kaa ullekh kiya ja rahaa he: a single convex lens, commonly called a magnification lens, can be called the simplest microscope
 ise 'jebi sookshmdarshi' bhi kehete hai
 a simple microscope is made of a combination of two convex lenses located at a certain distance
 padaardh kii taraf lage lens ko abhidrishyak lens or aankh ke paas lage lens ko 'abhinytra lens' kehete hai
 The field of view of such a microscope is limited
 isamen sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 Adding a lens to the optical lens increases the area and reduces defects caused by spherical chromatography and chromatic chromatography
 aise sookshmdarshi ko sanyukt sookshmdarshi yaa prakaash sookshmdarshi yaa paramparaagat prakaashiya sookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Although the laws of reflection, refraction, and linear transmission of light were known to Greek philosophers a few centuries before Christ, the law of incidence of incidence and sine of angle of refraction was not invented until the late seventeenth century
 holland ke snaill or france ke dekart ne alag-alag iskaa avishkaar kiya
 Alhazain, the Arabian astrologer around 1000 AD, formulated the laws of reflection and refraction, but they were not in the sine, but in a long distance
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki uske paks ek bada lens tha
 The microscope starts from here
 sookshmdarshi nirmaan kaa shrey ek vanaspatijna jekarios jonamids ko he
 According to Hygge, the invention is attributed to Cornelius Drabble
 aibe ke samay tak sookshmdarshi kii paristhiti aisi hi rahi
 In 1870, Abe laid the foundation of a microscope
 unhone suprasiddh tailanimjjan takneekee nikaali
 This achieved the best contrast and magnification
 par jahaan tak parasookshmakanon ke adhyayan kaa sambandh tha, vaigyanik abhi bhi apane ko asahaay anubhav kar rahe the
 In 1873 AD, Abe felt that no matter how perfect the microscope is to be perfected, the fineness of its particles in a substance can be seen only to a certain extent
 keval aankhon se parmaanu yaa anu ko dekhnaa asambhav he kyonki hamaare netron dwaara sookshm vastuon ko dekhne kii ek seemaa he
 This limitation is not only due to the imperfection of the equipment but also due to the nature of light waves to which our eye is sensitive
 yadi hamen dhaatuon ko dekhnaa he to hamaare jaivikividon ko ek aise nae kism ke netron kaa vikaas karnaa hoga jo un tarangon ko grahan karen jo hamaare vartmaan saadhaaran netron, yaa drushtitantrika ko sugrahya hone vaali tarangon kii apeksha hajaaron guna choti hai
 In fact, two adjacent points in an object can never be distinguished if the wavelength of the light in which those points are observed does not exceed twice the distance between those points
 is prakaar se yah unke bilgau ko simit kar detaa he
 This is called the limit of resolution
 ganit main ise nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Limit of differentiation jahaan N
A
 sankhyatmak dwarak he or N
A
 = sin 
 Here u is the refractive index of object distance
 q vah kone he jo rim kiran prakaashik aksh ke saath banaati he
 Thus, considering the radiation of vision, the minimum resolution distance is around 3000 a °
 sabase choti parabegni or avarakt kirnon ke liye yah seemaa kramash: 1500 A° or 3850 A° ke lagbhag hogi, jahaan 1 A° = 10-8 semi

 Let us think of ourselves as former microscopists and consider the reforms that we wanted to do at that time
 saadhaarant: ham apni aashaaon ko chaar baton par kendrit karte hai: The above mentioned improvements or difficulties with the nature of the object, the type of illumination and the photography technology invented the x ray in 1895
 parantu san 1912 tak eks kiran kii tarang prakruti kaa koi pataa nahin tha jab tak vaan laue ne use siddh nahin kiya
 Now it was hoped that X-ray microscopes could be made
 at: us samay yah vichaar tyaag diya gaya
 a few years later, in 1923, The Broglie determined the wave nature of the electron, and in 1927 AD Davison and Germer in New York and GP in Aberdeen
 Tamson confirmed it in 1928 AD
 electron ke kiran punj bhi upyukt vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetra dwaara mode ja sakate hai
 In 1947, Knoll, Rusk and Brukh presented microscopes that could be successfully used
 is vikiran kaa tarangadairghy nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Here h is the constant of Planck, m is mass of electron and q is velocity
 veg voltata kaa falan he, jo electron kiranpunaj kii twarit karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The resolution of up to 10 a ° was possible with this microscope and its magnification capacity was very high
 iske dwaara 1

10-8 mimi vistaar kii vastuen dekhi ja sakati hai
 This is undoubtedly a major advance and many new inventions are associated with it
 aaj electron sookshmdarshiki kii apni anek takneekiyaan hai
 Like high-energy electrons, x rays have very high solubility and are less quickly absorbed, as are high-energy electrons
 at: choti apaardarshee vastuon kii aantarik sanrachana gyaat karne main eks kirane prayukt kii ja sakati hai
 Ehrenwerk drew the first X-ray microscope or shadow microscope in 1947 and was corrected in 1948 by Kink Patrick and Bejoy
 electron sookshmdarshi kii tarah yahan nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Only fine holes are required for good reflection
 iskaa arth he ki isse kam vikiran pravesh karata he or isiilie udbhasana bahut bada hota he
 The back has to enlarge the picture for which an emulsion of very fine particles is required
 ab ham saamaanya drishy prakaash sookshmdarshiki kii ore dekhen
 Before we discuss the progress made in that direction, we have to keep in mind the aspirations of microscopists 40 years ago
 ekmaatr upkaran se sab aavashyaktaaon kii saath hi purti sambhav na thi
 The increase in resolution is limited by the value of a numerical gateway whose value cannot exceed 1
5
 pranali kii aavardhan kshamta kii vruddhi kii bhi ek seemaa hoti he
 It is a function of the focus distances of the used laces
 aavardhan focus duuri kaa pratilom falan he, at: focus duuri kii kami se aavardhan bad jaataa he
 But at the same time the functional distance is destroyed
 aise hi vichaaron ke kaaran lens ke sthaan main darpanon ke upyog se paravarti sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan barch ne bristol main 1947 i
 main kiya
 In principle, the use of radiation up to ultraviolet rays was possible here
 iskaa sankhyik dwarak kam hota he par avarnataa or adhik kriyaatmak duuri kaa isamen laabh hota he
 Since quartz does not absorb radiation up to 2000 a °, the minimum resolution distance would be 1,000 a ° would be obtained from a microscope using quartz lenses, thus using an ultraviolet radiation with this type of configuration is called an 'ultraviolet microscope'
 Is constructed
 yadi saamaanya prakaash sookshmdarshi kaa upyog choti vastuon dwaara bikhare vikiran ko ekatra karne ke liye hota he to is prakaar kii vyavastha ko parasookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Prof
 Zernik used art contrast illumination in microscopes
 is takneekee ko kala vaishamy sookshmdarshiki kehete the
 It is a method of showing the structure of colorless especially transparent materials
 vibhinn sanrachanaon ke kaaran unamem krambhang dekha jaataa he, jaise mechak ke yakrut main
 Biologists seek the help of pigments to improve the contrast
 praaia: vaishamy varna filter se aisa kiya jaataa he
 Only a few types of crystals can be analyzed with polarized light, but all types of crystals can be studied with artesunate
 is takneekee main abhiranjan ke rup main kritrim varnon kaa upyog nahin hota
 Defects in hygiene are reported to be that although the derangement does not destroy the cells of organisms, it cannot be said that it does not affect the organisms or cells at all
 kala-vaishamy-vidhi kaa laabh yah he ki pradipti jo prayek sookshmdarshi main aavashyak he, jeev ko dekhne ke liye or kuch karnaa nahin padataa
 In the art contrast microscope, the microscope remains the normal type
 isamen keval yah naveenta rahati he ki ek naveen prakashmay yukti jod di jaati he
 p is a glass plate with a circular groove
 plate par calcium fluoride kaa paardarshak lep chadha rahata he
 The thickness of the paste remains the same
 nirvaat main vaashpan dwaara lep chadhaaya jaataa he
 The thickness of the coating remains so that the time difference between the light passed by the groove and the other part of the plate is a quarter of the vibration
 da pardaa he jisamen ek valayakaar kaat hoti he jisase abhidrishyak main utana prakaash paarit hota he jitna kalapatt ke khaanche main bharegaa
 The light dispersed and diffracted by the object is not passed through the groove and when this light reaches the reflection, it is not mixed with the light directly reaching the source and the image is formed
 abhinaytrak main yahi pratibimb dikhaai padataa he
 Different parts of the object display different frequencies in light according to the refractive index, so the reflection seen in the actress is a refractive figure of the object
 yah sookshmdarshi 1952 i
 tak prayog ke liye uplabdh ho gaya
 In 1952, Prof
 Zernik received the Nobel Prize for this achievement
 dison ne 1951 i
 main is samasya ko bhinn rup se suljhaayaa jiske falswaroop unhone vyatikaran sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen paramparaagat kalavaishamy sookshmdarshi se kuch shreshthata thi
 In this, the object is pressed into the middle of two semicircular plates of glass and is seen with a special mirror system in such a way that some light goes straight through the object without passing through the object and the remaining light passes through the object
 is prakaar utpann vyaktikaran finj vastu kii apvartanaank sanrachana ko vyakt kar detaa he
 In fact, this two types of illumination are a means of great importance for a blurred background and artistic human
 dhundli prishthbhumi pradipti atyant sookshm kanon ko dekhne main upyogi siddh hui he or kala vaishamy pradipti se prakaashiya ghanatv main nunatam parivartan jaanane kii takneekee kii sambhaavna bad gai he jisase pratibimb kii vyakhya badi aasaani se kii ja sakati he
 We see that many aspirations of microscopists of forty years ago have been fulfilled
 iskaa yaheen ant nahin he kyonki kisi shodh kaa ant nahin hota or yahi baat sookshmdarshiki ke liye bhi he or aavardhan kshamta ke vibhedan kshamta kii upar di gai seemaa kii vruddhi ke prayaas ab bhi ho rahe hai
 With the use of new types of glass and plastic, further advancement in the technology of microscopy is necessary
 in sab sookshmdarshiyon se, jinka varnan kiya gayaahai, keval vistaar main hi vibhedan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 There is another branch of microscopy which is very spectacular and interesting
 yah prakaash vibhedan sookshmdarshiki he 
 Through this, depth resolution can also be detected
 yah gaharaai main vibhedan karne main utkrisht siddh hua he
 It is an optical and expressive technique known as light cut, light profile, multiple beam beam, fizo fringe and similar color gradient fringe
 in prishthiya chaanbin kii sugrahya vidhiyon main anvik pariman tak safaltaapurvak vibhedan kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of these microscopes would never have been possible if a device had not been developed to make metallic film more reflective by depositing it on the surface

 This is the same as the historical development of astrology and astronomy from chemistry
 aaj, ank vidya ko bahut baar adrishy ke saath-saath jyotish vidya or iske jaise shakun vichaaron kii kalaon se joda jaataa he
 The term can also be used for his people who, in the view of some observers, believe more on numerology, even if they do not practice traditional numerology

 Modern numerology at times mentions aspects of ancient culture and variations of teachers including Babylonia, Pythagoras and their followers, Hellenistic Alexandria, early Christian mysticism, the mystery of early esoteric knowledgeism, the Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, the Indian Vedas, the dead people of China
 The siege and the Egyptian master's book are included
 pithagoras or us samay ke anya darshanikon kaa yah maananaa tha ki bhautik avadharanaon kii tulana main ganitiya avadharanaon main adhik vyavhaarikta thi, isliye unamem adhik vaastaviktaa thi
 Saint Augustine of Hippo wrote, "numerals are universal language, given to us by God in confirmation of truth
 " pithagoras kii hi tarah, ve bhi yah maanate the ki prayek vastu main sankhyatmak sambandh he or yah mastishk par tha ki vah in sambandhon ke rahasyon kii jaanch kar inkaa pataa lagaaye yaa phir ishwar kii anukanpa se yah rahasy khulne de
 For early Christian mysticism see Numerology and Church Fathers

 Then by the mid-1970s, a student of Beliet, Dr
 Juno Jordan, further changed that numerology and helped develop the system that is today known as the "pythagorean"

 Numerologists often reduce a number or word to a process called adding digits, then reach conclusions based on the single digit obtained
 ankon ko jodne main, jaise ki naam se spasht he, ek sankhya ke sabhi ankon kaa yoga kiya jaataa he or jab tak ekal ank kaa jawaab nahin mil jaataa tab tak is prakriya ko doharaaya jaataa he
 For a word, the value associated with the location of each letter in the alphabet is asserted
 udhaaharan : The fastest way to arrive at the sum of a single digit is to simply change the result from 9 to 0 to get the value modulo 9

 Scientific theories are sometimes called "numerology" if their primary motivation is mathematical rather than scientific
 shabdon kaa is tarah pukaara janaa vaigyanik samudaay main kaaphi saamaanya he or prashnaatmak vigyaanan ke jaise ek siddhant ko radd karne ke liye iskaa adhiktar istemaal hota he
 One of the most well-known examples of "numerology" in the field of science involves the coincidence of the equality of certain large numbers, which took the ranks of mathematical physicists such as Paul Dirac, mathematician Hermann Veal and astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington

 NATO Charter nato iske charter, jo kii anumati detaa shaamil dalon ke saath paraamarsh karne ke liye raajnneetik swatantraaa yaa Action in Kosovo was justified under Article 4 whenever the safety of any of the parties is threatened
 kyonki NATO assignments in Kosovo were taken after consultation with all members, were approved by a NATO vote, kiya gaya or kai nato sadasyon dwaara kiye gaye, nato kaa kahana he ki uske kaaryon ko apane charter ke anusaar was done
 kuch kaa tark he ki nato ke charter ke anuchhed 5 sthitiyon, jahaan ek nato sadsy par hamalaa kiya he To restrict NATO use of force
 But it was argued that NATO actions violated nato's charter itself kiya gaya
 Critics of this theory argue that all NATO members respond for the purpose of Article 5 ke liye jab koi nato sadsy par hamalaa kiya he, ke liye paristhitiyon ke tahat nato ke liye bal prayog kaa chayan Will not be restricted
 nato kii bhagidaari ke virodhiyon bhi tark he ki srbija or yugoslavia main sthiti nato sadasyon main se kisi ko No danger was posed

 On many treaties since hastakshar kiye hai, jabaki bal kaa upyog karen prabhaav main he, adhikansh vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki 52 Article is only compelled to do in the United Nations Charter of Principles of International Law sannihit ke ulanghan main he darshata he
 Therefore, whether the treaties are void is the question of whether the NATO of the military upyog sanyukt raashtra ke siddhanton ke ulanghan main tha ke sawaal par nirbhar karata he

 unhone yah bhi kahana he ki bambaari abhiyaan kaaphi had tak slobodon Milosevic was responsible for the rule's removal and then a war crime lawsuit
 They think that these baton se koi bhi srbija par bambaari abhiyaan ke bina hota
 More familiar but know that the result is Albanian with Serb refugees sharnaarthiyon kii jagah thi logon ko or he ki kosovo ko ek sthir kshetra se dur he, srbija uchit main fail insurgencies or macedonia ke therepublic 
 The Serbs who were opposed to Milosevic and their Socialist Party of Serbia say however, that pashchim ke liye srbian log jo teen 1996-1997 kii sardiyon ke maheenon ke liye dainik pradarshan kiya Support failed and Milosevic had lost support long before the bombing
 Anything told that of Milosevic lokapriyata bambaari ke dauraan vruddhi hui
 Alternative explanation behind Prerna's bombing campaign china or rus sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad, jo donon ke suraksha parishad ke sthaayee sadsy hai or yah bhi ek To veto a resolution from a permanent member is enough to nullify a resolution but the proposal was vetoed

 a transformer or transformer is an electrical machine with no moving or rotating components
 vidyut upkarnon main sambhavtah transafarmar sarvaadhik vyapak rup se prayukt vidyut sashitr he
 It transfers electrical energy from one electric circuit to another circuit by means of conductors connected by electric induction
 transfarmar keval prayavarti dhara yaa vibhavaantar ke saath kaary kar saktaa he, ekadish ke saath nahin
 Transformers can be one-phase, three-phase or multi-phase
 yah sabhi vidyut mashiinon main sarvaadhik daksh mashin he
 In the modern era, the transformer has become an integral part of the electrical and electronic industries
 kisi transafarmar main ek, do yaa adhik vinding ho sakati hai
 The number of primary and secondary winding turns of two winding transformers and their potentials has the following relation: is sutara se spasht he ki primary voltata ke diye hue maan ke liye primary evam secondari vinding ke pheron kii sankhya kaa uchit chayan karke ham dwitiyak vinding main icchit vibhavaantar praapt kar sakate hai
 When the voltage of the secondary winding is greater than the voltage of the primary winding, such transformer is called the high transformer
 iske vipareet jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se kam hota he to aise parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 The main use of transformer is to convert electric power to high voltage or low voltage
 aisa karne se vidyut urja ke upyog main suvidha or dakshata aati he
 It is important to note that the ideal transformer does not generate energy or power, nor does it change power, nor does it change frequency
 parinamitra prayukt vidyut ke kshetra main Probably the most widely used vaidyut sashitr he
 All the credit for the predominance of the alternating current in the industries as compared to the direct current is only to the resultant
 yah aisa saadhitra he jo nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara ko ucch voltata kii nimna dhara main or ucch voltata kii nimnadhara ko nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara main parinamit karata he
 This result is accomplished with minimal loss of energy and without the aid of any moving part in the appliance
 100 volt kii 10,000 wat vidyutakti ke parinman ke liye 100 ampiore dhara aavashyak hoti he
 But only one ampere current at a voltage of 10,000 is sufficient
 at: duusari sthiti main pehali kii apeksha bahut hi kam vyasavaala or is kaaran sasta chaalak aavashyak hota he
 The conductivity of the transformer is based on a unique finding by Michael Faraday, according to which the induced conductor force in the circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux across the region bounded by the circuit
 saralatam rup main parinamitra main do alag alag kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinka chumbakeey paripath ek hi hota he
 The coil of the transformer is identified according to the direction of flow of power
 praathmik kundali ko prayavarti vidyudurja ke strot se jodate hai or dwitiyak ko lod se
 Energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil by electromagnetic induction
 adarsh parinamitra ke kriyasanchalan kii visheshtaayen hai : In practice, this ideal situation is unpredictable
 parinamitra kii praathmik kundali se judi sambharan voltata chumbakeey flux utpann karti he, jo parinamitra ke patlit crode se sambhddha hoti he
 The alternating voltage Ep connected to the primary coil of the transformer is expressed as the density Bm of the highest magnetic flux, the area a of the transverse section of the lattice core, the frequency f of the alternating current of the alternating current, and the number of naps in the primary coil
 : praathmik kundali main pravaahit dhara dwaara utpann prayavarti chumbakeey flux dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton ko bhi sambhddha karata he
 The difference between primary and secondary coils is only the number of wraps, so the effective value of the induced voltage in the secondary coil is prakaar praathmik or dwitiyak voltata kaa nimnlikhit anupaat praapt hota he: The number of wraps in the primary coil N1 is kept less than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2 when the voltage of the primary coil is required to increase
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai or praathmik kundali kii voltata yadi dwitiyak kii voltata se adhik he to praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sankhya N1 dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se badi hogi
 This type of transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 saamanyat: parinamitra kaa swaroop nimnlikhit baton se nirdhaarit hota he: The efficiency of a simple power transformer is very high at normal load, ranging from 90 percent in small units to 98 percent in large transformers
 saamaanya: pratishat main vyakt parinamitra kii dakshata ko is prakaar abhivyakt kar sakate hai : There is a difference in the instantaneous efficiency of the transformers and the efficiency throughout the day
 parinamitra ke niyantran kaa arth hota he nivesh voltata ke sthir rahane par purna lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata or bina lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata kaa sambandh
 When expressed as a percentage, control can be defined as: chote parinamitron ke liye niyantran 2 se 5 pratishat or bado ke liye lagbhag 1 pratishat ke kram kaa hota he
 The transformer mainly consists of two parts: 1) kor - jo kisi chumbakeey padaarth kii banaayi jaati he
 2) Winding - which is made of copper, aluminum or any other conductor wires or bus bar
 iske atirikt kuchaalak aadi bhi prayog kiye jate hai jo vinding ke pheron ko aapas main yaa kor se chhune se rokte hai
 Transformer oil is used in high voltage transformers which prevent sparks from exceeding breakdown strength and heat by cooling the core and coil
 parinamitra ko thanda rakhane ke liye tel ke alaava evam kai anya shitakon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he jaise pani evam gas aadi
