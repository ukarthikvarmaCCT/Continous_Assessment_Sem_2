 Its administrative headquarters is Stuck City

 The main language spoken here is Punjabi, while Urdu is often understood everywhere
 saath hi angrezi bhi adhikansh shahari kendron main samajhi jaati he
 Prabhukh administrative languages are Urdu and English
 shaiva darshan ke anusaar 36 tatva hai
 It can be understood by three main parts - shivatatv main shivatatv or shaktitatv kaa antarbhaav he
 Paramashiva is eclectic
 isi prakashrup ko shiv or vimarshrup ko shaktitatv kehete hai
 As has been said in the beginning, the euphoria of complete non-artificial ego is called discourse
 yahi sphurti vishwa kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke rup main prakat hoti he
 Without consultation or power, Shiva does not know his light
 shiv hi jab ant:sthit arthtatv ko baahar karne ke liye unmukh hota he, shakti kehalaata he
 There are three elements involved in learning: sadashiv shakti ke dwaara shiv kii chetana ahan or idan main vibhakt ho jaati he
 But the first vital remains spontaneously and the edemons remain untouched

 There is predominance of action in it
 shiv kaa paraamarsh he "ahan"
 The Sadashiva element is consulted by "ahmadam"
 ishwartatv kaa paraamarsh he "idamahan"
 The advice of pure science is "ego id"

 inhen "kanchuk" kehete hai, kyonki ye purush ke swaroop ko dhak dete he
 Through this, the powers of man become compressed or finite
 inhen ke kaaran jeev parimit pramaata kehalaata he
 The Maya of Shankar Vedanta and Trikadarshana is not the same
 vedant main maaya aagatuk ke rup main he jisase ishwarchaitanya upahit ho jaataa he
 In this philosophy, Maya is merely the embellishment of Shiva's independence, through which he expresses his splendor
 kala sarvakrtrutv ko sankuchit karke anityatv prasthaapit karata he
 Vidya brings kinshipism by narrowing omniscience
 raag nityatruptitv ko sankuchit kar anuraag laata he
 Kaal replaces eternity and establishes impermanence

 The creatures covered with these knives are called men
 prakruti mahatatatv se lekar prithvitatv tak kaa mul kaaran he
 The organism is bound due to faeces and faeces
 swatantry kii haani or swatantry ke agyaan ko aanav mel kehete hai

 When questioned in this way with the sentiment requested by Devarshi, Lakshmipati Lord Vishnu said that in ancient times a Brahmini lived on the earth
 brahmani mujhamen bahut hi shraddha evam bhakthi rakhti thi
 This woman used to keep all the fast for me
 ek baar isane ek maheene tak vrath rakhkar meri aradhana kii
 The body of the woman was purified due to the effect of the fast, but this woman never used to donate food for the Brahmin and the gods, so i thought that this woman would remain unimpressed even while living in the backyard, so i myself reached one day to take alms
 stri se jab maine bhiksha kii yachana kii tab usne ek mitti kaa pind uthaakar mere haathon par rakh diya
 i returned to my abode with that body
 kuch dinon pashchaat vah stri bhi deh tyaag kar mere lok main aa gayi

 khaali kutiyaa ko dekhakar vah stri ghabaraakar mere sameep ai or boli kii main to dharmaparayan hum phir mujhe khaali kutiyaa kyon mili he
 Then i told him that it was due to not donating food and giving me mud
 maine phir us stri se bataaya ki jab dev kanyaayein aapse milane aaen tab aap apana dwaar tabhi kholana jab ve aapako shattila ekadshi ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataaen
 The woman did the same and with the methods that Devakanya had said, Brahmani fasted on Shatila Ekadashi
 vrath ke prabhaav se uski kutiyaa ann dhan se bhar gayi
 Therefore, o Narada, believe that the person who fasts on this Ekadashi and donates sesame seeds and food gets liberation and glory

 God should be offered as a mixture of urad and til mixed khichdi
 raatri ke samay til se 108 baar uun namo bhagavate vasudevy swaha is mantra se havan karnaa chahie
 Donating sesame in six forms during this fast is very beneficial
 jo vyakti jitne roopon main til kaa daan karata he use utane hazaar varsh swarg main sthaan praapt hota he
 The 6 types of sesame donation Rishi has said are as follows: 1
 Bath with sesame mixed water 2
 Boil of sesame 3
 Sesame tilak 4
 Consumption of sesame mixed water 5
 Food of sesame 6
 Hole from til 
 in chizon kaa swayan bhi prayog karen or kisi shreshth brahman ko bulaakar unhen bhi in chizon kaa daan den

 There are many beliefs among Hindus regarding the origin of Ganga
 ek manyata ke anusaar brahma ji ke kamandal kaa jal ganga naamak yuvati ke rup main prakat hua tha
 According to another legend, Brahma washed the feet of Vishnu with reverence and collected that water in his kamandal
 ek teesri manyata ke anusaar ganga parvaton ke raja himavan or unki patni minaa kii putree hai, is prakaar ve devi parvati kii bahan bhi hai
 It is definitely believed in every belief that he was brought up under the patronage of Lord Brahma in heaven
 kai varshon baad, sagar naamak ek raja ko jaadui rup se saath hazaar putron kii prapti ho gayi
 One day King Sagara performed a ritual for the prosperity of his empire
 ek ashv us anushthan kaa ek abhinn hissaa tha jise indra ne irshyaavash chura liya
 Sagara sent all his sons around the earth to search for that horse
 unhen vah patallok main dhyanamgn kapil rishi ke nikat mila
 Believing that the horse was stolen by the sage Kapil, they insulted him and dissolved his penance
 rishi ne kai varshon main pehali baar apane netron ko kholaa or sagar ke beton ko dekha
 With this view, all of them sixty thousand were burnt to ashes
 antim sanskaar na kiye jane ke kaaran sagar ke putron kii atmaaen pret banakar vicharne lageen
 When Bhagiratha, the son of Dileep and a descendant of Sagara heard of this misfortune, he vowed that he would bring Ganga to earth so that its water would wash away the sins of the sons of Sagara and get salvation
 bhageerath ne ganga ko prithvi par laane ke liye brahma ji kii tapasya kii
 Brahma ji agreed and ordered Ganga to go to earth and from there to Pataloka so that the descendants of Bhagiratha could attain salvation
 ganga ko yah kaaphi apmanjanak laga or usne tay kiya ki vah puure veg ke saath swarg se prithvi par giregi or use baha le jaayegi
 Then Bhagirath panicked and prayed to Shiva to reduce the velocity of the Ganges
 ganga puure ahankaar ke saath shiv ke sir par girane lagi
 But Shiva ji calmly tied him in his shoes and let only his small streams come out
 shiv ji kaa sparsh praapt karne se ganga or adhik pavitra ho gayi
 Going towards Pataloka, the Ganges created another stream to flow over the earth so that the unfortunate people could be saved
 ganga ekmaatr aisi nadi he jo teenon lokon main bahati he-swarg, prithvi, tathaa pataal
 Therefore in Sanskrit language it is called "tripathga"
 bhageerath ke prayaason se ganga ke prithvi par aane ke kaaran use bhagirathi bhi kaha jaataa he; or dussahsee prayaason tathaa dushkar uplabdhiyon kaa varnan karne ke liye "bhagirathi praytn" shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Ganga is also known as Jahnavi
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki prithvi par aane ke baad ganga jab bhageerath kii taraf bad rahi thi, uske pani ke veg ne kaaphi halchal paidaa kii or jaahnu naamak rishi kii sadhana tathaa unke kheton ko nasht kar diya
 Enraged by this, he drank all the water of the Ganges
 tab devataaon ne jaahnu se prarthana kii ki ve ganga ko chhod den taaki vah apane kaary hetu aage bad sake
 Pleased with his prayer, Jahnu allowed the Ganges water to flow through his ear
 is prakaar ganga kaa jahnavi" naam padaa
 It is believed that like the river Saraswati, by the end of the Kali Yuga, the Ganges will dry up completely and with that this era will also end

 According to Hindu texts such as the Skanda Purana, the goddess Ganga is Kartikeya's stepmother; Karthikeya is actually a son of Shiva and Parvati
 parvati ne apane shaareerik dosha se ganesh kii chhavi kaa nirmaan kiya, lekin ganga ke pavitra jal main doobane ke baad ganesh jivit ho uthe

 The Hindu epic Mahabharata states that the Vasus cursed by Vasishta prayed to Ganga to become their mother
 ganga prithvi par avatarit huin or is shart par raja shantnu kii patni baniin ki ve kabhi bhi unase koi prashn nahin karenge, anyathaa vah unhen chhod kar chali jaaegi
 saat vasuon ne unke putron ke rup main janm liya or ganga ne ek-ek karke un sabko apane pani main baha diya, is prakaar unke shraap se unako mukti dilaai
 Until this time King Shantanu did not object
 antat aathven putr ke janm par raja se nahin rahaa gaya or unhone apni patni kaa virodh kiya, isliye ganga unhen chhodkar chali gayin
 Thus Dyus, born as the eighth son, survived by being trapped in a mortal body in human form and later became known as Bhishma, one of the most revered characters of the Mahabharata

 Finally they found the horse in Hades, which was tied to a sage
 sagar ke putron ne yah soch kar ki rishi hi ghode ke gaayab hone kii vajah hai unhone rishi kaa apmaan kiya
 The sage, who was under penance, opened his eyes after thousands of years and with his anger all the sixty thousand sons of Sagar were burnt there
 sagar ke putro kii atmaaen bhoot banakar vicharne lage kyonki unka antim sanskaar nahin kiya gaya tha

 Bhagiratha did austerity of Brahma to bring Ganga to earth

 Then Ganga said that when i fall on the earth from such a height, how will the earth be able to bear so much velocity? Then Bhagiratha appealed to Lord Shiva and he stopped the velocity of the Ganges in his open jatas, opening a braid, causing the incessant current of the Ganges to flow to the earth
 vah dhara bhageerath ke peeche peeche ganga sagar sangam tak gai, jahaan sagar-putron kaa uddhaar hua
 At the touch of Shiva, the Ganges became even more holy and the earth became a center of great reverence for the people
 puraanon ke anusaar swarg main ganga ko mandakini or pataal main bhagirathi kehete hai
 In the Bharata dynasty there was a great king named Shantanu
 ek din ganga tat par akhet khelte samay unhen ganga devi dikhaai padi
 Shantanu wanted to marry her
 ganga ne ise is shart par sweekaar kar liya ki ve jo kuch bhi karengi us vishay main raja koi prashn nahin karenge
 Ganga had seven sons one after the other from Shantanu
 parantu ganga devi ne un sabhi ko nadi main phenk diya
 The king did not ask him any question about it
 baad main jab unhen aathvaan putr utpann hua to use nadi main phenkane ke viruddh shantanu ne aapatti kii
 Thus his promise given to Ganga broke and Ganga canceled her marriage and went to heaven
 jate jate unhone shantnu ko vachan diya ki vah swayan bachche kaa paalan-poshan kar bada kar shantanu ko lautaa dengi
 a cheerful beautiful maiden was born to Brahmadeva's kamandal
