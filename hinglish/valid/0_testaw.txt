 Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting again scored heavily against the Indian bowlers, but off-spinner r Ashwin said that his team's bowlers are not under any psychological pressure and luck in the fourth and final Test match against Australia starting on Tuesday
 Neither supported India
 tippaniyan Australia, recovering from a poor start, scored 335 for three on the first day, leaving India's hopes of winning at least one match in the four-match series somewhat bleak
 clark (naabad 140) or ponting (naabad 137) ne ab tak chauthe wicket ke liye 251 ran jode hai
 Both of them had overcome their team in a similar manner in Sydney earlier
 aswin se jab poocha gaya ki kya in donon ke prati bhartiya gendbaajon ke dimag main koi manovaigyanik dabaav ban gaya he, unhone na main jawaab diya
 Ashwin, who took two wickets in the first session, said, 'I don't think there is a psychological bottleneck in our bowling unit
 aisa do test maichon hua he, pehle sidney or ab yahaan edilade main
 We now have to get two wickets early tomorrow morning
 ’ aswin kaa maananaa he ki bharat duusare satr main ran pravaah nahin roak paaya jisase vah pehla din apane naam karne main asafal rahaa
 He said, 'we were telling each other that in the second season we have to curb them
 yah behad mahatvapurn tha
 We gave them some easy runs and they caught the rhythm from there
 iske baad ran bananaa aasaan ho gaya
 ' australia ne lachar shuruyaat se ubarte hue pehle din teen wicket par 335 ran banaaye jisase bharat kii chaar match kii shrinkhalaa main kam se kam ek match main jeet darj karne kii ummid kuch dhoomil pad gayi
 Clarke (140 not out) and Ponting (137 not out) have added 251 runs for the fourth wicket so far
 in donon ne isse pehle sidney main bhi isi tarah se apni team ko sankat se ubaara tha
 When Ashwin was asked if there was any psychological pressure in the mind of the Indian bowlers towards these two, he replied in the negative
 pehle satr main do wicket lene vaale aswin ne kaha, ‘main nahin maanata ki hamaari gendbaaji ikai main iske prati manovaigyanik aadchan he
 Two such test matches have taken place, first in Sydney and now here in Adelaide
 hamen ab kal subah jaldi do wicket hasil karne honge
 Ashwin feels that India could not stop the run flow in the second season, failing to make it to the first day
 unhone kaha, ‘ham ek duusare se kah rahe the ki duusare satr main hamen un par ankush lagaana hoga
 This was extremely important
 hamane unhen kuch aasaan ran diye or unhone vahaan se lay pakad lee
 After that it became easy to score runs

 Advocate Purnima Bhatia, who is present on behalf of the Ministry of External Affairs, responded by saying, "the unmarried mother has to tell under which circumstances the child was born, whether she was raped or not, why she does not want to include her father's name
" 'mantralay ke isajawab par jajon ne aashcharya jataayaa

 uttarakhand main baari barish kaa red alert jari ho chukaa he
 It is raining so much as if everything is intended to be carried away as water
 jahaan puure pradesh ke sabhi pahari jilon main barish ne apana kahar barapana shuru kar diya he to vahiin pradesh kii rajdhani dehradun bhi isse achhuti nahin he
 9 houses in Silla village, located just few kilometers from the city, have been destroyed, while the huge temple of Lord Shankar has also fallen in the middle of the city
 pahaado kii rani musuri ke raste par bhi jameen dhans gai he jisaki vajah se ek trek ke pahiye mitti main hi jam ho gaye hai
 Overall, there is water everywhere from the mountain to the ground, which somehow makes everyone seem restless to take it in their arms
 pani kii isi bechaini ko dekhakar gaanv ke logon ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren ubhar ai hai
 But there is also a concern that the monsoon is just beginning
 abhi isi chintaa ko lekar pahaad jaisaa samay bilkul saamne khadaa he
 The rage has caused havoc even at a distance of just 15 km from the Chief Minister's residence
 yahaan 9 ghar jameendoj ho gaye hai
 The river took away the lifetime earnings of the local residents with them, and in this difficult time, not a single representative of the government and administration could reach them yet
 silla ko jodne vaali 200 meter se zyada kii sadak bah chuki he
 Due to which the contact of more than 20 villages has been completely cut off from the main road
 350 se zyada gharon ke log bas apni hi jagah par funskar rah gaye hai
 People whose homes are washed away are sitting in the homes of others somehow
 in majaboor gaanv waalon ke paas ab naa jameen bachi or naa hi chat bachi he
 Regional mlas rushed to the spot to say, but they did nothing but shine politics
 rashan dene kii baat to kii magar jinke ghar hi bah gaye ab wo karenge to kya karenge
 The villagers have imposed a special duty like this from the same area
 jahaan gaanv ke andar nadi vikaraal rup liye ghusane ko taiyaar he
 The people of the village have decided their duties
 nadi ke kinare khadey hokar pani kii teji ko parakhane kii
 The only reason is that if the water gets faster then somehow the whole village will have to be warned
 unhen bataanaa hoga ki sab bhaag kar kisi tarah se kisi surakshit sthaan par chale jaaen
 Apart from this, they have no choice because neither the Vikral river has any meaning with their concern, nor will the Uttarakhand government understand their compulsion
 shahar kaa haal bhi burahalaat shahar ke sabase vikhyath mandir tapakeshwar mahadev ke bhi bilkul vaise hi hai
 The rain has also knocked the temple
 saare raste todta hua pani sidhaa mandir ke andar tak samaa gaya he

 Celebrity management person has to take special care of the media as well as the celebrities of celebrity
 ek choti si khabar bhi bada bakheda khadaa kar sakati he
 You also have to pay attention to the top and back of the stage
 2
 Strong memory
 
 
 in managers ko is baat kaa vishesh khyaal rakhana padataa he ki celebrity kab or kahaan aaenge-jaaenge
 Whom to meet and how to meet
 unhen sari meetings kaa lekhajokha rakhana padataa he taaki kisi meeting kii taarikh va samay ek-duusare se na bhiden
 3

 Significantly, the most important and important thing for a celebrity is his image
 unhen is baat kaa vishesh khyaal rakhana padataa he ki celebrity kii image par koi aanch na aae
 He should not get into any kind of unnecessary controversy
 aisa hone se unke market vailu ko dhakka lagata he
 4
 har tarah se apadet rahanaa
 
 
 Staying updated here means that the managing person also has to take care of the celebrity's social media account
 koun si tasvirensoshal media acounteper jaaengi or koun si nahin
 Editing of videos and photos has to be taken care of

 janata parivaar main matbhed kii atakalon ke bich somvaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ek samaaroh main ek saath shaamil hue
 
 
 
 
 And the two leaders echoed each other in their respective speeches
 bhaashan dene kii pehali baari rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav kii thi or unhone sabase pehle logon ke saamne ye safai dene kii zarurat samajhi ki, unhone bhaang yaa ganja pikar nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banane kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he or ye bhi bataaya ki nitish kumaar hi unke gathbandhan ke mukhyamantri honge
 But Lalu Yadav asked the Hathi Bharatiya Janata Party that who is the candidate for your Chief Minister's post, you should mention his name, if you are not telling then it means that your party does not have any candidate
 lalu yadav ne apane hi andaaj main kaha ki bhartiya janata party bihar hathiyanna chaahati he lekin wo unka pasinaa chhudaa denge
 On the demand of making the report of caste survey public, Lalu Yadav, taking recourse to the data, asked that if the situation in the country is so bad then why is the BJP not making the figures public
 lalu ne taange se prachaar karne ke apane faisle ko sahi qaraar dete hue kaha ki unke paas philhal paise nahin hai isliye rath ke jawaab main tanga hoga
 In this tang, Lalu will play the tape in which the BJP leaders then used to tie bridges to praise his colleague Nitish Kumar
 lalu ne bijepi se kaala dhan waapas laane or yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene ke unke vaade kaa kya hua
 The comments lekin is kaarykram main lalu yadav ne mana ki bijepi ke prachaar tantra ke saamne wo log tik nahin pate or ve log lalu ke votaron ko bargala kar unhen apane kheme main shaamil kar lete hai
 But it is certain that Lalu and Nitish coming to the stage at this event will put an end to the speculation of differences between the two and the leaders of the two parties claim that next month the two leaders will hold joint programs together in many places
 bhaashan dene kii pehali baari rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav kii thi or unhone sabase pehle logon ke saamne ye safai dene kii zarurat samajhi ki, unhone bhaang yaa ganja pikar nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banane kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he or ye bhi bataaya ki nitish kumaar hi unke gathbandhan ke mukhyamantri honge

 karnataka kii raajnneeti main bijepi kaa sabase bada cheharaa bies yediurppa 3 baar soobe ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 Starting his political journey from the taluk president, Yeddyurappa reached the biggest political chair in the state
 vah 7 baar vidhayak rahe or ek baar loksabhaa saansad bhi chune gaye
 Apart from this, he has also been BJP state president and leader of opposition in the assembly
 bijepi ke sabase vivaadit netaa hone ke baavjood karnataka main vah party kaa sabase bharosemand cheharaa hai
 Early life Yeddyurappa was born on 27 February 1943 in Buchankere village in Mandmandya district
 unke pita kaa naam siddhalingappa or maa kaa naam puttathama tha
 BS Yeddyurappa's name is also associated with his father and village name and his full name is Buchankere Siddhalingappa Yeddyurappa
 jab vah chaar saal ke the tabhi unki maa kaa nidhan ho gaya
 He got his early education from Mandya and after that he went to Shikarpura to work as a clerk in a mill
 yediurppa jis chaaval mil main clerk the usee mil maalik kii beti se 1967 main unhone shaadi kii
 Later he opened a hard ware shop and started the business
 yediurppa ke 2 bete or 3 betiyaan he
 They had one son b
 vaai raghavendra 2 baar shimoga seat se loksabhaa saansad bhi rah chuke hai
 Yeddyurappa calls himself a follower of social reformer Basavanna
 raajnneetik safarkolege ke din se RSS ke sadsy rahe yediurppa ne apni siyaasi pari 70 ke dashak main sangh ke sachiv ke taur par shuru kii
 In 1975, Yeddyurappa was elected president from Shikarpura municipality
 isi dauraan jab centre kii indira gandhi sarkaar ne desh main apatkaal lagaaya to yediurppa bellari or shimoga kii jail main kaid bhi rahe
 He was then appointed BJP President of Shimoga District
 saal 1993 main yediurppa pehali baar shikarpura se chunakar vidhansabha pahunche or lagaataar 6 baar isi seat se chunaav jitate rahe
 The BJP lost the 1994 Karnataka Assembly elections and Yeddyurappa was elected Leader of the Opposition in the House
 1999 main yediurppa vidhansabha chunaav haar gaye lekin tab unhen party ne vidhaan parishad bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 In 2004, congress-jds formed the government and Dharam Singh of Congress was elected as the Chief Minister, during this time Yeddyurappa was also the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly
 pehali barise banemukhyamantrijedies ke kumaraswami ne dharam singh kii sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya, jiske baad congress-jedies kii sarkaar gir gai
 After this, in 2006 Kumaraswamy was elected Chief Minister with the support of BJP and Yeddyurappa was the Deputy Chief Minister in that government
 lekin jab gathbandhan ke tahat yediurppa ko mukhyamantri banane kii baari ai to jedies ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya or rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu kiya gaya
 However, in November 2007, the JDS agreed to support Yeddyurappa and then formed the BJP coalition government for the first time in South India
 yediuppa ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee lekin unki sarkaar 10 din bhi nahin chal saki
 After this, elections were held again in the year 2008 and for the first time the BJP formed the government on its own in the southern state and Yeddyurappa was elected the Chief Minister of the state
 is sarkaar ne puure 5 saal shashan kiya, haalanki yediurppa ko avaidh khanan maamle main lokayukta kii jaanch kaa saamana karnaa padaa or unki jagah 2011 main divi sadanand gauda ko mukhyamantri pad diya gaya
 In this government, Jagdish Shettar also got a chance to become the Chief Minister for 10 months
 bijepi chhod nai party banibijepi se naaraaz chal rahe yediurppa ne iske baad 2012 main party se istipha de diya or karnataka janata paksh ke naam se ek nai party kaa gathan kiya
 Subsequently in 2013, Yeddyurappa was again elected MLA from Shimoga
 haalanki isi saal unhone phir se bijepi main vaapasi kaa elaan bhi kar diya
 Yeddyappa's party merged with the BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shimoga loksabhaa seat se yediurppa ko 3
 Won by more than 5 lakh votes
 iske baad party ne 2016 main yediurppa ko phir se bijepi kaa pradesh adhyaksh niyukt kiya or 2018 kaa vidhansabha chunaav unheen kii aguwai main ladaa gaya
 But his party could not get a majority in this assembly election and a congress-jds coalition government was formed in the state
 yediurppa apni loksabhaa seat se pehle hi istipha de chuke the or 2018 ke up chunaav main shimoga se unke bete bi
 why
 raghavendra saansad chune gaye
 This time too, BJP has given him a ticket from Shimoga
 vivaadon se rahaa gaharaa natabhrashtachar ke aaropon main jail ja chuke yediurppa ko mukhyamantri kii kursi tak ganvaani padi thi
 Apart from this, he has been accused many times from illegal mining to bribery
 saal 2011 main unke khilaaf jameen par avaidh kabje ke aarope lage or karnataka lokayukta ne yediurpp ke par FIR ke aadesh jari kiye the
 In october-november this year, he also had to eat jail air
 haalanki baad main supreme court ne is maamle main ste lagaakar sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die the
 The latest case against Yeddyuppa is in 2019, in which he was accused of bribing senior BJP leaders
 yediurppa diary ke naam se charchit is cond main kendriya mantriyon samet bijepi ke bade netaaon ke naam shaamil hai
 The Income Tax Department, however, dismissed the case as a diary page forged
 lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh evam purv kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne ghoshnaa kii ki unki party bihar main rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kaa saath nahin chhodeygi or vahaan aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav vah rajd ke saath milakar hi ladegi
 Paswan bluntly said that Lalu Prasad Yadav's alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal was not the reason for his party's poor performance in Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki vahaan congress se chunavi gathbandhan na ho paanaa unke gathbandhan ke kharaab pradarshan kaa ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Paswan said that his party will contest the elections in Bihar in 2010, along with Lalu's RJD
 bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke maamle main shivasena netaa ramdaas kadam ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii gai he
 a police officer told here today that a case has been registered against the Shiv Sena leader under various sections of IPC and People's Representation Act on Tuesday evening
 kadam ke khilaaf ipisi kii jin dhaaraon ke tahat maamle darj kiye gaye hai, unamem dhara 153 main vibhinn samoohon ke bich dharm, nasl, janm sthaan, awaas, bhashaa aadi ke aadhaar par vaimnasy failaane tathaa samarasata banaae rakhane kii drushti se hanikaarak kaary karne tathaa dhara 153 (bi) ke tahat rashtriya ekta ke liye hanikaarak karrwai karnaa shaamil he
 Kadam is alleged to have made anti-muslim remarks at a rally in Bandra Kurla complex on April 21, just before the bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi addressed the rally
 chunaav ayog ke ek afasar mangalvaar ko bikasi police thane main aae or kathith bhadakaau bhaashan police adhikariyon ke sangyaan main laayaa gaya
 Kadam allegedly targeted the minority community over the 1993 Mumbai riots and said that Pakistanis beheaded Indian soldiers but the Indian Prime Minister did nothing about it
 unhone kaha ki yadi narendra modi pradhanmantri banate hai to vah chah maheene ke bheetar pakistan kaa khaatmaa kar denge
 Referring to the Azad Maidan riots in 2012, Kadam had said that the Muslims allegedly clashed with the police, set their vehicles on fire, desecrated the statues of the martyrs and molested women constables
 unhone saath hi kaha tha ki modi yah sunishchit karenge ki is prakaar kii karrwai ke doshi bachane nahin paaen
 The Shiv Sena has distanced itself from Kadam's remarks, saying that these are his personal views and this is not the stand of the party

 She could name it and distinguish it from other parts of the city
 lekin tab tak, use yah samajhaana lagbhag naammumkin tha ki aisi sari bastiyaan dilli naam ke shahar kaa hissaa hai, yaa dilli or kalakatta donon bharat naam ke ek desh ke hisse hai
 My daughter, for the first time, understood what India is when she learned to go to school and look at the map
 world map par bharat kaa aakaar dekhakar vah apane desh ko pahchaan leti thi
 We all probably learned to recognize India in the same way - from maps printed in NCERT books
 dhire-dhire hamane raashtra ke duusare pratikon ko bhi pahchaanana siikhaa - jhanda, sikke, or duusari chizein, jo hamen skool main padhai jaati thim
 
 
 
 or uske baad hamane siikhaa kitaabi, aadhikarik itihaas
 Akbar was good, Aurangzeb was bad
 prithviraj chouhan or shivaji mahaan the
 Gandhiji gave freedom from non-violence
 bhugol main hamane sikhi anekta main ekta, bharat ke vibhinn rajyon kii alag-alag bhashaaen, samskruti or poshaaken
 i remember, childhood homework, which required cutting and pasting charts bought from a neighborhood stationery shop into a notebook
 chart main chhapi hoti thim bharat ke prasiddh smarakon, swatantraaa senaniyon, dharmon or rajyon kii 'tipical' tasviren
 Even today, if i remember with my eyes closed, i can see the prints of hand-drawn portraits of that 'typical' Bengali and Tamil man, Gokhale and Tilak, Akbar and Shivaji, Jantar Mantar and Sanchi Stupa
 inhi tasveeron or chihnon se bani thi meri rashtrawaad kii samaj
 Thirty years later, the idea of nationalism in my daughter's mind is taking concrete shape with similar 'typical' pictures and symbols
 ham sab ke rashtrawaad aise hi chihnon, tasveeron, nakshon, naamon se banate hai
 At the same time, nationalism is understood by those things which are different from us, such as the names of languages of other countries, their food, their dress, their coins
 ye sab alag-alag tarah ke pratik or chihn hai, jo hamaare liye apane or paraaye kii vyakhya karte hai
 When Ujjwal Nikam used the symbol of Biryani in reference to Kasab, he was - knowingly or unknowingly - doing the same thing
 vah ek pakistani shaks ke liye ek pratik yaa chihn taiyaar kar rahe the, jo apana 'rashtriya' vyanjan maang rahaa tha
 This was the symbol of Biryani, which was then used to mark Pakistan when BK Laushali, a Coast Guard DIG, said that he wanted the Pakistani boats to be blown up, because 'we did not want to serve them Biryani'
 
 
 ' or yahi vajah he ki haafiz said se veda pratap vaidic kii mulaakaat par viechpi ne kaha ki 'said ke saath biryani khaanaa' deshbhakti nahin he
 Such words turn the word Biryani into a symbol, in which a food item is made a symbol of Pakistan and terrorism, but the target is neither Pakistan nor terrorism
 asli nishaanaa ghar main he - tathakthith biryani khaane vaale - bhartiya musalmaan
 Repeatedly speaking Biryani and terrorism together, Biryani is being transformed into a sinister word, and the pronunciation of the word reveals an image, a staunch man who can betray the nation for religion
 
 ve sab log, jo yah daleel de rahe hai ki biryani kii kahani gadhakar nikam ne sahi kiya, chaahe-anachaahe, yahi chhavi bana rahe hai
 We need to be careful with these images, because if we let them change the meanings of our everyday language, then one day it may also change our understanding of nationalism
 yah baat 7 farvari, 2009 kii he
 In the swimming pool lounge of Taj Samudra in Colombo, a troubled boy was wandering around while other members of the Indian team looked happy bathed in the moonlight
 team haalanki siries 4-0 se jeet chuki thi par ek match baaki tha or rabindra jadeja ke liye abhi sab kuch shuru hona tha
 In such a situation, his restlessness was understandable
 saathi khiladinnon suresh raina, praveen kumaar or rohit sharma ne unki dikkat bhampih ‘‘iske juuton ko lekar kuch problem he, tabhi thodaa pareshaan he
 "he had to step into one of Team India's big shoes anyway
" 2008 kii under-19 vishwacap vijeta team ke honhaar khilaadi se use bhartiya team main ek bharosemand alrounder kii kami ko puraa karne kii disha main ek lambii chalaang lagaani thi
 Jadeja scored an unbeaten 60 in his first match at number eight but failed to impress as a batsman who could bowl as well
 sitambar 2011 main antarrashtriya cricket se nau maheenon kii duuri ke baad jadeja ek baar phir nae hi the, ek gendbaaj jo acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar saktaa tha
 And now bowler Jadeja has made India proud by holding the number one rank since August in the ICC ODI rankings
 maninder singh, kapil dev or anil kumble ke baad chotii par pahunchane vaale ve sirf chauthe bhartiya hai
 Jadeja's economy rate surprisingly 3 since December 2012
 78 rahaa he
 He has taken 38 wickets in 22 matches, 12 of which he played on England pitches and played a key role in winning the Champions Trophy to India
 aise main captain mahendra singh dhoni ke chahete khiladinnon main unka shumaar hona hairat kii baat nahin
 There is something special in Jadeja
 revadi, jaddu, baapu jaise unke kai niknem hai
 Hobby of raising horses, pigeons, rabbits, fish and dogs, a desire to dress on his mustache, Rajputana lineage and other valuable things
 in sab vajahon se jadeja maidan ke andar yaa baahar bataur ek kirdaar apaar sambhaavnaaon vaale shaks hai
 His story is about the journey from gudri to red
 prerit karne vaali maa kaa janaa, atirikt paison kii khatir bachakaana nasamajhiyon ke chalate ipiel main ek saal kaa pratibandh or turant baad khiladinnon kii nilaamee main 60 lakh dollar kii jabardast keemat par bikna, jadeja kii jindagi par ek bestceller kitaab likhi ja sakati he
 Due to being shot in the leg, father Anirudh Singh Jadeja was unable to serve in the army and was forced to work in a private security agency
 phir bhi ve bete ko sena kii vardi main dekhne kaa sapana sajaate rahe
 But Junior Jadeja preferred to fly the ball like a ball by turning the bat instead of firing
 haalanki ek surakshakarmi kii maamuli kamai yaa patni lataben kii nurse kii aamadani, bete kii angreji ballon kii jarurat or do betiyon kii padhai ke liye kaaphi na thi par maa-baap ne bete kii khushi main hi apni khushi samajhi
 Jadeja was much closer to his mother, who was also his biggest fan besides packing lunches for him and taking him to play matches
 2005 main afat tut padi jab rasoi ke ek haadase main buree tarah jalane kii vajah se maa kii maut ho gai
 Jadeja understood his cricket career to be over
 par badi bahan naina ne nurse kii naukari kar maa vaali jimmedaari sambhaal lee
 By then, his reputation as an emerging cricketer had crossed the border of Jamnagar district
 unki ginati bharat kii under-19 team ke sambhaviton main hone lagi thi
 Once in 2010 there was an opportunity when he started thinking of giving up left-arm spin bowling
 us saal tii20 vishwacap ke ek mukaable main australian openar shen watasan or david warner ne unke do over main lagaataar chah chakke koote
 His place in the Indian team started to be in danger
 unhone madhyakram kii ballebaaji par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa man bana liya
 Jadeja, who was left out of the team before the 2011 World Cup, was shown the way by Saurashtra coach Debu Mitra
 mitra yaad karte hai, ‘‘maine usase kaha ki gendbaaji hi bhartiya team main uski vaapasi main madad karegi
 "jadeja worked hard to bowl the lone wicket for hours to improve bowling
" jadeja ke hi shabdon main, ‘‘maine mahasoos kiya ki mujhe line, length sahi rakhte hue bas over puraa karnaa hoga
 i knew that i had the ability to move the ball
 pich anukool hone yaa mauka padane par main flite main bhi parivartan laa saktaa hum
 i wanted to become a bowler who could fulfill his quota of ten overs
 main ek alrounder hum or kabhi-kabhi bhram ho saktaa he ki dhyaan aakhir kis par kendrit kiya jaae
 But during practice, i know clearly
 main apana samay do hisson main baant letaa hum or ek baar main ek par hi dhyaan kendrit karata hum
 When bowling, i am the leading bowler and while batting, i consider myself the main batsman
 ’’variyata kram main sheersh par pahunchane vaale pehle bhartiya gendbaaj rahe maninder singh kehete hai, ‘‘jadeja duniya ke number 1 gendbaaj? bahut-se log sawaal karte hai
 But you also have to see that they have done it
 unhone kuch anokhaa karne kaa prayaas nahin kiya he tathaa ve apni takat or kamajoriyon ko thik-thik jaanate hai
 He has not been able to satisfy me as a world class bowler in Tests, but he has also proved me wrong about his ability to bowl well
 ’’jadeja kaa sabase bada imtahaan jald hi hone vaala he
 In a possible tour of South Africa or New Zealand
 simit over cricket main jadeja kii kai morchon par upyogita sabhi ko pataa he lekin gharelu cricket kii apni saakh ko abhi unhen sabit karnaa he kyonki ve pratham shrenee maichon main teen tihare shatak thokane vaale ekmaatr bhartiya hai
 His achievement brought him into this special category and earned him the title of "sir Jadeja" like Sir Donald Bradman
 aaj ve kai brandon kaa vigyaapan karne vaale hai or apni pasand tathaa vibhinn tarah kii ruchiyon ke chalate vigyaapan jagat ke agle bade naam bataae jate hai
 They grow guava, mango, groundnut and cotton in their huge 8-acre farmhouse on the outskirts of Rajkot
 unhen apane chashmon or juuton se pyaar he or kapade pahanane ke maamle main ve bahut satark rahete hai
 On their horses named Saffron and Ganga, they ride with the charmed charm of a young man
 phir apni kaali hayabusa yaa safed e4 audi car kii raftaar jaanchane ke liye khud ko resar bvoy main badal lete hai
 Yet he does not do any unique stunts with his glasses and bikes
 dakshin ke star rajnikant ke saath apni tulana ko ve team ke saathiyon kaa ek majaak bhar bataate hai
 Some things only Rajinikanth can do
 baaki ke liye? sar rabindra jadeja maujuud hai naa! On Friday, separatist leader Yasin Malik was arrested in Srinagar

 The protests took place in the Mysuma and Gakadal areas adjacent to the commercial center Lal Chowk

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh(aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat in dinon jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main hai
 He has arrived here on a three-day tour since Tuesday
 is dauraan unhone sanghathan padaadhikariyon ke saath nae swayamsevakon kaa maargdarshan kiya
 The Sangh chief asked the pracharaks of Ranchi metropolis to expand the branches
 jisase sanghathan or majboot ho sake
 The Sangh chief also sent a message to those coming close to the Sangh for ambition that such people could not survive in the organization
 jo samarpit bhav se sanghathan, samaaj or desh ke liye kaam karte hai, vahiin yahaan tik sakate hai
 During the meeting, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat made the RSS volunteers aware of the difficulties of a campaign life
 kaha ki prachaarak banane ke liye bahut kuch tyaag karnaa padataa he
 Have to do meditation
 samarpit hokar desh ke liye kaam karnaa padataa he
 Special instructions to new volunteers Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat was most serious about new volunteers
 sangh pehali baar purnakalik swayamsevak banane waalon ko vistaarak kaa daayitv detaa he
 Sources reveal that due to the BJP being in power in the Center and most states, the Sangh is worried that the new swayamsevaks of the Sangh may not deviate from their original responsibilities and become political
 isliye sangh pramukh mohan bhaagat ne baithak main varisht padaadhikariyon se kaha ki ve daayitv dene se pehle achche se chaanbin kar len ki us swayamsevak kii prishthibhumik kisi he
 Avoid campaigning, maintain dignity, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat advised the RSS volunteers to avoid self-propaganda
 saath hi unhen aayojanon ke dauraan kisi netaa yaa sangh ke bade padaadhikari ke saath selfi aadi se bachane kii salaah di
 Said that a volunteer has his own dignity
 gambhirtha hi swayamsevak kii takat he
 He asked the senior officials of the Sangh to openly communicate with their juniors
 kanishtha prachaarkon kii har samasya kaa nivaaran karen
 New ideas emerge from the dialogue itself
 sangh pramukh ne swayamsevakon ko saamaajik parivartan laane kii disha main kaam karne kaa suzav diya
 Another fact has come to light in the suicide of a Dalit student in Hyderabad
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne kendriya shram mantri bandaaru dattatreya ke khat ke baad uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kochaar chitthiyaan likhithim
 Till date, all these four letters are there
 in chitthiyon main mantralay ne dattatreya ke khat kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 After this, questions on Dattatreya abound
 unke khilaaf rohit ko aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa cese darj kiya gaya he
 It was only after these letters that Rohit was evicted from the hostel
 infographic main dekhie kab likhi gai chitthiyaan
 
 
 Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya wrote a letter to Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani on 17 August 2015
 yah chittheybedkar students associationke sadasyon kii ore se kiye ja rahe pradarshan ke dauraan abivipi ke adhyaksh susheel kumaar ke saath kathith taur par dhakka-mukki kii ghatana ke baad likhi gai thi
 The university had told- In the letter of anti-national politics, the Union Minister had written that the campus of anti-nationalist and anti-national politics is going on
 jab yaqub memon ko faansee di gai thi to ambedkar students association ke chaatro ne pradarshan karke virodh jataayaa tha
 Acting on Dattatreya's letter, the HRD ministry ordered the university to form a panel, in which it was decided to suspend some students
 haalanki chaatro ke virodh ke baad visi ne faisla waapas le liya tha
 It is said that go anywhere in the world, in any country, in any province, the face changes face, languages change traditions, but humans remain the same
 ek jaise hi sukh-dukh, pyaar-nafrat kaa ehsaas
 The same desires, the desire for a quiet better life
 tibet jaakar mujhe bhi is par vishwaas ho gaya
 There have been reports about Tibet from outside more than inside Tibet, which we have been making our perceptions about this place
 haan main bhi
 It was definitely a thought i would go to Tibet, but it was just like those wishes about which we also think that it will never happen
 or vahaan jaakar report karne ko milegaa, ye to kabhi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Whenever there was a talk with the Chinese Embassy officials of Delhi, Tibet definitely came and they always said that you should go and see for yourself
 aam taur par ham tibet ke bare main kya sochate hai, ek ye behad khubasurat jagah he
 Two, China has taken over it and the condition of Tibetans is very poor
 kai jagah buddha bhikshuon ne khud ko jala liya he, virodh main
 Three, in such a situation, the 14th Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet and take refuge in India
 dharmashala main tibet kii nirvasit sarkaar chalati he
 But India now considers Tibet a part of China
 jab tibet jane kii ijazat hamen mili to ye sari chijen dimag main thim or hamane kai baar poocha ki kya kisi chiz kii reporting par koi bandish he, jawaab aayaa nahin
 You can understand how many things are going around in my mind because until i and my colleague Umashankar Singh boarded a plane going to Beijing
 mujhe bharosa nahin hua ki ham tibet ja paaenge
 The next day we were on Tibet's land after a four-hour flight from Beijing
 orport par bhale hi checking zabardast rahi ho, lekin jo logon kii bheed dikhi wo zarur bataa rahi thi ki yaa to pehle se paali hui dharanaen galat thim yaa halaat badal gaye the
 We had seen Beijing's Delhi-like heat and humidity and the influx of Chinese people was understandable
 european bhi acchhee sankhya main the
 Often, the arrival of tourists is a barometer of normalcy in any place
 lhasa ke bare main lagaataar sunate rahe the, pard bhi rahe the, jane ke pehle, lekin hamaara pehla padaav shanan prifecture tha
 The first thing to realize the difference is the condition of the roads
 chamchamati dhoop or chamchamati saaf acchhee sadaken
 The mind kept on seeing how much we keep grudging, teasing, cooking in our country after seeing this one thing
 khayr shanan main pehle ham ek gaanv main gaye
 The population of Tibet is small, so it is not that crowds are seen everywhere, but as happens in small places here, the camera wakes up
 bhashaa kii samasya thi, lekin bhav kii nahin
 Similarly, old women, laughing, hiding their faces, escaping from the camera
 vahiin, purush kuch shaq kii nazar se dekhte hue, kuch badi gambhirtha se or kuch bachche
 It was different, if anything, the villages - houses were built in a beautiful, Tibetan way
 par phir man ne kaha− chini ise model village bataa rahe hai
 At least this had to happen
 wo kya he naa ki yah meri pehali tibet yatra thi, to man main ye dwandv lagaataar tha ki jo saamne he, use maanu yaa jo ab tak sunate aae hai wo dhundhun
 In the subsequent journey, even the village which did not look so prosperous, but the Chinese authorities were clearly believing that only a third of the prefecture could be built on this pattern
 kai chizein dekhin iske alaava bhi
 The handicrafts center which was a bit to see, but i was shocked to hear that the things there are worth
 dimag main tulana lagaataar jari thi ki apane yahan itani tarjeeh di jaati aisa marketing hota to kya baat hoti
 90 per cent of the people there still trust Tibetan medical system and in the same way hospital has been built, money has been given
 dekh tibet rahi thi, lekin sandarbh bharat ke ek aam naagarik kii tarah apana gun dosha soch rahaa tha
 The journey from Shanan to Lhasa was also eye-opening
 ek taraf brahmaputra nadi, duusari taraf oonche-unche pahaad or bich main sarsaraati sadak− kabhi khule aasmaan ke neeche to kabhi pahaad ke bichombich bani surangon se hote hue
 i saluted this huge river, but also thought that the Chinese had taken care of you too
 saadh nahin liya to or kya he, trainon kaa, sadakon kaa jaal prakruti ke khadey kiye har chunauti ke baavjood
 If you believe that China has laid this trap to strengthen its hold on Tibet, then it must also be believed that money has been shed like water for this and Tibetans also benefit from it
 har tasviir ke do rukh to hote hi hai
 We also reached the open lhasa-shigatse railway line a week ago
 251 kilometre lambii ye train line chinghai−tibet rail line kaa hi hissaa he
 Right now only one train runs from here
 subah yahan se chalati he or shaam ko udhar se lautati he
 But, if the arrangement is such that even if the ride increases by a hundred times, then there will be hardly any problem
 itnaa kuch hone ke baad bhi jo ek chiz mujhe badi rochak lagi wo ye ki infrastracchar devlepment kii ye kahani yaheen par khatm hoti nahin dikhti
 As Delhi used to look like during the Commonwealth Games, the same scene was seen everywhere and buildings and roads are being built
 hamane is par chini adhikariyon se sawaal bhi kiya
 Asked whether such construction is not hazardous to the environment
 lekin pataa chalaa ki is jagah par nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran maanak kaaphi kathin hai
 Still it is a surprise
 duusari taraf lhasa he, jisaki kahani bilkul alag he
 It is like a tourist spot
 sadakon par bheed-bhaad chahal pahal
 And there was a lot of buzz in the markets due to the Shoton Festival, ie the festival of curd
 aage badhane se pehle aapako bataa don ki mol bhav main agar koi bharatiyon ko takkar de saktaa he to wo chini hi hai
 In this city, Potala Palace, which used to be the center of political power, and where all the Dalai Lama is buried until the 13th except the sixth or Norbulika which is a giant garden and where the Summer Palace or Summer residence of the 14th Dalai Lama
 sab aam logon ke liye khol die gaye hai
 Not only are they the center of attraction for tourists, they are also the center of faith for the common people of Tibet
 ankhen bhale hi kuch shikave karti hon baat zubaan par nahin aati
 There is complete freedom, to come here to worship, to show incense sticks and from this freedom, there is some comfort, there is some ointment on the wounds
 or shaayad china kii manshaa bhi yahi he
 One or two people ask us in broken Hindi and India and a smile comes on the face
 unke bhi hamaare bhi
 There is much more to be said
 lekin wo sab tasveeron ke saath hamaare khaas kaarykram main
 From the roof of the world

 The is disheartening
 Why not the Govt wake up by down-sizing the cabinet / their perks / salary ?the Indian Army, recognised worldwide for its dedication & utmost professionalism, should be given its due
 Reason of downsizing should be based on facts & figures & should not be arbitrary?


 Proud of our Armed Forces, one of the top five larger armies of the world
 
 
 Recent news of downsizing our great Indian Army on the name of “cost Cutting” is not desirable but rather objectionable

 ayodhya menram mandirbanane ko lekar shivasena ne ek baar phir bijepi par hamalaa bolaa he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray termed BJP as 'kumbhakaran' and said that he (BJP) needs to get up and build Ram temple in Ayodhya
 uddhav thakare ne kaha ki jo ram naam kaa lekar satta main aae wo ab pichley 4 saal se soe hue hai
 He said that the BJP is taking advantage of power, while Bhagwan is still living in exile
 ab har hindu kah rahaa he 'pehle mandir phir sarkaar
 Thackeray said that when the Babri Masjid was demolished, the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said that the Uttar Pradesh government and the BJP had betrayed him
 ab 25 varsh biit chuke hai or ab tak ram mandir nahin banavaakar hamen dhokhaa diya gaya he
 The promise of Ram temple was given in every election, but Ram temple could not be built despite the power of the Ram temple in the center and Uttar Pradesh
 prabhu ramchandra apni hi ayodhya main vanavaasi ban gaye
 Uddhav said that those who are asking about Shiv Sena's connection to Ayodhya have forgotten the history
 jab shivasainikon ne babari masjid ke gumbad ko dhahaaya tha or tabashivsenapramukh ne garv se kaha tha ki aisa karne vaale shivasainik hai
 Launch the construction of Ram temple before 2019, he said that the construction of the Ram temple after Babri fell, is an insult to Ram and Hindutva
 unhone kaha ki nyaayalay kaa bahaanaa dikhaava he, ram mandir kaa nirmaan adaalat nahin balki aaj kii sarkaar karegi, kyonki ram ke naam par tumne vot maange the isliye 2019 se pehle ek adhyadesh nikaalkar sidhe ram mandir nirmaan kaa shubharambh karo
 India registered a huge 76-run win against Pakistan in Adelaide
 iske saath hi cricket world cap main ab tak padosi mulk par team india kaa sabhi match jeetne kaa record barkaraar rahaa
 In this match 'sixers' of India's victory against Pakistan, India defeated Pakistan in every department
 gendbaaji ko pakistan kaa majboot paksh bataaya ja rahaa tha, par viraat kohli, suresh raina or shikhar dhawan ne isaki jamkar khabar lee
 Won the first toss and touched the 300 mark
 iske baad mohammad shami ke netritv main gendbaajon ne paak team ko kabhi bhi match main takkar dene kaa mauka hi nahin diya
 This is the sixth victory against Pakistan in the World Cup
 aaie najar daalate hai mukhya 6 kaarnon par
 
 
 1
 dabaav le duba pakistan kopakistan ne world cap main bharat ko aaj tak nahin haraaya tha
 Its pressure was shown on the players of the Pakistan team throughout the match
 chaahe gendbaaji ho yaa phir ballebaaji, dabaav ke kaaran pakistani team ke khel main dhar nahin najar ai
 It started with a toss
 sapaat pich par dhoni ne jaise hi toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya, pakistan puri tarah se dabaav main aa gaya
 Indian batsmen also showed a confident game
 shuruyaat main bade match ke pressure ko jhela or jaise hi lay main aae, pakistani team par akraman kar diya
 Although Pakistani bowling appeared to be in rhythm at the end of the Indian innings, it was not enough to win the match
 kuch aisa hi haal ballebaaji kaa tha
 Pakistan batsmen were unable to play openly in front of the huge target of 301 runs
 isaki mukhya vajah bhartiya gendbaajon kii sateek gendbaaji thi
 The bowlers lured Pakistan to one run each
 nateeja ye rahaa ki uske ballebaaj dabaav main wicket phenkate rahe
 CWC15 indvspak: Record Book 2 of Mahamukabale
 viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan or suresh renakohli kaa form kharaab he, pataa nahin
 
 
 Why keep Shikhar Dhawan in the team? Suresh Raina just runs in the IPL
 in sari aalochanaon kaa jawaab ek hi match main mil gaya
 Kohli's century innings brought coolness to the hearts of Indian cricket fans
 dhawan ne apni sadhi hui pari se bataa diya ve team ke liye kyon jaruri hai
 And Raina once told that his bat was silent for a few days, but he has not forgotten to bat
 is tikdi ne pakistan kii gendbaaji main jabardast sendhamari kii
 The three together contributed 254 runs to the Indian team's score
 34 ran par pehla wicket girane ke baad kohli ne pehle dhawan ke saath milakar pari ko sambhala, iske baad raina ke saath partnership main teji se ran banaae
 Ind vs Pak: Virat Kohli broke Sachin's record 3
 raftaar ne dikhaaya damaustralia daure par jin tej gendbaajon ke pradarshan ne bhartiya cricket phans ko sabase zyada maayoos kiya, ve pakistan ke khilaaf duusare rang main hi najar aae
 There was such magic on the field that the sight of the bowling card changed
 mohammad shami ne aage badhkar jimmedaari lee or umesh yadav va mohit sharma ne bhi unka khub saath diya
 Mohammad Shami took 4 wickets in his 9 overs, spending just 35 runs
 mohit sharma bhi kanjus nikle
 He took just 35 runs in 9 overs and took 2 wickets
 or umesh yadav ne ek hi over main do wicket jhatakkar pakistani madhyakram ballebaaji kii qamar tod di
 4
 mahendra singh dhoni kaa dhamaljaisa leader waisi team
 This saying fits Dhoni very well
 paak ke khilaaf mukaable main captain kool bhi agressive najar aa rahe the
 His strategy was clear
 yah jaanate hue ki hamaari gendbaaji kamjor he, unhone pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya
 That is, not only showed confidence in the batsmen, but also gave the bowlers the responsibility to play a big role
 kabhi bhi match ko apane haath se nikalne nahin diya
 As the Pakistani batsmen came under pressure, they kept the pressure on by constantly changing the bowling order
 saath main dhoni ne wicket ke peeche bhi jabardast keeping kii
 5
 aswin or jadeja kii jodi chal gaiaar aswin or rabindra jadeja ne is match main bhale hi tej gendbaajon kii tulana main kam wicket liye hon par unki gendbaaji main wo painaapan najar aayaa, jisaki team ko darkaar thi
 Both bowlers may have given 97 runs for the loss of 2 wickets in 18 overs, but their bowling in the middle overs did a tremendous job
 aswin ne to apane 8 over se 3 madan phenke, vahiin haris sohail ko out karke ek khatarnaak saajhedaari tod di
 Jadeja followed a dashing batsman like Umar Akmal to a score of zero
 6
 Pakistan's batting was flat, so the run was already decided
 pakistani gendbaajon ne bhale hi shuruyaat main khub ran lutaae, par aakhri paanch overon main sirf 27 ran dekar paanch bhartiya ballebaajon ko out karke unhone apni team kii joardaar vaapasi karai
 In such a situation Daromdar was completely on the batsmen
 par anubhav kii kami kahie yaa phir bade match kaa dabaav, pakistani ballebaaji puri tarah se lachar najar ai
 Younis Khan, who has so far scored runs for Pakistan in the middle order, was a shocking decision to open
 iske alaava koi bhi ballebaaj krij par tikkar khelnaa nahin chahta tha
 If boundaries are not being scored, then a single-double should be emphasized
 cricket kaa yah paath to pakistani ballebaaji puri tarah se bhul gaye the
 Except Misbah, not a single batsman applied to himself
 bade score kaa peechha karte vakt champion timen match ko aakhri over tak le jaati hai par pakistani ballebaaji ko dekh aisa prathit hua ki ve iske liye taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Yes, it has finally been decided that in order to overcome the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, its trump card ie Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be in the political arena
 saath hi khaas ranneeti ke tahat uski jhalak indira gandhi se jude kaarykram main hi dikhegi
 After all, Priyanka herself likes to be seen in Indira's image and Congressmen see Indira's image in her
 dilli main indira kii 100veen jayanti ke kaarykram se kyon nadaarad raheen priyanka?congress ne indira kii janmashti paradilli main teen kaarykram rakhe, lekin priyanka sab jagah nadaarad raheen
 If sources are to be believed, Priyanka's focus is solely on Indira and UP
 isiilie indira kii janmashti par 21 november ko elahabaad main hone vaale kaarykram main wo sonia or rahul ke saath najar aaengi
 Like Indira, Priyanka, who has a hairstyle, will try to have a glimpse of Indira on that day, in the same way Priyanka's dress will also be there
 aakhir kaarykram usee anand bhawan main hoga, jahaan nanhee indira ne janm liya tha
 PK and Azad tried to bring color, Congress strategist PK Priyanka wanted to make CM candidate, but when the Gandhi family refused, PK continued to convince Priyanka to campaign outside Rae Bareli and Amethi
 upi congress kaa prabharee banate hi gulam nabi aaazaad se upi congress ke kaaryakartaaon ne priyanka ko laane kii maang kii
 After which Azad spoke to Priyanka and told 'aaj Tak' that Priyanka is positive on getting out of amethi-rae Bareli to campaign
 vaise khud priyanka bhi pehle kah chuki hai ki bacchon ke bada hone par wo siyasat main entry kii sochengin or haal main unhone mana tha ki ab bachche bade ho gaye hai
 The gestures started with Rahul's visit to Deoria only in Delhi, before Azad said that Priyanka's attitude is positive
 phir bada subut tab mila, jab upi congress ke netaaon ko priyanka gandhi ke poster lagane kii anumati mil gai, wo bhi raibareli amethi ke baahar
 Yes, it was a condition that Priyanka's photo in the poster will not be alone and will not be bigger than Rahul
 5 kadam jo bataate hai ki rahul ke sahyogi kii hi rahegi bhoomikasonia or khud priyanka is baat kaa khaasaa khyaal rakh rahi hai ki unka role rahul ke sahyogi kaa hi rahe
 After all, everyone knows that Priyanka's arrival should not hurt Rahul's glare
 aakhir parivaar ne tay kar kiya he ki sonia ke baad party kii kaman rahul ke haathon main hi rahegi
 1
 isiilie priyanka ke poster lagane par shart rakhi gai
 2
 indira kii janmashti ke dilli ke sabhi kaaryakramon se bhi priyanka dur raheen
 3
 congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main rahul ko adhyaksh banane kii guzarish kii gai
 4
 rahul kii upi main kisaan yatra bade paimaane par yojit kii gai
 5
 dilli main sirf upi se jude netaaon se hi mulaakaat kii khabaren saarvjaanik kii gayi, jabaki priyanka parade ke peeche tamaam bade muddon par sakriy rahati hai
 The announcement of Priyanka's election programs, Sanjay Singh, the head of the campaign committee of the Congress and the President of the state, Raj Babbar Kemtabik, Priyanka has agreed to campaign in the whole of UP
 ab unka kaarykram banegaa, unki bhoomika final hogi, jisko chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone tak taiyaar kar liya jayega or chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke baad uskaa vidhivat elaan hoga
 But the answer to this question has to be found by the Congress when Priyanka comes, when the opponents ask if Rahul flopped in UP, which Priyanka has to bring
 gujarat main 10veen or 12veen kii pariksha ko lekar chintit chal rahe chaatro kii mushkil hal karne ke liye yahaan ek mandir ne nayab upaay pesh kiya he
 Here in the Panchmahal district, Karkabhanjan Temple is giving a pen to solve the problems of the students

 iske saath hi mandir prashasan ne yah sunishchit karne ke bhi upaay kiye hai ki ye kalam kisi 'galat haath' main nahin pade

 Gurugram police have so far been able to arrest the same accused in the case of beating the same family of a community in Gurugram
 aise main peedit parivaar khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa he
 At the same time, the villagers of the accused claim that their boys were beaten first and only then the case caught fire
 gurugram ke bhondsi ilaake main holi ke din sajid ke parivaar ke saath hui marpet ke maamle main police ab tak keval ek hi aaropee mahesh ko giraftaar kar pai he
 There is police protection outside Shajid's house but still the family is feeling insecure
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki ye ghar unke sapanom kaa ghar he
 In making it, not only did they get all the added money, but had to borrow several lakhs of rupees
 lekin guuruuvaar ko jo kuch hua use dekh kar unhen lagata he ki ye jagah unhen chhodana padegaa
 The victim's family is questioning the police action in this case
 peedit parivaar kaa kahana he ki hamalavar itane ugr the ki unhen jo dikhaa usapar unhone hamalaa kar diya
 An innocent child, who hid in the shelves in fear, was also beaten out of the cupboard
 itnaa hi nahin video banane vaali parivaar kii ladki danistha kaa kahana he ki agar unhen ye pataa nahin chalata ki iskaa video banaaya ja rahaa he to wo na jane kya kar jate
 The girl who made the video says that as soon as she came to know that a video of this attack was being made, she was in a position to attack him too, but the girl somehow escaped
 peedit parivaar kaa kahana he ki marpet ke video main saaf dikh rahaa he ki bheed kis tarah mahilaon or ghar main maujuud logon ko maar rahi he, patharav or todphod kar rahi he, 15 log ghayal hue hai jinamein 5 bachche bhi hai, ye video nahin hota to shaayad sachai saamne nahin aa paati
 The family appealed not to give the case an ethnic color
 vahiin, jis nayagaav ke ladakon par marpet kaa aarope he unke gaanv ke mukhiya badan singh kaa kahana he ki cricket ke jhagade main pehle unke gaanv ke ladakon ko peeta gaya uske baad maamle ne tool pakadaa
 The villagers say that this is a quarrel about cricket, it should not be given ethnic color
 ham police kii jaanch main puraa sahyog kar rahe hai
 According to him, there is no need for people from other parties to leave the house
 ham sab shanti se rah rahe hai
 It is probably the most difficult task in this world to fulfill the responsibility of parents
 bachche ko acchhee talim dene ke saath hi use ek acha insaan bananaa bhi maa-baap kii hi jimmedaari hoti he
 There are many such situations when parents have to be strict towards the child
 kai baar bacchon ko ye lagane lagata he ki unke maa-baap hi unke sabase bade dushman hai or kai baar maa-baap ko bhi ye lagata he ki unke bachche unakibilkul bhi parvaah nahin karte
 This is a difficult phase that can be dealt with very smartly
 maa-baap kabhi ye nahin chaahate hai ki unka baccha kuch bhi aisa kare jisaki vajah se use bhavishya main pachhataanaa pade isliye wo aksar kuch baton ko lekar sakht ho jate hai
 Along with giving love to the child, it is very important to be strict with them, but there are some things that should never be said to the child
 1
 When i was like you, it was a million times more responsible than you, it is a very wrong thing to compare your child to yourself
 baat-baat par apane bachche kii tulana karnaa sahi nahin he
 This will lower his morale
 use aap hi uske sabase bade dushman najar aane lagenge
 2
 tumhaara har faisla galat hota hsapane bachche ko uski galatiyon par tokna sahi he lekin usase ye kabhi na kahen ki wo jo kuch bhi karata he yaa karti he galat hi hota he
 With this, he will hide things from you or he will start lying
 3
 Why are you not like your siblings? It is not right to compare the child with his younger or older siblings
 aisa karne se baccha apane hi bhai-bahan ko apana dushman samajhnaa shuru kar degaa
 4
 mujhe akelaa chhod dobache ko galati se bhi ye na kahen
 When you say this, he may feel neglected or it may be that he goes into depression
 use lag saktaa he ki koi bhi uski baat sunne vaala nahin he
 5
 hamen tumhaari vajah se sharminda hona padaapake dwaara kaha gaya ye vaakya aapke bachche ke aatm-sammaan ko thes pahunchaa saktaa he
 It can also go into depression
 6
 Leaving her friends along, her friends are very special for a repeat child
 aise main agar aap kisi bachche se ye kehete hai ki uske dost kharaab hai or use unke saath rahanaa chhod dena chahie to aapaki ye baat bachche ko dukhi kar sakati he
