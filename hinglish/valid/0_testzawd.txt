 Bheemrao Ambedkar along with millions of his followers, revived Buddhism to India in the mid-20th century
 bhimrao ambedkar ke prabhaav se ek surveykshan ke anusaar san 1959 tak desh ke kareeb 2 karod logon ne buddha dharm ko grahan kiya tha
 Param is a series of indigenous supercomputers from India developed by C-DAC
 shrinkhalaa main naveenatam superkamputer param ishan hai
 Param means "supreme" in Sanskrit
 praudyogiki pratibandh ke parinamswaroop cre super computer se vanchit kiye jane ke baad, bharat ne swadeshi super computer or superkamputing praudyogikiyon ke vikaas ke liye ek kaarykram shuru kiya
 Supercomputers were believed to be capable of assisting with the development of nuclear weapons
 is kshetra main aatmanirbharta praapt karne ke uddeshy se 1988 main centre for deveopment of advanced computing kii sthapana kii gai
 Then Dr
 Vijay Bhatkar of Electronics Department was appointed as its director
 pariyojna 3 saal ke praarambhik ran or ₹30 karod praarambhik dhan ke saath shuru hui
 Some money was spent to purchase supercomputers from America
 1990 main, ek prototip kaa utpaadan kiya gaya or iskaa 1990 ke jurikh superkamputing sho main benchmark kiya gaya tha
 This superseded most other systems
 jisase america ke baad bharat ko duusare number par rakhaa gaya
 These efforts resulted in the ultimate 8000 existence
 jo 1991 main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 The Paramos 8000, released in 1991, used the Inmos T800 transporter

 The zygote or crustacea is a major division of arthropod fauna in the fauna, which consists of large crabs, prawns, chingats, pruning, mahachingt, khandavar, wood yucca and water animal, etc
, but to look for its smallest organisms, we have to resort to the microscope
 
 kathini kii bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke aakar prakaar main bahut hi antar hota he jis kaaran isaki sankshipt paribhaasha dena atyant kathin he
 Every symptom of difficulty, especially in its parasites and highly specialized creatures, changes completely in one way or the other
 crusteshia shabd kaa upyog prarambh main un jeevon ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jinka kavach kathor tathaa namya ho
 In contrast, other creatures are those whose armor is brittle, such as oysters and snails etc
 parantu ab yah gyaat he ki sab sandhipad jeevon kaa bahi:kankal kathor tathaa namya hota he
 For this reason, difficulty is now isolated from other symptoms
 is varg ke jeev praaia: jalanivaasee hote hai or sansar main koi bhi aisa jalashay nahin he jahaan inaki koi na koi jati na pai jaati ho
 Due to this difficult organisms often breathe through the reservoir or skin
 inamen do jodi shringika jaise avyav mukh ke saamne or teen jodi hanu mukh ke peeche hote hai
 The main familiar organisms of the difficult class are the prawns and crabs that humans use in their food form, but far less economic than these are the organisms Aphipadz, Isopidz, etc
, which act as mamers while living in groups in shallow reservoirs
 We do
 in nimna jeevon kaa bhojan duusare jeev tathaa vanaspatiyon kii tyakt vastuen hai or saath hi yah swayan ucch praaniyon, jaise matsay ityadi, kaa bhojan banate hai
 There are also many talapalvic microbes whose groups change the color of the ocean for miles, so that the fishermen get knowledge of proper fisheries
 is prakaar yah matsay kaa bhojan banakar or saath hi machhuon kii sahaayta karke aarthik laabh pahunchaate hai
 The armor of organisms of this class is divided into groups of segments in the same way as other arthropod organisms, but often some of these segments are also unified
 prayek khand kavach anguthi ke samaan hota he, jo apane agle tathaa pichley khand ke saath namya integument se judaa rahata he
 The dorsal band resembling the arc of each segment is called sternum, and both lateral parts of the tergum, which remain as the bandages, are called plura
 prayek khand ke sternam ke saath ek jodi ang jude rahete hai
 The last segment of the body, which has anus, remains limbless and is called a telson
 aadhunik kathini main koi bhi aisa jeev nahin miltaa jisamen prayek khand ek duusare se spashtatya pruthak ho
 For example, the shell of the body of the prawn body is undivided and oblong and is called carapace
 iske khandon kii sankhya kaa anumaan is bhaag ke saath jude avyavon kii sankhya se lagaaya jaataa he
 The number of combined volumes in this section is considered to be at least six, including the nightly sections
 is bhaag ko sir kehete hai
 When more than this section is included in this part, then the components of the subsequent segments are completely separate from the next elements
 sir ke peeche ke khandon ko sharir ke do bhaagon, vaksh tathaa udar main baanta gaya he, jinako unke vibhinn avyav ek duusare se pruthak karte hai
 But in the high tough malaconstraca etc
, the thoracic segments join the head
 tab is sanyukt bhaag ko shirsovaksh ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 In this way, the form of carapace is also found in many different types of difficult organisms
 yah brankiopoda or austracoda main bivalve kavach ke rup main sharir tathaa angon ko purnataya dhake rahata he, siripedia main yah maansal praavaar ke aakaar kaa hota he or ise pusht karne ke liye calsiumyukt patt bhi sthit rahete hai
 These are some of its special forms, but in the carapace of a simple rectangular form, all the sections of the thorax can be included in the head
 kairapes vibhinn kathiniyon main se praaia: sabhi main paaya jaataa he
 Only Anostraca are organisms that do not have carapace
 kathini ke sharir kii samparivartit charam seemaa iske parashrayi tathaa sthagit jeevon main pai jaati he
 Khandavars remain in their old age with their heads and also have a tendency towards radial symmetry due to their postponed life
 parashrayi jeevon main sharirkhand lupt ho gaye hai or sharir kaa aakaar bhi purna rup se parivartit ho gaya he
 An example of this is rhizocephala, in which the symptoms of difficulty, even the symptoms of arthropods, do not appear in old age
 kathini jeev mukhyat: jalanivaasee hai
 For this reason it is estimated that the body of the ancestor of this class was divided into equal segments and each pair had a pair of limbs attached to it
 inkaa prayek avyav prachlan, bhojanprapti, shwasan tathaa gyanagrahan aadi sab kaary saath-saath karata tha
 a similar system of ingredients has been considered in Trilobita, but this subclass has disappeared
 abhi tak adhunik kathini main kisi bhi aise jeev kaa pataa nahin chalaa jiske avyavon main ye chaaron kaary saath hote hon
 Its head parts are suitable for different special functions, but the components of the torso of Branchiopoda are similar and to some extent can be assumed to have all four functions
 anyathaa angon kii visheshta kathini main kai upayon se unnati kar gai he, kyonki yah vidit he ki jo ang kuch kathiniyon main ek kaary karte hai ve hi kisi duusari kathini main uske vipareet koi anya kaary karte hai
 The development within the difficulty is mainly based on the duty control of these organs
 chaahe kathini ke avyav kisi bhi kaary ke liye upyojit hon or unke aakaar main chaahe kitni vibhinnata kyon na ho, inaki banaavat mukhyat: dwishakhi hoti he
 The base circle of each component is diagonal and is called a sympod or protopodite and two branches endopodite and exopotide arise from its upper segment
 is prakaar ke mul aadhaarit avyav ko steenopodium kehete hai
 Such simple bifacial components are the copulatory posture of the copipod, the abdominal organs of Malacostraca, and similar organs are also found in the progenitor ovum, called noplius
 isi prakaar ke avyav duusare kathini jeevon main vishesh kaaryon ke liye vibhinn rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There are two types of eyes of difficulty, medium and combined eye
 ati saral madhyam netra nopleius or anek vayask kathiniyon main rahete hai, parantu mailocostraca main ye lupt ho jate hai or inamen sanyukt netra hi kaaryshil netra hote hai
 Combined eyes are often a pair, which are the descendants of some organisms and many are in one
 netravrunt ko sir kaa avyav mana gaya he, parantu yah sandehatmak he
 Because, in growth it emerges much later in other organs
 pratham shringikas, jo mukh ke saamne rahati he, duusare khand ke avyav maani gai hai
 It is unicellular in the genus Noplius and all subcastes, except only Malacostraca
 inkaa mukhya kaary samvedak he, parantu anek dimbhon or vayask kathiniyon main ye plavan ke kaary main bhi aati hai or anek nar shringika se maadaa ko pakadte bhi hai
 The perforations of the cement glands in Siropedia are on these ingredients, with the help of which their adults are suspended
 yadhyapi dwitiya shringika mukh ke aage sthit rahati he, tathaapi vastav main iskaa sthaan mukh ke peeche tha
 In Noplias, its place is on the side of the mouth and it helps in bringing the food towards the mouth
 iske shesh kaary pratham shringika ke samaan hote hai
 In Melacostraca, one of its branches is multi-faceted in shape and its function is only sensing, but the other branch is similar in shape to a flat plate and it also serves as a flattening of the float
 nopleius tathaa vayaska kopipoda, isopoda ityadi main adhohanu bhi dwishakhi hote hai or bhojanprapti main sahaayta karte hai, parantu bahuterey kathiniyon main adhohanu shaktimaan hanu kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai or inaki sataha daant or condon se susajjit hoti he
 The parasites resemble the drastic shund for the piercing of the tough
 upbhanjak tathaa upasambh, yaa pratham or dwitiya mexila, sadaa pattiyon ke samaan chapate hote hai or inke vrintopang par hanu kii shakhikaaye sthit rahati hai
 These three are the last Hanu of the mouth
 sir ke pechhevaale angon main brankiopoda, kopipoda ityadi main aapas main koi vishesh bhinnata nahin hoti or ye ang mukhyat: ek samaan hote hai
 Their shape is similar to that of Melakostraka's Upambhaka and Upajambha
 is prakaar ke avyavon ko fillopodia kehete hai
 But the parts of the torso of Melacostraca are divided into two parts - eight pairs of thoracic components and six pairs of abdominal organs
 ye ek duusare se purnataya bhinn hote hai
 The thoracic components are mainly used to speed up and for this reason their endopodides, which take a major part in this work, are transformed in the same way, but their exopodides, which are useful in flotation, have disappeared
 
 vaksh ke purv ek athwa do jodi avyav praaia: padahanu aakaar ke hote hai jis kaaran inhen anupaad naam diya gaya he
 The abdominal organs are always useful in biceps and flotation
 antim udarang ke sahyog se punch minapaksh kaa aakaar dhaaran karke jeev ko vishesh prakaar se ulatney main sahaayta detii he
 Most of the following hardy breathe through the ground, but the organisms whose outer skeleton has become more rigid do respiratory work in their bodies where the floor has been eroded, such as the lining of the carapace; Or this work is done by special senses, which are called Jalasvanika
 jalashvasanika vaksh yaa uske angon par sthit shakhikaaye hai jinka aakaar chapata hota he or jinaki sookshm bheeton ke bheetar rudhir pravaahit hota rahata he
 In Decapoda, the aqueducts are classified into three categories depending on their position - branching branches, branching branches adjacent to the breastbone, and the branchial mandibular interior that are covered with carapace
 thalanivaasee kathini, jaise kekade ityadi, vayushwasan ke liye anukulit hote hai-inke brakiyal mandal ke astr kaa tal fefdon kaa kaary karata he
 In other organisms, such as isopoda, wood, etc
, there are branchial air-filled ducts found in the colon, similar to the trachea of insects and other vertebrates
 kathiniyon main aaharanlee pratiprishth mukh se lekar ant tak purna sharir main sadaiv sidhi rahati he
 But there are some such creatures in this class in which it is also found neutered or coiled
 anya sandhipad jeevon ke samaan yah bhi teen bhaagon main vibhajit rahati he
 The foreskin and posterior intestines, whose holes are the mouth and anus, and whose inner floor is covered with chitin, which is attached to the outer body of chitin
 teesraa bhaag madhyantra he, jo in donon ke madhya main rahata he
 The muscles of the foreskin are strong and hair, thorns and teeth etc
 develop on their inner floor
 melacostraca main yah bhaag amashay banaata he, jisamen jathar, peshni tathaa chaanan upkaran khaadya rason ko kanon se alag karne ke liye vishesh saadhan rahete hai
 But ghee and filter are usually separate in cardiac and neural organs
 madhyantra ke agle sire par ek jodi yaa adhik yakrut unduk rahete hai jinka kaary avasorana tathaa srav hai or jinamein se shakha nikalakar yakrut bhi bana sakati he
 In the Decapoda, the liver gland makes all the necessary enzymes and also exploits substances deprived of its cavity
 isi main bhojan glikojan ke rup main sanchit hota he
 In some Decapoda, the mesentery is very small, due to which the alimentary canal is known only of the anterior and posterior bowel
 parashrayi kathini jeevon main aaharanlee yaa to nammaatr kii hoti he athwa uskaa bilkul abhaav hota he
 Like other arthropod organisms, blood flows to the body cavities and destinations even in difficulties
 hriday bhi anya sandhipadon kii bhanti aaharanlee ke prishthi hridayaavaran ke bheetar sthit rahata he
 In Branchiopoda, Astracada, and some Melacostraca, the heart is often equal to the entire length of the body, and in addition to the end section of the body, it has a pair of capillary blinds in each section, which goes through the cardiovascular system
 anya kathiniyon main hriday kii lambaai praaia: kam hoti he
 The arteries exit the heart and open in the bloodstream, from where the blood enters the heart through every part and part of the body
 rudhir ko oxygenyukt karne ke liye jalashvasanika isi bhaag main sthit rahati he
 There are also many difficulties in which there is no heart, such as Siripedia, Kopipoda, etc
 and in them blood is transported with the help of operation of the body and the abdomen
 kathiniyon kaa rudhir halakaa taral padaarth hota he jisamen leukosite mila rahata he or antomestroca main haemoglobin bhi upasthit rahata he
 The main excretory senses of difficulty are two pair of glandular and venous glands that open at the postures of the organs of the same name
 donon grathiyon kaa purna vikaas kabhi bhi kisi jati kii ek avasthaa main ek saath nahin miltaa, atev jivan ke itihaas main bhinn-bhinn avasthaaon main ek ke pashchaat duusari granthi kaaryshil hoti he
 For example, in the adult stage of prawns and other decapitals, the adenoid gland is functional and the uppermost gland in its ovum
 parantu adhiktar kathiniyon main iske vipareet dasha hoti he
 In this, the composition of these two glands is the same
 prayek granthi main teen mukhya bhaag hote hai : 1
 antasyun, jo dehguha kaa avshesh tathaa ksheen bhitawala bhitari bhaag he, 2
 utsargi nalika tathaa 3
 parivartit bahirgaman pranali, jo antasyun se judi rahati he or jiskaa ek bhaag granthman bhitawali utsargi nalika he
 Both the ventral and excretory system of the excretory tube grow larger and form the concentric bladder
 kendriya tantrikatantr kaa saamaanya rup bhi anya sandhipad jeevon kii bhanti hota he
 The brain coincides with the periparticular connective with the anterograde neuralgia
 pratiprushthiya tantrika rajju gucchhikaaon kii ek dohari shrinkhalaa he jinka apaas main yoga sanyojakon tathaa samamilon se hota he
 Usually four pairs of embryonic bundles form a brain together and the eyelet is also included in this
 kathini main tantrika tantra kii avasthaa main sandhipadon kii adarsh dasha se lekar atyant sankredic dasha tak kii purna shrenee milti he
 In the primitive Branchiopoda, the series of anterolateral flakes is staircase-like in some of the anilids and in which the two parts of the chain are separated from each other
 anya kathini samoohon main praaia: shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaagon kaa aapas main sanrohan ho jaataa he, saath hi, gucchhikaaye bhi ek duusare ke sameep aakar sayujjit ho jaati hai
 In the last state of this category, which is found in crabs, only a group of bunch appears
 swatantra tathaa karmanya jeevon ke samaan bahudhaa kathini main bhi ling pruthak hote hai, parantu siripidia tathaa anek parashrayi isopoda ke jeev dwillingi bhi hote hai
 They are precancerous in which the enlargement of the male organs precedes the female organs
 siripedia main sookshm sampoorak nar bhi parjiviyon ke samaan is jati ke saadhaaran athwa dwillingi jeevon ke saath praaia: chipke rahete hai, kyonki inke pulling ang purnroop se garbhaadhan nahin kar sakate
 In many Branciopoda and Astracoda, there is also non-reproductive reproduction
 langik dvirupata bhi inamen saamanyat: pai jaati he
 The male also has special organs to hold the female, which are converted from any part of the body and become useful for this task
 ucch dashapadon main nar praaia: stri se bade hote hai, parantu anya samoohon main vyavastha iske vipareet hoti he
 The gonads of both sexes always have a pair of umbilical senses, which are connected to each other on the back of the alimentary canal
 ye saadhaaran athwa shakhayukta bhi ho sakati hai or inase nalikaay utpann hokar sharir ke praaia: madhya se baahar kii ore khulti hai
 In the cirrpedia and some of the cladosira males, these holes remain at the boundary of the body, but in their female the holes are located on the first section of the thorax, and in Melacostraca also the holes remain in this place in both sexes
 kathini ke andjnan se jo dimbh bahulsankhya main uplabdh hote hai ve vayask se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 Before taking the adult stage, the organism has to cross a range of different ovules in which the first ovum is called noplus larva
 prayek kathini is avasthaa ko avashya paar karata he chaahe vah svachhand plavit avasthaa main utpann ho athwa bhrunit main
 In the typical state, the ovum is an unbroken oval, which contains three pairs of components and becomes the adult's antunculus, antennae, and mediobles
 iske pratham jodi dwishakhi hote hai or ye sab nopleius ko plavan main sahaayta dete hai
 Biennial ingredients also act to transport food to the mouth
 iske mukh ke saamne ek bada sa udoshth rahata he
 The three parts of the intestine of the ovum are the foregut, the mid-intestine and the posterior
 austracoda main nopleius andjnan ke samay samparivartit hota he, kyonki isamen bivalve caropes parivardhit rahati he
 In low-caste difficulties, Noplius changes gradually, in which the segments are added one by one, back to front, to the last segment
 tab in khandon main avyav utpann hone lagate hai
 In this way, its condition is changed to other forms
 Gymnopolyus, Cypris, Zoeia, Phyllosoma, Megalopa etc
 are notable
 adhiktar ye sari avasthaaen svachhand talaplavi hoti hai
 Only the pruning of fresh water and the prawns of rivers are such organisms whose growth does not change much
 is varg ke jeevon kii rachana main duusare virgon se kahin adhik anekarupata pai jaati he
 For this reason, their classification, in which special attention is paid to mutual similarities, is very complex
 is varg ko nimnlikhit upvargon main vibhajit kiya gaya he jinke saath unke mukhya ganon ke naam bhi ankit hai : Subclass: Branciopoda- gana : anostroca, notostroca, koncostroca tathaa cladosira 
 Subclass: Ostracoda- gana : miodocopa tathaa podakopa Subclass: Kapipoda- gana : cychlopidia, laraniopodidia, keligaida, kelenaida ityadi
 Subclass: bronchura gana : argulydia 
 Subclass: Siripedia- gana : thoracika, acrothoracika, ascothoracika, apoda tathaa roizosephala 
 Subclass: Melacostraca- vibhaag : fillokereeda -gana : nibenlieshi Department: sinkerida-ganes: Anaspedesia vibhaag : peracarida -gana : micidesia, kumesia, tanidesia, isopoda tathaa anfipoda

 Majeda is a village in Champawat district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Champawat tehsil of India
 nyamddal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Ibn Battuta Arab traveler, scholar and author
 uttar africa ke morocco pradesh ke prasiddh nagar tanjier main 14 rajab, 703 hi
 ko inkaa janm hua tha
 His full name was Muhammad bin Abdullah ibn Battuta
 ebn batuta musalmaan yatriyon main sabase mahaan tha
 He estimated to have traveled about 75,000 miles
 itnaa lanbaa bhraman us yug ke shaayad hi kisi anya yatri ne kiya ho
 During his visit India also came
 inke purvajon kaa vyavsaay kaajiyon kaa tha
 Ibn Battuta was very religious from the beginning
 use makke kii yatra tathaa prasiddh musalamaanon kaa darshan karne kii badi abhilaashaa thi
 To fulfill this aspiration, he left to travel at the age of 21 only
 chalate samay usne yah kabhi na sochaa tha ki use itani lambii desh deshaantaron kii yatra karne kaa avasar milegaa
 Traveling to pilgrimage places like maize is an essential duty of every Muslim
 isi se saikadon musalmaan vibhinn deshon se makka aate rahete the
 To facilitate the long journeys of these travelers, many institutions were born at that time in the Muslim world, by which all these facilities were available and their tourism became very interesting and enjoyable
 inhon sansthaaon ke kaaran daridr se daridr "haji" bhi dur-dur deshon se aakar haj karne main samarth hote the
 Ibn Battuta has repeatedly praised these institutions
 vah unke prati atyant kritagya he
 The best among them was the organization by which complete arrangements were made in advance for every kind of convenience of the largest passenger groups and their security was also arranged along the way
 prayek gaanv tathaa nagar main khaankahen tathaa saraayen unke thaharne, khaane pine aadi ke liye hoti thim
 Religious leaders were particularly welcome
 har jagah shaikh, kaaji aadi unka vishesh satkar karte the
 This institution of doctrine was a vivid example of Islam's brotherhood
 isi ke kaaran deshadeshantaron ke musalmaan bekhatke tathaa bade aaraam se lambii lambii yatraayen kar sakate the
 Another feature enjoyed by the medieval Muslims was that the entire trade in Africa and Indian seaports was in the hands of Arab merchants
 ye saudagar bhi musalmaan yatriyon kaa utana hi aadar karte the
 Ibn Battuta arrived in Mecca with a caravan to Damascus and Palestine
 yatra ke dinon main do saadhuon se uski bhent hui thi jinhone usase purvi deshon kii yatra ke sukh saundarya kaa varnan kiya tha
 At the same time, he pledged to visit those countries
 makke se ebn battoota iraq, iran, mosul aadi sthanon main ghumkar 1329 main dubaara makka lautaa or vahaan teen baras thaharkar adhyayan tathaa bhagavandabhakti main laga rahaa

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift

 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 murtipuja kaa shabdic arth he- murti kii puja karnaa
 It broadly means to have reverence for an idol, picture, statue or symbol
 shraddha yaa puja ke vichaaron ko darshane ke liye kisi bhi iken yaa chhavi ke istemaal ke virodh ko aniconism kaha jaataa he
 Destroying idols and images as a symbol of worship is called econoclasm, and has been accompanied by violence among religious groups who forbade idol worship and who have accepted signs, images and statues for worship 
 murti puja kii paribhaasha main abraham ke dharmon main ek chunauteepurn vishay rahaa he, kuch musalamaanon ne cross ke isai upyog ko messiah ke pratik ke rup main or kuch charchon main madonna ke rup main murtipuja ke rup main mana he
 The history of religions is marked with accusations and denials of idolatry
 in aaropon ne pratimaaon or chhaviyon ko pratikatmakataa se rahit mana he
 Alternatively, the subject of idolatry has been a source of disagreement between many religions or values of different religions, with the assumption that the markings of one's own religious practices have meaningful symbolism, while no other person has different religious practices
 Huh hindu dharm main, ek pratik, chitra, murti yaa murti ko murti yaa pratimaa kaha jaataa he
 Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smritism grace the use of the idol
 in paramparaon kaa suzav he ki samay ko samarpit karnaa or manviki yaa gaiyr-maanavkrishnik chihnon ke madhyam se aadhyatmikta par dhyaan dena aasaan he
 Verse 12
5 contains a Hindu scripture Bhagavad-gītā, which states that it is very easy to contemplate and fix the imperishable Absolute Absolute Brahman only in time and mind, and to pay attention to the qualities, qualities and aspects
 manushya kii indriyon, bhaawanaaon or dil ke madhyam se, bhagwaan kaa ek prakat pratinidhitiv, kyonki manushya ke swaabhaavik rup se tarika he
 An idol in Hinduism, says Jeanian Fowler - is a professor of special religious studies on Indian religions, he is not a god himself, it is an "image of God" and thus a symbol and representation
 ek murti ek rup or abhivyakti he, jiskaa arth niraakaar nirpeksh he
 Thus a literal translation of the idol as an idol is mistaken when the idol itself is understood as a superstitious end
 jaise vyakti kii tasviir asli vyakti nahin he, ek murti hindu dharm main ek chhavi he, lekin asli cheez nahin he, lekin donon hi maamalon main chhavi darshakon ko bhaavnaatmak or vaastavik mulya ke bare main yaad karti he
 When a person worships the idol, it is considered to be the manifestation of the essence or soul of the deity, the spiritual thoughts and needs of the devotee are meditated on through it, yet in Hinduism it is called Brahma - the ultimate reality
 This is not the idea
 bhagwaan ke saath pyaar ke gahare or nijee bandhan kii kheti par kendrit bhakthi prathaon ko aksar ek yaa ek se adhik murti ke saath vyakt kiya jaataa he or isamen vyaktigat yaa saamudayik bhajan, jap yaa gayan shaamil hai
 Acts of devotees, especially in major temples, are structured to treat the idol as an expression of the revered guest, and in daily routine the idol can be awakened in the morning and ensure that it is "washed away
" , Dressed, and garlanded
 " In Vaishnavism, the construction of a temple for the idol is considered an act of devotion, but non-murti symbolism is also common, where the fragrant tulsi plant or saligram is an official reminder of spirituality in Vishnu
 hindu dharm kii shaiva dharm parampara main, shiv ko ek mardaana murti yaa ardh purush aadhe mahila ardhanarishwar rup ke rup main prastut kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki ling-yoni rup main aainkan main hota he
 Worship rituals associated with the idol are in line with ancient cultural practices for a beloved guest, and the idol is welcomed, taken care of, and then requests to retire
 christopher jon fuller kaa kahana he ki hindu dharm main ek chhavi ko devtaa ke saath nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa he or puja kaa uddeshy divya he, jisaki shakti chhavi ke andar he, or chhavi swayan kii puja kaa uddeshy nahin he, hinduon kaa maananaa he ki sab kuch puja ke yogya he divya urja hoti he
 The sculptures are neither random nor intended to be superstitious objects, but rather are designed with embedded symbolism and iconographic rules, which set the style, proportion, color, nature of the images, their pose and legends related to the gods
 is
 vasusu upanishad ne kaha he ki murti kala kaa uddeshy ek paramatma param sarvocch siddhant par vichaar karne ke liye prerit karata he
 This text adds: chhaviyon ke chintan se prasannataa, prasannataa se, vishwaas se, drudh bhakthi se, is prakaar kii bhakthi ke madhyam se udai ho jaataa he ki ucch samaj jo ki moksh kaa shahi maarg he
 Without the guidance of images, the devotee's mind can ashtray and create misconceptions
 chhaviyaan juthi kalpanaaon ko dur karti hai
 It is in the minds of the sages, who have the strength to understand the creation's understanding of all manifestations
 ve apane alag-alag paatro, divine or amanviya, rachanaatmak or vinaashkari shaktiyon ko apane shaashvat antahkriya main dekhte hai
 It is the vision of the sage, who plays a vast drama of cosmic powers in universal struggle, which the founder made them the subject for his work

 Some Hindu movements established during the colonial British era, such as the Arya Samaj and the Satyamhima religion, rejected paganism erik reinders ke anusaar, chinh or murtipuja apane baad ke itihaas main buddha dharm kaa ek abhinn ang rahaa he
 There are images of Buddhists, Korea to Vietnam, Thailand to Tibet, Central Asia and South Asia building temples and statues, altars and stones, remains of amulets, images of religious rituals
 buddha kii pratimaa yaa avshesh sabhi buddha paramparaon main paae jate hai, lekin ve tibeti buddha dharm main un devataaon or devi-devataaon ko bhi prastut karte hai
 Bhakti has been a common practice in Thivada Buddhism, where Buddhist icons and group prayers are made for Buddhist symbols and especially Buddha statues
 kairell varnor ne kaha ki bhakthi tharavadaa buddha dharm main ek mahatvapurn abhyaas he, or kehete hai, "isamen koi andeh nahin he ki buddha dharm main gahari bhakthi yaa bhakthi / bhitti maujuud he or yah shuruaati dinon main shuru hui" According to Peter Harvey - a professor of Buddhist studies, Buddhist idolatry and idol worship spread throughout the Northwest Indian subcontinent and into Central Asia with Buddhist Silk Road merchants
 vibhinn bhartiya vanshon ke hindu shaskaon ne buddha dharm or hindu dharm ko chauthi se lekar 9veen shatabdi tak sangrakshit kiya, buddha chihnon or gupha mandiron jaise ajintha gufaaen or ellora gufaaen, jisamen buddha kii murtiyon thim
 Harvey, who was raided in the northwestern parts of South Asia by Muslim Tarse, from the 10th century, destroyed Buddhist statues in view of his religious dislike for idol worship
 is pratik chinh ko buddha dharm se joda gaya tha, bharat main is yug ke islamic granthon ko buddha ke rup main sabhi murtiyon ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 The desecration of the idols in cave temples continues during the 17th century, says Gerry Malandra, from the crime of "graphic, anthropomorphic images of Hindu and Buddhist temples"
 purv asia or dakshin purv asia main, buddha mandiron main pratik or pavitra vastuon kii sahaayta se puja aitihaasik rahi he
 For example, in Japanese Buddhism, butsu are integral to worshiping Buddha, and idolatry, which is considered part of the process of realizing one's Buddha nature
 yah prakriya dhyaan se adhik he, isamen paaramparik rup se buddha padri dwaara sahaayta praapt bhakthi anushthanon shaamil hai

 According to some scholars, 'accounting' is used in a wide sense
 iske teen ang ho sakate he : The process of writing transactions, ie the business part which can be called bookkeeping
 rachanaatmak kaary ko prakriya arthath saiddhanthik bhaag jise lekhankan kaha ja saktaa he
 The process of critical work, that is, the critical part, can be called audit
 pehle pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan ke kaaryon main vishesh antar nahin mana jaataa tha
 But in today's industrial age, both bookkeeping and accounting have become separate tasks
 saadharantah agralikhit kaary pustapaalan, lekhankan tathaa ankekshan teenon ke kshetra main aa jate hai : Bookkeeping - As is clear from the above point, bookkeeping is the art of accounting of business deals in journal and ledger
 hisaab-kitaab rakhane kii saadhaaran yogyata vaala koi bhi vyakti is kaary ko suvidha ke saath kar saktaa he
 This task is just to write mechanically
 lekhankan- uparyukt bindu ke anusaar lekhapal kaa kaary pustapalak ke kaary ke baad se prarambh hota he
 For this reason, it is said that accounting begins from where bookkeeping ends
 iske kshetra main shesh nikaalane se lekar antim khate taiyaar karne tathaa aavashyak bhul-sudhaar evam samaayojan karne ke kaary bhi aa jate he
 In short, work is the process of summarizing and analyzing
 saransh arthath talapat or phir iske vishleshan antim khate taiyaar karke kiya jaataa he
 The accountant is a well-educated person who is also clever in the work of bookkeeping
 uskaa kaary antim khate banaakar tarkpurna adhyayan karnaa hai
 According to various authors the definitions of audit are as follows: 1
 epa aar em di paula- ankekshan kaa arth chittha tathaa laabh-haani khate or unase sambandhit pustakon, khaaton tathaa pramankon kii jaanch karne se he taaki ankekshak apane aapako santusht kar sake or eemaandaaree se yah report de sake ki chittha niyamanusaar banaaya gaya he or vyapaar kii sahi tathaa thik sthiti ko prakat karata he jaisaa ki soochnaaon, spashtikarnon evam pustakon ke aadhaar par dekha gaya he jo use mili hai

 Montgomery - Auditing is the systematic examination of the books of an institution and the articles of deal so that the audit can verify the economic practices of the business and give its report regarding its results
 3
 larence aar dixi- ankekshan hisaab-kitaab ke lekhon kii jaanch he taaki yah spasht ho sake ki ve purnatah evam sahi rup se sambandhit saudon ke liye kiye gayi hai
 Also, it can be ensured that all the deals have been done officially
 ' 4
 Spicer and Pagler- "an audit of a number of books, accounts and certifiers of a business institution is called an audit, on the basis of which the auditor can say satisfactorily, based on the explanations and information received by him and which is revealed in the books
" According to him, the letter of the institution shows its 'financial condition' and the profit and loss account of the institution's profit and loss in true and true form
 yadi nahin to kin-kin baton se vah asantusht he or kyon
 ' 5
 josef lankaster- jaanch, pramann va satyaapan kii aisi prakriya ankekshan kehalaati he jiske dwaara chitthey kii shuddhta kaa pataa chalata he
 Thus, it can be conveniently said that there is a research of audit forms, certifiers and books of accounts from which books are written, in respect of the audit sheets and other prospectus which are made from these books, its report Give it to those who have appointed him to report
 ' 6
 Arthur W
 Holmes -
 'the audit is a scientific and systematic examination of the articles, certifiers, legal documents and other details of a public or private institution, whose purpose: 7
 ronaald e iris- 'vartmaan rup main ankekshan pustakon, pramankon evam anya aarthik va kanoonee lekhon kii niyamit or vaigyanik jaanch he, jisase vaastaviktaaon kaa sampaadan kiya ja sake tathaa laabh-haani khate se prakat shuddh aay or chitthey se prakat hone vaali aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main report di ja sake
 ' 8

 The purpose of this investigation is to find out whether the letter and profit-loss account of the organization created for a certain time reveals its true and correct position
 ' 9
 AW Hanson - Auditing of such articles is called auditing so that they can be believed and the details given by them can also be believed
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh rup me- Auditing is the specific and discreet examination of the books of account of a business organization, which is done by a qualified and impartial person with the help of certifiers, forms, information and explanations received from the institution, so that the auditor remains for a fixed time
 In relation to the accounting, we can report that, sanstha- ankekshan kisi bhi sanstha ke hisaab-kitaab kaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent person - The audit work should be done by someone who does not have any connection with the business or institution
 tabhi nishpaksh jaanch sambhav he
 Hence presently Chartered Accountants have been appointed
 jaanch kaa swaroop- ankekshan dwaara kii gayi jaanch sirf ganit se sambandhit shuddhta ko hi prakat nahin karti balki yah ek budhimattapurna nishpaksh jaanch he jo hisaab kii purna shuddhta darshaati he
 Accounting books - Auditing involves checking the books of account
 ankekshak ko apana kaaryakshetra sirf pustakon tak hi simit nahin karnaa hota he balki anya vaidhanik pustaken tathaa vibhinn tathyon kii jaankaree bhi kerani hoti hai
 Authenticators and Forms - Audit books are checked on the basis of certifiers and forms, if they are not available, they are confirmed by copies
 soochna evam spashtikaran- jaanch kaa aadhaar pramank hi hote hai phir bhi ankekshak yaaden pramank se santusht nahin he to len-denon kaa satyaapan karne ke liye suchnaayen tathaa spashtikaran maang saktaa he
 Intelligence - The work of investigation by audit is very important, so in this work intelligence and cleverness are required which is gained from the experience of this work
 jaanch kaa uddeshy- lekha-pustakon kii jaanch kaa uddeshy ek nishchit avadhi main banaaye gayi laabh-haani khate ke parinaamon ko evam ek nishchit tithi ko chitthey main darshaye gayi sampatti evam dayitvon kaa satyaapan karnaa he tathaa santushti par pramaan-patr dena hota he
 In fact, the auditor has to express his opinion on the examination of the final accounts
 niyamaanukoolta- bhartiya company adhinium, 1956 ke antargat company kaa chittha va laabh-haani khaataa banaate samay bhi kuch mahatvapurn niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Therefore, the company auditor has to write in his report whether the letter is the norm or not
 avadhi- ankekshan saadharantah ek vittiya varsh yaa ek lekha varsh ke lekhon kaa kiya jaataa he
 If the accounts of more than one year are audited, this investigation is called research
 parinaam- lekhon kii jaanch ke baad isaki satyata va auchity ke vishay main report deni hoti he
 If the auditor is dissatisfied with anything, it clearly describes it in his report
 lekhankan anivaaryta ke rup main vyaavhaarik rup main lekhankan kaa sambandh vyavsaay ko jivit rakhane ke liye tathaa samaaj main pratishtha praapt karne hetu anivaary hai
 The following arguments can be given for this: aaj ke yug main kisi vyavsaay se hone vaale laabh athwa haani kaa sahi-sahi gyaan bina lekhankan ke sammav nahin he
 If the financial condition of the businessman is strong and the financial resources are very good, then the sale is more as a result of selling cheaper than other businessman, but only after the bankruptcy, he will know that he has sold the item for less than the cost
 vyavsaay main len-dein adhik hote hai visheshtah jahaan udhaar par maal adhik bechaa jaataa he vahaan dendaaron ke naam yaad rakhana sambhav nahin he at: lekhankan anivaary hai
 Profit or loss at the end of a certain period
 iske liye lekhankan anivaary he
 If the professional accounting books are maintained properly, then the current year's income-expenditure or profit-loss can be compared to the profit-loss of previous years
 lekhankan ke madhyam se vyapaaree ko apni vittiya sthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Articles have great importance in assessment
 yadi lekhe niyamanusaar rakhe hon to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hote hai
 The total amount of money that a trader has to pay to a person can be obtained only from accounting
 alaabhprad kriyaaon ko chhodkar laabhprad kriyaayein prarambh karke adhik laabh kamaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yadi kaaryakshmata main kami he to unke kaarnon ko jaanakar unhen dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This work is possible only through accounting
 kisi vyavsaay main yadi uchit rup se lekha-pustaken rakhi jaati hai to us vyavsaay kii pratishtha badhati he
 Accounting also has the following benefits: lekhakarm vilasita ke rup main It is considered a luxury for small traders as they have limited requirements but at the present time it does not seem completely appropriate
 ankekshan vilasita ke rup main Still have to be used to hide the deceit in the accounts, which the auditor cannot catch despite proper cleverness and caution
 at: ankekshan nirarthak he
 On the basis of the above facts, we can say that audit is luxury in small business but it would be wrong for all businesses to call audit as luxury
 choti sansthaaon ke jahaan ek-do karmchaaree hai tathaa lekhakarm kaa kaary swami ekaaki vyapaaree yaa saajhedaar hi dekhte he at: ankekshan aavashyak nahin hai, lekin bade vyavsaay main yah laabhprad evam atyadhik aavashyak he, vilasita nahin
 No luxury of audit karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- ankekshan karwaane ke falswaroop karmchaaree kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki kaary thik se na karne par ankekshak dwaara truti pakadi ja sakati he ! Increased efficiency of employees - As a result of efficient audit, employees become efficient in their work because the auditor keeps on reporting and deficiencies in his report from time to time and also during the audit
 prabandhakon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- jab prabandhakon ko yah maaloom rahata he ki unke dwaara kiye gayi kaary par ankekshak apni report prastut karegaa jo ki sarvamaanya hogi to ve apana kaary purna eemaandaaree se karenge
 Assistants in the development of business - everyone believes in audited accounts and this increases the fame of business and provides facilities to the business from all sides which leads to the development of business
 diwalia hone kii dasha main nirnay sambhav- yadi lekha-pustaken thik prakaar rakhkar ankekshan karvaa rakhaa he to nyaayalay dwaara rin mukti aadesh praapt karne main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 In the absence of this, it may take longer
 bhavi yojana banane main sahaayak- prabandhak kai varshon ke antim khaaton ke aadhaar par tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hai tathaa yah dekhte he ki kaaryakshmata kis prakaar badhaayi ja sakati he
 Increase in plant and machine efficiency - The audit of cost accounts shows how much functionality the machines have and for what reasons the full functionality of the machines is not being used
 in kaarnon kii jaankaree praapt karkekaryakshmata ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Inevitability of audit ankekshan se kaaryakshmata par prabhaav padataa hai at: ise vilasita nahin kaha ja saktaa hai
 In the following situations it is mandatory - is prakaar yah kahana purnroop se satya na hoga ki lekhankan anivaary he or ankekshan vilasita hai
 Accounting is also a luxury in small businesses, while it is compulsory for large businesses
 kintu phir bhi lekhankan va ankekshan ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If there is no accounting, then whose audit will be done
 or lekhankan sirf akelaa ho to uski satyata kii vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Making errors is a part of human nature, the main purpose of audit is to detect and prevent inaccuracy and embezzlement
 ankekshak trutiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu praarambhik lekhon kii jaanch, jarnal kii jaanch, rocked shesh kii jaanch, khaaton ke sheshon kii jaanch, sahaayak bahiyon kii khatauni kii jaanch, gat varsh ke talapat se milan, antar kii raashi kaa pataa lagaana, talapat ke jod kii jaanch aadi kriya apana saktaa hai
 If the auditor used so much care, skill and intelligence in his work as was the case in those circumstances and he had done his utmost, which was absolutely necessary to find the errors
 yadi phir bhi kapat kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahaa ho to ankekshak ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa hai
 Auditing work never means that the auditor has insured the inaccuracies and embezzlement, nor does he guarantee that all the impurities and embezzlement will be found
 usase sirf yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apana kaary uchit saavdhaanee evam chaturaai se karegaa

 The credibility and adequacy of accounting records and other information should be checked using various methods to form an opinion on the financial statements
 is hetu ankekshak aisi pravidhiyon kaa paalan karata he jisase vah yah vishwaas dilaa sake ki vittiya vivaran kisi upkram kii vittiya sthiti va parichaalan parinaamon kii sahi va uchit chhavi prastut karte hai
 ' ankekshak apane peshewar anubhav va nirnayan kshamta se jaanch ke nishchit mandand tay karata he aisa karte samay usase yah apeksha nahin kii ja sakati ki vah apni dakshata kshetra se baahar jaakar kaary kare
 The auditor starts the work by setting limits to his work
 aisi do seemayen hai :-vistrut seemaa, gahan seemaa
 In the broadest range, the auditor decides how many behaviors to be audited, while in the deepest range it determines which behaviors to examine and how deeply to examine

 According to a school master from Badnagar, Narendra, though an average student, was keenly interested in debates and drama competitions
 iske alaava uski ruchi raajnneetik vishyon par nayi-nayi pariyojnaayen prarambh karne kii bhi thi
 At the age of 13, Narendra was engaged to Jasoda Ben Chamanlal and when he was married, he was only 17 years old
 financial express kii ek khabar ke anusaar pati-patni ne kuch varsh saath rahakar bitaaye
 But after some time both of them became strangers to each other because Narendra Modi had expressed something similar to them
 jabaki narendra modi ke jeevani-lekhak aisa nahin maanate
 He says: "un donon kii shaadi jarur hui parantu ve donon ek saath kabhi nahin rahe
 After a few years of marriage, Narendra Modi left the house and in a way his marital life was almost finished
 " After being silent on his marital status in the last four assembly elections, Narendra Modi said that he had not committed any sin by informing him of being unmarried

 However, Narendra Modi has submitted his affidavit and accepted Jasodaben as his wife

 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi
 Accession of Bahadur Shah II captain hodsan dwaara bandi banaaye gayi bahadur shah dwitiya First War of Indian Independence 2680 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of 2680 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Around 1590, Galileo made famous experiments on the motion of falling bodies on the basis of which Kepler's laws were established
 vaayu ke gharshan ko dhyaan main rakhkar vah is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki nirvaat main sabhi pind ek hi prakaar se, arthath ek hi twaran se, girenge
 He also discovered that all the bodies on the stationary plane plane move with the same acceleration and this acceleration decreases with the angle of inclination of the plane
 isse usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bina kisi avrodh ke gatisheel pind kshaitij samtal par achal veg se ruju rekha main chalegaa
 He proved the trajectory to be parabolic by assuming the velocity of the projections to be the result of the composition of horizontal constant velocity and constant accelerated vertical velocity
 in parinaamon or gallilyyon dwaara unki vishad vyakhya ke kaaran, gati ke bare main yah nayaa vichaar jad pakadta gaya ki gatisheel pind kaa twaran uski gati kaa vah ansh he jisaki nirdhaaran uski paribandh paristhitiyaan karti hai or yadi vah anya dravya ke prabhaav se sarvatha mukt ho jaae to vah ek ruju rekha main ek samaan veg se chalegaa
 This Gati Siddhantha is actually true for a body that is Bindu Vatva; But each material institution is organized with such particles which can be considered as microcosm for calculation
 gallilyyo or newton ke gaveshankaalon ke bich sabase adhik mahatvapurn khoj is vishay main higan ne kii
 He discovered the acceleration of the moving point in the curve and highlighted the nature of the centrifugal force
 jab ghadiyon se yah gyaat hua ki vibhinn akshanshon main pind vibhinn twaran se girte hai tab iskaa kaaran usne prithvi kaa bhraman bataaya
 He also compared the speed of oscillating oscillations
 is kaal main kathor pindon ke sanghatt par prayog kiye jane ke falswaroop yah sthapit ho gaya ki pindon ke dravyamanon kii tulana unke avasthitatv ke aadhaar par vahi he jo unhen taulne par hoti he
 Resistance of motion by objects is commonly called locomotion
 newton ne apane kaal main prachlit gati sambandhi vichaaron kaa samanvay karte hue gati ke vyapak siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 By applying this principle to all objects of the solar family, astrological facts were resolved to a high degree of accuracy and the basis of earth dynamics was strengthened
 isaki vyakhya newton ne apni princepia naamak pustak main kii he
 According to the acceleration of the falling bodies on Earth, he imagined the gravity between the celestial bodies and also included the acceleration in them
 is gati siddhant ke anusaar avasthitatv dwaara pradarshit dravyaman pind kaa moolbhoot gun he
 This mass always remains unchanged
 akashiya pindo ke dravyaman kii bhi gananaa is prakaar kii gai ki is siddhant se unki gati thik thik mil jaay
 Newton considered his measurement of time to be a non-linear measure
 saamanytah ghadiyon kaa uddeshy isi maap ko dena hota he
 Newton needed a basis for the kinetics of which relative speed could be calculated
 akashiya pidon ke liye yah aadhaar saura parivaar kaa dravyamanakentre or ve dishaaen maan lee jaati hai jo sthir taron ke saapeksh nahin badalatin
 The basis for earthly motion can be considered anything, but the motion is interpreted in such a way that Newton's laws fit
 is aadhaar ko saamanytah gallileey aadhaar kehete hai or iske saapeksh gati ko newton param gati kahata tha
 Any base moving at constant speed, without rotation, relative to the galactic base is the Galilean base
 jis prakaar do sparshi pindon ke bich daab or chubkeey aakarshan, athwa apakarshan, parsparik kriyaayein hoti he, usee prakaar newton ne bhi gurutvakarshan ko parsparik bal maanakar yah niyam sthir kiya ki kinhon do kanon ke bich ek aakarshan bal rahata he, jo unke dravyamanon ke gunfal kaa anulomanupati or unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa pratilomanupati he
 According to this rule all accelerations relative to the galactic base can be interpreted by equal and opposite forces between the particles
 is niyam kii pariksha prayogshla main is kaaran nahin kii ja sakati ki samaanya pindon ke liye yah bal atyant hi ksheen he, kintu iskaa jyotish satyaapan saral he
 By this rule Newton determined the mass of the Earth, which corresponded to other later determinations
 isi se usne saura parivaar ke grahon kii gatiyaan, chandramaa kii prithvi ke parit: gati, dhoomaketuon ke path or prithvi ke aksh kii gati ke kaaran vishuvon kaa ayan-siddhant, jowarbhata siddhant aadi bhi praapt kiye
 The Earth's irradiance caused by the Sun: The Newton Principle became irrefutable when the lunar eclipses were properly calculated
 19 veen shatabdi tak newton-siddhant ke saura parivaar sambandhi satyaapan hote rahe
 Although he was not as pure as possible, no defect could be drawn in this theory until 1915
 tab budh grah kii gati main ek choti si truti kii vyakhya, jo newton ke siddhant par nahin ho sakati thi, albert oinstin ne apane saapekshavaad siddhant ke aadhaar par kii
 70 years ago, when Varuni's knowledge of the pathos was discovered, Varun was discovered in an attempt to explain it
 budh ke bare main bhi aise hi ek grah kii khoj kaa kathin parishram kiya gaya, kintu safalataa nahin mili
 In the end it was established by the theory of relativism that Kepler's law for such a path so close to the Sun is not completely accurate
 san 1817 or 1922 ke suryagrahan sambandhi prekshanon se saapekshavaad dwaara praapt surya ke sameep taron ke visthaapan satya nikle
 Not only this, but this theory is also completely satisfactory from philosophical point of view
 aisi baat gurutvkarshan siddhant ke bare main nahin thi

 Abhaneri village is located just a few kilometers north of Sikandra town called the heart of Dausa district on the jaipur-agra National Highway
 puraatatv vibhaag ko praapt avasheshon se gyaat jaankaree ke anusaar aabhaaneri gaanv 3000 varsh se bhi adhik purana ho saktaa he, isi gaanv main sthit he "chaand baavdi"
 The initial name of the village of Abhaneri was "abha Nagri", but later its name was changed to Abhaneri
 chaand baavdi This Bawdi, built in the 9th century, was built by King Mihir Bhoj, and the name of this Bawdi was named Chand Bawdi after him
 duniya kii sabase gahari yah baavdi chaaron ore se lagbhag 35 meter chaudi he tathaa is baavdi main upar se neeche tak pakki sidhiyaan bani hui hai, jisase pani kaa str chaahe kitna hi ho, aasaani se bharaa ja saktaa he
 This 13-storey bawdi is more than 70 feet deep, with 1300 steps as a maze
 iske thik saamne prasiddh harshad mata kaa mandir he
 There are also some legends related to the construction of Bawdi, such that this Bawdi was built by ghosts and made so deep that even if something falls into it, it is impossible to get it back
 chandani raat main ekadam dudhia safed rang kii tarah dikhaai dene vaali yah baavdi andhere-ujaale kii baavdi naam se bhi prasiddh he
 This three-storey bawdi has a dance hall and a secret tunnel, as well as a later carpet pavilion at the top of it, which gives evidence of its long-term use
 isaki tah tak jane ke liye 13 sopan tathaa lagbhag 1300 sidhiyaan banaai gai hai, jo ki kala kaa apratim udhaaharan pesh karti hai
 This stepwell surrounded by pillared verandahs is square from all four sides
 isaki sabase nichali manzil par bane do taakhon par mahisasur mardini evam ganesh ji kii sundar murtiyan bhi ise khaas banaati hai
 It is also heard of the Bawdi tunnel that it was used by the king or soldiers during war or other emergency situations
 lagbhag paanch-chah varsh purv hui baavdi kii khudaai evam jirnoddhar main bhi ek shilaalekh mila he jisamen ki raja chaand kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The special thing of both Chand Bawdi and Harshad Mata Temple is that the stones used in their construction have been carved with magnificent carvings, as well as the images of all the 33 Koti deities of Hinduism are engraved on their walls
 baavdi kii sidhiyon ko aakarshak evam kalatmak tareeke se banaaya gaya he or yahi isaki khaasiyat bhi he ki baavdi main neeche utarane vaala vyakti waapas usee seedhee se upar nahin chadh saktaa
 Abhaneri is famous for the post-gupta era and early medieval monuments whose ruins are scattered here and there and spread out in the attack of foreign invasion
 jaisaa ki naam se hi vidit he ki harshad yani harsh se, khushi se, ullas se yani kii harsh evam ullas kii devi ko hi harshad mata naam diya gaya
 The devotees who come here say that whoever earns from the mother with true mind, his vow is fulfilled and he gets happiness
 is mandir kaa nirmaan bhi raja chaand ne hi karavaaya tha
 Situated on the double jagati, this east facing temple is built in the Mahameru style
 iskaa mandap evam garbhagrih donon hi gumbadakaar chhatyukt hai
 Statues of deities and Brahmins are built on its walls
 yahan shiv panchayat, hanuman mandir evam anya bahut se mandir bhi bane hue hai jo ki kala kii utkrushtataa ko darshaate hai
 Cement and lime have not been used anywhere in the temple's garbhagriha, which exhibits a classic example of Indian sculpture
 mandir ke thik saamne baavdi hone kaa matlab saafe he ki jo bhi vyakti mandir main pravesh kare, vah pehle apane haath-munh dhoe, uske baad mandir main pravesh kare
 And this is also the culture of our country that whoever is entering a religious place, their body and mind should be pure
 kabhi mandir main chah foot kii neelam pathar se bani hui harshad mata kii murti hua karti thi jo ki san 1968 main chori ho gai thi
 Talking to the local residents also shows that Mata used to warn in advance about the crisis in the village, so that the local residents were alerted and faced the problems properly
 aisa bhi sunne main aata he ki 1021-26 ke dauraan mohammad gaznavi ne mandir evam iske parisar main tod-phod kii tathaa murtiyon ko bhi kshatigrast kar diya tha
 Those fragmentary statues are still preserved in the temple and the Bawdi premises

 At present, both Chand Bawdi and Harshad Mata Temple are under the Archaeological Survey of India department, which have been protected by the Department by making iron meds from all around
 saath hi baavdi va mandir se sambandhit aitihaasik jaankariyon ke liye board bhi lagaaye gayi hai
 The most important thing is that the residents here also know the importance of Purva Sampada and the present idol of Harshad Mata, was made famous by the residents here

 Not only this, it is also said that Chand Bawdi, Aloida ki Bawdi and Bhandarej k Bawdi were all built in one night and all three are connected to each other through the tunnel
 kavy, kavita yaa padya, sahitya kii vah vidha he jisamen kisi kahani yaa manobhaav ko kalatmak rup se kisi bhashaa ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 The history of poetry and the philosophy of poetry in India is very old
 iskaa prarambh bharatmuni se samajha ja saktaa he
 Poetry literally means poetic composition or poet's work, which is duly tied in chains of verses
 kavy vah vaakya rachana he jisase chitt kisi ras yaa manoveg se purna ho
 That is, in which imagination and emotions are effected by the chosen words
 rasgangadhar main 'romantic' arth ke pratipadak shabd ko 'kavy' kaha he
 People also accept this symptom by understanding the elegance of the word under 'elegance of meaning'
 par 'arth' kii 'romaniyata' kai prakaar kii ho sakati he
 This symptom is not very clear from it
 sahitya darpanaakar vishwanath kaa lakshan hi sabase thik janchataa he
 According to him, 'the sentence is poetic'
 ras arthath manovegon kaa sukhad sanchaar kii kavy kii aatma he
 In poetry poetry there are three types of poetry, sound, quality satire and pictures
 dhwani vah he jis, main shabdon se nikle hue arth kii apeksha chipa hua abhipraay pradhan ho
 Qualified bangya is one in which there is secondary
 chitra yaa alankaar vah he jisamen bina byangy ke chamatkaar ho
 These three are also called Uttam, Madhyam and Adham respectively
 kavyprakashkar kaa jor chhipe hue bhav par adhik jaan padataa he, ras ke udrek par nahin
 Two more distinctions of poetry are made, epic and Khanda poetry
 mahakavy sargabaddh or uskaa nayak koi devtaa, raja yaa dhirodatt gunn sampann kshatriya hona chahie
 It should have any rasa pradhan from the adorned, heroic or quiet juices
 bich bich main karunaa; hasya ityadi or ras tathaa or or logon ke prasang bhi aane chahie
 There should be at least eight cantos
 mahakavy main sandhya, surya, chandra, raatri, prabhaat, mrugaya, parvat, van, ritu, sagar, sanyog, vipralambh, muni, poor, yajna, ranprayan, vivaah aadi kaa yathasthaan sannivesh hona chahie
 Poetry is considered to be of two types, visual and audio
 drishy kavy vah he jo abhinay dwaara dikhalaayaa jaay, jaise, naatak, prahasan, aadi jo padhane or sunen yogya ho, vah shravy he
 There are two types of audio poetry, prose and poetry
 padya kavy ke mahakavy or khandakavy do bhed kahe ja chuke hai
 There are also two distinctions of prose poetry - Katha and Akhyayika
 champu, virud or karambhk teen prakaar ke kavy or maane gaye he
 Generally, there are two distinctions of Sanskrit poetry - visual and audio
 drishy kavy shabdon ke atirikt paatro kii veshbhusha, bhavabhangima, akruti, kriya or abhinay dwaara darshakon ke hriday main rasonmesh karaata he
 Cinematography is also called 'metaphor' because it is decorated with the eyes
 shravy kavy shabdon dwaara pathakon or shrotaaon ke hriday main ras kaa sanchaar karata he
 In poetry, poetry, prose and champu poetry are included in the poetry
 gatyarthak main pad dhaatu se nishpan ‘padya’ shabd gati kii pradhanta suchit karata he
 Hence, there is a system of rhythm, rhythm and verses in the poetry
 pun: padyakavy ke do upbhed kiye jate hai—mahakavy or khandakavy
 Khandakavya is also called 'muktakavya'
 khandakavy main mahakavy ke samaan jivan kaa sampoorn itivrutt na hokar kisi ek ansh kaa varnan kiya jaataa he— They are also called 'gitikavya' in Hindi only because of their predominance of musicality along with poetry
 ‘geeti’ kaa arth hriday kii ragaatmak bhaavana ko chandobaddh rup main prakat karnaa he
 The soul of Geeti is Bhavatirek
 apni ragaatmak anubhuti or kalpana ke kavi varnyavastu ko bhavatmak bana detaa he
 In Gitikavya, personal experience is easily expressed by freeing it from poetic traditions and traditions
 swaroopat: geetikavy kaa aakaar-prakaar mahakavy se chota hota he
 With the help of all these elements, Sanskrit muktakavya is considered to be an excellent poem
 muktkavy mahakavyon kii apeksha adhik lokapriy hue hai
 In Sanskrit, Gitikavya is found in both Muktak and Prabandha forms
 prabandhatmak geetikavy kaa sarvotkrisht udhaaharan meghdoot he
 Most of the arrangements are written on the emulation of this song
 muktak vah hajisamen prayek padya apane aap main swatantra hota he
 Beautiful examples of this are Amarukashatak and Bhatruhrishtakatraya
 sangitamay chand madhur padaavalee geetikavyon kii visheshta he
 Adornment, policy, quietness and nature are its main contender
 nari ke soundarya or swabhaav kaa swaabhaavik chithran in kaavyon main miltaa he
 Sources of sermon, policy and public behavior are received in a very delightful way
 yahi kaaran he ki muktakaavyon main sukhtiyon or subhashiton kii prapti prachurtaa se hoti he
 The tradition of muktakavya is derived from the Vedic era in the form of spontaneous messages
 rugveda main sarama naamak kute ko sandesavahak ke rup main bhejne kaa prasang he
 Examples of Vedic muktakavavya are notable, such as the Sukta of Vasistha and Vamadeva
 ramayana, mahabharat or unke parvarti granthon main bhi is prakaar ke sfoot prasang vipul maatra main uplabdh hote hai
 Perhaps this sentiment has been in the form of encryption in the Shakodagars of Mahakavi Valmiki
 pativiyukta pravasini sita ke prati preshit shri ram ke sandeshvahak hanuman, duryodhana ke prati dharmraj yudhisthir dwaara preshit shrikrishna or sundari dayamanti ke nikat raja nal dwaara preshit sandesavahak hans isi parampara ke antargat gine jane vaale prasang hai
 In this context, the Bhagavata Purana's Venugita is particularly quotable, whose sultry image is inscribed on the Sanskrit Muktakayakas
 rajasekhar ne kavicharya ke prakaran main bataaya he ki kavi ko vidyaon or upavidyaon kii shiksha grahan kerani chaiye
 Grammar, dictionary, verses, and ornamentation - these are the four disciplines
 64 kalaayen hi upavidyaayein hai
 There are 8 sources of poetry - health, talent, practice, devotion, scholarly, polyandry, memento and raga
 mammat ne kavy ke chah prayojan bataaye hai- There is a very rich tradition of critics in Indian literature about what is poetry or poetry - from Sanskrit scholars like Acharya Vishwanath, Panditraj Jagannath, Pandit Ambikadatta Vyas, Acharya Shripati, Bhamah etc
 to enlightened poets like modern Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Jaishankar Prasad and modern Meera Mahadevi Varma of the era has expressed her views while clarifying the nature of the poem
 vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki maanav hriday anant rupatamak jagat ke naanaa roopon, vyapaaron main bhatakta rahata he, lekin jab maanav ahan kii bhaavana kaa parityag karke vishuddh anubhuti maatr rah jaataa he, tab vah mukt hriday ho jaataa he
 The word which the voice of man has been providing for the practice of this liberation of the heart is called poetry
 kavita manushya ko swaarth sambandhon ke sankuchit ghere se upar uthaati he or shesh sristi se ragaatmak sambandh jodne main sahaayak hoti he
 Numerous definitions of poetry are given
 ye paribhaashaayen aadhunik hindi kavy ke liye bhi sahi siddh hoti hai
 If poeticism makes the mind feel supernatural bliss, then the strings of the heart become tingling
 kavy main satyam shivan sundaram kii bhaavana bhi nihit hoti he
 The poetry in which all these things are found is considered to be good poetry
 kavy ke bhed do prakaar se kiye gaye hai– Depending on the form, there are two distinctions of poetry - audio and visual
 jis kavy kaa rasaswadan duusare se sunakar yaa swayan pard kar kiya jaataa he use shravy kavy kehete hai
 Such as Ramayana and Mahabharata
 shravy kavy ke bhi do bhed hote hai - prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy
 In this, a major story runs in the form of poetry from beginning to end
 katha kaa kram bich main kahin nahin tuutata or gaun kathaayen bich-bich main sahaayak ban kar aati hai
 Like Ramcharit Manas
 prabandh kavy ke do bhed hote hai - mahakavy evam khandakavy
 1- Epic In this, there is an autobiographical description of the entire life story of a historical or mythological great man
 mahakavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- 2- Khandakavya does not describe anyone's entire biography but only one part of life
 khand kavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- In this, only one verse or verse is able to reveal any emotion or rasa or story independently
 geet kavitt doha aadi muktak hote hai
 The poetry which Anandanubhuti realizes by seeing the act and listening to the narration from the characters is called visual poetry
 jaise naatak main yaa chalchitr main
 1- Verse poetry - In this, a story is described in poetry, like Gitanjali
 2- gadhy kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan gadhy main kiya jaataa he, jaise jaishankar kii kamayani 
 
 
 To compose poetry in prose, the poet gets freedom from the rules of verses
 3- champu kavy - isamen gadhy or padya donon kaa samavesh hota he
 Maithilisharan Gupta's 'yashodhara' is Champu poetry
 aadhunik hindi padya kaa itihaas lagbhag 800 saal purana he or iskaa prarambh terahavin shatabdi se samajha jaataa he
 Like every language, Hindi poetry was also chronological before
 yani kisi kahani ko lay ke saath chand main baandh kar alankaaron se sajaa kar prastut kiya jaataa tha
 All the ancient texts of Indian literature are written in poetry
 iskaa vishesh kaaran yah tha ki lay or chand ke kaaran kavita ko yaad kar lenaa aasaan tha
 At the time when printing was not invented and making many copies of documents was not easy, it was the best tool to remember important things at that time
 yahi kaaran he ki us samay sahitya ke saath saath raajnneeti, vigyaan or ayurveda ko bhi padya main hi likhaa gaya
 The oldest poems of India are in the Sanskrit language in the Rigveda which has a beautiful collection of verses written in praise of nature
 jivan ke anek anya vishyon ko bhi in kavitaaon main sthaan mila he
 King of the Madurai Nayak dynasty
 saamanyat: manushya kii bolne yaa likhane padhane kii chhandrahit saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa ko gadhy kaha jaataa he
 There is only partial truth in it because it ignores the creative perception of the prose
 saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa bhi gadhy tabhi kahi ja sakati he jab yah vyavasthit or spasht ho
 Keeping the creative process in mind, it would be more expedient to call prose a simple but systematic language of man or its specific expression
 manushya kii sahaj evam swaabhaavik abhivyakti kaa rup gadhy he
 Many things are the same in poetry and prose
 donon ke upkaran shabd hai jo arth parivartan ke bina ek hi bhandar se liye jate he; donon ke vyakaran or vakyarachana ke niyam ek hi hai, donon hi lay or chitramay ukti kaa sahaara lete hai
 According to Wordsworth there is no fundamental difference between the language of prose and verse
 lekin in sari samaantaaon ke baavjood kavita or gadhy abhivyakti ke do bhinn rup hai
 The disparity of their attitudes towards similar devices often emerges at the level
 lekin unamem keval stareey nahin balki tathvik yaa gunatmak bhed he, jiskaa kaaran yah hai ki kavita or gadhy jagat or jivan ke vishay main manushya kii maansik prakriya ke do bhinn roopon kii abhivyakti hai
 There is evidence of this in the history of his rise and development
 apni pustak ilugen and rielity main codwell ne kavita kii utpatti, saamaajik upadeyata or takanic kaa vistrut vivechan karte hue likhaa he ki sahitya ke sabase praarambhik rup main kavita manushya kii saadhaaran bhashaa kaa unmeshikaran thi
 At that time, poetry was not only emotional but also carried history, religion, philosophy, tantra, mantra, astrology, policy and pharmaceutical knowledge
 use unmesh pradaan karne ke liye sangeet, chand, tuk, maatra yaa swaraghaat, anupras, punrariti, roopak ityadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Later, the development of civilization, the classification of society, the division of labor and the enlightened literary consciousness also divided the earlier illustrious language — poetry limited itself to the illustrious language of ragas and science, philosophy, history, theology, policy , Fiction and drama adopted the language of ordinary behavior, namely, Kathaya
 aavashyaktaanusaar prayek shakha ne apni vishisht style kii vidhi kaa vikaas kiya, unamem aadan pradaan hua or unase swayan saadhaaran vyavhaar kii bhashaa bhi prabhavit hui
 Man's mental world began to reflect itself in two distinct forms of language - poetry and prose
 kavita or gadhy ke uddeshyon main bhed or bhashaa ke upkaran shabdon ke prati unke drushtikon main bhed kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 The poem originated with the collective labor of man
 shabd anivaaryt: sangeet or praaia: nrity ke sahare puure samooh ke aavegon ko ek bindu par sangathit kar kaary sampann karne kii prerana dete the
 The crop was not in front, the seeds had to be sown
 shabdon kaa kaary tha lahalhati fasal kaa mayavi chitra upasthit kar puure samooh ko beej bone ke liye prerit karnaa
 According to Codwell, words became power through this elusive creation
 kavita samuhik bhaavon or ankakshaon kaa pratibimb thi or unhen udbuddha or sangathit karne kaa asr thi
 Hence the poem's subtle narrative — not the object of its facts — but its proselytizing role in society — the object of its collective sentiments — is the truth of the poem
 saamaajik jivan main shabd vastunishth jagat ke shushk pratik maatr nahin rah jate balki unke saath jivan ke anubhav se utpann saral se jatil hote hue bhavatmak sandarbh jud jate hai
 The poem cannot ignore the pure symbolic meaning of the words, but its main purpose is the semantic organization of the emotional contexts of the words
 kavita shabdon kii nai sristi he
 In the words of Herbert Reid, the words are born again and again during contemplation in the poem
 anek bhashaaon main kavi ke liye prayukt shabd kaa arth srashta he
 The prose replaces the emotional references of words to their objective symbolic meaning
 gadhy main shabdon ke is prakaar ke prayog ko dhyaan main rakhkar herbert read ne gadhy ko nirmaanatmak abhivyakti kaha he, aisi abhivyakti jisamen shabd nirmaataa ke chaaron ore prayog ke liye eent gaare kii tarah bane banaae taiyaar karte hai
 It is clear that it is possible to completely divide the objective meaning of the word and its emotional context
 yahi kaaran he ki kavita sarvatha kathyshunya nahin ho sakati or gadhy sarvatha bhavashunya nahin ho saktaa
 There is a natural exchange in the techniques of poetry and prose
 kintu jahaan unke vishisht dharmon kaa bodh nahin hota, vahaan hamen kavita ke sthaan par foohad gadhy or padya ke sthaan par foohad kavita ke darshan hote hai
 Saying the language of objective truth does not mean that prose is less than poetry, or that its social purpose is less than poetry, or that it is an artful expression of language
 vastav main bahut se aise kaary jo kavita kii shakti ke baahar he, gadhy dwaara sampann hote hai
 It was realized long ago that rational development of ideas is not possible in the rhetorical language of poetry
 kavita se kam viksit avasthaa main bhi gadhy kii vishasht shakti ko pahachaanakar arastu ne apane prasiddh granth retoric main use pratiti parasuation, dusron ko apane vichaaron se prabhavit karne kii bhashaa kaha tha, jiske mukhya tatv hai-vichaaron kaa tarksangat kram, varnan kii sajivta, kalpana, chitrayojna, sahajata, lay, vyaktivaichitrya, ukti-saundarya, oj, sanyam
 At each of these points, the boundaries of poetry and prose seem to meet, but both of them have different ways of using them
 udaahranarth, unke do tatv, lay or chitrayojna, liye ja sakate hai jinaki bahut charchaa hoti he
 The rhythm of prose has more elasticity or diversity than the rhythm of poetry because the rhythm in prose is not a unit of thought, but of syntax
 kavita main praaia:
 The effect is intensified by repetition by making rhythm the unit of syntax
 kavita se kahin zyada gadhy main lay anubhuti kii vaani he
 Often the prose persona is inaugurated through rhythm
 kavita ke praan chitrayojna main basate hai, jabaki gadhy main uskaa prayog atyant sanyam ke saath vichaar ko aalokit karne ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 Regarding the great genre of English prose, Swift, Dr
 Johnson said: This wicked never takes the risk of even a metaphor
 mukhya vastu yah he ki gadhy main bhashaa kii sari kshamtaayen vichaar kii achook abhivyakti ke adheen rahati hai
 The freedom to embellish language in poetry is often the reason for the inadvertent tendency to use words and syntax
 visheshnon kaa jitna durupyog kavita main sambhav he utana gadhy main nahin
 Music in poetry is often a cover for cheap sentimentality
 gadhy main kathy kaa mahatv usapar ankush kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, the discipline of prose is the best means of realizing the beauty of language
 tii
 es
 iliyat ke shabdon main achche gadhy ke gunon ko hona acchhee kavita kii pehali or kam se kam aavashyaktaa he
 Prose began as the language of history, science, aesthetics etc
 baad main vah upyog se kala kii ore pravrutt hua
 Based on the development of forms, three broad categories have been created - descriptive, which includes fiction, history, biography, travel, etc
 vivechanaatmak, jisamen vigyaan, saundaryashasre, aalochana, darshan, dharm or nitishasre, vidhi, raajnneeti ityadi aate hai, evam bhavatmak, jisamen upar ke anek vishyon ke atirikt atmparak niabandh or naatak aate hai
 According to the subjects it is necessary to manipulate the volume of flow, clarity, pictoriality, rhythm, personal feeling, adornment etc
 in the prose, but walls cannot be erected between the prose lines
 lekhak kii ruchi or prayojan ke anusaar ve ek duusare main ant:pravisht hoti rahati he
 The novel has become a specialized laboratory of prose in the modern era
 kavita rah rahakar kaaphi dinon tak shabdon ke pathya par rahati he, gadhy main nae puraane, sookhe chikne sabhi prakaar ke shabdon ko pachaane kii adbhut shakti hoti he
 According to Bonami Dabri, all good living prose is experimental
 upanyaas gadhy kii is kshamta kaa puraa upyog kar saktaa he
 Such experiments have happened more in America than England and Wyndham Lewis, Hemingway, Stein, Faulkner, Andersen, etc
 have given new blood to English prose through their experiments
 gadhy main teji se kentul badalane kii shakti kaa anumaan hindi gadhy ke tej vikaas se bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalaanki uskaa itihaas bahut purana nahin
 Middleton Murry, an English critic, further pointing to the development of prose in the future, wrote: The extent of prose is infinite, and perhaps the neglect of poetry has made its possibilities less explored
 rani mukherjee ek bhartiya abhinetri hai jinhen bollywood filmon main unke abhinay ke liye janaa jaataa he
 He made his film debut in the Bengali film Beer Phool
 is film kaa nirdesan unke pita ram mukherjee ne kiya tha tathaa rani ne is film main sahaayak abhinetri kaa abhinay kiya tha
