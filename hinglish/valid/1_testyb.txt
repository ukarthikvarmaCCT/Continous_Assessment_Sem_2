 As the opening hours approached, the crowd became very restless and when the doors opened, the crowd moved swiftly, breaking the door and crushing a 34-year-old employee, killing the man
 aisa nahin lag rahaa tha ki kharidaaron ko us peedit vyakti ke anjaam kii koi chintaa thi, jab anya karmchaariyon ne hastkshep karne or ghayal karmchaaree kii madad karne kii koshish kii to bheed ne apni railempel ko yah shikaayat karte hue rokane se inkaar kar diya ki ve sardi main kaaphi samay se intazaar kar rahe the or ab intazaar nahin karnaa chaahate hai

 The notion that the next day of Thanksgiving marks the "official" start of the holiday shopping occasion is likely tied to the idea of the Santa Claus parade

 " fiqh islamic dharamshastra ko kaha jaataa he
 Fiqh has its impact on every aspect of Islamic life for Muslims
 jabaki shariat us samucchy niti ko kehete hai
 Which is based on Islamic legal, traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The basic component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law has been drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islamic nyaayashastra kaa itihaas "prathanusaar aath avadhiyon main vibhajit" kiya gaya he
 The sources of Fiqh in order of importance are: koran kai muddon par spasht nirdesh detaa he jaise ki anivaary dainik prarthana se pehle shuddhikaran anushthan kaise karen, lekin anya muddon par, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa hai ki akele koran hi chijen spasht karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 For example, according to the Qur'an — during the month of Ramadan, one needs to engage in daily prayers and fasting but Muslims believe they need more instruction on how to perform these duties
 in muddon ke bare main spashtikaran paighmbar mohammad kii paramparaon main paaya ja saktaa he, isliye adhikansh maamalon main daleelein koran or sunnat kaa aadhaar hai
 Some subjects in the early period of Islam are without precedent
 In those cases, Muslim jurists try to come to conclusions in other ways
 sunni nyayavid samudaay kii aitihaasik sahmati kaa prayog karte hai; aadhunik yug main adhikansh nyayavid bhi saadrishy or nae vishyon ke nafaa or nuqasaan kii tulana kaa upyog karte hai
 With the help of these additional tools, a wide array of laws are formed according to Sharia and this is called Fiqh
 is prakaar, sharia ke saamne, fiqh ko pavitra nahin mana jaataa he, or 'vichaar-prakriya ke vidyalayon' ke tafasilaat par anya nishkarshon ko pavitraapurna rup main bina dekhe hi asmaan vichaar hai
 This division of interpretation into more elaborate issues has resulted in different schools of thought process
 This broad concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of many laws in various disciplines that direct Muslims in everyday life
 shariat kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqh yaa fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born

 Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions as well, for two reasons there are tectonic faults and lava movements in volcanoes
 Such earthquakes can be an early warning of volcanic eruptions
 ek kram main hone vaale adhikansh bukamp, sthaan or samay ke sandarbh main ek duusare se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 If there is no such shock that can be clearly called the main shock, then the sequence of these tremors is called earthquake swarm

 It is similar to the latter shock but is the trailing part of the fault, these storms occur over a period of several years and many subsequent earthquakes are as damaging as the earlier ones
 This type of pattern was seen in Turkey in the 20th century, where a sequence of about a dozen earthquakes struck the North Anatolian fault, which are considered to be large clusters of earthquakes in the Middle East

 The next stage of the initial symptom of the disease is called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV or chronic HIV
 The second stage of HIV infection can last from 3 years to 20 years without treatment
 Normally this Charan shows few or no symptoms whereas at the end of this phase many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle aches
 Swelling or enlargement of the lymph glands is also seen within 3–6 months in about 50–70% of people
 Although most hiv-1-infected individuals have a detectable viral load, they eventually grow to AIDS in the absence of treatment, while in some cases CD4 + T-cells remain in the body for more than 5 years without antiretroviral therapy

 The risk of infection by using HIV infected blood is up to 93%
 In developed countries, the risk of HIV transmission from infected blood is very low because the HIV test of the person giving the blood is done before taking his blood
 In Britain, the risk is less than 1 in 5 million on average
 although, In low-income countries, only half the blood is properly tested before using it
 It is estimated that 15% of HIV infections in these areas are based on blood or blood products, which is 5–10% of global infections

 daulatabad maharashtra kaa ek nagar he
 Its ancient name is Devagiri
 
 The capital of Muhammad bin Tughlaq
 yah aurangabad jile main sthit he
 The city has always proved to be a center of attraction for powerful emperors
 daulatabad kii samrik sthiti bahut hi mahatvapurn thi
 It used to lie between North and South India
 yahaan se puure bharat par shashan kiya ja saktaa tha
 For this reason, Emperor Muhammad bin Tughlaq made it his capital
 usne dilli kii samast janata ko daulatabad chalane kaa aadesh diya tha
 But due to the poor situation there and the suffering of common people, he had to bring the capital back to Delhi after a few years
 bahan Devagiri is a famous historical city in South India which is nowadays called as Daulatabad
 maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main 20 degree uttar akshansh tathaa 75 degree purv deshaantar main sthit he
 It was settled in the 11th century by a king named Bhilam and from that period Hindu rulers ruled Devagiri for two hundred years
 14veen sadi se yah nagar musalamaanon ke adhikaar main chalaa aayaa
 After Aurangzeb died near Devagiri, the district came to be called Aurangabad
 mathura ke yadav kul se devgiri ke hindu shaasha sambandh jodate hai jis kaaran yahan kaa rajvansh 'yadav' kahalaaya
 In 'bhatkhanda', composed by Hemadri, and based on records, the fortified is considered the first historical man of the Yadav dynasty of Devagiri
 bhilam shaktishaalee naresh tha jisane hoysal, chol tathaa chalukya rajyon par safal akraman kiya tha
 His successor Singhan gave it the form of an empire
 yuddh ke falswaroop devgiri rajya khandesh se anantpur tak tathaa pashchimi ghat se hyderabad tak vistrut ho gaya
 The name of the 13th century Devagiri Naresh Krishna is found in many articles
 isane vansh kii pratishtha kii abhivruddhi kii
 Devagiri was invaded by Sultan Alauddin of the Khilji dynasty under the rule of Krishna's son Ramchandra
 allaudin yahan se asankhya dhan lootakar le gaya or uske senapati kafoor ramchandra ko bandi bana liya
 After some time Ramachandra was freed
 yahi kaaran tha ki devgiri ke raaj ne telangana ke yuddh main kafoor ko hathiyaaron kii madad di thi
 Shakaradeva increased his enmity with the Muslims after he ascended the throne, which resulted in Kafur defeating Sankardeva and seizing Devagiri
 devgiri kaa naam mohammad tughlaq ke saath bhi sambadhit he
 He removed the capital from Delhi and established it in Devagiri and returned from Delhi
 devgiri kaa durg aaj bhi dakshin bharat main prasiddh he or sthaneey kshatriya durg main sthapit devipratimaa kii puja puraane hi utsaah se karte hai

 This fort is located on the top of a hill 13 km from Aurangabad in the state of Maharashtra
 is main kai mat hai- Daulatabad is also known as Devagiri
 This fort is built by the king 'bhillam' in the 11 century
 It is one of the strongest forts in India
 yah teen majila he
 It was the same as the royal residence
 haalanki, yahan masjid or snaan jaisi suvidhaon tak pahunchne main kathinaayee he, -it was not the primary Mughal residence, nor was it a house on a permanent basis but rather its remote and scenic location suggesting this place / fort was for occasional use by royal family and court members
 daulatabad main bahut si aitihaasik imaaraten hai jinhen zarur dekhnaa chahie
 These buildings include Jama Masjid, Chand Minar and Chini Mahal
 aurangabad se daulatabad jane ke liye privet tathaa sarkari basen mil jaati hai

 itanium 64-bit intel microprocessron kaa ek parivaar he jo intel itanium architekchar ko lagu karata he
 Intel has placed it in the processor market for enterprise servers and high performance computing systems
 itanium architekchar kaa armbh havelett-packard main hua tha, or baad main ise sanyukt rup se havelett-pacurd or intel dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 Itenium-based systems have been produced by HP and many other manufacturers
 2008 main, x86-64, power architekchar or espiearasi ke baad itanium enterprize-class system ke liye chauthaa sabase aam microprocesar architekchar tha
 In February 2017, Intel released the current generation, Kittson, to test customers, and began shipping in May
 yah itanium parivaar kaa antim procesar he
 In 1989, HP determined that low instruction set computing architectures were approaching one instruction clock cycle limit per cycle
 echpi shodhakartaaon ne ek nae vaastukala kii jaanch kii, jise baad main spashtikaran samaantar nirdesh computing naam diya gaya, jo procesar ko prayek ghadi chakra main kai nirdesh nishpadit karne kii anumati detaa he
 EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word architecture, in which a single instruction word consists of multiple instructions
 echpi ke anusaar, ipiaisi ke saath, sankalak pehle se nirdhaarit kar letaa he ki koun se nirdesh ek hi samay main nishpadit kiye ja sakate hai, isliye microprocesar keval nirdeshon ko nishpadit karata he or samanaantar main nishpadit karne ke nirdeshon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye vistrut tantra kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 This approach has two goals: to enable deeper inspection of code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to reduce energy consumption by simplifying processor design and eliminating the need for runtime scheduling circuitry
 to do
 echpi kaa maananaa tha ki microprocessron ke vikaas nijee enterprise system companiyon jaise khud echpi ke liye laagat-prabhavi nahin tha ki, isliye aaie-64 vaastukala,, jo ipiaisi se praapt hui thi ke vikaas ke liye 1994 main intel ke saath bhagidaari kii gayi
 Intel was poised to make a huge development effort on the IA-64, resulting in the microprocessor being used by manufacturers of the majority of enterprise systems
 echpi or intel ne 1998 main pratham utpaada, marcid, ko vitarit karne ke lakshya ke saath ek bada sanyukt vikaas prayaas shuru kiya
 During development, Intel, HP and industry analysts predicted that the IA-64 would dominate servers, workstations, and high-end desktops, and eventually root out all general-purpose RISC and complex instruction set computing architectures
 compake or silicon graphics ne alpha or emypies architekchar ke or vikaas ko aaie-64 ke liye migrat karne ke paksh main chhodane kaa faisla kiya
 Several groups ported the operating system to this architecture, including Microsoft Windows, openvms, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, True 64 Unix, and Monterey / 64
 baad vaale teen bazaar pahunchane se pehle radd kar die gaye the
 By 1997, it was clear that the IA-64 architecture and compiler were more difficult to implement than originally thought, and Merced's delivery deadline slipped
 takneekee kathinaaiyon main vyapak nirdesh shabdon or bade kaishon kaa samarthan karne ke liye aavashyak bahut ucch transistor gananaa shaamil thim
 There were also structural problems within the project, as the two halves of the joint team used different methodologies and had somewhat different priorities
 chunki marcid pehla ipiaisi procesar tha, isliye vikaas ke prayaas main team ke aadi hone kii tulana main adhik apratyaashit samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Furthermore, the EPIC concept relies on compiler capabilities that have never been implemented before, so more research was needed
 intel ne 4 oktober 1999 ko procesar, itanium ke aadhikarik naam kii ghoshnaa kii
 Within hours, the name Itanic was used on Usenet News Group, pointing to the RMS Titanic, a "non-sinkable" ocean liner that sank on its first voyage in 1912
 "itannic" kaa upyog aksar register dwaara kiya jaataa he, or anya, yah darshata he: itanium main bahu arab dollar kaa nivesh - or iske saath jude shuruaati prachaar-prasar - or iske baad iskaa apekshaakrit twarit patan
 Until Itenium was released in June 2001, its performance was no better than competing RISC and CISC processors
 itanium ne x86 procesar ke aadhaar par sarvaron ke saath kam ant par pratispardhaa kii, or ibiem ke power architekchar or san microsystems ke espiearasi architekchar ke saath ucch ant main pratispardhaa kii
 Intel replicated Itineum to focus on high-end business and HPC computing, attempting to duplicate the successful "horizontal" market of x86
 is shuruaati procesar sanskaran kii safalataa echpi system main pie-aaraiessi, compake system main alpha or esajiai system main emypies ko badalane ke liye simit thi, haalanki ibiem ne is procesar ke aadhaar par ek superkamputer bhi diya tha
 Power and SPARC remained strong, while the 32-bit x86 architecture continued to grow in the enterprise space, capturing economies using its vast installed base as fuel
 apekshaakrit kharaab pradarshan, ucch laagat or simit software uplabdhta ke kaaran, mul marcid itanium procesar kaa upyog karke keval kuch hazaar system beche gaye the
 Recognizing that software shortages could be a serious problem for the future, Intel made thousands of early systems available to independent software vendors to encourage development
 echpi or intel ne ek saal baad bazaar ke liye agali peedi ke itanium 2 procesar laayaa
 The itechnium processor was released in 2002, and marketed for enterprise servers rather than the entire gamut of high-end computing
 pehla itanium 2, code namit mckinale, sanyukt rup se echpi or intel dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itineum processors, mostly due to an inefficient memory subsystem

 In 2003, AMD released the Opteron CPU, which implements its 64-bit architecture called AMD64
 opteran ne enterprize sarwar spes main teji se sweekruti praapt kii kyonki yah x86 se aasaan apgrade pradaan karata he
 In effect by Microsoft, Intel responded in 2004 by implementing amd's x86-64 instruction set architecture in its Xeon microprocessors instead of the IA-64, resulting in a new industry-wide de facto standard
 intel ne 2003 main medisson naamak ek nayaa itanium 2 paariwarik sadsy jari kiya
 Madison uses the 130 nm process and until the release of Montecito in June 2006 was the basis for all new itechnium processors
 march 2005 main, intel ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah 2007 main relies hone vaale kuta-namit tukvilla ke nae itanium procesar par kaam kar rahaa tha
 Tukwila will have four processor cores and will replace the Itineum bus with a new Common System Interface, using a new Xeon processor
 us varsh baad main, intel ne tukvilla kii delivery tithi sanshodhit kii- 2008 ke ant tak
 In November 2005, major Itineum server manufacturers joined Intel and several software vendors to form the Itineum Solutions Alliance to promote architecture and accelerate software porting
 gathbandhan ne ghoshnaa kii ki uske sadsy dashakon ke ant tak itanium samaadhaan main $ 10 billian kaa nivesh karenge
 In 2006, Intel distributed Montecito, a dual-core processor that nearly doubled performance and reduced energy consumption by nearly 20 percent
 intel ne november 2007 main itanium 2 9100 shrinkhalaa, kodenamed montwaale jari kii
 In May 2009, the Tukwila schedule, its follow-up schedule, was revised again, with plans to release oems for the first quarter of 2010
 itanium 9300 shrinkhalaa procesar, kodenamayukt tukvilla, 8 farvari, 2010 ko adhik pradarshan or smriti kshamta ke saath jari kiya gaya tha
 The device uses a 65 nm process, includes two to four cores, 24 MB on-die cache, hyper-threading technology and integrated memory controllers
 yah dabl-divaais data sudhaar lagu karata he, jo smriti trutiyon ko thik karne main madad karata he
 Tukwila also implements the Intel quickpath interconnect to replace the itenium bus-based architecture
 isamen 96 jibi / es kii chotii interprocesar bandwidth or 34 jibi / es kii ek sheersh memory bandwidth he
 With quickpath, the processor has integrated memory controllers to directly connect to other processors and i / o hubs using QPI interfaces and interfaces memory directly
 nehalem microarchitekchar kaa upyog karke intel procesar par quickpeth kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, jisase yah sambhav ho jaataa he ki tukvilla or nehalem ek hi chipset kaa upyog karne main sakasham honge
 Tukwila includes four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 dimms through a separate memory controller, similar to the Nehalem-based Xeon processor code-named Beckton
 itaniam 9500 series procesar, kodenamed polson, tukvilla ke follow-on procesar hai or 8 november, 2012 ko jari kiye gaye the
 According to Intel, it bypasses 45 nm process technology and uses 32 nm process technology

 The East India Company arrived in Uttarakhand in 1815
 isse pehle yahan nepali gorakhon kaa shashan tha
 It is also believed that the British attention came to this after seeing the atrocities committed by the Gorkha rulers on the people of this area
 haalaanki angrejon or nepali gurkhaon ke bich lade gayi gorkha yuddh ke anya kaaran bhi the
 After a treaty between Almora Gorkha Representative Bamshah and Lieutenant Colonel Gardner on 27 April 1815 in Almora, the Nepalese ruler accepted the withdrawal from the region and the East India Company took control of the region

 The British did not keep the whole area under their rule, in April 1815 itself, they took possession of the eastern part of Garhwal and the area of kumaon and handed over the western part to Sudarshan Shah, who was the king of Garhwal before the rule of the Gorkhas, who were Alaknanda and Mandakini
 Used to fall to the west of the rivers

 On the other hand, the old ruler of the Kumaon region, Chand Raja, did not get this right and it became part of British India and came to be governed under the British chief-commissionship with its capital at Nainital

 jo bhi prabhaav yahan bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram ke pade unhen kamishnar henry raimaje ne kathorta se samaapt kar diya
 During this time, there is evidence of secret organization and preparation of rebellion by Kalu Mehra in Kali area of kumaon and Kalu Mehra is considered as the first freedom fighter of Uttarakhand

 kumaun kamishnari ke maidani kshetra avashya is dauraan gadar se prabhavit rahe jo kamishnar raimaje ke liye chintaa kaa vishay bane
 Fearing a revolt in Rampur on the occasion of Bakrid in July 1857 and Nainital being affected by it, Ramje removed British women and children from Nainital to Almora, though the Nawabs of Rampur were allies of the British
 nainital par kabza karne kaa pratham prayaas sitambar 1857 main hua or 17 sitambar 1857 kii ek ghatana main maidani bhaag main sthit haldwani shahar par vidrohiyon ne kabza bhi kar liya tha jise baad main angrejon ne waapas hasil kar liya
 This attack was led by a rebel named Kala Khan

 sahasaa ek din raja viraat kaa saalaa kichak apni bahan sudeshna se bhent karne aayaa
 When his eyesight fell on Sairandhri, he became pain-stricken and looked forward to the opportunity to meet Syndri in solitude
 draupadi bhi uski kaamuk drushti ko bhaanp gai
 Draupadi also told Maharaja Virat and Maharani Sudeshna that Keechaka casts a grudge on me, i have five Gandharva husbands, one day they will kill Keechaka
 kintu un donon ne draupadi kii baat kii koi parvaah na kii
 Being helpless, one day Draupadi told Bhimsen about Kicchak's misfortune and misconception
 draupadi ke vachan sunakar bhimsen bole, “he draupadi! tum us dusht kichak ko ardhratri main nrityshala milane kaa sandesh de do
 i will go to your place in the dance hall and kill it
 ”sairandhri ne ballab kii yojana ke anusaar kichak ko raatri main nrityshala main milane kaa sanket de diya
 Pleased with this sign of Draupadi, when the night reached the dance hall, Bhimsen was lying there covering his body and mouth with a sari of Draupadi
 unhen sairandhri samajhakar kamottejit kichak bolaa, “he priytame! meraa sarvasv tum par nyochhavar he
 Now you get up and have fun with me
 ” kichak ke vachan sunate hi bhimsen uchhal kar uth khadey huye or bole, “re paapi! tu sairandhri nahin apni mrityu ke samaksh khadaa he
 But now tasted the fruit of putting a mistress on the lady
 ” itnaa kahkar bhimsen ne kichak ko laat or ghunson se maarna armbh kar diya
 Just as the fierce storm shook the trees, in the same way, Bhimsen started to beat Keechaka in the whole dance hall
 anek baar use ghuma-ghuma kar prithvi par patakane ke baad apni bhujaaon se uske gardan ko marodakar use pashu kii maut maar daalaa
 After killing this kind of chicken, Bhimsen twisted all his limbs and turned him into a chunk of meat and said to Draupadi, “panchali! Come and see what i have done to the worms of this work
 ” uski us durgati ko dekhakar draupadi ko atyant santosh praapt hua
 Then Ballabh and Sairandhri quietly went to their respective places and slept
 praatavkaal jab kichak ke vadh kaa samachar sabko mila to maharani sudeshna, raja viraat, kichak ke anya bhai aadi vilaap karne lage
 When the body of the Keechaka was taken to the funeral, Draupadi said to King Virat, "it has got the fruit of putting me on the evil side, surely my Gandharva husbands have taken this plight
 ” draupadi ke vachan sun kar kichak ke bhaaiyon ne krodhit hokar kaha, “hamaare atyant balavaan bhai kii mrityu isi sairandhri ke kaaran hui he atah ise bhi kichak kii chita ke saath jala dena chaiye
 "saying this, he forced Draupadi to force her to the crematorium and tie it with the Keechaka cone
 kank, ballab, vrihannalaa, tantipal tathaa granthik ke rup main vahaan upasthit pandavon se draupadi kii yah durdasha dekhi nahin ja rahi thi kintu agyatavaas ke kaaran ve swayan ko prakat bhi nahin kar sakate the
 That is why Bhimsen secretly leaped over to the crematorium and ran towards the crematorium and applied mud and mud to all the parts on the way
 phir ek vishaal vriksh ko ukhadkar kichak ke bhaaiyon par tut pade
 Some of them were killed by Bhimsen, the remaining who escaped after saving their lives
 iske baad bhimsen ne draupadi ko santvana dekar mahal main bhej diya or swayan naha-dhokar duusare raste se apane sthaan main laut aaye
 Seeing the killing of Keechak and his brothers, everyone including Maharaj Virat started to be afraid of Draupadi
 kichak ke vadh kii soochna aandhi kii tarah fail gai
 In fact, Keechak was very powerful and King Susarma of Trigarta and Kaurava of Hastinapur were afraid of him
 kichak kii mrityu ho jane par raja susharma or kauravagan viraat nagar par akraman karne ke uddeshy se ek vishaal sena gathit kar liya
 The Kauravas advised Susarma to climb first
 unki salaah ke anusaar susharma ne unki salaah maanakar viraat nagar par dhaava bolkar us rajya kii samast gauon ko hadap liya
 Due to this, all the Gwalas of the state went to the Raj Sabha and requested, “O Maharaj! King Susarma of Trigarta is snatching all cows from us and taking them into his kingdom
 aap hamaari sheeghra raksha karen
 At that time, Virat and Kank etc
 were all present in the meeting
 raja viraat ne nishchay kiya ki kank, ballab, tantipal, granthik tathaa unke swayan ke netritv main sena ko yuddh main utaara jaye
 According to his plan, everyone attacked and attacked King Susharma
 chhadmaveshdhari pandavon ke parakram ko dekhakar susharma ke sainik apane-apane praan lekar bhaagane lage
 Even after giving Susarma much encouragement, those soldiers were not ready to come back and fight
 apni sena ke pair ukhdate dekhakar raja susharma bhi bhaagane laga kintu pandavon ne use gher liya
 Ballabh broke his bone rib by hitting him with kick punches
 susharma kii khub marammat karne ke baad ballab ne use uthaakar prithvi par patake diya
 He shouted loudly after falling to the ground
 bhimsen ne uski ek na suni or use baandhakar yudhisthir ke samaksh prastut kar diya
 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira left him when Susarma accepted slavery
 idhar duusari ore se kauravon ne viraat nagar par hamalaa bol diya
 The praja came to the Raj Sabha and started pleading for protection, but at that time Maharaj had gone to war with the four Pandavas
 mahal main keval rajkumaar uttar hi the
 Seeing the people pleading for protection, he could not stay away from Sairandhri and he rebuked the prince for not going north to fight with the Kauravas
 sairandhri kii fatkaar sunakar rajkumaar uttar ne shekhi baghaarte huye kaha, “main yuddh main jaakar kauravon ko avashya haraa detaa kintu asamarth hoon, kyonki mere paas koi sarathi nahin he
 "hearing her, Sairandhri said," Prince! Vrihannala is a very accomplished charioteer and she has been the charioteer of Kuntiputra Arjuna
 tum use apana sarathi bana kar yuddh ke liye jaao
 Finally, the prince came out for the war by making Uttar Vrihanla a charioteer
 us din pandavon ke agyatavaas kaa samay samaapt ho chukaa tha tathaa unke prakat hone kaa samay aa chukaa tha
 Arjun's impotence found under Urvashi's curse was also over
 atah maarg main arjuna ne us shmashaan ke paas, jahaan pandavon ne apane astr-shastr chupaaye the, rath roka or chupake se apane hathiyaar le liye
 When his chariot reached the battlefield, seeing the mighty warriors of the huge Kaurava army and the mighty warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwatthama, Duryodhana, etc
, the prince was extremely nervous and said, "vrihanla! You take the chariot back
 main in yoddhaon se muqabla nahin kar saktaa
 Vrhannala said, "O prince! It is better for any Kshatriyaputra than to show his back in battle, that he can get heroism in war
 uthaao apane astr-shastr or karo yuddh
 "but the words of Vrihanla had no effect on the prince's answer and he jumped from the chariot and started running
 is par arjuna ne lapak kar use pakad liya or kaha, “rajkumaar! bhaybheet hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 No one can spoil you except me
 aaj main tumhaare samaksh swayan ko prakat kar rahaa hoon, main panduputr arjuna hoon or kank yudhisthir, ballab bhimsen, tantipal nakul tathaa granthik sahadev hai
 Now i will fight with them, now you take the reins of this chariot
 ” yah vachan sunakar rajkumaar uttar ne gadgad hokar arjuna ke pair pakad liya
 The sound of Devadatta's conch echoed in the battlefield
 us vishisht dhwani ko sunakar duryodhana bhishma se bolaa, “pitamah! yah to arjuna ke devdatt shankh kii dhwani he, abhi to pandavon kaa agyatavaas samaapt nahin hua he
 Arjuna revealed himself, so now the Pandavas will have to undergo twelve years of exile and one year of exile again
 ” duryodhana ke vachan sunakar bhishma pitamah ne kaha, “duryodhana! kadaachit tumhen gyaat nahin he ki pandav kaal kii gati jaanane vaale hai, bina avadhi puri kiye arjuna kabhi saamne nahin aa saktaa
 i have also calculated that the period of Pandavas' exile has been completed
 ”duryodhana ek deergh nirishwaas chhodte huye bolaa, “ab jab arjuna kaa aana nishchit ho chukaa he to pitamah! hamen sheeghra hi vyuh rachana kar lenaa chaiye
 On this Bhishma said, "watts! Take a third army and leave with the cows
 shesh sena ko saath lekar ham log yahan par arjuna se yuddh karenge
 According to Bhishma Pitamah's advice, Duryodhana, along with a third army of cows, went towards Hastinapur
 yah dekhakar ki duryodhana ranbhumi se lautakar ja rahaa he arjuna ne apana rath duryodhana ke peeche dauda diya or bhaagate huye duryodhana ko maarg main hi gherkar apane asankhya baanon se use vyakul kar diya
 Arjuna's arrows uprooted the legs of Duryodhana's soldiers and they ran back showing their backs
 sari gauen bhi rambhati huin viraat nagar kii or bhaag nikaleen
 Seeing Duryodhana surrounded by Arjuna's arrows, all the heroes like Karna, Drona, Bhishma etc
 ran to protect him
 karn ko saamne dekh kar arjuna ke krodh kaa parawar na rahaa
 He showered so much arrows at Karna that his chariots, horses, charioteers all got corrupted and Karna too left the field and ran away
 karn ke chale jane par bhishma or dron ek saath arjuna par baan chhodane lage kintu arjuna apane baanon se bich main hi unke baanon ke tukade-tukade kar dete the
 Finally, distraught with Arjuna's arrows, all the Kauravas left the ground and fled
 kauravon ke is prakaar bhaag jane par arjuna bhi vijayshankh bajaate huye viraat nagar laut aaye

 a Bill passed by both the Houses can become law only if the President gives his approval to it

 The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha
 ant: uske liye yah jaruri he ki lok sabha kaa vishwaas khote hi pad-tyaag kar den
 Parliamentary rule should mean rule by Parliament
 kintu sansad swayan shashan nahin karti or na hi kar sakati he
