 praaia: hinduon ke dharmik krityon ke armbh or ant main inkaa paath kiya jaataa he
 Shanti Mantras are found in Upanishads, where they are invoked in the beginning of some topics of Upanishads
 They are supposed to calm the mind of reciter and environment around him / her
 Reciting them is also believed to be removing any obstacles for the task being started
 Shanti Mantras always end with three utterances of word "shanti" which means "peace"
 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or physics, "divine" or adhidaivik and "internal" or spiritual According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming fromextra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
when Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 All the things that can be fed to cattle such as cow, bull, buffalo, goat, horse etc
 are called fodder or 'cattle feed' or 'animal feed'
 pashu ko 24 ghanton main khilaayaa jane vaala aahaar jisamen uski aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu bhojya tatv maujuud hon, pashu aahaar kehete hai
 a diet in which all the essential nutrients of the animal are available in the appropriate proportion and quantity is called a balanced diet
 vaigyanik drushti se dudharu pashuon ke sharir ke bhaar ke anusaar uski aavashyaktaaon jaise jivan nirvaah, vikaas, tathaa utpaadan aadi ke liye bhojan ke vibhinn tatv jaise protein, carbohayadret, vasa, khanij, vitamins tathaa pani kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The amount of food in animals depends on its productivity and state of reproduction
 pashu ko kul aahaar kaa 2 / 3 bhaag mote chaare se tathaa 1 / 3 bhaag dane ke mishran dwaara milanaa chahie
 a mixture of pulses and non-pulses fodder may be given in coarse fodder
 dalhani chaare kii maatra aahaar main badhaane se kaaphi had tak dane kii maatra ko kam kiya jaasakata he
 Although the amount of food of the animal is determined according to its body's requirement and function and based on the nutrients found in the available food items, but to save the cattle from the difficulty of the calculation work, the thumb rule Adoption is more convenient
 iske anusaar ham mote taur par vyask dudharu pashu ke aahaar ko teen virgon main baant sakate hai
 This is the amount of food that an animal is given to keep its body healthy
 ise pashu apane sharir ke taapmaana ko uchit seemaa main banaae rakhane, sharir kii aavashyak kriyaayen jaise pachan kriya, parivahan, shwasan, utsarjan, chayapachay aadi ke liye kaam main laata he
 Due to this, the weight of his body also remains constant in a range

 In this, the quantity of toddy or dried grass is 4 kg for indigenous cow and 4 to 6 kg for hybrid cow, pure breed indigenous cow or buffalo
 iske saath pashu ko dane kaa mishran bhi diya jaataa he jisaki maatra sthaneey desi gaay ke liye 1 se 1
25 kilo tathaa sankar gaay, shuddh nasl kii deshi gaay yaa bhens ke liye isaki maatra 2
0 kilo rakhi jaati he
 To feed the animal by this method, it is necessary to mix the grain in the right proportion by mixing the appropriate ingredients
 iske liye pashupaalak swayan nimnlikhit ghatakon ko die hue anupaat main milakar santoshajanak pashu dana bana sakate hai
 Production food is the amount of animal food that is given to the animal for its milk production in addition to the food that is given for sustenance
 isamen sthaneey gaay ke liye prati 2
5 kilo doodh ke utpaadan ke liye jivan nirvaah aahaar ke atiri 1 kilo dana dena chahie jabaki sankar / deshi dudharu gaayon / bhainson ke liye yah maatra prati 2 kilo doodh ke liye di jaati he
 If green fodder is available in sufficient quantity then every 10 kg of good quality green fodder can be reduced by 1 kg of grain
 isse pashu aahaar kii keemat kuch kam ho jaaegi or utpaadan bhi thik bana rahegaa
 The animal must be fed clean water at least thrice a day for milk production and sustenance
 pashu kii garbhavastha main use 5wein maheene se atiri aahaar diya jaataa he kyonki is avadhi ke baad garbh main pal rahe bachche kii vruddhi bahut teji ke saath hone lagati he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for proper growth and development of the unborn child in the womb and for the right milk production in the next point of cow / buffalo
 isamen sthaneey gaayon ke liye 1
25 kilo tathaa sankar nasl kii gaayon va bhainson ke liye 1
75 kilo atirikt dana diya janaa chahie
 More milking animals should increase the amount of grain they want from the 8th month of pregnancy or 6 weeks before calving for complete development of their milk glands
 is ke liye jebu nasl ke pashuon main 3 kilo tathaa sankar gaayon va bhainson main 4-5 kilo dane kii maatra pashu kii nirvaah aavashyaktaa ke atiri diya janaa chahie
 This allows the animal to produce maximum milk at the next point of its ability

 ek tanker ek jahaaj hota he jo vishaal maatra main taral padaarthon ke parivahan karne kii drushti se banya jaataa he
 The major types of tank ships include oil tankers, chemical tankers and liquefied natural gas conductors
 tanker apni kshamta ke aadhaar par kai sau tanon se lekar, jinamein chote bandargahon or tateey bastiyon ke liye aapurti karne vaale tanker shaamil hote hai, kai hazaar ton ke, jo adhik-duuri ke vahan shulk ke liye hote hai, ho sakate hai
 In addition to the ocean and sea tankers, there are also some special inland waterway tankers which carry out transport by rivers and canals with an average freight carrying capacity of a few thousand tons
 tankeron dwaara utpaadon kii vistrut shrankhla kaa parivahan hota he, jinamein nimna shaamil hai: Tankers are a relatively new concept that has existed since the late 19th century
 iske pehle, takneekee vikaas aisa nahin tha kii baari maatr main taral padaarthon kaa parivahan kiya ja sake
 us samay bazaar bhi baari maatr main maal ko bechney yaa uske parivahan kii or udyat nahin tha, isliye adhikansh jahaaj vibhinn dishaao main vibhinn utpaadon kii vistrut shrankhla kaa parivahan karte the or nishchit margon ke baahar bhi vyapaar karte the
 Liquids were usually filled in casks — hence the term "tonnage", which expresses the volume of a portable item in terms of the amount of wine in a ton unit
 yahaan tak ki pine kaa pani, joki chaalak dal ke astitv ke liye mahatvapurn tha vah bhi pipon main bhar kar rakhaa jaataa tha
 Earlier ships had to face many difficulties in carrying heavy quantities of liquids: ant main, tanker kii shuruyaat tel udyog main hui, kyonki tel companiyaan apane parishodhan sthal ke utpaada ko apane graahakon tak bhejne ke liye saste se sasta madhyam talash kar raheen thim
 Thus the oil tanker was born
 aajkal adhikansh taral padaarthon kaa adhik maatr main parivahan sasta he or prayek utpaada ke liye samarpit terminal uplabdh hai
 Tanks with large storage capacity on the coast are used for storage of the product until it can be divided into parts of low volume to reach small customers
 yahaan tak kii dublin sthit ginez bryaari company ke paas prasiddh stout ko britain main niryaat karne ke liye jahaazon kaa ek bedaa he
 Different products require different types of operation and transportation
 isliye vishesh prakaar ke tankeron kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, jaise "rasayan tanker" or "tel tanker"
 "alenji vaahak" ke naam se jane jane vaale tankeron kaa nirmaan dravit prakritik gas ke parivahan ke liye kiya gaya he
 In oil tankers, supertankers are designed to transport oil to the southern part of Africa and Middle Eastern countries
 super tanker siwaise jayant, jise 2010 main hataa diya gaya tha, vah 458 meter lanbaa or 69 meter chaudaa tha
 Supertankers are one of the mediums preferred for transporting large quantities of oil, the other two being pipeline transport and rail

 ise ek swatantra upkaran banane ke liye, shell ne landan tanker brokers panel se mashvira liya
 Previously, he assigned groups 25,000 tons of deadweight on a simple purpose basis; Medium range, for vessels ranging from 25, 000 to 45,000 DWT and large range, for ships larger than 45,000 DWT

 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes

 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke τεκτονικός se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue
 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate

 Going down, the molten material rises up as a magma plume and also produces volcanism
 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented

 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati

 The famous philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a professor at the University of Berlin for many years and he died in the same city
 uske likhe hue aath granth hai, jinamein prapanchashaastra, nyaay ke siddhant evam darshanik siddhanton k vishwakosh, ye teen granth visheshtya ullekhneey hai
 Hegel's philosophical views may be said to be particularly influenced by the ideas of philosophers of German-country, Korn, Fikte, and Schelling, although there are significant differences between Hegel's and his ideas
 hegel kaa darshan nirpeksh pratyaywad yaa chidwad athwa vastugat chaitanyavad kehalaata he; kyonki unke mat main aatma-anatma, drashtaa-drishy, evam prakruti-purush sabhi padaarth ek hi nirpeksh gyanaswaroop param tatv yaa sat kii vibhinn abhivyaktiyaan hai
 According to him, the world is neither the result of unconscious nature or the puddles, nor the game of mind of any individual
 jad-chetan-gun-dosha-may samast sansar main ek hi aseem, anadi evam anant chetan tatv, jise ham parabrahm kah sakate hai, otprot he
 There is no power of any substance other than that
 vah nirpeksh chid yaa parabrahm hi apane aapaki apni hi swaabhaavik kriya se vividh vastuon yaa naiysargik ghatnaon ke rup main satat prakat karata rahata he
 He does not need any other means or material separate from him
 hegel ke anusaar pudgalaatmak vishwa or hamaare tan, paraspar bhinn hone par bhi, ek hi nirpeksh sakriy parabrahm kii abhivyaktiyaan hone ke naate ek duusare se ghanishthatapurvak sambandhit evam aviyojya hai
 In Hegel's view, the whole developmental activity of the world is the activity of the active Brahman
 kya jad kya chetan, sabhi padaarth or praani usee ek nirpeksh vidrup sat ke simit yaa parichhinn vyakt rup hai
 In the form of herbal nature, animal flora, conscious animal and self-conscious humans, the same parabrahma expresses itself and in its still manifestations the supreme self-assured human being is the supreme expression, whose philosophical, religious and artistic succession is the creation of Brahman itself
 Personal purpose is served
 duusare shabdon main, brahm apane aapako vishwa ke vividh padaarthon ke rup main prakat karke hi apana vikaas karata he
 Thus, Hegel's Absolute Brahman is an active tangible universal or dynamic and concrete universal element, not an abstract universal
 vah shankaracharya ke brahm ke sadrush na to shant yaa kutasth he or na bhedashunya
 Hegel has sharply criticized all nonchalant Brahmists by referring to Shailing's inscrutable Brahman as a dark night in which all cows of diverse colors appear black
 shaling charaachartmak samast vishwa kii aavirbhuti brahm se sweekaar karte hue bhi use sab prakaar ke bhedon se rahit tathaa prapanch ke pare maane the
 But Hegel did not seem to be justified in accepting the rise or development of a non-discordant, elemental and distinct dynamic world
 unhone brahm ko vishwathit nahin mana
 Hegel's Brahmo resembles Sriramanujacharya's God to some extent
 ve, shriramanujacharya kii tarah, brahm ke sajaateey vijaateey bhed to nahin maanate, parantu usamen swagatbhed avashya sweekaar karte hai
 They have accepted it as a non-discriminatory impulse or plural unity, not as pure imperviousness or blank unity
 isi prakaar, shriramanujacharya kaa siddhant bhi vishishtadvait he, shuddhadvait yaa advait nahin
 The "sarva Khalvidam Brahman" of the Hegel Chandogyopanishad, the "purusha Avedam Sarvam" of the Rigveda and the "sarvatha Parinpavam" etc
 of the Srimadbhagavadgita can be called approvers
 parantu manducopanishad ke "amaatrashchaturtho%vyavhaarya: prapanchopashma


" siddhant ke maananevaale nahin
 Hegel considered Brahm's soul expression to occur in different forms of the functional and dynamic world according to a particular rational or intellectual law
 unka kahana tha ki satya yauktik he or yauktik satya he
 In other words, according to him the rule of intellectual thought and the rule of development of the world is the same and he has stated this rule as the law of opposition or opposition
 iske anusaar jadaatmak jagat evam vaiyaktik man donon hi ke rup main nirpeksh brahm ke vikaas kaa hetu us tatv kaa aantarik virodh yaa vyaghaat hi he
 According to Hegel, two opposing or mutually opposing thoughts or substances co-ordinate into a third thought or substance
 udaahranarth, hamaare man main sarvapratham "sat" kaa vichaar udai hota he, yaa yon kahie ki sansar ke samast padaarthon kii aadi avasthaa "sat" hi he
 But "only Sat" or "sanatr" is virtually identical
 at: sat ke antsthal main hi asat yaa abhaav sannihit he
 And this antipathy of Sat Assat becomes the root of future development of Sat
 chunki vipratipatti yaa virodh yauktik vichaar ko sahya nahin, at: yah swabhaav se hi uske niraakaran kii ore agrasar ho jaataa he tathaa sat or asat naamak virdohi pratyayon ke samanvay kaa nishpaadan "bhav" naamak pratyay main kar detaa he
 Hegel calls the initial suffix as paksha or nighan, his adversary suffix as the counterpart or counterpart and his matching suffix coordinate or redress, and his entire process oriented to this side is known as antagonism coordination justice or duality-coordination method or trikavav
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "sat" paksh, "asat" pratipaksh tathaa "bhav" samanvay he
 Thus, in Hegel's opposition-coordination-justice, favor, counterparty, and coordination are the sum of all three
 ise kuch or adhik spasht rup se samajhane ke liye ham apane bahya gyaan ko len or dekhen ki usamen yah niyam kis prakaar lagu hota he
 According to Hegel's statement, one has external knowledge only when the subject of the first known object is opposed by the subject or subject, and then the subject is distinguished from that subject and contains itself
 yahan "vishayi" paksh tathaa "vishay" pratipaksh he or unka samanvay vishayi dwaara praapt vishay sambandhi gyaan se hota he
 In fact, in Hegel's view, the progress of the idea and the development of the whole world is, essentially, in accordance with this opposition to coordinated justice
 unhone anubhav yaa sansar ke praaia: sabhi kshetron kii vyakhya main is nyaay kii prayuktata ko pradarshit karne kaa du:saadhy kintu prashansaneey praytn kiya he
 His statement is that everything that happens in the world is according to this rule and consequently new distinctions or substances continue to emerge
 koi bhi bhed kabhi bhi nirpeksh pratyay yaa parabrahm ke baahar nahin hota or na vah brahm hi kabhi praapanchik padaarthon se pruthak hota he parantu sansar main kabhi brahm kii sambhavyataaon kaa ant nahin hota or is drushti se ham use sansarathit bhi kah sakate hai
 Hegel has tried to coordinate all the past, present and future distinctions in this Brahman or absolute suffix
 "hegel kaa brahm vyakti he athwa nahin ?" yah prashn vivadagrast he
 Haldane etc

 In the opinion of scholars like mctaggart etc
, that person cannot be called

 According to him, the work also exists before its expression in its cause
 vastut: ve kaaran evam kaary tathaa guni or gun ko ek duusare se abhinn or anyonyashrith maanate the
 Just as a work cannot exist in the absence of reasons or a virtue cannot remain without virtue, similarly, in Hegel's opinion, no event or object can be called causal even in the absence of work, just as virtue cannot exist without virtue
 
 hegel kaa nirpeksh pratyay yaa brahm, jise ve kabhi kabhi ishwar bhi kehete hai, kaant kii "parmaarthik yaa apane aapmen kii vastuon" ke sadrush agyeya nahin
 He can become the subject of our thinking, because we and our contemplation, despite being intellectually inclined, correspond to the same
 duusare shabdon main chunki hamaare simit vichaar ke niyam vahi hai jo saarvbhaum ishwar yaa uske vichaarrup vishwa ke, at: vah hamen buddhi dwaara avgat ho saktaa he
 With this thoughtful attempt by Hegel, he undoubtedly did the insurmountable task of bridging the gap that Kant had dug between the material and practical things, describing them as unknowable and knowable respectively
 hegely darshan, ek atyant mahatvapurn, utkrisht evam utkar bauddhik prayaas hone par bhi, aapattiyon se mukt nahin

 Various Hindi names for bread are prevalent in different parts of India, the main ones being: - praatishakhya shabd kaa arth he : 'prati' arthath tattat 'shakha' se sambandh rakhanevaala shaastra athwa adhyayan
 Here 'shakha' means the branches of the Vedas
 vaidic shakhaon se sambhddha vishay anek ho sakate the
 For example, rituals, ethics, etc
 associated with each Vedic branch had its own tradition
 un sab vishyon se praatishakhyon kaa sambandh na hokar keval vaidic mantron ke shuddh uccharan, vaidic samhitaon or unke padpaathon aadi ke sadhiprayukt varnaparivartan athwa swarparivartan ke parsparik sambandh or kabhi kabhi chandovichaar jaise vishyon se tha
 Here it is necessary to briefly understand the beginning, form and trend of Vedic branches
 bhartiya vaidic samskruti ke itihaas main ek samay aisa aayaa jabaki arya jati ke manishiyon ne paramparaprapt vaidic mantron ko vaidic samhitaon ke rup main sangruhit kiya
 The basis of the study at that time was oral only
 guru shishy kii shravan parampara dwaara hi vaidic samhitaon kii raksha ho sakati thi
 The Vedic codes became different branches from Deshbhed and Kalbhed respectively
 vaidic mantron or unki samhitaon ko prarambh se hi arya jati kii pavithratam nidhi samajha jaataa rahaa he
 The Aryan mystics have always been paying attention to their safety and study

 Vedic scholars created the textual textual footsteps from the point of view of security and economics of Vedic codes

 Along with the development of the Vedic intrigues, each branch tried to protect the pure pronunciation of the Vedic codes in their own tradition and with the help of the text and as much as possible the form of each verse of the Veda and those terms in the Code Study the corrections and alterations of mulat: praatishakhyon kaa vishay yahi tha
 Sometimes, a scholastic study also came under the purview of Pratyakshaya

 It is said in Yaskacharya's Nirukta: arthath, padon ke aadhaar par samhita rahati he or sab shakhaon ke pratishaakhyon kii pravriti padon ko hi samhita kaa aadhaar maanakar hui he
 This makes a sound that in ancient times all the Vedic branches must have had their own idols

 The current available specific parameters are given below

 But the interpreters have divided the verses into pieces and interpreted them in the same form

 Instead of a hacker-cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat, gray hat, black hat, and script kiddie

 For visitor introduction to Wikipedia, see page about Wikipedia
 vikipedia ek muft, web aadhaarit or sahyogi bahubhashi vishwakosh he, jo gaiyr-laabh vickemedia foundation se sahyog praapt pariyojna main utpann hua
 Its name is a combination of the two words Wiki and Encyclopedia
 duniya bhar main swayamsevakon ke dwaara sahyog se vikipedia ke 13 million lekh likhe gaye hai or iske lagbhag sabhi lekhon ko vah koi bhi vyakti sampadit kar saktaa he, jo vikipedia websit kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 It was started in January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, currently the most popular reference work on the Internet
 vikipedia ke aalochak ise vyavasthit purvaagrah or asangatiyon ko doshi tehraate hai, or aarope lagate hai ki yah isaki sampadakeey prakriya main uplabdhiyon par sahmati kaa paksh leti he
 The reliability and accuracy of Wikipedia is also an issue

 Jonathan d of the New York Times, and Andrew Leah, in the fifth International Symposium on Online Journalism, described the importance of Wikipedia not only in the context of an encyclopedia but also as a frequently updated news source because it was recently Offers a very quick article about the events in jab time patrika ne you ko varsh 2006 ke liye person of da year kii manyata di or bataaya ki duniya bhar main kai million upyogkartaaon ke dwaara iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he or online sahyog main isaki badhati safalataa ko manyata di, isane web 2

 Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed as part of a formal process
 nupedia kii sthapana 9 march 2000 ko ek web portal company bomis, ink ke swaamitv ke tahat kii gayi
 Its main members were Jimmy Wales, Bomis CEO and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of Nupedia and later Wikipedia
 prarambh main nupedia ko iske apane nupedia open content license ke tahat license diya gaya or richard stallmen ke suzav par vikipedia kii sthapana se pehle ise GNU ke muft documentation license main badal diya gaya

 On 10 January 2001, Larry Sanger proposed the Nupedia mailing list to produce a wiki as a "feeder project" for Nupedia
 vikipedia ko aupchaarik rup se 15 janvari 2001 ko, www

 vikipedia kii "neutral point of vyuu" kii niti ko iske praarambhik maheenon main sanketabaddh kiya gaya, ore yah nupedia kii praarambhik "pakshpaatahin" niti ke samaan thi
 Otherwise, initially there were relatively few rules and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia
 vikipedia ne nupedia se praarambhik yogadanakarta praapt kiye, ye the sleshdot posting or search ingine indexing
 By the end of 2001, it had nearly 20,000 articles and 18 language editions
 2002 ke ant tak iske 26 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye, 2003 ke ant tak 46 or 2004 ke antim dinon tak 161 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye
 Nupedia and Wikipedia were present together until the former's server was permanently down in 2003 and its text was moved to Wikipedia

 Due to lack of control and perceived commercial advertising in an alleged English-focused Wikipedia, Spanish Wikipedia users split from Wikipedia in February 2002 to form Enciclopedia Libre
 baad main usee varsh, wales ne ghoshit kiya ki vikipedia vigyapanon kaa pradarshan nahin karegaa or isaki websit ko wikipedia

 It was applied to the Trademark Office and the US Patent to trademark Wikipedia on 17 September 2004

 Trademark protection was provided by Japan on 16 December 2004 and by the European Union on 20 January 2005

 As a general reference work, Wikipedia also contains some content that some, including Wikipedia editors, consider offensive, objectionable, and obscene

 Each entry in Wikipedia must be about a subject that relates to the encyclopedia and is eligible for inclusion as such

 Second, Wikipedia has to display only the knowledge that is already established and recognized

 a claim that can be challenged requires a reference to reliable sources

 Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia is generally reliable, but the reliability of any given article is not always clear

 Issues have also been raised regarding lack of accountability as a result of users' privacy, as well as artificial information entry, demolition and other similar problems

 Who wrote that? "" No, we don't know ", Jimmy said
 Some critics claim that Wikipedia's open structure makes it easy for Internet harassers, advertisers and people who want to attack

 nastredamas france ke ek 16veen sadi ke bhavishyavaktaa the
 Nostradamus was not only a prophet, but also a doctor and teacher
 ye plig jaisi bimariyon kaa ilaaj karte the
 In his poems, he had described the future events
 adhikansh shaikshanik or vaigyanik sutron kaa kahana he ki duniya kii ghatnaon or nastredamas ke shabdon ke bich dikhaae gaye sambandh kaaphi had tak galat vyakhyaaon yaa galat anuwaad kaa parinaam he yaa phir itane kamjor hai ki unhen vaastavik bhavishya bataane kii shakti ke sakshya ke rup main prastut karnaa bekaar he
 Some misinterpretations or incorrect translations have also been made intentionally
 is ke baavjood he bhi, beesvin shatabdi main nastredamas kii kathith bhavishyavaaniyan aam logon ke bich bahut lokapriy ho gayi or kai pramukh vishwa ghatnaon kii bhavishyavaanee kaa shrey unhen diya gaya
 Nostradamus, famous for announcing the future thousands of years ago, was born on 14 December 1503 in Saint Remy, a small village in France
 unka naam mishael di nastredamas tha bachapan se hi unki adhyayan main khaas dilchaspee rahi or unhonen latin, unani or hebru bhashaaon ke alaava ganit, sharir vigyaan evam jyotish shaastra jaise good vishyon par vishesh maharath hasil kar lee
 Nostradamus started making predictions from adolescence
 jyotish main unki babbti dilchaspee ne mata-pita ko chintaa main daal diya kyonki us samay kattarpanthi isai is vidya ko acchhee najar se nahin dekhte the
 To divert his attention from astrology, he was sent to Mont Pelier to study medical science, after which he completed three years of study and became a doctor of Nostradamus
 23 oktober 1529 ko unhone maant polier se hi doctoret kii oopaadhi lee or usee vishvavidhyalay main shikshak ban gaye
 After the death of his first wife, he went to Europe in 1547 and married Ann second
 is dauraan unhonen bhavishyavaktaa ke rup main khaas naam kamaaya
 According to a legend, once Nostredamus was walking on the streets of Italy with his friend, he saw a young man in the crowd and when he came near the youth greeted him with respect
 mitra ne aashcharyachakit hote hue iskaa kaaran puchha to unhone kaha ki yah vyakti aage jaakar pope kaa asana grahan karegaa
 According to legend, the person was actually Felis Peretti who was elected Pope in 1585
 nastredamas ke bare main aisi kai kahaniyaan hai, lekin inamen se kisi ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 Hearing the fame of the prophecies of Nostradamus, Queen Catherine of France expressed her desire to know the future of her children
 nastredamas apni ichha se yah jaan chuke the ki maharani ke dono bachche alpaayu main hi puure ho jaaenge, lekin sach kehane kii himmat nahin ho paayi or unhone apni baat ko pratikatmak chhandon main pesh kiya
 In this way, he also said his words and there was no injury to the Queen's mind
 tabhi se nastredamas ne yah tay kar liya ki ve apni bhavishyavaaneeyan ko isi tarah chando main hi vyakt karengen
 After 1550, Nostredamus left the profession of doctor and concentrated his attention on the practice of astrology
 usee saal se anhone apana vaarshik panchag bhi nikaalnaa shuru kar diya
 There were forecasts about planetary positions, weather and crops etc
 kaha jaataa he ki unamem se zyaadaatar satya sabit hui
 Along with astrology, Nostradamus spent hours immersed in books related to magic
 nastredamas ne 1555 main bhavishyavaaniyon se sambandhit apane pehle granth centuri ke pratham bhaag kaa lekhan puraa kiya, jo sabase pehle french or baad main angreji, german, italvi, roman, greek bhashaaon main prakashit hua
 This book created such a panic in France that it sold hands and hands despite being expensive at that time
 unke kuch vyakhyakaaron k maananaa he ki is kitaab ke kai chando main pratham vishwa yuddh, nepolian, hitler or kennedy aadi se sambanddh ghatnaayen spasht rup se dekhi ja sakati hai
 Interpreters claim to have succeeded in understanding the prognosis of the Third World War and the signs of the destruction of the world in several verses of Nostradamus
 adhikansh shaikshanik or vaigyanik sutron kaa kahana he ki ye vyakhyaayein galat anuwaad yaa galatarahami kaa parinaam hai or kuch galtiyaan to jaanboojhkar bhi kii gayi hai
 The last years of Nostradamus's life went through a lot of suffering
 france kaa nyaay vibhaag unke viruddh yah jaanch kar rahaa tha ki kya vah vaastaav main jaadu-tone kaa sahaara lete the
 Had this charge been proved, they would have been entitled to punishment
 lekin jaanch kaa nishkarsh yah niklaa ki ve koi jaadugar nahin balki jyotish vidya main paarangat he
 In those days, i was suffering from ascites
 sharir main ek phoda ho gaya jo lakh upachar ke baad bhi thik nahin ho paaya
 He had foreseen his death, so he got his will ready on 17 June 1566
 ek july ko padri ko bulaakar apane antim sanskaar ke nirdesh die
 On 2 July 1566 this famous prophet died
 kaha jaataa he ki apni mrityu kii tithi or samay kii bhavishyavaanee ve pehle hi kar chuke the
 According to one interpretation "one of the few predictions made by Nostradamus in his relation was that 225 years after his death, some anti-social elements would dig his grave and try to remove his remains but immediately his Will die vastav me aisi hi hua
 After the French Revolution, in 1791, three people dug the tomb of Nostredamus, who died instantly
