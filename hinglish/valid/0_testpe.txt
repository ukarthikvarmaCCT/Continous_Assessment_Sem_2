 One of them was named Shrimurti
 unke do bete the, nar or narayan
 Both were very good, never separated from each other
 nar chote the
 They wanted each other very much
 apni maa ko bhi bahut pyaar karte the
 Once both of them served their mother big
 maan khushi se phool uthi
 He said, "my dear son, i am very happy with you
 bolo, kya chaahate ho ? jo maangoge vahi duungi
 '' donon ne kaha, ‘‘maan, ham van main jaakar tap karnaa chaahaten he
 If you really want to give something, then give this blessing that we are always meditating
 ’’ The mother felt very sad to hear the sons
 ab uske bete usase bichhud jaayangen
 But she had given her promise
 unako roak nahin sakati thim
 Therefore had to give bridesmaid
 var paakar donon bhai tap karne chale gayi
 They started roaming in the forests of the whole country

 In this forest there are two mountains on both sides of Alaknanda

 While sitting here, both of them meditated heavily, so much that the king of Devaloka was afraid
 usne unke tap ko bhang karne kii badi koshish kii, lekin use safalataa nahin mili
 Then he remembered that nara-narayana is not an ordinary monk, an incarnation of God
 kehete he, kaliyug ke aane tak ve vahiin tap karte rahen
 At last, the kaliyuga era approached near
 tab ve arjuna or krishna kaa avatar lene ke liye badari-van se chale
 At that time, God told the other sages, "I will no longer be here in this form
 naarad shila ke neeche meri ek murti he, use nikaal lo or yahaan ek mandir banaaon aaj se usee kii puja karnaa
 This temple is very old

 pozolana yaa pozolana kii raakh, ek maheen, retili jwalamukheey raakh he
 Pozzolana was first discovered and dug in the vicinity of the Vesuvius volcano in Pozzuoli, Italy
 iske baad ise anya kai sthanon par bhi paaya gaya
 According to Vitruvius, four types of Pozzolana are found in black, white, gray and red, respectively, in volcanic regions of Italy such as Naples
 pozolana ek silisius or aluminas padaarth he jo jal kii upasthiti main calcium hydroxide ke saath pratikriya karata he
 Compounds thus formed exhibit cementative properties at normal temperatures and also have the ability to freeze under water
 aamtaur par iskaa gaara banane ke liye ise chooney main do main ek ke anupaat main pani milaane se pehle milaayaa jaataa he
 The Roman port at Cosa is made up of Pozolana, which was carefully poured into the water through a long canal so that the salty water of the sea could not come into contact with it
 is bandargah ke teen bangsar aaj bhi dikhaai dete hai, jinka pani ke andar kaa bhaag aaj 2100 se adhik varshon ke baad bhi acchhee haalat main he
 Modern pozzolana cements are a mixture of natural or industrial pozzolans and portland cement

 According to a 1968 US patent, its formulas contained a transparent, translucent or opaque mixture of water and mineral oil, paraffin wax and carbon tetrachloride
 pani or / yaa khanij tel ko svaichhik paardarshee rangon se ranga ja saktaa he
 The density of ordinary wax is much lower than that of water and it floats above the water at any temperature
 par jab mom main pani se baari carbon tetracloride milaayaa jaataa he, tab kaksh taapmaana par mom kaa ghanatv pani se thodaa adhik ho jaataa he
 Wax spreads more than water when heated, so this mixture of wax becomes lighter than water
 mom kii boonden deep kii upari ore chadhati hai, jahaan pahunchakar vah thandi hokar waapas neeche girane lagati hai
 a wire located on the bottom surface of the bottle breaks the surface tension and recombines the dropped droplets
 deep kaa balb saamanytah 25 se 40 wat kaa hota he
 Generally it takes 45–60 minutes for the wax to reach sufficient temperature
 kamare kaa taapmaana maanak kaksh taapmaana se kam hone kii sthiti main, 2 se 3 ghante bhi lag sakate hai
 After the wax melts, the lamp should not be shaken or inverted, as doing so may emulsion both fluids and result in the staining of the wax surrounding the droplets
 british accountint edward creven-vaakar ne is deep kaa avishkaar ek sharaabkhane main chuulhe par budbudate taral padaarthon se bhare ek cocktail hallitr se bane egg timer ko dekhne ke pashchaat kiya

 isamen parampadprapt 73 vidwaan bhikshuniyon ke udaan arthath udgaar 522 gaathaon main sangruhit hai
 The book is divided into 16 'nipatas', which are ranked according to the number of gathas

 The mention of the grand city Pataliputra is mentioned in the Udan of an Isidani
 sambhavat: vah samraat ashok kii rajdhani he
 Therefore, the composition of the text can be considered from the first musical to the third musical
 therigatha kii vishaywastu thergatha ke samaan hi he
 Yes, biographies are less mentioned in the themes of the Thera
 unamem vishyon kii gambhirtha or prakrutichitran adhik he
 On the contrary, most of the Therians have memoirs of their former lives filled with pleasantries
 is prakaar unke aadhyatmik jivan ke atirikt paariwarik or saamaajik jivan kii bhi jhalak milti he
 The description of nature is found only in the Udan of a few therias like Shubha
 anbpali jaisi theriyon ke udaan, jinamein sansaarik vaibhav kaa ullekh miltaa he, kavyashastra ke anupam udhaaharan hai
 The composition of the Bhiksun Sangh was also done on the basis of the monk

 From the women of the royal families to the women of the families of the oppressed were involved in the Sangh
 ve sabhi saamaajik vishmataaon ko tyagkar ek hi pavitra uddeshy se prerit ho kar sangh kii sadsyaayein ban gai thim
 There were many reasons behind the disinterest of those seekers
 adhiktar sadhikaaon ne priy janon ke viyog se or sansaarik jivan se ub kar sangh main pravesh kiya tha
 Everyone's aim was the attainment of ultimate peace
 arhatv kii prapti ke baad nirvana kii param shanti kii anubhuti main un sabhi ko ek hi swar main gaate sunate hai-- sitibhutamhi nibbutaa arthan shitibhoot ho gai hoon, upashant ho gai hoon
 The themes of the Theri also throw light on the social status of women of that time
 isidasi kii jeevani se maaloom hota he ki us samay kuch logon main talaak kii pratha prachlit thi
 Isidasi was married thrice
 us samant yug main bahupatni pratha prachlit thi
 Many themes mention this in their Udan
 us samay nagarshobhiniyon kii pratha bhi prachlit thi
 Lord Buddha had raised his voice against her
 unki shikshaaon se prabhavit hokar us vritti ko chhodkar kitni mahilaayein pavitra jivan vyateet karne lageen

 The nuns also had to be careful with them

 Keeping in mind that situation, many rules had to be made later regarding the detention of nuns
 is prakaar theriyon ke udaanon main us samay kii mahilaon kii saamaajik avasthaa kaa bhi ek chitra miltaa he
 Now we give some examples of examples of three themes as examples
 soma, rajgrih ke raaj purohit kii kanya thi
 One day after attaining Vimuktisukh, she became a nun, she sat in Andhavan for meditation
 maar ne use sadhana ke path se vichlit karne ke vichaar se kaha -- jo sthaan rishiyon dwaara bhi praapt karnaa kathin he, uski prapti alp buddhi vaali striyon dwaara sambhav nahin
 Responding to Maar, Soma said - Whose mind is in a trance, in which there is wisdom and in the path of the one who has been interviewed by religion, femininity does not become an obstacle

 bhagavan buddha kii mausi mahaprajapati gautami ne, jo ki bhikshuni sangh kii agrani thi, apane nirvana ke pehle bhagwaan ke paas jaakar unase antim vidaa lete hue kritagyata ke ye shabd prakat kiye - Vimala, like many other women, became enamored with the teachings of Lord Buddha and started living a holy life
 parampad kii prapti ke baad vah gaati he -- "paramatthadipani" is the story of Therigatha
 yah paanchavin shatabdi kii kriti he or acharya dharmpal kii he
 It contains biographies of the Therians and interpretations of their teachings
 isliye therigatha ke samajhane ke liye yah atyant upyogi he
 Purana Quila is the inner fort of the ancient dina-panah city situated on the banks of Yamuna river in New Delhi
 is kile kaa nirmaan sher shah suri ne apane shashan kaal main 1538 se 1545 ke bich karavaaya tha
 The fort has three large gates and has massive walls
 iske andar ek masjid he jisamen do taleey ashtabhuji stambh he
 According to Hindu literature, this fort is at the site of Indraprastha which used to be the huge capital of the Pandavas
 jabaki iskaa nirmaan afgaani shaasha sher shah suri ne 1538 se 1545 ke bich karaayaa gaya, jisane mughal badshaah humayun se dilli kaa singhaasana chin liya tha
 It is said that Mughal emperor Humayun died accidentally due to the fall of this fort from below
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli ko sarvapratham pandavon ne apni rajdhani indraprastha ke rup main basaaya tha vah bhi isapurv se 1400 varsh pehle, parantu iskaa koi pakkaa pramaan nahin hai
 In the south-eastern part of the old fort seen today, some trenches were dug for testing in 1955 and the pieces of pottery etc
 found were found to match the antiquities found from other sites related to the legend of Mahabharata, so that this old The recognition of the fort land being Indraprastha has gained some strength
 bhale hi mahabharat ko ek dharmagranth ke rup main dekhte hai lekin buddha sahitya “angutar nikaay” main varnit mahajanapadon yatha kaashi, koshal ang, magadh, asmak, avanti, gandhar, chedi aadi main se bahuton kaa ullekh mahabharat main bhi miltaa he jo is baat kaa sanket he ki yah granth maatr puranic hi nahin tathaapi kuch aitihaasikta ko bhi sanjoye hue hai
 Re-excavation near the eastern wall of the old fort was also done between 1969 and 1973
 vahaan se mahabharat kaaleen maanav basasat ke koi pramaan to nahin mili lekin maury kaal se lekar praarambhik mogul kaal tak anwarat vah bhubhag maanav basaahat se paripurna rahaa
 Such evidences have been found in which period-specific coins, bead, clay utensils, small statues of burnt clay, Yakshi Yakshi, scripted postures etc
 are prominent which are displayed in the museum of the fort
 kehete hai ki mogul samraat humayun ne yamuna nadi ke kinare usee tile par jiske neeche indraprastha dabi padi he, apane swayan kii nagari “dinpanaah” sthapit kii thi
 After that when Sher Shah Sur conquered Humayun, he destroyed all the buildings and started the construction of present day Delhi, Sher Shahi or "shergarh"
 is bich humayun ne punah sanghatit hokar akraman kiya or apni khoi hui sultanate waapas paa lee
 It is believed that Humayun completed the construction of the fort in 1545
 purana kila multah yamuna nadi ke tat par hi bana tha parantu uttar or pashchim dishaao ke dhalaan se prathit hota he ki nadi ko jodatii hui ek khai suraksha ke drushti se bani thi
 The fort wall of this fort is about 2
4 km long and its three main gates are in the north, west and south
 iname se pashchimi darvaaze kaa prayog aajkal kile main pravesh ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The north facing gate is called the "talaki Darwaja"
 yah spasht nahin he ki kab or kyon is darvaaze ke upyog ko pratibandhit kiya gaya
 This fort is considered to be a beautiful specimen of the coordination of Mughal, Hindu and Afghani architecture
 shershah dwaara banwaaya gaya sher mandal jo ashtakoneey do manjila bhawan he
 Humayun's library used to be in this building
 yaheen par ek baar pustakon ke boj ko uthaaye hue jab humayun sidhiyon se utar rahaa tha, tabhi ajaan kii pukaar sunai padati he, namaaz kaa samay ho chalaa tha
 Humayun used to practice that he would bow down whenever he heard the call of namaz
 jhukate samay uske pair lambey choge main kahin fas gayi or vah santulan kho kar gir padaa
 He died in the first half of 1556 only from the physical damage caused by this accident
 mahabharat main ullekith pandavon kii rajdhani indraprastha sambhavtah isi sthaan par thi
 These sentences are written on the inscriptions at various places in the old fort
 pandavon kii rajdhani indraprastha kahaan thi? is baat ko lekar logon main bahes hoti rahi he
 But based on the remains found in the excavations, a large section of archaeologists believe that the capital of the Pandavas must have been at this site
 yadhyapi puratatvavidon ke paas is baat ke pukhta pramaan nahin hai, lekin khudaai ke dauraan yahaan mili bartanon ke avasheshon se kile ke aasapaas pandavon kii rajdhani hone kii baat ko bal miltaa he
 The remains of such utensils have been found in excavations here, which have also been found at other places associated with Mahabharata
 iske alaava mahabharat se jude prasang or pracheen paramparaayen bhi is ore sanket karti hai, ki yahaan pandavon kii rajdhani rahi hogi
 There are very few cities in India that are as old as Delhi
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar purv aitihaasik kaal main jis sthal par indraprastha basaa hua tha, uske oonche tile par 16 veen shatabdi main purana kila banaaya gaya
 The Archaeological Survey of India has excavated this fort at several levels
 khudaai main pracheen bhure rang se chitrit mitti ke vishisht bartanon ke avshesh mili hai, jo mahabharat kaal ke hai
 Similar utensils have also been found at other Mahabharata sites
 is bare main ek tathy yah bhi he ki indraprastha ke apbhransh indraparat ke naam kaa ek gaanv vartmaan shatabdi ke prarambh tak purana kila main sthit tha
 While constructing the capital New Delhi, along with other villages, it was also removed
 dilli main sthit saraval gaanv se 1328 isvi kaa sanskrit kaa ek abhilekh praapt hua he
 This inscription is present in the museum of Red Fort
 is abhilekh main is gaanv ke indraprastha jile main sthit hone kaa ullekh he
 According to the Mahabharata, the capital of the Kuru country was located in Hastinapur on the banks of the Ganges
 jab pandavon or unke chachere bhai kauravon ke bich sambandh bighad gaye to kauravon ke pita dhritarashtra ne pandavon ko yamuna ke kinare khandavaprastha kaa kshetra de diya
 There he built a city surrounded by sea-like pits and built its defensive ramparts
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki purana kila kii ruparekha bhi isi prakaar kii thi
 It is also clear that Indraprastha was the name of a town, which was located in place of Purana Qila and the area in which it was located was named Khandavaprastha
 kaha jaataa he ki kauravon par apni vijay ke baad pandavon ne rajdhani indraprastha ko bhagwaan krishna se sambandhit kisi yadav vanshaj ko saunp diya
 There is another incident, according to which the Pandavas demanded five villages from the Kauravas
 ye ve gaanv the jinke naamon ke ant main pat aata he
 Which is the Hindi equivalent of Sanskrit
 ye pat vaale gaanv hai inderpat, bagpat, tilapat, sonipat or panipat hai
 This tradition is based on the Mahabharata
 jin sthanon ke naam die gaye hai
 Tilpat village is located on the eastern bank of Okhla Canal, about 22 kilometers south of Delhi
 in sabhi sthalon se mahabharat kaaleen bhure rang ke bartan mili hai

 unhone raagon ke aadhaar par granth sahib main sankalit vaaniyon kaa jo vargeekaran kiya he, uski misaal madhyakaalin dharmik granthon main durlabh he
 It is a proof of his understanding that the writings of 36 great orators were compiled without any discrimination in the Granth Sahib
 arjuna dev ji guru ram das ke suputr the

 Guru ji made great efforts to take Sikh culture to every door
 guru darbar kii sahi nirmaan vyavastha main unka mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 1590 AD In Tarn Taranke's lake system, it was also due to his efforts
 granth sahib ke sampadan ko lekar kuch asaamaajik tatwon ne akbar badshaah ke paas yah shikaayat kii ki granth main islam ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he, lekin baad main jab akbar ko vaani kii mahanata kaa pataa chalaa, to unhone bhai gurdas evam baba budhdhaake madhyam se 51moharen bhent kar khed gyaapit kiya

 He did lifelong auspicious work for human welfare
 akbar ke dehanth ke baad jahangir dilli kaa shaasha bana
 He was a fanatic
 apane dharm ke alaava, use or koi dharm pasand nahin tha
 Even religious and social work of Guru Ji did not find him pleasant
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa yah bhi mat he ki shahjada khusroko sharan dene ke kaaran jahangir guru ji se naaraaz tha
 May 15, 1606 AD On the emperor issued the order to hold Guru ji with the family
 tujke-jahangiri ke anusaar unka parivaar murtajakhan ke hawaale kar gharbaar lut liya gaya
 After this Guruji attained martyrdom

 guru arjuna dev ji kii vaani kii mul- samvednaa premabhaktise judy he
 The role of Guru ji in the propagation of Gurmati-ideology cannot be forgotten
 guru ji ne punjabi bhashaa sahitya evam samskruti ko jo anupam dein di, uskaa shabdon main varnan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The first evidence of this contribution is the editing of the Granth Sahib
 is tarah jahaan ek ore lagbhag 600varsho kii saanskrithik garima ko pun:srujit kiya gaya, vahiin duusari ore naveen jivan-mulyon kii jo sthapana hui, usee ke kaaran punjab main naveen-yug kaa sutarapaat bhi hua
 To remember him on the martyrdom festival of Guru ji means to recognize the secular ideology that Guru ji supported by surrendering

 It was at this time that a separate series of eminent writers founded by Chakradhar began

 Ancient Marathi literature being predominantly padyam, it is natural for the prose to be very small in it
 isamen bakhar sahitya aitihaasik drushti se purnataya saadhaar na hone par bhi upekshniya nahin
 Bhau Saheb's Bakhar written by Krishnaji Shamrao, Bakhar of Shiv Chhatrapati written by Krishnaji Anant Sashad, Bakhar of Peshwas written by Sowni, etc
 are excellent specimens of ancient Marathi prose

 The word 'chhattisgarhi' is used in two meanings
 1
 chhattisgadhi bhashaa, vah bhashaa jo bharat ke chhattisgarh praant or uske aasapaas boli jaati he
 2
 Chhattisgarhi people, people who live in Chhattisgarh province of India or who are born in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgadhi bharat main chhattisgarh praant main boli jane vaali ek atyant hi madhur va saras bhashaa he
 It is very close to Hindi and its script is Devanagari
 iskaa apana samrudh sahitya va vyakaran he
 Chhattisgarh is the mother tongue of 2 crore people
 yah purvi hindi kii pramukh boli he or chhattisgarh rajya kii pramukh bhashaa he
 82
56 percent of the state's population lives in rural areas and only 17 percent in urban areas
 yah nirvivaad satya he ki chhattisgarh kaa adhiktar jivan chhattisgadhi ke sahare gatiman he
 It is a different matter that the business-language of a few cities is in the national language Hindi and Urdu, Punjabi, Oriya, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Telugu, Sindhi etc
 and in tribal areas like Halbi, Bhatri, Muria, Madiya, Pahari Korwa, Uraon Contact is made only with the help of initial bids
 is sabake baavjood chhattisgadhi hi aisi bhashaa he jo samooche rajya main boli, va samajhi jaati he
 This Chhattisgarhi, which touches each other's heart, is a kind of contact language of Chhattisgarh state
 vastutah chhattisgarh rajya ke namakaran ke peeche uski bhashik visheshta bhi he
 In 875 AD, Ratanpur in Bilaspur district was ruled by the Chedolite king Kallol
 tatpashchaat ek sahastra varsh tak yahan haihyavanshi nareshon kaa rajkaaj aarambh hua
 According to Cunningham, the "south Kosala" at that time was the "mahakosal" and it was the "great Chhattisgarh" in which some districts of Orissa, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, namely, Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Balangir, Boudhulavani, Kalahandi, Koraput, Bhandara, Chandrapur , Shahdol, Mandla, Balaghat included
 uttar main sthit ayodhya rajya kaushal rajya kahalaaya jahaan kii boli avadhi he
 In South Kaushal, Awadhi was called Sahodhara Chhattisgarhi
 haihyavanshiyon ne is anchal main iskaa prachaar kaary prarambh kiya jo yahan par rajkeey prabhutv vaali siddh hui
 Due to this, they scattered bids and remained confined in the hills and forestlands and in these areas the ancient form of Chhattisgarhi started to stabilize
 chhattisgadhi ke praanrabhik likhit rup ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah 1703 isvi ke dantewada ke danteshwari mandir ke maithil pandit bhagwaan mishra dwaara shilaalekh main he
 Mr
 Pyarelal Gupta writes very interestingly in his book "ancient Chhattisgarh" - "chhattisgarhi language is the duhita of Ardha Bhagadhi and the brother of Awadhi"
 " chhattisgadhi or avadhi donon kaa janm ardhamagadhi ke garbh se aaj se lagbhag 1080 varsh purv naveen-dasvin shatabdi main hua tha
 " dow bholanath tibaari, apni pustak " hindi bhashaa" main likhte he - " chhattisgadhi bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya avadhi kii apeksha kahin adhik he or is dru se yah boli ke str ke upar uthakar bhashaa kaa swarup praapt karti he
 " bhashaa sahitya par or sahitya bhashaa par avlambit hote he
 That is why language and literature flourish simultaneously
 parantu ham dekhte he ki chhattisgadhi likhit sahitya ke vikaas ateet main spasht rup main nahin hui he
 Many writers believe that the reason is that in the past, the writers here made Sanskrit the medium of writing and remained a bit indifferent to Chhattisgarhi
 isiilie chhattisgadhi bhashaa main jo sahitya rachaa gaya, vah kareeb ek hazaar saal se hua he
 Many writers have divided this one thousand years in this way: ye vibhaajan saahitiyik pravritiyon ke anusaar kiya gaya he yadhyapi pyarelal gupt ji kaa kahana thik he ki - " sahitya kaa pravaah akhandit or avyahat hota he
 "mr
 Pyarelal Gupta ji goes ahead with a very beautiful estimate -" However, the trends of specific era leave their footprints on the chest of literature: Looking at the nomenclature of trend, one should not think that literature with any specific trends in an era Was composed only
 tathaa anya prakaar kii rachanaaon kii us yug main ekaant abhaav tha
 " yah vibhaajan kisi pravriti kii saapekshik adhikta ko dekhakar kiya gaya he
 Another noteworthy fact is that in other Aryan languages, even in Chhattisgarhi, only the poetic works have been done till the medieval period

 sarwar shabd kaa prayog khaas taur par information technology ke kshetra main kiya jaataa he
 Today's markets are dominated by Apple and Microsoft, despite the availability of products with countless server brands
 sarwar aplication ke aadhaar par, sarvaron ke liye aavashyak hardware bhinn-bhinn hote hai
 Absolute CPU speed is generally not as important for a server as it is for a desktop machine
 ek hi network main anginat upyogkartaaon ko seva pradaan karnaa sarwar kaa kaam hota he jisase tej network conection or ucch i / o thruput jaisi vibhinn aavashyaktaaen saamne aatin hai
 Since servers are generally accessed on the same network, they can remain in headless mode without a monitor or input device
 un prakriyaaon kaa prayog nahin hota he jo sarwar kii kriyasheeltaa ke liye jaruri nahin hote hai
 Many servers do not have a graphical user interface because it is redundant and also causes a loss of resources that are allocated somewhere
 isi tarah, audio or USB interfes bhi anupasthit rah sakate hai
 The server is often running for some time without interruptions and availability but must be of a high quality that can make the dependability and stability of the hardware extremely important
 Although servers can be made up of useful parts of the computer, but mission- Critical servers use specific hardware with a very low failure rate to increase uptime
 udhaahranswaroop, tivratar va ucchtam kshamta vaale harddrivon, garmi ko kam karne vaale bade-bade computer ke pankhons yaa pani kii madad se thanda karne vaale upkarnon or bijli kii baadhit hone kii sthiti main sarwar kii kriyasheeltaa ko jari rakhane ke liye abaadhit bijli kii aapurtiyon kii madad se sarvaron kaa gathan ho saktaa he
 These components provide high performance and dependence on higher value accordingly
 vyapak rup se hardware atiriktata kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jisamen ek se adhik hardware ko sthapit kiya jaataa he, jaise bijli kii aapurti or hard discs
 inhen is prakaar vyavasthit kiya jaataa he ki yadi ek vifal hua to doosraa apane-aap uplabdh ho jaay
 isamen trutiyon kaa pataa lagane va unhen thik karne vaale ECC memory divison kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; lekin bina ECC memory vaale divaais data main gadabadi paidaa kar sakate hai
 Servers are often rack-mounted and are kept in server rooms to keep them out of physical reach for convenience and safety
 kai sarvaron main hardware ko shuru karne tathaa oparating system ko lod karne main bahut samay lagata he
 Servers often perform extensive pre-boot memory testing and verification and then launch remote management services
 tab hard drive controlrs sabhi drivon ko ek saath shuru na karke ek-ek karke shuru karte hai taaki isse bijli kii aapurti par koi overlod na pade or tab jaakar ye RAID pranali ke purv-jaanch kaa kaary shuru karte hai jisase atiriktata kaa sahi sanchaalan ho sake
 yah koi khaas baat nahin he ki ek mashin ko shuru hone main kai minute lagate hai, lekin ise maheenon yaa saalon tak phir se shuru karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he
 Almost the entire structure of the Internet is based on a client-server model

 There are millions of servers connected to the Internet which are running continuously all over the world

 Other services do not use related servers; For example, peer-to-peer file sharing, some implementations of Teli, the supply of television programs to different users
 koi bhi computer yaa divaais jo anuprayog yaa seva pradaan karte hai, unhen sarwar kaha ja saktaa he
 Identifying network servers in an enterprise or office environment is easy
 ek DSL / cabel modem router ek sarwar ke samaan hota he kyonki yah ek aisa computer pradaan karata he jisamen anuprayog sevaayen hoti he, jaise IP adress asinament, NAT or fyrwal jo computer ko bahari khataron se raksha karne main madad karata he

 prasiddh chini yatri hnen-sang ne bharat ke un sabhi vishvavidhyalayon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he jinamein vah gaye athwa jahaan rah kar inhone adhyayan kiya
 For example, two of these universities can be specifically mentioned - Nalanda in the east and Vallabhi in the west
 ganga ke purvi tat par ek anya vishvavidhyalay tha -vikramshila
 The Tibetan scholar Taranath has described it in detail
 yahaan ke shikshak or vidwaan tibet main itane prasiddh the ki kaha jaataa he ek baar tibet ke raja ne is vishvavidhyalay ke pradhan ko tibet main aamantrit karne ke liye doot bheje the taaki swadeshi gyaan ore jan-saamaanya kii samskruti main ruchi jagaai ja sake

 These later became important centers of Buddhist education
 yaheen se hokar resham ke saath-saath jed naamak bahumoolya pathar, ghode tathaa anya mahatvapurn vastuon kaa vyapaar hua karata tha

 In history, a proof of the relationship between India and Khotan is that the movement of monks and teachers continued
 vahaan se praapt pehali shatabdi ke sikkon par ek ore chini bhashaa main likhaa hua he to duusari ore praakrit bhashaa main kharoshti lipi main
 This testifies to the mixed culture of Khotan
