 pump ek yantric yukti he jo gaison va dravon ko dhakelkar visthapit karne ke kaam aati he
 In other words, the pump works by pushing the liquid from the low pressure to the high pressure
 pump bahut pracheen kaal se hi nimna dharaatal par bhare hue, athwa behate hue, pani kaa udanchan kar unche dharaatal par laane ke liye anek prakaar ke upkarnon or sadhano kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In the various verticals of the modern era, many types of liquids inevitably have to use a special device to lift and move them, called pumps
 panpon kii pravidhi maapen or paribhaashaayen nimnlikhit hai : Static suctioning - The height that a pump can lift a fluid from its primary level is called the suction uptake of that pump
 yah drav ke sangrahasthaan main drav ke upree tal se pump ke silinder kii madhya rekha tak pani jaati he
 Suction Head - When the pump is placed below the bottom of its static suction, the pressure of the fluid in the suction tap is the suction head, in proportion to the remaining hoisting speed
 sthitik nikaas shirash - pump ke silinder kii madhya rekha se nikaas nal ke khule munh kii urdhwadhar duuri ko sthitik nikaas sheersh kehete hai
 Abrasive Heads - The resistance equivalent of the flow that occurs in the ventricular tubes that are associated with the expulsion of fluids is called the friction head
 vegatmak sheersh - nishkasana nalon main taral padaarth kaa pravaah banaae rakhane ke liye dabaav ke rup main jitne sheersh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use vegatmak sheersh kehete hai
 Absolute static head - The absolute vertical distance in the fluid collector up to the mouth of the exhaust pipe at the top of the fluid is called the absolute static head
 samgr sheersh - chushan dwaar or nikaas dwaar par honevaali daabon kaa antar samgr sheersh kehalaata he
 When a pump is planned to be installed it becomes necessary to consider the quantity of all the above heads
 dhanatmak visthaapan pump - dhanatmak visthaapan pump drav kii ek nishchit raashi ko grahan karke nirvahan pipe main visthapit karata he
 Some positive displacement pumps use an expansion cavity on the suction side and a decreasing cavity on the discharge side
 chushan paksh par guha vistarit hone ke kaaran pump main taral pravaah karata he or taral baahar guha se nikalataa he jaha kaa guha kaa aakaar kam hota he tathaa daab adhik hota he
 The given amount of liquid is constant in each cycle of operation
 koi bhi drav pump main tab tak swat: bahakar neeche se upar kii ore nahin aa saktaa, jab tak chushan pranali se hawa athwa us drav kii vaashp ko baahar nahin nikaal diya jaataa, jisase bheetar kaa daab baahar kii daab se kam ho jaay
 When turned on, the reciprocating pump and rotational pump automatically create such a situation, but the centrifugal pump cannot
 unke liye aavashyak he ki udandhit kiya janevaala drav unki pehali pankhudi tak bharaa ho, tabhi ye apkendri jal ke dwaara us drav ko gati pradaan kar usamen bahaav utpann kar sakate hai
 That is why it is necessary to put them on positive origin, but this is not always practicable in practice
 at: unke chushan nal main se hawa aadi ko nikaalkar nirvaat karne ke liye jin prayuktiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, unhen apkraman prayukti kehete hai
 In many pumps, these types of applications are made in its main part
 is kaaran unhen swapakraman pump kehete hai
 In many pumps, they are installed or done separately
 kai panpon main to yah kaam vashpachaalit vayunirvatak se hota he or kai main yantrachaalit nirvatak pump se kiya jaataa he, jo usee pump kii motor se patte dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 When using this type of vacuum, some gaps are placed in the pump's axle, because the pump's potholes have to run dry until all the air in the suction system is exhausted
 ye yantra bhi teen prakaar ke hote hai, pratham to pistonyukt pratyaagaamee, duusare niyat kriyangi ghurnani prakaar ke, jo alag pankhen ke rup main hote hai or tisare ghurnani drav kundaliyukt, jinhen chaalu karne ke pehle unki kundali main thodaa pani bharna hota he
 a diesel pump from the Netherlands made in the 19th century 1977 main soviet sangh main bana 'П3' teen silinderon vaala gotakhori kaa pump Domestic Central Heating Pump do paralikaaon vaala pump a Greek mathematician named Diophantus, who probably lived in the third century after Christ, studied many polynomial nonlinear equations and found their solutions in integers
 kintu aadhunik tathyon ke prakaash main ab isamen koi sandesh nahin rah gaya he ki diophants se bahut pehle hi bhartiya ganitagyon ne is kshetra main atyant mahatvapurn kaary kar liya tha
 In diophantic problems the number of equations is less than the number of variables
 in samikarnon main charon ke gunank purnank hote hai or charon kaa aisa purnank maan praapt karnaa hota he jo in samikarnon ko santusht karen
 Therefore, all those equations are named diophantic equations in which the coefficients of the variables are integers
 diophanteey samasyaon ke ganitiya adhyayan ko aajkal diophanteey vishleshan kehete hai
 Every diophantic equation has been used in history as an extinguisher, but the general theory of diophantic equations is considered a major mathematical achievement of the twentieth century
 diophanteey vishleshan main praaia: nimnlikhit prashnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he- The integer solution of diophantic equations is found in the Shulbasutras composed from 800 BCE to 500 BCE
 lagbhag 800 isapurv main boudhayan ne yugapat diophanteey samikarnon kaa hal do dhanatmak purnaakon kaa set ke rup main praapt kiya tha
 He also tried to solve the simultaneous diophantic equations involving four unknown sums
 600 isapurv main aapstamb ne 5 agyaat raashiyon vaale diophanteey samikarnon kaa hal karne kii koshish kii thi
 Indian mathematicians have been working towards finding integer solutions to equations of type ax + by = c { \ displaystyle ax + by = c} since time immemorial
 yadhyapi aajkal inhen 'diophanty sameekaran' kaha jaataa he kintu diophants se bahut pehle shulbasutron main aisi ganitiya samasyaon kii vishad charchaa he
 The period of the Shulbasutras dates back to 800 BCE or even earlier
 aryabhat ne is prakaar kii samasyaon ke hal ko 'kuttak' naam diya he
 Bhaskar has given the following kuttak in Aryabhatiya's commentary - arthath purnank n { \ displaystyle N} nikaalo jahaan n = 8 x + 5 = 9 y + 4 = 7 z + 1 { \ displaystyle N=8x+5=9y+4=7z+1} 
 Solving this brings the value of n { \ displaystyle N} to 85 { \ displaystyle 85}
 'kuttak' kaa shabdic arth 'kootane vaala' he
 The Kuttak method is actually a recursive method
 vartmaan samay main bhaskar dwaara 621 i main vyakhya sahit di gayi is vidhi ko 'aryabhat kii kalanvidhi' kehete hai jo pratham ghaat vaale diophanty samikarnon ke hal kii maanak vidhi ban gayi he
 Similarly, Brahmagupta has solved the following indeterminate equation: brahmagupta ke 'khandakhadyak' naamak granth main 'kuttakadhyay' naamak ek puraa adhyay he

 However, at that time the Government of India had announced that India's nuclear program would be for peaceful purposes and this test was done to make India self-reliant in the field of energy
 baad main 11 or 13 may 1998 ko paanch or bhumigat parmaanu pareekshan kiye or bharat ne swayan ko parmaanu shakti sampann desh ghoshit kar diya
 In response to this test, Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests shortly thereafter on 28 May 1998

 On 11 and 13 May 98 in India, there was a panic in the whole world due to two or three nuclear explosions in Pokhran, Rajasthan at the place of Buddha
 ab bharat bhi parmaanu shaktiyon main sampann he
 The whole world was shocked by these explosions of testing

 The impact of these tests was more on the rich countries
 america, rus, france, japan or china aadi deshon ne bharat ko aarthik sahaayta na dene kii dhamkee bhi di
 But India did not succumb to these threats
 in parikshanon ko karne kaa mukhya uddeshy vishwa ko yah bataa dena tha ki padosi deshon kii samrik yogyata kaa ve munh tod uttar dene main samarth the
 He was self-sufficient to defend himself and protect
 bharat main in pareekshanon kaa virodh karne vaale viksit desh yah bhul gayi the ki bharat main 1974 main ek or 1998 main paanch parmaanu pareekshan huue the
 While 2052 nuclear tests had already been done all over the world
 in main se america ne sabase adhik aanse pareekshan 1945 se ab tak 1032 kiye hai
 Apart from this, the Soviet Union has conducted 715, France 210, Britain 457 or China has 44 nuclear tests
 pakistan ore israel ke bare main praayah kaha jaataa he ki ve bhi parmaanu pareekshan kii kshamta rakhte he or kabhi bhi unki ore se parmaanu pareekshan kaa samachar mil saktaa he
 India has five main nuclear tests
 un ko mukhya rup se chaar shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he

 One of the objectives of this test was to obtain such data, beyond which computer-based tests could be conducted in the laboratory

 Its destructive capability is a thousand times more than that of a normal nuclear bomb
 parmaanu bam kii visphotak kshamta ko kilo ton main maapte he jabaki hydrogen bam kii kshamta ko megawatt main napate he
 All kilo tons of tests were conducted again in India on 13 May
 ye parikshan sab kiloton yaa ek kiloton se kam kshamta vaale the
 After this test, it has been claimed that these have enabled the ability of computer simulation and in-depth testing done in laboratories in India
 aaj vishwa main lagbhag 60 hajaar parmaanu hathiyaar hai jin ko nasht karne main kam se kam 20 se 25 varsh lagenge
 As a result of disarmament only 10 thousand nuclear weapons could be destroyed
 is se spsht he ki parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa khatra to bana hi rahegaa
 Therefore, India has made this effort for its self-defense
 bharat main parmaanu bam kaa pareekshanjab china or america ke jaise deshon ke paas hydrogen bam ho gaye to inhone ek sanghathan banaakar duniya par dadagiri dikhaani shuru kar di or duusare deshon dwaara shuru kiye gaye parmaanu kaaryakramon kaa virodh shuru kar diya
 China started showing bigotry to India, which also forced India to make hydrogen bombs
 iske baad bharat ne sikret mishan ke tahat parmaanu bam bananaa shuru kiya or 11 may 1998 main atal vihari vajpayi kii sarkaar main hydrogen bam kaa safal pareekshan kiya
 The Government of India did not allow any country to even get the news of this test and as soon as the test was done, there was chaos in the whole world
 us samay bharat kii bhi isi tarah se aalochana ho rahi thi jis tarah se aaj uttar korea kii ho rahi he
 The United Nations imposed all kinds of economic sanctions on India, which Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to suffer and India's economic development suffered greatly, but the advantage was that China stopped showing bigotry on us
 aaj bharat china se bhi tej gati se vikaas kar rahaa he
 Apart from India, Pakistan and Israel also claim to have hydrogen bombs, but Israel has not tested any atomic bomb till date and Pakistan did not have the edge in testing which should be in a hydrogen bomb

 Whitehall Palace or Palace of Whitehall was a former palace located in the city of Westminster, London

 Unfortunately in 1698, due to a fierce fire, this palace was completely destroyed

 Before the fire, this palace used to be the largest palace in Europe
 us samay, is mahal main kul 1500 kamare hua karte the, or ek samay main yah duniya kii sabase badi imaarat hua karata tha
 There are many government buildings and offices in place of the palace today, so much so that in Britain, the term "whitehall" is also used as an epithet to describe the government

 The first building on its site was built by the Archbishop of York under the name York Place, which was then the largest palace in London
 1530 main, archbishap ke nilamban ke baad, yah mahal, shahi mahal ban gaya jab henry saptam, england ke raja ne is mahal ko apana mukhya nivas bana liya tha
 The palace got its name "whitehall" due to its white color

 The Spanner's purpose was to emphasize experience and emotion, moving away from both blind faith and debate
 uskaa mat pavitratavaad ke naam se prasiddh hua
 At the same time, Michel the Moulinos, a theologian from Spain, who was a Catholic matanusian, published a book called "spiritual Guide"
 usne bhi dharm kii anubhavik vyakhya kii
 Mystic tendencies were flourishing since the medieval period
 sant tamas equinus ne apni "summaa thiologia" main maansik bhavan ko "nity satya kaa saral rup" sweekaar kiya tha
 Other mystic saints also emphasized the experience of stable, quiet moments rather than externalism
 solahavin shatabdi main spain ke nari sant terreja ne maansik shanti, athwa maunavastha kii vishesh rup se vyakhya kii thi
 He said that this is not a state of inaction, of "busy rest", in which the soul abandons its lustful desires and becomes God-like in the same way as CP plays its mouth to drink the waters of the ocean
 sant terreza ne is maun main man kii graahak avasthaa ko aavashyak mana tha tathaa to usne seepi kii bhanti munh kholkar sagar kaa jal lene kii baat kii thi
 Moulinos silenced Saint Tereza and tried to explain
 usne dharna or bhavan main antar karte hue bataaya ki pehali avasthaa bauddhik he
 The mind is actively involved in Christian beliefs
 bhavan kii avasthaa main vah prabhu ke prem main dub jaataa hai
 He has the objection or interview of God
 vah ishwar se sambanddh ho jaataa he
 According to Molinos, the state of silence lacks all purposes, desires, thoughts and resolutions
 yah sansaarik vastuon se purna viraam kii avasthaa he
 For his ideas, Moulinos had to go before the "holy Inquiry" in 1685
 use aaajeevan karawas bhugtan padaa
 He died there in 1697
 kintu, maunvaadee andolan kaa ant na hua
 Moulinos's ideas influenced Madame Guyan of France
 vah ek dhani parivaar kii sushikshit mahila thi, jo vaivaahik jivan sukhmay na hone se dharm kii ore mud gai thi
 He tried to explain the prohibitive side of silence
 apane anuyaayi fenelon ko usne ek patr main bataaya tha ki udbodhan ke kshan se use apni maun prarthanaaon main kabhi kisi aakaar, vichaar yaa bimb kii chetana nahin hui
 This element was also indicated in Moulinos's "guide"
 usne likhaa tha ki ishwar kaa gyaan sweekaaroktiyon se adhik nishedyon se hota he
 Fenelon clarified the prohibitive side of silence in his sermons
 madam guyaan se prabhaav main aane ke purv vah catholic sangh kii ore se niyukt "ant:karan kaa nideshak" tha
 But in his book "hymns of Saints" published in 1689, he wrote for "pure mental expressions" that "it is a prohibitive state
" isamen kisi indriyasanvedya vastu kaa bimb, koi namakhya vichaar nahin rahata
 This is a state of pure intellectual and subtle thought of power "
 europea adhyetaon ke vichaar se fenelon ke haath main padakar yah mat bhartiya bautddh mat kii bhanti shoonyavaadee ho gaya tha
 Thus, for the achievement of silence, this practice considers it necessary to practice two mental tendencies - subservience and indifference
 kintu, in sabase adhik mahatv us kshan kaa he, jisamen sant terreja yaa madam guyaan ko bodh hua tha
 This is a rare moment in which the soul surrenders completely to God
 aatma kaa yah samarpan baar baar nahin hota
 That's why the Maunists call it Faqhi Karmaf
 is karm ke baad maun kii avasthaa swaabhaavik ho jaati he
 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, silence was considered a strong trend of religious awakening in Spain and France
 kintu is prakaar kii sabhi pravritiyon kaa uddeshy dharmik anushaasan kam karnaa tathaa manushya kii bauddhik swatantraaa kii raksha karnaa tha
 Therefore, along with the fulfillment of these objectives, the various tendencies of the religious movement also disappeared

 So according to this test, namakan prakriya : Tailoring is an effortless behavior in Hanuman langur and according to biologist Runwal it has many styles in langurs in India
 punch vahan kii in shaileyon ke aadhaar par languron ko samoohon main baanta ja saktaa he
 The Hanuman langur of the old world is found almost all over India, and Hindus consider it an incarnation of Lord Hanuman
 philip kaa kahana he ki bhashaa or sahitya main yah kaale moonh or lambi poonch vaala bandar langul kaa paryaay he
 In zoology, the langur comes in Narwanar Gan, previously named Presbytes antellus and describes 16 varieties, but after around 2000, it was named Semnopithecus, and most of its varieties were changed to species
 arthath hanuman langur yaa pressbites, jisaki poonch kii baat yahan ho rahi he, use ab semnopithekas kehete hai
 The first part of this article describes the four main styles of tail movements in langurs, in the second part a comparison of the tail-carrying styles of Hanuman and langurs, and finally an introduction to the unique tail of some other species of monkey

 Almost all of the langurs of northern India make a ring by moving their tail from the top of the back towards the head, and the front part of the tail falls on the right or left side of the body
 yah uttari style he
 In contrast, almost all of the South Langurs raise their tail from the point of origin to the back of the head, dropping the front part, forming the shape of the English letter 'S'

 In his studies, Runwal found that in which the tail of the langur in the Himalayas leads the head above the back, but the front of the tail remains above the back, and the ring is open from one side
 yah uttari himalay style he
 In the far south of India and in Sri Lanka, in which the langurs raise the tail from the place of origin and take it almost in the shape of the letter 'S' in English, but the front part of the tail does not drop down, leaving it open

 Following are some other main things related to tail transportation in Hanuman Langur

 The word Langur relates the origin of the word to Philip Langul, and Hanuman added to it over time
 iskaa shrey valmiki rishi ko jaataa he, jinhone ram katha main hanuman ko paatr liya
 Philip says that the langur is also associated with humans in many other forms
 jaise langur ke ek copi ke rup main manushya se sambandh ko manyata charles darwin ke siddhant se bhi milti he, jisamen manushyon kii utpatti vaanron se bataai gayi
 Historians and scholars consider Hanuman to be the god of primitive India
 hanuman kii akruti aadha manushya aadha pashu he, isliye in vidwaanon ke anusaar vrish-copi shabd bhi hanuman ke liye prayog hota he, jo guhamanav kaa sanket he
 Explaining the relationship between Devi and Langurvir, Philip links Hanuman to common man's beliefs, such as the songs of the languria in Bhadavar, and the langur dance in Amritsar, Punjab
 amritsar main dashahara ke tyohaar ke aate hi log desh-videsh se hanuman mandir main aana shuru ho jate hai
 Devotees take the form of langurs, mask Hanuman on the mouth, mace in hand, long tail, barefoot, jump and dance, reaching the temple from their place of residence
 yah kaarykram puure das din chalata he
 The langur dance is performed to ask for a vow to attain child, and then to express happiness after the child is born
 ramayana ke paatr or vanarasena ke nayak ke rup main hanuman jan maanas main mahavir ke rup main ruuch gaye
 Art and literature depicted Hanuman in various forms
 yahan tak ki angreji sahitya bhi isse achoota nahin rahaa
 Rudyard Kipling described monkeys and langurs in his books along with other animals
 freeda housevirth das kii puri pustak languron ke saamaajik vyavhaar or manushyon se sambandhon par urisa kii prashtbhumi main he
 Octavio Paz also illustrated the myth of Hanuman in his book
 runvaal, jinhone languron main punch vahan kaa vistaar se adhyayan kiya, jiskaa parichay pehle bhaag main diya gaya, uparokt maanav-bandar sambandhon ko dharmajeevigyaan ke antargat chinhit kiya
 In this direction, he took the initiative of studying tailings in Hanuman and Langur
 runvaal ne hanuman ke un chitron kaa adhyayan kiya jinamein punch spasht dikhaai detii he
 Painters have engraved Hanuman's tail in the shape of the letter 'S' in English parallel to the back
 runvaal likhte hai shaayad chitrakaar vaastavik languron main punch vahan kii style se anbhigya hai
 If he had known, then in North India, Hanuman's tail style would have been made in the northern form, ie not in the shape of the letter 'S' in English
 runvaal likhte hai lenius ne swayan punch kii lambaai ko vargikaran kaa mahatvapurn gun mana tha, or nayi duniya or puraani duniya ke bandaron ko ek upasamooh main rakhaa jiskaa naam sarkopithesai yaa punch vaale vanar diya
 But there are also some monkey species that have a tail name, such as mini-tails and Japanese monkeys
 nayi duniya ke adhikansh bandaron main punch zyada lambi to hoti hi he, kuch main yah paanchave haath ke rup main pakadaney ke kaam aati he, jaise laal hoular bandar
 The red-faced monkey, known in the Old World as the Rhesus monkey, may have a small tail, but is the dominant leader's identity in adult males
 is prajati main runvaal ne punch kaa kai vyavhaarik sthitiyon main adhyayan kiya
 And an idiom running under the tail, sits right here, seeing a monkey coming from his dominant monkey, lowering the tail and goes to the other side
 sher-puchh bandar, jo dakshin bharat kaa khubasurat bandar he, apni punch se mashhoor he
 Its black body and halo of gray-white hair around the face is helpful in making it look like a lion
 yah langur ek jagaa se dusri jagaa chalaang lagaate hue agar pahuchane me asamarath ho jaaai to apni punch ke sahare jameen pe paanv rakhe bina raasate se utana waapas aa jaataa he|yah isliye hota he kayonki isaki punch ek tarah kaa aakarnan hota he| If the langur is unable to reach it by taking another leap from a wake, then he comes back without putting his feet on the ground with his tail
 Why bhashaa hindi kii ek saahitiyik patrika he

 Mohan Lal Sukhadia had been the Chief Minister of Rajasthan for the longest time

 beawar ke shikshit evam pragatisheel samaaj ke logon ne arya samaaj kii vaidic reeti se yah vivaah 1 june, 1938 ko sampann karavaaya
 In his memoirs, Sukhadia ji has written that "it was my duty to go to Nathdwara after marriage to get the blessings of mother, which seemed to me the most fearful and mentally annoying; but there was a lot of anger in me
" jo maan mujhe bachapan main sneh se paalati rahi tathaa hazaron kalpanaaen mere liye sanjoti raheen, vahi aaj mujhase milane main aatmaglani or munh dekhne main ghrinaa tathaa maut kii si anubhuti kar uthi he
 It was a strange situation for me
 isamen maan kaa bhi kya dosha tha? vah aise hi vaataavaran main pali thi
 Throughout his life, he was constantly engaged in untouchability in the devotion and practice of Shrinathji
 vah bhala mere is vivaah se kaise prasann hokar aashirwad de sakati thi? or unke is vyavhaar ke prati meraa bhi krodh kaise shant ho saktaa tha? donon ore hi majaburi thi
 The friendship of friends was also to be tested at this time
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki nathdwara kaa vaishnav samaaj sakriy rup se meraa virodh karne vaala tha, lekin mere mitron ne isaki tanik bhi parvaah nahin kii or mujhe ek buggy main var or indu ko vadhoo ke vesh main bithakar mere chaaron ore gheraa banaakar ek juluus nikaala
 The procession marched through the entire market of Nathdwara
 ‘mohan bhaiya jindabad’ ke naare bhi lagaae
 Revolved the entire city
 kisi bhi virodh main mitron ke pair nahin ukhde
 Perhaps such a grand and uncommon procession as the Chief Minister did not come out, it was such a unique and unique procession
 " Thus Mohan Lal Sukhadia, a strong opponent of evils like caste and untouchability, was a pioneer of social progress and change, who not only created awareness in the society for progress, but in spite of fierce opposition from the society and family, his own life Freed from the shackles of caste and caste presented the ideal

 cricket ke khel main pagabaadha ) ballebaaj ko out karne kii ek vidhi he
 An umpire declares a batsman to be LBW out under a series of circumstances, when the ball that can hit the batsman's wicket primarily hits the batsman's body
 elbeadblyoo niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye ballebaaj apane balle ke sthaan par sharir kaa istemaal na kare
 LBW is commonly known as the most complex rule of the game
 leg bifor wicket shabd main leg kaa prayog hone ke baavjood, yah niyam tab bhi lagu hota he jab balla thaamne vaale haath ke dastaane ko chhod kar gend ballebaaj ke sharir ke kisi anya hisse se takaraae
 The rule of LBW was not included in the rules of cricket until 1744
 sarvapratham is niyam kaa prayog 1774 main hua, jiske anusaar: ballebaaj ko out mana jayega yadi xxrep 5 
 yaa phir ballebaaj gend ko rokane ke liye apni taang wicket ke saamne adaae or gend ko wicket se takaraane se roak de
 While the use of the LBW rule was most definitely caused by the batsman deliberately snapping legs and feet in order not to hit the ball with the wicket, early writers such as John Nairn were known for this deliberate work by Tom Taylor and Joey Ring is considered responsible
 haalanki, unka kareer 1774 ke baad shuru hua or, jaisaa ki arthur hegarth bataate hai, " in paraspar virdohi bayanon main ab saamanjasy sthapit karnaa asambhav he"
 For this reason the rule of LBW was not recorded for many years
 agast 1795 main maulsi hurst main hue sarre banaam england ekadash ke match main jon tafton ko jon wales dwaara elbeadblyoo niyam ke tahat out kiya gaya tha
 According to Hegarth: In this match, for the first time it was found that "pagbadha" has been recorded
 In Brisher's printed score-book, in this match Mr
 J
 Tftan is simply described as bold, and the note is written lamb
 shuruyaat main, jab koi bhi ballebaaj is tareeke se out hota tha, to keval aisa likhaa jaataa tha ki vah bold hua he or pagabaadha nahin likhaa jaataa tha
 In essence, the essence of this rule is: yadi gend ballebaaj se takaraati he jo ki wicket se takaraane vaali thi, to use elbeadblyoo qaraar diya jaataa he, jab tak ki: Note: Balls falling off the leg side mean that fifty percent or more of the ball must be outside the leg stump
 iske alaava, of stump se baahar ballebaaj se takaraane vaali gend kaapchaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa of stump kii line ke baahar ballebaaj se takaraana chahie
 Despite its complications, the catch (after catch and bold) is the most common type of dismissal in cricket
 ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar dene kii sharten nimna hai: There are three rules to explain these situations: The exception to this involves the umpire's decision whether the batsman has attempted to hit the ball or not
 is niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya he taaki ballebaaj of stump se baahar gend ko sirf pad par na khele, jisase balle se gend takaraa kar kaich dene kii sambhaavna samaapt ho jaati he
 a common defensive strategy against spin bowlers is to use pads to avoid the ball at the off stump, but the LBW rule means that their bat is close to the pad, allowing fielders standing in the slip to catch a catch, or their LBW likely to be out
 richi banode jaise kuch samikshakon ne sujhaayaa he ki elbeadblyoo niyam ko kuch is prakaar badalanaa chahie ki leg stump se thodi baahar tappa padane par bhi ballebaaj ko out qaraar diya ja sake, jisase legspinron ko madad milegi or nakaaratmak pad-play se bachaa ja sakegaa
 The LBW rule is always reviewed by the umpire standing at the bowler's end
 agar kshetrarakshan karne vaali team kaa maananaa he ki ek ballebaaj elbeadblyoo out ho saktaa he, to unhen nirnay ke liye ampire se anurodh karnaa chahie
 All lbw conditions must be evaluated for the ball, which takes half a second to reach the batsman
 niyamon ke anya pahaluon ke rup main, ballebaaj ko hameshaa kisi bhi andeh kaa laabh diya jaataa he, isliye, yadi ampire santusht nahin he, to anurodh ko thukraa diya jayega
udhaaharan ke rup main yadi gend ke ballebaaj se takaraane se pehle ballebaaj ek kadam aage bad jaataa he
 The ball may have hit the wicket in the future, but it is very difficult for an umpire to be sure that the ball will be 1
5–2 meters from the wicket when the batsman hits the leg
 televijan riple ke madhyam se ab yah bataanaa saral ho gaya he ki elbeadblyoo kii sabhi sharton ko puraa kiya gaya tha yaa nahin or isliye kuch log shikaayat karte hai ki ek ampire ne ballebaaj ko galat tareeke se khel jari rakhane ke liye kaha yaa use galat tareeke se out qaraar de diya
 However, before an umpire gives a batsman out, one must be sure that he is out or not and since they do not have any facilities like TV replays, the decision of the umpire is usually justified
 adhikansh khiladi or camentator is nirnay ko sweekaar karte hai or ampiron kii aalochana bahut kam hoti he
 LBW is arguably the most difficult of the umpires to decide and may cause comment and controversy among viewers
 haal ke varshon main, cricket main badhate dabaav or daanv par lage paison ke kaaran kai log anishchit maamalon main camaron kii bhoomika ko badhaane or hoque-ai jaisi simulation takanic ke prayog par jor de rahe hai
 At the moment, LBW is a decision that is only taken by the umpire standing on the field
 tathaapi badlaav kii hawa chal padi he: sitambar 2005 main, antarrashtriya cricket parishad ne ampiron dwaara televijan riple ke madhyam se nirnay lene main sahaayta karne ke liye ek pareekshan ko adhikrut kiya
 
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki yadi gend pehle pad se takaraati he or phir balle se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he lekin yadi ballebaaj gend ko balle se martha he tathaa iske baad gend uske pad se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko us maamle main out ghoshit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in both cases, there is a risk of a batsman being caught out as the ball may bounce relatively slowly and be caught by a fielder
 yadi gend bina tappa khaae ballebaaj se takaraae, to us sthiti main gend ke tappa padane ke baad ke kisi bhi sambhavit vichlan ko andekha karte hue ampaire ko gend kii gati evam oochaal dwaara isaki disha kaa anumaan lagaana padataa he
 However, the umpire may take into account the swing or flow of the ball before determining whether the ball will hit the wicket
 agar gend swing kar rahi he to ampaire ko yah anumaan lagane kii anumati he ki gend usee disha main swing hogi athwa nahin
 There is a misconception that the batsman cannot get out lbw when the ball hits the leg stump
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki leg stump ke baahar tappa khaane vaali gend kaa parinaam note out hoga, tathaapi elbeadblyoo kanoon ke kii sateek paribhaasha or no ball kii vartmaan paribhaasha ke anusaar, ek asaamaanya paristhiti main iskaa apwaad bhi he
 24
6 Under the rule, a ball will be considered a valid ball only if it bounces twice
 The 36
1 rule states that if the ball "hits the ball in a straight line between the wicket to wicket or the batsman's off-side wicket if it does not stop before it collapses", then the batsman is out lbw
 " yahaan dhyaan dene yogya he ki, niyam 36
1 main leg said kaa koi ullekh nahin he, na hi isamen kaha gaya he ki aisi sthiti ek se adhik baar ho
 is prakaar ek gend jo ki do baar uchhalati he, kaa parinaam elbeadblyoo ho saktaa he bhale hi usame ek tappa leg stump kii line se baahar ho
 antarrashtriya cricket main aaj tak koi bhi ballebaaj is dhang se out nahin hua he
 LBW is a term used on 21 November 1934 to describe a change in footpath rule made by the Marilybon Cricket Club
 1935 main yah england main astitv main aayaa tha, lekin australia main ucch str ke adhikariyon dwaara iskaa virodh kiya gaya jahaan yah 1936 / 1937 satr tak lagu nahin ho sakaa tha, haalanki australia main 1935 / 1936 ke satr ke dauraan club maichon main ise lagu karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 According to this change, LBW out can be declared even if it falls outside the off stump if the batsman prevents it from any part of his body in the straight line between wicket to wicket
 isse pehle, sirf gendbaaj ke chor tathaa ballebaaj kii viketon ke bich kii sidhi rekha main padane vaali gendon dwaara hi elbeadblyoo out kiya ja saktaa tha
 The term "LBW" refers to the fact that in the scorecards published by Wisden from 1935 to 1937, the wickets taken by the new turban rule were different from the wickets of the earlier rules of 1935
 1920 evam 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan pratham shrenee cricket kii visheshta ballebaajon dwaara gendbaajon par badhata prabhutv tha
 With a world record of 1107 runs by Victoria against New South Wales on MCG in 1926 / 1927, Australia had an exceptionally high run rate during the 1920s
 1928 main, county cricket main ek wicket lene kii ausat keemat 30 ran thi jo 1901 kii apni pichhali ucch keemat 27
5 ko paar kar gai thi
 Attempts to block the number of runs allowed by the LBW decision, regardless of whether the batsman played the ball, were partially successful in 1929, but during the 1930s test matches showed extremely high runs and many draw matches

 asi vidyut shakti par kaam kar rahe kisi udbhaar dwaara liye gayi vaastavik shakti tathaa abhaasi shakti ke anupaat ko shakti gunak yaa shakti gunank kehete hai
 The numerical value of the power coefficient is between zero and 1
 shakti gunak = p / s The average value of power taken by a load is called 'actual power'
 yahi shakti lod main ushma main badalati he, yantric kaary karti he yaa kisi anya prakaar kii urja main badalati he
 Whereas the virtual power is only a mathematical amount equal to the product of the voltage between the ends of the load and the current flowing through the load)
 shakti gunank vibhavaantar tathaa dhara ke bich ke kalaantar ke kojya ke baraabar hota he
 Power multiplier = p / s arthath shakti gunank acha hone ke liye jaruri he ki voltage or dhara ke bich main kalaantar bahut kam ho
 When the current is behind the voltage, it is called lagging power factor; When the current is ahead of the voltage, it is called 'leading power-factor'
 udyogon main induction motor evam anya prerakatv-yukt lodon ke kaaran shakti-gunank praaia: pichhadaa hua hi rahata he
 It is not considered good to take electric power at a power coefficient of less than 1 by a load and most power supply companies provide some penalty for it
 kam shakti gunank kaa sidhaa sa arth yah he ki jo kaam 'utility' se kam dhara lekar hi kiya ja saktaa uske liye adhik dhara lee ja rahi he
 Due to this greater current, the transmission line increases power loss; Transformers, circuit breakers and other things require higher ratings
 ek aur bat ye hoti hai ki cos0 ka man adhiktam hota hai When the current is not cyclic, the power multiplier is referred to in terms of the first harmonic of the fury range of the current

 Additionally, prior to the overthrow of English in the early 20th century, French was the principal language of diplomacy and dialogue between European and colonial powers, as well as the colloquial language of the educated class of Europe
 likhi hui francisi main agar shabd ke ant main agar ye vyanjan aate hai : s, t, f, c, q,, x, p, n, m, to saadharantaya inkaa uccharan nahin hota
 So if it is spelled français, it will be pronounced French, not Frances
 "na" or "m" swaron ko nasiky bana sakate hai
 Other consonants are often pronounced when they come at the end of a word

 Only by bringing revolutionary awareness at the social level towards their history, language-civilization-culture, their identity and existence can be saved, in which all sections of society have to come forward and ensure their participation
 totemic kudmi adivasi samudaay, jo 1950 tak munda, uraanv, ho, santhal aadi anya adivasi samudaayon ke saath aadim janajati kii soochi main shaamil thi, 1950 main anusuchit janajati kii soochi banaaye jane ke samay bhulvash yaa kisi gahari sajeesh ke tahat bina kisi notification ke usamen shaamil karne se chhod diye gayi
 While the 12-member report by Dr
 Hridaynath Kunjru also clearly states that in 1950, the same tribes were included in the list of Scheduled Tribes, which were included in the list of Primitive Tribes of 1931, then why such injustice to the Kudmis
 was done? Possibly or perhaps with the ulterior motive of reducing the percentage of tribals and transferring the lands of the kudumis
 jo bhi ho, aaj kudmi adivasi samudaay adivasi hote hue bhi, bhartiya uttaradhikaar kanoon 1865 evam 1925 ke praavdhaanon se mukt rahane ke baavjood, jharkhand sarkaar ke dastavej main "gaiyr sarkari adivasi" ke rup namit / chinhit hone ke baad bhi pichley 66 saalon se apni khoi hui pahchaan, astitv, va haq-adhikaar waapas paane ko sangharshrat he, magar sarkari udaseenta or mahaj vot bank kii raajnneeti kaa hissaa banakar istemaal hote rahane ke kaaran apane haq-adhikaar se maharoom he
 "the status of Scheduled Tribes is our constitutional and birthright and we shall take it in all circumstances", with this pledge is a revolutionary call for all sections of the society to come forward in a positive and accurate direction, because in this way the welfare of society and the state Is implicit

 It was the northeastern section of the Deccan Plateau, which, along with the Deccan Plateau, broke up about 120 million years ago and broke northward for 5 crore years after the breakup of Gondwana and then collided with Eurasia
 chotanagpur pathaar aadi kaal se adivaasiyon kaa nivas sthaan rahaa he, jahaan ho, munda, santhal, uraanv aadi janajatiy samudaayon ke saath kudmi / kurmi janajati bhi aadi kaal se saath saath rahete aa rahe hai
 But in today's present situation, the Totemic Kudmi tribals are struggling in the fight for their identity and existence, crushed between the policies of all-party bias
 du:khadaayi baat ye he, ki is krushijivi mehanatakash adivasee samudaay ko jane kis vajah se hameshaa upekshit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 There is no doubt that the Kudmi were tribals, and will remain
 magar yada kada inhen gaiyr adivasee sabit karne kii koshish kiya janaa evam iske liye tarah tarah ke choti-moti galtiyaan dhundhane or use ain-ken-prakaren sahi sabit karne kii koshish karnaa atyant durbhagyapurna he
 Sometimes they are very disappointing
 jaise, adivasee sirf apane jarurat ke utana hi kheti karte hai, jabaki kudmi mandi main bechney ke liye jarurat se adhik utpaadan karte hai, isaliye wo adivasee nahin hai
 What kind of reasoning is this? Meaning that the tribals, who only work according to their needs, mean they do not need more than that
 to phir unhen naukari karne yaa shaikshanik, rajnatik, aarthik yaa kisi bhi anya rup main aage badhane kii koi jarurat nahin! sirf apane jarurat ke jitna hi sanchay karen or usee main khush rahen, tabhi wo adivasee kahalaayenge, aisa he kya? kya adivasee kii yahi paribhaasha he? kuchhek kudmi ilaakon ke kisaan pichley kuch samay se dhan or sabji kii adhik utpaadan kar rahe hai, magar iske liye vahaan ke kisaanon ko chilchilaati dhoop main, barsaat main bheengte huye, kadakati thand main har mausam kii maar jhelte huye kadi mehnat kerani padati he, kyonki iske sivaay unke paas koi vikalp nahin he
 Due to my maternal uncle being in the same area, i have seen and have been watching from childhood, how when the working people keep sleeping peacefully till seven-eight in the morning, then they wake up in their fields from 4 o'clock in the morning
 Go work hard
 utpaadan se lekar nishpaadan tak kathor parishram ke chakra se guzarana padataa he
 In addition to meeting their other needs apart from time period, changing environment, inflation and food, they have to do so compulsively to worry about the future of children
 aabaadi ke anuroop padhane likhane ke baavjood naukariyon se vanchit or berozegaar rahanaa bhi iskaa ek bada kaaran he
 The prospect and situation in our region is not the same, so people do not do that much farming and they have to go to forced factories and work as laborers, where the situation between slavery and exploitation is even more frightening

 magar ye donon shabd kii utpatti kab, kahaan or kaise hui? jharkhand alag rajya banane se pehle muulavaasi shabd kaa astitv nahin tha
 After the separation of Jharkhand, the Jharkhandis were divided as tribals and indigenous people under the divide and rule policy and conspiracy
 rahi baat sadaan kaa to hamaare saathi dow
 rakesh mahato da ke anusaar yah shabd hindi to chhodie, kisi bhi bhashaa kii dixnary main nahin miltaa he
 The first use or discovery of the term was made by BP Kesari and his mentor, under whose leadership Kesari Babu did his phd
 kesari ji ne apane guru ji kaa sahaara lekar "jharkhand ke sadaan" naamak kitaab likhakar kudmi ko bhi jabardastee sadaan naamak kaalpanik samudaay main thunsane kii himakat kar daali
 Later, this effort by Kesari Ji, Bir Birottam, editor of Ranchi Express Balvir Dutt etc
 helped a lot in establishing the word Sadan
 kyonki isse kudmi jaise jharkhand ke sabase bade adivasee samudaay ko adivasee se hataakar apane saath milaane kaa badhia mauka unhen mil gaya tha
 This gave him two advantages, one being that the number of tribals in Jharkhand could be shown to be low and the other was the aspiration to show Kudmi as outsiders or non-tribals, while at the same time making the newly conceived so-called Sadan group powerful and influential

 ab ek or nayaa kahani ghoda ke saath joda ja rahaa he, jabaki ghode se kaaphi purana parichay jharkhandi adivasee samudaay ko he
 Because the Aryans had horses and due to the speed of the horse, the tribals in Harappa Mohenjodaro had to be defeated by the Aryans
 aaj bhi khelichandi aradhana main adivasee mitti kaa ghoda arpan karte hai tathaa apane aradhy se prarthana karte hai, ki jis ghode ke kaaran hamen aaryo ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha, hamen us ghode se suraksha de
 Then a new story and a new conspiracy begin, telling the Jharkhandi society unfamiliar with the horse
 jahaan tak kudmi kisaanon kii baat he, to kisaanon ke paas gaay, bail, bhens hote hai, ghoda nahin
 The basic thing is that due to the shortage of writers who write in the kudami, when they came to mind, they wrote it based on the things heard without proper research
 iske alaave jahaan kudamiyon kii sthiti-paristhiti va kudmi mahapurushon va shaheedon kii charchaa yaa zikr kerani / honi chaiye, vahaan nazarandaaj kiya gaya 
 The most unfortunate thing that happened to the Kurmis was the joining of the Kurudis of Chhotanagpur with the Kurmis of North India
 ye sara digbhram shuru hua 1894 main uttar pradesh main gathit 'ol india kurmi kshatriya mahasabha' ke dwaara failaaye gayi bhramjaal se
 In 1915, this organization demanded Kshatriya status for all Kurmis of India
 chunki chotanagpur ke kudamiyon ko bhi angreji main Kurmi likhte the, to samaan naam lagane ke kaaran inhone britishon ke saath milakar 1922 main inke liye bhi kshatriya states kii maang kii evam 1929 va 31 main rajya sarkaar va kendra sarkaar ko is sambandh main memorondam diya
 This demand was from outside Kurmis, not the totemic Kudmi tribes of Chotanagpur, it is worth noting
 magar kudmi adivaasiyon ke saath huye is gahare shadyantra ko samajhane ke bajaay purvaagrah se prerit sabhi ise darkinar karne main lage rahete hai
 In H
 H
 Rijle's 'tribes and Castes of Bengal' it is clearly mentioned that the Kudmi of Chhotanagpur belong to a tribal community of Dravidian species different from the Kurmis of Bihar
 sar grearsan ne 'linguistic survey of india' main ise or clear kiya he, ki print / pronounseshan mistek ke vajah se chotanagpur ke kudmi or bihar ke kurmi, jinhen donon ko angreji main 'KURMI' likhaa gaya, lekin yahaan chotanagpur ke janajati kudamiyon ke liye Hard 'R' or bihar ke kurmiyon ke liye Soft 'R' kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Kumar Suresh Singh has completely separated both 'KUDMI' and 'KURMI' in his Bihar volume of 'people of India' by giving a separate chapter
 isse sabit hota he, ki chotanagpur ke kudmi shesh bharat ke kurmiyon se purnataya bhinn hai
 There is no match between their language, culture, tradition, customs and any other way
 sabase bada fark inke gustidhari or gotradhari hone main he
 That is why the Kudmis of Chotanagpur have no connection with Shivaji Maharaj and Sardar Patel other than an Indian, which everyone should understand well
 kalantar main chotanagpur ke kudamiyon ke liye Kurmi shabd main sudhaar kar Kurmi Mahto kiya gaya evam jharkhand sarkaar dwaara Kurmi / Kudmi kiya gaya, haalanki prastaav Kudmi / Kurmi kaa tha, yahaan bhi gadabad kiya gaya
 The Kudmi tribal community was omitted from being included in the Scheduled Tribes list without any notification in 1950, while they were included in the list of primitive tribes in the earlier census, but the reasons for why it was abandoned in 1950 are unknown
 aakhir kudmi janajati ke saath aisa anyaay kyon kiya gaya? ye ek bahut badi sajeesh kaa hissaa thi, jiskaa makasad adivaasiyon kii jansankhya va pratishtata kam karnaa evam kudamiyon ke jameenon kaa hastantaran karne kaa ek sochi samajhi chaal thi
 For example, this peace-loving agrarian community has been evicted from its lands in the name of unfortunate development and this tradition continues unabated today
 yah bedakhal kal-kaarkaana, jalashay, bhugarbha khanan, shikshan-prashikshan sanstha, taap-vidyut sanstha evam mahanagar nirmaan aadi ke naam par kiya gaya he
 Examples of this are - Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Purulia, Rairangpur, Rourkela etc
 cities and reservoirs like Chandil, Hirakud, Maithon, Tilaiya, Kansavati etc
 and where the Tata, BSL etc
 have been most affected by the Kudmi society
 People have got more and only displacement in return

 It is not even for taking away anyone's rights, it is our constitutional right and it will not take away anyone's rights in any form, but will increase the power and power of tribals and fulfill the criteria of 'sixth Schedule'

 Like, it is said to other tribals that they want to take away your rights and Kudmi say to tribals, they do not want to give you your rights
 is shadyantra ke uddeshy ko bhi samajhane kii mahati aavashyaktaa he
 From time to time, many tribal intellectuals and leaders have also termed it unfair to not include the Kudamis in the Scheduled Tribes and have advocated the inclusion of the Kudmi community in the Scheduled Tribes list, ranging from Dr
 Ramdayal Munda to Dr
 Nirmal Minj, Shibu Soren , Surya Singh Besra etc
 are prominent

 iske alaave kai vidhayakon or saansadon ne samay samay par vidhaan sabha or sansad main iske samarthan main baat rakhi he
 But even after 67 years, it is very unfortunate to do politics only by not including the Kudmi community in the ST list so far and to keep the entire Kudmi community deprived of their rightful rights, their faith is insulted
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle bhaajapa ke mananeey saansad shri lakshmana gilua ji ne kudmi vikaas morcha ke sachiv ko likhit patr dekar ye aashwaasan diya tha, ki saansad banane ke baad wo kudmi samudaay ko anusuchit janajati kii suchi main shaamil karaane kii maang ko sansad main uchit dhang se rakhenge, magar do saal biit jane ke baad bhi mananeey saansad mahoday ne is disha main ab tak koi pahal nahin kii, jo apane aap main kai sawaal or virodhabhas khadey karti he tathaa inke vot kii raajnneeti kii pole kholte hue inke kathani or kerani ke antar ko saaf taur par ujagar karti he
 But this injustice is not only with the Kudmi tribals, but it is with the entire tribal community, if thought carefully and understood

 jaikab ne sansad ke donon sadanon main pesh kii thi, main jharkhand ke kudmi / kurmi samudaay ko "gaiyr sarkari adivasee" ke rup main namit / chinhit kiya gaya he
 It is necessary to mention here that Adivasis are Adivasis, what does government and non-government mean? Probably the Kudmi tribals, who have not been included in the official list, have been called as non-governmental tribals in the said report
 kudmi janajatiyon kii sabhyataa, samskruti, parampara, reeti-rivaaj, rahan-sahan, khan-paan, vesh-bhusha, parv-tyohaar, puja-paath, shaadi-vivaah, narta-kaman aadi vaise hi hai, jaise anya janajatiyon ke hai
 The commonality between the Kudmi / Kurmi community and other tribes of Chotanagpur is as follows: 1
) kudmi samudaay or anya janajaatiy samudaayon me sabase badi samanta he unka totemic hona
 Each tribe or tribal community is identified by their totem, which their ancestors had placed on trees, plants, animals or other naturalistic names to classify the society
 udhaaharan ke liye jis prakaar santal main sorain, murmu, tudu aadi totem hote hai, vaise hi kudmi janajati main naguar, kaduaar, hindiar, bansariar, kachuaar, kesariar, banuar, puchhriar, dungriar, ketiar, dumriar aadi 81 mul totem paye jate hai tathaa kuch ke sab-totem milakar lagbhag 120 totem hai
 Each totem has a totem symbol and prohibition, such as - the totem sign of the kachuar totem is a tortoise and they kill or do not eat the tortoise, and when found, apply oil vermilion and leave it back in the water
 usee tarah naguar kaa naag saanp, kaduaar kaa kaada ityadi
 Like other tribes, the relationship in the same totem is forbidden
 2
) anya janajaatiy samudaayon kii maanjhi mahal vyavastha kii tarah kudmi samudaay kii bhi apni alag saamaajik shashan vyavstha hoti he, jise mahato parganait vyavastha kehete hai
 The head of the village is called Mahato and the head of the pargana is called Parganait
 samaaj ke kisi bhi prakaar ke sabhi samasyaon kaa nishpaadan va nibatara parganait ke padaadhikariyon dwaara hi kii jaati he
 3
) The worship method of Kudmi tribes is also similar to other tribes
 ye prakrutipujak apane sabhi puja swayan dwaara hi karte hai tathaa samuhik puja laayaa / paahan / deuri dwaara hi sampann kiya jaataa he
 He worships formless Garam, Dharam, Basmata, Badapahar etc
 as deities and considers Budhababa and Mahamana as adorable as Adipurushu and Adimata
 santal main burbonga yani marangaburu, jise kudmi baipahaad kehete hai, usee prakaar haatubonga jise garaam thakur, singbonga yani dharmesh jise surjaahi yani dharam va sarna thaan ko jaher thaan kaha jaataa he
 The ancestors of the village are remembered at Aradhana of Garam Thakur and Zamarman in Jaherthan and the mother earth is worshiped as Basmata
 4
) prayek janajaatiy samudaayon kii apni kabilavachi bhashaa he, jaise - santal kii santali, munda kii mundaari, ho kii ho, uraanv kii kudukh aadi
 Similarly, the Kudmi community also has its own autonomous Kabilawachi language - Kudmali
 5
) kudmi janajatiyon kii samskruti bhi anya janajatiyon ke samaan he, jo purnataya va vishuddh rup se krishi evam prakruti par hi aadhaarit he, jinhen "baue masek telu parab" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Among these, all are the hallmarks of culture, from Haier Punah to Sijhana / Pathipuja, Sarahul / Phulpuja, Rahin, Masant Parab, Chitu Parab, Gamaha Parab, Karam, Jitia, Jilhud, Bandana / Sohraya and Tusu Thapna and Tusu Bhasan
 sabhi parab kaa ek vishesh kaaran va mahatv hota he evam inke tithi main kabhi koi parivartan yaa pherbadal nahin hota, kyonki ye tithi aadhaarit nahin balki maheene ke dinon kii gananaa ke anusaar hota he, jaise - shukla paksh ke bhadar ekadshi main 'karam' or yahi inke aadimata kaa parichaayak bhi he
 6
 The customs of the Kudmi tribals also follow the specific Adi tradition on the occasion like marriage, which starts from Kaniya dhaka, saw barh, duir khunda, lagan dhara, madua bandha, sajni saja, nakh tunga, mango Biha, Mouha Biha, Amalua Khia, Ghad Dhaua, Sala Dhati, Dubhi Khia, Thubra Biha, Sindandaradan, Chuman, Bidai, Kenia Bhitra, Pitar Pindha to Samadhin Dekha are visible in the Neg
 kudmi adivasee samudaay, jo puure chotanagpur pathaar main do karod se bhi adhik kii jansankhya main he, pichley 50 saalon se bhi adhik samay se ek bhi ucch prashasnic padaadhikari kaa naa hona evam anya kshetron ke ucch padon par naa hona evam aarthik, saamaajik, shaikshanik, rajnatik har str main atyant pichhadaa hona inke 'becowardnes' ko darshata he
 Apart from this, the sacrifices and contributions of the Kudmi community towards the country and the state cannot be forgotten
 magar jameendaari / malgujari pratha va british hukumat ke viruddh huye pratham andolan 'chuhaad vidroh' ke mahanayake amar shahid krantivir raghunatha mahato ko bhula diya gaya va itihaas main kahin koi sthaan nahin diya gaya, jo atyant khedjanak he
 Apart from this, many kudmi heroic martyrs like Buli Mahato and Kanka Mohanta are missing in the pages of freedom movement history
 jharkhand andolan ke purodha binod bihari mahato, krantidoot shaktinath mahato, maseehaa nirmal mahato jaise anekon gyaat agyaat kudmi andolankariyon ke yogadan or shahadat ko uchit sammaan diye jane kii jarurat he
 If seen in this way, the self-respecting but innocent Kudmi tribal community has been a victim of conspiracy since the beginning and in the present situation, it has reached a pathetic position in every area
 upar se sarkari upeksha kaa dansh inhen lagaataar gart main dhakelne kaa kaam kar rahi he
 There is a need for the solution of their upliftment and multifaceted problems like - linguistic, cultural, social, traditional, economic, political, educational, employment and agriculture and to protect the right, only political thinking, prejudice and unilateral ideology
 To abandon the feelings and take appropriate steps for them, which i humbly request all the dignitaries and intellectuals
