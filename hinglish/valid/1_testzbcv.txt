 The name of Green Revolution was also given because, as a result, Indian agriculture had risen above the subsistence level to a higher level
 uplabdhiyaan The Green Revolution resulted in significant progress in the agricultural sector of the country

 As a result of the Green Revolution, there has been a substantial increase in the production and total productivity per hectare against crops like wheat, sugarcane, maize and millet
 harith kranti kii uplabdhiyon ko krishi main takniki evam sansthagat parivartan evam utpaadan main hue sudhaar ke rup main nimnavat dekha ja saktaa he- krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudharracinic urvarkon kaa prayog As a result of the new agricultural policy, the amount of consumption of chemical fertilizers has increased rapidly

92 lakh tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 249
09 lakh tonnes in 2008–2009
 unnatsheel bijon ke prayog main vruddhi The use of high yielding seeds has increased in the country and new varieties of seeds have been discovered
 abhi tak adhik upaj dene vaala kaarykram gehun, dhan, bajra, makka va jowar jaisi fasalon par lagu kiya gaya he, parantu gehun main sabase adhik safalataa praapt hui he

 The total accumulated area in the country in 1951 was 210 lakh hectare, which increased to 673 lakh hectare in 2008-2009

 Presently, eco-friendly worm control program has been implemented under Integrated Agriculture Management
 bahufasali kaarykram The purpose of the multi-crop program is to increase production by growing more than one crop in a year on the same land
 anya shabdon main bhoomi kii urvartaa shakti ko nasht kiye bina, bhoomi ke ek ikai kshetra se adhiktam utpaadan praapt karnaa hi bahufasali kaarykram kehalaata he
 In 1966-1967, multi-cropping program was implemented in 36 lakh hectares of land

 Use of modern agricultural implements nai krishi vikaas vidhi evam harith kranti main aadhunik krishi upkarnon, jaise- tractor, thresar, harvester, bulldozer tathaa dijal evam bijli ke pumpaseton aadi ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Thus, the substitution of manpower and manpower in agriculture has been done by operating power, which has increased the utilization and productivity of the agricultural sector
 krishi seva kendron kii sthapana a plan has been implemented to set up agricultural service centers in the country with the objective of developing the ability of business courage among farmers

 Establishment of various corporations harith kranti kii pragati mukhyatah adhik upaj dene vaali kismon evam uttam sudhare huye bijon par nirbhar karti he
 For this, 400 agricultural farms have been set up in the country
 1963 main rashtriya beej nigam kii sthapana kii gai he
 The National Cooperative Development Corporation was established in 1963, whose main objective is the marketing, processing and storage of agricultural produce

 aaj krishi or isse sambandhit kshetron main ucch shiksha ke liye 4 krishi vishvavidhyalay, 39 rajya krishi vishvavidhyalay or imphal main ek kendriya vishvavidhyalay he
 There is 'indian Council of Agricultural Research' for agricultural research, under which there are 53 Central Institutes, 32 National Research Centers, 12 Projects, 64 All India Coordinated Research Projects
 iske atirikt desh main 527 krishi vigyaan kendra hai, jo shikshan evam prashikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 To maintain the quality of agricultural education and training, computerization and internet facilities of various institutions have been provided
 krishi utpaadan main sudharutpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi The biggest advantage of the Green Revolution or the new development method implemented in Indian agriculture was that the area of crops in the country increased, agricultural production and productivity increased
 visheshkar gehun, bajra, dhan, makka tathaa jowar ke utpaadan main aashaatheet vruddhi hui
 As a result, India became self-sufficient in food grains
 1951-1952 main desh main khadyannon kaa kul utpaadan 5
09 karod ton tha, jo kramshah badhkar 2008-2009 main badhkar 23
38 karod ton ho gaya
 Similarly there has been a substantial improvement in productivity per hectare
 varsh 1950-1951 main khadyannon kaa utpaadan 522 kigra prati hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,893 kigra prati hectares ho gaya
 Yes, there has also been some exaggeration in food grains production in India due to bad weather etc
 which proves that agricultural production in the country still depends on the weather
 krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan As a result of the Green Revolution, the traditional form of farming has changed and farming has started to be done commercially
 jabaki pehle sirf pet bharne ke liye kii jaati thi
 There has been an increase in the production of sugarcane, cotton, jute and oilseeds in the country
 kapaas kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 5
6 million ganth tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 27 million ganth ho gaya
 Similarly, the production of oilseeds was 7 million tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 28
2 million tonnes in 2008–2009
 isi tarah patson, ganna, aalu tathaa moongfalee aadi vyavsaayik fasalon ke utpaadan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 At present, cultivation of horticultural crops, fruits, vegetables and flowers is also being encouraged in the country
 krishi bachaton main vruddhi Production has increased through the use of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, good irrigation and machines
 jisase krishakon ke paas bachaton kii ullekhneey maatra main vruddhi hui he
 Which can be used in the development work of the country
 agragami tathaa pratigaami sambandhon main majbootee New technology and modernization of agriculture have made the relationship between agriculture and industry stronger
 parmparik rup main yadhyapi krishi or udyog kaa agragami sambandh pehle se hi pragadh tha, kyonki krishi kshetra dwaara udyogon ko anek aagat uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 But the regressive relationship between these two was very weak, because the manufactured goods of the industry were rarely used in agriculture
 parantu krishi ke aadhunikaran ke falswaroop ab krishi main udyog nirmit aagton, jaise- krishi yantra evam rasinic urvarak aadi, kii maang main baari vruddhi hui he, jisase krishi kaa pratigaami sambandh bhi sudrudh hua he
 In other words, the relationship between agriculture and industrial sector has become stronger
 is tarah spasht he ki harith kranti ke falswaroop desh main krishi aagton evam utpaadan main paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 As a result, farmers, government and public have become convinced that India can not only become self-sufficient in the field of agricultural produce, but can also export
 vishleshan There has been substantial development in the field of agriculture in the planning period in the country
 kul krishi kshetra badha he, fasal ke swaroop main parivartan hua he, sinchit kshetra badha he, rasinic khaadon ke upyog main vruddhi hui he tathaa aadhunik krishi yantron kaa upyog hone laga he
 Despite all these things, the development of agriculture in the country has not yet reached the proper level, because the agricultural production per hectare is less than other developed countries
 abhi anek krishi utpaadon kaa aayaat karnaa padhata he
 Because their production is less than the demand
 krishi kshetra kaa abhi bhi ek badha bhaag acinchit he
 The level of mechanization in agriculture is still low, leading to higher production costs
 krishakon ko vibhageeya suvidhaayen paryaapt maatra main nahin milti hai, jisase krishi vikaas main baadha utpann hoti he
 Therefore, there is a need for further development of the agricultural sector by implementing technical and institutional reforms in agriculture more effectively
 harith kranti kaa vistaar In the first component of the action plan made for the development of the agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2010-2011, with the active cooperation of Gram Sabhas and farmer families, the expansion of Green Revolution in the eastern region of the country Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa
 a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made for this
 kamiyaan tathaa samasyaayen As a result of the Green Revolution in the country, there has been a substantial increase in the production of some crops, there has been a decrease in the import of food grains, there has been a change in the traditional form of agriculture, yet some shortcomings are reflected in this program
 harith kranti kii pramukh kamiyon evam samansyaon ko nimna rup main pranstut kiya ja saktaa he- Impact - The impact of the Green Revolution was limited to certain crops, such as wheat, jowar, millet
 anya fasalo par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even rice has been affected very little by this
 vyapaarik fasalen bhi isse aprabhavit hi hai
 Promotion of capitalist agriculture - Seeds of more fertile variety are a capital-intensive program, in which large amounts have to be invested on inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural implements etc
 baari nivesh karnaa chote tathaa madhyam shrenee ke kisaanon kii kshamta se baahar hai
 In this way, those farmers who have private pumping sets, tractors, tube wells and other agricultural machines are benefiting from the Green Revolution
 yah suvidha desh ke bade kisaanon ko hi uplabdh he
 Ordinary farmers are deprived of these facilities
 sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa par bal nahin - nai vikaas vidhi main sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa kii sarvatha avhelnaa kii gayi he
 Under institutional changes, the most important component is the system of land holding
 isaki sahaayta se hi takneekee parivartan dwaara adhiktam utpaadan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Land reform programs have not been successful in the country and even today, certainty of landholding has not been provided to millions of farmers
 shram-visthaapan kii samasya - harith kranti ke antargat prayukt krishi yantrikaran ke falswaroop shram-visthaapan ko badhaava mila he
 It is also a reason for the rural population to migrate to cities in search of employment
 aay kii badhati asamanta - krishi main takneekee parivartanon kaa gramin kshetron main aay-vitaran par vipareet prabhaav padaa he

 According to V
 Rao, "it is now well known that inequality in rural income has increased with the so-called Green Revolution, which has helped to increase the production of food grains in the country, many small farmers have to give up their tenancy rights and Social and economic tensions have increased in rural areas
 " Lack of necessary facilities - Due to lack of facilities necessary for the success of Green Revolution, such as irrigation system, agricultural credit, economic holdings and cheap inputs etc
, the desired success in the field of agricultural development is not being achieved
 kshetreey asantulan - harith kranti kaa prabhaav punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra tathaa tamilnadu aadi rajyon tak hi simit he
 Due to its effect not spreading on the whole country, the country could not develop in a balanced manner
 is tarah, harith kranti simit rup se hi safal rahi he
 Tips for the success of Green Revolution sansthagat parivartanon ko protsaahan - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko prabhavi or vistrut rup se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Shareholders should be given the right of ownership
 seemaa nirdhaaran se praapt atirikt bhoomi ko bhoomihin krishakon main vitarit kiya janaa chahie
 The division of holdings should be effectively stopped by making consolidation effective
 krishi vitt kii suvidha - krishi vitt kii suvidhaayen badhaate samay chote kisaanon ko riyayati dar par saakh kii suvidha uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, taaki ve aavashyak unnat beej, rasinic khaad tathaa krishi upkaran kray kar saken
 Increase in employment opportunities - Labor intensive techniques should be adopted and cottage and village industries should be expanded rapidly to solve the problem of unemployment in rural areas
 sinchai ke sadhano kaa vikaas - desh main sinchai kii suvidhaon kaa paryaapt vikaas kiya janaa chahie, taaki krishak adhik upaj dene vaali kismon kaa puraa laabh uthaa saken
 In this context, attention should be paid to the expansion of minor irrigation projects
 anya sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kaa vistaar - krishi ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak bijli, parivahan sahit anya sanrachanaatmak suvidhaon kaa vikaas kiya janaa chahie
 Only then will the Green Revolution spread to other crops and regions
 harith kranti kaa anya fasalon tak failaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki iskaa vistaar chaaval tathaa anya fasalon kii kheti tak kiya jaye
 Production growth in respect of commercial crops like pulses, cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, jute, etc
 has also not been satisfactory with rice
 atah in fasalon ko bhi harith kranti ke prabhaav kshetra main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Connecting small farms and small farmers - Small farms and small farmers should also be associated with green revolution
 iske liye aavashyak he ki- bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko shighrata or prabhavi dhang se lagu kiya janaa chahie, chote-chote kisaanon ko unnat beej, khaad aadi aavashyak chizon ko kareedne ke liye udaar sharton evam daron par saakh suvidhaayen uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, saadhaaran krishi upkarnon kii kareed ke sambandh main di gayi suvidhaon ke atirikt badi-badi farm mashinari yatha-tractor, harvester aadi ko sarkaar kii ore se kiraye par diya janaa chahie, bahut choti-choti joton vaale kisaanon ko sahakaari kheti ko apnaane ke liye prerit kiya janaa chahie
 Integrated Farm Policy - For the success of the Green Revolution, a coordinated farm policy should be adopted, so that a proper policy can be adopted in relation to the value of farm technology and inputs, and farmers should be encouraged to cultivate seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machinery and equipment at a reasonable price
 Be available on time

 Example 2 - If a man is not attracted to her even after being instigated by a beautiful woman, then that man will be an exception among all men
 atah apwaad saamaanya apekshaaon or swabhaavo kaa todane vaali sthiti he
 The exception is determined based on different standards in different subjects

 In this article written at the age of fifteen, he tried to show that in the root of all the languages of the world, there are three basic recipes
 unhone apana adhyayan kaary geneva, paris or lepging main sanskrit or tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke anrtgat purna kiya
 At the same time, he came in contact with the new grammars at the University of Leipzing
 ikkis saal kii aayu main unhone europea bhashaaon kii aadharbhoot vyavastha par lekh likhaa
 In this article, he not only attacked many basic concepts but also raised the issue of systemic analysis in the field of language related research
 inkaa doosraa aadhaar stambh doctoret kii oopaadhi ke liye prastut shodh-prabandh tha
 The topic of his research was "the nature and use of genitive in Sanskrit language"
 doctoret kii oopaadhi ke baad ye germany main or adhik nahin ruke kyonki inhen germany kaa saamaajik or shaikshinik vaataavaran pasand nahin aayaa
 In 1880, the father-in-law left Germany and came to France
 paris main unhone lagbhag das varshon tak aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya
 He later became a member of the Parisian Linguistics Institute
 germany se lautne ke baad ek sakriy sadsy ke rup main navayuvak bhashavid sasyur ne samaaj main ek mahattvpurn sthaan bana liya
 In 1907, he got the opportunity to teach general linguistics at the University of Geneva
 ek varsh ke antaraal par unhone is vishay main san 1907, 1909 evam 1911 main teen baar adhyayan-adhyaapan kaary kiya
 This lecture rosary became the basis of his book, which was edited by his two enlightened colleagues Bailey and Sechahawe in a journal called 'course of Linguistic' in 1913 AD
 sasyur ke nots na ke baraabar thi, na hi sasyur ne apane jivan main kitaab likhi
 In February 1913, the father-in-law died at the young age of 53

 10-12 km from rampuria-ratanpuria villages, there were thousands of valuable teak trees and other animals and there was also a large number of predatory animals
 koi asaadhaaran birla hi yahan tak panhuchane kii himmat juta saktaa tha
 In the early 16th century under the Sultan of Malwa, Nasir Shah Khilji, there was the authority to parlay 'arnod', an old settlement town near present-day Pratapgarh, 18 km - Khan Alam Maqbool Khan
 yahan tak ghode kii peeth par baith kar aata rahaa vah koi bahut ekantapremi or kalpanasheel vyakti rahaa hoga

 For the protection of the fort, strong walls of black stones were built here, which are still present
 durg ke pashchim main koi 150 feet gahari khai he
 In the year 1505 AD, the same Khan Alam Maqbool Khan, having introduced sarvadharma-sambhav and 'religious-tolerance', carved a command on the stone inscription and established it near the gate of 'gautamnath Temple', this kingdom can be seen even today
 It is - “no person should commit any kind of violence or murder in the area of the temple


 every Hindu is cow and every Muslim has a boar
 

”
 It has been said that Khan Alam Maqbool Khan's immense treasure is hidden in this fort or some secret place in its premises
 deshi riyasaton kii samaapti ke baad se hi janagarh viraan ho gaya tha, tab se raat ke andhere main maal-matte ke laalchee oont, ghode, jeep or motor cykilon aadi se log is durgam sthaan par aate rahe
 And in the greed of the so-called treasury, they were rushing through the fort

 It is very difficult to reach Jeep here

 Whether or not the treasure of that Muslim ruler of Arnod is here or not, no one knows, but even today, with jeopardized lives, the stolen people jeep in the blind greed to get the vast wealth of treasure with the so-called mantriks, priests and tantrikas
 Adi come here by vehicles, for the good luck they worship some stones from vermilion, then speculate and dig around like crazy in search of buried wealth
 Te live
 kai siraphire to khajaane ke liye yaheen begunaah bejubaan pashuon kii bali tak chadhaate aae hai
 Kalika Mata is located on the fort, originally Vikramaditya built this fort, but then "through some 'bhope', Mata ordered that no temple of hers be built", under the pavilion of the sky We are more happy that is why from the day of its establishment till date, Mata Kalika is not here in the temple but is sitting on the open platform
 senkadon dhwajaaen, jo mata ke sammaan main bhaktagan lagaate aa rahe
 Yes, it is planted here every year
 


 par kile ke saath khajaane kii afvaah kuch is kadar gahare judy he ki mata kalika khud ek tarah se bebas hai
 

 And the condition is that the famous historical fort located in Janagarh of Pratapgarh district has been destroyed by the greed of gold and silver due to the treasure of the Sultans of Malwa

 haalat yah ho gai he ki aaj is kile ke avshesh hi bache hai, bas neeche ke gaavon ke bahut se charvaahe kile par apane maveshi charaane le jate hai
 The story does not end here, even the remnants left in the storms of finding the treasure of the land are still being destroyed corruptly

 bharat main harith kranti kii shuruyaat san 1966-67 se hui
 The credit for starting the Green Revolution goes to Nobel Laureate Professor Narman Borlaug
 harith kranti se abhipraay desh ke sinchit evam acinchit krishi kshetron main adhik upaj dene vaale sankar tathaa boune bijon ke upyog se fasal utpaadan main vruddhi karnaa hai
 The Green Revolution is the result of the development method implemented in Indian agriculture, which emerged in the 1960s as traditional agriculture was replaced by modern technology
 kyonki krishi kshetra main yah takniki ekaek ai, teji se iskaa vikaas hua or thode hi samay main isse itane ascharyajanak parinaam nikle ki desh ke yojanakaaron, krishi visheshgyon tathaa raajnneetigyon ne is apratyaashit pragati ko hi 'harith kranti' kii sangya pradaan kar di
 The name of Green Revolution was also given because, as a result, Indian agriculture had risen above the subsistence level to a higher level
 uplabdhiyaan The Green Revolution resulted in significant progress in the agricultural sector of the country
 krishi aagton main hue gunatmak sudhaar ke falswaroop desh main krishi utpaadan badha he
 Self-sufficiency has come in food grains
 vyavsaayik krishi ko badhaava mila he
 The attitude of farmers has changed
 krishi aadhiky main vruddhi hui he
 As a result of the Green Revolution, there has been a substantial increase in the production and total productivity per hectare against crops like wheat, sugarcane, maize and millet
 harith kranti kii uplabdhiyon ko krishi main takniki evam sansthagat parivartan evam utpaadan main hue sudhaar ke rup main nimnavat dekha ja saktaa he- krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudharracinic urvarkon kaa prayog As a result of the new agricultural policy, the amount of consumption of chemical fertilizers has increased rapidly

6 kigra prati hectares ho gaya he
 Similarly, the total consumption of chemical fertilizers in the country was 2
92 lakh tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 249
09 lakh tonnes in 2008–2009
 unnatsheel bijon ke prayog main vruddhi The use of high yielding seeds has increased in the country and new varieties of seeds have been discovered
 abhi tak adhik upaj dene vaala kaarykram gehun, dhan, bajra, makka va jowar jaisi fasalon par lagu kiya gaya he, parantu gehun main sabase adhik safalataa praapt hui he
 In the year 2008-2009, 1,00,000 quintal breeder seeds and 9
69 lakh quintal base seeds were produced and 190 lakh certified seeds were distributed
 sinchai suvidhaon kaa vikaas Under the new development method, irrigation facilities have been expanded rapidly in the country
 1951 main desh main kul sinchai kshamta 223 lakh hectares thi, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,073 lakh hectares ho gai
 The total accumulated area in the country in 1951 was 210 lakh hectare, which increased to 673 lakh hectare in 2008-2009
 paudh sangrakshan Under the new agricultural development method, attention is also being paid to plant protection
 iske antargat kharpatvaar evam kiton kaa naash karne ke liye dawa chhidakane kaa kaary kiya jaataa he tathaa tiddi dal par niyantran karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 Presently, eco-friendly worm control program has been implemented under Integrated Agriculture Management
 bahufasali kaarykram The purpose of the multi-crop program is to increase production by growing more than one crop in a year on the same land
 anya shabdon main bhoomi kii urvartaa shakti ko nasht kiye bina, bhoomi ke ek ikai kshetra se adhiktam utpaadan praapt karnaa hi bahufasali kaarykram kehalaata he
 In 1966-1967, multi-cropping program was implemented in 36 lakh hectares of land
 vartmaan samay main bharat kii kul sanchit bhoomi ke 71 pratishat bhaag par yah kaarykram lagu he
 Use of modern agricultural implements nai krishi vikaas vidhi evam harith kranti main aadhunik krishi upkarnon, jaise- tractor, thresar, harvester, bulldozer tathaa dijal evam bijli ke pumpaseton aadi ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Thus, the substitution of manpower and manpower in agriculture has been done by operating power, which has increased the utilization and productivity of the agricultural sector
 krishi seva kendron kii sthapana a plan has been implemented to set up agricultural service centers in the country with the objective of developing the ability of business courage among farmers
 is yojana main pehle vyaktiyon ko takniki prashikshan diya jaataa he, phir inase seva centre sthapit karne ko kaha jaataa he
 For this, they are provided assistance from nationalized banks
 ab tak desh main kul 1,314 krishi seva kendra sthapit kiye ja chuke hai
 Agricultural Industries Corporation sarkari niti ke antargat 17 rajyon main krishi udyog nigamon kii sthapana kii gai he
 The task of these corporations is to promote the supply of agricultural equipment and machinery and the processing and storage of produce
 iske liye yah nigam kiraaya kray paddati ke aadhaar par tractor, pumpaset evam anya mashinari ko vitarit karata he
 Establishment of various corporations harith kranti kii pragati mukhyatah adhik upaj dene vaali kismon evam uttam sudhare huye bijon par nirbhar karti he
 For this, 400 agricultural farms have been set up in the country
 1963 main rashtriya beej nigam kii sthapana kii gai he
 The National Cooperative Development Corporation was established in 1963, whose main objective is the marketing, processing and storage of agricultural produce
 vishwa bank kii sahaayta se rashtriya beej pariyojna bhi prarambh kii gai, jiske antargat kai beej nigam banaaye gayi hai

 There is 'indian Council of Agricultural Research' for agricultural research, under which there are 53 Central Institutes, 32 National Research Centers, 12 Projects, 64 All India Coordinated Research Projects
 iske atirikt desh main 527 krishi vigyaan kendra hai, jo shikshan evam prashikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 To maintain the quality of agricultural education and training, computerization and internet facilities of various institutions have been provided
 krishi utpaadan main sudharutpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi The biggest advantage of the Green Revolution or the new development method implemented in Indian agriculture was that the area of crops in the country increased, agricultural production and productivity increased
 visheshkar gehun, bajra, dhan, makka tathaa jowar ke utpaadan main aashaatheet vruddhi hui
 As a result, India became self-sufficient in food grains
 1951-1952 main desh main khadyannon kaa kul utpaadan 5
09 karod ton tha, jo kramshah badhkar 2008-2009 main badhkar 23
38 karod ton ho gaya
 Similarly there has been a substantial improvement in productivity per hectare
 varsh 1950-1951 main khadyannon kaa utpaadan 522 kigra prati hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,893 kigra prati hectares ho gaya
 Yes, there has also been some exaggeration in food grains production in India due to bad weather etc
 which proves that agricultural production in the country still depends on the weather
 krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan As a result of the Green Revolution, the traditional form of farming has changed and farming has started to be done commercially
 jabaki pehle sirf pet bharne ke liye kii jaati thi
 There has been an increase in the production of sugarcane, cotton, jute and oilseeds in the country
 kapaas kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 5
6 million ganth tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 27 million ganth ho gaya
 Similarly, the production of oilseeds was 7 million tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 28
2 million tonnes in 2008–2009
 isi tarah patson, ganna, aalu tathaa moongfalee aadi vyavsaayik fasalon ke utpaadan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 At present, cultivation of horticultural crops, fruits, vegetables and flowers is also being encouraged in the country
 krishi bachaton main vruddhi Production has increased through the use of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, good irrigation and machines
 jisase krishakon ke paas bachaton kii ullekhneey maatra main vruddhi hui he
 Which can be used in the development work of the country
 agragami tathaa pratigaami sambandhon main majbootee New technology and modernization of agriculture have made the relationship between agriculture and industry stronger
 parmparik rup main yadhyapi krishi or udyog kaa agragami sambandh pehle se hi pragadh tha, kyonki krishi kshetra dwaara udyogon ko anek aagat uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 But the regressive relationship between these two was very weak, because the manufactured goods of the industry were rarely used in agriculture
 parantu krishi ke aadhunikaran ke falswaroop ab krishi main udyog nirmit aagton, jaise- krishi yantra evam rasinic urvarak aadi, kii maang main baari vruddhi hui he, jisase krishi kaa pratigaami sambandh bhi sudrudh hua he
 In other words, the relationship between agriculture and industrial sector has become stronger
 is tarah spasht he ki harith kranti ke falswaroop desh main krishi aagton evam utpaadan main paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 As a result, farmers, government and public have become convinced that India can not only become self-sufficient in the field of agricultural produce, but can also export
 vishleshan There has been substantial development in the field of agriculture in the planning period in the country
 kul krishi kshetra badha he, fasal ke swaroop main parivartan hua he, sinchit kshetra badha he, rasinic khaadon ke upyog main vruddhi hui he tathaa aadhunik krishi yantron kaa upyog hone laga he
 Despite all these things, the development of agriculture in the country has not yet reached the proper level, because the agricultural production per hectare is less than other developed countries
 abhi anek krishi utpaadon kaa aayaat karnaa padhata he
 Because their production is less than the demand
 krishi kshetra kaa abhi bhi ek badha bhaag acinchit he
 The level of mechanization in agriculture is still low, leading to higher production costs
 krishakon ko vibhageeya suvidhaayen paryaapt maatra main nahin milti hai, jisase krishi vikaas main baadha utpann hoti he
 Therefore, there is a need for further development of the agricultural sector by implementing technical and institutional reforms in agriculture more effectively
 harith kranti kaa vistaar In the first component of the action plan made for the development of the agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2010-2011, with the active cooperation of Gram Sabhas and farmer families, the expansion of Green Revolution in the eastern region of the country Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa
 a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made for this
 kamiyaan tathaa samasyaayen As a result of the Green Revolution in the country, there has been a substantial increase in the production of some crops, there has been a decrease in the import of food grains, there has been a change in the traditional form of agriculture, yet some shortcomings are reflected in this program
 harith kranti kii pramukh kamiyon evam samansyaon ko nimna rup main pranstut kiya ja saktaa he- Impact - The impact of the Green Revolution was limited to certain crops, such as wheat, jowar, millet
 anya fasalo par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even rice has been affected very little by this
 vyapaarik fasalen bhi isse aprabhavit hi hai
 Promotion of capitalist agriculture - Seeds of more fertile variety are a capital-intensive program, in which large amounts have to be invested on inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural implements etc
 baari nivesh karnaa chote tathaa madhyam shrenee ke kisaanon kii kshamta se baahar hai
 In this way, those farmers who have private pumping sets, tractors, tube wells and other agricultural machines are benefiting from the Green Revolution
 yah suvidha desh ke bade kisaanon ko hi uplabdh he
 Ordinary farmers are deprived of these facilities
 sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa par bal nahin - nai vikaas vidhi main sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa kii sarvatha avhelnaa kii gayi he
 Under institutional changes, the most important component is the system of land holding
 isaki sahaayta se hi takneekee parivartan dwaara adhiktam utpaadan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Land reform programs have not been successful in the country and even today, certainty of landholding has not been provided to millions of farmers
 shram-visthaapan kii samasya - harith kranti ke antargat prayukt krishi yantrikaran ke falswaroop shram-visthaapan ko badhaava mila he
 It is also a reason for the rural population to migrate to cities in search of employment
 aay kii badhati asamanta - krishi main takneekee parivartanon kaa gramin kshetron main aay-vitaran par vipareet prabhaav padaa he

 According to V
 Rao, "it is now well known that inequality in rural income has increased with the so-called Green Revolution, which has helped to increase the production of food grains in the country, many small farmers have to give up their tenancy rights and Social and economic tensions have increased in rural areas
 " Lack of necessary facilities - Due to lack of facilities necessary for the success of Green Revolution, such as irrigation system, agricultural credit, economic holdings and cheap inputs etc
, the desired success in the field of agricultural development is not being achieved
 kshetreey asantulan - harith kranti kaa prabhaav punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra tathaa tamilnadu aadi rajyon tak hi simit he
 Due to its effect not spreading on the whole country, the country could not develop in a balanced manner
 is tarah, harith kranti simit rup se hi safal rahi he
 Tips for the success of Green Revolution sansthagat parivartanon ko protsaahan - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko prabhavi or vistrut rup se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Shareholders should be given the right of ownership
 seemaa nirdhaaran se praapt atirikt bhoomi ko bhoomihin krishakon main vitarit kiya janaa chahie
 The division of holdings should be effectively stopped by making consolidation effective
 krishi vitt kii suvidha - krishi vitt kii suvidhaayen badhaate samay chote kisaanon ko riyayati dar par saakh kii suvidha uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, taaki ve aavashyak unnat beej, rasinic khaad tathaa krishi upkaran kray kar saken
 Increase in employment opportunities - Labor intensive techniques should be adopted and cottage and village industries should be expanded rapidly to solve the problem of unemployment in rural areas
 sinchai ke sadhano kaa vikaas - desh main sinchai kii suvidhaon kaa paryaapt vikaas kiya janaa chahie, taaki krishak adhik upaj dene vaali kismon kaa puraa laabh uthaa saken
 In this context, attention should be paid to the expansion of minor irrigation projects
 anya sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kaa vistaar - krishi ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak bijli, parivahan sahit anya sanrachanaatmak suvidhaon kaa vikaas kiya janaa chahie
 Only then will the Green Revolution spread to other crops and regions
 harith kranti kaa anya fasalon tak failaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki iskaa vistaar chaaval tathaa anya fasalon kii kheti tak kiya jaye
 Production growth in respect of commercial crops like pulses, cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, jute, etc
 has also not been satisfactory with rice
 atah in fasalon ko bhi harith kranti ke prabhaav kshetra main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Connecting small farms and small farmers - Small farms and small farmers should also be associated with green revolution
 iske liye aavashyak he ki- bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko shighrata or prabhavi dhang se lagu kiya janaa chahie, chote-chote kisaanon ko unnat beej, khaad aadi aavashyak chizon ko kareedne ke liye udaar sharton evam daron par saakh suvidhaayen uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, saadhaaran krishi upkarnon kii kareed ke sambandh main di gayi suvidhaon ke atirikt badi-badi farm mashinari yatha-tractor, harvester aadi ko sarkaar kii ore se kiraye par diya janaa chahie, bahut choti-choti joton vaale kisaanon ko sahakaari kheti ko apnaane ke liye prerit kiya janaa chahie
 Integrated Farm Policy - For the success of the Green Revolution, a coordinated farm policy should be adopted, so that a proper policy can be adopted in relation to the value of farm technology and inputs, and farmers should be encouraged to cultivate seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machinery and equipment at a reasonable price
 Be available on time
