 Sasti = Soasti sah avadat = sowdat Before Visarga, there is 'A' and after that the soft consonant comes, then those forms and Visarga together become 'O'

 Therefore, to get any thing or idea right, it is necessary to test its practical results

 In the present era, this ideology is the most recognized among the various ideologies of philosophy and education
 yatharthwaad hi ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav-mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha
 Realism, rather than a name of a well-formed philosophical ideology, represents all ideas that believe that the object exists independently
 adarshavaadi yah maanata he ki ‘vastu’ kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he
 If this idea is correct then the object has no position
 iske thik vipareet yathartwaadee maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he chaahe vah hamaare vichaaron main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and its related knowledge are separate entities
 sansar main anek aisi vastuein hai jinke sambandh main hamen jaankaree nahin he parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve astitv main he hi nahin
 This is to say that the object has an independent position
 hamaara gyaan hamako uski sthiti se avgat karaata he parantu uske bare main hamaara gyaan na hone se uskaa astitv nasht nahin ho jaataa
 In the same way, realistic about the means of acquiring knowledge, scientific method like Purposeism considers only the best method and takes shelter of incorporation method

 Certain proponents of this theory relate it to the Greek thinker Protagoras's "man is the measure of all things" - and also to the ancient philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, as users of the Pregomatic method; But in reality it is a modern ideology and its principal proponents are the famous psychologist of America, William James, educationist John Dewey and Dr

 Almost all of James's works are based on this ideology

 It would not be inappropriate to call him an ideological representative of the usable and outlandish American people

 To Peers, as he himself has stated, both the term "pragmatism" and its expressions of consequentialism were met with the works of the famous philosopher Kant of Germany
 parantu is vichaardhaara kii pracheenta pradarshit karte hue bhi james ne apane ko vishesh rup se peers kaa hi abhaari mana he or unhen darshanajagat main aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawad kaa pravartak kahkar sammanit kiya he
 In any case, James himself is the most notable name in giving this theory strength and fame
 unke likhe hue "manovigyaan ke siddhant", "dharmik anubhav ke vividh rup", "falanumeyapramanyawad", "satya kaa arth" or "nanaatmak vishwa" aadi sabhi prakhyat granth is vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 Not only his logical thoughts, but psychological and elemental - all kinds of ideas are clear symbols of the consequentialist tendency
 james ke anusaar "satya un sab baton kaa naam he jo vishwaas ke maarg main, tathaa nishchit nirdishtavy hetuon se bhi, apane aapako shreshth siddh karti hai"
 In short, "truth is only a worthy or appropriate tool of the thought process, just as" auspicious "is only a successful instrument of our practical life; it is somehow beneficial and, in fact, ultimately and all things Keeping in mind is beneficial

 According to them, we create our own truths
 ve bahya vastuon kii pratikriya maatr nahin; kintu hamaare prayojanon ke sadhak hamaare hi vishwaas hote hai
 We tend to believe those beliefs that give us emotional fulfillment or practical success to be true, and vice versa as false
 at: hamaare vishwaason yaa vichaaron kaa satyatv unke fal yaa parinaam dwaara anumey hota he
 It takes time and experience to establish
 jaise jaise hamen kisi vishwaas se vyavhaar main safalataa milti jaati he vaise hi vaise uskaa satyatv bhi badhata jaataa he
 None of our beliefs, as evidenced by our limited experience, has the right to be called absolutely true, even the so-called natural laws of science cannot be called absolutely true
 hamen adhik se adhik yahi kehane kaa adhikaar he ki jahaan tak hamaare ab tak ke anubhavon kaa sabandh he, ve satya siddh hue hai; parantu isse unki shaashvat satyata pramanit nahin hoti
 a complete experience, which is never possible, is expected for complete truth
 at: maanav dwaara pratipaadit koi bhi satya, chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe taarkik, purna satya nahin ho saktaa
 Those who often perceive the siddha-satya or principle, are considered to be only a sub-concept of the result
 ve buddhivaadee tarkshastra kii kadi aalochana karte hai or unke nyayavakya aadi siddhanton ko dooshit tehraate hai
 They always consider human ideas to be ideological, not selfless, against the beliefs of rational rationalists

 But, at the same time, the staunch objectivist jurist saying "tadvati tatrakarak jnanam realam" and tadabhavati tatakarak jnanam illusion: "james" seems to be bitterly criticized by Western Western philanthropists
 jis prakaar satyasty vivechan main, usee prakaar maansik prakriyaaon yaa vichaaron kii vyakhya main bhi falanumeyapramanyawaadee hamaari prayojnatmak kriyaaon ko hi pramukh sthaan pradaan karte hai
 According to him, we produce not only our truths but also diverse experiences

 Thus, in his psychology and Locke's atomistic psychology, according to which our ideas are considered to be a mechanically stored sequence of initial simple suffixes, there is a fundamental difference
 falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon kii drushti main parmanuwaadi manovigyaan isi naam ke bhautik vigyaan kii nakal he jo vaastaviktaa se dur evam bhraamak he

 According to this, we always keep creating reality to a large extent and in the true sense, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality is concerned, it is decided that its form of creation depends, in a very important part, on our knowledge and on our knowledge on which our motives and interests are imprinted
 hamaare tathy ve hi hote hai jinamein unki nirmaapika main hamaari ichchhaaon ko trupt karne kii shakti yaa yogyata hoti he
 Just as truths are our successful beliefs, facts are the material that give satisfaction to our desires

 Indian Buddhist philosophy's definition of satta, according to which "satya is that which has the potential to produce an action", seems to be compatible with the consequentialist ideology, because it also contains the functions of the objects in determining their existence, existence, existence
 The fruit itself is considered to be decisive

 Purposeism, being a humanist philosophy, does not consider the world and its objects and actions as seriously as it does considering its usefulness in human life

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 farj farsi mul kaa ek shabd he jise urdu or hindi main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It means - one's duty farj teen hindi filmon kaa sheershak bhi he: Bhavabhuti was a great Sanskrit poet and best playwright
 unke naatak, kalidas ke naatakon ke samatuly maane jate hai
 Bhavabhuti has written in relation to Mahaviracharita in his preface
 ye vidarbha desh ke 'padmapur' naamak sthaan ke nivasee shri bhattagopal ke putr the
 His father's name was Neelkanth and mother's name was Jatukarni
 inhone apana ullekh 'bhattashreekanth pachhalaanchhani bhawabhootirnam' se kiya he
 His guru's name was 'gyananidhi'
 maltimadhav kii puraatan prati main praapt 'bhatta shri kumaril shishyen virachit mind prakarnam' tathaa 'bhatta shri kumaril prasadatprapt vagvabhavasy umbekacharyasyeyan kriti' is ullekh se gyaat hota he ki shrikanth ke guru kumaril the jinka 'gyananidhi' bhi naam tha or bhawabhooti hi mimasak umbekacharya the jinka ullekh darshan granthon main praapt hota he or inhone kumaril ke shlokavarthik kii tikaa bhi kii thi
 He is unique in Sanskrit literature as a great philosopher and playwright
 paanditya or vidagdhta kaa yah anupam yoga sanskrit sahitya main durlabh he
 It is known from Sankaradigvijay that Umbake, Mandan Sureshwar, was the name of the same person
 bhawabhooti kaa ek naam 'umbek' praapt hota he at: naatakkaar bhawabhooti, mimasak umbek or advaitamat main dikshit sureshwarachaarya ek hi hai, aisa kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he
 With the mention of Rajatarangini, his time is a bit certain
 ye kanyakubj ke naresh yashovarman ke sabhapandit the, jinhen lalitaditya ne parajeet kiya tha
 The creator of 'godavho' was also in the same court, so his time proves to be the first half of the eighth century
 bhawabhooti, padmapur main ek deshsth brahman parivaar main paidaa hue the
 Padmapur is located in the Gondia district of Maharashtra on the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 apane bare main sanskrit kaviyon kaa maun ek parampara ban chukaa he, par bhawabhooti ne is paramparaagat maun ko todaa he or apane teenon naatakon kii prastaavna main apana parichay prastut kiya he
 This mention of 'mahaviracharit' ’shrikanth padalaanchhanh bhavabhartinam’ is ullekh se yah prakat hota he ki shrikanth kavi kii oopaadhi thi or bhawabhooti naam tha
 But some commentators believe that the poet's name was Neelkanth and the title Bhavabhuti, which he received in praise of the creation of certain special positions
 is paksh kii pushti main ‘mahaviracharit’ evam ‘uttarramcharita’ ke tikaakar vir raghav1 ne is vaakya kii vyakhya is prakaar prastut kii he— According to this interpretation, 'srikanth' was the name of Bhavabhuti, because the word 'lanchan' is a sign of the name
 ‘sambha punatu bhawabhootipavitramurtih’—shiv kii bhasma se pavitra nigrahavali mata parvati tumhen pavitra karen—is shloke kii rachana se prasann hokar raja ne unhen ‘bhawabhooti’ padavi se sammanit kiya
 In the commentary of Jagadhar ‘malti Madhav’, ‘namna Srikanth:; Famousaya Bhavabhutiratyartha 'and Tripurari have also given the same opinion in the commentary of this drama by saying' Bhavabhhitarit Vyahare Tasayedam Naamantram 'that Srikanth was the name and Bhavabhuti was the name of fame and behavior
 ‘uttarramcharita’ ke tikaakar ghanashyam ke shabd ‘bhavath shiva bhutih bhasma samapd yasya ishwarenaev jati dwijaroopen vibhutirdatta’—ki swayan bhav ne kavi ko apni ‘bhuti’ pradaan kii, atah use ‘bhawabhooti’ pukaara gaya, - isi mat kii pushti karte hai
 Three plays composed by Bhavabhuti are received - jisamen ramavivaah se lekar rajbhishek tak kii katha nibaddh kii gai he
 The poet has made many fictional changes in the narrative, which has brought interestingness to the well-known Ramakatha
 yah viraraspradhan naatak he
 In Sanskrit literature, this play is the best in the poignant expression of Karun Rasa
 isamen saat ankon main ram ke uttar jivan ko, jo abhishek ke baad aarambh hota he, chitrit kiya gaya he jisamen sitanirvaasan kii katha mukhya he
 The difference is that in the Ramayana where the life of this story is mournful, this drama is ended by a pleasant union of Ram Sita
 yah 10 ankon kaa prakaran he jisamen malti or madhav kii kalpanaaprasut premakatha he
 There is an excellent description of the hysterical love of youth
 isamen sthaan sthaan par prakruti kaa vishesh varnanchitr praapt hota he
 His uniqueness in the use of language and style is unique
 saral or clisht, samasankul gadhbandh or samasarhit donon prakaar kii shaileyon kaa inhone utkrisht prayog kiya he-kahin madhur padaavalee or kahin vikat gadhbandh
 At the same time, their language is suited to the occasion and person
 unki style main vaacharth kii pradhanta he kintu vyarth kaa vagadambar nahin
 The poet's attention is more towards the abject and fierce forms of nature
 saath hi arth ke anuroop dhwani utpann karne main kavi kaa napunya pade-pade vyanjit hota he
 It is a play only for the poet's idol and expression of erudition
 inhone kaha he - 'eko ras: karun ev' 
 In this drama, by taking the form of many juices, Karun Ras leaves his influence on the hearts of the gentlemen
 apane naatak main prem ke jis ucch or adarsh rup kii kavi ne pratishtha kii he vah avasthaa ke saath dhalataa nahin or bhi purna tathaa udaatt rup praapt karata he
 Probably this is the reason why the poet has not paid special attention to the description of the external beauty of the woman and has revealed her inner beauty
 prem kii is pavitrataa ke saath vishwaas kii mahima, hriday kii mahatta, bhashaa k gambhirtha or bhaavon ke tarangayit kridavilas main yah naatak sahitya main 'eko ras: karun ev' ke samaan ek hi he
 The rich knowledge of the scriptures, the maturity of language, the dignity of sentiment and the subtlety of oversight in the plays of erudition and generosity of talent and genius take the place of gusto and sublime
 sambhavat: in kaarnon se us samay kavi kii rachanaayen adhik lokapriy na ho sakin or unke naatakon kaa us samay kisi rajsabha main abhinay na ho sakaa
 His plays were performed in front of the people gathered on the occasion of Mahakala Yatra in Ujjayini and later he passed into the kingdom of Yashovarma

 Conversely, due to market forces under an intercept exchange rate, a depreciation is lower in value of a currency than under government or central bank policy actions
