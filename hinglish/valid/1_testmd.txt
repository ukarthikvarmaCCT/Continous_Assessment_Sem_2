 In other words, the ability to recognize one's own and others' emotions, discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, the use of emotional information to guide thinking and behavior is called emotional intelligence
 apni bhaawanaaon, sanvegon ko samajhnaa unka uchit tarah se prabandhan karnaa hi bhaavnaatmak samaj he
 a person can communicate more well with the person in front using their 'emotional understanding' and get better results
 danniel golman kii pustak 'bhavnatmak buddhi' ne is shabd ko ko saare vishwa main prachlit kar diya
 Earlier, intelligence was considered to be everything
 ab yah mana jane laga he ki a person with good intelligence can achieve good success, but to reach the top, it is also necessary to have emotional understanding
 acchhee bhaavnaatmak samaj rakhane vaala vyakti kabhi bhi krodh or khushi ke atirek main aa kar anuchit kadam nahi uthaata he
 Emotional Buddha has three patterns
 kshamta namoona peter salvoy or jon meyar dwaara saanchlit he jo bhaavnaatmak prakriya kii jaankaree or saamaajik vaataavaran nevigate karne ke liye iskaa istemaal karne ke liye vyakti kii kshamta par kendrit he
 The model developed by Constantin Vasili Petrides includes behavioral disposition and self-perceived competence and is measured through self-description
 aakhri namoona ek kshamta or visheshta kaa mishran he
 This model, developed by Daniel Goleman, defines the emotional Buddha as an array of skills and attributes that serve as a pathway to leadership leadership
 adhyayan ucch bhaavnaatmak buddha ke saath logon ko adhik se adhik maansik swasthya, anukaraniya kaam ke pradarshan, or adhik shaktishaalee netritv kaushal he ki pataa chalaa he
 For example, Goleman's research in his book, Working with the Emotional Buddha, suggests that the emotional multiplier is sixty-seven percent responsible for outstanding performance in leaders and counts twice as much as technical expertise or intelligence
 bhaavnaatmak buddha kii ankit karanevaale or ise viksit karne ke tareekon ko or adhik vyapak rup se pratishthit pichley kuch dashakon main ban gaye hai
 In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the nervous system of emotional intelligence
 
 Criticisms based on the Emotional Buddha ask whether the Emotional Buddha is the real intellect and whether its incremental validity exceeds the intellectual quotient and the five major personality traits

 Goleman came out with publications on the same subject after this book, which further strengthened this sentence

 Emotional Buddha has received critical acclaim for his role in leadership and business success

 Pasteurization is a process in which a food item is cooled immediately after heating for a specified time at a specific temperature, which inactivates the microorganisms present in it
 This makes it possible to preserve it for a long time
 The credit for inventing this process goes to the French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, after whom it got its name pasteurization
 The process was first tested in the year 1862
 | It was originally invented to prevent alcohol and beer such as alcohol from spoiling quickly
 Later, it was also used in the preservation of milk
 The idea of pasteurizing milk first came to mind in the year 1886 by German agricultural chemist Franz van Soxhlet

 As a result of the victory in the sino-japanese War of 1894-95 AD, Japan's interest in China increased greatly
 udhar china kii nirbalata kaa pradarshan hua, jisane pashchimi deshon ko china kii lut-khasot kii ore prerit kiya
 The most pioneering in this work was Russia, which was bent on rapidly spreading to China on one pretext
 rus kii is lolupata se japan ko badi ashanka hui
 Convinced of the power and prestige of his new friend Britain in such a situation, he challenged Russia
 rus-japan yuddh isi chunauti kaa parinaam tha
 There was intense tension between Russia and Japan to dominate many regions
 isamen manchuriya or korea ko lekar donon main ghor matbhed utpann ho gaya tha or inhi samasyaon ke kaaran donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa
 The problem of Manchuria first led to a feeling of hatred against each other in Russia and Japan, which ultimately resulted in war
 china kaa uttari pradesh 'manchuriya' kehalaata he
 This region is very rich in terms of economic resources
 koyala, loha or sona yahan prachur maatra main milte hai
 There was a natural conflict between Russia and Japan to establish dominance over such a region
 rus is pradesh ko apane prabhavakshetra main laana chahta tha or iske liye uske paas kai tarah kii yojanaayen thim
 After 1894 AD, Russia took the side of China and forced Japan to take away Japanese authority from Liaotung region by influencing Japan
 kuch samay baad rus or china main ek sandhi huin iske anusaar rus ko manchuriya main bladivostoke tak ek hajaar mile lambii rail-line bichaane kaa adhikaar praapt hua
 Port Arthur and its adjoining territory was leased to Russia for twenty-five years, and here the Russian government began fortifications to secure its warships
 port arthur prashanth mahaasaagar main rus kaa sabase bada sainik adda ban chukaa tha, is kaaran is kshetra main rus kii shakti bahut drudh ho gai thi
 Two companies were formed for the construction of the railway line at Manchuria, which was controlled by Russia
 in companiyon ke vittiya prabandh hetu ek bank kii sthapana kii gai thi, us par bhi rus kaa hi niyantran tha
 Many Russians were coming to Manchuria to build rail lines
 in linon kii raksha ke liye rus kii ek vishaal sena bhi is pradesh main rahane lagi thi
 Japan was becoming increasingly concerned by the increasing influence of Russia in Manchuria
 vah nahin chahta tha ki is kshetra par rus kaa niyantran sthapit ho jaae
 Japan itself wanted to assert its authority over Manchuria
 japani samrajya ke vistaar ke liye yah bada hi upyukt sthaan tha
 After the sino-japanese War, this selfishness was hidden behind Japan's authority over Liaotung region
 lekin, rus ke virodh ke kaaran japan ko shimonoseki kii sandhi main sanshodhan sweekaar kar is kshetra par se apana aadhipaty uthaanaa padaa tha
 Hence, a war between Russia and Japan over the establishment of dominion over Manchuria seemed inevitable
 rus or japan ke sangharsh kaa doosraa kshetra korea tha
 After the sino-japanese War, Japan's dominance over Korea was established
 lekin, rus ke hastkshep se japan kii prabhutaa bahut had tak simit ho gai
 Nevertheless, Japan continued its efforts and was trying to maintain full control over Korea
 korea kaa raja japaniyon ke in prayaason kaa virodh kar rahaa tha
 In such a situation the Japanese soldiers attacked the palace but, the king escaped and was saved by the Russian army
 is par japan rus se bada naaraaz hua
 In 1902-03, Russia intensified its operations in Korea
 usne yaaluu ke muhane par ek korian bandargah par kabja kar liya, uttari korea ke bandargahon se manchuriya ke sainik addon tak sadaken bana leen tathaa taar kii line daal leen or siol se yahuu tak rail kii patari bichaane kaa theka lene kii koshish kii
 Japan opposed this and proposed a second treaty to Russia in July 1903, according to which China and Korea demanded assurances of territorial integrity and Russia promised to follow the policy of free door
 saath hi, vah bhi prastaav kiya gaya ki ukt sandhi dwaara manchuriya main rus ke hit tathaa korea main japan ke vishesh swaarthon kii raksha kii jaae
 However, Russia refused to accept them
 yah baatcheet janvari, 1904 i
 tak chalati rahi
 On 12 January, the Japanese monarch laid down the last conditions that if Russia accepts territorial integrity of China and does not obstruct the legitimate actions of Japan and other countries in Manchuria and does not interfere with the Japanese interests of Korea, then Japan will take Manchuria from its sphere of influence Willing to understand outside
 jab inkaa koi santeshajanak uttar na aayaa or roosi fujen baraakar purv kii ore jamaa hoti raheen to yuddh avashyambhavi ho gaya
 The specialty of this war was that a great European power was defeated by an Eastern power
 may, 1904 i
 main donon pakshon ke bich bhayankar yuddh hua
 The Japanese committed terrible bloodshed at Sha-ho for ten days in October
 port arthur lambey samay tak japan ke ghere main padaa rahaa
 In February, 1905, there was a difficult battle of the Mukden
 ant main, japani safal hue or rus ko mukaden chhodana padaa
 Manchuria also accepted Japan's dominance
 mukaden kii vijay ke pashchaat sthal par koi yuddh nahin hua, kyonki japan kaa saadhan kam ho gayi the or rus kii himmat post ho chuki thi
 The decisive front of the war between Russia and Japan was maritime war
 isamen atharah hajaar roosi navikon main se baarah hajaar kii jane gayi
 Only one hundred thirty-six men from Japan were killed
 roosiyon kii sainyashakti chakanachur ho gai
 After that, the mediation of US President Roosevelt led to a treaty between the two sides
 ise 'portsmouth kii sandhi' kehete hai
 According to the treaty in Portsmouth on 5 September 1905, the following things were decided - rus kii paraajay se japani samrajyavad ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast ho gaya
 He went one step further in East Asia politics
 rus-japan yuddh main japan kii vijay se japan ko chini kshetra main ghus jane kaa acha avasar mil gaya
 Whereas Russia's expansion into East Asia stopped
 manchuriya par uskaa naam-maatr kaa adhikaar rahaa
 In the war, Japan proved that it is a powerful nation in the world
 isi aadhaar par usne britain se anurodh kiya ki angl-japani sandhi main aise sanshodhan kiye jaaen, jisase japan ko kuch adhik laabh ho
 More importantly, Russia's influence over Korea came to an end
 ab japan korea main apni icchaanusaar kaam kar saktaa tha
 Taking the opportunity, he incorporated Korea into his empire in 1910 AD
 is prakaar, korea ko japani samrajya main sammilit karne ke kaary main rus-japan yuddh kaa bada yogadan rahaa
 Japan's reputation rose throughout the world, especially in East Asia
 japan kaa utsaah bahut badha or yuddh main vijay ke uparaant usne ugr samrajyavaadee niti apanaayi, jiske falswaroop uskaa vishaal samrajya sthapit hua
 Raj Bhavan Jammu is the official winter residence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir state of India
 yah rajya kii sheetakaaleen rajdhani jammu main sthit he
 Narinder Nath Vohra is the current Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and he assumed the post of Governor on 25 June 2008
 jammu kaa rajbhavan vahaan ke maharaja ke bahut se mehalon, ranbir mahal, main se ek tha jo vartmaan main jammu or kashmir sarkaar kii kirayedari main he
 The Raj Bhavan is on the side of the famous Tavi River
 yah 15
75 acre ke
 It is spread in Etrafal and has a huge Durvakshetra where all the programs are organized
 bharat ke aadhikarik ucch padaadhikari rajya ke jammu daure ke dauraan yaheen rukate hai
 In ordinary colloquial language, karma means 'action'
 vyakaran main kriya se nishpadyaman fal ke aashray ko karm kehete hai
 "ram goes home" In this example "home" is the karma of "go verb" as being the shelter of the fruit of the movement
 darshan main karm ek vishesh arth main prayukt hota he
 Any fruit produced by what humans do
 yah fal shubh, ashubh athwa donon se bhinn hota he
 This form of the fruit is stabilized by action
 daan shubh karm he par hinsa ashubh karm he
 Here the word karma is used for both action and fruit
 yah baat is bhaavana par aadhaarit he ki kriya sarvada fal ke saath sanlagn hoti he
 Action definitely produces fruit
 yahan dhyaan rakhana chahie ki sharir kii swaabhaavik kriyaaon kaa isamen samavesh nahin he
 The lifting and falling of the eyelids is also an action, but it does not produce fruit
 darshan kii seemaa main is prakaar kii kriya kaa koi mahatv isliye nahin he ki vah kriya man:prerit nahin hoti
 The above general rule applies only in mind-induced actions
 jaan boojhkar kisi ko daan dena athwa kisi kaa vadh karnaa hi sarthak he
 But inadvertently giving someone a favor or harming someone, does it not come in the above period of karma? It is said in the law that ignorance of the law cannot save a person from the fruits of action
 gita bhi kahati he ki karm ke shubh ashubh fal ko avashya bhogana padataa he, usase chhutkaaraa nahin miltaa
 In this situation, well-known and unintentional actions have auspicious results
 anjaane main kii gai kriyaaon ke bare main keval itnaa hi kaha jaataa he ki agyaan karta kaa dosha he or us dosha ke liye karta hi uttaradaayi he
 The subject must find out everything related to the verb before it enters the verb
 swaabhaavik kriyaaon se agyaan main kii kai kriyaaon kaa bhed keval is baat main he ki swaabhaavik kriyaayein bina man kii sahaayta ke apane aap hoti hai par agyanprerit kriyaayein apane aap nahin hotin-unamem man kaa haath hota he
 Even if you do not want the eyelids will fall, but no action can be done in ignorance without wanting
 kriya kaa parinaam kriya ke uddeshy se bhinn ho, phir bhi yah aavashyak nahin ki kriya kii jaae
 Hence, the functions and fruits which are different from natural actions come within the periphery of karma
 kriya or fal kaa sambandh kaary-kaaran-bhav ke atoot niyam par aadhaarit he
 If the reason exists then the work will definitely happen
 yah prakritik niyam aacharan ke kshetra main bhi satya he
 Therefore, it is said that the subject of the action is the enjoyer of the fruit
 baudhon ne karta ko kshanik mana he parantu is niyam ko charitaarth karne ke liye ve kshansantan main ek prakaar kii ekarupata maanate hue kehete hai ki ek vyakti kii santan duusare vyakti kii santan se bhinn he
 Even the difference in personality does not make a difference; Therefore, the person enjoys the pre-executed verb in the later period
 yid ham yah na maane to kahana padegaa ki kisi duusare ke dwaara kii gai kriya kaa fal kaa koi doosraa bhogata he jo tark viruddh he
 If there is complete faith in this rule, then the argument forces us to accept another conclusion as well
 yadi sabhi kriyaaon kaa fal bhogana padataa he to un kriyaaon kaa kya hoga jinka fal bhogane ke pehle hi karta mar jaataa he? yaa to hamen karm ke siddhant ko chhodana hoga yaa phir, maananaa hoga ki karta nahin marataa, vah keval sharir ko badal detaa he
 Indian thinkers have accepted only one side of the other
 ve kehete hai ki maranaa sharir kaa swaabhaavik karm he, parantu bhoga ke liye yah aavashyak nahin he ki vahi sharir bhoge jisane kriya kii he
 The bhokta is different and he wears another body to enjoy the work
 isi ko punarjanmavaad kehete hai
 Death is an incidental natural action of the body that has no effect on karma
 at: karm ke siddhant ko punarjanm se alag karke nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Not only that, when the relation of the verb is considered to be fruitful, then it is also necessary to assume that enjoyment - which according to auspicious inauspicious deeds, is pleasurable or sad - is inevitable
 usase bachaa nahin ja saktaa, na to usko badla ja saktaa he
 The only remedy for the loss of fruit is to consume it
 is janm main praani jaisaa he uske purv janmon kii kriyaaon kaa fal maatr he
 The fruit is a power that controls the state of life
 is shakti kaa punj bhi karm kaha jaataa he or kuch log ise bhagya yaa niyati bhi kehete hai
 In fatalism, it is believed that the creature is controlled by destiny and hence is dependent
 vah swayan kuch nahin karata
 But in addition to suffering the fruits of the actions of previous lives, he is also an independent doer in this birth, so in addition to the past actions, he performs deeds for the future
 isi main uskaa swatantray he
 Freedom is essential for ethics, and almost all Indian philosophers believe it
 kriya, kriyafal tathaa kriyafal kaa samooh, jise adrusht bhi kehete hai, bhartiya darshan main karm shabd se abhihit hota he
 It has been said earlier that mind-motivation is an essential tool of karma
 man:-prerana ke shubh yaa ashubh hone se hi karm shubh yaa ashubh haata he
 The doctor dissects the patient for his good
 yadi is cheerfaad se rogi ko ksht hota he to doctor uskaa uttaradaayi nahin he
 The doctor is doing good work
 at: du:kha, jo ashubh man:prarena se kii gai kriya kaa fal he, tabhi dur ho saktaa he jab man ko ashubh prabhaavon se bachaaya jaae
 Always doing auspicious actions can only be done by thinking auspicious
 ksht ke bachane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 But a person who performs auspicious deeds must be born to bear fruit, whether in heaven or on earth
 janm lenaa apane aapmen mahan ksht he kyonki janm kaa sambandh mrityu se he
 The pain of death is considered to be painful
 at: yadi is ksht se bhi chhutkaaraa paanaa he to janm kii parampara ko bhi samaapt karnaa hoga
 For this, renunciation of auspicious deeds is necessary because without his birth there is no liberation
 at: shubhashubh parityagi hi vaastavik du:khamukt ho saktaa he
 Is a good abandonment possible? It would not have been possible to have a body
 par ek upaay he
 This can be proved by refinement of mind
 yadi man main kisi fal kii aakanksha ke bina, palak uthne girane kii tarah, sari kriyaayein swaabhaavik rup se kii jaaen to unase shubh ashubh fal utpann nahin honge or janm mrityu se bhi chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 This is the ideal of free work
 iske vipareet saare karm-jo shubh ashubh hote hai-sakaam karm hai or ve bandhan ke kaaran hai
 Fantasies of heaven and hell are also associated with this principle of karma
 shubh karmon ke parinamswaroop sakal sukhon se purna swarg kii prapti hoti he
 On the contrary, hell is attained
 swarg narak main bhi shubh ashubh karm kii maatra ke anusaar anek str maane gaye hai, jaise prithvi par anek str hai
 By following the principle of karma, it is necessary to follow the imagination of heaven and hell, which we call auspicious karma, they are called virtue and inauspicious karma sin
 punya or paap mukhyat: kriya ke fal kaa bodh karaate hai
 There are three types of actions
 nityakarm ve hai jo na karne par paap utpann karte hai, kintu karne par kuch bhi nahin utpann karte
 Doing virtuous deeds leads to virtue and not to commit sins
 kamya karm kaamana se kiye jate hai at: unke karne se fal kii siddhi hoti he
 Nothing happens by not doing it
 chunki teenon karmon main yah uddeshy chipa he ki punya arjeet kiya jaae, paap se dur rahaa jaae, at: ye sabhi karm man:prerit hai
 To get rid of birth, abandonment of daily, routine and kamya deeds is considered to be extremely important

 Many sources and forums and online references to survival literature suggest ways by which water can be stored and made available safely for consumption in the event of survival, such as by boiling, filtering, by chemicals

 Survival training can be divided into three types or schools; Modern Wild Survival, Bushcraft and Primary Survival Techniques

 haalanki ek takanic sookhe up sahaara kshetra main kargar ho sakati he, wahi takanic vastav main arctic jalwaayu main swasthya ke liye hanikar ho sakati he
 According to the commentators the mind and its processes are important for survival
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki jivan or mrityu kii sthiti main jivit rahane kii ichha aksar un logon ko alag karti he jo jivit rahete hai or jo jivit nahin rahete hai
 The heroic stories of survival are often those who have not been given any training, they only have a strong desire to live, these stories are very common
 larens gonjales ne apni pustak deep cervival: hu leeves, hu dise an vaay main ek kishor ladki juliane kopke kii kahani ko bataaya he, jo amejan ke jangalon main ek vimaan durghatana kii shikaar ho jaati he
 She would not have been given any formal training, she only wore normal clothes, she lived in the forest for several days with parasitic insects

 ve log jo is durghatana main batch gaye, vah akeli thi jo jinda bachi
 gonjales kaa maananaa he ki uske avinashi or saadhaaran rup ne yah antar sthapit kiya
 The real survival situation is so stressful that even those who understand this stress well, even trained specialists are considered mentally affected to face this risk

 Finally, a common reaction to adversity is stress, which helps to survive — at least briefly, prepares you to cope with adversity
 If stress persists for long periods of time, it produces the opposite effect, which affects a person's ability to survive
 vishesh rup se, tippaneekaron ke anusaar tanaav ke liye vipareet paristhitiyaan nimna hai: asamarthta, sone main asamarthta, galtiyaan karne kii pravriti, kam urja, krodh yaa gussa aana or laaparvaahee

 scorcard Scorecard shunagashep aitarey brahman main sthit ek aakhyaan he
 The gist of it is that until death comes, conversion does not happen
 yah aakhyaan maanviya lobh, beimaani or usase upar uthne kii kshamta kii katha he
 King Harishchandra was childless despite his hundred queens
 usne varun devtaa kii upasna kii ki agar mujhe putr prapti ho to pehla putr aapako samarpit karuunga
 He had a son, named Rohit
 lekin raja ne jaise hi putr ko sadeh dekha, uski niyat main khot aa gaya
 He kept avoiding talking of handing Rohit to Varuna Deity on some pretext
 pita kahin use sachmuch varun dev ko nahin arpit kar den, is dar se rohit jangal main bhaag gaya or harishchandr ne apana pran puraa nahin kiya, isliye varun ne use shaap de diya or vah biimaar ho gaya
 Luckily roaming around in the forest, Rohit brought a woman named Azigart to a poor Brahmin
 usase rohit ne apni kahani kahi
 Azigart had three sons - Shun: Pucha, Shun: Langul and Shun: Shep
 shun:shape manjhala putr tha or bachapan se hi bahut samajhadaar or vivekwan tha
 Azigart greedily tells Rohit that he is ready to sell one of his sons in exchange for a hundred cows
 us putr ko vah apane badale varun devtaa ko saunp kar apni jaan bachaa saktaa he
 Shun on the other hand: Shep thought, younger brother is mother's dear, elder brother is father's dear, if i go away, neither of them will have any regret
 isliye vah khud hi rohit ke saath jane ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Varun Dev was also no less greedy
 ve yah soch kar prasann ho gaye ki mujhe apane anushthan ke liye kshatriya balak ke badale brahman balak mil rahaa he jo shreshthatar he
 In the yajna, preparations for the male sacrifice began, four priests were called
 ab shun:shape ko bali stambh se baandhna tha
 But none of those four prepared for this, because Shun: Shep was a Brahmin
 tab ajigart or sau gaayon ke badale khud hi apane bachche ko yajna stambh se baandhne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 After this it was the turn to sacrifice Shun: Shep
 lekin purohiton ne phir manaa kar diya
 Who should kill a Brahmin? Then Azigart and also agreed to cut his son in exchange for one hundred cows
 jab shun:shape ne dekha ki ab mujhe bachaane vaala koi nahin he, to usne usha devtaa kaa stvan shuru kiya
 With each Richa, each bond of Shun: Shep broke, and with the last Richa, not only Shun: Shape was freed, but King Harishchanda also became cursed
 isi ke saath balak shun:shape, rishi shun:shape ban gaya, kyonki vah uske liye roopantaran kii ghadi thi
 According to some other scholars, Shun: The great ascetic born in the clan of Shep Kaushiko and the daughter of Vishwamitra's enemy Shambar was the lost child of Ugra, which Lopamudra hid near Ajitgarta due to fear of Bharato
 bharto ne ugr ko maar diya
 The mind and life of any human born in the Indian culture remains tied to the three quarters
 yah ek nirvivaad hakeekat he
 These three names are named - 1

 Finance and 3
 Lokaixa
 in teenon main se jo vitaishna he, vah manushya-jivan ke vyaavhaarik jivan se naata rakhti he
 And the Lokaााaa, it is related to the post mortal folk etc
, who have received the pre-eminence-propitiation sacrifice 
 parantu jo putraishna he, vah manushyamaatr kii pruthivilok par sadaiv bane rahane kii shaashvat evam saarvbhaum ichha kaa akatya ankur he
 And in such a daughter-in-law, both son and daughter are desired - this thing is logically implied
 lekin strideh kii prakritik maryaadaaon ke kaaran, strideh kii apeksha purushadeh sabal hone ke kaaran samaaj main purush kaa mahatva badhata gaya he or vishwa main bahushah samaaj purushpradhan aakaarit hota rahaa he
 Therefore, son-in-law has become enlightened in the mind of man

 Such as - whether there were malevolent yagas during Vedas
 shunamshepakhyaan main varunadevataa ko koi manushya kaa bali chadhaane kii baat aati he, is liye duniya bhar ke vidwaanon ne ek hi baat ko charchaa kaa bindu banaaya he ki vaidic yajna-yagadi main pashubali ke saath saath manushyon kaa bhi bali chadhaaya jaataa tha ki nahin
 - But in this narrative no human sacrifice is ultimately offered
 is ke kaaran punarvichaar kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 In the beginning of this Shunashekayakhana, King Harishchandraji has asked Narada that - both wise and ignorant people wish for their sons
 to mujhe yah bataao ki putr kii kaamana kyon kerani chaiye ? is jigyaasa kaa samaadhaan dete huye naradji ne kaha ki putr to param vyom main bhi jyoti-swaroop hota he
 On the other hand, at the end of this narrative, it is said that this story should be recited in the context of the coronation of any king, and whoever wishes a son, these people should also listen to this narrative
 shunagashep aakhyaan ke is upkram evam upsanhaar ko dhyaan main rakhte huye yadi dekha jaay to is aakhyaan main teen putron evam teen pitaaon kii katha prastut hui he
 As it is the case of the first father: - Harishchandra, the king of Ikshvaku dynasty, was ineligible even though he was a wife
 parantu in shat-sankhyak vivaahon ke peeche nishchit rup se, chaalak parible ke rup main putraishna hi rahi hogi
 Narada has explained in detail the benefits that come from having a son
 usko sun kar harishchandr varunadevataa se kisi bhi kimmat par putr kii yachana karata he
 Once a son is born and if he faces it, then he will be grateful
 or uske baad vah varun ko putr kii bali chadhaane ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Harishchandra got a son on this condition
 yahan prastut aakhyaan kii katha se malum hota he ki manushyamaatr main jo putraishna he, vah aadmi ko kadachi andhshraddha main duubo detii he
 a son is obtained by sacrificing to the gods - to believe it is an ignorance
 duusare str par yahan dekha jaataa he ki putr-prapti ke baad pita harishchandr mohandh bhi ho jate he or varun ko balidaan dene ke vaada se baar baar peeche hath karte rahete he
 Whenever Varun Dev comes to ask for sacrifice, then he keeps on pretending to give sacrifice to his son, showing one excuse after another
 jo doosraa pita he vah suyavas kaa putr ajigart he
 The poor person is suffering from hunger
 uske paas ashrith ke rup main unki patni or teen putr bhi he
 Being sold in an extraordinary and unavoidable crisis of hunger, he sells any of his sons in the market is not fair
 atah vah kutumb ke dhurin hone ke naate swayan hi bik jaay to vahi thik mana jaayegaa
 But "everyone loves their own soul more than all" - If this cruel truth is taken into consideration and thought again, the possibility of selling one of the three sons may be tolerable
 isi tarah se, mata-pita kii yugon puraani ek nirbalata bhi kubul kii jaay kii pita ko jyeshthaputra hi priy hota he or mata ko kanishthputra hi adhik priy hota he
 So the poor 'ascetic' Madhyamaputra definitely becomes the goat of sacrifice in such an odd situation
 is tarah, kshudharth pita ajigart raja harishchandr se so gaayon ko le kar, uske badale main ek putr ko bech de to vah kadachit – haan kadachit hi – anichhaa se nyaayik bataaya ja saktaa he
 But if the same father is ready to tie his son as a sacrificial animal, in the sacrificial fire of Harishchandra and ask for other cows for such a cruel act, then it will be said to be the result of greed
 aakhyaankar mahidas aitarey ne lobh kii paraakaashtha bhi bataayi he
 Father Azigart does not relent with his sinful act after tying up son Shunshape with Yup
 yajna main shunagashep kaa bali ke rup main jab tak koi vadh nahin karegaa, tab tak yajna puraa nahin hoga
 None of the chandals from the village is willing to come and kill a man
 atah shunagashep kaa pita ajigart lobhavshaat is paapakarm ke liye taiyaar hota he
 He asked for the third sleeping cows
 tathaa nirdayata-purvak apane hi putr kaa vadh karne ke liye nangi talwaar lekar uth chalata he
 - This picture reveals the iniquity of a greedy father
 darshanashastron main jo shad ripu ke rup main ginaye gayi he – kaam, krodh, mad, moh, lobh or matsar – unamem se uttarottar ripu kaa balwattar hona mana gaya he
 That is, Ripu named fifth greed is more powerful than the first Kamadi four ripu
 is drushti se dekha jaay to duusare prakaar ke pita ne lobhagrast hokar, keval pitrumaryada kaa hi bhang nahin kiya he
 But, by encroaching human dignity, he has gone far to the sinful path
 tisare pita ke rup main rishi vishwamitra he, jinke ek-so ek putr the
 In his leadership, it was certain to sacrifice Shunashep in a yajna
 unhone apane sammukh dayaneey dasha main bandhe hue shunagashep ko yagyeey-pashu ke rup main dekha he
 His pathetic pity and helplessness have also been seen every moment
 or vikat paristhiti main devon kii upasna kaa maarg pakadnevaala, swayan hi apana uddharak banakar mrityu-pash main se chhutne kaa prayaas karanevaala dhairyavan shunagashep unhon ne baariki se dekha he
 Prajapati, Agni, Savita, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Ashvinau, Indra and Usha - all Vedic deities are shown by Shunashep respectively from their mantras
 unase baatcheet bhi karata he
 Who would not like such a true Brahminputra sage? rishi vishwamitra ne aise shunagashep ko hi apni viraasat – gyanrashi – ko sambhalanevaala samajha
 or man hi man shunagashep ko apane putr ke rup main usko sweekaar liya
 Vishwamitra was a man of merit as a father
 unhon ne apane pratham pachaas putron ko bulaayen or shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne ko kaha
 But those sons did not obey the ancestral order
 atah vishwamitra ne un pachaason ko ‘ aputra ’ jaahir kar diye
 They were deprived of the right portion of sage wealth
 is ke baad, jo madhuchhnda naamak ikyanavaan putr tha or unke jo sabhi anuj the, unhon ne shunagashep ko apana jyeshtha bhrata maan liya
 Vishwamitra Rishi then proclaimed Shunasha Shep as "devrat"
 putraishna rakhanevaale manushyon ko chaiye ki ve pehele vishwamitra jaise gungnata pita bane
 Vishwamitra liked this mantradashtha Shunsha Shep as the best son, and accepted him as his son, as expected of his centuries - this is a big indicator
 yadi aisa putr mila ho to hi naarad ne jo kaha tha ki – “ putr param vyom main bhi jyoti hota he, ”- vah charitaarth ho saktaa he, anyathaa nahin
 In this narrative it is necessary to compare the three fathers like King Harishchandra, the impoverished Azigart and the sage Vishwamitra, in the same way it is worth comparing the three types of sons as well
 jaisaa ki – pahela he raja harishchandr kaa putr rohit
 He opposes his father's proposal and, after rejecting the paternal order, commits homicide to protect the life and wanders in the forest
 is ke baad pita ko jalodar naamak rog hua he – aisa sun kar, pitruvatsalya se prerit ho kar vah ghar waapas aane kaa nirnay karata he
 But on the way Indradev is found, comes in his words and he comes again and again in the direction of others and returns to the forest
 in shabdon se indra ne jo upadesh diya tha, iskaa fal yah aata he ki harishchandr ke putr rohit ko van-vicharan ke dauraan, teen putron ko saath main lekar ann kii talash main ghum rahe ek daridr pita ajigart mil gaya
 Being a Rajput, Rohit comes back to the palace on the insistence of Rajalakshmi, that is, on the insistence of father-earning, buying a poor and inferior son of a poor person
 rajkumaar rohit ne man main aisa soch rakhaa he ki is daridr-brahmanputra kaa bali de kar, varun ke pash se pita ko vah mukt kara legaa or apane aap ko bhi maut se mukti mil jaayegi
 Here, Rohit, who has been repeatedly wandering in the place of Indra, is introduced to Rohit, first as a son with an indecisive morale and later, as a Rajput son taking shelter of selfish and father-earning
 sansar main yah pehele prakaar kaa putr he
 
 sansar main jo duusare prakaar kaa putr hota he, vah rishi vishwamitra ke agraj 50 putron hai
 They do not obey even a mantra father like Vishwamitra
 pita kii vivekbuddhi kii avhelnaa karanevaale in putron ne paitruk-viraasat kho di or shaapit bhi huye
 As a result, they start living like dacoits in society
 ikyanavaan madhuchhnda naamak putr or unke anuj 50 bhratri-samooh ne pita kii ajna maan lee
 These sons, who believed in Vishwamitra's eyes, accepted Shunha Sheep as their eldest brother
 
 The third type of son who is always palpable is Shunhashep
 puure aakhyaan ko padh kar lagata he ki vah kshudha-peedit vyakti jarur tha, parantu nity vidya-vyasang karne vaala putr tha
 Because he was well aware of the mantras that have come in the fourth and fourth divisions of the Rigveda to get rid of Varuna's loop
 saath main vah swayan bhi, pratham mandal main sangruhit anek mantron kaa drashtaa rishi bhi he
 Hence, he becomes an intelligent son in the eyes of sage Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ko apane hi 101 orasaputra the
 But he regretted not having a mantra-seer son like Shunha Shep
 atah vah apane orasputron ko bula ke shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne kii ajna detaa he
 According to him, only a son like Shun Shashep is collectible and palatable
 vishwamitra ne puri yajyakriya ke dauraan dekha he ki shunagashep sahi arth main devraat he
 Gods like Agni, Varuna, Indra, Ashvinau, Vishwadeva and Usha were his property - Rati - and on that he has achieved his salvation
 yahan par, shunagashep vidya-vyasangi hone ke kaaran amuk mantra jaanata he yaa naye mantra dekh saktaa he – itnaa hi kahana paryaapt nahin he
 He has even told his father's sin on his face
 arthath shunagashep satya kaa aparoksh darshan bhi kar saktaa he or pita ke sammukh khada rahe kar vah bataa bhi saktaa he
 That is his greatness
 aise satya ko bolne vaale ko hi varun pash se mukt karata he, duusare ko nahin
 Because Varuna is said to be the fettle god of the policy and the master of the ritual
 atah vah satyaniti ke drashtaa shunagashep ko bandhan se mukt kar detaa he
 Only such a son of truth can become a form of light for the fathers in the Supreme Vyom
 or aise putr kii hi kaamana rakhni chaiye
 That is, the son should also be controlled with discretion
 is tarah se shunamshepakhyaan kaa marmoddhatan ho jane ke baad, is aakhyaan kaa upsanhaar bhi turant samaj main aa jaataa he ki - 1
 kisi bhi raja ke abhishek-prasang main is aakhyaan kaa paath karwaane kii soochna kyun di gai he ?
 It is unfair to be blinded to get an heir to the state
 2
 tathaev, putr kii ichha rakhanevaalon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa pathshravan karnaa chaiye – aisa jo upsanhaar main kaha gaya he vah bhi purvokt teen tarah ke putron ko thik se samaj lene ke liye hi he
 
 yahan aanushanbik rup se yah bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki is aakhyaan ke upakrmopsanhaar ko dekhte hue - “ vedakaal main narbali diya jaataa tha ki nahin ? ” jaisi charchaayen saare sansar main azdin tak hoti rahi he, parantu vah charchaa bhrantadisha main chal rahi he – aisa pratiti hota he
 Now, if seen from the innovative point of view, then the message of Shunshape to this world suffering from sexual harassment is that the opportunity has come to get rid of female murders
 koi bhi putree maatpita ko narak main nahin le jaati he or sab ke sab putr param vyom main le janevaali sachhee jyoti nahin ban sakate he

 and deny the written things on their own Puranas

 These coils may be associated with the armature coil in series or associated in parallel or in parallel
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unke kuch kundalan shrenee main hon or kuch samaantar main
 Based on this combination of field coils, three different types of direct current motors are obtained - shrenee motor main jo dhara armechar main se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vahi kshetra kundali main bhi pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, there is very little coil of coarse wire in its field coil
 shant motor main purna dhara kaa kuch ansh hi kshetra kundali main hokar bahata he, jo uske aarpaar boltata tathaa kundalan ke pratirodh par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, in this region the coil has very high coil of very thin wire, due to which the resistance of this coil is usually several hundred ohms

 mobile phone aajkal har vyakti kii aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he
 Users of Hindi on Internet want a phone so that they can use Hindi on their phone as well, which includes surfing of Hindi sites, email, chat, blogging, tweeting, etc
 ab prashn uthta he ki mobile phone main hindi kaa samarthan kis rup main he
 There are mainly three aspects of Hindi support in mobile
 mobile par hindi paathya athwa taxt kaa pradarshan ho saktaa he yaa nahin? yadi phone main hindi dikh hi nahin sakati to input to hoga hi nahin, hindi samarthan kii yah pehali shart he
 Some phones have full support of Hindi display
 kuch main aanshik unicode samarthan hone se hindi dikhaai to detii he lekin sahi rup se nahin yani matraayen evam sanyuktakshar sahi rup se prakat nahin hote or hindi bikhri hui si dikhaai detii he
 The reason for this is that the phone has a Hindi font, but the phone's complex script layout engine does not support Hindi, that is, it does not render Devanagari correctly
 aise phonon main kuch softwaron main hindi sahi rup se dikh sakati he jo ki phone kii bajaay apana hindi font ingine prayog karte hon
 In phones where Hindi is not supported at all, coaches appear instead of Hindi
 yadi phone main hindi pradarshan hetu samarthan he to input kaa vikalp ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 If the phone has the option of Hindi input, then SMS can be sent in Hindi and Hindi can be written in the text box anywhere on the web
 is vikalp ke hone par mobile se hindi main email bhejne, chitthee likhane, tippanee karne samet internet par tamaam kaary hindi main kiye ja sakate hai
 Most phones have a T-9 system for Hindi typing
 sabhi devanagari varnon ko keepad ke nau batano par samyojit kiya jaataa he tathaa baar-baar dabaakar sahi varna tip kiye jate hai
 Additionally, many phones also have a T-9 prediction so that words can be typed by simply pressing a few buttons with predictive input
 purvanumaan phone main hindi main saralata se tip karne main bahut sahaayak he, thode abhyaas ke uparant purvanumaan se kaaphi gati se hindi tip kii ja sakati he
 Words that are not in the phone's prediction dictionary can be added so that they can be typed by prediction next time
 tach screen vaale jin kuch phonon main hindi samarthan uplabdh he unamem iske liye inascript onscreen virtual keyboard hota he
 It is like the image of a computer so that Hindi can be written anywhere on the phone
 hindi interphes se arth he ki phone main interphes bhashaa ke rup main hindi kaa vikalp hona
 On selecting the Hindi interface language in the phone, all the menus, options etc
 are displayed in Hindi
 yadhyapi hindi interphes kaa vikalp uplabdh hone par bhi prayog bahut kam log karte hai jiskaa kaaran ashuddh anuwaad tathaa clisht shabdaawalee hota he
 If the phone has an option of interface language Hindi, then generally Hindi display and input support will be there
 nokia phone main iskaa pataa lagane ke liye menu>settings>phone>phone Language main jaaen
 If it is, then your phone has display and input support, the interface may or may not be language
 yah pataa lagane ke liye kisi anya phone se us phone par hindi main sandesh bhej kar dekhie athwa yadi phone main jeepiaras sakasham he to koi hindi site khol kar dekhie
 Will it be known whether Hindi can be read in the phone? nokia ke sabhi nimna stareey, adhiktar madhyam stareey tathaa kuch nimna ucch stareey phonon main hindi samarthan hota he
 Maximum low and medium level phones are equipped with S40 operating system which usually has Hindi support
 nokia si3 nokia kaa pehla model he jisamen bhautik hindi inascript keepad aayaa he
 Most high-end phones have S60 operating systems that do not typically have Hindi support
 nokia ke kuch chuninda smartphone modelon main hi purna hindi samarthan uplabdh he
 No Nokia touch screen phones have seen Hindi support yet
 nokia phone main hindi hetu tii-9 input vyavastha hoti he
 The Devanagari varnas are set on 9 keys as follows
 1 = 1 2 = a a e e e u u r 2 3 = e i ji o ou o 3 4 = kk d d 4 q q g 5 = c chha ja jha na 5 za 6 = Structure 6 7 = t tha da dha na 7 ji 8 = 8 feet in feet 9 = ya r l l va sha sha sa ha 9 ji ji ji The above characters may vary slightly according to the phone models, but the main sequence remains the same
 kisi taxt box main hindi input sakasham karne hetu options>writing languages>hindi main jaayen athwa phone kii "*" kunjee dabaakar rakhen to Writing Languages kaa vikalp aa jaataa he
 The words can be typed by just pressing a few buttons with predictive text input
 purvanumaan phone main hindi main saralata se tip karne main bahut sahaayak he, thode abhyaas ke uparant purvanumaan se kaaphi gati se hindi tip kii ja sakati he
 Words that are not in the phone's prediction dictionary can be added so that they can be typed by prediction next time
 purvanumaan on / of switch karne hetu phone par upar ke baayen kone kii kunjee dabaakar rakhen, asthaayee rup se badalane ke liye "*" kunjee kaa prayog karen
 Most high-end phones are equipped with an S60 operating system, which typically does not have Hindi support
 nokia ke kuch chuninda smartphone modelon main hi purna hindi samarthan uplabdh he
 Most phones without touchscreen without Nokia have S60 v3 version which usually has Hindi display support but no input support, for example Nokia E63, Nokia E71 etc
 nokia ke tachascreen vaale adhiktar phone S60 v5 sanskaran yukt hote hai jinamein hindi pradarshan samarthan aanshik rup se hota he arthath phone main hindi font hone se hindi dikhaai to detii he lekin sahi prakaar se randar nahin hoti jis kaaran matraayen tathaa sanyuktakshar sahi prakaar se nahin dikhte, udhaaharan ke liye nokia bin97, nokia bin97 mini, nokia 5800 oxpres mujeec, nokia 5233, nokia 5230 aadi
 Symbian ^ 3 smartphones like N8, etc
 have the same situation
