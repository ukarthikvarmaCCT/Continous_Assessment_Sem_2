 yadi vyakti ko purnat: vash main kar liya gaya ho to ek purna vidhivat bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, a soulful Christian living on his faith cannot suffer from ghosts
 Under this belief structure, the reasons for the demon-infiltration can usually be interpreted as a deviation from the doctrine of theology, or may be due to pre-conversion deeds
 kisi vyakti ko mukti kii aavashyaktaa he yaa nahin iske nirdhaaran kii paaramparik vidhi kaa prayog kisi aise vyakti ko upasthit rakhkar kiya jaataa he jisamen atmaaon ko apsaarit karne kaa hunar ho
 It is a boon of the Holy Spirit from 1 Corinthians 12 that enables a person to feel the presence of a demon
 yadhyapi aarambhik nidaan ko praaia: sangat dwaara chunauti nahin di jaati, kintu jab ek hi sangat main aise bahut se vardaan praapt vyakti hon to parinaam alag-alag hote hai
 Francis Gabriel Amorth refers to such people as "sears and Sensitives" and uses them on many occasions; They have the ability to detect the presence of demons
 yadhyapi, vah note karte hai ki “ve hameshaa sahi nahin hote: unke anubhav kii jaanch avashya kii jaani chahie”
 unke udaahranon main, ve un ghatnaon kaa pataa lagane main sakasham hote hai jiske kaaran bhoot kaa pravesh hua he, athwa ve us dusht vastu ko dhudhane main sakasham hote hai jisane vyakti ko abhishaapit kiya he

 Conversation with the soul is another important part of the ritual of exorcism
 yah bhoot-apsaarak ko yah jaanane main madad karata he ki bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti ke jivan main aatma kis prakaar kaary karti he
 The symptoms and events expressed by the soul are confirmed by the victim after liberation
 bhoot-pret kaa apasaaran hameshaa safal nahin hota or gileta duusare udhaaharan ke bare main bataate hai jisamen saamaanya vidhiyaan asafal ho gai thim or bhoot ne baad main jaakar peedit ko pratyaksh rup se choda
 kisi ghatana main, “sabhi maamalon main bhoot ko kisi or nahin balki yishu ke naam se aadesh diya jaataa he
 " bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii isai pratha aise vyakti ke liye hoti he jo gambhir maansik athwa shaareerik rog kii prakriya ke antargat he or bhoot-pret ke apasaaran ke anushthan kii aadhikarik sweekruti se purv rog ke maansik athwa shaareerik kaaran nahin hai, is baat kii pushti ke liye maansik or shaareerik chikitsakon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 When all possible causal causes are ruled out, the case is treated as an incurable ghost barrier and in this case, exorcism can be performed

 He concluded that the Christian concept of possession was a real event
 unhone kaha ki roman catholic carch dwaara istemaal un logon se kuch alag naidanik mandandon nikaali gai
 He also claimed to see differences in chandelier processes and progress
 apane anubhavon ke baad or apane shodh maanya praapt karne ke prayaas main, vah prayaas kiya lekin dsam-iv ke liye "" buraai kii paribhaasha jodne ke liye manorog samudaay paane main vifal rahe
 Peck's earlier work was largely met with popular acceptance, his work and authority on subjects of evil generated significant debate and ridicule
 zyada pek lagaataar ek jhootha or jodtod martin kaha jaataa he ki is tathy ke baavjood vivaadaaspad malaki martin, ek roman catholic padri or ek purv jesuit ke saath apane sahyog ke liye banaaya gaya tha

 iske atirikt monomaniya kaa ek rup hota he jise demonomaniya athwa demonopathy kehete hai, jisamen rogi ko yah vishwaas ho jaataa he ki us par ek yaa adhik bhuton kaa prakope he
 The fact that exorcism works on people who experience the symptoms of ghost disturbance is considered by some to be an effect caused by the effects of pseudo-medicine and the power of counseling
 anumaanit bhoot-baadha se grast kuch log vastav main atmarati se athwa nimna atmasamman se grast hote hai tathaa logon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht karne ke liye is prakaar kii harakatein karte hai maano ve "bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti" hon

 Yes r Ranganathan was a mathematician of India and the father of the library world who created colon classification and classified catalog codes
 pustkaalay vigyaan ko mahatv pradaan karne tathaa bharat main iskaa prachaar prasar karne main inkaa sakriy yogadan tha
 Ranganathan was born on 12 August 1892 in Shiali, Madras, present day Chennai
 ranganath kii shiksha shiyaali ke hindu hai skool, madras krishchayan college main or teachers college, saidapett main huyi
 In 1917, he was appointed to the Government College, Mangalore
 baad main unhone 1920 main government college, coimbatore or 1921-23 ke dauraan presidency college, madras vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary kiya
 In 1924, he was made the first librarian of the University of Madras and went to England to study at University College, London to gain the qualification for the post
 1925 se madras main unhone yah kaam puri lagan se shuru kiya or 1944 tak ve is pad par bane rahe
 During 1945–47, he worked as a Librarian and Professor of Library Science at Banaras Hindu University and during 1947–54 he taught at the University of Delhi
 1954-57 ke dauraan ve jurikh, switzraland main shodh or lekhan main vyast rahe
 He then returned to India and remained a visiting professor at Vikram University Ujjain until 1959

 san 1924 ke purv bharat main granthalay vyavsaay, lipic kaary or gharon main granthon tathaa granth jaisi vastuon ko rakhane kaa dhandha maatr hi samajha jaataa tha
 It was in 1924 when Dr
 Ranganathan arrived on the Granthalay scene of India, he was the first university librarian, who was appointed to the University of Madras
 ve apane jivan ke pratham 25 varshon ke dauraan apane ko ekal-anusandhan main tallin karke tathaa shesh 25 varshon main darrnusandhan kaa sanghathan karke bharat main granthalayan drishy ko pehle parivartit kiya

 The first President of India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, while congratulating Dr
 Ranganathan on his 71st birth anniversary, wrote, "dr
 Ranganathan not only organized the Madras University School and organized himself as an original thinker, but the whole Formally, the Granthalaya was a seeker in creating consciousness in the country
 vigat 40 varshon ke dauraan uske kaary or shiksha kaa hi parinaam he ki bharat main granthalay vigyaan tathaa granthalay vyavsaay uchit pratishtha praapt kar sakaa
 " dow ranganathan ne atyadhik srujanaatmak utsaah ke saath kaary kiya
 He developed his own ideas
 unhone baar-baar pustaken va shodh-patr likhe
 unhone jan-granthalay vidheyakon kaa masauda taiyaar kiya or rashtriya tathaa anterrashtriya kriya-kalapon ko protsaahit kiya tathaa sahyog diya

21 aadhuniktam prachlit pravritiyaan granthalay vargeekaran kaa itihaas pradarshit karata he ki vargeekaran kii yojanaon kaa vikaas purna aankik, jaise--librari of congress or ryder international vargeekaran, se swatantra mukh, vishleshnatmak-sanshleshneey, jaise--dvibindu vargeekaran kaa teesraa roopaantar tak tak hua
 The most popular trends in classification are: standardization, guest planning and computerization based on principles
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan vargeekaran kii ekarupata arthath `anterrashtriya vargeekaran yojana' kii taraf praytn kiye ja rahe hai
 This will provide the necessary savings of the inner power of intellectual readers, especially scholars
 yah anubhav kiya gaya he ki aisi vidhi kaa vikaas kiya jaay jo siddhanton par aadhaarit ho
 The expansion of knowledge is happening very rapidly
 naye-naye antar sanyam tathaa bahra sayanm vishay utpann ho rahe hai
 To deal effectively and productively with this expansion, a classification scheme should be in place that can accommodate new ideas to a commendable level, without changing its basic structure
 vargeekaran yojana ke vikaas, uskaa dhaanchaa taiyaar karne ke liye vidhi-tantra or pralekhnon ke vargeekaran, ke maarg-darshan hetu vargeekaran ke pragatisheel siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav kiya jaataa rahaa he
 This work was made possible by hospitality based on the principles of classification provided by Ranganathan and proved to be helpful in modernizing the classification scheme
 aaj ke yug main soochna ke rakh-rakhaav va usko pun: prapti ke liye sanganakeekaran kaa prachlan he
 We need powerful techniques and tools for information retrieval and its organization
 soochna-tantron ke sanganakikrut soochna pun: prapan main vargeekaran kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav kiya ja chukaa he, iske vargeekaran kaa mahatva or bad jaataa he
 a second trend is that of general versus special classification
 kyonki sab prakaar ke granthalayon, soochna-kendron, pralekhan kendron se yah apeksha kii jaati he ki uske paas sabhi prakaar ke pralekhon, kaa sangrah hoga, parantu vishesh mahatv ne un pralekhon, jinase ki ve sambandhit hai, unka ati sookshm-str par vargeekaran aavashyak hota he
 Thus, for classification of all types of documents, it is absolutely necessary to have a general classification
 yah dow ranganath the jinhone vargeekaran kii ek naveen kism--`swatantranmukh, vishleshnatmak-sanshleshneey vargeekaran' kaa nirmaan kiya, jo na keval falak vyavasthaapan ke liye hi apitu anukramanika taiyaar karne, aadi ke liye bhi mukt-kanth rup se sweekaar kii gayi
 For classification, 'free-face, analytic, syntactic scheme' are other schemes such as - often calculative examples such as Dewy Decimal Classification, often pane eg, ubiquitous decimal classification and hard pane
 udhaahrant: dvibindu-vargeekaran kaa pratham va dwitiya roopaantar, kii tulana main atyadhik aadhuniktaa pradaan karti he
 Which is the only solution to solve the latest trends and problems of classification
 vargeekaran ke kshetra main dow ranganathan kaa sarvaadhik anshdaan dvibindu vargeekaran he, jo sarv-pratham san 1933 main prakashit hua
 The second edition was published in 1939, the third in 1950, the fourth 1952 and the fifth 1957 and the sixth 1960 and the seventh edition is still at the juncture of uncertainty
 dow ranganathan keval vargeekarnacharya ke rup main hi nahin, apitu ek vargkaar ke rup main bhi jane jate hai
 During 1946-47, when he was Professor and Librarian of Library Science of Kashi Hindu University, according to his classification scheme, he re-classified about one lakh texts of University Library in a short span of about 18 months
 is kaary ke liye unhone apane hi diye gayi niyam paraasaran kaa niyam kii sahaayta lee
 The important thing is that he did all this in his 56 years of age by following his responsible works like reading work, administrative work etc
 dow ranganathan ne sarv-pratham `vargeekaran siddhanth' kaa sutarapaat kiya
 These principles provide consistency, uniformity, and compactness for the structure of classification systems and other word-store control measures
 aadhuniktam pravritiyon main isaki upyogit nimnaankit hai: 'classification work should be divided into three faces', it has been felt
 yah vichaar sarv-pratham dow ranganathan ne 1944 main sweekaar kiya
 By 1952, he was able to understand this goal well and divided the classification work into three faces namely Kalpana pane, Verbal pane and An kan pane
 unhone paaya ki `vichaar falak' sanyukt evam mishrit vishyon ko unke mukhon, upmukhon, tathaa ashleshon main vishleshit tathaa sanshleshit karne tathaa sahaayak anukram pradaan karne se sambhavat: sambandhit he
 The function in the 'speech pane' is centered on the sub-terms for the defined vocabulary and expresses the latest prevalent form of the words from the standard terminology
 agar anterrashtriya paribhaashik-shabdaawalee kaa sthapana ho jaay or prayog hetu apanaaya jaay to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hogi
 General ideas are presented by Adco in 'A Nanna Plaque'
 dow ranganathan ne mishrit a nan tantra kiruparekha atyaadhik aatithy pradaa na karne hetu prayukt kii
 He included many tips to provide utmost hospitality to new ideas and to break the persistence of non-violence
 ye `khand yukti',` rikti yukti', `rikt an k', `shoonyakaaran-a k ', tathaa `shunya-shunya kaarak a k', naye-naye vichaaron kaa bahirveshit tathaa antarveshit karne ke liye prayukt kiya
 In spite of all this, he gave more tips to get a lot of hospitality, they are: mass device, alphabetical device, chronological device, common device, common aspect device, decimal fraction device, calculative device, environment device, key device, geographical device Devices, group unclass devices, mixed base devices, numerical devices, observational devices, memory-assisted table containing devices, etc
 
 unhone a nan ke liye parivartansheel shakti pradutt sanyojak chinhon kaa prayog kiya, jo baad main sanketak ank ke naam se jane gayi
 They also make it easy to use computers
 sanketak ank, vibhinn talikaon se liye gayi upmukhon, ko jodakar anek prakaar ke sanyukt evam mishrit vishyon kaa nirmaan karne main bolt va nat kii tarah kaary karte hai
 Dr
 Ranganathan incorporated an organized set of notations, sub-letters and principles to give a direction to the classification masters and classifiers
 ye siddhanth, abhidharana va upasutra, pralekhan shodh evam prashikshan kendron bharat ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ke granthalayon evam granthalay vigyaan ke vibhaagon main pathan pathan vaastavik granthalay vargeekaran ke dauraan parakhe ja chuke hai
 In the third edition of Dr
 Ranganathan's 'prolegomena to Library Classification', 11 normative principles, 40 sub-letters, 13 postulates, 4 principles are given for the mouth sequence and 18 principles for the auxiliary sequence
 unhone mulmukh, upmukh, tathaa spacintres, kaa vichaar diya
 These sub-faces are divided into five fundamental categories: personality, element, energy, place, and time

 Dr
 Ranganathan had designed the classification system for many subjects, based on theoretical development
 lagbhag 150 aise vishay hai, jinkeliye dvibindu vargeekaran ke aadhaar par gahan talikaay taiyaar kiye ja chuke hai
 His article on taxonomy in 'annals for Library Signs and Documentation and Library Signs' is sufficiently helpful in solving difficult problems related to deep classification
 hamaare vichaar se dow ranganathan ko bhavishya main dwi-bindu vargeekaran ke liye nahin, apitu iske aadharbhoot siddhanton ke liye yaad kiya jaavega
 Listing Library is that branch of science which is a recent witness to many revolutionary changes and developments

 Market segmentation is a concept of economics and marketing
 bazaar kshetra, bazaar kaa ek up khand he, jo aise logon yaa sanghathanon se mil kar bana he, jo ek yaa adhik lakshan saajha karte hai, jo samroop utpaada or / yaa mulya yaa kaary jaise un utpaadon ke gunon par aadhaarit sevaaon kii maang kaa kaaran banate hai
 a true market area meets all of the following criteria: it differs from other regions, it is homogeneous within the segment; It reacts equally to market incentives and can be reached through market intervention
 is shabd kaa istemaal tab bhi kiya jaataa he, jab samaan utpaada or / yaa seva vaale upabhoktaaon ko samoohon main baanta jaataa he taaki unase alag rashiyaan praapt kii jaaen
 mote taur par inhen ek hi vichaar ke 'sakaaratmak' or 'nakaaratmak' anuprayog ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan bazaar ko chote samoohon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Although theoretically 'ideal' market areas may exist, each organization actually working in the market can develop market segments in different ways and develop product differentiation strategies to take advantage of these areas
 bazaar vibhaajan or sangat utpaada vishishtikaran ranneeti farm ko asthai vanijyik laabh de sakati he
 Market segmentation is the division of the market into groups of individual markets with similar needs or requirements, which the company divides the market into separate groups that have different needs, needs, behaviors or who want different products and services
 mote taur par, bazaar ko saamaanya mandandon ke anusaar vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, jaise udyog dwaara yaa saarvajanik banaam nijee aadhaar par, haalanki upabhokta bazaar vibhaajan se audyogic bazaar vibhaajan kaafii alag he, par donon ke uddeshy ekasmaan hai
 All these methods of division are representative of real division, which is not always compatible with convenient demographic boundaries
 upabhokta-aadhaarit bazaar vibhaajan, utpaada vishesh ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he, taaki vishisht utpaadon or vyaktiyon ke bich qareebi talmail bitha saken
 tathaapi, asankhya saamaanya bazaar kshetra pranaliyaan bhi maujuud hai, jaise nilsan cleritas PRIZM pranali, gharelu or bhu-janasankhyikeey data ke sankhyikeey vishleshan ke aadhaar par, sanyukt rajya america kii aabaadi kaa ek vyapak vibhaajan pradaan karti he
 The process of segmentation is different from targeting and positioning
 samgr uddeshy ekasmaan graahakon or sambhavit graahakon ke samoohon kii pahchaan karnaa he; taaki samoohon ko lakshith karne ke liye praathamikta nirdhaarit kar saken; unke vyavhaar ko samaj saken; or uchit vipanan ranneeti ke saath pratikriya karen, taaki chaynit prayek kshetra kii vibhinn variyataon ko santusht kar saken

 As soon as the market area is identified and targeted, the position of the sector is then determined
 sthiti nirdhaaran main yah pataa lagaana shaamil he ki upabhokta apane man main kisi utpaada yaa company ke bare main kya sochate hai
 This part of the segmentation process involves creating a perceptual map that highlights the perceived quality and price of rival goods within the same industry

 udhaaharan ke liye, credit card udyog main graahak dwaara apane card ke zarie kharch main kami ke madhyam se yah sanket mil saktaa he
 Tag # 2: Is this customer retaining? The squeeze of this determination is whether the post-retention profit from the customer is likely to outweigh the cost of retaining the customer
 tag # 3: is graahak ko banaae rakhane ke liye kis pratidhaaran ranneeti kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie? un graahakon ke maamle main, jinhen "bachaae rakhane-yogya" mana jaataa he, company ke liye yah pataa lagaana aavashyak he ki bachaane kii koun-si ranneeti ke adhik safal hone kii sambhaavna he
 Strategies typically range from "special" customer discounts, to the dispatch of information that reinforces the value proposition of the service provided to customers
 graahakon par tag lagane kaa mul drushtikon he nimna sambandhi sakriy graahakon ke bare main bhavishyakathan ke liye aitihaasik data kaa upyog karnaa: The goal here is to match active retention customers with similar attributes from historical retention data

 From a technical perspective, the segmentation process is typically performed using a combination of predictive analytics and mass analysis

 These benefits can be increased even further if the market is split by charging different prices for different regions, where more prices are to be recovered from those areas which are ready for it and are able to pay higher prices and Recovery of low prices from those whose demand is dependent on price elasticity

 Examples of this exist in the transportation industry, where business class customers who are able to pay a higher price can be charged a higher price than customers in the affordable class for the same service

 yahova yahudee dharm main or ibrani bhashaa main parameshwar kaa naam he
 The Jews believe that God first pronounced this name to Hazrat Musa
 ye shabd isaiyon or yahudiyon ke dharmagranth bible ke puraane niyam main kai baar aata he
 Note that Hebrew scripts can be written only in the Hebrew script and only consonant vowels can not be written
 so ye shabd chaar vyanjanon se bana hua he : י ה ו ה, yaa יהוה yani ki ya-ha-va-ha
 In this, people insert different vowels and give it different pronunciation, like Jehovah, Yahweh, Yahweh, Jehova, etc
 yahudi log bekaar main ishwar kaa naam lenaa paap maanate the, isaliye is shabd ko kam hi bolaa jaataa tha
 The more popular word was "adonai"
 bible ke puraane niyam / ibrani shastro main "el" or "elohim" shabd bhi parameshwar ke liye prayukt hue hai, par hairat kii baat ye he ki yahudee kehete hai ki wo ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, par "elohim" shabd vahuvachan he !yahova hi allaah he
 Isa 45:18, concludes the Sahi meaning of Hama Parmeshwar

 Vedas are considered to be the basis of Indian culture
 veda dharmik granth hi nahin he balki vigyaan kii pehali pustak he jisamen chikitsa vigyaan, bhautik, vigyaan, rasayan or khagol vigyaan kaa bhi vistrut varnan miltaa he
 Indian astrology is also born of Veda
 veda se janm lene ke kaaran ise vaidic jyotish ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Definition of vedic astrology vaidic jyotish ko paribhaashit kiya jaae to kahenge ki vaidic jyotish aisa vigyaan yaa shaastra he jo akaash mandal main vicharne vaale grahon jaise surya, chandra, mangal, budh ke saath raashiyon evam nakshatron kaa adhyayan karata he or in akashiya tatwon se prithvi evam prithvi par rahane vaale log kis prakaar prabhavit hote hai unka vishleshan karata he
 In Vedic astrology, zodiac, navagraha, birth sign are seen as important elements in the order of calculation
 raashi or raashichakr To understand the zodiac and the zodiac, it is necessary to understand the nakshatras because the zodiac signs are created from the nakshatras
 vaidic jyotish main raashi or [[raashichakr[[ nirdhaaran ke liye 360 degree kaa ek aabhaashiya path nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 The groups of stars falling in this path are divided into 27 parts
 prayek tara samooh nakshatra kehalaate hai
 The total number of constellations is 27
 27 nakshatro ko 360 degree ke aabhaashiya path par vibhajit karne se prayek bhaag 13 degree 20 minute kaa hota he
 In this way each constellation is of 13 degrees 20 minutes
 vaidic jyotish main raashio ko 360 degree ko 12 bhaago main baanta gaya he jise bhachakra kehete hai
 There are a total of 12 zodiac signs in the cycle
 raashichakr main prayek raashi 30 degree hoti he
 Ashwini is the first constellation in the zodiac, hence it is considered as the first star
 iske baad he bharni phir kritika is prakaar kramvaar 27 nakshatra aate hai
 The first two nakshatras are Ashwini and Bharani, from which the first zodiac, Aries, is formed, in this sequence, the remaining constellations also create zodiac signs
 navagraha In Vedic astrology Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Guru, Venus, Saturn and Rahu Ketu are recognized as [[navagraha []
 sabhi grah apane gochar me bhraman karte hue raashichakr main kuch samay ke liye thaharte hai or apana apana rashifal pradaan karte hai
 Rahu and Ketu are interstellar planets, they do not have real existence in the constellation
 ye donon rashimandal main ganitiya bindu ke rup main sthit hote hai
 Ascendant and Birth sign prithvi apane aksh par 24 ghante main ek baar pashchim se purab gumti he
 For this reason, all the planetary constellations and zodiac signs appear to be moving from east to west once in 24 hours
 is prakriya main sabhi rashiyaan or taare 24 ghante main ek baar purvi kshitij par udit or pashchimi kshitij par ast hote hue nazar aate hai
 This is the reason why a certain amount in the zodiac sign rises on the eastern horizon at a certain point and time
 jab koi vyakti janm letaa he us samay us akshansh or deshaantar main jo raashi purv disha main udit hoti he vah raashi vyakti kaa janm lagn kehalaata he
 The zodiac sign in which the moon sits at the time of birth is known as the birth sign or the lunar lagna
 jeevashastra main ardhasutrivibhaajan ) rinatmak vibhaajan kii ek prakriya he jisamen prayek koshika main maujuud chromosomon kii sankhya aadhi ho jaati he
 Meiosis in animals always results in the formation of gametes, while in other organisms it can produce spores
 sutrivibhaajan kii tarah hi, ardhasutrivibhaajan ke shuru hone ke pehle moulik koshika kaa diene koshika-chakra ke S-pravastha main doharaa ho jaataa he
 These double chromosomes break into four haploid gametes or spores by two cell divisions
 ardhasutrivibhaajan langik prajnan ke liye aavashyak hota he or isaliye yah sabhi eucaryociton main hota he
 Some eukaryotes, especially beadloid rotifers, do not have the ability to meiosis and reproduce by parthenogenesis
 aarkia yaa bacteria main ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota or ve binary vikhandan jaisi langik prakriyaaon dwaara prajnan karte hai
 At the time of meiosis, the genome of a diploid germ cell, which is composed of long segments of DNA filled in chromosomes, consists of DNA repeats and then two rounds of division, producing four haploid cells
 inamen se prayek koshika main moulik koshika ke chromosomon kaa ek sampurna set yaa uski jin-saamagree kaa aadha bhaag hota he
 If meiosis occurs from gametes, these cells combine at conception to form a new diploid cell or ligand before any other development
 is prakaar ardhasutrivibhaajan kii vibhaajan kii prakriya garbhaadhan ke samay do jeenomon ke sanyog ke prati hone vaali anyonya prakriya hoti he
 Since the chromosomes of each parent are homologous recombinations during meiosis, the DNA of each gamete and each zygote contains a unique symbolic framework
 ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan, dono milakar eucaryociton main langikta kaa pradurbhaav karte hai or janasamudaayon main vishisht jinagunon vaale vyaktiyon kii utpatti karte hai
 In all plants and many protists, meiosis results in the formation of haploid cells called spores that can divide asexually without conception
 in samoohon main yugmak sutrivibhaajan dwaara utpann hote hai
 Meiosis uses many of the same biochemical methods used in mitosis to redistribute chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kii anek anuthi visheshtaayen hoti hai, jinamein samadharmi chromosomon kaa jodikaran or punahsanyog sabase mahatvapurn he
 The root of the word meiosis is meyo, which means less or less
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kii khoj 1876 main prakhyat german jeevvaigyanik askar hartwig ne samudri saahi ke andon main kii or pehali baar uskaa vivaran diya
 The Belgian biologist Edward Van Beneden again described it at the level of chromosomes in the eggs of Ascaris in 1883
 prajnan or anuvanshikta main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke mahatv ke bare main sabase pehle 1890 main german jeevvaigyanik august villman ne bataaya, jinhone kaha ki yadi chromosomon kii sankhya ko banaae rakhana ho to ek dwiguneet koshika ko chaar agunit koshikaon main parivartit karne ke liye do koshika vibhaajanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In 1911, American genealogist Thomas Hunt Morgan observed crossover in meiosis of Drosophilia melanogaster and provided the first genetic evidence that genes are transmitted on chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kaa pradurbhaav 1
4 billian varshon purv hua, aisa mana jaataa he
 Only all organisms in a supergroup of eukaryotes called exkaveta do not have meiosis
 anya paanchon mukhya supergrupon, apisthokant, amibazoa, riveeria, arkiplastida or krockelviyoleton main sabhi main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii jine saarvbhaumik rup se maujuud rahati hai, chaahe ve hameshaa sakriy na hoti hon
 kuch exceveta jatiyon main bhi ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he jisase is anumaan ko samarthan miltaa he ki yah ek pracheen, paraphilatic shrenee kaa samooh he
 An example of a eukaryotic organism that does not have meiosis is euglenide
 eukarotic jivan chakron ke langik prajnan ke samay ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he, jisamen ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan kii lagaataar chakree prakriya hoti rahati he
 This continues simultaneously with normal mitosis
 bahukoshiya jeevon main dwiguneet se agunit main parivartankaal ke bich ek madhyasth paaydaan hoti he jahaan jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 The organism then produces germ cells that continue throughout the life cycle
 shesh koshikaayen, jinhen daihik koshikaayen kaha jaataa he, jeev ke bheetar kaary karti hai or uske saath marati he
 The haploid and diploid conditions are repeated alternately due to the cycle of meiosis and conception
 jivan-chakra kii jaivik avasthaa dwiguneet dasha, agunit dasha, yaa dono main ho sakati he
 In this way, there are three types of life-cycles that use sexual reproduction, according to the place of biological conditions
 yugmak jivan-chakra main, jo manushyon main bhi hota he, jati dwiguneet hoti he or yugmaj naamak dwiguneet koshika se viksit hoti he
 The diploid germ-line stem cells of the organism form haploid gametes by meiosis that combine to form zygotes
 dwiguneet yugmaj kaa sutrivibhaajan dwaara anek baar koshika-vibhaajan hokar jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 Mitosis is a process related to meiosis that creates two cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell
 saamaanya siddhant yah he ki sutrivibhaajan se daihik koshikaayen or ardhasutrivibhaajan se janan koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 In the zygotic life cycle, the species is haploid, resulting from the proliferation and differentiation of a single haploid cell called the zygote
 bhinn lingon ke do jeev apni agunit janan koshikaayen pradaan karke ek dwiguneet yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 This zygote immediately undergoes meiosis, from which four haploid cells are produced
 ye koshikaayen sutrivibhaajan dwaara jeev kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Many fungi and protozoa are members of the zygotic life cycle
 bijaanu jivan-chakra main, jeev main agunit or dwiguneet dashaaen baari-baari se hoti hai
 Therefore, this cycle is also called the alternation of generations
 dwiguneet jeev kii janan-rekha koshikaon kaa ardhasutrivibhaajan hokar bijaanuon kii utpatti hoti he
 These spores grow by mitosis and develop into a haploid organism
 phir agunit jeev kii janan koshikaayen anya agunit jeev kii koshikaon se sanyukt hokar yugmaj kaa nirmaan karti hai
 The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and proliferation to develop a diploid organism again
 bijaanu jivan-chakra ko yugmak or yugmaj jivan-chakron kaa sangyojan kaha ja saktaa hai
 Since meiosis is a 'one-way' process, it cannot be assumed to be converged in the cell cycle like mitosis
 lekin ardhasutrivibhaajan ke pehle uski taiyaari ke sopanon ke prakaar or naam sutrivibhaajak koshika chakra ke interfez ke samaan hi hote hai
 There are three stages of interfaces - interfez ke baad ardhasutrivibhaajan i or phir ardhasutrivibhaajan II hota he
 In meiosis I, pairs of homologous chromosomes made up of two sister chromatids are separated and converted into two cells
 prayek kanya koshika main chromosomon kii ek sampurna agunit maatra hoti he; pehla ardhasutrivibhaajan moulik koshika kii gunitha ko 2 ke gunak se gata detaa he
 In meiosis II, the sibling strands of each chromosome are separated and individual chromatids break up into haploid female cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i se utpann do koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan II ke samay vibhajit hoti hai, jisase 4 agunit kanya koshikaon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Meiosis i and II are divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, with the same meaning as those in the synapses of the mitosis cell cycle
 isaliye, ardhasutrivibhaajan main ardhasutrivibhaajan i or ardhasutrivibhaajan II kii avasthaaen shaamil hoti he
 Meiosis produces genetic diversity in two ways, independent alignments and then the separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes at the time of first meiosis, leading to the infinite and free choice of each chromosome segregates in each gametes and homologous chromosomal regions by homologous recombination in prophase I
 Transitioning within chromosomes via physical exchange Form new combinations of NA
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i samarupi chromosomon kaa pruthakkikaran karke do agunit koshikaon kaa nirmaan karata he, isaliye ise rinatmak vibhaajan kaha jaataa he
 a regular diploid human cell has 46 chromosomes and is considered 2N because it contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes
 lekin ardhasutrivibhaajan i ke baad, haalanki koshika main 46 chromated hota hai, phir bhi use 23 chromosomayukt n mana jaataa he
 This occurs because later in anaphase I, the pair remain together when the protagonist draws the chromatids toward the poles of the new cell
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II main sutrivibhaajan ke samaan samikarni vibhaajan hota he, jisase sahodara chromated antat vibhajit ho jate hai or pehle vibhaajan se utpann prati kanya koshika se kul 4 agunit koshikaon kii utpatti hoti he
 In prophase I, DNA is exchanged between homologous chromosomes by a process called homologous recombination
 isse akasar chromosomiy crassovar hota he
 New combinations of DNA formed at the time of crossover are important sources of genetic changes and can generate new profitable combinations of alleles
 yugal or dohare chromosome baiwalent yaa tetrod kehalaate hai, jinamein do chromosome or chaar chromated hote hai, har mata-pita se ek chromosome praapt hota he
 At this stage, crossover of Asaadhara chromatids can occur at points called kyazma
 profez i kii pehali dasha leptotin dasha he, jise leptonima bhi kaha jaataa he
 At this stage, the chromosome alone condenses into longer parts within the nucleus
 parantu dono sahodara chromated abhi bhi itane balpurvak bandhe hota hai ki unhen ek duusare se alag nahin pahachaanaa ja saktaa
 In the zygotene condition, also known as zygonima, the chromosomes accumulate in a nearby line in the form of homologous chromosome pairs
 ise guladasta dasha kaha jaataa he, kyonki tilomir iske sadrush kendrak ke ek sire par ekatrit ho jate hai
 In this case, homologous chromosomes are ubiquitinated
 packitine dasha main, jise packinima bhi kehete hai, nimna chromosomiy crossover hote hai
 Non-homologous chromatids of homologous chromosomes randomly exchange parts of genetic information over homologous regions
 kintu langik chromosome puri tarah se ek samaan nahin hote hai or samaroopita ke chote se kshetra par hi jaankaree kaa vinimay karte hai
 The exchange takes place at places where recombination bales are formed
 asahodara chromatidon ke bich jaankaree kaa vinimay hone se jaankaree kaa punahsangyojan hota he; prayek chromosome main jaankaree kaa vahi purna set dota he, jo uske paas pehle tha or is prakriya ke kaaran koi trutiyaan nahin hotin
 chunki syneptonimal complex main chromosomon ko nahin pahachaanaa ja saktaa he, isaliye cross-over ko vaastavik rup se microscope se nahin dekha ja saktaa
 In the diplotene condition, also known as diplonema, the Greek word, ie - 'two threads') the synaptonymal complex is degraded and homologous chromosomes are slightly distant from each other
 chromosome swayan bhi kuch khul jate hai jisase diene kaa kuch pratilekhan ho jaataa he
 However, the homologous chromosomes of each bivalent are forcefully bound to the regions of crossingover, kismata
 kiyasmata anaafez i main pruthak hone tak chromosomon par bane rahete hai
 All the ovaries developing in human embryonic ovulation develop up to this stage and develop before birth
 yah nilambit avasthaa dictotine dasha kehalaati he or yah yauvanarambh tak aise hi rahati he
 In males, only spermatozoa remain until the onset of meiosis at puberty
 dyakainosis avasthaa main, jiskaa greek main arth ‘sthanantaran’ hota he, chromosome or sanghanit hote hai
 This meiosis is actually the first point where the four parts of the tetrads are visible
 paar uljhaana ek saath, prabhavi rup se ativyapee kii citen, chiasmata spasht rup se dikhaai bana rahi he
 Except this, the rest of this condition is exactly the same as prometaphase of mitosis, the subcenters disappear, the centripetal membrane changes into vesicles and the meiosis begins to form
 in dashaon main, pashu koshikaon ke tarak kendrakon kii jodiyukt do tarak kaay koshika ke dono dhruvon kii ore visthapit ho jate hai
 These asterisks that were replicated in the S-phase serve as microtubule organization centers centralizing the microtubules, which are actually cellular ropes and poles
 sookshmanalikaayen kendrak kshetra main kendrak aavaran ke nasht hone ke baad akraman karti hai or chromosomon ko gunasutrabindu se jodti hai
 The chromosome acts like a motor — it pulls the chromosomes along the attached microtubules toward the asteroid, like a train on track
 prayek tetrod main chaar gunasutrabindu hote hai, lekin prayek sahodara chromated par gunasutrabinduon kii jodi kaa sangyojan ho jaataa he or ardhasutrivibhaajanali ke samay ek ikai kii tarah kaam karata he
 Microtubules attached to chromosomes are called chromosomal microtubules
 anya sookshmanalikaayen vipakshi tarak kaay kii sookshmanalikaaon se antahkriya karti hai; inhen agunasutri sookshmanalikaayen yaa dhruviya sookshmanalikaayen kaha jaataa he
 a third type of microtubules, the asteroid microtubules, travels from the asteroid to the organism or contacts the membrane-skeletal parts
 samarupi jode metafez plate ke saath-saath chalate hai
 As the chromosomal microtubules emanating from both asterisks attach to their respective chromosomes, the homologous chromosomes are arranged by cutting the sphere in a Mediterranean plane due to the constant opposing forces exerted on the bivalents by the microtubules originating from both chromosomes
 Huh
 chromosomon ke swatantra vinyas kaa bhautik aadhaar samaan bumadhyarekha ke saath anya bivolenton ke prati prayek bivalent kaa metafez plate par betaratib anusthaapan he
 The microtubule microtubules shorten and separate from the recombination genes and separate homologous chromosomes
 chunki har chromosome main gunasutribinduon kii ek hi sakriy jodi hoti he, saare chromosome vipakshi dhruvon kii ore khinch jate hai, jisase do agunit set ban jate hai
 Each chromosome still contains a pair of sibling chromatids
 agunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen lambii hokar tarak kaayon ko dur dhakelti hai
 The cell begins to elongate in preparation for division down the center
 antim ardhasutrivibhaajan prabhavakaari rup se chromosomon ke dhruvon par pahunchane ke saath samaapt ho jaataa he
 Now every daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes but every chromosome has a pair of chromatids
 tarku ke jaal ko banane vaali sookshmanalikaayen gaayab ho jaati hai or har agunit set ko ek nai kendrak jhilli ghere rahati he
 Chromosomes openly convert to chromatin again
 pashukoshikaon main koshika jhilli kaa hraas yaa vanaspati koshikaon main koshika-bhitti kaa nirmaan hota he, jise cytocinosis kehete hai or iske saath hi do putree koshikaon kii utpatti kaa kaary puraa ho jaataa he
 The sibling chromatids remain attached at the time of telophase 1
 koshikaayen vishram kii avasthaa yani interkinosis yaa interfez II main pravisht ho sakati hai
 DNA does not repeat at this stage
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II is prakriya kaa doosraa charan he
 Most of this process is similar to mitosis
 iske ant main ardhasutrivibhaajan i main utpann do agunit koshikaon se 4 agunit koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 There are four main steps of meiosis II - prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II and telophase II
 profez II main upakendrak or kendrik aavaran dono antardhan ho jate hai or saath hi chromated chote or sthool ho jate hai
 The asteroids move towards the polar regions and arrange the fibers of the sphere for the second meiosis
 metafez II main, centromearon main do gunasutrabindu hote hai jo tarak kaayon ke tarku reshon se prayek dhruv par sanlagn ho jate hai
 The new terrestrial metaphase plate rotates at 90 ° from the previous plate compared to meiosis I
 iske baad anaafez II hota he, jisamen centromear vidalit ho jate hai, jisase gunsutri vinduon se judi sookshmanalikaayen sahodara chromatidon ko alag khinchne lagati hai
 The sister chromatids moving towards the opposing poles are now called sibling chromosomes
 yah prakriya tilofez II, jo tilofez i ke samaan hoti he, ke saath samaapt ho jaati he or isamen chromosome khulkar lambey ho jate hai tathaa tarku gaayab ho jaataa he
 The nucleus re-forms and divides or cell-wall formation eventually produces a total of four daughter cells, each containing a haploid set of chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan ab purna ho jaataa he or chaar nai putree koshikaayen utpann ho jaati hai
 Meiosis facilitates stable sexual reproduction
 guneet yaa chromosomon ko aadha kiye bina garbhaadhan hone par aise yugmaj utpann hote hai jinamein chromosomon kii sankhya pichhali peedi ke yugmajon se duguni hoti he
 In successive generations, the number of chromosomes will increase drastically
 Commonly occurring diploid organisms cause acute growth disorders due to multiplicity, ie the presence of three or more chromosome sets
 Multiplicity is not tolerated in most animal species
 But plants generally produce fertile, viable multiples
 vanaspati jatikaran main bahugunitha ko mahatvapurn prakriya mana gaya he
 The recombination and independent configuration of homologous chromosomes is due to greater diversity of genotypes in the public
 isse yugmakon main jeneey vividhta aati he, jisase santati main jeneey or phinotypic vividhta ko badhaava miltaa he
 The normal dissociation of chromosomes in meiosis 1 or the separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II is called dysfunction
 jab pruthakkikaran saamaanya nahin hota, to ise nondisjunkshan kehete hai
 This results in the formation of gametes that have a high or very low number of specific chromosomes and are the simple process of trisomy or monosomy
 nondisjunkshan ardhasutrivibhaajan i yaa ardhasutrivibhaajan II, koshikeey prajnan kii avasthaaon main, yaa sutrivibhaajan ke samay ho saktaa he
 It is the cause of many diseases occurring in humans: maadaa main dimbanuprasujan naamak koshikaon main ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he
 Each oocyte that initiates meiosis, splits twice to produce a single ovum and two polar bodies
 kintu, in vibhaajanon ke hone ke pehle, ye koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan i kii diplotine dasha par thahar jaati hai or ek coop naamak daihik koshikaon ke rakshaatmak aavaran ke bheetar prasupt ho jaati hai
 These follicles begin to develop at a steady pace through a process called folliculogenesis, and some of them enter the menstrual cycle
 ritusravit dimbjan ardhasutrivibhaajan i jari rakhte hai or garbhaadhan hone tak ardhasutrivibhaajan II par tehre rahete hai
 In females, the process of meiosis occurs at the time of ovulation and differs from the typical meiosis because meiosis lasts for a long time in the dictate condition and is deprived of asterisks
 naron main, ardhasutrivibhaajan shukranujan naamak purvagami koshikaon main hota he, jo do baar vibhajit hokar shukranu main badal jaati hai
 These cells divide continuously without stopping in the seminiferous tubules of the testes
 veery ek sthir gati se utpann hota jaataa he
 The process of meiosis in males occurs during spermatogenesis
 maadaa stanpayiyon main ardhasutrivibhaajan bhrun main praathmik janan koshikaon ke andashay main pahanchane ke turant baad shuru ho jaataa he
 But meiosis in males begins at puberty after several years
 angadh gurde se praapt retinoik acid andashay ke dimbanuprasujan main ardhasutrivibhaajan ko uttejit karata he
 The tissues of the male testes prevent meiosis from occurring by neutralizing retinoic acid
 is par kaabo tab paaya jaataa he, jab yauvanarambh ke samay veeryajanak nalikaaon kii certoli koshikaayen swayan retinoik acid kaa utpaadan shuru kar detii hai
 Sensitivity to retinoic acid is also adjusted by proteins called nanos and DAZL

 vayejar dwitiya ek amareeki maanav rahit antargrahiy shodh yaan tha jise vayejar 1 se pehle 20 agast 1977 ko amareeki antariksh agency nasa dwaara prakshepit kiya gaya tha
 It was very similar to its predecessor, Vyzer 1, but its journey path is somewhat different from that
 ise dhimaa rakhane kaa kaaran tha iskaa path urenus or nepchun tak pahunchane ke liye anukool bananaa
 When Saturn came in its path, due to its gravity, it had moved towards Uranus and due to this, it could not observe Jupiter's moon Titan in the same way as Vyjar 1
 kintu phir bhi yah urenus or neptun tak pahunchane vaala pratham yaan tha
 In its journey, a special planetary situation was taken advantage of, in which all the planets come in a simple line
 yah vishesh sthiti prayek 176 varsh pashchaat hi aati he

 These are pharmacologically induced and are accompanied by rhinoplasty, analgesia, loss of reflexes, skeletal muscle response or reduced stress response or follow-all
 yah rogiyon ko tanaav tathaa dard mahasoos kiye bina shalyakriya se guzarane kii anumati detii he
 An alternative definition is "lack of reflex awareness" which is the complete lack of awareness, or lack of consciousness in any part of the body, such as consciousness in the spine
 The term anesthesia was coined in the year 1846 by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr
 sangyaaharan ke prakaaron main sthaneey sangyaaharan, kshetreey sangyaaharan, saamaanya sangyaaharan or alag karanevaali sangyaaharan shaamil hai
 Local anesthesia prevents sensation within a specific location of the body such as a tooth or bladder
 Regional anesthesia surrounds a large area of the body by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses between a part of the body and the spinal cord
 kshetreey sangyaaharan ke do aksar prayukt hone vaale prakaar hai ridh sangyaaharan or epidural sangyaaharan
 saamaanya sangyaaharan mastishk ke str par samvedan, motor or tantrika sancharan ko rokte hai jiske parinamswaroop behoshee or samvedan kaa abhaav hota he
