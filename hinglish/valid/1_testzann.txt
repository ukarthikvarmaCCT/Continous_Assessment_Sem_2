 Vivekachudamani is a famous book written in the Sanskrit language by Adi Shankaracharya in which Advaita Vedanta is interpreted
 isamen brahmanishtha kaa mahatva, gyanoplabdhi kaa upaay, prashn-nirupan, atmagyaan kaa mahatva, panchpraan, aatm-nirupan, mukti kaise hogi, atmagyaan kaa fal aadi tatvagyan ke vibhinn vishyon kaa atyant sundar nirupan kiya gaya he
 It is believed that this book contains the essence of all the Vedas
 shankaracharya ne apane balykaal main hi is granth kii rachana kii thi
 It is believed that in pre-788 AD, the ethos of Sanatana Dharma began to decline in the Aryavarta and spread with hypocrisy with Vedic knowledge
 veda ke viruddh prachaar hone se bahut se sanathan dharmi log pujan aadi karmo se tathaa pitrukarmo se virakt hokar dusro ko bhi dharm se vimukt kar rahe the
 In the immediate period of time, the mood of Sanatan Dharma increased, then Adi Shankaracharya appeared in the present day famous state of India in that period
 ye balak janm se hi vilakshan tha or apni 32 varsh kii alpaaayu main hi sanskrit bhashaa main bahut se granthon kii rachana kii, bharat bhraman karke alag-alag chaar jagahon par shankaracharya matho kii sthapana kii
 Through Vivekachudamani and other texts, the Vedo rituals were reestablished
 shankaracharya ne is granth ke dwaara advait mat kaa sthaapan kiya
 The knowledge of Sanatana Dharma is in the four Vedas which are considered to be the basic basis, but Shankaracharya felt that the role of all people is not such that one can understand it and recognize the distinction of self-deprecating substances
 koi esa granth hona chahie jisamen chaaron vedo kaa saar ho, thode aksharomen sampoorn aadhyatm vidya kaa siddhant likhaa jaay jisko padhane se jansadharan ko bhi aatm-anatm kaa vivek sugam saadhy ho
 Shankaracharya composed this book with this purpose
 jin logon ko vaidic sanskrit samaj nahin aata tha unke liye bhi ye granth upyogi bana
 According to Shankaracharya's biography, whatever books he finds were written in Kashi and Badrikashram
 aadi shankaracharya ne apane 11-12 varsh kii aayu main hi sanskrit bhashaa main 250 se zyada granthon kii rachana kii thi

 This king had many queens but the king did not get a son from any queen
 santanheen hone ke kaaran raja or unki raniyaan tamaam sukh suvidhaon ke baavjood du:khee rahete the
 The king then went to penance with his queens, wishing to have children
 hajaaron varsh tak tapasya karte hue raja kii sirf hadiyaan hi shesh rah gayi parantu unki tapasya safal na rahi
 The queen then asked Goddess Anusuya the remedy
 devi ne unhen mel maas main shukla paksh kii ekadshi kaa vrath karne ke liye kaha
 Anusuya also told the queen of the fast
 rani ne tab devi anusuya ke bataaye vidhaan ke anusaar padmini ekadshi kaa vrath rakhaa
 At the end of the fast, God appeared and asked for a boon
 rani ne bhagwaan se kaha prabhu aap mujh par prasann hai to mere badale mere pati ko vardaan dijie
 The Lord then asked the king to ask for a boon
 raja ne bhagwaan se prarthana kii ki aap mujhe aisa putr pradaan karen jo sarvagun sampann ho jo teenon lokon main aadarneey ho or aapke atirikt kisi se parajeet na ho
 God said goodbye and left
 kuch samay pashchaat rani ne ek putr ko janm diya jo kaartaveery arjuna ke naam se janaa gaya
 In due course of time, this child became a very powerful king who had taken Ravana as a prisoner

 In India, there is more township of civil community in the states of Gujarat, Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh etc
 nagar samudaay ke log kalam, kadchhi or barchhi main nipun hote he esa mana jaataa he
 Ancient mention is found in Nagarkhand of Skandpuran written by Veda Vyasa about Nagro
 iske anusaar bhagwaan shiv ne uma se vivaah ke liye nagaron ko utpann kiya tha tathaa iske pashchaat prasann hokar utsav manaane ke liye inhen hatakeshwar naam kaa sthaan vardaan ke rup main diya tha
 They came to be known only on the basis of the original place of Nagar Brahman, such as the Vadangara Brahmin of Vadnagar, Visnagara of Visnagar, Prashanora of Prasinipur which now settled in Bhavnagar and other provinces of Gujarat, Krasnora of Krasnor and Shatodara of Shatapad etc
 Nagar Brahmins are known
 ek katha ke anusaar ek brahman putr krath ek baar ghoomte- ghoomte naglok ke nagatirth main pahunch gaya
 There he was confronted with Rudal, the prince of Nag Lok, in which Nag Kumar was killed
 isse naag raaj ko krodh aa gaya or usne putr kii hatya karne vaale kul kaa samul naash karne kii pratigya kar lee
 He marched to the village which is now known as Vadnagar, while Brahmin Kumar Kruth lived with his family and other family members

 Trijat asks him to worship Lord Shiva
 bahmanon ne puure man or bhakthi bhav se bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya kii
 Lord Shiva was pleased but since the serpent was also a devotee of Shiva, Shiva expressed his inability to harm the serpents but gave the Brahmins the power to escape from the venom of snakes
 brahman apane gaanv ko laut gaye or tab se inhen naa-gar kaha jane laga
 That is why the civil community is considered the most revered and holy among all Brahmins as they do not allow any evil to arise in their hearts

 In Vishnupuran it is slightly different- vaidic kaal main jo mahatv or sthaan ashvini ko praapt tha vahi puranic kaal main dhanvantari ko praapt hua
 Where Ashwini had Madhukalash in her hand, Dhanvantari got the nectar Kalash, because Vishnu protects the world, so Dhanvantari, who protects from diseases, was considered a part of Vishnu
 vishavidya ke sambandh main kashyap or takshak kaa jo samvaad mahabharat main aayaa he, vaisaa hi dhanvantari or nagdevi mansa kaa brahmavaivart puraana main aayaa he

 In order to store information in the computer, the data are kept as 0 and 1, also known as bit
 kisi soochna ko darshane ke liye 0 or 1 kii jo dwiaiami sarini yaa maanchitr taiyaar hota he use hi bitmap yaa bit aire kehete he
 In computer graphics, when a map is a rectangle, a two-dimensional image is placed by creating a bitmap
 doaiami chitra vah hote hai jisamen har ek pixel kaali yaa safed yaa phir kinhin do rangon se bhari hoti he
 The term pixmap is used to map pixels
 yahan har pixel ek se zyada rang rakh saktaa he
 In this way, more than one bit is used for each pixel, whereas the same bit is used for a pixel in a bitmap
 kuch sandarbhon main bitmap ko ek bit prati pixel va pixmap ko kai bit prati pixel ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a bitmap is a type of memory form or picture file format used to hold images
 bitmap shabd computer programing bhashaa kii shabdaawalee se niklaa he jisak matlab hota he biton kaa maanchitr 
 In typical uncompressed bitmaps, image pixels are generally stored with a color depth of 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, or 64 bits per pixel
 Pixels of 8 bits and fewer can represent either grayscale or indexed color
 An alpha channel may be stored in a separate bitmap, where it is similar to a grayscale bitmap, or in a fourth channel that, for example, converts 24-bit images to 32 bits per pixel
 The bits representing the bitmap pixels may be packed or unpacked, depending on the format or device requirements
 Depending on the color depth, a pixel in the picture will occupy at least n / 8 bytes, where n is the bit depth
 For an uncompressed, packed within rows, bitmap, such as is stored in Microsoft DIB or BMP file format, or in uncompressed TIFF format, a lower bound on storage size for a n-bit-per-pixel bitmap, in bytes, can be calculated as: In the formula above, header size and color palette size, if any, are not included
 Due to effects of row padding to align each row start to a storage unit boundary such as a word, additional bytes may be needed
 In order to share and use colored bit maps between different devices and software, Microsoft has defined a special display method to display different colors and their depths
 unhone ise upkaran mukt bitmap kaa naam diya he or in sanchikaon ke formet ko DIB yaa BMP kaa naam diya gaya he
 According to the Microsoft collaboration website ek upkaran mukt bitmap chitron ko sahejane ke liye aisa file formet he jise vibhinn rango main upkaran mukt chitron ko paribhaashit karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 The main function of DIB is to make a bitmap capable of transfer from one device to another
 isiilie ise upkaran mukt yaa divaais independent kehete hai
 DIB is an external format whereas a device dependent bitmap is a bit map object created by software in the computer
 use us computer va software par hi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 dibs are mainly transferred as BMP files
 yahan, upkaran-mukt "device independent" se taatpary file formet yaa file bhandaaran prakriya se he
 The x Window System uses a similar XBM format for black-and-white images, and XPM for color images
 Numerous other uncompressed bitmap file formats are in use, though most not widely
 For most purposes standardized compressed bitmap files such as GIF, PNG, TIFF, and JPEG are used; lossless compression in particular provides the same information as a bitmap in a smaller file size
 TIFF and JPEG have various options
 JPEG is usually lossy compression
 TIFF is usually either uncompressed, or lossless lempel-ziv-welch compressed like GIF
 PNG uses deflate lossless compression, another lempel-ziv variant
 There are also a variety of "raw" image files, which store raw bitmaps with no other information; such raw files are just bitmaps in files, often with no header or size information

 277 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of the year 277 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 277 BC, the year etc

 sanskrit, hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon main vaakya ke ant main jo viraam chihn upyog main laayaa jaataa he use purna viraam kehete hai
 It is also called 'khadi Pai' in Hindi
 devanagari lipi main iske liye chihn kaa prayog hota he
 Some people and publications also use the Roman 'full stop' in its place
 kintu yah tarksangat nahin he
 Some people consider it equivalent to manipulating the tradition and scientism of Devanagari script
 devanagari lipi kii varnmaala ko dekhne se spasht ho jaataa he ki usamen sarvatra khadi pai kaa hi bolbalaa he
 The pie found in almost every letter is either fully or partially present
 vidwaanon kaa yahaan tak mat he ki hindi kaa ek naam khadi boli isliye he kyonki isamen khadi pai sabhi jagah pai jaati he
 Hence Khadi Pai is compatible with the nature of Devanagari script
 ise hi viraam chihn ke liye prayog kiya janaa chahie
 There is one other thing in favor of khadi pie
 keval yahi ek hindi kaa apana viraam chihn he, baaki sab angreji ke hai
 Then why should he be left behind? phul stopp kaa prayog na karne ke paksh main ek thos tark yah bhi he ki hindi main 'bindi' kaa bahut adhik upyog hota he - nukta ke rup main, bahuvachan suchit karne ke liye, dashamalav chihn ke rup main, or ng jaise kuch aksharon main to vah pehle se hi vidyaman he
 In this way, in Hindi, the word Bindi is placed all over the front, back, top, bottom
 ab viraam chihn ke liye bhi uskaa upyog karne se baari gadabadi fail jaaegi
 The second is related to its appearance on the computer screen
 bahut kam pixel aakaar main bindi thik se nahin dikhaai detii he athwa uske aas-paas ke pixlon main vah villin ho jaati he
 Therefore, the dot of 'hindi', 'read', etc
 is not visible in very small type cices
 yadi ham viraam chihn ke liye bhi bindi kaa prayog karne lagen, to bahut chote tiphsison main yah pataa hi nahin chal paaegaa ki vaakya kahaan samaapt ho rahaa he

 How the human brain works places it in biology, physics, mathematics and philosophy as a burning question
 prastut aalekh main mastishk ke vibhinn sanrachanaatmak evam kriyaatmak pahaluon par charchaa kii gai he
 The study of the human brain is a broad field
 mukhyatah iskaa adhyayan tantrika vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 But research in the fields of psychology, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology and medicine has given a new direction to its study
 tantrika tantra ke sheersh par sthit yah ang sharir kii sabhi kriyaaon ko pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se niyantrit karata he
 It is complex in structural form and complex in functional form
 isaki sanrachana, kaary evam iske parsparik sambandho kaa adhyayan mukhyatah tantrikajiviki manovigyaan evam computer vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Whatever is in the entire universe is a confluence of matter and energy
 samast drishy evam adrishy inhi dono ke sanyog se ghatit hota he
 We and our brain are no exception to this
 sristi ke moolbhoot kanon ke vibhinn anupaat main sanyukt hone se parmaanu or kramshah anuon kaa nirmaan hua he
 The brain and its various parts depend on these molecules for the exchange and storage of information
 yah vishesh anu neurochemical kehalaate hai
 The brain is made up of a special type of cells called neural cells
 ye mastishk kii sanrachanaatmak evam kriyaatmak ikai hotin hai
 Their total number is more than 1 trillion
 sanrachanaatmak rup se mastishk ke teen mukhya bhaag hote hai
 Front brain, middle brain and posterior brain
 pramastishk evam diencifalon agr mastishk ke bhaag hote hai
 The medulla, pons and cerebellum are the parts of the posterior brain
 madhya mastishk evam pasch mastishk mil kar mastishk stambh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The brain column mainly controls the body's biological functions and consciousness
 pramastishk golardh pramastishk ke do samametiya bhaag hote hai or aapas main madhya main corpus callosum dwaara jude hote hai
 The part of their surface is called cerebral cortex
 mastishk ke in vibhinn bhaagon kii kriyaatmak samarupata vaali koshikaayen tantrika sanjaal kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Different networks work together to create a map
 mastishk main pratichitra ke str par sharir ke sabhi ango kaa sanrachanaatmak nirupan hota he
 The portion of the cerebral cortex is responsible for all structural representations
 yah nirupan pratipaarshvik arthath sharir samamiti ke daahine aksh kaa nirupan baayen pramastishk golardh evam baayen aksh kaa nirupan dahini ore hota he
 The deformity of the body in the picture shows its various parts and the parts represented in the brain of the organs
 mastishk main is nirupan ke chikitsakeey pramaan bhi milte hai
 When any part of the brain is affected due to injury or any other reason, then the related organ or organ system is also affected
 yah ghatana praayah pakshaaghaat ke rup main dekhne ko milti he
 Neural cells are the unit of information transport
 mukhya rup se tantrika kosha kala ke baahar or andar kii ghatnaayen hi iske liye uttardaai hotin hai
 Sodium ions exist in the soluble state inside and outside the cell
 uddipan kii sthiti main in yanon kaa sanvahan saamaanya se vichlit ho jaataa he or yah satat vichlan ek samveg main parivartit ho jaataa he
 In the presence of different stimuli, they also have integration and addition and it serves to code the stimulus
 yah samveg koshika ke ek sire se duusare sire par sanvahit hota he
 In two neural cells, momentum transmission is via neurochemicals
 do koshaaon ke sire aapas main synapse kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The neurochemical secreted from one carrier cell stimulates the other cell by ionic aberration
 is prakaar samveg kaa sancharan purna hota he
 Now the question arises that what happens as a result of all these transmission in the brain? These information is compiled and processed at different levels in the brain
 udhaaharan ke liye ham drishy parighatna ko le sakate hai
 The appearance of any scene is due to the repulsion of the rays of light falling on it
 is prayavartit prakaash kii kirane jab hamaari retina par padati hai to us drishy kaa ek ulta evam dvivimiya pratibimb banataa he ke kaaran hota he
 Mental operations are reflected in behavior and behavior arises from the mind
 manovigyaan main maansik sankriyaaon or vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The study of the mind has always been an intriguing puzzle
 sabase kathinatam to ise paribhaashit karnaa hi he
 Generally, the mind is considered to be a functional representation of the brain
 man kii teen mukhya kriyaayein hotin hai sochna, anubhav karnaa evam chaahana 
 Cognitive activities such as memory, learning, intelligence, attention, vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, etc
 are different divisions of the mind
 vaataavaran ek uddipak kaa kaary karata he evam ham ise apni gyanendriyon ke dwaara grahan karte hai
 The information that the senses bring to the brain is based on change
 udhaaharan ke liye koi nai ghatana jaise achaanak utpann aawaaj, taapmaana main parivartan, kisi vastu kaa achaanak dikhnaa ityadi
 But the events in between do not affect us
 udhaaharan ke liye kamare main radio chaalu hote samay ham isaki aawaaj ko mahasoos karte hai
 Then we get adapted to its sound
 punah radio band hote samay hamaara dhyaan udhar jaataa he kyonki dhwani kaa abhaav ho jaataa he
 Thus, the lack of response in the middle is called optical adaptation
 hamaari gyanendriyaan baahar ke bhautik or aantarik manovaigyanik vaataavaran ko paraspar jodne kaa kaary karti hai
 These correlations are studied under psychophysics
 bhautikee kii kriya-paddati or vidhi ko apana praturup maanate hue prarambh main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya ki bhautik uddipan kii kam se kam kitni maatra hamaare gyanendriyon ko prabhavit karti he
 And it was called the limit of stimulation for various senses
 yah dekha gaya he ki prabhavasimaa se kam tivrata kaa uddipan gyanendriyon ko prabhavit nahin kar paata
 In this way we see that there is a beautiful harmony in the information brought by the senses and displaying a behavior accordingly
 sangyanatmak nirupan ke liye mastishk ke vibhinn bhaag alag-alag or ek saath uttardaai hote hai
 For example, the visual field to see, the audible area to hear, the cerebellar region for motion are answerable
 kabhi-kabhi kisi vishesh dhwani ke saath kisi drishy kii sankalpana bhi saamne aati he
 This is due to the fully developed functional network of mutual correlates of different parts of the brain

 This device is suitable for both functional and structural representations of the brain
 kisi vishesh sangyanatmak kaary ke liye mastishk ke kisi ek vishesh sambandhit bhaag kii kriyasheeltaa bad jaati he or uske saath hi us bhaag main glucose evam oxygen kii khapat bhi bad jaati he
 As a result, the balance of oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin in that part is changed comparatively
 in dono anuon ke chumbakeey gun alag hote hai
 This device based on magnetic resonance represents a clear and three-dimensional reflection of the brain based on this change, in which the functional parts of the brain are clearly visible
 ek puraani kahawat he ki ek swasth sharir main ek swasth man kaa vaas hota he
 In the present times this saying has been proved absolutely right and the other side of it is equally correct
 hamaara shaareerik swasthya bahut seemaa tak hamaari maansik sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 Stress has adverse effects on health and a healthy mental state is compatible with physical health
 manotantrika pratirakshavigyaan kii samagratatmak sankalpana purnatah isi par aadhaarit he
 According to this, our mental conditions, brain, endocrine system and immune system work collectively for our health and they all work together and connect directly and indirectly
 inaki antalakriya hamaare swasthya ke rup main parilakshith hoti he
 This concept of health is not very new
 hamaare paaramparik chikitsavigyaan main shaareerik swasthya ke liye maansik shuchita par bal diya gaya he
 Pranayama and asana mentioned in yoga science have been said to be a means of keeping the mind and body healthy
 vartmaan shodh bhi is baat kii ore sanket karte hai ki yogic asana evam pranayam yadi sahi vidhi evam niyamit rup se kiye jaaen to unase bahut laabh mil saktaa he
 The development of computer in the last half-century has made it an essential part of research
 lekin mastishk ke shodh main iskaa yogadan thodaa alag he
 Our brain is compared to a computer
 yah gyaat he ki computer ke do bhaag hardware or software hote hai
 Hardware is the mechanical and visual part and software is the non-mechanical part and its mechanism is represented
 thik usee prakaar jaise mastishk ek jaivik sanrachana he or man iskaa kriyaatmak nirupan he
 Computer is primarily considered synonymous with information processing
 aisa dekha gaya he ki hamaare sangyanatmak tantra kii kriyavidhi bahut had tak ganitiya hoti he
 The mechanism of the stimulus-response mechanism described earlier is inspired by computer science
 mastishk ke is naye darshan kaa aarambh 1956 dashak main emity main hua tha
 In later years Rumelhart and mcclelland nurtured this ideology and introduced the concept of a new artificial connective network of human cognition
 yah avadharana mastishk kii sookshm shaaririki se prerit thi
 Accordingly, this network consists of several small units
 ye ikaiyaan jaivik neuron kii tarah ek duusare se judi hotin hai
 These units may have one or more levels
 vibhinn uddipano kii upasthiti main unka sankalan evam yoga bhi hota he
 In the case of activation, stimuli are assumed by the input units and coded
 vahaan se yah sakriyata praturup ke rup main network ke andar ke staron kii ikaayiyon main samaantar rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 These units perform a calculation function independently and collectively as an information resource
 ant main nirgat ikaiyaan nirgat praturup ke rup main vyavhaar pragat karti hai
 Thus we see that the combinatorial network demonstrated by Rumelhart provides a reasonable explanation of the stimulus behavior mechanism
 pichley dashakon main is disha main kai anuprayogtmak shodh hue hai
 Sejnowski and Rosenberg created a device called Nettalk in 1987 that was based on the Sayaji network
 yah angreji ke niveshi shabdon ko sambhaashan main nirupit kar saktaa tha
 Research in science and technology, especially in the fields of neuroscience and computer science, gave rise to the new concept of artificial intelligence
 kritrim buddhi se hamaara taatpary maanav dwaara viksit ek aisi rachana se he jo buddhi main maanav kii barabari kar sake
 It is a matter of deep concern whether computer can match human in mental abilities
 yah satya he ki computer kuch maamalon main maanav se zyada samunnat he
 It is far ahead in terms of memory storage capacity, accuracy and response time
 buddhi kii paribhaasha chintan, manan evam srujanaatmakataa ko dhyaan main rakh kar di jaati he
 Presently the above works have been done by the computer to a extent
 parantu yah kahana uchit nahin hoga ki kritrim buddhi apni seemaa tak viksit he
 Artificial intelligence has the most application in robot science
 deep-blue naamak ek aise hi computer ne gairi casparove ko shatranj main parajeet kiya tha
 Other applications of artificial intelligence are in medical science and astronomy
 mastishk kaa adhyayan isliye bhi mahatvapurn he ki kyonki yah prakruti kii ekmaatr rachana he jisamen prakruti ko prabhavit karne kii kshamta hoti he
 In fact, its relationship with nature is bidirectional
 arthath yah ang prakruti se prabhavit hone ke saath-saath prakruti ko prabhavit bhi karata he
 The study of the brain is interdisciplinary
 vibhinn vishyon ke vaigyanikon ne alag-alag kaary karte hue dekha ki kahin ve ek hin prashn kaa uttar khoj rahe hai
 For example, in linguistics, the origin of language and the relationship between language and thought, the physical representation of the mind in psychology, the proper interpretation of information resources in computer science, and the questions related to the physical and mental world in philosophy is a key question that "how the brain functions Does ”
 chetana ke kendra ke rup main bhi mastishk ne vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 The most fundamental question of physics is where the properties of consciousness originate
 mastishk ke sandarbh main chetana se abhipraay chaitanyata yaa anubhav se ho saktaa he
 How do we experience anything
 ish prashn kaa uttar koi saamaanya vidhyaarthee de saktaa he ki vaataavaraniya uddipan ke falswaroop hone vaali mastishk sankriyaayein hamaare saare anubhavon ke liye uttardaai hai
 What has been said is correct
 parantu yadi ham apane saare anubhavon or chetana ko aanvik sankriya ke rup main pragat kare to bhi yah prashn shesh rah jaataa he ki in achetan evam nirjeev anuon kii antalakriya ek sajiv rup kaise dhaaran kar leti he
 a possible answer may be that the developmental and collective properties of many molecules are reflected in consciousness
 lekin yadi aisa he to ek akele anu main bhi praarambhik str kii chetana honi chahie
 Ultimately, this question is still unanswered

 radhaswami mat sahit nae dharmik andolanon ke shodhakarta mark jyargansameyer ne fakir kaa saakshaatkaar liya jisane fakir ke antartam ko ujagar kiya
 This interview became part of the autobiography of Fakir
 18 navambar 1886 main gaanv panjhaal, jila hoshiyarpur, punjab, bharat main unka janm hua
 He had a poor Brahmin family and a suppressed childhood against his background and was relieved in godly devotion
 kuch der maansaahaari rahane ke baad unka pashchaatap or prarthana unhen ek daivi drishy ke dwaara daata dayaal shiv brat laal ke zarie radha swami mat main le gaye
 He initiated the fakir into the Radhaswami Mat and read a book called 'saar-vyakha' written by the founder of Radhaswami mat Shiva Dayal Singh
 fakir ne paaya ki vah pustak uske hindu vishwaason or ruchi ke vipareet thi
 The references made to many religious movements in it did not match the views of the Fakir
 tathaapi daata dayaal ji main apane drudh vishwaas ke kaaran unhone pran kiya ki ve sachche ban kar apane guru dwaara dikhaae gaye maarg kaa anusaran karenge or apana anubhav duniya ko bataa jaayenge
 unhonen daata dayaal ji ke nidhan ke baad apane anuyaayiyon ko satsang karaane kaa kaary shuru kiya or tab apana anubhoot satya logon ko bataaya ki vishwasi sadhak main prakat hone vaale drishy, rup, rang or rekhaayen vastav main maaya hoti hai, satya nahin
 fakir ne paaramparik tareeke se 'naam-daan' dena bhi band kar diya
 The fakir said that the internal experience in satsang is the name given by him to describe the higher states of knowledge
 unhone guru bane bina guru ke sabhi kartavya puure kiye
 The literature of the miraculous and divine form of fakir is found in his followers in a situation of crisis and calamity
 lekin fakir ne saarvajanik rup se aise sabhi aise chamatkaaron ko yah kah kar apane se alag kar diya ki jo hua vah logon ke vishwaas ke kaaran hua na ki fakir ke kaaran
 unhone aise sabhi anuyaayiyon ko apana satguru ghoshit kar diya, kyonki unhen guru maanane waalon ke anubhav ne hi fakir ko man, aatma or shabd ke anubhavon se aage jane ke liye vivash kar diya
 This ultimately led to his ultimate peace and his search for truth and elimination ended
