 jamini pul aise bhudamru yaa us se chaude dharti ke ansh ko kehete hai jiske zariye samudr dwaara alag kiye hue dharti ke do bade kshetron ke bich main jaanavar aa-ja saken or vriksh-paudhe fail saken
 Such ground bridges often emerge during the Ice Age because the sea level is slightly below when some part of the sea water accumulates in the ice
 iskaa ek bada udhaaharan bharat ko srilanka se jodne vaala ramsetu he
 This ice age consisted of a strip of land completely elevated above the sea level, on which animals had reached Sri Lanka from India in history and many trees and plants from India also expanded into Sri Lanka
 mana jaataa he ki aaj se lagbhag 20,000 saal pehle srilanka ke vaida adivaasiyon ke purvaj bhi isi jamini pul par chalakar bharat se srilanka paidal pahunche
 In the modern era there is 40 miles of open sea between India and Sri Lanka
 himayugon ke alaava jamini pul banane ke or bhi kaaran ho sakate hai
 Sometimes in plate tectonics, the shaking of the geological planks elevates the floor under the sea and rises above the surface and connects the two regions by forming a bridge
 kuch ilaaqon main himayugon ke dauraan chalane vaali himaniyaan itani baari hoti hai ki unke neeche kii zamin dab jaati he or himyug kii samaapti par barf pighalane ke baad waapas uth jaati he
 Sometimes the same raised earth forms a bridge in two areas

 He is credited with making the Mahabharata, one of the two Hindu epics, prevalent in mankind
 pandavon ke pautra mahabali parakshit ke putr janamejay ko vaishampayan ne ek yajna ke dauraan yah katha sunai thi
 The originator of Krishna Yajurveda is also the sage Vaishampayan, who was entrusted with this act by his guru Krishnadvaipayan
 inke shishy yajywalky rishi the jinase vaad vivaad hone ke kaaran yajyavlky ne shukla yajurveda ko prasaarit kiya| Just as the six juices of taste of tongue are famous, similarly the nine juices of taste of heart are famous
 jihva ke aswaad ko loukik anand kii koti main rakhaa gaya he kyonki uskaa sidhaa sambandh loukik vastuon se he
 The taste of the heart is considered to be in the category of supernatural bliss because its direct relation bhartiya kavyachaaryon ne rason kii sankhya praayah nau hi maani he kyonki unke mat se nau bhav hi aise hai jo manushya kii mul pravritiyon se ghanishthatya sambandhit hokar sthayitv kii puri kshamta rakhte hai or ve hi viksit hokar vastutah ras sangya kii prapti ke adhikari kahe ja sakate hai
 This recognition has also been controversial, but has accepted the nature of humor unquestioningly from all
 manovigyaan ke visheshgyon ne bhi haas ko mul pravriti ke rup main samuchit sthaan diya he or iske vishleshan main paryaapt manan chintan kiya he
 This contemplation has been given a more elaborate expression by Western poetry than Pravatya poetry, but still it cannot be said that they have studied this element in its entirety and or any such definition of the poetic expression of humor or Haas Has given which can accommodate all types of examples
 bhartiya aacharyon ne ek prakaar ke sutararup main hi iskaa prakhyapan kiya he kintu unki sankshipt uktiyon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi nishkarshon or tatwon kaa saraltapurvak antarbhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 Bharata Muni's Natyashastra for humor, says- bhavaprakash main likhaa he- The narrator's statement is- dasharupakkaar kii ukti he- This implies that Haas is a ritualistic gesture and a form of Chittavikas
 uskaa udrek vikrut aakaar, vikrut vesh, vikrut aachaar, vikrut abhidhaan, vikrut alankaar, vikrut arthvishesh, vikrut vaani, vikrut cheshtaa aadi dwaara hota he - in vikrutiyon se yukt hasyapatrata chaahe abhinayta kii ho, chaahe vaktaa kii ho, chaahe anya kisi kii ho
 Deformation means any imagery that is contrary to the expected or singular, some absurdity, which we may find loving, may not be traumatic
 in lakshanon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi lakshan samavisht ho jate hai, jahaan tak unka sambandh hasya vishyon se he
 When such a development develops, we get it in a free state, in a simplified form by Kavikaushal, or according to the terminology of Acharya Pt
 Ramachandra Shukla, it is called humorous
 haas ke bhav kaa udrek desh-kaal-paatr-saapeksh rahata he
 If there is an open body at home, the viewer will not laugh but if he reaches in the same way in the festival, then his behavior will arouse laughter because it is considered contrary or perverse than expected; His behavior will become Haas's mother
 yuva vyakti shringaar kare to fabane kii baat he kintu jarjar budde kaa shringaar haas kaa kaaran hoga; kursi se giranevaale pahalwaan par ham nishchit hi hansane lagenge parantu chat se giranevaale bachche par hamaari karunapurna sahanubhuti hi umadegi
 It has already been said that Haas is based on love and not malice, so if one is to sarcasm at the perversion of one's nature, tendency, temperament, ethics, etc
, it is not as sarcasm but as a proverb
 It will not have a feeling of burning or degrading at the bottom, but a feeling of pure purification
 sanshuddhi kii bhaavanavali yah priyokti bhi upadesh kii shabdaawalee main nahin kintu ranjanta kii shabdaawalee main hogi
 Distinctions of humor have also been considered by the Acharyas
 unhone hasya ke do bhed kiye hai
 One is Athastha and the second is Prastha
 hasyapatr kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he swat: us paatr kaa hansnaa or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansaana
 From the point of view of socials or gentle listeners, or theatrical performers, there is selfish humor without the laughter of others, they have excellent humor and poignant humor
 drushtikonon kaa yah antar samaj lene par in donon shabdon ke arthon kaa vichaar saraltapurvak samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Then, the Acharyas have made six distinctions of humor - Smit, Hissit, Visshah, Vashika, Vastha and Vashikaha; Those who do not have to be discriminated but will have to accept the distinction of Hasankriya
 sankshep main, aankhon kii muskaraahat smit he
 Seeing thirty-two sounds is beautiful, the sound that comes out is disturbed
 ang hill uthanaa avahasit he
 The stomach laughter is unheralded and the whirring whirring rib is laughable
 sahityadarpanakaar ne smit or hasith ko shreshthon ke yogya kaha he
 The depraved and the subjugated have been called worthy of the middle class people and the abducted and the oppressed are worthy of the lowly people
 rangamanch main darshakon ke liye bhi hansane kii ek maryaada honi chahie, us drushti se uttam, madhyam, adham kii yah baat bhale hi maan lee ja sakati he
 Otherwise, the laughable laughter will deprive the upper class of public health an important element only by understanding the object of inferiority
 dow ramkumar verma ne uttam, madhyam, adham ke prabhaav kii ishti se hasya ke teen bhed maane hai or inhen aatmasth, parastha se guneet karke hasan kriya ke baarah bhed likhe hai
 Smit, Hasit etc
 Hasanakriya Vriddhas can be said to have a sense of humor
 in anubhaavon kaa varnan maatr kar dena alag baat he or apni rachana dwaara saamaajikon main ye anubhav utpann kara dena alag baat he
 Comicer's successful creation is one that spontaneously produces the feel of humor
 videshi vidwaanon ke vichaar se hasya ke paanch pramukh bhed hai jinke naam hai - humar, vit, satair, irni or fars 
 Humer and Fars are related to the subject of humor, while Bit, Satire and Irony are related to the skill of utterance, in which the last two are not only gratifying but also satisfying
 parody bhi hasya kii ek vidha he jiskaa uktikaushal se sambandh he kintu jiskaa pradhan uddeshy he santushti
 Irony means mockery
 uphaas main, hamaare vichaar se, irni kaa bhi antarbhaav maan liya janaa chahie anyathaa vah hasya kii koti se baahar kii vastu ho jaaegi
 Wit or Vagvayadhyaya can be called a specific ornament
 bhartiya sahityapanditon ne jis prakaar shringaar ke saath nyaay kiya he uskaa dashamansh bhi hasya ke saath nahin kiya, yadhyapi bharat muni ne isaki utpatti shringaar se maani he arthath ise rati yaa priti kaa pariman mana he or ise shringaar ke baad hi navrason main mahatv kaa darja diya he
 It has a direct relationship with Anand and has its own specialness not only in terms of Ranjanata but also in terms of utility
 yah tan man ke tanaav dur karata he, swabhaav kii karkashta mitaatha he, aatmanirikshan or aatmaparishkar ke saath hi mithe dhang par samajasudhar kaa maarg prashast karata he, vyakti or samaaj kii thakaan dur kar unamem taazgi bharta hua janaswasthya or lokswasthya kaa upakaarak banataa he
 It is certain that the proportion of importance of this comic in Sanskrit literature and Hindi literature is lacking
 phir bhi aitihaasik simhavlokan se yah bhi spasht ho jaataa he ki sahitya main hasyaras kaa pravaah vaidic kaal se lekar aaj tak nirantar chalaa aa rahaa he, yadhyapi vartmaan kaal ke purv usein vividhta itani nahin jitani aaj dikhaai pad rahi he
 The diversity of the stream of humorous can be seen from the point of view of subject and euphemism
 vishay ko ham akruti, prakruti, paristhiti, vesh, vaani, vyavhaar or vastu main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 The absurdity of the figure is obesity, ugliness, clumsiness, mutilation, irresponsible, belly, hump, extreme blackness of women, etc
 inamen se anek vishyon par hasyaras kii rachanaayen ho chuki hai
 It is worth noting that the ridiculous subject of one time becomes the ridiculous subject of all times, it does not happen
 aaj angabhang, nirmutchta aadi hasya ke vishay nahin maane jate atev ab inpar rachanaayen karnaa hasya kii suruchi kaa parichaayak na mana jayega
 The absurdity of nature or temperament is foolishness, stupidity, hypocrisy, blush, bliss, indecent fashionedness, miserliness, pretentiousness, superfluousness, unauthorized egoism, etc
 akruti ke betukepan kii apeksha prakruti ke betukepan ko apana lakshya banaakar rachanaayen karnaa adhik prashast he
 The creators have done good satire on the practices of skirmish etc
, but many subjects have been left untouched in this direction
 paristhiti kaa betukapan he gangamdari joda samay kii chook samaaj kii asamanjasata main vyakti kii vivashtaa aadi
 a very beautiful example of this is the Kevat episode of Ramcharitmanas in which the fools who boast of understanding Rama's heart, but Panditamanya Kevat are unable to answer and in a way surrender silently
 yah paristhiti kaa vyang tha
 The absurdity of disguise has been a favorite subject of the patron nuts and clowns and can be easily given in skits, Ramlila, Raslila, "gammat", slapstick etc
 dharmadhvagiyon vesh, andhanukaran karanevaale fashanparaston kaa vesh, "mardaani aurat" kaa vesh, aise betuke vesh hai jo rachana ke vishay ho sakate hai
 The composition of the absurdity of disguise will also be of shallow status, similar to the creation of the absurdity of the figure
 vaani kaa betukapan he haklaana, baat baat par "jo he so" ke sadrush takiyakalam lagaana, shabdaskhalan karnaa, amanvi dhvaniyaan, shekhi ke pralaap, gapbaajee, panditau bhashaa, ganvaaru bhashaa, anek bhashaa ke shabdon kii khichdi, aadi
 The absurdity of behavior is confusing incidents, clumsy actions, exaggerations, character distortions, social tantrums, having some sense of something, sitting or doing things, puppetry etc
 hasyaras kii abhivyanjana ke liye, chaahe vah parihaas kii drushti se ho chaahe uphaas kii drushti se, vyavhaar kaa betukapan hi prachur saamagree pradaan kar saktaa he
 From the point of view of human beings, why humans, dev demons, birds, bedbugs, brooms, tokens, plate rationing etc
 have been successfully run on many subjects
 parantu in vastuon or visheshat: isht devon evam prashasnic vyangon ke saath majaak jahaan tak pritibhav ko lekar hoga, vahiin tak hasyaras kii koti kaa adhikari kaha jayega
 Other compositions can be reached in the category of raudra, vibhats or other juices
 abhivyanjana main pratyaashit kaa vaiparity anek prakaar se dekha or dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 It cannot be explained exactly with words like absurdity, distortion, confusion etc
 yah vah vaakkaushal he jiske liye rachanaakaar main bhi paryaapt pratibha apekshit hoti he or us rachana ke drashtaa, shrota yaa pathak main bhi
 a social who will not have the desire and hope of humor, will not have humor and humor in the nature and will not have the ability to understand the word signals and syntactic organs of the intellect, it should be understood that there is no humor for him
 isi prakaar jis kalakaar main parishkarpriyata, pratyutpannamatitv or shabd taulne kii kala nahin he vah hasyaras kaa safal lekhak nahin ho saktaa
 Successful authors with the help of unexpected verbiage, with the unexpected derivation of the word; With the help of unexpected unique analogies etc
 With the help of singular arguments; With the help of the various genres of Vagvadagdhya, namely, with the change of meaning, with the art of shifting the place of bathing in the Pratyutra; With the help of Satire "", Uddhav's utterance in Krishnayan is the building of Madhupuri, Shyam Bajai Bainu? Bhavniprasad Mishra ji’s songfarosh etc
), with the help of sarcasm; With the help of illogical vows; And many similar expressions express humor from styles
 prabhaav kii drushti se hamaari samaj main hasyaras yaa to visheshat: parihaas kii koti kaa hota he yaa uphaas kii koti kaa
 We have not limited these two words in the traditional sense
 jo santushti pradhan kavy he use ham parihaas kii koti kaa maanate hai or jo sanshuddhi pradhan he use uphaas kii koti kaa
 There is also a mixture of both in many compositions
 parihaas or uphaas donon ke liye saamaajikon kii suruchi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Fleshy ornamental taste, today's modern society cannot be interesting
 devtaa vishyak vyang sahdharmiyon ko hi hansaane ke liye hua karata he
 Suruchi's attention is very important for ridicule
 majaa isamen hi he ki hasyapatr apni trutiyaan samaj le parantu sanket denevaale kaa anugrihit bhi ho jaae or use upadeshta ke rup main na dekhe
 Without sarcasm, consider humor to be ridiculous, whether it is descriptive, whether the effect of the conversation and the effect shown by sarcasm on oneself or others, especially on others, is ridiculous
 bit, humar, parody aadi ke sahare utpann vah haas jo vishuddh santushti kii koti kaa he, parihaas hi kaha jayega
 From the point of view of humor, humor should be considered as the category of softness or that of Attas
 hasith, apasit aadi anya kotiyon kaa inhen donon main antarbhaav maan lenaa chahie
 Two can also be performed of soft-heartedness, one is the secret haas whose pleasure is taken in mind and the other is Sphut Haas whose smile can be seen by other people as well
 attahas ke bhi do bhed kiye ja sakate hai-ek he maryaadit haas jo hansanevaale kii paristhiti se niyantrit rahata he or doosraa he amaryadit haas jisamen paristhiti saapekshata kaa bhaan nahin rahata
 This interpretation of the differences of humor will probably be more scientific
 naatakon main prahasan kii vidha or vidooshak kii upasthiti ne hasya kaa srijan kiya he kintu vah bahumukhi nahin hone paaya
 Many verses of Subhashit have become good, in which both the subject and utterances have a good sense of humor
 kuch udhaaharan de dena apraasangik na hoga
 See the mockery of the relationship of the gods
 prashn tha ki shankar ji ne jehar kyon piya? kavi kaa uttar he ki apni gruhasthi kii dasha se uubakar
 The snake of Shankar ji is swinging towards Ganesha's rat, but Karthikeya's peacock is automatically stalking him
 udhar girija kaa singh ganesh ji ke gajmastak par lalachaai nigahen rakh rahaa he ore swat: girija ji bhi ganga se sautiyadah rakhti hui bhabhak rahi hai
 Poor Shankar ji, despite being able to overcome this clumsy family, so bored and drank poison
 tridev khatiya par nahin sote
 It seems that they have also become frightened by bedbugs
 damaad apni sasuraal ko kitni saar vastu mana karata he parantu phir bhi kis akadabaaji se apni puja karavaate rahane kii apeksha rakhaa karata he ya nimna shlokon main dekhie
 Both verses are poetic enough
 jitna vishleshan kiijie utana hi majaa aata jayega: Pranna be dear that life, listen to the conclusion of the poet on this- raja bhoj ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki jo nayaa shloke rachakar laaegaa use ek lakh mudraayen puraskaar main milengi parantu puraskaar kisi ko milane hi nahin paata tha kyonki use medhaavi darbari pandit nayaa shloke sunate hi duhara dete or is prakaar use purana ghoshit kar dete the
 According to the legend, Kalidas stopped speaking after reciting the following verses
 shloke main kavi ne daawa kiya he ki raja ninnanbe karod ratna dekar pita ko rinmukt karen or isapar panditon kaa sakshya le len
 If the pundits say that this claim is not known to them, then one lakh should be given for the creation of this new verse
 isamen "kaisaa chakaaya" kaa bhav badi sundarataa se sannihit he : The Veeragathakaal, Bhaktikal and Reetikal of Hindi are often the times of the poetry itself
 is lambey kaal main hasya kii rachanaayen yada kada hoti hi rahi hai parantu ve praaia: footkar dhang kii hi rachanaayen rahi hai
 Tulsidas ji's Ramacharimanas' Nardamoh episode, Shiva Vivah episode, Parashurama episode etc
 and Surdas ji's Sarsagar's Makhanchori context, uddhav-gopi-dialogue theme etc
 provide good examples of humor
 tulsidas ji kaa nimna chand, jisamen jarajarjar tapasviyon kii shringarlalasaa par mjedaar chutki lee gai he, apni chata main apurv he- Birbal's jokes, Lal Buzhakkad's hanging, Ghagh and Bhadari's epics, Girdhar Kavirai and Ganga's verses, Beni Kaviraj's Bharove and many other compositions are famous of this period
 bharatjivan press ne is kaal kii footkar hasya rachanaaon kaa kuch sankalan apane "bhadova sangrah" main prakashit kiya tha
 In this period, there have been some poignant works, especially about the theme of charity, whose interestingness can not be said even today
 udhaaharan dekhie - a suum had confessed to donating in distress
 uske liye apana vajan ghataane kii uski tarkiben dekhie - The themes of humor and their styles of expression have greatly expanded in the present period

 The main ones are drama and drama, novels and stories, and essays
 in sabhi vidhaon main hasyaras ke anukool prachur maatra main sahitya likhaa gaya or likhaa ja rahaa he
 Talented writers have also presented their comical verses in various forms of prose as well as poetry
 is yug ke praarambhik dinon ke sarvaadhik yashasvi sahityakar hai bhaaratendu babu harishchandra
 His plays are less comical, less vivid and more ridiculous
 "vaidiki hinsa hinsa na bhavati", "andher nagari" aadi unki hasya kritiyaan hai

 The Bharatendula period was followed by the Mahavirprasad Dwivedi period, which further enhanced and expanded the themes of humor and their expression systems
 naatakon main keval hasya kaa uddeshy lekar mukhya katha ke saath jo ek antarktha yaa upakatha chalaa karti thi vah dvivedikaal main praayah samaapt ho gai or hasya ke udrek ke liye vishay anivaary na rah gaya

 shah iran, madhya asia or bhartiya upmahadweep main 'raja' ke liye prayog hone vaala ek or shabd he
 It is derived from the Persian language and in Old Persian it had a form of 'kshyathiyya'
 dhyaan den ki hind-irani bhashaa-parivaar kii bahanen hone ke naate sanskrit or farsi main 'shah' liye sajaateey shabd hai
 In Sanskrit there is a verb 'kshayati' i
e
 'he reigns', from which in the old Persian language the word 'khayayathiyya' was formed from the verb
 yahi 'khshaaynteey' shabd iran ke hakhaamani samrajya ke shilalekhon main miltaa he
 Its Sanskrit homogeneous word is 'kshatri' from which 'kshatriya' is formed
 pracheen farsi main 'samrajya' ko 'kshastra' kehete the, jo sanskrit ke 'kshetra' ke baraabar he 
 In modern Persian, 'shah' of 'kshayathiyya' and 'city' of 'kshayathatra' has become
 shahar kaa matlab 'samrajya' se ghatakar 'nagar' rah gaya he haalanki ise kabhi-kabhi pracheen matlab ke saath bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he, masalan 'iran shahar' kaa matlab 'iran kaa samrajya / raashtra' he
 Note the pronunciation of the point-bearing 'kha' in the pronunciation of 'khashthatra' and the pronunciation of the 'tha' with the point-'h 'as they differ slightly from the pointless' Kh' and the pointless' Th '
 bharat main aise samraj yaa maharaja ko 'maharajaadhiraj' bulaayaa jaataa tha jiske adheen bahut se rajyon ke raja hon
 In the same way in Persian, 'shah of the Shahs' is called 'shahnah'
 hakhaamani samrajya kii puraani farsi bhashaa main iske barabari kii oopaadhi 'khshaaynteey khshaaythiyanam' thi jo bistun ke abhilekhon main dekhi gai he
 The word 'zada' in Persian means 'son' or 'kumar' and the word 'zadi' means 'daughter' or 'kumari'
 'shahzada' kaa arth 'rajkumaar' or 'shahzaadi' kaa arth 'rajkumaari' hota he
 Note that 'zada' is also a Sanskrit homogeneous word
 'falaan-zaadaa' kaa matlab he 'falaan dwaara paidaa kiya hua', masalan 'ameerzaada', 'rayjhada', 'raiszada', 'shahzada', ityadi
 In Sanskrit the word for its equality is 'jat' or 'jata' and in Hindi 'jaya', as seen in words like 'newborn'
 hindi main 'shahzada' ko 'shah kaa jaaya' kaha jayega or agar sakht sanskrit nazariye se dekha jaae to 'shahzada' sanskrit ke 'kshatriyajaat' kaa sajaateey he
 In Persian, the word 'banu' means 'woman' and 'shahbanu' means 'royal woman', a name used to mean a lot of women in the Indian subcontinent
 isi tarah iran, tajikistan or afghanistan main ek naam 'shahdokhat' miltaa he jo bharat or pakistan main prachlit nahin he
 It means 'daughter of Shah'

 pratirodh weldon main dhaatu ke do tukdon ko jodne ke liye vidyut dhara ke saath yantric daab kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Weldon electrodes have currents flowing when the two pieces being welded are joining
 weldon kii is kriya main pehle vidyut dhara dwaara dhaatuon ke ek chote se bhaag main kam se kam itani ooshmaa paidaa kii jaati he ki vahaan kaa bhaag dravit ho jaay
 After this, both the pieces are kept under pressure for some time so that the molten metal cools down and it has enough strength to stay connected with each other
 resistance weldion 
 weldon kii yah vidhi bhi takkar kii weldon vidhi ke samaan hi he, bhed keval itnaa hi he ki donon pindon ko sampark main laane ke pehle hi yantra main vidyut dhara pravaahit kar di jaati he or pindon ke nikat aane par unke bich ke antaraal main vidyut arq ke chaalu hone se dhatupind ke kinare pighalane lagate hai
 When some of the metal spills start bouncing from them, then close the current and press them and connect them with the device itself
 weldon kii yah vidhi vahi apanaai jaati he jahaan dhaatu kii chaadaron ke kinaaron ko ek par ek rakhkar jodna ho
 Its principle is also similar to that of percussion weldons
 iskaa siddhant bhi takkar ke weldon ke samaan hi he
 In this work device, the welders place the edges on top of each other, between the two electrodes in the device
 phir pair se ek liver ko dabaane par, uuparavaala electrode neeche utarkar sampidit vaayu kii shakti se un platon ko dabaa detaa he or electrodon tathaa platon ke sampark main aate hi, usamen vidyut dhara pravaahit hokar platon main se hoti hui neeche ke electrode main pravesh karti he, us samay platon kaa vah bhaag, jo un electrodon ke sampark main aata he, garam hokar jyon hi weldon ke taap par pahunchataa he, un electrodon kaa dabaav or badha diya jaataa he, jisase ve us sthaan par aapas main jud jate hai or vahaan ek chitti si pad jaati he
 The principles of this method of Weldon are also the same as those of the weld, the only difference being that the heat from the electrode is concentrated at a small point
 vaise electrodon kaa kshetrafal to kaaphi bada hota he
 To concentrate the heat, a bulge or crater is made in one or both plates
 is vidhi se vibhinn motaai ke platon ko bhi aapas main joda ja saktaa he
 This method is also similar in principle and action to Chitti Weldon, the difference being that the electrodes are made by rotating cylinders instead of being of the shape of a stationary column, and the joining plates are driven mechanically between them and the current of those cylinders Intermittently goes on spinning
 dhara ke pravaahit hone or rukne ke samay kaa anupaat 1:1 se lekar 1:10 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he, is kaaran jod aisa lagata he maano dore se si diya gaya ho
 In this method, one piece of machine is fastened by binding one piece to the first, and then in a second screw sliding the other piece
 ki donon ko nikat laane par jod sahi sahi baith jaae
 These two screws are electrically insulated from each other by the insulating currents, and the current of one current is not able to pass into the other
 jab sarkanevaale shikanje ko dhatupind sahit sthir shinkaje kii ore sarkaate hai, tab in dhatupindon ke judanevaale kinaaron kaa taap, kinaaron ke nikat aane par, vidyut dhara ke ucch pratirodh ke prabhaav se ekadam garam hone ke kaaran, weldon ke taap tak pahunch jaataa he; phir kinaaron ko dhire-dhire khub dabaa diya jaataa he or vidyut dhara band kar di jaati he
