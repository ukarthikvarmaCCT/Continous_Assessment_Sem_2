 Sandhyavandan contains quotations from the great Vedas which are recited three times a day
 ek suryoday ke dauraan, aglaa dopaher ke dauraan or suryaast ke dauraan 
 Each time it is known by a different name - morning in the morning, midday in the afternoon and evening in the evening
 shivaprasad bhattacharya ise “hinduon kii pujan paddati sambandhi samhita” ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 The word is a composite word in Sanskrit in which Sandhya means "union"
 jiskaa din or raat kii sandhi yaa milan kinwa sangam se aashay he or vandan kaa arth pujan se hota he
 Apart from morning and evening, the afternoon is considered to be the third confluence of the day
 isliye un sabhi samayon main dainik dhyaan or prarthana kii jaati he
 The word Sandhya itself is also used in the sense of daily ritual, which is meant to be performed during the beginning and end of the day
 vedon kii richaon tathaa shlokon ke aadhaar par aavahan aadi karke gayatri mantra kaa 28, 32, 54 yaa 108 baar jaap karnaa sandhyopasana kaa abhinn ang he 
 In addition to the mantra, the Sandhya ritual has some other purifying and preparatory rituals to prevent thoughts from wandering and to focus attention
 inamen se kuch main grahon or hindu panchang ke maheenon ke devataaon ko sandhyavandan na kar paane tathaa pichhali sandhya ke baad se kiye gaye paapon ke praayshchit swaroop main jal arpit kiya jaataa he
 In addition, one of the most important rituals of Sandhyavandan is worshiping Sun in the morning and Varuna in the evening as Mitra Dev
 iske alaava, brahmachariyon ke liye sandhyavandan kii samaapti par havan karnaa or samidhadaan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Other aspects of worship that are not primarily involved in Sandhyavandana include the chanting of meditation mantras and the worship of deities by worshipers
 dhyaan-yoga se sambandh ke bare main monier-williams likhte hai ki yadi ise dhyaan kii kriya mana jaae to sandhya shabd kii utpatti kaa sambandh san-dhyai san-dhyai ke saath ho saktaa he
 The evening has a special place in Hinduism because it leads to mental purification
 vaigyanik drushti se pranayam jo sandhya kaa abhinn ang he, isse kai rog samaapt ho jate hai
 In this entire world, those who have deviated from their karma, they need evening
 sandhya karne vaale paparahit ho jate hai
 The sins committed by ignorance are eliminated by treaty

 All their virtues are finished
 sarvapratham to shastrokt vidhi se snanashauchachaar kar, tilak, bhashm, pavitridharan, kushotpatan aadi karke praatah kii pehali sandhya karnaa chaiye
 Evening has been determined in the scriptures, according to which the Sandhyopasana results
 akaal kii sandhya vandhya stri jaisi hoti he
 According to the sages, the daily pact without the sun and stars is the evening
 ahoratrasya yaa sandhih suryanakshatravarjita
 Sa tu sanyasamakhya mainta munistastadarsiddhibhi: 
 And with stars in the morning, in the mid-day when the sun is in the center of the sky and in the evening before sunset, it is causal
 praatah kaa jap suryoday tak tathaa saayam kaa jap nakshatron ke udai tak kerani chaiye
 Evening can be done in front of the house, goshala, nadihat and idol of God, but its results are different in the scriptures

 The Rte

 Nikumbh tells Ishaan's parents that Ishaan is a bright child and his process of knowing is different than other children in the class
 vah un se dyslexia varnan kiya or kaha ki yah ek snaivik sthiti he jo kii mand buddhi kii nishaani nahin he
 He also told her that he would also provide additional studies that would help Ishaan succeed
 To support this statement, Nikumbh highlighted Ishan's artistic ability as a performance by his many paintings and creative works
 
in order to speak, Nikumbh asks Ishaan's father to read a box with Japanese text when Mr
 Awasthi states that he is not the text
 Can strengthen, Nikhumbh imposes reprimand him
 aisa karne main, nikhumbh unhen ishan ke saath ek dainik aadhaar par sangharsh darshata he
 When he arrives from school, one day Nikkam brings up the topic of dyslexia in class and provided a list of famous people who consider dyslexic: Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Walt Disney, Agatha Christie, Thomas Edison, Pablo Picasso and the actor Abhishek Bachchan
 As a student in class, Nikumbh asks Ishaan to stay back
 At that time, Nikumbh discovers that he is experiencing difficulties with that dyslexia
 Nikumbh also informs the Principal of this school for information about Ishaan and asks if he can act as a tutor for Ishaan
 After getting the Principal's permission, Nikumbha to teach Ishaan Developed therapeutic techniques by experts in the field of dyslexia

 Deepa Bhatia said in an interview with The Hindu that her initial motivation was not the subject of dyslexia

He was a slow novice? He was indifferent, or Was incompetent? All the questions that were coming up and we felt that the answers were not enough

" uske dimag kaa rasta kala, kaagaj or rangon ke madhyam se kaam kar rahaa tha or yah spasht tha kii uske dimag kii soch saamaanya se bahaar tha
 This was done to honor and be respected
 " In search of an actor who was to play the lead character of Ishaan, Gupte and Bhatia did Shamak Davar's Summer Fun Workshop and turned to Gupte to audition the boys for a scene in which they would informally describe that they would be doing something wrong
 Gupte called Darsheel Safari after deciding how to be absent from the school, “it was a difficult decision
 lekin darsheel kii aankhon main ishan vaali sharaarat he har koi bas swaabhaavik rup se uske prati aakarshith the " Bollywood superstars Aamir Khan and Amole Gupte first met when he was in college, where Khan praised Gupte's ability as an actor, writer, and painter, later to develop into Gupte and Bhatia Tare Zameen Par for seven years
 Dala, Khan said that he was associated for the film three years before its release, initially as a producer and actor
 But, after a period of time, Khan said that he was the director of the film due to the mutual decision between him and Gupte, Gupte's contribution to this film is very much for Khan's achievement
 nirdeshak / abhinayta ke rup main taare zamin parkhaan kaa pehla anubhav tha
 Khan said that while the transition was challenging, he always wanted to direct a film, he jumped without any preparation "he was fortunate, however, to work with a 'great troupe of children,' Especially Darsheel, Sachet and Taane Chheda
 In fact, Khan became popular with the children during filming with all 43 children of the New Age School in Panchgani
 a compassionate Aamir went to the extent of changing the style of hair
 And actually cut them as per his wish

 In concurring with this observation, psychologists Edgar Jones and psychiatrists Tony David and Nasser Ghaemi supervised the literature on the fallacy, pointing out that there has been a great deal of desire for people to find the symmetry and completeness of the definition of false illusion, false Illusions are neither necessarily static, nor is it wrong, nor are there current controllable events

 The use of "safe habits" to keep its losses out is helpful in the order of its perceptions
 manovaigyanik pranali kii bhoomika ke udhaaharan par aage aata he upachaaron kaa prabhaav jo sizophrenia ke lakshanon par hota he
 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts

 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain

 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he

 The fact that glutamate receptors are less effective means that the tests to detect the function of the frontal / forebrain and hippocampal are not accurate, and that glutamate affects the functioning of dopamine, all of these in schizophrenia
 , Which has been shown to be an important mediator in the role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia

 However, according to these studies, the average change in volume is close to the measurement range set by MRI methods, so it is naïve to determine that schizophrenia is a neurological process that is weighty when symptoms appear
 Or that it is better to consider it a process of neurological development in which an abnormal amount of brain is produced at an early age

 The author states that in schizophrenia two networks of the white matter tract may be affected, which is likely to 'break down' the gray matter regions to which they are attached

 However, in the context of the side effects of psychiatric obstructive treatment, the treatment of those who have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, especially in those with symptoms of dysfiguring tardive dyskinesia, and in rare but far more lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome
 The most commonly used health safeguards for the prevention of schizophrenia have taken the form of public awareness campaigns informing about the risks and early symptoms, aimed at detecting the disease and giving early treatment to those who delay treatment
 To be improved

 The response to the drug is different: a term like medical resistance schizophrenia is used when the symptoms of two different antipsychotics are not found right
 This category of patients may be given clozapine, a drug that had the right effect but had a variety of postoperative effects including agranulocytosis and myocarditis
 Clozapine has a tendency to decrease disease in schizophrenic patients

 Social media marketing is an innovative component of integrated marketing communication plans of organizations
 ekikrut vipanan sanchaar apane lakshith bazaaron ke saath judane ke liye sanghathanon dwaara paalan kiya ja rahaa ek siddhant he
 Integrated marketing communication integrates mixed promotional elements - such as advertising, personal selling, public relations, publicity, direct marketing and sales promotion - to create a customer-centric message
 paaramparik vipanan sanchaar model main, saamagree, aavriti, samay, sanghathan dwaara sanchaar madhyam ek bahari agent, yani vigyaapan agenciyaan, vipanan anusandhan farm or jan sampark farm ke sahyog ke saath hai
 However, the development of social media has affected the way organizations communicate with customers
 web 2
0 ke udbhav main internet, logon ko online saamaajik or vyapaar sambandh banane, soochna saajha karne or pariyojnaon par sahyog karne ke liye upkarnon kaa ek set uplabdh karaata he
 Social media marketing programs typically focus on efforts to create content that attracts attention, generates online dialogue and encourages readers to share them with their social networks
 The message is transmitted from user to user and possibly resonates, since it is coming from a trusted source rather than from the brand or company
 saamaajik media ek aisa manch ban gaya he jo aasaani se internet tak pahunch rakhane vaale kisi bhi vyakti ke liye sulabh he, jo sanghathanon ko apane brands ke prati jaagrukta badhaane ke avasar dete hue, graahakon ke saath baatcheet kii suvidha pradaan karata he
 Additionally, social media serves as a relatively inexpensive platform for organizations to implement their marketing campaigns
 sanghathan apane graahakon or lakshith bazaaron se sidhe pratikriya praapt kar sakate hai
 Social media marketing benefits organizations and individuals by providing additional tools to help customers, a means to gain customer and competitive insights, and a method for managing their reputation online
 uski safalataa ko sunishchit karne vaale mahatvapurn kaarak hai uskaa apane graahak ke liye praasangik hona, unako vah jo mulya pradaan karata he or us neenv kii majbooti jis par vah nirmit he
 a strong foundation serves as a foundation or platform on which organizations can centralize their information and direct customers towards their recent growth through other social media systems such as publication of articles and press releases
 sabase lokapriy manchon main shaamil hai: The goal of a strong foundation is to build a platform that attracts and empowers its customers by allowing them the opportunity to communicate with the organization
 yah manch isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki yah sanghathan ko apane graahakon par sanghathan ke prabhaavon ko maapne or un par nigaraanee rakhane kaa bhi avasar detaa he
 All platforms have been adapted to the efforts of every organization, where primary demographics are being targeted, taking into account factors such as key opportunities and challenges presented by the platform, and the use of metrics to assess the information received from its customers
 being done
 kuch manchon dwaara prastut upkaran unke graahakon dwaara nirdhaarit lakshyon ko praapt karne main dusron kii tulana main adhik upyukt hai
 Examples of such devices and customers are as follows: sanghathanon dwaara vipanan ke liye adhik prabhavi rup se saamaajik media kaa upyog karne ke liye, unhen yah samajhnaa or sweekaar karnaa hoga ki ubharate manch vartmaan vipanan pahal ke pratisthaapan ke bajaay, unke samgr vipanan sadhano ke anupoorak or vistaar hai
 Goals for which social media can be used: sanghathanon ko safalataa ke liye saamaajik media hetu apane lakshyon ko paribhaashit karne kii zarurat he
 Goals may vary between forums
 udhaaharan ke liye, graahak seva or prasaaran adhyatanikaran ke liye Facebook kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jabaki prachaar ke liye Twitter kaa upyog ho saktaa he
 youtube can show behind the scenes of the organization
 safalataa kaarak lakshyon par nirbhar karata he: ek lakshya ho saktaa he prachaar ke parinamswaroop nae graahakon kii ek vishisht sankhya; ek or lakshya ho saktaa he kisi graahak seva sthiti main ek nirdisht samay ke andar sabhi graahakon kii shikayaton kaa jawaab
 As social media is emerging at a rapid pace, organizations often establish a temperamental presence rather than a strategic one
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, yah vikaas us had tak upyukt he jahaan sanghathan ko apane saamaajik media ke upyog or samgr vipanan yojana main ekikaran ke liye ranneeti viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Social media has been adopted by the critical mass of the population, which means that social media presence is important for organizations
 aam taur par, bilkul nahin kii jagah thodi bahut aadhikarik upasthiti behatar he, bhale hi ek vishesh ranneeti paribhaashit nahin kii gai ho
 Similar to other marketing initiatives with or without strategy and planning — social media efforts can succeed or fail
 adhikansh sanghathanon ke paas unke vipanan prayaason ke liye karmchaaree maujuud hai
 Public relations, advertising, web and printed communications are areas towards which personnel and resources are devoted
 haalanki saamaajik media, vipanan ranneetiyon main haal hi kaa kshetra he, tathaapi adhik safal sanghathanon ne saamaajik media se samanvay sthapit karne or uske upyog main madad ke liye samarpit karmchaariyon ko rakhaa he
 These individuals will have to use the currently popular tools, but whenever new means come and develop, they will be allowed to experiment with those new emerging tools
 kuch sanghathan graahakon or saamaanya logon ke man main brands ko tazaa rakhane ke liye apni vipanan yojana main saamaajik media kaa sakriy rup se upyog karte hai
 By connecting with the organization on a social media site, the organization has the opportunity to engage with individuals who may or may not be their customers, instead of contacting them when they are looking for additional information
 Depend on it saamaajik media ek vishaal vigyaapan manch he
 Organizations can target individuals based on specific interests shared on social media
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek vyakti jogging ke bare main ek youtube video dekhtaa he, ek juuta company ek vigyaapan de sakati he, yaa ek coffee company aise vyaktiyon ko lakshith karte hue vigyaapan de sakati he, jo saamaajik media citon par post karte hai ki ve thake hai
 Social media has given advertisers the opportunity to refine the advertising trap very narrowly
 kuch sanghathanon ne saamaajik media vipanan pahal karyanvit karte samay faayde se adhik nuksaan hi pahunchaaya he; anya nae media manch par bahut safal rahe
 The key to their success was the abandonment of the corporate attitude at the door
 In social media marketing, customers are focused on authenticity and a trusted relationship with the organizations with whom they are building relationships
 Dell computer kii apane direct2dell manch sahit majboot bloging upasthiti he
 Not only is this an opportunity for bloggers to learn about new products, but it has also helped in improving the reputation of the organization
 site kii shuruuaat ke baad se nakaaratmak blogon kii maatra main 49% se 22% tak giravat ai he
 Dell has been able to connect with its customers and immediately address their concerns, comments and questions through a blog
 Dell ne apane @delloutlet khate ke madhyam se bhi micro bloging site Twitter par apni maujuudagi darj karai he or apane anuyaayiyon ko vishesh chhot kii peshkash dwaara Twitter se bikri main lagbhag $3 million arjeet kiye hai
 Target has been successful by making "personal contact" with customers on Facebook and presenting their favorite products to customers
 Target ko is madhyam ko samajhane or graahakon ke saath judane ke liye faaydemand tareeqe se uske upyog main samay laga
 They tried to learn and showed particularly good performance by allowing customers to help organize the group

 Old Spice launched a truly interactive viral campaign on Tuesday 13 June and Wednesday 14 June 2010, following the overwhelming success of advertisements such as 'man your man could smell like'
 unhone fasebuk, twitor, utyub, Yahoo Answers, Reddit, 4chaiyn or kai anya jagahon se "old Spice Man" kirdaar ke prashnon ko sangrahit kiya or do dinon kii avadhi main, Youtube par 180 video pratikriyaaon ko post kiya
 Responses included a marriage proposal from a Twitter follower and a message from the actor playing the role of Old Spice Man to his daughter
 The video garnered around 6 million views in its first 24 hours, making it the most popular viral video of recent times
 Volkswagen, myspace par apane prayaas main asafal rahaa tha
 He was looking for a role in an advertisement that he was directing in the right direction, but the reason for his failure was not giving the page an opportunity to other organizations to distract him from his campaign
 wal-mart ne apane graahakon ko khulaa samvaad karne kaa mauqaa nahin diya
 Instead, he prohibited the posting of comments on the wall
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki isse nakaaratmak tippaniyon par niyantran rakhane main madad milegi; jabaki, graahakon ne jald wal todate hue kai nakaaratmak post darj kiye
 Another factor that added to wal-mart's failure in social media marketing was that they did not follow their core competencies
 wal-mart ke Facebook prishth par "save Money
 Live Better" kaa koi zikr nahin tha
 Instead he focused the page on style and fashion
 Nestlé paryaavaranvaadiyon ke saath vivaadaaspad sthiti main fansaa he, jo jald hi Facebook par unase chidh gaye or Twitter par ek "twitstorm" kii shuruuaat kii
 Additionally, a youtube video was created that attacks Nestlé due to the continued use of palm oil and the destruction of the rain forest
 Nestlé ne apane prashansakon se apane wal par keval sakaaratmak tippaniyan post karne ke anurodh ke saath is nakaaratmakataa ke prati jaise-taise pratikriya jataai
 Facebook decided to use these demographics to its advantage
 Facebook kanoonee taur par apane website par post kii gai soochna par sarvadhikaar rakhata he or usne ek vigyaapan kaarykram taiyaar kiya jo us soochna ke samoohan dwaara Facebook ke prayoktaaon ko vyaktigat rup se or unako aakarshith karne vaale vigyaapan dwaara har vyakti ko lakshith karata he
 This strategy created a sensation in the advertising world
 Prior to this type of advertising, online advertising was never very effective due to the lack of element in pop-ups and banners
 internet kaa upyog karte samay adhikansh logon ne ise kshtprad or dhyaan bhang karne vaala paaya
 With Facebook strongly targeting everyone on its website with over 400 million users, it created a target market for each company
 isliye agar ek bridal company Facebook par vigyaapit karnaa chaahati thi to vah sachmuch sunishchit kar sakati thi ki unke vigyaapan keval ve log dekh saken jinaki sagaai hui he yaa jo dating par hon, is aadhaar par ki ve kitne aage janaa chaahate hon
 isane Facebook ko prati-clic-bhugtan ranneeti ke upyog kii shuruuaat karne kaa mauqaa diya ki internet upyogkartaaon par prabhaav kii kami kii vajah se adhikansh vigyapandaata sankoch karte hai
 As a result of the pay-per-click strategy for Facebook, the company pays Facebook for the advertisement each time a Facebook user clicks on an advertisement
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki unsattar pratishat se adhik online kharidaar Facebook jaise saamaajik media kaa upyog na keval logon tak pahunchane ke liye karte hai, balki saath hi yah bhi dekhne ke liye ki kya lokapriy he or kya faishneble chiz he
 The original pay-per-click strategy was not effective because users did not want them to be taken to another page and there they would see something that was not attractive to them
 Facebook kii nai lakshyikaran pranali ke zarie prati upyogkarta clic kaa unka anupaat, kisi anya pratiyogi kii tulana main, yahaan tak ki Google se bhi, zyaada he
 This makes sense because advertising becomes attractive for the fact that they are engaged or are interested in fashion
 Facebook ne na keval apane vigyapandaataaon tak pahunch ke liye, balki Facebook upyogkarta ke liye bhi angesement aids kahalaane vaale vigyaapan bhi taiyaar kiye
 This allows three unique experiences to Facebook users and social media
 pehle aap vigyaapan par tippanee kar sakate hai jo upyogkarta ko yah kehane kii chhot detaa he ki use vigyaapan yaa utpaada main kya pasand yaa naapsand he
 These comments can be seen by other friends of the Facebook user
 jisase unke saamaajik samooh ko yah pataa chalata he ki yah yaa to bekaar he yaa bahut koob he or unhen uskaa upyog karnaa chahie
 Secondly, giving small gifts, free e-gifts to friends online has become a popular thing
 vigyapandaata ab muft i-uphaar bana sakate hai jo upyogkarta apane doston ko de sakate hai
 Lastly, users can become friends with their favorite products and organizations, adding them to their favorite company's Facebook page
 yah unhen duniya bhar main aise logon ke samooh main daalata he jo isi tarah ke utpaadon kaa anand uthaate hai or Apple jaisi companiyon ko yah dekhne kaa mauqaa detaa he ki darasal unke lakshith darshak koun hai
 Another major marketing combination on Facebook is applications
 One of the most used items on Facebook to date is the application
 a great example of an application is Farmville
 Farmville, which has more than 80 million users, more than the users currently on Twitter's website
 Facebook or uske vigyaapan par is tarah ke anuprayog kii shakti ab tak kabhi suni nahin gai
 Organizations can create in-game items that help a user's farm, and anyone who visits that farm can see an item, company advertisement, on that person's farm
 yah ek prabhavi vipanan ranneeti he kyonki kai log ise "vipanan" ke rup main nahin lete, balki maanate hai ki company is khel main aapaki madad kar rahaa he
 This is also effective because Farmville has a wide range of users and everyone visiting their site will see the advertisement

 Sanakadi Rishi means Brahma and Saraswati's four sons Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatan and Sanatkumar
 
 Their special importance is described in the Puranas
 bhagwaan kaa pratham avatar sanakaadi 4 muni hai
 Those Gods who are real, they created the egg of 24 elements for the purpose
 us and se hi ve paramatma saakaar rup main baahar nikle
 He created water and slept in the same water for thousands of divine years, so his name was Narayan
 unhen jab bahu hone kii ichha hui tab ve uthe tathaa and ke adhibhoot, aadhyatm tathaa adhidaiv ye teen khand kiye
 The senses, mind and body power arose from those divine heavens
 saath hi sutara, mahan tathaa asu naamak teen praan bhi utpann hue
 Due to his desire to eat, the egg came out of its mouth, which was filled with Varuna and the theme
 isi prakaar bolne kii ichha ke kaaran vaak indriya hui jiske dev agni tathaa bhaashan vishay hua
 In the same way nasal, eye, ear, skin, tax, foot etc
 came out
 yah paramatma kaa saakaar sthool rup he jinka naman veda purush sookt se kiye hai
 During the Holocaust, God was sleeping on Shesha
 ve aadimadhyantahinay nirgunay gunatmane hai atah shesh jo sabake baad bhi rahete hai vahi unki shaiya hai
 When he opened his eyes with the desire of creation, he saw that the whole world is absorbed in him
 tabhi rajogun se prerit paramatma kii naabhi se camel ankurit ho gaya jisase sampoorn jal prakashmay ho gaya
 Brahma originating from the Nuclear system was inhabited by Pankajakarnika
 brahma ji ne soncha ki main koun, kyon hoon tathaa mere janak koun hai? ve kamalnal ke sahare jal main pravisht hue tathaa saun varsh tak nirantar khoj karne par bhi koi praapt nahin hua
 Finally he sat down again
 vahaan hajaaron varshon tak samadhisth rahe
 Then he saw the Purushottam God
 sheshnag main shayan kar rahe prabhu kaa neelmani ke samaan deh anek aabhushanon se aachhadit tha tathaa van maala or kaustubh mani swayan ko bhagyavan maan rahe the
 In them, Brahma Ji also saw himself sitting on the bottomless ocean and lotus
 brahma ji bhagwaan kii stuti karte hai - "I was unknown to you since time immemorial, you have seen me today
 maine aapako jaanane kaa prayaas nahin kiya, yahi ham sab kaa sabase bada dosha he kyonki samast brahmand main aap hi jaanane yogya hai
 For the welfare of your immediate creatures, you took a virtuous form from which i was born
 nirgun bhi isse bhinn nahin
 "lord said" i am happy with you, go create
 pralay se jo praja mujhamen leen ho gai uski punah utpatti karo
 "and God became impregnated
 brahma ji ne sau varshon tak tapasya kii
 At that time, both water and lotus were stirred by the Holocaust air
 brahma ji ne tap kii shakti se us vaayu ko jal sahit pi liya
 Then fourteen worlds were created from the lotus in the sky
 ishwar kaal ke dwaara hi sristi kiya karte hai atah kaal kii sristi das prakaar kii hoti he - Brahma Ji did not get satisfaction from these creation, then he meditated on Narayana in his mind was the tenth creation of the Sunkadi Munis who were only Gods
 ye sanakaadi chaar sanat, sanandan, sanathan, sanatkumar naamak maharishi hai tathaa inaki aayu sadaiv paanch varsh kii rahati he
 Brahma ji told those children that son, go and create
 sanakaadi muniyon nen brahma ji se kaha "pitashri! kshamaa karen
 This maya is indirect for us, we do not believe in anything greater than the worship of God, so we will go and do devotion to Him
 " or sanakaadi muni vahaan se chal pade
 They go where the hymn of God is
 naarad ji ko inhone bhagwat sunaaya tha tathaa ye swayan bhagwaan shesh se bhagwat shravan kiye the
 The younger they look, the more Vidyakanj are
 ye chaaro vedon ke hi rup kahe ja sakate hai
 Like all the deities, Sanakadi Rishi was also a deity, such as cynicism, sunanda curse, eternal respect and Santkumar was the god of penance
 chaaro ke paas bhi vaahan the jaise- sanak kaa vaahan chil, sanandan kaa vaahan giddh, sanathan kaa vaahan bulbul tathaa sanatkumar kaa vaahan chidiya thi
 At one time all four Sunkadi Kumar reached Vaikunth to see Lord Vishnu
 ve vahaan ke saundarya ko dekhakar bade prasann hue
 There were pillars of crystal gem, many stones were studded on the ground too
 bhagwaan ke sabhi parshad nand, sugandh sahit vaikuntha ke pati kaa sadaiv gungan kiya karte hai
 As soon as the four sages climbed the six deities and climbed the seventh deodor, they saw two great gatekeepers, Jai and Vijay
 kumaar jaise hi aage bade donon dwarapalon ne muniyon ko dhruaapurvak roak diya
 Although they were not preventable, the Sunkadi monks who were always calm got angry with the Bhagavad desire
 ve dwarapalon se bole "are! bada aashcharya he
 Despite being a resident of Vaikuntha, your odd nature has not ended? You people are like snakes
 tum yahan rahane yogya nahin atah tum neeche lok main jaao
 You fall down " isapar dono dwarpal muniyon ke charnon par gir pade
 Then God came
 muniyon nen bhagwaan ko pranaam kiya
 Sri Bhagavan says "O Brahman! Brahmins are always adorable to me
 main aapse mere dwarapalon dwaara anuchit vyavhaar hetu kshamaa praarthi hoon
 "he told the gatekeepers" Although i can end this curse, but i will not do it because you people have received this curse on my own wish
 tum log iske taap se tapakar hi chamakoge, yah pariksha he ise grahan karo
 One more thing 


 you are my great dear
 " dwarapalon ne shraap ko grahan kiya
 The sages said, "lord! You are our lord too and honor us by respecting all Brahmins and think that all people will achieve liberation
" prabhu aap dhanya hai
 Always dwell in our heart
 or dwarapalon kii mukti aapke karakamalon se hi hogi" bhagwaan ne dwarapalon ko kaha "dwarapalon tum teen janm tak rakshas yoni main jaaoge tathaa main tumhaara uddhaar karunga
 "because of this curse, these two gatekeepers became demons for three births
 pratham janm main ye donon hi hiranyaksh tathaa hiranyakashyapu bane, dwitiya main ravan tathaa kumbhkarna tathaa tritiy janm main ye hi shishupal tathaa dantavakr bane
 The blue whale is a marine mammal

 In the early twentieth century blue whales were abundant on almost all the oceans of the Earth
 lagbhag ek sadi tak lagaataar inkaa shikaar hone ke kaaran lagbhag vilupt hone ke kagaar tak pahunch gaye
 The international community was established in 1966 to preserve them
 2002 ke anumaan ke anusaar duniya bhar main 5,000 se 12,000 tak hi whale bache hai
 Which are divided into five groups
 aiusien kaa anumaan he ki aaj inaki sankhya shaayad 10,000 se 25,000 ke bich he
 The largest population was in the Antarctic before their hunting
 jo lagbhag 2,39,000 ke aasapaas thi iske alaava bahut kam taadaad purvi uttari prashanth, antarctic, or hind mahaasaagar main thi
 Two groups belonged in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere
 2014 main, california ke neeli whale kii aabaadi main teji darj kii gai or yah lagbhag apane shikaar se purv kii aabaadi tak pahunch gai
 The blue whale is a member of the Balanopteridae family
 is parivaar main kubada whale, fin whale, bride whale, sei whale, or minkley whale shaamil he
 The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have differed from other families in the subgroup Mysticeti as long as the first among Oligocene
 jab yah gyaat nahin tha ki yah sadsy ek duusare se bhinn ho
 Blue whales are generally considered one of the eight species of Balanoptera
 ise ek vibhaag balanoptera kii prajati ke sthaan par sibbldus kii prajati maanata he
 But it is not accepted anywhere
 diene anukraman vishleshan ingit karata he ki blue whale kaa phylogenetically ke kareeb sei whale or Bryde whale kii tulana karne ke liye anya Balaenoptera prajatiyon, or karne ke liye kareeb kubada whale or grey whale ke liye kii tulana main minke whale 
 If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals
 neeli whale kaa ek lanbaa gavdum sharir jo anya whale kii tulana main kaaphi failaa hua hota he
 The head is U-shaped and travels from a prominent ridge to the apex using a hole
 saamne ke hisse ko munh ke saath moti he baleen platon ke aasapaas; 300 platen, prayek ke aasapaas ek meter lanbaa, se lataka upree jabade chal rahaa he, 0

 Its lung capacity is 5,000 liters)
 bhuprushthiya parivartanon ke adhyayan ko bahudhaa gatikeey bhuvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 It is clear that this name refers to the dynamic state of the dorsal environment, but nowadays this name is not particularly popular and physical geology is more prevalent in its place
 is vigyaan ke teen mukhya ang hote hai, jo is prakaar hai : Transportation of surface rocks by decay, erosion and denudation and sedimentation, etc
 avsaad kaa sanchayan tathaa Addition and consolidation of accumulated depression jo prakritik kaarak prishthiya padaarth ko prabhavit karte hai, ve apane kreedakshetra kii paristhiti ke anusaar do vargon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai : Surface and aantbhom Among them, the functional energies of the surface factors mainly and dynamically originate from the Sun
 is varg main vayumandal ke vibhinn avyav, varsha ityadi, aantbhom jal or sote, nadi tathaa himandi, samudr tathaa jhil vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Their playground is mainly the land area of the geosphere, which will also include the coastline
 samudr ke nital par inkaa kuch prabhaav nahin padataa or prishth ke gahare bhaagon main bhi inaki praveshyata apekshaakrit ati sookshm hoti hai
 The main source of the energy of visceral factors is the internal heat of the earth
 is varg main patalvirupan jwalamukhi krida, ushn or bukamp ityadi aate hai
 It is clear that their original playing area is below the surface and the effects generated from them are sometimes above the ground and never come
 vayumandal main chaar aise mukhya avyav hai jo bhuprishth ke prati kaaryshil rahete hai: varsha, taap parivartan, tushaar or vaayu
 Rainfall is a very common, but extremely powerful factor
 iske kaary kii vidhi kuch rasinic or kuch balkrit hoti he
 Absolutely pure water often lacks the ability to carry out chemical reactions
 yadhyapi varshajal prithvi par pahunchne se purv adhikansh shuddh hota he, phir bhi akaashmaarg se aate samay usamen vayumandaleey oxigen or carbon dioxide donon hi paryaapt maatra main villin ho jate hai
 By the reaction of oxidized and carbonized rainwater, many minerals of dorsal rocks are converted into oxides and carbonates according to their nature
 kuch khanij, athwa anke anu, jal ke saath rasinic yogic hydrate bhi bana lete hai
 In this way, the rocks are decomposed by the chemical activity of the Salalaya
 nae bane hue padaarthon main kuch viley hote hai or kuch aviley
 With the formation of solute fragments, they dissolve in water and insoluble fragments are left there
 aviley bhaag main mitti ke anu or baaluu ityadi hote hai, jo kalantar main sanchit hokar vividh bhanti kii mitti ke str banaate hai
 Sometimes the insoluble material does not get an opportunity to accumulate, but the rain water flows on the ground completely or partially, carrying it with you
 jab tak jal main padaarth ko baha le jane kii shakti rahati he, tab tak vah bahata chalaa jaataa he or shakti ke ksheen hone par vah jahaan tahaan baith jaataa he
 In this way, it is called the matter that is shed by rainwater
 isaki maatra dharaatal kii dhaal or varsha kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 Both the slope gradient and the intensity of rainfall increase the power of rainwater to flow
 varsha kii kriya ke parinaamon par sthaneey jalwaayu kaa bhi bahut prabhaav padataa he, yadi do pradeshon main vaarshik varsha kii maatra praaia: samaan ho, kintu ek main halake halake chhinte baar baar padate hon or duusare main kabhi kabhi kintu bahut teevr varsha hoti ho, to in donon pradeshon main varsha kaa prabhaav bhinn bhinn hoga
 In the same way, the effect of rainfall is completely different even in the alternating regions of dry and rainy seasons
 taap kii vibhinnata kaa bhi varsha kii kriyasheeltaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In tropical countries, the power to decompose rain water is much higher than in cold countries
 baari baari se garmi or sardi ke prabhaav main padakar chattaane shanai: shanai: chhin bhinn hokar mote yaa maheen chure ke rup main parivartit ho jaati hai
 It is a common quality of matter that it spreads under the influence of heat and shrinks when it gets cold
 failane evam sikudne kii maatra dravyavishesh par nirbhar hoti he, arthath koi dravya adhik failata he or koi kam
 Many rocks are made of two, three or more minerals
 at: din kii garmi main ye sab khanij apane apane gunon ke anusaar failte hai or raatri main thande hote hue sikudte hai
 The algal mineral is less dispersed, the more the algal
 jo khanij adhik failata he, vah dusron par ek prakaar kaa dabaav daalata he jisase kan chhin bhinn hone lagate hai
 Day by day due to this process, the effect increases and over time the upper layers of rocks become powdery
 pratyaksh he ki din or raat ke taap main jitna hi adhik antar hoga, utane hi adhik veg se shilaayein chhin bhinn hongi
 In this process the chemical composition of minerals does not change at all, only the mutual bonds of the minerals become so loose that they separate from each other
 isi se is kriya ko vighatan kehete hai
 By the combined action of both precipitation and temperature change, which are often in nature, shilaon ke apghaton or vighatan donon ko protsaahan miltaa he
 The action of frost is also only strengthened
 is kaarak kii shakti kaa strot yah saamaanya vrutt he ki 4 degree sein0 par jal kaa aapekshik ghanatv adhiktam hota he
 This causes the density to decrease when it becomes more frosty, that is to say, in other words, the volume of water increases
 0 degree sein0 par jab jal barf main roopantarit hota he, tab uskaa aaytan praaia: dashamang bad jaataa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep in mind that during the installation of ice by artificial method, there should be a blank space in the vessel for increased volume of snow
 is sthaan ke abhaav main failati hui barf ke dabaav se paatr ke foot jane kii ashanka haati he
 According to this circle, when the rocks in the cold country come under the influence of frost, their limbs become dislocated
 shilaon ke chhidron or vidaron main jal ghus jaataa he or vah prati din sardi paane par jamata he or garmi paane par pighalta he
 This makes the elements of the upper layers of the rocks weak and often unrelated in some time
 baad main varsha tathaa vaayu aadi ke aghat se ve sahaj hi chur chur ha jate hai
 Often this effect of blight is explosive
 sheetapradhan dashon ke un bhaagon main jahaan vanaspati kam ho, khuli, anaachhadit chattane is prakaar toote hue shail khandon se dhaki rahati hai evam pahadiyon ke talon main is prakaar se bane khandon kii badi rashiyaan ekatrit ho jaati hai, jise shailamalaba kehete hai
 These segments have no fixed shape and their corners are often pointed and sharp
 shail vighatan ke liye tushaar bahut hi shaktishaalee kaarak he, kintu iskaa kaaryakshetra keval sheetapradhan pradesh hi he
 Typical playground areas of the air are deserts and high altitude regions, where it flows most often
 anukool paristhitiyon main isamen balkrit apradan karne kii apurv kshamta hoti he
 The main secret of its power lies in the fact that it blows away countless small sand and soil particles at great speed
 prachand vaat main behate hue ye kan barambar ek duusare se takaraate hai, jisase apgharshan hota he or shanai: shanai: kan laghutar hote jate hai
 Also, the mountains, rocks and stone blocks that come in the path of the storm, on top of them, they also blow like sand, due to which all of them are defiled
 saadharantaya baaluu dharaatal se adhik oonchaai tak nahin uth paati
 For this reason, the height of the erosion-action area of the air is also limited by the same ratio
 falat: bahudhaa registani pradeshon main pahadiyon or chattaanon ke nichle bhaag to apgharshit ho patale evam sankeern ho jate hai, kintu upar kaa dhad aprabhavit chhot jaataa he
 This type of adornment makes some unique shapes like mushrooms etc
 registani pradeshon main vaayu kii disha praaia: bahut samay tak samaan bani rahati he, jisase inaki apgharshan or apradan kii disha bhi bahut samay tak aparivartit rahati he
 For this reason, the airborne spheres in the desert are angular and flakey, rather than chubby
 vastut: inke liye golashm shabd anupyukt he or uske sthaan par german shabd dricanter kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Air has the unique power of transport along with erosion
 maheen baaluu or dhul ke kanon ko bade vishaal pariman main vaayu varsh prati varsh registani pradeshon se udaakar le jaati he or aise sthanon main nickshepit kar detii he jahaan uskaa veg kam ho jaataa he or ghaas evam jhaadiyaan uske maarg main rukaawat daalati hai
 In this way, the deposits of the transported substance are called aerated sand and aerated clay
 uttari china main is prakaar se bani vaiudh mrittika kaa ek bada vishaal nikshep hai, jisaki motaai 300 se 450 meter tak he or jise vaayu madhya asia ke registaanon se uda kar yahan le ai he
 Some part of the water brought by rain goes back into the atmosphere by evaporation, some flows into the sea by the way of flowing rivers and some gets absorbed into the earth
 jo bhaag dharaatal par bah jaataa he, use apvaah kehete hai or jo prishth main ant:sravit hota he, use bhumigat athwa aantbhaum jal kehete hai
 The reciprocal ratio of these three parts depends on the local climate, topography and geology
 adrr jalwaayu ke pradeshon main vashpikaran kii maatra prabal hoti he
 In areas of similar climate, the amount of runoff water increases with the heterogeneity of the topography
 bhoumiki kaa vrutt bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki kuch shilaayein bahut randhri to hoti hai, par saath hi unki praveshya bahut alp hoti he, jese shail or mrittika
 Apart from these, a third category of rocks is neither random nor pervious, like granite
 at: ant:sravit jal kii maatra sthanvishesh ke shailon ke bhautik lakshanon par nirbhar hoti hai
 Upon reaching some depth in the ground, the land and rock are saturated with water
 santrupti kii sataha ko bhunmalaj str kehete hai
 Depth of this level is dependent on the amount of annual rainfall of the particular area, the topography and the local geological structure
 saadharantaya bhumjalantar sookhe pradeshon kii apeksha adrr kshetron main dhartal ke sameep hota he
 Even in the adjoining parts of the sea, lake, lake and big rivers, this level is relatively close to the surface
 sookhaa pad jane se yah gaharaai main chalaa jaataa he or ati vrishti hone par upar aa jaataa he
 The extent to which gut water can penetrate the surface of the water is also dependent on the composition of local rocks
 jal shailakanon ke bich ke randhri sthanon or vivaron main samaa jaataa he, at: jitani gaharaai tak shailon main randhra, athwa vidar honge, utani hi dur tak aantbhaum shailon ke dabaav ke kaaran adhikansh vidar main sandhital band ho jate hai
 Stagnation can also be short
 aisi sthiti main aantbhaum jal adhik gaharaai main na jaakar pashrv kii ore agrasar hone lagata he
 Ultimately, its target is the sea
 kabhi to yah bhumigat margo se hi vahaan pahunch jaataa he or kabhi use aise maarg mil jate hai, jinase vah pun: dharaatal par soton ke rup main pahunch jaataa he
 In addition to open and wide walls and resources, the flow of visceral water elsewhere is very slow
 isi kaaran usamen kisi prakaar kii balkrit kriya karne kii shakti nahin hoti, kintu anukool paristhitiyon main yah rasinic kriya avashya kar saktaa he
 Moving transverse to the fissure and backbone, it, like rainwater, oxidizes, carbonizes, or hydrates the minerals of the walls of the walls, thus decomposing the shell
 jis bhubhag main chuunaapatthar ke shail hon, vahaan aantbhaum jal ko kaary karne kaa bahut bada kshetra mil jaataa he
 Limestone dissolves in carbonized water
 at: chuunaapatthar ke sttaron main se bahata hua jal uske anekanek bhaagon ko villin kar guphaayen bana daalata he
 Sometimes the size of this type of caves is large, up to several hundred meters long and 4-5 meters deep and the flowing water from these forms the gut river
 kahin kahin carbonatoyukt jal gupha kii chat se tapakane lagata he
 Some part of the dripping water evaporates and evaporates and the solute calcium carbonate precipitates at the dripping site
 ek hi sthaan par boondon ke barambar tapakane ore usee sthaan par calcium carbonate ke nirantar avakshepan se ek stambhakar raashi ban jaati he, jise stellectite kehete hai
 Similar action is also caused by evaporation of the dripping water on the floor of the cave and from that the precipitated carbonate forms a columnar shape that rises from the floor to the ceiling
 in akritiyon kii stalegmite kehete he
 Sometimes stalagmites move towards each other to form a continuous column from the roof of the cave to the floor
 kabhi is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii raashi kaa koi vishisht rup nahin hota
 In this case it is called calc nisad, tufa or travertine
 kinhin kinhin gufaaon main is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii maatra itani vishaal ho jaati he ki aise carbonate se vyavsaay chal saktaa he
 It has been mentioned above that sometimes the gut water returns to the ground again as springs
 yah ghatana sthaneey shailon ke vishisht vinyas ke upar nirbhar karti he
 If a sandstone rock, su, is configured in such a way that its top and bottom are completely or often inaccessible rocks, clay, shale or other rocks of the same quality, then the intrusive water is leaking into the stomatal rock, the impermeable rock
 After reaching the upper contact level, the gradient of the levels will begin to increase in the lateral direction
 usee disha main jahaan kahin vah shail kisi prakritik kaat main anaachhadit ho pragat hoga, to us sthaan par aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main bahane lagegaa
 Often the fauna present in rocks also helps in the formation of springs
 yadi kisi bhransh ke kaaran kaai apargamya shail visthapit hokar randhri or pargamya shail ke saannnidhya main avasthit ho jaay to us sthaan par jahaan bhranshatal kisi prakritik kaat ke anuprastha anaachhadit hoga, vahaan sote footne lagenge
 The mineral water always contains a small amount of mineral matter
 jab inaki maatra bhaar ke anusaar 1 prati shat se adhik ho, tab use khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai; kintu calcium carbonate jaise khanij bahut prachur maatra main hone par bhi kuch swaad nahin dete or magnesium ke lavan ati alp maatra main bhi swaad dene lagate hai
 The water of the springs is often subject to pressure
 pani ke baahar aate hi dabaav main kami ho jaati he or uske saath pani kii vileyata main bhi hraas ho jaataa he
 Therefore, mineral material is often precipitated at the point of origin of springs
 is padaarth kaa sanghatan praaia: churnik athwa silicy hota he or ye nikshep sanghatan ke anusaar, calk nisaad, athwa silicy nisaad kehalaate hai
 Sometimes iron carbonate, or other salts, or sulfur also precipitate
 kisi kisi sote kaa pani bahut garam hota he or kabhi kabhi pani radioective bhi hota he
 Rajgiri hot water fountain is very famous in the state of Bihar
 in soton kaa pani praayay: prishth ke bahut gahare bhaagon se aata he
 The water of some springs is not only of visceral origin but also of magmatic origin, that is, water in a remote womb containing the vapor emitted from the magmatic substance
 aise sote ko megmiy sota kehete hai
 Somewhere the water is present in such a special situation that by making a well at that place, the water automatically rises up and at some places the water rises like a fountain bouncing up to several meters above the ground
 inhen utsrut coop kehete hai
 The compulsory entry restrictions for these formation are: Intermittent water is stored inside a porous and inaccessible rock with impermeable rocks on both the top and bottom, blocking the flow of water in the direction of the level prone and water
 The original source of the water should be at such a height from the place of making the well that desirable liquid static pressure is produced, due to which the water will rise to the surface automatically when the well is formed
 Su get up madras praant ke dakshin arket jile main naiveli sthaan par, jahaan peet ke vishaal nikshep mili hai, bahut hi ullekhneey utsrut sthiti pai gai he
 The pressure and volume of the water released there are so high that peat excavation has been very difficult, and special means have to be used to control the water
 prakritik karkon main nadi bahut hi prabhavi tathaa kaaryshil he
 It performs erosion, transportation and deposition, all three types of work in great quantity
 yadhyapi varshajal ke kaary kaa mahatv kuch kam nahin he, phir bhi nadi kii kriya lambii evam apekshaakrit sankeern ghaatiyon main sankendrit hone ke kaaran, iskaa prabhaav va fal adhik spasht prathit hota he
 Like rainwater, the river water can also decompose the rocks of the bottom and sides of its valley by chemical action
 is prakaar utpann apaghatit padaarth kaa viley ansh nadi ke jal main ghul jaataa he or aviley bhaag bhi dhar ke saath bah jaataa he
 The river performs this action smoothly in the path of its mountainous region, because the ghar is so heavy there that it is often exposed to the levels of new, unadulterated rocks, so that they come under the influence of spontaneous action
 kintu maidani pradesh main dhar kaa veg kam ho jane par, ghati kaa tal mrittika or baaluu ke aavaran se aachhadit ho jaataa he
 As a result, contact with undigested rocks also decreases
 jin pradeshon main chuunaapatthar ke shail adhik hon, vahaan rasinic kriya bahut prachur pariman main hoti rahati he, kyonki carbonati jal main chuunaapatthar sahaj hi villin ho jaataa he
 The force of chemical erosion is much greater than that required in a river
 saadharantaya shuddh jal shailon ko apgharshit nahin kar saktaa, kintu jab usamen baaluu or bajri mili ho to sthiti badal jaati he, kyonki ve donon ek duusare ko sambalit karte hai
 The water of the river imparts strength and the sand and gravels are abrasive, due to which the folds and the sides become smaller
 saath hi ve swayan bhi tah ke shailon ko apgharshit karne main bhaag lete hai
 The river's abrasive power is dependent on the intensity of the ghara and the intensity of the torrent is based on the topography
 dhaal jitani hi pravan hoti he, dhar bhi usee ke anusaar teevr hoti he
 Also, the amount of water also affects the speed of the torrent
 jal kii maatra ke saath dhar kii gati uske ghanmul ke anupaat se badhati he, arthath yadi jal kii maatra aathguni ho jaay, to dhar kii teji duguni ho jaati he
 As a result, in countries where the dry and rainy seasons are different, the erosion power of rivers increases greatly during the rainy days
 aarambh main, visheshkar kathor chattaanon ke pradesh main, nadi ke tat praaia: ekadam khadey or prapaati hote hai
 But due to atmospheric factors, the upper parts of the edges start degenerating
 isse utpann apaghatit or khandit padaarth nadi baha le jaati he
 As a result, the passage of the river valley becomes shaped over time, that is, both its sides become sloping towards the bottom
 nadi unche sthaan se bahakar samudr kii ore jaati he, at: uskaa praytn sadaiv yahi hota he ki vah thal bhaag ko katkar itnaa nicha kar de ki vah samudratal ke baraabar ho jaay
 In this way, the slope of the longitudinal passage from the top of the river to the confluence is highest towards the top and lowest near the confluence
 duusare shabdon main, nadi kaa udhrvadhar kataav ghati ke upree bhaagon main sabase adhik hota he or samudr kii ore badhane par kam hota jaataa he
 When the valley of the rivers reaches such a position that the vertical erosion stops and its valley floor becomes like the sea level, it reaches the peak level of erosion
 vah ghati, jisamen udhrvadhar kataav tivrata se pragatisheel ho, tarun kehalaati he, jo charamastar par pahunch chuki ho use vruddh evam inaki antasth avasthaa ko praudh kehete hai
 All three phases may exist in different parts of the same valley
 yadi kisi vruddh sarita kii ghati ke pradesh main vivenic shaktiyon ke prabhaav se sthalakritik parivartan ho jaae tathaa sthal vaishamy pun: utpann ho jaae to nadi kaa punaryukt ho jaataa he or vah ek baar phir udhrvadhar kataai aarambh kar detii he
 Generally, the slope of the river valley is gradual, though the slope may vary from place to place
 kintu kabhi kabhi pravannta akramik bhi ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 This situation especially occurs in regions where hard and soft rocks are interchanged
 mridu jal sugamawa se aparadit hokar bah jaataa he, jisase vahaan ghati ke utkeernan adhik maatra main ho jaataa he
 The rigid level is obstructive and remains where it stands
 pani uske upar se bahata hua ghati ke mridu staravaale adhik utkeern bhaag main girane lagata he
 In this way, the slope of the valley becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 bahudhaa kalantar main in prapaton kaa sthaan bhi kramash: nadi ke sheersh kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 It happens that due to the fall of the water from the height of the waterfall, the river's edge accelerates, which increases its erosion power
 prapaat ke thik neeche ek prakaar kaa dah ban jaataa he, jisamen bhanvar padane lagate hai tathaa unamem tivrata se ghumta hua pani prapaat kii diwaar ko kaatane lagata he
 In this way, the lower soil level is cut more rapidly and a type of amputation starts, causing the stern layer to come out without any delay
 kalantar main talochhedan ke or bad jane par, kathor str kaa sabase agrim bhaag ablamb ke abhaav main tuutakar gir padataa he or prapaat kaa sthaan gire hue shail kii naap ke baraabar peeche hat jaataa he
 This action keeps on happening again and again and again the place of the falls falls back
 is prakaar ke apradan ke kaaran kadi chattan ke tuutane se, prapaat ke praarambhik sthaan se peeche kii ore ek gahari dhati banati chali jaati he
 The valley engraved in the shale of the confluence of the Narmada River at Jabalpur and the waterfall of Bhedaghat is a beautiful example of this incident
 vishwavikhyath nyagara nadi kaa prapaat isi prakaar bana he
 From the measurements made there, it is known that the falls often retreat one and a half meters from their place every year
 anumaanath: isi gati se praaia: 11 kilometre lambii nyagara kii ghati ko banane main 20 se 35 hajaar varsh tak lage honge
 In many other situations, waterfalls can be formed, but at every stage it is necessary to vary the speed of erosion of different components of the valley
 ye jalprapaat ghati kii tarun avasthaa ke uplakshak hote hai
 Upon reaching the peak level of erosion, the power of the river is used to cut its back
 jab ghati ekadam sidhi ho, to donon pashrv ek se katate hai, kintu thodi bhi vakrata aa jane se asamanta utpann ho jaati he
 Towards the concave side of the valley there is a greater intensity in the edge and hence there is a greater amount of erosion
 isliye vipareet uttal pashrv kii ore dhar kaa veg kam ho jane se, na keval kataav band ho jaataa he balki nadi dwaara vishmata or bad jaati he or nadi kaa maarg adhikadhik vakr hota jaataa he
 This is how the twisty bend originates
 bahudhaa in modon kaa aayam atyadhik bad jaataa he or mode bhi bahut jatil ho jate hai
 Sometimes two turns are so close to each other that the distance between them is less than the tithe or even less the distance of the river's transverse route
 aisi avasthaa main kabhi kabhi do modon ke bich sankeern greeva ko katkar, sidhe maarg se bahane lagati he or ek yaa adhik visarpi mode parityakt ho jate hai, jinhen chhaadan kehete hai
 The transport function of the river is often more effective than all the natural factors
 nijee apradan se utpann jo shail churna, bajri, baaluu or mitti utpann hoti he, vah sab nadi bahaakar samudr kii ore le jaati he, saath hi vayumandaleey karkon, vishesh kar varsha jal dwaara utpann shail churna tathaa khand bhi, kalantar main kisi na kisi maarg se nadi kii ghati main pahunch jate hai or uski dhar main pakadakar ve sab samudr kii ore dhire dhire aage badhate jate hai
 The larger blocks, which are unable to lift the river, move in transverse folding of the fold and the small particles move suspended suspended
 parivahan kii shakti dhar kii gati par nirbhar he
 If the amount of increase in speed is more, then the transport power will become 6 more
 arthath yadi gati badhkar dugani ho jaay, to parivahan shakti 64 guni ho jaaegi
 It is clear from this that during the rainy floods the transport power of the rivers as well as the amount of destruction power becomes very terrible
 ganga, brahaputra ityadi badi nadiyon ke tatavarti nivasee is vinaashkari shakti se bhali bhaanti parichit hai
 Apart from suspended sand and soil, many other rivers dissolve in their water and take them from the continental parts to the sea
 jaisaa varsha jal or aantbhom jal ke prakarnon main bataaya ja chukaa hen, unki rasinic kriya prachur pariman main hoti hai, jisase viley padaarth bhi usee anupaat main banataa hai
 All these substances eventually reach the rivers
 nadiyaan swayan bhi apni kriya se kuch viley padaarth utpann karti hai or yah sab kramash: samudr main pahunch jaataa hai
 By calculation, it is estimated that the Ganges and the Brahmaputra often transport 1100 n 106 cubic meters of soil and sand per year to the Bay of Bengal through its combined route, the amount of material transported annually by the Mississippi River of America is 200 n 106 cubic meters
 china kii hwangaho nadi itane vishaal pariman main mitti le jaati hai ki uske muhane ke paas kaa samudr milon dur tak pilaa bana rahata hai or isi se vah pit sagar kehalaata hai
 In South America, the delta which has become a land of land in the sea floor in front of the mouth of Baha'i soil and sand by the Amazon river is about 200 kilometers long
 anumaanath:, vishwa kii samast nadiyon dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 16 ghan kilometre aanki gai hai
 As mentioned in the preceding section, the transport power of a river depends on the speed of its torrent
 at: jyonhi uski dhar kii gati main hs hota he, uski lad kaa kuch ansh turant nickshepit hone lagata he
 The first important deposition center in the path of the river is at the place at the bottom of the mountain where it leaves the Parvatya region and enters the plain
 kaaphi bade bade golashyam or choti badi batiyaan, jo ghati main parvaty bhaag main sugamawa se ludhakti hui chali aati he, nadi ke maidan main pravesh karte hi tal main baith jaati hai
 In this way a deposit is formed at the bottom of the mountains, which is called alluvial cone, or fan
 doosraa mahatvapurn gati parivartan kaa sthaan nadi ke sangam ke sameep hota he
 One, the slope of the valley gets very low as it reaches there, the other sea and lake water also stops the flow
 bahudhaa dhar kaa veg itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki jowar kaa veg nadi ke veg se adhik hota he, jise jowar ke samay nadi kii dhar ulti bahane lagati hai
 The result of this is that the river near the confluence begins to deposit sediments and sediments with great intensity and fill its own valley
 avsaad ke jamaa hone se nadi kaa bahna or bhi kathin ho jaataa he or nadi cat katkar kai choti dhaaraon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 In the course of this deposited depression, a flat plain is formed, out of which many small streams flow at a very slow speed towards the sea
 yah maidan tribhujaakar hota he, jiskaa ek sheersh nadi kii ghati ke us sthaan par hota he jahaan se dhara kaa vibhaajan armbh hota he or uske saamne vaali aadhaar rekha samudr ke tat ke anuprastha hoti he
 This type of region is called delta
 nadi ke sangam par gati ke avaruddha hone se bahudhaa baaluu dirdhakaar raashiyon main nickshepit ho jaataa he, jise balukabhithti, athwa rodhika kehete hai
 The river in the area between the alluvial cone and the delta is often affected by seasonal floods and fluctuations
 baadh ke samay nadi main itnaa pani aa jaataa he jo uski ghati main nahin samaa saktaa
 As a result, it spreads far beyond the two sides
 jo pradesh is prakaar baadh ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he, use baadh maidan kehete hai
 In that part the speed of the river edge is much less than the main stream, due to which there is abundant soil and sand deposits
 iske vipareet baadh ke samay mukhya dhar kii gati saadhaaran samay kii gati se bahut adhik hoti he, isaliye vahaan apradan bad jaataa he or nadi pehle jamaa kii hui baaluu or mitti ko katkar le jaati he
 As already mentioned, the effort of the river is to deepen its valley, to take it to the peak of erosion
 ghati kii gaharaai bad jane par bahudhaa aisi sthiti aa jaati he ki barh ke samay bhi pehle vaali baadh ke maidan tak na pahunchne paae
 In such a situation, the river creates a new floodplain
 puranavala baadh-maidan nadi vedika kehalaata he
 Often in the valleys of the river, such altars are visible on both sides, or on the same side, well above the innovative level
 kahin kahin to 2-3 yaa or bhi adhik vedicen kramash: ek duusari ke upar vibhinn talon par milti hai
 The history of the development of the river valley can be known from his studies
 unche parvatiy bhaagon or sheetapradhan deshon main thande mausam main jal ke badale him varsha hoti he
 Areas where snow-rainfall is more than the amount of snow melt during summer time are always snowed
 jis oonchaai par aisa hota he, use him rekha kehete he
 This elevation varies in different latitudes and regions, usually in the Himalayas ranging from 4,500 to 5,500 meters, the Alps Mountains 2,400 meters and in Norway only 1,500 meters
 dhruvon ke paas, vishesh kar dakshini dhruv par to samudr kaa bahut bada bhaag sadaiv himachhadit rahata he
 When coming from the sky, snow is as soft as cotton wool's cheeks
 vastut: usamen prachur maatra main vaayu mili hoti he
 When a large amount is collected, the pressure from the upper levels escapes into the lower levels and the snowflakes converge to form hard ice
 bahut vishaal pariman main ekatrit hone par gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se, anukool sthalakritti pradeshon main barf kii raashi dhire dhire neeche kii ore khisakane lagati he or is prakaar ek nadi si ban jaati he, jise himandi kehete hai
 Later, like a river, she also builds a valley for herself
 jise vah shanai: shanai: adhikadhik gaharaa karti jaati he
 Being engraved with solid ice, glacial valleys have certain characteristics, three of which are prominent: unka nital chaudaa or kinare prapaati hote hai, jisase unka udhrv pariched chha aakaar kaa hota he, Their valleys do not spiral but go very straight for a long time and mukhya himandi or sahaayak himandi ke sangam ke sthaan par donon ghaatiyon kaa tal kramik na hokar prapaati hota he
 Due to this the valley of tributaries is called Nilambi valley
 thos hone kaaran himandi kii gati bahut kam hoti he
 At some places, only 30 centimeters move throughout the day
 kabhi kabhi veg apekshaakrit adhik bhi hota he
 Some glaciers in Alaska often rise two and a half meters in a day
 yah gati, nadi kii gati ke samaan hi, barf kii maatra or pradeshik dhaal kii pravanta par nirbhar hoti he
 On reaching the bottom of the ice line, the ice begins to melt and takes the form of an ordinary river
 himalay se aane vaali praaia: samast nadiyon ke jal kaa mul strot yah pighalati hui himandiyaan hi hai
 In regions where the snow line is often equal to the sea level, glaciers themselves fall into the sea
 aise sangamon par bahudhaa barf kii badi badi rashiyaan peeche se aanevaali barf ke dabaav se mul nadi se tuutakar pruthak ho samudr main pravaahit ho jaati he or behate behate kaaphi dur nikal jaati hai
 These zodiac signs are called the Plowy iceberg
 plavi himshail anya kaarnon se bhi ban sakate hai
 In very cold regions, sometimes it happens that glaciers retain their form even when they are near the sea, and by carving the sea level near the coast, they continue to advance their valley far and wide
 norway or sweden main is prakaar se bani ghaatiyon ke bahut udhaaharan hai evam unhen fiard kehete hai
 Like the river, the glacier also transports rocks undamaged and broken from them
 kintu donon kii kriya vidhi main bahut antar he
 Where many small and big obstacles move at the bottom of the river by rolling at the speed of the edge, there is no opportunity for them to roll in the glacier
 jo tukdaa jis dasha main barf main fas jaataa he usee avasthaa main aage badhata he
 Many pieces of rock fall here and fall on the glacier
 jyon jyon himdhar aage badhati he, ye khand bhi jyon ke tyon pade hue aage badhate hai
 As a result of this variation, where the stones transported by the river become chubby form after some time rolling and colliding with each other, the sections carried by the snowfall remain angular and pointed until the end
 iske atirikt dhar kii sahaayta se nadi apane parivahit padaarth ko aakaar or ghanatv ke aadhaar par pruthak pruthak bhaagon main vibhakt kar detii he, yatha tej dhar kii jagahon par keval moti bajri, usase kam tej dhar main moti baaluu evam gati ke kramash: or kam hone par maheen baaluu or mitti baari baari se ghati kii tah main jamaa hoti he
 In contrast, glacial material cannot be sorted in this way, but its loading consists of large ballasts, fine sand and clay, blocks of different sizes, all moving together in unison
 or jahaan himandi kaa pighalanaa armbh hota he uskaa sabakaa sab bina kisi vibhaajan ke ek saath nickshepit ho jaataa he
 The power of transport of matter in the glacier is unlimited
 shilaon ke bade khandon ko bhi himdhar usee sugamawa se parivahit kar sakati he jisase ki chote kanon ko
 Thus, where a large amount of water separated by mere rock in a river valley cannot go further apart without broken into small blocks, they continue to move in the glacial valley
 himandi kaa jahaan ant hota he or barf pighalati he, vahiin ye bade bade khand gir padate hai
 They have no maternal connection to the local territorial rocks, hence they are called displaced blocks
 himandi se dharaatal par girte samay jis pahal par bhi ye tik jaayan, usee par tike hue anek kaal tak khadey rah jate hai
 Sometimes they fall on only a small corner and stand on the same
 aisi sthiti main inkaa santulan bada sthir sa dikhaai padataa he or inhen du:sthit khand kehete hai
 The snow-clad sections near the base of the valley scratch the folding stones from their pointed corners
 barf ke dabaav or shilaon kii kathorta ke anusaar, ye kharonchen kam yaa adhik gahari hoti hai
 Sometimes many small small blocks pass close by
 un sabaki ragad se ek hi shila main anek kharonchen ban jaati hai
 The rubbing of these blocks takes place in the direction of glacial flow, so all the scratches are parallel to each other
 is prakaar kharonchi hui shilaon ko rekhanvit kehate hai
 In contrast to this, it is sometimes the case that a rock, trapped near the glacier in the glacier, moves forward by rubbing through the hard rocks of the valley folds, so that its top edge is smooth and fruitful and the other end is angular
 And fangs are left
 is prakaar himandiranjit pahaldaar khand banate hai
 Sometimes the mounds of rocks located in the glacial valley become very smooth due to the abrasion of snow and their western corner falls
 adhikansh chikanahat tile ke us bhaag main hoti he jo dhar kii vipareet disha main hota hai, kyonki barf aage kii ore ragad detii hui badhati hai
 In the case of Bhagaparvsh, it is left as it is, retail and sharp
 is prakaar ke tilo ko raash muhane kehete hen
 Most of the time, the glacial rocks carry sections on their top floor
 ghati ke kagaaron kii chattaanon tushaar aadi ke prabhaavavash samay par tuutati rahati hai, jisase shailakhand evam churna himandi ke upar uske kinaaron ke paas girte rahete hai or is tarah himandi ke donon kinaaron par parivahit padaarth ko pashrv moren kehete hai
 Initially over the central part of the glacier, rocks are usually not present at all, because that part is away from the edges of the valley
 par do him-nadiyon kaa sangam hone par ek ke dahni ore tathaa duusari ke bai ore ke more na paraspar mil jate hai or sangam ke aage se madhya moren ban jaataa he
 Finally, where glaciers cease and water is formed by the melting of ice, all the material brought to and between the ice surface collapses
 ise agrantasth moren kehete hai
 There is an absolute lack of stratification
 yadi jalwaayu main parivartan, yaa kisi or kaaran se himandi apni pehali seemaa se agragami hone lage, to barf pehle bane hue agrantasth moren kii samast raashi ko aage dhakelti hui chalegi
 Conversely, if the glacier moves towards the top, one layer of the frontal moraine will be formed backwards
 dharaatal ke teen chauthai bhaag par aadhipatty hote hue bhi samudr apana vistaar badhaane ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahata he
 Apparently his field of work is the neutral region, where he tries to make the continent flattened equal to its surface, dislodging the rocks by its strong waves, destroying the bumpy roughness of the land
 yon to shant mausam main bhi lehren baar baar chattaanon se takaraakar unhen aghat pahunchaati hai, par tufaan ke samay to unki shakti sahastron guna adhik ho jaati he
 The waves of large storms often rise 14–15 m high
 unke dwaara phenkaa hua phen, bajri or chote rode 40-50 meter unche uchhalte hue dekhe gaye hai
 Each wave strikes the coast with the weight of all its water, and it seems as if nature is beating the neutral region with a very large cube
 lehren paroksh dhang se bhi apni apardi kriya main sahaayta leti hen
 All rocks have fine cracks and small holes
 jab lehren jor se aakar achaanak chattaanon se takaraati hai, tab in daraaron or chhidron main bhari hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa avasar nahin mil paata or vah jahaan kii tahaan dabakar sankuchit ho jaati he
 At the time of the return of the waves, the air expands again when the water pressure is removed
 yah kriya itani shidhrata se hoti he ki achaanak faili hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa maarg bhi nahin mil paata or vah ek prakaar se visphotak shakti kaa kaary karti he
 By repeating the action repeatedly, the cracks around the crevices and holes start to break and the holes become larger respectively
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki daraaren samudr or mahadesh donon kii ore khuli hoti hai
 In such a state, when the pressure is exerted by the waves, the crack air escapes rapidly towards the ground and upon return of the waves, it enters the crack again as fast
 baar baar aisa hone se maheen chhidr bade hote jate hai or kramash: surangen ban jaati hai, jinhen fadhamichhidraf kehete hai
 In this way, the neutral rocks gradually begin to rise at the height of the waves, which makes the longitudinal rock of the upper rocks also weakened and they also collapse
 gurutvakarshan bhi is kriya main bahut kuch bhaag letaa he
 Where there are many types of rocks, some weak and some hard, there are more facilities for the waves, virtually any natural agent to do its work; Because when the weakened rock is cut, the base of the hard rock in contact with it also becomes weak and its personal hardness decreases
 laharon ke prabhaavavash chattaanon ke tuutane se vividh aakaar ke tukdon ko to lehren teji se ludhakaakar chattaanon par de maarthi hai, jisase ve swayan bhi tuutakar chote tathaa golmatol ho jate hai
 This increases the power to hit the sea even more
 kalantar main tukade bajri main parivartit ho jate hai
 After that, the waves do not let them rest for a moment, constantly moving back and forth with them
 falat: kuch samay baad bajri ke tukade bahut maheen or ekadam golakaar ho jate hai, kabhi kabhi itane chote ki tah main baith bhi nahin pate or pani main latake rah jate hai
 In this way the force of the particles to be small and galloping is far greater than that of the river, because the speed of rubbing in the bottom of the river is only in one direction, towards the flow of the river, the other is in the lower part of the river valley
 When the edge is reduced, large particles remain as they are, and thus their action of progressively smaller stops
 jowarbhata or anya prakaar se utpann hui samudri dharaayen bhi laharon ke kaam main sahyog detii hai
 They have a particularly notable effect in the narrow valleys of the rivers near the confluence, where tidal currents cause strong currents that attempt to decay the sandy ridges and submerged rocks in the water
 ye dharaayen mitti or baaluu ko nadi ke muhane tathaa samast samudratat ke paas se bich samudr kii ore bahut dur tak baha le jaati hai
 The impact of the impact of waves is not limited to the land above the surface of the water, but also to the bottom of the shallow parts of the sea
 anubhav se maaloom hota he ki praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai tak unki kshay karne kii shakti kaaryshil rahati he
 The work of waves below the surface is often the same as that of cutting out the growing grass, that is to say, the waves try to create a flat spot by removing the disparity in the height of the rocks submerged in the sea by their shock
 
 sthaan sthaan par samudr kii gaharaai naapane se maaloom hota he ki samast bhubhag ke chaaron ore praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai par ek chauras maidan sa he
 This plain is called the sea cover
 samudr or jhiilon ke prakritik gunon main keval aakaar kaa hi antar he
 The sea is a very small reservoir, where there is a very large and bottomless reservoir
 isi se jhil main uthi tarangon kaa veg evam jowarbhate kaa pariman samudr kii apeksha ati laghu hota he
 As a result, the erosive action of the lake towards the earth is often similar to that of the sea, only its quantity becomes smaller according to the size of the lake
 uparyukt vivaran main vibhinn prakritik karkon kii apardi or anaachhadi kriya evam usase utpann avsaad ityadi ke parivahan kaa vrut bataaya gaya he
 It is worth noting here that the scope of each factor is unique
 vah apni kriya se utpann aparadit evam apaghatit padaarth ko apane kriyakshetra ke sabase nichle sthaan tak le jaataa he, jahaan se samay evam vaataavaran ke anusaar doosraa kaarak use apane prabhaav main lekar apane kriyakshetra kii sabase neeche kii sataha tak le jaataa he
 For example, the decomposed material produced by the action of rainwater reaches the river through small streams and drains and then the river carries it to the sea or lake
 is prakaar tushaar dwaara utpann shailakhand gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se pahari ke tal main pahonchte hai or phir jab tak vah kisi anya kaarak ke prabhaav main na aa jaayan, vahiin sanchit pade rahete hai
 The glacier carries the depression created by its action to its melting point
 vahaan uskaa prabhavakshetra samaapt ho jaataa he or phir vah avsaad nadi ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he
 The lowest place of Bhuprishta is the sea
 at: shailon ke apradan or apghaton se utpann avsaad kaa antim thikaana samudr hi he
 Due to the state of matter, it may be that this substance stops moving for some time at some place on the road; Nevertheless, late in the morning, sometimes at a slow pace, sometimes at a fast pace, he keeps traveling towards the sea
 avsaad ko samudr tak pahunchne kaa sabase adhik bhaar nadi ke upar he
 It has been mentioned earlier that the river has the power to classify its transported material into gravel, sand, soil etc
 on the basis of its size
 at: adhikansh avsaad motaa, madhyam or maheen teen virgon main vibhakt ho jaataa he, jo kramash: tat se adhikadhik duuri par jaakar nickshepit hote hai, arthath ek hi str ke tat ke nikatwale bhaag main kan bade or duuravaale bhaag main maheen or chote honge
 At any one place as the depression accumulates in greater quantity, the water there will also be relatively shallow and consequently the velocity of the torrent will also increase slightly
 at: samast avsaad pehle kii apeksha kuch duuri par jaakar avakshepit hoga or prayek sthaan par sanchit avsaad kuch motaa ho jayega, yatha chote kankadon tathaa bajri ke upar moti baaluu, moti ke upar maheen baaluu or maheen baaluu ke upar mitti jamaa hogi
 After some time, due to accumulation of more depression, the entire area will become more shallow again and then the deposition of depression will again reach one step further
 yadi kisi kaaran uparyukt nickshepan centre main samudr kii tah dhire dhire khiskkar nichi hone lage or khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati ke baraabar ho to adhikadhik avsaad ke sanchit hone ke baad bhi samudr kii antat: gaharaai jyon kii tyon bani rahegi or prayek sthaan par ek hi aakaar ke kanon kaa nickshepan chirkaal tak aviraam hota rahegaa
 Another condition can also occur when the speed of sliding of the bottom of the sea exceeds the speed of accumulation of depression
 us avasthaa main prabhaav ulta hoga or avsaad ke sanchit hone par bhi samudr adhikadhik gaharaa hota jayega
 As a result, the location of deposition of particles of different sizes will progressively move towards each step
 uparyukt pehali or teesri sthitiyon main vibhinn aakaar kii raashiyon kaa ekantaran hota he or duusari sthiti main samaan aakaar kaa avsaad moti moti raashiyon main sanchit ho jaataa he
 The amount of sedimentation brought by most rivers is very low in rainfall seasons
 at: varshakaal main avsaad bahut prachur maatra main samudr main nickshepit hota he
 Often the amount of depression accumulated in the period between two successive rainfall seasons is negligible
 aisi sthiti main avsaad sanchayan ruuk rukkar hota he or ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad ko duusari ritu ke avsaad ke aane ke purv kuch kadaa hone tathaa dab jane kaa avasar mil jaataa he
