 Its originator is believed to be Aghornath Shiva himself

 Abroad, especially in Iran, such old views are also known and some scholars of the West have also discussed them

 Its three branches are famous by the names of Auaghar, Sarabhangi and Ghurre, the first of which was Kallusinh and Kaluram, who was the guru of Baba Kinaram
 kuch log is panth ko guru gorakhnath ke bhi pehle se prachlit batalaate hai or iskaa sambandh shaiva mat ke pashupat athwa kalamukh sampradaay ke saath jodate hai
 Baba Kinaram Aghori was born in the village of Samagarh in present-day Benaras district and lived in a depressed sense since childhood
 inhone pehle baba shivaraam vaishnav se diksha lee thi, kintu ve phir girnaar ke kisi mahatma dwaara bhi prabhavit ho gaye
 That Mahatma is often considered to be Guru Dattatreya, to whom he himself has made some signs
 ant main ye kaashi ke baba kaluram ke shishy ho gaye or unke ananthar krimikund par rahakar is panth ke prachaar main samay dene lage

 He died in 1826

 This cult is also commonly called 'ouddhpant'
 ‘viveksaar’ is panth kaa ek pramukh granth he jisamen baba kinaaraam ne atmaram kii vandana or apane aatmanubhav kii charchaa kii he

 People who associate themselves with this cult by referring to themselves as 'aghori' or 'aughdar', are mostly seen embalming, eating corpse, drinking liquor in its skull, and behaving in disgusting things, which is probably the influence of Kapalikas

 He started his life from slavery and did not become the Shah of Persia, but he drove the powerful enemy Osmani Empire and the Russian Empire out of Iranian territories at that time
 usne afshari vansh kii sthapana kii thi or uskaa udai us samay hua jab iran main pashchim se osmani samrajya kaa akraman ho rahaa tha or purab se afagaanon ne safaavi rajdhani isiahaan par adhikaar kar liya tha
 Russia was also planning an empire expansion in Persia from the north

 He had also embarked on the campaign of Bharat Vijay
 dilli kii satta par asin mogul badshaah mohammad shah alam ko haraane ke baad usne vahaan se apaar sampatti arjeet kii jisamen kohinoor hira bhi shaamil tha
 After that he became immensely powerful and his health also deteriorated
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main wo bahut atyaachaari ban gaya tha
 After his assassination in 1747, his empire soon disintegrated
 nadir kaa janm khorasaan main afshaar qazalbus kabeeley main ek saadhaaran parivaar main hua tha
 Her father was an ordinary farmer, who died during the childhood of Nadir
 nadir ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki uski maan ko uske saath uzbekon ne das bana liya tha
 But Nadir was able to escape and he joined an officer clan and within a few days became the head of one of his sections
 jald hi wo ek safal sainik ke rup main ubhara or usne ek sthaneey pradhan baba ali beg kii do betiyon se shaadi kar lee
 Nadir was a young man with a tall, elegant and shiny black eyes
 wo apane shatruon ke prati nirday tha lekin apane anucharon or sainikon ke prati udaar
 He loved horse riding and was very fond of horses
 uski awaz bahut gambheer thi or ye bhi uski safalataa kii kai vazahon main se ek mana jaataa he
 He was a Turkmen and his clan had greatly assisted the Safavis since the time of Shah Ismail I
 us samay faras kii gaddi par safaviyon kaa shashan tha
 But Nadir Shah's future was not due to Shah's coup which is often with many successful generals
 usne safaviyon kaa saath diya
 At that time, Safavi was very happy to find Nadir Shah in his decadent empire
 ek taraf se osmani samrajya to duusari taraf se afagaanon ke vidroh ne safaviyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha
 Apart from this, the Russian Empire was also eyeing from the north
 shah sultan hossain ke bete tahmaasya ko nadir kaa saath mila
 Together with him, he drove the Afghans out of Mashhad in northern Iran and took them under his control
 uski is seva se prabhavit hokar use tahmaasya quli khan kii oopaadhi mili
 It was an honor because it gave him the royal name
 par nadir itane par santusht ho jane vaala senanayake nahin tha
 Nadir then defeated the Abdali Afghans of Herat
 tahmaashp ke darbar main apni sthiti sudrudh karne ke baad usne 1729 main rajdhani isiahaan par kabza kar chuke afagaanon par akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 At this time Basil Vatatzes, a Greek merchant and tourist, had seen the military exercises of Nadir
 usne bayaan kiya - nadir abhyaas kshetra main ghusane ke baad apane senapatiyon ke abhivadan kii sweekruti main apana sar jhukaata tha
 After that he used to stop his horse and observe the army silently for some time
 wo abhyaas aarambh hone kii anumati detaa tha
 After this the practice started - chakra, array of composition and horse riding etc 

 Nadir himself practiced on horse for three hours
 san 1729 ke ant tak usne afagaanon ko teen baar haraaya or isiahaan waapas apane niyantran main le liya
 He allowed the Afghans to flee safely
 iske baad usne baari sainya abhiyaan kii yojana banaai
 For which he forced Shah Tahmashp to collect the tax
 pashchim kii disha se osmani turk prabhutv main the
 Until now, Nadir's expeditions were confined to northern, central and eastern Iran and adjoining Afghanistan
 usne osmanion ko pashchim se maar bhagaaya or uske turant baad vah purab main heraat kii taraf badha jahaan par usne heraat par niyantran kar liya
 His military success was not seen from Tehmashp
 use takhtapalat kaa dar hone laga
 He resumed the war with the Osman with the aim of proving his military worthiness, which ended up embarrassing him and he had to return some of the territories Usman had won
 nadir jab heraat se lautaa to yah dekhakar kshubdh hua
 He sought his support from the public
 isi samay usne isiahaan main ek din tahmaashp ko nashe kii haalat main ye samajhaayaa ki wo shashan ke liye ayogy he or uske ye ishaare par darbariyon ne tahmaashp ke nanhen bete abbaas ko gaddi par bitha diya
 At the time of his coronation, Nadir announced that he would defeat the rulers of Kandahar, Delhi, Bukhara and Istanbul
 darbar main upasthit logon ko laga ki yah charam atmapravanchanaa ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 But in time to come, he came to know that it was not so
 usne pashchim kii disha main osmanon par akraman ke liye sena taiyaar kii
 But he was defeated in his first attack
 osmanon ne baghdad kii raksha ke liye ek baari sena bhej di jiskaa nadir koi jabaab nahin de paaya
 But within a few months he reorganized the army
 is baar usne kirkuk ke paas osmanion ko haraa diya
 In June 1735 near Yerevan he defeated the Osmanis once again with the help of the Russians
 is samjhaute ke tahat roosi bhi farsi pradeshon se waapas kooch kar gaye
 Nadir declared himself Shah in 1736 in front of his generals, governors and many supporters
 iran ke dharmik itihaas main shiya islam or sunniyon dwaara unpar dhaae julm kaa bahut mahatva he
 The Safawis were Shia and under them the Shia people got rid of the atrocities of the Arabs
 aaj iran kii janata shiya he or vahaan shuruaati teen khalifaaon ko gaali dene kii parampara he
 Nadir Shah, while holding his throne, placed a condition that people would give up this disrespect towards those Caliphs
 isse use faaydaa bhi mila
 Shia Sunni tension in Iran not only decreased but at the same time Iran was seen as another center of Islam
 nadir armeniyon ke saath bhi udaar dharmik sambandh rakhata tha
 His rule was a time of peace for the Jews as well
 apane samrajya ke andar usne sunni mazahab ko janata par ladane kii koi koshish nahin ki lekin samrajya ke baahar wo sunni parivartit rajya ke shah ke rup main janaa jane laga
 It began to be compared to the Osmani empire, which was the Surveyor of Islam at that time
 makka us samay osmanion ke hi adheen tha
 After being satisfied in the direction of the west, Nadir Shah shifted his focus towards the east
 sainya kharch kaa bhaar janata par padaa
 He took control of Kandahar
 is baat kaa bahaanaa bana kar ki mughalon ne afagaan bhagodon ko sharan de rakhi he usne mughal samrajya kii ore kooch kiya
 After capturing Kabul, he invaded Delhi
 karnal main mughal raja mohammad shah or nadir kii sena ke bich ladaai hui
 In this, Nadir's army was smaller than the Mughals, but the Persian army won because of its landmines
 uske march 1739 main dilli pahunchne par yah afawaah faili ki nadir shah maaraa gaya
 This caused a stampede in Delhi and the Persian army was killed
 usne iskaa badla lene ke liye dilli main bhayanak khoonkhraba kiya or ek din main koi 20,000 - 22,000 log maar die
 Apart from this, he also took a lot of money from Shah
 mohammad shah ne sindhu nadi ke pashchim kii sari bhoomi bhi nadir shah ko daan main de di
 He was also presented with a volley of diamond jewels which included Cohenoor, dariya-noor and taj-e-mah, each with their own bloody story
 nadir ko jo smapda mili wo kareeb 70 karod rupayon kii thi
 This amount was comparable to the erstwhile Seven Year War in which the French government gave the Austrian government
 nadir ne dilli main samrajya vistaar kaa lakshya nahin rakhaa
 His aim was to collect the necessary funds for his army which he got
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli se lautne par uske paas itnaa dhan ho gaya tha ki agle teen varshon tak usne janata se kar nahin liya tha
 On his return from Delhi, he learns that his son Raza Quli, whom he had made as the voicerai in his absence, has killed Safavi Shah Tahamashap and Abbas
 isse usko bhanak mili ki raza uske kilaaf bhi shadyantra rach rahaa he
 With this fear, he removed Raza from the Viceroy
 iske baad wo turkestan ke abhiyaan par gaya or uske baad dagestan ke vidroh ko daman karne niklaa
 But he did not get success here
 lezgon ne khandak yuddh niti apanaai or rashad ke kaaravaan par akraman kar nadir ko pareshaan kar daalaa
 While he was in Dagestan, Nadir received the news that Raza was planning to kill him
 isse wo kshubdh hua or usne raza ko andhaa kar diya
 Raza said that she is innocent but Nadir did not listen to her
 lekin kuch hi din baad nadir ko apni galati par khed hua
 By this time Nadir had fallen ill and was very upset to blind his son
 nadir shah ne aadesh diya ki un saradaaron ke sir uda die jaayen jinhone uske bete raza quli kii ankhen phodi jate dekha he
 Nadir Shah blamed the chieftains for why none of them said that his eyes should be blown instead of Raza Quli
 dagestan kii asafalataa bhi use khaae ja rahi thi
 Gradually he became more tyrannical
 usne dagestan se khaali haath waapas lautne ke baad usne apni sena ek bahut puraane lakshya ke liye phir se sangathit kii - pashchim kaa osmani samrajya
 At that time when the army was organized it was counted as 3,75,000 soldiers
 itani badi sena us samay shaayad hi kisi samrajya ke paas ho
 Iran's own army has never been so big before the Iran - Iraq war of 1980 - 1988
 san 1743 main usne osmani samrajya iraq par hamalaa kiya
 He did not face much opposition except in cities
 kirkuk par uskaa adhikaar ho gaya lekin baghdad or basra main use safalataa nahin mili
 His ambition came to an end in Mosul and he had to compromise with Osman
 nadir ko ye samaj main aayaa ki osmani uske niyantran main nahin aa sakate
 New Usmani troops were sent against him
 nadir shah ke bete nasirullah ne inamen se ek ko haraaya jabaki nadir ne yerawan ke nikat 1745 main ek duusare jatthe ko haraaya
 But this was his last big victory
 isamen osmanon ne use nazaf par shashan kaa adhikaar diya
 Nadir's end was beset by his illnesses
 vah dinanudin biimaar, atyaachaari or kattar ho chalaa tha
 In his last days he imposed heavy taxes on the public and even started demanding money from his close relatives
 uskaa sainya kharch kaafii bad gaya tha
 His nephew, Ali Quli, refused to obey his orders
 19 june 1747 main mashhad ke nikat uske apane hi angrakshakon ne uski hatya kar daali
 Nadir Shah's achievements could not last long
 uske marane ke baad ali quli ne swayan ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 He named his name Adil Shah
 nadir ke marane ke baad sena teetar bitar ho gai or samrajya ko kshatrapon ne swatantra rup se shashan karnaa shuru kar diya
 European influence also increased
 nadir ko europe main ek vijeta ke rup main khyaati mili thi
 In 1768, Christian VII of Denmark ordered Sir William Jones to translate his biography written by Persian historian Mirza Mahdi Astarabadali into Persian from French
 1739 main uski bharat vijay ke baad angrezon ko mughalon kii kamazori kaa pataa chalaa or unhone bharat main samrajya vistaar ko ek mauka samaj kar damakham lagaakar koshish kii
 If Nadir Shah did not invade India, the British might not even think of taking possession of India in this way or challenge Indian rule on such a large scale
 da parasyut of hepiness 2006 main bani gabriel muchino dwaara nirdeshit ek america jeevani naatak film he jo kris gardenar ke jivan par aadhaarit he

 In 1981, Chris Gardner in San Francisco invests his family's accumulated capital into a portable bone density scanner that he tries to show and sell to doctors
 yah nivesh bahut mahangaa sabit hota he jo parivaar ko aarthik rup se tod detaa he or jiske parinaam swaroop uski patni linda use or apane putr christopher ko chhod kar neuyork chali jaati he
 While trying to sell one of his scanners in the city, Chris meets Dean Vetter's manager and impresses him by solving a Rubik's Cube during a short taxi trip
 yah nayaa sambandh use ek intern share dalal banane kaa mauka detaa he, lekin vah use tab lagbhag nakaar detaa he jab use pataa chalata he ki yah kaam avaitnaik he
 Chris is further shocked when money is withdrawn from his bank account for taxes paid by the IRS and he and his young son are evicted
 parinamswaroop ve beghar ho jate hai or ek samay par bart stesan ke ek bathroom main rahane ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 Inspired by this, he visits the refuge of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, which was primarily a homeless shelter for single mothers and their children

 He also spent one night in jail for imposing a parking ticket on his owner's car
 An expensive bone scanner is stolen and damaged by a madman, but Chris eventually finds it back and repairs it
 apane kaam ke simit samay se pareshaan or yah jaanate hue ki apane graahak sampark or laabh ko badhanaa hi keval us bhugtanit pad tak pahunchane kaa ek maatr zariyaa he jiske liye vah or uske 19 pratiyogi lard rahe hai, kris apane phone cell kaalon ko adhik kushalta se karne ke liye kai upaae viksit karata he

 Despite Chris's challenges, he never reveals his poor circumstances to his co-workers, even lending his boss's five dollars for a taxi, which was such a large sum he barely spent Could do
 apane internship ke samaapan main, kris ko apane prabandhakon ke saath ek baithak main bulaayaa jaataa he

 Mick Lasale in the San Francisco Chronicle realizes that, "the greatest surprise of this film is that it is not nonsense
" 
 
 is film kii khubsuurati isaki eemaandaaree he
 In its outline, it is not a typical success story depicted on screen, in which, after a fair interval of disappointment, success comes to a beautiful form
 iske bajaay, yah safalataa kii kahani jivan ke sabase aam dharre ko darshaati he - yah aatma ko pareshaan karne vaali vifaltaa or paraajay, khoe hue avasaron, sunishchit chijen jo nahin hui, ko darshata he, jo sabhi, dhire - dhire vajood main aane vaali mushkil se pratyaaksh jeet ke aanushanbik abhivruddhi ke saath aati he
 In other words, it all feels real "
 da neuyork times ke manohala dargis ne film ke vishay main kaha ki yah film ek yathartwaadee karshan main ek pari katha he
 
 
 An entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your mattress
 
 
 This is the same old bootstrap story, an artistically told, skillfully sold American dream
 By that calculated end, the film's production was unbroken, plain, transparent, and better introduced to Mr
 Smith's delicate expressiveness
 
 
 is aadmi kii bhavuk kahani par aap kaise pratikriya karte he yah is par nirbhar karata he ki kya aapako mistar smith or unke bete kaa abhinay behtareen laga ki aap is vichaar ko apnaanaa chahenge ki garibi, durbhaagya or bure vikalpon kaa parinaam he or safalataa virpurn pradarshan or sapanom kaa parinaam he
 " roling stone ke peter trowers ne is film ko chaar main se teen ank die ou yah tippanee kii ki, "vil smith auskar kii ore bad rahe hai
 
 
 The role requires gravity, smartness, charm, humor and a soul that is not artificial
 Smith represents the same
 vah pakkaa sauda he
 " verieti main, bryan loweri ne kaha ki yah film "jitani rachanaatmak rup se prerit he usase adhik preranadayak he - ek tarah ke utthan, skool pashchaat vishesh gun jo bade paimaane par daanton ke dard ko shuru kar saktaa he se ot prot he
 
 
 It is easy to praise Smith's passionate performance
 lekin film kaa dardanaak bayaan darshakon ke us tabake par apni apil chhod sakati he jinhonen, beshak, kai durbal tivi filmon ko hit tak pahunchaa diya 
 
 
 antim lekhankan main, kuch-kuch swayam nishchayi celsman mistar gardenar kii tarah hota hua samaapt hota he: jiskaa jad pakadana aasaan he, nishchit rup se, lekin iske saath samay bitaana utana mazedaar nahin he
 " los angeles times ke kevin crust ne kaha, "naatakeey rup se isamen craimar varses craimar jaise charan nahin he, jiske vah alpagyata se samaan dikhta he

 Many tambaaku ek prakaar ke nicotiana prajati ke ped ke patton ko sukha kar nasha karne kii vastu banaai jaati he
 Actually tobacco is a sweet poison, a slow poison
 It takes a man's life slowly
 sarkaar ko bhi shaayad yah pataa nahin ki tambaaku se vah rajasav praapt kerani he, yah baat to sahi he kintu yah bhi sahi he ki tambaaku se utpann rogon ke ilaaj par jitna kharch kiya jaataa he, yah rajasav usase kahin kam he
 The biggest thing is that the consumption of tobacco also causes loss of biographical power
 vyakti ko pataa chal jaataa he ki tambaaku kaa seven hanikaarak he kintu baad main lakh chhudaane par bhi yah lat chhootati nahin
 So gradually the biographical power in him also decreases and he even surrenders himself to destruction in a way
 yah sarvavidit he ki puure sansar main tambaaku kaa durupyog cigarette ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in India in other forms
 jaise bidi, hukka, gul, gudaku, zarda, kimam, kheni, gutkha aadi ke rup main
 Tobacco should be used in any form, it causes side effects on the body
 bharat main istemaal kiye jane vaale tambaaku kai prakaar ke hote he:- When tobacco is used as gul, gudaku, or khaini, it can cause many diseases in the mouth
 safed daag, munh kaa nahin khul paanaa, tathaa cancer rog bhi ho saktaa he
 Beedi-cigarette smoking has widespread effects in the body
 iske kaaran hriday ke dhamniyon main rakt pravaah kam ho saktaa he
 Heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and anemia may occur
 raktchaap bad saktaa he
 Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer can occur
 iske atirikt iskaa prabhaav sharir ke snayutantr main padataa he
 It has many other disadvantages
 kishoravastha main utsukata vash yaa mitron ke saath in padaartho kaa seven shuru hota he phir iske nasha kaa anand aane lagata he
 Its quantity is increased
 jo log baar-baar log iskaa seven karte he, unka sharir is maadak padaarth kaa aadi ho jaataa he or phir vah usko chhod nahin pate
 Quitting causes many symptoms such as restlessness, nervousness
 is kaaran log iske aadi ho jate he, usee prakaar jaise log sharaab yaa anya padaarthon ke aadi ho jate he or jab koi kisi padaarth kaa aadi ho jaae to uskaa niyamit seven uski baadhyataa ho jaati he
 Cigarette smokers are not only causing physical harm to themselves by cigarettes but also indirectly causing tobacco poisoning in family and children
 yah sab jaanate hue bhi vah inkaa seven band nahi kar pate
 Whenever they stop consuming it, they feel so uneasy that they start consuming them again
 iske liye aavashyakta he ki vyakti khud ko taiyaar kare ki vah ek nishchit din se dhumrapan karnaa band kar degaa
 Announce it to the whole family
 nishchit din ke pehle ghar se cigarette paauch, ashtray, aadi dhumrapan vastuon ko phenk de
 Stop smoking on a certain day
 yadi dhumrapan karne kii ichha ho to apane ko santvawna de
 Drink more and more water
 aisa karke aap dhumrapan karnaa chhod sakate hai
 a lot of it depends on your will power
 kheni, zarda khaanaa yaa gul, gudaku kaa adhik prayog kisi bhi tarah dhumrapan ke upyog se alag nahi he
 If one wants to give up these substances, then he can prepare himself and get rid of the habits of these substances by willpower
 jab koi vyakti chaah kar bhi tambaaku tathaa usase sambandhit maadak padaarth band nahi kar paye or yadi vah is vishay main bahut gambhir he to iske liye si

 maury vansh kii shakti ke shithil hone par jab magadh samrajya ke anek sudurvarti pradesh maury samraaton kii adheenta se mukt hone lage, to kaling bhi swatantra ho gaya
 Three miles from Bhubaneswar in Odisha, there is a hill named Udayagiri, in whose cave an inscription is available, which is famous as 'hathigumpha Inscription'
 ise kalingraj kharvel ne utkeern karaayaa tha
 This article is in Prakrit language and has great importance for ancient Indian history
 iske anusaar kaling ke swatantra rajya ke raja pracheen 'ail vansh' ke cheti yaa chedi kshatriya the
 In the Chedi dynasty there was a majestic king named 'mahamedhavahana', who took advantage of the weakness of the Mauryas and established his independent rule in Kalinga
 mahamedhvahan kii teesri peedi main kharvel hua, jiskaa vrittant hathigumpha shilaalekh main vishad ke rup se ullikhit he
 Kharavel was a follower of Jainism and probably during his time the majority of the Kalinga people had also adopted the religion of Vardhaman Mahavira
 hathigumpha ke shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ke jivan ke pehle pandraa varsh vidya ke adhyayan main vyateet hue
 During this period, he received the education of religion, meaning, governance, mudradhati, law, arsenal etc
 pandraa saal kii aayu main vah yuvaraj ke pad par niyukt hua or nau varsh tak is pad par rahane ke uparant choubees varsh kii aayu main vah kaling ke rajsinghaasana par arudh hua
 On becoming king, he held the titles of 'kalingadhipati' and 'kalinga Chakravarti'
 rajbhishek ke duusare varsh usne pashchim kii ore akraman kiya or raja satkarni kii upeksha kar kanavena ke tat par sthit moosik nagar ko usne trast kiya
 Satakarni was the Satavahana king and had an independent kingdom in Andhra Pradesh
 mauryon kii adheenta se mukt hokar jo pradesh swatantra ho gaye the, andhra bhi unamem se ek tha
 In the fourth year of his reign, Kharavel once again invaded the west and subjugated the Bhojakas and the charioteers
 bhojakon kii sthiti baraar ke kshetra main thi or rathikon kii purvi khandesh va ahmednagar main
 rathik-bhojakas were probably such Kshatriya clans, like the ancient blind-women who had their own republics
 ye ganraajya sambhavtah satvahanon kii adheenta sweekrut karte the
 In the eighth year of his reign, Kharavel traveled northwards to Vijay
 uttarapath main aage badhati hui uski sena ne baraabar pahadiyon main sthit gorthgiri ke durg par akraman kiya or use jitkar ve rajgrih pahunch gai
 While Kharavel was busy in these wars, the Yavanas of Bactria were also invading India
 bharat ke pashchim chakra ko apane adheen kar ve madhya desh main pahunch gaye the
 According to the article of Hathigumpha, Yavanaraja was frightened by the news of Kharavel's victories and left the idea of invading Madhya Pradesh and proceeded towards Mathura
 anek aitihaasikon ne yah pratipaadit kiya he, ki kharvel se bhaybheet hokar madhyadesh se waapas chale jane vaale is yavanraaja kaa naam dimit tha
 In the eleventh year of his reign, Kharavel invaded the south and reached the Tamil country on his Vijayatra
 vahaan par usne pithund ko jeeta or uske raja ko bhent uphaar pradaan karne ke liye vivash kiya
 The inscription of Hathigumpha mentions the confederation of the Tamil country defeated by Kharavel
 apane shasankaal ke gyarahawein varsh main kharvel ne ek baar phir uttarapath par akraman kiya or apni sena ke ghodon or haathiyon ko gangaajal snaan karaayaa
 He forced the king of Magadha to fall at his feet and brought back the Kalinga, the idol of Mahavir Swami, Pataliputra, taken from King Nand Kalinga
 is murti ke atirikt anya bhi bahut—si lut kharvel magadh se apane rajya main le gaya or uskaa upyog usne bhubaneshwar main ek vishaal mandir ke nirmaan ke liye kiya, jiskaa ullekh brahmand puraana kii urisa main praapt ek hastlikhit prati main bhi vidyaman he
 According to many historians, the king of Magadha who was forced by Kharavel to fall on his feet was debated
 unhone hathigumpha shilaalekh main is raja ke naam ko padhane kaa praytn bhi kiya he
 But not all scholars agree with this text
 shri jaiswal ne hathigumpha shilaalekh main ullikhit magadh ke raja ke naam ko bahestimit maanakar use pushyamitra shunga kaa paryaayavachi pratipaadit kiya he or yah mana he ki kalingraj kharvel ne shungavanshi pushyamitra par akraman kar use parrast kiya tha
 But many are not willing to accept the name in the historical Hathigumpha, nor to confuse it with Pushyamitra
 par isamen sandeh nahin ki hathigumpha shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ne uttarapath par akraman karte hue magadh kii bhi vijay kii thi or vahaan ke raja ko apane sammukh jhukne ke liye vivash kiya tha
 This story of Digvijay and the flourishing of Kharavel's power is undoubtedly of great importance

 baad ke anya nau sarg anya kavi kii rachana he
 Some people believe that the poem ends in eight cantos only with the premonition of Kumar's birth with Shivparvati Samagam
 kuch log kehete hai ki aathven sarg main shivparvati ke sambhog kaa varnan karne ke kaaran kalidas ko kusht ho gaya or ve likh na sake
 There is also a view that his intercourse is not interested in the public, so he did not write further
 isamen varnit katha sankshep main is prakaar he- Parvatraj was the son of Manak of Himalayas and a girl named Gauri
 kanya parvati or uma naam se bhi vikhyath hui
 When Kanya was born, Narada came to her house one day and predicted that the girl would be married to Shiva
 yah bhavishyavaanee sunakar himalay niïshchat ho gaye
 On the other hand, Shiva was doing penance at the peak of the Himalayas
 himalay ne ek sakhi ke saath uma ko unki paricharya ke liye bhej diya or uma bhakthibhaav se shiv kii seva karne lagi
 In those days, the gods were defeated in the battle with Tarakasura
 daitya anek prakaar ke chal karne laga
 Then all the gods including Indra came to Brahma
 tarakasur ke nimit yogya senapati kii maang kii
 Then the brahura said that only a man born with Shankar's semen can be your worthy general
 isliye tum log prayaas karo jisase shiv parvati ke prati aasakt hon
 If Shiva accepted Parvati, then if you have a son with Parvati, then you will win if you become his commander
 tatpashchaat indradi devtaa shiv ke virakt bhav ko hataane ke upaay par vichaar karne ke liye ekatra hue
 When Madan came to that assembly, Indra requested him to accompany his friend Vasanth to Shiva's austerity place and enchant Shiva with Parvati
 tadnusaar madan apni patni rati or mitra vasant ko lekar shankar ke ashram main pahunchaa
 When Parvati reached near Shiva to offer the garland of Kamalbees and Shiva raised his hand to take her, Madan offered a bow to his bow
 tatkshan shiv kaa man vichlit hua
 Shankar thus looked around to find out the reason for sudden distortion of mind
 unhen sharasandhan karata madan dikhaai padaa
 Shiva became furious after seeing her; Agnijwala appeared from his third eye and Madan consumed him
 rati apane pati ko is prakaar bhasma hote dekh vilaap karne lagi or vasant se chita taiyaar karne ko kaha or swayan praan tyaagane ko taiyaar hui
 Then there was a voice in the air that you should regain your patience
 udhar shiv narisampark se bachane ke liye antardhan ho gaye
 With Madan being consumed and Shiva being impregnated, Parvati saw all her desires fail and thinking that this beauty is futile, she went to a mountain peak to appease Shiva and started doing intense penance
 kuch kaal ke ananthar shiv kaa man pighla unhone parvati ko sweekaar karne kaa vichaar kiya
 But before that he decided to test Parvati and he reached the ashram of an ascetic
 parvati ne atithi ke rup main unka samuchit satkar kiya
 Then the Tarun ascetic inquired of Parvati, for whom she was doing such austere penance
 atithi ke prashn ko sunakar parvati lajjit hui or apane manobhaav prakat karne main sankoch karne lagi tab unki sakhi ne shiv kii prapti kii ichha kii baat kahi
 Hearing this, the ascetic Shiva, condemning him by mentioning Shiva's fortifications and ugliness etc
 parvati ko yah shiv ninda nahin hui or unhe daantne lagi
 Shiva then appeared in his form and held his hand
 tatpashchaat shiv ne saptarshi ke bulaakar himalay ke paas bheja
 He told them that Shiva had expressed his desire to take Parvati's accession
 tab vivaah kaa nishchay hua or vivaah kii taiyaari hone lagi
 The Saptamatrikas brought the groom's clothes, but Shiva did not accept them all and walked on Nandi
 pashchaat vivaah kii sari kriyaayein hui
 Upon completion of the marriage, Parvati, including Shiva, bowed to the Brahmin
 brahri ne aashirwad diya
 You are a brave son
 apsaraon ne aakar var-vadhu ke sammukh ek naatak prasttut kiya
 After the play ends Indra requests Shiva to bring Madan alive
 ant main shiv or parvati ke ekant milan kii charchaa vistaar se kii gai he
 This epic has a memorable and captivating description at many places
 himalayavarnan, parvati kii tapasya, brahrichari kii shivaninda, vasant aagaman, shivparvati vivaah or ratikriya varnan adbhut anubhuti utpann karte hai
 Kalidasa's portrayal of women such as Bala Parvati, Tapaswini Parvati, Vinayavati Parvati and Pragalbha Parvati etc

 pratinidhitiv kaa boornar ke siddhanth main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Representation is the system of rules by which an individual conserves his or her experiences for future events
 yah vyakti vishesh ke liye uske sansar kaa / vaataavaran kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Representation can occur in three ways - operational representation -, visual representation), and symbolic representation
 yah pratinidhitav kii sabase praarambhik avasthaa he jo jivan ke pratham varsh ke uttararddh main paaya jaataa he
 Under this, the child reacts to environmental objects
 is prakaar kaa pratinidhitiv samvedi-gaamak avasthaa kii pahchaan he
 It focuses on the person
 atah ise aatm kendrit bhi kah sakate hai
 This distinguishes the explanation from the action
 It is only by repetition of actions that the concept of actions develops in the child's mind
 arthath kriyaaon ko sthanik paripekshya main samajhnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Thus in this representation the concept of action-free is developed
 yah pratinidhitiv pratham varsh ke ant tak purnataya viksit ho jaataa he
 It begins with an unfamiliar innate symbolic action, which later transforms into various arrangements
 kriya or avadharana pratikaatmak kriyavidhi ko pradarshit kar sakati hai
 But language is the most developed form of symbolic action
 ye teenon pratinidhitiv vaise to ek duusare se pruthak va swatantra hai kintu yah ek duusare main parivartit bhi ho sakate he
 This situation occurs when the child has a dilemma and he repeats all the representations to solve his problem
 yah teen prakaar se ho saktaa he - milan dwaara, bemilan dwaara tathaa ek duusare se swatantra rahakar
 If the two representations match, then the person does not have any dilemma and he resolves his problems by performing normal procedures
 jab do pratinidhitiv main bemilan hota he to kisi ek main sudhaar kiya jaataa he yaa use dabaa kar diya jaataa he
 In early adolescence this dilemma lies between action and visual arrangement in which they have to choose one or the other
 baar-baar samasya samaadhaan karte-karte unamem praathamikta kaa vikaas hota he
 Action and representation cannot be independent from each other, but symbolic representation can be independent of both of them
 pratinidhitiv ke madhyam ke rup main bhashaa anubhav se alag hoti he or jab yah anubhav or chintan ke aadhaar par prayog kiya jaataa he to ucch str kii maansik kriyaaon ko karne main sakasham hoti he
