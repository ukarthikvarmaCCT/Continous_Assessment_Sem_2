doorabeen se dikhne vaale cinemai drishy jisamen do aanshik rup se aachhadit aath kii sankhya ke gole jaise dikhte hai, aisa vaastaviktaa main nahin hota he
 Misalignment is often corrected by moving the prisms slightly without moving the telescopes or by changing the position of the object, for which there are decentralized bangles outside the surface of the object
 aamtaur par sanrekhan kisi peshewar dwaara kiya jaataa he haalanki sanrekhan trutiyon ko pahchaanane tathaa unhen sanrekhit karne ke liye nirdesh internet par bhi mil jate hai
 An ordinary telescope uses 6 to 10 optical elements that are uniquely used, and glass-to-air contact surfaces can be up to 16, so telescope manufacturers have to use a variety of optical coatings for technical reasons The image quality obtained from the device can be enhanced
 pratek sataha par paravartan ke kaaran hone vaali prakaash kii haani ko anti-recolactive coating se kam kiya jaataa he
 The "lost" light inside the telescope through the anti-reflective coating, which can blur the image obtained, is minimized
 8x40 kii doorabeen jisamen acchhee optical coating kaa prayog hua ho, bina coating vaali 8x50 doorabeen se behatar tathaa ujjwal chhavi prastut kar sakati he
 a traditional lens coating material is magnesium fluoride which reduces reflectivity from 5% to 1%
 aadhunik lens coating jatil bahu-paraton se milakar banati he or keval 0
25% yaa usase kam pratibimbit karti he, saath hi adhiktam chamak or prakritik rangon ke saath ek acchhee chhavi detii he
 In binoculars with a roof prism, the light is split into two paths that reflect from either side of the roof prism's back
 aadha prakaash ruf kii sataha 1 se sataha 2 par paravartit hota he
 The remaining half of the light is reflected from surface 2 to surface 1
 is kaaran prakaash aanshik rup se polaraise ho jaataa he 
 iske aage hone vaale parvartanon se iskaa polaraise sadish badalata he parantu yah prayek path main phokalt pendulum ke sadrush badalata he
 When the light going on different paths is found, then the polarized vector of each path does not match
 polaraise sadishon ke bich ke kone ko fez shift yaa jyamitiya fez athwa beri fez kaha jaataa he
 The distribution of varying intensities in the image is obtained by colliding different paths with different geometric phases, reducing the contrast and resolution obtained with the poro prism system
 ruf prism kii ruf sataha par in avaanchit hastkshep prabhaav ko kam karne hetu kuch vishesh dividyutiya coating padaarthon kaa vaashp nirupan kiya jaataa he, in padaarthon ko fez-sudhaar coating athwa pi-coating kehete hai
 This coating corrects the difference in geometrical phase between two paths and converts the light coming from both paths into a single phase, which prevents image collisions due to collisions
 shmit-pechan ruf prism athwa ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog kar rahi doorabine fez coating se vishesh rup se labhanvit hoti hai
 Poro prism based telescopes do not reassemble the light rays coming from different paths and hence do not have any special benefit from phase coating
 shmit-pechan ruf prism kaa prayog kar rahi doorabeenon main ruf prism kii satahon ko darpan coating kiya jaataa he taaki uski kisi ek sataha par pad rahaa prakaash yadi seemaant kone se kam par pade to uskaa sampoorn aatanrik paravartan na ho jaye
 darpan coating ke bina adhikansh prakaash kii kshati ho jaaegi
 shmit-pechan ruf prism main aluminium darpan coating athwa rajat darpan coating kaa prayog hota he
 Silver mirrors were coated in older designs but were oxidized in unsealed telescopes and lost reflectivity
 baad main bina sil kii gayi diginon main aluminium darpan coating kaa istemaal kiya gaya kyonki yah dhoomil nahin padataa he, haalanki yah chaandi kii tulana main kam paravartaneeyata detaa he
 Modern designs use either aluminum or silver
 aadhunik ucch gunvattta vaali diginon main chaandi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, inamen nitrogen athwa argon se bhar kar sil kar diya jaataa he jisase rajat darpan coating kabhi dhoomil nahin padatin
 Telescopes with poro prisms and roof prisms that use the abbe-k√∂nig roof prism do not have to use a mirror coating as these prisms achieve 100% reflectivity from the entire internal reflection
 daai-electric darpan coating kaa prayog shmit-pechan ruf prism main daai-electric darpan kaa prabhaav paidaa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Template: To create a Jargon non-metallic die-electric mirror coating, elements with high and low refraction index are deposited alternately on the reflective surface of the roof prism
 prayek ekal bahuparat prakaash, ek patale aavriti punj ko paravartit karti he jisase aisi kai paraten, isliye safed prakaash ko paravartit karne ke liye bhinn rangon main samyojit anekon bahuparat prakaash kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This multilayer coating increases reflectivity by acting as a distributed Bragg converter on the surface of the prism
 ek acchhee tarah se dizin kii gayi daai-electric coating, drishy prakaash varnakram main 99% se adhik paravartaneeyata pradaan karti he
 This reflectivity is much better than aluminum mirror coating or silver mirror coating
 poro prism tathaa ruf prism vaali doorabine jo ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog karti hai, inhen daai-electric coating kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa kyonki ye prism sampoorn aatanrik paravartan kaa prayog karte hue ati ucch paravartaneeyata praapt kar lete hai
 The presence of a coating is usually marked on the telescope by the following words: haath main pakad kar prayog kii ja sakane vaali doorabine theatre main prayukt 3X10 opera glass se lekar baahar istemaal kii ja sakane vaali 7 se 12 meter vyas aavardhan or 30 se 50 mimi objective lens vaali hoti hai
 In many tourist places, coin-operated binoculars are mounted on the stand, with the help of which they can see that tourist attraction closely
 britain main 20 pence main aamtaur par doorabeen se do minute dekhne ko miltaa he jabaki sanyukt rajya main ek yaa do quarter main dedh se dhai minute tak dekhne diya jaataa he
 In many telescopes the reticle appears within the field of view to find the range
 yah paimaana, oonchai gyaat hone par dekhi ja rahi vastu kii duuri kaa anumaan lagane main sahaayta karata he
 In the ordinary 7X50 telescope of sailors, the distance between the scale signs express about 5 mill
 ek mil, 1000 meter kii duuri se dekhe jane par ek meter oonchi vastu ke sheersh tathaa aadhaar ke bich banane vaale kone ko kaha jaataa he
 Thus the equation for estimating the distance from an object at a known height would be as follows: jahaan: On a simple 5 mill scale, a lighthouse looking 3 signs high would actually be 120 meters high and 8000 meters away
 doorabeen ke sainya upyog kaa ek lanbaa itihaas he
 Galilean design was widely in use by the end of the 19th century and Poro prism design began to be used thereafter
 saamaanya sainya prayog ke liye banaayin gayi doorabine apni asainya samakakshon ke mukaable kahin adhik majboot banaayin jaati hai
 Independent focus is used in place of delicate central focus in military use, making it easy to make the telescope impervious to the environment and providing effective environmental adaptation
 sainya doorabeenon ke prijmon par aluminium kii atirikt coating kii jaati he jisase ki bhig jane par bhi unki parvartaneeyata kam naa ho
 Another used form of binoculars is the "trench telescope", which is a mixture of binoculars and periscopes, it is used in the detection of artillery, while using it, the soldier can see it while keeping his head below the munder
 He gets protection
 sheet yuddh kaal kii sainya doorabeenon main kai baar pasive samvedak lagaakar unhen sakriy infrared utsarjanon ko dekhne laayak bana diya jaataa he, jabaki aadhunik doorabeenon main nishpadak lage hote hai jo unhen leisure kirnon ko hathiyaar ke rup main prayog kiye jane se roktaa he
 In addition, telescopes designed for military use also have a stereometric reticle to estimate range
 samudr main prayog kiye jane hetu sainya tathaa asainya upyogon ke liye alag-alag doorabine uplabdh hai
 The telescopes that can be held in the hand are 5X or 7X, but they have large prisms as well as eyepieces that provide great comfort to the eyes
 yah optical sangyojan doorabeen ko ankhon ke saapeksh compit hone par praapt chhavi ko dhundhala hone athwa aspasht hone se bachaata he
 Large, high-magnification models with large objective lenses are made usable on a stand
 bahut badi nausainik range-finder doorabeenon kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu 20 sadi ke uttarardh kii takanic ne inkaa anuprayog anaavashyak bana diya
 Telescopes are widely used by amateur astronomers; Their wide field of view makes them particularly useful for comet and supernova watchers and for general observation
 70 mimi tathaa isse badi range kii kuch doorabine prithvi sambandhi avlokan ke anukool hoti hai; vaastavik khagoleey doorabeenon kii dizine main prijmon kaa prayog prakaash sampreshan badha kar chhavi ko sahi rup se pradarshit karne main hota he
 Such binoculars have replaceable eyepieces that can increase or reduce magnification and are not designed for waterproofing or asymmetric use
 seres, neptune, palas, titan, tathaa brihaspati ke gallilian chandramaa, jo nangi ankhon se nahin dikhaai dete, doorabeen kii sahaayta se aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai
 However, Uranus and Vesta, which can be seen without any help in the pollution free sky, can be easily seen with the help of binoculars
 10X15 kii doorabine +10 se +11 ke maan tak hi simit hoti hai or yah akaash kii sthiti va prekshak ke anubhav par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Commonly available binoculars, such as interemonia, davida, europa, and hygeia in rare circumstances, are rarely visible
 isi prakaar gallilian tathaa titon ko chhodkar grahon ke chandramaa tathaa boune grah pluto va iris adhikansh doorabeenon se bamushkil hi nazar aate hai
 Open clusters in deep sky objects look grand, such as the bright double cluster in the Perus planetarium, and spherical clusters, such as the M13 of Hercules, can be easily seen
 niharikaon main, segiterius main M17 va signs main uttari amareeki niharika enjisi 7000 ko bhi saralata se dekha ja saktaa he
 An important fact of low light and astronomical vision is the ratio of magnification power and the diameter of the optical lens
 kam aavardhan hone par drushti kshetra bad jaataa he jisase gahare akashiya vastuon, jaise akaash ganga, niharikayen, tathaa tara samoohon ko dekhnaa asana ho jaataa he, haalanki bade exit pupil se praapt prakaash ko umrdaraj anveshak puri tarah se nahin dekh pate hai kyonki 50 varsh se adhik umr waalon kii aakhen virale hi 5 mimi se zyada failati hai
 The large exit pupil makes it difficult to detect blurred objects due to the contrast in the background of the night sky, except in areas where optical pollution is negligible
 khagoleey prayog hetu banaayin gayi doorabine bade aprachar objective ke saath kaaphi santoshjanak drishy dikhaati hai 
 khagol vigyaani doorabeen aamtaur par 12

 However, astronomical objects of the Messier catalog or of eighth magnitude and above can be easily seen from usable handheld telescopes in the 30 to 40 mm range
 phir bhi khagoleey prayog ke liye bade objective vaali doorabine hi acchhee rahati hai kyoki unase praapt prakaash kii maatra adhik hone ke kaaran dhundhlee vasteen bhi aasaani se dikhaai detii hai
 Due to their high magnification and heavy weight, it is necessary to use these telescopes mounted on a stand to see a stable image
 aamtaur se das aavardhan tak kii doorabine haath main pakad kar prayog main laayi ja sakati hai, inhen stand main lagane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 shaukia doorabeen nirmaataaon dwaara isse kahin badi doorabine, do apvartan athwa paravartan khagoleey telescopon ko mila kar banaayin jaati hai
 Telescopes are made by many companies in the past and present
 inamen shaamil hai: Many tools are used for electrical and electronic work, which are used for measurement, testing, signal generation, visualization of signal etc
 The following items are used for basic measurement of voltages, currents, and components in the circuit under test
 The following devices are used to input the circuits being tested - The following analyze the response of the circuit under test: And connecting it all together: kisi bhi samasya ke bahari lakshanon se armbh karke uske mul kaaran kaa gyaan karnaa nidaan kehalaata he
 The method of diagnosis is based on 'deletion'
 nidaan shabd kaa prayog sabhi kshetron main hota he : rogopchaar, vigyaan, praudyogiki, nyaay, vyapaar, evam prabandhan aadi main
 Diagnosis is very important
 jab tak rog kii sateek pahchaan na ho jaae, tab tak sahi disha main upachaar asambhav he
 Therefore, in the old Ayurveda texts, the chapter on diagnosis was very large and treatment chapter was limited
 kaaran yah he ki yadi nidaan sateek ho gaya to upachaar bhi sateek hoga
 It is true that many diseases become good by themselves and the preventive power of nature does not require any help, but there are many diseases in which nature becomes incapable and then needs medical help
 sahi or sateek chikitsa ke liye aavashyak he ki nidaan sahi ho
 Correct diagnosis means that the underlying cause of the painful symptoms and the pathology produced by it are understood
 adikaal se manushya shaareerik or maansik vyaadhiyon se grast hota rahaa he
 The remedy to get rid of pain is called therapy
 jin logon ne is vidya kaa vishesh anubhav or adhyayan kiya he, unki ek alag shrenee ban gai he
 Initially, the cause of the disease was considered to be a divine outbreak, phantom impediment or illusion and the cure was - magic, sorcery, jantar-mantar etc
 baad main ayurveda kaa udbhav hua or tridosh siddhanth ke aadhaar par nidaan hone laga
 This theory became 'chaturdosh theory' in the West
 jab aadhunik vigyaan kaa udai hone laga tab anek nae siddhanth saamne aane lage : yakshadooshit vaataavaran, ashuddhiyaan, vish, vishaanu aadi, parantu ye sab ardhsaty the
 As a result of the all-round development of science, all branches of modern medical science developed and the era of logic and factual diagnosis began
 bharat main anek chikitsa paddatiyaan prachlit hai, atev nidaan ke bare main kaaphi bhram vyaapt he
 Once you understand one thing, this confusion will disappear
 ye sabhi paddatiyaan bhinn siddhanton par aadhaarit hai, isliye unki tulana nahin kerani chahie
 There are four stages of modern diagnosis: samasya, Fact Collection: vichaar vimarsh tathaa Decision rogi chikitsak ke paas kyon aayaa he, yah jaanane ke liye apana prashn hota he - kya takalif he? rogi yadi hosh main he to kshtdaayak lakshanon kii charchaa karata he, yadi behosh he to saath aae log bataate hai
 When are these symptoms and how did they begin, it is asked
 is prakaar chikitsak samasya kaa rup samajhataa he ki is rogi ko kya hua he, yatha teen din se sar main bheeshan dard he or iske purv koi takalif nahin thi
 Sometimes the number of complaints is many and they have to represent the organized problem
 rogi se poochtacha kaa mahatv bahut puraane jamaane se gyaat rahaa he
 It is widely mentioned in Ayurveda
 isa se sau varsh purv trozain ke rajyakaal main effesus ke rufus ne "rogi se poochtacha" naamak ek granth likhaa tha
 The stories of patients who have been written by Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, can be read and diagnosed even today
 ayurveda main to rogi hi nahin, uskaa haal laanevaale doot kii bhi pariksha kaa ullekh he
 The quiz consists of three parts: family, personal and the present story of suffering
 paariwarik - iske antargat vanshanukram kaa prabhaav, parivaar ke logon kii shareerasampatti kisi he
 Some families are of thin people, some are of monts, others are tall, some are short, what are the diseases, what are the features of the family - who are the parents or not? If not, when and due to which disease died? If the patient is married then the health of the wife, children, health of siblings, the location of the patient in the family, financial status and habits of the family etc
 ghar or vaataavaran kaisaa he? Individual - The occupation and habits of the patient are often the cause of the disease; Situation since birth; Discussion of earlier illnesses and their treatment; Knowledge of menstruation, pregnancy, abortion etc
 in women; Daily functioning and interest of the patient
 vartmaan ksht - ant main vartmaan shikayaton ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 What are the symptoms? Is it in one place or wider? Where is the pain, how is it: sweet or intense, is it in one place or it is transmitted, is happening continuously or seizures occur? How and when did the trouble begin? Detailed information about the organ with which it is suffering, such as when is there pain in the stomach, sometimes when it happens, what is related to the food, what is awake at night, how long after the meal, someone What happens on eating special things, what gives relief, if the pain does not spread, how long does it last, how can it not? e

 To be honest, only half the diagnosis is made by this inquiry
 yah vishisht kala he
 Examination begins with a general observation: the patient is conscious and has a level of knowledge, sleeping, walking style, general level of health and nutritional status, facial expressions and characters, hand size swelling of the glands, breathing speed And type, temperature, pulse test
 iske baad vibhinn avyavon kii kramase pariksha karte hai
 There are four parts to the exam: nirikshan - griddhadrushti chikitsak dur kii kaudi laata he, dwaar par pade chhilake dekhakar rogi ne kya khaaya he bataa detaa he
 It is said that Napoleon i was diagnosed by seeing a medical Corvissartnail picture

 There were three major revolutions in the world in the 18th century
 ye bhinn-bhinn deshon main avashya hui kintu inke parinaam evam prabhaav vishwa par doorgaami hue
 The first of these revolutions is the grand revolution that occurred in England
 ise 'gauravshaalee kranti' athwa 'raktahin kranti' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki is kranti main kisi bhi paksh ke vyakti ke rakt kii ek boond bhi nahin nikali or keval pradarshan evam vaartalap se hi kranti safal ho gai
 This bloodless revolution which took place in England in 1688 AD raised the demand for independence in America too
 america main shashan british sansad dwaara chalaaya jaataa tha jo americavsiyon ko sahan na tha
 They wanted to govern independently
 atah america upnivesh ne apni swatantraaa ke liye jo sangharsh kiya vahi america kranti kehalaata he
 This revolution took place in 1776 AD

 Muttuswamy started teaching religion, literature, ornamentation and mantra knowledge from his childhood and he had studied music from his father
 muttuswami ke kishoravastha main hi, unke pita ne unhen chidambaranath yogi naamak ek bhikshu ke saath tirthayatra par sangeet or darshanik gyaan praapt karne ke liye bhej diya tha
 During this pilgrimage, he visited many places in North India and got a comprehensive view on religion and music which was reflected in his many compositions
 kaashi main apane pravaas ke dauraan, unke guru chidambarnath yogi ne muttuswami ko ek adwitiya veena pradaan kii or uske sheeghra baad hi unka nidhan ho gaya

 There, while he was sitting in meditation posture, an old man came to him and asked him to open his mouth
 buudhe aadmi unke munh main shakkar kii mithai rakh gaayab ho gaya
 As he opened his mouth, he had visions of the deity Murugan, and only then did Muttuswamy sing his first composition "sri Nathadi guruguho" in the raga Meyamalavagola
 is geet ne bhagwaan ko sanskrit main pehali vibhakti main sambodhit kiya, baad main dikshit ne bhagwaan ke sabhi aath avtaron par kritiyon kii rachana kii
 These were mostly in the sub-sections praising Murugan in sect / indulgent form

 Muthuswamy Dixit had proficiency on Veena, and Veena's performance can be clearly seen in his compositions, especially in Gaman
 unki kriti balgopal main, unhone khud ko veena gayak ke rup main parichay diya
 He also majored on violin and among his disciples, along with Thanjavilu of Thanjavur quartet and his brother Baluswamy Dixit, took the lead in using violin in Carnatic music, which is now an integral part of most Carnatic artists

 Muttuswamy visited many pilgrimages and temples and saw deities

 He then made pilgrimage to many famous temples
 mana jaataa he ki dikshitar ne lagbhag 3000 se bhi adhik geeton kii rachana kii, joki dev-prashansa par yaa kisi nek bhaavana par aadhaarit thim

 Muttuswamy traveled to many holy pilgrimages throughout his life and composed creations on deities and temples
 dikshit ko devataaon ke liye sabase vistrut shrinkhalaa kaa rachiyata mana jaataa he
 Each of his works is presented in a unique and talented manner
 rachanaaen gaharaai or maadhurya kii aatma ke liye jane jate hai- kuch raagon ke lekar unki pariklpana abhi bhi unki sanrachanaon par maanya hai
 His Sanskrit songs praise the temple deity, but removing the implicit relationship between Advaita philosophy and polytheistic worship, Muthuswamy has given the origin of Advaita thought in his songs
 unke geeton main mandir ke itihaas or uski prishthbhumi ke bare main bahut jaankaree di gai he, jiske kaaran hi aaj in puraane tirthon main kai paramparaon ko banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Another important feature in his compositions is the verses versed in the lines of the songs

 jelifish ke kai alag rup hai jo scyphosoa, storosoa, cubosoa or hydrosoa sahit vibhinn niderian virgon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 In these groups, jellyfish are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, storomedusae, cubomedusae and hydromedusae
 sabhi jelifish upsang medusosoa main sannihit hai
 Medusa is another term for jellyfish and is therefore used exclusively for the adult phase of the life-cycle
 jelifish har samudr main, sataha se samudr kii gaharaai tak paae jate hai
 Some hydrozoi jellyfish, or hydromedusae, are also found in fresh water; Freshwater species are one inch in diameter, colorless and do not sting

 These are large, often colorful jellyfish, commonly found in coastal areas around the world
 apane vyapak arth main, shabd jelifish aam taur par sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko nirdisht karata he
 Although not closely related to the Niderian jellyfish, the tinophore free-swimmers are planktonic carnivores, which are generally transparent or translucent and present in shallow to deep parts of all oceans of the world
 sher ayaal jelifish sarvaadhik vikhyath jelifish hai or vivaadaaspad taur par duniya kaa sabase lanbaa jaanavar he
 Since jellyfish are not actually fish, the term jellyfish is considered a misnomer and American public aquariums have popularized the use of the words jelly or sea jelly instead
 kai anya jelifish ko, jo ek sadi se bhi zyaada samay se aam prachlan main he, utana hi upyogi or suramya maanate hai or jelly se zyaada is shabd ko pasand karte hai
 The term jellyfish is used to denote several different types of niderion, all of which have a basic anatomical appearance resembling an umbrella, including scyphozoi, storozoi, hydrozoi, and cubozoic organisms
 kuch pathyapustaken or website scyphojoi ko "asli jelifish" ke rup main sanderbhit karti hai
 In its widespread use, some scientists, when referring to jellyfish, sometimes include members of the association Tinophora

 Jellyfish "erupt" by their life-cycle nature, often produced by their perpetual polyps upon sunlight and plankton growth, causing them to appear suddenly and often in large numbers, even when the balance of the ecosystem Is made up "jhund" kaa upyog ek prakaar se saath rahane kii sakriy kshamta kaa sanket detaa he, jaise ki orelia, moon jelly kii kuch prajatiyaan pradarshit karti hai
 Many jellyfish have a second part of their life cycle, which is called the polyp phase
 jab ekal nishechit andey se utpann ek polip stolon kahalaane vaale utakon ke reshon dwaara ek-duusare se jude, anek polip gucchh main viksit hote hai, to unhen "sanghajivi" kaha jaataa he
 Some polyps never proliferate and are referred to as "unicorn" subcastes
 jelifish main vishesh pachan, paraasaran-niyantrak, kendriya tantrika, shwasan, yaa raktavahi pranaliyaan nahin hoti hai
 They digest using the gastric-lining of the gastric-vascular cavity, where nutrients are absorbed
 unhen shwasan pranali kii jarurat nahin he kyonki unki twachaa itani patali hoti he ki sharir visaran dwaara oxikaran karata he
 They have limited control over movement, but can move through the contraction-pulsing of their bellied body using a hydrostatic skeleton; Some species actively swim most of the time, while others remain inactive much of the time

 Some jellyfish also have eyespots: light-sensitive organs that do not make pictures, but which can detect light and determine the top and bottom of the water surface, reacting to sunlight
 ye aam taur par varnak bindu netrak hote hai, jinaki kuch koshikaayen ranjit hoti hai
 The presence of oceanic eruptions in response to prey availability and increased temperature and sunlight is generally seasonal

 In addition to occasionally being concentrated by ocean currents, eruption can also result in unusually high populations in a few years
 prasphuton nirmaan ek jatil prakriya he jo sagar kii dhaaraon, poshak tatwon, taapmaana, parbhakshan or oxigen sandratha par nirbhar he
 Jellyfish are better able to survive in water with less oxygen than their competitors and thus can thrive on plankton without competition
 jelifish lavniya jal se bhi labhanvit ho sakate hai, chunki lavan jal main adhik iodine hota he, jo polipon ko jelifish main badalane ke liye aavashyak he
 Rising sea temperatures due to climate change may also contribute to jellyfish eruption, as many species of jellyfish are better able to survive in warm waters

 In some places jellyfish may fill ecological niches that were previously occupied by more aquatic organisms, but noted that this hypothesis lacks supporting data
 jelifish shodhakarta marsh yangabluth aage spasht karte hai ki "jelifish ek hi prakaar ke yuva or vayask machhlee ke shikaar par poshan karte hai, isliye yadi machhlee ko sameekaran se hataa diya jaae, to jelifish dwaara vah jagah lene kii sambhaavna he

 Monty Graham of the Doffin Island Oceanographic Laboratory in Alabama states that "ecological systems, which have high levels of nutrients
 

 sookshm jeevon ke liye poshan pradaan karti hai, jinase jelifish aahaar grahan karte hai
 Water where there is hygiene often results in lower oxygen levels, favoring jellyfish since they can tolerate less oxygenated water than fish

 Areas most seriously affected by jellyfish include the northern Mexico Gulf, about which Graham says "moon jellies have formed a type of synovial mesh that extends from one end of the bay to the other
 " Jellyfish eruption causes problems for mankind
 sabase spasht maanav dank hai or samudr taton par paryaton main giravat aati he
 Other serious symptoms are destruction of fish nets, poisoning or crushing of caught fish, consumption of fish eggs and small fish

 Many jellyfish go through two different life history stages during their life cycle
 pehla polipid charan he, jab jantu poshak sparshakon ke saath ek chote danthal kaa aakaar grahan karata he; yah polip sthanbaddh ho saktaa he, jo bedon yaa naav ke tal jaisi nichali sataha yaa isi tarah ke adhbstar par jeeta he, yaa vah mukt-tairta hua yaa mukt-jivi plavak ke chote tukdon yaa virale hi, machhlee yaa anya aksheruki jeevon se judaa hota he
 The polyp usually has a mouth surrounded by upward tentacles similar to anthozoi as well as small polyps close to the union nideria
 polip ekaaki yaa sanghajivi ho sakate hai or kuch vibhinn tareeqon se alangik taur par, anek polip utpann karte hue prasphutit hote hai
 Many are very small, measured in millimeters
 duusare charan main, chote polip alangik taur par jelifish utpann karte hai, jinamein se prayek medusa ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Small jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed on plankton
 medusa main trigyi samamik, chhatari ke aakaar kaa sharir hota he jo ghanti kehalaata he, jo saamanytah shikaar pakadaney vaale ghanti ke kinare ke chote ubhaar jaise-simavarti sparshakon se yukt hota he
 Some species of jellyfish do not have a polyp part in their life cycle, but they pass on to the next generation of jellyfish through the direct development of fertilized eggs from jellyfish
 jelifish ekalingashrayi hai, arthath ve aam taur par nar yaa maadaa hai 
 In most cases, both release sperm and eggs into the surrounding waters, where the eggs are fertilized and mature into a new organism
 kuch prajatiyon main, shukranu maadaa ke munh main tair kar maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar andey nishechit karte hai jahaan ve vikaas ke praarambhik daur main maujuud rahete hai
 In moon jelly, eggs settle in pits of oral arms, which form a temporary children's chamber for developing planula larvae
 nishechan or praarambhik vikaas ke baad, planula naamak kitdimbh rup viksit hota he
 The planula is a small larva surrounded by follicles
 yah thos sataha par jam jaataa he or polip ke rup main viksit hota he
 The polyp is shaped like a cup with a face surrounded by tentacles, which looks like a small ocean
 vruddhi antaraal ke baad, polip prasphutit dwaara alangik rup se prajnan shuru karata he or scyphosoa main yah khandit polip, yaa skyphistoma kehalaata he
 New scyphistomes may arise by proliferation or new immature jellies called ephyra may be formed
 kuch jelifish kii prajatiyaan medusa str se sidhe prasphuton dwaara nae medusa utpann kar sakate hai
 The eruption sites vary by species; Ranges from tentacles, bulbs to manubrium, or hydromedusae
 Some species of Hydromedusae breed by fission
 jelifish kii anya prajatiyaan sabase aam or mahatvapurn shikari jelifish main se hai, jinamein se kuch jelly ke visheshgy hai
 Other predators include tuna, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles and at least one species of Pacific salmon
 Sea birds sometimes pick up symbiotic crusts of jellyfish bells near the sea surface, essentially feeding on these waterfowl or small jellyfish nutrients of crab and prawns

 sabase bade tateey jelifish 2 se 6 maheene tak jivit rahete hai, jis dauraan ve ek yaa do millimetre se badhkar vyas main kai centimetre ho jate hai
 They eat continuously and attain adult size quite rapidly
 vayask aakaar tak pahunchane ke baad, paryaapt bhojan ho to jelifish har din andey dete hai
 In many species, undercurrent is controlled by light, so the entire population lays eggs at the same time of day, often in the morning or evening

 Traditional processing methods performed by the Jellyfish Master include a 20- to 40-day multi-step process, in which after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are processed, and compressed, with a mixture of salt and alum
 prasanskaran taralata, durgandh or vikrut karne vaale sookshmjivon ko kam kar detaa he or jelifish ko "kurkura or khasta gathan" utpann karte hue shushk or amleey banaata he
 Jellyfish prepared in this manner maintain 7-10% of their original weight and the processed product contains about 94% water and 6% protein
 tazaa sansaadhit jelifish main safed, malaaidaar rang hota he jo lambey samay tak bhandaaran ke dauraan pile yaa bhure rang main badal jaataa he
 In China, processed jellyfish are soaked overnight in water and desalinated and cooked or eaten raw
 vyanjan ko aksar kaat kar tel, soya sos, sirka or chini se taiyaar kiya jaataa he, yaa subjiyon ke saath salad ke rup main parosa jaataa he
 In Japan, salt-planted jellyfish are washed, sliced into strips and served as an appetizer with vinegar

 Stings can cause anaphylaxis, which can lead to death
 isliye, peediton ko tatkaal pani se baahar ho janaa chahie
 Antibiotic ablution is also included in medical care

 yadi sirka anuplabdh ho, to namak kaa pani bhi upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 If there is a sting in the salty water, do not use fresh water, because the tonic changes may release additional toxin
 ghaav ko ragadne yaa alcohoul, spirit, ammonia yaa mutr ke upyog se bachein jo vish chhodane ko protsaahit karte hai
 By clearing jelly, tentacles and moisture from the place, nematocyst stimulation is further reduced
 prabhavit twachaa ko chaaku kii dhar, ustara yaa credit card se shev karne se baaqi nimatocist bhi hat sakate hai
 In addition to first aid, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can control skin irritation

 shamsuddin iltutamish dilli sultanate main ghulaam vansh kaa ek pramukh shaasha tha
 After the founder of the dynasty, Qutub-ud-din Aibak, he was among the rulers that strengthened the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate
 vah aibak kaa damaad bhi tha
 He ruled from 1211 AD to 1236 AD
 rajbhishek samay se hi anek turk amir uskaa virodh kar rahe the
 Impressed by Iltutmish's work efficiency against the Khokhars, Muhammad Ghori gave him an important position called "amirul Umra"
 aksmaat mutyu ke kaaran qutubaddeen aibak apane kisi uttaradhikari kaa chunaav nahin kar sakaa tha
 So the Ottoman authorities of Lahore put the disputed son Aramshah of Qutb-ud-din Aibak to the throne of Lahore, but as a result of the opposition of the Turko chieftains and citizens of Delhi, Iltutmish, son-in-law of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was then the Subedar of Badaun, was invited to Delhi on the throne
 Was seated aramshaah evam iltutamish ke bich dilli ke nikat jad naamak sthaan par sangharsh hua, jisamen aramshaah ko bandi banaakar baad main uski hatya kar di gayi or is tarah aibak vansh ke baad ilbaari vansh kaa shashan prarambh hua
 Iltutmish had two major rivals - Tajuddin Yaldauj and Nasiruddin Kubacha
 ye donon gauri ke das the
 Yaldauj considered the state of Delhi as a part of Ghazni and kept trying hard to merge it with Ghazni, while Aibak and then Iltutmish considered themselves independent
 yalduj ke saath tarin ke maidan main yuddh kiya jisamen yalduj parajeet hua
 After his defeat, no ruler of Ghazni asserted his claim to power in Delhi
 kubacha ne punjab tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetron par apni sthiti majboot kar lee thi
 In 1217 he traveled against Kubacha
 kubacha bina yuddh kiye bhaag gaya
 Iltutmish followed him to a place called Mansura where he defeated Kubacha and captured Lahore
 par sindh, multan, uchh tathaa sindh sagar doaab par kubacha kaa niyantran bana rahaa
 At the same time, Iltutmish's attention was immediately diverted from Kubacha due to the Mongol invasion, but he later defeated Kubacha in a battle that resulted in Kubacha dying by drowning in the Indus River
 changez khan ke akraman ke baad usne purv kii ore dhyaan diya or bihar tathaa bengal ko apane adheen ek baar phir se kar liya
 Apart from being a skilled ruler, he was also a lover of art and learning

 iltumish ne in vidrohi saradaaron par vishwaas na karte hue apane 40 ghulaam saradaaron kaa ek gut yaa sanghathan banaaya, jise ‚Äòturkan-e-chihalgani‚Äô kaa naam diya gaya
 This organization is also known as 'charagan'
 iltutimish ke samay main hi avadh main pirthu vidroh hua
 Between 1215 and 1217 AD, Iltutmish had to contend with two of his powerful rivals, 'aldauj' and 'nasiruddin Kabacha'
 1215 i
 main iltutimish ne aldauj ko tarin ke maidan main parajeet kiya
 In 1217 AD, Iltutmish seized Lahore from Kubacha and in 1228 seized Uchh and asked Kubacha to surrender unconditionally
 ant main kubacha ne sindhu nadi main kudakar aatmahatya kar lee
 In this way, both these powerful opponents came to an end
 mongol akramanakari changez khaan kii beti se se jilaluddin mughabarni kaa premaprasang tha jiske ke bhay se bhaybheet hokar khwarism shah kaa putr 'jilaluddin mughabarni' vahaan se bhaag kar punjab kii ore aa gaya
 Genghis Khan followed him to Sindh in about 1220-21 AD
 usne iltutamish ko sandesh diya ki vah mangabarni kii madad na karen
 Genghis Khan's messenger came to Iltutmish's court with this message
 iltutamish ne mongol jaise shaktishaalee akramanakari se bachane ke liye mangabarni kii koi sahaayta nahin kii
 The fear of Mongol invasion was averted in 1228 AD when Mangabarni withdrew from India
 qutubuddin aibak kii mrityu ke baad ali mardaan ne bengal main apane ko swatantra ghoshit kar liya tathaa 'allaudin' kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 He died two years later
 iske baad uskaa putr 'hisamuddin ivaaj' uttaradhikari bana
 He assumed the title of 'ghyasuddin Azim' and played coins of his own name and taught Khutba
 1225 main iltutamish ne bengal main swatantra shaasha 'hisamuddin ivaaj' ke viruddh abhiyaan chhedaa
 Iwaz accepted to rule under his rule without war, but he revolted again as Iltutmish returned to Delhi
 is baar iltutamish ke putr nasiruddin mahmud ne 1226 i
 main lagbhag use parajeet kar lakhanauti par adhikaar kar liya
 After two years, after the death of Nasiruddin Mahmud, Malik Ikhtiaruddin Balka Khalji took over the throne of Bengal
 1230 i
 main iltutamish ne is vidroh ko dabaaya
 Balka Khalji was killed in the conflict and this time once again Bengal became under the Delhi Sultanate
 1226 i
 main iltutamish ne ranthambhore par tathaa 1227 i
 main paramaron kii rajdhani mandaur par adhikaar kar liya
 In 1231 AD, Iltutmish laid siege to the fort of Gwalior and defeated the ruler Mangaldev
 1233 i
 main chandelon ke viruddh evam 1234-35 i
 main ujjain evam bhilsa ke viruddh uskaa abhiyaan safal rahaa
 Iltutmish's invasions of Nagada's Guhilautas and the Gujarat Chalukyas failed
 iltutamish kaa antim abhiyaan bamiyaan ke viruddh hua
 In February 1229, Iltutmish received a 'khilayat' and a certificate in honor of the Caliph of Baghdad
 caliph ne iltutamish kii pushti un saare kshetron main kar di, jo usne jite the
 At the same time, the Khalifa also conferred upon him the title of 'sultan-e-azam'
 pramaan patr praapt hone ke baad iltutamish vaid sultan evam dilli sultanate ek vaid swatantra rajya ban gai
 This acceptance helped Iltutmish to inherit the rank of Sultan and secure the authority of his children on the throne of Delhi
 khirdt milane ke baad iltutamish ne ‚Äònasir amir ul mominin‚Äô kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 Iltutmish was the first Ottoman sultan who introduced pure Arabic coins
 usne sultanate kaaleen do mahatvapurn sikke 'chaandi kaa taka' tathaa 'tambe' kaa ‚Äòjeetal‚Äô chalavaaya
 Iltutmish started the tradition of inscribing mint names on coins
 sikkon par iltutamish ne apana ullekh caliph ke pratinidhi ke rup main kiya he
 After the Gwalior conquest, Iltutmish inscribed some proud words on his coins, such as "mighty sultan", "empire and sun of religion", "helper of the hero of the righteous"
 iltutamish ne ‚Äòikta vyavastha‚Äô kaa prachlan kiya or rajdhani ko lahore se dilli sthaanantarit kiya
 While on his way to invade Bayana, Iltutmish became ill
 iske baad iltutamish kii beemaari babbti gai
 He finally died in April 1236
 iltutamish pratham sultan tha, jisane doaab ke aarthik mahatva ko samajha tha or usamen sudhaar kiya tha
 Razia was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish and the first Muslim ruler of India
 apane antim dinon main iltutamish apane uttaradhikaar ke sawaal ko lekar chintit tha
 Nasruddin Mahmud, the eldest son of Iltutmish, who was ruling Bengal as his father's representative, died in April 1229 AD
 sultan ke shesh jivit putr shashan kaary ke kisi bhi prakaar se yogya nahin the
 Therefore, Iltutmish appointed his daughter Razia as his successor from his death bed
 sthapaty kala ke antargat iltutamish ne qutubuddin aibak ke nirmaan kaary ko puraa karavaaya
 Iltutmish is also credited for possibly building the first mausoleum in India

 While his martyrdom day is celebrated every year on August 18 in Japan, his family members living in India still believe that Subhash did not die in 1945

 If this is not the case, why has the Indian government not yet made documents related to his death public? 16 janvari 2014 ko kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang vaali janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh diya
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha

 Prabhavati and Jankinath Bose had 14 children in all, with 6 daughters and 8 sons

 Of all his brothers, Subhash was most fond of Sharad Chandra
 sharadbabu prabhavati or janakinath ke duusare bete the
 Subhash used to call him Mejda

 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination

 49veen bengal regiment main bhartee ke liye unhone pariksha di kintu ankhen kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen sena ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Somehow he got admission in the Scottish Church College, but the mind was asking to join the army
 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921
 ek patr deshvandhu chittaranjan das ko likhaa
 But soon after getting the letter from his mother Prabhavati that "father, family members or anything else, they are proud of their son's decision
" " subhash june 1921 main maansik evam naitik vigyaan main trypass kii degree ke saath swadesh waapas laut aaye
 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile
 is yachika main bharat sangh, rashtriya salaahkaar parishad, ro, khufia vibhaag, pradhanmantri ke nijee sachiv, raksha sachiv, grih vibhaag or pashchim bengal sarkaar sahit kai anya logon ko prativaadee banaaya gaya he
 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar‚Äìghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India
 aaazaad hind fouj ko chhodkar vishwa-itihaas main aisa koi bhi drushtaant nahin miltaa jahaan tees-pantis hajaar yudhbandiyon ne sangathit hokar apane desh kii aazaadee ke liye aisa prabal sangharsh chhedaa ho
 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha
 It was an unprecedented salute given by one Krantivir to another Kranti Veer

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript
 iske atirikt netaji ne apane bahuaiami swatantraaa sangharsh ke sandarbh main aganit patr likhe, bhaashan diye evam radio ke madhyam se bhi unke vyaakhyaan prasaarit hue
