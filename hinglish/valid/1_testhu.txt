 Amnesia is a deficit in memory due to brain damage, illness, or psychological trauma
 vibhinn sedatives or hypnotic dawaaon ke upyog se amnesia asthaayee rup se bhi kaaran ho saktaa he
 Memory may be completely or partially lost due to the extent of damage that occurs
 do mukhya prakaar ke amnesia hai: retrogred amenesia or antrogred amenesia
 Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information acquired prior to a particular date, usually the date of the accident or operation
 kuch maamalon main smriti haani dashakon tak bad sakati he, jabaki anya main vyakti keval kuch maheenon kii smriti kho saktaa he
 Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store to the long-term store
 is prakaar ke amliya vaale log lambey samay tak chizon ko yaad nahin kar sakate hai
 These two types are not mutually exclusive; Both can occur simultaneously

 In people suffering from amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still intact, and they may still be able to create new memories

 Patients can learn new procedural knowledge

 Amnesic patients also retain intellectual, linguistic, and social skills despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes

 However, some patients with dense anterograde amnesia do not remember episodes during which they first learned or saw the information

 The reason patients cannot form new episodic memories is because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lesion, and thus could not make a connection to the hippocampus cortex

 For example, some patients show improvement in pseudorandom sequence experimentation as healthy people
 isliye, prakriyaatmak shiksha ghoshnaatmak smriti ke liye aavashyak mastishk pranali se swatantra rup se aage bad sakati he
 According to fmri studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, premotor cortex, and the complement motor region, regions that are not typically associated with the formation of declarative memories

 There are three generalized categories in which amnesia can be achieved by an individual
 teen shreniyan sir aghat hai, dardanaak ghatnaayen, yaa shaareerik kami 
 Most happiness and related memory issues derive from the first two categories because they are more common and the third can be considered a subcategory of the first
 head aghat ek bahut vyapak seemaa he kyonki yah mastishk kii ore kisi prakaar kii chot yaa sakriy karrwai se sambandhit he jo amlata kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Retrograde and anterograde amnesia is often seen by such events, an accurate example of the cause of both would be electroshock therapy, which causes both briefly for the recipient patient
 dardanaak ghatnaayen adhik vyaktiparak hai
 What the person finds painful depends on what is painful
 bhale hi, ek dardanaak ghatana ek aisi ghatana he jahaan kuch pareshaan hota he ki man tanaav se nipatane ke bajaay bhoolanaa chunata he
 a common example of amnesia caused by traumatic events is disruptive amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply troubled them
 ek udhaaharan ek vyakti hoga jo apane priyajanon ko shaamil karne vaali ghaatak or graphic car durghatana ko bhul jayega
 Physical deficiencies are different from head trauma because physical deficiencies depend more towards passive physical issues
 amnesia ke vishisht kaarnon main nimnlikhit hai: Electroconvulsive therapy in which seizures are electrically induced in patients for therapeutic effect can have acute effects, including both replication and anterograde amnesia
 sharaab donon blassout kaa kaaran ban sakate hai or smriti nirmaan par hanikaarak prabhaav daal sakate hai
 type antrogred amenesia mastishk ke nuksaan ke kaaran nai yaaden banane main asamarthta he, jabaki ghatana se pehle lambii avadhi kii yaaden barkaraar rahati hai
 Brain damage can be caused by long-term alcoholism, severe malnutrition, stroke, head trauma, encephalitis, surgery, wernicke-korsakoff syndrome, cerebrovascular events, anoxia, or other trauma effects

 Similarly, social and emotional support is important for improving quality of life for anterograde amnesia sufferers

 Retrograde amnesia is the inability to recall memories before the onset of amnesia
 ghatana ke baad koi nai yaaden ancode karne main sakasham ho saktaa he
 Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage in parts of the brain other than the hippocampus
 hippocampus nai memory ankoding ke liye zimmedaar he
 Episodic memory is more likely to be affected by semantic memory
 nuksaan aamtaur par sir ke aghat, cerebrovascular durghatana, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, anseflitis yaa puraani sharaab ke kaaran hota he
 People suffering from replica amnesia are more likely to remember common sense rather than specificities
 haal kii yaaden punarprapt hone kii sambhaavna kam he, lekin samay ke saath majboot hone ke kaaran puraani yaaden yaad rakhana aasaan ho jayega
 Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing memories to loss

 The operation of this long-term consolidation process is seen in retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can relatively normally recall memories from childhood, but are affected when they recall experiences that occurred only a few years before becoming Amazon
 Occur
 post-aghat sambandhi bhulbhulaiya aam taur par sir kii chot ke kaaran hoti he 
 Painful amnesia is often transient, but it can be permanent or either anterograde, retrograde, or mixed type
 amnesia dwaara cover kii gai avadhi kii seemaa chot kii degree se sambandhit he or anya kaaryon kii vasuuli ke liye purvanumaan kaa sanket de sakati he
 Minor trauma, such as a car accident that results in no more than a mild whiplash, is due to a slight interruption in the short / long-term memory transfer mechanism that a car owner does not remember moments before the accident
 
 Victims can also know who people are

 is jyotirling kii sthapana ke vishay main shivpurana main yah katha varnit he- Once the wives of Brahmins living in Maharishi Gautama's Tapovan got angry with his wife Ahilya on something
 unhone apane patiyon ko rishi gautam kaa apkaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Those Brahmins worshiped Lord Shree Ganeshji for this

 On hearing this, Ganeshji persuaded him to ask for such a bridesmaid
 kintu ve apane aagrah par atal rahe
 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry

 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to the Brahmins that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation

 Then return and fast here for a month

 After this, bathe in Gangaji again and revolve this Brahmagiri 11 times
 phir sau ghadon ke pavitra jal se parthiv shivlingon ko snaan karaane se tumhaara uddhaar hoga
 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
 chal purvak aisa karwaane vaale tumhaare ashram ke brahmanon ko main dand dena chahta hoon
 ' is par maharishi gautam ne kaha ki prabhu! unheen ke nimitt se to mujhe aapkaa darshan praapt hua he

 Medical social work is a sub-topic of social work
 ise 'chikitsaalay samaaj-kaary' bhi kehete hai
 Medical social workers often work in a hospital or nursing facility, graduate in medical social work, and provide psychosocial support to patients and their families who need it
 bhartiya samaaj main pracheen kaal se hi peediton va rogiyon kii sahaayta va seva kaa prachlan rahaa he or har vyakti ek-duusare kii seva karnaa apana uttaradayayitv samajhataa rahaa he
 Traditional social workers serve the common man on the basis of humanity through ashram schools, hospitals etc
 swasth ke vikaas, rog nivaaran va upachaar ke kshetra main samaaj kaary kii pranaaliyon va takanikon ke upyog ko hi chikitsakeey samaaj kaary kii sangya di jaati he
 Constant changes in human society, changes in the form of joint family as a result of industrialization, urbanization and socio-economic complexities of day-to-day life due to individual and family arrangements of patients and psychosocial problems arising as a result of everyday There has been an increase in the usefulness and recognition of medical social work in prevention and disposal
 chikitsakeey samaaj kaary aise rogiyon ko sahaayta pradaan karne se sambandhit he jo manosamaajik avarodhon ke kaaran chikitsakeey sevaaon kaa prabhavi rup se upyog karne main asamarth hote he
 Even after appropriate medical services, some patients do not make proper progress because sometimes the diseased person is satisfied with his mental need by the charm, love and security received by the hospital, as a result some patients do not want to go to the hospital even after treatment
 Economic and domestic concerns of some other patients adversely affect the treatment
 kabhi-kabhi agyanta va anbhigyata ke kaaran rogi shalya chikitsa yaa lagaataar upachaar karaane se bhaybheet hote he
 In providing assistance to the patients, the medical social worker makes proper use of their professional relationship with them, their knowledge of human behavior, knowledge of people's behavior in case of illness and the resources available in the person, their family and community
 chikitsakeey samaaj kaary, samaaj kaary kii ek vishistataa he jiske antargat rog grastata ke kaaran utpann maansik, saamaajik, shaareerik evam aarthik avarodhon va samasyaon ke nivaaran va niraakaran main vrittik vidhiyon kaa prayog karke sahaayta kii jaati he
 Various scholars have attempted to define medical social work
 professor rajaraam shastri ke anusaara "medical social work is the use and acceptance of social work practices and philosophy in the field of health and medical care
" chikitsakeey samaaj kaary, samaaj kaary ke gyaan tathaa paddatiyon ke un pakshon kaa varnit va vistrut upyog karata he jo swasth va chikitsa sambandhi samasyaon se grast vyaktiyon ke sahaytarth vishisht rup se upyukt hote he
 '' professor ech0es0 pathak ke anusaar : "chikitsakeey samaaj kaary un rogiyon ke sahaayta pradaan karne se sambandhit he jo saamaajik va manovaigyanik karkon ke kaaran uplabdh chikitsakeey se vaaon kaa prabhavi rup se upyog karne main asamarth hote he
 " upyukt paribhaashaon ke vishleshan evam samakalan ke aadhaar parchikitsakeey samaaj kaary ko nimnlikhit shabdon main spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Medical social work is a newly developed branch of social work, which focuses on the social, physical and psychological processes related to the illness of the sick
 atah ek chikitsakeey saamaajik kaaryakarta kaa kaary aspataal main, beemaari ke upachaar sambandhi vyavastha kii dekh bhaal tathaa biimaar ko vividh prakaar kii sahaayta praapt karana he or unki purti ke liye jo bhi saadhan he, unhen rogi ke liye uplabdh karaata he parantu is vyavastha ke falswaroop bhi uskaa kaary, rog ke ek vishesh pahalu tak simit he
 That aspect is just and only social
 vah un saamaajikkaaranon ko hal karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Whoever is responsible for the patient
 chikitsakeey samaaj kaary, samaaj kaary kii ek shakha ke naate vyakti kii mahatta ke vishwaas par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, inspired by the basic values of social work, medical social workers help those individuals
 jo beemaari se mukt hone kii prakriya main saamaajik, shaareerik, aarthik tathaa manovaigyanik karko ke avarodhon kaa anubhav karte he
 These cars have a close association with the disease of the terminally ill
 garibi rahan-sahan kii sthiti, saamaajik sambandh tathaa saamaajik paryaavaran bhi anek prakaar kii bimariyon ke liye uttarai he
 Therefore, while determining the program for the aid of medical social worker patients, he considers all these social, economic and psychological factors well in fact there is unity of man, mind and body and medicine should consider this unity
 sharir shaastra, rasayanashastra tathaa jeevashastra akele beemaari kii jatiltaaon ko spasht nahin karsakate
 The barriers of mind and body cannot be separated from each other
 samaaj kaary kii vishisht shakhaon ke samaan hi is shakha kaa bhi bhinn-bhinn anusthaapan he yah vishay ke vyavhaarik paksh par adhik bal detaa he or apane vishay samagri ke kaaran se hi anya shakhaon se bhinnata rakhata he isaki simaaen asaadhaaran he
 As a result, there is no question of not developing unique and unique principles in the development of medical social science
 agar chikitsa samaaj vigyaan apane saidwantik aadhaaron par viksit ho ta he
 So normal social science will also be affected by this
 chikitsa samaaj vaigyanikon kii bhoomika saamaajik sanghathan, vichlankaaree vyavhaar, saamaajik niyantran, samayikaran evam anya samaanya samaajavaigyanik abhiruchiyon main pratipaadit ho sakati he
 According to the opinion of the scholars: "only those who can contribute to the medical field talk about bringing about social change through their perceptive intentions
" ’’ "scientific research of social scientists can be important in the medical world even when social scientists have their skills in research
" ’’ duusare vishyon ke anusandhan kartaaon kaa swasthya ke kshetra main tabhi mahatvapurn yogadan ho saktaa he
 When they have contact with the medical world and people working in the medical world accept them
 neshnal eshociation of soshal varkar ne 1958 main samaaj kaary shiksha hetu swasth kshetra kii un sansthaaon ko aitihaasik kram main suchi baddh kiya
 In which medical social work organization is accepted as an essential part to make the services provided more useful which is as follows: - chikitsa ke kshetra main samaaj kaary mukhyatah vaiyaktik kaary vidhi se hota he
 Through this method, the social worker mainly works at three levels - chikitsakeey saamaajik kaaryakarta kaa praathmik kaary rog grastata ke kaaran utpann saamaajik samasyaon ke niraakaran hetu vaiyaktik seva kaary ke abhyaas dwaara rogi ko sahaayta pradaan karnaa he
 Apart from this, other works are as follows: - chikitsakeey samaaj kaary kii shuruuaat maanav samaaj kii rachana se hi prarambh main ham de khate he

 Because his social status has an effect on the patient
 doosraa uske kaary main yah bhi suvidha hoti he
 In his treatment, these items are presented in the satisfaction of the food items that the carrying capacity comes in the economic condition of the patient
 iske baad isaki chikitsakeey samaaj kaary kii shuruuaat kramagat badhati gayi
 Its use in 1920 or the recruitment of social workers into medicine increases from general to specialty medicine
 is samay tak rogon se grast rogiyon kii upachaar hetu unase sambandhit chikitsa main aapng yaa viklang vyaktiyon kii upachaar he tu samaaj kaaryakarta ki niyukti kii gai
 In 1920, it developed more in many services provided in local nation or union and international level social service, and especially in rehabilitation or treatment
 1980 main samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti kii gayi
 At the same time, the system of public health was done by number of administrative assembly and social work

 In voluntary health organizations also, the appointment of medical social worker started at the local state and national level
 These social work started work as consulting, rehabilitation, research community worker personal service
 ab to isaki bhoomika atyant aavashyak ho gai he
 Medical society workers there are counted as a unit of medicine
 aaj un deshon main nidaan evam swasth seva ke prachaar evam prasar main lagbhag vahi he
 This is the reason that special attention is also given to the medical social workers
 iske saath hi ise prashikshan kii suvidha bhi pradaan kii jaati he
 Workers are trained in hospitals and all health sectors
 yahaan bharat main aisi sthiti nahin he kii koi vyakti bagaiyr samaaj kaary main prashikshan liye chikitsakeey samaaj kaary main karyrat he
 There, teachers have to study medical social work
 iske atirikt vyavhaarik kaary karne kaa avasar pradaan kiya jaataa he
 As a result, they become a medical social worker with all the qualities
 vahaan par chikitsakeey samaaj kaary main doctore t kii suvidha kai vidyalayon main sulabh he
 In 1956, many universities have adopted a medical society function as a specialization
 bharat main chikitsakeey samaaj kaary kaa itihaas vaigyanik padvatiper aadhaarit he tathaa kuch varsho purv se he, yadhyapi paramparaagat seva bhav rogi kii seva bhav tathaa unhen maansik bal pradaan karne kii kriya ati pracheen he
 Helping patients, providing surgery and helping poor patients on behalf of family and religious group has been the functions of these associations
 kintu vyavsaayik samaaj kaary par aadhaarit tathaa kaushal ke aadhaar par rogiyon kii chikitsa evam dukhon ko dur karne main sahaayta pahunchane kaa prayaas 1946 se dikhaai padataa he
 It is noteworthy that the survey and development community under the chairmanship of Dr
 GS Ghurray is seen in the context of the appointment of a social worker in 1944-1945
 is samudaay main de sha main swasthya seva kaa aankalan karte hue tathaa vikaas kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue vikasaatmak santutiya pradaan kii gai he
 Sanction of social work is also necessary in the medical team
 chikitsa vigyaan main rogi ke mano-saamaajik sthitiyon par kam dhyaan diya jaataa he arthath us samay tak yah nahin sweekaar kiya jaataa kii rogi ko rog mukt hone mano-samayik sthitiyaan ek mahatvapurn bhoomika rakhti hai 1945-46 main hi da0 ghuriye cameti kii sanstuti ke aadhaar par saidwantik rup se chikitsa kshetra main samaaj kaary kii bhoomika sweekaar kar lee gai
 1946 The first medical social worker was appointed in JJ Hospital, Mumbai
 iske baad main hi ke0 i0 em0 main samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti kii gai
 In this way, after the social worker was gradually recognized in the field of medicine, constant appointments were made in their government-non-government hospitals, for example - social workers were appointed in All India Hospital, Bangalore, AIMS New Delhi and other big hospitals
 It was told completely before that that the social worker had accepted in principle the medical theory
 Yi but practically work finally could not go anywhere father still satisfying
 dow0 dhuriye cameti ne yah bhi spasht kiya kii desh ke prayek aspataal main kam se kam ek samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti kii jaani chahie
 Had this recommendation been implemented, the situation today would not have happened
 aaj jila aspataal main samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti hi nahin he
 Whether a 500-bed large hospital with 500 beds also requires a medical society worker
 bharat main chikitsakeey samaaj kaary kaa itihaas alpakaalik he tathaa saath main iskaa kshetra atyant simit he ek duusari sthiti bhi yah he ki sabhi niyukt kaaryakarta main se adhikansh aprashikshit he prarambh main shaayad yah sthiti he ki chikitsakeey samaaj kaary main samaaj kaary sulabh na rahen or duusari yah bhi sambhaavna rahi ho kii un chikitsakeey sansthaaon ke rup main na sweekaar karen, saamaanya rup se hi lete rahe
 Thus their expectation from a social worker is much lower
 kabhi-kabhi rogiyon ke liye yah path pradarshak kaa kaary kar lete he yaa chikitsa kii taraf se patr vyavhaar kaa kaary karte he
 Or they do work in office work
 atah iske in swaroopon ke adhyayan ke baad yah aavashyak he kii unki yogyata kaa spasht aabhaash chikitsa ko hona chahie yah tab ho saktaa hai jab chikitsa main samaaj kaaryakarta prashikshit ho
 The social worker should be appointed in all 50-bed hospitals only on the basis of the recommendation of the k-tee-tee
 In ngos, there is a very limited area of medical social worker
 samaaj kaary kii manyata ke liye yah bhi aavashyak he ki chikitsakon ko chikitsa adhyayan ke kaary main samaaj kaary ko saadhaaran darja na diya jaye taaki vyavhaar rup main bhi samaaj kaaryakarta ko sweekaar kar saken
 It is worth mentioning that in some hospitals in India, social workers are being appointed in Social Dispensation Medical Department in academic teaching
 saamaj kaary vibhaag kaa yah shubh lakshan he kintu is disha main niyukti bhi maatr paanch yaa chah sansthaaon tak hi simit he
 Therefore, the appointment of a social worker should be made mandatory in social medicine
 isi prakaar jan swasth, parivaar niyojan, saamudayik kaary main bhi samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti anivaary kii janichahie
 If this situation is decided by the Government of India, then there will be improvement in the appointment of social worker

 In view of the kernels of Sanatan Dharma, it is sometimes considered as difficult and difficult to understand
 haalanki, sachai to aisi nahin he, phir bhi iske itane aayam, itane pahalu hai ki logabagh kai baar ise lekar bhramit ho jate hai
 The biggest reason for this is that Sanatan Dharma is not a product of the views of any one philosopher, Manisha or Rishi, nor was it born at any particular time
 yah to anadi kaal se pravaahman or vikasman rahaa
 Also, it does not even give preference to just one vision, theory or logic

 It also has a proper system to remove the vapor generated by heating so that the vapor can be used for various processes or heating
 isaki dizin is prakaar kii hoti he ki garm karne par kam se kam ushma barbaad ho tathaa yah vaashp kaa daab bhi sahan kar sake
 The heated or evaporated liquid is extracted and used in various processes or for heating, such as water heat, central heat, steam-based power generation, food preparation and cleaning
 europe ke itihaas main byleron kaa ullekh yunaan or rome ke samrajyon ke samay se hi dekhne main aa rahaa he, lekin unka aadhunik rup main vikaas bahut dhire dhire hua he
 The use of steam to produce power began in the 19th century, but when Trevithick used high pressure vapor in his engines, no matter how strong the boiler was and what metal it was
 Was
 unnisvin shatabdi ke aarmabhik dinon tak jo log kisi bhi kaam ke liye boyler banaate the, ve yaa to apane uplabdh sadhano or suvidha ke anusaar, athwa jahaan use baithaana he us jagah ke anusaar, uski akruti bana lete the
 Initially, the boilers were made from copper sheets and later the iron was made
 majbootee or daab sahan karne kii drushti se boyler kii sarvottam akruti gol hi honi chahie, lekin ise bilkul sahi banane, sthirtapurvak tikaakar baitaane or aag kii garmi ko adhik se adhik maatra main pani tak pahunchaakar pani ko vaashp banane main badi jhanjhaten or kathinaaiyaan padati hai

 For the purpose of making and operating boilers, a separate scripture has been made in terms of safety of the public and efficiency of boilers, some of whose essential scientific rules have also come in the legislation of the states
 inkaa paalan karne ke liye boyleron kaa prayek prayogkarta baadhya he
 Boilers are divided into two main classes according to their design: agni-nalika boyleron main cornesh boyler sabase puraane prakaar kaa he
 Its texture is very simple, due to which it is still used today
 isamen ek hi dhoomravahini nalika hoti he, jiske aage ke bhaag main bhatthi bani hoti he
 Nowadays this boiler is made in many measurements, from small to large
 isaki choti se choti maap vyas main chaar foot ke lambaai main 10 foot hoti he or badi se badi maap 6 foot 6 inch vyas main tathaa lambaai main 24 foot hoti he
 It has only one furnace and fumes, so in a large size boiler, the coal does not burn properly and its hot surface ratio is also low
 isliye cornesh prakaar ke boyler main do bhatthiyaan baraabar baraabar bana dene se vahi lankashair boyler kahalaane lagata he
 Their other designs are the same
 chote se chote lankashair boyler kaa vyas 5 foot, 6 inch or lambaai 16 foot hoti he, tathaa bade se bade kaa vyas 10 foot or lambaai 30 foot hoti he
 Many times three kilns are also made in it
 cornesh or laikashair boyleron main saadharantaya vashp kii daab 180 pound prati varg inch tak hoti he
 Both these types of boilers can also be termed as ignited boilers, although the flames of fire swirl from the back of the furnace and heat the boiler from the outside
 cornesh or lankashair boyleron main ek se adhik bhatthi or bade bade vyas kii dhoomravahini laga dene par bhi unka tapt dharaatal icchaanusaar nahin badhane paata
 Therefore, in order to serve this purpose, many types of boilers are replaced with many small diameter smoke tubes instead of installing large fire channels, due to which the boilers are called multicolored boilers
 yah bahyat: prajvalit or ant: prajvalit, donon hi prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Externally ignited boilers are used in forest-dominated areas where sawing machines are used in the forest
 ye aakaar main kaaphi chote or halake hone ke kaaran suvahya hote hai
 For this reason, the work can be carried on by taking them to the basic furnace of bricks
 ant: prajvalit boyleron ke dhol ke bheetar hi ek athwa do agni-nalikaakaar bhatthi banaakar or unka prajvalan kaksh iton kii buniyaad main banaakar, peeche kii taraf se garam gaison ko dhoomranalikaaon main se aage kii taraf lautaa kar chimney main se nikaal diya jaataa he
 It is famous as Boiler Dryback
 byleron main se eliphant, athwa tischibin naamak byler kaa europe main adhik upyog hota he
 In this, two or more drums lie down on top of each other and they are interconnected by small tubes of large diameter
 uuparavaale dhol main patali nalikaay chaahe lagi hon yaa nahin, lekin nichevale dhol main avashya hi bhatthi or patali patali dhoomanalikaay hoti he
 a similar form of boiler is also designed for ship operations, known as Scotch boiler
 isamen uparyukt boyleron ke sab gunon kaa samavesh ho gaya he
 But its ignition is completely inside the boiler, so it does not require any masonry of bricks
 pump aadi chalaane ke chote kaamon ke liye jo ant:prajvalit boyler banaae jate hai, ve bahudhaa khadey boyler hote hai
 These are called cockton boilers
 aise khadey boyler main moti moti do jalanaliyaan lagi hoti hai, jinhen gallove tub kehete hai
 The benefits of jalalani are further described
 rail ingine kaa boyler ant:prajvalit agninalayukt hi he, lekin isaki bhatthi main aajkal 2-4 jalanalikaay lagane kaa bhi rivaaj ho gaya he
 In this type of boilers, except for the small size standing boilers, which have been mentioned above, all other water boilers are ignited externally
 inhen bahudhaa teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he : * jinamein jalpravaahee nalikaay kshitij tal se jhuki hui rahati hai, In the first two categories, the flow of water is carried out automatically by the transport process of heat, but in the third class boilers, the force is kept running with the help of a pump
 sabhi jalanalikayukta, bahyat: prajvalit boyleron main upar or neeche kramash: vaashp or pani ke dhol rahete hai, jinhen paraspar choti athwa badi vyas kii jalanalikaaon se sambandhit kar ek athwa adhik sankhya main laga diya jaataa he
 The upper drums contain vapor, or a mixture of both water and vapor, and the lower drum contains only water and sometimes condensed water and mud
 is dhol ko macendram bhi kehete hai
 These boilers form several classes due to the diversity of interconnecting ducts of different dholes
 aadi jalanalikayukta boyleron main baveqok-vilcox boyler sarvottam samajha jaataa he
 It consists of four inch diameter tubes with headers on both sides, their ends are inflated and then four inches in diameter on the top of these headers, but of shorter length, by sealing the drains in the same way, With their upper ends seated in the steam drum, the entire network of downstream tubes is connected to the drum from the front and back
 peeche vaale hederon kaa sambandh, neeche kii ore se pankasangraahak se kar diya jaataa he, jisamen boyler ke kaam karte samay keechad or bahut gadha pani ikattha ho jaataa he jo suvidhanusaar baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 In terrestrial boilers, the steam water drums are placed in the direction of the length of the tubes and the vessels can also be obstructed in the boilers
 purvavarnit jalanalika boyler se isamen do bhinnataayen hai
 The outer diameter of the tubes of this boiler is almost shinch and they are attached to the headers on the same side at a distance of six inches and their folded part hangs in the balance, due to which the flow of water is in the same direction
 in patali patali naliyon ke bich ek kshetreey nalee or hoti he, jisase naliyon kii ek shrenee main se bahakar aayaa hua pani kshetreey nalee main jaakar, phir duusari shrenee main pravisht ho jaataa he
 This boiler is used more in shipyards other than factories
 france ke jahaji bedon main iskaa adhik prachaar he
 In Germany too, a boiler similar to that for shipyard was built, which is called Durr boiler
 is boyler main do athwa teen vaashpadhol upar kii taraf or do athwa ek pani kaa dhol neeche lagaakar unhen mudi hui jalanalikaaon dwaara jod diya jaataa he tab us alpha boyler kehete hai
 There are many benefits of applying straight water tubes: Firstly, the ventilation of air can be done easily
 Other straight tubes can be cut to whatever length they want, so there is no need to keep unnecessary tubes in stock; While performing the third examination the tubes can be easily inserted into the drum and can be replaced
 in boyleron kii ginati jahaajon boyleron main hoti hai, jo urdhwadhar naliyon ke liye prasiddh hai
 All its channels are straight and the bottom drum is cylindrical instead of d shaped
 thorncroft boyler main baahar kii taraf rahanevaali nalika shrenee kuch dhanushakar mudi hoti he
 Nowadays in the industrial sector, the cost of steam in engines, turbines and other types of equipment and processes is so high that ordinary boilers are unable to meet that requirement
 yaaro or sterling boyler, jinka hamane upar varnan kiya he, thode bahut parivartanon ke saath bade kaarkaanon or bijli gharon ke liye kuch adhik upyogi to ho gaye, kyonki sudhaar karne se unamem koyale kii bukani, tel or loha galane kii bhatthiyon se khaarij honevaali gaisen bhi jalaai jane lageen
 Even then, they lagged behind modern areas, because the steam vapor of 575 pounds per square inch, which has a high temperature of 399 ° C, for shipping works
 Ho is quite understood
 yadi yaaro or sterlig boyleron main do lakh pound vaashp ukt daab or taap par prati ghanta bhi bana den, to ise kaaphi samajha jaataa he, lekin sthaliy kaarkaanon or bijli gharon main 1,000 pound prati varg inch or kabhi kabhi isse unche daab kaa vaashp bhi paanch lakh pound prati ghanta se bhi adhik maatra main kharch ho jaataa he
 Therefore, instead of drums and dilapidated boilers, some of the most dilapidated instruments are being made, in which the drum is applied only for nominal vapor accumulation
 inaki or puraane boyleron kii akruti main ab koi samanta nahin rahi, at: inhen bhaapajanitr hi kehete hai
 Transport of pure distilled water in steam generators by the use of pumps in thin tubes and evaporation in them also takes place
 is prakaar ke boyleron ko prajvalanakaksh ek badi kothri ke rup main banaaya jaataa he, jisaki deevaaren agnisah iton kii banaakar unke sahare bheetar kii taraf jalanalikaaon kaa astr laga diya jaataa he jo bhatthi kii jwaalaon main se vikiran dwaara ai hui garmi ke ek bahut bade ansh ko sokh letaa he or shesh garmi yathapurv tirchhi jalanalikaaon or boyler ke dholon dwaara avashoshit hoti he
 a similar type of Vu Vaporizer burns coal powder in a Bhikkarma evaporator
 isaki rachana or nirmaan neuyork kii kambshchan ejineering korporation or landan kii kambshchan jenerator companiyon ne milakar kiya he
 It can be produced from 75 thousand pounds to four million pounds per hour of vapor at a pressure of 800 pounds per square inch
 isaki bhatthi kothrinuma hoti he, jisaki deevaaron ke chaaron or anaachhadit jalanalikaaon kii ek parat lagi rahati he
 At the four corners of this ignition, downstream, coal powder is mixed with compressed hot air and released by forced showers
 ekadam prajvalit hokar badi bheeshan agni ke bavandar ke rup main jalati hui gas upar ko uthati he or is prajvalan kaksh kii chat ke sameep naliyon ke madhya main se hoti hui praathmik atitptak ke kshetra main pravesh kar or vahaan se paravartit hokar, avamandak dwaar main se hoti hui atitptak main pravesh karti he, jisamen se neeche kii disha main bahati hui gas vayutptak main ghumkar upar uthati he
 If there is a miter, the gas passes through it into the chimney
 is prakaar ke vashpajanitr kam se kam jagah gherte hai, kintu adhik se adhik shaktishaalee vaashp kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai
 Among them are Atmos, Benson, Laumont, Löffler, Sulzer Monotube and Wilox
 inhen bhi do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Loughler, lamont, and Willox are counted in one category, and Benson and Sulzer monotubes are in another category
 ise england ke bulver hampton kii jon tomson company se para ucchdaab kaa vaashp taiyaar karne ke liye banaaya he, jo england ke hi kai bijli gharon main 1,000 pound prati varg inch daab kaa vaashp taiyaar karata he, lekin isaki banaavat main aisi koi baat nahin jiske kaaran usamen nimnadaab kaa vaashp paidaa kar upyog main na laayaa ja sake
 Coal powder or oil fuel can be used in this vaporizer
 vashpajanitr kaa mukhya bhaag vaashp or jalsangraahak dhol he, jisamen se pani apane gurutv ke kaaran neeche lage panpon main jaataa he
 These pumps send this water to the aerated head made of soft steel at an additional pressure of about 35 pounds per square inch above the pressure of the main drummer
 in sheershikaaon kii sankhya vashpajanitr kii rachana or samarthy ke anusaar kam yaa zyada bhi ho sakati he
 If the evaporator works at low pressure, then the cut of the headings is made rectangular and if the high pressure works, the cut of the headings is made round
 sheershikaaon main pahunchne par pani vashpikaran nalikaaon main jaataa he, jinka munh sheershikaaon ke bheetar chhuchchhiyon ke rup main is prakaar thik hisaab se banaaya jaataa he ki unamem utana hi pani pravisht ho sake jitani maatra main vah nalee garmi kaa shoshan kar sakati he
 There are many small holes in each of the pellets, from which the water is filtered

 An example of such a computer security policy is the bell-lapadula model
 This strategy is based on the coupling of special microprocessor hardware features, often involving a memory management unit, to a particular correctly implemented operating system kernel

 Although such secure operating systems are possible and have been implemented, most commercial systems are adopting 'lower security' as they do not rely on the features supported by secure operating systems
 In low-security operating environments, applications must rely on participation in their own security

 anya bhashaaen, jaise ki java, in dosha ke liye or adhik pratirodhi hoti hai, lekin phir bhi code / cmand injection or anya software dosha pravan hoti hai, jo vidhwans laati hai
 Recently another poor coding practice has come under scrutiny; Which is called Dangling Pointers
 july 2007 main pehali baar is vishesh samasya ke gyaat karname kaa pataa chalaa
 iske saamne aane se pehle bhi is samasya kii jaankaree thi, lekin ise academik mana jaataa tha or vyaavhaarik uplabdhi nahin mana jaataa tha
 Unfortunately, there is no theoretical model of "secure coding" methodology nor practically practicable, so far the varieties of the mechanisms are much broader and the methods used to employ them are sparse
 dilachasp baat he ki is tarah kii arakshitta aksar hi puraatan darshanon se utpann hoti hai jinamein computaron ko kuch chuninda logon dwaara upyog kii jane vaali ek kathinaayee se prasaarit satta maan liya gaya he, unamem se sabhi vyarth ucch shikshit, suprashikshit shikshavid the, lekin unke man main maanav jati kii bhalaai kii bhaavana thi
 Thus, it was considered quite harmless if, for example, a format string in a Fortran program could contain a j format specifier "shutting down the system after printing"
 aakhirkaar, ek sadashayi system programmer ke bina aise feechar kaa prayog koun karegaa? yah soch se pare baat thi ki software ko vinaashkari rup se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that, in some languages, the distinction between data and code is unclear
 lisp main, vishesh rup se, code or data ke bich koi antar nahin hota he, donon ek hi rup ke hote hai: ek es-abhivyakti ko code, yaa data, yaa donon kiya ja saktaa he; or lisp kaarykram kaa "upyogkarta" jo tathakthith "data" main ek nishpaadan yogya lambda khand ko daal paata he, vah manamaane dhang se saamaanya va khatarnaak kaaryaatmakataa praapt kar saktaa he
 By giving Perl something "modern" like the equivalent function, it enables Perl to generate code and present it to the interpreter in a pseudostep of string data
 computer system ke antargat, do suraksha model hote hai jo visheshadhikaar algaav ko lagu karne main sakasham hai or abhigam niyantran suchi tathaa kshamta-aadhaarit suraksha main unki pahunch hoti he
 In many cases the economics of ACL have proved to be unsafe, such as, the misleading deputy problem
 It has also been shown that acl's promise to allow only one person to use an item cannot be guaranteed in practice
 Both of these problems are solved by capabilities
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki sabhi asiel-aadhaarit system main vyaavhaarik khamiyaan hua karti hai, lekin keval tabhi jab kuch upyogitaaon ke diziner yah sunishchit karen ki unhone koi khami nahin rakh chodi he
 The capabilities are mostly limited to research operating systems and commercial oss are still using acls
 tathaapi, kshamtaaon ko bhashaa ke str par bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki programing kii ek style kii ore le jaati he, jo maanak lakshya-unmukh dizin kii aavashyak shuddhta he
 There is an open project e-language in this area
 1970 ke dashak main hardware or software donon main pehle plyse pranali 250 or phir cambridge cap computer ne kshamtaaon ke upyog kaa pradarshan kiya
 One reason for the lack of adoption of capabilities may be that ACL proposed a "quick fix" for security, without giving the operating system and hardware a comprehensive redesign
 sabase surakshit computer ve hai jo internet se jude hue nahin hai or kisi hastkshep se bachane ke liye kavachaband hai
 In the real world, most security comes from operating systems, where security is not additionally added
 computer pranali par chalane vaale lagbhag sabhi praudyogiki aadhaarit udyog main computer suraksha mahatvapurn he
 Computer security can also be referred to as computer safety
 computer aadhaarit pranaaliyon ke mudde or unki asankhya kamajoriyaan kisi kriyasheel udyog ke rakrakhaav kaa ek abhinn hissaa hai
 Cloud security is challenging, as security features and management systems vary in varying degrees in the event of a cloud
 is sambandh main ek taarkik protocol aadhaar ko viksit karne kii zarurat hoti he taaki ghatakon kaa puraa kshetra samakalik or surakshapurna tareeke se sanchalit hon
 The aviation industry is particularly important when analyzing computer security, as it is associated with the risk of human life, expensive equipment, goods and transportation infrastructure
 hardware or software ke kadachaar, maanav truti or doshapurn oparating vaataavaran se suraksha ko khatre main daalaa ja saktaa he
 Computer weaknesses arising from sabotage, espionage, industrial competition, terrorist attacks, mechanical malfunctions and human error can be exploited
 vimaanan udyog main safaltaapurvak jaanboojhkar kiye gayi yaa laaparvaahee ke kaaran computer pranali ke durupyog ke parinamswaroop gopneeyata ke nuksaan se lekar system kii shuddhta tak kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he, jisase data kii chori yaa kshati, network or hawaii yatayaat niyantran main rukaawat jaisi adhik gambhir chintaaen paidaa ho sakati hai, jinaki vajah se hawaii adde band hone, vimaanon kii kshati or yatriyon ke jivan kii kshati jaisi ghatnaayen bhi ho sakati he
 Weapon-controlled military systems can pose major threats
 ek bade hamale ko bahut adhik hai tech hone kii yaa ise adhik dhan kii bhi zarurat nahin he; hawaii adde main bijli katautee se hi vishwavyaapee prabhaav pad sakate hai
 
 The easiest and arguably most difficult of security vulnerabilities is to detect unauthorized communication transmissions at specific radio frequencies
 ye prasaaran hawaii yatayaat niyantrakon ko dhokhaa de sakate hai yaa sanchaar vyavastha ko puri tarah baadhit kar sakate hai
 Such incidents are very common, which has led to a change in the flight order of commercial aircraft, and in the past it has created panic and confusion
 mahasaagaron par vimaan niyantran vishesh rup se khatarnaak he, kyonki radar nigaraanee tat se keval 175-225 mile tak hi faili hui hoti he
 In addition to radar monitoring, controllers have to rely on periodic radio communication with a third party
 bijli girane, vidyut kii asthirataa, vidyut tarang, brown-outs, fus udne or anya vibhinn vidyut katautee yaa gadabadi se sabhi computer system aksham ho jate hai, kyonki ve vidyut strot par nirbhar hote hai
 Other accidental and deliberate mistakes have caused significant disruptions in security critical systems over the past few decades, and reliance on reliable communications and electrical energy puts computer safety at risk
 1994 main, america vaayu sena ke mukhya kaman or anusandhan ikai rome prayogshaala main agyaat ghuspaithiyon dwaara ek sau se adhik atikaraman kiye gaye the
 Using the Trojan horse virus, hackers gained access to Rome's networking system and erased traces of their activities

 On April 1, 2009, Senator J
 Rockefeller introduced the "cybersecurity Act of 2009 - S
 773" in the Senate; The bill, written by Senators Avan Beh, Barbara Mikulski, Bill Nelson and Olympia Snowy, was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transport, which approved the revised version of that bill on 24 March 2010
 The Bill seeks to increase cooperation between the public and private sector in matters of cyber security, especially for those private companies with infrastructure critical to national security interests
 Also, the objective of this Bill is to raise awareness among people on cyber security and encourage and provide funding for cyber security research
 vidheyak ke sabase vivaadaaspad bhaagon main pariched 315 shaamil he, jo raashtrapati ko adhikaar detaa he ki vah "kisi bhi sangheey sarkaar yaa america kii mahatvapurn sanrachanaatmak soochna pranali yaa network kii internet awajahi ko simit karne yaa band karne kaa aadesh de saktaa he

 On 25 March 2010, Representative Yvette Clarke introduced the "international Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act - HR 4962" in the House of Representatives; The bill, co-sponsored by seven other representatives, was sent to three House committees
 The bill wanted to ensure that the administration would keep the Congress informed about information infrastructure, cybercrime and user protection globally
 It directed the President to "prioritize helping legal, judicial and enforcement capabilities in relation to cybercrime to countries whose level of information and communications technology development is low or who are critical of their infrastructure, telecommunications systems, and Financial industries are backward in terms of use ”; Also "cyber cases"
