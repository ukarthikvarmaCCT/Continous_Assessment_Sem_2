 After a dinosaur was attacked by a laborer working in the park, Hammond's investors, represented by his lawyer Donald Janeiro, demanded that experts visit the park and confirm that it was safe
 genero ne ek ganitagya dow ian mailkam, ko aamantrit kiya jabaki hemand ne ek jeevashm vigyaani doelan grant or jeev vigyaani doeli setler ko aamantrit kiya
 They all join Hammond's two grandsons on the island — Tim and Lex Murphy

 Dennis Nidrai, the main computer programmer, was secretly employed for a commercial ban of Ingen and was being paid to steal fertilized embryos of dinosaurs
 apni chori ke dauraan nidrai ne udyaan ke suraksha tantra ko niskriy kar diya taaki use bhrun ko sangrahit karne main suvidha ho sake
 The rest of the group, trapped in the park due to the closure of the system, is attacked by tyrannosaurus in which Janeiro is killed

 He orders Eli and Maldoon to flee, with Tyrannosaurus following him

 When unable to understand the meaning of Nidrai's code for reactivating security enclosures, Hammond recommends restarting the garden's systems altogether

 When he does not return, Maldoon and Ellie go to the bunker

 Upon arriving at the operation bunker of Maldoon and Ellie, Maldun realizes that he is being hunted by Velociraptors

 At the same time, Tim, Lex and Grant climb the electrically powered enclosure outside the park's animal area and Tim was close to being killed when the power reactivated

 Michael Christon originally conceived the script's idea of an undergraduate student who recreated a dinosaur; He struggles with dinosaurs and cloning in his vision until he starts writing the Jurassic Park novel

 Universal paid Criston another $ 500,000 to adapt his novel, which he had completed by the time he filmed Hook by Spielberg
 cristan ne ullekh kiya ki pustak ke "apekshaakrit lanbaa" hone ke kaaran uski patakatha main upanyaas kii saamagree kaa kareeb 10 se 20 pratishat hi tha; drishyon ko aarthik or vyaavhaarik kaarnon se hataa diya gaya
 After Hook was completed, Spielberg wanted to make the Sindelars List film
 mujeec corporation of america ke adhyaksh cid shinburgh ne ek shart ke aadhaar par film ko hari jhandi dikhaai ki spilberg pehle jurassic park banayega
 spilberg ne baad main kaha ki "vah jaanate the ki shindler ko ekbar nirdeshit karne par vah jurassic park ko banane main sakasham nahin ho paaenge
" Spielberg hired Stan Winston to create animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create dynamic dinosaurs for longer scenes, Michael Lanteri to supervise early visual effects, and Dennis Muray to do digital compositing
 jeevashm vigyaani jaik horner ne spilberg kii yah ichha ki, dianasor rakshas kii jagah ek pashu ke rup main chitrit hon, ko puraa karne main madad karne ke liye dizin kaa nirikshan kiya
 Horner dismissed the language of the Raptors' cinema in Tippett's early animatics with the complaint, "there is no way to do it!" According to Horner's advice, Spielberg emphasized that the tips take the tongue out
 winston ke vibhaag ne mulaayam twachaa ko modane ke pehle dianasor ke purna vistrut model taiyaar kiya, jo jatil robotics ke upar feet kiye gaye the
 Tippett devised key scenes Stop - Motion Animatics, but despite Motion's attempts at motion ambiguity, Spielberg found the final results unsatisfactory in the sense of working in a live action feature film

 When Spielberg and Tippett saw T
 Rex chasing a group of Gellimimus, Spielberg said "you don't have work," to which Tippett replied, "your plight is from the end?" Spielberg later wrote the dialogue between him and Tippett in the animatic and the screenplay, later as a conversation between Melkam and Grant
 As George Lucas watched the accompanying performance, tears began to fall from his eyes
 He said that "this is one of those momentous moments in history, similar to the invention of the electric bulb or the first telephone call"
 "one major difference has been bridged and the conditions were never going to be favorable
 " halaki jurassic park main koi bhi sajiv moshan kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya tha, phil tippet or uske anemetars jaanate the ki dianasor ko kaise sahi tareeke se chalanaa chahie

 Malia Scorch Marmo rewrote in October 1991 for a period of more than five months, combining Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant
 Screenwriter David Kopp then joined in by revamping the motifs format and used Spielberg's idea in which a cartoon was to be shown to visitors to remove most of the performance that complements Christon's novel
 spilberg ne prokampsognethas ke up-kathavstu ko hataa diya tha jisamen kishoron ko mukhya bhoomi se bachaa kar akraman kiya gaya tha kyonki usne ise atyadhik daraavna mana tha
 This subplot will eventually be used as a prelude to the Spielberg-directed sequel The Lost World
 Hammond was transformed from a merciless businessman into a kind-hearted old man as Spielberg identified Hammond's passion with showmanship
 usne tin or lekes ke paatro main bhi parivartan kiya; kitabon main, tim kii umr 11 or computer main he or lekes kii umr saat yaa aath or yah khelon main he
 Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazello and this allowed him to suppress Lex's adolescent on Grant
 Koppe changed Grant's relationship with the children and made him initially resistant so that the character could develop
 Kopp had the opportunity to cut extensive bookiness from the book for economic reasons, where T
 Rex followed Grant and the children were brought into the river before being pacified by Malden

 Spielberg brings T

 The film finished on November 30, twelve days before its scheduled schedule, and editor Michael Kahn made a primary cut within a few days, allowing Spielberg to begin filming the Schindlers list

 The basis of Kipling's use of the swastika was the Indian sun symbol that bestows good luck and well-being; 
 He used the swastika sign on the right and left orientations and was common at that time

06 Hetalpur Khair is a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 raajnneetik dal athwa rajnatik dal ek raajnneetik sanstha he jo shashan main raajnneetik shakti praapt karne evam use banaaye rakhane kaa praytn karata he
 For this, he often participates in the election process
 raajnneetik dalon kaa apana ek siddhanth yaa lakshya hota he jo praaia: likhit dastavej ke rup main hota he
 Political parties have different positions and arrangements in different countries
 kuch deshon main koi bhi raajnneetik dal nahin hota
 Somewhere the same team is surveyed
 kahin mukhyatah do dal hote hai
 But many countries have more than two parties
 loktantrik rajnatik vyavastha main rajnatik dalon kaa sthaan kendriya avadharana ke rup main atyant mahatvapurn he
 Political parties represent the distribution of power in a social system and individuals and groups aspiring for power
 ve paraspar virdohi hiton ke saraneekaran, anushaasan or saamanjasy kaa pramukh saadhan rahe hai
 In this way political parties are also related to the goals of social order, social mobility, social changes, barriers to change and social movements
 rajnatik dalon kaa adhyayan samajashastri or raajnneetishastri donon karte hai, lekin donon ke drushtikonon main paryaapt antar he
 Sociologists consider political parties as social groups, while politicians view political parties as a major institution of government formation in the modern state
 raajnneetik dal kii sanrachana main kuch aisi visheshtaayen hai jo ise anya samooh se alag karti hai - With the above characteristics one can see the political party as different from other organization
 raajnneetik dal kaa gathan samaaj vyavastha kii do visheshtaon dwaara paaya jaataa he - Maurice Duverger has presented a critical analysis of the social organization of the political party
 inhone dal ke sanghathan ko chaar sutreey vargeekaran dwaara samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 These categories are cocks dal ke jane-pahachaane logon kaa ek laghu samooh kaha ja saktaa he jo na apane vistaar or na hi apni bhartee main ruchi rakhata he
 Actually it is a closed group
 jisaki prakruti arddh-sthaayee hoti he
 Only during elections, the caucus is more active and inactive during elections
 iske sadasyon kii nune sankhya isaki shakti kaa maap nahin he kyonki iske sadasyon kaa vyaktigat prabhaav, shakti evam kshamta unki sankhya se kaaphi adhik hoti he
 Therefore, their influence and capacity is more important than the number of its renowned members
 duverjar ne francisi radical party or 1918 se purv kii british lebar party ko iskaa udhaaharan bataaya he
 With the expansion of the franchise the 'caucus' type of party declines
 shakha yaa branch dal parishmi europe main matadhikaar ke vistaar kaa parinaam he
 It belongs to the public and like the caucus, it is not a closed group because number is given more importance than qualities
 atah yah adhik se adhik sadasyon kii bhartee main sadaiv ruchi rakhata he
 Their political activities are not limited to elections only, but they continue
 branch cocks kii apeksha bada samooh he isliye iskaa sanghathan adhik hota he tathaa isamen cocks kii apeksha adhik ekikaran paaya jaataa he
 In this, the division of strata and duties is clear and there is also an idea of localism and narrowness
 isamen adhiktar kendrikrut dal sanrachana hoti he or praarambhik ikaiyaan nirvachan kshetron kii hi bhaanti bhugolic aadhaar par sangathit hoti hai
 All the characteristics of the branch are found in the socialist parties of Europe
 catholic or anudaaravaadi dalon ne newnaadhik safaltaapurvak iskaa anusaran kiya he
 The German Social Democratic Party is a good example of this type of party on an organizational basis
 duverjar dwaara bataaya gaya dal sanghathan kaa teesraa prakaar koshthak yaa cell he jo krantikari samyavaadee dalon kii khoj he
 It is a much smaller group than branch and its base is commercial rather than geographical
 vyavsaayik aadhaar ke kaaran cell kisi sthaan par kaary karne vaale sabhi sadasyon ko ek sutara main bandhna he
 Factories, workshops, offices and administration etc
 can be its parts
 chunki cell un sadasyon kaa samooh hai jo ek hi vyavsaay main lage hue hai tathaa jo pratidin kaary ke samay milte hai, isliye iske sadasyon main daleey ekaatmakataa adhik hoti he
 Individual cells have no direct connection to other cells
 cell kaa sanghathan anivaary rup se shadyantrakari hota he or isaki nirmaan style is baat kaa pakkaa intjaam karti he ki ek cell ke nasht hone par sampoorn dal-sanrachana sankat main pade kyonki ek hi str par pruthak-pruthak ikaayiyon ke bich koi sampark nahin rahata
 It is the most suitable medium for covert activism
 isaki gupt sakriyataayen mukhyatah rajnatik hoti hai tathaa sadasyon ke liye adhik mahatvapurn hoti hai

 salauddin ne gheraa daalanevaalon ko ghere main daal diya
 When the army of France arrived in April of 1191 and the army of England in June, Salauddin withdrew his army, leaving only the part of the sea in which the monkeys were located from the kingdom of Jerusalem

 The power of the Pope was at its peak at this time

 His policy was also sympathetic and supportive of the Venetian and Norman castes, the most powerful states in the navy and commerce at that time

 The war continued after its death by Prince Edward of England, who later became King Edward I

 This shows how much persecution and massacre can also be carried out by the propaganda of bigotry, such as the followers of a peaceful faith like Christianity
