 rajya abhyaas main or aadhunik kanoonee vidwaanon ke anusaar holi si kii kanoonee sthiti donon rajyon ke samaan adhikaar or kartavyon ke saath saarvajanik antarrashtriya kanoon kaa ek puraa vishay he
 Although the Holy See, Vatican City is distinct from the state, the state does not meet the long-established criteria in international law of the state; That is, a permanent population, a defined area, a stable government and the ability to enter into relations with other states; The possession of full legal personality in international law is evidenced by its diplomatic relations with 180 states, it is a member state in various intergovernmental organizations, and is: "awarded by the international community of international states and an international Ability to engage in diplomatic relations concerning law and one, many or under international law To enter into binding agreements with e states that are ready to great lengths to keep peace in the world and maintain
 " graham ke rup main note: This strange character of Holy See in international law, as a non-territorial institution with the same legal personality as the states, has led Professor Ian Brownlee to define it as a "needle mass institution" 
 iske alaava, holi khud ko dekhtaa he, jabaki antarrashtriya kanoonee vyaktitv kaa daawa karte hue vah ek rajya hone kaa daawa nahin karata he
 Cardinal jean-louis Tauran, Secretary of the Secretariat States of the Former Secretariat's Relations to the Holy See, underlined that we should avoid the temptation to assimilate the Holy See and its international action, with their thirst for power
 
 For them, the Holy See is certainly a universal subject of international law, but of a predominantly religious nature
 kuch lekhakon ke liye, holi si kaa vartmaan kanoonee vyaktitv madhyayugin raajnneeti main apni pramukh bhoomika kaa ek avshesh he
 Thus arangio-ruiz notes that the Holy See has been an actor in the development of international law before the creation of a strong nation, and has maintained an international personality since
 dusron ke liye, holi si ke antarrashtriya vyaktitv ko keval anya rajyon dwaara isaki manyata se ubharta he
 In this sense, Brownlee argues that the personality of "holi as a religious organ in addition to its territorial basis in the Vatican City" stems from the "principle of effectiveness" that other states voluntarily recognize as sacred
 , Acknowledges bilateral relations with it, and indeed does so, in a situation where there is no violation of the Ice Cognes rule
 iske liye, haalanki, is tarah se pradaan kiye jane vaale antarrashtriya vyaktitv un rajyon ke liye hi prabhavi he, jo iske saath rajanyik sambandhon main pravesh karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Crawford similarly believes that the recognition of many states is important evidence for accepting the legal personality of the Holy See, so today, it cannot be denied
 lekhakon ke ek tisare samooh ke liye, holi si kaa antarrashtriya kanoonee vyaktitv adhiktar aadhaarit he, lekin na keval isaki anuthi aadhyatmik bhoomika par
 Araujo notes, for example, that "it is generally understood that the international personality of the Holy See emerges from its religious, moral, and spiritual authority and mission in the world, as it purports to make an assertion of purely temporal matters
" Opposes yah ek adhuri samaj he, is aadhaar par ki antarrashtriya kanoon ke vishay ke rup main iskaa daawa uchit ho saktaa he, kyonki unke vichaar main, antarrashtriya vyaktitv par holi si kaa daawa bhi is tathy se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he ki yah anya rajyon dwaara ek purna vishay ke rup main manyata praapt he antarrashtriya kanoon
 The Lateran Treaty itself appears to support this view
 In Article 2, Italy recognized that "the sovereignty of the Holy See in an international nation is an inherent feature according to its nature and according to the requirements of its mission in the world
" " For another group, the Holy Person's legal personality in international law stems from the Lateran Treaty, which, in his view, was conferred internationally to the central government of the Catholic Church
 is arth main, openhem ne tark diya ki "holi si ke pehle vivaadaaspad antarrashtriya sthiti 11 farvari, 1 9 2 9 kii sandhi ke parinamswaroop spasht ho gai thi, holi si or italy ke bich - tathakthith letteran sandhi letteran sandhi aupchaarik sadsyta kii bahaali ko chihnit karata he, 1871 main baadhit, rajyon ke samaaj main holi si main
 " openhem aage jaataa he or vatican city state ke liye ek alag kanoonee vyaktitv se inkaar karata he
 For him, apart from the Holy See, the formation of Vatican City is only an international one; See p 328: kunj ne is drishy kii tivrata se aalochana kii uske liye: a different question is whether the Holy See was the subject of international law between 1870, when the Kingdom of Italy signed the Papal States and the Looting Treaty in 1929
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america, jab popal rajya kho diya ho to holi si ke saath rajanyik sambandhon ko nilambit kar diya
 Likewise Oppenheim believed that in 1870 the legal personality of the Pope states had become extinct
 unke liye, 1870 or 1 9 2 9 ke bich, "holi si ek antarrashtriya vyakti nahin tha," haalanki, "yah zyaadaatar rajyon ke custom or sandigdh sahmati thi ardh-antarrashtriya sthiti "sanyukt raashtra antarrashtriya kanoon ayog ne kaha, phir bhi, ki: Similarly Kunj argued that: 1 99 5 se, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan catholics for chois ne bahupaksheeya manchon main holi si main bhagidaari ke khilaaf vakaalat kii he
 It argues that the Holy See is a religious organization and not a state, therefore, international laws should neither have any special status nor the right to participate, in the same status as states, in international conventions, social, cultural and Economic Affairs

 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India

 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time, Ballabhacharya ran his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswamy's Shuddhavaita opinion

 Macdonald bhautikee main bahut niyatank aise hai, jinke bare main vaigyanikon kaa aisa vishwaas he ki samay ke saath saath unamem koi parivartan nahin hota
 These regulators are called fundamental constants of physics
 hamaari chuni hui moulik ikaayiyon ke anusaar inkaa maan jo kuch he, sarvada vahi rahegaa
 Some examples of such constants are: the velocity of light, that is, the velocity through which the transmission of light waves takes place in zero space; Electron charge; The constant of universal gravity, ie the force by which two objects of one gram placed at a distance of one centimeter attract each other; Ice points on the thermodynamic scale, ie the temperature of melting of ice, etc
 kuch moolbhoot bhautik niyatank aise bhi hai jinka sankhyatmak maan sabhi maatrak pranaaliyon main samaan hota he; inhen vimarahit bhautik niyatank kehete hai
 Burge first detailed the values of these constants in 1929
 san 1939 main danington dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan ke baad se prati duusare athwa tisare saal aisa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The best thing in these studies has been that the values of these constants have not only been found to be progressively accurate, but also that their new values have been obtained only under the errors of the old fixed values
 in niyatankon kaa thik maan gyaat karne kaa praytn bahut se vaigyanik kaaphi dinon se kar rahe hai
 Before 1929, each constant was known as a separate problem
 parantu in niyatankon main aapas main sambandh hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se is baat kii jaanch kii ja sakati he ki in niyatankon ke maanon main aapas main koi asangati dosha to nahin hai
 For example, the magnetic moment of protons can be measured by p experiments
 yah chumbakeey aghurna duusare niyatankon dwaara bhi prakat kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa sutara he p = e h / p mp c isamen e, h, mp tathaa C, kramash: electron kaa aavesh, plank niyatank, proton kii samhit evam prakaash kaa veg hai
 The value of these constants can also be determined by experiment
 chunki maapne main thodi bahut truti kii sambhaavna he, isaliye yah ho saktaa he ki sutara main e, h, mp tathaa c kaa maan rakhane par jo sankhya praapt ho, vah prayog dwaara gyaat kiye gaye p ke maan ke baraabar na ho
 Therefore, the value of all these constants should be determined in such a way that this difference is minimized
 yahan par is aapasi sambandh kaa keval ek udhaaharan diya gaya he
 Similarly, these constants also have more relationships
 in paraspar sambandhit niyatankon main sabase bada samooh parmanviya niyatankon kaa he
 Almost all constants except some can be revealed by these constants
 sabase mahatvapurn niyatank, jo inke dwaara prakat nahin kiya ja saktaa, gurutvakarshan kaa niyatank he
 Out of these constants, some key constants are chosen by which other constants can be revealed
 maan lijie aise mukhya niyatankon kii sankhya ya he
 Now some quantities are selected whose values can be measured with great precision by experiment and which can be revealed by these chosen key constants
 aisi ek maatra kaa udhaaharan proton kaa chumbakeey aghurna hai, jiskaa zikr upar kiya gaya he
 The number of these chosen quantities must be at least z
 par yadi aisi chuni hui matraaon kii sankhya "ya" se adhik ho, to hamaare paas in niyatankon kaa maan praapt karne ke liye aavashyaktaa se adhik sameekaran honge
 In such case, if we put these in any "Y" equations, we will see that there is a difference between the values obtained by calculation and those obtained by experiment
 isaliye hamen in niyatankon kaa vah maan gyaat karnaa chahie ki in chuni hui matraaon ke "ganit maanon" evam "praayogic maanon" main nunatam asangati ho
 For this, the value of these constants is determined by the least-squares method

 boston chaay party british upnivesh masachusets ke ek upnivesh boston ke upniveshavaasiyon dwaara british sarkaar ke khilaaf pratyaksh kaarywahi thi
 On 16 December 1773, when three shipwrecks of taxed tea were refused by the Boston authorities to return to Britain, a group of colonists boarded the ship and destroyed it by throwing the tea into Boston Harbor
 yah ghatana america itihaas kii ek pramukh ghatana he or anya raajnneetik pradarshan aksar iskaa hawala dete hai
 The Tea Party began throughout British America during a resistance movement against the Tea Act, which was passed by the British Parliament in 1773
 upniveshavaasiyon ne kai kaarnon se iskaa virodh kiya, khaskar isliye kyonki ve maanate the ki isse ]hua he
 The protesters successfully prevented the taxed tea from landing in three other colonies, but Royal Governor Thomas Hutchison, who was beset by problems in Boston, refused to return the tea to Britain

 In response, the colonists opposed the mandatory rule with more demonstrations and organized the first Continental Congress, which called for British rule to be repealed and helped the colonists resist

 The Boston Tea Party resulted in a 1973 protest of two issues of British rule

 While tea became popular in Europeans in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from the East Indies
 england main, 1698 main sansad ne east india ko chaay ke aayaat kaa ekadhikaar de diya
 When tea became popular in the British colonies, in 1721 Parliament tried to end foreign competition by issuing an act, according to which the colonies could import tea only from Great Britain
 east india company upniveshon ko chaay niryaat nahin karti thi
 After the law was enacted, the company had to sell all its teas in bulk by auction in England
 british companiyon ne is chaay ko kharida or upniveshon ko niryaat kiya jahaan unhonen boston, neuyork, philadelphia or charlston main ise dobaaraa vyapaariyon ko bechaa
 By 1767, the East India Company paid] on tea imported into Great Britain
 britain main khapat ke liye bechin jane vaali chaay par sansad ne atirikt kar laga diya
 Given that the Dutch government had not taxed the tea imported into Holland, these higher taxes meant that British and British Americans could buy Dutch tea at far more cheap prices by smuggling
 england avaidh chaay kaa sabase bada bazaar tha
 By 1760, the East India Company was losing £ 400,000 a year due to smugglers in Great Britain — but Dutch tea was being smuggled extensively into British America
 1767 main taskari dwaara laai jane vaali chaay kaa muqabla karne main east india company kii sahaayta karne ke liye sansad ne kshatipurti adhinium paarit kiya jiske dwaara great britain main chaay kii khapat par kar kam kar diya gaya or east india company ko us chaay par 25% shulk kaa vaapis bhugtan kiya gaya jise upniveshon ko punah niryaat kiya gaya tha
 To avoid this revenue loss to the government, Parliament also passed the Townshend Revenue Act in 1767 by which new taxes were imposed on the colonies, in addition to tea
 haalanki, taskari kii samasya ko hal karne ke bajaae, townshed shulkon ne sansad dwaara upniveshon par kar lagane ke adhikaar ke ek nae vivaad ko janm de diya
 The dispute between Great Britain and the colonies began in 1760 when, for the first time, the demand for direct taxes on the colonies arose in Parliament to increase revenue
 Some colonies, known as Whigs in the colonies, opposed the new taxes, saying it was a violation of the British Constitution
 british or british americane is baat par sahamat hue ki samvidhan ke anusaar, ]
 great britain main, is kaa arth tha ki keval sansad dwaara hi kar lagaaye ja sakate the
 The colonists did not elect members of parliament, and so the American Whigs argued that the colonies could not be taxed by this committee
 vigs ke anusaar, upniveshavaasiyon par keval unki swayan kii aupniveshik vidhansabha dwaara hi kar lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 The colonial act resulted in the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1765, but through the Declaratory Act in 1766, Parliament continued to assert that it had the authority to legislate in all matters for the colonies
 jab 1767 main townshend adhinium ke dwaara naye kar lagaaye gayi, vigs upniveshon ne phir se virodh or bahishkaar ke saath jawaab diya
 The merchants entered into a non-import agreement and pledged not to drink British tea in many colonies, while activists in New England replaced local Labrador tea in its place
 taskari jari rahi, visheshkar neuyork or philadelphia main, jahaan chaay kii taskari boston se hameshaa adhik hi thi
 However, taxed tea continued to be imported into Boston, particularly by the sons of Richard Clarke and Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchison, until they were forced to comply with the non-importation agreement, under pressure from Massachusetts Whigs
 akhirkaar virodhon ke kaaran 1770 main sansad ne townshed shulk ko nirast kar diya, chaay kar ko chhod kar, jise pradhanmantri lord north ne "americanyon par kar lagane kaa adhikaar" kah kar jari rakhaa
 This partial cancellation of taxes was enough to end the non-import movement by October 1770
 1771 se 1773 tak, ek baar phir british upniveshon main bade paimaane par chaay kaa aayaat hua, jis par vyapaaree prati pound 3 pence townshend shulk kaa bhugtan karte the
 Although smugglers still occupied most of the New York and Philadelphia markets, Boston was the largest importer of legalized tea
 1767 kaa kshatipurti adhinium, jiske dwaara upniveshon ko punah niryaat kii jane vaali chaay par east india company ko 25% shulk vaapis miltaa tha, 1772 main samaapt ho gaya
 In 1772, Parliament passed a new act which reduced the duty drawback to three / five of 25%, leaving tea actually imported at 10% in Britain
 is adhinium dwaara britain main 1767 main nirast kiye gayi karon ko bhi punah behaal kar diya gaya or upniveshon par teen pence prati pound kaa shulk lagu kar diya gaya
 This new tax burden led to a decrease in sales as the price of British tea rose
 company ne great britain main chaay kaa aayaat jari rakhaa, haalanki utpaada kaa ek vishaal bhandar ikaitha ho gaya tha jise koi khareednaa nahin chahta tha
 For these and other reasons, by the end of 1772 the East India Company, Britain's most important financial institution, was in serious financial trouble
 iname se kuch karon ko samaapt karnaa is sankat kaa ek spasht samaadhaan tha
 The East India Company initially demanded the repeal of the Townshend duty, but the North Ministry was not ready, as this action could lead to the message that Parliament was withdrawing from the right to tax the colonies
 sabase adhik mahatvapurn baat yah thi ki townshend shulk se ekatrit karon kaa prayog kuch aupniveshik rajyapalon tathaa nyayadhishon ke vetan kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 In fact this was the purpose of the Townshend fee
 purv main in adhikariyon ko aupniveshik vidhaan sabhaaon dwaara bhugtan kiya jaataa tha, lekin sansad unhen vetan kaa bhugtan isliye karti thi taaki ve upniveshavaasiyon ke prati javabdeh banane kii bajaae british sarkaar par nirbhar rahen
 Another possible way to reduce the growing stock of tea in the warehouses of the East India Company was to sell it in Europe at cheaper prices
 This possibility was investigated, but it was concluded that the tea would be smuggled back to Great Britain, where it would sell at a lower price than taxed tea
 So it seemed that the American colonies would be the best market to sell the company's excess tea if it could find a way to make it cheaper than the smuggled Dutch tea
 north mantralay kaa samaadhaan chaay adhinium tha jise 10 may 1773 ko king jorge kii anumati mili
 The act restored the 25% duty refund of the East India Company on tea imported into Britain and for the first time the company was also allowed to export tea to the colonies
 isse company landan main hone vaali thok nilaamee main chaay kharidne vaale bichauliyon ko hataa kar keemton main kami kar sakati thi
 Instead of selling to middlemen, the company hired colonial merchants to pick up the goods, in return traders sold teas on a commission basis
 july 1773 main neuyork, philadelphia, boston or charlston main chaay vyapaariyon ko chunaa gaya
 The Three Pence Townshed Duty continued on tea imported into the colonies by the Tea Act
 sansad ke kuch sadsy is kar yah tark dete hue samaapt karnaa chaahate the ki ek or aupniveshik vivaad ko bhadakaane kii koi vajah nahin thi
 For example, William Dowdeswell, former Chancellor of the Treasury, warned Lord North that Americans would not accept tea if Townshend retained the fee
 kintu north townshend kar se praapt rajasav ko chhodana nahin chaahate the, kyonki yah mukhya rup se aupniveshik adhikariyon ke vetan kaa bhugtan karne main prayukt hota tha; americanyon par kar lagane kaa adhikaar bhi ek anya chintaa kaa vishay tha
 According to historian Benjamin Labari, "the stubborn Lord North inadvertently hit a nail in the coffin of the ancient British Empire
 " Despite the Townshend duty coming into effect, the Tea Act allowed the East India Company to sell tea much cheaper than before, with prices lower than those offered by smugglers
 1772 main, vaid taur par aayaat kii jane vaali chaay ke sabase saamaanya kism bohia 3 shilling prati pound tak biki
 chaay adhinium ke baad, aupniveshik vyapaaree ise 2 shilling prati pound tak bech sakate the, joki taskaron kii 2 shilling or 1 paini keemat se kuch kam thi
 Realizing that the payment of the Townshend fee was politically sensitive, the company wanted to save tax by making some such arrangement that once it landed in the colonies, it would either be paid in London at once, or sell tea
 After the merchant silently pay the fee
 upniveshavaasiyon se yah kar chhipaane kaa prayaas asafal rahaa
 In September and October 1773, seven ships of the East India Company loaded with tea were sent to the colonies: four to Boston and one each to New York, Philadelphia and Charleston
 The ships had over 600,000 pounds of tea loaded in more than 2000 boxes
 jab jahaaz raste main the, americanyon ko chaay adhinium kaa vivaran pataa chal gaya or virodh badhane laga
 The Whigs, who at times called themselves the Sun of Liberty, launched a campaign to raise awareness and persuade or force traders to resign, in the same way as stamp sellers during the Stamp Act crisis in 1765 i went
 virodh aandolan jo boston tii party ke saath samaapt hua, ucch karon se utpann vivaadon ke bare main nahin tha
 In fact the price of legally imported tea was reduced in 1773 by the Tea Act
 pradarshnkaree is ke bajaay anya muddon par chintit the
 The dominance of parliamentary rights over the colonies with the familiar dictum "no tax without representation" were major issues
 kuch logon ne kar kaarykram kaa uddeshy-mukhya adhikariyon ko aupniveshik prabhaav se mukt karnaa bataaya -jo aupniveshik adhikaron kaa khatarnaak ulanghan tha
 This was especially true for Massachusetts because it was the only colony where the Townshend program was fully implemented

 chunki chaay adhinium ne vaid rup se aaayaatit chaay ko sasta bana diya tha, isse dach chaay ke taskaron ko vyapaar se baahar hone kaa khatra lagane laga
 Legitimate tea importers, who were not given merchant status by the East India Company, were also in a state of economic crisis due to the Tea Act
 vyapaariyon ke liye chintaa kaa ek anya kaaran yah tha ki chaay adhinium se east india company kaa chaay ke vyaper par ekadhikaar ho gaya or isse yah ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki bhavishya main sarkaar dwaara banaai jane vaali ekadhikaar niti main anya vastuon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa tha
 South of Boston, protesters successfully forced tea traders to resign
 charlston main, disambar kii shuruyaat tak vyapaariyon ko istipha dene ke liye majaboor kiya gaya or laavaaris chaay ko custom adhikariyon ne jabt kar liya
 Large-scale protest meetings took place in Philadelphia

 Protesters in every colony, other than Massachusetts, were able to force the tea traders to resign or send the tea back

 He persuaded the tea merchants, two of whom were his sons, not to back down

 The mass meeting passed a resolution proposed by Adams based on a similar proposal, previously promulgated in Philadelphia, urging the captain of Dartmouth to take the ship back without paying import duty

" ek lokapriy katha ke anusaar, adams kaa bayaan "chaay party" shuru karne ke liye ek suniyojit sanket tha
 However, this claim could not be confirmed until after a century of the incident, a biography written by Adams's great-grandson was seen, which certainly misinterpreted the incident

 Prime Minister Lord North said, "whatever the outcome, we must take some risk, if we do not take it, then everything will be over
" The British government felt that this act could not be pardoned, and they responded by closing the port of Boston and implementing "mandatory acts" instead of other laws

 Due to overheating of the fermented iron, fine white sparks are automatically released from it

 For solid and fine bonding, the soles should be removed from both physical and chemical impurities, such as iron oxide scab or furnace ash

 The special thing in preparing these joints is that the shape of both of those collisions should be made such that in the event of rapid heating, the slag contact on them will automatically come out easily as soon as it is pressed, so both ends They are given a bit of an uproar by giving them some advanced shape
 aisi akruti banane ke liye vishesh prakar ke thasson kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he, jis prakaar ke thasson kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he, jis prakaar ke sire chitra 2

 vah singh kuch dur par ek ghani jhaadi main ghus gaya

 achaanak singh un par jhapata, to unhone us par talwaar kaa waar kiya
 Due to the bush, the attack could not be done very loudly, but the lion got injured in the roar and disappeared back into the dense forest
 ve singh ke peeche itani tezi se bhaage ki apane saathiyon se kaaphi dur nikal gaye
 Lion hid in the bushes again

 Suddenly the lion attacked the horse of the king and gave him deep wounds

 a fountain of blood gushed out of horse's wounds

 The first is that both their verdict will be valid and the second that they will pay them the fee for justice

 Betal gave him a piece of Mohini wood whose sandalwood could be invisible by rubbing it

 a center of smokestacks with small orbit is located inside the orbit of the larger planets
 It is clear that big planets have an impact on the orbit of the smoke coming from the Oort cloud
 Jupiter is particularly affected by a large number of such smoke-filled masses whose mass is greater than the mass of all the other planets in the solar system

 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4
 The prefix is also added to indicate the nature of the comet
 upsarg is prakaar he - For example, Hell-bop comet name c / 1995 O1
 Is Similarly, the name of Haley Comet which was first identified as a recurring comet is 1P / 1682 Q1
 Is There are some comets that were first placed in the category of asteroids and given strange names such as p / 2004 EW38 | hamaare soramandal main paanch pind he jo dhoomaketu or kshudragrah donon main soochibaddh he : 2060 chiron, 4015 wilson –harringtone, 7968 elst–pizarro, 60558 echeklus or 118401 linore | According to mythological belief, the arrival of a comet was considered to be a bad omen
 Some people called it a falling star
 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind
 Human beings then had little knowledge about space
