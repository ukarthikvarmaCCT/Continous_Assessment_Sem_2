 jaise valmiki ramayana ke anusaar shilpacharya vishwakarma dwaara pitamah brahma ke prayog hetu puspak vimaan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Vishwakarma's mother was Sati Yogasiddha

 valmiki main is vimaan kaa vistaar se varnan he: High like clouds, like gold, it seemed like gold collected on the Pushpak land
 dheron ratnon se vibhooshit, anek prakaar ke pushpon se aachhadit tathaa pushp-paraag se bhare hue parvat shikhar ke samaan shobhaa paata tha
 Like the cloud worshiped by Vidhumalaas, Ramani was resplendent with gems
 akaash main vicharan karte hue yah shreshth hanson dwaara khinchaa jate hue dikhaai detaa tha
 It was built in a very beautiful manner, and looked amazingly beautiful
 iske nirmaan main anek dhaatuon kaa prayog is prakaar se kiya gaya tha ki yah parvat shikhar grahon or chandramaa ke kaaran akaash or anek varnon se yukt vicitra shobhasmpann dikhataa tha
 His land area was full of gold-plated artificial ranges
 vahaan anek parvat vrikshon kii vistrut panktiyon se hare bhare rache gaye the
 These trees had a multiplicity of flowers and these flowers were fully covered with petals
 uske andar shwet varna ke bhawan the tathaa use vicitra van or adbhut sarovaron ke chitron se sajj kiya gaya tha
 He was bright with the aura of gems and used to travel anywhere as required
 isaki shobhaa adbhut thi jisamen naanaa prakaar ke ratnon se anek rangon ke sarpon kaa ankan kiya gaya tha, tathaa acchhee prajati ke sundar ang vaale ashv bhi bane the
 There were many bird-like paintings with very beautiful faces and wings on the plane, which seemed to be very helpful to Cupid
 yahaan gajon kii sajja muunge or swarna nirmit phulon se yukt thi tathaa unhone apane pankhons ko samet rakhaa tha, jo devi lakshmi kaa abhishek karte hue se prathit hote the
 Along with them, there was also a magnificent statue of Goddess Lakshmi, which was being anointed by those gajas
 is prakaar sundar kandaraon vaale parvat ke samaan tathaa basant ritu me sundar cotaron vaale param sugandh yukt vriksh ke samaan vah vimaan bada manohari tha
 According to Valmiki Ramayana, Pushpak Vimana used to be something like this: hanuman ji ne jab is adbhut vimaan ko dekha to ve bhi aashcharyachakit ho gayethe
 Placed near the palace of Ravana, the expansion of this plane was one plan long and half plan wide and looked like a beautiful palace
 is divya vimaan ko vibhinn prakaar ke ratnon se bhooshit kar swarg main devshilpi vishwakarma ne brahma ke liye nirmaan kiya tha
 Which later came under the control of Ravana
 yah vimaan puure vishwa ke liye us samay kisi aashcharya se kam nahin tha, na hi ab he
 Maharishi Bhardwaj's complete description of aircraft construction, its type and operation is found in the famous aeronautical scripture
 yah granth unke mul pramukh granth yantra-sarveshwam kaa ek bhaag he
 Apart from this, Bhardwaj has also written a book called anshu-bodhini, which describes cosmology itself

 This aeronautical scripture has eight chapters, one hundred tribunals, five hundred sutras and three thousand verses

 Spiritual science is behind the technology used in this plane
 granthon ke anusaar aaj main kisi bhi padaarth ko jad mana jaataa he, kintu pracheen kaal main siddhiprapt logon ke paas inhen padaarthon main chetana utpann karne kii kshamta uplabdh thi, jiske prayog se hi ve vimaan kii bhaanti paristhitiyon ke anuroop dhalane vaale yantra kaa nirmaan kar pate the
 In the present era, science does not have such excellent technical solutions available, only then these things seem imaginary and exaggerated
 us kaal main vigyaan main padaarth kii chetana ko jaagrit karne kii kshamta sambhawatah rahi hogi jiske prabhaav se hi yah vimaan swa-samvednaa se kriyasheel hokar aavashyaktaa ke anusaar aakaar parivartit kar letaa tha
 Other evidences of learning such as awakening the consciousness of matter are also found in Ramayana and various Hindu religious texts
 puspak vimaan main yah bhi visheshta thi ki vah usee vyakti se sanchalit hota tha, jisane vimaan sanchaalan mantra siddh kiya ho
 According to many studies and researchers, besides this Pushpak Vimana in Ravana's Lanka, there were many types of aircraft, which he used to travel in different parts of his kingdom and outside the state

 vishwa ke sarvocch parvaton ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye san 1808 main britishon ne bharat kaa mahaan trikoshmetiya survey ko shuru kiya
 Starting in southern India, the survey team moved north, using a large 500 kg of theodolite to make the most accurate measurements possible
 ve himalay ke najadik pahaado ke paas pahunche san 1830 main, par nepal angrejon ko desh main ghusane dene ke prati anicchhuk tha kyonki nepal ko rajnatik or sambhavit akraman kaa dar tha
 Several requests were made by the surveyor, but Nepal rejected all the requests
 britishon ko tarai se avlokan jari rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, nepal ke dakshin main ek kshetra he jo himalay ke samaanaantar main he
 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health
 phir bhi, san 1847 main, british majaboor hue or avlokan stesan se lekar 240 kilometre dur tak se himalay ki shikharon ki vistaar se avlokan karne lage
 The weather stopped work at the end of the year for three months
 san 1847 ke navambar main, bharat ke british sarweyre jeneral andrayu vaug ne savaipur stesan jo himalay ke purvi chor par sthit he se kai saare avlokan taiyaar kiye
 At that time, Kanchenjunga was considered to be the highest peak in the world and he noted that there is a peak about 230 km behind it
 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii ‘bi’
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii ‘bi’ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m मी, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false
 sankhya saaf darshaya gaya, yadhyapi vah chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha
 Although Nicholson suffered from malaria and was forced to return home, the accounts could not be finished
 maikel henacy, vaug kaa ek sahaayak roman sankhya ke aadhaar par chotiyon ko nirdisht karnaa shuru kar diya, usne kanchanajangha ko IX naam diya or choti ‘bi’ ko XV naam diya
 In May 1852, the center of the survey was brought to Dehradun, an Indian mathematician Radhanath Sikdar and a surveyor from Bengal named the world's highest peak for the first time using a trigonometric calculation based on Nicholson's Everest after a former chief
 , Repeated accounts were done to verify and its official statement, that XV is the tallest, was delayed for many years
 vaug ne nicholas ke data par san 1854 main kaam shuru kar diya or hisaab-kitaab, prakaash apvartan ke len-dein, vaayu-daab, avlokan ke vishaal duuri ke taapmaana par apane karmchaariyon ke saath lagbhag do saal kaam kiya
 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta
 kanchanajangha kii oonchaai saaf taur par 28,156 feet bataaya gaya, jabaki XV ki oonchaai bataai gai
 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"
 chotii XV kaa hisaab-kitaab lagaaya gaya ki yah puri tarah se 29,000 feet unchaa he, par ise saarvajanik rup main 29,002 feet bataaya gaya

 Magnet therapy is a medical practice
 isaki do paddatiyaan prachlit hai- sarvadaihik arthath hatheliyon va talvon par lagane se tathaa sthanik arthath rogagrast bhaag par lagane se
 According to this, based on the electrical correlation of the body by taking a pair of North Pole and South Pole magnets, the North Pole magnet is usually used on the right side, forward and northern parts of the body, while the South Pole magnet
 It is used on the left parts of the body, on the back and on the lower parts
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 isamen chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 jaise ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 Mainly, two methods of magnetic therapy are prevalent - 1
 Applying the universal means on the palms and soles and 2
 Applying on the local area ie the diseased part
 inkaa varnan yahan diya ja rahaa he - According to this method, a pair of magnets filled with the North Pole and South Dhruva is taken
 sharir ke vidyutiya sahasambandh ke aadhaar par saamanyatya uttari dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke daayen bhaagon par, aage kii ore va uttari bhaagon par kiya jaataa he, jabaki dakshini dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke baayein bhaagon par, peeth par tathaa nichle bhaagon par kiya jaataa he
 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this method of application, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc
 inamen rog kii tivrata tathaa rup ke anusaar ek, do or yahan tak ki teen chumbakon kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in severe pain of knee and neck, two magnets can be applied on different knees and third magnet can be applied on painful vertebrae of neck
 is prayog vidhi kii upyogita sthanik rog sankraman kii avasthaa main bhi hoti he
 In some situations like severe pain in the thumb, sometimes keeping the thumb between the poles of both magnets gives instant relief
 yah har aayu ke nar-naariyon ke liye gunakari he
 Treatment through magnets is so simple that it can be tried at any time, anywhere and on any part of the body
 purush ho yaa stri, jawan ho yaa boodha, sabhi isse labhanvit ho sakate hai
 The magnetism improves blood circulation; If the magnet is in contact with the body for some time, heat is produced in the body, all its functions are improved and blood circulation increases
 is kaaran saare sharir ko shakti milti he, rog dur hone main sahaayta milti he, thakaavat or durbalata dur hoti he, jisase rogi sheeghra swasthya laabh karata he or sharir ke prayek ang kii pidaa or sujan bhi dur ho jaati he
 In some cases, this method is so powerful and its effect is so rapid that it is often enough to eliminate the disease forever
 kai maamalon main duusari baar chumbak lagane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin padati
 Such as in tooth aches and sprains etc
 pehle se taiyaari jaruri nahin ek hi chumbak kaa anek vyakti upyog kar sakate hai
 They do not need to be cleaned, washed, or sterilized
 yadhyapi twachaa ke sankramak rog kii chikitsa main jis chumbak kaa upyog hua ho, uski safai kerani padati he
 If you have used a thin cloth cover then there is no question of cleaning the magnet, just cleaning the cloth is sufficient
 isaki lat nahin padati chumbak ke upachaar kii aadat nahin padati or uskaa upyog achaanak band kar diya jaae to bhi koi mushkil khadi nahin hoti
 Magnet pulls the pain from the body
 Every disease must have some kind of pain
 pidaa chaahe kisi kaaran se ho, chumbak main use ghataane, balki samaapt tak karne kaa gun he
 With his help, all body functions become normal
 isi kaaran sabhi rogon par chumbakon kaa prabhaav padataa he, pidaa dur ho jaati he or sharir kii kriyaaon ke vikaar thik ho jate hai
 The size and design of the magnet will depend on which part of the body it is mounted on
 sharir ke kuch ang aise hai, jahaan bade aakaar ke chumbak nahin lag sakate, kuch angon par chote chumbak thik se kaam nahin karenge
 For example, if a magnet is to be applied to the eye, it should be a small size circular magnet, which comes over the closed eye
 duusari ore agar sharir ke adhiktar bhaagon main pidaa yaa sujan he to bade aakaar kaa chumbak lagegaa
 Therefore, the same size-type magnet cannot be used on different parts of the body
 chumbakon kii shakti par bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Some soft parts of the body such as brain, eye and heart should not be fitted with high power magnets nor should medium power magnets be installed for a long time
 iske vipareet kam shakti vaale chumbak kadi or bade aakaar kii mansapeshiyon yaa haddiyon ke rogon ke liye kaaphi nahin honge, jaise ki kulhon, janghaaon, ghutanon yaa ediyon kii hoti hai
 These things should be kept in mind in the choice of magnets not only for local diseases but also for the whole body
 upachaar lete samay jameen athwa kisi lohe kii vastu se rogi kaa sampark na ho, yah aavashyak he
 So an iron chair or bed is forbidden, while a wooden chair or bed is ideal
 chumbakon kii sthiti is prakaar rahani chahie ki uttari dhruv uttar disha kii ore tathaa dakshini dhruv dakshin disha kii ore rahe
 This will keep the magnetic field parallel to the Earth's magnetic field and make the magnet more effective

 It is considered appropriate that spatial or general use of magnets is expedient from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
 vayaskon ke jeern amwati sandhishoth main pehle ek saptaah tak chumbakon kaa prayog keval 10 minute tak karnaa chahie or is avadhi ko dhire-dhire 30 minute tak badha dena chahie
 In many other diseases also the time should be extended accordingly
 adhik shaktishaalee chumbakon par tadnusaar gata deni chahie
 When using magnets on the Komlang like brain, it is well understood that powerful magnets are not used in it
 chumbak kaa prayog 10 minute se adhik kabhi na kiya jaae
 However, in relation to the period, its discretion is considered to be the best
 chumbak chikitsa kaa koi pratiprabhav nahin hota
 Still, do not worry if you feel symptoms of heaviness, vertigo, vomiting, saliva dripping etc
 aise kisi lakshan ko twarit dur karnaa jaruri ho to jaste yaa tambe kii ek pattee par donon haath 20-25 minute tak rakhen
 In the condition of inflammation of the vertebral neuralgia of the knees and neck, the use of magnets on the knees for 10 minutes in the morning and the last parts of the neck and pain for 10 minutes in the evening, but in these conditions the use of magnets should be from 10 minutes
 Should not be more

 Utmost care should be taken in determining the time to use and use magnets
 anubhav bataata he ki kasheruka sandhishoth, janu sandhishoth tathaa qamar dard jaisi kuch rogavasthaayen shaareerik shram evam din kaa kaam khatm karne par shaam ko badhate hai
 Therefore, in such diseases, when magnets are used in the evening, then there is a lot of relief
 iske vipareet dast, kabjiyat tathaa badi aanton ke pradaah main chumbakon kaa prayog subah ke samay karnaa chahie
 According to Ayurveda, cough is said to be the main cause of diseases like cough, colds, colds, inflammation of respiratory tracts, pyorrhea and they increase in the morning
 pitt, amlata evam ruddhavaat jaise vaat sambandhi rog shaam ko badhate hai
 If we follow this principle, then in case of chest diseases and phlegm, magnets should be used in the morning
 yadi jigar vikaar jaise pittajnak rog hon, to chumbakon kaa prayog dopaher baad kiya janaa chahie tathaa jab pet yaa aanton ke andar hawa banati ho to chumbakon kaa prayog shaam ko kiya janaa chahie
 Every prudent magnet doctor should take all these facts into consideration when scheduling the use of magnets to his patient
 1
 chumbakon kaa prayog karte samay athwa uske turant baad icecream jaisi kisi thandi khaane-pine kii cheez kaa seven nahin kiya janaa chahie, anyathaa ve utakon par chumbakon ke prabhaav ko anaavashyak rup se kam kar dengi
 2
 Do not take magnetic treatment for two hours after meals, taking this treatment immediately after meals is likely to cause vomiting

 3
 Powerful magnets should not be used on pregnant women, as this sometimes leads to miscarriage

 4
 Following the instructions given in the chapter on 'magnetic Water', the quantity of magnetic water should not be increased normally, otherwise it sometimes increases the body's activity and creates an uncomfortable situation
 bacchon ko chumbakeey jal dene par iskaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie
 5
 Do not let the opposing poles of powerful magnets come in contact with each other

 Also, sticking magnets are difficult to separate
 6
 upachaar ke samay sharir se gahanaa yaa aisi vastuon ko hataa dena chahie jo chumbakatv kaa shoshan kar lete hai
 Some electrical appliances and watches can also be destroyed by the impact of magnets if they are not kept away from the magnets
 atah chumbakon ko inase dur rakhana chahie
 7
 When magnets are not used, the holder should be kept on top of them and handled well
 unhen jameen par nahin giraanaa chahie, kyonki aisi asaavadhaaniyon se chumbakon kii shakti mand pad jaati he tathaa anaavashyak rup se unke punarchumbakan kii aavashyaktaa pad jaati he
 Similarly, children should not be allowed to play with magnets
 8
 shaktishaalee chumbak lagane ke do ghante baad tak nahaana nahin chahie
 For this reason, it has been said that magnetic therapy should be done after bath in the morning
 9

 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems

 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself
 vista kii teji kaa kaaran uski memri ke prabandhan kii nai takanic bhi he jo adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ko pehle se hi loding ke liye taiyaar rakhti he
 This is called 'memory fetch'

 Until now, pagefiles were used as virtual memory to meet additional memory requirements in Windows

 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he

 The Shiromani Akali Dal is a major regional political party in Punjab, India
 prakaash singh badal ke netritv sukhbir singh badal iske vartmaan adhyaksh hai
 Giving a political voice to Sikhs in the world is the main objective of this party
 taraazoo iskaa chunaav chihn he
 Akali Dal akali dal kaa gathan disambar 1920 ko 14 shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti, sikh dharmik sharir ke ek kaary bal ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of the Sikhs
 sardaar sarmukh singh chubbal ekikrut akali dal ke pehle adhyaksh the, lekin isane master tara singh ke netritv main adhik lokapriyata praapt kii
 Master Tara Singh was a staunch Sikh leader
 unhone angrej sarkaar kii sahaayta se sikhpanth ko brihat hindu samaaj se pruthak karne ke sardaar ujjvalasinh majithia ke prayaas main har sambhav yoga diya
 The party started the Punjabi Suba movement, led by Sant Fateh Singh, demanding a state with a majority of Punjabis from undivided eastern Punjab
 sarkaar ko prasann karne ke liye sena main adhikadhik sikhon ko bhartee hone ke liye prerit kiya
 Due to them, Sikhs were also given separate communal representation like Muslims in India Act 1919
 mahayuddh ke baad master ji ne sikh raajnneeti ko congress ke saath sambhddha kiya or sikh gurudwaron or dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh hindu mathadhishon or hindu pujaariyon ke haath se chhinakar unpar adhikaar kar liya
 This led to an unprecedented increase in the strength of the Akali Dal
 master tarasingh shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti ke pratham mahaamantri chune gaye
 The placement of the glands came into his hands
 inaki sahaayta se akaliyon kaa antkapurna prabhaav sampurna punjab main chaa gaya
 Master Tara Singh later was elected President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee several times
 master tarasingh ne san 1921 ke savinay avagya andolan main sakriy rup se bhaag liya, par san 1928 kii bhartiya sudhaaron sambandhi neh degree cameti kii report kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya ki usamen punjab vidhansabha main sikhon ko 30 pratishat pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya tha
 Then the Akali Dal severed its ties with the Congress
 1930 main purna swarajya kaa sangram prarambh hone par master tarasingh tatasth rahe or inke dal ne dwitiya mahayuddh main angrejon kii sahaayta kii
 The "pathik" party organized by Master Tara Singh in 1946's General Assembly won 20 out of the 33 seats assigned to the Sikhs in the assembly of the united Punjab
 master ji ne sikhistan kii sthapana ke apane lakshya kii purti ke liye jinna se samjhauta kiya
 Assisted him in forming the League's cabinet in Punjab and finding the basis for the creation of Pakistan
 lekin raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi jinna se bhi unhen niraashaa hi haath lagi
 After the announcement of partition of India, riots started in Amritsar under Master Tara Singh's plan to take advantage of the opportunity, but this attempt of Master Ji also failed
 master ji ne samvidhanparishad main sikhon ke sampradayik pratinidhitiv ko kaayam rakhane, bhashasuchi main gurumukhi lipi main punjab ko sthaan dene tathaa sikhon ko harijanon kii bhanti vishesh suvidhaayen dene par bal diya or sardaar patel se aashwaasan praapt karne main safal hue
 Thus the Constitutional Council also sealed the separate existence of Sikh sect and by providing special facilities to the Sikhs, opened the way for quick spread of Sikh sect by conversion of poor and Dalit Hindus
 tarasingh ise sikh rajya kii sthapana kaa aadhaar maanate the
 At the time of the election agreement with the Congress in the 1952 General Election, he was successful in making the decision of the creation of a separate Punjabi speaking state and the establishment of a Punjabi University by the Congress Working Committee
 master tarasingh ne vibhinn andolanon ke silsile main anek baar jailyatraayen kii, par dilli main yojit ek vishaal pradarshan kaa netritv karne se purv mukhyamantri sardaar pratapsingh kairon dwaara bandi banaaya janaa unke netritv ke hraas kaa kaaran bana
 In those days, the movement of independent Punjab under the leadership of Master Tara Singh was going on in full swing
 praant main ek prakaar kii araajaktaa machi hui thi
 Kairo faced the movement with his strong personality and political foresight, and his diplomacy succeeded in creating a split between the movement's main pillars, Master Tara Singh and Sant Fatah Singh, and the movement became disjointed
 kaid ho chuke tara singh ne apane sthaan par pradarshan kaa netritv karne ke liye apane anyatam sahyog sant fatehsingh ko manonith kiya
 The saint later started an indefinite fast for the Punjabi state in the absence of Master ji, to finish it, Master Tara Singh forced Sant Fatehsinh after his release from imprisonment and in response became the wrath of the Sikh community
 apni pratishtha ko banaae rakhane ke liye unhone swayan aamaran anshan prarambh kar diya, jise unhone kendriya sarkaar ke aashwaasan par hi tyaagaa
 The government invited the saint in place of the master ji
 ghatnakramon ne ab tak master ji ke netritv ko prabhaavaheen or sant ko vikhyath bana diya tha
 He got entangled at every turn and Sant Ji's popularity grew in the same proportion
 sardaar pratapsingh ke raajnneetik kaushal ne sikh raajnneetik shakti ke akshay strot shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti se bhi master ko nishkasit karne main sant ko safal banaaya
 Master ji was defeated by Sant ji
 unke 45 varsh puraane netritv kaa ant ho gaya; yah unki raajnneetik mrityu thi
 In 1962, his party got only three seats in the assembly
 yadhyapi 1966 main hue punjab vibhaajan kii purvapithika taiyaar karne kaa sampurna shrey master tarasingh ko hi he
 In 1966, the present Punjab was formed
 tab akali dal nae punjab main satta main aayaa tha, lekin vahaan kii shuruaati sarkarein party ke bheetar aantarik sangharsh or satta sangharsh ke kaaran lambey samay tak satta main nahin raheen
 Later, the party was strengthened and the party governments were able to complete their term
 vartmaan raajnneetik sthiti In 2012, the Punjab government was formed by the Akali Dal in partnership with its regional and national ally Bharatiya Janata Party
 isamen sarkaar ke antargat punjab vidhansabha main iske 59 sadsy hai or 12 bhartiya janata party ke
 As such, it is a joint majority government
 2012 ke chunaavon main akali dal ko purna bahumat praapt hua
 Party mentor and former president Prakash Singh Badal became the Chief Minister of Punjab and party president Sukhbir Singh Badal became the Deputy Chief Minister
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main party ne loksabhaa main 4 sthanon par vijay praapt kii
 The main political rival of the Akali Dal in Punjab is the Indian National Congress

 According to the 17th-century Spanish historian Diego de Rosales, the Incas is called the Valley of the Aconcagua "chili" from the corruption of the name of a pivotal tribal chief who conquered the area during the Inca conquest in the 15th century

 Other theories say Chile or "sea seabirds" can derive their names from an American root word meaning "the ends of the earth"; This may mean "where the land ends" from the Mapuche word chili, which means either quesua chiri, "cold", or chilli, either from "ice" or "the deepest point of the earth"

 Circular letter is rotated at a speed and eye near the holes Circular letter is rotated at a speed and the moving object is inspected by placing an eye near the holes
 jab chhidr vastu ke saamne aata he tabhi vastu dikhaai padati he
 If a tremor is rotated at such a speed that at every frequency of the machine, the same part of the machine keeps coming in front of an opening of the rotating sheet, then due to the visibility, the moving machine will be visible to us in a steady but dim light under normal light

 The telescope holes in the telescope first become blurred, then spread out as the motor speed increases to a full circle

 This is possible only when one hole of the frequency bar rotates in place of the adjacent second hole during oscillation of the oscillator

 When the holes appear to be clearly stable, the frequency number of the tuner can be determined by looking at the frequency of the spectroscope
 yadi chakra ke vrutt par sa chhidr hai or chakra ek second main m paribhraman karata he to swaritra kii aavritisankhya sa ́m hoti he
 Even if the speed of the frequency bar is exactly double or triple, quadruple, etc

 Circular letters are rotated differently at different speeds
 Suppose a circular letter a rotates 13 times in a second, then a part of the letter f is published 13 times in a second through its hole

 maharaj shri giradharji ke mukh par us samay ek divya chamak thi
 Along with the Goswami boys, the unique chariot of Sachchidanand Ghan Prabhu Srinathji was going on and many servants were throwing chavars etc
 on it
 jaise hi shrinathi kaa rath maharana ko dikhalaai padaa ve natmastak ho gayi
 He started worshiping the Lord again and again
 jai jayakaar kii tumul harsh kii dhwani se sara nagar ninadit ho uthaa
 Maharana joined the chariot at the right time and started shouting at Shreeji himself
 sriji ke rath ke peeche srinavaneet priyaji or peeche shri vitthleshraiji ke rath chal rahe the
 Numerous women of Nathdwara town were following them
 unke dhul ghusarit mukhade par paseene kii bunde dikhalaai pads rahi thi
 Many of them carried crates on the head
 aneko kii godi main kai nanhe-nanhe bachche killol kar rahe the
 After women, there were many elite citizens of Nathdwara
 inke baad anek baiylgadiyaan thi jin par saamaan ladaa hua tha
 At the back of the procession, the guard of the city guard, the guard of the King of Shri Maharaj, was moving slowly with vigilance
 is prakaar ”shri giriraaj dharan kii jai” udgosh ke saath prabhu kaa rath anwarat agrasar hota ja rahaa tha
 Roads, roofs and shops were packed with visitors
 log jai jayakaar karte hue pushp varsha kar rahe the
 On such a blissful occasion, some devotees shed love in the eyes and offered prayers to the Lord and some started dancing with joy
 jaise hi shri govardhan dharan prabhu shrinathi kaa rath rajprasad ke sameep pahunchaa, mewar kii maharaniyon ne prabhu shrinathi kaa swaagat kiya
 At that time, she was amazingly beautiful and equipped with valuable clothes
 rajmahishi ne mutthi bhar-bharkar prabhu ke rath par mudraaen uchhaali or rajat kanak pushpon kii varsha kii
 Thus at a slow pace this procession lasted for seven hours and reached the present Shrinathji temple
 bady dhoomdhaam ke saath rath kii aarti utaari gai or rath main hi shrikrishnaswaroop prabhu shrinathi ke darshan karaaye gayi
 At the time when Lord Shrinathji's darshan opened, at that time devotees used to see immense ahad
 prabhu shrinathi ke udaipur pahunchne par ek laghu mandir main prabhu biraaje
 After that, the temple was built in the same way as Nathdwara
 shri navaneet priy prabhu shrinath prabhu ke saath the
 Sri Vitthalsarai was enshrined in his separate temple
 prabhu ke saath yahaan phalgun caitra, baishakh, jyeshtha, asadha, shravan, bhadraprad, aadgivan evam karthik ke deepawali va annakut aadi ke utsav sampann kiye
 But the army of Sindhis came here gradually increasing
 maharana bhimsingh ne use punah laut jane tathaa udaipur ko koi kshati nahin pahunchaane ke liye kar rup main apni rajraniyon ke moolyawaan heere-jawaharaat yukt aabhushan bhi de diye
 Up to three lakh rupees more given

 Yodwa, the Emperor of Maharana, crowded with him
 dekhte hi dekhte yuddh ke pralayankari badal dikhalaai pade 
 In such a situation, the only place suitable for the residence of the Lord was shown
 udaipur main prabhu shrinathi das maah or nau din biraaje
 After that, after the strong fortified temple was built in the Ghassiyar, Lord Shrinathji left for that side
 ghasiyaar prasthaan :- ghasiyaar sundar parvatiy upatyaka main harithima liye hue ek bhayanak sthaan tha
 Suddenly it was not easy for anyone to reach here

 shri giradharji maharaj ne pandraa lakh rupaya lagaakar jo prabhu shrinathi kaa mandir banwaaya ab to vah purnroopen nirmit ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, it was considered appropriate to worship the Lord there itself
 nandanandan prabhu shrinathi ab ghasiyaar padhaare or apane durgaakar mandir main birajman hue
 On seeing this, the hay was made by Nathdwara
 mandir ke chaaro ore gali mohalle tathaa chauraahey banane lage
 New joys and desires started appearing there
 jangal main mangal ke nagade baj uthe
 Arrival of Nathdwara again from Ghassiyar: - The climate of Ghassiyar was not favorable to everyone there
 waha kaa pahari pani prabhu shrinathi kii seva yogya nahi tha
 Even Acharya T

 In this way, after spending one year in Udaipur and five years in Ghassiyar, In 1964, along with many devotees including Prabhu Srinathji Dalbal, after crossing the Aranya road of Haldighati, the battle ground reached Nathdwara via Khamanor
 lekin shri vitthalanathji prabhu shrinathi sang nahi padhaare

 Prabhu Srinathji again came to Nathdwara after six years till that time the city had such a plight that people could not even recognize their old houses
 tilkayat maharaj kaa bhawan maatr bhagnavshesh rah gaya
 But at such a time, the dilapidated shrine of Lord Shrinathji was highly worshipable for all the devotees
 jis din se prabhu shrinathi ne punah padaarpan kiya
 From that day onwards, Sudha precipitation has started happening on this Vasudha
 maharana bhimsingh ne jab dekha ki prabhu shrinathi anandpurvak nathdwara padhaar gayi he or punah usee mandir main biraaje he, unka hriday prasannataa ke maare banso uchhal padaa
 Because Maharana became very worried due to Lord's habitation
 atah shubhavela dekh maharana bhimsingh nathdwara aaye or prabhu shrinathi ke darshan kar gad gad ho gayi
 Along with this, after making many wishes in Shreeji, Salor, Ghasiyar, Vayal, Chenpuria, Charavotia, Bhojpuria, Tantol, Bansol, Holi, Jeeran, Depur Chhota, Sisodia, Kheda of Brahmins and Mandalgarh temple etc

 dhruvan anuprastha tarangon kaa gun he jo unke dolanon kii disha se sambandhit he
 Dhruva means 'fixed'
 dhruvit tarang main kisi simit rup main hi dolan hote hai jabaki adhruvit tarang main sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dolan hota he
 The moving sound waves in a gas or liquid do not exhibit the properties of polarization because they have the same direction of motion and the direction of oscillation
 saadhaaran prakaash kii kiran sancharandisha ke saapeksh samamit hoti he, kintu vishesh avasthaaon main usamen asamamiti athwa ekapaksheeyata kaa gun utpann ho jaataa he
 This can be easily evidenced by a green natural crystal plaque called tourmaline
 jab saadhaaran prakaash is pattica main hokar nikalataa he, tab to pattica ke kiran ke aksh par ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main koi parivartan nahin hota, kintu jab taramaileen main se nikali hui yah kiran tourmaileen kii waisi hi duusari pattica ko ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main bahut adhik parivartan hota he
 The intensity is maximum when the axes of both tourmalines are parallel
 jyon-jyon in akshon ke bich kaa kone badhata jaataa he tyon-tyon tivrata ghatati jaati he or jab vah samakon ke baraabar ho jaataa he tab tivrata kaa maan shunya ho jaataa he
 It is clear that ascending from the first tourmaline, the light has produced such an asymmetry property that was not in ordinary light
 is gun kaa naam "dhruvan" he or is gunayukta prakaash ko "dhruvit" kehete hai
 From this point of view, ordinary light is called "overflow"
 vyatikaran tathaa vivartan kii ghatnaon ke dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki dhwani kii tarah hi prakaash kaa sancharan bhi tarangon ke rup main hota he or is sancharan ke liye madhyam ke rup main ether naamak ek padaarth kii kalpana bhi kar lee gai he
 The above phenomenon of polarization proves that light waves are not as longitudinal as sound waves, as the above type of asymmetry is not possible due to the direction of vibration transmission in longitudinal waves
 at: prakaash tarangen anuprastha hoti hai, arthath unke kampan sitar ke taar ke companon kii tarah tarangasancharan se samakonik disha main hote hai
 It is not necessary that the vibrational path of the particle of the medium in the transverse wave is simply linear
 aavashyak itnaa hi he ki kampanpath us samtal main avasthit rahe jisapar tarangasancharan kii disha abhilamb rup ho
 Therefore, the shape of this vibrator can be elliptical and circular in special cases
 jis tarang main kampan kii akruti or yadi kampan saral rekhaatmak ho to uski disha, aparivartin rahati he, use dhruvit tarang kehete hai or jisamen yah akruti yaa disha badalati rahati he use adhruvit kehete hai
 In this view, polarized light can be of the following three types: 1
 samtal dhruvit 2
 Ellipse Polarized 3
 vrutt dhruvit 
 It is known from mathematical studies that these different shapes of vibrations are obtained by combining two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 vipareetat: kampan kii akruti jo bhi ho, uske vighatan se do samakonik saral aavart kampan praapt ho sakate hai
 When the light enters a transparent crystal, such vibrations of its vibrations take place directly and two flat polar rays appear in the crystal
 inke kampan paraspar samakonik hote hai
 Generally they move in different directions and their velocities are not equal
 is ghatana kaa naam dwivartan he or isi ke dwaara higenz ne san 1960 main dhruvan kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 One of these two rays is absorbed into the crystal of tourmaline
 tourmaileen ke dwaara dhruvit prakaash kii utpatti kaa yahi kaaran he
 The direction of vibrations of this light depends on the direction of the crystalline axis of the tourmaline plate and rotating that plate also changes the direction of the vibrations
 kintu saadhaaran adhruvit prakaash main companon kii akruti athwa dish kshan-kshan main nirantar badalati rahati he, at: jab vah tourmaileen main se nikalataa he tab dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata bhi badalati to rahati he parantu uskaa ausat maan tourmaileen kii prayek sthiti main baraabar rahata he or yahi hamen dikhaai detaa he
 But when flat polarized light, which has amplitude, passes through the tourmaline, it remains polarized, but its amplitude decreases, where is the pointer angle of the position of the tourmaline
 q = 0 tab samajha jaataa he jab aayam mahattam hota he
 When q = 90 °, the amplitude becomes a = 0 and the transmitted light is lost, no matter how large the amplitude value of the incident light
