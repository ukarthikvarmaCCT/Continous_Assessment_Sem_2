 His destiny and development prospects depend on the lineage and environment
 usamen kisi prakaar kii ichha shakti jaisi koi cheez nahin hoti
 In fact, by this naturalism one can know the former state of man
 kintu uske bhavishya ke aadarshon kii kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 Despite this deficiency, this naturalism can be considered a contribution to education
 prakrutwad ek darshanik vichaardhaara he jo padaarth ko aadhaar evam yatharth maanati he tathaa jagat, jeev or manushya sabhi usee se nirmit he
 The name of Rousseau is generally taken as the principal promoter of this ideology
 ruso ne yadhyapi prakrutwad ke naare ko joardaar dhang se unchaa kiya kintu vah bhi plato jaise vichaarvaadi darshanik se prabhavit tha
 Her thoughts were influenced by plates
 isliye ruso kii prakrutwad kaa swaroop adarshavaadi uddeshyon kii prishthbhumi par nirmit prathit hota he
 Brubaker thinks that Russo was a romantic naturalist
 balak kii ruchi tathaa yogyata, bandhan se dur, prakritik sthal par shiksha kii vyavastha ityadi baton ke aadhaar par ham ruson ko prakrutivaadee nahin kah sakate hai
 Because if Russia can be called a naturalist simply by emphasizing the child's natural interest and love for nature, then we must include Plato in the same category
 rask, doneld butler ityadi darshanik maanate hai ki harbart spencer vastav main prakrutivaadee hai
 Bacon and Comenius also appear to be associated with naturalist ideology
 kintu prakrutwad ko apni charam seemaa par pahunchaane kaa shrey spencer evam ruson ko hi diya ja saktaa he
 Expressing surprise in relation to the Russians, Robert Harbart has written that such an influence of a degenerate person like Rousseau is surprising
 chunki dooshit samaaj kaa ruson bhi ek ang tha, isliye uskaa naitik patan hona swaabhaavik tha
 Therefore, Rousseau made a universal statement about the society then, - 'human institutions are the body of anti-elements and mistakes
 tathaa samaaj dwaara sthapit niyamon ke viruddh kaary karne par sahi kaary sambhav ho sakegaa
 The Russians' slogan of 'return to nature' indicates that they wanted to take students away from the corrupt society into the natural umbrella of the village
 vastav main yah ‘vaad’ 18veen shatabdi kii europe kii saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik evam shaikshik kshetra main hone vaali ‘kranti’ ke parinaam swaroop hua
 This revolution was especially against religious institutions affected by the then orthodoxy and blind beliefs
 yantravaadi prakrutwad ne vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan ko janm diya jiske anusaar prayek manushya kuch sahaj kriyaayein lekar paidaa hota he
 When these spontaneous actions come in contact with the external environment, then related spontaneous actions are formed, these related spontaneous actions help human beings in various tasks
 isliye yantravaadi prakrutivaadee maanav main uchit tathaa upyogi sambaddh sahaj kriyaayein utpann karnaa hi shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 According to naturalists who believe in the principles of biology, the ultimate goal of education is to achieve happiness and joy, but Mr
 macdougall had proved that we work because of basic tendencies, happiness is a reward
 isliye shiksha kaa uddeshy mul pravritiyon kaa roopaantar tathaa shodhan karnaa he, taaki chaatr kii pravritiyon main punanirdesh tathaa ekikaran dwaara naveen saamanjasy utpann ho jaae jisase vah saamaajik evam naitik mulio ke anukool aacharan kar sake
 According to biologists every creature has a desire to live
 or apane jivan kii raksha ke liye use apane vaataavaran se sadaiv sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 Darwin has given two principles in this regard - the struggle of life and the existence of a capable
 isliye darwin manushya ko samarthyavan tathaa shaktishaalee bananaa chaahate hai, jisase jivan sangram main ve safalataa praapt kar saken
 But according to Lamarck, the appropriate purpose is to teach the qualities of change in accordance with the environment
 barnard sha jaise log prakruti kii vikasvaadi gati ko hi teevr karnaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, the aim of education has been to transmit and preserve the culture acquired as a social or ethnic heritage from one generation to another
 sukh env dukh ke siddhanth ke anusaar manushya sukh prapti vaale kaary karata he or dukh dene vaale kaaryon se bachane kaa prayaas karata he
 This is not true because man sometimes even dies for duty

pi
 nan mahoday kaa vichaar zyada samichin prathit hota he
 Although the nuns are more supportive of idealistic ideology, they have considered with regard to the purpose of education from the point of view of biologists and naturalists
 unke anusaar maanav ke vyaktitv kaa swatantra rup se vikaas karnaa hi shiksha kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 According to the nuns, personalization means self-realization and self-revelation
 is prakaar shiksha kaa uddeshy vyakti main nihit janmajaat shaktiyon ke swatantra tathaa avarodhhin vikaas main sahaayta pradaan karnaa he
 Two views are expressed in this regard
 pratham vichaar ke samarthak woodsaworth hai jinke anusaar balak swarg se prakaashmaan rup main aata he, parantu yahan aakar vah apane vaibhav ko kho detaa he,kyonki vah ek abodh balak hi hota he
 Therefore, education should be provided with its current pleasures
 doosraa vichaar jeremia ityadi vyaktiyon kaa he jo balak ko paap ke kaaran utpann maanate hai tathaa use keval kathor anushaasan main rakhkar, uski swaabhaavik pravritiyon ko samaapt karnaa hi shiksha kii vidhi tathaa ishwaronmukh karnaa shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 But this idea cannot be given much importance because this idea seems animalistic
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar balak kii shiksha uske swabhaav par ashrith honi chahie jiske mul main aadim samveg, moulik ichchhaayein tathaa prakritik manovritiyaan nihit hai
 Real education is that which is tailored to the child's interest, abilities and inclination
 balak ke liye anushaasan tathaa bandhan naam maatr ke hone chahie
 Naturalists consider the child to be a construction-oriented human rather than a miniature form of human
 uski prakruti satat viksit hoti rahati he
 Therefore, everyone should pay special attention towards the fulfillment of these objectives
 prakrutivaadee paathyakram kaa aakhyaan spencer kii pustak se praapt hota he
 The specialty of his curriculum is that the basis of the entire syllabus is considered to be science
 spencer ke anusaar vigyaan dwaara hi samgr jivan jeena sambhav he
 Spencer has offered the following courses to serve the purpose of a holistic life
 pracheen kaaleen shikshan paddati main adhyaaapak kriyasheel rahete the
 The place of boys was secondary, but more emphasis was placed on the activity of the boy by the naturalists
 ye ratane tathaa niskriy abhyaas kii vidhi kaa virodh karte hai tathaa ‘karke seekhney’ evam ‘anubhav dwaara seekhney’ ke siddhanton par aadhaarit vidhiyon ke prayog par bal dete hai
 In addition, the naturalist ideology gave birth to Project Method, Scout, Movement, School Union, Children Club etc
 prakrutivaadee shikshan vidhi ke nimnlikhit siddhanth par vishesh mahatv dete hai- In naturalist education, the teacher has a secondary position
 prakrutivaadee vichaarak prakruti ko hi vaastavik shikshika maanate hai
 In his view, the child should be given an opportunity to get education in the natural environment by keeping them away from society
 ruson ke anusaar shikshak par samaaj ke kusanskaron kaa prabhaav itnaa pad gaya hota he ki vah baalkon ko sadguni banane kaa prayaas bhale hi kar len, vah unhen sadguni bana nahin saktaa kyonki vah swayan sadguni nahin he
 Therefore the Russians do not want to give any place to the teacher in the early education of the child
 anya prakrutivaadee ruso ke atirek ko sweekaar nahin karte
 He considers the role of teacher in the education of children only as assistant and guide
 isliye shikshak ko manovigyaan kaa gyaata hona chaiye
 He should be aware of the wishes, needs, interests and mental development of the child
 shikshak ke liye balak kii swatah aatmasfoort kriyaaon kaa jaananaa aavashyak he
 Because the student does his education by these self-powers, the teacher does only a combination of appropriate conditions
 yadi seekhney kaa parinaam sukhad hota he to balak seekhney main anand letaa he
 And it frequents the said educational experience
 shikshak se yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah balak ke liye anukulit vaataavaran taiyaar kare
 According to Russo the school itself is a special type of society
 is samaaj ke dwaara baalkon ko bhavi samaaj ke yogya banaaya jaataa he
 Through this society, he learns the feeling of self-governance
 netritv karne tathaa prakrutivaadee uddeshyon kii purti karne hetu apane ko taiyaar karata he
 This type of school society is not rigid
 yadhyapi ruso ne skool main ek chaatr tathaa ek adhyaaapak kii kalpana kiya he
 Normally, naturalists oppose formal education in some way, hence it does not give any important place to the school, and asks the children to stay away from the contaminated environment and stay in the natural environment
 inhen vichaaron ke kaaran prakrutivaadee vichaarak skulon ko kritrim kathor evam drudh bandhanon vaali sanstha nahin chaahate
 According to the naturalists, representation of children is also necessary in the system of subjects related to curriculum and concomitant activities etc
 isliye unhen bhraman, deshaatan, khel kud, scouting, samaaj seva ityadi kaaryakramon kii swayan hi vyavastha karne kii swatantraaa deni chaiye
 Teachers should only discharge the role of pioneer
 prakrutivaadee vichaarak shiksha main anushaasan ko mahatv nahin dete he
 They believe in the law of 'cause and consequence'
 unke anusaar prayek vyakti jo karm karata he,uskaa parinaam vah avashya bhogata he
 These results are both pleasurable and painful
 is aadhaar par anushaasan sthapit karne ke do upanium dikhaai dete hai - According to Rousseau's theory, nature is punished for bad actions of a child
 isliye use kisi prakaar kaa dand na dekar prakritik dand dwaara anushaasit hone diya janaa chaiye, jabaki spencer ke siddhanth ke anusaar balak sukhadaayi kaaryon ko baar baar duhraana chahta he
 Because it gives him a feeling of happiness while he gives up sad things, because it makes him suffer
 is prakaar balak anushaasit dhang se vyavhaar karne lagata he or usamen swanushasan kii bhaavana viksit hone lagati he
 Some naturalist thinkers oppose any kind of 'repressive theory' for the establishment of discipline in the education system
 unka vichaar he ki baalkon par shikshakon kaa prabhaav vishesh rup se padataa he
 Therefore, to develop a sense of discipline in children, 'naturalistic principles should be resorted to, while many naturalist thinkers believe that it is better if discipline is established according to natural rules
 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prakrutivaadee baalkon main swanushasan kii bhaavana ke vikaas ke liye ‘mukttmak siddhanth’ par vishesh bal dete hai

 For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws
 rus or china jaise rajyon jo bern kanvension main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna nahin rakhte the, ne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan kii sadsyta kii sambhaavna ko ek shaktishaalee pralobhan paaya he
 In addition, unlike other agreements on intellectual property, TRIPS has a powerful enforcement mechanism states can be disciplined through the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism
 trips kii aavashyaktaaon TRIPS are required to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights to member states
 For example, under TRIPS: copirite sharton ko kam se kam 50 varshon tak vistaarit karnaa chahie, jab tak ki lekhak ke jivan par aadhaarit na ho
 Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based on any "formality", such as registration, as specified in the Berne Convention computer program ko copirite kanoon ke tahat "saahitiyik kaary" ke rup main mana janaa chahie or suraksha kii samaan sharton ko praapt karnaa chahie
 National exceptions to copyright are constrained by Bern's three-step test patenton ko "praudyogiki ke sabhi kshetron" main "avishkaar" ke liye pradaan kiya janaa chahie, basharte ve anya sabhi patent yogyata aavashyaktaaon or kam se kam 20 varshon ke liye lagu hona aavashyak he 
 Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided a general exploitation of the work and general exploitation of the patent is not in conflict computer program or patent ke daahine dharakon ke vaid hiton ke liye koi anuchit purvaagrah nahin he

 The transition period for the least developed countries to implement TRIPS extended to 2013, with the possibility of further expansion for pharmaceutical patents by 1 January 2016
 isliye yah tark diya gaya he ki sabhi deshon ko sakht bauddhik sampada pranal banane kii aavashyaktaa ke trips maanak kharaab deshon ke vikaas ke liye hanikaarak hoga
 It has been argued that the most strategic interest of the first, if at all, underdeveloped countries is to use the flexibility available in TRIPS to make the weakest IP law possible

 This is likely due to a lack of legal and technical expertise that rejects legislation that enforces flexibility, which often depends on developed countries directly coping developed country IP law, or technical assistance from world intellectual property

 The unique selling proposition or unique selling point is a marketing concept first proposed as a theory to explain a pattern in successful advertising campaigns of the early 1940s
 khaasiyat is tarah ke abhiyaanon brands switch karne ke liye unhen raji kar liya he ki graahakon ke liye adwitiya prastaav banaaya he jo bataata he
 The term was developed by Ted Bates & Co
's TV advertising pioneer Reeves
 theodor leavit, harvard bijness skool main ek professor, "bhedbhaav companiyaan lagaataar sanlagn karnaa hoga, jisamen sabase mahatvapurn ranneetik or samrik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 ", Suggested that the term has been used to describe a" personal brand "of the market
 aaj, shabd isi prakaar kii vastuon se ki ek vastu ke kisi bhi pahalu kaa ullekh karne ke liye sirf laaparvaahee se anya kshetron main upyog kiya jaataa he yaa
 In reality, the Reeves USP in advertising is widely misunderstood and summarized here in three parts defines regret: Every advertising consumer must make an offer, not just words, product publications, or show-window advertisements
 prayek vigyaapan ke liye prayek pathak ko kahana hoga: "is vishisht laabh ke liye, is utpaada kharidte hai
 " udhaaharan yah khand kisi bhi sutara nahin
 Improve this section by adding references to reliable sources
 bina sutron kii saamagree ko chunauti dekar hataaya ja saktaa he
 Some good current examples of products with a clear USP are: Head & Shoulders: Unique offers that were pioneered when you introduced "get Rid of Dandruff" include: Anacin "fast, fast, incredibly fast relief
" " 1952 main, reeves, bhedbhaav prastaav anya aspirin kii simaaon ke suzav or teen baar doharaa dwaara, anakin ke "vishesh ghatak," caffeine par bada he ki ek tivi vanijyik banaaya:
 Fast Domino's Pizza: "you get hot, fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less or it's free
 " : "
 Your packages are absolutely positive overnight to get there when "M&M:" No, melts in your hand, in your mouth
 " mahanagareey jivan: "mulaakaat yah bhugtan karata he
 
 " dakshin pashchim airlines: "
 We are low-fare airline "
 The development period USP has been largely replaced by the concept of a position statement, popularized by al educational institutions and the publication of Jack Trout's position:
 apane dimag ke liye ladayeesthiti bayaan pratispardhaa kii tulana main upabhokta ke dimag main kabja karnaa chahie
 Applying the model, instructing managers to determine the cognitive gap "functional gains in a given category are valued by most consumers and least dominated by other brands
 " pojishning bhi aamtaur par mindshare vipanan ke rup main janaa jaataa he, uddeshy hissedari ek ke liye hai ke rup main laabh ke daawey ke saath brands ke trademark ko jodne, 'upabhoktaaon ke man main sangyanatmak sangh kaa daawa he "bas, lagaataar or baar-baar ho sake
 " kaarak yaa vichaar ek utpaada yaa seva pratispardhaa kii tulana se alag or behatar he ki kaaran ke rup main ek vikreta dwaara prastut kiya
 Before you start selling your product or service to someone else, you have to sell yourself on it
 apane utpaada yaa seva aap ke aasapaas un logon ke liye isi tarah kii he jab yah vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he
 Very few businesses are doing one-of-a-kind
 bas aap chaaron ore dekhie: vastra khudara vikritaon, hardware kii dukaanon, air condishning sansthaapak or bijli sahi myne main anoothaa hai kitne? is sthiti main prabhavi bikri ke liye mahatvapurn vigyaapan or vipanan peshewaron ek 'adwitiya bikri prastaav "kehete hai
 You can indicate what makes your business unique in the world of homogeneous competitors, unless you can target your sales efforts successfully
 apni khaasiyat bataate kuch kathin aatma khoj or rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa he
 One way to get started is to analyze how other companies use their features to their advantage
 yah anya companiyon ke vigyaapan or vipanan sandeshon ke saavdhaan vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 You can learn a lot about how companies differentiate themselves from competitors, if you analyze what they sell, not just the features of your product or service
 udhaaharan ke liye, charles, revlon ke sansthaapak, hameshaa vah mechap, aashaa nahin bechaa kehete the
 Some airlines sell friendly service, while others sell the service on time
 waal mart saste daamon par bechata he, jabaki macrs, lakjri bechata he
 Each of these is an example of a company to revolve its marketing strategy, on which a USP is found in the "peg"
 ek vyapaar utpaada visheshtaon, keemat sanrachana, placement ranneeti yaa prachaar kii ranneeti par isaki khaasiyat khunti kar sakate hai
 What these markets are calling "char p" marketing
 ve ek vyavsaayik pratispardhaa se alag karata he ki ek bazaar kii sthiti ko dene ke liye chhedchhad kar rahe hai
 Sometimes a company also focuses on a particular "peg," which drives strategy in other areas
 ek clasik udhaaharan haness l andey hojri he
 Back in an era when hosiery was sold primarily in department stores, Hanes opened a new distribution channel for hosiery sales
 vichaar: hojri ek upabhokta pradhan tha, kyon anya stepal bechaa gaya he, jahaan ise bechney nahin - kiraane kii dukaanon main? Did not seem in the supermarket, so that placement strategy then drove the company's selection of product packaging
 utpaada dabaaya or utak or bakse main lipte hone ke liye nahin tha, kyonki yah anya brandon kii tulana main kam keemat ho saktaa he

 Infectious diseases, diseases that are caused by some pathogenic factors like protozoa, fungi, bacteria, viruses, etc
 sankramak rogon main ek sharir se anya sharir main failane kii kshamta hoti he
 Malaria, typhoid, smallpox, influenza, etc
 are examples of infectious diseases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne kaha he ki duniya bhar main sankramak rog pehle se kahin zyada teji se fail rahe hai or unka ilaaj karnaa zyada mushkil ho gaya he
 In its annual World Health Report 2008, the United Nations agency stated that one or more new diseases are being detected every year since the 1970s, which is unprecedented
 agency ne kaha he ki tapedic jaisi jaani-maani bimariyon ko niyantrit karne ke prayaas bhi simit ho rahe hai, kyonki ve zyada taqatvar or dawaaiyon kii pratirodhi kismon main viksit hoti ja rahi hai
 The World Health Organization has stated that the reason for the spread of infectious diseases is the increase in international air traffic in the last 50 years
 usne pichley 5 varshon main hi 1,100 se zyada vibhinn bimaariyaan failane kii pushti kii he
 The World Health Organization has requested its 193 members to cooperate more with each other in exchanging virus samples to inform them about the spread of diseases and to help develop vaccines
 tikon ke jariye rogon kaa samay purv muqabla karnaa or unhen niyantra main rakhana maanav dwaara rogon ke ilaaj main praapt prashansaneey pragati he
 According to a report published by the World Health Organization, millions of children are still suffering from infectious diseases every year in the world, but twenty lakh of them could have been saved through vaccines
 hamen sarvapratham yah jaananaa chaiye ki tikaa kya he
 The vaccine is actually a product developed based on the processing of a virus, according to Mr
 Wu Chiang, an expert at the Disease Center of China's capital city of Beijing
 ise khaane yaa sui ke jariye maanav sharir main pravisht karaane se maanav sharir main asli vishaanuon kaa muqabla karne kii shakti paidaa kii jaati he
 The vaccine is completely different from the virus, because the virus causes the disease, but the vaccine produces the power to combat the disease
 varsh 1796 main ek british doctor maanav sharir main gaay main hone vaale ek rog ke chechak jaise vishaanu kubox ko pravisht karaane ke jariye chechak kaa ilaaj karne main safal rahaa tha
 This is how humans invented the smallpox vaccine
 varsh 1980 main vishwa chikitsa sanghathan ne chechak kii samaapti kii ghoshnaa kii, jo rog pratirakshan kshamta ke jariye khatm kiya jane vaala pratham rog tha
 After that, humans acquired the ability to produce vaccines for a number of diseases, such as smallpox, plague, whooping cough, Rohini, Hanustambha, measles and mad dog disease through long-term efforts
 sankramak rogon ke mukaable main tikon kii vishesh bhoomika kii vajah se vibhinn deshon main tikaa lagane ko bahut mahatv diya jaataa he
 In China too, this work started long ago
 idhar teji se saamaajik va aarthik vikaas karte china main tikaa lagane ko adhikadhik mahatv diya ja rahaa he or bacchon ko tikaa lagane ke kaary ko vishesh mahatv praapt he
 In China, the work of enhancing disease immunity is done as planned
 china main saat varsh se kam umr ke sabhi bacchon ko polio, khasre, pilia, tapedic, kaali khaansee or rohinee aadi rogon ke tike lagaaye jate hai
 The government spends its main expenses
 bacchon ke maa-baap kaa is par bahut kam kharch aata he
 There has been tremendous progress since the work began in China since the 1970s
 isse chini bacchon kii rog pratirakshan kshamta bahut unnat ho gayi
 According to the Chinese pediatrician, Dr
 Hu Yamei, when China suffered from SARS in 2003, no child in China succumbed to the disease
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki chini bacchon ko khasre kaa tikaa lagaaye jane se unamem sars kaa muqabla karne kii shakti paidaa hui
 That's why very few Chinese children succumbed to SARS in 2003
 sars kii vajah se kisi kisi bachche kii mrityu bhi nahin hui
 It is learned that 15 years ago, China had completed the target of vaccinating 15 percent of its children
 sanyukt raashtra bal kosh, vishwa chikitsa sanghathan or chini swasthya mantralay ne is kaary kii sanyukt jaanch kii or is kaa ucch moolyankan kiya
 Vaccines have greatly reduced infectious diseases like measles in China
 misaal ke liye 1960 ke dashak main isse hone vaali mrityu kii dar prati lakh 2000 se ghatakar 10 tak gir gai
 China had ended smallpox in the year 1960 and in the year 2000 it won the war to eradicate polio
 china sarkaar dwaara bacchon ke liye tay paanch aavashyak tikon ke atirikt chini logon ko apane bacchon ko aspataalon main apane kharch par flu or pilia aadi rogon kaa tikaa lagavane kii suvidha bhi hasil he
 Apart from children, older people can also get necessary vaccines in the hospital for prevention of infectious diseases arising in different seasons
 yahaan yah bhi charchit he ki china main kute bhi khaase zyada hai, isliye logon ko pagal kute ke rog kaa tikaa lagane kii bhi jarurat he
 Chinese experts are now researching new vaccines to combat new infectious diseases
 chini rog nirodh socity ke visheshgy doctor ho shyung kaa kahana he ki chini visheshgy kai naye tikon ke avishkaar main lage hai
 There is also great potential for combating AIDS, cancer and some chronic serious diseases through vaccines
 isliye is sandarbh main kii ja rahi koshishon arthhin nahin rahengi

 Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur, popularly known as Babur, was a Mughal ruler whose origin was Central Asia

 He was the great-grandson of Timur Lung, and believed that Genghis Khan was the ancestor of his dynasty

 Babur was born in the Fargana Valley in a city called Andijan, which is now in Uzbekistan

 Although Babur's origins were related to the Barlas clan of Mongolia but the people of that clan were greatly influenced by Persian and Ottoman life, they converted to Islam and made Turkestan their habitat
 babar kii maatrubhaasha chaghtai bhashaa thi par farsi, jo us samay us sthaan kii aam bolchaal kii bhashaa thi, main bhi wo praveen tha
 He wrote his biography in Babri Nama in Chagatai

 In addition to the Turks, Persians, Pashtos in his army, there were also people from Barlas and Central Asian clan
 kaha jaataa he ki babar bahut hi tagada or shaktishaalee tha
 It is also said that he used to run two people on both the shoulders on the gradient shield for exercise only

 He swam across the Ganges twice
 babar ke chachere bhai mirza mohammad haidar ne likhaa he ki us samay, jab chaagatai log asabhy tathaa asanskrit the tab unhe zahir ud-din mohammad kaa uccharan kathin laga
 For this reason, he named it Babur

 Babur was the great ruler of the Mughal period
 san 1494 main 12varsh kii aayu main hi use fargana ghati ke shaasha kaa pad saunpa gaya
 His uncles took advantage of this situation and removed Babur from the throne

 In 1496, he invaded the Uzbek city of Samarkand and conquered it after 7 months
 isi bich, jab vah samarkand par akraman kar rahaa tha tab, uske ek sainik sargana ne fargana par apana adhipaty jamaa liya
 When Babur was coming to Fargana to take possession of it, his army left him in Samarkand, which resulted in both Samarkand and Fargana leaving his hands
 san 1501 main usne samarkand par punah adhikaar kar liya par jald hi use uzbek khan mohammad shaibani ne haraa diya or is tarah samarkand, jo uske jivan kii ek badi khwaahish thi, uske haathon se phir waapas nikal gaya
 After escaping from Fargana with his few loyal soldiers, he concentrated on building his army for the next three years

 But within two months, he had to leave Herat for want of resources

 It was there that he came to know about the works of the Uygur poet Mir Ali Shah Nawai, who was in favor of making the Chagatai language the language of literature

 Within two years of his return to Kabul, another kingpin rebelled against him and had to flee from Kabul

 Here in 1510, Shah Isma'il i of Persia, who was the ruler of the Safivi dynasty, defeated Muhammad Shaybani and killed him
 is sthiti ko dekhakar babar ne heraat par punah niyantran sthapit kiya
 He then entered into an agreement with Shah Ismail i to establish suzerainty over Central Asia
 shah ismail kii madad ke badale main umane safaviyon kii shreshthata sweekaar kii tathaa khud evam apane anuyaayiyon ko safaviyon kii prabhutaa ke adheen samajha
 In response to this, Shah Ismail introduced Babur to his sister Khanzada whom Shayabani, whom Shah Ismail had defeated and killed recently, was imprisoned and was trying to force her to marry him

 After this, considering the Shah's help in Persia as unnecessary, he stopped taking Shah's help

 He was also welcomed there and once again the villages of the village became empty to congratulate him

 With a view to providing means to the Central Government to implement its industrial policies, several legislations have been implemented and have been amended to suit the changing environment
 sabase mahatvapurn he audyogic adhinium, 1951 jo audyogic niti sankalp, 1948 ke anusaran main lagu kiya gaya tha
 The Act was formulated by the Central Government for the purpose of development and registration of industries in India
 adhinium ke mukhya uddeshy sarkaar ke nimnlikhit shaktiyaan pradaan karnaa he:- udyogon ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak kadam uthaanaa; audyogic vikaas kii paddati or disha ko niyantrit karnaa; janhit main audyogic upakramon ke kaaryakalapon, nishpaadan or parinaamon ko niyantrit karnaa he
 The Act applies to 'scheduled Industries' in the First Schedule to this Act
 lekin, laghu audyogic upkram tathaa anushanbee ikaayiyon ko adhinium ke upbandhon se chhot di gai he
 The Act is administered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce through its Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
 diipipi audyogic kshetra ke vikaas ke liye sanvardhanatmak or vikasaatmak taiyaari karne or karyanvit karne ke liye jimmedaar he

 Legal positivism is an ideology related to philosophy of law and jurisprudence
 iskaa vikaas adhikanshtah attharahavin evam unnisvin shatabdi ke vidhi-chintakon dwaara hua jinamein jeremi bentham tathaa jon austin kaa naam pramukh he
 But the most notable name in the history of legal positivism is that of HLA Hart, whose book titled 'the Concept of Law' forced a deeper consideration of the subject
 haal ke varshon main ronaald dorkin ne vidhik pratyakshvaad ke kuch kendriya vichaaron par gambheer sawaal uthaaye hai
 Legal positivism is difficult to summarize, but it is often believed that the central idea of legal positivism is: vishleshnatmak chintan kaa prarambh mukhyatah bentham dwaara atharahavin shatabdi ke ant main kiya gaya jiskaa vikaas aage chalakar austin ke haathon hua
 It is also called theistic ideology
 samand ise vyavasthit vidhishastra tathaa si0ke0 alan aadeshaatmak siddhanth kehete hai
 The biggest feature of this ideology is that just as physics progresses on the strength of analysis, in the same way it does not accept anything without analysis
 prakritik vichaardhaara kii tarah yah vidhi ko divine yaa daiv jaat yaa praapt nahin maanati, balki iskaa udbhav samprabhu rajya se hua maanati he
 This ideology analyzes legal rules
 isliye yah aitihaasik yaa samajashastreey vichaardhaara se bhinn ho jaati he
 This ideology wants to study the mutual relations of civil law and other methods in an analytical manner and considers the method not to be achieved but created
 vidhi kii aitihaasik pragati kaa mul kya he, isse is vichaardhaara kaa koi matlab nahin
 Julius Stone has rightly said, "its main interest is to analyze legal meanings and to investigate the logical interrelations of legal reasoning sentences
" samand ne is vichaardhaara ke prayojan ko in shabdon main vyakt kiya he- According to Munro Smith, this ideology is considered necessary for the state's conscious seal method
 is arth main vidhi sachetan or nishchit maanav ichha kii abhivyakti he
 Authenticism provides a scientific approach that allows the data presented to be confined to the experience by rejecting hypotheses beyond experience
 yah drushtikon die hue tathyon ke vishleshan tak simit rahata he tathaa anubhuti kii parighatnaon se dur nahin jaataa he
 Staying away from the hypotheses of the past and the future, it has been named as the authentic approach due to the factual study of 'method as it is'
 england main mukhya rup se prachlit hone tathaa austin se jude hone ke naate ise english yaa astinian skool bhi kehete hai
 It is also called obedient theory because of the compulsion of law to be considered as the command of Samprabhu
 heart ise ‘‘samadesh, anushaasti evam samprabhu kii triveni’’ maanate hai
 In this ideology, special emphasis is laid on the constructive elements of law by man
 atharahavin shatabdi ke ant tathaa unnisvin shatabdi ke prarambh hote-hote is vichaardhaara kaa janm nimnlikhit kaarnon se hua
 1
 The eighteenth century belonged to the natural law thinkers in which the principles of policy, prudence and justice dominated legal philosophy
 yah ‘vidhi jaisi honi chahie’ kaa yug tha
 But it did not remain consistent for a long time
 bentham ne swayan ko is prakaar kii vichaardhaara se alag kar liya tathaa vyaakhyaatmak vidhishastra arthath ‘vidhi jo he’ par bal diya
 This implies that analytical ideology was born as opposed to natural law ideology
 2
 unnisvin shatabdi ke prarambh main bhautik vigyaan main hui pragati kaa prabhaav nishchit rup se vidhik vigyaan ke siddhanton par bhi padaa
 Methods of evidence, reasoning, examination and analysis of given facts were adopted for the study of method
 vidhi ke adhyayan ke liye vaigyanik, krambaddh anubhavjanya yaa anubhav saapeksh paddati apanaayi gayi

 It seems that by analyzing ideology the sovereignty ruler was proved superior in England over the feudal and the pope etc
 is vichaardhaara ke saath hi vidhi ke kshetra main aadhyatmik dakhlandaji kam ho gai
 Legal legalism has also been called the prescriptive principle of law as state sovereign and law as command of sovereign and due to interpretation of the element of discipline in compliance with law
 vidhik pramanwad kaa prayog vibhinn arthon main kiya gaya he
 The modern analytic theorist thinker Prof
 HLA Hart himself has accepted its use in five meanings
 heart ne in paanch arthon main kiye gayi prayog kii vaastavik prishthbhumi main vyakhya karte hue yah spasht kiya he ki bentham or austin se lekar tak die gayi siddhanton ko maanate hai parantu or vaale siddhanton ko nahin
 Similarly, Kelsen has accepted the principles expressed in and, but not the principles given in and
 heart ke anusaar main varnit siddhanth ko bentham, austin or kelson main se kisi ne nahin mana he
 Yet this theory is often associated with analytical jurisprudents without obvious reasons

 taapan or sanvathan yugon se bhojan or jivan ke saath-saath taapan kii samasya bhi manushya ke mastishk ko uljhaati rahi he
 Not only is it important in the cold regions, heating also becomes mandatory in many hot regions
 kintu bhojan kii bhanti iske liye manushya ko baahar kii ore nahin dekhnaa padaa, kyonki yah sharir swayan hi ooshmaa kaa strot he or yadi sharir se nikalanevaali ooshmaa ko surakshit rakhane ke liye aavashyak upaay kar liye jaaen to manushya kii taapan samasya hal ho jaati he
 Man is a warm blooded creature
 iske sharir kaa taap apekshaakrit unchaa rahata he
 Food provides fuel to maintain the body
 jab baahar kaa taap kam rahata he, tab sharir se ooshmaa kaa vikiran hota rahata he
 An average healthy body produces as much heat as a 100-watt electric bulb
 kapado se yah ooshmaa haani kuch ruuk jaati he
 Wearing too much clothing does not cause heat loss at the speed with which it is produced
 falat: sharir ko ksht hota he, uskaa taap bad jaataa he or gadabadi aa jaati he
 If the clothes are worn too little then the heat generated is higher than that, consequently the body becomes cold and troublesome
 vastav main kisi bhi dasha main maanav sharir ko bahari ooshmaa pahunchaane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, balki anek paristhitiyon main un kamaron ko hi ushn rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo maanav ke nivasasthaan he, taaki shaareerik ooshmaa kii haani utani hi ho jitani sharir main utpann hoti he
 It has been known from experience that for a normally healthy person wearing simple clothes, 18
40 centimeter at knee height
 The temperature is pleasant
 anek saamaanya taapan paddatiyon dwaara itnaa taap laane main sir ke baraabar oonchaai par taap lagbhag 21

 ho jaataa he
 Even then, there is loss of heat from the body, but not so much that the body becomes very cold
 iskaa praarambhik rup aaj bhi anek aviksit sthanon main miltaa he, jahaan gupha yaa tambu ke bheetar ek gadhe main aag rakh di jaati he
 Slowly the discovery was made and a hole was made in the roof or wall, which let the smoke out

 Then metal stoves came into use, which could also be placed in the middle of the room and transported to the chimney by smoke tubes
 dhire dhire nirdhoom idhan ke rup main lakdi ke koyale kii khoj hui or yah sadhran taapan main bahut kaam aayaa
 It was widely used on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and through Asia to China, Japan
 dakshini italy main chhichhli sigadiyon main, jinhen aavashyaktaanusaar ek kamare se duusare kamare main le ja sakate hai, yahi jalaayaa jaataa he
 In addition to this local heating system, a central heating system was developed by the ancient Romans and other civilized castes
 badi badi imaaraton ke farshon, deevaaron or chhaton main dhoomanaliyaan bani hoti thim or agnidah se utpann gaisen unamem gumti thim
 They used to heat the building by radiation
 inke udhaaharan rome main karakala ke snanagaron main tathaa englad main bath ke roman snanagaron main ab bhi dikhaai dete he
 In principle, this system has also been adopted in modern heating and is operational in many parts of Russia without any change
 taapan kii anek paddatiyon main chaar prakriyaayein ek duusare ke baad hoti hai
 The first is energy release, which occurs in an intended furnace, fireplace or boiler
 idhan ke jalte samay usamen nihit rasinic urja mukt hokar ooshmaa main parivartit ho jaati he, jisase koi pravaahee padaarth, jaise hawa, bhaap yaa pani garm kiya jaataa he
 In the second process, the heat-carrying material travels to the place where the heat is released
 teesri prakriya main, ushma pravaahee padaarth se mukt hokar kamare kii vaayu yaa kisi upkaran, jese ushma vikirak yaa tapanukoolak aadi ke bahari tal, main pahunchati he
 The fourth process is that of heat distribution, so that it can spread everywhere in the room
 ek kedriya sthaan par ooshmaa utpann karke use badi badi imaaraton main, yaa kai imaaraton main, aavashyaktaanusaar sabhi sthanon tak le laana kendriya taapan kehalaata he
 Nowadays it is often accomplished in two ways: indirect or hot air and direct, in which heat by steam or hot water reaches the designated place, where the radiators disperse it
 ushn-vaayu-taapan main sanvaahan dwaara ooshmaa nirdisht sthaan tak pahunchati he
 In a large furnace, which is usually in the basement, ek pankhe dwaara ushn vaayu kamare main bheji jaati he tathaa thandi vaayu garm hone ke liye bhatthi main laut aati he
 A
 warm air flow, b
 Cold air grating, c
 Warm air passage, d
 Cold air return, f
 Fan and air filtering equipment and g
 vaayu garm kii jaati he
 The hot air rises and reaches the thermocouples passing through large channels, which leave it in the rooms
 kabhi kabhi dhaukaniyaan yaa pankhe bhi prayukt hote hai, taaki vaayu kii gati bad jaae or uskaa vitaran ek sa ho
 This method is often adopted in private houses due to being cheap
 yadhyapi yah ushnjalataapan, yaa vaashpataapan jaisi prabhavotpadak nahin, phir bhi yah shdhritapurvak cameraa garam karne ke liye uttam vidhi he kuch ushn vayutapan sanyantr garmi main sheet vaayu bhi de sakate he
 This method is very prevalent in the United States and Canada, because there is a fear of freezing water or steam due to extreme cold
 vaashp yaa ushn-jal-taapan-paddati praaia: sabhi badi yaa ausat darje kii imaaraton main apanaai jaati he
 Hot water heating maybe parisancharan tatra dwaara is pranali main jal sancharit hota he

 And in 1791, Hoyle, an investigator from Halifax, patented his method
 boyler, nal or vikirak is paddati ke mukhya ang hai
 Due to the high cost of tap system, radiators and wages etc
, this method is more expensive than the hot air method, but it is more reliable than that
 vikirak aise sthanon par rakhane se jahaan taapahani sarvaadhik hoti he, is paddati se ooshmaa kaa vitaran apekshaakrit adhik ek sa hota he
 The temperature of the steam rotating in the steam-heating plant can be 100 ° C, but if the air pressure within the tubes is reduced, it is possible to evaporate even at this temperature
 yah aanshik nirvathan pump dwaara sampann hota he
 Once the heat is distributed, some steam is created and a partial vacuum remains in the plant, which keeps the sequence going
 is prakaar lagbhag 850 sein0 tak ke kam taap par hi bhaap banati rahati he
 Very little heat is distributed by radiative handling, only a small amount of heat is delivered by conduction
 mukhyatya vikiran dwaara hi adhik ooshmaa praapt hoti he
 The amount of heat dissolved depends on the size of the radiators and their open magnitudes
 ye bahudhaa The hot steam of the water passing through the riser goes into the radiator and the condensed water comes back into the boiler from the same tube

 Places are placed where air enters, such as under windows
 inke sampark main aakar vaayu garm ho jaati he ore kamare main upar kii ore fail jaati he
 One difficulty with the above general methods is that the air near the roof becomes very hot, such that the temperature will be 15
0 cm near the knees, 20
0 cm near the head, 24
0 cm near the ceiling and only 12
0 cm near the floor
 itnaa kam taap sukhad nahin hota
 If an attempt is made to increase the temperature near the floor, then the room upstairs becomes so hot that there is no happiness
 aise tapantar se bachane ke liye vikiran ooshman kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 By not placing a wick in any wall of the room, the coil or tap of the water taps are pressed into the floor in sufficient length
 inke bheetar garm jal bahane se farsh garm ho jaataa he or ooshmaa vikeern hoti he
 Heat from radiation heat is directly heated on a person's body by special heating of the middle air, which is more dear and the temperature inside the room is not high
 farsh ke bheetar bani naaliyon main ushn vaayu pravaahit karke bhi aisa hi prabhaav utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Hot water or hot air taps are also installed in walls or roofs instead of floors
 yah vyavastha pracheen kaal main kendriya taapan ke liye romanon dwaara banawaye gaye hipocast jaisi hi he
 For this, special radiators are placed in the room at appropriate places or places
 kuch vikirak aise hote hai jinamein gas jalati hai or ek pankhaa garm hawa failaata rahata he
 In some, the metal is heated by gas and radiates heat
 kuch aise bhi hote he, jinamein pani garm hokar bhaap ban jaataa he or us bhaap se bhari hui naliyon kii kundali se ooshmaa vikeern hoti he
 The electric heater is also a radiator, which is often used
 isamen vidyutpratirodh kii tarakundali vidyut shakti se garm ho jaati he or ooshmaa vikeern hoti he
 Most sources of local heat are relatively very hot
 at: unase vikeern ooshmaa bahut adhik maatra main praapt hoti he
 The mid-air is relatively cold
 yah bahut sukhad hota he ki vyakti ke pair to sukhoshna rahen or uskaa sir sheethal
 Yes, there is a drawback in this that the nearest place becomes more hot, whereas in the same room, the distant cold remains
 ooshmaa utpann ke nimitt idhan ke rup main praaia: pathar kaa koyala, coke, tel yaa gas kaam main aati he
 The use of electricity increases simplicity and cleanliness, but increases costs
 bijli bahudhaa sthaneey taapan ke liye prayukt hoti he, jahaan thodaa sthaan shighratapurvak garm karnaa hota he
 In the United States, where natural gas is found, it is transported hundreds of miles away by drains and used for heating and industry
 jahaan garm pani ke sote adhik hote hai, vahaan se garm pani asanvaahit nalon dwaara dur dur tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The hot spring water in Iceland is used for heating up to 40 miles away
 kisi sthaan se gandi vaayu nikaalkar vahaan svachh vaayu pahunchaana sanvathan kehalaata he
 There is a lot of variation in the ideas related to ventilation
 kisi desh main to khuli hawa kaa pravesh, chaahe usase taap girtaa hi kyon na ho, swasthya or sukh ke liye anivaary samajha jaataa he iske vipareet germany main yah vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki jaade main hawa kamare main se hokar na aane paae
 Still there is no visible side effect of it
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay gasarodhak kakshon se yah anubhav praapt hua ki sharir se vikeern ooshmaa diwaar aadi jin talon par padati he unka kshetrafal hi sukhanubhuti kii kasuti he, na ki vaayu main mishrit carbon dioxide kaa ansh
 Natural ventilation is subject to the difference of heat inside and outside and direction and speed of air
 isapar yantric sadhano dwaara, jaise vaayu kaa pravesh karaane yaa nikaalanevaale pankhons dwaara, purna niyantran rakhana sambhav he
 This works for common habitats, but in mines and many types of factories, where dust mixed with particulate matter, paint, smoke, metal, wood, etc
 can enter the workers' breath, the law It is necessary to remove exhaust fans at the original source to remove such dust
 aisi dasha main prakritik sanvathan par bharosa na karke purnataya kritrim sanvathan kaa prabandh kiya jaataa he
 Although ventilation is not air conditioning in itself, air movement is the major process of air conditioning
 vaataanukoolan ke sampurna sanyantr main dhavan, ardrikaran, nirdhuman, durgrandhaharan aadi sabhi sammilit hai
 In addition to making the residence pleasant, air-conditioning is also required in many industries, such as there should be some humidity in the air for spinning cotton

 In the Indian tradition, any systematic text, theory, method, device, technique or methodology is also called a system
 hindu parampara main tantra mukhyatah shakt sampradaay se judaa hua he, uske baad shaiva sampradaay se, or kuch seemaa tak vaishnav parampara se bhi
 In the Shaivite tradition, the speakers of the Tantra texts are generally Shiva
 buddha dharm kaa vajrayan sampradaay apane tantra-sambandhi vichaaron, karmkandon or sahitya ke liye prasiddh he
 The literal origin of Tantra is believed to be like this - "tanoti Triati Tantra"
 jisase abhipraay he – tanana, vistaar, failaav is prakaar isse traan hona tantra he
 Tantra traditions are found in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain philosophies

 tantra kaa prabhaav vishwa str par he
 Evidence of this is the scriptures of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Tibetan etc
 religions
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi bengal, bihar or rajasthan tantra ke garh rahe hai
 This scripture is divided into three parts - agam, yamal and main tantra
 vaarahi tantra ke anusaar jisamen sristi, pralay, devataaon kii puja, sab kaaryon ke sadhana, purashcharan, shatkarm- saadhan or chaar prakaar ke dhyanyog kaa varnan ho, use aagam kehete hai
 In which the description of creation, astrology, daily work, order, sutra, varbheda and Yugadharma is called Yamal
 or jisamen sristi, lat, mantranirnay, devataaon, ke santhaan, yantranirnay, tirth, ashram, dharm, kalp, jyotish santhaan, vrath-katha, shouch or ashauch, stri-purush-lakshan, rajdharm, daan- dharm, yuvadharm, vyavhaar tathaa aadhyatmik vishyon kaa varnan ho, vah tantra kehalaata he 
 The theory of this scripture is that in Kali Yuga there is no result of Vedic mantras, chants and yagyas etc
 is yug main sab prakaar ke kaaryon kii siddhi ke liye tantrashaastra main varnit mantron or upayon aadi se hi sahaayta milti he 
 The principles of this scripture are kept very secret and a man has to be initiated first to take his teachings
 aajkal praayah maaran, ucchatan, vaseekaran aadi ke liye tathaa anek prakaar kii siddhiyon aadi ke saadhan ke liye hi tantrokt mantron or kriyaaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 This scripture is primarily of the devotees and its mantras are often meaningless and monolithic
 jaise,— hnin, clin, shrin, sthin, shun, kru aadi 
 The Panchamakara of Tantrikas - alcohol, meat, fish, mudra and maithun - and Chakrapooja are famous
 tantric sab devataaon kaa pujan karte hai par unki puja kaa vidhaan sabase bhinn or swatantra hota he 
 In Chakrapuja and many other pujas, tantric people treat alcohol, meat and fish in a great manner and worship women like Dhobin, Tallin etc
 naked
 yadhyapi atharvaveda samhita main maaran, mohan, ucchatan or vaseekaran aadi kaa varnan or vidhana he tathaapi aadhunik tantra kaa uske saath koi sambandh nahin hai 
 Some believe that modern system has been propagated in India during and after Kanishka's time
 chini yatri phahiyaan or huensang ne apane lekhon main is shaastra kaa koi ullekh nahin kiya he 
 Although it cannot be said with certainty when Tantra was propagated, there is no doubt that it is not older than 4th or 5th century AD
 hinduon kii dekhadekhi baudhon main bhi tantra kaa prachaar hua or tatsambandhi anek granth bane 
 Hindu tantrik calls them 'upatantar'
 unka prachaar tibet tathaa china main he 
 It is also written in Varahi Tantra that sages like Jaimini, Kapil, Narada, Garga, Pulastya, Bhrigu, Venus, Jupiter etc
 have also created many subsystems
 vyakaran shaastra ke anusaar 'tantra' shabd ‘tan’ dhaatu se bana he jiskaa arth he 'vistaar'
 It is interpreted in the 'kaayak Agam' of Shaiva Siddhanta, Tanyate Vyashyate Gyanam Anen, Iti Tantram tantra kii nirukti ‘tan’ or ‘trai’, in donon dhaatuon ke yoga se siddh hoti he
 This means that the system, in its overall sense, extends the knowledge as well as conducts those who conduct it
 tantra-shaastra kaa ek naam 'aagam shaastra' bhi he
 It is said about this- vachaspati mishra ne yoga bhashya kii tatvavaisharadi vyakhya main 'aagam' shabd kaa arth karte hue likhaa he ki jisase abhyuday or nickshreyas ke upaay buddhi main aate hai, vah 'aagam' kehalaata he
 Another form of the scriptures is called ‘nigam’
 nigam ke antargat veda, puraana, upanishad aadi aate hai
 It deals with knowledge, karma and worship etc
 isiilie veda-shastron ko nigam kehete hai
 The scripture which describes the form of remedies used to practice that form, is called 'agam'
 tantra athwa aagam main vyavhaar paksh hi mukhya he
 The system emphasizes actions and rituals
 ‘vaarahi tantra’ main is shaastra ke jo saat lakshan bataae hai, unamem vyavhaar hi mukhya he
 These seven traits are- tantra kaa saamaanya arth he 'vidhi' yaa 'upaay'
 There is no principle or method
 siddhanton ko lekar matbhed ho sakate hai
 Deities and disputes may also occur, but there is no disagreement regarding the law
 doobane se bachane ke liye tairkar hi aana padegaa
 If you want electricity, you will have to convert coal and water molecules
 daudane ke liye paanv aage badhaane hi honge
 If you want to climb a mountain, there is no choice without stepping towards the height
 yah kriyaayein 'vidhi' kehalaati hai
 The practicality is main in a system or prophecy
 tantra kii drushti main sharir pradhan nimitt he
 Without it the higher peaks of consciousness cannot be reached
 isi kaaran se tantra kaa taatpary ‘tan’ ke madhyam se aatma kaa ’traan’ yaa apane aapkaa uddhaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This meaning is true only to a extent
 vastav main tantra sadhana main sharir, man or kaay kalevar ke sookshmatam staron kaa samanvit upyog hota he
 It is certainly true that the system gives as much importance to the body as to the mind, intellect and mind
 karmkand or puja-upasna ke tareeke sabhi dharmon main alag-alag hai, par tantra ke sambandh main sabhi ekamat hai
 All religions believe that eternal energy is hidden within the human being, only five-seven percent of it comes into use, the remaining part remains unused
 sabhi dharm–sampradaay is baat ko ek mat se sweekaar karte hai va apane hisaab se us bhaag kaa maarg bhi bataate hai
 Followers of those religions often employ similar methods to awaken their hidden powers
 unamem jap, dhyaan, ekaagratha kaa abhyaas or sharirgat urja kaa saghan upyog shaamil hota he
 This is the representation of the system
 tantrokt matanusaar mantron ke dwaara yantra ke madhyam se bhagwaan kii upasna kii jaati he
 To clarify the subject, even if the scripture talks about the principle, otherwise three quarters of the Agama-scriptures teach only the methods
 tantra ke sabhi granth shiv or parvati ke samvaad ke antargat hi prakat hai
 Goddess Parvati questions and Shiva preaches a method while answering them
 adhikansh prashn samasyapradhan hi hai
 Even if a question has been asked in relation to the theory, Shiva describes the method only after giving his answer in few words
 aagam shaastra ke anusaar 'karnaa' hi jaananaa he, anya koi 'jaananaa' gyaan kii paribhaasha main nahin aata
 There is no answer or solution until something is done, not entered into cultivation
 tantron kii vishay vastu ko mote taur par nimna taur par batalaaya ja saktaa he- The influence of both the Samkhya and the Advaita thought of Vedanta is reflected in the Tantra texts
