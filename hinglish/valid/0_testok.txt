 Fred R

 This phrase was coined when according to Murphy his equipment failed to perform and it was cast in its current form, before the conference press which was given by Dr
 John Stapp, an American Air Force colonel and in the 1950s The flight was conducted by the surgeon

 Initial tests used a Humanoid crash test, but later tests were performed by Stapp, an air force captain at the time

 islam ke sufi mat se is pravriti ko bal mila

 aadhunik kaal main gandhivaad main bhartiya achaarshastra kii sabhi swasth paramparaon kaa samanvay miltaa he
 The spirituality of the Upanishads, the "ahimsa" of Jaino, the compassion and love of the Buddha, the Karmayoga of the Gita, the cosmopolitanism of Islam, all have a place in Gandhism

 Ethics is difficult to study in all ancient civilizations distinct from philosophy and theology, but this difficulty is more acute in the cultural history of the eastern world than in the western world
 china ke darshanik, dharmik, naitik, saanskrithik mulyon ke do aadi strot hai : "taowad or kalphucheevaad"
 Despite their mutual opposition, the coordination of these two, directly or indirectly, has been the goal of Chinese thinkers

 anek chini darshanik "tao" ke rahasyavaad or ativyaktvaad se bhi asantusht the or kanfushas ke paramparapradhan, aupchaarik upadeshon se bhi
 Hence the emergence of many such creeds who either took the path of compromise or created a new ethos about a particular aspect of life

 prayek vastu, sanstha or sambandh main e donon hi pravritiyaan pratibimbit hai

 or aisi paristhiti ke nirmaan main haath bataana maanav kaa kartavya he
 There is a clear impression of Buddhist ideas on medieval Chinese ethics
 therwaad kii apeksha mahayan kaa or visheshat: madhyamik darshan kaa, china main adhik teji se vikaas hua
 But by bringing Nagarjuna's "nihilism" into the mold of traditional "pragmatism", Chinese thinkers gave Buddhist philosophy a new direction
 is nae darshan kaa naaraa he : "samgr main ek or ek main samgr"
 The Ming era has clear signs of skepticism and hyperphysicalism in the 12th and 13th century ethos, but after the "ming" era cultural resurgence, Chinese ideology again turned to rationalism
 tab se aadhunik yug tak china kaa achaardarshan mukhya rup se buddhivaadee hi rahaa he
 In Zoroastrianism, ethics have been given a very important place

 In "gathas" his personality seems historical, but in "avesta" he becomes fictional mythological
 zarathustradharm mukhyat: dwaitvaadi he
 In "avesta", "ahur" is accepted as the only paramount authority and it is said that the expression of "ahur" occurs in two directions
 ek ore aalaak he, duusari ore andhkaar; ek ore jad bhautik vastu, duusari ore aadhyatm
 But the unity of "ahur" is only formal

 According to him, the material object is an independent power whose constant struggle with spiritual power goes on

pus
 7veen shatabdi se hi yunaan main darshan kii swasth paramparaayen ban chuki thim, parantu protagoras ke pehle vichaarkon ne mukhyat: bahya jagat par hi dhyaan diya tha
 All philosophers from the Thalis to Anaxagoras continued to search for the existence of the world
 sofistapanthiyon ne darshan ke lakshya kaa punarmulayankan kiya tathaa maanav jivan kii pratyaksh samasyaon ko darshanik drushti se aankane kaa ytn kiya
 Protagoras - "man is the test of everything" - This statement of Protagoras reflects both the good and the bad parts of Sophist ethics
 jahaan ek ore is kathan se achaarshastra thos samasyaon kii ore jhukta he vahaan duusari ore vah vyaktigat or saapeksh bhi ban jaataa he
 Protagoras 'humanism resulted from giorgius-gorges' interaction, and this skepticism, on a philosophical level, gave rise to surrealism and hedonism
 sucraat -in vikrutiyon ke viruddh sucraat ne sarvapratham ek aise achaarshastra kaa nirmaan kiya jo adarshavaadi hote hue bhi yatharth paristhitiyon par aadhaarit tha
 Socrates' approach is rational
 "gyaan hi sadachaar he"
 One who has real knowledge of proper deeds, his behavior has to be correct; And the culmination of ignorance is equally important to be in misconduct
 sofistapanthi "nyaay", "niyam", "sanyam" aadi shabdon kaa prayog avashya karte the, par inaki sookshm vyakhya unhone kabhi nahin kii
 Socrates emphasized that the basis of individual moral ideals is knowledge
 jo antar "gyaan" or "jaankaree" main he, vahi niyambaddh achaarshastra or prathajanya naitik dharanaon main he
 The goal of all is the same --- "goodness"
 parantu gyaan dwaara hi "bhalaai" or paramshubh main saamanjasy sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 And the social form of this harmony can be found only in such a state where the rulers consider an art of good life and try to assimilate it
 afalaatoon -sucraat ke udaatt adarshavaad ke prati sachhee nishtha baratate hue afalaatoon plato ne unke upadeshon ko parishkrut rup main rakhaa or unhen darshanik matvaad kaa sahaara diya
 One aspect of Aflatun's ethics is purely elemental
 bhautik jagat kii vastuon kii tathakthith "satta" chaaya maatr he
 Real power is only for expressions or efforts, because suffixes are continual and standalone
 inamen sabase shuddh or ucch shrenee kaa praytn he "shubh"
 In this way the basis of virtue is the auspiciousness of Adisatta
 lekin afalaatoon ke achaardarshan kaa ek doosraa, yathartwaadee paksh bhi he
 a subtle analysis of human nature is found in it
 maanav swabhaav ke-afalaatoon ke shabdon main maanav "aatma" ke-teen vibhaag hai
 They are governed by desire, emotion and intelligence
 pehle do vibhaagon par tisare kaa prabhutv hi sadachaar kaa aadhaar he
 a person not only has a human tendency, that is, rationality, but he also has "animalistic" and "vegetative" tendencies that prevent him from rising above the biological and somatic level
 buddhi kaa uddeshy in pravritiyon kaa vinaash nahin, unka shashan or niyantran he
 The correct interpretation of this objective can only be done at the social level and not at the individual level
 samaaj main maanav swabhaav ke teen angon ke anuroop teen varg hai-shramik, yoddha or shaasha
 This class division is natural and the imagination of a classless society is not justified, because the basis of justice is ultimately natural law
 adarsh vyavastha vah he jisamen prayek varg ke log apane-apane sadgunon kii sadhana karte rahen
 The rulers should be prudent, warriors brave and laboring hardworking and humble
 e sadgun paraspar poorak hai or inkaa uchit maatra main prayog hi "naitik paristhiti" he
 Ultimately, such a situation depends only on the people of the third class, because only the intellect can control the voluntary and emotional tendencies
 shaasha varg kaa drushtikon purnataya darshanik, buddhivaadee hona chahie or iske liye uchit shikshapranali nitant aavashyak he
 Aristotle - The culmination of the Socratic tradition is found in Aristotle's ethics
 arestu ne vishleshan or prayog karte hue aacharan ke vibhinn pahaluon kii vaigyanik dhang se samiksha kii
 The development of ethics as an independent "scripture" begins with Aristotle's "naikomekian Ethics"
 arestu ke anusaar "shubh" kii abhivyakti do dishaao main hoti he
 The first direction is that in which, through practice and effort, the human brings his lower tendencies under the control of the supernatural power - that is, the intellect
 is prayaas ke falswaroop jin sadgunon kii sristi hoti he ve hai "naitik sadgun"
 But there is also another means of auspiciousness - that is, pure wisdom by intellect or the search for extreme truth
 is gyaan or manan se "bauddhik sadgunon" kii sristi hoti he
 An ideal life is a life of contemplation
 
 But the direct relation of ethics is more intimate with moral virtues than intellectual virtues
 naitik gunon kaa aadhaar he madhyam maarg kaa siddhant
 Redundancy on the one hand and absence on the other, morality is possible only by avoiding both these errors
 udhaahranswaroop, "saahas" ek naitik sadgun he
 Its redundancy is "inattention" and its inferiority is "cowardice"
 isi tarah prayek naitik sadgun kii seemayen sthir kii ja sakati hai
 After erispitpus-aristotle, the stream of Greek ethics divided into two opposing directions
 ek ore epicuras ne sukhwad ko or duusari ore jeenon ne sanyasawad ko adarsh ke rup main saamne rakhaa
 In fact, both of these seeds were planted in Socrates era itself
 epicuras ke sukhwad kaa mul strot he "sirenik" achaardarshan or zino kaa "stoik" pranali kaa aadhaar he "sinic" panth kaa sukhwadavirohi darshan
 The originator of the Cyrenaic cult was Aristippus, and the Cynic cult was founded by Antisthenes, a disciple of Socrates
 epicuras -epicureey achaarshastra gyaan or vivek ko saadhan maatr samajhakar santosh yaa samaadhaan ko jivan kaa lakshya maanata he
 Stretches of happiness and the exclusion of grief are natural tendencies
 "sireneik" drushtikon mulat: uchit tha, parantu usamen sukh kii vyakhya sankeern he
 It is foolish to consider only momentary happiness as everything
 hamaara dhey jivan ko samgr rup se sukhmay bananaa he
 Specific pleasures sometimes have to be discarded in this action
 sukhon kii tivrata keval ek paksh he, unke sthayitv par bhi dhyaan dena he
 Mental peace is more pleasing than physical will, because it can keep us satisfied for longer
 sarvocch sadgun "saavdhaanee" he, kyonki vah ek seemaa tak hamen du:kha dard se bachaata he
 The doctrine of zino-stoicism stands in sharp contrast
 zino ke anusaar vivek hi sarvasv he
 Happiness has no place in its place, although even if happiness is found in a rational career, it is not necessary to forcefully reject it, as the "cynicists" used to do
 samvedjanya sukhon ko gaun or tuchh samajhnaa kaaphi he
 "life according to nature" means rational life, because conscious, actionable discretion is "natural" for humans
 sadachaar kaa aadhaar he aatmaniyantran, kartavyaparayanata or swaarthtyag
 The biggest obstacle in the path of moral development is incontinence
 "stike" vichaardhaara main sanyasavritti kaaphi prabal hote hue bhi zino or uske anuyaayiyon ne "sinic" panth ke vikrut vyaktvaad se bachane kaa bhi yathesht praytn kiya
 The Stoic ethos had a profound effect on medieval values
 seneka or samrat macrs orilliyas ne is darshan kaa samarthan kiya
 Plotinus - The medieval ethos is mainly religious or spiritualist
 roman samrajya ke patan se pehle hi isai dharmatatv ke sandarbh main greek darshan kaa punarmoolyankan kiya jane laga tha
 The first such significant effort can be seen in neo-colonialism
 sucraat--afalaatoon--arestu kii vichaarparampara main jo rahasywaadee pravritiyaan nihit thim unhen plotinus ke darshan main ubhaara gaya he
 The ultimate aim of human life is the unbroken knowledge of "one" or "divine"
 is uddeshy kii purti ke liye hamen apane aapako "yogya" bananaa he or iske liye sadachaar aavashyak he
 Thus the importance of ethos for Plotinus is limited and facetious
 nakeelatunavaad ke anya pramukh pratinidhi hai filo or poraphiri
 Agastin -sant Agastin's "patriotic" philosophy also considers the divine experience as the ultimate goal
 ishwarprem hi vaastavik naitikta kaa aadhaar ho saktaa he
 Agastin indirectly accepted the doctrine of hedonism to a certain extent, saying that "maximum will" is possible only in theocratic life
 thomas ekwines -madhyayugin achaardarshan kaa sabase viksit rup sant thomas ekwines kii darshanapranali main he
 Equinus sought to move Christianity from Aflatoonism to Aristotleism
 satya or shubh kaa anusandhan do bhaagon se sabhav he-vishwaas or vivek
 These two are independent, but there is no fundamental opposition to them
 viveshkti kii ucchtam safalataa he arestudarshan
 The most sublime accomplishment of "faith" is the "genuine spiritualism" of Jesus Christ
 lekin inase nimnatar str par jo "vivek" or "vishwaas" kii safaltaayen hai unase bhi naitik jivan main prerana mil sakati he
 God knowledge is the ultimate auspiciousness
 ekwines ke baad "scholastic" vichaardhaara dhire-dhire gatiheen or sankeern ban gai
 The independent existence of ethics almost ceased, and the discussion of moral questions remained confined to literal discourse in some of the dogmatic problems of Christian theology
 achaarshastra kaa aadhunik yug 15veen 16veen shatabdiyon ke dharmanirpeksh darshan se aarambh hota he
 One aspect of this philosophy is the scientist and naturalist whose healthy form is reflected in the bacon and distorted form of habz
 achaarshastra kii drushti se habz bekan se adhik mahatvapurn he
 Habz's approach is materialistic
 vastuon or gati kaa hi astitv vah maanata he or maanav aacharan ko "vastu" or "gati" ke hi daayre main dekhtaa he
 Since human relation to object is possible only through sensing, therefore sensing is the "main driver" of human life
 sukh kii ichha or du:kha ke prati vimukhataa hi maanviya vyavhaar kaa aadhaar he
 The duty of a person is only one - to earn happiness for oneself

 Kant emphasized that moral rules are universal and absolutely mandatory

 This rule mandates that we accept humanity as a means and not as a means, always in ourselves and others

 Taking inspiration from Darwin's "law of Natural Election", Herbert Spencer introduced a new developmental hedonism

 This law is as real to humans as it is to other beings, although social and cultural traditions have formed in human life

 Kant's humanism and Lilliam James's direct consequentialism are important in the vision of the history of ethics among other ideologies that have given rise to "utility"

 For the first time in ancient India, under the Maurya dynasty, we tried to establish political and cultural unity

 Although historians Satavahanas are the successors of the Mauryas in the Deccan, the rise of this dynasty should also be understood as a normal Jain and Hindu process against the Buddhist kingdom of Ashoka

 From the information we have received about this period, we get to know about the singularities of the Satavahanas and their unique activities in different fields
 yadi puraanon ke vaktavyon par vishvas kiya jaae to dakkan ke is samrajya kii simaaen uttar bharat tak faili hui thi

 It was a result of the long and peaceful rule given by the Satavahanas in Central India and Deccan that the art and architecture developed, examples of which we can find in the sculpted cavities in the rocks of western India and the stupas and viharas of eastern India

 Also, the situation has become even more suspicious in the various Puranas due to the absence of death in the context of the Satavahanas

 Although the historians mentioned above consider Andhra Pradesh as the original abode of the Satavahanas, there are differences among these scholars regarding the center of their power

 But scholars have differences regarding the relationship with Satavahanas

 In the literary texts, the term Shali Vahan is also used for them

 Smith, Andhra was subordinate at first, but after his death he became independent under the leadership of Simukh and this incident happened in the third century BCE
 is vishay main smith ne puraanon kaa hi aadhaar mana he jinke anusaar andhron ke kul tees shaskaon ne lagbhag 460varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dr
 Gopalachari also accepted this fact by acknowledging that the Satavahana dynasty was founded around 235 AD and its fall in about 255 AD

 But this fact is unbelievable because we know very well that the rulers of Sunga and Kanva dynasty never ruled jointly and Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of Kanva dynasty, took over the reins of the reign by killing the last Sunga ruler Devbhuti
 vayupurana ke us vaktavy jiske aadhaar par dobhandarkar ne galat vyakhya kii he, ko doray choudhary ne sahi bhang se paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, this dirty volume tells this much that when Simuk ended the Kanva dynasty and established the Satavahana dynasty, he also abolished the Sunga rulers who remained after the defeat of the Sunga rulers at the hands of the Kanva dynasty

 But notwithstanding all these factors one cannot deny the possibility that Simuk, who ruled for 23 years, would have been enthroned sometime back i
e
 in the middle of the first century BCE
 simuk satvaahan vansh kaa sansthaapak tha tathaa usne 235 i0pus0 se lekar 212i0pus0 tak lagbhag 23 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Although we do not get much information about it, it is known from the Puranas that by destroying the power of the Kanva rulers and suppressing the remaining Sunga chiefs, he laid the foundation of the Satavahana dynasty
 puraanon main use simec ke atirikt shishuk, sindhuk tathaa shiprak aadi naamon se bhi pukaara gaya he
 According to Jain observers, Simuk built Jain and Buddhist temples during his reign, but at the end of his reign, he was stunned and cruel due to which he was removed and murdered

 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty
 nanaghat shilaalekh ke anusaar shatakarni ne apane samrajya kaa khub vistaar kiya tathaa apane kaary kaal main do ashwamegh yajna tathaa ek rajasuy yajna kiya
 From an inscription of her queen Nayanika, we learn that Shatkarni i conquered western Malwa as well as Anup and Vidarbha regions
 yadi shatakarni pratham hi vah shaasha he jiskaa ullekh sanchi stupa ke torana main hua he to yah bhi is baat ko pramanit karata he ki uske samay main madhya bharat satvahanon ke adhikaar main tha

 Shatkarni I's wife Nayanika or Naganika was the daughter of a maestro, Tranakairo, of Angiyan clan
 shatakarni pratham kii mrityu ke pashchaat uske do alpavyask putr vedashri tathaa satshri singhaasana par baithe
 But being a minor, the administration took the reins of his mother Nayanika, who ruled with the help of her father
 aisa prathit hota he ki vedashri kii alpaayu main hi mrityu ho gai tathaa satshri ne uske uttaradhikari ke rup main shashan sambhala
 But the Puranas are unanimous that after Satakarni I, a king named Purnotsang sat on the throne Satavahana
 chaahe chaturth satvaahan shaasha kaa naam kuch bhi rahaa ho, yah to nishchit he ki is shaasha ke shashan kaal main hi pushyamitra shunga ne antim maury shaasha brahadrath ko maar kar magadh rajya par adhikaar kar liya tha
 In Matsyapuran, Skandastambhi is mentioned as the fifth ruler of the Satavahana dynasty but most scholars consider this name to be fictitious
 shatakarni dwitiya ne lagbhag 166 i0pus0 se lekar 111 i0pus0 tak shashan kiya
 It was probably the same ruler who is mentioned in the inscriptions Heathigumpha and Bhilsa
 yah prathit hota he ki iske shashan kaal main satvahanon ne purvi malwa ko pushyamitra shunga ke ek uttaradhikari se chin liya
 According to the Puranas, after Shatkarni II, Lambodar ascended the throne
 lambodar ke pashchaat uskaa putr apilak gaddi par baitha
 Appellant who was the eighth Satavahana ruler, the period between these two is considered to be the dark age in the context of Satavahanas in which only the period of Kuntal Shatakarni can be considered as an exception
 kuntal shatakarni, apilak ke pashchaat satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatvapurn shaasha tha
 In the Kamasutra, Vatsyayan mentions Kuntal Shatkarni, writing that he used his fingers as a scissor and that his patrani Malayavati died from the stroke
 kawyaminmasha main rajeshwar ne kuntal shatakarni kaa varnan karte hue kaha he ki usne apane ranivas main rahane vaali apni raniyon ko yah aadesh diya tha ki ve keval praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karen
 Hall was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya tathaapi kuch vishyon uskaa shashan kaal bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 It is believed that if Shatkarni was the greatest as the first warrior among the early Satavahana rulers, Hall was a pioneer as a peacekeeper

 His inscriptions of Nashik, Karle and Junar; All of the donations made by SK majority coins and his Jamta Shak Ashwadat in northern and southern India testify that the empire of the Kshatra dynasty was very vast at the time of Nahapan and that it had taken away a large territory from the Satavahana rulers
 Was made so huge
 nahpaan tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdath ne malwa, narmada ghati, uttari konkan, baraar kaa pashchima bhaag evam or dakshini maharashtra ko jitkar pashchimi dakkan main satvaahan shakti ko lrabhr ukhaad phanka
 The Satavahana kings who were defeated at the hands of Nahapan were probably the beautiful Shatakarni, Chakor Shatkarni and Sivasati, whose tenure was very short, but this situation did not last long and as the Satavahana ruler of Gautami son Sri Shatakarni became the new ruler in this quasi-satavahana struggle Turned
 lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 Gautamiputra Satkarni is also considered by some experts to be King Shalivahana
 unhone puure bharat ko ekajute kar diya or videshi hamalaavaron ke khilaaf bachaaya
 In this context, we get information from this article that he has made the ego of Kshatriyas honorable
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shasaskon ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands
 jogalthambi samuh se praapt nahpaan ke chandi ke sikken jinhe ki gautami putr shatakarni ne dubaara dhalvaaya tathaa apane shashan kaal ke atharahawein varsh main gautami putr dwaara nasik ke nikat pandu-len main guhaadaan karnaa- ye kuch aise tathy he jon yah pramanit karaten he ki usne shaq shaskaon dwaara chhine gaye pradeshon ko purnvijit kar liya
 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha
 The area under its direct influence extended from Malwa and Kathiawar in the north to the Krishna River in the south and from Berar in Puwa to Konkan in the west
 usne 'tri-samudra-toy-pit-vaahan' oopaadhi dhaaran kii jisase yah pataa chalata he ki uskaa prabhaav purvi, pashchimi tathaa dakshini sagar arthath bengal kii khadi, arab sagar evam hind mahaasaagar tak tha
 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya
