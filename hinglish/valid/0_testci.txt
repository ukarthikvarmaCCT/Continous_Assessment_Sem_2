 Now take the condition of a college in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh
 bulandshahr main do sarkari or 10 aded degree college hai, zyaadaatar collejon main teacheron kii kami he
 In 1956, Bulandshahr merchants donated a lot of land to build a DAV degree college
 us vakt shahar kaa yah akele piji college tha
 Today, more than 3000 students study here, but there are no teachers to teach
 40 pad manzur hai magar 20 shikshakon ke bharose kaam chal rahaa he
 Can 20 teachers teach 3000 students
 ye sabhi 20 professor 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par hi padhaa rahe hai
 That is, there is not a single permanent teacher in this college
 angrezi vibhaag ke adhyaksh to 23 saal se edock padhaa rahe hai
 His salary has increased from 2200 to 8000 in 23 years
 bees-bees saal se shikshak yahaan asthai taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Similarly, Faculty of Chemistry Department Suvidha Chaudhary has also been teaching here on Adhawk for many years
 aap soch sakate hai ki is college ke chaatro ke saath kya ho rahaa hoga
 We are creating a future or a national project to spoil the future is going on in India
 yakeen hi nahin hua jab meerut uniwarsity association ke adhyaksh professor vikaas sharma ne bataaya ki puure upi main degree collejon main saath fisadi pad khaali hai
 If there are so many vacancies which have been held so many elections, why did not all these issues ever arise
 kya kisi ko college main naukari nahin chahie thi, kya chaatro ko bagaiyr professor kii padhanaa tha
 Let's go to Rajasthan again
 yahaan ke jainarayan vyas uniwarsity kaa haal liya jise 1962 main kaayam kiya gaya tha
 It was inaugurated on 24 August 1962 by the President of India, Dr
 es
 Radhakrishnan did it
 pehle ise jodhpur uniwarsity bhi kehete the
 The list of its successful students is fantastic
 purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot, jodhpur ke saansad or kendriya krishi rajya mantri gajender singh shekhavat, purv rajya sabha saansad lem singhvi bhi isi vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rahe hai
 It was LM Singhvi who conceived the Lokpal in 1963, which has become a law but till date the Lokayukta has not been appointed
 inke putr abhishek manu singhvi bhi saansad rahe hai
 Many law students and judges have come out of this university
 purv justise aaram lodha bhi jainarayan universti se hi padhe hai
 There are 47 subjects departments in which 125 courses run
 2016-17 main yahaan kareeb do lakh chaatro ne daakhila liya tha
 The status of this university has come down from a to B
 zyaadaatar class guest faikalti ke bharose chal rahi he
 Fifty percent of the posts are vacant
 648 shikshakon ke pad manzur kiye gaye hai magar 324 shikshak hi niyamit hai
 a guest faculty gets 500 for a class, while someone also gets 300
 ab sarkaar ne ek nayaa tarika nikaala he
 Retired professors are being replaced by old guest faculty
 kahaan to naujavaanon ko naukari di jaani chahie thi magar ritair logon se kaam lekar naujavaanon ke haq ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 There is also a severe shortage in non-teachers
 vahaan 801 pad sweekrut hai magar 200 se adhik pad khaali hai
 The university was reinstated in 2013 but the scam was alleged
 anti karpshan beuro kii jaanch abhi tak chal rahi he
 They also have a room in the university
 is maamle main professor se lekar kai karmchaaree giraftaar ho chuke hai
 Siddinket Member and Vice Chancellor have also gone to jail
 vishvavidhyalay ke itihaas main is baar yahaan pehali mahila adhyaksh chuni gai hai
 Although the Kanta Jwala teacher of NSUI, VC has gone to jail but history continues to be made in the university
 tippaniyan Our colleague Arun Harsh has come to the house of Makhanlal, who taught as a guest lecturer for 13 years
 2001 se 2013 tak maakhanlaal ne arts or commers ke chaatro ko arthshaastra padhaayaa he
 One class used to get 150 rupees
 kabhi 7-8 hazaar se zyaada nahin kama sake
 Jayanarayan Vyas was doing his MA and phd from the same university and was teaching there, but after 13 years, the university switched to Tata
 is ummid main padhaate rahe ki shaareerik chunautiyon ke kaaran permanent ho jayega lekin jab 2008 main vaikency ai to unke liye post hi nahin nikali
 Now they cannot teach even on contract
 kyonki niyam badal gaya he
 Those who retire now will be able to teach on contract
 houseing board ke makaan main rahete hai jo apana he
 Have two children
 44 saal umr ho chuki he
 Someone told that there are several hundred vacancies of teachers in Allahabad University
 zoology department main to 18 post manzur hai magar yahaan bhi 7 guest padhaa rahe hai or paanch permanent
 The remaining 6 posts are empty
 jo guest padhaa rahaa he use maheene kaa 25000 se adhik nahin mila
 After this program, teachers have mailed from place to place, saying that my report could have been even more frightening, it is lacking in it, it is not a matter of funded colleges, how in private colleges five thousand to eight Thousand has been kept for teaching people, it has not come yet
 kya vaaki aap raajnneetik vishyon par kuch bhi nahin bol rahe the, kuch to charchaa karte hi honge, ye netaa wo netaa, to phir apane muddon ko kaise bhul gaye
 It was a matter of teachers, how much messing is happening with the students
 to apane-apane ilaake ke college kaa gauge lijie, unki baat kiijie, unhen lekar sawaal kiijie
 BR Ambedkar University's budget report for 2017-18 sent to the state government, the situation looks even more frightening
 kuch collejon kaa hisaab de de rahe hai taaki vahaan ke noujvaan sthaayee niyukti ke liye apane pratinidhiyon par dabaav daal saken
 The university's PG department should have 230 teachers, but only 101 are teaching
 aarasi college, sakara main 24 shikshakon kii jagah maatr 4 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Doctor SK Sinha Female College Motihari should have 29 teachers but only 7
 mjeke college, betia main 67 pad hai magar 17 shikshak hi tainaat hai Looking at the list of a university, it seems that the posts are not being filled deliberately
 yaa to bhartee nahin hoti yaa hoti he to kai saal tak prakriya hi chalati rahati he
 Surprisingly, all the big people of the area know this
 naujavaanon ko bhi yah baat maaloom he
 But nobody has seen that everyone has put pressure on the mlas and mps to make appointments in the college, studies should go well
 uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr ke ek college kaa haal ab lete hai
 Bulandshahr has two government and 10 aided degree colleges, most of the colleges are short of teachers
 1956 main diavi degree college banane ke liye bulandshahr ke vyapaariyon ne khub daan diya, zamin di
 At that time it was the only PG college in the city
 aaj yahaan 3000 se adhik chaatr to padhate hai magar padhaane vaale shikshak nahin hai
 40 posts are acceptable, but work is going on with 20 teachers
 kya 20 shikshak 3000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 All these 20 professors have been teaching only temporarily for 20-20 years
 yani is kalege main ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 The Chairman of the English Department has been teaching Adhoc for 23 years
 23 saal main inaki selary 2200 se badhkar 8000 ho gai he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for twenty years
 usee tarah chemistry vibhaag kii adhyaksh suvidha choudhary bhi kai saal se yaha edock par padhaa rahi hai
 You might wonder what would be happening to the students of this college
 ham bhavishya bana rahe hai yaa bhavishya bigaadane kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he bharat main
 Unbelievable when Professor Vikas Sharma, President of Meerut University Association, said that sixty percent posts in degree colleges are vacant all over UP
 agar itane pad khaali hai jo phir itane chunaav ho chuke, kabhi ye sab mudda kyon nahin bana
 Did nobody want a job in college, did the students have to study without a professor
 phir se rajasthan chalate he
 Here took the condition of Jayanarayan Vyas University which was established in 1962
 iskaa udghaatan 24 agast, 1962 ko bharat ke raashtrapati dow
 s
 radhakrishnan ne kiya tha
 Earlier it was also called Jodhpur University
 iske kaamyaab chaatro kii suchi shandaar he
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Jodhpur MP and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajender Singh Shekhawat, former Rajya Sabha MP LM Singhvi have also been students of this university
 lem singhvi ne hi 1963 main lokapal kii kalpana kii thi, jo kanoon to ban gaya he magar aaj tak lokayukta niyukt nahin hua he
 His son Abhishek Manu Singhvi has also been an MP
 is uniwarsity se kai kanoon vid or jaj nikle hai
 Former Justice RM Lodha has also studied from Jayanarayan University
 yahaan par 47 vishyon ke vibhaag hai jisamen 125 course chalate hai
 In 2016-17, around two lakh students were admitted here
 is uniwarsity kaa darja e se ghat kar bi par aa gaya he
 Most of the class is running on the guest faculty
 pachaas fisadi pad khaali hai
 The posts of 648 teachers have been approved but only 324 teachers are regular
 kisi guest faikalti ko ek class ke liye 500 miltaa he to kisi ko 300 bhi miltaa he
 Now the government has found a new way
 puraane guest faikalti ko hataa kar unki jagah ritair prophessoron ko rakhaa jane laga he
 Where the youth should have been given jobs, but the rights of the youth are being killed by taking work from the retired people
 gaiyr shikshak main bhi bhayankar kami he
 There are 801 posts sanctioned but more than 200 posts are vacant
 2013 main is uniwarsity main bahaali hui thi magar ghotaale kaa aarope lag gaya
 The investigation of the Anti Corruption Bureau is still going on
 uniwarsity main inkaa ek cameraa bhi ban gaya he
 Many employees, including professors, have been arrested in this case
 sidinket member or vaais chancelar bhi jail ja chuke hai
 This time in the history of the university, the first female president has been elected here
 enesayuai kii kanta jwaala teacher bhale na ho, visi jail ja chuke hai magar uniwarsity main itihaas kaa bananaa jari he
 The comments hamaare sahyogi arun harsh 13 saal tak guest lekturer ke rup main padhaane vaale maakhanlaal ke ghar aae hai
 From 2001 to 2013, Makhanlal has taught economics to arts and commerce students
 ek class ke 150 rupee milte the
 Never could earn more than 7-8 thousand
 jainarayan vyas uniwarsity se hi eme or piechdi karke vahiin padhaa rahe the magar 13 saal ke baad uniwarsity ne tata kar diya
 Teaching in the hope that due to physical challenges will be permanent, but when the vacancy came in 2008, the post did not come for him
 ab ve theke par bhi nahin padhaa sakate hai
 Because the rule has changed
 jo ab ritair hoga vahi theke par padhaa sakegaa
 The Housing Board lives in a house which is its own
 do bachche hai
 She is 44 years old
 kisi ne bataaya ki elahabaad uniwarsity main bhi kai sau pad shikshakon ke khaali hai
 There are 18 posts approved in the Zoology Department, but here also 7 guests are teaching and five are permanent
 baaki 6 pad khaali hai
 The guest who is teaching did not get more than 25000 of the month
 is kaarykram ke baad jagah-jagah se shikshakon ne mail kiya he, kaha ki meri report or bhi bhayaavah ho sakati thi, isamen ye kami he wo kami he, vitt poshit kalege kii baat nahin he, privet kalejon main kis tarah paanch hazaar se aath hazaar par logon ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa gaya he ye abhi tak nahin ai
 Are you sure you were not talking anything on political topics, some must have been discussing, these leaders, those leaders, then how did they forget their issues
 ye to shikshakon kii baat hui, chaatro ke saath kitna khilwaad ho rahaa he
 So review the colleges in your area, talk to them, question them
 ek uniwarsity kii suchi dekhakar lagata he ki jaanboojh kar padon ko nahin bharaa ja rahaa he
 Either there is no recruitment or if the process continues for many years
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ilaake ke sabhi bade logon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Young people also know this
 magar kisi ko nahin dekha ki sabane milakar vidhayak or saansadon par dabaav daalaa ho ki college main niyuktiyaan hon, padhai thik se chale
 Now take the condition of a college in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh

 Some scientists of Google's Health Technology have found a way to learn about the diseases and dangers associated with the heart
 iske tahat mashin larning kaa istemaal karte hue pataayaa lagaaya jayega ki kisi shaks ko koun si dil kii beemaari he
 Under this method, the patient's eyes will be scanned through software and data will be collected from it
 data main us shaks kii umr, blad prashar ke alaava ye pataa lagaaya jayega ki wo smoking karata he yaa nahin
 By collecting such data, through machine learning, the chances of heart attack are determined
 khaas baat ye he ki yah tarika utana hi sateek hoga jitna abhi duusare tareeke se pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 Developed by Google scientists, this algorithm will help doctors quickly and easily analyze the cardiovascular risk of patients
 iske liye blad test kii bhi jarurat nahin hogi
 However, this method is currently under testing and can be used after that
 google artificial intelligence blog main Google AI ke product manager lee peng ne likhaa he, ‘2 lakh 84 hajaar marijon se jutaaye gaye data par deep larning elgoridm yuj kiya gaya he or aisa karke ham retinal image se cardiovascular risk ko predict karne main kaamyaab rahe hai or yah sateek bhi he’ 13 years of ceasefire were completed to maintain mutual trust and peace on the border between India and Pakistan
 13 saalon main kitni dfa yudhviram kaa ulanghan hua he, isaki ginati kar paanaa bhi ab mushkil ho gaya he
 The ceasefire has been violated more than a thousand times and it seems that it is just a formality
 vaise sach kahen to ye yudhviram ek khokhla samjhauta hi sabit hua he
 It has given less happiness, more sorrow and more wounds

 pakistan kii kufia agency ISI kii ek nai chaal kaa khulaasa hua he
 In order to throw dust in the eyes of the world, Pakistan is trying hard to save its most important terrorist, Hafiz Saeed and his organization
 bhartiya kufia agency ke sutron ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki pakistan JUD par bain lagane kaa sirf naatak kar rahaa he
 Instead, the reality of Pakistan is that it has formed two new organizations to work for JUD and promote Kashmir terror
 jiske jariye wo fund kii ugaahi kar sakegaa
 According to information received by Aztak, Pakistan's intelligence agency isi's Shay Hafiz Saeedne has created 2 new organizations called Jammu Kashmir Movement (JKM) and Rescue, Relief and Education Foundation (RREF)
 inke jariye kashmir main aatank ko badhaava diya ja sake
 According to the intelligence report, the Jammu Kashmir Movement has been given separate responsibility for the work of JUD, while this new organization named Rescue, Relief and Education Foundation was given the responsibility of looking after the work related to falah-e-insaniyat Foundation (FIF)
 is
 pakistan kii is chaal par suraksha maamalon ke jaankaar pike sahagal ne kaha ki "hafiz said ke anekon organaijeshan he
 Every time he is under international pressure, he immediately changes the name of the same organization and starts working differently
 taaki uske kisi acount ko sij na kiya ja sake or wo duusare organaijeshan main paisa transfar kar sake
 Sehgal says that the bosses of these changed organizations remain the same
 jo pehle isame shaamil hai
 By the time the world comes to know about it, this terrorist kingpin has damaged India on a large scale
 ab vishwa ko ye samajhnaa hoga ki aatanki aise hi naam badalakar paak kii saraparasti main aatank ko badhaava de rahe hai
 This act of Hafiz Saeed has been decoded by the intelligence department
 sutara bataate hai ki pakistan kii khufia agencyiesine lashkar or jamaat ud daawa ke aatankiyon se in 2 nae group se judane ko kaha he
 So that terrorist activities against India can be continued in the changed name and Pakistan can save these terrorist groups from the eyes of the world
 paak media main is baat kii bhi report chhapi ki america ke dabaav main paak JUD ke khilaaf kadam uthaa rahaa he
 The Pakistan Defense Minister Khurram Dastagir Khan said that action against Jamaat ud Dawa (jud) and fallah-e-insaniyat Foundation (FIF) was not under US pressure but after serious discussion
 unhone kaha, 'hamane in par karrwai isliye kii taaki skulon main hamaare bachche surakshit rahen
 Pakistan banned Saeed-led JUD and FIF for taking donations
 'iske pehle america raashtrapati donald trump ne aarope lagaaya tha ki islamabad ne america ko jhooth or chal ke sivaa or kuch nahin diya
 Trump had said that Pakistan has provided safe haven to terrorists

 England captain Alastair Cook, who took the reins of the captaincy from Andrew Strauss ahead of the series against India, said his responsibility had improved in the game with extra responsibility
 unhone kaha, ‘is atirikt jimmedaari ne mujhe or javabdeh bana diya he
 This has improved my batting
 ek captain ke taur par aap hameshaa balle se acchhee shuruyaat chaahate hai

 ’pichley do test main do shatak jamaane vaale cook ne kaha, ‘pehle match ke baad lay bharat ne banaai thi lekin hamane mumbai main vaapasi kii
 i don't think the previous result has any effect
 ’unhone kaha, ‘shrinkhalaa 1-1 se barabari par he or do match hone baaki hai
 All the players want to play big matches and we have to play the next two weeks

 He is saying that Kashmir can get freedom in two to three weeks if media wants it
 isamen hafiz said kaa jija makki kashmir main phir se aatank failaane kii dhamkee detaa hua najar aa rahaa tha
 The threat given in this video may have been ignored as it was girder, but now let us understand this design of terror
 is video ke saamne aane se thik haftebhar pehle 13 june ko ghati main 6 silsilewar aatanki hamale hue the
 Although none of the 6 serial attacks were on the Amarnath Yatra route, but given the proximity of these attacks from the Yatra route, there was complete apprehension that the black eye of the terrorists was on the Amarnath Yatra
 13 june ko kashmir ghati ke pulavama jile main traal main hi do hamale hue, jabaki amarnath yatra pahalgam se shuru hoti he
 The distance from Tral to Pahalgam via NH-501 is 61 km
 aatankiyon ne anantnag main hoicourt ke jaj ke surakshakarmiyon par par bhi hamalaa kiya
 The distance from Anantnag to Pahalgam is just 43 km
 sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai kyonki ghati main barf pighalane ke saath aatankiyon kii ghuspaith main teji aa jaati he
 This time, the fast-paced Pakistani firing suspicion is getting stronger
 surakshabalon kii taiyaari ko maat de gaye aatankipakistani sena or iesai badi taadaad main bhaade ke aatankiyon ko bhartiya ilaake main ghuspaith karaane kii sajeesh main he
 Security forces had also made extensive preparations to deal with the conspiracies of Pakistan and its terrorists
 8 july ko burhan encounter kii barsi ko dekhte hue hamale kii ashanki thi, lekin sabakuch shantipurna tareeke se nipatane ke baad suraksha agenciyon ne raahat kii saans lee thi
 But the attack on Amarnath pilgrims suggests that the preparations for the terrorists were two steps ahead of the security forces

 ab desh ke border par tainaat jahaan or amritsar kii padhai karne vaali kudi suhaani ke bich huye is pyaar ko sahi anjaam mil paayegaa? iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Script: The story of the film is like a typical story in which no logic can be imposed
 army aria main anjaan ladki swimming karti hui pakadi jaati he or head saab use raat kii party main inwit karte hai
 Ittefaq continues to occur throughout the film
 kahani behad kamjor he or aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo apiling ho
 The script could have been even better
 saath hi aisa lagata he ki gaanon ko feet karne ke liye khaas taur se sikvence taiyaar kiye gayi hai jisaki vajah se film kii raftaar prabhavit hoti he

 Even after the presence of both actors, there is a lot of emptiness
 kamjor kadi:film kii kamjor kadi isaki script, lambaai or hile dule sikvence hai jinase conect kar paanaa bahut mushkil hota he
 Music: The music of the film is very good

 is baar gujarat chunaavon ko lekar congress ne khaas ranneeti banaai

 sutron kii maane to congress ko sabase bada dar is baat kaa tha ki gujarat main BJP hindu-muslim kaa aakhri daanv chal sakati he
 The Congress feels that since the 2002 riots, BJP has been winning elections only due to the sharing of hindu-muslim votes
 iske liye tatkaaleen CM modi aakhri maukey par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke rajnatik salaahkaar or rajyasabha saansad ahamed patel ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar tak bataa dete the
 Congress may refuse lakhs, but Ahmed's stature and stature in the party has been such that he has been considered as the biggest leader of Gujarat
 tabhi khud modi ke bhaashanon main miyaan ahamed patel jaise jumale kaa zikr hota tha
 That is why this time bjp's bets could not work
 iske liye congress ne khaas 5 sutreey agenda taiyaar kiya he
 This is the 5 point agenda of the Congress
 rahul gandhi sirf mandiron main jaakar party kii soft hindutv kii chhavi banaaenge

 ve log jo puraane migraine ke sirdard se peedit hai, un logon main jabade kii gambhir beemaari hone kii sambhaavna teen guna tak bad jaati he
 a research revealed this
 shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki shodh ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki temporomandibuller disorder (tiemdi) sidhe taur par migraine paidaa na kar jabade ke jodon ko prabhavit karata he
 However TMD can increase both the intensity and frequency of a migraine attack
 brazil kii saao poulo uniwarsity menshodhakarta or pramukh shodhalekhak ledian florenciyo ne kaha ki migraine bahusankhyak kaarnon ke saath ek snaivik rog he, jabaki tiemdi, gardan kaa dard or mastishk koshika sambandhi anya vikaar aise karkon kii ek shrinkhalaa he, jo migraine se grast marijon kii samvedansheeltaa or rog kii aavriti ko badhaata he
 Previous studies show how migraine is associated with chewing muscle pain
 temporomandibuller jod jabade ko khopadi kii haddi se jodate hue kabje ke samaan kaary karata he, isliye chabane or jodon ke tanaav main kathinaayee vikaar ke lakshan main shaamil hai
 Florencio stated that central sensitization may explain the association between the frequency of migraine attacks and the severity of TMD
 unhone kaha ki migraine ke hamalon kii punrariti dard kii samvedansheeltaa ko badha sakati he
 The research report is published in the 'journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics'
 adhyayan ke liye team ne 30 saal ke aasapaas umr kii mahilaon par gaur kiya, jinka kisi tarah kaa koi purana migraine yaa episodic migraine yaa migraine kaa itihaas nahin tha
 Among those who did not have a migraine complaint, 54 percent were found to have symptoms of TMD, while 80 percent with relevant migraine and 100 percent in women with chronic migraine
 shodhakartaone kaha he ki migraine se peedit logon main tiemdi hone kii prabal sambhaavna rahati he, jabaki tiemdi grast logon main jaruri nahin ki unhen migraine ho
 a Bangkok court had won Dawood Ibrahim's henchman Munna Jhingra by Pakistani investigative agencies on 8 August 2018
 Went against, first the case was won by Indian investigative agencies and then it was proved that Munna Jhingra is an Indian citizen But then Pakistan intelligence agency ISI has file an appeal with the Court of Bangkok David's gesture and this time the court gave him a Pakistani national agreement
 sutara bataate hai ki iske liye daaud ne pani kii tarah paisa bahaya
 On August 8, 2018, Indian investigative agencies had falsified all false claims of Pakistani intelligence agency in court and won the case
 iske baad ek apil kaa mauka hota he jisamen daaud ibrahim ne jamkar paisa lagaaya or 11 sitambar 2019 ko adaalat ne munna ko pakistani naagarik maan liya
 Indian investigative agencies were shocked, for the last two years, there was a tussle between Indian investigative agencies and Pakistan investigation agencies in the court of Bangkok regarding Dawood Ibrahim's special henchman Syed Mudusar Hussain alias Munna Jhingra, in which Dawood Ibrahim, this time, dragged money heavily and the case of Pakistan Went to the side
 jabaki bhartiya jaanch agency chaahati thi ki munna jhingada ko bharat deport kar diya jaae
 Syed Mudassar Hussain alias Munna Jhingra attacked Chhota Rajan in Bangkok in 2000 at the behest of Dawood Ibrahim in which Chhota Rajan was shot, but he managed to save his life by jumping from the roof while his partner Rohit Verma was killed
 hamale ke baad munna jhingada ko bangkok main giraftaar kar liya gaya or uske paas se pakistani passport baraamad hua tha
 Since then, Munna Jhingra is in Bangkok jail
 2 saal pehle bangkok kii adaalat main bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne munna jhigada ko bharat deport karne ke liye apil file kii or tamaam saboot die jiske baad daaud and company ne iesai ke jariye nami vakil bangkok main khadey kar die
 India won the case on 8 August 2018, but every prisoner in Bangkok has the right to file an appeal against the verdict and which he used
 phir 19 sitambar 2019 ko faisla bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ke khilaaf gaya
 Munna is a citizen of India, open Polpakistan of ISI tells Munna as Salim and also filed a false certificate of her marriage in court
 itnaa hi nahin pakistan ne munna ke jinda baap ko mara hua sabit kar diya tha
 Pakistan made many fake documents for all this and filed it in court
 pehali apil main jo pakistan munna ke pita ko mara hua bataa rahaa tha bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne usee munna ke pita ko bangkok kii adaalat main jinda khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, the DNA samples were given by the Indian investigative agencies to the court when the case was in India's favor
 lekin ab bhale hi bhartiya jaanch agency cese haar gai ho, lekin isse ek baar phir sabit ho gaya ki daaud pakistan main hi he
 Indian investigative agencies jolted Dawood Ibrahim and ISI in court and won the case, filing an appeal against the court
 to kya pakistan main he daaud?sutron ke mutabik apni pole khulne ke dar se is baar daaud ne pani kii tarah paisa bahaya or farji dastavej ke jariye cese jeeta, daaud or ISI ko dar he ki kahin munna bharat deport hua to bharat duniya ke saamne uski aatanki harkaton kii pole khol degaa
 The insistence of Dawood's shooter who attacked Chhota Rajan by proving him Pakistani as Pakistani, proves once again that Dawood is hiding in Pakistan and that too under the patronage of ISI

 i think that a balance between development and the environment is possible
 hamen sashastitv ko bhi swikaarna hoga or sahyatra ke mahatv ko bhi samajhnaa hoga
 The Prime Minister said that in our policies, in our economics, we have to change the conversation about conservation
 british raaj ke dauraan lagi pabandi ko milakar teen baar pratibandhit kiya ja chukaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) hi ab sarkaar he, or iskaa shrey jaataa he uske 'kaaryakarta' pradhanmantri narendra modi ko
 Yesterday, on 15 August, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat publicly praised the Prime Minister for abolishing the special status of Kashmir by removing Article 370 in rare ways
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke chunavi naare kaa istemaal karte hue RSS ke sarasanghachaalak ne kaha, "anuchhed 370 isliye gaya, kyonki modi he, to mumkin he
 
 
 "one of the three basic wishes of the Sangh Parivar of RSS and its associated organizations was the elimination of privileges being given to Kashmir under Article 370
 iske alaava, sangh parivaar kii shesh do icchhaaen hai - vibhinn dharmon ke logon ko shaadi-byaah tathaa zamin ke malikana haq jaise muddon par apane-apane kanoonon kaa paalan karne se rokane ke liye kaaman civil code (samaan naagarik samhita) ko lagu karnaa tathaa ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan karnaa
 i spoke to several BJP and Sangh leaders for this article
 unhone do ahm baaten kahin
 (prime Minister Narendra) Modi and his top aide and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have assured (RSS chief Mohan) Bhagwat and his Naib Bhaiyyaji Joshi that the other two wishes on the agenda after Article 370 are also Modi's current tenure as Prime Minister
 Will be completed in is vakt puri tarah modi ke saath milakar kaam kar rahi RSS ne bhi apane swayamsevakon ke vyapak network ke zariye bharpoor chunavi samarthan dene or sangh ke mahaan netaaon main modi ko sthaan die jane kii peshkash kii he (swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par apane bhaashan main modi dwaara sangh ke pramukh vichaarak shyama prasad mukherjee, jinka dehanth 1953 main kashmir main hua tha, kaa zikr kiya janaa maatr sanyog nahin tha
 
 
 ) The relationship between RSS and Modi has not always been so good, because during Modi's first term, Amit Shah was handling most of the matters related to Modi as party president
 unhone har saptaah main do baar bhagwat ko kol karne kii aadat daal lee thi, or sangh ke sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat ke liye vah hameshaa uplabdh hote the
 Amit Shah used to visit Nagpur every month to ensure that he and Bhagwat were aware of every move, and that no move of the government proved to be a surprise to the Sangh
 arthvyavastha ab gahare sankat kii ore badhati nazar aa rahi he, so, BJP kii soch yah he ki saanskrithik or vaicharik agenda par kaam karte rahane se uskaa buniyadi matadaata santusht rahegaa, or yah bhi sunishchit ho sakegaa ki akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan sirf berojgaare or mandi ke bare main nahin rahen
 a small group of extremely powerful people are working cautiously on the steps to come
 BJP ke ek varisht netaa, jo aane vaali yojanaon se parichit hai, kaa kahana he, "anuchhed 370 hamaare ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa tha, lekin kisi ko yakeen nahin tha ki ham vaada puraa karenge, lekin hamane kar diya
 
 
 Modi and Shah are not part of the Sangh, they are the Sangh, and leaders who work on the voice of the mind
 
 
 ve jaanate hai ki anuchhed 370 ko hataaya janaa hamen rajnatik rup se laabh degaa
 
 
 India no longer hesitates to accept the fact that we are a 'hindu dominated country'
 
 
 mood badal chukaa he
 
 
 Modi is running the government under the ideology and the time has come for the RSS to come across the country and ensure that our own values are reflected across the country
 
 
 "is vakt RSS hi desh ko chalaa rahaa he, so, saamne aane kii baat par bahes kii ja sakati he
 Everything from the Ghar (rashtrapati Bhavan) at the top of Raisina Hill to the top government offices and ministries located in the North and South blocks is being run by former Union campaigners
 RSS ko samooche desh main apni vichaardhaara ko failaane ke liye abhootpurv funding hasil ho rahi he
 Apart from this, luminaries like former President Dr
 Pranab Mukherjee have started coming to its headquarters in Nagpur
 yahaan tak ki modi dwaara swatantraaa diwas par die gaye bhaashan main jansankhya niyantran kaa zikr bhi soch-samajhakar likhi gai script kaa hissaa he
 The Modi government is already working on a scheme under which small families are benefited
 to ab kya ummid kerani chahie
 
 
 The Steps will be taken to move the economy forward, steps which have been termed as 'tax terrorism' will not be taken back, industrialists will be advised to contribute to the economy by paying taxes
 or kaaman civil code or ram mandir par bade kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Now the Supreme Court is hearing every day in the Ram temple case, so the government is hopeful that a positive decision will come before the important elections in Uttar Pradesh next year
 sansad ke donon sadanon main uniform civil code ko paarit karana saral he, sambhawatah usee tareeke se, jaise anuchhed 370 par kiya gaya
 a senior RSS ideologue says that with Kashmir (the verdict), Modi has recorded his name in history forever
 unhone kaha, "acha yaa bura, itihaas faisla karegaa, lekin sangh ke liye vah atal or adwani sahit kisi bhi anya BJP netaa se kahin aage nikal gaye hai
 
 
 "so, at the moment, let him do what he is doing

 chunaav ladane vaale ummidavaaron ke liye shaikshanik yogyata chhipaana yaa galat jaankaree dena ab khatre kii ghanti ban saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has said that the voter has the fundamental right to know the educational qualification of the candidate
 aise main chunavi halafname main juthi jaankaree dene par nirvachan bhi radd ho saktaa he
 According to the court, it is also clear in the provisions of the Representation of People Act and in Form 26 that it is the duty of the candidate to give correct information about his educational qualification
 adaalat ne yah bhi vyavastha di ki yadi chunaav main do pratyaashee hai or yah siddh ho gaya kivijayi ummidavaarka namakan patr galat tareeke se sweekaar kiya gaya he to chunaav haarane vaale pratyaashee ke liye aisa sakshya pesh karne kii jarurat nahin he ki chunaav vastav main prabhavit hua he

 hai court ne 2012 main moyrang vidhansabha kshetra se congress pratyaashee sharathchandra singh ke khilaaf rashtravaadi congress party ke tikat par chunaav ladane vaale prithviraj kanirvachan nirastaghoshit kar diya tha

 raashtrapati chunaav sampann hote hi uparashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke naam par bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main muhar lag gai he
 The name of Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has been decided by the party
 vahiin vipaksh kii ore se gopalkrishna gandhi ko ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 Naidu is also trusted by PM Modi and party president Amit Shah
 padhie aakhir kyon venkaiya naidu is pad ke liye bijepi ke liye parfect hai
 1
 south kaa cheharaavenkaiya naidu andhrapradesh se hai
 NDA has already announced Ramnath Kovind for the post of President from North India
 ummid he ki vah raashtrapati ban bhi jaaenge
 This is an opportunity for the BJP, which is planning to try to strengthen its roots in the whole country
 agar bijepi dakshin kaa daanv chalati he to 2019 ke liye bhi ek rasta taiyaar hoga
 2
 rajyasabha kaa anubhavvenkaiya naidu chaar baar rajyasabha ke saansad rah chuke hai
 He is an MP from Rajasthan
 bijepi ke paas rajyasabha main number kii bhi kami he, agar rajyasabha kaa koi anbhavi netaa is pad par chunaa jaataa he to sadan chalaane ke liye aasaani hogi
 Naidu was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1998 and since then he became a Rajya Sabha MP in 2004, 2010 and 2016
 iske alaava bhi venkaiya naidu kai cametiyon kaa hissaa rah chuke hai
 3
 party kaa bharosemand cheharaasang or bijepi ke bich hui baithak ke baad khabaren the ki bijepi chaahati he ki koi aisa cheharaa aage aae jo sangh or bijepi kii vichaardhaara ko samajhataa ho
 Naidu also went to jail in Emergency during 1975
 1977 se 1980 ke bich janata party ke samay main ve youth wing ke president bhi rahe
 He was also elected MLA in 1978
 iske alaava naidu party ke kai ahm padon par bhi rah chuke hai, 1980 se 1983 ke bich neshnal bijepi youth wing ke upaadhyaksh, andhra pradesh 1980 se 85 vidhansabha main bijepi ke netaa pratipaksh, 1988 se 1993 ke bich vah andhra pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh bhi bane
 From 1993 to 2000, Naidu became the bjp's national general secretary, in 2002 he became the bjp's national president for the first time
 ve disambar 2002 tak adhyaksh rahe
 After this, he became the president again in 2004
 april 2005 ke baad ve bijepi ke senior upaadhyaksh banaae gaye, 2006 ke baad venkaiya ko bijepi parliamentry board kaa sadsy or kendriya chunaav samiti kaa sadsy banaaya gaya
 4
 sarkaar kaa bada cheharaparty ke saath-saath venkaiya naidu sarkaar main bhi bada cheharaa hai
 Venkaiah is the senior-most minister after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 venkaiya atal sarkaar ke dauraan gramin vikaas mantri the, vahiin modi sarkaar ke dauraan unhone shahari vikaas mantralay kii bagdor sanbhali
 Apart from this, Naidu also took the charge of Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Information and Broadcasting
 5
 Advantage in Rajya Sabha, loss in cabinet If BJP puts forward the face of Naidu, he will be effective in handling the situation even though there is less number in Rajya Sabha
 haalanki modi ke liye unke cabinet main ek jhatka hoga, kyonki teen saal ke kaarykaal main kai maukon par naidu piem modi ke liye vipaksh ko munhtod jawaab dete najar aae hai

 Bhojpuri superstar Dinesh Lal Yadav 'nirhua', who is contesting against the Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav on a BJP ticket from Azamgarh parliamentary seat, says that if Mulayam Singh Yadav or Akhilesh Yadav were in the race for the post of Prime Minister, he would support them But the SP chief is contesting elections only to remove "honest" Narendra Modi
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki akhilesh or sapa ne yadavon kii pahchaan 'deshvirohi' ke rup main bana rakhi he or yah baat unke ''andhabhakton'' ko samaj nahin aa rahi he
 "nirhua" said in an interview to "pti-bhasha" here, "akhilesh is called the leader of the Yadavas and as soon as he says 'yadav' people feel that he is a man of the SP
 agar aap yadavon kii pahchaan ban gaye hai to aap us pahchaan ko itnaa neeche kyon gira rahe hai? aap gathbandhan karke ek eemaandaar aadmi (modi) ko rokane ja rahe hai
 Why this? "the Bhojpuri superstar said," If Mulayam Singh Yadav were in the race for the post of Prime Minister, i would have supported him
 agar akhilesh ji pradhanmantri banane vaale hote to main unka samarthan karata

 "he said," If you (akhilesh) were involved in the race to become Prime Minister, then you would understand that you want to fight Modi ji
 aapako pradhanmantri bananaa nahin he phir bhi aap yadavon kii shaan ko gira rahe hai
 Do you want to tell that the Yadavs here live in opposition to the country? "nirhua said in response to a question," Akhilesh's blind devotees are saying that i should not be taken seriously
 in andhabhakton ko samaj main aana chahie ki akhilesh ne yadavon kii pahchaan desh virdohi kii tarah bana rakhi he
 On the issue of nationalism, he said, "this is and should be the biggest issue
" lekin sapa rashtrawaad ke khilaaf he
 She does appeasement politics
 '' unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki azamgarh main akhilesh yadav ke saare sameekaran ulat gaye hai
 'nirhua' said, "there is atmosphere in Azamgarh
 pradhanmantri modi ke kaaryon evam yojanaon kaa laabh har ghar tak pahunchaa he
 People have already made up their minds
 '' kya haar kii sthiti main ‘nirahua' sakriy raajnneeti yaa bhaajapa se duuri banaaenge ? is par unhone kaha, ''main raajnneeti main rahoonga or bhaajapa main hi rahoonga
 In Azamgarh, i will add one person each to the BJP

 ) ab tak pataa nahin ki is baar chunaav kaa mukhya mudda kya banegaa
 We have experience of 16 Lok Sabha elections before this
 aisa kabhi nahin hua ki chunaav kaa elaan hone ke baad bhi pataa na chal paa rahaa ho ki chunaav kin mukhya muddon par hoga,varanaa chunaav ke chah maheene pehle hi iskaa pataa chal jaataa tha
 But this time someone speculates, then in two-four weeks the election issue shifts
 chah maheene pehle lagata tha ki is baar kisaanon kii badahaali or berojgaare sabase bada mudda hoga,lekin ye donon hi baaten sattapaksh ke liye makul nahin thim,isliye uski bajaay desh main sthaayee bhav vaale bhaavnaatmak mudde banane kii harchand koshish hui
 But due to getting older, he could not even get emotional issues
 haal hi main aatankwaad or hindu-musalmaan banane kii koshish hui
 But the events were such that the immediate injury to terrorism could not be achieved to create an electoral issue
 haal hi main masood azhar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karwaane main kootnithik naakaami ne aatankwaad ke chunavi mudda banane ke asaar khatm kar die
 Even before that, there was an attempt to pursue development
 lekin bhayaavah berojgaare kii khabaron ke bich vikaas kii baat chalaanaa bhi jokhim bharaa kaam tha
 However, it is also a reality that the issue of unemployment was not so much suppressed
 isliye bhi nahin dab paaya,kyonki yah raajnneetik dalon kaa nahin,balki janata kaa mudda he
 On the other hand, the farmer movements and opposition also did not let the farmers' plight die
 lekin kisi mudde ko marane na dena or use mukhya mudda bana dene main dharti-aasmaan kaa fark he
 However, despite less than a month remaining in the election, we are not knowing what will be the main issue during the election campaign this time
 ab to atkal lagane kaa bhi vakt nahin bachaa
 Yet the reality is that no election can be pointless
 duniya ke kisi bhi loktantric desh main kabhi bhi aisa nahin hua
 Even if elections are held on issues of interest, or issues are raised, which are considered to be universal and universal on psychological grounds
 masalan dharm or nasl kii asmita ek shaashvat mudda hota hi he
 Nowadays on this basis, the ego of the nation and the country is also becoming an election issue in the whole world
 yudhon ke lambey itihaas main meraa dharm,meraa gaanv,meraa desh ek shaashvat bhav banaaya ja chukaa he
 But its political use across the world has been used so much in the last several decades that this issue could not have much effect
 yuddh or aatankwaad usee prajati kaa ek mudda he
 Is also sensational
 lekin raajnneetik taur par aatankwaad kaa koi niraapad samaadhaan ab tak dhundha nahin ja sakaa
 So the eligibility to become an electoral issue is not visible in it
 ho saktaa he,isiilie roti kapadaa or makaan jaisaa kaaljayi mudda aajkal bade se bade viksit deshon main bhi bedakhal ho nahin paata
 New form of 'roti, cloth and house'
 
 
 halaat dekhen to hamen garibi se aaj bhi puri taur par chhutkaaraa mil nahin paaya
 Even if the situation has improved in seventy years, but food security for all and houses for everyone is still far away
 vaise bhi hamaare liye sabase badi samasya garib or amir ke bich badhati khai ban gai he
 Seeing a completely new trend, inclusive development is the biggest challenge in our largest democratic country of the world
 khaastaur par tab,jab ham aaj bhi krishipradhan desh bane hue hon or desh kii aadhi se zyada aabaadi,yani kisaan aitihaasik rup se sabase bure daur se guzar rahaa ho
 In such a situation one can speculate that no one can evict the farmer as an issue in this election
 berojgaare kii andekhi nahin ho sakati
 
 
 The youth is considered to be the largest shareholder in electoral politics
 khaastaur par chunaav main uski urja or samay sabase badi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 We are currently the most populous country in the world
 hamaare yahaan kii aabaadi main is samay65fisadi yuva hai
 All the voters are also there
 achaanak badi berojgaare ke kaaran is varg kaa bahut bada hissaa dehshat kii had tak pareshaan he
 How is it possible that unemployment should not become an issue in this election
 bhale hi sattadhari ke liye chunaav ke dauraan yah mudda ghaatak ho
 How it will be prevented from becoming an electoral issue is not known yet
 bachaa sapane dikhaane kaa maamla
 
 
 Of course dreams have tremendous potential to become issues
 khaastaur par chunavi naaron main
 But in recent times, its use was so drawn that it lost its life
 kam se kam is baar ke chunaav main to sapane nahin chal sakate
 However, it is the easiest thing to print dreams in election manifestos of political parties
 phir bhi pehle or aaj main ek fark aayaa he
 That there is increased awareness in today's world
 puri duniya main badi teji se sakshartaa bad gai he,isiilie haal hi main kuch viksit deshon main sapana dikhaau praudyogiki buree tarah fail hoti dikhni shuru ho gai he
 The new citizen of the world is beginning to understand that he is being shown false dreams or someone is making a practical promise with loyalty
 isi aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki is baar ke chunavi ghoshnapatron main nayaapan hoga
 Every sensible political party will avoid showing big dreams
 lihaaza is baar ke chunaav main bahut sambhav he ki raajnneetik dal thos se thos yojanaon or vaadon ko bhi dabi jubaan main votaron ke saamne rakhen
 The ruling party will have to take this caution very much
 is tarah se anumaan yah lagata he ki is baar ke chunaav main kisaanon or desh ke yuvavarg ke dukh yaa sankat ko kam karne ke liye vyaavhaarik yojana pesh karne kii hode machegi
 In particular, there will be a competition among the leaders of the opposition who are trying to evict the current government, who is able to present their plans in the most reliable way
 lakshya prabandhan praudyogiki kaa istemaal karnaa padegaa
 
 
 In the business industry, target management technology is being used in a very effective manner, while the need for target management technology is more in the political field
 ab jab hamaare paas yah praudyogiki aa hi gai he to is chunaav main uskaa istemaal karne main harj kya he
 For example, to achieve the goal of solving the problems of farmers and unemployed, these five points of management technology can be put in the election declarations
 pehla nukta ki yojanaon or kaaryakramon kaa dher na lagaaya jaae
 That is, one or two schemes should be emphasized
 doosraa ki vah lakshya naaptul ke laayak ho
 That is, it can be told later that what was said was completed
 teesri baat ki vah lakshya hasil hone laayak ho
 That is to say, it will require so much money to complete that work and these money will be levied from these people of the country through tax
 chauthi baat vishwasaneeyata kii
 That is, the same work must have happened in the country or elsewhere in the world
 nae-nae prayogon par janata kaa yakeen khatm ho chalaa he
 The fifth point of goal management is timeliness
 is baar ke ghoshnapatron main vaayadon ko puraa karne kaa yah hisaab bhi kholkar dikhaanaa padegaa ki agle paanch saal kii samyavadhi main vaayada in in charnon main puraa hoga
