 tunga nadi karnataka rajya,dakshin bharat kii ek nadi he
 This river originates on the Western Ghats of Pahari Varaha mountain located at a place named Gangamula
 yahan se ye nadi do jilon se hokar guzarati he or in do jilon kaa naam karnataka-chikmagalore jila or shimoga jila hai
 It is 147 KM long and joins the Bhadra River at Koodali
 is jagah ke baad is nadi ko sanyukt naam tungabhadra diya jaataa he
 Tungabhadra flows eastwards and merges into the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh
 yah nadi apane pani kii mithaas ke liye jaani jaati he or iske pani ko puure vishwa main sabase meetha pani mana jaataa he
 There is a belief that "thunga Pana Ganga Snan" means that we should first drink the water of the Tunga River and then take a bath in the Ganges River

 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus

 udayan vaasavadatta ke prem main itane khoye rahane lage ki unhen raaj-kaary kii sudhi hi nahin rahi
 Taking advantage of this situation, his cruel enemy named Aruni snatched his kingdom from him
 aaruni se udayan ke rajya ko waapas lene ke liye unke mantri yaugandharayan or rumnavan prayatnsheel ho gayi
 But Aruni could not be defeated without the help of another state
 vaasavadatta ke pita pradyot udayan se naaraaz the or yaugandharayan ko unase kisi prakaar kii ummid nahin thi
 Yoongandharayana finds out through astrologers that the king whom magadha-naresh's sister Padmavati will marry will become Chakravarti emperor

 Yoongandharayan told Vasavadatta about his plan to get Maharaj Udayan married with Padmavati
 pati kii mangalakamna chaahane vaali vaasavadatta is vivaah ke liye raji ho gayi
 But Yoongandharayana knew well that Udayan loved his wife Vasavadatta infinitely and would never agree to his second marriage
 atev unhone vaasavadatta or ek anya mantri rumnavan ke saath milakar ek yojana banaai
 According to the plan, Udayan was sent along with the royal family and confidant colleagues to the forest for hunting, where they all started living in the camp
 ek din, jab udayan mrugaya ke liye gaye hue the, shivi main aag laga di gai
 On Udayan's return, Rumwan told him that Vasavadatta was trapped in the fire in the camp and that Yoondandharayana entered the place where both of them died
 udayan is samachar se atyant duhkhi hue kintu rumnvan tathaa anya amaatyon ne anekon prakaar se santvanaa dekar unhen sambhaala
 Here, Yogandharayan, taking Vasavadatta as a Parivrajak, reached Magadha Rajputri Padmavati and placed the disguised Vasavadatta as a heritage near Padmavati
 avantika padmavati kii vishesh anugrah paatr ban gayi
 He praised Maharaj Udyan and attracted Padmavati towards him
 udayan doosraa vivaah nahin karnaa chaahate the kintu rumnavan ne unhen samajha-buja kar padmavati se vivaah ke liye raji kar liya
 Thus Udayan was married to Padmavati
 vivaah ke pashchaat magadh-naresh kii sahaayta se udayan ne aaruni par akraman kar diya or use parrast kar apana rajya waapas le liya
 In the end, in a very dramatic way Yugandharayana and Vasavadatta revealed themselves
 yaugandharayan ne apni dhristataa evam dussahas ke liye kshamaa nivedan kiya
 In one scene of this play, Udayan rests in the sea
 ve swapn main ‘ha vaasavadatta’, ‘ha vaasavadatta’ pukaarte rahete hai usee samay avantika vahaan pahunch jaati hai
 They leave their hanging hands on the bed, but at the same time Udayan sleep opens
 ve nishchay nahin kar pate ki unhone vastav main vaasavadatta ko dekha he athwa swapn main
 Due to this incident, the play was named 'swapnavasavadatta'

 kashyap yaa kaashyap ke naam se teen samhitaayein milti hai : The word Kashyap is also gotravachi; The original sage's name appears to be Kashyapa
 matsay puraana main marich ke putr kashyap ko mul gotrapravartak kaha gaya he; parantu aage chalakar kashyap marich bhi kaha he
 In Charak Samhita, Kashyap has written separately 'marichikashpau'
 isamen marich kashyap kaa visheshan he
 Similarly, in a text of Charaka, 'kashyapo Bhringu:' this text has come up
 isamen kaashyayap gotrotpann bhrigu kaa ullekh he
 In this way, where the word Kashyap is gotravachi, there is also a person name

 It appears that the elder Kashyapa and the Samhitaakar Kashyapa are different people

 The song is a short booklet written in Sanskrit language by Govind's author Jayadeva around 1200 AD summarizing the essence of Kamasutra
 bharat main britani shashan ke samay, bhartiya utpaada kaa vah hissaa jo janata ke upbhog ke liye uplabdh nahin tha tathaa raajnneetik kaarnon se jiskaa pravaah england kii ore ho rahaa tha, jiske badale main bharat ko kuch nahin praapt hota tha, use aarthik nikaas yaa dhan-nishkasana kii sangya di gayi
 The concept of withdrawal of funds developed in the order of commercialist thinking
 dhan-nishkasana ke siddhanth par us samay ke anek aarthik itihaaskaaron ne apane mat vyakt kiye
 Among them, Dada Bhai Naoroji in his book "poverty and Unbritish Rule in India" first introduced the concept of economic exit
 unhone dhan-nishkasana ko sabhi buraaiyon kii buraai kaha he
 In 1905 he said, the exit of money is the root of all evil and the root cause of Indian poverty
 ramesh chandra dutt, mahadev govind ranade tathaa gopal krishna gokhale jaise rashtravaadi vichaarkon ne bhi dhan ke nishkasana ke is prakriya ke upar prakaash daalaa he
 According to them, instead of spending on irrigation schemes, the government spends on an item which is directly linked to the interests of the imperialist government
 aarthik nikaas ke pramukh tatv the- angrej prashasnic evam sainik adhikariyon ke vetan evam bhatte, bharat dwaara videshon se liye gayi rinon ke byaaj, naagarik evam sainya vibhaag ke liye britain ke bhandaron se kharidi gayi vasteen, nauvahan companiyon ko kii gayi adaayagi tathaa videshi bainkon tathaa beemaa labhaansh
 Due to the release of Indian money to England, capital could not be created and collected in India, whereas the means and pace of industrial development in England greatly increased
 british arthvyavastha ko is dhan se jo labhaansh praapt hota tha, use punah puunji ke rup main bharat main laga diya jaataa tha or is prakaar bharat kaa shoshan nirantar badhata jaataa tha
 Withdrawal of this money had a very adverse effect on employment and income prospects in India
 dhan kaa yah apaar nishkasana bharat ko andar-hi-andar kamjor banaate ja rahaa tha
 Withdrawal of money under the commercialist system is called the situation when precious metals like gold, silver go out of a country due to adverse trade balance
 mana yah jaataa he ki plasi ke yuddh se 50 varsh pehle tak british east india company, bhartiya vastuon kii kharid ke liye do karod rupaye kii keemtee dhaatu bharat laai thi
 This move of the company was criticized by the British government but after the Carnatic Wars and the Plassey and Buxar Wars, the situation changed dramatically
 bengal divaani british company ko praapt hon ke saath company ne apane nivesh kii samasya ko sulajhaa liya
 Now a part of the sum of the money received from internal trade, the money received from the Bengal plunder and the money received from the Bengal addict began to be invested for the purchase of Indian goods
 is prakaar bharat ne britain ko jo niryaat kiya uske badale bharat ko koi aarthik, bhautik athwa vittiya laabh praapt nahin hua
 But a part of the revenue derived from the Diwali of Bengal was transferred from India to Britain in the form of goods
 ise britain ke paksh main bharat se dhan kaa hastantaran kaha ja saktaa he
 This process continued till 1813, but under the 1813 AD charter, the revenue account of the company and the business account of the company were separated
 1813 i
 ke charter ke tahat bharat kaa rasta british vastuon ke liye khol diya gaya tathaa bharat main company kaa vyapaarik ekadhikaar samaapt kar diya gaya
 This can be seen as a significant change
 sthiti us samay or bhi chintajanak rahi jab britain tathaa europe main bhi company ke dwaara bharat se niryaat kiye jane vaale taiyaar maal ko hatotsahit kiya jane laga
 The result was that now a problem of money had arisen before the company to give its share holders
 armbh main company ne nil or kapaas kaa niryaat kar is samasya ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya, kintu bhartiya nil or kapaas caribbian deshon ke utpaada tathaa saste shram ke kaaran kam laagat main taiyaar america utpaadon ke saamne nahin tik sake
 Therefore, export agencies had to incur losses
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki company ne vikalp ke rup main bharat main opium ke utpaadan par bal diya
 Large quantities of opium were then exported to China
 opium kaa niryaat chini logon ke swasth ke liye jitna ghaatak tha utana hi company ke vyavsaayik swasthya ke liye aavashyak tha
 Even when the opium trade was opposed, the British company forcibly imposed this deadly poison on China
 britain bharat se china ko opium niryaat karata or badale resham or chaay kii ugaahi karata or munafa kamata
 Thus, exports from India continued but in turn could not be imported in that proportion
 apane parivartit swaroop ke saath 1858 i
 ke pashchaat bhi yah samasya bani rahi
 The British took over the administration of India in 1858 AD
 is parivartan ke praavdhaanon ke tahat bharat ke prashasan ke liye bharat sachiv ke pad kaa srijan kiya gaya
 The expenses of the Secretary of India and his council were put into the Indian account
 1857 i
 ke vidroh ko dabaane main jo rakam kharch hui thi, use bhi bhartiya khate main daalaa gaya
 Even more noticeable is that the Indian government used to send a fixed amount every year to the UK as a household expenditure
 vyay kii is rakam main kai maden shaamil hoti thim, yatha-railway par pratyaabhoot byaaj, sarkari karj par byaaj, bharat ke liye britain main kii jane vaali sainik samagriyon kii kharid, bharat se sevanivrutt british adhikariyon ke pension kii rakam ityadi
 Thus the amount of household expenditure was calculated as withdrawal of money
 ullekhneey he ki 19veen sadi main dhan ke bahirgaman main keval grih-vyay hi shaamil nahin tha varan isamen kuch anya maden bhi jodi jaati thim
 For example, the part of the salary of British officers working in India, which was saved from India and sent to Britain and the profits of private British businessmen who were sent from India to Britain
 phir jab san 1870 ke dashak main british pond stalling kii tulana main rupe kaa avamulayan hua to iske saath hi nikasi kiye gaye dhan kii vaastavik raashi main pehle kii apeksha or bhi adhik vruddhi ho gai
 Dadabhai Naoroji has given 6 reasons which led to the principle of money-expulsion
 rashtravaadi vichaarkon ne dhan ke nishkasana ke siddhanth kaa pratipaadan karte hue samrajyavad evam rashtrawaad ke bich antarvirodh ko pahchaan liya or is tarah aarthik rashtrawaad kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 This helped in dismissing all the claims of the British government, such as utilitarianism, symbols of modernization, self-rule, education, etc
 yahi aarthik rashtrawaad kii chetana 1906 main swadeshi andolan main ubharkar aane lagi jab videshi vastuon kaa bahishkaar or swadeshi vastuon kaa prasar kaa naaraa lagaaya gaya
 The expulsion of funds did not lead to investment in silk industry, trade, agriculture etc
 parinamswaroop logon kii prati vyakti aay ghatane lagi
 The continuation of the famine made their lives more frightening
 is prakaar europe ke anya rajyon ke saapeksh, bharat ke logon kaa jeevanaster evam jivan-pratyaasha donon gata or yahi shoshit log kalaantar main bhartiya rashtrawaad ke saamaajik aadhaar banakar ubhare
 In the theory of expulsion of wealth propounded by Naoroji, Ramesh Chandra Dutt presented the first rationalist history on the economy of modern India as "the Economic History of India", adding a new dimension
 apane is prasiddh granth main unhone dhan ke nishkasana ke siddhant ko ek nae kone se dekhne kaa prayaas kiya
 They have attempted to study the British government by looting Indian money into three phases
 is charan main british sarkaar kaa mukhya uddeshy bhartiya vyapaar par ekadhikaar sthapit karnaa, adhik se adhik munafa kamanaa, bhartiya vyapaar ke liye britain se laae jane vaale dhan ko band karnaa or bhartiya dhan se jo lut dastak durupyog evam vyapaarik ekadhikaar se praapt aay yaa dhan se hi bhartiya vastuon ko kharidne evam niryaat karnaa tha
 After the Industrial Revolution in Britain, a new political and economic scenario emerged
 is paridrishy main britain main ek shashakt madhyam varg ubharkar aane laga jo audyogic kranti se paidaa hua tha
 As a result, it became mandatory to reestablish the economic relations between Britain and India in the interest of this middle class
 isi paripekshya main 1813 kaa adhinium paarit kiya gaya jiske dwaara bhartiya vyapaar par east india company ke vyapaarik ekadhikaar ko samaapt kar diya gaya or bhartiya vyapaar evam vaanijya ko puure british nagarikon ke liye khol diya gaya
 As a result, the Indian market was filled with British materials
 is avadhi main british sarkaar kii aarthik niti kaa mukhya maang tha:-
