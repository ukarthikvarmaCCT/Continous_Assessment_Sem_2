 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 It is generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the Quran dealing with natural phenomena

 quran kaa sandesh vibhinn saahitiyik sanrachanaon or upkarnon ke saath vyakt kiya gaya he
 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai
 The effectiveness of such a form is evident for example in Sura 81, and there is no doubt that these passages influenced the audience's conscience
 chhandon ke ek set se duusare signal main aksar kavita kaa parivartan charchaa ke vishay main ek badlaav hota he
 Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed
 bechnaa quran kii adhik charchaa kii punrariti ko bhi sambodhit karata he, ise ek saahitiyik upkaran ke rup main bhi dekhtaa he

 stephen wild ke anusaar, quran sancharit hone vaale shabdon ko samajhane, vargeekrut karne, vyakhya karne or nyaaysangat karke is metatextility ko darshata he
 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm
 ek dhanya yaad he jise hamane neeche bhej diya he, to kya aap ab ise asweekaar kar rahe hai? "), yaa" kahen "tag kii lagaataar upasthiti main, jab mohammad ko bolne kaa aadesh diya jaataa he

 Main article: Tafsir quran ne quran ke chhandon ke arthon ko samajhane, unke aayaat ko spasht karne or unke mahatv ko jaanane ke uddeshy se tippanee or vyakhya kaa ek vishaal nikaay udaaya he
 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab
 un dinon main akjejesis kavita ke saahitiyik pahaluon, iske prakaashan kii prishthbhumi or kabhi-kabhi, duusare kii madad se ek kavita kii vyakhya ke spashtikaran tak hi simit tha
 If the poem was about a historical event, some traditions of Muhammad were sometimes described to illustrate its meaning
 chunki quran shastreey arabi main boli jaati he, baad main kai islam main parivartit nahin hote the, ve hameshaa kuranik arabi ko nahin samajhate the, unhone un musalamaanon ko nahin pakadaa jo musalamaanon ke arabi main dharapravaah the or ve sulajhane se chintit the quran main vishyon ke spasht sangharsh
 Commentators who commented in Arabic explained the signs, and perhaps most importantly explained that the Quranic verses were revealed in Muhammad's prophetic career, which was appropriate for the earliest Muslim community, and which was later revealed Was done, canceling or "abrogating" Nasakh) earlier text
 haalanki, anya vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main koi nirasan nahin hua he
 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Quran 7: 143 says: jab musa us vakt aayaa jab hamane niyukt kiya, or uske allaah ne usase baat kii, to usne kaha, 'he mere allaah, mujhe apane aap ko dikhaao! mujhe tumhe dekhne do!' usne kaha, 'tum mujhe nahin dekhoge, lekin us pahaad ko dekho, agar yah drudh rahata he to aap mujhe dekhenge
 'when his lord revealed himself on the mountain, he spoiled it
 musa behosh ho gaya
 When he recovered, he said, 'hail! i repent to you! I'm the first to believe it! 7: 143 main musa, prem main rahane waalon kaa maarg aata he, vah ek drushti maangata he lekin uski ichha se inkaar kiya jaataa he, use pahaad ke alaava anya dekhne ke liye ajna di jaati he, jabaki parvat dekhne main sakasham hota he parameshwar

 sufi ke drushtikon se, bhagwaan hameshaa priy or raste main rahane vaale kii ichha or pidaa sachai ko saakaar karne kaa kaaran banati he
 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 salaphis or jahiri ke vipareet, shiya or sufis ke saath-saath kuch anya muslim darshanikon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa arth shabdic pahalu tak hi simit nahin he
 For him, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has internal aspects
 henry corbin ek haddees kaa varnan karata he jo mohammad waapas jaataa he: The Quran has external presence and a hidden depth, an extraordinary meaning and an esoteric meaning
 badale main yah gudh arth ek gudh arth chhupaata he 
 So this goes for seven esoteric meanings
 is vichaar ke anusaar, yah bhi spasht ho gaya he ki quran kaa aantarik arth apane bahari arth ko khatm yaa amaanya nahin karata he
 Instead, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body

 ek gudh slant ke saath tippaneekaron kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa antim arth keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahris, is the belief that the Quran should be taken only in its explicit meaning
 punarmoolyankan kuch purv musalamaanon kii harmeniuteel style kaa naam he jo isai dharm main parivartit ho gaye hai
 His style or repetition is ad hoc and non-systematic and geared towards apologizing

 In 1726 the Ottoman ban on printing in Arabic script was lifted for non-religious texts at the request of Ibrahim Mutérica, who printed his first book in 1729
 bahut kam kitaaben, or koi dharmik granth mudrit nahin kiya gaya tha ek or shatabdi ke liye turk samrajya main
 In 1786, Catherine the Great of Russia sponsored a printing press for "tatar and Turkish orthography" in St
 Petersburg, with a mullah Usman Ismail responsible for Arabic-type production
 1787 main is press ke saath ek quran mudrit kiya gaya tha, 1790 or 1793 main saint petersburg main or 1 99 3 main kazan main punarnirmit kiya gaya tha 
 The first edition printed in Iran appeared in Tehran, a translation in Turkish was printed in Cairo in 1842, and the first officially accepted Ottoman version was finally printed in Constantinople between 1875 and 1877 as a two-volume set, first
 During the constitutional era
 gustav flugel 1834 main quran ke ek sanskaran prakashit main lipzig he, jo ek sadi ke kareeb ke liye aadhikarik bane rahe, jab tak kairo ke al ajahar vishvavidhyalay quran ke ek sanskaran prakashit 1924 main is sanskaran ek lambey taiyaari ke parinaam ke rup main yah kuran manakikrut tha orthography or baad ke sanskarnon kaa aadhaar bana hua he
 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted
 kai vidwaanon ne kaha he ki khud ko spasht pustak kehane ke baavjood spashtataa kii kami he

 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language
 quran yahudee or isai pavitra kitabon or bhakthi sahitya main sunai gai kai logon or ghatnaon kii kahaniyon ko yaad karata he, haalanki yah kai vivaranon main bhinn he
 Adam, Idris, Noah, Eber, Saleh, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Shoaib, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Yunus, Aaron, Moses, Zacharias, John Jesus, mention of Rasool in the Quran And has been performed as a prophet
 vastav main, quran main kisi anya vyakti kii tulana main musa kaa adhik ullekh kiya gaya he
 Jesus is more frequently mentioned in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran and not in the Gospel
 bahaai or drus jaise kuch gaiyr-muslim samooh quran ko pavitra maanate hai
 Unitarian Universalists also draw inspiration from the Quran
 diateceron, james kii protevangelin, infansi gospel of thomas, gospel of sudo maitheus jaisi kitabon ke saransh kuran se samanthaayen rakhte hai
 One scholar has suggested that diatesiron as a gospel harmony may have given rise to the notion that the Christian gospel is a text
 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered
 pashchimi vichaarak ech
ji
wales ke anusaar is dharti par pravachan to bahut die gaye kintu un pravachanon ke aadhaar par ek samaaj kii rachana pehali baar hazarat mohammad ne karke dikhaai
 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 aazaadee ke liye vir ladaai main gauravshaalee adhyay chaatr shaheedon ke yuva rakt ko likhe gaye the
 And in the furnace of this anti-colonial struggle, the All India Students Union was born in Lucknow in August 1936

 The conflict broke out
 chaatro ko in ladaaiyon main se kai main aakarshith kiya gaya tha, kyonki ve samaaj ke kisi bhi anya varg ke rup main samaaj kaa hissaa hai or poonjivadi arthvyavastha ke peedit hai
 Students also waged powerful wars, strikes, and other actions on their specific demand: democratization and reform in education, democratic and political rights, jobs, socialist cultural, sports, and other recreational facilities
 chaatr in sabhi muddon par nirantar ladaai kar rahe hai

 Thus the terminology prepared on various occasions was published under the title 'definitive Vocabulary', which on the one hand was intended to provide the basis for the coordination work of the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology and on the other hand the writers were unanimous for new concepts in the interim period
 The term was to be provided

 This new type of vocabulary is referred to in English as 'acronym'

 isi varshganth ko yaadgaar banane ke liye mountbaton ne 15 agast 1947 ko bharat kii aazaadee ke liye tay kiya tha
 But the people of Bhopal had to wait two years later to become part of the Union of India
 tab sardaar patel ne koi 562 deshi riyasaton ko bharat main milakar bharat ko ek sutara main baandha or bharat ko maujuuda swaroop diya
 Being a skilled administrator, the grateful nation also remembers him as an 'iron Man'
 aazaadee prapti ke dauraan bharat main kareeb 562 deshi riyaasaten thim
 Sardar Patel was then the Home Minister of the country with the Deputy Prime Minister in the interim government
 junagarh, hyderabad or kashmir ko chhodir 562 riyasaton ne swezcha se bhartiya parisangh main shaamil hone kii sweekruti di thi
 In fact, the proposal which Mountbatten had put before Jawaharlal Nehru regarding India's independence, included that 565 princely states of India would choose to merge with one or the other in India and Pakistan and if they wanted to go with both of them, they would also be independent
 Will be able to keep in 565 rajavaadon jinamein se adhikansh princeli state the main se bharat ke hisse main aae rajavaadon ne ek-ek karke vilay patr par hastakshar kar die, yaa yun kah sakate hai ki sardaar vallabh bhai patel tathaa veepi menon ne hastakshar karvaa liye
 The survivors were - Hyderabad, Junagadh, Kashmir and Bhopal
 inamen se bhopal kaa vilay sabase ant main bharat main hua
 The last princely state to join the Union of India was Bhopal because Patel and Menon knew that Bhopal would have to meet eventually
 junagarh pakistan main milane kii ghoshnaa kar chukaa tha to kashmir swatantra bane rahane kii
 The three states of Junagadh, Kashmir and Hyderabad were merged with the help of the army but this was not required in Bhopal
 bhopal jahaan nawab hamidullah khan us riyasat ke nawab the jo bhopal, sihor or raisen tak faili hui thi
 This princely state was founded in 1723-24 by the brave Afghan warrior friend Muhammad Khan of Aurangzeb's army, conquering Sehore, Ashta, Khilchipur and Ginnor
 1728 main dost mohammad khan kii mrityu ke baad uske bete yaar mohammad khan ke rup main bhopal riyasat ko apana pehla nawab mila tha
 When Mohammad Khan was the Nawab in March 1818, the princely state of Bhopal became the princely state of the Indian British Empire under the Anglo Bhopal Treaty
 1926 main usee riyasat ke nawab bane the hamidullah khan
 Nawab Hamidullah, educated from Aligarh University, became Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes twice in 1931 and 1944 and was the Chancellor at the time of Partition of India
 aazaadee kaa masauda ghoshit hone ke saath hi unhone 1947 main chancelar pad se tyaagptr de diya tha, kyonki ve rajavaadon kii swatantraaa ke pakshdhar the
 Nawab Hamidullah was in a trance till 14 August 1947 to decide what to do

 On August 13, he asked his daughter Abida to become the ruler of the princely state of Bhopal so that he could go to Pakistan to take up the post of secretary general, but Abida refused
 bhopal kaa vilinikaran sabase ant main hua to uske peeche ek kaaran ye bhi tha ki nawab hamidullah jo chembar of princes ke chancelar the unka desh kii aantarik raajnneeti main bahut dakhal tha, ve nehru or jinna donon ke ghanishtha mitra the
 In March 1948, Nawab Hamidullah declared Bhopal to be independent
 may 1948 main nawab ne bhopal sarkaar kaa ek mantrimandal ghoshit kar diya tha jiske pradhanmantri chaturnarayan malviya the
 By this time, by the time the rebellion in the princely state of Bhopal began to flourish
 saath hi vilinikaran kii sutaradhar patel-menon kii jodi bhi dabaav banane lagi thi
 Another problem was revealed that Chatur Narayan Malaviya had also been in favor of merger
 prajamandal vilinikaran andolan kaa pramukh dal ban chukaa tha
 In October 1948, the Nawab went on Hajj and in December 1948, a tremendous demonstration of Bhopal's history was about the merger, many protesters were arrested including Thakur Lal Singh, Dr
 Shankar Dayal Sharma, Bhairon Prasad and Uddhavdas Mehta
 puraa bhopal band tha, rajya kii police andolankariyon par pani phenk kar unhen niyantrit karne kii koshish kar rahi thi
 On 23 January 1949, Dr

 Finally, on 29 January 1949, the Nawab sacked the cabinet and once again took all the sources of power in his hand
 pandit chaturnarayan malviya ikkis din ke upwas par baith chuke the
 VP Menon was watching the entire incident in Bhopal, he was staying in Lal Kothi and under constant pressure on the Nawab

 Sardar Patel in a letter to the Nawab said - It was a great disappointment and sad for me that you did not let your undisputed skills and abilities come to the use of the country when the country needed it

 Loss of the structure of teeth due to any kind of mechanical force is called bruising
 This rubbing occurs when there is an object in the middle of the teeth or fur is rubbed in the teeth by taking any object repeatedly
 If for any reason, this force is in the cementoanimal junction of the teeth, then there is a lot of rubbing in the teeth, because the enamel layer is thin at that place!

 karl marks ne apane piechdi shodh-prabandh ke baad likhi gayi pehali lambi rachana main kaafii gahanta se rajya kii avadharana kaa vishleshan kiya tha
 The title of this work was: 'critique of Heagels Philosophy of State'
 baad main marks ne apane aitihaasik lekhan main rajya par gaharaai se vichaar kiya
 In this context, 'class Struggle in France', 'attinth Brumer of Louis Bonaparte' and 'civil War in France' can be specially mentioned
 angels ne bhi anti-dyuhring or origin of family main rajya par vistaar se charchaa kii he
 Lenin tried to reinterpret the Marxist theory of the state in his Management State and Revolution written just before the Bolshevik revolution
 parvarti marxvaadi chintakon main gramshi ne bhi rajya kii bhoomika par gaharaai se vichaar kiya
 But a major reason for less attention to the state in the debates in Marxism after World War II was the dominance of Stalinism within official or Soviet Marxism
 iske tahat koshish rahati thi ki marxvad ke bheetar vibhinn shreniyon ke bare main kisi gahare vaad-vivaad ko badhaava na diya jaae
 In addition, the concept of state was also neglected due to the economic determinism that often dominates Marxism
 iske tahat maan liya gaya tha ki rajya adhirachana kaa bhaag he, jisaki ruparekha or prakruti hameshaa hi aarthik aadhaar dwaara tay hoti he
 But from the sixties, considerable debate began within Marxism about the state and its 'relative autonomy'
 isamen alathuse, polantsaz or miliband jaise vidwaanon ne yogadan kiya
 Marx developed his ideas about the state by reviewing Hegel's political philosophy
 higel ne filosphi of ritis main yah bataaya he ki saamaajik jivan ke teen str hote hai : parivaar, nagar samaaj or rajya
 Within the family there is a 'specific charitableism', in which the person also sacrifices his interests for the good of his family
 duusari ore, nagar samaaj ‘saarvbhaum ahamvaad’ kaa kshetra he
 Here every person gives more importance to his interests than the interests of others
 nagar samaaj main log ek-duusare par nirbhar bhi hote hai
 But his behavior towards others is mechanical and full of selfishness
 higel maanate hai ki rajya ek aisa dayera he jo ‘saarvbhaumik parmarthwaad’ kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 They consider it to be the last and highest stop of human consciousness
 unki nigaah main rajya har vyakti kii ichchhaaon ko pratibimbit karata he
 Marx accepts Hegel's ideas about family and civil society, but not about the state
 marks kaa kahana he ki nagar samaaj main vibhinn vyaktiyon or virgon ke bich hone vaali hode kaa vistaar rajya tak hota he
 The dominant class uses the state to serve its interests and assert its dominance over other classes
 asal main, marks ke lekhan main poonjeewaadi rajya ke bare main do tarah ke vichaar milte hai
 Generally there would have been more discussion of the first principle which is described in the Communist Manifesto
 iske anusaar, ‘aadhunik rajya kii karypalika puure burjwa maamalon kaa prabandhan karne vaali samiti he
 'here the state has been seen as an instrument of the ruling class
 yani poonjeewaadi vyavastha main poonjipatiyon kaa is par aadhipaty hota he
 In this way, Marx rejects the basic idea of the liberal state that the state decides the interests of all the people of society in a neutral and impartial manner
 lekin marks ne ettinth brumer of lui bonapart main rajya ke bare main doosraa drushtikon bhi pesh kiya he
 In this, Marx, while examining the revolutionary events of France between 1848 and 1851, argued that 'the state is relatively autonomous'
 iskaa arth yah he ki rajya samaaj par apni ichha thopane main samarth he
 The reason, according to Marx, was that Bonapartism in France was an opportunistic and populist nexus between a part of the Bज़rzva and a part of the proletariat
 iskaa mukhya lakshya apane shashan ke liye vaidhata hasil karnaa tha
 It showed that autonomy of the state can be achieved if there is a clear balance between class-powers in the society
 rajya aisi sthiti main apni ichha thopane main samarth hota he
 This approach of Marx is different from his earlier approach
 yahan rajya prabhutvshaalee varg kaa yantra nahin he, balki use kuch swaittata bhi mili hui he
 But the autonomy of the state is not unlimited
 use sirf aanshik swaittata hi mili hoti he
 The state mediates between the competing classes
 is tarah, yah virgon ke astitv ko bhi kaayam rakhata he
 Marx and Engels have emphasized that with the abolition of capitalism, the capitalist state will also end and the dictatorship of the proletariat will be established
 spashtatah marks ne yah mana ki rajya ek aisa yantra he jiske dwaara aarthik rup se prabhutvshaalee varg duusare virgon kaa daman kar saktaa he
 Therefore every state is an example of class-dictatorship
 yahan sarvhaara ke faaydon kaa matlab yah he ki kranti ke faaydon kaa surakshit rakhaa jaae or burjwa varg kii prati-kranti ko roka jaae
 Lenin gave more clarity to the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat based on the needs and experiences of the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik Revolution
 unhone state and revolution main is ‘sanshodhanavaadee’ vichaar kaa virodh kiya burjwa rajya ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 He tried to fully establish within Marxism the idea that the overthrow of the state of Burzwa was the only option
 unhone marxvad main loktantric cendravaad ke aadhaar par party ke gathan kaa vichaar joda or party kii bhoomika ko spasht rup se rekhaankit kiya
 According to him, after the revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat will be established in which some of the special institutions existing during the capitalist rule will be removed and instead of them, such institutions will be established which will enable the people to exercise state power
 jaise-jaise log khud rajya-satta upyog karne lagenge, vaise-vaise rajya-satta kii aavashyaktaa or bhoomika kam hoti jaaegi
 After Lenin, Stalin tried to establish the principle that the state does not represent only the interests of the minority or the majority, but involves everyone's interest
 is tarah stallin ne rajya or iske faisalon ko sarvocch bana diya
 There was a danger in Lenin's view that the dictatorship of the proletariat could turn into a dictatorship of the party
 stallin ne apane shashan dwaara is ashanka ko sahi sabit kiya
 Even in other countries, where the Marxist revolution was done with the party at the center, after the revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat became the dictatorship of the Communist Party
 isane asahmati kii abhivyakti ko asambhav bana diya
 This led to widespread violence and state repression in the countries ruled by the Communist Party
 parmparik rup se marxvad ke bheetar rajya ko daman yaa bal-prayog se joda jaataa rahaa he
 Italian Marxist thought Antonio Gramshi introduced a new idea in Marxism
 unke anusaar shaasha varg sirf daman yaa bal- prayog dwaara apana prabhutv kaayam nahin rakhata he
 For this he also uses ideological tools
 vah bal-prayog se hi apana kaam nahin chalaata, balki varchasv kii rachana bhi karata he
 By domination, the ruling class acquires the consent of the classes over which it has to maintain dominion
 shiksha or jansanchaar madhyam isamen madad karte hai
 They can also be called ideological states
 gramshi ne spasht kiya ki rajya or shaasha varg kai dafaa shasit virgon kii bahut si maangon ko sweekaar karte hai
 The ruled are made to realize that the work of the state is also in their best interest
 is tarah gramshi ne rajya ke marxvaadi vishleshan main ek nayaa aayam joda
 French scholar Louis Althuse developed the idea of ideological state machinery and oppressive state machinery
 alathuse sanrachnawadi hai
 He emphasized that both the ideological state system and the oppressive state machinery work to maintain the system according to the interests of the ruling class
 ye donon saadhan yaa tareeke alag- alag hone ke baavjood aapas main jude hue hai
 The first is the oppressive state machinery, which includes law, courts, police, army and other state institutions
 yadi koi vyakti rajya ke nirdeshon kaa paalan nahin karata he to us par jurmaana lagaakar yaa use jail bhejkar sazaa di jaati he
 The second is the ideological state-system that works through ideology rather than strength
 isamen ve kshetra shaamil hai, jahaan ham apane vyaktigat vichaar or azaadi hasil karte hai or unka prayog karte hai
 Althuse clarifies that the repressive state-system is not only based on the use of force, but also has to seek the help of ideology
 masalan, sena, nyaayalay aadi bhi ek str par kisi khaas vichaardhaara ke anuroop hi kaam karte hai
 Similarly, ideology is not only used in institutions under the ideological polity, like churches, schools, etc
 It also uses force from time to time
 alathuse vaicharik rajya-tantra main shiksha kii bhoomika ko kaafii mahatvapurn maanate hai
 Unlike Gramshi, they not only associate it with the development of standards, values, concept of society, etc
, but they believe that it plays a serious role in division of labor
 arthath yah vishisht logon ko vishisht shram ke laayak banaata he
 However, Althusse, like Gramshi, believes that any ruling class can maintain its supremacy only when it controls both the oppressive state system and the ideological state system
 gramshi kii tarah hi ve bhi maanate hai ki vichaardhaaratmak str par shaasha virgon ko chunauti dena aavashyak he
 Despite some similarities between Althuse and Gramsci's views, it is clear that Althusse expressed his views as a structuralist and preferred the role of structures rather than the individual
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki marks kii utpaadan pranali kii avadharana main teen vishisht sanrachaayen yaa str hote hai 
 These three form the matrix of the production system closely and internally
 kisi saamaajik vyavastha main aarthik, raajnneetik or vichaardhaaratmak main se koi bhi prabhutvshaalee raajnneetik sanrachana ho sakati he, lekin aarthik sanrachana hameshaa yah tay karti he ki in teenon main se koun sabase prabhutvshaalee hoga
 Nicos Pollantz used the structuralist interpretation of Marx by Althusse to study the state
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki polantsaz kii pehali rachana or duusari rachana ke bich main unke vichaaron main badlaav aayaa
 His first book Political Power and Social Classes was published in 1968 and the second State Power and Socialism in 1978
 pehali kitaab puri tarah se sanrachnawadi thi
 It is shown reproducing the state class structure, as it is an expression of economic class relations in the political arena
 isliye rajya kaa swaroop or kaary varg sambandhon kii sanrachana se tay hota he
 In his early work, Polantzas also argues that there is no all-inclusive and timeless state like the Hegelist ideal
 vishisht utpaadan pranali ke anusaar hi rajya bhi hota he, jaise ki poonjeewaadi rajya, saamanti rajya aadi
 Apart from this, in his book, he also uses the idea of althuse that politics and economics have 'relative autonomy'
 isaki madad se ve tark dete hai ki poonjeewaadi rajya vargeey rajya he or nishchit taur par ise prabhavakaari tareeke se kaam karne ke liye utpaadan main hone vaale varg-sangharsh se saapekshik rup se swytt hona chahie
 According to this logic, the bourgeoisie is divided into several factions, and the group which is dominated by them, as a organization, has a relatively autonomous state as a place which is divided into several factions
 As a group organization occurs
 mazdooron kaa sangharsh keval usee seemaa tak rajya ko prabhavit karata he, jis seemaa tak vah utpaadan main varg-sambandhon kaa bhaag hota he
 Pollantz's writings were criticized on many levels
 is sandarbh main new lekrat rivyuu main, 1969-70 main rolf miliband or ponlatsaj ke bich hue vaad-vivaad kaa marxvad ke bheetar mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Miliband, in his book The State in Capitalist Society, published in 1969, criticized the polytheistic model of the state presented by Polantasz
 isamen unhone poonjeewaadi varg-samaaj main rajya kii bhoomika ke bare main marxvaadi vichaar kaa apana sanskaran pesh kiya
 Generally, Miliband's approach is referred to as mechanicalism and Polantzas' view of structuralism
 miliband polantsaz dwaara prastut bahulwaadi model kii aalochana karte hue kehete hai ki poonjeewaadi varg ke sadasyon kii rajya-tantra or sarkaar main sidhi bhagidaari hoti he
 For this reason, the state is directly tied to the interests of Burjwa and expresses the same interests
 polantsaz ne isaki aalochana karte hue kaha ki burjwa varg or rajya ke bich vastunishth sambandh hota he
 This means that if the actions of the state decide the social system and the dominant class in this social system meets the interests of the state, then it becomes one of this system
 aise main shaasha varg ke sadasyon kii rajya-sanyantr main sidhi bhagidaari is vastunishth sambandh kaa kaaran nahin hoti he, balki iskaa prabhaav hoti he
 In response to this, Miliband argued that replacing the concept of the ruling class with the concept of objective structure and objective relations meant bringing a particular kind of 'structural determinism' or 'structural determinism'
 in donon ke bich chali is bahes ke sandarbh main martin cornoy ne yah tark diya he ki asal main donon ke hi lekhan main yantric yaa nirdharanwadi pravritiyaan maujuud hai
 Therefore, it is not right to call one as mechanical and the other as structuralist
 baharhaal, is vaad-vivaad or duusare kai tarah ke vichaaron ke saamne aane ke baad polantsaz ne apane vichaaron main thodaa sanshodhan kiya
 In his later work, Polantzás abandoned the idea of a structuralist state
 isaki jagah, unhone is baat par jor diya ki rajya kaa swaroop khud varg- sangharsh dwaara tay hota he
 In 1973, Polantas argued that there is a different kind of relationship between social classes and the state, which depends on the stage of capitalist development
 isliye poonjeewaadi utpaadan sambandhon main badlaav raajnneetik sansthaaon ke swaroop ko tay karata he
 The 'structure' of a capitalist state is not a 'structure'
 iske bajaay, yah sanrachanaayen varg-sangharsh or iske kaaran poonjeewaadi utpaadan main hone vaale badlaavon se tay hoti hai
 In state, power and socialism, they make the state's 'relative autonomy' dialectical
 is daleel ke mutabik rajya-tantron ke bheetar varg-sangharsh kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki ‘swaittata’ ke bheetar hi virodhabhas nihit hota he
 He emphasized that these contradictions and social movements are determining the nature of the state
