 kabhi-kabhi ise 'tarabhautikee' bhi kah diya jaataa he haalaanki vah khagolbhautikee kii ek pramukh shakha he jisamen taron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Inspired by a keen desire to understand the mysteries of nature, man started studying celestial pandas
 usne inke vishay main jitani soochna keval netron kii sahaayta se praapt kii ja sakati thi praapt kii; udhaahrant:, vah prithvi kii dainik tathaa vaarshik gatiyon or unase sambhddha bhautik ghatnaon, chandramaa kii kalaon tathaa chandra maas, grahon kii gatiyon aadi ko samajhane laga
 But as long as the sun, moon and planets were considered to be images and stars, light could not be known about them
 italy ke jyotishi gallilyon gallily ne san 1612 main akashamandal ke adhyayan main pehali baar doordarshee kaa prayog kiya; kintu jab tak doordarshee kii rachana main samuchit unnati nahin hui, iske upyog se bhi grahprishthon ke adhyayan ke atirikt koi or vishesh mahatvapurn soochna na praapt kii ja saki
 As the design of the telescope continued to improve, its utility in astrological research increased, but astronomy began in the second quarter of the 19th century, when the German physicist, Gustaf Robert Kirkhhoff, in the study of the sun and other starlight, The principles of spectrography propounded by is saadhan ke vikaas main photography se atyant sahaayta mili, kyonki isaki sahaayta se aalokit varncrampatt sthaayee rup se tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye uplabdh hone lage
 The same photometry and means of measuring the intensity of the spectral lines provided invaluable information about the physical state of celestial bodies, aiding in the study of spectrometry
 jab koi gas jalaai jaati he tab, kirkhhof ke siddhant ke anusaar, vah shwet prakaash kaa vikiran na karke keval vishesh varnon ke prakaash kaa hi vikiran karti he
 These characters are called characteristic characters of gas
 in varnon main koun koun se varna prakat honge, yah us bhautik avasthaa main sthit deeptiman gas main se yadi shwet prakaash gaman kare, to shwet prakaash kaa varnakram santat nahin hota, varan usamen gas ke lakshanik varna anupasthit hote hai
 Additionally, if the temperature of the origin of white light is higher than the temperature of the gas, black lines, called Fraunhofer lines, appear in place of the characteristic characters of the gas in the spectroscope
 in kaali rekhaon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shwet prakaash kis kis gas main gaman karke varnakramdarshi tak pahunchaa he tathaa uske gas parmaanu kis bhautik avasthaa main hai
 Kirkhoff proposed this theory based on experiments
 parantu aage chalakar parmanurachana ke gyaan or kwantum siddhant kii sahaayta se varnakramiki ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan saidhantik rup se kiya ja sakaa
 It is clear from the above statement that there is a natural limit to the utility of spectral means in the study of astrophysics
 yah isliye ki varnakramdarshi padaarth kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main tabhi soochna de saktaa he jab yah padaarth deeptiman gas ke rup main ho
 Therefore, by this means it will not be able to know what substances are located in the path of light and what is their physical state
 khagoleey pindon se jo prakaash aata he vah uske aantarik bhaagon main utpann hota he, phir bhi un bhaagon kii rachana ke vishay main varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He is only able to give information about the gas circle that surrounds these bodies
 falat: in pindon ke aantarik bhaagon kii rachana tathaa bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main jaanane ke liye varnakramiki se bhinn sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 These tools will be described further
 agyayan ke sadhano ke vichaar se tarapind ko do mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: aantarik bhaag or gasmandal Based on the study of the spectrum, many facts have been known about stars, the main of which is the following: surya tathaa anya taare deeptiman gas ke vishaal goleey pind hai, jinke aantarik bhaagon ke prishth kaa taap, jise prishthiya kehete hai, sahasron anshon tak hota he
 As the stars move towards the center of the star, the temperature increases; Even the central temperature is found to be several hundred thousand
 ? The interior of each star is surrounded by a gasosphere
 in gasmandalon main jo tatv pahachaane gaye he ve sab prithvi par bhi paae jate hai
 This does not mean that there will be no other elements here than those found on earth
 vastav main taron ke varnakram main aisi fronhophar rekhaayen pai jaati hai jo prithvi par paae janevaale kisi bhi tatv kii rekhaon se bhinn hai
 Hydrogen, helium, carbon, iron, etc
 are mainly present in the gas system of stars
 bhartiya jyotishi, meghnad saaha, ne san 1922 main apane prasiddh ooshmpyanan sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya, jisaki sahaayta se varnakram pattee kaa vaastavik tathy samajha ja saktaa he
 The Saha Sutra, after the visionary, is the most important invention in astrology, in the words of the famous British astrologer Eddington
 taare ke satat varnakram ke adhyayan se uskaa prabhavi taap nishchit kiya jaataa he
 In the exploration it is imagined that Tara is an ideal Krishna body, which means that its surface is organized in such a way that it completely absorbs all the radiation that falls on it
 kirkhhof or bailphor or stuart ne yah siddh kiya he ki yadi pind kii urja main parivartan na ho, to prayek varna main uske vikiran or avasorana kii matraayen ek vishesh anupaat main hoti hai
 The word Krishna has no relation to the visible color of the body
 aise pind ke saidhantik, athwa prayogtmak, adhyayan ne yah siddh kiya he ki vishesh taap par prayek varna kii tivrata nishchit hoti he
 Planck has formulated a formula based on thermodynamics, which suggests that in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a certain intensity of radiation of a character of the ideal Krishna body
 upar diya rekhachitr tarangadaidhray or vikiran kii tivrata main sambandh bataata he
 For a given temperature of the body, the limited area between the axis of the curve and the wavelength determines the total energy that the radiating star is emitting every moment in the sky
 in vakron se yah bhi spasht he ki pind ke taap main parivartan ke saath hi saath mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 In fact, as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength of greatest intensity decreases, that is, it moves towards the visible part in the spectrum
 adarsh krishna pind ke liye plank niyam ke anusaar taap or mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray ke sambandh ko prakat karanevaala sutara saralata se gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Therefore, to determine the effective temperature of the star, firstly by studying its spectrum, the wavelength of radiation of greatest intensity is found
 taare kaa prabhavi taap vastav main us adarsh krishna pind kaa taap he jiske vikiran kii mahattam tivrata usee tarangadaidhray main he jisamen taare kii
 There is a large variation in the spectral text of the strings, but even if the main focus is on the main Fraunhofer lines, these spectra sheets can be divided into a few sections
 gat shatabdi main anek jyotishiyon ne taron kaa varnakram ke vichaar se vargeekaran karne kaa praytn kiya, parantu prachlit vargeekaran vartmaan shatabdi ke pratham varsho main harvard veghashaala main professor mikaring, shrimati faleming tathaa kumari kenon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Some letters have been used in this classification, which have no special scientific basis except for convenience
 is vargeekaran ke mukhya varg o, ba, e, pha, ga, k tathaa m se chihnit kiye jate hai suvidha ke liye inamen se prayek varg das upvargon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the square of a star is determined based on the intensity of the major absorption lines in its spectrum, which depend on both temperature and pressure
 at: vargeekaran main taap evam daab kaa prabhaav is prakaar vichaar me liya jaataa he ki adhikansh taare do mukhya shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja saken : vishaal taare or vaaman taare or tab prayek shrenee main avasorana rekhaon kii tivrataayen itane niyamanusaar badalati hai ki di hui tivrataon ke liye taare ke varg kaa, falat: uske prabhavi taap kaa, nishchay anany rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a large star of a given square is less than the temperature of the star of the same class
 surya vaaman shrenee kaa sadsy he
 The following table gives the characteristics of effective heat and spectrum for the Vamana series wires corresponding to these classes: aage chalakar avishisht awalokit taron ko vargeekaran main sammilit karne ke liye is vargeekaran ke prarambh main varg va or ant main na, r tathaa sa virgon kaa yoga kar diya falat: prachlit vargeekaran is prakaar he: The spectral instrument also revealed that many stars, which appear alone in photographs taken by the greatest telescopes, are actually two stars, which revolve around their center of gravity
 in taron ko varnakramdarsheey yugmak taare kehete hai
 The spectral lines of radiant gas located in a magnetic field are much wider than the radiated lines in the normal state and are broken up into two and sometimes more sublines
 ise jeman prabhaav kehete hai
 Babcock found this effect to exist in the spectroscopes of some stars, on the basis of which he concluded that these stars had magnetic fields similar to the Sun
 taron ke bich ke sthaan main sampurna rup se padaarth kaa abhaav nahin he
 There is very diffused dust and corpuscles present there
 udaahranarth, akashganga main surya ke sameep prati ghan senmi0 main madhyat: ek hydrogen parmaanu prati ghan senmi0 or prati ghan kimi0 main 10-5 senmi0 ardhavyas ke lagbhag 25 pindkhand paae jate hai
 Thus the density of the substance located in this place is about 3-10-24 grams per cubic cm
 taron ke gasmandal main bhi padaarth kaa ghanatav lagbhag itnaa hi hota he
 This statement is not true about other parts of the galaxy
 ab yah nishchit rup se gyaat he ki prayek niharika ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main ghanatv bhinn he
 The tendency of matter within the star is found to be present as dense clouds of gas
 in meghon kaa punj taron ke punj or kabhi kabhi vishaal taramandal ke punj, ke samaan hota he
 This cloud not only absorbs the light of the stars behind it, but also scatter it, due to which the light of the star starts to feel like blood color; For example, the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight at dusk and give blood to the Sun
 is prakirnan kii maatra ke adhyayan se hi taare ke bheetar ke padaarth main vidyaman pindkhandon ke madhyapariman kaa nishchay kiya jaataa he
 As already written, there is no physical means of knowing the internal composition of the stars
 at: is sanghatan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye ganitiya sadhano kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 a simple model of the inner part of the star, conceived of the observed material and the physical principles, is imagined and then the physical goals of this model are determined in the manner of mathematics
 yadi ye lakshan taron ke aalokit lakshanon ke samaan hon, to yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki taare ke aantarik bhaag main bhi waisi hi bhautik avasthaaen vidyaman hai jaisi praturup main
 How many such models have been studied
 iske falswaroop taron ke aantarik bhaag ke sanghatan ke vishay main samuchit gyaan praapt kiya ja sakaa hai
 Some types of star mass and their radius are known
 iske atirikt prayek taare kaa yah aavashyak lakshan he ki vah satat akaash main sab ore urja kaa vikiran karata rahata he
 The rate of radiation of energy, which is called the star's light, is as important as the star's mass and radius
 yadi taron ke punj or unte ardhvyaason kaa rekhachitr khinchaa jaae, to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki taare lagbhag teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 The drawing of stars and astrologers also supports this statement
 adhikansh taron ke liye unki jyoti punj ke lagbhag 3
5 ghaat ke anusaar vicharan karti he
 The group of these stars is called the main category
 jo taare is shrenee se bhinn hai, ve do prakaar ke hote hai : shwet vaaman or trumpler taare
 The light of the trumpler stars varies in proportion to their mass
 yadi ek hi punj kii mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet-vaaman kii jyotiyon ore ardhvyaason kii tulana karen, to yah paaya jaataa he ki shwet vathan mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut kam jyetishman hota he or uskaa ardhavyas bhi bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, the substance of white vamana should be very dense
 dwitiya-lubdhak shwet-vaaman shrenee kaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 Its mean density is about 6
8 j 104 grams per cubic cm
 yahi yaheen, yadi ek hi prabhavi taap ke mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet vaaman kii jyotiyon kii tulana karen, to shwet vaaman mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut hi kam jyetishmaan hota he
 These variations are indicative of differences in the internal composition of the stars
 saint james house monmouth, monmouthshire, wales main ek grad dwitiya soochibaddh imaarat he
 It exists within the medieval city walls in the historic St
 James Square
 jabaki ghar par vartmaan samay main aakarshak 18 veen sadi kaa agavada he, parantu multah is ghar ne bargej makaan ke rup main janm liya tha
 Apart from this, there is evidence of a kiln excavated in the back of the house, in which the remains of medieval and post-medieval pottery have been found
 varsh 2010 main saint james squaire main hue puratathvik utkhanan main pehali baar monmouth shahar main madhyapashan kaal kii basti hone ke pramaan milen hai
 Recent residents of St
 James House include boarding students at Monmouth School
 saint james house whitecross street ke purvi chor par sthit he jahaan yah sadak ticone saint james squaire ko gherne vaale gol chakkar par ja kar khatm ho jaati he
 The building is located on the northern side of the square, where archaeological excavations were carried out in 2009
 aadhunik samay ke kuch maanchitron main whitecross street kaa purvi hissaa, jo monk street ke saath pratichchhed se saint james squaire ko gherne vaale gol chakkar par ja kar khatm hota he, use bhi saint james squaire ke hisse ke taur par hi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, is prakaar whitecross street par sthit kuch imaaraton ke do pate he
 Similarly, St
 James House also has two addresses: 10 St
 James's Square and 10 Whitecross Street
 saint james house ko 27 june 1952 ko grad dwitiya shrenee kii imaarat kaa darja praapt hua tha
 The three-storied building has an eighteenth century abbey on it
 iskaa bahaari hissaa laal eenton se bana hua he
 The bay windows of the lower floors are rectangular while the square of the top floors are rectangular
 ek apwaad pehali manzil pe he jahaan ki bich kii ek khidki baaki sabhi khidakiyon se lambii or upar se golakaar he
 Fanlight is above the door
 ghar ke andar satrahavin sadi kaa thodaa bahut plaster kaa kaam kiya hua he
 An electric motor is an electrochemical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy; That is, when it is connected to the appropriate power source, it starts rotating, due to which the machine or machine attached to it also starts rotating
 arthath yah vidyut janitr kaa ulta kaam karti he jo yantric urja lekar vidyut urja paidaa karata he
 Some motors also operate as both motors or generators in different circumstances
 vidyut motor vidyut urja ko yantric urja main parinat karne ke saadhan hai
 Electric motor is an important indicator of industrial progress
 yah ek badi saral tathaa badi upyogi mashin he
 There is hardly any purpose in industries for which an appropriate electric motor cannot be selected
 vidyut motaron kaa mul uddeshy vidyutchumbakeey bal / balaghurna utpann karke stater or roter ke bich aapekshik gati paidaa karnaa he
 In this way, electric motor takes mechanical work by taking electrical energy
 motor kii vinding ke dharawahi chaalkon par lagane vaala lorange bal nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara abhivyakt hota he- The mechanical power generated by the motor is given by the following equation Pem- jahaan shaft kii koniya chaal radian prati second main tathaa t newton-meter main honi chaiye
 For linear motors, jahaan f newton main tathaa veg v meter prati second main hogi
 Power is an ideal staple driver in the motor industries
 adhikansh mashine vidyut motaron dwaara hi chalaai jaati he
 The main reason for this is that the efficiency of electric motors is higher than other drivers
 saath hi uskaa nishpaadan bhi adhiktar unase acha hota he
 Electric motor is also ideal from the point of view of enforcement and control
 motor ko chalaanaa, athwa band karnaa, tathaa chaal ko badalanaa anya chaalkon kii apeksha adhik sugamawa se kiya ja saktaa he
 It can also have remote control
 niyantran kii sugamawa ke kaaran hi vidyut motor itane lokapriy ho gaye hai
 Electric motors can be used for many purposes
 ye kai sau ashwashakti kii badi badi mashine tathaa choti se choti, ashwashakti tak kii, mashine chalaa sakate hai
 Apart from industries, they are also used in agriculture for plowing fields, sowing and cutting machines and for running irrigation pumps
 gharon main prashithan, dhovan, tathaa anya vibhinn kaamon kii mashine bhi inase chalaai jaati hai
 Electric motors are made of different types for different purposes
 inamen saral niyantrak lage rahete hai, jinase anek prakaar kaa kaam liya ja saktaa he
 According to the supply, two types of motor have traditionally been counted as ham ynha sansofhan dekhnege-directhara motor and alternating current motor
 apane vibhyah galat haisirta lakshanon ke anusaar donon hi ke bahut se praroop hote he
 But over time this classification has weakened because Universal Motor A
C
 Can also run from shakti electraniki ke vikaas ne commutator ko ab motaron ke andar se baahar kar diya he
 The second classification of motors is done as synchronous and asynchronous
 yah kuch seemaa tak adhik tarkpurna vargeekaran he
 The rotor of synchronous machines rotates at the same angular speed as the magnetic field produced by the alternating current of that motor
 kintu iske vipareet acincronas motaron kaa roter kuch kam gati se chakkar karata he
 The induction motor is a prime example of this
 kuch pramukh motaren is prakaar hai: DC motors are more useful where speed control is very important
 aisa isaliye hai ki inkaa speed control bahut aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is actually a series DC motor that can be run from both AC and DC
 gharon main upyog main aane vaala mixr kaa motor universal motor hi hota he
 In addition to this, only the motor is used to pull the train engine because its speed is very suitable for this work
 yah motor kam chaal par bahut adhik balaghurna paidaa karata he jabaki chaal badhane par iske dwaara utpann kiya gaya balaghurna kramshah kam hota jaataa he
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fracshnal horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotates the rotor
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 Three phage synchronous motors are of little use
 iskaa ek pramukh upyog shakti gunank ko acha banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It does not start by itself and some additional arrangements have to be made to start running
 kintu sincronas janitr yaa alternetr kaa bahut upyog hota he or duniya kaa adhikansh vidyut shakti altaranetaron ke dwaara hi paidaa kii ja rahi he
 The cost of this motor is not high
 inkaa upyog aajkal tej gati kii railgadiyon main ho rahaa he
 Nowadays they are used a lot for situation control and movement control
 inako aankik nikaayon kii sahaayta se control karnaa bahut aasaan kaary he; jaise ki kisi microcontrolar kii sahaayta se
 Shog motors are very suitable if movement is to be done in a wide range
 bahut se sthanon main disht dhara, shrenee motor kaa prachaalan lakshan vaanchhneeya hota he
 Efforts have also been made to arrange this in alternating current motors
 prayavarti dhara shrenee motor evam dikparivartak motor isi prakaar ke vishisht lakshanon kii vyavastha karte hai
 Synchronous motors can only operate at synchronous speed
 at: jahaan ekasmaanchaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan ye adarsh hote hai
 Just as direct current generator and motor are virtually the same machine and it is possible to use both in any form
 usee prakaar tulykaalik motor bhi, vastut:, prayavarti dhara janitr kaa, jise saamanyat: prayavartitra kehete hai, hi rup he or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Its operation requires both alternating current transmission in its stator and direct current exciter in the rotor
 in motaron kaa prayog kuch simit he
 Like repatriated for direct current stimulation, they also have a stimulant arranged like repatriated for an excitation
 in motaron kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki uttejnaa ko badhaane se shaktigunank bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, especially in industries where the power factor is greatly reduced due to having many induction motors, or due to some other reason, the power factor can be improved by arranging synchronous motors
 bahut se sthanon main to ye motor keval shaktigunank sudhaar ke liye hi prayukt kiye jate hai
 In such case they are called synchronous capacitors
 bahut se sthanon main keval ekakaleey sambharan hi uplabdh hota he
 Unilateral motors are used there
 choti mashiinon tathaa gharelu kaaryon ke liye ekakaleey preran motor bahut lokapriy hai
 Unitary motors are also used in electric wings
 isi prakaar dhavan mashiinon, prashitakon tathaa silaai kii mashiinon ityadi main ekakaleey motor hi pramukh kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty of single-phase motors lies in their starting
 aarambh karne ke liye kisi prakaar kaa kala vipatan aavashyak hota he
 Art splitting is usually done by an auxiliary coil, which has a capacitor placed in the aerapath, which displaces the current of the auxiliary coil about 10 electromagnets from the current of the main coil
 iske kaaran ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti sambhav ho sakati he or motor chalane lagata he
 Operating capacitance of the motor is also improved by having the capacitor in the circuit
 bahut se chote chote motor saarvatrik kism ke hote hai or disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can be used both in direct current and reverse current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara ev prayavarti dhara donon main hi sambhav he, parantu ye atyant chote aakaaron main hi banaae ja sakate hai or keval kuch vishesh prayuktiyon main hi kaam aate hai
 Very small size motors are used in meters and other instruments and where an electric amount is to be measured
 duurastha niyantran, athwa valve ityadi ko kholane ke liye bhi, bahut se chote motor prayukt hote hai
 The upper cover of the motor is made according to different circumstances
 kuch motor khule hue praroop ke hote hai, jinamein unke andar ke bhaag saamne dikhaai padate hai, parantu aise motaron main dhul mitti jane kaa dar rahata he
 Therefore they cannot be used in open spaces
 parantu aise motaron main prakritik sanvathan acha hota he
 Therefore, they do not get heated quickly
 is kaaran aise motor aakaar ke anusaar saapekshatya adhik kshamta ke hote hai
 Where the motor has to operate in open spaces, there may be fear of dust, dirt etc
, so fully covered motors are used
 aise motaron main mukhya kathinaayee sanvathan kii hoti he
 Their casing is also made so that it can expand maximum heat
 saath hi usee isha par aropit ek pankhe kii bhi vyavastha hoti he, jo motor ke andar sanvathan vaayu ko pravesh kar sake or usamen utpann honevaali ooshmaa ko vistarit kar sake
 Semi-enclosed motors are satisfactory for most purposes, in which visible parts of the motor are covered by a lattice
 is prakaar inamen uparyukt donon prarupon ke laabh nihit rahete hai
 Special types of coverings are made for special conditions, such as completely flameless motors are used inside mines or in explosive environments
 isi prakaar kuch motor pani main neeche kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana is prakaar hoti he ki pani motor ke andar na ja sake
 Different types of veils are made in many different circumstances
 bahut si motaron ko bhaar se sidhe hi sambhddha kar diya jaataa he or bahut si avasthaaon main unhen pattee, gear athwa chen dwaara sambhddha kiya jaataa he
 An almost constant speed ratio can be maintained from gears to driver and driven machines, and different moves can also be obtained by changing the gear order
 pattee dwaara shakti ke preshan main mashin ko motor se kaaphi dur bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he or ek saamaanya isha ko bhi chalaaya ja saktaa he, jisase duusari mashine sambhddha hon
 In large factories, this is usually the configuration
 motaron kii kshamta ke liye mukhya parisima taap kii vruddhi he
 There is also the fear of damage due to the increase in heat, and the efficiency of the motor is also reduced due to increase in losses
 is prakaar motor anwarat prachaalan nahin kar saktaa
 Most motors are decelerated to a specific heat surge, which depends on the class of the insulator
 bahut se motor "santat kshamta" ke hote hai, jiskaa taatpary he ki vah nirdhaarit bhaar, bina taap ke vishisht seemaa tak bade, nirantar sambharan kar sakate hai
 Many motors operate at full load only for a short period of time and the rest of the time they are at low load or remain closed

 maharishi bhrigu kaa janm 5000 isa purv brahmalok-susha nagar main hua tha
 His great-grandfather's name was Marichi Rishi
 dadaji kaa naam kashyap rishi, daadi kaa naam aditi tha
 His father pracheta-vidhata who became Prajapita Brahma after becoming king of Brahmaloka
 apane mata-pita aditi-kashyap ke jyeshtha putr the
 Maharishi Bhriguji's mother's name was Veerani Devi
 ye apane mata-pita se sahodar do bhai the
 Your elder brother's name was Angira Rishi
 jinke putr brihaspatiji hue jo devganon ke purohit-devguru ke rup main jane jate hai
 Maharishi Bhrigu started the Dadri Mela in honor of his disciple Dardar with the preservation and sacrificial tradition of the river Ganges on the occasion of the inauguration of the astrological treatise 'bhrigu Samhita' composed by Maharishi Bhrigu and the confluence of Ganga Sarayu rivers
 maharishi bhrigu kii do patniyon kaa ullekh aarsh granthon main miltaa he
 His first wife was Divya, the daughter of Hiranyakashyap, the ruler of the demons
 jinase aapke do putron kramshah kavy-shukr or twashta-vishwakarma kaa janm hua
 Both sons of Maharishi Bhrigu, born in Sushanagar, were rich in prodigious talent
 bade putr kavy-shukr khagol jyotish, yajna karmkandon ke nishnaat vidwaan hue
 You got the title of Acharya in Matrikul
 ye jagat main shukracharya ke naam se vikhyath hue
 The second son, tvashta-vishwakarma was an accomplished architect of Vastu
 maatrikul daityavansh main aapako ‘may’ ke naam se janaa gaya
 He was also well known for his mastery of craftsmanship
 maharishi bhrigu kii duusari patni daanvon ke adhipati pulom rishi kii putree paulami thi
 They also bore two sons, Chyavan and Ritchik
 bade putr chyavan kaa vivaah muniver ne gujarat bhadaunch ke raja sharyaati kii putree sukanya se kiya
 With the marriage of Bhargava Chyavan and Sukanya, Bhargavas made their southern debut in the Himalayas
 chyavan rishi khambhat kii khadi ke raja bane or is kshetra ko bhrigukachha-bhrigu kshetra ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Even today, Bhrigu temple is built on the banks of Narmada in Bharoch
 maharishi bhrigu ne apane duusare putr richik kaa vivaah kanyakubjpati kowshik raja gadhi kii putree satyavati ke saath ek hajaar shyamakarna ghode dahej main dekar kiya
 Now Bhargava Ritchik also came to Gadhipuri, South of Himalayas
 maharishi bhrigu ke is vimukt kshetra main aane ke kai kathanak aarsh granthon main milte hai
 According to mythological, historical accounts, brahma-pracheta son Bhrigu was engendering the ethnics of Gandharva, the Yaksha castes of the north of the Himalayas, by establishing matrimonial relations with the Himalayan south demons, demons and kings of human beings
 jisase sabhi log devon ke sangrakshak, brahmaji ke sabase chote bhai vishnu ko dosha de rahe the
 The dominance of the Bhargavas was increasing in the second twelve Adityas
 isi bich maharishi bhrigu ke shvasur daityaraj hiranyakashyap ne himalay ke uttar ke rajyon par chadhaai kar diya
 Due to which there was a dispute in Maharishi Bhrigu's family
 maharishi bhrigu yah kah kar ki rajya seemaa kaa vistaar karnaa raja kaa dharm he, apane shvasur kaa paksh le rahe the
 In this dispute, Vishnu killed his first wife, Divya Devi, the daughter of Hiranyakashyap
 jisase krodhit hokar maharishi bhrigu ne shri vishnu ji ko ek laat maar diya
 The dispute was settled by Maharishi Bhrigu's great-grandfather and Vishnu ji's grandfather Marichi Muni with the decision that Bhrigu should go south of the Himalayas
 unke divya devi se utpann putron ko sammaan sahit paalan-poshan kii jimmedaari devgan uthaayenge
 In order to protect the dignity and dignity of the family, Bhrigu ji also received orders that he would not criticize Shri Hari Vishnu
 is prakaar maharishi bhrigu sushanagar se apni duusari patni paulami ko saath lekar apane chote putr richik ke paas gadhipuri aa gayi
 The second story of Maharishi Bhrigu coming to this region is found in some religious texts, Puranas
 devi bhagwat ke chaturth skandh vishnu puraana, agni puraana, shrimadbhagwat main khandon main bikhare varnanon ke anusaar maharishi bhrigu prachetha-brahma ke putr hai, inkaa vivaah daksh prajapati kii putree khyaati se hua tha
 From whom his two sons kavya-venus and Tvashta and a daughter 'sri' Lakshmi were born
 inaki putree ‘shri’ kaa vivaah shri hari vishnu se hua
 In the Devasur struggle with the demons, Maharishi Bhrigu's wife Khyati, who was a stunning woman with full power
 daityon kii sena ke mritak sainikon ko vah apane yogabal se jivit kar detii thi
 Enraged, Shrihari Vishnu cut the head of Shukracharya's mother, Bhriguji's wife Khyati, from his Sudarshan Chakra
 apni patni kii hatya hone kii jaankaree hone par maharishi bhrigu bhagwaan vishnu ko shaap dete hai ki tumhen stri ke pet se baar-baar janm lenaa padegaa
 After that Maharishi resurrects his wife Khyati with his yogic power and comes to the banks of the Ganges, creating the Tamsa River
 padam puraana ke upsanhaar khand kii katha ke anusaar mandarachal parvat ho rahe yajna main rishi-muniyon main is baat par vivaad chhid gaya ki tridevon main shreshth dev koun he?devon kii pariksha ke liye rishi-muniyon ne maharishi bhrigu ko pareekshak niyukt kiya
 Maharishi Bhrigu first reached Kailash of Lord Shankar at the time of taking the examination of the trinity
 At that time Lord Shankar was doing Vihara with his wife Sati
 nandi aadi rudraganon ne maharishi ko pravesh dwaar par hi roak diya
 The Rudras also humiliated the Maharshi by his stubbornness to meet Lord Shankar
 kupit maharishi bhrigu ne bhagwaan shankar ko tamoguni ghoshit karte hue ling main poojit hone kaa shaap diya
 From here Maharishi Bhrigu reached Brahmaloka Brahma
 brahmaji apane darbar main viraaj rahe the
 All the gods were sitting in front of him
 bhrigu ji ko brahmaji ne baithne tak ko nahin kahe
 Then Maharishi Bhrigu declared Brahma as Rajoguni and cursed him to be invincible
 kailash or brahmalok main mili apmaan-tiraskaar se kshubhit maharishi vishnulok chal diye
 Lord Srihari Vishnu was staying in the Ksheer Sagar with his wife lakshmi-shree on a beautiful beautiful boat
 us samay shri vishnu ji shayan kar rahe the
 Maharishi Bhriguji felt that seeing us coming, Vishnu is pretending to sleep
 unhone apane daahine pair kaa aghat shri vishnu ji kii chaati par kar diya
 Vishnupriya Lakshmi, who was pressing the feet of Srihari, was enraged at this rude behavior of Maharishi
 lekin vishnu ji ne maharishi kaa pair pakad liya or kaha bhagwan ! mere kathor vaksh se aapke komal charan main chot to nahin lagi
 Maharishi Bhrigu was ashamed and also pleased, he declared Srihari Vishnu as the best Satoguni among the trinity
 tridevon kii is pariksha main jahaan ek bahut badi sikh chhipi he
 a huge diplomacy was also hidden there
 is ghatana se ek lokokti bani
 Forgiveness is the need for suffering kaa hari ko ghatyo gaye, jyon bhrigu maari laat
 
 is ghatana main kootneeti yah thi ki himalay ke uttar ke nrivanshon kaa sanghathan banaakar rahane se shri hari vishnu ke netritv main sabhi jatiyaan sabhy, susanskrit ban unnati kar rahi thi
 The ethnical community of the south of the Himalayas, which were known by the names of demon-demon, marut-rudra, etc
 parishramee hone ke baad bhi asangathit, asabhy jivan ji rahi thi
 These castes considered Rudra Shankar as their hero-god
 unki hi puja karti thi
 Maharishi Bhrigu was the most suitable medium to enshrine the Devakula hero Srivishnu in the south of the Himalayas
 unki ek patni daityakul se thi, to duusari daanav kul se thi or unke putron shukraachaaryon, twashta-may-vishwakarma tathaa bhrigukachha main chyavan tathaa gadhipuri main richik kaa bahut maan-sammaan tha
 After this Tridev examination, the reputation of Srihari Vishnu began to be established in the south of Himalayas
 vishesh rup se raajaaon ke abhishek main shri vishnu kaa naam lenaa himalay parsy devon kii krupa prapti or manyata milanaa mana jane laga
 According to the legend mentioned in the Puranas, Maharishi Bhrigu, who attacked Vishnu's chest in the examination of the three gods, was punished by the sage Dandacharya Marichi
 jiske liye bhriguji ko ek sookhe baans kii chadi main konpale foot pade or aapke qamar se mrigchaal prithvi par gir pade
 You will chant the name Vishnu Sahastra then you will have redemption of this sin
 mandarachal se chalate hue jab maharishi bhrigu vimukt kshetra ke ganga tat par pahunche to unki mrigchaal gir padi or chadi main konpale foot padi
 Where he started doing penance
 kaalaantar main yah bhu-bhaag maharishi ke naam se bhrigukshetra kaha jane laga
 My direct intention is that readers can use their discretion to throw light on all the historical, mythological and religious aspects related to Maharishi Bhrigu life
 hamaare dharmik granthon main hamaare manishiyon ke varnan to prachur he, parantu usee prachurtaa se usamen kalpit ghatnaon ko bhi joda gaya he
 In order to glorify their lives, our Patividvans have played with their historicity, due to which a number of humiliating situations arise at the global level
 maharishi bhrigu ne is bhu-bhaag par aane ke baad yahan ke jangalon ko saaf karaayaa
 Here only the people living on the shelves of animals were taught to do farming
 yahan gurukul kii sthapana karke logon ko padhanaa-likhnaa sikhaaya
 In that period, this land was considered to be the abode of cannibal humans
 unhen sabhy, susanskrit maanav banaanen kaa kaary maharishi dwaara kiya gaya
 Those unfamiliar with the family life of Maharishi Bhrigu also know about Bhrigu Samhita, the great book of astrology-astronomy published by Maharishi
 is naam se anek pustake aaj bhi sahitya vikritaon ke yaha bikati hui dikhaai detii he
 Maharishi had composed the Bhrigu Samhita Granth in his long-term residence Karma Bhumi-free Bhumi Ballia
 is sandarbh do baaten dhyaan dene kii he
 The first thing is that during his time in his native land Brahmalok, his life was full of trouble
 apni patni divya devi kii mrityu se vyathit or tridevon kii pariksha ke uparant janm bhoomi se nishkasit maharishi ko usee samay shaanti se jivan vyateet karne kaa avasar mila jab vah vimukt bhoomi main aaye
 By the time Bhrigukchha arrived in Gujarat, his fame had spread all around
 kyonki us samay tak unke bhrigu samhita ko bhi prasiddhi mil chuki thi or unke shishy darder dwaara bhrigukshtra main ganga-sarayu ke sangam karaane kii baat bhi puraa aryavart jaan chukaa tha
 According to the legend, the Maharishi was greeted by royalty upon his arrival in the Gulf of Khambhat, and the Vedic scholar Brahmins, while reciting him, praised him as the luminous priest of astrological astrology
 jisase yah baat pramanit hoti he ki maharishi dwaara bhrigu samhita kii rachana sushanagar se nishkasana ke baad or gujarat ke bhrigukachha jane se rpurv kii gai thi
 The result of three births of any person can be extracted by this Samhita of Maharishi
 is brahmand ko niyantrit karne vaale surya, chandramaa, mangal, buddha, brihaspati,shukr shani aadi grahon or nakshatron par aadhaarit vaidic ganit ke is vaigyanik granth ke madhyam se jivan or krishi ke liye varsha aadi kii bhi bhavishyavaaniyan kii jaati thi
 Paper and printing facilities were not available in Maharishi's period
 richaon ko kanthsth karaayaa jaataa tha or isaki vyavhaarik jaankaree shalakaon ke madhyam se shishyon ko di jaati thi
 Later, when the method of writing developed and its resources like bhojpatra tadpatra etc
 developed, some scholars did the work of writing these verses

 shabdkosh nirmaan se sambandhit sakal kaaryon kaa samucchy koshkarm yaa koshavidya kehalaati he
 It is difficult to create sections or sections of dictionaries in terms of subjects
 alag alag koshkar apni samaj ke anusaar is prakaar ke vishayvibhag banaaya karte the
 There was neither any fixed order nor could it happen
 isaliye logon ko praaia: sara kosh kanthsth karnaa padataa tha
 For this reason, dictionaries in Western countries started being made alphabetically
 aise kosh ratane nahin padate the or aavashyaktaanusaar jab jiskaa ji chahta tha, tab vah uskaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 Nowadays, in almost all countries and all languages, this sequence is being used in the field of thesaurus: which is the most important in terms of the curious
 isi liye kosh ke jitne prakaar hote hai, un sab main praaia: aksharkram kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are many types of thesaurus, but considering the meaning, they can be divided into two parts
 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then they should be taken as much fraction as possible to clarify the intention and resolve the curious
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the task of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he
 It also shows the subtle differences of similar resemblances to them under several words, such as - subtle differences of dread, frit, alarms, disme, terrer and panic are also mentioned under the fear
 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately
 went
 yadi bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon main bhi inkaa anukaran kiya jaay to kai drushtiyon se bahut acha hoga
