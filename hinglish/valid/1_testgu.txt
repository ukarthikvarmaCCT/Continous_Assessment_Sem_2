san 1901-2 main macclang naamak vidvan ne chromosome kaa pataa lagaaya
 He also made some theories, which were later confirmed by scientific research
 is siddhant main yah mana jaataa he ki prayek praani ke kuch vishisht chromosomon kii sankhya par uskaa ling nirbhar karata he
 If the composition of chromosomes is seen by a more powerful microscope, such as an electron microscope, then some very microscopic compositions will be seen in it
 inako jin kaha jaataa he or yah vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki ye hi janak ke anuvanshik gunon ko unki santanon tak pahunchaate hai
 There has been much research and experimentation regarding chromosomes and genes of animals and plants
 yah paaya gaya he ki prayek praani kii janan koshikaon main paae janevaale chromosomon main kuch aise hote hai, jinhen alingsutra kehete hai
 They are of a type in both male and female and always live in pairs
 kuch duusare prakaar ke chromosome bhi paae jate hai, jinhen ling nirdharak kaha jaataa he
 The number of chromosomes found so far has been termed as X, Y, W, z and O
 mana jaataa he ki nar tathaa maadaa kaa nirdhaaran inhen linganirdharak chromosomon kii sam tathaa visham sankhya dwaara hota he, jaise manushyon main ling kaa nirdhaaran is prakaar hota he : 21 Alling formula + 1 x + 1 y = male; And 21 aling sutara + 2 eks = stri
 According to the number of chromosomes, the male and female are called heterozygous or homozygous
 kisi praani main nar samayugmaki hoti he, to kisi main maadaa
 Birds, butterflies, fishes, aquatics etc
 have a female heterozygous
 in praaniyon main linganirdharak chromosomon ko zed tathaa dablyoo naam diya jaataa he, jabaki anya praaniyon tathaa vanaspatiyon main inhen eks tathaa vaai ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 In many beings, x and y determine the sex of male or female
 jab eks vaala shukranu maadaa ke andey se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko do eks eks milte hai or vah maadaa banataa he
 But when the y of the sperm is combined with the x of the egg of the female, the zygote receives x y, ie an odd number and is male
 manushyon tathaa anya praaniyon ke nar tathaa maadaa ke chromosomon main jo vibhed paaya jaataa he, vah agle prishth kii sarini main dikhaaya gaya he
 Just as chromosomes have been studied in animals, they have also been studied in flora
 adhiktar beej vaale paudhe ubhayalingashrayi hote hai, arthath unamem nar tathaa maadaa ling ek saath hote hai
 Even when chromosomes are counted, gender is only discussed in the context of male-female analysis, because the problem of gender and heredity is not in the botanical world
 kuch jati main nar tathaa maadaa paudhe pruthak hote hai
 x and y chromosomes of such plants have also been detected, such as Ilodia canadensis, Milandrium album etc
 bijwala ek paudha, fregariya ilatior, chidiyon kii bhanti chromosome vaala batalaaya jaataa he
 In some other plants, the male bears two Ys and one x in spite of being heterosexual
 hraas vibhaajan ke samay donon vaai tathaa eks pruthak ho jate hai or do vaai janan koshika se milakar nar tathaa ek eks maadaa bhrun ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Similarly, sex is also determined in other plants
 praaniyon ke sharir main kuch aisi granthiyaan hoti hai jinhen vahinihin yaa ant:sravi kaha jaataa he
 The secretions of these glands, called hormones, have been studied in some developed, especially vertebrate animals
 vanaspatiyon main bhi hormone hote hai yaa nahin, yah vivadagrast vishay he
 Names of glands found in the body of animals are: pituitary, pineal, thyroid gland, parathyroid, thymus, pacius or pancreas, kidney; Gonads, testes in males and ovaries in females
 in grathiyon se nikalne vaale hormonon kaa adhyayan vistaar se kiya gaya he or yah paaya gaya he ki nar praani main purushatv or maadaa main stritv sambandhit gaun langik lakshanon kaa astitv inhen kii kriya par nirbhar karata he
 Genes and chromosomes only determine whether the zygote will be male or female
 vaastavik purushatv or stritv kaa nirdhaaran tathaa uchit disha main unka vikaas vahinihin grathiyon ke sraavon kii sahaayta se hi hota he
 For example, if an embryo is born as a male, then by either dipping the female hormones or castrating it and implanting the ovary glands in its place, it will either become fully female, or develop symptoms of femininity
 
 xxrep 4 = Name - male-female kachua -- eks eks -- eks o Pigeon — x x, or z z — x o, or z w chamagadad -- eks o -- eks eks Rat - x y - x x choupaae -- eks o -- eks eks Sheep - x y - x x chimpaji -- eks vaai -- eks eks Shrimp, oil shank, grasshopper - x o, or x y - x x sanda -- eks eks -- eks o Rooster - x x, or z z - x o or z w khargosh -- eks vaai, yaa eks o -- eks eks Dog - x y - x x bhens -- eks vaai -- eks eks Horse - x y - x x bandar—eks vaai -- eks eks Drosophila - x y - x x vanaspatiyon tathaa jantuon kaa samuchit adhyayan karne par yah paaya gaya he ki ling kaa nirdhaaran nar or maadaa pravritiyon kaa hi ekmaatr parinaam nahin hota
 Male and female determinants are equally developed along with fetal development
 koi praani nar yaa maadaa keval isliye nahin ho jaataa ki uski rachana vishesh sankhya vaale chromosomon dwaara hui hoti he, apitu vah nar yaa maadaa isliye bhi ho jaataa he ki usne maadaa yaa nar nirdharak anya tatwon ko "dabaa" diya
 All hormones are produced in the body, so when the hormones that determine the femininity, or masculinity, are more powerful, then the fetus will move towards the female, or male body and tendencies
 hormonon ke santulan kaa hi yah parinaam hota he ki praani nar yaa maadaa ke rup main janm letaa he
 Kurt Stern has shown that if a woman has three x in place of two X, then she will have more femininity
 kintu aisi stri der main rituvati, atyadhik alpaayu or sarvatha vandhya hogi
 Similarly, Goldschmidt studies a moth named Limatria japonica, stating that 50% of normal males and 50% of endemic females are produced when strong males are conjugated to weak insects
 kintu jab atyadhik shashakt naron kaa nirbal maadaaon se sanyog hota he tab 100% nar keet utpann hote hai

 Cryu also states that the sex of a fetus is determined not only by chromosomes, but also by the interactions of the genes found in them and the genes found in the alingots, such as birds having female heterosexual XY and male homosexual XX
 
 kiton main langik vibhaajan janan grathiyon par nirbhar nahin karata
 Their main demographic characteristics are: male x O, or x Y; Female x x
 phincolor ne san 1923 main kuch nar kiton ke mastak katkar maadaaon par tathaa maadaaon ke mastak naron par laga die
 In these experiments it was found that the insects acted not according to their body but according to the forehead, ie females with male cephalices exhibited sexual traits like males and female cephalic males
 bahut se jantuon ke nar or maadaa ke aakaar evam swaroop main spasht antar hota he
 This is called sexual dimorphism

 As soon as we move towards the higher class, it will be found that the sexes are clearly separated and the composition of male and female body is also different
 langik dvirupata kaa parichit udhaaharan bonelia viridis naamak ek samudri krimi he
 Its female is green and plum-like in shape

 While waving his bifurcated shund out there, this creature keeps looking for food
 nar krimi atyant sookshm hota he or jananaangon ke atirikt iske anya sabhi angon kaa hraas ho gaya hota he
 The male worm remains like a philanthropist inside the female's body
 nishechit andashay viksit hokar jal main swatantra rup se tairte hue larva kii bhanti hote hai
 If a larva sits on the seabed, or is unable to reach a female's trough, it develops into a female
 kintu yadi kisi prakaar vah maadaa ke shund main aakarshit hokar pahunch jaataa he, to vah nar ke rup main viksit hota he
 The dwarf male, captive in the female's furrow, fertilizes the ovum, reaching it into the female's reproductive tube by sliding it into the mouth and slowly sliding down from there
 nishechit andashay pun: jal main tyaag die jate hai or swatantra rup se larva kii bhanti tairne lag jate hai
 Similarly, a parasitic crustacea called Sacculina remains dependent on male and female crabs
 giyard tathaa smith ne likhaa he ki is crusteshia kaa sharir kekade ke udar main palata he or kuch bhaag sharir bhedakar baahar bhi nikal aata he
 The crab whose body it penetrates in, suckles its genitals
 iske kaaran vah vandhya ho jaataa he
 Most crabs die, some males become female with female traits, or female crabs become intracellular and produce both testes and ovaries
 ling sahalagnta kaa arth he, langik chromosomon main paae janevaale jeenon ke anusaar lingon main vibhinnata
 The traits or traits that depend on these genes are called gender linkages

 If a man is contaminated with a genetic defect, only his sons can inherit that defect, not daughters
 sarvapratham doncaster ne san 1908 main is vishay par prakaash daalaa tha
 He coincided with the female of a moth Abraxas lacticlar to the male of Abraxas grossulariata
 parinamswaroop pratham peedi main sabhi shalab grossulariata varg ke keet paae gaye
 In the second generation, the ratio of Grossulariata and Lacticlar was 3: 1, but all Lacticlar females were found to be female
 isse pataa chalaa ki is praani main nar ek prakaar ke yugmak utpann karata he, kintu maadaa do prakaar ke
 Hence male is homozygous and female is heterozygous
 bravell kehete hai ki eks chromosome main kuch anya prakaar ke anuvanshik kaarak tathaa jin hote hai
 If this theory is correct, then the parents of Samyuktmji parents will move to their heterozygous offspring
 is siddhant ko ling sahalagnta kaha jaataa he, jaise falmakkhi droesophila kii maadaa main do eks tathaa nar main eks vaai chromosome paae jate hai
 Its x chromosomes will have genes from red eyes, or white eyes

 In this process, the chromosomes of the sperm and the chromosomes of the egg continue to split together
 udhaaharan ke liye, purush ke 23 tathaa stri ke 23 chromosome milakar 46 chromosome ho jate he
 At the time of division 23 chromosomes move towards one end and 23 on the other side
 in donon chhoron ko putreekoshika cendrak bhi kehete hai
 Many types of defects can occur in this normal process of division such as 22 chromosomes are left in one center and 24 in the other, or if any other accident happens, it will be called aviation

 purushatv tathaa stritv kii disha main kisi praani kaa vikaas kis aadhaar par hota he, is sambandh main sabhi vaigyanik ek mat nahin hai
 Why there is a difference in the number of chromosomes at the time of cell division, or why one of the Wolfie and Miliary vessels is depleted at the time of sex, or by a rule, or quantity, of the masculinity or femininity, why and how Are secreted? Scientists have not been able to give any satisfactory answer to all these questions yet
 at: ham yah maan lenge ki stri yaa purush hona nire sanyog kii baat he
 Each creature has the ability to develop into a male, or female
 ubhalingta iskaa jwalanth udhaaharan he
 There are many types of hermaphroditic, such as animals that self-fertilize, such as hydra, laceworm, flatworm, etc
 There are other animals that depend on each other for fertilization; Such as earthworms, leeches, etc

 Medievalism - This is the situation when a creature is developing towards one sex and suddenly, due to some reason, also takes on the other sex
 manushyon main hijadon kii yahi avasthaa hoti he
 According to genetic science, the reason for such a condition is the presence of three X, or two x chromosomes with a somatic chromosome group
 
 Due to this ratio, the outer shape of flies is a mixture of male and female, although male and female tissues are not found in their body due to reproduction

 dengue bukaar ek sankraman he jo dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 It is very important to treat dengue on time
 Mosquitoes transmit dengue virus
 dengue bukaar ko "hadditod bukaar" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, kyonki isse peedit logon ko itnaa adhik dard ho saktaa he ki jaise unki haddiyaan tut gayi hon
 Some symptoms of dengue fever include fever; Headache; Skin rashes such as rash and muscle and joint pain are included
 kuch logon main, dengue bukaar ek yaa do aise roopon main ho saktaa he jo jivan ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 First, dengue is hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding or leakage in blood vessels, and low levels of blood platelets
 doosraa dengue shock syndrome he, jisase khatarnaak rup se nimna raktchaap hota he
 There are four different types of dengue virus
 yadi kisi vyakti ko inamen se kisi ek prakaar ke virus kaa sankraman ho jaye to aamtaur par uske puure jivan main vah us prakaar ke dengue virus se surakshit rahata he
 However, with the remaining three types, he remains safe for some time
 yadi usko in teen main se kisi ek prakaar ke virus se sankraman ho to use gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi adhik hoti he
 There is no vaccine available to protect people from dengue virus
 dengue bukaar se logon ko bachaane ke liye kuch upaay hai, jo kiye jane chaiye
 People can protect themselves from mosquitoes and limit the number of bites from them
 vaigyanik machharon ke panpane kii jagahon ko chota tathaa kam karne ko kehete hai
 If someone has dengue fever, he can usually be cured by drinking enough liquid until his illness is reduced or limited
 yadi vyakti kii sthiti adhik gambhir he to, use antah shira dravya yaa rakt aadhaan kii jarurat ho sakati he
 Since 1960, many people are suffering from dengue fever
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se yah beemaari ek vishwavyaapee samasya ho gayi he
 It is common in 110 countries
 prayek varsh lagbhag 50-100 million log dengue bukaar se peedit hote hai
 People are working on vaccines and medicines to directly treat the virus
 machharon se mukti paane ke liye log, kai saare alag-alag upaay bhi karte hai
 The first description of dengue fever was written in 1779
 20veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main vaigyanikon ne yah janaa ki beemaari dengue virus ke kaaran hoti he tathaa yah machharon ke madhyam se sancharit hoti he
 Dengue was first written many years ago
 jin samrajya ke ek chini chikitsa vishwakosh ek aise vyakti kii baat karata he jise sambhawatah dengue hua tha
 The book tells of a "water poison" disease that was related to flying insects
 17 veen shatabdi ke likhit dastauez bhi ek aisi mahamari kii charchaa karte hai jo dengue ho sakati he 
 The earliest reports of the most likely dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780
 ye report ek aisi mahamari kii baat karti hai jisane asia, africa tathaa uttari america ko apane ghere main le liya tha
 Not many pandemics occurred from that time until 1940
 1906 main vaigyanikon ne siddh kiya ki logon ko "adies" machharon se sankraman ho rahaa tha
 In 1907, scientists showed that viruses are the cause of dengue
 yah maatr doosraa rog tha jise virus se hota dikhaaya gaya tha 
 John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler continued to study dengue virus and found out the basis of the virus's expansion
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad dengue adhik teji se failane laga
 The war is believed to have changed the environment in many ways
 bhinn prakaar ke dengue naye kshetron main faile
 People started having hemorrhagic dengue fever for the first time
 degu kaa yah bheeshan prakaar sabase pehle 1953 main philippines main report kiya gaya
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever became the leading cause of death in children in the 1970s
 yah prashanth kshetra tathaa america main bhi hone laga
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central and South America in 1981
 is samay swasthya seva peshewaron ne yah dekha ki jin logon ko tip 1 dengue virus kaa asar ho chukaa tha unako kuch varshon ke baad tip 2 dengue virus kaa asar ho rahaa tha
 It is not clear where the word "dengue" came from
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah shabd swahili ke vaakyansh kaa-dinga pepo se aayaa he
 This phrase refers to the disease caused by evil spirits
 mana jaataa he ki swahili shabd dinga spani ke shabd dengue se bana he
 The word means "careful"
 vah shabd ek aise vyakti ke bare main bataane ke liye upyog kiya gaya ho saktaa he jo dengue bukhaar ke haddi ke dard se peedit ho; vah dard us vyakti ko saavdhaanee ke saath chalane par majaboor karata hoga
 However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili language, not as mentioned above
 anya logon kaa maananaa he ki "dengue" naam west indies se aayaa he
 In the West Indies, dengue-afflicted slaves were called standing and walking like "a dandy", and for this reason the disease was also called "dandy fever"
 "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam sabase pehle ek chikitsak sanyukt rajya amareeki "sansthaapak janak" benjamin rash dwaara upyog kiya gaya tha
 In 1789 Rush used the name "bone-breaking fever" in a report on the outbreak of dengue in 1780 in Philadelphia
 report main rash ne adhik aupchaarik naam "billiyas remitting fever" kaa adhiktar upyog kiya
 The term "dengue fever" was not generally in use until 1828
 iske pehle rog ke liye bhinn log bhinn naam upyog karte the
 For example, dengue was also called "breakheart fever" and "la dengue"
 jatil dengue ke liye kai naam upyog kiye jate the: udhaaharan ke liye "infectios thrombokytopanic parpura", "philipine", "thai" tathaa "singapore hemoragic fever"
 The first pandemic attack of Dangu occurred simultaneously in Asia, Africa, North America, around 1780, the disease was recognized and named in 1779
 1950 ke dashak me yah dakshin purv asia yah nirantar mahamari rup me failana shuru hua tathaa 1975 tak dengue hemarej fever in deshon me bal mrityu kaa pradhan kaaran ban gaya he
 By the 1990s, dengue became the second largest disease spread by mosquitoes after malaria, infecting 40 million people a year, while thousands of cases of dengue haemorrhage also occur
 farvari 2002 me hi jab rio-di-genero me dengue ke prasar hua to 10 lakh log isaki chapet me aa gayi the jisase 16 log mar gayi
 Till March 2008, the condition was not very good in this city, there were 23,555 cases and 30 deaths in only 3 months
 lagbhag har paanch se chah saal me dengue kaa bada prakope hota he aisa is liye hota he ki vaarshik chakra jo is rog ke aate he wo rogiyon ko kuch samay hetu pratirodh kshamta de detaa he jaise ki chikangunia ke maamalon me hota he
 When this resistance ceases, people become susceptible to the disease again, then there are four types of dengue viruses, besides new ones are added to the population by birth or migration
 is baat ke paryaapt pramaan he es
bi
helstid ne ek adhyayan dwaara siddh kar diya he ki dengue hamerej fever un rogiyon ko zyada hota he jo dwitiyak sankraman se grast hue ho jo ki praathmik sankraman se bhinn prakaar ke virus se hota he
 Although this notion has not been properly understood, there are only a few models that express their views about it, this condition is called the condition of transitivity
 singapore me prativarsh is rog ke 4000-5000 maamle saamne aate he yadhpi aam dharna yah he ki bahut se maamle chupe rah jate he
 Dengue symptoms About 80% of people infected with dengue virus have no symptoms or very mild symptoms
 sankramit logon main se lagbhag 5% log gambhir rup se biimaar padate hai
 In a small number of these people, the disease is life-threatening
 dengue virus se peedit hone ke 3 se 14 dinon ke baad kisi vyakti main lakshan dikhte hai
 Symptoms often appear only after 4 to 7 days
 is tarah yadi koi vyakti aise kshetra se lautataa he jahaan dengue aam he or uske lautne ke 14 din yaa uske baad usko bukaar hota he yaa anya lakshan dikhte hai to shaayad usko dengue nahin he
 Often when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are common cold (cold or gastroenteritis)
 halanki, bacchon main dengue bukaar dwaara gambhir samasyaayein hone kii adhik sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 The ideal symptoms of dengue fever are less which start suddenly like headache; Rashes and muscle and joint pain
 beemaari kaa upnaam "hadditod bukaar" yah darshata he ki yah dard kitna gambhir ho saktaa he
 Dengue fever three stages bukaar sambandhi charan main, kisi vyakti ko aamtaur par ucch bukaar hota he
 Fever is often 40 ° C
 vyakti ko saamaanya dard tathaa sirdard ho saktaa he
 This phase usually lasts 2 to 7 days
 is charan main jin logon main lakshan hote hai unamem se lagbhag 50 se 80% logon ko chakatte ho jate hai
 On the first or second day, the rash may look like red skin
 beemaari ke baad ke dinon main chakatte chechak jaise lag sakate hai
 Small red spots may emerge on the skin
 twachaa ko dabaane par yah daag hatate nahin hai
 These red stains are formed due to broken capillaries
 vyakti ko shleshm jhilli dwaara munh tathaa naak se halkaa raktasrav ho saktaa he
 Fever starts decreasing on its own and returns for a day or two
 halanki, bhinn logon main yah pattern bhinn hota he
 In some people, the disease enters a critical stage after high fever
 gambhir charan ek se do dinon tak chalata he
 During this phase, fluid can build up in the chest and abdomen, because there is a leakage in the blood vessels
 taral banataa he tathaa yah puure sharir main parisancharit hota he
 This means that vital organs do not usually receive blood as per their requirement
 is kaaran se, ang saamaanya tareeke se kaam nahin kar pate hai
 The person may also have excessive bleeding
 dengue se peedit 5% se kam vyaktiyon ko parisancharan aghat, dengue aghat syndrome tathaa dengue rakthasravi bukaar hota he
 If a person has had any other type of dengue before, then he is more likely to have such serious problems
 sudhaar charan main, vah taral jo rakt nalikaaon se baahar ris jaataa he, raktapravaah main waapas shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 The correction phase lasts 2 to 3 days
 vyakti aksar is charan ke dauraan kaaphi behatar ho jaataa he
 However, they may complain of severe itching and slow heart rate
 is charan ke dauraan, vyakti taral overlod sthiti main ja saktaa he
 If it affects the brain, it can cause a change in the level of consciousness or a condition like seizures
 kabhi-kabhaar dengue hamaare sharir ke anya tantron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 a person may have only symptoms or may even have ideal dengue symptoms
 0
5–6% maamalon main chetana kaa str ghat saktaa hai
 This can happen when the dengue virus causes brain infection
 aisa tab bhi ho saktaa he jab mahatvapurn ang sahi bhang se kaam na kar rahe hon
 Other nervous disorders have been reported in people who have dengue fever
 udhaaharan ke liye, dengue transwars militis tathaa guilian-bare syndrome paidaa kar saktaa he
 Although this is not nearly the case, dengue can cause heart infection and severe liver failure
 dengue bukhaar dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 The scientific system in which the virus is classified and named includes the dengue virus as part of the "flaviviridae" family and the "flavivirus" gene
 anya virus bhi is parivaar se sambandhit hai tathaa maanvon main bimaariyaan paidaa kar sakate hai
 For example, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St
 Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kaysanur jungle disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever, all belong to the "flaviviridae" family
 
 inamen se adhiktar virus machharon yaa tik dwaara failte hai
 Dengue virus is mostly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti type mosquitoes
 ye machhar aamtaur par 350 uttar tathaa 350 dakshin akshans par, 1000 meter se kam oonchai par hote hai
 They are mostly cut during the day
 inke ek baar kaatane se bhi maanav sankramit ho saktaa he
 Sometimes mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans
 yadi maadaa machhar kisi sankramit vyakti ko kaat le to machhar ko dengue virus mil saktaa he
 First the virus resides in the cells that are in the stomach of the mosquito
 lagbhag 8 se 10 dinon ke baad virus, machhar kii laar granthiyaan jo laar banaati hai, unamem sankramit ho jate hai
 This means that the saliva made by the mosquito is infected with the dengue virus
 isaliye jab machhar maanav ko katate hai to inaki sankramit laar maanav ko sankramit kar sakati he
 Viruses do not appear to cause any problems for infected mosquitoes, which will remain infected throughout their life
 is baat kii sambhaavna sabase adhik hoti he ki adies aegypti machhar dengue failaata he
 This is because they live closest to humans and live on humans rather than animals
 yah maanav-nirmit pani rakhane ke paatro main andey dena pasand karte hai
 Dengue can spread through infected blood products and organ donation
 yadi dengue se sankramit vyakti rakt daan yaa ang daan karata he, jo kisi anya vyakti ko diya jaataa he, is vyakti ko daan diye gayi rakt yaa ang se dengue ho saktaa he
 Dengue is common in some countries such as Singapore
 in deshon main, 10,000 rakt aadhanon main se 1
6 se 6 tak dengue failaate hai
 Dengue virus can also spread from mother to child during pregnancy or while giving birth to a child
 dengue aamtaur par kinhi or tareekon se nahin failata he
 Infants and children are more likely to develop the disease severity than adults with dengue
 bachche yadi acchhee tarah se poshit hon to unke gambhir rup se biimaar hone kii adhik sambhaavna he 
 Men are more prone to serious illness than women
 puraani kii bimaariyaan jaise madhumeh tathaa asthma vaale logon main dengue jivan ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 When a mosquito bites a person, its saliva enters the human skin
 yadi machhar ko dengue he to virus isaki laar main hota he
 Therefore, when a mosquito bites a person, the virus enters the person's skin along with the mosquito's saliva
 virus vyakti kii shwet rakt kanikaon se jud kar unamem pravesh kar jaataa he 
 The virus regenerates when white blood cells move around the body
 shwet rakt kanikaayen kai tarah ke sanketon protein ke madhyam se pratikriya karti hai jaise interlukins, interferon tathaa tumor parigalan kaarak
 Dengue causes fever, flu-like symptoms and severe pain due to these proteins
 yadi kisi vyakti ko gambhir sankraman hai to virus uske sharir main or adhik teji se badhata he
 Because the number of viruses is very high, it can affect many more organs
 choti rakt keshikaon kii deevaaron se rakt ris karke sharir ke cotaron main chalaa jaataa he
 For this reason there is less blood flow to the blood capillaries
 vyakti kaa raktchaap itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki hriday mahatvapurn angon ko paryaapt rakt kii aapurti nahin kar paata he
 Also, the bone marrow does not produce enough platelets, which is necessary to make a blood clot
 paryaapt platelets ke bina, vyakti ko raktasrav hone kii samasya hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 Bleeding is the main complication caused by dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar aamtaur par sankramit vyakti kii jaanch karke or yah dekh kar ki uske lakshan dengue se milte hai, dengue kaa nidaan karte hai
 Healthcare professionals may thus be particularly capable of diagnosing dengue in areas where it typically occurs
 halanki, jab dengue praarambhik avasthaa main hota he to ise anya viral sankramanon se alag kar paanaa kathin hota he
 Dengue can possibly occur when a person has fever and has two of the following symptoms: nausea and vomiting; Red spots; General pain; Reduced number of white blood cells; Or positive tourniquet test
 ve kshetra jahaan par yah biimaar aam he vahaan par koi bhi chetavanee chihn tathaa bukhaar is baat kaa sanket he ki vyakti ko dengue he
 Warning signs usually appear before dengue becomes severe
 turnicket pareekshan tab kaaphi hota he jab koi prayogshaala pareekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In a tourniquet test, a healthcare professional ties the blood pressure measuring device strap around the person's arms for 5 minutes
 phir yadi us vyakti kii twachaa par laal dhabbe dikhen to swasthya seva peshewar unki ginati karata he
 The higher the number of spots, the more likely a person is to have dengue fever
 chikangunia tathaa dengue bukhaar ke bich antar karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Chikungunya is a viral infection that has similar symptoms as dengue and it also occurs in those parts of the world
 dengue ke lakshan anya bimariyon malaria, leptopyrosis, typhoed bukhaar tathaa meningocokkal rog jaise ho sakate hai
 Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their healthcare professionals will do some tests to make sure that the person does not suffer from one of these conditions
 jab kisi vyakti ko dengue hota he to uski shwet rakt kanikaon kii kam sankhya kaa prayogshaala pareekshan main dikhnaa sabase pehla parivartan dekha ja saktaa he
 Low platelet counts and metabolic acidosis are also symptoms of dengue
 yadi vyakti ko gambhir dengue he to aise anya badlaav bhi honge jo rakt kaa adhyayan karne par dekhe ja sakate hai
 Severe dengue can cause fluid leakage from blood streams
 jiske kaaran hemokonsontrishan ho saktaa he
 It also reduces albumin levels in the blood
 kabhi-kabhaar gambhir dengue adhik phuffus pravaah yaa jalodar bhi utpann karata he
 If its volume is sufficient, the healthcare professional may observe it at the time of the patient's testing
 koi swasthya seva peshewar dengue ke shock syndrome ko pehle hi dekh saktaa he yadi vah sharir ke bheetar dravya dekhne ke liye chikitsiya ultrasound kaa upyog kar sake
 But in many areas where dengue is common, most healthcare professionals and clinics do not have ultrasound machines
 2009 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan nen dengue bukhaar ko do prakaaron main vargeekrut yaa vibhajit kiya: saral tathaa gambhir
 Earlier in 1997, WHO divided the disease into indistinguishable and dengue fever
 WHO ne tay kiya ki dengue bukhaar ko vibhajit karne ke is puraane tareeke ko saral karne kii zarurat he
 It also decided that the old method was quite limited: it did not include all the ways in which dengue could present itself
 halanki dengue vargeekaran kaa tarika aadhikarik rup se badla gaya tha lekin purana vargeekaran abhi bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the old method of WHO, dengue hemorrhagic fever was divided into four stages, which were called grades i – IV: dengue bukhaar kaa nidaan microbiloji sambandhi prayogshaala pareekshan dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Some different tests can also be done
 koshikaon ke culture main ek pareekshan dengue virus ko pruthak karata he
 Another test identifies nucleic acids from viruses, using a technique called polymerase chain reaction
 ek teesraa pareekshan virus ke antigen kii pahchaan karata he
 Another test identifies antibodies in the blood that give the body the ability to fight against dengue virus
 virus isolation tathaa neucleic amla pahchaan pareekshan, antigen pahchaan se behatar kaam ke hote hai
 Although these tests cost more, they are not available in many locations
 jab dengue rog apane praarambhik charnon main hota he to yah saare pareekshan nakaaratmak ho sakate hai Apart from immunological testing, these laboratory tests can only be helpful in the diagnosis of dengue fever during the acute phase of the disease
 halanki, pratirakshi pareekshan is baat kii pushti kar sakate hai ke vyakti ko dengue, sankraman kii baad kii avasthaa kaa he
 The body produces antibodies that typically fight the dengue virus 5 to 7 days later
 dengue virus se logon ko bachaane ke liye abhi tak kisi vaxin ko sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 To prevent infection, the World Health Organization has suggested controlling the mosquito population and protecting people from mosquito bites
 WHO ne dengue ke rokthaam ke liye ek kaarykram kaa suzav diya he jisamen 5 bhinn bhaag shaamil hai: The WHO also makes some specific suggestions to control mosquitoes and protect people from being bitten by it
 "adies aegypti" machhar ko niyantrit karne kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki iske nivaason se mukti paayi jaay
 People should keep empty containers of water empty
 in kshetron main machharon ko niyantrit karne ke liye kitnashkon yaa jaivik niyantran agenton kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he

 Gross value added, as a measure, is related to GDP, as both are the parameters of the product itself

 sankeern arth main, rogon se aakraant hone par rogon se mukt hone ke liye jo upachaar kiya jaataa he vah chikitsa kehalaata he
 But in a broader sense, all those remedies fall under 'medicine', which protect the health and prevent diseases
 chikitsa, roganivaaran or rogaharan kii ek vidhi evam kala tathaa vaidyak ke mahatv kii ek shakha he
 Its objectives are health care, prevention, eradication of diseases, remediation of diseases and side effects and if there is no solution then in-situ mitigation
 pracheen greek chikitsakon kaa kathan he ""chikitsak chikitsa karata he or prakruti rogaharan karti he""
 There is power in the patients to avoid diseases, due to which, many patients become sick even if they do not do medicine
 chikitsa aisi honi chahie ki vah rogaharan kii shaktiyon main koi baadha na daale, varan usamen sahyog de
 For this, extreme anxiety should not be shown in medical work, nor should patients be left on the basis of natural power, or should be given impetuous treatment

 After the disease, the treatment that is done to destroy it is called curative therapy
 jab rogavigyaan, vikrutivigyaan, dravyagun vigyaan ityadi vishyon ke samyak gyaan par chikitsa adhishthit hoti he tab use yuktimulak chikitsa kehete hai
 Traditional experience of medicine is called empirical medicine

 Medical science is the result of such a science, which describes the uses of such measures which are necessary in all the physiological conditions from the point of view of public health and personal health, such as chikitsa shikshan main bhautikee, sankhyikee, rasayan, vanaspati, praani tathaa sookshmjeev vigyaan, maanviya sharirarachana, kayikee-vikrutivigyaan, pratirakshan vigyaan, ityadi pratyaksh:, tathaa anya sabhi vigyaan parokshat:, sahaayak hote hai
 There are basically three types of therapy based on the principle: therapeutic therapy, psychosomatic medicine and empirical therapy
 yauktik chikitsa main rog ke kaarnon evam rogi ke kayik tathaa maansik parivartanon ko samajhakar, gyaat prabhaav kii oshadhiyon athwa sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he

 pratham ke vistaaron main naanaa prakaar ke manovishleshan vaividhya he tathaa duusare main plasebo sadrush nishprabhav oshadhiyaan or jhaad-phunk prabhruti prayog aate hai
 In empirical medicine, we use medicines on the basis of known symbolic effects, but how the medicine works in the body is not known

 Then he got Guruji beheaded in front of everyone

 bharamouri bhashaa bharat kii sankatagrast bhashaaon main se ek he
 It is definitely in danger
 iesao code: gbk The origin of language refers to the period when humans started speaking and started learning 'language'
 is vishay main bahut si sankalpanaaen hai jo adhikanshtah anumaan par aadhaarit hai
 This period started so long in the history of human beings that it is impossible to get any indication related to its development
 bhashaa kii utpatti kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki maanav ne sarvapratham kis kaal main apane mukh se nisruth honevaali dhvaniyon ko vastuon-padaarthon, bhaavon se joda
 In what period of history, humans decided on a collective level what the word would mean
 ‘bhashaa kii utpatti’ kaa prashn bhashaa-vigyaan kii vichaar-seemaa main nahin aata
 Science, which will make an elemental analysis of matter, will tell which class of language this language is
 uske gun-dosha kii charchaa kar degaa par uske janm kaa prashn darshanashastra kii seemaa main jaataa he
 Today's language scientists do not consider the question of the origin of language to be within the limits of linguistics
 bhashaa kii utpatti ke vishay main vidwaanon ne do prakaar ke vichaar-maarg apanaae hai jinhen pratyaksh maarg or paroksh maarg kaha jaataa he- Language is developing at various times and circumstances today at a rapid pace, so there can be many difficulties in knowing the history behind its present form
 is maarg kii avyaavhaarikta ko dekhakar kisi prakaar kaa siddhanth nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 The efforts of the child to learn the language and the development of language by the society are both completely different things
 isi kaaran kuch vidwaanon ne paroksh maarg ko vyarth ghoshit kar diya he
 Major principles of the origin of language: The following theories are popular about the development or history of language and its origin: bhashaaon kii utpatti ke sambandh main sabase pracheen mat yah he ki sansar kii anekanek vastuon kii rachana jahaan bhagwaan ne kii he to sab bhashaayen bhi bhagwaan kii hi banaai hui hai
 Some people still hold this view even today
 sanskrit ko ‘devbhasha’ kehane main isi kaa sanket miltaa he
 Similarly, the 14 original sutras of Panini's grammar 'ashtabadhyayi' are said to derive from Maheshwar's damru
 buddha log ‘pali’ ko bhi isi prakaar mul bhashaa maanate rahe hai unka vishwaas he ki bhashaa anadi kaal se chali aa rahi he
 Jain people have moved beyond this
 unke anusaar ardhamagadhi keval manushyon kii hi nahi apitu dev, pashu-pakshi sabhi kii bhashaa he
 Some Hebrew scholars have collected words from many languages that resemble Hibu, and on the basis of this, prove that Hebrew is the mother of all languages of the world
 yadi bhashaa kii daivi utpatti hui hoti ho saare sansar kii ek hi bhashaa hoti tathaa baccha janm se hi bhashaa bolne lagata
 This proves that it is just superstition, there is no concrete theory
 misr ke raja sametics, fredrick dwittiya, scotland ke james chaturth tathaa akbar badshaah ne bhinn-bhinn prayogon dwaara chote shishuon ko samaaj se pruthak ekaant main rakhkar dekha ki unhen koi bhashaa aati he yaa nahin
 The most successful use of Akbar was because both the boys turned out to be dumb, who were kept away from society
 isse siddh hota he ki bhashaa prakruti ke dwaara pradutt koi uphaar nahin he
 New words keep coming in the language and old words get out of the domain
 nishkarsh The divine doctrine is not rational in relation to the origin of language
 isamen vaigyanik drushtikon kaa abhaav he
 There is no solution to the problem of the origin of language
 haan, is siddhanth main yahan tak sachai to he ki bolne kii shakti manushya ko janmajaat avasthaa se praapt he
 It is also called decision-theory
 is siddhanth ke pratham pratipadak fransisi vichaarak ruso hai
 According to the sign theory, in the initial state, humans must have expressed their thoughts and ideas with their organ signals
 Later, when it started to be difficult, then all humans decided many phonetic signs for different expressions, thoughts and substances based on social agreement

 yah kaary sabhi manushyon ne ekatra hokar vichaar vinimay dwaara kiya
 Thus language was gradually formed and language was generated by a symbolic institution in a social background

 Review * This theory assumes that humans did not receive language before this
 yadi aisa he to anya bhashahin praaniyon kii bhanti manushya ko bhi bhashaa kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav nahin hona chahie tha
 The conclusion is siddhanth main ek to kritrim upayon dwaara bhashaa kii utpatti siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he duusare yah siddhanth purnatah kalpana par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, the test of logic does not stand up

 According to this theory, everything in the world has its own sound
 yadi ham ek danda se ek kaath, lohe, sone, kapade, kaagaj aadi par chot maaren to prayek main se bhinn prakaar kii dhwani niklegi
 Even the earliest humans had such an innate power
 vah jab kisi bahya vastu ke sampark main aata to us par usase utpann dhwani kii anukaran kii) chhap padati thi
 Imitating those sounds, he created a few hundred base metals
 When some improvised metal words were formed and he acquired the language, his innate power to make his language ceased
 tab vah inhen dhaatuon se nae-nae shabd bana kar apana kaam chalaane laga
 Analysis nishkarsh Like its predecessors, this theory also failed to offer a definitive solution to the beginning of language due to the failure of the logic of logic
