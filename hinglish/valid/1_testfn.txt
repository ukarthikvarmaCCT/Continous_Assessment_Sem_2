 However, any additional demand should be adjusted from the posts found to be grossly redundant in the Ministry / Department and its attached and subordinate office

 kopan maaya sabhyataa kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It is in West Honduras
 The kingdom, anciently named Xukpi, flourished from the 5th century AD to the early 9th century, with antecedents going back to at least the 2nd century AD
 Its name is an apparent reference to the fact that it was situated at the far southern and eastern end of Maya territory
 The nearby modern village of Copán Ruinas itself may have anciently been known as Oxwitik
 The site in Copan is perhaps best known for producing a remarkable series of portrait stelae, most of which were placed along processional ways in the central plaza of the city and the adjoining "acropolis"
 The stelae and sculptured decorations of the buildings of Copán are some of the very finest surviving art of ancient Mesoamerica
 Many structures are elaborately decorated with stone sculptures, usually constructed from a mosaic of carved stones of a size that one person could carry
 The site also has a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame
 At its height in the late classic period Copán seems to have had an unusually prosperous class of minor nobility, scribes, and artisans, some of whom had homes of cut stone built for themselves, some of which have carved hieroglyphic texts
 The buildings suffered significantly from forces of nature in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins
 There have been numerous earthquakes - none of the roofs of the stone buildings were intact when the site was rediscovered, and the hieroglyphic stairway had collapsed
 The Copán river changed course and meandered, destroying part of the acropolis and apparently wiping out various subsidiary architectural groups in the region
 In the long period when the site was overgrown the buildings and sculptures suffered from the invasive thick jungle vegetation and periodic forest fires
 Archeologists have consolidated and restored many structures at the site
 The fertile Copán River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th century BC
 a kingdom seems to have been established in Copán in 159
 It grew into one of the most important Maya sites by the 5th century
 Large monuments dated with hieroglyhic texts were erected in the city from 435 through 822
 Xukpi was one of the more powerful Maya city states, a regional power, although it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the kingdom located at Quirigua in 738
 It eventually withered in the face of the depletion of natural resources which was a factor in bringing most of the classic-age Maya city-states to their end
 The area continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th century - 9th century from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000
 The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century
 The first sixteen names, from Yax K'uk' Mo' to Yax Pac, are depicted on Altar Q, an artifact that has provided researchers clues to the history and origins of Copán
 By the time of the Spanish conquest of Honduras, the site had long been overgrown by rainforest
 Although this large ruined city was known locally since early colonial times, it remained largely unknown by the outside world until a series of explorers visited it in the early 19th century
 Juan Galindo wrote a description of the ruins in 1834, which was published the following year
 This sparked the interest of North American explorer and travel writer John Lloyd Stephens and English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood whose illustrated books describe Copán and other sites excited a great deal of interest in Mesoamerican antiquities among American and European scholars, and its publication is regarded as the commencement of modern Mayan studies which continue to this day
 The site was the subject of one of the first modern archeological surveys and excavations in the Maya area, conducted by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University from 1891 to 1900
 Further excavations and restorations were begun by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 1930s, the Peabody Museum again in the 1970s, followed by the Government of Honduras's Proyecto Copán beginning in the late 1970s and continuing to this day

 He made the first comprehensive work on Western Philosophy, which combined policy, logic, science, politics and spirituality

 Thus the court of Macedonia had a profound influence on Aristotle's life
 unke pita kii maut unke bachapan main hi ho gai thi
 After the father's death, 17-year-old Aristotle was sent by his guardian to the Intellectual Education Center Athens to complete his education
 vah vahaan par bees varsho tak plato se shiksha pate rahe
 In the last years of his studies, he himself started teaching in the academy
 unke dwaara da layisium naamak sanstha bhi kholi gai |arastu ko us samay kaa sabase budhimaan vyakti mana jaataa tha jiske prashansa swayan unke guru bhi karte the
 Aristotle is counted among the great philosophers who were earlier such men and did not rely on traditions to come to any conclusion only after examining any event
 347 isvi purv main plato ke nidhan ke baad arastu hi academy ke netritv ke adhikari the kintu plato ke shikshaaon se alag hone ke kaaran unhen yah avasar nahin diya gaya
 Aristotle went to his court at the invitation of Atranius' friend Shashk Hrmiyaz

 Before Aristotle's second wife, he married a woman named Pithius, after whom he had a second marriage
 iske baad unke yahan necomax naamak putr kaa janm hua
 The most surprising thing is that Aristotle's father and son had the same name
 shaayad arastu apane pita ko bahut prem karte the isi vajah se unki yaad main unhone apane putr kaa naam bhi vahi rakhaa tha
 At the invitation of King Philip of Macedonia, he began teaching his thirteen-year-old son
 pita-putr donon hi arastu ko bada sammaan dete the
 People even used to say that Aristotle gets a lot of money from the royal court and thousands of slaves live in his service, although all these things were baseless
 elexander ke raja banane ke baad arastu kaa kaam khatm ho gaya or wo waapas athens aa gayi
 Aristotle founded the Platonic School and Platoism
 arastu aksar pravachan dete samay tahaltey rahete the isliye kuch samay baad unke anuyaayi peripetetics kahalaane lage
 Aristotle liked to discover, especially on subjects that are related to human nature such as "how does a man face problems whenever he encounters them?" And "how does a man's brain work?" Should there be an administration that works in a proper way to keep the society connected with the people
 aise prashnon ke uttar paane ke liye arastu apane aas paas ke maahaul par praayogic rukh rakhte hue bade itminan ke saath kaam karte rahete the
 He used to give detailed lectures to his disciples in the morning and ordinary people in the evening

 He was also accused of atheism
 wo dand se bachane ke liye chalsis chale gayi or vahiin par alexender kii maut ke ek saal baad 62 varsh kii umr main unki mrityu ho gayi
 In this way Aristotle became immortal as a great philosopher in the pages of history by becoming a disciple of the great philosopher Plato and a master of Alexander

 radox abhikriyaayein ke antargat ve sab rasinic abhikriyaayein sammilit hai jinamein parmaanuon ke oxikaran avasthaaen badal jaatin hai
 Generally, electrons are exchanged between the atoms of the reactants of the redox reactions
 kabhi bhi oxikaran yaa apchayan abhikriya akele nahin hoti
 Both are together
 ek hi abhikriya main yadi kisi cheez kaa oxikaran hota he to kisi duusari kaa apchayan hota he
 That is why they do not study separately and study together and together, they are called 'redox'
 prayojanavaad yaa falanumeyapramanyawad yaa vyavahaarwad angareji ke "pregametism" kaa samanarthvachi shabd he or pregametism shabd unani bhashaa ke 'pragma' shabd se bana he, jiskaa arth "kriya" yaa "karm" hota he
 Accordingly, "consequentialism" is an ideology that gives its functional influence or fruit a very important place in all fields of knowledge
 iske anusaar hamaari sabhi vastuvishyak dharanaayen unke sambhav vyaavhaarik parinaamon kii hi dharanaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, to get any thing or idea right, it is necessary to test its practical results
 prayojanavaad ek naveentam darshanik vichaardhaara he
 In the present era, this ideology is the most recognized among the various ideologies of philosophy and education
 yatharthwaad hi ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav-mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha
 Realism, rather than a name of a well-formed philosophical ideology, represents all ideas that believe that the object exists independently
 adarshavaadi yah maanata he ki ‘vastu’ kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he
 If this idea is correct then the object has no position
 iske thik vipareet yathartwaadee maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he chaahe vah hamaare vichaaron main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and its related knowledge are separate entities
 sansar main anek aisi vastuein hai jinke sambandh main hamen jaankaree nahin he parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve astitv main he hi nahin
 This is to say that the object has an independent position
 hamaara gyaan hamako uski sthiti se avgat karaata he parantu uske bare main hamaara gyaan na hone se uskaa astitv nasht nahin ho jaataa
 In the same way, realistic about the means of acquiring knowledge, scientific method like Purposeism considers only the best method and takes shelter of incorporation method
 prayojanavaadee vichaardhaara kaa udbhav kab hua tha yah to nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa, kintu phir bhi is vichaardhaara kii vishistataa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah avashya hi kaha ja saktaa he ki jab se manushya ne apni samasyaon evam kathinaaiyon ke kaarnon evam unke samaadhaan ke liye kiye gayi prayaason se praapt anubhavon kii satyata evam vyaavhaarikta ke sambandh main chintan prarambh kiya tabhi se is vichaardhaara kaa bijaropan ho gaya tha
 Certain proponents of this theory relate it to the Greek thinker Protagoras's "man is the measure of all things" - and also to the ancient philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, as users of the Pregomatic method; But in reality it is a modern ideology and its principal proponents are the famous psychologist of America, William James, educationist John Dewey and Dr

 John DV in America and Schiller in England were its main supporters and campaigners
 prayojanavaad athwa prayogwaad kaa janm america logon ke rahan- sahan tathaa vichaar prakriya ke falswaroop hua
 Because people fleeing Europe and England for religious freedom started believing in a peculiar functionality due to America's border-related freedom, so no ideology, other than for the hard-working beings to create new life, away from the digression of cultural values
 Was not suitable america jivan kaa yah ‘vaad’ pratibimb he
 This new philosophy was given full maturity by the greatest philanthropist, expert and propagator, the great philosopher, teacher and educationist John DV and therefore he is considered representative of Puritanism
 dow shiller ne maanviyatawad naamak siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he jise vastav main falanumeyapramanyawad kii ek shakha hi samajhnaa chahie
 Almost all of James's works are based on this ideology
 james praaia: aadhyatmavaad ke, visheshtya hegely aadhyatmavaad ke, kattar virdohi the
 It would not be inappropriate to call him an ideological representative of the usable and outlandish American people
 jab vah satya ke ek aise maapdand ke vichaar main lage the jo aadhyatmavaadi maapdand se sarvatha bhinn ho, unhone janvari, san 1878 i
 ke "paupular science" naamak ek amareeki masikpatr main, charles peers likhit "ham apane vichaaron ko spasht kaise banaaen" - lekh padhaa or usamen adhanik falanumey pramanyawad kii moolbhoot ruparekha paakar unhen yah vishwaas ho gaya ki satya yaa satyagyan kii kasuti yahi he
 To Peers, as he himself has stated, both the term "pragmatism" and its expressions of consequentialism were met with the works of the famous philosopher Kant of Germany
 parantu is vichaardhaara kii pracheenta pradarshit karte hue bhi james ne apane ko vishesh rup se peers kaa hi abhaari mana he or unhen darshanajagat main aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawad kaa pravartak kahkar sammanit kiya he
 In any case, James himself is the most notable name in giving this theory strength and fame
 unke likhe hue "manovigyaan ke siddhant", "dharmik anubhav ke vividh rup", "falanumeyapramanyawad", "satya kaa arth" or "nanaatmak vishwa" aadi sabhi prakhyat granth is vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 Not only his logical thoughts, but psychological and elemental - all kinds of ideas are clear symbols of the consequentialist tendency
 james ke anusaar "satya un sab baton kaa naam he jo vishwaas ke maarg main, tathaa nishchit nirdishtavy hetuon se bhi, apane aapako shreshth siddh karti hai"
 In short, "truth is only a worthy or appropriate tool of the thought process, just as" auspicious "is only a successful instrument of our practical life; it is somehow beneficial and, in fact, ultimately and all things Keeping in mind is beneficial
 " james satya ko hamaari nijee dharanaon kaa nakad mulya maanate hai, vastugat tathy nahin
 According to them, we create our own truths
 ve bahya vastuon kii pratikriya maatr nahin; kintu hamaare prayojanon ke sadhak hamaare hi vishwaas hote hai
 We tend to believe those beliefs that give us emotional fulfillment or practical success to be true, and vice versa as false
 at: hamaare vishwaason yaa vichaaron kaa satyatv unke fal yaa parinaam dwaara anumey hota he
 It takes time and experience to establish
 jaise jaise hamen kisi vishwaas se vyavhaar main safalataa milti jaati he vaise hi vaise uskaa satyatv bhi badhata jaataa he
 None of our beliefs, as evidenced by our limited experience, has the right to be called absolutely true, even the so-called natural laws of science cannot be called absolutely true
 hamen adhik se adhik yahi kehane kaa adhikaar he ki jahaan tak hamaare ab tak ke anubhavon kaa sabandh he, ve satya siddh hue hai; parantu isse unki shaashvat satyata pramanit nahin hoti
 a complete experience, which is never possible, is expected for complete truth
 at: maanav dwaara pratipaadit koi bhi satya, chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe taarkik, purna satya nahin ho saktaa
 Those who often perceive the siddha-satya or principle, are considered to be only a sub-concept of the result
 ve buddhivaadee tarkshastra kii kadi aalochana karte hai or unke nyayavakya aadi siddhanton ko dooshit tehraate hai
 They always consider human ideas to be ideological, not selfless, against the beliefs of rational rationalists
 gyaan ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan kii bhartiya nyaayadarshan kii "pravritisamarthy va pravritivisamvaad" naamak vidhi, jiske anusaar kaary main pravrutt hone par safalataa pradaayak gyaan ko yatharth tathaa vifaltaajanak gyaan ko ayatharth yaa mithyaa mana jaataa he, is falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi se milti julati maaloom hoti he
 But, at the same time, the staunch objectivist jurist saying "tadvati tatrakarak jnanam realam" and tadabhavati tatakarak jnanam illusion: "james" seems to be bitterly criticized by Western Western philanthropists
 jis prakaar satyasty vivechan main, usee prakaar maansik prakriyaaon yaa vichaaron kii vyakhya main bhi falanumeyapramanyawaadee hamaari prayojnatmak kriyaaon ko hi pramukh sthaan pradaan karte hai
 According to him, we produce not only our truths but also diverse experiences
 hamaara praathmik athwa, moolbhoot anubhav ek avichhinn dhara jaisaa hota he or ham swaprayojanon evam swaarthon se prerit hokar, vishleshan tathaa chunaav aadi karne kii apni maansik kriyaaon dwaara, uskaa vibhaajan, vibhinn padaarthon tathaa unke parsparik sambandhon ke rup main, kar liya karte he
 Thus, in his psychology and Locke's atomistic psychology, according to which our ideas are considered to be a mechanically stored sequence of initial simple suffixes, there is a fundamental difference
 falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon kii drushti main parmanuwaadi manovigyaan isi naam ke bhautik vigyaan kii nakal he jo vaastaviktaa se dur evam bhraamak he
 There is no scientific consensus among those who accept the consequent holistic method of testing the truthfulness of beliefs or ideas
 phir bhi, yadi kisi tatvagyan ko is vichaardhaara kaa praturup kaha ja saktaa he to vah he pro dyui dwaara samarthit dow shiller kaa "studies in humanism" naamak pustak main pratipaadit tathvik siddhant
 According to this, we always keep creating reality to a large extent and in the true sense, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality is concerned, it is decided that its form of creation depends, in a very important part, on our knowledge and on our knowledge on which our motives and interests are imprinted
 hamaare tathy ve hi hote hai jinamein unki nirmaapika main hamaari ichchhaaon ko trupt karne kii shakti yaa yogyata hoti he
 Just as truths are our successful beliefs, facts are the material that give satisfaction to our desires
 sankshep main hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan main safal kriyaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ko hi, in vichaarkon ke anusaar, tathyata yaa vaastaviktaa kaa lakshan samajhnaa chahie
 Indian Buddhist philosophy's definition of satta, according to which "satya is that which has the potential to produce an action", seems to be compatible with the consequentialist ideology, because it also contains the functions of the objects in determining their existence, existence, existence
 The fruit itself is considered to be decisive
 parantu tatvagyan sambandhi anek anya baton main sabhi buddha darshanik na to aapas main sahamat hai or na aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ke saath
 Purposeism, being a humanist philosophy, does not consider the world and its objects and actions as seriously as it does considering its usefulness in human life
 ek swatantra darshan ke rup main apane astitv kii raksha ke liye prayojanavaad ne maanav ko aadhaar banaate hue sansar evam uski kriyaaon ke kaarnon par vichaar karte hue nimnlikhit mul siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he- Therefore, it is clear that the Purists sometimes support the idealists and sometimes the naturalists
 is prakaar ve apane ko in donon ‘vaado’ ke bich kii sthiti main rakhte hai
 Purposeful philosophy emerged as a movement of 'progress Movement Education' but today many apprehensions are being raised regarding its success
 kaaran spasht he ki prayojanavaad ne apane anishchit uddeshyon se, saadhan ko saadhy se adhik mahatv dekar tathaa manushya kii mulyon ke kshetra main rachanaatmakataa ityadi siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke apurna vichaardhaara hone kaa parichay diya he
 Some points to consider in relation to Purposeful philosophy are as follows - komal shiksha pranali ke kaaran baalkon ko vaastavik jivan jeene ke liye taiyaar nahin kiya jaataa

 While Priya worked on TV in a feminist serial like Swajnidh directed by Gulzar, she also played the role of a dead wife speaking from a photo frame in a comedy serial like "hum Paanch" and successful talk shows like "the Priya Tendulkar Show" and "jambhavna Kaun"
 In which she was known for her aggressive temper
 ankur, mohara or trimurti jaisi kuch hindi filmon main bhi unhone kaam kiya par koi ullekhneey bhoomikaayen nahin
 Perhaps the role of "rajni" and her father's influence was that Priya was always aware of social issues
 unka vyaktitv khulaa or saahsee tha
 At the height of "the Priya Tendulkar Show", several political parties, including the Shiv Sena, tried to include her in their party, but she could not make up her mind

 When the flames of the revolt of 1857 reached Kanpur and the soldiers there declared Nana Saheb as Peshwa and their leader, Tatya Tope took the lead in establishing independence in Kanpur
 tathya tope ko naanaa sahab ne apana sainik salaahkaar niyukt kiya
 When British forces attacked Kanpur on behalf of Allahabad under the command of Brigadier General Havelock, Tatya committed his life to the safety of Kanpur, but he was defeated on 16 July 1857 and had to leave Kanpur

 Not being distracted by the defeat, he reached the area of rao Saheb Scindia from Bithoor

 Rani and Tatya Tope reached Kalpi after this

 The battles of Kanpur, Charkhari, Jhansi and Konch were led by Tatya Tope
 charkhaari ko chhodkar durbhaagya se anya sthanon par unki paraajay ho gayi
 Tatya Tope was a highly qualified general
 konch kii paraajay ke baad unhen yah samajhate der na lagi ki yadi koi nayaa or joardaar kadam nahin uthaaya gaya to swadhinata senaniyon kii paraajay ho jaayegi
 Therefore, Tatya left the burden of protection of Kalpi to the Rani of Jhansi and his other allies and they disguised themselves and went to Gwalior
 jab huroj kalpi kii vijay kaa jashn manaa rahaa tha, tab tathya ne ek aisi vilakshan safalataa praapt kii jisase huroj achambhe main pads gaya
 Tatya's counter-attack was incredible

 During this raid war, Tatya Tope raced across the inaccessible hills and valleys across the rain-soaked rivers and ghastly forests in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which kept the English camp afloat
 baar-baar unhen chaaron ore se gherne kaa prayaas kiya gaya or baar-baar tathya ko ladaayiyaan ladnee paddy, parantu yah chhapamar yoddha ek vilakshan sujh-boojh se angrejon ke gheron or jaalon ke pare nikal gaya
 Sylvester, the then English writer, wrote that "tatya Tope was chased thousands of times and horses were run for forty miles in a day, but Tatya Tope was never successful in capturing
" ‘‘ After leaving Gwalior, Tatya crossed the Chambal and went to Tonk, Bundi and Bhilwara in Rajasthan
 unka iraadaa pehle jaipur or udaipur par kabja karne kaa tha, lekin major general rabarts vahaan pehle se hi pahunch gaya
 The result was that Tatya had to return when he was 60 miles away from Jaipur

 He sent Lieutenant Colonel Holmes to chase Tatya, who was fully prepared to stop Tatya's path, but that did not happen

 After the defeat of Kankroli, Tatya fled to the east to cross the Chambal

 Chambal was growing fast, but Tatya enjoyed taking risks
 angrej unka peechha kar rahe the, isliye unhone barh main hi chambal paar kar lee or jhalawad kii rajdhani jhalaar patan pahunche
 The ruler of Jhalawar was British-based, so Tatya recovered millions of rupees from the British army and captured 30 cannons
 yahan se unka iraadaa indore pahunchakar vahaan ke swadhinata senaniyon ko apane paksh main karke phir dakshin pahunchnaa tha
 Tatya was confident that if it was possible to cross the Narmada and reach Maharashtra, the freedom struggle would not only be continued, but the British could also be driven out of India

 yahan angrejon ne paidal, ghudsavaar or topakhana daston ko lekar ek saath akraman kiya
 This war also lost Tatya

 Tatya moved towards the valley of Betwa in the east
 sironj main tathya ne chaar topon par kabja kar liya or ek saptaah vishram kiya
 From Sironj they reached Ishagarh in the north and plundered the town and captured five more cannons
 ishagarh se tathya kii sena do bhaagon main bant gayi
 One troop went to Lalitpur under the command of Rao Saheb and the other to Chanderi under the command of Tatya
 tathya kaa vishwaas tha ki chanderi main sindhiya kii sena uske saath ho jaaegi, parantu aisa nahin hua
 So they moved to Magavali, 20 miles south
 vahaan micle ne unka peechha kiya or 10 oktober ko unako parajeet kiya
 Now Tatya crossed Betwa and went to Lalitpur where Rao Saheb was also present
 un donon kaa iraadaa betwa ke paar jane kaa tha parantu nadi ke duusare tat par angrej sena rasta roke khadi thi
 Looking around, Tatya thought of crossing the Narmada
 is mansoobey ko puraa karne ke liye ve sagar jile main khurai pahache, jahaan micle ne uski sena ke pichley daste ko parrast kar diya
 Hence Tatya crossed the Narmada between Saras Ghat near Fatehpur, between Hoshangabad and Narsinghpur
 tathya ne oktober, 1858 ke ant main kareeb 2500 sainikon ke saath naramada paar kii thi
 There was a hint of Tatya reaching long before crossing the Narmada

 The British took immediate steps
 nagpur ke dipti kamishnar ne padosi jilon ke dipti kamishnaron ko sthiti kaa saamana karne ke liye sachet kiya
 This information was considered so important that its information was given to the Governor General
 narmada paar karke or uski dakshini kshetra main pravesh karke tathya ne angrejon ke dilon main dehshat paidaa kar di
 Tatya was looking for this opportunity and the British too had barricaded all over Central India to thwart his plan

 The governor of Bombay province, Elphinstone, was frightened by the arrival of Tatya in the Nagpur region

 Then Tatya reached Multai on November 7, passing through Bordeh

 Later, the British confiscated these asharfis

 But Tatya did not get the success he had hoped to get public support here

 unhone apane sahyogiyon ko ajna de di ki ve jahaan chahen ja sakate hai, parantu nishthavan sahyogi or anuyaayi aise kathin samay main apane netaa kaa saath chhodne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Tatya wanted to reach Asirgarh, but Asir was heavily guarded
 atah nimad se bidaa hone ke pehle tathya ne khandawa, pipalod aadi ke police thanon or sarkari imaaraton main aag laga di
 From Khandwa, they went back to Central India via Khargone

 Raja Mansingh of Narwar met the British and due to his betrayal, Tatya was caught in bed on 8 April 1859

 Tatya was court martialed at Shivpuri on 15 April 1859 on charges of fighting rebellion and war against the British

 The result was obvious, he was given the death penalty
 shivpuri ke kile main unhen teen din band rakhaa gaya
 At five in the evening on 18 April, Tatya was brought out under the protection of the British Company and hanged in the open ground in the presence of thousands of people
 kehete hai tathya phaansi ke chabutare par drudh kadamon se upar chadhe or phaansi ke fande main swayan apana galaa daal diya
 In this way Tatya became part of the soil of Madhya Pradesh
 karnal malesan ne san 1857 ke vidroh kaa itihaas likhaa he
 He said that Tatya Tope has become the 'hero' of the inhabitants of the valleys of Chambal, Narmada and Parvati
 sach to ye he ki tathya saare bharat ke ’hero‘ ban gayi hai
 An Englishman named Percy Cross wrote that 'tatya was the most powerful leader of the mind in the Indian rebellion
 unki tarah kuch or log hote to angrejon ke haath se bharat chhina ja saktaa tha, But some historical material has come to light in the ninth session of the Rajasthan History Congress, according to which Mansingh and Tantya Tope made a plan, according to which Tope's loyal partner was prepared by persuading him to become a fake Tantia Tope and for that he was prepared done
 The same fake Tantia Tope was caught by the British and hanged
 The real Tantya Tope lived for eight to ten years after this and later he died of natural death
 He used to visit his village every year and meet his family, what is the document "tantya Tope's alleged hanging" written by Gajendrasinh Solanki and published by All India History Collection Scheme, New Delhi? Mr
 Solanki has mentioned many documents and letters in his book and has also printed a picture of Narayanrao Bhagwat on the main page of the said book
 It is mentioned in the book that in the year 1957 AD
 In the footnote on page 46 of the play "our Country", written by Dr
 Ramachandra Billaur, published by Indore University, a new research in this regard is that King Mansingh did not betray Tantia Tope, but the British Dust blew in his eyes
 There was a country devotee swinging on the gallows, who sacrificed himself to save Tantya Tope
 Tantya Tope Memorial Committee has published a revolutionary letter of 1857 in the name of "for Tantya Tope" in 1978, the said paper is safe in Madhya Pradesh Archives Bhopal
 Two letters of 1917 and 1918, found in it, are proof of survival of Tantya Tope
 The book also mentions that the Tantya Tope Centenary Celebration was held in Bombay in which Tantya Tope's nephew Prof
 Tope and his old niece were honored
 apane sammaan par in donon ne prakat kiya ki taantya tope ko faansee nahin hui thi
 He said that Tantya Tope died in 1909 and his family duly performed the last rites
 san 1926 i
 main landan main edward thampsan kii pustak "di adar said of di medil" chhapi thi
 In this book also, suspicion has been expressed on the hanging of Tantya Tope
 This proves that King Mansingh never betrayed Tantya Tope nor was she ever given a jagir by the British
