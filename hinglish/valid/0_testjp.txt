 The order of significance is often used for approximate approximations / comparisons

 Similarly, if they show the difference of two terms, it is a hundred times

 The remarkable work done by Pandit Gauridutt ji in the development of Hindi language and literature, shows his dedication and efficiency
 nagari lipi parishad ne unke sammaan main unke naam par 'gauridatt nagari sevi sammaan' armbh kiya he
 Pandit Gauridutt was born in 1836 in a city called Ludhiana in the state of Punjab

 Your primary education was simple
 keval panditai kaa kaary karne tak hi vah simit thi
 When you were only 5 years old, a monk came to your house and he gave such knowledge to your father that they all left the illusion and left the house
 aapaki mataji apane donon bacchon ko lekar meerut chali ai thim
 After coming to Meerut, Gauridutt ji advanced his study

 In his speeches in the garden of Munshi Lekhraj, Swamiji had many times regretted that the countrymen were abandoning Hindi and Devanagari and becoming slaves to urdu-persian and English
 swami ji ke in bhaashanon kaa yuvak gauridatt par bahut adhik prabhaav padaa or aapane usee samay se devanagari ke prachaar or prasar kaa sankalp kar liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati used to promote nationalism in his speeches, so the British government considered you as a seditious person
 jab mishan skool ke adhikariyon ko yah pataa chalaa ki gauridatt ji swami ji ke bhaashanon ko tanmaitapurvak sunate hai or unke prati shraddha bhi pradarshit karte hai to unhone gauridatt ji se is par apni naaraazgi prakat kii
 The incident of the school authorities on the youth Gauridutt had the effect that you immediately resigned from the school, protecting your self-esteem and on the very next day established the 'devanagari Pathshala' on a platform in the locality called Meerut 'vaidwara'

 In the memorandum, you had highlighted the usefulness and admissibility of Devanagari script in this way - 'devanagari is such a simple and scientific script that its 36 letters and 12 volumes can be easily learned in just 3 days and in 6 months, it was fully practiced

 Panditji had become so fond of Nagari and Hindi that you had even inscribed the word Jai Nagari on your tunic and used to say 'jai Nagari' at the time of traditional greetings
 unki samadhi par isliye logon ne devanagari pracharanand shabd ankit kiye the
 a song you composed for the promotion of Devanagari shows your passion and loyalty
 geet kaa prarambh kuch is prakaar thah What can be more convincing proof of your Devanagari-love than this, that before his death, on 1 June 1903, he had given his entire property in the will written for the promotion of Nagari
 aapaki yah hardik aakanksha thi ki aapaki is nidhi se sthaan-sthaan par ‘devanagari paathshaalaayein' kholi jaaen
 In addition to this, a person with a very ordinary condition had earned the amount of 32 thousand rupees earned from his blood-sweat earnings in the work of spreading Devanagari
 pandit gauridatt ne devanagari ke prachaar ke liye jahaan sthaan-sthaan par anek paathshaalaayein sthapit kin vahiin apni lekhnee ko bhi is disha main lagaaya
 He edited the letters 'nagari-hundred Akshar', 'akshar Deepika', 'secret Talk of Nagari', 'script Bodhini', 'bhajan of Devanagari' and 'gauri Nagari Kosh', 'devanagari Gazette' and 'nagari Patrika' and Publication was also done

 Because of this tune, people used to tell you 'devanagari Pracharanand' and 'hindi ka Socrat'
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki aapane ‘kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha‘ kii sthapana se purv hi san 1892 main devanagari prachaarak naamak patr kaa sampadak evam prakaashan karke hindi-prachaar ke itihaas main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Even Mr
 Ayodhyaprasad Khatri of Bihar had contributed to this work of yours
 pandit gauridatt ne jahaan devanagari lipi ke prachaar tathaa prasar ke liye itane granth likhe or anek patr-patrikaayen sampadit kin vahaan apane san 1870 main 'devraani jethaani kii kahani' naamak ek upanyaas bhi likhaa
 It is also known here that Bhartendu Babu Harishchandra started writing Hindi prose in 1873
 pandit gauridatt ke is upanyaas kaa prakaashan san 1870 main hua tha
 Earlier in Hindi-prose, there was only a book called 'story of Rani Ketki' by Syed Insha Allah Khan
 isse yah siddh ho jaataa he ki hindi kaa pehla upanyaas ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani‘ hi he
 It is a matter of great misfortune that even the leading Acharya of Hindi historians Ramchandra Shukla ignored it and gave the book titled 'examination Guru' of Pandit Shraddharam Phillauri's' Bhagyavati 'lala Srinivas Das in his book titled' History of Hindi Literature 'respectively' Hindi The first social novel of 'and' the first Hindi novel of English manner 'is considered
 is sambandh main yah bhi ullekhneey tathy he ki is upanyaas ke prakaashan par uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen governor ne ‘sau rupye‘ kaa puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya tha
 Another novel called 'girija' translated by you is also notable
 pandit gauridatt ji jahaan achche gadhy-lekhak the vahaan khadi boli kavita ke kshetra main bhi aapaki pratibha adbhut thi
 a clear proof of this is found at the end of your novel titled 'devrani Jethani Ka Kahani', which was written by the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh on receipt of the award: isse yah swatah siddh ho jaataa he ki gadhy-lekhan or padya-lekhan donon hi kshetron main pandit gauridatt kaa naam sarvatha agrani or anany he
 It is a matter of happiness that the attention of some wise scholars of Hindi has gone towards this genius of Gauridutt ji and the illusion is now gradually being overcome that instead of the first Hindi novels 'bhagyavati' and 'examination Guru' The story of deorani-jethani is the same
 is upanyaas kaa prakaashan sarvapratham san 1870 main meerut ke ‘jian chhapekhane‘ main litho-paddati se hua tha or isaki prati ab bhi ‘neshnal librori kalakatta‘ main surakshit he
 The novel has now been republished by Professor Dr

 a more mature manufacturing process has to be thanked thanks to the second-generation macbook Air's CPU being the same as the first-generation macbook Air series since late 2008, but it performs better on load, as the first-generation chips significantly Runs faster, which requires the processor to be opened in order to avoid overheating, which further reduces functionality Comes up

 varsha, bijli, rog, bukamp, vrikshpaat, vipatti aadi agyaat tathaa agyeya dev, bhoot, pret or pishaachon ke prakope ke parinaam maane jate the
 Such thoughts did not dissolve even after the knowledge had become light, but these began to be considered superstitions
 adikaal main manushya kaa kriya kshetra sankuchit tha isliye andhvishwaason kii sankhya bhi alp thi
 As the human actions expanded, the web of superstitions also spread and many distinctions were discerned
 andhvishwaas sarvadeshik or saarvkalik hai
 They remain hidden even in the light of science
 abhi tak inkaa sarvatha uchdved nahin hua he
 In India, the roots of blind faith are very deep, Brahmin literature has a major contribution in it
 andhvishwaason kaa sarvasammat vargeekaran sambhav nahin he
 Naming them is also difficult
 prithvi sheshnag par sthit he, varsha, garjan or bijli indra kii kriyaayein hai, bukamp kii adhishthatri ek devi he, rogon ke kaaran pret or pishaach hai, is prakaar ke andhvishwaason ko pragvaigyanik yaa dharmik andhvishwaas kaha ja saktaa he

 Witchcraft, Shakun, Muhurta, Mani, Amulets etc
 are the children of superstition
 in sabake antstal main kuch dharmik bhav hai, parantu in bhaavon kaa vishleshan nahin ho saktaa
 There is irrational belief in them
 madhya yug main yah vishwaas prachlit tha ki aisa koi kaam nahin he jo mantra dwaara siddh na ho saktaa ho
 Failures were considered to be exceptions
 isliye krishi raksha, durgaraksha, rog nivaaran, santatilabh, shatru vinaash, aayu vruddhi aadi ke hetu mantra prayog, jaadu-tona, muhoort or mani kaa bhi prayog prachlit tha
 The gem is made of metal, wood or leaf and is tied on the throat or arm by writing a mantra on it
 isko mantra se siddh kiya jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi iskaa devtaa kii bhanti aavahan kiya jaataa he
 Its purpose is self-defense and evil prevention
 yogini, shakini or daakini sambandhi vishwaas bhi mantra vishwaas kaa hi vistaar he
 Laws about Dakini remained in England and Europe until the 17th century

 From the point of view of the followers of any religion, the doctrines and rituals of other religions fall under the category of superstition

 ham dekhte he ki prastar yug, tamra yug or uske baad ke yugon kii kala isi adarsh or lakshya par aadhaarit he, na ki ek kisi anupayogi vastu kaa keval saundarypan karne ke liye
 This is the reason that while on one hand the impression of their life, religion and social order is evident in these metal and wood items which are used in the daily works made by them, on the other hand, we can get a glimpse of the latent aesthetic sense contained in them by these objects
 Also get dhaatu kii apeksha lakdi kaa prayog baad main hua hoga, aisa kahana thik nahin janchataa
 Yes, it is of course that due to wood being a less durable medium, we do not find examples in it so ancient as those found in metal, bone or stone
 aitihaasik yug kii vaastukala, chaahe vah rahane kaa awaas ho, mandir, chaitanya athwa vihaar ho is baat kii pushti karti he ki iske purv yahi sab chijen lakdi main banaai jaati rahi hongi
 Lomus' hut, Sanchi's gate and window, Ajanta's caves are a vivid proof of the fact that even though built in stone, his imagination and plan are based on wood

 With the development of civilization, man has not left a useful notion in his manufactured goods, but we see that his fluidity has made him beautiful product of fine arts in some quantity by his fluidity
 yah keval aadhunik yug kii hi dein he ki jahaan kala ek ore samuhik na hokar vyaktigat hui, duusari ore uski upyogita kala, kala ke liye ho, is uddeshy ko lekar chali, yah duusari baat he ki isi anupayogi kala kaa prabhaav bhi hamaari upyogi vastuon par padaa or ek prakaar se usne samuhik rup liya
 In today's scientific age, internationalism is also emerging as a new form of art by the developed means of transport where the political, social or religious boundaries of a nation are broken and humanity is bound by a united approach, art does not give up individual originality
 Is found because overwhelmed by psychological thoughts, in the gaps of the individual, there are dormant desires, desires and copy Terrorism fears has been still appropriate material value of variant of Art
 mohanjodaado kii nartki kii dhaatu kii murti se us kaal kii kala kaa str, drushtikon evam aavashyak gun hamen spasht parilakshith hote hai or yadi ham baad kii dhaatu kii murtiyon main dekhen, jo dasvin shatabdi se prachur maatra main banani prarambh ho gai thim, to nartki un sab gunon se paripurna he jo ek ucch koti kii murti main hone chahie
 In the soulful dynamics of the bronze statue of Nataraja, we find all the qualities of traditional art beauty, as well as modern standards, in all its qualities
 nepali tara kii murti kii shaat ardhanayan nimilit saumyata, uske chaaron ore kaa anaavashyak alankaran, jo dhire dhire baad kii murtiyon main or bhi bad gaya, kisi se chhip nahin paati
 Although all such idols were made with religious sentiments, but due to their beauty, they became secular
 dhaatu kii murtiyan teen prakaar kii hoti thim, dhali hui, piti hui or dhali piti hui
 The molded sculptures were initially made by wax
 or phir patali maheen chikani mitti ke ghol main murti ko dubaakar ek motaa aavaran bana liya jaataa tha
 The wax is pumped out by applying a bottom-mounted wax tube which is placed at the required locations of each sculpture, and the same blank is filled with metal through the same tube passage
 chaandi, sona, kaansa, pital or ashtadhaatu kii sabhi murtiyan isi prakaar dhaali jaati hai
 In the second type of sculptures, the metal sheet is lifted from the back by beating the metal sheet and it is joined to the shells of various embossed limbs
 kabhi kabhi dhali hui murtiyon ke alankaran petakar banaate or baad main jod dete hai yaa piti hui murtiyon ke singhaasana athvlankaran dhale hue rahete hai
 South India, Napal and Gujarat have been the hub of such sculptures and even now there are traditional styles and method to manufacture these idols, though now they aim to earn foreign exchange by creating less religious and wonderful items
 murtiyon ke atirikt aradhana kaary mandir or dainik jivan main kaary aanevaali vastuen paramparaagat style main ab bhi banati he jais kalash, dharti, pradeep, purna kumbh ghante, chhip lakshmi, saraute, chaaku ityadi jo ab rnijeev or rudhigat hone par bhi ek apni sthaneey style kaa aakarshan rachate hai
 Most of the specimens of wood art are not available to us from pre-medieval period, but it can be easily assumed that their tradition of such art must have been very old to reach that high level

 All these were intended to be an ornate part of woodwork art as compared to independent sculptures, but artists have got a lot of opportunity to show their craftsmanship and maturity and these wooden houses, worship or habitat, more on religious subject Despite the encouragement, we find that digging of these buildings from secular subjects like hunters, cattlemen, narnaris engrossed in daily life is

 The special reason for this is the rarity of this type of wood and the absence of large perimeter trees
 mughal kaal main bhi yah kala panpi or aavnoos ke kaary ke liye, jiske alankrita kanghe, kanghiyaan, kalamdaan dabbe ityadi banaae jate rahe
 Nagina and Saharanpur cities of Uttar Pradesh became famous
 usee kaal se lakdi ke upar pital kaa taar, sip athwa vibhinn prakaar kii lakadiyon ke mail se phool boote kaa jadaau kaam bhi prarambh hua
 Like all arts, metal and wood sculptures also became lifeless and orthodox due to the different view of foreign state and lack of proper protection and encouragement
 kahin unka lop hua to kahin unke kushal kaarigaron ne jeevananirvaah ke liye anya kaam dhandhe samhaal liye
 The rich educated class lost their refined interest in the dazzle of civilization and art of foreign goods
 shikshit kalakaaron ne bhi videshi kala kaa anusaran kiya kintu kalantar se ab phir in khoi hui vaibhavsheel kalaon kii ore dhyaan ja rahaa he or anek udiyaman kalakaaron ne kashtha murtikla ko apana madhyam banaaya he jisamen bhartiya paramparaagat style ke saath ham aaj antarrashtriya kaladrushti kaa sundar samanvay pate hai
 Each medium has its own independent quality and character which is not found in the other medium
 dhaatu kii murti kashtha jaisi na lage or kashtha kii murti pathar, cement athwa dhaatu jaisi na lage or uske anrtahit gunon ko parakhkar madhyam ke anukool, nas, rang, rup ko dhyaan main rakh kalakaar apni kriti kii kalpana kare or uske gopneey saundarya ko unmilit kar de jisase utaar chadhaav, rekha ityadi ke sammishran se ek moulik rachana prastut ho, yahi aadhunik kalakaar kaa dhyey or uddeshy he
 Whatever may be the external appearance, the basic principles of our art, which fall under the conspiracy, still meet any measurement penalty, no matter how modern

 Posthumous erections, a scholastic erections and what is technically termed priapism, are often seen in the bodies of men who have died due to death, especially hanging

 In men, leakage of mucus, urine, or prostatic fluid with more or less erections of the penis is a frequent occurrence that is expected to occur in one out of every three people
 mrityu ke anya kaarnon se bhi ye prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he jaise mastishk, rakt vahikaaon main ghaatak goli laganaa, vishaaktata ke dwaara or nyaayalayik rup se kahen to shavpariksha ke dauraan prayapism is baat kaa sanket he kii mrityu teevr or hinsak dhang se hui thi

 vaigyanik prabandhan prabandhan kaa ek siddhanth he jo kaary-pravaah kaa vishleshan evam sanshleshan karti he or is prakaar shramik utpaadakta ko badhaane main sahaayta karti he
 Its original theories were propounded by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the 1880s and 1890s, which came to light through his works "shop Management" and "the Principles of Scientific Management"
 tailor kaa maananaa tha ki paripati or "rule of thamb" par aadhaarit nirnay ke sthaan par aisi tareekon / vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya janaa chaiye jo karmikon ke kaary kaa dhyanpurbak adhyayan ke falswaroop viksit kiye gayi hon
 Taylorism, in fact, is another name for efficiency enhancement
 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant evam beesvin shatabdi ke prarambh main maanav-jivan main dakshata badhaane, barbaadi kam karne, prayogadhaarit vidhiyon kaa upyog karne aadi kii bahut charchaa hui
 Taylorism can be considered a part of them
 audyogic kranti ke praarambhik dinon main, jabaki kaarkaana sanghathan kii koi sthapit paddati mimasha nahin thi, kaarkaana maalik athwa prabandhak prabandh kaary karte hue aane vaali samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karte samay adhikansh vyaktigat nirnyon par hi nirbhar karte the
 This is called the thumb tech rule
 angootha tech niyam apnaane par kaarkaanon kaa prabandh karte samay prabandhak paristhiti ke anusaar kaary kar sakate the lekin unhen praytn evam mul kii paddati kii simaaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 To make their experience unique, it was important to know who does the work and why does it do it? The path to be followed for this was based on the scientific method i
e
 defining the problem, developing alternative solutions, forecasting results, measuring progress and finding results
 is paridrishy main tailor vaigyanik prabandh ke janak ke rup main ubhar kar aae
 He suggested scientific arrangement in place of thumb tech
 unhone maanviya kriyaaon ko chote-chote bhaagon main baanta tathaa yah pataa kiya ki vah ise kam samay evam adhik utpaadakta se kis prakaar se kar saktaa he
 It includes business actions, level tools
 tailor ke shabdon main Applying the principles of scientific management to Bethlehem Steel Company, in which Taylor himself was employed, increased productivity threefold 
 isliye in siddhanton par vichaar karnaa uchit hi hoga
 Taylor took the initiative to apply the scientific method in the field of management
 ham pehle hi prabandh angootha tech niyam kii simaaon kii charchaa kar chuke hai
 Now because all managers will adopt their thumb-rule rules, it is natural that not all will be equally effective
 tailor kaa vishwaas tha ki adhiktam kaaryakshmata main vruddhi keval ek hi sarvottam vidhi thi
 This method can be developed through study and analysis
 is prakaar se viksit paddati ko puure sanghathan main ‘angootha tech niyam’ ke sthaan par lagu karnaa chahie
 The scientific method consisted of investigation through the work study of elementary systems, integration of best practices and development of a level system, which should be adopted throughout the organization
 tailor ke anusaar lohe kii chhadon ko dabbaband gadiyon main ladane kii choti si utpaadan kriya ko bhi vaigyanik dhang se niojit kiya ja saktaa he evam uskaa prabandhan kiya ja saktaa he
 This will result in huge savings in human power and time and waste of goods
 jitani adhik vyavasthit prakriya hogi utani hi adhik bachat hogi
 In the present context, the use of the Internet has brought about astonishing change in internal efficiency and customer satisfaction
 utpaadan kii kaarkaana pranali main prabandhak, maalik evam shramikon ke bich kii kadi hote hai
 Managers are empowered to get the work done by the workers, so you can easily understand that there is always a possibility of those class distinctions ie manager versus labor
 tailor ne paaya ki is takaraav se, shramik, prabandhak athwa kaarkaana maalik kisi ko laabh nahin pahunchaata he
 He emphasized on full cooperation between management and workers
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki donon kaa hi mahatva he
 To achieve this position, Taylor called for a complete mental revolution in both managers and workers
 iskaa arth tha ki prabandhak evam shramik donon kii soch main badlaav aana chahie
 If this happens, the labor organizations will not even think of going on strike etc
 yadi company ko laabh hota he to prabandhakon ko chahie ki vah ise karmchaariyon main baante
 Employees also need to work hard for the good of the company and adopt change
 tailor ke anusaar vaigyanik prabandh is drudh vishwaas par aadhaarit he ki donon kaa hit samaan he, karmchaariyon kii samruddhi ke bina prabandhakon kii samruddhi or iske vipareet prabandhakon kii samruddhi ke bina karm shramikon kii samruddhi bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah sakati
 The work culture of the Japanese is a classic example of this situation
 japani companiyon main pitruvatt style kaa prabandh hota he
 Nothing is hidden between the manager and the workers
 shramik yadi hadtaal karte hai to vah kaale bille laga lete hai lekin prabandh kii sahanubhuti praapt karne ke liye saamaanya ghanton se bhi adhik kaary karte hai
 There should be full cooperation in labor and management in place of individualism
 yah sahyog, na ki takaraav ke siddhant kaa vistaar he
 There should be cooperation at the venue of the competition
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki donon ko ek duusare kii aavashyaktaa he
 For this it is necessary that if any constructive suggestion comes from the employees, then attention should be paid to it
 yadi unke suzav se laagat main paryaapt kami aati he to unhen iskaa puraskaar milanaa chahie
 They should be involved in the management and whenever any important decision is taken, the workers should be taken in confidence
 iske saath-saath shramikon ko bhi chahie ki vah hadtaal na karen tathaa prabandh se anuchit maang na karen
 In fact, if there will be open communication system and mutual trust, then there will be no need for labor organization
 japani companiyon ke samaan pitruvat style kaa prabandh hoga jisamen niyokta karmchaariyon kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhega
 According to Taylor, there would be almost equal division of work and responsibility between labor and management
 puure samay prabandh karmchaariyon ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaary karegaa
 Will help them, encourage and pave their way
 audyogic kaary kshamta adhikansh rup se karmchaariyon kii yogyataon par nirbhar karti he
 Scientific management also recognizes the development of employees
 vaigyanik tareeke se kaary karne ke parinamswaroop jo shreshthatam paddati viksit kii gai usko seekhney ke liye karmchaariyon kaa prashikshan aavashyak tha
 Taylor's view was that the foundation of efficiency lies in the employee selection process itself
 prayek vyakti kaa chayan vaigyanik reeti se hona chahie
 The work assigned to him should be in accordance with his physical, mental and intellectual abilities
 unki kaaryakshmata main vruddhi ke liye unako aavashyak prashikshan milanaa chahie
 The maximum efficiency and prosperity of both skilled employees will be ensured
 uparokt vivaran se yah spasht he ki tailor vyavsaay ke utpaadan main vaigyanik paddati kaa kattar samarthak tha
 The techniques set by Taylor are based on research work done during her own career / career career
 kaarkaana pranali main forman vah prabandhak hota he, jiske sidhe sarmpak main shramik pratidin aate hai
 In the first chapter of this book you read that the foreman is the lowest level tax manager and the highest class worker
 vah centre bindu hota he jiske chaaron ore puraa utpaadan niyojan, kriyanvayan evam niyantran ghumta he
 Taylor noted improvements in the execution of this role in the factory structure
 vastav main ek achche forman / paryvekshak kii yogyataon kii suchi taiyaar kii lekin paaya ki koi bhi vyakti inako puraa nahin kar sakaa isliye usne aath vyaktiyon ke madhyam se kriyaatmak formanship kaa suzav diya
 Taylor advocated separate planning and implementation
 is avadharana ko kaarkaane ke nimnatam str badha diya gaya
 This is called functional foremanship
 kaarkaana prabandhak ke adheen yojana adhikari evam utpaadan adhikari the
 Four employees were working under the planning officer, whose names are Direction Card Clerk, Program Clerk, Time and Cost Clerk, and Workshop Disciplinary
 yah chaar kramshah karmchaaree, karmchaariyon ke liye nirdesh taiyaar karenge, utpaadan kaa kaarykram taiyaar karenge, samay evam laagat suchi taiyaar karenge evam anushaasan sunishchit karenge
 The employees who will work under the production officer are - ginayak, tolinayak, repair hero and inspector
 ye kramshah kaary samay thik se taiyaar karne, shramikon dwaara mashin upkarnon ko kaary ke yogya rakhane evam kaary kii gunvattta kii jaanch karne ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Functional foremanship is an extension of the theory of labor division and specialization to the lowest level
 prayek shramik ko utpaadan kaary athwa sambandhit prakriya ke in aath formaina se aadesh lene honge
 Intelligence, education, chaturth, stability, judgment, specialized knowledge, physical efficiency and energy, honesty and good health in the foreman
 kyonki yah sabhi gun kisi ek vyakti main nahin mil sakate isliye tailor ne aath visheshgyon kii team kaa suzav diya
 Each specialist is assigned the task according to his / her own ability
 udhaaharan ke liye, jo takneekee main siddhasth hai, budhimaan hai evam sthir mastishk ke hai unako niyojan kaary saunpa ja saktaa he
 Those who are energetic and in good health can be given the task of execution
 tailor pramapikaran kaa jabardast pakshdhar tha
 According to him, the scientific method should be adopted for analysis of production methods under the Agunta Tech Rule
 sarvshereshth pranali ko pramaap ke vikaas ke liye surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he tathaa usamen or sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he jise puure sanghathan main upyog main laayaa janaa chahie
 This can be done through work study techniques which include time study, speed study, fatigue study and procedure study which are described further in this chapter
 dhyaan rahe ki vyavsaayik prakriya ke samakaleen takanic punah ejineering, camen evam mile kaa pathar kaabhi lakshya kaary kaa pramapikaran hota tha
 Standardization refers to the standard determination process for each business action
 pramapikaran prakriya, kaccha maal, samay, utpaada, mashinari, kaary paddati athwa kaary-sharton kaa ho saktaa he
 These are standard criteria to be followed during production
 pramapikaran ke uddeshy is prakaar hai- The purpose of simplification is to eliminate wasted varieties, sizes and dimensions, while standardization means to create new varieties in place of existing ones
 sarleekaran main utpaadan kii anaavashyak anekataaon ko samaapt kiya jaataa he
 This saves the cost of labor, machines and equipment
 isamen malrahit yaa kam rakhana, upkarnon kaa sampurna upyog evam aavart main vruddhi sammilit hai
 Most large companies such as Nokia, Toyota, and Microsoft have successfully implemented standardization and simplification
 apane-apane bazaar main inaki baari hissedari se yah spasht he
 Methodology The purpose of the study is to find the best method of doing the work
 kisi kaary ko karne kii kai paddatiyaan hoti hai
 There are several parameters for determining the best route
 kaccha maal praapt karne se lekar taiyaar maal ko graahak tak pahunchaane tak prayek kriya kaary paddati adhyayan ke antargat aati he
 Taylor created the concept of linking multiple verbs together through functional methodological studies
 ford motor company ne is avadharana kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya
 Even today, auto companies are adopting it
 is puri prakriya kaa uddeshy utpaadan laagat ko nunatam rakhana evam graahak ko adhiktam gunvattta evam santushti pradaan karnaa he
 Many techniques are used for this, such as process charts and operational research etc
 ek car kaa dizin taiyaar karne ke liye samuchy rekha kaa arth he parichaalan kriyaaon, karmchaariyon kaa sthaan, mashin evam kaccha maal aadi kaa kram nirdhaarit karnaa
 This is all part of some methodological study
 gati adhyayan main vibhinn mudraon kii gati, jo kisi vishesh prakaar ke kaary ko karne ke liye kii jaati he, kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jaisaa ki uthaanaa, rakhana, baithna yaa phir sthaan badalanaa aadi
 Unnecessary efforts are eliminated so that the work takes less time to complete properly
 udhaaharan ke liye, tailor evam uskaa sahyogi frank gilberth eent banane kii cheshtaaon ko 18 se 5 tak gata laae
 Taylor demonstrated that by adopting this process, productivity increased fourfold
 yadi sharir kii mudraon kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya jaae to pataa lagegaa ki- Taylor used stopwatches, various symbols and colors to identify different postures, with the help of motion studies Taylor was able to design tools that were suitable for educating workers on their use
 iske jo parinaam nikle vah vastav main adbhut the
 This standard determines the time to complete a well-defined task
 kaary ke prayek ghatak ke liye samay maapan vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By measuring several times the standard time of the entire work is determined
 samay adhyayan kii paddati kaary kii maatr evam barambharataa, parichaalan kii samay chakra evam samay maapan kii laagat par nirbhar karegi
 The purpose of time study is to determine the number of personnel, formulate suitable motivational schemes and determine the labor cost
 udhaaharan ke liye baar-baar ke avlokan se yah tay kiya gaya ki ek card board ke bakse ko taiyaar karne ke liye ek karmchaaree kaa maanak samay 20 minute he
 In this way he will prepare three boxes in one hour
 yah maanakar chalate hai ki ek shramik ek pari main 8 ghante kaary karata he
 Out of which one hour takes out lunch and rest
 is prakaar se teen bakse prati ghante kii dar se saat ghante ke kaary main vah ikkis bakse taiyaar karegaa
 Now this is the standard work of a worker
 iske anusaar mazdooree kaa nirdhaaran kiya jayega
 Any person will start feeling physically and mentally tired while working
 samay-samay par aaraam milane par vyakti aantarik bal punah praapt kar legaa tathaa purv kshamta se kaary kar sakegaa
 This will increase productivity
 thakaan adhyayan kisi kaary ko puraa karne ke liye aaraam ke antaraal kii avadhi evam barambharataa kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 For example, a plant normally operates in three shifts at an eight-hour shift
 yadi kaary ek pari main ho rahaa he to shramik ko bhojan aadi ke liye kuch aaraam kaa samay dena hoga
 If the work is heavy manual labor, the laborer will have to give a short period of rest
 jisase ki uski urja kii kshatipurti ho jaae or vah apana adhiktam yogadan de sake
 There can be many reasons for fatigue such as long working hours, inappropriate work, lack of pleasantness in relationship with your officer or poor working conditions etc
 achche kaary nishpaadan main aane vaali adchanon ko dur kar dena chahie
 Taylor was a strong advocate of the differential remuneration system
 vah kushal evam akushal karigar main antar karnaa chahta tha
 The standard duration and other criteria should be determined based on the work-study described above
 kaarigaron ko in pramaapon ke aadhaar par kushal evam akushal virgon main baanta ja saktaa he
 He wanted skilled employees to get reward
 isliye usne pramaapit kaaryon ko puraa karne ke liye bhinn tathaa pramaapit se kam karne par bhinn mazdooree dar prarambh kii
 For example, it was determined that the standard production per capita is 10 units per day and those who will achieve or exceed this standard will get wages from Rs 50 per unit while those working below it will get wages from Rs 40 per unit
 
 is prakaar se ek kushal karmchaaree ko 11×50 = 550 rupye pratidin bhugtan milegaa jabaki akushal karmchaaree, jisane ikai taiyaar kii he, ko 9 ×40 = 360 rupye pratidin milegaa
 According to Taylor, a difference of 190 rupees is sufficient motivator for an unskilled employee to do the work more optimally
 apane swayan ke anubhav se tailor ne "biupacap" naam ke karmchaaree kaa udhaaharan diya he jo bathleham steel main kaary karata tha
 He, working according to the techniques of scientific management, increased the loading of cast iron in box-car from 12-5 tons per person per day to 47 tons per day, increasing the income from $ 1-15 to $ 1-85
 Increased by 60 percent
 vaigyanik prabandh kii takneekon par ek baar phir se nigaah daalana mahatvapurn hoga kyonki yah kaarykushalta, tailor ke sabhi tareekon ko ekikrut kar sampoornataa liye hue he
 One of the best method to find efficiency is to search and the method chosen helps in determining the proper work of the day
 jo din ke uchit kaary ko puraa kar lete hai athwa usase bhi adhik kar lete hai unako dusron se alag se maanane ke liye kshatipurti kii pranali honi chahie
 This differential method should be based on the assumption that efficiency is the result of the joint efforts of both managers and workers
 isliye unhen aadhiky main hissedari par vivaad nahin karnaa chahie balki utpaadan ko simit rakhane ke sthaan par usamen vruddhi karne ke liye parsparik sahyog karnaa chahie
 It is clear that the essence of Taylor's ideas is not in the separate description of the techniques and theories of scientific management, but in the transformation of mental perception which is called 'mental revolution'
 maansik kranti karmchaaree evam prabandh ke ek duusare ke prati vyavhaar main parivartan ko kehete hai arthath pratiyogita ke sthaan par sahyog
 Both should understand that they need each other
 The goal of both should be to increase the excess
 isse kisi bhi prakaar ke andolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi
 The management should share some part of the excess among the employees
 karmchaariyon ko bhi apni puri shakti lagaani chahie jisase ki company adhikadhik laabh kamayen
 This approach will be in the interest of both the party and the company
 deergh kaal main karmchaariyon kii bhalaai hi vyavsaay kii samruddhi ko sunishchit karegi
 We can also examine the current state of scientific management
 vartmaan yug main vaigyanik prabandh ke kram main kai nayi takneekon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Operational research was developed for maximum deployment of munitions
 isi prakaar se tailor ne kramik sangyojan kii khoj kii jiskaa ford motor company ne jansadharan ke liye ‘model tii’ ke vinirmaan main safaltaapurvak prayog kiya
 This concept is now being used a lot
 vaigyanik prabandh main ekadam nayaa vikaas vinirmaan he
 Nowadays robots and computers are being used in production and other commercial activities
 in kriyaaon kaa yah vaigyanik prabandh swaroop he
 This has increased the production level

 There are three classes of temples in Dwarahat - Kachari, Maniya and Ratnadeva
 iske atirikt bahut se mandir pratimavihin hai
 The temple of Gujaradev in Dwarahat is the most important
 is nagar ko itihaas main vairatpattan tathaa lakhanpur samet kai naamon se janaa jaataa rahaa he
 According to a popular folklore of Kumaon, Dwarahat was chosen by the gods as the capital of the region, being located in the geographical center of the entire Uttarakhand region, parallel to Krishna's Dwarka in the south in beauty and grandeur
 jab is nagar kii yojana shuru hui, to nirnay liya gaya ki yahaan ramganga or kosi nadiyon kaa sangam banaaya jaae
 The gods immediately asked the Gagas river to inform Ramganga and Kosi, but Gagas, who was in a hurry all the time, did not go himself and sent a seminal tree to Ramganga, and another messenger to Kosi, But both of them could not reach there on time
 simal kaa ped chalate chalate thak kar ek jagah vishram karte hue so gaya, or jab tak vah jaagaa, ramganga givaad pahunch chuki thi
 The second messenger also did not reach Kosi on time in the affair of eating curd

 Most processes make the production of an otherwise rare material vastly cheaper in price, thus changing it into a commodity; ie the process makes it economically feasible for society to use the material on a large scales, in machinery, or a substantial amount of raw materials, in comparison to batch or craft processes
 Production of a specific material may involve more than one type of process
 Most industrial processes result in both a desired product and by-products, many of which are toxic, hazardous, or hard to deal with
 Very, very few processes are self-contained
 These may be applied on their own, or as part of a larger process
 The availability of electricity and its effect on materials gave rise to several processes for plating or separating metals
 There are several physical processes for reshaping a material by cutting, folding, joining or polishing, developed on a large scale from workshop techniques
 The physical shaping of materials by forming their liquid form using a mold
 Many materials exist in an impure form, purification, or separation provides a usable product
 Early production of iron was from meteorites, or as a by-product of copper refining
 Heating iron ore and carbon in a crucible at 1000 k produces wrought iron
 This process gained popularity during the Iron Age
 Temperatures of 1300 k were produced around the 8th century by blowing air through the heated mixture in a bloomery or blast furnace; producing a strong but brittle cast iron
 Furnaces were growing bigger, producing greater quantities; a factor expected to the Industrial Revolution
 In 1740 the temperature and carbon content could be controlled sufficiently to consistently produce steel; very strong and very workable
 The 19th century saw the development of electric arc furnaces that produced steel in very large quantities, and are more easily controlled

 kai dhade ban gayi the congress main
 aise main sampoornanand ko rajasthan kaa rajyapal bana diya gaya or chandrabhanu ko upi kaa mukhyamantri
 is bich gupta kaa kad upi kii raajnneeti main bahut zyada bad gaya tha
 mukhyamantri bananaa har tarah ke vipaksh par baari jeet thi
 isse centre ke netaaon main khalabali much gai
 ye wo daur tha jab centre main nehru kii satta ko congress ke log hi chunauti dene lage the
chandrabhanu nehru ke socialism se puri tarah prabhavit nahin the
 to nehru inako pasand nahin karte the
 par upi congress main chandrabhanu kaa itnaa raula tha ki vidhayak pehle chandrabhanu ke saamne natmastak hote the, baad main nehru ke saamne sashtaang
 nehru dint like dis
 1963 main ke kamraj ne nehru ko salaah di ki kuch logon ko chhodkar saare congress ke mukhyamantriyon ko rizoin kar dena chahie
 jisase ki state sarkaron ko phir se orgenise kiya ja sake
 kaha gaya ki kuch din ke liye pad chhod dijie
 party ke liye kaam karnaa he
 par chandrabhanu kii najar main ye tha ki ye sara game isliye ho rahaa he ki nehru jisko pasand nahin karte, wo chalaa jaae
 unhone manaa kar diya
 par inako samajha liya gaya ki ye kuch dinon kii baat he
 phir se aapako bana diya jaayegaa mukhyamantri

 Waiting for Godot is an absurd drama composed by Samuel Beckett, in which the two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait endlessly and fruitlessly for another fictional character, Gadot
 is naatak ke premier se ab tak godot kii anupasthiti va anya pahaluon ko lekar anek vyakhyaayen kii ja chuki hai
 It has also been called "the most influential English language drama of the twentieth century"
 asal main vatting for godot baket ke hi french naatak en atendent godot kaa unke swayan ke dwaara hi kiya gaya angreji anuwaad he tathaa angreji main ise do bhaagon kii traasadee-kamedi kaa up-sheershak diya gaya he"
 french mul rachana 9 oktober 1948 va 29 janvari 1949 ke bich kii gai
 Its stage premiere took place on 5 January 1953 in a theater called Theater de Babylon
 iske nirmaataa roger blin the, jinhonen isamen pozo kii bhoomika bhi adaa kii
 Waiting for Godot is a description of two days of the lives of both the main characters, where they are both in vain and fruitless waiting for the arrival of a person named Godot
 ve kehete hai ki ve use jaanate hai parantu swayan hi kah jate hai ki yadi vah aayaa to use pahchaan nahin paayengen, isse sabit ho jaataa he ki vah use nahin pahachaanate
 is pratiksha main khud ko vyast rakhane ke liye ve khaanaa, sona, vaad-vivaad karnaa, khel-khelnaa, vyaayaam karnaa, aapas main hat badalanaa or yahan tak ki aatmahatya kaa vichaar karnaa jaise sabhi kaary kar daalate hai arthath aisa kuch bhi kaary jisase us "bhayaavah sannaate ko dur rakhaa ja sake"
 In the beginning of the play, Estragon is unsuccessfully trying to remove the shoe from his foot
 haar kar vah budbudata he "karne ko kuch nahin he"
 is vaakya ko pakadakar vladimir vichaar karne lagata he, maano 'kuch nahin' vastav main koi bada kaary he jise unhen saare naatak ke dauraan karnaa he
 When Estragon succeeds in removing the shoe, he looks inside it, and finds nothing there
 Just before this, Vladimir peeks into his hat
 yah pratimaan saare naatak ke dauraan doharaaya gaya he
 Both main characters speak of remorse during the play, in which they mention the two thieves hanging on the cross with the Lord Jesus
 saath hi yah bhi charchaa karte hai ki chaar main se keval ek evanjalist ne bataaya ki do main se ek chor ko bachaa liya gaya tha
 This discussion was one of many biblical discussions during the play, which are evident in the play
 isse yah abhas hota he ki naatak kaa mul va chipa hua vishay ishwar-milan va nirvana he
 When both the main characters feel Godot is close, they shout with joy, 'we have survived'
 vladimir samay-samay par estrogan kii samvaad akushalta se krodhit hota he
 For example he says "hey Gogo can you send the ball back to me at least once?" With emotion, he is motivating Estragon or Gogo to improve his dialogue black
 gogo saare naatak main samvaad kala main sangharsh karata prathit hota he tathaa vladimir unke aapasi va anya logon, donon ke bich sanvaadon main usase agrani rahata he
 In between, Vladimir loses his temper with Gogo, but most of the time there is an intimacy between them, which is evident in their friendly embrace and support of each other
 estrogan darshak ddeergha kii ore dekhtaa he ore kahata he ki kya berang mahole he
 He wants to get away from there, but is reminded that they are waiting
 haalanki donon paatr is baat par sahamat nahin ho pate ki godot ke milane kaa niyat samay va sthaan aaj or ab hi he
 It is not even clear to them what day it is today
 puure naatak main samay yaa to baadhit he yaa khandit, athwa uskaa astitv hi nahin he
 On the whole occasion, they have full knowledge that they are about to meet near a tree
 vah ped nikat hi vidyaman he
 Estragon falls asleep but Vladimir doesn't pick him up because he doesn't want Gogo to wake up and bore him with his dream account
 Estragon wakes up and wants to listen to an old ridiculous anecdote with a prostitute whom Vladimir begins to narrate but has to take a toilet break in between
 vaapis aane par vah yah kissa madhya main hi tyaag detaa he or estrogan se poochta he ki vah samay vyateet karne ke liye or kya karen
 estrogan prastaav detaa he ki ve suuli par latak sakate hai, parantu yah vichaar yah soch kar tyaag diya jaataa he ki yadi donon main se ek batch gaya to ek kaa jivan ati kshtmay hoga
 ant main donon kuch na karne kaa surakshit maarg chunate hai
 Estragon says "this is the safe way", and asks what he will do when Godot comes
 Vladimir does not even think about this for once, and he is only able to say: "nothing is sure"
 jab estrogan kahata he ki use bhukh lagi he to vladimir use ek gaajar detaa he
 Estragon does not like it much but eats it
 samay vyateet karne kaa yah upaay bhi samaapt ho jaataa he or estrogan kah uthta he hamaare paas karne ko abhi kuch nahin he
 There is a new twist in the wait for both the characters when Pojo and his laden slave Lucky pass through there
 "ek dardpurn rudan " ke saath lucky ke aagaman kii ghoshnaa hoti he
 a rope is tied around his neck
 vah aadhi stage paar kar jaataa he jiske baad doosraa chor pakade pojo najar aata he
 Pozo shouts at his slave Lucky and calls him a "boar", but he is civil to Estragon and Vladimir
 yah donon pehle pojo ko hi godot samaj baithte hai or uske hathi va asabhy vyavhaar kii ore dhyaan nahin dete
 godot samajhe jane par pojo thodaa chidh jaataa he
 He tells them that "everyone has equal rights on the road"
 iske baad pojo chikan va sharaab kaa seven karke vishram kaa vichaar karata he
 When he eats and starts throwing bones, Estragon catches him
 isse vladimir atyant glani kaa anubhav karata he
 Pojo says that these bones are for Lucky and Estragon will have to ask Lucky
 Estragon asks Lucky and Lucky mumbles silently
 ise "naa" maanakar estrogan haddiyaan grahan kar letaa he
 Vladimir tortures Pozo for ruthless behavior towards Lucky, but Pozo ignores him
 Both the main characters ask Lucky that when Pojo is not getting him to do any other work then why does Lucky not put his burden down
 Upon hearing this, Pojo says that Lucky is trying to please him, so that he does not sell it again
 Lucky starts crying after hearing this
 pojo use roomaal thamata he, parantu jab estrogan uske aansu ponchney kii koshish karata he, lucky uske takhnon par chot martha he
 Before leaving, Pojo says what he can give them to entertain him
 estrogan dhan maang letaa he jis par vladimir thodaa krodhit hokar kahata he ki pojo lucky ko thodaa sochane or naach karne kii anumati degaa
 Lucky's dance is complete and chaotic
 vladimir dwaara sir par topi rakhe jane se shuru hui uski "soch-prakriya" keval ek achaanak neend se jaagrit hue vyakti kaa vyarth samvaad he
 Lucky's monologue is initially okay but later becomes completely incomprehensible and can only happen when Vladimir removes his hat from his head
 lucky vaapis das ban jaataa he or aadeshaanusaar saamaan sametane lagata he
 Pozo and Lucky go away
 naatak ke donon bhaagon ke ant main ek ladkaa aata he jo ki godot kaa doot maanya kiya jaataa he
 He says that "godot will come tomorrow, not this evening
" In the conversation, Vladimir asks the boy if he even came yesterday, which shows that both characters have been waiting for Godot since time immemorial and that it will continue for eternity in the future as well
 After the boy leaves, he also thinks of leaving but does not make any effort towards it
 This happens at the end of both parts, the curtain falls
 duusare bhaag kaa aarambh vladimir ke dwaara geet gunagunaane se hota he jo ki ek kute se sambandhit he or jisase naatak ke uddeshy kaa vyapak gyaan hota he
 This song also shows that the play has an atmosphere of traditional music, entertainment and festivities
 is naatak main kukkur jati se sambandhit sandarbhon evam udaahranon main se keval ek he
 This also shows that Vladimir is aware of the fact that the world he is entangled in is festive
 He begins to explain that although there is some evidence of definite homogenous development in his world, he is basically repeating the days of personal life and the fact
 vladimir ke geet ke vishay main ujin web ne likhaa he: "geet kaa kaal samroop se gatisheel to nahin he, parantu vah us antaheen sthiti ke prati sankethik he jiskaa ekmaatr shaashvat ant hai: mrityu"
 Estragon once again states that he spent the night in a ditch and was beaten by "10 people" - albeit with no bruises
 vladimir usko vriksh main ho rahe mausami badlaavon ke bare main bataata he or pichley din kii gatividhiyon ke vishay main bhi, parantu estrogan ko kuch adhik yaad nahin aata
 vladimir pojo or lucky kaa naam letaa he parantu estrogan ko keval haddiyaan or takhne kaa dard hi yaad aata he
 Vladimir realizes that if Estragon shows his leg, he can remember it
 badi mushkil se estrogan taang dikhaata he jis par ghaav ab gaharaa ho chalaa he
 Vladimir realizes that Estragon is not wearing any shoes
 gaajar to samaapt ho chali he so vladimir estrogan ko shaljam tathaa muuli kaa chunaav karne ko kahata he
 Estragon chooses radish but returns due to being black
 phir estrogan sone kaa prayaas karata he thik pichley din vaali bhrun ke samakaksh avasthaa main
 vladimir use lori sunaata he
 Vladimir sees a Lucky Wali hat and thinks of wearing it
 isse ek hat parivartan prakriya shuru ho jaati he
 They try to follow Pojo and Lucky, but Estragon doesn't remember whether he met Pozo and Lucky or not
 He simply obeys Vladimir's orders
 ve donon ek duusare ko gaaliyaan dete hai or phir sulah bhi kar lete hai
 After that they try to do some physical tremors and a yogasana, but both fail
 pojo or lucky kaa aagaman phir hota he
 Pozo is blinded and says that Lucky is dumb
 rassi ab kaaphi choti ho gai he or pojo kii bajaay ab lucky agrani maardarshak bhoomika main he
 Pozo has lost his sense of time and says that he does not remember that he met Estragon and Vladimir the previous day
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki aaj kii gatividhiyaan bhi use kal yaad nahin rahengi
 At one time, all of them fall on top of each other
 estrogan sochataa he ki or khaanaa nikalwane yaa lucky dwaara maare jane kaa badla lene kaa yahi mauka he
 There is a long discussion on this
 pojo unako dhan dene kii peshkash karata he parantu vladimir sochataa he ki un donon ke rahane se man bahala rahata he or ve donon bhi godot kii lambii pratiksha main saath dene main majaboor ho jate hai
 In the end, however, everyone stands up
 bhaag 1 main pojo ek dambhi vyakti tha parantu ab andhepan ke baad vah thodaa paripakv ho gaya he
 After he leaves, Vladimir interprets his last words: "the place of birth is also near a crematorium, there is a moment of light and then it becomes night"
 lucky or pojo chale jate hai
 The same boy comes again and repeats today, do not wait for Godot, but tomorrow he will definitely come
 In desperation, both of them attempt suicide by hanging from Estragon's belt, but they break with the weight of both
 estrogan kii paint gir jaati he parantu use tab tak pataa nahin chalata jab tak vladimir use nahin bataata
 ve nirnay karte hai ki ve kal majboot rassi laayenge or punah aatmahatya kaa prayaas karenge, yadi godot nahin aata
 They decide to leave again but do not make any effort of it
 baket ne naatak kii dhara ke alaava charitron ke vishay main kuch vishesh prakaash nahin daalaa he
 Beckett had said that once Sir Ralph Richardson had asked for detailed information about Pozo, Vladimir and other characters in his most influential manner
 tab unhone sirf itnaa kaha tha
 


 that only those who have written about them know in the play
 "adhik jaananaa hota to pehle hi naatak main likh detaa or yah baat sabhi paatro par lagu he
 " jab baket ne naatak likhnaa shuru kiya tab uske mastishk main vladimir va estrogan kii koi chhavi nahin thi
 Nor has he told or shown them anywhere
 roger blin ne bataaya: "baket unki awaajen sunata tha, magar apane paatro ko vivaranit nahin kar paata tha
 He used to say]: 'the only thing i know is that both the main characters are ballers
 "' "bowler hat baket ke grih nagar foxrock main purushon kaa ek prachlit paridhaan tha
 As a child, his mother used to make him wear a beret and inspire him to wear a bowler hat, which was also worn by Beckett's father
 " Nothing has been written about the physical structure of both characters; Although it appears that Vladimir was heavier in both
 bowler hat va anya haasyaaspad pahaluon ke kaaran aadhunik darshak unki tulana laurel va hardi kaa prabhaav saafe ho jaataa he
 In an article titled 'the Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies', Gerold Mast wrote about 'using the new format to show the truth indirectly'
 Beckett later made special comments on Laurel and Hardy in his 1953 novel Watt
 In that novel, Beckett addressed a healthy bush as 'a hardy laurel' or 'a strong laurel'
 vladimir lagbhag saare naatak main khadaa rahata he jab ki estrogan aksar baith jaataa he va so bhi jaataa he
 "estragon is calm while Vladimir is restless
" Vladimir looks at the sky and thinks about religious and philosophical subjects
 udhar estrogan saadhaaran purushon kii tarah rosemara kii baton main ulajhaa rahata he
 He is not able to go higher than things like eating and relieving pain
 He is also a bit forgetful but he also remembers being reminded of Vladimir
 udhaaharan ke liye vladimir ne usase poocha "kya tumhen gospel yaad he?" is par estrogan kahata he use us pavitra sthaan ke rangeen naqshe yaad he or vah apana mrit sagar par apana honeymoon manane vaala tha
 In fact his short-term memory was weak and he was probably suffering from Alzheimer's
 udhar al alvarez likhata hai: "shaayad yahi bhulakkadpan donon kii dosti bane rahane main sahaayak hua
 Estragon forgets, reminds Vladimir and thus lapse of time
 ye donon pachaas saal se saath hai parantu pojo ke poochne par unhone apni aayu bataane se inkaar kar diya
 There are many problems in Vladimir's life too, but he is tough in both
 "vladimir kaa dard haalanki maansik he
 That is why he also changes his hat from Lucky because he wants to discuss with others
 " During the entire play, the two address each other as "DD" and "gogo", although a boy also called Vladimir as "mr
 Albert"
 Beckett initially chose the name Levi for Estragon, but when Pozo asks, he calls his name "mágragor Adre"
 saath hi vah french naam "katule " yaa "katulas" bhi bulaayaa jaataa rahaa, khaskar pehle "fabar sanskaran" main
 america sanskaran main yah "adam" ban gaya
 Beckett only said that they were "bored with cutaneous"
 vivian marsar naamak ek aalochak ne kaha ki vatting for godot naatak ne ek asambhav lagane vaali baat ko sambhav karne kaa kirtiman sthapit kiya he
 a play in which nothing happens, but the audience still concentrates and watch it
 yahi nahin, isamen doosraa bhaag pehle bhaag kaa hi thodaa bhinn rup he, atah baket ne yah ajooba likh daalaa he jahaan do baar kuch nahin hota
" - akhbaar ne apane is sanskaran main donon mukhya paatro kii bhashaa par sawaal uthaaye the or likhaa tha ki "shaayad baket ne kataaksh kiya, aap kaise kah sakate hai ki ve pi
ech
di
 nahin hai? 'tum kaise jaanate ho ki unhone pi
ech
di
 nahin kiya hai?' unka jawaab tha " unka ateet acha rahaa hoga, haalanki keval itnaa gyaat he, ve ek baar effil tower gaye the, va ek baar rise nadi ke kinare angoor todane
 pehle natya manchan, jis par baket ne swany najar rakhi thi, main donon mukhya paatro ke vastra gande to nahin, magar thode saadhaaran he
 On the other hand, Vladimir flares up a little when Estragon asks for bags and bones, so that it is known that he had a feeling of behavior
 " Although Beckett did not write anything about the background of the characters, the actors working in the play have found their inspiration
 jin martin kii ek doctor mitra marthe gotier, salpetrire aspataal main kaam karti thi tathaa martin ne usase poocha: "'suno, marthr, is naatak main ek khaas tarah kii aawaaj kaa zikr he uskaa vivaran or vyakhya kahan mil sakati he?' bataaya: is bimaari main marij ke haath, pair kaanpane lagate he or dhire-dhire vah kaanpe bina bol bhi nahin paata
 maine tab kaha mujhe yahi chahie
 baket va raajar thode kam aashwast the magar phir bhi taiyaar ho gaye
 "when Martin told Beckett that he would play Lucky's character like a Parkinson's patient, Beckett said" of course
 "beckett also mentioned that Marco had the same disease
 parantu phir atisheeghra hi vishay badal diya
" When Beckett was asked why Lucky was named so, he said that he was "lucky that he has no aspirations"
 kuch aakalnon main yahan tak bhi kaha gaya ki kyonki "didi or gogo kaa rishta purnataya vivaranit yaa sthapit nahin tha", lucky va pojo unheen kaa ek praaroop hai
 Pozo's dominance in Pozo and Lucky's relationship was virtually meaningless
 dhyaan se dekhne par gyaat hota he ki lucky kaa prabhaav sadaa hi adhik tha
 He danced and even thought of removing Pozo's emptiness
 isliye pratham baar se hi pojo hi asal main lucky kaa gulam tha
 Pozo also acknowledges that Lucky has given him culture, humility and reasoning
 usamen vakrapatutaa swaabhaavik rup se aa gai
 Pozo's party account is a good example: when his memory goes away, he also loses this rhetoric
 pojo ke vishay main keval itnaa gyaat hua he ki vah apane das lucky ko bechney meley main ja rahaa tha
 He considers himself a high-ranking landlord when he is only an arrogant and selfish person who behaves rudely to others
 uskaa pipe dublin kii sabase mashhoor tambaakoo company cap and petersan kaa bana he, 
 pojo apni pipe ko "brir" kahata tha jabaki estrogan use "dudin" or isi se donon ke saamaajik va aarthik antar kaa pataa chalata tha
 Pozo considered his memory somewhat weak, but it was because he was self-sufficient
 baket ke shabdon main "pojo asurakshit maansikta se grast tha
 That is why he used to debate in every subject and used to behave the same in every task
 pojo lucky ko ek lambii rassi se niyantrit karata tha or lucky ke tanik bhi dhire hone par rassi ko jor jor se jatke detaa tha
 Lucky was completely in his possession and played his sack "like a loyal dog"
 " peeth par baari boj uthaane main vah nahin hichkichaata tha
 Lucky only speaks once in the entire play, that too when Pozo asks him to think for Vladimir and Estragon
 pojo or lucky saath saalon se saath hai or is antaraal main unka rishta kaaphi bighad gaya he
 Lucky was always wise with Pojo, but with age he became a hater
 uski "soch-prakriya" uski buddhi tathaa uskaa ghatiya "naach" vriddhavastha kaa krur parichaayak he
 Lucky always remained loyal to Pozo despite his cruel behavior
 In the second part also when Pozo suddenly becomes blind, Lucky does not leave him and becomes a guide
 unka rishta maan ek rassi ke jod se kahin badhkar he thik jaise didi or gogo "godot ke kaalpanik" madhyam se jude hai
 This is what Beckett said to American director Alan Schneider: "an actor has to be a psychopath and the actor has to embody a bit of insanity to play his character
" "naatak ke anuwaad main


 baket ke sabhi french chizon ko nihit karne kaa satat prayaas kiya or sabhi angreji naamon va sthanon ko lucky se jod diya
 baket kaa maananaa tha ki lucky naam kaa angreji se gahan naata he
 " paatro main keval ek ladke kaa zikr he
 In the first part a local boy reassures Vladimir that he is seeing DD for the first time and that he did not come yesterday
 vah bataata he ki vah mistar godot ke liye bakriyaan charaata he
 It also states that his brother, whom Godot beats heavily, grazes sheep
 haalanki godot donon ko bhojan pradaan karata he va apane charaagaah main rahane kii anumati bhi detaa he
 In part two, the boy assures Vladimir that the person who arrived the previous day was not him, this is his first arrival
 jab vladimir usase poochta he ki godot kya karata he to ladkaa kahata he, "mahashay, kuch nahin
" ladkaa yah bhi kahata he ki shaayad godot kii safed dadhi he
 There is also mention of a sick brother of a boy in the talks, but it is not clear whether this brother is part one boy or some other
 godot kii pahchaan par anekon vaad vivaad hue hai
 "when Colin Duckworth asked Beckett directly whether Pozo was Godot, Beckett replied: 'no
 It seems but it is untrue
 "' "when Roger Blinn asked what the character of Godot is synonymous with, Beckett said it originated with Godillo, the Godse, the French abusive word for shoes, because feet have an important place in the play
 baket adhiktar godot ke vishay main yahi vyakhya karte the
 " "ek baar baket ne peter woodthorp se kaha ki ve paatr ko godot naam dene par ab thodaa pachhataa rahen hai kyonki bahut se darshakon ne ise god athwa bhagwaan se jod kar anekon bhrantiyaan utpann kar di he
 "I told Richardson that if i meant God, i would not have named God, Godot
 That has disappointed Richardson
" But Beckett also once admitted, "if i say i am not aware of the meaning of the word Godot, then it seems an insincere thing
" main bhalee bhaanti jaanata hoon ki anek log ise 'god' yaa ishwar kaa hi rup maanate hai
 But remember that i wrote this play in French, and even if this thought was somewhere in my subconsciousness, i never came across it directly
 " yah ek mjedaar kathan tha kyonki baket ne kai baar kaha tha ki upchetana man se likhte hai yahan tak ki likhte hue ek samadhi jaisi avasthaa main chale jate hai
 Like Beckett's other works, the play has no bicycle, but Hay Kenner, in his essay "the Cartesian Center," wrote that Beckett once said on the subject of Godot that Godot is a veteran cyclist and a bald and perpetual man
 is
 saath hi vah rashtriya va nagar kii pratispardhaon main aksar ek adhikari ke rup main najar aata he
 His maiden name is unknown but the surname is Godieu which is pronounced Godot
 haalanki yah naatak trek cycle res ke vishay main nahin he parantu baket french cyclist raajar godot ke prashansak the tathaa rubex ke velodrome main baahar uski pratiksha kar chuke the
 Only one of the two boys survived the beating, ”beckett also jokingly says, leaving one leg of Estragon
 " In Britain and Ireland, the pronunciation of the word Godot emphasizes the first syllable, / ˈɡɒdoʊ / ; While in North America on another syllable, / ɡəˈdoʊ / 
 Beckett, however, considered the English pronunciation to be correct
 isamen tii mook he
 Born in Ireland, Beckett had a good knowledge of the Irish language
 irish gaulik main, "go dio" ke do arth hai "sadaa ke liye" or "lambey samay ke liye"
 likhte samay shaayad baket ne is shabd kaa prayog kinchit vyangyatmak kone se kiya he kyonki vah jaanate the ki angrej or french darshak shaayad hi un shadjaal ko samaj paayenge
 Both acts have only one scene
 do aadmi ek deshi sadak par ek ped ke paas intjaar kar rahe hai
 The men are of unspecified origin, although it is clear that they are not English in terms of nationality
 According to the script, Estragon sits on a low mound but in practical terms - like Beckett's 1975 German film - it is generally a stone
 pehle ank main ped khaali he
 In the second issue, some leaves appear while according to the script it is the next day
 dimag ke liye bahut kam vivaran uplabdh hote hai "liyu veg kaa vichaar jo ek aisa sthaan he jiskaa vistrut vivaran nahin diya janaa chahie"
 Alan Schneider once suggested putting the play in a whirlwind - Pozo is often referred to as a ringmaster - but Beckett consulted opposite to him: "from the point of view of his ignorance i agree with this cycle Am not and i think Godot needs a very closed box
 " unhone ek baar "manch ke farsh kii salaakhon kii dhoomil chaaya" kii bhi apeksha kii thi lekin ant main unhone is "prakatikaran" ke khilaaf faisla kiya
 DD and Gogo appear to bounce several times in their 1975 Schiller Theater production, to some extent in James Knowlson's description "like birds trapped in the ropes of the net"
 didi or gogo keval isliye funs jate hai kyonki ve abhi bhi is avadharana se chipte hue hai ki aazaadee sambhav he; aazaadee kaid kii tarah dimag kii ek avasthaa he
 According to Beckett, one of the sources of inspiration for this play was a painting by Caspar David Frederick
 baket ke saath 1824 kii main and vuman contemplatting da moon naamak painting ko dekhakar rubi kohan yaadon main kho jaati hai jinhone "spasht rup se ghoshnaa karte hue kaha, 'aapako maaloom he, yahi vatting for godot kaa strot tha
 "" He may have been confused about the two paintings because on other occasions he drew the attention of friends to Two Men Contemplating the Moon of 1819, in which two men wearing a cloak were looking at a full moon It was surrounded by black branches of large and leafless trees
 " donon maamle main painting kaaphi had tak ek jaisi thi isliye unka sakshyankan donon par ek samaan lagu ho sakati he
 However, some sources consider the conversation between Suzanne deschevaux-dumesnil and Beckett in Rusillon to be the inspiration of this work
 baket ne jeri tolmar dwaara liye gaye ek neuyork post saakshaatkaar main is baat ko sweekaar kiya
 Ruby Cohan describes Beckett's play writing as "an escape of the increasingly autocratic interiority of the fictional trilogy" - for which she references Beckett's Molloy, Malone Dyes, and The Unnamable; Beckett has claimed that he "began writing Godot as a sabbatical to get away from the terrible prose he was writing at the time
" " "since it is so nude, so original, that it invites every kind of social and political and religious interpretation," Normand Berling wrote in a tribute to an autumn 1999 play, "with which Beckett himself was referred to various sects Was associated with ideas, various movements and ideologies
 unki spasht vyakhya karne ke liye kiye gaye prayaas safal nahin hue hai lekin aisa karne kii ichha swaabhaavik he jab unka saamana kisi lekhak se hota he jinaki alpavaadi kala moolbhoot vaastaviktaa tak pahunchati he
 The ‘less’ compels us to search for ‘more’ and the need to talk about Godot and Beckett has resulted in an ever-increasing burden of books and articles
 " Throughout the Waiting for Godot the reader or viewer may encounter religious, philosophical, traditional, psychoanalytic and life-related - especially wartime - references
 kuch aise anusthanaatmak pahalu or tatv hai jinhen sidhe wadevil se liya gaya he or ve jaise hai unase adhik banane main khatra he: arthath keval sanrachanaatmak suvidhaayen, avatar jinamein lekhak apane kaalpanik paatro ko sthapit karata he
 The play has "used many typical forms and situations, all of which encapsulate themselves in both humor and compassion
" " baket film ke aarambhik nots main is tathy ko acchhee tarah se spasht karte hai: "uparokt tathy se kisi bhi sachai kaa koi lenadena nahin he jise keval sanrachanaatmak or naatakeey suvidha kaa naam diya gaya he
 "he made another critical comment on Lawrence Harvey, stating that" his work does not depend on experience - there is no record of experience
 beshak aap iskaa istemaal karte hai"
 Beckett immediately grew tired of the "infinite misconception"
 bahut pehle 1955 main unhone tippanee kii thi ki "mujhe samaj main nahin aata he ki log ek choti si baat ko itnaa bada kyon bana dete hai
 "he was expecting nothing more than clueless clues, though:" Peter Woodthrop one day asked him in a taxi what the play was about: "it's symbiotic, Peter; it's symbiotic," Beckett replied
 baket ne 1975 main shiller theatre ke liye naatak kaa nirdesan kiya
 Although he supervised several productions, this was the first time that he had complete control this time
 walter esmus unke eemaandaar yuva sahaayak nirdeshak the
 This production or presentation was not natural
 baket ne samajhaayaa, It is a game, everything is a game
 jab unamem se chaaron jameen par lete hue hon tab use prakritik dhang se sambhala nahin ja saktaa
 use kritrim rup se, ballat kii tarah karnaa padataa he
 Otherwise everything becomes a copy, a copy of reality
 It should be clear and transparent, not dry
 It is a game played for survival
 " Over the years, Beckett has clearly realized that to a large extent Godot's success was related to the fact that it was open to a wide variety of reading and was not necessarily a bad thing
 baket ne khud " godot ke sabase prasiddh mishrit jati vaali prastutiyon main se ek kii sweekruti di thi jise uniwarsity of kep toun ke baxtor theatre main pradarshit kiya tha jiskaa nirdesan donald hovaarth ne kiya tha jisamen do kaale abhinaytaon jon kani or winston natshona ne didi or gogo kii bhoomika nibhaai thi; pojo or lucky kii bhoomika do gore abhinaytaon bill flin or peter picholo ne nibhaai thi 
 baxtor production ko aksar ek spasht raajnneetik prastuti ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he jabaki vastav main is par bahut kam jor diya gaya tha
 Although the reaction was shown that the play cannot be taken as a political metaphor in any way, it still contains elements that are relevant to any local situation in which one person is exploited or tortured by another person being done
 " "it was seen as a metaphor for the Cold War" or French resistance to the Germans
 graahak haisel likhte hai ki, "aisa lagata he ki pojo or lucky kaa pravesh mukhyabhumi britain ke ireland ke nazariye ke ek roopak se adhik kuch nahin he jahaan samaaj ab tak ek laalchee sattarudh abhijaat varg dwaara abhishpt he jabaki majdoor varg ko niskriy or har baat se anibhigya rakhaa gaya he
 " film pariyojna par baket kii tarah jodi ko aksar irish uccharan ke saath pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Some feel that this is an inevitable result of Beckett's rhythm and vocabulary but is not specified in the text
 kisi bhi haal main ve angreji bhandar kaa hissaa nahin hai: naatak main ek jagah estrogan "shant" shabd kaa angreji uccharan kaa majaak udaata he or veshyalay main angrej kii kahani" kaa anand letaa he
 "bernard Ducor DD develops a trilogy of theories in Gogo and the Absent Godot based on the use of trinity psychology descriptions and onomastic techniques in Sigmund Freud's The Ego and the Id
" deukor abhaav ke aadhaar par paatro ko paribhaashit karte hai" tarksangat go-go adhure ahankaar ko moort rup pradaan karata he, laapata khushi kaa siddhant: go- go
 di-di - jo adhik sahaj prakruti kaa or tarkahin he - ko tarksangat siddhant ke pichde id yaa todphod ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Godot fulfills the function of the Maha-ego or moral standards
 pojo or lucky mukhya paatro ke punrariti maatr hai
 Ducor finally sees Beckett's play as a metaphor for the futility of man's existence when liberation from an outside entity is expected and denied by introspection of itself
 "aatma ke chaar pahaluon yaa chaar theth vyaktitvon ko do jodiyon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he: ahankaar or chaaya, vyaktitv or aatma kii chhavi 
 chaaya vah paatr he jisamen ahankaar ke tale dabi hamaari sabhi tuchh bhavanaaen shaamil hoti hai
 Lucky serves as the polar antonym of the shadow autocratic Pozo, the prototype of rich normalcy, who progressively controls and taunts his subordinate, thus symbolizing the oppression of unconscious shadows from autocratic arrogance
 pehle ank main lucky kaa ekalaap damit achetna kii ek dhara kii ek misaal ke rup main dikhaai detaa he kyonki use apane maalik ke liye "sochane" kii anumati he
 Apart from the aromatic herb tarragon, the name estragon has another meaning: "estragon" is a homogeneous form of the female hormone estrogen
 This leads us to identify the female image of the anima, the soul of Vladimir
 yah estrogan kii kavy pravriti, uski samvedansheeltaa or sapanom, uske tarkahin mizaaj ke bare main bataata he
 Vladimir appears as a complementary Mardana theory or perhaps as a contemplative type of rational personality
 vyapak taur par kaha jaataa he ki astitvvaadiyon ke vichaar se kuch aise moulik prashn hai jiskaa prayek manushya se saamana hota he agar ve apane vyaktiparak astitv ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 Those questions include questions like death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in that existence
 kaaphi had tak astitvvaad ke siddhant is baat par jor dete hai ki sachetan vaastaviktaa bahut jatil hoti he or isamen koi "uddeshy" yaa saarvbhaumik drushti se gyaat mulya kaa abhaav hota he: vyakti ko ise sweekaar karke or chhodkar, na ki bas iske bare main baat karke yaa man main isaki kalpana karke, mulya kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie
 yahan is naatak ko in sabhi muddon ko sparsh karata hue dekha ja saktaa he
 Most of Beckett's works, including Godot's, are considered by philosophers and literary scholars to be part of the Theater of the Absurd movement, a form of theater that originated from the libertarian philosophy of Albert Camus
 nirarthakwaad khud astitvvaad ke paaramparik kathanon kii ek shakha he jiske agradoot sorain kircguard the or jo yah maanata he ki brahmand main nihit arth ke acchhee tarah se maujuud hone ke baavjood maanav jati maansik yaa darshanik seemaa ke kisi rup kii vajah se iskaa pataa lagane main aksham he
 Thus humanity is cursed to face the absolute futility of existence in the absence of the Absurd or inner purpose
 thik didi or gogo ke vishesh rup se swaarthee or kathor hone ke baad ladkaa yah bataane aata he ki godot nahin aa rahaa he
 The boy can be seen representing humility and hope followed by a rising personality and character deliberately abandoning his sense of mercy and in this case the young Pozo and Lucky may be involved
 is prakaar godot main dayaa kaa bhav he or vah apane vaade ke anusaar prati din pahunchane main vifal ho jaataa he
 No one cares that a boy has been beaten
 is vyakhya main vidmbana yah he ki keval unke dilon ko dayavan banaakar hi ped ke paas intjaar kar rahe paatr aage bad sakate hai or godot kaa intjaar karnaa band kar sakate hai
 a lot can be read in Beckett's inclusion of the story of the two thieves in Luke 23: 39–43, and then discusses regrets
 ekant ped ko chrishchiyan cross ke pratinidhi ke rup main yaa vastav main jivan vriksh ke rup main dekhnaa aasaan he
