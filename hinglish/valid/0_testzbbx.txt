sarkaar ne karodon rupaye unki madad se arier ke bachaa liye
naidilli
 The anger of the central employees over the report of allowances did not remain when the person was most trusted by them
 eaiaraf ke mahaamantri shivagopal ne bhale hi kuch mudhon par sarkaar kii tarif kii ho lekin isse karmchaariyon ke andar yah baat baith gai ki vah sarkaar kii haa main haa mila rahe
 Many employees told the railway station that they had stabbed the back of the employees and they had a secret agreement with the government, which is why the government saved crores of rupees with their help
 vahiin duusari ore enefiaar ne is report kii aalochana kii he
 The anger of the Central Government employees on the allowances is not being called

 But he made a mistake here due to his cleverness
 sarkaar ne kisi level nahin balki awaas bhatte kii ek nunyatam daren tay kin thim, isamen kisi level kaa ullekh nahin kiya tha
 The government had clearly stated that the employees would not get 1800-3600 and less than 5400 housing allowance
 ab jis 10-20-30 kii vah baat kar rahe hai kya vah bataa sakate hai ki anya clasifoid shahar main level 6 ke karmchaaree ko kitna awaas bhatta milegaa? ham aapako bataa den ki is muddhe par shivagopal mishra kaa daawa puri tarah se tathyon se pare hai
 The minimum salary in Level 6 is 35400
 is par aath pratishat awaas bhatte kii dar se kul 2832 rupaye karmchaaree ko milane chaiye lekin sarkaar ne iske liye nunyatam dar tay kii he uske anusaar is level ke karmchaaree ko 3600 rupaye awaas bhatta milegaa
 Actually, he tried to mislead the employees once again, but this time his ingenuity got caught easily
 kai karmchaariyon ne soshal media par unke khilaaf jamkar bhadaas nikaali or aise aise shabdon kaa prayog kiya ki vah inhe pard bhi nahin sakate hai
 The anger of the employees is going to be very expensive for them, it has now become certain

 at: kuch vidvan samudragupta kaa hi doosraa naam 'kaach' maanakar ukt sikkon ko usee kaa ghoshit karte hai
 But it can not be called right
 samudragupta ke sikkon par uskaa naam 'samudr' miltaa he na ki 'kaach'
 Secondly, the Chakradhwaja symbol is not found on the coins of Samudragupta or any other Gupta ruler except Kach
 haal main ramgupta naamak shaasha kii kuch tamramudraon ke milane se tathaa uskaa naam sahitya evam anya pramaanon se gyaat hone ke kaaran kuch log isi ramgupta ko kaach samajhate hai

 In Indian classical music, two tones in each raga are considered important
 sabase mahatvapurn swar ko vaadi swar kehete hai or uske baad duusare sabase mahatvapurn swar ko sanvaadi swar kehete hai
 The importance of the conversational tone is less than that of the vocalist but it contributes significantly to the plaintiff to clarify the movement of the raga
 raag kaa dwitiya mahatvapurn swar hota he sanvaadi
 It is used less than the plaintiff but more than other vowels
 ise vaadi swar kaa sahaayak yaa raag kaa mantri swar bhi kehete hai
 Vadi and Samvadi have a distance of 4-5 vowels
 jaise agar kisi raag kaa vaadi swar he re to sanvaadi shaayad dha yaa ni ho saktaa he

 An all-rounder is a cricketer who performs regularly in both batting and bowling
 haalanki sabhi gendbaajon ke liye ballebaaji jaruri hoti he or kuch ballebaaj kabhi-kabhaar gendbaaji bhi karte hai, zyaadaatar khilaadi in do chizon main se sirf kisi ek main hi nipun hote hai or ve visheshgy maane jate hai
 Some wicket-keepers have mastery of specialist batsmen and are also known as all-rounders, but the wicket-keeper batsman terminology is more commonly used for them
 mahanatam harfanmaulaa main jorge hurst, wilfred rods, mushtak mohammad, kith miller, garfield sobers, andrew flintoff, walter hamend, ian botham, jacks kallis, kapil dev, richard hadlee, dablyoo
 ji
 gres, kris kairns, shen watson, dwen braavo, imran khan or shahid aafridi kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 However, there is no exact qualification for a player on the basis of which he is considered an all-rounder and the use of this name becomes subjective
 aamtaur par 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' use kaha jaataa he jisaki ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji kshamta aisi ho jisase ki wo unamem se kisi ek dam par hi us dal main jagah banane main kaamyaab ho jiske liye wo khelte hai
 Another definition of 'real all-rounder' is that a player who, with his batting and bowling, constantly "helps his team win matches"
 paribhaasha ke mutabik ek vaastavik harfanmaulaa team ke liye behad durlabh or kaaphi moolyawaan khilaadi hota he kyonki wo prabhavi taur par do khilaadiyon ke rup main kaam karata he
 Sometimes confusion arises when an expert bowler performs well with the bat
 udhaaharan ke liye, west indies ke mahaan tej gendbaaj malcom marshall kai baar acchhee pari khelaa karte the, lekin ye itani baar nahin hota tha ki unhen harfanmaulaa mana jaae
 iske bajaae unhen nimna kram kaa acha ballebaaj kaha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, a specialist batsman can be called a useful change bowler and a good example of this is Alan Border, who took 11 wickets in a Test match once in 1989, when the conditions were favorable to his left-handed spin
 manyata praapt harfanmaulaa banane main pramukh baadhaon main se ek he ballebaajon or gendbaajon kaa alag-alag umr main shikhar par pahunchnaa
 ballebaaj tees saal ke aasapaas apane shikhar par tab pahunchate hai jab unki takneekee anubhav ke saath paripakv ho jaati he
 In contrast, fast bowlers often reach their peak in physical ability as well as in the course of twenty to twenty five years
 duusare gendbaaj, zyaadaatar phiraki gendbaajon or gend ko ghumaane vaale tej gendbaaj bhi apane kariyar ke aakhir main zyada asardaar hote hai
 a commonly used rule of statistics is that a player's batting average should be greater than his bowling average
 test cricket main, aise sirf teen harfanmaulaa hai jinka ballebaaji ausat unke gendbaaji ausat kii tulana main bees ank zyada hai: garfield sobers, jacks kallis or walter hamend

 This is the reason that the names "bowler allrounder" and "batsman allrounder" emerged
 udhaaharan ke liye, test cricket main kith miller kaa ballebaaji main 36
97 kaa ek acha ausat tha, or 22
97 kaa behtareen gendbaaji ausat tha, isliye unhen gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kaha jaataa he
 In contrast, Gary Sobers had a tremendous batting average of 57
78 and bowling average of 34
03, so he can be called a batsman all-rounder
 vaastavik harfanmaulaa main adarsh hai imran khan jinka ballebaaji main ausat 37 or gendbaaji main 23 kaa ausat tha, jo ek ballebaaj ke taur par bahut acha tathaa gendbaaj ke taur par behtareen he
 Sobers is considered the "greatest all-rounder of all time"
 Although statistics suggest, they were also much better in one area than the other

 Antibodies are available in different types called isotypes or classes
 standhari bhrunon main paanch tarah ke pratipind isotip paae jate hai jinhen ijie, aijidi, ijii, aijiji or ijiem kehete hai
 These all begin with the prefix Ig, which means immunoglobulin, which is another name for the antibody, and varies in its biological properties, functional locations, and ability to deal with different antigens, as described above
 Is shown in koshika ke vikaas or sakriyan ke dauraan bi koshika ke pratipind isotip parivartit hote hai
 Immature b cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, are known as simple b cells and express only the igm isotype in the cell surface bound form

 razia sultan kii samadhi / kabr, Razia al-din, the royal name "jalolat ud-din Raziyo", commonly known as "razia Sultan" or "razia Sultana" in history, was the Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate
 razia ne 1236 se 1240 tak dilli sultanate par shashan kiya
 She was the daughter of Iltutmish
 turki mul kii razia ko anya muslim rajkumariyon kii tarah sena kaa netritv tathaa prashasan ke kaaryon main abhyaas karaayaa gaya, taaki zaroorat padane par uskaa istemaal kiya ja sake
 
 Razia Sultana was the first female ruler of Muslim and Turkish history
 razia ko uske pita shams-ud-din iltutamish kii mrityu ke pashchaat dilli kaa sultan banaaya gaya
 Iltutmish was the first ruler who appointed a woman to succeed him
 
lekin, muslim varg ko iltutamish kaa kisi mahila ko vaaris bananaa naamanzur tha, isliye uski mrityu ke pashchaat uske chote bete raknuddin firoz shah ko rajsinghaasana par baithaaya gaya
 The rule of Raknuddin, for a very short period of time, was no longer controlled by Iltutmish's widow, Shah Turkan
 vilaasi or laaparvaah raknuddin ke khilaaf janata main is seemaa tak aakrosh umada, ki 9 november 1236 ko raknuddin tathaa uski mata, shah turkan kii hatya kar di gayi

 vah dilli kii sabase shaktishaalee shaasha ban gayin thim
 Muslims also did not like the intimate relationship that was developing with Razia and her mentor, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, a Habshi
 razia ne is par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya
 , But his underestimating the outcome of this relationship proved fatal for his state
 kuch sroton ke anusaar, razia or yakut premi the; anya sroton ke anusaar ve donon kareebi dost / vishwaas paatr the
 All this Razia had given birth to Ishiya in the Turkish class, because Yakub was not a Turk and he was appointed by Razia as an officer of the horse

 There was a war between Razia and Altunia in which Yakut was killed and Razia was taken captive
 marane ke dar se razia altuniya se shaadi karne ko taiyaar ho gayi
 Meanwhile, Razia's brother, Mazzuddin Behram Shah, seized the throne
 apni sultanate kii vaapasi ke liye razia or uske pati, altuniya ne beharam shah se yuddh kiya, jisamen unki haar hui

 But the actual tomb has not been decided yet
 vaise razia kii majaar ke daavon main ab tak ye teen daawey hi sabase zyada majboot hai
 There are indications that the mausoleums situated in all these places have written Razia Sultan in Arabic Persian but no concrete evidence has been found
 rajasthan ke tonk main razia sultan or uske ithiopian das yakuut kii majaar ke kuch thos pramaan mili hai

 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he

 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy

 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun
