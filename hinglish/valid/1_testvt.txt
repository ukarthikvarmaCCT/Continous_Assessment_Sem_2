 Hastrekha Shastra or chiramancy is composed of "hand" and mantia) is an art of describing the symptoms and predicting the future by reading the palm which is also called palmistry study or palmistry
 is kala kaa prayog kai saanskrithik vividhtaon ke saath duniya bhar main dekha jaataa he
 Those who read palmistry are also commonly called palmists, palm readers, hand readers, palm analysts, or palm readers
 hastrekha shaastra ko aam taur par chhadam vigyaan mana jaataa he
 The information outlined below is in essence the main elements of modern palmistry, many of which explain the various lines often contradicting them and palmists are divided into various "schools"
 hastrekha shaastra kii jaden chini vijing,bharat main jyotish shaastra or roma bhavishyavetta se judi hui hai
 The Hindu sage Valmiki is believed to have written a book, the English translation of which would be titled "the Teachings of Valmiki Maharishi on Mail Palmistry" and contains 567 verses
 bharat se, hastrekha kala kaa china, tibet, misr, faras or europe ke anya deshon main prasar hua
 From China, palmistry spread to Greece, where Anaxagoras used it
 lekin, aadhunik hastrekha shastri aksar bhavishya karne vaali paaramparik takanic ko manovigyaan, sampurna nidaan, anumaan ke vaikalpik tareekon se bhi jodate rahe hai
 In palmistry, "reading" the palm of a person evaluates his character or future life
 vibhinn "linon" or "uthaan" yaa, ko padhakar anumaanath: unke sambhddha aakaar, gun or antarshakhaon ke sambandh main suzav diye jate hai
 In some customs, palm readers read fingers, fingernails, fingerprints and lines of a person's skin, skin texture and color, shape, palm shape and hand flexibility
 ek hastrekhavid aamtaur par vyakti ke 'pramukh haath' 
 hastrekha vigyaan kii kuch paramparaon main duusare haath ko vanshanugat yaa parivaar ke lakshanon ko dhaaran kiya hua yaa hastrekhavid ke brahmand sambandhi vishwaason par aadhaarit mana jaataa he, jisase ateet ke jivan yaa purv janm kii sharton ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 The roots of the basic framework for "classical" palmistry are rooted in Greek mythology
 hatheli or ungaliyon kaa prayek kshetra ek devi yaa devtaa se sambandhit he or us kshetra kii visheshtaayen vishay ke isi pahalu kii prakruti kaa sanket he
 For example, the ring finger Apollo is associated with the Greek god; The features of this ring finger are seen during the discussion of the subjects related to art, music, aesthetics, fame, money and harmony
 yadhyapi is baat par bahes hoti rahi he ki koun sa haath padhanaa behatar he, par donon kaa apana mahatv he
 It is customary to assume that the left hand represents the person's possibilities and the right is a display of right personality
 kuch kaa kahana he ki mahatv is baat kaa he ki koun sa haath dekha jaataa he
 "the future is seen with the right hand and the past with the left
 " "baayan haath bataata he ki ham kya-kya lekar paidaa hue hai or dahinaa dikhaata he ki hamane ise kya banaaya he
 "" The right hand is read by men, while the left hand of women is read
 " "baanyaa haath bataata he ki ishwar ne aapako kya diya he or daayan bataata he ki aapako is sambandh main kya karnaa he
 " lekin in sab kehane kii baaten hai, vritti or anubhav hi aapako behatar dhang se bataayegaa ki aakhir main koun sa haath padhanaa thik rahegaa
 Depending on the palmistry and type of reading them, palmists can see palm shape and finger lines, skin color and texture, fingernail texture, proportional shape of palm and fingers, prominence of knuckles and many other features of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii adhikansh dhaaraon main haath kii akritiyon ko 4 yaa 10 pramukh shastreey prakaaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske liye shastreey tatwon yaa visheshtaon kaa sahaara bhi liya jaataa he
 Character size of the indicated type of character haalanki bhinn-bhinn roopon ke baavjood sabase aam vargeekaran hi aadhunik hastrekhavid prayog karte hai
 It is easy to determine the dominating elements and nature in your own palm, the number of lines and the quality of the rows can also be included in the analysis of the shape of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii kuch paramparaon main, prithvi or jal haathon main kam or gahari rekhaaen hoti hai, jabaki vaayu or agni haath main or adhik rekhaaen dikh sakati hai, jinamein kam spasht paribhaasha hoti he
 Three lines are found in almost all hands and the palmists generally place the most emphasis on these
 yah rekha anguuthe ke upar hatheli ke kinare se nikalati he or kalai kii disha main mehrab kii shakl main badhati he
 This line is believed to represent a person's energy and strength, physical health and general well-being
 aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki jivan rekha durghatnaon, shaareerik chot, punarsthaapan sahit jivan main aane vaale badlaavon ko pratibimbit karti he
 Contrary to popular belief, modern palmists generally do not believe that the length of a person's lifeline is associated with a person's age
 atirikt mukhya rekhaon yaa roopon main shaamil hai: According to palmistry, this line provides a person with intensity of purpose or concentration towards an objective, whose nature is determined by the correct position of this line on the hand and any branches arising from it, which is a common case
 un haathon main, jinamein aisi rekha bina kisi shakha ke ekal chihn ke rup main maujuud hoti he, vah atyant gahan prakruti kii ore sanket karti he or vyaktiyon kii vishesh dekhbhaal kii jarurat hoti he
 The normal position of this line begins below the largest finger and normally ends where the heart line ends at the side of the hand under the little finger, indicating the average interests of the person and the depth of the temperament
 Purely determined by the direction of any branches originating from here
 hatheli ke upree aadhe hisse, jo ungaliyon turant neeche hota he, vyakti ke ucchtar yaa bauddhik swabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or hatheli ke nichalaa aadha hissaa vyakti ke swabhaav ke bhautikwaadi paksh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If one of these half-sides is larger, which is determined by the central position of the main line or in this case by the single transverse palm line, the person exhibits a broader developmental aspect of nature
 haalanki yah ek aam siddhant he ki agar yah rekha apni saamaanya sthiti se neeche hoti he to isse gahan bauddhik swabhaav kaa sanket miltaa he, par agar yah apni saamaanya sthiti se upar hoti he, to ghor bhautikwaadi prakruti or hiton ko darshata he
 The direction of any branching originating from this line has a significant effect on this line, leading to appropriate modifications from the results defined above, and is based on the nature of the hand bulge
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi is rekha se ek shakha anguuthe ke bilkul vipareet chandramaa ke ubhaar par haath ke nichle kinare kii ore badhati he to yah sanket karata he ki vyakti bhavuk swabhaav or kaaphi hichkichanevaala he
 Other short lines: is tarah ke sach ko tark kii kasuti par kasne vaale log aksar hastrekhavidon ko kathith maansashasthri kii shrenee main rakhte hai, "cold reeding" naam kii takanic kaa prayog karte hai
 Cold reading is considered to be an exercise in which all types of line study, including palmists, have to appear before the psychologist
 ek thode vyapak rup se sweekaarya khoj ke mutabik hastrekha shaastra kii sateekta ko charitra vishleshan kii ek pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he or abhi tak nirnaayak saboot nahin mila he ki hatheli kii rekhaon or vyakti ke charitra ke bich koi sambandh hota he
 Beyond that the analysis should decide on a logical basis whether a person is suffering from a chromosomal disorder or a certain proportion of statistical groups are associated with their scores
 jivan kaal yaa vyaktitv ke prakaar ke sambandh main hastrekhavid dwaara kiye gaye daavon ke samarthan main abhi tak koi nirnaayak aankada yaa tathy nahin paaya gaya he

 saamuraai madhyakaalin japan ke kshatriya hote the jo nidar, yuddh main khunkaar, shastron ke istemaal main ati-sakasham or marate dam tak apane raja se vafadaari karne vaale maane jate the
 It was the duty of any samurai to die before his king
 agar koi raja maaraa jaataa to saamuraai kaa farz tha ke uske maarane waalon se badla le
 The situation of the master of the samurai who had died or who had expelled him from his service for some reason was considered extremely shameful and he was never again served by a king
 aise saamuraai ko hi ronin kehete the
 Ronin wandered from city to city
 kyonki wo jaanbaaj the or ladaai karne main nipun the, isliye kain japani kathaon main darshaya jaataa he ke kisi gaanv yaa stri par atyaachaar ho rahaa he or ek bahadur ronin aakar unki madad karata he

 georgian shaharon kii suchi nimnlikhit : Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia batumi Prophet of Islam includes "messengers", a divine revelation through a malak; And the "prophet", the Shari'ah that Muslims believe is one of the six articles of Islamic faith, and is specifically mentioned in the Quran
 islam ke anusaar allaah ne dharti par manushya ke maargdarshan ke liye samay samay par kisi vyakti vishesh ko apana doot banaaya
 These messengers were also from the human race and called people to God, these people are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, Adam, created by Allah
 yahudiyon main 48 nabiyon kaa zikr he
 Many prophets of Christianity are mentioned in the Quran, because Jesus was also one of the prophets
 isai dharm ke kai nabiyon kaa quran main ullekh kiya gaya he lekin thodaa alag roopon main ullekh kiya gaaya he
 For example, the Jewish Elisha is called Elisa, Job is Ayub, Jesus is Jesus, etc
 musa ko diya gaya torah ko tavaraat kaha jaataa he, daaud ko die gaye kirthan zaboor hai
 The Gospel given to Jesus is Gospel
 In Islam, prophets are usually men
 islam main musalamaanon ke liye mohammad adwitiya hai, musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki mohammad "naboovat kii muhar" hai; yah baat quran bataata he
 Muslims who believe that the Quran descended from Allah, which is protected by Allah and free from any kind of corrupt, made such a book on Muhammad
 yah kitaab yom al-qiyama tak mahfuz rahegi musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki mohammad aakhri nabi hai, haalanki mohammad ke baad nabi nahin magar sant honge 
 In the Muslim faith, every prophet of Islam believed the same main Islamic beliefs, unity of God, worship of that god, idolatry and avoidance of sin, and life on the day of resurrection or the day of judgment and after death
 prayek itihaas main islam kaa prachaar karne ke liye aayaa tha or kuch ne antim islamic paigambar or bhagwaan ke doot ke aane ke bare main bataaya tha, jinhen " ahamed " naam diya jayega jise aam taur par mohammad kaha jaataa he
 In Arabic and Hebrew, the word Nabi means "prophet"
 quran main is sangya ke rup 75 guna hote hai
 Five times in the Quran the words "nubuwwah
 shabd rasul or mursal "sandeshvahak" yaa "preshit" ko darshaate hai or 300 se adhik baar hote hai
 a prophetic "message", the word for risala, appears in the Quran in ten instances
 rasul allaah ke siri rup, shilih di-allaah, aksar saint thomas ke apokraphal adhiniyamon main hota he
 The same verb for Sheliḥeh - shalaḥ, occurs in relation to prophets in the Hebrew Bible
 shabd "prophet" or "massenger" puraane niyam or nae niyam main kai baar prakat hote hai
 The following table shows these words in different languages: hebrew bible main, nauvi shabd adhik saamaanya hota he, or hebrew shabd malakh yahudee dharm main angels ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Judaism, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year-old Babylonian exile
 unke saath, nevaha kii pramanik avadhi kii mrityu ho gai, or aajkal keval " bath kol " maujuud he 
 In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" is more frequent, sometimes with the concept of a prophet
 "massenger" yishu ko apane preriton or jon baptist ko sanderbhit kar saktaa he
 But the book of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet John the Baptist
 muslim vishwaas main, har islamic pigambar ne islam kaa prachaar kiya
 Beliefs of charity, prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to be taught by every prophet who comes in some time
 quran swayan islam ko " abraham kaa dharm" kahata he or muslim hone ke naate yaqub or israel ke baarah janajatiyon ko sanderbhit karata he
 The Quran speaks of the Islamic Prophet as the greatest human being of all time
 ek pigambar, shabd kii muslim bhaavana main, vah vyakti he jise allaah ne vishesh rup se islam ke vishwaas ko sikhaane ke liye chunaa he
 In the case of Muhammad, at the age of 40 some people were made prophets late
 yahaya jaise anya logon ko naboovat karne ke liye bahut badi umr main bulaayaa gaya tha, jabaki isa ko ek choti umr main nabi banaaya gaya tha
 The Qur'anic verse 4:69 lists the various virtuous groups of human beings, of which prophets are the highest
 aayat 4:69 main he: - Quran, Sura 4, Ayya 69 bible kii kahaniyaan arabi bhashaa main quran main dobaaraa baniin ityadi) nishchit rup se yahudee hebrew bible, unani old tastomant or greek new testament se alag he, jisamen quran hameshaa pradarshit karata he ki buraai or vipattiyon kii shaktiyon par antat vishwaas jeetne ke liye "allaah kaa abhyaas" he
 “we have created evil people with those without faith

 Sufism of Muslim poets is not much different from the typical Daivatism of Hindus
 kuch bhavuk musalmaan kaviyon dwaara sufiwaad se rangi hui uttam rachanaaen likhi gayi
 In short, there are four major poetic streams of the Bhakti era: terahavin sadi tak dharm ke kshetra main badi astavyastata aa gai
 The superstitions practiced by the Siddhas and Yogis etc
 were spreading in public, stereotypes and preeminence had prevailed among the educated class
 mayawad ke prabhaav se lokavimukhataa or niskriyata ke bhav samaaj main panpane lage the
 At such a time a huge cultural movement took place across India in the form of Bhakti movement, which established the social and personal values that were eminent in the society
 bhakthi andolan kaa aarambh dakshin ke alwar santon dwaara dasvin sadi ke lagbhag hua
 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India
 ramanand ke ram brahm ke sthanapann the jo rakshason kaa vinaash or apni lila kaa vistaar karne ke liye sansar main avateern hote hai
 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time, Ballabhacharya ran his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswamy's Shuddhavaita opinion
 barahavin se solahavin sadi tak puure desh main puranasammat krishnacharit ke aadhaar par kai sampradaay pratishthit hue, jinamein sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee vallabh kaa pushtimaarg tha
 He called the virtuous form of Brahman as real against Shankarism
 unke mat se yah sansar mithyaa yaa maaya kaa prasar nahin he balki brahm kaa hi prasar he, at: satya he
 He considered Krishna to be an incarnation of Brahma and for his attainment it was necessary that the devotee's complete surrender

 In this sect, the sweet form of Gopijanavallabh, Lilapurushotam Krishna was accepted for worship

 Although the source of devotion came from the south, it also took a new form in the new circumstances of North India
 musalamaanon ke is desh main bas jane par ek aise bhaktimaarg kii aavashyaktaa thi jo hindu or musalmaan donon ko grahya ho
 Apart from this, a more valid opinion could also be for the lower class, which is promoted by the male of their class

 He is the forefather of Kabir's saintliness
 duusari ore sufi kaviyon ne hinduon kii lokkathaon kaa aadhaar lekar ishwar ke premamay rup kaa prachaar kiya
 Thus, on the basis of these different views, two branches of Bhaktikavya in Hindi called Nirgun and Saguna went together
 nirgunamat ke do upavibhag hue - gyanashrayi or premashrayi
 The representatives of the first are Kabir and the second is Jaisi
 sagunmat bhi do upadharaon main pravaahit hua - rambhakti or krishnabhakti
 The first representative is Tulsi and the second is Surdas
 bhakthikavy kii in vibhinn pranaliyon kii apni alag alag visheshtaayen hai par kuch aadharbhoot baton kaa sannivesh sab main he
 Everyone accepted the normal role of love

 The imagery of an avatar with love and compassion is the basis of virtuous devotees, but Nirgunopasak Kabir also remembers his Rama as beloved, father and master etc
 gyaan kii tulana main sabhi bhakton ne bhakthibhaav ko gaurav diya he
 All devout poets have accepted the medium of lingua franca

 The form of religion reformer and social reformer is special in his works

 He was intensely betrayed by externalities, stereotypes and superstitions
 manushya kii kshamta kaa udghosh kar unhone nimnashrenee kii janata main aatmgaurav kaa bhav jagaaya

 Sufi saints tried to influence the Lokmanas on the level of emotion through their premiers

 The love expressed by them is God-oriented, but this love usually transitions to the cosmic land itself
 parampriy ke saundarya, premakrida or premi ke virahodveg aadi kaa varnan unhone itani tanmayata se kiya he or unke kavy kaa maanviya aadhaar itnaa pusht he ki aadhyatmik pratikon or rupakon ke baavjood unki rachanaayen premasamarpit kathakavy kii shreshth kritiyaan ban gai hai
 The whole atmosphere of his poetry is of folk life and in-house
 premakhyaanakon kii style farsi ke masanvi kavy jaisi he
 The most prominent poet of this stream is Jayasi, whose "padmavat" has been specially acclaimed due to his poignant lovemaking, Katharas and easy art
 inaki anya rachanaaon main "akharavat' or "aakhri kalam' aadi hai, jinamein sufi sampradaaysangat baaten hai1 is dhara ke anya kavi hai kutaban, manzan, usmaan, shaikh, nabi or nurmuhammad aadi
 Though the primacy of thought is among the poets of the Jnanmārgi branch, the secular form of love is expressed in the works of Sufis
 sagun dhara ke kaviyon ne vichaaratmak shushkta or prem kii ekangita durkar jivan ke sahaj ullasmay or vyapak rup kii pratishtha kii
 Poets of Krishnabhakti Shakha, as a result of the lilapurushottam Krishna's melodious form, blossomed a deep raga towards life

 Surdas is the best poet of this division

 Nandadas's Kalachetna is a relatively special vocal

 Narottamdas, Rasakhan, Senapati etc
 were many other talented poets of this stream who enriched Hindi poetry
 yah sara krishnakavy muktak yaa kathashrith muktak he
 Musicality is one of its distinguishing qualities

 Krishnabhaktikavya had a refreshing melody of the melody of life, the moral aspect of life and social understanding became more prominent in Ramakavya
 ek ne svachhand raagatatv ko mahatv diya to duusare ne maryaadit lokchetana par vishesh bal diya

 ramkavy kaa sarvotkrisht vaibhav "ramcharitamanas' ke rachayita tulsidas ke kavy main prakat hua jo vidyavid grearsan kii drushti main buddhadev ke baad ke sabase bade jananaayak the
 But from the point of view of poetry, the importance of Tulsi lies in the concept of a form of God which is established on the highest land of human strength and authority

 He has equal authority over various forms of poetry
 apane samay main prachlit sabhi kavyaneleyon kaa unhone safal prayog kiya
 Apart from the literary styles of management and muktaka, he is equally capable of dealing with both the popular folk Awadhi and Brajbhasha
 tulsi ke atirikt ramkavy ke anya rachayitaaon main agradas, nabhadas, pranachand chouhan or hridyaram aadi ullekhya hai
 From today's point of view, the importance of this entire devotional faith is more due to human feelings and sentiments of life than its righteousness

 This branch of this property has been the most publicized
 vibhinn sampradaayon ke antargat ucch koti ke kavi hue hai
 Among them, there have been great poets like Surdas Kumbhandas Rasakhan of Ashthachap under the confirmation-sect of Vallabhacharya
 vatsalya evam shringaar ke sarvottam bhakt-kavi surdaas ke padon kaa parvarti hindi sahitya par sarvaadhik prabhaav padaa he

 Almost all poets were singers, so the amazingly beautiful coordination of poetry and music is found in the compositions of these poets
 geeti-kavy kii jo parampara jayadev or vidyapati dwaara pallavit hui thi uskaa charam-vikaas in kaviyon dwaara hua he
 By expressing the ordinary love-lines of male and female by radha-krishna's supernatural love-spirit, he enlightened the public mind
 anand kii ek lahar desh bhar main daud gai
 The principal poets of this branch were Surdas, Nandadas, Meera Bai, Hitharivansh, Haridas, Rasakhan, Narottam Das etc

 Poets of Surdas etc
 Ashthachap composed krishna-bhakti-literature by becoming initiated in Pushtimarga propagated by Shri Vallabhacharya

 Tulsi Das has considered imperviousness in devotion and knowledge: Bhagathin Gyanahin and not some piercing

 Ram of Tulsi is the founder of Maryadapurushottam and ideals
 is kavy dhara main adarsh paatro kii sarjana hui he

 Thus, in Ramcharitmanas, Tulsi has conceived the ideal householder, ideal society and ideal state
 adarsh kii pratishtha se hi tulsi lokanayak kavi ban gaye hai or unka kavy lokmagal kii bhaavana se otprot he
 Coordination spirit: Tulsi psyche is the great effort of coordination
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi ke shabdon main - unka sara kavy samanvay kii viraat cheshtaa he
 The coordination of folk and scripture, the coordination of ghasthaya and vairagya, the coordination of devotion and knowledge, the coordination of language and Sanskrit, the coordination of nirguna and saguna, the coordination of pāditya and apānditya is the poetry of the beginning in Ramcharitmanas from beginning to end

 All the juices can be seen in Tulsi's psyche and Keshav's Ramachandrika
 rambhakti ke rasik sampradaay ke kavy main shringaar ras ko pramukhataa mili he
 The main juice though remained a quiet juice
 bhashaa : ramkavy main mukhyat: avadhi bhashaa prayukt hui he
 But Brajbhasha has also become a decoration of this poetry

 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain has raised questions about the nature of Nirguna bhakti and has proposed that Nirguna bhakti of saints has its own form which cannot be interpreted in the context of Vedanta philosophy
 unke shabd hai: From the scriptural point of view all the above questions seem to challenge the nature of 'nirguna-bhakti'
 kabir aadi santon kii darshanik vivechna karte samay acharya ramachandra shukla ne yah manyata sthapit kii he ki unhone niraakaar ishwar ke liye bhartiya veydant kaa pallaa pakadaa he
 In this regard, when we consider the comparative aspects of Shankar monotheism and the virtuous devotion of the saints, the limits of the above recognition become clear: musalamaand sufi kaviyon kii is samay kii kavy-dhara ko premamargi mana gaya he kyonki prem se ishwar praapt hote hai aisi unki manyata thi

 meri kaa janm poland ke warsaw nagar main hua tha
 Being a woman, she was allowed limited education in the then Warsaw
 isliye unhen chup-chhupaakar ucch shiksha praapt kerani padi
 Later, due to financial support of her elder sister, she came to Paris to study physics and mathematics
 unhone frans main doctoret puraa karne vaali pehali mahila hone kaa gaurav paaya
 She also had the distinction of being the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris
 yaheen unki mulaaqaat piyare curi se hui jo unke pati bane
 This scientific couple made an important discovery of polonium in 1898
 kuch hi maheene baad unhone radium kii khoj bhi kii
 This proved to be an important revolutionary discovery in medical science and treatment of diseases

 Einstein wrote more than fifty papers and books apart from science
 1999 main time patrika ne shatabdi-purush ghoshit kiya
 According to a survey, he was considered the greatest scientist of all time
 oinstin ne 300 se adhik vaigyanik shodh-patron kaa prakaashan kiya
 On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the display of over 30,000 unique documents and papers from Einstein
 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein
 haalaanki oinstin ko shuru-shuru main bolne main kathinaayee hoti thi, lekin ve padhai main awwal the
 His mother tongue was German and later he also learned Italian and English
 1880 main unka parivaar munich shahar chalaa gaya, jahaan unke pita or chachaa ne milakar "electratechnic frabik je oinstin and si" naam kii company kholi, joki bijli ke upkaran banaati thi
 And it also provided lights for the first time at the Oktoberfest fair in Munich
 unka parivaar yahudee dharmik paramparaon ko nahin maanata tha, or isi vajah se oinstin catholic vidhyalay main padhne ja sake
 He learned to play Sarangi at the behest of his mother
 unhen ye pasand nahin tha or baad me ise chhod bhi diya, lekin baad me unhe mozart ke sarangi sangeet me bahut anand aata tha
 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia
 parivaar ke pavia jane ke baad bhi oinstin munich main hi apni padhai puri karne ke liye ruke rahen
 In late December 1894, he traveled to Italy to visit his family in Pavia
 italy main apane samay ke dauraan unhone "ek chumbakeey kshetra main ether kii avasthaa kii jaanch" sheershak ke saath ek laghu niabandh likhaa tha
 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "
 ve khud ke kaam ke alaava duusare vaigyanikon ke saath bhi sahyog karte the, jiname bose oinstin ke aankade, oinstin refricrator or anya kai aadi shaamil hai
 
 anus mirabilis papers chaar lekhon se sambandhit hai jise oinstin ne 1905 ko onlan der physic naam kii ek vaigyanik patrika main prakashit kiya tha, jiname prakashavidyut prabhaav, brounian gati, vishesh saapekshatawaad, or e = mc2 shaamil the
 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means
 yahi patr, 1905 ke brounian gati par shodh-patr ke liye neenv bane, jisamen pataa chalaa ki anuo kii upasthiti hetu brounian gati ko thos saboot kii tarah upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time
 anya siddhant jo oinstin dwaara banaaye gaye or baad main sahi sabit hue, main samanta ke siddhant or kwantum sankhya ke samoshna samanyikaran ke siddhant shaamil the
 Einstein's paper "on the dynamics of electricity of moving bodies" was completed on 30 June 1905 and published on 26 September of the same year
 yah bijli or chumbakatv ke maxwell ke sameekaran or yantriki ke siddhanth, prakaash kii gati ke kareeb yantriki main bade badlaav ke baad, ke bich saamanjasy nishchit karata hai
 This was later known as Einstein's special theory of relativity
 jiskaa nishkarsh tha ki, samay- antariksh dhaanche main gatisheel padaarth, dhimaa or sankuchit najar aata hai, jab ise paryvekshak ke dhaanche main mapa jaataa he
 This paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous ether was excessive
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata ke apane shodh-patr main, oinstin ne vishesh saapekshata samikarnon se E=mc2 ko nirmit kiya
 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr
 robert millican kii prakashavidyut prabhaav par vistrut prayog, tathaa compton bikharane kii maap ke saath, yah pariklpana saarvbhaumik rup se 1919 main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics
 arnest radarford ke nabhik kii khoj, or yah prastaav ke baad ki electron, grahon kii tarah kaksha main ghoomte hai, niles bohr yah dikhaane main sakasham hue kii plank dwaara shuru or oinstin dwaara viksit kwantum yantric ke dwaara tatwon ke parmaanuon main electronon kii asatat gati or tatwon kii aavart sarini ko samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai
 Einstein contributed to its development by combining the logic of 1898 with Wilhelm Vienna
 viena ne yah dikhaaya ki, ek thermal santulan avasthaa ke sthiroshm parivartanheenata kii pariklpana se alag-alag taapmaana par sabhi kaale ghumaav ko ek saral sthanantaran prakriya ke dwaara ek duusare se vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1911, Einstein found that the same temperate theory shows that the quantity that is quantized in any mechanical motion must be a stabilizing invariant
 arnald samarfield ne samoshna aparivartaneey ko paaramparik yantriki main gatisheel char ke rup main pahchaan kii
 According to this theory- albert oinstin kaa is vishay main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 While traveling, Einstein wrote letters to his wife Elsa and adopted daughter Kadamuni Margot and Ilse
 ye patr, da hebrew uniwarsity main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Margot Einstein had allowed these private letters to be made available to the public, but at the same time requested that they not be done until twenty years after his death
 ) oinstin ne thathere ke peshey main apni ruchi vyakt kii thi or unhen plumber or steamphitres union kaa ek maanad sadsy banaaya gaya tha
 Barbara Wolff of the Albert Einstein Archives of the Hebrew University told the BBC that there were approximately 3500 letters of personal correspondence written between 1912 and 1955
 14 july san 1930 ko berlin main ainstin kii mulaakaat bharat ke mahaan sahityakar, rahasyavid va nobel puraskaar vijeta gurudev rabindranath thakur se hui
 This meeting and interaction between a great scientist of his time, a great scientist of his time and a great thinker and devout poet representing the religious ideology of the East, is considered a unique legacy of history
 oinstin ek bhavuk, patibaddh jatvaad virdohi the, or princeton main neshnal association of da advancement of colord pipal sanstha ke sadsy bhi the, jahaan unhone africa americanyon ke naagarik adhikaron ke liye abhiyaan main hissaa bhi liya
 He considered racism to be America's "worst disease", at the time of his involvement, he was a civil rights activist W
B
 Du Bois, and agreed to testify on his behalf during one of his trial in 1951
 jab oinstin ne du bois ke charitra ke liye gavaah hone kii peshkash kii, to nyaayadhish ne mukademe ko kaarij karne kaa faisla kiya
 In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historic black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree
 oinstin ne america main naslwad ke bare main bhaashan diya, unka kahana tha, "meraa iske bare main chup rahane kaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 "A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had ever paid college education fees for black students
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh se purv, ek akhbaar ne apane ek kollam main ek sankshipt vivaran prakashit kiya kii oinstin ko america main itani acchhee tarah se janaa jaataa tha ki log unhen sadak par roak kar unke die siddhant kii vyakhya poochne lagate the
 Eventually he figured out a way to avoid this constant questioning
 ve unase kehete kii "maaf kijiye! mujhe log aksar professor oinstin samajhate hai par wo main nahin hoon
 "einstein has been the subject or inspiration of many novels, films, plays and musicals
 vah "pagal" vaigyanikon" yaa anymansk prophessoron ke chithran ke liye ek pasandida charitra the; unki arthpurna cheharaa or vishisht keshavinyas style kaa vyapak rup se nakal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Frederick Golden of Time magazine once wrote that Einstein was "like a cartoonist's dream coming true"
 oinstin ne kai puraskaar or sammaan praapt kiye or 1922 main unhen bhautikee main "saidhantik bhautikee ke liye apni sevaaon, or visheshkar prakashvaidhut prabhaav kii khoj ke liye" nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 If no nomination in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, then the award of 1921 went ahead and Einstein was awarded it in 1922

 In 1911, the British government decided to bring the capital back to Delhi
 iske liye puraani dilli ke dakshin main ek nae nagar nai dilli kaa nirmaan prarambh hua
 After independence from the British in 1947, New Delhi was declared the capital of India
 swatantraaa prapti ke pashchaat dilli main vibhinn kshetron se logon kaa pravaasana hua, isse dilli ke swaroop main amul parivartan hua
 Due to the migration of people of different provinces, religions and castes to Delhi, Delhi was urbanized and a mixed culture was also born here
 aaj dilli bharat kaa ek pramukh rajnatik, saanskrithik evam vanijyik kendra he
 There is no definite reference to how the city was named "delhi", but it is widely believed that it is related to an ancient king "dhillu"

 According to another estimate, the initial name of this city was "dhilika"
 hindi / praakrit "dhili" bhi is kshetra ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The earliest mention of Delhi is found in the Maha Purana called Mahabharata where it is mentioned as ancient Indraprastha
 indraprastha mahabharat kaal me pandavon kii rajdhani thi
 The first evidence that has been found archaeologically suggests that two thousand years before Christ, humans lived in and around Delhi
 maury-kaal se yahan ek nagar kaa vikaas hona aarambh hua
