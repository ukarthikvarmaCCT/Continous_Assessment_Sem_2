 The casino game should not be confused with the British card game Black Jack
 blackjaik kaa agradoot ek agyaat mul vaala khel, "twanti-van" tha
 The earliest written reference is found in a book by Miguel de Cervantes, who is famous for his writing of other works by Don Kigzot
 servantes khud ek juaari the or "novelas igemplayers" se, unki kahani "rinconet vaai cortadilo" ke mukhya paatr sevil main kaam karne vaala ek yugal dhokheybaaj he
 He specializes in cheating in "ventiuna" and says that the objective of the game is to get 21 points without losing points and also say that the value of aces is 1 or 11
 is khel ko spanish barajaa ke saath khelaa jaataa he, jisamen aath, nau or das ankiy card nahin hote hai
 This short story was written between 1601 and 1602 and the game was then played in Castilla from the beginning of the 17th century or earlier
 is khel ke baad ke sandarbh frans or spain main milte hai
 When 21 was introduced in United Queen America, it was not popular at the time, so gambling bases attempted to offer individual sums of money as bonuses for depositing players at the table
 aisa hi ek bonus 10 se 1 kaa bhugtan tha yadi khilaadi ke haath main hukum kaa ikkaa or ek blike jaik hota tha
 The wager was called "blackjack" and thus the name became associated with the game, even after the bonus payout ended soon after
 aadhunik khel main, ek "prakritik" yaa "blackjaik" bas ek ikke ke saath ek das ankiy card he
 In a casino in blackjack, there are one to seven players in front of the dealer from behind an arc shaped table
 prayek khilaadi swatantraapurvak dealer ke khilaaf apni chaal chalata he
 At the beginning of each round, the player places a wager in the "betting box" and receives an initial move of two cards
 khel kaa uddeshy dealer ke haath ke cardon ke maan se adhik maan vaale cardon ko praapt karnaa he, lekin 21 se adhik nahin hona chahie, jise "basting" yaa "braking" kehete hai
 Cards numbered 2 to 10 have the same value as those printed on it; The values of Jack, Begum and King are 10; Aces can be 1 or 11 depending on the player's choice
 khilaadi pehali chaal chalata he or apni icchaanusaar atirikt cardon ko shaamil kar apane haath ke cardon ko kheltaa he
 If he goes above 21 points, he "fails" and loses his tricks and bets on his own
 tab dealer apni chaal chalata he
 If the dealer fails, he loses to all remaining players who have a card with a value less than or equal to 21
 yadi koi vifal nahin hota he, to sabase adhik ankon vaali cardon ko dhaaran karne vaala khilaadi jeet jaataa he
 If a player is aligned with the dealer, the move is carried forward in what is known as a pause and the player's wager is returned
 aisa sambhav he ki dealer kuch khilaadiyon se haar jaae lekin phir bhi usee daur main vah anya khilaadiyon ko maat bhi detaa he
 Card cards are divided in three ways, from one or two-handed decks, from a box with four to eight decks, or from a shuffling machine
 When the cards are dealt by hand, the player's two initial cards are usually face-down, while the dealer has a face-up card called an "upcard" and a face-down card called Say "hole card"
 jab ek shu se cardon ko baanta jaataa he, to sabhi khilaadiyon ko baante gaye card aam taur par phase-ap hote hai jisamen bahut kam apwaad hota he
 There should be no such thing for a non-specialty player that his cards are dealt face-down or face-up as the dealer has to play according to predetermined rules
 yadi dealer ke paas 17 se kam maan vaale card ho, to use hi hit karnaa chahie
 If the dealer has a card with a value of 17 or higher, it should be stopped until its value becomes a "soft 17"
 ek soft 17 ke saath dealer "soft 17 ko hit" karne ke liye yaa "sabhi 17 par stand" karne ke liye blackjaik teble par mudrit casino niyamon kaa anusaran karata he
 Generally, the maximum possible hand is a "blackjack" or "natural", which means an initial two cards with a total of 21 values
 jis khilaadi ko blackjaik baanta jaataa he vah apane aap jeet jaataa he, agar dealer ke paas bhi blackjaik na ho, is maamle main hand ek "push" hota he
 When the dealer's upcard is an ace, the player is allowed to place a separate wager called "insurance", which allegedly protects the risk that the dealer has a blackjack
 insurance daanv se 2 se 1 kaa bhugtan hota he yadi dealer ke paas ek blackjaik ho
 Whenever a dealer has a blackjack, he wins over all other players except those who also have a blackjack
 nunatam or adhiktam daanv teble par lagaae jate hai
 The payout of most bets is 1: 1, which means that the player wins the same amount as the bet he bets
 ek khilaadi blackjaik kii paaramparik adaayagi 3:2 hoti he jiskaa matlab yah he ki casino har 2 dollar ke daanv ke liye 3 dollar kaa bhugtan karata he lekin aaj ke daur main kai casino kuch tablon par kam bhugtan karte hai

 Conversely, no player can double down more than the value of the original wager

 blackjaik khilaadi ko kai vividh niyamon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jo house adwantage par asar daalata he or isliye uske jeetne ke avasaron ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 Some rules are decided on the basis of law or regulation, other rules are decided on the basis of the casino itself
 sabhi niyam lagu nahin hote hai, isliye khilaadi ko apana haath khilne se pehle yaa samay aane par in niyamon ke bare main poochna pad saktaa he
 Over 100 different rules exist
 jahaan tak sabhi caseenon khelon kii baat he, blackjaik main ek "house adwantage" yaa "house age" shaamil he
 The primary house advantage in blackjack derives from the fact that if the player fails then he loses, whether the dealer fails in the end or not
 baharhaal, buniy ranneeti kaa prayog karne vaala ek blackjaik khilaadi vastav main everej bhagya ke saath apane sabhi daanv kii kul raashi kaa 1 pratishat se bhi kam raashi haaregaa; anya casino khelon kii tulana main yah khilaadi ke liye kaaphi anukool hota he
 Players who deviate from the basic strategy due to ignorance are generally expected to have higher loss rates
 prayek casino main iskaa ek niyam he ki dealer soft 17 ko hit karata he yaa nahin, yah niyam khud teble par chapa rahata he
 In the "S17" game, the dealer stands on all 17s
 "ech17" khel main, dealer soft 17 ko hit karata he
 Of course, the dealer always stands on Hard 17
 kisi bhi maamle main, dealer ke paas koi vikalp nahin hota he; use yaa to jarur se jarur hit karnaa chahie yaa jarur se jarur hit nahin karnaa chahie 
 "hit soft 17" khel khilaadi ke liye kam anukool hota he jiskaa house adwantage 0
2% se adhik hota he
 The number of decks used has a major impact on the players' chance of winning, as it affects the house advantage
 sabhi chijen baraabar hone ke naate, kuch deck hameshaa buniyadi ranneeti apnaane vaale khilaadi ke liye adhik anukool hota he
 One reason for this is that player blackjack that is slightly similar to single deck blackjack is removed and largely a different type of card is taken - and compared to a multi-deck game in a single deck game Much more impact) and if the player has blackjack, the dealer also has a much lower probability of blackjack, which means that in a single deck game, the player has In terms of Cerebral often must be paid in the ratio of 3: 2
 jab single deck blackjaik kii peshkash kii jaati he, tab aam taur par adhik pratibandhak niyamon ke saath isaki peshkash kii jaati he jo house ke anukool hota he
 For illustrative purposes, all of the following statistic use the same rules: double after split, one card to split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, only the original bets lost on the dealer's blackjack
 , a cut-card used by the dealer to hit soft 17
 Single deck play is much better than double deck, which is much better than four decks, while there is very little difference from six or more decks
 kuch casino ek anukool vikalp kii peshkash karte hai jise "sarender" yaa aatmasamarpan kehete hai, jo khilaadi ko apana aadha daanv chhod dene or apana haath na khilne kii anumati detaa he
 This option is sometimes referred to as a "late" surrender or late surrender because it occurs when the dealer checks his or her hole card for a blackjack
 jab atlantic city main pehali baar casino khulaa tha, sarender yaa aatmasamarpan kaa yah vikalp dealer dwaara blackjaik kii jaanch karne se pehle uplabdh tha - yah niyam khilaadi ke liye bahut zyada phydemand tha - lekin "aarambhik aatmasamarpan" kaa yah vikalp bahut jald gaayab ho gaya
 Various forms of initial surrender still exist in many countries
 khilaadi ko keval bahut karaab haathon par hi aatmasamarpan karnaa chahie, kyonki jeetne kii 25 pratishat sambhaavna hone par bhi apana aadha daanv chhodane kii tulana main use adhik everej ritern mil saktaa he
 Initially surrender, there is a greater chance of a player surrendering in front of the dealer's aces
 yadi khilaadi ikkon ke alaava kisi ek jode card ko split yaa alag karata he or us mulya yaa maan kaa koi teesraa card dikhaai detaa he, to khilaadi aam taur par mul daanv ke baraabar ek or daanv lagaakar phir se split kar saktaa he
 So three bets will be placed on the table and three different hands will be played
 Some casinos allow unlimited resplitting of cards other than aces, while other casinos may limit this to a fixed number of played hands, eg - four hands
 ikkon ko split karne ke baad, ek aam niyam yah he ki prayek ikke ke liye keval ek card baante jaaenge; khilaadi split, dabl, yaa kisi bhi haath par koi doosraa hit nahin le saktaa he
 Various forms of the rule include allowing the player to re-split or hit split aces
 khilaadi ko split ikkon se milane vaale haathon ko hit karne kii anumati milane se casino age main lagbhag 0
13 pratishat kii kami ho jaati he; split ikkon ko phir se split karne kii anumati milane se age main lagbhag 0
03 pratishat kii kami hoti he
 While it is very common to re-split aces, houses allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare
 ek khilaadi dwaara ek jode card ko split karne ke baad, adhikansh casino use donon yaa koi ek nae do-card vaale haathon par use "dabl down" karne kii anumati pradaan karte hai
 This is called a "double after split" and provides about 0
12 percent gain to the player
 aksar reno niyam kahalaane vaala yah niyam khilaadi ko keval 10 yaa 11 sankhyaman vaale aarambhik khilaadi par dabl down karne se pratibandhit karata he
 This prevents doubleting on soft hands such as soft 17 and is not suited for the player
 yah 9-11 niyam ke liye 0
09% or 0
15% ke darmyaan or 10-11 niyam ke liye 0
17% or 0
26% ke darmyaan house adwantage ko badha detaa he
 These numbers may vary due to the reciprocal effect of other rules
 adhikansh gaiyr-america casino main, ek 'no hole card' khel khelaa jaataa he, jiskaa matlab he ki dealer tab tak apane duusare card ko drow yaa consalt nahin karata he jab tak sabhi khilaadi nirnay nahin le lete hai
 With a no hold card, it is probably never the right basic strategy to double or split against the dealer's aces or aces, as the dealer's blackjack can cause split and double bet losses; The only exception to this is a paired ace against a threshold of the dealer, where splitting is still correct
 anya sabhi maamalon main, ek stand, hit yaa sarender ko kol kiya jaataa he
 For example, by placing 11 against the dealer's 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game, not to hit in a no hold card game
 no hole card niyam house age main lagbhag 0
11 pratishat kii badhat karata he
 In some locations, such as some casinos in Australia and New Zealand, the player loses only his original bet, not the extra bet, if it is later discovered that the dealer has blackjack
 isamen vahi buniyadi ranneeti or vahi laabh hota he jo hold card khel main hota he
 In many casinos, usually in the table of the lowest table minimums and single deck games, a blackjack also pays only 6: 5 or 1: 1 instead of the usual 3: 2
 america main aam niyam badlaav main, blackjaik ke liye ye parivartit bhugtan khilaadi ke liye sabase zyada hanikaarak hote hai, jisaki vajah se house age main sabase zyada vruddhi hoti he
 Since blackjack occurs in about 4
8 percent of hands, a 1: 1 game increases the house edge by 2
3 percent while a 6: 5 game increases the house edge by 1
4 percent
 video blackjaik ke liye 1:1 bhugtan ek pramukh kaaran he ki yah kyon lokapriyata kii drushti se kabhi teble sanskaran tak nahin pahunch paaya he 
 In single deck games, the most commonly applied 6: 5 rule is on table blackjack - which is otherwise the most attractive game for a basic strategy player
 dealer ko sabhi push hand jeetne kii anumati dena khilaid ke liye vipattipurna hota he
 Although rarely used in standard blackjack, the game is sometimes seen in "blackjack-like" games such as some charity casinos
 agar dealer kaa apcard ek ikkaa he, to dealer dwaara apane 'hole card' kii jaanch karne se pehle khilaadi ko insurance lene kaa vikalp diya jaataa he
 a separate bet up to half the original bet placed in a particular part of the insurance table is usually marked as "insurance page 2 to 1"
 is bagali daanv kii peshkash tab kii jaati he jab dealer kaa pradarshit card ek ikkaa hota he
 The assumption is that there is a high probability that the dealer's second card will be tened which gives the dealer a blackjack and often results in the player losing
 
 This attracts the player to capitalize on this possibility by placing an "insurance" bet, which pays 1 to 2 if the dealer has a blackjack, in which case "income from insurance" of the original bet
 The concomitant will make up for the loss
 insurance daanv us vaqt nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he jab dealer ke paas blackjaik nahin hota he, haalanki khilaadi us vaqt bhi mul daanv par haar yaa jeet saktaa he
 Insurance becomes a very bad bet for a player when he is not counting cards, because, in an infinite deck, the value of the card out of 13 is ten and therefore the value of the remaining 9 is not ten
 , Then the theoretical return of an infinite deck game like this is 4 / 13 * 2 * bets - 9 / 13 * bets = -1 / 13 * bets, or -7
69%
 vyavhar main, everej house age isse kam hoga, kyonki shu se ek gaiyr-dahala card ko bhi baahar karke dealer shesh cardon ke samaanupaat kaa kaaran banataa he jinka maan das se adhik hota he
 Nevertheless, bets are usually avoided, as the average edge of the house is still more than 7 percent at that time
 cardon kii ginati karne vaala khilaadi shu main shesh tenon kii ginati kar saktaa he or keval tabhi insurance daanv laga saktaa he jab vah uske paas ek age ho iske alaava, ek multihand single deck khel main, insurance ek acha daanv ho saktaa he yadi khilaadi yun hi teble ke anya cardon ko dekhtaa he - ek aarambhik hand ke liye, yadi dealer ke paas ek ikkaa he, to deck main 51 card bache hai, jinamein se 16 ten hai
 However, if at least 2 players are playing and neither of them has two initial card ten, then 16 cards out of the remaining 47 cards are ten - better than 1 in 3, making the insurance bet a Make good bets
 jab khilaadi ke paas blackjaik or dealer ke paas ek ikkaa hota he, to "sam raashi" ke rup main insurance daanv kii peshkash kii ja saktaa he jiskaa matlab he ki dealer ke hand kii jaanch se pehle khilaadi ke blackjaik ko tatkaal 1:1 se bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 'even sum' is just a slightly different bet; The difference is that the player must have enough money to insure blackjack in the event that an equal amount is not offered
 sam raashi lenaa aam taur par ek karaab vikalp hota he kyonki khilaadi ke do cardon main se ek card dahala hota he, isliye deck main shesh dahalon kaa samaanupaat kam hota he
 In casinos where a hole card is distributed, a dealer looking for cards with aces or tens-like values to check whether or not they have blackjack has their hole cards on a small mirror or electronic sensor on the tabletop
 Can move the corner of
 yah abhyaas hold card ko anjaane main dikhaai de jane ke jokhim ko kam kar detaa he, jisase tej ankhon vaale khilaadi isse kaaphi laabh mil saktaa he
 Some casinos offer a side bet with their blackjack games
 iske udaahranon main teen satte paane ke aadhaar par bagali daanv, thri card pokar style vaali daanv, ek joda card or anya kai shaamil hai
 For side bets, usually the player may place an additional wager with his main bet and lose or win this side bet, which does not matter the outcome of his main game
 bagali daanv kaa house age aam taur par mukhya khel ke house age se kaaphi adhik hota he
 The complete set of optimal player decisions of the first hand after manipulating a single-box game is known as basic strategy

 ek blackjaik khel kii avadhi ke dauraan, dealer un cardon ko uttarottar dikhaata chalaa jaataa he jin cardon ko use or khilaadi ke hand ke liye baanta gaya hota he
 The player makes a guess about the remaining cards to be distributed by looking carefully at the cards shown and uses these estimates or conclusions in one of the following two ways: ek vishisht card-ginati paddati card ke prayek rank ke liye ke point score lagu karti he 
 Whenever a card is shown, the calculator adds the score of that card to its current total score, which is used to place bets and make decisions based on the knowledge gained
 yah ginati "santulit" ganan paddatiyon ke liye taaja-taaja pherbadal kiye gaye deck ke liye 0 par shuru hoti he
 Unbalanced counts are often started with a number that represents the total number of decks
 kisi nirdhaarit casino main vishesh blackjaik niyamon ke aadhaar par buniyadi ranneeti house adwantage ko kam karke 1 pratishat se bhi kam kar detaa he
 If the card is counted correctly, the player can usually gain from 0 to 2 percent on the house
 card kii ginati maansik rup se kanoonee he or dhokhaa nahin mana jaataa he
 However, most casinos have the right to ban players for any reason or no reason, and card counting is often a reason for a player to be banned
 aam taur par, casino khilaadi ko suchit karegaa ki use us casino main ab blackjaik khilne nahin diya jayega or use sampatti se pratibandhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Players should be careful not to indicate that they are counting and that electronic and other counting devices are generally illegal
 buniyadi ranneeti ek khilaadi ke kul point or dealer ke drishy card par aadhaarit he
 The ideal decision of a player can depend on the structure of his hand, not just the information considered in the foundation strategy
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek khilaadi ke paas dealer ke ek 4 ke khilaaf 12 ho to use aam taur par stand karnaa chahie
 However, in a single deck game, the player must hit if he has one 10 and a 2 in 12; This is because if the player hits, he wants to get another card other than 10 and the player's hand has 10 as one of the following cards available to thwart the player or dealer
 haalanki, aisi paristhitiyon main jisamen buniyadi or sanrachana aadhaarit ranneeti kii vajah se vibhinn kaary hote hai, do nirnyon ke darmyaan pratyaashit maan kaa antar bahut kam hoga
 In addition, as the number of decks used in a blackjack game increases, both the number of structure conditions that determine the correct strategy and the improvement of the house edge using structure-based strategy will decline
 Using a structure-based strategy only reduces house edge by 0
0031% in a six-deck game, which is less than one-tenth of the improvement in a single-deck game
 card kii ginati ke alaava anya takanic casino blackjaik ke laabh ko khilaadi kii taraf swing kar sakate hai

 This technique, which is more difficult than unanimous straight card counting and requires excellent vision and visual estimation powers, gives the opportunity to fool the casino staff tracking players' antics and counting, as the Shuffle Tracker periodically direct- Flats can play and / or play in contrast to the methods of playing and placing a flat card-scorer
 blackjaik forum magazine main prakashit arnold snidar ke lekhon ne aam janata ke saamne shafal trekking ko prastut kiya
 His book, The Shuffle Trackers Cookbook, mathematically analyzed the player's edge from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug

 Double exposure blackjack is a variation of the game in which both the dealer's cards are face-up
 yah khel blaczack par sam raashi pradaan karke house age main vruddhi karata he or khilaadi barabari karne kaa mauka kho dete hai
 Double Attack Blackjack has very independent blackjack rules and an option to increase one's bet after looking at the dealer's upcard
 is khel ko ek spanish shu se baanta jaataa he or blackjaik keval sam raashi kaa bhugtan karata he
 The French and German versions "wingt-et-un" and "siebzen und Vier" do not include splitting

 asia main kai log chini blackjaik khelte hai
 This does not involve card splitting and includes other card combination rules
 kampung blackjaik chini blackjaik kaa ek malaysian rup he
 Another variant is the blackjack switch, a version in which cards are distributed to two hands for a player and allowed to switch cards
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi khilaadi ko 10-6 or 5-10 baanta jaataa he, to khilaadi 10-10 or 6-5 kaa hand banane ke liye do cardon ko switch kar saktaa he
 Natural blackjack is paid at 1: 1 instead of the standard 3: 2 and the dealer gets a 22 a push
 multiple ection blackjaik main khilaadi ek single hand main 2 yaa 3 ke bich daanv lagaataa he
 The dealer then gets one hand for each bet placed by the player on a hand

 Splitting and dabbling are still allowed

 For example, a common side-bet is a "royal Match", in which the player is paid if his first two cards are in the same suit and he gets a higher payout if both of his first cards are in a suit of Queen and King

 These side bets offer worse odds than well-played blackjack in different ways
 april 2007 main, washington rajya main blackjaik ke nae sanskaran, "thri card blackjaik", ko khilne kii anumati pradaan kii gai or ise 52 card ke ek deck ke saath khelaa jaataa he
 In this version of the game, players place a pre-bet
 uske baad khilaadiyon or dealer main se prayek ko 3 card baante jate hai
 Players make the best blackjack by using 2 or all 3 cards as per their ability
 yadi khilaadi ko acha lagata he to vah ek daanv kheltaa he jo pichley daanv ke baraabar hota he

 If the dealer does not qualify, the player is paid 1–1 on his previous bet and the push bet played
 na to koi hit karata he or na hi koi vifal hota he
 At the same time when the player makes the previous bet, he has the option to place an "ace plus" bet

 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 All these are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do
 sanyog kii anek paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par use aganeya maanakar use keval aashray bhed se nayakaarabdh, nayikaarabdh athwa ubhayaarabdh, prakaashan ke vichaar se prachhann tathaa prakaash yaa spasht or gupt tathaa prakashanprakaar ke vichaar se sankshipt, sankeern, sampannatar tathaa samrudhimaan naamak bhed kiye jate hai tathaa vipralambh ke purvanurag yaa abhilashahetuk, maan yaa ishryahetuk, pravaas, virah tathaa karun prilambh naamak bhed kiye gaye hai
 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha
 purvanurag kaaran kii drushti se gunshravan, pratyakshdarshan, chitradarshan, swapn tathaa indrajaal-darshan-janya evam raag sthirataa or chamak ke aadhaar par neeli, kusumbh tathaa manjistha naamak bhedon main baanta jaataa he
 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty
 yah yuktiyukt nahin he or inkaa antarbhaav ho saktaa he
 There are two types in the name of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in consideration of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of vivaripalambha karyaja, shapaj, sambhramaja and the popularization of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravas or the future Gachpatravas or the present and the Gatpravas or the Gharpravas, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is

 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 And they have a 10-year data retention cycle
 USB flash drive kaa prayog praayah usee uddesh se kiya jaataa he jis uddesh se flopy discs kaa kiya jaataa tha
 Due to the absence of moving parts, they are relatively small, fast, with thousands of times more capacity and are more durable and reliable
 lagbhag 2005 tak, adhikansh desktop or laptop commutaron kii aapurti ek flopy discs drive ke saath kii jaati thi, lekin haal hi main adhikansh upkarnon ne USB port ko apanaate hue flopy discs drive ko tyaag diya he
 Flash drives use the USB mass storage standard, which is natively supported by modern operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other Unix-like systems
 USB drives with USB 2
0 and 3
0 support can store more data and transfer data faster than a very large optical disk drive and can be read by most other systems such as the playstation 3
 ek flash drive main kuch bhi yantric rup se nahin chalata he; drive shabd bana hua he kyonki computer, ek yantric discs drive ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale system cmand ke prayog se hi flash drive data ko padhate or likhte hai, jahaan yah storage ek or drive ke rup main computer ke oparating system or upyogkarta interfes main pradarshit hota he
 Mechanically flash drives are very strong and can withstand anything that does not actually break the circuit board or connector
 flash drive ek chote mudrit paripath board se bana hota he jisamen circuit tatv or ek USB sambandhak hota he, jo vidyut se alag or ek plastic main surakshit hota he, dhaatu, yaa rabar khol jise, udhaaharan ke liye jeb main yaa chaabi kii chen ke saath rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The USB connector can be protected by a removable cap or folded into the body of the drive, although it is unlikely to be damaged even if unprotected
 adhikansh flash drive ek maanak tip-a USB conection kaa prayog karte hai jo unhen ek vyaktigat computer par ek port main pluging karne kii anumati detaa he, lekin anya interphes ke liye drive bhi maujuud hai

 Flash memory combines many older technologies with low cost, low power consumption and small size, made possible by recent advances in microprocessor technology
 smriti bhandaaran, pehle ke EPROM or EEPROM praudyogiki par aadhaarit tha
 They all had very limited capacity, were slow for reading and rating, required complex high voltage drive circuits, and could be rewritten only after erasing all the material in the chip
 hardware dizinron ne baad main chote "field" main bante vilopan kshetra vaale EEPROM ko viksit kiya jise bina dusron ko prabhavit kiye akele hi mitaayaa ja saktaa tha
 Changing the contents of a particular memory location involves copying the entire field to off-chip buffer memory, erasing the field, modifying the required data in the buffer and rewriting it in the same field
 iske liye computer ke kaaphi samarthan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or pc-aadhaarit EEPROM flash memory pranali aksar apni samarpit microprocesar pranali ko rakhti he
 Flash drives are a subtle version of this
 ucch gati sirial data interphes ke vikaas jaise USB ne kramik abhigam bhandaaran vaale ardhchaalak memory system ko vyavhaarya bana diya he or iske saath-saath chote, ucch-gati, kam urja vaale microprocesar pranaaliyon ke vikaas ne atyant saghan pranali main inhen shaamil karne ko sakasham banaaya
 Sequential access requires relatively less power connections to memory chips than parallel access, making the creation of multi-gigabyte drives easier
 computer, modern ke anusaar flash memory system kaa abhigam bahut kuch hard discs drive ke samaan hi karte hai, jahaan niyantrak pranali kaa, us jagah par jahaan vastav main jaankaree sangrahit he puraa niyantran hota he

 There is a small printed circuit board inside the plastic shell
 is board ke upar kuch power circuit vyavastha hoti he or sataha par nirmit kuch ekikrut paripath hote hai
 Typically, one of these ics provides an interface to the USB port, the other drives the onboard memory and another is flash memory
 drive, host ke saath samvaad karne ke liye aamtaur par USB moss storage divaais class kaa upyog karte hai
 a flash drive typically has four parts: ek aam upkaran main nimna bhi shaamil ho sakate hai: Some manufacturers try to differentiate their product by using elaborate housings that are often bulky and make it difficult for the drive to connect to the USB port
 chunki ek computer houseing par USB port conectors aksar nikat duuri par hote hai, ek USB port main ek flash drive ko plag karne se ek bagal vaala port block ho saktaa he
 Such devices may only carry a USB logo if sold with a separate extension cable
 USB flash drive ko anya saamaanya rup se laane le jane vaale saamaanon main ekikrut kiya gaya he, jaise ghadiyaan, pen or yahaan tak ki swiss faujee chaaku main bhi; anya ko novlti kennes jaise ki khilonaa kaaren yaa LEGO eenton par feet kiya gaya he
 The USB flash drive's small size, robustness, and low price make it an increasingly popular peripheral for case modding
 baari yaa bade flash drive packaging se ghatiya kaary pradarshan ho saktaa he jab ek USB port main use sidhe lagaaya jaae; ise ek USB ekstansion cabel ke prayog se sudhara ja saktaa he
 Such cables are usb-compatible, but do not conform to the USB standard
 adhikansh flash drive FAT yaa FAT 32 file system se purv formet ke saath bheje jate hai
 The ubiquity of this file system allows the drive to access almost any host device with USB support
 iske alaava, maanak FAT rakrakhaav suvidhaayen dooshit data kii marammat yaa punah praapt kiye jane kii anumati detii hai
 And since a flash drive appears to be a usb-connected hard drive to the host system, the drive can be reformatted to any file system supported by the host operating system
 difragmenting : flash drive ko difragament kiya ja saktaa he, lekin isse zyada laabh praapt nahin hota kyonki vahaan koi yantric head nahin he jo fragment se fragment ghumta ho
 Flash drives often have a larger internal sector size, meaning defragmenting means less sector access
 Defragmenting reduces drive life by creating many unnecessary writes
 sam vitaran : kuch file system ko ek puure memory divaais par kisi bhi hisse par dhyaan naa dete hue upyog vitarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he ; yah sam vitaran saral flash memory upkarnon ke jivan ko badhaata he
 Some USB flash drives have this functionality built into the software controller to prolong the life of the device, while others do not, so the end user must look at the specifications of their device before changing the file system for this reason
 hard drive : hard drive ke saath sangatta ke liye sector 512 bits lambey hote hai or pehle sector main ek master boot record or ek vibhaajan talika shaamil ho sakati he
 Therefore USB flash units can be divided into hard drives
 nakli USB flash drive kaaphi aam he
 These are typically low-capacity USB drives that are modified so that they can overtake larger-capacity drives
 When plugged into a computer, they show themselves to be of large capacity as they were sold, but when the data is written to them, the write either fails, or the drive freezes
 , Or he writes one over the other
 nakli USB drive kii jaanch or pataa lagane ke liye software upkaran maujuud hai
 The most common use of flash drives is the transport and storage of personal files such as documents, photos and videos
 Some individuals store medical alert information on medictag flash drives for use in emergencies and for disaster preparedness
 vibhinn pariveshon main prayukt flash drive kii vyapak tainaati ke saath, data or soochna suraksha kaa mudda atyant mahatv kaa bana hua he
 The use of biometrics and encryption is becoming the norm with the need for increased data security; OTFE systems such as freeotfe and truecrypt are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data
 kuch maamalon main ek surakshit USB drive ek hardware aadhaarit ancripshan pranali kaa prayog kar sakati he jo data ko majbootee se inkript karne ke liye software ke bajaay ek hardware modul kaa upyog karata he
 Flash drives are particularly popular with system and network administrators, who load them with configuration information and software used for system maintenance, troubleshooting and recovery
 unka istemaal sankramit PC main antiveyras or recovery software ke antaran ke madhyam ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he, jiske tahat ve host mashin ke data ke ek hisse ko sangrahit karne kii anumati dete hai
 As the drive's storage capacity has increased, they have replaced the need to have a number of CD roms and installers that were needed to reinstall or update a system
 flash drive kaa prayog anuprayogon ko le jane ke liye hota he jo host computer par bina instaulation ke chalate hai
 Although in theory any standalone application can be used in this way, many programs store data, configuration information, etc
 on the hard drive and registry of the host computer
 U3 company, ek vishesh flash drive se microsoft windos ke liye dizine anuprayogon ke custom sanskaran pradaan karne ke liye, drive nirmaataaon ke saath kaam karti he ; windos ko chalaa rahe ek computer main jode jane par, U3-sangat upkaran ko ek menu ko swatah lod karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 The application should be modified for the U3 platform so that it does not leave any data on the host machine
 U3 also provides a software framework for independent software vendors interested in its platform
 Ceedo ek vaikalpik utpaada he jisamen mukhya antar he ki ise drive par chalaane or le jane ke liye windos anuprayog ko sanshodhit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Similarly, other application orientation solutions and portable application builders, such as vmware thinapp or RUNZ, can be used to run software from a flash drive
 portable anuprayogon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa portable software kii soochi main paai ja sakati he, jo muft he or ek host computer ke drive yaa registry par bina kuch bhandaaran kiye, windos chalaa rahe host computer se nikal jane main sakasham he
 a recent development in the use of USB flash drives as an application carrier is the carrying out of the Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor application developed by Microsoft
 COFEE anuprayogon kaa ek set he jise sandigdh vyaktiyon se jabt computer par khoj or digital saboot nikaalane ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 Any information stored on the computer being investigated by forensic software should not change; Other forensic suites run from CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, but they cannot store data on the media from which they are played

 The film begins with Sarman and Hojo and their friends in 2016 BCE, when the young men of the ancient village of Amri get caught in a boat while traveling in their boat
 or unpar achaanak hi narbhakshi magaramachhon kaa hamalaa hota he
 Sarman fights his spear courageously and kills them
 phir unako dhokar gaanv vaapis lautate he jahaan unki nayak ke taur par jai-jayakaar hoti he
 Sarman does not sleep that night: when he loses his parents in childhood, he still feels the buzzing of his aunt's humming for several days, and when dreaming he finds a horny bizarre animal and mohenjo
 a glimpse of the vast city of Daro could be seen
 haalaanki uske chachaa kabhi bhi saraman ke mohenjo daaro jane ke faisle kii anumati nahin dete
 Eventually his uncle gives up, and advises that Mohenjo Daro is a very ruthless city and asks Sarman to take precaution on trusting anyone
 uske chachaa use ek ganda-taazib dete jo use sirf uske jinda rahane yaa mrityu ke vakt istemaal karne ko kehete hai
 With all the goods and furnishings, the business turns out as soon as Mohanjo reaches Daro, he is left staring at the vastness and splendor of the city
 yahaan ke bazaar macedonian or sumerian tathaa videshi vyapaariyon ke andekhi va anokhi saamaanon va pashuon kii bikri barabas aakarshith karti he
 Sarman learns that Mohenjo Daro's governance reins are in the hands of his chief dictator Maham and his evil son Munja
 maham kisaanon se atirikt kar ugaahi ek prastaav rakhtha he; is prastaav par nagar parishad ke ve sabhi saansad apana samarthan dete hai jo maham ke saathi he sivaay un khetihar kisaanon ke pratinidhiyon ke
 The election passes and when the representatives of the farmers expose the actions of Maham and threaten to ask - why Mahm is finally killed by the neighboring city of Harappa - Maham kills him immediately
 udhar saraman kii bhent chaani naamak sundar yuvati se hoti he, mohenjo daaro ke pramukh purohit kii beti or vah sirf 'ek ko hi' chunegi jo nagar ko mukti dilaayegaa or nai subah laaegaa
 In this way he leads a rebellion against this new tax of Mahm along with the peasants of Mohenjo Daro
 He makes a place in the elite class of the city due to his uncle's talisman, when he saves Chani from the rage of an angry horse
 Hai, then he meets his father, the head priest, recognizes him only after this meeting
 saraman or chaani logon ke saamne apane aapasi prem ko vyakt nahin kar pate lekin chaani ke ashru bayaan karte hai ki munja ke saath uskaa jabaran vivaah karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Sarman and Chani make love to each other during the dance held on the festival of New Moon and also that Sarman is the leader of the opponents
 maham fouran saraman ko mrityudand kii ghoshnaa karaata he par use ehsaas hota he use janata kaa samarthan praapt he to maham sajaa taal detaa he or behad kutilata se saraman ke samaksh bakar-zokhar khilne kii chunauti rakhata he
 The same proposal is made to Sarman that if he wins, he will free Chani from this engagement
 or vah ise manjuur karata he
 The chief priest meets Sarman in prison
 vah bataata he maham sumerianyon ke saath hadappa main shisham kii avaidh vyapaar ke kaaran hi tiraskaar kar diya gaya tha
 Like other merchants, Mahome entered Mohenjo Daro and was able to reach the city council due to this business
 vahiin maham ko mahaan sindhu nadi main vyapak sone kaa bhandar jamaa padaa he or tab maham ek badi yojana ke saath nadi main baandh banane kaa prastaav rakhata he tathaa sone kii khan ko doosraa rasta mil jaataa he or mohenjo daaro kii tijori main jamaa hone lagati he
 The wise and honest Pradhan named Shrujan opposes this plan but Maham somehow thwarts him and gets the dam constructed
 maham sona jamkhori ke jhuthe aarope main shrujan ko faansate hue giraftaar karaata he
 He regrets how he and Durjan used to get threats from Mahm if he helped the opponent Shrujan
 shrujan maaraa jaataa he
 The priest tells that Sarman is the son of Shrujan and that he will have to be freed from the tyranny of the evil Maham
 saraman kaa saamana tajik parvat ke croor aadamkhoron bakar or zokhar se ek bade ran akhaade main hota he
 In this long and heartless battle, he kills a man-eater but leaves the injured and the people of Mohenjo Daro run a wave of joy over his victory
 maham gusse main aag-babula hota he or munja se purohit va chaani kaa khaatmaa karne kahata he
 Munja impulsively reaches the holy temple and runs away towards Chani after killing the priest
 saraman chaani ko bachaata he or munja ko maar daalata he
 Sarman, leading the public, returns to the city council and challenges Mahm
 chaani maham se judi ek yojana kaa pardaafash karti he ki vah sindhu ke sone kii jamkhori kar khud abheer hone chalaa tha or pashchim se tambe or kaanse ke shastron kii taskari karata he
 On this support received by Sarman, all the heads of the city council give verdict against Maham
 janata bataur nae pradhan ke rup main saraman kaa chayan karti he lekin saraman kaa suzav rahata he ki mohenjo daaro ke logon ko sarkaar kii aavashyaktaa he naa kisi pradhan kii
 The dam built on the Indus River, gradually starts to crumble due to floods
 saraman ko ehsaas hota he ki baandh jald tutegaa or samooche nagar ko jalmagn kar daalega
 Earlier, the river completely ruins the dam, Sarman asks all the people to join the boats together and make a floating bridge
 mohenjo daaro lagbhag khaali pad jaataa he or pul ko nadi ke duusare chor tak le jaaya jaataa he
 The dam is destroyed and the river enters the city with great speed
 nagar ke chauraahey par zanjeeron main bandhaa maham, is sailaab main dub jaataa he
 The great Mohenjo Daro disappears
 agali subah tak sindhu nadi shant padati he or vah log behate hue purvi himalay pahonchte hai
 People feel along the Chani River that the prophecy has been proven true: it was a new dawn
 saraman ko bhi tab duusare chor vah ek-sing vaala pashu dikhaai pad jaataa he
 People whisper about the new name of this river

 andolan apane duusare charan main synthetic cubism ke naam se badha or lagbhag 1919 tak mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii, jab tak ki atiyathartwaadee andolan ne lokapriyata nahin hasil kar lee
 The English art historian Douglas Cooper describes three stages of cubism in his seminal book, The Cubist Epic
 kupar ke anusaar "praarambhik cubism" tha jab shuruuaat main picasso or baraak ke studio main andolan viksit kiya gaya tha, duusare charan ko "ucch cubism" kaha jaataa he, jis dauraan juaan gris mahatvapurn pratipadak ke rup main ubhare or aakhir main kupar ne "antim cubism" ko kattarpanthi nav-vichaarak kala andolan kaa aakhri charan kaha
 In Cubist painting, objects are broken, analyzed, and re-created separately, rather than from a point of view, representing the artist in a larger context than many other perspectives
 aksar sataha yadrichhik konon par ek duusare ko katate prathit hote hai or gaharaai kii susangat samaj ko khatm kar dete hai
 The flat surface of the background and objects interact and create a shallow ambiguous space, which is one of the special features of Cubism
 angreji kala itihaaskaar, sangrahakartta or da cubist ipak ke lekhak duglas kupar ne paul gogyuin or paul sezen ke bare main kaha he ki "ye donon hi kalakaar cubism ke gathan ke vishesh rup se or 1906 se 1907 ke dauraan picasso ke chitron se prabhavit the"
 kupar kehete hai ki les demoicelis ko aksar galati se pehali cubist chitrakala ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 they tell, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki cubism kii jadon ko sezen ke baad ke kaamon main do alag pravritiyon main paaya gaya: sabase pehle range hue sataha ko rangon ke chote bahupaksheeya kshetron main todane ke liye, baad main doorabeen drushtikon dwaara di gayi is mishrit drushti par jor dena or doosraa belanon, vritton ke prakritik roopon ke sarleekaran main ruchi ke jariye
 However, this concept was further explored by Cubist after Cézanne, who represented all the surfaces of the objects represented in the same picture, as if all the faces of the objects were visible at the same time
 This new style of illustration revolutionized the way objects were viewed in painting and art
 cubism ke avishkaar main paris ke montmari ke nivaasiyon picasso or baraak kaa sanyukt prayaas shaamil tha

 donon kalakaaron ne 1908 ke aakhir or 1909 ke shuru se ek saath milakar kaam karnaa shuru kiya or 1914 main pratham vishwa yuddh chhidane tak saath kaam kiya
 The movement quickly spread to Paris and throughout Europe
 francisi kala sameekshak louis woxelus ne 1908 main baraak dwaara banaaye gaye ek chitra ko dekhne ke baad pehali baar "cubism" yaa "bijaare cubics" shabd kaa prayog kiya
 He described it as "filled with small cubes", which soon led to widespread use of the term, although it was not initially adopted by these two creators
 kala itihaaskaar ernest gombrich ne cubism ko "aspashtataa kaa safaya karne or tasviir ke, jo ek maanav nirmit nirmaan, ek ranga hua canvas hota he, ke ek paath ko bal dene- ke sarvaadhik moulik prayaas" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Cubism was adopted by many artists in Montparnasse and encouraged by art trader Daniel Henry Conwiller, it became popular so quickly that a "cubic school" of artists was referred to by critics in 1911
 haalanki, apane ko cubist samajhane vaale anek kalakaar aisi dishaao main chale gaye jo baraak or picasso ke nirdeshon se kaaphi alag thim
 The Putoux group or section was an important branch of the d'or Cubist movement, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp with his brothers Raymond duchamp-villon and Jacques Villon, and Fernad Lazar and Francis Picabio
 cubism ke saath jude anya mahatvapurn kalakaaron main dusron ke saath : albert gleizes jin metginger, meri lorencin, maiks webar, diego revera, meri vorobieff, lui mercousis, jin rij-rossau, roger di laa fresnaye, henry le faukanier, alexander archipenko, frantisek kupka, amidi ogenphant, jin marchand, leopold sarvej, patric henry bruce bhi shaamil hai

 purism cubism kii pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad viksit ek kalatmak shakha he, purism ke pramukh samarthakon main le corbusier, amidi ogenphant or fernand lager shaamil hai
 Cubism and modern European art arrived in the United States in 1913, when Jacques Villon displayed seven important and large dry points at New York City's famous Arsenal Show
 1920 se pehle baraak or picasso swayan kai mahatvapurn charnon se gujarey or inamen se kuch kaamon ko shastraagaar sho ke pehle neuyork main alfred stieglitz kii "291" gailaree main dekha ja chukaa tha
 The Czech artists, realizing the neoclassical importance of Picasso and Barak's Cubism, attempted to extract all branches of artistic creation — particularly painting and its components — for their personal work of architecture
 yah check cubism main viksit hua, jo cubism ke un check samarthakon kaa nav-vichaarak kala andolan tha jo 1910 se 1914 ke bich zyaadaatar praha main sakriy the
 Analytical Cubism was one of the two major branches of the artistic movement of Cubism and developed between 1908 and 1912
 synthetic cubism ke vipareet vishleshnatmak cubyston ne prakritik roopon kaa "vishleshan" kiya or in roopon ko do aiami chitra patal par buniyadi jyamitiya bhaagon main kam kiya
 In addition to a monochromatic scheme that often included blue, brown, and ocher colors, the use of color was almost non-existent

 There is a shared use of stylistic similarities in the works by Picasso and Barak during this movement

 Shortly after the death of Paul Cézanne in Paris in 1907 there was a large museum retrospective exhibition of his works
 pradarshnee sezen ko ek mahatvapurn chitrakaar ke rup main sthapit karne main atyadhik prabhaavshaalee rahi jiske vichaar mukhyatah paris ke yuva kalakaaron ke liye vishesh rup se gunjyman rahe
 Both Picasso and Barak drew inspiration for Cubism from Paul Cézanne, who said that to observe and learn, look at nature and behave as if it were formed from basic shapes such as cubes, circles, cylinders, and cones

 Synthetic Cubism was the second major movement within Cubism that was developed between 1912 and 1919 by Picasso, Barack and Juan Gris

 This was the beginning of the introduction of collage material as an important component in the work of art

 picasso or baraak main ek duusare se ek dostana pratiyogita thi or kaaryon main aksharon ko shaamil karnaa unke khel kaa ek vistaar ho saktaa he
 While analytical cubism was an analysis of subjects, synthetic cubism is mostly about pushing multiple objects together
 vishleshnatmak cubism kii tulana main kam shuddh synthetic cubism main kam planar tabadili or kam chhayankan he jo samtal sthaan banaata he
 Cubist sculpture was developed in parallel by many artists of Cubist painting
 vibhinn strot pehali cubist murti ke taur par yaa to picasso kii 1909 kii pital kii head of a vuman kaa athwa kii murti yaa 1912 main praha main dikhaai gayi otto gatfreund kii anziti kaa naam lete hai
 Many other European sculptors were quick to follow his example, the Frenchman Raymond duchamp-villon, whose career ended in his death in military service, the Ukrainian Alexander Archipenko, whose 1912 Walking Woman who first applied a separate void And Lithuanian Jacques Lipchitz was one of the first painters identified as Cubist sculptor
 keval cubist chitra kii tarah, is style ne paul sezen ke ghatak samatalon or jyamitiya thoson, vrutt or shanku) main chitrit vastuon kii kami main apni jaden jamaa leen
 And as a mere painting, it paved its way in about 1925 and made a fundamental contribution to constructivism and futurism and became a widespread influence
 gartrud sten ke likhit kaaryon main maarg or puure adhyyon donon main imaarat ke blokon ke rup main aavriti or aavrityaatmak vaakyanshon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique has been used in most of Stan's important works, including the novel The Making of Americans, he was not only the first important patron of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and his brother Leo were also important influences on Cubism
 kram main sten ke lekhan par picasso kaa ek mahatvapurn prabhaav tha
 William Faulkner's 1930 novel Age i Lay Dying in the field of American novelism can be read as interacting with the Cubist way
 is upanyaas main 59 paatro ke vividh anubhavon ke varnan hai, jinhen jab ek saath joda jaataa he to ve ek ekal saamanjasy yukt dhaanche kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Poets commonly associated with Cubism include Guillaume Apollinaire Bless Senders Jean Cocto Max Jacob Andre Salmon and Pierre Reverdi
 america kavi kenneth rexroth ke vivaran ke anusaar kavita main cubism "ek jaagruk, savichaar viyojan or kathor vaastukala kii hadabandi main swayan sampoorn tatwon ke punarsangyojan se bani ek nai kalatmak ikai he
 It is quite different from the free union of surrealists and a combination of subliminal expression and Dada's political nihilism
 " baharhaal, cubist kaviyon kaa prabhaav cubism or baad ke dada or atiyatharthwaad ke andolanon donon par he; yatharthwaad ke sansthaapak sadsy lui aragon ne breton, supalt, aluard or apane liye kaha tha, reverdi hamaare "tatkaaleen varisht, anukaraniya kavi hai
 "although they are not as well remembered as Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire the American poet John Ashbery and Ron Padgett has recently made new translations of Reverdy's works
 voles steevence kii "thartin veg of looking at a blackbird" ke bare main bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah darshaati he ki cubism ke ekaadhik drushtikonon kaa kavita main kaise anuwaad kiya ja saktaa he
 The composer Edgard Vares was strongly influenced by Cubist art and writing
 ek kala andolan se bahut dur kala ke itihaas ke purv vrutanton tak simit cubism or isaki parampara ne anek samakaleen kalakaaron ke kaam kii jaankaree dena jari rakhaa he
 Cubist painting is not just a regular commercial use, but a significant number of contemporary artists have continued to draw stylistically and, perhaps more importantly, theoretically even today
 uttararddh main cubism ke prati kalakaaron ke liye sthaayee aakarshan ke kaaran ke suraag shaamil hai
 With photography's ever-increasing importance as a viable way of drawing portraits, Cubism as a representational cult of painting inevitably moves from representational painting to mechanistic photography and to a completely static audience
 Let's try to go beyond the limits of the traditional single point perspective
 20 veen sadi main armbh main cubism ke praarambhik rup se prakat hone ke samay kai pratinidhitivvaadi kalakaaron ke liye jo prashn or siddhant uthe the ve aaj bhi usee rup main vartmaan hai jaise tab the jab unhen pehali baar prastaavit kiya gaya tha

 jis samay bharat main bhagwaan mahavir or buddha dharm ke sambadh main nae vichaar rakh rahen the, china main bhi ek sudhaarak kaa janm hua, jiskaa naam kanceyushious tha
 At that time, the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou Dynasty was going on in China
 samay ke saath jhou rajvansh kii shakti shithil padane ke kaaran china main bahut se rajya kaayam ho gayi, jo sadaa aapas main ladate rahete the, jise jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal kaha jane laga
 Therefore, the people of China were suffering a lot
 aise samay main china vaasiyon ko naitikta kaa paath padhaane hetu mahatma kanceyucious kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He was born in Shandong region of China, about 550 years before the birth of Jesus Christ
 bachapan main hi unke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 The aspiration for his knowledge was limitless
 bahut adhik ksht karke unhen gyaan arjan karnaa padaa tha
 At the age of 17, he got a government job
 kuch hi varshon ke baad sarkari naukari chhodkar ve shikshan kaary main lag gayi
 He started giving education to students by opening a school at home
 ve maukhik rup se vidhyaarthiyon ko itihaas, kavy or nitishastra kii shiksha dete the
 He wrote several books on poetry, history, music and ethics
 53 varsh kii umr main lu rajya main ek shahar ke ve shashankarta tathaa baad main ve mantri pad par niyukt hue
 As a minister, he emphasized on the improvement of human character in lieu of punishment
 kanceyucious ne apane shishyon ko satya, prem or nyaay kaa sandesh diya
 He used to put more emphasis on virtue
 ve logon ko vinayi, paropkaaree, guni or charitravaan banane kii prerana dete the
 ve bado env purvajon ko aadar-sammaan karne ke liye kehete the
 ve kehete the ki dusron ke saath vaisaa vartav na karo jaisaa tum swany apane saath nahin karnaa chaahate ho
 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher
 unhone ishwar ke bare main koi upadesh nahin diya, parantu phir bhi baad main log unhen dharmik guru maanane lage
 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him
 kintu uske pautra tje sje dwaara likhit 'ausat kaa siddhant' or uske shishy tsong sin dwaara likhit 'mahan shiksha' naamak pustakon main tatsambandhi samast suchnaayen praapt hoti hai
 a treatise called 'spring and Autumn', which is also called the chronicle of Lu, is said to be written by Confucius
 yah samoochee kriti praapt he or yadhyapi bahut choti he tathaapi china ke sankshipt itihaason ke liye adarsh maani jaati he
 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes
 Can provide
 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he
 The philosophy based on philosophical, social and political views of Confucianism is called Confucianism or Kungphutism
 kanfushas ke matanusaar bhalaai manushya kaa swaabhaavik gun he
 Man has got this natural quality from God
