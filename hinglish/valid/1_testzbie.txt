 hakim abul kasim firdausi tusi farsi kavi the
 He composed the Shahnama which later became the national epic of Persia

 Firdausi was born in 920 AD in a town called Tus in Khorasan
 asadi naamak kavi ne use shiksha di or kavita kii ore prerit kiya
 He gave him a treatise on the mythological kings of Iran, on the basis of which Firdausi composed the Shahnama
 isamen 60,000 sher hai
 He was busy with this great work for 35 years and completed it on 25 February 1010 AD
 is samay vah 85 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 He dedicated this poem to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who conquered Khorasan in 999 AD
 use keval 20 hajaar dirham pradaan kiye gaye
 Firdausi's body was set on fire
 vah apane desh se hiraat kii ore bhaaga kintu bhaagane se purv ek kavita shahname main jod gaya, jisamen sultan mahmud kii ghor ninda kii gai he
 In the Shahnama, Firdausi praised the legendary emperor of Iran, whose exploits he was greatly influenced by, the elder
 uski kavita se pracheen iran ke prati uskaa prem evam arabon ke prati ghrinaa kaa puraa abhas miltaa he
 In order to possibly satisfy the staunch Muslims, he later wrote Yusuf Zulikha, a masnavi dedicated to the Bavid ruler Bahauddaula and his son Sultanuddaula
 taduparant vah apni mathrubhumi toos laut aayaa or vahiin uski mrityu hui 
 His grave is in the sights of Iran

 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity

 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed
 firdausi ne rustam or soharaab jaise paatr nirmit kiye hai jo maanav-smriti kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 There is a beautiful garden around the tomb of Firdausi, as Iranians have done with their great poets

 Special episodes of his poetry are engraved on marble

 tantrika sankuchan peshi ke mansapeshiyon ke sankuchan ko niyantrit karne ke liye, nirdhaaran sankhya, anukram or bal ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Much of the power potential that a muscle can generate is mostly required in movement, and impatient fatigue is rarely an issue except for deformity

 Lack of energy, ie sub-optimal aerobic metabolism, usually resulting in accumulation of lactic acid and other anaerobic metabolic IC acids in the muscle, causes a burning sensation in localized muscle fatigue, although recent studies suggest Otherwise it has been discovered that lactic acid is actually an energy source
 mansapeshi thakaan ke paridhiy or kendriya siddhanton ke bich buniyadi antar yah he ki mansapeshiyon kii thakaan ke paridhiy model shrinkhalaa ki mansapeshi sankuchan aarambh main ek yaa adhik citon par vifaltaa ho jaati he
 Peripheral regulation is therefore dependent on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local affected muscle, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that acts to protect the muscle degeneration by initiating muscle fatigue from the base of the monolithic system, the periphery of the collective response
 The medium precedes cellular or organ failure
 isliye ye raay he ki is kendriya niamak dwaara padhaa jaataa he rasinic or yantric ke saath hi sangyanatmak sanket bhi shaamil ho sakate hai

 Through the release of calcium by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, the cells signal to work by contracting, which a flow to detect electrical impulses from the brain
 Fatigue can be caused by the nerve itself, or within the muscle cells

 Their story is that when Lord Vishnu conceived the creation with his Yoga Maya for the purpose of creation of the universe, a lotus came out of his navel on which a man was sitting, because his origin was for the purpose of creation of the universe and creation of creation

 inhone srist kii rachana ke kram main dev-asur, gandharva, apsara, stri-purush pashu-pakshi ko janm diya
 In this sequence, Yamraj was also born, who received the name of Dharmaraja because according to the religion, he got the task of punishing the creatures
 dharmraj ne jab ek yogya sahyogi kii maang brahma ji se kii to brahma ji dhyanaleen ho gayi or ek hajaar varsh kii tapasya ke baad ek purush utpann hua
 This man was born from the body of Brahma, so he is called Kayastha and he was named Chitragupta

 One day of Aashaadh focuses on the personal life of Mahakavi Kalidas, which was spent in the period from 100 BCE to 500 AD
 is naatak kaa sheershak kalidas kii kriti meghdutam kii shuruaati panktiyon se liya gaya he
 Since the month of Ashadh is the initial month of the rainy season in North India, the title can also be taken to mean "one day of the rainy season"
 asadha kaa ek din ek trikhandia naatak he
 In the first section, the young man Kalidas is living peacefully in his village in the Himalayas and developing his art
 vahaan uskaa ek yuvati, mallika, ke saath prem-sambandh bhi he
 The first stance of the play changes when some courtiers from far away Ujjayini meet Kalidasa and ask him to walk into the court of Emperor Chandragupta Vikramaditya
 kalidas asamanjas main pad jaataa he: ek taraf uskaa sundar, shaanti or prem se bharaa gaanv kaa jivan he or duusari taraf ujjayini ke rajdurbar se prashray paakar mahanata chhu lene kaa avasar
 Mallika wishes that the man she loves has success in life and she advises Kalidas to go to Ujjayini
 baari man se kalidas ujjayini chalaa jaataa he
 In the second section of the play, it is known that in Kalidasa's Ujjayini, there is a lot of drama and his fame is spread everywhere
 uskaa vivaah ujjayini main hi ek aakarshak or kuleen stri, priyangumanjri, se ho chukaa he
 Mallika is sad and left alone in the village there
 kalidas or priyangumanjri, apane ek sevakon ke dal ke saath, kalidas ke puraane gaanv aate hai
 Kalidas does not go to meet Mallika, but goes to Priyangumanjari
 vah mallika se sahanubhuti jataati he or kahati he kii vah use apni sakhi bana legi or uskaa vivaah kisi rajasevak se karvaa degi
 Mallika categorically denies such assistance
 naatak ke tritiy or antim khand main kalidas gaanv main akele hi aa dhamkata he
 It is reported to Mallika that Kalidas was made the Governor of Kashmir but he has come to renounce everything
 nissahay mallika tab tak ek veshya ban chuki he or uski ek choti se beti he
 Kalidas comes to meet Mallika but, seeing these truths of Mallika's life, leaves completely disappointed
 naatak isi jagah samaapti par pahunchataa he
 a reviewer of the play states that at the end of every segment of the play, "kalidas leaves Mallika alone: first when he leaves Ujjayini alone; second when he does not deliberately meet Mallika even when he comes to the village; and thirdly when he Suddenly turns away from Mallika's house
 " yah naatak darshata he ki kalidas ke mahanata paane ke prayaas kii mallika or kalidas ko kitni badi qeemat chukaani padati he
 When Kalidas leaves Mallika and settles in Ujjayini, his fame and status increases but his creation power is gone
 uski patni, priyangumanjri, is prayaas main juty rahati he ke ujjayini main bhi kalidas ke ird-gird uske gaanv jaisaa vaataavaran bana rahe "lekin vah swayan mallika kabhi nahin ban paati
 "at the end of the play, when Kalidasa last talks to Mallika, he confesses that" The man standing in front of you is not the Kalidas you knew
 " In his second play, Mohan Rakesh wrote that "while reading Meghdoot, i used to think that the story is not as much of the exiled Yaksha as that of a poet exiled from his own soul, who adapted his own crime-perception into this hypothesis Have given
 " mohan rakesh ne kalidas kii isi nihit aparaadh-anubhuti ko "asadha kaa ek din" kaa aadhaar banaaya

 But the sound of both the Pallava and Pahlav names is not sufficient to prove it
 dakshini bharat main pahlvon ko uttarapath main or pallvon ko dakshinapath main rahanevaala kahkar donon main spasht antar dikhalaayaa he
 The word Pallava was originally the Sanskrit form of Tamil Tondair and Tondaman
 pallvon kii tamil utpatti maananevaale vidvan pallvon kaa tirayar or gurjar logon se sameekaran batalaate hai
 a scholar has unsuccessfully tried to prove the word Pallava as derived from the Tamil language, in the sense of milk milker or gule

 starit shailavigyaan yaa stariki bhoumiki kii vah yah shakha he jiske antargat prithvi ke shailasamoohon, khanijon or prithvi par paae janevaale jeev-jantuon kaa adhyayan hota he
 The layered rockology provides us with information about the various changes that have taken place on the surface of the Earth since its inception
 shailon or khanijon ke adhyayan ke liye stariki, shailavigyaan kii sahaayta letaa he or jeevashm avasheshon ke adhyayan main purajeevigyaan kii
 The aim of the study of layered rock science is to gain knowledge about the development and history of the Earth
 starit shailavigyaan na keval prithvi ke dharaatal par paae janevaale shailasamoohon ke vishay main gyaan pradaan karata he, balki yah puraatan bhugol, jalwaayu or jeev jantuon kii bhi ek jhalak pradaan karata he or ham starit shailavigyaan ko prithvi ke itihaas kaa ek vivaran kah sakate hai
 Layered rock science is sometimes called historical geology, which is really just a branch of layered rock science
 itihaas main pichhali ghatnaon kaa ek kramvaar vivaran hota he; par starit shailavigyaan puraatan bhugol or vikaas par bhi prakaash daalata he
 Zoologists rely on layered rockology concerning ancestors of organisms
 vanaspativigyaani bhi puraane paudhon ke vishay main apana gyaan starit shailavigyaan se praapt karte hai
 If layered rockology was not there, the knowledge of geologists would also have been limited to the modern form of the Earth
 shilpavaigyanik ko bhi starit shailavigyaan ke gyaan ke bina andhere main hi kadam uthaane padate
 Thus layered rock science is a very detailed science which is not limited to rocks and minerals, but covers all the subjects in its periphery which are related to the earth
 starit shailavigyaan ke do niyam hai jinako starit shailavigyaan ke niyam kehete hai
 In fact, these rules, which were formulated many years ago, are unable to give complete details about layered rock science

 Over time, igneous action, metamorphosis and transfer of rock formations have also changed the form of the Earth
 is prakaar vartmaan pramaanon or upar die niyamon ke aadhaar par prithvi kaa teen arab varsh purana itihaas nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 To know the ancient history of the earth, one has to resort to many other things
 starit shailavigyaani kaa mukhya dhyey he kisi sthaan par paae janevaale shailasamoohon kaa vishleshan, namakaran, vargeekaran or vishwa ke starshailon se unki samatulyata sthapit karnaa
 He also has to give a detailed description of the ancient fauna, geography and climate

 There are many shortcomings in the history of each continent
 isiilie prayek mahadweep se milanevaale pramaanon ko ekatra karke unke aadhaar par prithvi kaa sampurna itihaas nirmit kiya jaataa he
 But this is a method that cannot be fully believed and therefore it is not possible to establish exactly the same equivalence between rock formations found in different parts of the earth
 inhen kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye starit shailavigyaani samatulyata ke badale samasthanik shabd prayog main laate hai jiskaa arth he vyavastha kii sadrushta
 The evolution of organisms in ancient times was not uniform and uniform

 Organisms that are found abundantly in temperate climates will not be able to survive in hot climates or there will be a huge decrease in their numbers

 The owner is required to pay 5000 / - for vehicle registration and 5000 / - for driver registration

 ek baar vaahanon jisase vaahanon kii ek saamaanya pool banane panjikrut hai, vibhaag ne panjikrut vaahanon kii ek suchi khinchataa he
 Since the number of vehicles allowed to enter the park are not limited, the department allowed a limited number of vehicles entering the park for the morning shift and another batch of vehicles for the evening shift and On the bottom line
 Vehicles that are registered with the department are generally not limited, a vehicle that has gone on a shift either in the morning or in the evening, does not receive for another day or two after the number of turns

 The challenge for this system by the appellant is that - this results in disrupting tourism and affecting foreign exchange earnings

 It is also pointed out that there is not much difference between roster system and open system except for roster system for tourists to be included in the vehicle along with the guide provided by the forest department and the choice does not matter according to the hotel owner
 Or the person organizing the tour or the tourists themselves
 Both the Rosier system and the open system controls the number of vehicles allowed to enter the park in a given innings

 At the same time, it will ensure the long-term health of both the ecosystem and the tourism economy to maintain a careful balance between conservation of wildlife and sustainable development in the forest, to be just and fair
 The policy of eco-economic means and incentives should be developed to ensure that tourism activities which require the protection of nature and biodiversity include raising funds from tourism
 Eco-friendly tourism should be based on the concept
 Tourism activities which directly or indirectly contribute to the conservation of nature and biodiversity and which benefit should be promoted to local communities
 T! It can be seen that tourism activities should be environmentally, economically, socially and culturally sustainable
 One way of tourism is to benefit local communities, strengthen the local economy, Employment should be developed in the local work force
 To ensure all these aspects, the policy of tourism should be such that where tourists are not put for inconvenience
