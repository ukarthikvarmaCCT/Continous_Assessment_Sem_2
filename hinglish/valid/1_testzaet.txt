 They got married in Holyrood Palace on 29 July 1565, even when both of them were Catholic and cousins were not allowed to marry
 vivaah ke pashchaat darnle england ke apane ghar se mairi ke paas scotland chale gayi
 But this marriage worried Elizabeth as both Darnley and Mary were descendants of her aunt Margaret and therefore the collective claim of both to the throne of England was more influential and whose children would become strong and prominent contenders for the English throne
 haalanki mairi kaa vivaah ke liye raji hona satta ke liye rajanithik guna-bhaag se zyada darnle ke prati unke aakarshan se zyada prabhavit tha

 Mary expanded her advisory committee and this time gave equal space to both Catholics and Protestants
 zyada samay nahin beetaa tha ki darnle ghamandi hota gaya
 Overcoming his limits as the queen's husband, he sought the matrimonial crown
 aisa hone se vah scotland ke sinhansan kaa sah adhikari ho jaataa or swayan se pehle apni patni yani rani kii mrityu hone par scotland kaa kanoonee raja ho jaataa
 Mary rejected his request and since then their marital relationship has become bitter

 This journey, which was extremely difficult for a woman, was later offered as evidence against her by Mary's enemies to prove her and the Earl of Bothwell to be each other's lovers
 haalaanki us samay kisi ko aisa koi shaq nahin hua tha kyonki mairi apane surakshakarmiyon or salaahkaaron ke saath gayi thim

 6 may ko mairi or bothewel edinburgh laut gayi or 15 may ko unhone holirud mahal yaa holirud aibe main protestant rivaajon se shaadi kar lee
 Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell, who was the sister of Samantha Huntley, were divorced twelve days earlier
 shuru main mairi ko laga ki bahut saare prabhuddh janon ne uske bothewel ke saath vivaah ko sahi mana he or samarthan kiya he lekin bothewel jo ki ab rani kaa pati ban chukaa tha or uskaa ohada dusron se unchaa ho gaya tha kaa darbar main anya mantriyon or darbariyon ke saath sambandh katu hone lag gaya tha
 This marriage had become extremely unpopular among the people
 catholicon ne shaadi ko gaiyr kanoonee mana kyunki wo bothwel ke talaak or protestant rivaajon se hui shaadi ko vaazib nahin maanate the
 Both Protestants and Catholics were not sure that Mary would marry the murderer of her former husband
 shaadi se mairi kii jindagi main tufaan aa gaya tha or vah behad niraash va hataash ho gayin thim
 26 The courtiers and the feudatories, who were the masters of various cities or princely states in Scotland, turned against Mary and Bothwell and began to form armies against them

 Bothwell was allowed to go safe from the battlefield, but the feudal prisoners held Mary captive and took her to Edinburgh, where Bheed slammed her, questioning her character

 The next night Mary is imprisoned in the Lok Levan Fort located in the center of Lok Levan Island

 mairi ne sochaa tha ki elizabeth waapas scotland kii satta paane main unki madad karengi
 But Elizabeth was cautious, she set up an inquiry into 26 rebels against Mary and any possibility of Mary being involved in Darnley's death
 july 1568 ke madhya main angrej adhikariyon ne mairi ko scottish seemaa se behad dur bolton ke kile main sthaanantarit kar diya
 Between October 1568 and January 1569, an inquiry team first met in York and later in Westminster
 jabaki scotland main unke samarthak kaarywahi shaasha more va uske uttaradhikariyon ke khilaaf grihayuddh karte rahe
 As a queen, Mary refused to have the power to prosecute her in any court and to make a personal appearance during the trial in York
 mairi ne adaalat main apane pratinidhi bheje lekin elizabeth ne unki upasthiti ko nishedh kar diya
 As evidence against Mary, More showed some perfumes called chests or letters
 —ye wo 8 ahastakshrit sandook kii chiththiyaan thim jinke bare main kaha gaya ki mairi ne bothewel ko bheji hai
 They contained two marriage papers, and a 14-line love poem found in a foot-long silver chest equipped with the seal of a King Francis 2
 mairi ne in chitthiyon se anbhigyata jataai or kaha ki unki lekhnee kaa anusaran kar ke vaisaa hi likhnaa koi mushkil kaam nahi he or chitthiyon par unke hastakshar bhi nahin hai isaliye ye jhuthe hai
 These letters were considered very important because they described feelings of self-immolation over the murder of Mary Darnley
 jaanch dal ke adhyaksh norflock ke duk ne in patron ko behad gambhir or bhayankar or naanaa prakaar ke prempurna geeton vaala mana or elizabeth ko unki pratiyaan yah kahte hue bhijwa deen ki agar ye asli hai to mairi doshi hai
 The authenticity of these letters of the Ark has been the subject of controversy among historians
 ab to inke bare main kuch sabit kar paanaa bhi namumkin he
 These letters written in French were probably destroyed by Mary's son in 1584
 kuch bachi hui pratiyaan jinka angreji main anuwaad he bhi wo bhi purna nahin hai
 Other documents examined were copies of the divorce granted to Gordon of Bothwell, which Morey had ordered from Dunbar
 mairi ke jeevani ke lekhak jaise kii, antonia freizer, ellison veir or jon gaai yah nateeja nikaalte hai ki yaa to ye patr puri tarah se nakli the yaa inamen jaanboojh ke kuch aise anuchhed jode gayi the jo mairi ke khilaaf saboot ban sakate the
 Or these letters were written by some other person to Bothwell or Mary was written to some other person

 However, some sections and epigraphs and some writing styles present in the letters correspond to Mary's style of writing
 sandook ke patron ko 1568 kii sammelan se pehle kabhi jari nahin kiya gaya tha
 However, the Scottish court saw them only in 1567
 mairi ko jabaran apana pad tyaag karne ko kaha gaya or lagbhag ek varsh tak unhen jail main rahanaa padaa
 These letters were never made public to justify the action of sending Mary to jail and denying her the post of queen
 itihaaskaar jeni vormald kaa vishwaas he ki scotishon kaa in chitthiyon ko saarvajanik naa karnaa or 1584 main unhen nasht kar dena is baat kaa sanket he ki inamen mairi ke khilaaf pukhta saboot the jabaki veir sochate hai ki yah ghatnakram darshata he ki scottish samant jo mairi ke virdohi the unhone itnaa samay in chitthiyon ko banane main lagaaya
 However, there are some contemporaries of Mary who saw these letters and believe in the truth of them, such as the Duke of Norfolk, who had a secret plan to marry Mary during the trial, but was told by Elizabeth He refuses this, saying that he does not think of marrying a woman with whom he does not know yet

 Elizabeth concluded the investigation as she wished that there was no firm evidence against Mary or her anti-scottish feudatories and nothing was proved

 That is why this investigation was considered as a political scholar
 antat: more scotland laut gaya or mairi ko karawas main hi rakhaa gaya
 In this way, Elizabeth managed to maintain a Protestant government, displaying neither friendship nor hostility to the queen there in Scotland

 In February 1585, William Parry, a detective, was arrested for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth

 On 25 October, all the judges, except Mary 1, considered her guilty and sentenced her to death
 iske baavjood elizabeth unhen maut kii sajaa dene se hichak rahi thim
 Despite the pressure from the English Parliament, she was concerned that the death penalty to a queen could trigger a wrong tradition, and the consequences could be grave, especially when the son of Mary and King James of Scotland 6 Catholic Invade England by forming alliances with groups
 elizabeth ne mairi ke antim rakshak paulet se poocha ki kya wo mairi ko mrityudand dene kii bajaae unki umr kam karne kaa koi or avaidh tarika dhund sakate hai, jise usne yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki uski antaratma aisa karne kii izaajat nahin detii or aisa kar ke wo apane vanshajon ke naam par kaala dhabba nahin chhodna chahta

 On the platform, there was a pillow on which Mary had to sit down and place her head in a wooden mold

 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as " that had characterized older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B
 Cowan also produced more balanced works
 Historian Jenny Wormald looked that Mary was a tragic failure, who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her, but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post-fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen
 There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell
 Such accusations rest on assumptions, and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as "almost complete fantasy"
 Mary's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy

 Which includes Konkan, Goa and Kerala

 In ancient times, a king named Gadhi ruled in Kannauj

 King Gadhi married Satyavati to Bhrigunandan Rishiak
 satyavati ke vivaah ke pashchaat vahaan bhrigu rishi ne aakar apni putravadhu ko aashirwad diya or usase var maangane ke liye kaha
 Seeing this, Satyavati pleaded with the son of a son for his mother
 satyavati kii yachana par bhrigu rishi ne use do charu paatr dete huye kaha ki jab tum or tumhaari mata ritu snaan kar chuki ho tab tumhaari maan putr kii ichha lekar pipal kaa aalingan karnaa or tum usee kaamana ko lekar gooler kaa aalingan karnaa
 Then take these variables given by me with caution separately
 idhar jab satyavati kii maan ne dekha ki bhrigu ne apane putravadhu ko uttam santaan hone kaa charu diya he to usne apane charu ko apni putree ke charu ke saath badal diya
 In this way Satyavati consumed her mother's charu
 yogashakti se bhrigu ko is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya or ve apni putravadhu ke paas aakar bole ki putree! tumhaari mata ne tumhaare saath chal karke tumhaare charu kaa seven kar liya he
 Therefore, now your child will behave like a Kshatriya despite being a Brahmin and your mother's child will behave like a Brahmin despite being a Kshatriya
 is par satyavati ne bhrigu se vinati kii ki aap aashirwad den ki meraa putr brahman kaa hi aacharan kare, bhale hi meraa pautra kshatriya jaisaa aacharan kare

 Pleased with his work, when Jamadagni urged him to ask for the groom, Parashuram asked for the blessing of everyone being revived and the memory of his slaughter being destroyed
 kathanak he ki haihay vanshadhipati karttvirarjun ne ghor tap dwaara bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kar ek sahastra bhujaayen tathaa yuddh main kisi se parrast na hone kaa var paaya tha
 Coincidentally, he ventures into the forest to Jamadagnimuni's ashram and takes Kamadhenu by force, snatching Kamdhenu, disobeying Lobashish Jamadagni, at the wonderful hospitality of the entire army, assisted by Kapila Kamadhenu, provided to him by Devraj Indra
 kupit parashuram ne farse ke prahaar se uski samast bhujaayen kaat daaleen va sir ko dhad se pruthak kar diya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons killed his meditative father Jamadagni in the absence of Parashurama as a vengeance
 renuka pati kii chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 Parshuram, angry with this scandal, attacked the city of Mahishmati with full speed and took possession of it
 iske baad unhone ek ke baad ek puure ikkis baar is prithvi se kshatriyon kaa vinaash kiya
 Not only this, he filled the five ponds of Sthalat Panchak area with the blood of Haihay Vanshi Kshatriyas and performed the father's shraddha with the blood of Sahastrajun's sons
 ant main maharishi richik ne prakat hokar parashuram ko aisa ghor krity karne se roka
 After this, he performed Ashwamedha Mahayagya and donated the earth containing Saptadweep to Maharishi Kashyapa

 Sahastrajun was a king in this society
 parashuram ne isi raja or inke putr or pautron kaa vadh kiya tha or unhen iske liye 21 baar yuddh karnaa padaa tha
 Who was Sahastrarjun ?: Sahastrarjun was a Chandravanshi king whose ancestors were Mahishmant
 mahishmant ne hi narmada ke kinare mahishmati naamak nagar basaaya tha
 Later, after Durdum, Kritavirya, the eldest of the four sons of Kanak, assumed the throne of Mahishmati
 bhargav vanshi brahman inke raaj purohit the
 Kritavirya had a good relationship with Bhargava chief Jamadagni Rishi
 kritaviry ke putr kaa naam bhi arjuna tha
 Being the son of Kritavirya, he is also called Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ne apni aradhana se bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kiya tha
 Lord Dattatreya had given Kartavirajun a boon to receive the force of a thousand hands at the time of war, due to which he came to be called Sahastrajun or Sahasrabahu
 sahatrarjun ke parakram se ravan bhi ghabaraata tha
 Reason for the war: Sahastrajun was killed due to the curse of the sage Vasishta
 sahatrarjun ne parashuram ke pita jamadagni ke ashram main ek kapila kamdhenu gaay ko dekha or use paane kii laalasaa se vah kamdhenu ko balpurvak ashram se le gaya
 When Parashurama came to know about this, he thought of bringing back Kamadhenu for the honor of his father and fought with Sahastrajun
 yuddh main sahatrarjun kii sabhi bhujaayen cat gayi or vah maaraa gaya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons retaliated and killed his father Jamadagni in Parashurama's absence
 parashuram kii maan renuka pati kii hatya se vichlit hokar unki chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 This terrible incident enraged Parashurama and he vowed - "I will die by destroying all the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya dynasty"
 uske baad unhone ahamkaari or dusht prakruti ke haihyavanshi kshatriyon se 21 baar yuddh kiya
 Burning in anger, Parashurama first captured the Mahishmati city of the Haihayavans and then killed Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ke divangat hone ke baad unke paanch putr jaidhvaj, shurasen, shur, vrish or krishna apane astitv kii ladaai ladate rahe
 In the Brahmavaivarta Purana, the story is found that Parshuram tried to force his entry into Ganesh ji when he entered the harem of Lord Shankar at Kailash
 tab ganpati ne unhen stambhit kar apni sund main lapetakar samast lokon kaa bhraman karaate hue golok main bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa darshan karake bhootal par patake diya
 On coming into consciousness, one of Ganesha's teeth broke due to the blow of the ax made by the angry Parshuramji, so that he was called Ekadanta
 unhone tretayug main ramavatar ke samay shivaji kaa dhanush bhang hone par akaash-maarg dwaara mithilapuri pahunch kar pratham to swayan ko "vishwa-vidit kshatriya kul drohi" bataate hue "bahut bhanti tinh aankh dikhaaye" or krodhandh ho "sunhu ram jehi shivadhanu tora, sahasabahu sam so ripu mora" tak kah daalaa
 Thereafter, after clearing the doubt of his power, Vaishnav handed Dhanush to Shri Ram and returned to the forest for penance, apologizing "unjustly saying too much ignorance, forgiving forgiveness"
 ramcharita maanas kii ye panktiyaan sakshi hai- "kah jai jai jai raghukulaketu, bhrigupati gayi vanhin tap hetu"
 According to the story narrated in Valmiki Ramayana, Dasharathanandan Sriram worshiped Jamadagni Kumar Parashurama and Parashurama revolved around Ramachandra and proceeded towards the ashram

 There was a fierce battle between them for 23 days
 kintu apane pita dwaara ichha mrityu ke vardaan swarup parashuram unhen haraa na sake
 Parashurama was donating his lifetime's earnings to the Brahmins, when Dronacharya reached him
 kintu durbhagyavash ve tab tak sab kuch daan kar chuke the
 Parshuram then kindly asked Dronacharya to choose any weapon
 tab chatur dronacharya ne kaha ki main aapke sabhi astr shastr unke mantron sahit chahta hoon taaki jab bhi unki aavashyaktaa ho, prayog kiya ja sake
 Parashuramaji said- "evamastu!" That is to be so
 isse dronacharya shastr vidya main nipun ho gayi
 Parashurama was also a guru of Karna
 unhone karn ko bhi vibhinn prakaar ki astr shiksha di thi or brahmastra chalaanaa bhi sikhaaya tha
 But Karna was the son of a sutra, yet knowing that Parashurama only donated his discipline to Brahmins, Karna tricked and tried to take the genre from Parashurama
 parashuram ne use brahman samaj kar bahut si vidyaayen sikhaayin, lekin ek din jab parashuram ek vriksh ke neeche karn kii godi main sar rakhke so rahe the, tab ek bhunra aakar karn ke pair par kaatane laga, apane guruji kii neend main koi avrodh na aaye isaliye karn bhunre ko sehta rahaa, bhunra karn ke pair ko buree tarah kaate ja rahaa tha, bhore ke kaatane ke kaaran karn kaa khun bahane laga
 He reached the feet of the bleeding Parshuram
 parashuram kii neend khul gayi or ve is khun ko turant pahchaan gayi ki yah khun to kisi kshatriya kaa hi ho saktaa he jo itani der tak bagaiyr uf kiye bahata rahaa
 Due to this incident Karna could not get the benefit of his weapon
 ek anya katha ke anusaar ek baar guru parashuram karn kii ek jangha par sir rakhkar so rahe the
 Just then a scorpion came from somewhere and started making wounds on Karna's thigh
 kintu guru kaa vishram bhang naa ho, isaliye karn bichchhu ke dansh ko sahataa rahaa
 Suddenly Parashuram's sleep broke and knowing that a Brahmin son could not have enough tolerance to bear the scorpion bites
 karn ke mithyabhaashan par unhone use ye shraap de diya ki jab use apni vidya kii sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi, tab vah uske kaam nahin aayegi
 Vishwavandya Mahabahu Parashurama was born on Vaishakh Shukla Tritiya from the womb of Renuka, as a boon to Devraj Indra, pleased with the soneshti yagya performed by Bhrigushrestha Maharishi Jamadagni

 us shishy ne daraa dhamka kar gangesh ko vahaan se aag laane bheja
 When they reached the fire crying in fear, what do they see if a person is doing a prostitution? pehle to ve kinkartavyavimudh ho gaye, baad main us vyakti ke pairon par gir pade
 When the person asked him the reason for coming and he knew about his life, he took them with him
 kehete hai, us shavsadhaka kii krupa se ve kuch hi dinon main pandit banakar nanihaal pahunche
 Here people understood that the boy had gone to take fire, while the ghosts have eaten him

 Seeing him suddenly appear like this, everyone was amazed and uncle called him as Go
 iske uttar main unhone tatkaal kaha

 He has composed this book in the interpretation of only one sutra of Gautama 'prakritikopaman Shabda: Certification'
 yah nyaay granth chaar khandon main vibhajit he - pratyakshkhand, anumaankhand, upmankhand or shabdakhand
 In this, he gave birth to a new independent writing style by using terms such as subjunctive, subjunctive, denotative, competitive, etc
 which have been followed by many later philosophers

 Variable frequency drive is a type of variable speed drive that is used in abundance nowadays to change the speed of AC machines
 chaal badalane ke liye yah drive, motor ko di jane vaali vidyut-shakti kaa voltata or aavriti dono ko saath-saath badalata he 
 Often the ratio of voltage and frequency is kept constant
 
 Many motors that are driven by a fixed frequency supply cost less energy if they are driven by a variable frequency drive
 udhaaharan ke liye parivarti-balaghurna vaale centripital pankhons evam pampon main VFD se supplai dene se urja kii vishesh bachat hoti he
 This is because the force and power of these loads are proportional to the square of the speed and the cube of the speed, respectively
 iskaa matlab yah he ki thodi si chaal ghataane se balaghurna main bahut kam kami aati he jabaki shakti main bahut adhik kami aa jaati he
 For example a motor at 63% speed consumes only 25% power
 vishesh baat yah he ki vishwa kii kul urja khapat kaa 60-65% bijli kii khapat motaron main hoti he jiskaa 75% parivarti-balaghurna vaale pankhe, pump, compressure aadi hai
 So if they are not supplied from fixed frequency and supplied with variable frequency drive, then a huge amount of energy will be saved
 asi drivs kaa upyog udyogon main anekon prakramon ko niyantrit karne ke liye hota he
 Good control yields good quality products
 atah kah sakate hai ki parivarti aavriti drive se prakamon ko behatar niyantrit karke behatar utpaada banane yaa kam laagat main utpaada banane main madad milti he
 Fixed-speed motors often generate a lot of turbulence when starting the motor and a large current flows in the motor
 ye dhara phul-lod dhara ke 8 guna tak ho sakate hai
 The use of AC drives gets rid of these problems, which increases the lifespan of the motor
 iske alaava parivarti aavriti drive se vah kaam bhi kiya ja saktaa he jo niyat aavriti supplai se sambhav hi nahin he
 For example, if a motor is to be driven in a particular pattern, it is only possible with VFD

 The biggest feature of Indigo is its ramp service

 This was a major reason for the 1905 Russian Revolution

 On the other hand, the weakness of China was demonstrated, which motivated the western countries towards the plunder of China

 This gluttony of Russia gave Japan great apprehension

 The russia-japan war was the result of this challenge

 He did not want Russia to control the region
 japan swayan manchuriya par apana adhikaar kaayam karnaa chahta tha
 This was a very suitable place for the expansion of the Japanese Empire
 china-japan yuddh ke baad japan ke liyaotung pradesh par apana jo adhikaar kaayam kiya tha, uske peeche yahi swaarth chipa hua tha
 However, due to opposition from Russia, Japan had to take suzerainty over the region by accepting amendments to the Treaty of Shimonoseki

 a special type of Sanskrit shlokas is called "karika"

 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 isamen ishwarkrishna ne kaha he ki isaki shiksha kapil se asuri ko, asuri se panchashika ko or panchashika se unako praapt hui
 In this, he has also mentioned the work of Sankhya philosophy called 'shashitantra' sankhyakarika main 72 shloke hai jo aryaa chand main likhe hai
 It is estimated that the last 3 verses are added later
 sankhyakarika par vibhinn vidwaanon dwaara anek tikaayen kii gayin jinamein yuktideepika, gaudpadbhashyam, jaimangla, tatvakoumudi, narayanakrut sankhyachandrika aadi pramukh hai
 The oldest commentary on the Samkhikarika is composed by Gaudapada
 doosraa mahatvapurn bhashya vachaspati mishra dwaar rachit sankhyatatvakoumudi he
 Sankhyakarika was translated into Chinese in 6th century
 san 1832 main chrishchiyan lasen ne iskaa latin main anuwaad kiya
 HT Colebrook first converted it into English
 sankhyakarika kaa aarmabhik shloke is prakaar he- Sankhyakarika, a very important episode of Sankhyadarshan is a book which has gained immense popularity
 aaj sankhyadarshan ke jo granth praapt hote hai, unamem vyakhya-granth hi adhik hai
 Only three original texts are received - Sankhyakarika, Tattvasamas and Sankhyakramasutras
 aaj praapt hone vaale sankhyadarshan ke anya granth in teen mul granthon kii hi tikaa yaa vyakhya ke rup main hai
 Most of these interpretations are in the form of interpretations of 'samkhikarika' and also interpretations of these interpretations
 is prakaar ishwarkrishna kii ‘sankhyakarika’ sankhyadarshan kaa pramukh pratinidhi granth he
 Not only the Sankar Adi Acharyas, but up to the fourteenth century AD, the Acharyas have quoted 'samthakamasika' rather than 'tattvasamas' or 'sankhyakramasutras' in their texts
 saath hi pandrahavin shatabdi main hone vaale aniruddh se purv kisi ne in sutara-granthon kii vyakhya bhi nahin kii, jabaki vibhinn vidwaanon ke dwaara bahut pehle se hi ‘sankhyakarika’ kii vyakhyaayein prastut kii ja rahi hai
 Therefore, it is clear that out of the three original texts of Sankhyadarshana available today - Sankhyakarika, Tattvasamas and sankhya-pravachanasutra - 'sankhyakarika' is the oldest
 chunki shankar aadi aacharyon ke dwaara ise uddhrut kiya jaataa rahaa he, atah yah bhi spasht he ki yah sankhyadarshan kii ek pramanik kriti maani jaati rahi he
 Numerologist Ishvarakrishna has also announced that Paramuri Kapil, the first teacher of Sankhya, gave the knowledge to his disciple Asuri, which Asuri gave to his disciple Panchashikha, Panchashikha expanded it and then after that from the disciple-tradition-same elaborate
 He has presented the knowledge briefly in seventy karyakarikas of the numerology
 is ghoshnaa se sankhyakarika kii rup main pramanikta spasht hoti he ki isamen sankhya ke paramparaagat gyaan ko prastut kiya gaya he
 Needless to say that according to this knowledge and authenticity, this book has received the highest honor in the philosophical field
 sankhyakarika ko isaki rachana ke baad se hi lokapriyata evam pramanikta praapt hui ki praayah tabhi se isaki vyakhyaaon yaa tikaaon kii parampara chal padi
 Its primeval instinct is the Mathar Vritti
 is vritti ke rachayita acharya mathar samrat kanishka ke kaal main vartmaan maane jate hai
 Thus this instinct is considered to be the creation of the first century AD
 kalkram se matharavritti ke baad sankhyakarika kii duusari pramukh vyakhya gaudpadbhaashya maani jaati he
 The majority of scholars are in favor of considering its author Gaudapada as different from the author of Mandukyakarika and Acharya Gaudapada of Advaita Vedanta
 sankhyakarika ke vyakhyaakaar gaudpad kaa samay praayah isa kii shashth shatabdi mana jaataa he
 Some scholars believe the seventh century of Christ
 matharavritti or gaudpad-bhashya main bahut se anshon main samya ke darshan hote hai
 Gaudapadbhashya is serious despite being brief
 sankhyakarika kii ‘yuktideepika’ tikaa bhi pracheen tikaaon main se ek he
 The name of its author is unknown
 isamen pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vibhinn siddhanton kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 As a result, adequate information about the numerical principles is obtained from this commentary
 chunki isamen vasubandhu evam dinnag aadi buddha aacharyon ke maton kaa ullekh he or saath hi mimasakon main shabaraswami kaa nirdesh hote hue kumaril yaa prabhakar kaa nirdesh nahin he, atah prathit hota he ki yah ukt buddha aacharyon se baad kii or kumaril se purv kii rachana he
 The time of Kumarila is considered to be the end of the seventh century and the first half of the seventh century, so it is very likely that the yukya-deepika is composed in the first half of the seventh century
 shankaracharya dwaara virachit ‘jaimangla’ tikaa bhi sankhyakarika kii prasiddh tikaa he
 Scholars are of the opinion that this commentary is a pre-creation of Vachaspati Mishra, as it appears to have been directed or followed at some places in the 'sankhyatattvakomudi'
 acharya vachaspati mishra kii ‘sankhyatatvakoumudi’ tikaa sankhyakarika kii sarvaadhik prasiddh tikaa he
 It has gained considerable fame and popularity in the philosophical world
 is tikaa main sankhyakarika ke pratipaadya vishay ko purnatah udghaatit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he

 These sutras are also made of microorganisms
 prayek sutara par ek aavaran rahata he, jiske bheetar kai cendrak hote hai
 Each sutra has a mantle inside it, which has many nuclei and is filled with cytoplasm, within which there are many nuclei and the cytoplasm is filled
 kankan kii deergh peshiyon main 5 inch tak lambey or 0

 On either side of the m line, some part of the strip appears lighter called the h region
 anaichhik peshisutra chote hote hai
 Each sutra is a perpendicular cell, which is flattened at one end and long at the other, where it attaches to the tendon
 isaki lambaai kii ore rekhaayen bhi dikhaai padati hai

 In the voluntary muscle, the actin located on the i band comes over the myosin present in its sarcomier and one end of the actin comes on the other end
 is kaaran sarcomear kii lambaai main kami ho jaati he
 Muscle contraction occurs in this state
 jab actine tathaa myosin apane sthanon par sarak jate hai to sarcomear purv avasthaa main aa jate hai tathaa peshiyaan shithil ho jate hai
 Energy for muscle contraction comes from ATP
 peshi sankuchan main Ca++ aayan ATP ko ADP main badal dete hai
