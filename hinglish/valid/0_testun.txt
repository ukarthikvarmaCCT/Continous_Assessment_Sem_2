 Originally democracies are made up of a mixture of different principles, but voting is considered to be a characteristic feature of most forms of democracy
 loktantr kii paribhaasha ke anusaar yah "janata dwaara, janata ke liye, janata kaa shashan he"
 But the concept has become somewhat complicated due to the use of different perceptions in different countries and circumstances
 prachinkaal se hi loktantr ke sandarbh main kai prastaav rakhe gayi hai, par inamen se kai kabhi kriyanvit nahin hue
 In representative democracy, the public directly elects government officials
 pratinidhi kisi jile yaa sansadeey kshetra se chune jate hai yaa kai samaanupatik vyavasthaaon main sabhi matadaataaon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Mixed systems are used in some countries
 yadhyapi is tarah ke loktantr main pratinidhi janata dwaara nirvaachit hote hai, lekin janata ke hit main kaary karne kii nitiyaan pratinidhi swayan tay karte hai
 Although some factors such as party policies, image in the electorate, re-election affect the delegates, generally only a few of these are binding instructions

 It is difficult to give a completely correct and acceptable definition of democracy
 cranston ne thik hi kaha he ki loktantr ke sambandh main alag-alag dharanaen he
 According to Lancet's definition, "democracy is a political system that provides regular constitutional opportunities for office bearers to change and provides for a mechanism under which a large part of the population receives political charge
" Selecting from the interested contestants influences the decision making
 ” macmmersan ne loktantr ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘ek maatr aisa rachanaatantr mana he jisamen sarkaron ko chaynit or praadhikrut kiya jaataa he athwa kisi anya rup main kanoon banaae or nirnay liye jate hai
 According to Schupter, "democratic law is such an institutional system for political decision-making that serves the common interest by selecting the people who are ready to implement the common will of the people
" vastav main, loktantr multah naagarik or raajnneetik swatantraaa ke liye sahabhaagi raajnneeti se sambhddha pranali he
 The following are the main principles regarding the concept of democracy: loktantr kii udaaravaadi parampara main swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar, dharm nirpekshata or nyaay jaisi avadharanaon kaa pramukh sthaan rahaa he or udaaravaadi chintak aarambh se hi in avadharanaon ko moort rup dene vaali sarvottam pranali ke rup main loktantr kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Democracy was accepted as a natural political system from the point of view of governing the society after liberation from the natives and feudal lords
 macmmersan kaa kahana he ki paashchaatya jagat main loktantr ke aagaman ke pehle hi chayan kii raajnneeti, pratiyogi rajya vyavastha or market kii rajyavyavastha jaisi avadharanaen viksit ho chuki thim
 In fact in this sense, the liberal state was democratized and not liberalized
 loktantric bhaavana ke aanrabhik chihn thomasmoor or vinstenley jaise angrej vichaarkon or angrej ativishuddhtavaad ke sahitya main paaya ja saktaa he, kintu loktantric bhaavana kii sahi shuruyaat saamaajik sanvida ke siddhanth ke janm ke saath hui, kyonki nagarikon ke saamaajik anubandh kii anternihit bhaavana hi sabhi vyaktiyon kii samanta he
 Thomas Hobbes, in his book 'leviathan' advocating the dominant democratic principle, wrote that government is formed by the people under a social contract
 jon lock kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar janata ke dwaara or usee ke hit ke liye honi chahie
 Adam Smith presented the paradigm of the free market on the democratic basis that every person has the freedom to produce, buy and sell
 prasiddh upyogetavaadi darshanik mil or bentham ne puri tarah loktantr kaa samarthan kiya or upyogetavaad ke madhyam se ise prabhavi bauddhik aadhaar pradaan kiya
 According to him, democracy provides maximum protection to utilitarianism ie maximum happiness of the people, as people expect protection from their rulers and from each other and the best ways to ensure this protection are representative democracy, constitutional government, regular Elections, secret voting, competitive party politics and majority rule
 je
 es
 mil ne bentham dwaara loktantr ke paksh main prastut tark main ek or bindu jodate hue kaha ki loktantr kisi bhi anya shashan-pranali kii tulana main maanavjaati ke naitik vikaas main sarvaadhik yogadan karata he
 In his view, democracy is the supreme medium for moral upliftment and development and expansion of individual capabilities
 is sambandh main yah ullekhya he ki bentham or mil donon main koi bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar athwa ek vyakti ek mat ke pakshdhar nahin the
 By 1802, Bentham advocated limited suffrage and in 1809 gave the slogan of limited suffrage only to the homeowners of the affluent classes and eventually called for universal suffrage in 1817, but limited this right to men
 isi prakaar mil bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar ke paksh main nahi tha, kyonki use ashanka thi ki ek varg ke log bahusankhyak hone kii sthiti apana prabhutv kaayam kar sakate he or anya virgon ke hit ke viruddh sirf apane hit ke niyam-kanoon bana sakate hai
 Later in his book 'representative Government' he advocated more than one vote for some but not the non-tax payers, illiterates, insolvents, non-tax payers, ie all those who jointly belong to the working class
 Build, deprived of it
 vah sirf ek aisi pratinidhimulak sarkaar kaa himachati tha jo aadharbhoot samaantaaon main dakhsandaji nahi karti or mukt bazaar or hastkshep kii niti apana kar chalati he
 Later liberal thinkers continued to support democracy and Western Europe and North America worked to further its acceptance
 loktantrke sambandh main puraatan udaaravaadi mat ko samay-samay par anek vichaarkon dwaara chunautiyaan milti rahi hai
 First, questions have been raised on the notion of democracy that everyone knows what is best for them
 lord brice, graham vals ityadi vichaarak maanate hai ki manushya utana vivekshil, tatasth, jaankaar athwa sakriy nahin he jitna ki prajatantr ke sanchaalan ke liye use maan liya jaataa he
 Secondly, democracy rests on the cornerstone of public governance, but it is not easy to clearly state what exactly is the meaning of 'governance' and 'public'
 isliye sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main lokmat ek myth he
 Thirdly, democracy is expected to work for the common good, but there can be no such thing as general interest
 kisi bhi samaaj main saamaanya hit vibhinn logon ke liye vibhinn arth rakh saktaa he
 Fourthly, the archaic liberal theory ignores factors such as group psychology, mass oppression and accreditation and genocidal leadership
 panchmatah, loktantr main daleey pranali praayah abhijatya varg kaa khel ban jaati he athwa unke dwaara niyantrit hoti he jo saadhan sampann he or ve hi mahatvapurn muddon par nirnay lete hai
 Again, the policy-making process is also quite complex
 udaarvaadiyon ne anaavashyak rup se ise saral, paardarshee or nyaaysangat maan liya he
 And the biggest error in this theory is that it is based on political equality but economic inequality
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetik vichaarkon ne prashn uthaanaa shuru kiya ki kya jansadharan pratidin ke jivan main raajnneeti main koi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai? kya saamaanya nagarik, jo apane jivicoparjan main lage rahete hai, raajnneetik bhoomika nibhaane ke liye samay or shakti laga sakate hai? kya jansamooh bina kisi pratibandh ke chunavi loktantr ke madhyam se apni bhaawanaaon kaa khulaa pradarshan karata he to swatantraaa nasht ho jaaegi? in prashnon ke uttar main hi loktantr ke abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi siddhanth viksit hue hai
 The term eligibility is used for a minority of a group who have special status in the community due to certain factors
 yah alpsankhyak varg samaaj main satta ke vitaran main agrani bhoomika main hota he
 The political class, according to Presthas, consumes far more power in community affairs in proportion to its numbers
 prajatantr ke sabandh main abhijan siddhanth kaa abhyuday dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad hua is siddhanth ke pravarttakon main wilfredo parato, gretanomoska, robert michels or america lekhak james bernhaam tathaa si
 rhite mills pramukh hai
 The main basis of this theory is the belief that there are two types of people in the society - a few specific legs and a large population
 vishisht log hameshaa shikhar tak pahonchte hai kyonki ve sari arhataaon se sampann sarvottam log hote hai
 The elite class, especially the political elite, perform all political acts, monopolize power and enjoy all the benefits associated with power
 bahusankhyak samooh abhijan varg dwaara manamaane dhang se niyantrit or nirdeshit hota he
 The organized minority always governs and directs the unorganized population
 robert michels ne ‘alpatantr ke louh kanoon‘ jaisi ukti kaa prayog karte hue kaha he ki saamaanya virgon ko abhijan varg kii adheenta sweekaar kerani hi chahie kyonki jansankhya kaa ek vishaal bhaag udasin karmanya or swa-shashan main aksham hota he
 The main features of the eligibility principle of democracy are: loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kaa suvyavasthit pratipaadan sarvapratham joseph shumptor ne apni pustak ‘capitalism, socialism and demokrasi‘ main kiya
 Later Sartori, Robert Dal, Ixtaine, Raymond Aron, Carl Mann Hiemond, Sidney Verba, etc
 supported this view in their works
 loktantr kii yah avadharana is manyata par aadhaarit he ki jansankhya kaa vishaal bhaag aksham or tatasth hota he or vah yogyata or kshamta ke aadhaar par kuch logon kaa chunaav karata he jo raajnneetik dal kaa niyantrit or sanchalit karte hai
 Majority of the people are busy in earning a living
 unhen raajnneetik maamalon main na to abhiruchi hoti he, na samaj
 So they select a few people from the elite and become their followers
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 yah siddhanth logo kii atisahabhaagita ko bhi khatarnaak maanata he, kyonki taanaashaahee pravriti kaa hitler jaisaa koi taqatvar netaa satta praapt karne ke liye jansamooh ko lamaband kar loktantr ko hi khatm kar de saktaa he jiskaa sidhaa arth he moulik swatantraaaon kaa ant
 Therefore, he claims that in order to preserve democratic and liberal values, it is necessary to keep the masses separate from politics
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aam janata ke dwaara vaastavik shashan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Governance is always for the people, never by the people, because the people whom the people choose to represent belong to the elite
 duusare shabdon main loktantr kaa arth he abhijan vargon ke bich pratidwandvita or janata dwaara yah nirnay ki kaunsa abhijan upar shashan karegaa
 Thus, democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the leaders of the elite classes - political parties, leaders, big business houses, voluntary organizations And even a consensus among labor organizations is necessary so that the basic functioning of democracy is non-responsible
 Can be saved and leaders
 isse yah spasht hota he ki bahya taur par to abhijan varg siddhanth loktantr ke vichaar ko adhik vyavahaaravaadi or anubhavik banane kaa daawa karti he, lekin antat yah loktantr ko ek aise roodhiwaadee raajnneetik siddhanth main badal detaa he jo udaaravaadi athwa nav-udaaravaadi yathasthitwaad se santusht ho jaataa he or iske sthayitv ko banaae rakhana chahta he
 Eliteracy has been criticized by many thinkers, including C
B
 mcpherson, Graeme Duncan, Barry Holden, Robert Dal etc
 are prominent
 is siddhanth ke viruddh mukhya aapattiyaan nimnlikhit hai: The pluralistic principle of democracy also emphasizes the role of groups instead of the common people
 kuch vichaarkon ne loktantr sambandhi aise siddhanton kaa nirupan kiya he jo abhijan siddhanth or bahulwaadi siddhanth kaa mishran he
 But it is also true that the pluralistic theory has its origins as a partial reaction to the elitist theory
 abhijan siddhanth ek aisi sthiti ke nirmaan se santusht he jisamen satta aise abhijanvarg main nihit hoti he jo mahatvapurn nirnay letaa he, lekin bahulwaadi ek aisi pranali par jor detaa he jo udaaravaadi loktantr main abhijanwaad kii pravriti ko nishprabhavi kar degaa or sahi janaakanksha ko prakat karegaa
 The concept of pluralism is old, but it became an important part of modern liberal thinking in the twentieth century
 saamaanya arth main bahulwaad satta ko samaaj main ek chote se samooh tak simit karne ke badale use prasaarit or vikendrikrut kar detaa he
 In modern industrial and technological times, according to pluralists, power has fragmented and the participation of competing public and private groups has increased
 ucch sthanon par asin logon ke paas purv kii bhaanti satta nahin rah gai he, kyonki ve mukhya rup se paraspar virdohi swaarthon ke bich madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaane lage
 Different groups mediate through their leadership and through this the individual is also represented
 yadhyapi audyogic or praudyogic ekikaran or praudyogic abhiyaachanaon ke kaaran satta kuch hi vyaktiyon main kendrit ho gai he lekin alpsankhyak kintu vrihattar, hit-samoohon ke bich pratiyogita saarvajanik hit ke paksh main jaati he
 Competition between the big business houses, labor and government has kept each group abusing its power
 is prakaar, nagarikon ke bich sampatti, shiksha or satta main asamanta ko nimna prabhavit kar diya jaataa he kyonki sanghathan or samooh aashaa se adhik pratinidhitiv pradaan karte he or isse loktantr adhik vaastavik banataa he or is arth main adhik vyavhaarya bhi siddh hota he
 Take the example of India
 yahaan mahendra singh tikait kaa kisaan sanghathan or narmada bachaao aandolan aise jan aandolan hai jo lakhon garib or ashikshit logon kii awaz ban jate hai
 And definitely make democracy more real
 yah sahi he ki abhijanvarg or unke samachar media unki aalochana karte hai or unhen pragati kaa baadhak bataate hai or yada kada sarvocch nyaayalay bhi unhen apane aandolanon ko roak dene ke liye baadhya karata he, kintu is sab ke baavjood aise janandolan bhartiya loktantr ko adhik sarthak or pratinidhimulak banaate hai
 The pluralistic concept of democracy developed mainly in America
 iske pranetaon main es
 em
 linset, robert daal, ve
 presnts, epa
 hunter aadi pramukh hai
 He argues that political power is not as simple as it appears, it is divided between the elite groups including various groups, organizations, classes and associations which usually provide leadership to society
 vibhinn swaarth samooh apni maangon ko sidhe taur par to prastut karte hi hai, vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke madhyam se bhi pesh karte hai
 a definition of pluralistic democracy is given as follows
 yah ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jisamen nitiyaan vibhinn samoohon ke bich parsparik paraamarsh or vichaaron ke aadan pradaan ke dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he kyonki koi bhi samooh yaa abhijanvarg itnaa shashakt nahi he ki vah akele sarkaar par itnaa dabaab daal sake ki vah uski sari maangon ko puraa kar sake
 The pluralists approve of this partnership of power that it benefits that no social group can dominate the policy-making process of the government so that it can ignore the interests of other classes
 lekin, bahulwaadi siddhantakaaron kii ek manyata yah bhi thi ki sabhi nagarikon ko raajnneetik kshetra main apane hiton ko sanghatit karne or unhen saadhane ke liye vaidhanik avasar or aarthik sansaadhan praapt hai
 Without this opportunity, citizens cannot support or oppose any proposed move
 bahulwaadi vichaarak raajnneeti ko vyaktiyon ke badale samoohon ke bich nishchayon kii prakriya maanate hai or ghoshnaa karte hai ki loktantr sarvottam tareeke se tabhi kaam karata he jab naagarik apane vishesh hiton ke samarthak samooh se jud jate hai
 They emphasize that there should be active participation of individuals in a society and join different groups to implement their resolve
 saath hi, saare samoohon or unke sadasyon ko yah sweekaar karnaa chahie ki chunaav raajnneetik nirnyon main vishaal samudaay kii sahabhaagita kaa ek kargar hathiyaar he
 Similarly, all groups and members of the elite class make democracy possible through mutual competition
 isse spasht he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth vastav main abhijanwaad kaa purnatah virodh nahin karata kyonki iske pravartakon ke anusaar abhijanvarg kaa astitv ek hakeekat he or ve uski avasthiti se santusht he
 This is the reason that pluralistic theories are sometimes considered to be only partially different from elite principles
 mahaan america raajnneetik vichaarak robert daal loktantr kii abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi abhidharanaon ko sanyukt karte hue apni loktantric abhidharana ko bahutantr kii sangya detaa he
 According to him, the public is active through both groups and politicians of the elite
 usne anek aise samudaayon kaa hawala diya he jo sarkaar ke niti-nirdhaaran ko prabhavit karte hai- jaise, vyapaaree gharaane or udyogpati, saudagar, shramik sanghathan, kisaan sanghathan, upabhokta, matadaata ityadi
 It is not that their entire agenda is implemented
 saare samooh samaan rup se shashakt nahin hote or anek samooh apni manonukoolnitiyon ko manwaane kii apeksha pratikulanitiyon kii rokthaam main zyada prabhavi hote hai
 Among the objections raised against the pluralist doctrine are the following: raajnneeti kriyalap main sahabhaagita loktantr kaa mul tatva he, lekin khaskar poonjivadi loktantron main yah praayah chunaavon main matdaan tak hi simit rahata he
 The participatory principle of democracy considers augmented participation as an ideal as well as a practical necessity
 is siddhanth ke pramukh prastaavkon main 1960 ke dashak se carol perlman, si
 bi
 macmmersan or en
 polant jaas jaise vampanthi vichaarak pramukh rahe hai
 Following are the two salient features of participatory democracy: sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But this consumption is also possible only when the person is independent and equal
 yadi logon kaa vishwaas ho ki nitigat nirnyon main kargar sahabhaagita ke avasar vastav main vidyaman na hai to ve nishchay hi sahabhaagi banenge
 In such a situation, they will also be able to partner effectively
 jis loktantr main, chaahe vah raajnneetik ho yaa pravidhik yaa shilpatantric abhijanvarg kaa varchasv hota he vah nagarikon ke liye santoshprad nahi hota or amlog sahabhaagita ke dwaara hi us varg ke varchasv ko samaapt kar sakate hai
 Proponents of participatory theory also state that in today's industrial and technological societies, the standard of education has been elevated and the gap between elite and non-elite has reduced in a society rich in intellectual and political consciousness
 isliye kaaryakshmata or vikaas kii drushti se adhikansh maamalon main saamaanya logon kii sahabhaagita koi baadha nahin rah gai he
 Frankly speaking, the denuclearization of power is the strongest defense against tyranny
 sahabhaagita par aadhaarit loktantr hi nagarikon ko tatasthta, agyaan or algaav se bachaa saktaa he or loktantr kii buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The question is, how should the political participation of the common citizen? Its theorists have given the following ways: macmmersan kii tippanee he ki aaj ke raashtra kshetra or jansankhya kii drushti se vishalkay hai or yah sambhav nahin he ki saare naagarik rosemare ke raajnneetik vimarsh yaa niti nirdhaaran main shaamil hon, phir bhi yadi kuch sharto ko sweekaar kar liya jaae to sahabhaagita kaa anupaat nishchit rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa ha
 These conditions are: david held ne sahabhaagita siddhanth par aapatti uthaate hue kaha ki yah puraatan / abhijan bahulwaadi jaise siddhanton se behatar to he, lekin isse yah spasht nahin ho paata ki kaise or kyon sirf sahabhaagita maanviya vikaas, jo loktantr kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshya he, ke ucchtar str ko praapt kar sakegi
 There is no evidence or rational basis that participation will make citizens more cooperative and committed to the common interest
 held is kendriya manyata ko bhi aavashyak rup se satya nahin maanata ki aam log apane jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par niti nirdhaaran karne or nirnay lene main adhik uttaradaayi bananaa chaahate hai
 If they do not want to participate in the determination of socio-economic matters and policies, then it cannot be considered appropriate to force them
 phir bhi maan liya jaae ki aam log apane loktantric rujhaan ko yadi ek seemaa se aage le janaa chahen or buniyadi swatantraaa or adhikaar ke maamle main dakhlandaji karne lage to loktantr kaa kya hashr hoga, aise prashnon par sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon ne paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Cook and Morgan, the realization of participatory democracy is not as easy as it seems on the top
 udaahranarth, sahabhaagi ikai ke samyak aakaar or krity kya hon phir, nagarikon kii sakriy sahabhaagita ke bal par sthaneey staron par liye gaye nirnyon ko sampurna raashtra ke hit ke saath kis prakaar samanvit evam samekit kiya jayega? ek sthaneey sahabhaagi ikai ke nitigat maamle duusari ikai ke virdohi bhi to ho sakate hai
 Then there is one thing that decisions taken on the basis of maximum possible participation are not necessarily the most effective decisions
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthak kaaryakshmata evam prabhaav ke muddon par paryaapt dhyaan nahin dete
 Contrary to popular belief, the idea of democracy has also been accepted by Marx and later Marxist thinkers
 itnaa avashya he ki unki loktantr-sambadhi abhidharana paashchaatya udaaravaadi loktantric abhidharanaon se purnatah bhinn he
 Since the Marxists believe that the democratic right in the capitalist system is not in the true sense, but only in the hands of the resource-rich class, they want to establish a democracy that is 'public democracy'
 marxvaadi loktantr main utpaadan ke sadhano par swaamitv ko khatm karne or sarvharavarg dwaara arthvyavastha ko niyantrit karne ke pashchaat samaajawaadee loktantr kii sthapana hoti he
 Marx was a critic of liberal constitutional democracy because according to him the basis of capitalist democracy is an economic system in which the means of production are always under the control of the capitalist class
 yahi puunjipati varg apni dhan-shakti ke bal par raajnneetik vyavastha kii niyantran main rakhkar sarkaar or rajya-tantra ko apane adheen rakhata he
 State power, rights and privileges rest solely with the same class and the working class only has the freedom and rights of name
 rajya kaa adhikari varg, nyaayalay or police bal bhi tatasth na hokar prabhutasampann varg ke hi hit sadhak hote hai
 Therefore, democracy takes the form of a system of governance which is used to promote the power and privilege of the ruling class and to serve the interests of the upper class
 iske baavjood, marks or angels ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki sampann puunjipati varg dwara niyantrit udaaravaadi burjua loktantr bhi kisi had tak apane nagarikon ko vaastavik adhikaar dene ke aitihaasik daawey kar saktaa he or shramik varg iskaa istemaal apane ko sangathit kar sarvhaara kii kranti ke liye kar sakate hai
 In liberal democracies, the common franchise can be used to set the background of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat
 marxvaadi yah avashya maanate hai ki kuch sthitiyon main hinsak krantikari aandolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he lekin aisi sthitiyon kii sambhaavna atyalp he
 Even if the parliamentary route is adopted to meet the goal of socialist revolution, it can only be an additional tool in other types of conflicts
 marxvaadi vishleshan ke anusaar vaastavik loktantr sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko kaayam karne ke liye sarvharavarg kii kranti ke pashchaat hi sambhav he kyonki udaaravaadi bujuar loktantr kaa adarsh pratibhagita kaa ho saktaa he, lekin yatharth main saadhanheen shramik varg kii sahabhaagita usamen nahin ho paati
 In his work The Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx and Engels wrote in a clear explanation of their concept: 'between capitalist and communist societies lies the period of conversion of one into the other
 isi se mail khaati ek raajnneetik sankraman kii avadhi bhi hoti he jisamen rajya sarvhaara varg ke adhinayakawad or samyawad main bhed kiya he
 They consider it an intermediate period
 isaki parinti samyavaadee samaaj kii sthapana main hoti he
 It is important to understand in what sense Karl Marx and Engels used the term totalitarianism
 unki drushti main prayek rajya shaasha saamaajik varg kaa adhinayakawad rahaa he
 In the capitalist system, this class belonged to the thriving industrial and merchant bourgeoisie, while the state with its own concept would be a state controlled by the proletariat immediately after the revolution and then the process of socialist reconstruction would begin which would end in the establishment of a classless society
 isliye, unki drushti main loktantr or sarvhaara adhinayakawad ek hi saath chalenge, thik vaise hi jaise ki poonjivadi vyavastha main udaaravaadi loktantr vyavharytah loktantr bhi or udyogpatiyon evam vyapaarik gharaanon ke burjua varg kaa adhinayakawadi shaasha bhi
 Therefore, Marx and Engels said that the system after the revolution and the hegemony of the working class would be the system of 'people's democracy'
 janata se unka taatpary muththibhar sampann burjua ke sthaan par jansamanya kii vishaal aabaadi se tha
 The following are the salient features of 'people's democracy' as propounded by Marx: samaajawaadee samaajon kii rachana ne marxvaadi vichaaron ko or aage badhaayaa, lenin jisane rus main 1917 main pratham samaajawaadee rajya kii sthapana kii ne marxvaadi chintan kii nai vyakhyaayein prastut kii
 He accepted the totalitarianism of the proletariat and emphasized its importance of socialist revolution, but he also added with it that the totalitarianism of the proletariat can be exercised only by a large proletarian organization or communist party
 usne loktantr kii teen avasthaaen bataaiah poonjivadi loktantr, samaajawaadee loktantr or samyavaadee loktantr
 According to him, democracy is a form of state and in a class-divided society, the government is both totalitarian and democratic
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power
 lenin sweekaar karata he ki nav sthapit samaajawaadee rajya utana hi damanaatmak hota he jitna ki poonjivadi rajya
 It is also necessary to implement the rule of the proletariat
 chunki burjua kaaphi shaktishaalee hota he, isliye samaajawaadee loktantr ke aarambhik daur main sarvhaara varg ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he ki vah balpurvak poonjivadi varg kaa unmoolan kar de
 The dictatorship of the proletariat has two goals: lenin ke anusaar yah kaary mukhya rup se samyavaadee dal ko karnaa padataa he
 Thus, in Lenin's view, capitalist democracy does not have true democracy, whereas proletarian authoritarianism has more secular democracy, as it is the rule of the majority proletariat
 uskaa yah bhi daawa tha ki antatah sachche samyawad kii prapti ke saath loktantr anaavashyak ho jayega, kyonki us samaaj ke sandarbh main iskaa koi arth nahin rah jayega
 After Marx, Engels and Lenin, many thinkers have presented many interpretations of Marxism
 inamen edward bernstin, karl kotski, rojaa lukjamvarg aadi pramukh hai
 Edward Bernstein claims that Marxist interpretation of capitalism is wrong and totalitarianism of the proletariat is neither necessary nor desirable
 uske anusaar, raajnneetik loktantr or udaaravaadi swatantraaaen adhik mahatvapurn he
 Lenin does not believe that authoritarianism of the proletariat is necessary
 bernstin kaa tark he ki jab tak sarvhaara varg bahumat hasil nahin kar letaa, samaajawaadee kranti asambhav he or yadi vah bahumat hasil kar letaa he to adhinayakawad kii jarurat hi nahin rahati
 According to him, democracy is necessary and socialism can be established only by combining democratic tradition with Marxist socialist theory
 marxvaadi krantikari rojaa lakjamberg ne lenin kii loktantr- virdohi niti ke sambandh main aapatti uthaate hue kaha he ki isse vishaal janasamudaay kaa adhinayakawad nahin, vishaal janasamudaay par adhinayakawad sthapit ho jaataa he
 • The majority of the population, which is the purveyor of the non-elite, is largely non-committal, lazy and indifferent, so it is necessary to have a minority that provides leadership
 • abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 • loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 • According to the proponents of participatory theory, democracy is the real meaning of equal participation of every individual, not merely to keep the government stable as the elitist or pluralist ideologues assume
 sachche loktantr kaa nirmaan tabhi ho saktaa he jab naagarik raajnneetik drushti se sakriy hon or samuhik samasyaon main nirantar abhiruchi lete rahen
 Active participation is necessary so that the major institutions of society have adequate exchange and political parties have more openness and sense of responsibility
 • sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 • Democracy is a form of state and government is both totalitarian and democratic in a class-divided society
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power

 Mold: Human papillomavirus mold: Urogenital neoplasia ardhchaalak yuktiyaan un electranik avyavon ko kehete hai jo ardhchaalak padaarthon ke gun-dharmon kaa upyog karke banaaye jate hai
 Silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide are the main semiconductor materials
 adhikansh anuprayogon main ab un sabhi sthanon par ardhchaalak yuktiyaan prayog kii jane lagi hai jahaan pehle ushmainic yuktiyaan prayog kii jaati thim
 The semiconductor devices are based on electronic movement in the solid state, while the tube tips were based on the conduction of incubations in the high vacuum or gaseous state
 nirmaan ke aadhaar par ardhchaalak yuktiyaan mukhyatah do prakaar kii hoti hai - akeli yuktiyaan or ekikrut paripath The most important attraction of semiconductor materials is that their behavior can be controlled by contaminating them
 dooshan kii is prakriya ko dopigan kehete hai
 The conduction of semiconductors can be controlled by electrical field, light, heat, even pressure
 isaliye, ardhchalkon kaa upyog samvedakon ko banane main hota he
 The current flows through "free" electrons and "holes", also called charge carriers
 silicon jaise ardhchaalak main phosphorus yaa boron jaise tatwon ko daalkar dopigan kiya jaataa he, jisase ardhchaalak main uplabdh mukt electron yaa chhidron kii maatra kaaphi had tak batch jaati he
 When there are maximum holes in a contaminated semiconductor, it is called P-type semiconductor and when there are maximum electrons, it is called N-type semiconductor, where p or n are indicative of positive charge or negative charge charge carriers
 ardhchalkon kaa utpaadan or unke dopigan kii prakruya atyant hi niyantrit vaataavaran, jise faib kehete hai, main hoti he
 The pair between P-type and N-type semiconductors is called PN pair
 P-N jod se bane diod me P-prakaar or N-prakaar ke ardhchalkon ke bich ke jod main avakshay kshetra hota he jo vidyutdhara ke pravaah ko n se p kii ore nahi hone detaa, par p se n kii ore hone detaa he
 When the diode is front facing, where there is a higher electrical operating power towards P, then the current flows
 iske vipareet, uttkram abhinath diod main dhara pravaah naa ke baraabar hota he
 By adding light to the semiconductor, the electron-hole pairs increase, which increases the conductivity
 is pratibhaas kaa phayda uthaakar photo diod banaaya gaya
 Combined semiconductor diodes can produce light, such as light-emitting diodes and laser diodes
 transistaron ke pramukh prakaar, dwidhruviya jod transister do p-n jodon, n-p-n yaa p-n-p samagrakriton main banate hai
 The middle segment, also known as the "base", is narrow
 anya khandon ko utsarjak or samahrta kehete hai
 The intrusion of charge between the base and the emitter causes a difference in the quality of the base-collector, thus, current flows even though the base-collector is in front
 base-utsarjak ke chote se pravaah ke badlaav ke anupaat se kai guna adhik pravaah base-samahrta ke bich miltaa he
 Another type of transistor is the field effect transistor - the conductivity of this semiconductor is increased and reduced by the effect of the electric field
 vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav se mukt electron or yaa chhidron kii maatra tak batch jaati he, is prakaar chaalakata batch jaati he
 If you use an inversely connected PN pair to apply this electric field, it is called a pair field effect transistor; If you use metal oxide to apply this electric field, then the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor is made aaj mosphate sabase mahatvapurn ardhchaalak yukti he
 The "gate" electrically generates the electric field, thereby controlling the conductivity of the channel between "source" and "drain"
 is channel ke do prakaar hai, P-channel yaa N-channel 
 Although the metal got its name from the phosphate, polysilicon is used today
 ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan main silicon kaa sabase adhik prayog hota he
 Its main properties as compared to other materials are low cost of raw materials, ease of manufacture and wide temperature operating range
 vartmaan main ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan ke liye pehle silicon ko kam se kam 300mm kii chaudai ke baul ke nirmaan se kiya jaataa he, taaki is se itani hi chaudi vefer ban sake
 The use of germanium was widespread at first, but silicon has taken its place due to its extreme hypersensitivity
 aaj jarmenium or silicon ke kudhatu kaa prayog akasar ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan me hota he; ai bi em ese yuktiyon kaa pramukh utpaadak he
 The use of gallium arsenide is also widespread in the manufacture of ultra-efficient devices, but this material does not form wide boules, which makes it expensive to make semiconductor devices from gallium arsenide compared to silicon
 anya padaarth jinka prayog yaa to kam vyapak he, yaa un par anusandhan ho rahaa he: Transistors are a fundamental part in the formation of logic gates

 Semiconductors are already in use since the discovery of transistors in the field of electronics
 beesvin sadi ke shruwaat ke samay ke radio main inhen "billi kii much" naamak sansuchak avyav ke rup main dekha gaya
 The conduction of these early detectors had many disadvantages - the fibers made of tungsten had to be moved around the galena or carbondum crystals until it suddenly started to work! At that time, their operating system was not known

 In 1939, he tried on even more purified crystals and found that although his ruminative attitude was over, its ability to detect also disappeared
 phir ek din achaanak unke paas padey ek ucchtam shuddhta ke crystal ne kaam karnaa shuru kar diya - dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalaa ke is crystal ke bichon bich ek choti si daraar thi
 Then he noticed that by changing the place in the room of the detector, if he starts doing this work then he should stop
 unhone pataa lagaaya ke crystal kaa yah bartaav us par pads rahe roshni par nirbhar karata he
 When he showed it to others, Walter Brattan quickly realized that some sort of joint was forming on the crack of the crystal
 bhed khulne main der nahi lagi
 The reason for the cracks in the crystals was the imbalance in corruption between the two sides of the crack, due to which some electrons were more on one side and less on the other side
 chunki dono bhaag jude hue the, electron ke adhikshmata ke taraf se duusari taraf kaa pravaah tab shuru hua jab bydaree ko lagane se bydaree ke vidyut sanchaalan shakti se adhiksham electron duusari taraf kud padey or trutipurna "chhidron" me ja baithe
 But this created an instability! The maximum side lacks an electron for smooth balance, which the battery fulfills by giving up its electron, and by absorbing additional electrons on the other side, the battery completes the entire cycle
 is tarah bijli kaa dhar pravaah sthapit ho gaya
 Changing the direction of the battery halts this flow because the "electrons" fill the electrons in the "holes", and the maximum electrons on the other side cause the electrons to not move
 do thos crystalon ke bane is diod ke is aacharan ko ardhachalan kehete hai
 The tendency of the diode to close is due to the separation of the charge carriers near the joint and the region
 It is called the depreciation zone
 ardhchalkon ke is naye gyaan ko sahejane ke liye paradu vishwavidhyalay, bel labs, em aai tii or ne milakar naye behatar crystal banaaye or takneekon ko samaapit kiya
 Within a year, germanium production has come to such a maturity that their use started in strategic radars
 yudh ke bad, wiliam shokli ne tryod jaise ardhchaalak yukti ko banane kaa prayaas kiya
 For this he obtained funding and a lab, started working with John Bardeen and Brittain
 transister ke vikaas ke liye ardhchalkon me electronon ke sachlan ko samajhnaa mahatvapurn tha
 If this movement between the emitter and the collector of the diode can be controlled somehow, then the amplifier can be developed
 yadi ek tarah ke kristal ke donon taraf vidyut prachlan shakti ko lagaayen, to electronon kaa pravaah sthapit nahi hota; agar electron yaa "chhidron" ko tisare antak se antaravahit karen to yah pravaah sthpit ho saktaa he
 The utility of large crystals as an amplifier is also low, as it has to interfere with a large amount of electrons or holes
 kul milakar, transister ke banane main kristal ke avakshay kshetra dwaara choti duriyon main electronon kaa prabandh or nivesh or nirgam ke sampark ko sataha se nikatataa par nirbhar karti he
 When Brittain started making such a device, the amplification would be seen to disappear and disappear

 The electrons of the crystal are characterized by the influence of nearby charges - electrons near the emitter's surface and holes are collected near the surface of the cascade, looking for opposite charges
 inhe bady aasaani se is sataha se hataaya ja saktaa he kristal ke kisi bhi sahi kone main thode se aaveshon ke antaravahan se
 If the emitter and the collector are close together, the flow of electrons between them leads to the flow of charges

 Shokley was unhappy that he had to share the credit for the invention of the transistor with Bardeen and Brattan
 bail labs ke vakeelon ko jab pataa chalaa ke shokli ke lekhon me kuch samaantaayen thim julius adgar lilian ke 1925 ke patent se, to unhone shokli ke naam ko transister ke patent se baahar rakhane kaa vichaar kiya
 Shokli was extremely annoyed by this and decided to show who the real mind was
