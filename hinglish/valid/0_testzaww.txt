 In its tenth mandala, the dialogue of Urvashi and Pururava is described in the 95th Sukti, which is full of utterances of virah-vedana
 raja pururava kii preyasi urvashi kisi vaat par rusht hokar use chhod kar chali jaati he
 Pururava, madly mad at him, reaches the banks of Mansarovar, looking for him
 ,jahaan urvashi apni sakhiyon ke saath aamod -pramod main vyast milti he
 o ruthless, stop! Stop! Beginning with these words, Pururava describes the condition of his disordered heart as extremely compassionate: - arthath When these words of Pururava had no effect on Urvashi, he depicted the state of Virah - a heart-rending heart, saying - “in your war i do not feel like even in war
 main ab itnaa samarth hoon ki vijay -prapti ke liye shatruon par baan bhi nahin chalaa saktaa
 Now, by snatching land, money etc
 from enemies, he is not even able to use them
 mere us singhnaad ko jise sunakar shatru kaanp jate the ,ab koi nahin sunata
 "these words of Pururava also do not fall on Ruthur, Alhad, mad-vibhor Sundari Urvashi

 Just as the sun always runs behind Usha, similarly you are always following me, but i am like Vayu, who can control me
 "ant main pururava hataash hokar kahata he: + + + + Ie aashcharya he ki premi kii mrityu ke is karun drishy kii kalpana se bhi us sundari kaa hryday nahin pasijata
 In fact, this is a beautiful example of love-communism, reprimand

 From the beginning to the end, this narrative remains unconnected with the turbulent land of sexuality, it does not even have the vision of physical fickleness, in the Kumarasambhava of Kalidas the predecessor is depicted in a beautiful form
 unka meghdoot to viyogi hriday kaa hi sandesh he
 In the message of Yaksha, instead of pranay-vedana, Sambhog - aspiration is seen, so there is a mixture of sexuality in it

 But oh wanderer! When the mind of the beloved is disturbed, how should it be returned again? hindi ke praarambhik kaviyon main mahakavi vidyapatipane saundarya -prem evam virah ke geeton ke liye bahut prasidd hai
 His poetic depiction of various sensations of antecedence and viraha is portrayed in a very poignant manner
 premaki praarambhik avasthaa main nayakaraj kii kya dasha ho gai he ,drashtavy he: That is, i saw Radha in the middle of the path
 usee kshan mere praan hi ghayal ho gaye
 Since that time, the kumud-nidhi has been established
 radha ke prem main krishna kii vihvalata kaa chithran dekhiye~~ Vidyapati has also depicted the narration of the heroine like a hero
 unki virahaniyon ko avasthaa ke anusaar do shreniyon main baant sakate hai: In the first-class dissociation, lust-supply is high and there is a lack of love-affliction
 isi prakaar ek anya yuvati ko priyatam ke pravaas kaa utana adhik dukh nahin jitna use apane yauvan ke vyarth biit jane kaa he: That is, when the sprout will be burnt by the heat of the sun, then what will be the benefit from the rain of the cloud
 yadi in navayauvan ko virah main kho diya to phir us priy ke ghar aane par kya hoga ?kintu duusari shrenee kii praudha nayikaayen aisa nahin sochatin
 In them, the agility of youth and the velocity of lust are found in the severity of love
 atah ve pati ke sthool milan kii apeksha ,unke sneh kii adhik ikshuk hai: There is not as much regret for the heroine's husband not coming here as it is about her falling apart
 aage chalakar yahi nayika apni virah -vednaa kii apeksha priy ke mangal ko adhik mahatv detii he: In fact, there is such a climax of emotion which causes the heroine's ego, selfishness and work to be completely forgotten and her love is transformed into pure love
 kabir kii aatma, paramatma ke milan ke liye utsuk ho jaati he to uski whee avasthaa ho jaati he ,jo loukik kshetra main premi kii purvanurag main hoti he yatha : This union aspiration of the soul gradually takes the form of intense pain
 vah apane hryday ke veg par sanyam rakhane main asamarth ho jaati he or apane priy ko pukaar -pukaar kar bulaane lagati he ~~ +++ kabir kii virah -vyanjana main vibhinn sanchari bhaavon kaa chithran bhi atyant swaabhaavik rup main ho gaya he
 Some examples are sightings: kabir jaisaa akkhad bhi virah -vednaa se peedit hokar dainya se ot -prot ho jaataa he
 He spreads his hand in front of the public: ve dusron kii sthiti seapani tulana karte hue kehete hai: Jayasi in his poetry has interpreted Viranusanas in such an exquisite exaggerated poetic style that it has led to the confusion of scholasticness in the scholars
 purvanurag or viyog kaa chithran jaaysi ne pure vistaar se kiya he
 He has mainly made two characters as medium for euphemisms of virahanas
 pehla ratnasen or doosraa naagmati
 Depiction of prediction of Ratnasen's predecessor: or phir iskaa vikaas : The poet has also organized various experiences and communicative expressions properly, depicting the antagonism of Ratnasen: duusari ore naagmati kii virah -vyanjana bhi kavi ne atyant maarmik shabdon main kii he
 Some lines are visible further: jaaysi ke virah -varnan kii sabase badi visheshtah yah he ki unhone nayak or nayika donon main virah kaa vikaas samuchit rup se dikhaaya he, jisase usamen prem kii gambheertha drushtigochar hoti he
 Sur has used the gharanas of Krishna and the gopis to describe the virahanas in a very succinct form
 viyog kii ashanka -maatr se prem - vivash gop -bala radha ke hryday kii kya dasha ho jaati he ,iskaa chithran dekhiye: +++ or jab vidaai kii ghadiyaan upasthit hotin hai ,to premika kaa hryday sau -sau dhaaraon main bah nikalataa he: When the beloved departs, the mercy of anger, remorse and despair in the heart of Viogini Bala is left residual
 prem - divaani mira ne apane hryday ke udgaaron ko marmasparshi shabdon main vyakt kiya he apane " giradhar gopal "ke virah main bhavabhibhoot hokar unhone shat -shat geeton kii rachana kii he
 Some lines of sight: + + + +++ + + + In these lines of Meera there is such a seriousness of viraha-vedna, which is capable of stirring the heart of the reader
 loukik prem kii vaasana ke abhaav main unka vednaa swarup or bhi adhik divya or pavitra ho gaya he
 Poet Mahadevi is the only idol of pain
 unke kavy kii prayek pankti virahanubhootiyon se udwelit he
 He has also explained how Virah's sweet pain was communicated in his life
 kintu ant main unhone apni vednaa par aisi vijay praapt kar lee he ki ab unhen virah main milan kii, na dukh main sukh kii anubhuti hone lagi he ~~ Frederick Max Müller was a Germanic who was an employee of the British East India Company

 yah khaas taur se arabi aksharon ko likhane main upyogit he, jo ki islamic samskruti kaa ang mana jaataa he
 And this lettering is derived from Persian lettering
 arabi bhashaa main 'khat' ke arth 'lakeer' yaa phir 'tamir' ke hai
 This Islamic alphabet was developed by well-versed people in writing the Quran, which became part of the Islamic culture
 yah aksharankan kalakritiyon ke rup main kai imaaraton par jaise, qila, masjid, madrasa, dargaah, qabrastaan vagaira par dekhe jaasakte hai
 This art is called "khatati" in Urdu

 Before paper was made, this art was displayed on skins, on canvas, on clothes
 kagaz banane ke baad is kala main kranti ai
 When there were dozens of books in the Monasteries of Europe Church, hundreds of thousands of books were found in the Muslim world
 :218 Coins were also used for this art

 In this Kufic style, there are 17 letters which do not have eras

 Later Arabic letters turned 29

 This style became known as Kufi or Kufic style due to the name of this city
 yah style aage chal kar kai rup main likhi jane lagi jaise, pushpiya, naqushi, chotidaar, border rup, or chatursreey rup kii style ityadi
 These styles were used in writing copies of the "quran" during the 8th to 10th centuries
 baad main 11veen shatabdi main saadhaaran lipi kii tarah bhi upyogit rahi
 This style began to be used for decorating as well
 kufi style ke upyog keliye koi khaas sutara nahin hai; ek hi sutara yaa tareeqa he ki iske aksharon ko koniya rup main likh jaye
 There was no specific way or formula to write this, because this style started being used in other ways in other countries

 The style used in Europe for the decoration of inscriptions is an imitation of the Kufi used in the Middle Ages and the cultural revival
 pataa nahin chalaa ki is style ke upyog ke kaaran kya hai
 It also appears that this style used by Westerners in the 13th and 14th centuries was of Christu's life, an illusion
 ghaseet kar likhi jane vaali lipi bhi is kufi style ke saath upyog main thi
 But there were no static formulas in this style in the initial stage, so it was used as an informal purpose

 Tantralok is a Tantric text composed by Abhinavagupta
 tantralok kii rachana hetu nimittbhoot shishy, sahyogi or paariwarik vaataavaran do kaarnon ne abhinavgupt ko tantralok likhane hetu sarvaadhik prerit kiya ve apane shishyon or sahpaathiyon jano dwaara atyant drudh or shraddhapurna nivedan tathaa apane guru ‘somashmbhu’ athwa shanmbhunath kii ajna vashwarshi hokar ek purna shastraroop tantralok ke lekhan hetu baghya ho gaye
 In the Abhinav Tantraloka epilogue, Tantraloka's creation is instrumental in mentioning his principal disciples
 inamen unke bhai manorath kaa sthaan sarvapratham aata he
 When Manorath Abhinav's Akhil Shastra Vimarsha became the only officer of full potential, at the same time, his other cousins also pleaded with Abhinav in a similar prayer
 inamen se souri ke putrmandra, kshem, utpal abhinav, chakrak, padyagupt or ramgupta kaa namollekh purvak vaarnit he
 Some others pleaded with Abhinav, whom Abhinav, a kind-hearted Acharya, could not deny, but his name is nowhere to be described
 paratrinshik vivaran ke upsanhaar shlokon me manorath, karn or utpal kaa naam liya gaya he
 Abhinav's brother Manorath was full of omniscience and Shiva's devotion
 karn yathaapi yuva the tathaapi ve sansaarik aakarshanon se dur hokar shaiva anushaasan main gambheer pravesh paa chuke the
 Karna along with Mandra had requested Abhinav to write a commentary on the 'malinivijayottara' system
 karn ke sansaarik vritti se sarvatha dur or apane naam ke anuroop gun vaale yogeshwaridatt naam ek putr bhi tha
 Karna's young wife, Amba, who was also Abhinav's sister, had entered into intense devotion to Shivpadapa, free from all locales after her husband died in her infancy
 yadhyapi ve abhinav se jyeshtha thi tathaapi ve abhinav ko guru maanati thi na ki unhen bandhu buddhi se dekhati thi
 Next we get a description of Ramgupta, who is called Ramdev in the innovative 'paratrinshika Description'
 paratrinshika vivaran ke anusaar ramdev vyakaran, mimasaa or tarkshastra ke nishnaat vidwaan the
 Abhinav's five cousins, who are described by Abhinav in the epilogue Shloken, entered the full devotion of Shiva, canceling all the deviations
 ham yah spasht rup main yah siddh nahi kar pate he ki anek prasiddh granthon or tikaaon ke lekhak‘kshebharaj’ unke chachare bhai kshem he athwa koi anya he parantu kuch paristhitj sakshya is tathy kii pushti karte he
 Abhinavagupta addresses all of them as 'pitruvya Tanayaah'
 abhinav tantralek me kahi bhi yah spasht nahi karte hai ki unke chachaa cone the
 Dr
 KC Pandey describes Vamnagupta as Abhinav's uncle on the basis of Abhinav Bharati
 jab ham abhinav ke guruon kii charchaa karege tab is vishay par punah prakaash padegaa
 Now we come to the temple, he will be a friend and cousin of Karna's childhood
 vatsalika jo kisori kii patni thi abhinav unhe bhandra kii chachee kehete hai tathaa jo ki kripapurna vyaktitva se yukt thi
 Abhinav was enamored with his gracious personality
 abhinav ne inhi kii kripapurna dekharekh, unke ek kaswe main sthit awaas apane saahitiyik srijan hetu upyukt sthal maan
 The concerted prayer of all these people forced Abhinav to create Tantraloka, as he could not reject that prayer in the same way that a dancer who is desirous of dancing cannot control himself during the playing of an instrument
 tantralok kaa sangrah sthal tantralok ek kaswein main sthit mandra ke awaas main likhaa gaya jahaan unki chachee vatsalika dwaara apane naam ko satyasiddh kartan hue unke prati apane sthh apane utyucch stareey granth ke lekhan main safal hue
 Acharya Abhinav's poet heart, every word of his poetry, filled with the repulsion of Batsalika, pours over Vatsalika
 vatsalika souri kii patni kii patni thi jo ki rajmantri the tathaa jo baad main shiv ke prati bhakthi se paripurna hokar apane baad se tyaagptr de diya
 Although Abhinavagupta gives sufficient details regarding his biography and circumstances, he does not give any direct indication regarding his time
 abhinav kaa sthitikaal abhrant rup se spasht nishchit he
 In this subject, we get some hints by Abhinav
 Sauri was the eldest and contemporary of Abhinav as his three generations in the later times appear to be Sauri Karna and Yogeshwari Dutt
 karn nishchit rup se abhinav ke samakaleen the
 Abhinav's sister was Amba's husband
 abhinav, karn kii mrityu pratyakshdarshi the
 Karna was a very curious disciple of Abhinav, along with Abhinav's relationship with Navat
 karn apeksha krit alpaayu main hi divangat ho gaye the jab unke putr yogeshwari dutt bade ho chuke the
 In 'paratrinshika Partika', he was the son of the narrated facts who were senior or prime minister in the meeting of Emperor Yashkar
 yashaskar kaa nishchit rup se gyaat he ki unka shasankaal 939 i0 main tha
 Abhinavagupta Samrat was writing the writing of Tantralok during the third generation of Yashaskar
 us samay ve sarvatha paripakv avasthaa main the
 And its accepted date is similar in 950 to 1025 AD
 tantralok kaa swaroop nidarshan kadachit ki tantralok acharya abhinavgupt kii sarvaadhik gambheer tathaa moulik kritiyon main anyatam he
 While he has commentaries on many important and contemporary or earlier works
 yahan ukt tathy ko tantralok rupi darpan main is prakaar sakate hai- The specialty of the tantraloka, from the interconnected and four-pronged view of the tantraloka, we have a very different form of vision from the grave subject
 lagbhag 12veen shatee ke rujuvimarshini ke lekhak ne ise ‘trickshastra’ athwa ‘triksaar shaastra’ kaha he or iske drushtaant ke rup ve tantralok kii hi panktiyaan uddhrut karte hai
 Therefore, it seems that by this time this book had become the most important text representing the triad tradition
 aa0 abhinavgupt ke prasiddh shishy kshemraj is granth ke vishay main do mahatvapurn tathy bataate hai- Abhinavagupta describes briefly in the Tantrasara that Tantraloka has Vedic method, from prohibitions to Shaiva, Tantra, Kul and Trik traditions
 yah tathy tantralok main baar-baar vistaarpurvak varnit he
 Ultimately, this form of Tantraloka becomes clear that this is the only exclusive and authoritative text presented by Abhinavagupta on the "trik-tradition"
 ‘tantrasaar’ ke anusaar tantralok na keval aagam parampara kaa kosh he balki vah tantra ke parsparik bhed gyaan or avaantar bhed ko sookshmatya vishleshit karanevaala ek aalochanatmak granth he
 According to Abhinav in the sound of the sound of the voice, the central sense of the Tantraloka revolves around the paramount power that has been called 'anuttara'
 tantralok kaa mukhya uddeshy vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue prakat karnaa tathaa uskaa vishleshan karnaa he
 Thus Tantraloc takes the form of a vaccine
 atev ise vaarthik, shloke vaarthik or shadardhashlokavarthik kaha gaya he
 Probably, the inspiration to give the name of Abhinavagupta to Katyayan came from the writers of Katyayan
 jahaan vaarthik ko ukt, anukt or durukt arth ke chintan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 It is clear that Tantraloka fully assimilates this definition
 Sometimes, Abhinavagupta calls Tantraloka a mixed form of all the vaccine-based variants
 is prakaar tantralok ek hi saath vaarthik bhashya or vritti kaa rup le letaa he
 Probably this is the reason that in the context of interpretation and analysis of some specific subjects, the Tantraloka is the authentic text
 is tantralok ko kahin-kahin ‘tantralok’ bhi kaha gaya he
 Abhinavagupta composed Tantraloka with diverse perspectives
 pratham or sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee kaaran uplabdh tantric sahitya tathaa parmparik tantragyan kaa vargeekaran karnaa tha
 Hence technically, Tantraloka is a collection book
 aa0 abhinavgupt kii rachana kaa moolbhoot uddeshy tantric stroton se hi nahin varan trik-bhinn parampara ko bhi aagam sahitya se sangruhit karnaa tha aa0 abhinav ne swayan is sandarbh main vichaar kiya he
 His clear objective was to present his ideas as the essence of the Agam tradition in which he proved to be the absolute best
 jiskaa jayrath ne aa0 abhinavgupt ko sangrkar kehete hue samarthan kiya he
 A
 Abhinav II but the most important objective was to present the process or method
 abhinavgupt vibhinn aagam siddhanton or paddatiyon main sarvshereshth rup main maanya anuttarashderdhakram parampara main kisi paddati or prakriya granth ke na hone se duhkhi the yah rikti ek chintya vishay thi
 In order to compensate for this, Abhinav decided to write the complete process book in every way
 yadhyapi aa0 abhinavgupt tathaa tantralok ke vivek tikaakar jayrath donon prakriya granth kii style ke sandarbh main spasht gyaan pradaan nahin karte hai
 However, Jayarath and Abhinavgupta's process books are full of information on the intended purpose
 is paripekshya main 4 nishkarsh uplabdh hote hai
 Now what does Tantraloka mean by process? Let's see this
 yadi ham tantralok ke pratham aahnik ke 14wein or 15wein shloke ko dekhen to yah pate hai ki prakriya or paddati shabd ek hi arth ko sanketit karte hai tathaa anya dhyatavya tathy yah he ki donon shabd ek vishesh varg ke granthon kii ore sanket karte hai
 Naturally, here the etymological meaning of the word process of grammaticalization is anakanksha
 vachaspatyam ke anusaar prakriya shabd kaa arth ek adhyay athwa krambaddharup prakaran he
 Whereas, according to Shabdakalpadru, the meaning of the word process is due to method, thus here the method takes the form of a definite sense text
 vachaspatyam or shabdakalpadrup donon is tathy se sahamat hai or hemachandra kaa naam samarthan hetu uddhrut karte hai
 According to these lexicographers, the processual text reveals the process of a subject to express its intent
 tantralok ke sookshm adhyayan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki aa0 abhinav kaa prakriya sambandhi siddhanth ukt prakriya kii paribhaasha ke ati sannikat he
 In Abhinavagupta Tantralok, the 'paratrishaika' is called the Anspraapriakra
 yah kathan hi paratrishikavivaran ko bhi prakriyagranth maanane hetu paryaapt he
 Abhinavagupta also uses the word 'process' in other places in the sense of 'sadhana'
 yah tathy tab or bhi drudh ho jaataa he jab abhinav svachhnd tantra kaa ‘prakriya se shreshth’ koi gyaan nahi he’ yah kathan udghrut karte he
 Jairath eliminates all doubts by clarifying the differences between systems due to process differences
 is prakaar yah spashtatah kaha ja saktaa he ki vidhi-nishedhathit tathaa vidhi-nishedhaatmak ubhay vishisht sadhana vidhiyon ko prastut karne vaale granth ko prakriya granth kehete he
 Abhinav, as is known, uses the second word method in this process sense
 parantu unki paddati kaa adarsh swaroop kya tha ? yah agyaat he tathaapi ve ‘ishanshiv’ kii ek paddati ko uddhrut karte hai jo ki paddati ke mul bhav ko prastut karti he tathaa jo devyayaamal granth main varnit hai
 This Ishanasiva is definitely different from the Gurudev method or the Tantra method, its author, Ishanshiva
 jo nishchit rup se 1073 i0 ke baad hue the
 According to Dr
 Ramchandra Dwivedi, the author of the book 'karmakandavali', Somasambhu was the supreme master of 'ishanshiva'
 kshemraj ke anusaar aa0 abhinav ke ek guru dharm shiv ne apratyaksh se is parampara main paddati lekhan kaa prarambh karte hue ek paddati likhi jise abhinav ne uddhrut kiya he kintu uskaa naam nahin bataaya he
 It is possible that the non-submission of various methods and one of them to their tradition was the cause of the misery of Abhinav
 ‘nath-sampradaay’ kaa prasiddh granth ‘siddhasiddhantapaddati’ jo ki bahut paraparti he jo ki ‘pratybhigna’ sampradaay ke uddharanon se paripurna he or saamaanya rup main paddati parampara ke granthon kii ore sanket karata he
 Thus it is logical to conclude that Tantraloka is a process or method book and 'trika' is a comprehensive regulatory text of life-view
 abhinav kaa tritiy uddeshy tantralok ko ek paripureshastra athwa shashan ke rup main prastut karnaa tha
 As in later times it became indeterminate form of process scripture
 atah jayrath aa0 abhinavgupt ko baarambaar shaastrakaar ke rup main samaran karte hai
 Jairath follows the classical form of Tantraloka at the beginning of his phrase and Vivek Tika
 chunki kisi bhi shaastra kaa anubandh chatushtya hota he atah jayrath bhi anubandh chatushtya kii sthapana karte hai jo is prakaar - 1
 vishay, 2
 prayojan, 3
 adhikari, 4
 sambandh
 Their serial description is as follows- iske atirikt prayek shaastra ke prarambh vighn nirasanarth karaniya mangalacharan rup stutivat yahan bhi ganesh tathaa batuka kii stuti kii gayi he
 Abhinav focuses on 'tantraloka' as a complete eulogy under his fourth last attempt
 ve apane upkram vaakya tathaa praarambhik prastaavna shlokon ke ant main or isi prakaar upsanhaar ke shlokon main kisi bhi prakaar kaa sandehavkaash nahin chhodte hai
 Whenever he gets the opportunity, he expresses Tantralok devotion and devotion
 unke netron main tantralok tab samgr swaroop sahit arth praapt karata he jab ve shaktipatombhishit shaivi bhavoplabdhi hetu unmukh hote hai
 Tantraloka describes both the path and process of this supernatural gesture with very clear ease
 thik utani sahajata ke saath, jitani kisi maanav kii dincharya kii style swayammev, sahajata se sampann hoti rahati he
 He climbs to the pinnacle of spontaneity, radiating his senses without ignorance, through eloquence, on the backy ground - "when one becomes possessed by this Shaivic sense, then the cloud of the thoughts of his heart automatically differs
 And in the light of the heart, the sun of the supreme form of knowledge rises or becomes bright
 tantralokakar kaa yah atyant bhavpurn kathan un navsaadhakon ke hriday main vishwaas kaa sanchaar kar unhen purnahambhavoplabdhi hetu agrasar kar detaa he jo sristimimasaa se upar uthakar tatva-mimasaa main rat hai
 It is only through this deeply devotional spirit that the procedural form of Tantraloka can be discussed
 sambhavtah isi drushtikon ko tantralok ke upkram tathaa upsanhaar main mahimanveet kiya gaya he
 Subtle study of Tantraloka gives us a clear sense of the purpose of Abhinavagupta behind this creation
 aa0 abhinav sarvapradhan uddeshy bhairaviy bhavoplabdhi athwa bhairav taadaatmayata kii samprapti he
 A
 Abhinav also proclaims that in the 37 parts of Tantraloka, the subject mentioned in the Tantraloka will be a continuous practice, and in the entire Tantraloka, the objective is not to be blown away by this purpose
 Specifying its atomic merger in the midst of the attainment of cosmic form by self-realization Newale the subsequent analysis of all the steps
 aa0 abhinav apni praathamiktaaon ko baarambaar kehete hue thakte nahin hai
 He states that his real commitment in Tantraloka is with the presentation of unquote
 gyaanachatushk jo ki mukti ke kaaran hai unki ruparekha samast vishwatmbodh or purnahambhaav ke udai hetu banaayi gayi he
 A
 Abhinava cites the sound of Thalayanoka that the central sense of Tantraloka is the accomplishment of that invisible Parameshwara Bhava
 aa0 abhinav ke anusaar ek maatr shaktipaat hi mumuksh kaa sanchaalak bal he
 They are most conscious of the solution to the problem of freedom from bondage
 yatha aa0 abhinav yah spasht karte hue aage badhate hai ki tantralok multah swatmapratyabhigyaan rup pratibhasanvitti gyaapak he
 Due to the complete realization of the practice of sensing this person, the person becomes 'pratibha Guru', by whose mere 'grace-sarcasm', the whole world can attain Bhairava identity
 aa0 abhinav or tantralok ke tikaakar jayrath donon ise apni kriti kii prashansa karnaa nahin maanate hai varan kehete hai ki ukt kathan yatharth he
 The presentation of Tantraloka brings to the fore the other authoritative other motive
 aatmasaakshaatkaar samast aadhyatmik sampradaayon kaa charam lakshya he or iskaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kaaran aatmavimarsh he
 In this supreme personal achievement, the reason for the different texts other than Tantraloka is not enabled
 aa0 abhinav kii swathmsanvitti, heyopadey nirnay main amogh karanroop sartak, samast shaivashaastra par purna adhikaar or trik-parampara kaa gahan gyaan, yah sabhi usee anuttar tatva kii disha main unmukh hai or sabhi paraspar sanyukt hokar aa0 abhinav ke pratipaadan ko gahan gammbhiry or atyant vistaar pradaan karte hai
 Three levels are attained until any knowledge level is attained
 jayrath ek apratyaksh sanket dete hai ki aa0 abhinav kaa bauddhik tathaa aadhyatmik vaibhav, unke shastramukhagam-nijanubhavsiddh swathmsanvitti rup purna gyaan se yukt vishwatm vyaktitv ko prakat karata he
 Not under certain circumstances, but actually Tantraloka is an idealized and authentic text that presents the sacra tradition
 aa0 abhinav tantralok dwaara tantric vidhiyon or gyaan kii saral prastuti ko tritiy uddeshy maanate hai
 Keeping this point in mind, he made the same subjects and concepts the subject of his discussion
 jisase sab log labhanvit ho saken
 He gave a simple explanation, presenting the contentious issues
 tantralok ke dhyanpurvak avlokan se sankalan ke prishthbhumirup aa0 abhinav kaa ek or uddeshy drusht hota he jise ati saavdhaanee purvak sthapit kiya gaya he
 'he is the regulation and protection of the sacra system
 ’ unke teen udaahranon main se tantralok ke prarambh main pratham ‘sampradayochhitaih tathaa maghy main shesh do ‘vidambita’ tathaa bhrashtavidhuh unke is drushtikon ko purnatah spasht karte hai
 From the very beginning, Abhinav informs that some people who were scholarly in the scriptures but could not be attained Trikgyan due to being non-traditional
 dwitiya udhaaharan kaa taatpary yah he ki kuch log aise bhi the jinhone na to shastradhyayan kiya or na hi maardarshak guru kii pratiksha athwa khoj kii
 Thus, they were easily confused
 tritiy uddhran se yah sanket miltaa he ki kuch parmparik gyaan ke vishisht tathaa aavashyak ang yaa to lupt ho gaye the athwa in vikrut ho gaye the ki unke mulswaroop kaa anveshan asambhav ho gaya tha
 In the first and second stages, A
 Abhinav used his traditional knowledge and intellect
 In the third stage, he used 'nyas-vidhi' as other options, which is called 'malini'
 jayrath tantralok ke pareekshan purvak yah mat vyakt karte he ki aa0 abhinav jahaan bhi kisi aagam parampara or mat ko uddhadhrut karte he tab ve uske prati vipareet or bhram-purna avadharana ko khandit karte he or use uske yatharya swaroop main apni adwitiya medha dwaara santhaapit karte hai
 In this way, we enrich the knowledge related to the said source
 is vivechna ke anantar ham is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki abhinav ke uddeshy main se ek adhoshit uddeshy uplabdh tathaa parmparik tantric sahitya or sadhana ko punerjeevit karte hue bhavishya ke liye surakshit karnaa tha
 In this context, some more facts can be said, examining their style and methods
 purv varnit tathyo par dhyaan dene se ham abhinav ke udveshy or prayoso ko do virgo main baat sakate hai pratham 1

 kumarasambhav mahakavi kalidas virachit kartikeya ke janm se sambandhit mahakavy jisaki gananaa sanskrit ke panch mahakavyon main kii jaati he
 This epic has a memorable and captivating description at many places
 himalayavarnan, parvati kii tapasya, brahmacharee kii shivaninda, vasant aagaman, shivparvati vivaah or ratikriya varnan adbhut anubhuti utpann karte hai
 Kalidasa's portrayal of women such as Bala Parvati, Tapaswini Parvati, Vinayavati Parvati and Pragalbha Parvati etc
 is amazing
 yah mahakavy 17 sargron main samaapt hua he, kintu lok dharna he ki keval pratham aath sarg hi kalidas rachit he
 The other nine cantos of the latter are believed to be the creation of another poet
 kuch logon kii dharna he ki kavy aath sargon main hi shivparvati samagam ke saath kumaar ke janm kii purvasuchana ke saath hi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Some say that Kalidasa got leprosy and could not write due to describing Shivparvati's sexual intercourse in the eighth canto
 ek mat yah bhi he ki unka sambhogvarnan janamanas ko ruchi nahin isliye unhone aage nahin likhaa
 The narrative described in it is summarized as follows - parvataraaj himalay ke mainaak naamak putr or gauri naamak kanya hui
 The girl also became famous by the name Parvati and Uma
 jab kanya hui to ek din uske ghar naarad aae or bhavishyavaanee kii ki kanya kaa vivaah shiv se hoga
 Hearing this prediction, the Himalayas became relaxed
 udhar shiv himalay ke shikhar par tap kar rahe the
 The Himalayas sent Uma with a friend to take care of her and Uma began to serve Shiva with devotion
 unheen dinon tarakasur se yuddh main devtaa log parajeet ho gaye
 The monster started committing many kinds of tricks
 tab indra sahit saare devtaa brahma ke paas aae
 Demanded a commander worthy of Tarakasura
 tab brahma ne kaha ki shankar ke veery se utpann purush hi tumhaara yogya senapati ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you people should try and be enamored with Shiva Parvati
 yadi shiv ne parvati ko sweekaar kar liya to parvati se jo putr hoga to uske senapati banane par tumhaari vijay hogi
 Thereafter, Indradi gathered to think of a way to remove the deprivation of Lord Shiva
 jab madan us sabha me aae to indra ne unase annurodh kiya ki ve apane mitra vasant ke saath shiv ke tapasya sthaan par jaayan or shiv ko parvati ke prati aasakt karen
 Accordingly, Madan arrived at Shankar's ashram with his wife Rati and friend Vasant
 jab parvati kamalbies kii maala arpan karne shiv ke nikat pahaunchi or shiv ne use lene ke liye haath badhaaya, tab madan ne apane dhanush par mohanastra chadhaaya
 Immediately Shiva's mind was distracted
 shankar ne is prakaar man ke aksmaat vikrut hone kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye chaaron ore drushti daudai
 He saw Madan doing the grooming
 use dekhte hi shiv aag babula ho gaye; unke tritiy netra se agnijvaala prakat hui or madan usamen bhasma ho gaya
 On seeing her husband devouring like this, Rati started mourning and asked Vasant to prepare a pyre and agreed to give up her own life
 tab akashwani hui ki thodaa sabar karo tumhe tumhaara pati pun praapt hoga
 On the other hand, Shiva entered into an obstacle to avoid feminization
 madan ke bhasma hone or shiv ke antardhan ho jane se parvati ne apana sara manorath vifal hote dekha or yah sochakar ki yah rupasaundarya vyarth he, ve shiv ko prasann karne ke liye ek parvat shikhar par ja kar ugr tap karne lagi
 After sometime, Shiva's mind melted, he thought of accepting Parvati
 kintu isse purv unhone parvati kii pariksha karne kaa nishchay kiya or ve ek tapasvi ke ashram main pahunche
 Parvati received him as a guest
 tadantar us tarun tapasvi ne parvati se jigyaasa kii ki kiski prapti ke liye itani ugr tapasya kar rahi ho
 On hearing the question of the guest, Parvati was ashamed and hesitated to express her feelings, then her sakhi spoke of the desire to attain Shiva
 yah sunakar tapasvi veshdhari shiv, shiv ke durgunon or kurupata aadi kaa ullekh kar unki ninda karne lage
 Parvati did not condemn this Shiva and started scolding her
 tab shiv apane swaroop me prakat hue or unka haath pakad liya
 After that Shiva called Saptarshi and sent it to the Himalayas
 unhone unase jaakar bataaya ki shiv ne parvati kaa panigrahan karne kii ichha prakat kii he
 Then the marriage was decided and preparations for marriage started
 saptamatrikas duulhe ke yogya vastra lekar ai par shiv ne un sab ko sweekaar nahin kiya or nandi par savaar hokar hi chale
 After that, all the marriages took place
 vivaah sampann hone par shiv sahit parvati ne brahma ko pranaam kiya
 Brahma blessed
 tumhen vir putr ho
 The Apsaras came and presented a play in front of the bride and groom
 naatak samaapt hone ke baad indra ne shiv se madan ko jivit karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Finally the solitary union of Shiva and Parvati is discussed in detail

 Aryashtangam Marg is one of the major teachings of Mahatma Buddha, which has been described as a means of attaining freedom from suffering and self-knowledge
 ashtaang maarg ke sabhi 'maarg', 'samyak' shabd se armbh hote hai 
 In Buddhist symbols, ashtanga passages are often represented by the eight todos of the Dharmachakra
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is - the way to get rid of sorrow
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagavan buddha ne bataaya ki trishna hi sabhi du:khon kaa mul kaaran he
 Due to craving, man tends towards different things in the world; And when he cannot get them or when they are destroyed even after receiving, then he feels sad
 trishna ke saath mrityu praapt karanevaala praani uski prerana se phir bhi janm grahan karata he or sansar ke du:khachakr main pisataa rahata he
 Therefore, the way to satisfy Trishna completely is the path to salvation
 ise du:kha-nirodh-gamini pratipada kehete hai
 Lord Buddha has given eight parts of this path: is maarg ke pratham do ang pragna ke or antim do samadhi ke hai
 The middle four are of modesty
 is tarah sheel, samadhi or pragna inhen teen main aathon angon kaa sannivesh ho jaataa he
 Only when modesty is pure can one enter into spiritual life
 shuddh sheel ke aadhaar par mumukshu dhyanabhyas kar samadhi kaa laabh karata he or samadhisth avasthaa main hi use satya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is called Pragya, as soon as it becomes enlightened, the seeker is interviewed with the impermanent, anonymous and sorrowful form of power
 pragna ke alok main iskaa agyanandhkaar nasht ho jaataa he
 This leaves all the desires of the world
 vitatrishna ho vah kahin bhi ahankaar mamkaar nahin karata or sukh du:kha ke bandhan se upar uth jaataa he
 Due to the absence of craving for the difference of this life, there is no one to take birth again
 is prakaar, sheel-samadhi-pragnawala maarg aath angon main vibhakt ho arya aashtangik maarg kaha jaataa he

 sakshartaa kaa arth he sakshar hona arthath padhne or likhane kii kshamta se sampann hona
 Different countries have different standards of literacy
 bharat main rashtriya sakshartaa mishan ke anusaar agar koi vyakti apana naam likhane or padhne kii yogyata hasil kar letaa he to use sakshar mana jaataa he
 The literacy rate of a country or state is called the ratio of the total population of the people there and the number of educated people
 adhikansh yah pratishat main darshaya jaataa he
 But sometimes it is also shown per-category
 isko samajhane kaa ganitiya sutara he:sakshartaa dar pratishat = shikshit jansankhya / kul jansankhya ∗ 100 { \ displaystyle *100} That is, how many people are literate out of every hundred people
 azaadi ke samay bharat kii sakshartaa dar maatr baarah pratishat thi jo bad kar lagbhag chohattar pratishat ho gayi he
 But even now India is far behind the normal rate of the world
 bharat main sansar kii sabase adhik anpadh jansankhya nivas karti he
 The current situation is as follows: jab se bharat ne shiksha kaa adhikaar lagu kiya he, tab se bharat kii sakshartaa dar bahut adhik badi he
 The huge changes in Kerala Himachal, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan have reversed the functioning of these states and almost all children are now educated there

 jamoora ek pradarshak-kalakaar hota he jo bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttar bhaag ke bhaand, tamaasha or nautanki jaisi lok-naatak shaileyon main ek sahaayak kaa kaam karata he
 Jamure is owned by him, often called Ustad or Madari
 vaise to jamoore kaa kaam apane ustad ke har hukum kaa paalan karnaa hota he, lekin isamen aksar vah kuch aisi galatiyaan yaa harakatein karata he jis se dekhne waalon ke liye vyangy yaa tanz paidaa hota he
 The pageant of ustad-jamure is also known by other names, such as madari-jamura, ustad-bacha and madari-chela
 kyonki jamoore kaa kaam apane ustad kii bate bina taale maananaa hota he isliye bharat or pakistan kii lok-samskruti main agar koi aadmi yaa santhaan kisi anya vyakti ke aadesh chupchaap maan rahi ho to use tiraskaar-purvak dhang se jamoora kah diya jaataa he

 aadhunik vaigyanik tharmametre or taapmaana paimaane kaa upyog karne vaale taapmaana maap kaa avishkaar aarambhik 18veen sadi main hua tha, jab gaberial farenheit ne ole cristansen roemar dwaara viksit kiye gaye tharmametre or paimaane ko apanaaya tha
 In addition to the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale, the Fahrenheit scale is still used
 taapmaana ko maapne ke liye kai tareeke viksit kiye gaye hai
 Most of these are based on measuring some physical properties of a material with varying temperatures
 taapmaana ko maapne kaa sabase saamaanya upkaran kaanch kaa tharmametre he
 It is made of glass tube and contains mercury or any other substance inside it, which acts as a caretaker
 taapmaana main paare ke vistaar ke kaaran vruddhi hoti he, atah taral padaarth kii maatra ko maapkar taapmaana kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can easily read the temperature by looking at the level of fluid in the thermometer
 Another type of thermometer is a gas thermometer, which is usually used less frequently, but theoretically has great value
 taapmaana ko maapne ke anya mahatvapurn upkaran nimnlikhit hai: When measuring temperature one must be careful to ensure that the temperature of the measuring instrument is the same as the temperature of the material to be measured
 kuch sthitiyon main maapan yantra kaa taap taapmaana pravanta ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, atah mapa gaya taapmaana padaarth ke vaastavik taapmaana se bhinn ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the measured temperature varies not only from the temperature of the substance, but also from the heat transfer property of the substance
 is prabhaav kii charam sthiti hawa ke sard kaarak ko badhaati he, jahaan taapmaana samaan rahane par bhi hawaadaar or shant paristhiti ke kaaran mausam thanda ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, air increases the rate of heat transfer of the body, resulting in a lower body temperature at the same broad temperature
 tharmamitaron kaa saidhantik aadharaushmpravagiki kaa shunya siddhant he, jisaki avadharana he ki yadi aapke paas teen vasteen e, bi or si hai, evam e or bi kaa taapmaana samaan he, tathaa bi or si kaa taapmaana samaan he, to e or si kaa taapmaana bhi samaan hoga
 jahaan, bi tharmametre he
 The practical basis of temperature measurement is the existence of a three point cell
 tri binduen daab, maatra or taapmaana kii sthitiyaan hai, atah tri charan nirantar maujuud rahete hai, udhaaharan ke liye thos, bhaap or drav
 ekal ghatak ke liye tri bindu or koshanu se gaayab ek yaa adhik charnon main teen char parinaamon main koi bhi parivartan swatantra avasthaa main nahin hote hai
 Therefore, triple point cells can be used as a universal reference for temperature and pressure
 kuch sthitiyon main, kaale padaarth ke vikiran par plank ke siddhant kaa pratyaksh upyog kar taapmaana maapan sambhav hota he
 For example, the cosmic microwave wave background temperature can be measured by reflecting photons observed by satellite observations such as WMAP

 yivu china ke ek targarm kshetra main sthit he
 It is under the huge province of Zhijiang near the south-eastern region of China

 There is also a mountainous area around this city
 parantu pahaad vishaal va ghaney nahin hai
 It can also be called at a distance of about 60-70 km from the city of sewing machine parts
 yivu naam ke is vishaltam vyavsaayik shahar kii sabase mukhya visheshta yah he ki gharelu upyogi vastuon ke vyavsaayikon va vyapaariyon ko duniyon bhar kii sari vastuvon kii puri jaankaree yaheen par mil jaati he
 There are products from manufacturers of domestic products all over China

 The same kind of goods are found in so many shops in one floor

 Here the purchase and purchase is found to be negligible
 ye sab dukaane bade chote audyogic gharaanon se sambandhit hi hai
 There can be no exaggeration to say only for display in English
 adhikoshat: yahon kharid aadesh hi hote hai tathaa vastuvon kii aapurti utpaadit kaarkaanon se hi kii jaati he

 shrautasutra vaidic granth hai or vastut: vaidic karmkand kaa kalpavidhan he
 Havan, Yagas, prayers and sessions are envisaged under Shrutasutra
 inke dwaara aihik evam parlokik fal praapt hote hai
 The Shrutasutras perform the rituals of the same veditha karmas which are ritualized by the Ahitagni on the Shrouta Agni
 'shrout' shabd 'shruti' se vyutpann he
 These compositions are authored texts written by Divyadarshi karmic maharishis in the Sutra style on which the commentaries and commentaries and pamphletic methods and many essays by later Yagnik scholars are available
 is prakaar uplabdh sutara tathaa unke bhashya paryaapt rup se pramanit karte hai ki bhartiya sahitya main inkaa sthaan kitna pramukh rahaa he
 The importance of Shrout literature was also diverted to the Western mystics as a result of which the Western scholars also edited several long volumes
 pramukh shrautasutra granth hai: Shruti Karma is called 'shrout' and Smriti Karma is called 'smart'
 shrout evam smart karmon ke anushthan kii vidhi vedang kalp ke dwaara niyantrit he
 Vedang has six and Kalpa is prominent among them
 panineey shiksha use 'veda kaa haath' kahati he
 Kalpa consists of Shrutasutra, Grihyasutra, Dharmasutra and Shulbasutra
 inamen shrautasutra shrautakarm ke vidhaan, grihyasutra smartakarm ke vidhaan, dharmasutra samayik aachaar ke vidhaan tathaa shulbasutra karmanushthan ke nimitt karm main apekshit yajyashala, vedi, mandap or kunda ke nirmaan kii prakriya ko kehete hai
 According to Shroutasutra, there are two main institutions of rituals which are called Havi: Institution and Somasastha
 smart agni par kriyman paksanstha he
 Among these three institutions, there are seven prabhas with the addition of which there are 21 institutions
 havi:sanstha main devatavishesh ke uddeshy se samarpit havirdravya ke dwaara yag kiya jaataa he
 In Somasastha, Somaras are invoked on Shraatagni and post-mortification is also prescribed
 isliye ye pashuyayag hai
 Apart from these institutions, there are Agnaychana, Rajasuya and Ashwamedha Prabhriti Yag and Saraswatashatra Prabhriti sessions and Kameshishtis
 shrautakarm ke do pramukh bhed hai
 Nityakarma such as Agnihotrahavan and Naimitikarma which is inspired by some incident or desire, performs Yajaman
 swayan yajmaan apni patni ke saath rutvijon kii sahaayta se yag kar sata he
 The sole goal of the Srautasutra, the rituals performed by the Yajaman, the duties of the Ritjis, the worshiping deity of each Karma, the appropriate substance of the Yagas, the sangopang description of the organs and appendages of the Karma and their sacrificial order, the atonement of the reversal of the law and the type of legislation
 is
 shrautakarmon main kuch karm prakruthikarm hote hai
 The description of the process of their Sangopag ritual has been given by the Shrutasutras
 jin karmon kii mukhya prakriya prakruthikarm kii ruparekha main aabaddh hokar keval falvishesh ke anusandhan ke anuroop vishisht devtaa yaa dravya or kaal aadi kaa hi keval vivechan he ve vikruthikarm hai, kaaran shrautasutra ke anusaar 'prakruti bhanti vikruthikarm karo' yah aadesh diya gaya he
 In this way, the dimension of the subject of the Shrutasutras has become serious and complex, because due to the strictness of the rules given in relation to every prescribed organ and appendage in the Karmanuthan with the utmost rigor, it is necessary for the attainment of the unrivaled fruit
 shrautakarm ke anushthan main chaaron vedon kaa sahyog prakalpit he
 The Rigveda presides over the leadership of the Rigveda, the Yajurveda through the Adhvaryukrama, the Samaveda through the Upadhyaya and the Atharva Veda sustains the work of Brahma
 atev shrautasutra vedachatushti se sambandh rakhte hai
 The Vedas that the Yajaman is a follower of are the prominence of that Veda or branch of that Veda
 isi kaaran yagyeey kalp main prayek vedashakhanusaar prabhed ho gaye hai jinpar deshaachaar, kulachaar aadi sweey visheshtaon kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Due to this, there is some difference in the process of Karmanasuthan due to branch discrimination and the Yajman of each branch is controlled by the discipline of Kalpa related to his own Veda
 is parampara ke kaaran shrautasutra bhi vedachatushti kii prabhinn shakha ke anusaar pruthak pruthak rachit hai

 The Greek notion of sacred hospitality is explained in the story of Telemachus and Nestor
 jab telemacas nestor se milane aayaa, nestor isse anbhigya tha ki uskaa atithi uske puraane mitra orissius kaa putr he
 But Nestor nevertheless welcomed Telemachus and his party freely, thus demonstrating the relationship between hostis "strangers" and hostire "equivalents or equals" as to how these two converge in the notion of hospitality
 baad main, nestor ke putron main se ek is baat kii dekhbhaal karte huye ki use koi takalif na ho, telemacas ke najadik ke bistar par so gaya
 Nestor also left a buggy and horse for Telemachus so that he could travel by land from Pilas to Sparta and appointed his son Pisistratus as the charioteer

 Celtic societies have also respected the notion of hospitality, especially in relation to rescue
 a host, who has granted asylum to a person, is not only expected to provide food and shelter to his guest but he also has to ensure that the guest is not harmed under his care

 while exhibiting a special kind of hospitality 
 udhaaharan ke liye: The term "hospitality ethics" is used for two different, but related, areas of study: kya kiya janaa chaiye, bataane ke liye aachaar shaastra jahaan "kya kiya gaya he" ke pare jaataa he; aatithy aachaar shaastra aatithy se jude huye masalon main "kya kiya janaa chaiye " bataata he
 Hospitality principles and standards across cultures and traditions; And throughout history, hospitality has been derived from complex analysis of practices, processes and relationships
 antat, aatithy siddhanton ko vaanijyak evam gaiyr-vaanijyak vyavasthaaon main prayukt kiya gaya he
 As a standard of mold, hospitality has been considered throughout history as a law, an ethics, a doctrine, a code, a duty, a virtue, etc
 in paramarshon ko atithiyon, mejabaanon, nagarikon evam aparichiton ke madhya anishchit sambandhon ke niptaare hetu srujit kiya gaya tha
 Despite their ancient origins and ubiquity in human cultures, the theory of hospitality has received comparatively little attention by moral philosophers, and has focused its attention on other moral principles such as good, bad, right and wrong
 ab tak naitik aadesh, yaa aachaar shastreey drushtikon ke rup main aatithy ne aachaar shastreey vyavhaar hetu kai anya paramarshon ko peeche choda he: pracheen madhyapurv, yunaan evam roman samskritiyon main aatithy kaa aachaar shaastra ek code tha jo atithiyon evam mejabaanon se ek nishchit prakaar ke aacharan kii maang karata tha
 An example: In the knight, it is necessary to provide food and accommodation when the station personnel ask for other people
 kai roopon main, vyavhaar ke ye maanak vartmaan samay main vanijyik aatithy udyog tak maujuud rahe hai, jahaan pracheen vichaaron ke vanshaj vartmaan maanakon evam prachalanon ko suchit karte rahete hai
 Ethics in commercial hospitality systems
 Applied ethics is that branch of ethics that examines our classical principles and decisions
 anuprayukt aachaar shaastra kii kai shakhayein hai: vyapaar aachaar shaastra, vyavsaayik aachaar shaastra, chikitsa aachaar shaastra, shaikshanik aachaar shaastra, paryaavarniya aachaar shaastra evam anya
 Hospitality ethics is a branch of applied ethics
 vyavhaar main, yah anuprayukt aachaar shaastra kii anya shakhaon ke sambandhon ko milaataa he, jaise ki vyapaar aachaar shaastra, paryaavarniya aachaar shaastra, vyavsaayik aachaar shaastra, evam anya
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek sthaneey aatithy udyog tarakkee karata he, tab sambhavit aachaar shastreey duvidhaayen prachurtaa se saamne aati hai: udyog ke prachalanon kaa paryaavaran par kya prabhaav hota he? mejabaan samudaay par kya prabhaav hota he? sthaneey arthvyavastha par kya prabhaav hota he? sthaneey samudaay; bahari vyaktiyon, paryatakon evam atithiyon ke bare main nagarikon ke ravaiye par kya prabhaav hota he? ye aise kuch prashn hai jo ki anuprayukt aachaar shaastra ke ek sanskaran ke rup main aatithy aachaar shaastra puch saktaa he
 Since hospitality and tourism together create the largest service industries in the world, there is a lot of potential for good and bad behavior and right and wrong actions for people associated with hospitality and tourism
 in udyogon main aachaar shaastra aacharan samhitaon, karmchaaree minial, udyog maanakon evam kai anya dwaara nirdeshit hota he
 Although the World Tourism Organization has proposed codes of conduct according to the industry, there is currently no global code for the hospitality industry

 German scientist George Simon Ohm, who discovered resistance among electric drivers, struggled throughout his life
 vidyut dhara parichaalan kii khoj karne vaale om professor bananaa chaahate the lekin tatkaaleen gatirodhon ne unhen yah sammaan praapt nahin karne diya
 Om received the rank of professor a few years before his death
 germany ke airlanjen main 16 march 1789 ko janme om ke pita ek anpadh talasaaj the lekin pita ne om or unke bhai bahan kii padhai main koi kami nahin hone di
 It would be ironic that Om, who was interested in more experiments than reading, discovered a quality associated with the electrical circuit that would eventually go the way of reducing power consumption and finding useful drivers
 airlanjen vishvavidhyalay main unki kalege shiksha hui
 At the same time, the new electro chemical cell was discovered by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta

 Om laid the foundation for electrical circuit analysis
 vah unke prerak pita hi the jinhone om ko is mukaam par pahunchaaya jisase vah duniya ko kuch de sakane ke kaabil bane
 Failing to concentrate in university education brought Om to the right path
 pita ne om ko sitambar 1806 main switsraland bheja
 His research was first published in 1827 in 'the Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically' about the resistance to which Ohm gave his rule
 ise kaaphi der se varsh 1841 main landan sthit royal socity se manyata mili or unhen kople padak se sammanit kiya gaya
 George Simon Ohm discovered the distribution of electromagnetic force and established a definite relationship between the resistance conductor force and the magnitude of the current
 prayog kii manyata ko lekar ashankit om ne ise siddhant rup main bhi taiyaar kiya
 But he was afraid of what happened
 unhone dhara ke pratikul bidaa uthaaya tha
 He introduced the theory of physics at a time when physics in Germany was not recognized from a mathematical point of view
 yahi kaaran he ki khoj ko vah prasiddhi nahin mili jisaki vah hakdaar thi
 Resistance cannot be ignored when designing circuits

 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi
 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar

 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent
 is ladaai kaa adhikansh hissaa donon pakshon kii thal sena ne ladaa
 Before the Kargil War, there was never such a large military gathering in Kashmir
 yuddh main paidal or bakhtarband tukadiyon ne vayusena kii madad se anek abhiyaanon main hissaa liya
 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war
 bharat or pakistan ke 1947 main hue batwaare ke samay se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich kai muddo par tanatani chal rahi thi haalanki jammu or kashmir kaa mudda isame sabase bada tha par anya seemaa vivaad bhi the iname sabase pramukh kuccha kaa ran, jo ki ek banjar ilaaka he, ke batwaare par tha
 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch

 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa 3500 varg kilometre par tha
 
 kuccha ke ran main mili safalataa se utsahit pakistan ke rajanetaaon khaskar tatkaaleen videshmantri zulfikar ali bhutto ne rashtrpati or senadhyaksh general ayub khan par dabaav daalaa ki ve kashmir par hamale kaa aadesh de
 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time
 iske alaava bhutto or unke vichaar se sahamat anya generalo yahya khan or tikka khan kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki kashmir kii janata bharat se aaazaad hokar pakistan se vilay kii icchhuk he or sainiko ko ghuspaithiyon ke vesh main bhejne par unke samarthan main vidroh kar degi
 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly
 bhartiya atirikt tukadiya laane main safal ho gayi or bharat ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main 8 kilometre andar ghus kar haji pir darre par kabja kar liya
 With this occupation Pakistan came into being
 abhiyaan jibraltar ke ghuspaithiye sanikon kaa rasta bharatiyon ke kabje main aa gaya tha or abhiyaan vifal ho gaya
 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be
 ek din kii deree ke baavjood bharat ke pashchimi kaman ke sena pramukh yah jaanate the ki pakistan bahut behatar sthiti main he or usko rokane ke liye unhone yah prastaav tatkaaleen senadhyaksh general choudhary ko diya ki punjab seemaa main ek nayaa morcha khol kar lahore par hamalaa kar diya jaay
 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran

 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away
 bharat ne pratinkraman main barki gaanv ke sameep nahar ko paar karne main safalataa arjeet kar lee
 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision
 ve turant hi seemaa paar karke icchhogil nahar pahuch gayi pakistani sena ne puliyaaon par raksha daste tainaat kar diye jin pulo ko bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha unako uda diya gaya pakistan ke is kadam se bhartiya sena kaa aage badhnaa ruk gaya
 The 3 Jats, a unit of the Jat Regiment, crossed the canal and captured Dograi and Batapore
 usee din pakistani sena ne bakhtarband ikai or vayusena kii madad se bhartiya sena kii 15ve khand par bada pratiakraman kiya haalaaki isse 3 jat ko maamuli nuksaan hi hua lekin 15ve khand ko peeche hatana padaa or uske rasad or hathiyaaro ke vahno ko kaaphi kshati pahuchi
 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill
 5 maratha kii madad ke liye bheje gayi 3 gurkha or 954 baari topakhana kaa dasta pakistani vaayu sena ke baari hamale ke kaaran pahuch nahin paaya or rasad le kar barmer se aa rahi tren bhi garda road rail adde ke paas hamale kaa shikaar ho gayi 10 sitambar ko munaabao par pakistan kaa kabja ho gaya
 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries
 bharat ke 1 bakhtarband khand jise bhartiya sena kii shaan kaha jaataa tha ne sialkot kii disha main hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat
 isse utsahit hokar pakistan kii sena ne bharatiyon par pratiakraman kar diya or bhartiya seemaa main aage ghus aayi
 For its final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar
 unke anusaar amritsar ke baad jalandhar or phir raashtrapati ayub khan kii taraf se aaye bayaan ke anusaar dilli aglaa lakshya hota
 The Pakistani Army moved ahead of Khemkaran as India's fourth mountain division, 7 Mountain Brigade, 62 Mountain Brigade, Deccan Horse, equipped with Sherman tanks, stood for battle with their other division

 jahaan isse pehle aage chal rahi pakistani sena asal uttar ke yudhd main haarane se bharat ke paksh main yuddh kaa santulan jhuk gaya
 After this, this place came to be known as Patton Nagar over the Pakistani tanko named Patton made in America
 is ladaai ke baad pakistan kii pehali bakhtarband divijan ko waapas sialkot bhej diya gaya jahaan phir usne yuddh main aage bhaag nahin liya
 By this time, the war had come to a standstill and both the countries were paying more attention to protect the areas they had won
 ladaai main bhartiya sena ke 3000 or pakistani sena ke 3800 jawan shahid ho chuke the
 India occupied 710 square kilometers in the war and Pakistan occupied 210 square kilometers

 For the first time since independence in this war, the planes of the Indian Air Force and the Pakistani Air Force fought each other
 isse pehle in donon vaayu-senaaon ne 1940 ke dashak main pratham kashmir yuddh main hissaa liya tha jisamen ki 1965 yuddh kii tulana main inkaa yogadan bahut kam or keval parivahan tak hi simit tha
 The Indian Air Force had a large number of Hawker Hunters, Faland Nate, De Havilland Vampires, EE Canberra bombers and a squadron of mig-21s built in India
 pakistani vaayu sena ke fadter plane the- 102 F-86F saibar or 12 F-104 starfiter, or 24 B-57 canberra bamavarshak
 The ratio of India and Pakistan Air Forces during the conflict was 5: 1
 halanki yuddh main donon vayusenaayen samaan thim, kyonki china ke yuddh main pravesh karne kii sambhaavna se bachane ke liye adhiktar bhartiya vaayu sena purv kii ore tainaat thi
 Pakistani aircraft were mostly American, while India had a mixed fleet of Soviet and European aircraft
 aisa bahut prasaarit tha ki pakistan ke america vimaan bharat ke vimaanon se behatar hai, lekin kich visheshgyon ke anusaar yah sahi nahin tha kyonki bhartiya vaayu sena ke mig 21, hoker hunter or folland nait fiter kii parformens unke pratidwandvi pakistan ke F-86 saibar se behatar thi
 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha
 The Pakistan Air Force's F-104 Starfighter was the fastest flying fighter aircraft in the subcontinent at the time and was often called the "pride of the Pakistan Air Force"

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
