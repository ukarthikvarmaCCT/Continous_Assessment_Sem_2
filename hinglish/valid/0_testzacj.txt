 Salmon is a color given on the basis of the color of the flesh of a creature of the same name
 salmon Brajbuli is the name of the poetic language which the devout poets from the eastern regions of North India, namely, Mithila, Bengal, Assam and Orissa have predominantly used to describe Krishna's pastimes
 nepal main bhi brajabuli main likhe kuch kavy tathaa naatakagranth mili hai
 This poetic language has been used for centuries
 isvi san kii 15veen shatabdi se lekar 19veen shatabdi tak is kavyabhasha main likhe pad milte hai
 Although there has been a long tradition of "brajbuli literature", the use of the term "brajbuli" is found in the 19th century AD
 is shabd kaa prayog abhi tak keval bengali kavi ishwarchandra gupt kii rachana main hi mila he
 There is a lot of disagreement among scholars regarding the etymology of the word "brajbuli" and the origin of the Brajbuli language
 yahan ek baat ko spasht kar dena aavashyak he ki brajabuli, brajabhasha nahin he
 Both of them have different characteristics of grammar, in terms of linguistics it is accepted that Brajbuli is related to Brajbhasha
 brajabuli ke padon main brajabhasha ke shabdon kaa prayog adhik dekhne ko miltaa he
 Brajbuli originated from Avhath
 avahatth sambandhi thodi si jaankaree praapt kar lenaa aavashyak he
 Chronologically apabhramsa had become the language of literature, it can be called 'defined apabhramsa'
 yah parinishthit apbhransh uttar bharat main rajasthan se assam tak kavyabhasha kaa rup le chukaa tha
 But it should not be forgotten here that along with the development of Apabhramsa, the dialects of different regions were also developing and later on, literature was also composed in those dialects
 is prakaar parvarti apbhransh or vibhinn pradeshon kii viksit boliyon ke bich jo apbhransh kaa rup tha or jiskaa upyog sahitya rachana ke liye kiya gaya use hi avahatth kaha gaya he
 Dr
 Sunitikumar Chatterjee has told that besides the Shaurseni Apabhransh i
e
 undeveloped Madhya Pradesh, Bengal and other regions too had their lordship as poetic language
 yahan ek baat kii ore dhyaan dilaanaa aavashyak he ki yadhyapi avahatth kavyabhasha ke rup main grahan kiya gaya tha phir bhi yah swaabhaavik tha ki praant vishesh kii chhap usapar lagati, isiilie kavyabhasha hone par bhi vibhinn anchalon ke shabd, prakashanbhangi aadi ko ham usamen pratyaksh karte hai
 With regard to the etymology of the word "brajbuli" some have speculated that "brajavali Boli" was translated into "brajali Buli" and "brajali Buli" became "brajbuli"
 yah clisht kalpana he
 In fact, it seems more logical that Krishna's pastimes are described in this language, hence the association of Krishna's pastimes with "braj", this language would have been deemed "brajboli" which became "brajbuli" due to the uniqueness of Bengali's pronunciation
 would have gone
 brajabuli main likhe pad mithila, bengal, assam or odisha main paae gaye hai
 Brajbuli occupies a prominent place in Assamese literature
 assam kii brajabuli kii rachanaaon main asmi bhashaa kaa swabhaavat: sammishran he
 Among the Vaishnava devout poets of Assam is the predominance of slavery
 ve braj se adhik prabhavit the
 Devoted poets of Bengal and Odisha also have darshan bhavas at some places, but they have the predominance of sankhya and sweet sentiment
 bengal or urisa kaa vaishnav-shakti-sahitya radha or krishna kii lilaon se otprot he, lekin asmi ke brajabuli sahitya main radha kaa vaisaa sthaan nahin diya gaya he
 Radha is prominent in the posts of Vidyapati in Mithila
 brajabuli ke kuch naatak bhi mili hai lekin ye naatak keval nepal or assam main hi praapt hue he
 The plays of Brajbuli have not yet been found in Bengal or Orissa

 The life and literature of Assam had a profound influence on Shankar Dev and his followers
 brajabuli ko in logon ne apane prachaar kaa saadhan banaaya
 Rai Ramanand had a prominent place among the devout poets of Orissa
 ye urisa ke gajpati raja pratap rudra ke ek ucch adhikari the
 The description of the union of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Rai Ramananda by Krishnadasa Kaviraja of the Chaitanya sect in "chaitanya Charitamrit" shows that both were fully acquainted with the mysteries of sweet devotion
 urisa ke anya kaviyon main prataparudra, madhavidasi, raay champati ke naam aate hai
 Bengal has a large number of devout poets of the Gaudiya Vaishnava sect
 unamem kuch ke naam yon hai : yashoraj khan, murari gupt, vasudev ghosh, ramanand basu, dwij haridas, parmanandadaas, gyaandas, narottams, krishnadas kaviraj, govindraj kaviraj
 Rabindranath Thakur can be named as the last best poet of Brajbuli
 unki "bhanusingh thakurer padaavalee" san 1886 i

 The terms of Brajbuli are extremely sweet in terms of language and sentiment

 Many important scientific discoveries have been made with the help of Arceibo visionary - khagolashastra se sambandhit shabdaawalee Vedanta is a branch of Jnana Yoga that motivates a person towards the attainment of knowledge
 iskaa mukhya strot upanishad he jo veda grantho or aranyak granthon kaa saar samajhe jate hai
 The Upanishads are the last part of Vedic literature, hence it is called Vedanta
 karmkand or upasna kaa mukhyat: varnan mantra or brahmanon main he, gyaan kaa vivechan upanishdon main
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 veydant kii teen shakhaayen jo sabase zyada jaani jaati hai ve hai: advait veydant, vishisht advait or dwait
 Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Shri Madhwacharya, who are considered to be the promoters of these three branches respectively, besides these there are other branches of Gyan Yoga
 ye shakhaayen apane pravartakon ke naam se jaani jaati hai jinamein bhaskar, vallabh, chaitanya, nimbarak, vachaspati mishra, sureshwar or vigyaan bhikshu
 Among the major Vedantis that have taken place in modern times, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Arvind Ghosh, Swami Shivananda Raja Rammohan Roy and Raman Maharishi are notable
 ye aadhunik vichaarak advait veydant shakha kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The promoters of other Vedantos have also propagated their ideas well in India but they are little known outside India
 ‘veydant’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘vedon kaa ant’
 Initially, the word 'vedanta' was used for the Upanishads, but later on the principles of the Upanishads formed the basis, the word 'vedanta' started being used for those who developed it
 upanishdon ke liye 'veydant' shabd ke prayog ke praayah teen kaaran diye jate hai :- According to Acharya Udayveer Shastri, the term 'vedanta' refers to- upar kaha ja chukaa he ‘veydant’ shabd multah upanishdon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 We have many Upanishads related to different codes and their branches
 jinamein pramukh tathaa pracheen hai - ish, ken, kath, mundak, mandukya, taittiriya, aitarey, chaandogya tathaa brihadaaranyak
 There is a lot of similarity between the philosophical principles of these Upanishads, but there also seems to be opposition in many places
 kaalaantar main yah aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai ki virdohi prathit hone vaale vichaaron main samanvay sthapit kar sarvasammat upadeshon kaa sankalan kiya jaye
 To fulfill this need, Badarayana Vyasa composed the Brahmasutra which is also known as Vedanta Sutra, Shareerakasutra, Shareerakamimansa or Uttaraimamsa
 isamen upanishdon ke siddhanton ko atyant sankshep main, sutara rup main sankalit kiya gaya he
 Due to being too succinct, there is ambiguity in the formulas themselves and it is not possible to understand them without commentary or commentary
 isiilie anek bhashyakaron ne apane-apane bhashyon dwaara inke abhipraay ko spasht karne kaa praytn kiya kintu is spashtikaran main unka apana-apana drushtikon tha or isiliye unamem paryaapt matbhed he
 Each tried to prove that his commentary clarifies the true meaning of the Brahmasutras
 faltah sabhi bhashyakaar ek-ek veydant sampradaay ke pravartak ban gayi
 Prominent among them are Shankar's monotheism, Ramanuja's specificism, Madhva's dualism, Nimbark's dualism and Vallabh's puritanism
 in bhashyon ke anantar in bhashyon par tikaayen tathaa tikaaon par tikaaon kaa kram chalaa
 Many independent texts were also written to confirm the opinion of their community, due to which the literature of Vedanta became very large
 aitihaasik rup se kisi guru ke liye acharya banane / samajhe jane ke liye veydant kii pustakon par tikaayen yaa bhashya likhane padate hai
 These books include three important books, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gītā and the Brahmasutra, which are called Prasthanatrayi
 tadnusaar aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or madhwacharya teenon ne in teen mahatvapurn pustakon par vishisht rachanaayen di hai
 The ideas revealed in the three texts can be interpreted in many ways
 isi kaaran se brahm, jeev tathaa jagat ke sambandh main anek mat upasthit kiye gaye or is tarah veydant ke anek rupo kaa nirmaan hua tha | Gaudapada and his follower Adi Shankaracharya consider Brahma as the head and consider Jiva and Jagat as integral to him
 unke anusaar tatv ko utpatti or vinaash se rahit hona chahie
 The perishable world is non-existent, the living being is not the same as it appears
 jaagrath or swapnavasthaon main jeev jagat main rahata he parantu sushupti main jeev prapanch gyanshunya chetnavastha main rahata he
 This proves that the pure form of the organism should be like sushumpti
 sushupti avasthaa anitya he at: isse pare turiyavastha ko jeev kaa shuddh rup mana jaataa he
 In this state there is no relation with the mortal world and the organism does not have to enter the mortal world again
 yah turiyavastha abhyaas se praapt hoti he
 When the knowledge of impenetration arises in Brahma-jiva-jagat, the world becomes absorbed in Jiva and Jiva
 teenon main vaastavik abhed hone par bhi agyaan ke kaaran jeev jagat ko apane se pruthak samajhataa he
 But like the dream world, the awakened world is also a fantasy of an organism
 bhed itnaa hi he ki swapn vyaktigat kalpana kaa parinaam he jabaki jaagrath anubhav-samshti-gat mahakalpana kaa
 Falsehood is proved in both of them when they know the dream
 parantu baudhon kii tarah veydant main jeev ko jagat kaa ang hone ke kaaran mithyaa nahin mana jaataa
 a creature experiencing falsehood is the ultimate truth, if he believes it to be false, all knowledge has to be considered false
 parantu jis rup main jeev sansar main vyavhaar karata he uskaa vah rup avashya mithyaa he
 Zoroastrian state of consciousness is zero pure state
 gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa sambandh mithyaa sambandh he
 Beyond this, the organism attains its pure state of consciousness
 is avasthaa main bhed kaa lesh bhi nahin he kyonki bhed dwait main hota he
 This Advaita state is called Brahm
 tatv aseem hota he, yadi doosraa tatv bhi ho to pehle tatv kii seemaa ho jaaegi or simit ho jane se vah tatv buddhigamya hoga jisamen gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa bhed pratibhasith hone lagegaa
 Experience testifies that all known objects are mortal
 at: yadi ham tatv ko anshwar maanate hai to hamen use advay, agyeya, shuddh chaitanya maananaa hi hoga
 By assuming such an element, we have to explain the resplendent state of the world with the help of discourse
 rassi main pratibhasith honevaale sarp kii tarah yah jagat na to sat he, na asat he
 Had it been true, it would never have been destroyed, if it had been immaterial, there would have been no experience of happiness or sorrow
 at: sat asat se vilakshan anivarchaneey avasthaa hi vaastavik avasthaa ho sakati he
 This ignorance has been rendered by the Upanishads as Neti
 agyaan bhav rup he kyonki isse vastu ke astitv kii uplabdhi hoti he, yah abhaav rup he, kyonki iskaa vaastavik rup kuch bhi nahin he
 This ignorance is considered the cause of the world
 agyaan kaa brahm ke saath kya sambandh he, iskaa sahi uttar kathin he parantu brahm apane shuddh nirgun rup main agyaan virahit he, kisi tarah vah bhavabhaav vilakshan agyaan se aavrutt hokar sagun ishwar kahalaane lagata he or is tarah sristikram chaalu ho jaataa he
 God has knowledge of his pure form, but an organism has to be enlightened through cultivation to gain knowledge of his Brahman form
 guru ke mukh se 'tatvamasi' kaa upadesh sunakar jeev 'ahan brahmasmi' kaa anubhav karata he
 At that stage, one sees the whole world as soulful and the whole world in itself because at that time there is no element apart from it
 isi avasthaa ko turiyavastha yaa moksh kehete hai
 Ramanujacharya said contrary to Shankar's view that God is an independent element, but the living is also true, not false
 ye jeev ishwar ke saath sambhddha hai
 Their relation is also not due to ignorance, it is real
 moksh hone par bhi jeev kii swatantra satta rahati he
 The physical world and creatures are different in truth, but the truth of God is unique from their truth
 brahm purna he, jagat jad he, jeev agyaan or du:kha se ghira he
 These three together merge because the universe and the living entity are the bodies of Brahm and Brahma is their soul and destiny
 brahm se pruthak inkaa astitv nahin he, ye brahm kii seva karne ke liye hi hai
 In this philosophy, instead of advaita, the idea of plurality is there, but Brahma is an element that establishes unity among many
 bahutv se vishisht advay brahm kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran ise vishishtadvait kaha jaataa he
 Distinguished knowledge is considered impossible in the Vichitadvaita doctrine
 isiilie shankar kaa shuddh advay brahm is mat main grahya nahin he
 Brahma is special and its specialty is that all the sattva qualities are in it
 at: brahm vastav main shariri ishwar he
 All individual souls are true and it is from this that the body of Brahma is created
 ye brahm main, moksh hane par, leen nahin hotin; inkaa astitv akshunn bana rahata he
 In this way, Brahma is a formula for unity in diversity
 yahi brahm pralay kaal main sookshmbhoot or atmaaon ke saath kaaran rup main sthit rahata he parantu sristikaal main sookshm sthool rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 This work is called Brahm
 anant gyaan or anand se yukt brahm ko narayan kehete hai jo lakshmi ke saath baikunth main nivas karte hai
 One can reach near this Narayana by devotion
 sarvottam bhakthi narayan ke prasad se praapt hoti he or yah bhagavadgyanamay he
 There is no place of caste-varna distinction in the path of devotion
 sabake liye bhagwatprapti kaa yah rajmarg he
 Madhva propagated the dvaita Vedanta in which the five distinctions are considered to be the basis - Jiva God, Jiva Jiva, Jiva Jagatta, God Jagatta, Jagatta Jagatta
 inamen bhed swat: siddh he
 Without distinction the position of the object is impossible
 jagat or jeev ishwar se pruthak hai kintu ishwar dwaara niyantrit hai
 Saguna is the creator, guardian and destroyer of the world
 bhakthi se prasann honevaale ishwar ke ishaare par hi sristi kaa khel chalata he
 Although the creature is naturally enlightened and blissful, it has to suffer with the connection of body, mind, etc
 yah sansarg karmon ke parinamswaroop hota he
 The creature is a doer and a fruiter even if he is God-controlled
 ishwar main nity prem hi bhakthi he jisase jeev mukt hokar, ishwar ke sameep sthit hokar, anandbhog karata he
 The physical world is subordinate to God and by the will of God, it is situated in the gross and subtle state respectively in creation and holocaust
 ramanuj kii tarah madhv jeev or jagat ko brahm kaa sharir nahin maanate
 These are auto-located elements
 unamem paraspar bhed vaastavik he
 God only controls them
 is darshan main brahm jagat kaa nimitt kaaran he, prakruti upadan kaaran he
 The philosophy of Nimbark is highly influenced by Ramanuja
 jeev gyaan swaroop tathaa gyaan kaa aadhaar he
 Righteous-religion-sentiment or impersonal relationship is considered in life and knowledge
 yahi gyaata, karta or bhokta he
 Ishvara is the controller, devotee and witness of the creature
 bhakthi se gyaan kaa udai hone par sansar ke du:kha se mukt jeev ishwar kaa samipya praapt karata he
 The body of God is created from unnatural ghost and the world is created from natural ghost
 kaal teesraa bhoot mana gaya he
 Ishwar has been considered as Krishna Radha
 jeev or bhoot isi ke ang hai
 This is the reason for gratitude and good reason
 jeev-jagat tathaa ishwar main bhed bhi he abhed bhi he
 If the living world and God were one, then God would have to suffer like a living being
 yadi bhinn hote to ishwar sarvyaapee sarvantaratma kaise kehalaata? Brahma is an independent element in this opinion of Vallabh
 sachchidanand shrikrishna hi brahm hai or jeev tathaa jagat unke ansh hai
 He is an indecisive and great woman
 vah ek bhi he, naanaa bhi he
 He expresses himself with his will in various forms of life and world
 maaya uski shakti he jisi sahaayta se vah ek se anek hota he
 But many are not false
 shrikrishna se jeev-jagat kii swabhaavat: utpatti hoti he
 No disorder arises in Shri Krishna from this origin
 jeev-jagat tathaa ishwar kaa sambandh chinagaari aag kaa sabandh he
 Affection towards God is devotion
 sansaarik vastuon se vairaygy lekar ishwar main raag lagaana jeev kaa kartavya he
 This devotion is attainable only by the grace of God, being a devotee is not under the control of a living being
 ishwar jab prasann ho jate hai to jeev ko apane bheetar le lete hai yaa apane paas nitysukh kaa upbhog karne ke liye rakh lete hai
 This Bhakti Marg is also called Pushtimarga
 mahaprabhu chaitanya ke is sampradaay main anant gunanidhan, sachchidanand shrikrishna parabrahm maane gaye hai
 Brahm is impotent
 parantu apni shakti se vah jeev or jagat ke rup main aavirbhoot hota he
 They are different and integral with Brahm
 apane aapmen vah nimitt kaaran he parantu shakti se sampark hone ke kaaran vah upadan kaaran bhi he
 The creature is created by its neutral power and the world is created by Mayashakti
 jeev anant or anu rup hai
 They depend on God like the rays of the Sun
 sansar usee kaa prakaash he at: mithyaa nahin he
 Ignorance of the organism is destroyed in salvation, but the world remains
 sari abhilaashaaon ko chhodkar krishna kaa anusewan hi bhakthi he
 The real devotion is what is called Ruchi or Raganuga Bhakti, when the creature creeps into the veins of God in the path of Vedasastramanumodut
 radha kii bhakthi sarvotkrisht he
 In Vrindavan Dham, attaining Krishna's blissful love forever is salvation
 samachar patr yaa akhbaar, samaacharo par aadhaarit ek prakaashan he, jisamen mukhyat: samayik ghatnayen, raajnneeti, khel-kud, vyaktitv, vigyaapan ityadi jaankariyaan saste kaagaj par chhapi hoti he
 Newspapers have an important place in the means of communication
 samachaarpatr praayah dainik hote hai lekin kuch samachar patr saptahik, pakshik, masik evam chamahi bhi hoten hai
 Most newspapers focus on local languages and local subjects
 sabase pehla gyaat samachaarpatr 59 i

 History and Contribution of Newspaper: Although a newspaper is considered as a beginning by a former officer of British rule, but its form was not like that of newspapers
 vah keval ek panne kaa suchanaatmak parchaa tha
 The Purnarupen newspaper was brought out of Bengal by Viceroy Hickey under the name of 'bengal-gazette'
 aarambh main angrejon ne apane phaayde ke liye akhabaaron kaa istemaal kiya, chunki saare akhbaar angreji main hi nikal rahe the, isliye bahusankhyak logon tak khabaren or suchnaayen pahunch nahin paati thim
 The news that came out and passed through the system, used to spread its terror there
 unke khilaaf na to mukademe hote or na hi unhen koi dand hi diya jaataa tha
 People were silent despite facing these hellish circumstances
 is dauraan bharat main ‘da hindustan times’, ‘neshnal herald', 'pyniyar', 'mumbai-mirar' jaise akhbaar angreji main nikalate the, jisamen un atyaacharon kaa dur-dur tak ullekh nahin rahata tha
 In addition to these English papers, letters were published in Bangla, Urdu etc
 but the scope was limited
 use koi bengali padhane vaala yaa urdu jaanane vaala hi samaj saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the first issue of Hindi's first letter 'udant Martand' was published on 30 May 1826
 yah patr saptahik tha
 The introduction of 'udant-martand' attempted to tie people together at the linguistic level
 yah keval ek patr nahin tha, balki un hajaaron logon kii jubaan tha, jo ab tak khamosh or bhaybheet the
 The introduction of letters in Hindi led to a revolutionary change in the country and the war of independence
 unhen kaaphi tod-marodakar prastut kiya jaataa tha, taaki angreji sarkaar ke atyaacharon kii khabaren dabi rah jaaen
 British soldiers entered any area and behaved arbitrarily
 lut, hatya, balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen aam hoti thim
 Whichever area he found a new direction
 ab logon tak desh ke kone-cone main ghat rahi ghatnaon kii jaankaree pahunchne lagi
 But shortly after, Jugal Kishore, the editor of this letter, had to close the letter on 11 December 1827 for lack of assistance
 10 may 1829 ko bengal se hindi akhbaar 'bangadoot' kaa prakaashan hua
 This letter also became the voice of the people and a medium to keep them connected
 iske baad july, 1854 main shyamsundar sen ne kalakatta se ‘samachar sudhaa varshan’ kaa prakaashan kiya
 During that time, any newspaper or newspaper published any news or article against the British Government, it had to pay its price
 akhabaaron ko pratibandhit kar diya jaataa tha
 Its copies were burnt, its publishers, editors, writers were punished
 un par baari-bharkam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa tha, taaki wo dubaara phir uthne kii himmat na juta paaen
 As the wave of independence was spreading across the country, newspapers were also becoming more and more tolerant of atrocities
 yahi vajah thi ki bengal vibhaajan ke uparaant hindi patron kii aawaaj or buland ho gai
 Lokmanya Tilak edited 'kesari' and Lala Lajpat Rai took out the letter 'vande Mataram' from Punjab
 in patron ne yuvaaon ko aazaadee kii ladaai main adhik-se-adhik sahyog dene kaa aahvaan kiya
 These letters created a passion for independence
 ‘kesari’ ko nagpur se madhavrao sapre ne nikaala, lekin tilak ke uttejk lekhon ke kaaran is patr par pabandi laga di gai
 Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi started publishing the weekly letter 'pratap' from Kanpur in 1913 to revive the freedom struggle in North India
 isamen desh ke har hisse main ho rahe atyaacharon ke bare main jaankariyaan prakashit hoti thim
 This triggered outrage among the people and they were even more excited to overthrow the British rule
 isaki aakraamakata ko dekhte hue angrej prashasan ne iske lekhakon, sampadakon ko tarah-tarah kii pratadnaayen deen, lekin yah patr apane lakshya par data rahaa
 Similarly, letters were being published from the areas of Bengal, Bihar and Maharashtra
 un patron ne logon main swatantraaa ko paane kii lalak or jaagrukta failaane kaa prayaas kiya
 If it is said that these newspapers were not inferior to any weapon for freedom fighters, then there would be no exaggeration
 akhbaar bane aazaadee kaa hathiyaar press aaj jitna swatantra or mukhar dikhataa he, aazaadee kii jang main yah utani hi bandishon or paabandiyon se bandhaa hua tha
 Neither was there a form of entertainment in it nor was it a source of income
 ye akhbaar or patr-patrikas aazaadee ke jaanbaajon kaa ek hathiyaar or madhyam the, jo unhen logon or ghatnaon se jode rakhata tha
 There was no such warrior of the freedom struggle, who did not try to speak through the newspapers
 gandhiji ne bhi ‘harijan’, ‘yang-india’ ke naam se akhabaaron kaa prakaashan kiya tha to moulana abul kalam aaazaad ne 'al-hilaal' patr kaa prakaashan
 There are many other examples that prove that newspapers and magazines had an important role in the freedom struggle
 yah vah daur tha, jab logon ke paas samvaad kaa koi saadhan nahin tha
 Even then, the helpless people who were victims of the atrocities of the British used to bear all the atrocities silently
 na to koi unki sunne vaala tha or na unke du:khon ko harne vaala
 Even if they used to say to whom and how? Everyone was facing the same torture
 aise main patr-patrikaon kii shuruyaat ne logon ko himmat di, unhen dhanjhas bandhaaya
 This was the reason that every article of the revolutionaries used to communicate new vigor and patriotism in the public
 bhaaratendu kaa naatak ‘bharat-durdasha’ jab prakashit hua tha to logon ko yah anubhav hua tha ki bharat ke log kaise daur se guzar rahe hai or angrejon kii manshaa kya he
 Pahang is a state in Malaysia

 It is almost equal to the area of kerala state in India for comparison

 Cancer can affect all animals
 lagbhag sabhi karkat roopantarit koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth main asaamanyataon ke kaaran hote hai
 These abnormalities can be caused by carcinogens or carcinogens such as tobacco smoking, radiation, chemicals, or infectious factors
 Other genetic abnormalities that cause cancer may sometimes be due to an error in DNA cancer replication, or may be inherited genetically and thus present in all cells since birth
 karkat kii anuvanshikta saamanyatya carcinogen or poshak ke jinom ke bich jatil antarkriya se prabhavit hoti he
 Newer aspects of genetics of cancer pathogenesis such as DNA methylation and micrornas are increasingly gaining importance
 karkat main pai jane vaali anuvanshik asaamanyataayen aamtaur par jin ke do saamaanya virgon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Cancer-promoting tumors are typically active in cancer cells, giving new properties to those cells, such as increased growth and division than normal, protection from programmed cell death, lack of normal tissue limits, and diverse tissue environments
 Ability to be installed
 iske baad gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin karkat kii koshikaon main niskriy ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop un koshikaon kii saamaanya kriyaaon main kami aa jaati he, jaise sahi DNA pratikruti, koshika chakra par niyantran, utakon ke bheetar abhivinyas or aasanjan or pratiraksha tantra kii surakshatmak koshikaon ke saath parsparik kriya
 Typically, a pathologist has to undergo a histological examination of a tissue biopsy specimen to diagnose it, although early signs of malignancy may be signs of radiation-visual deprivation
 adhikansh karkat rogon kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he, kuch ko thik bhi kiya ja saktaa he, yah karkat ke vishesh prakaar, sthiti or avasthaa par nirbhar karata he
 Once diagnosed, cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy

 Significant progress has been made in the development of targeted therapy drugs that act exclusively on investigational molecular abnormalities in the specific knot and minimize damage in normal cells
 karkat ke rogiyon kaa purv nidaan karkat ke prakaar se bahut adhik prabhavit hota he, saath hi rog kii avasthaa or seemaa kaa bhi is par prabhaav padataa he
 In addition, histological classification and the presence of specific molecular markers can also be helpful in pre-diagnosis of disease and in determining individual treatment
 nimnlikhit nikat sambandhit shabdon kaa upyog asaamaanya vruddhi ko namit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: In current English, though, the term is synonymous with tumor, neoplasm, especially solid neoplasm
 dhyaan den ki kuch nioplasm, jaise rakt karkat, gaanth kaa nirmaan nahin karte hai
 The following words can be used to describe a cancer
 cancer ke 100 se adhik prakaar hai
 The type of cancer is usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancer begins, but they are also known as the type of cells from which they are made
 
 Bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia cancer cancer karkat ko koshika ke prakaar ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he jo gaanth se samanta rakhti he, isiilie, utak ko gaanth se utpann mana ja saktaa he
 These are tissue science and place respectively
 saamaanya shrenee ke udaahranon main shaamil hai: Most of these bales are common in children

 For example, liver cancer is called hepatocarcinoma; Cancer of fat cells is called liposarcoma
 aam canceron ke liye, ang ke angreji naam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma of the breast or memory ductal carcinoma
 yahan par visheshan dakatal kaa upyog sookshmdarshi main dikhaayi dene vaale us karkat ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jo saamaanya stan kii vahiniyon se samanta rakhti hai
 The term duct has been used to refer to the cancer of the breast vessels seen in a microscope
 saumy gaanth unke naam main -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen mul shabd ang kaa naam hota he
 For example, a benign knot of the smooth muscle of the uterus is called a leiomyoma
 
durbhaagya se, kuch tarah ke canceron ke liye bhi -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise melanoma or seminoma
 Broadly, the symptoms of cancer can be divided into three groups: yadhyapi viksit ho chuke karkat main dard ho saktaa he, aksar yah praarambhik lakshan nahin hota he
 Each of the symptoms in the above list can be caused by a variety of conditions
 Cuttack can be a common or unusual cause for each item
 karkat bhinn rogon kaa ek varg he jo apane kaarnon or jaev-vigyaan main vyapak bhinnata rakhte hai
 Cancer can occur in any organism, even plants
 lagbhag sabhi karkat cancer dhire dhire badhate hai, karkat or cancer kii koshikaon or isaki putree koshikaon main truti utpann ho jaati he 
 Anything that replicates may possibly suffer from errors
 If error correction and prevention is not done properly, errors will persist and can also be transferred to daughter cells
 aam taur par, sharir kai vidhiyon ke madhyam se karkat ke khilaaf bachane kii koshish karata he, jaise: apoptosis, sahaayak anu, sambhavtah jeernata aadi
 However these error correction methods often fail in small ways, especially in environments where errors are more likely to occur and increase
 udhaaharan ke liye, aise vaataaran main vighatnkaaree tatv shaamil ho sakate hai jo carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Or periodic injury, or environments in which cells have not developed for their survival, such as hypoxia
 is prakaar se karkat ek pragatisheel rog he or ye pragatisheel trutiyaan dhire dhire koshika main sanchit hoti rahati hai jab tak jantu main upasthit koshika apane kaaryon ke vipareet kaary nahin karne lagati
 Errors that cause constriction are often self-amplifying, eventually increasing at an exponential rate
 udhaaharan ke liye: Thus, the sputum often explodes as a chain reaction due to some errors, these errors combined make more serious errors
 aisi trutiyaan jo adhik trutiyaan utpann karti hai, ve prabhavi rup se karkat kaa mul kaaran hai or saath hi, ye is baat kaa kaaran bhi hai ki karkat kaa upachaar bahut mushkil he: chaahe karkat kii 10,000,000,000 koshikaon main se sab ko maar dene ke baad, unamem se keval 10 koshikaayen apni pratikruti kar sakati hai yaa truti utpann karne vaale sanketon ko anya koshikaon ko bhej sakati hai to prakriya phir se shuru ho jaati he
 This rebellion-like scenario is the survival of the undesirable, where evolutionary forces themselves work against the design and system of the body
 vastav main, ek baar jab karkat viksit hona shuru ho jaataa he, yahi bal nirantar adhik aakraamak avasthaaon kii ore karkat kii pragati main sahaayak hota he, ore yah chlonal vikaas kehalaata he
 Research about the causes of cancer often falls into the following categories: karkat rog janan kaa kaaran he DNA utparivartan jo koshika vruddhi or metastasis ko prabhavit karata he
 The substances that cause DNA mutation are called mutagens and those mutations that cause cancer are called carcinogens
 kai vishesh prakaar ke padaarth vishisht prakaar ke vikshepse jude hue hai
 Tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer, and is the cause of 90% of lung cancers
 lambe samay tak esbestus fibre ke sampark main rahane se mizothelioma ho saktaa he
 Many mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens
 alcohol ek rasinic carcinogen kaa udhaaharan he jo utparivartajan nahin he
 Such chemicals promote cancer by stimulating the rate of cell division
 pratikruti kii tej dar anzimon kii marammat ke liye kam samay detii he jisase DNA pratikruti ke dauraan kshatigrast DNA kii marammat ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil pataa he, jiske kaaran ek utparivartan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Several decades of research demonstrate the relationship between tobacco use and pleural, vocal, head, neck, gastric, bladder, renal, pharyngeal, and pancreatic cancers
 tambaaku dhumrapaan main nitrosemine or bahuchakree hydrocarbon sahit pachaas gyaat carcinogen paae jate hai tambaaku viksit duniya main teen main se ek cancer mrityu ke liye uttaradaayi he, or duniya bhar main lagbhag paanch main se ek mrityu ke liye
 Indeed, the pulmonary cancer mortality rate in the United States mirrors the pattern of smoking, according to which an increase in smoking leads to an increase in pleural cancer mortality and more recently demonstrated that a decrease in smoking in men There is also a decrease in pleural cancer mortality
 haalanki, duniya bhar main abhi bhi dhumrapan karne waalon kii sankhya bad rahi he, kuch sanghathanon ke dwaara iske kaaran utpann vaali sthiti ko tambaaku mahamari ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Sources of ionizing radiation, such as radon gas, can cause cancer
 surya ke parabangnee vikiran ke lambey samay tak sampark main rahane se melanoma or anya twachaa durdamataayen ho sakati hai
 Non-ionizing frequency radiations emanating from mobile phones and other sources have also been considered to cause cancer, but there is little evidence of such a relationship
 phir bhi kuch visheshgy ehtiyaati siddhant ke aadhaar par lambe samay tak ansi chizon ke sampark main rahane se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Some cancer can be caused by infection with the pathogen
 kai cancer ek virus ke sankraman ke kaaran hote hai; yah vishesh rup se jantuon jaise pakshiyon main dekha jaataa he, lekin manushyon main bhi aisa hota he, puri duniya main 15% maanav cancer ke liye virus hi jimmedaar hai
 The main viruses related to human cancer are human papilloma virus, hepatitis b and hepatitis c virus, epstein-barr virus and human T-lymphotropic virus
 praayogic or mahamari aankde virus kii ek kaarak bhoomika kaa sanket dete hai or ve maanav main cancer ke vikaas ke liye duusare sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak ke rup main saamne aaye hai, jabaki pehla kaarak tambaaku kaa upyog he
 Virus-induced lumps can be divided into two types, those that convert rapidly and those that convert slowly
 tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virason main virus ek atisakriy onkosin ko samvaahit karata he jise viral-onkosin kaha jaataa he or sankramit koshika v-onc kii abhivyakti ke saath tunrat hi roopantarit ho jaati he
 Conversely, in a slowly mutating virus, the virus genome inserts into the genome of the host near a proto-oncogene
 ab viral pravartak yaa anya pratilekhan viniman tatv us proto-onkosin kii ati-abhivyakti kaa kaaran banate hai
 It involves uncontrolled cell division
 kyonki pravishti kaa sthaan proto-onkosin ke liye vishisht nahin hota he or kisi bhi proto-onkosin ke paas pravishti kii sambhaavna kam hoti he, dhimi gati se roopantarit hone vaale virus, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virus kii tulana main, sankraman ke adhik lambe samay ke baad gaanth paidaa karte hai
 The hepatitis virus, including hepatitis b and hepatitis C, can induce a long-term viral infection, which causes liver cancer in 0
47% of hepatitis b patients annually and 1
4% of hepatitis c patients per year
 liver serosis, chaahe chronic viral hepatitis sankraman ke kaaran ho yaa sharaab pine ke kaaran, yah yakrut cancer ke vikaas se sambandhit hota he or serosis or viral hepatitis kaa sangyojan yakrut cancer vikaas ke ucchtam jokhim kaa kaaran he
 Due to the transmission of viral hepatitis worldwide and the heavy burden of disease, liver cancer is one of the most common and most fatal cancers
 cancer anusandhan main aadhunikeekaran ne cancer ko rokane ke liye ek vexine ko dizin kiya he
 In 2006, U

 The Advisory Committee on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunization procedures officially advised that girls aged 11–12 should be vaccinated and pointed out that women from the age of 9 to girls up to the age of 26 are immune
 Are eligible for ie they can be vaccinated
 virus ke alaava, shodhakartaaon ne jeevanu or kuch vishesh prakaar ke karkat ke bich sambandh paaya he
 The most prominent example is the relationship between chronic cancer of the stomach and Helicobacter pylori of the stomach wall
 Although Helicobacter pylori infection develops in very rare cases, as this pathogen is very common, it is probably responsible for most of this type of cancer
 isi prakaar se kuch hormone gaiyr-utparivartajanik karsinogence kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, ve atirikt koshika vruddhi ko uttejit kar sakate hai
 a good example is the role of hyper estrogenic states in developing cancer of the endometrium
 HIV kai prakaar kii durdamataaon se sambandhit he jisamen shaamil he kaposi sarcoma, gaiyr-hojakins limphoma or HPV -sambandhit durdamataayen jaise guda cancer or garbhashay greeva kaa karkat 
 AIDS - ko paribhaashit karne vaali bimariyon main lambe samay se ye nidaan shaamil hai
 The increased incidence of malignancy in HIV patients points to the breakdown of immune surveillance as a possible etiology of cancer
 anya vishisht pratiraksha kii kami kii avasthaaen bhi durdamata ke jokhim ke badhane se sambandhit hai
 Most forms of cancer are radiated, meaning they have no genetic cause
 haalanki, aise kai syndrome hai jinamein cancer ke liye anuvaanshik rup se praapt purv pravriti yaa vishesh sugrahyata hoti he, aisa aksar ek jin main dosha ke kaaran hota he jo gaanth ke nirmaan ke viruddh raksha karata he
 Famous examples are: garbhadhaaran ke saath or keval ek seemaant rup main kuch ang daataaon ke saath is rog kaa sancharan kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he, anyathaa cancer samanyatya ek sankramak rog nahin he
 The main reason for this is tissue tissue graft rejection due to major tissue homology complex incompatibility or incompatibility
 In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells, as these antigens are different in each individual
 jab gaiyr swa pratijanon kaa saamana hota he, to pratiraksha tantra upyukt koshika ke khilaaf pratikriya karata he
 Such reactions protect against knot cell grafting by destroying transplanted cells
 In the United States, malignancy is found in approximately 3500 pregnant women annually, transmission of acute blood cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and carcinoma from mother to fetus via placenta
 Has been seen ang pratyaropan ke dwaara daata se vyutpann gaanth bahut kam paayi jaati he
 The main cause of the knot related to organ transplantation is Durdam melanoma, which was not known at the time of removal of the organ, although other cases were present
 vastav main, ek jeev se cancer aamtaur par usee prajati ke duusare jeev main tabhi vruddhi karata he jab un donon main samaan utak asangati ke jin hon, chuhon kaa upyog karke aisa siddh kiya gaya he; haalanki upar varnit sthiti ke alaava vaastavik duniya main aisa kabhi nahin hota he
 Some types of cancer have been found in organisms other than humans, which are caused by transmission of knot cells themselves
 yah ghatana stikar sarcoma se yukt kutton main dekhi gayi he, jo kenayan transmicible veneral tumor or tasmanian devil main devil chehre ke tumor kii beemaari ke rup main bhi jaani jaati he
 Cancer is basically a disease regulating tissue development
 ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye, koshika vruddhi or vibhedan ko niyamit karne vaale jeenon main roopantaran hona chahie
 Genetic changes can occur at many levels, as an advantage or disadvantage of the whole chromosome, which is a form of mutation and only affects DNA nucleotides
 jin kii do vyapak shreniyan hai, jo in parivartanon se prabhavit hoti hai
 Oncogenes may be normal genes, which appear at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties
 kisi bhi maamle main, in jeenon kii abhivyakti cancer kii koshikaon ke durdam lakshan praaroop ko badhaava detii he
 Lump suppressor genes are genes that inhibit the cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin aksar cancer ko badhaava dene vaale anuvanshik parivartanon ke dwaara aksham ho jate hai
 Typically, many genes need to be transformed to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell
 vibhinn jinomik parivartanon ke liye ek vividh vargeekaran yojana he, jo cancer koshikaon ke utpaadan main yogadan kar sakati he
 Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in nucleotide sequencing of genomic DNA
 anyuploidi, gunasutron kii ek asaamaanya sankhya kii upasthiti, ek jinomik parivartan he, jo ek utparivartan nahin he or isamen samasutri vibhaajan main truti ke dwaara ek yaa adhik gunasutron kaa laabh yaa haani shaamil ho sakati he
 Large-scale mutations include damage or growth of a part of a chromosome
 Genomic amplification occurs when a cell acquires multiple copies of a small chromosomal locus, typically containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material
 sthanikaran tab hota he jab do alag alag gunasutri kshetra asaamaanya rup se, ek vishisht sthaan par sangalit ho jate hai
 a well-known example of this is the localization of the Philadelphia chromosome or chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in acute marrow-induced blood cancers, resulting in the production of the bcr-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase
 chote paimaane ke utparivartanon main shaamil hai bindu utparivartan, kami yaa badhotari, jo ek jin ke pravartak main ho sakati he, yah isaki abhivyakti ko prabhavit karti he
 Or can occur in the sequence coding of a gene and alter the stability or function of its protein product
 ekmaatr jin kaa vighatan, ek DNA virus yaa ritro virus se jinomik saamagree ke ekikaran ke parinamswarup ho saktaa he or is prakaar kii ghatana ke parinamswaroop prabhavit koshika or uski santati main viral onkosin kii abhivyakti ho sakati he
 Over-genetics is the study of the regulation of gene expression through chemical, non-mutagenic changes in DNA architecture
 cancer rogajanan main adhi-anuvaanshiki kaa siddhant he ki DNA main gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartan jin abhivyakti main parivartan kar dete hai
 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive
 cancer anusandhan main paribhaashit kiye jane vaale pehle onkoseenon main se ek he raas onkosin
aadya-onkosin ke raas parivaar main utparivartan bahut aam hai, ye sabhi maanav ganthon ke 20% se 30% main paae jate hai
 Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised to find that it not only had this gene presence in the human genome, but was also linked to a catalytic control element that induced cancer in cell line culture

 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaala jin prachurodabhavan virdohi sanketon or proteinon ke liye anukoden karata he, jo samasutri vibhaajan or koshika vruddhi kaa shaman kar dete hai
 In general, knot suppressor genes are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage
 aksar DNA kshati ke kaaran mukt-utplavi anuvanshik padaarth kii upasthiti or saath hi anya lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai, jo aise anzimon or maarg ko prerit karte hai jo gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke sakriyan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors
 gaanth ke prakaar gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale utparivartan ke prayek prakaar ke liye praroopik hote hai, kuch utparivartan vishesh prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai, jabaki anya utparivartan anya prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai
 The type of inheritance of a mutant tumor sedative is that an effective member inherits a defective copy from one parent and the normal copy from another parent
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vyakti jo ek utparivarti p53 elil ko vanshaagat rup se praapt karata he vah melanoma or agnashyi cancer viksit kar saktaa he jo lee-frameni syndrome kehalaata he
 Other hereditary knot suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations related to retino blastoma and APC gene mutations associated with adenopolyposis large intestine cancer
 Adenopolyposis large intestine cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in the large intestine in childhood, which is relatively Produce cancer of the large intestine at an early age
 ant main, BRCA1 or BRCA2 main vanshaagat utparivartan stan cancer kii praarambhik shuruyaat kaa kaaran banate hai
 In 1971, it was proposed that the development of cancer depends on at least two mutation events
 nudsan kii do chot kii pariklpana ke anusaar ek gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin main ek vanshaagat janan str utparivartan cancer ko keval tabhi utpann karegaa jab jeev ke jivan main baad main koi anya utparivartan ghatit hota he, yah us gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke anya elil ko niskriy kar degaa
 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
 nudsan ke do chot ke modal ko haal hi main kai jaanchakartaaon dwaara chunauti di gai he
 Deactivation of one allele of some genes that suppress the knot is sufficient to produce a tumor
 yah ghatana agunit aparyaaptta kehalaati he or ise kai prayogtmak drushtikonon ke dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The onset of a knot resulting from haploid insufficiency is usually late, when it is compared to a two-injury process
 aksar, bahul anuvanshik parivartan jinka parinaam cancer hota he, unhen sanchit hone main kai saal lag sakate hai
 During this time, the biological behavior of pre-malignancy cells gradually changes from normal cell to cancer cell
 sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se purv durdam utak main vibhedak gun dekhe ja sakate hai
 Differential features include increased number of dividing cells, variation in nucleus size and shape, differentiation in cell size and shape, decrease in the properties of specialized cells and loss of normal tissue organization
 Dyspepsia is an unusual type of extra-cell proliferative building that is reflected by normal tissue system and loss of cell structure in pre-malignant cells
 ye praarambhik arbudeey parivartan ativardhan se vibhedit kiye jane chahiyein, jo ek bahari uddipan ke kaaran koshika vibhaajan main ek utparivarti vruddhi he, jaise hormoni asantulan yaa puraani jalan
 The most severe cases of malignancy are called "in situ carcinoma"
 latin main, "swasthani " shabd kaa arth he "sthaan main", isliye carcinoma swasthani shabd kaa arth he koshikaon kii aniyantrit vruddhi jo apane mul sthaan par hi bani rahati he or jisane anya utakon par koi akraman nahin darshaya he
 Nevertheless, carcinoma in situ can develop into an aggressive malignancy and is usually removed by surgery if possible
 jis tarah se jaanwaron kii aabaadi main vikaas hota he, thik usee tarah koshikaon kii aniyantrit aabaadi main bhi vikaas hota he
 This undesirable process is called somatic development and in this way cancer arises and becomes more painful
 koshikeey upaapachay main adhikansh parivartan jo koshika main aniyamit tareeke se vibhaajan kaa kaaran hai, ve koshika mrityu kaa kaaran hote hai
 However once the cancer starts, the cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: some cells with new genetic changes that multiply continuously to promote their life and reproduction and develop quickly
 The knot becomes dominant, as cells with less adapted genetic changes are out of competition
 isi prakaar se MRSA jaise rogajanak pratijaivik-pratirodhi ban jate hai or yahi kaaran he ki fasalon ke blit or keet kitnashak pratirodhi ban jate hai
 Due to this development, cancer recurrence consists of cells that acquire resistance to cancer drugs

 Radiation therapy can be controlled externally by external ray radiotherapy or can be controlled internally through brachytherapy
 vikiran chikitsa kaa prabhaav sthanikrut hota he or chikitsa kiye jane vaale kshetra tak hi simit rahata he
 Radiation therapy damages or destroys the cells of the area to be treated, in this action the genetic material of these cells is destroyed to prevent further division and growth in the cells
 And destroy both normal cells, most normal cells recover from the effects of radiation and begin to function properly Are
 vikiran chikitsa kaa lakshya he adhik se adhik cancer koshikaon ko nasht karnaa, jabaki aas-paas ke swasth utakon ko hone vaale nuksaan ko simit karnaa
 Therefore, it is given in many parts, which gives healthy tissues a chance to recover in the intervening period

 Therefore, the cook has the potential to damage healthy tissues, especially tissues that have a high replacement rate
 These cells usually repair themselves after the surgery
 kyonki kuch dawaaen akele kii tulana main ek saath behatar kaary karti hai, isliye ek hi samay par do yaa adhik dawaaen di jaati hai
 This is called "combination cookery"; Most cook regimen regimens are given in combination only
 kuch prakaar ke leukemia or lasicarbud ke upachaar ke liye chemotherapy kii ucch khuraaq kii yaa puure sharir ke vikirnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This treatment separates the bone marrow and hence the ability of the body to recover and reconstitute blood is severed

 anek bhashaaon ke gyaata tathaa pragatisheel vichaardhaara ke sahityakar nagarjun ne hindi ke atirikt maithili sanskrit evam bangla main moulik rachanaayen bhi kin tathaa sanskrit, maithili evam bangla se anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Nagarjuna, conferred with the Sahitya Akademi Award, wrote in Maithili under the passenger surname and the surname was merged with his original name Vaidyanath Mishra
 nagarjun kaa janm 1911 i0 kii jyeshtha poornima ko vartmaan madhubani jile ke satlakha main hua tha
 This was his infancy
 unka paitruk gaanv vartmaan darbhanga jile kaa tarauni tha
 His father's name was Gokul Mishra and mother's name was Uma Devi
 nagarjun ke bachapan kaa naam 'thakkan misar' tha
 Actually the thing was that Gokul Mishra and Uma Devi had four children continuously and they all died untimely
 santan na jeene ke kaaran gokul mishra ati nirashapurna jivan main rah rahe the
 Uneducated Brahmin Gokul Mishra was naturally loyal to God, but those days he started worshiping his adorable Lord Shankar Lord more and more
 vaidyanath dham jaakar baba vaidyanath kii unhone yathashakti upasna kii or vahaan se lautne ke baad ghar main puja-paath main bhi samay lagane lage
 "then, when the fifth child was born, there was also a fear in the mind that like the four children, this too would be cheated and settled in some time
 atah ise 'thakkan' kaha jane laga
 After a long time, this Thakkan was named and after the grace and blessings of Baba Vaidyanath, this child was named Vaidyanath Mishra
 " Gokul Mishra's financial condition was not good
 ve kaam-dham kuch karte nahin the
 All the land was given on the share and when difficulties arose due to reduced yield, they were tempted to sell the land
 jameen bechakar kai prakaar kii galat aadaten paal rakhi thim
 At the last moment of his life, Gokul Mishra left only three kattas of fertile land and almost the same habitat for his successor, that too with interest
 bahut baad main nagarjun danpati ne use chhudaaya
 In such a family situation, child Vaidyanath Mishra grew up
 chah varsh kii aayu main hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya
 His father used to sit with his only motherless son on his shoulder and used to visit this village - that village

 "the stroller molecule, which entered the body during childhood itself, developed and strengthened like composition and religion
 " The early education of Vaidyanath Mishra started with the help of small principles Kaumudi and Amarkosh in the above family situation

 At this age, child Vaidyanath saw many villages in Mithilanchal

 As a Buddhist he considered Rahul Sankrityayan as the pioneer

 Rahul and Nagarjuna are 'guru Bhai'

 He also participated in the peasant movement of Champaran

 Participating in the JP movement in April 1974, he said, "A public war is going on against the evils of the establishment, in which my participation is not only of speech but of karma, that's why i am on hunger strike today, tomorrow also in jail
" i can go " or sachmuch is andolan ke silsile main apat sthiti se purv hi inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or phir kaaphi samay jail main rahanaa padaa
 In 1948, for the first time, Nagarjuna suffered from an asthma attack and then he suffered from time to time due to lack of proper treatment
 do putriyon evam chaar putron se bhare-puure parivaar vaale nagarjun kabhi garhasthya dharm thik se nahin nibhaa paye or is bhare-puure parivaar ke paas achal sampatti ke rup main viraasat main mili vahi teen kattha upjau tathaa praayah utani hi vaas-bhoomi rah gayi
 Nagarjuna's real name was Vaidyanath Mishra, but in Hindi literature, he composed compositions in Nagarjuna and Maithili with the traveler surname
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone 'vaideh' upnaam se bhi kavitaayen likhi thim
 In 1936, he took the name 'nagarjuna' in 'vidyalankar Pariven' in Sinhala
 aarambh main unki hindi kavitaayen bhi 'yatri' ke naam se hi chhapi thim
 In fact, after 1941 AD, at the request of some friends, he had decided not to write in Hindi by any name other than Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kii pehali prakashit rachana ek maithili kavita thi jo 1929 i0 main laheriasarai, darbhanga se prakashit 'mithila' naamak patrika main chhapi thi
 His first Hindi work was a poem called 'ram ke Prati' which appeared in the weekly 'vishwabandhu' originating from Lahore in 1934

 Poetry, novels, story, memoirs, travelogues, essays, children's literature - he used pen in all genres
 maithili evam sanskrit ke atirikt bangla se bhi ve jude rahe
 Nagarjuna's attachment to Bengali language and literature was there from the very beginning
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone apane chaatr jivan main bangla sahitya ko mul bangla main padhanaa shuru kiya
 Originally writing poetry started in February 1978, and by September 1979, about 50 poems had been written
 kuch rachanaayen banglaa kii patr-patrikaon main bhi chhapin
 Some were published in Hindi short magazines including transliteration and translation
 moulik rachana ke atirikt unhone sanskrit, maithili or bangla se anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Kalidas was his most loved poet and 'meghdoot' favorite book
 meghdoot kaa muktchand main anuwaad unhone 1953 i0 main kiya tha
 He had done the praises of Jayadev's 'geet Govind' only in 1948 AD
 vastutah 1944 or 1954 i0 ke bich nagarjun ne anuwaad kaa kaaphi kaam kiya
 a Hindi translation of several novels and stories of the Bengali novelist Sharat Chandra was also published
 kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi ke upanyaas 'prithveevallabh' kaa gujarati se hindi main anuwaad 1945 i0 main kiya tha
 In 1965, he had praised Vidyapati's hundred songs
 baad main vidyapati ke or geeton kaa bhi unhone anuwaad kiya

 aasmaan main chandaa taire -1982 i Military Old Horse - 1997 nagarjun ke kavy main ab tak kii puri bhartiya kavy-parampara hi jeevant rup main upasthit dekhi ja sakati he
 His poet-personality, Kalidas and Vidyapati, many of the classic poets - deep exploration of the world, practical followings of multi-faceted philosophies such as Buddhism and Marxism and above all a deep connection to the problems, concerns and struggles of our time and environment, and deep recognition of folk culture and folklore
 Is made from unka ‘yatripan’ bhartiya maanas evam vishay-vastu ko samgr or sachche rup main samajhane kaa saadhan rahaa he
 Apart from Maithili, Hindi and Sanskrit, knowledge of many languages like Pali, Prakrit, Bangla, Sinhalese, Tibetan etc
 has also been helpful for them in this purpose
 unka gatisheel, sakriy or patibaddh sudeergh jivan unke kavy main jeevant rup se pratidhwanit-pratibimbit he
 Nagarjuna is a modern poet in the true sense of Indian soil
 unhone azaadi ke pehle or baad main bhi kai bade janandolanon main bhaag liya tha
 Between 1939 and 1942, he was imprisoned in Bihar for leading a demonstration by farmers
 azaadi ke baad lambe samay tak wo patrakarita se bhi jude rahe
 These three qualities are not only found in Nagarjuna's personality, but also in his literature
 niraala ke baad nagarjun akele aise kavi hai, jinhone itane chand, itane dhang, itani sheliyaan or itane kavy roopon kaa istemaal kiya he
 He is a unique poet who uses traditional poetic forms with new texts and makes possible new poetic skills

 His manner of expression is oblique, very typical and straightforward
 apni tiryaktaa main ve jitne bejod hai, apni vagmita main ve utane hi vilakshan hai
 There is no impediment in using poetic forms

 If you borrow the verse from Nagarjuna's poem, then you can say - The seeds are contained in the world of grief
 bhashaa par baba kaa gazab adhikaar he
 There are many levels of their language, from the typical words of the Desi dialect to the Sanskritic classical term
 unhone to hindi ke alaava maithili, bangla or sanskrit main alag se bahut likhaa he
 Just as it was said earlier in the context of sentiment, it can be said from the point of view of language that the entire Hindi poetry tradition from Kabir to Dhumil is alive together in Baba's poems
 baba ne chand se bhi parhez nahin kiya, balki uskaa apni kavitaaon main krantikari dhang se istemaal karke dikhaa diya
 One of the basis of the popularity of Baba's poems is the miraculous use of verses performed by him
 samakaleen pramukh hindi sahityakar udai prakaash ke anusaar "yah jor dekar kehane kii zarurat he ki baba nagarjun beesvin sadi kii hindi kavita ke sirf 'bhades' or maatr vidrohi mizaaj ke kavi hi nahin, ve hindi jati ke sabase adwitiya moulik bauddhik kavi the

 The motives of gangs fighting in civil war are different

 During the civil wars, often foreign forces find the country weak and intervene in it, as in the Lebanon civil war that lasted from 1975–1990
 'grihayuddh' ko angreji main 'civil war', urdu main 'kaanaa-jangi', farsi main 'jang daakhili', arabi main 'herb ahalia', german main 'buargarkrig' kehete hai
