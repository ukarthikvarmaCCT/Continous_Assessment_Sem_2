 kaant kaa naitik mat "naitik shuddhta" kaa siddhant, "kartavya ke liye kartavya" kaa siddhant athwa "kathoratavaad" kaha jaataa he
 His philosophical view is known as "critical philosophy"
 emanuele kaant apane is prachaar se prasiddh huye ki manushya ko aise karm or kathan karne chahiyein jo agar sabhi karen to ve manushyata ke liye achche hon
 Emanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 AD, in the city of Königüzburg, under the East Provinces of Germany
 koniguzaberg shahar aaj rus main he or ab iskaa naam kalininograd Kaliningrad he
 His early education was under the supervision of his mother, who was greatly influenced by the religious movement called the "holy Way" of his time
 atev, alpaayu main hi vah dharmanumodith aacharan, saral, suvyavasthit evam adhyavsypurna jivan main ruchi rakhane laga tha
 At the age of 16, after completing his education at the "collegium Pheidrichianum", he entered the University of Königsberg, where for six years he studied physics, mathematics, philosophy and theology
 vishvavidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaant nau varshon ke liye, konigsburg se 60 mile dur, judsken naamak gaanv main chalaa gaya
 There he taught his livelihood in two families and continued his self-study in physics and philosophy

 In the first of these publications, he attempted to coordinate the ideas of power of Rene Dacart and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, and in the second the mechanical and objectivist ideas of Newton and Leibnitz, and in the second, the mechanical and purposive ideas of Newton and Leibnitz

 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary

 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
 The publication of texts also did not yield any large amount of money
 apane "critic ov pyor rizan" se kaant ko keval 30 pound aay hui thi
 But, not aspiring for material comforts, till 1796 AD, he was actively striving for the growth of knowledge of the world
 in 26 varshon main se aadi ke 12 varsh usne keval ek pustak ""shuddh buddhi kii samiksha" ke likhane main vyateet kiye
 The above book was published in 1781 AD

 Other texts of this period include "the Role of Every Future Philosophy", "the Background of Ethics", "the Philosophical Foundations of Natural Science", "review of Practical Wisdom", "review of Judgment", "religion Limited Only by Wisdom", and " On eternal peace "
 1796 i
 ke baad bhi vah adhyayan, chintan evam lekhan main vyast rahaa kintu uske jivan ke ye aath varsh badi dayaneey dasha main vyateet hue
 His memory had become so weak that he had to remember even by writing small things

 Therefore, he received a lot of support and sympathy from friends and disciples in the last part of his life

 ke baad to vah bahut hi ashakt ho gaya tha, kintu antim teen varshon main vesiyaanski naamak uske shishy ne saath rahakar ahernish uski dekhbhaal kii

 After doing so much work, he died on 12 February 1804 in Königsberg

 From dawn to dusk, all his works were done at certain times

 Most of the Western philosophers have been wandering, but Kant went more than sixty miles from his city in his lifetime
 phir bhi uskaa drushtikon sankuchit na tha
 He was not merely an intellectual thinker, he gave his philosophical ideas a place in life like Socrates and Pythagoras

 Duryodhana was already burnt by his ridicule, but Draupadi's utterances pierced him

 In the stake of dice, we will win everything of the Pandavas and make them poor again
 " Upon reaching Hastinapur, Duryodhana went directly to his father Dhritarashtra and told him in detail about his humiliations and also about his maternal uncle Shakuni's plan and asked for permission to invite Yudhishthira for gaming
 thodaa-bahut anakani karne ke pashchaat dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko apni anumati de di
 Yudhishthira was summoned to Hastinapur along with his brothers and Draupadi
 avasar paakar duryodhana ne yudhisthir ke saath dyut-krida kaa prastaav rakhaa jise yudhisthir ne sweekaar kar liya
 The dice game started
 duryodhana kii ore se mamaa shakuni paase phenkane lage
 Yudhishthira lost whatever he had at stake
 apana samast rajya tak ko haar jane ke baad yudhisthir ne apane bhaaiyon ko bhi daanv par laga diya or shakuni dhoortta karke is daanv ko bhi jeet gaya
 Seeing this, Bhishma, Drona, Vidur etc
 tried to stop this gambling but failed
 ab yudhisthir ne swayan apane aap ko daanv par laga diya or shakuni kii dhoortta se phir haar gayi
 When Yudhishthira woke up with no disguise when he lost himself along with the royal party and his brothers, Shakuni said, "yudhishthira! Still you can win everything back
 abhi draupadi tumhaare paas daanv main lagane ke liye shesh he
 If you win by putting Draupadi at stake, then i will return everything you lost
 " sabhi tarah se niraash yudhisthir ne ab draupadi ko bhi daanv main laga diya or hameshaa kii tarah haar gayi
 Seeing this victory, Duryodhana became frantic and said to Vidur, "draupadi is now our maid, you bring her here immediately
 " Hearing the words of Neecha Duryodhana, Vidur shuddered and said, "wicked! Dharmaraja became the maid of Yudhishthira's wife, this can never be possible
" aisa prathit hota he ki tera kaal nikat he isiliye tere mukh se aise vachan nikal rahe hai
 "but the wicked Duryodhana did not pay any heed to Vidur's words and sent one of his servants to bring Draupadi to the assembly
 vah sevak draupadi ke mahal main jaakar bolaa, "maharani! dharmraj yudhisthir kauravon se jua khelte huye sab kuch haar gayi hai
 They have also lost their brothers including you, so Duryodhana immediately summoned you to the meeting hall
 " draupadi ne kaha, "sevak! tum jaakar sabha bhawan main upasthit gurujanon se pucho ki aisi sthiti main mujhe kya karnaa chaiye?" sevak ne laut kar sabha main draupadi ke prashn ko rakh diya
 Hearing that question, Bhishma, Drona, etc
, the elders and Gurujan bowed their heads and sat silently
 yah dekh kar duryodhana ne duhshasan ko ajna di, "duhshasan! tum jaakar draupadi ko yahan le aao
 "after receiving Duryodhana's orders, Darshasan reached Draupadi and said," Draupadi! Our chef Duryodhana has won you in gambling
 main unki ajna se tumhen bulaane aayaa hoon
 On hearing this Draupadi said softly, "dushasan! i am a menstruator, i am not able to go to the assembly because at this time i have only one garment on my body
 " duhshasan bolaa, "tum rajaswala ho yaa vastraheen, mujhe isse koi prayojan nahin he
 You have to follow the orders of King Duryodhana
 " uske vachanon ko sun kar draupadi swayan ko vachane ke liye gandhari ke mahal kii ore bhaagane lagi, kintu duhshasan ne jhapat kar uske ghungharaale keshon ko pakad liya or sabha bhawan kii ore ghaseetne laga
 On reaching the assembly hall, all the hair of Draupadi was shattered and the clothes were removed from her half body
 apni yah durdasha dekh kar draupadi ne krodh main bhar kar ucch swaron main kaha, "re dusht! sabha main baithe huye in pratishthit gurujanon kii lajja to kar
 Do not you feel ashamed even a little while torturing a young woman? Damn to you and to your Bharatavansh! " yah sab sun kar bhi duryodhana ne draupadi ko daasi kah kar sambodhit kiya
 Draupadi again said, "are the elders Bhishma, Drona, Dhritarashtra, Vidur not seeing this atrocity? Where are my strong husbands? a jackal is humiliating me in front of them
" " draupadi ke vachanon se pandavon ko atyant klesh hua kintu ve maun bhav se sir nicha kiye huye baithe rahe
 Draupadi again said, "members! i want to ask you what right Dharmaraja had to stake me?" Listening to Draupadi, the diagonal got up and said, "goddess Draupadi's statement is true
 " yudhisthir ko apane bhai or swayan ke haar jane ke pashchaat draupadi ko daanv par lagane kaa koi adhikaar nahin tha kyonki vah paanchon bhai kii patni he akele yudhisthir kii nahin
 And then Yudhishthira staked Draupadi at the instigation of Shakuni, not voluntarily
 atev kauravon ko draupadi ko daasi kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 " vikarn ke nitiyukt vachanon ko sunakar duryodhana ke param mitra karn ne kaha, "vikarn! tum abhi kal ke balak ho
 Even the gurus like Bhishma, Drona, Vidur, Dhritarashtra present here could not say anything, because they know that we have won Draupadi at stake

 "encouraged by Karna's words, Duryodhana said to Duraशasana," Duraशasana! You remove Draupadi's clothes and expel her
 " itnaa sunate hi duhshasan ne draupadi kii sari ko kheenchna armbh kar diya
 Draupadi, with all her strength, shielding her sari, pleaded with the people present there, "I am being banished before you, but there is no one to rescue me from this crisis
" dhikkaar he aap logon ke kul or aatmbal ko
 My husband, who is silent even after seeing this plight of mine, is also cursed
 " Seeing the plight of Draupadi, Vidura did not stop, she said, "dada Bhishma! One innocent abala is being tortured like this and you are silent on seeing him
 kya hua aapke tapobal ko? is samay duratma dhritarashtra bhi chup he
 He does not know that the atrocities on this abla will destroy his clan
 ek sita ke apmaan se ravan kaa samast kul nasht ho gaya tha
 " vidura ne jab dekha ki unke nitiyukt vachanon kaa kisi par bhi koi prabhaav nahin pad rahaa he to ve sabko dhikkaarte huye vahaan se uth kar chale gayi
 Dushasan was engaged in his attempt to pull Draupadi's dress
 draupadi ne jab vahaan upasthit sabhaasadon ko maun dekha to vah dwarikavasi shri krishna ko terati hui boli, "he govind! he muraare! he krishna! mujhe is sansar main ab tumhaare atirikt or koi meri laaj bachaane vaala drushtigat nahin ho rahaa he
 Now you are ashamed of this Krishna
 " Bhaktavatsal Shri Krishna heard the call of Draupadi
 ve samast kaary tyaag kar tatkaal adrishyrup main vahaan padhaare or akaash main sthir hokar draupadi kii sari ko badhaane lage
 Dushasan used to pull Draupadi's sari and the sari did not take the name of ending
 sari ko khinchate-khichate duhshasan shithil hokar paseene-paseene ho gaya kintu apane kaary main safal na ho sakaa
 Finally, ashamed had to sit quietly
 ab sari ke us parvat ke samaan unche dher ko dekh kar vahaan baithe samast sabhaajan draupadi ke pativrat kii mukt kanth se prashansa karne lage or duhshasan ko dhikkaarne lage
 Seeing this insult by Draupadi, Bhimsen's whole body was being burnt with anger
 unhone ghoshnaa kii, "jis dusht ke haathon ne draupadi ke kesh khinche hai, yadi main un haathon ko apni gada se nasht na kar don to mujhe sadgati hi na mili
 If i am not able to rip his chest and drink his blood, then i will suffer the pangs of hell for a few births
 main apane bhrata dharmraj yudhisthir ke vash main hoon anyathaa is samast kauravon ko machhar kii bhanti masal kar nasht kar don
 If i were a lord today, i would have immediately reached Yamlok for anyone who touched Draupadi
 " Hearing Bhimsen's words, Duryodhana became more excited after seeing the other Pandavas and the councilors silent, and said, "draupadi! i am making you my Highness
 aao, tum meri baanyin jangha par baith jaao
 Leave these masculine Pandavas together
 " yah sunate hi bhim apni duryodhana ke saath yuddh karne ke liye uth khadey huye, kintu arjuna ne unka haath pakadakar unhen roak liya
 On this, Bhima again said to Duryodhana, "dukratma! i take an oath in a packed assembly and say that if i do not rip off your thigh in war, my name is not Bhima
" " At the same time, there was a terrible vengeance in the assembly
 gidad-kutton ke rudan se puraa vaataavaran bhar uthaa
 Seeing this tragedy, Dhritarashtra could not remain silent and said, "duryodhana! You have become impure
 aakhir kuch bhi ho, draupadi meri putr vadhoo he
 You are expelling him in a crowded meeting
 " iske pashchaat unhone draupadi se kaha, "putree! tum sachmuch pativrata ho
 You can ask whatever you want from me at this time
 " draupadi boleen, "yadi aap prasann hai to mujhe yah var den ki mere pati daastaa se mukti paa jaayen
 "dhritarashtra said," Devi! i am giving you this groom
 pandavagan ab daastaa mukt hai
 Daughter If you want to ask for something else, also ask for it
 " is par draupadi ne kaha, "he taat! aap mere patiyon ke divya rath evam shastrastra lautaa den
 "dhritarashtra said," Aastu "
 pandavon ke divya rath tathaa astr-shastr lautaa diye gayi
 Dhritarashtra said, "daughter! Ask for something else
 " is par draupadi boli, "bas tath! kshatraani keval do var hi maang sakati he
 Asking for more than this would be considered greed

 Kamal Ataturk alias Mustafa Kamal Pasha is said to be the creator of modern Turkey
 turki ke samrajyavaadee shaasha sultan abdul hamid dwitiya kaa pasa palat kar vahaan kamaal kii saamaajik, raajnneetik va aarthik vyavastha kaayam karne kaa jo krantikari kaary unhone kiya us aitihaasik kaary ne unke naam ko sarthak siddh kar diya
 Kamal Pasha was born on 19 May 1881 in a peasant family in Salonika
 inaki mata kaa naam juvaida va pita kaa ali raja tha
 Ali Raza was a clerk in Salonika's octroi office
 unka bachapan kaa naam mustafa tha
 The father died a few years after his birth
 mata jubaida ne majahabi talim dilaane ke uddeshy se madrase main daakhil kara diya jahaan unke senior chatro ke tang karne par vah marane maarane par utar aaye
 At the age of just 11, he had become so bad that he had to be removed from Maktab
 baad main unhen monastir ke sainik skool main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But there too, his die-hard extremist nature remained, but due to his interest in military education, his studies continued unabated, there was no disruption in him
 balak mustafa ugr avashya tha parantu ganit main uski gati aashcharya janak thi
 As soon as he wrote a question on the black board of the teacher, he used to solve it by force
 usamen kamaal kii kaabiliyat dekhakar skool ke ganit adhyaaapak captain mustafa ufindi ne naam badal kar kamaal rakh diya
 Only then did he become known as Kamal Pasha
 17 saal kii umr main monastir ke primary sainik skool main praarambhik sainya shiksha praapt karne ke baad unhen kustuntuniya ke staff kalege main ucch sainya shiksha hetu bhej diya gaya
 In those days, there was the Sultanate of Abdul Hameed in Kustuntunia and his crown was called Sultan
 vahaan vah adhyayan ke saath-saath buree sangat main ghoomte rahe
 After spending a brief period of arrogant life, he became the first member of a secret revolutionary party called Watan and became its leader only a few days later
 vatan kaa uddeshy ek taraf sultan kii taanaashaahee or duusari taraf videshi shadyantron ko jad se mitaanaa tha
 One day the meeting of the party was going on that some intelligence gave news to the Sultan and all the conspiracy officers were arrested and sent to jail
 prachlit kanoon ke anusaar un sabko mrityudand diya ja saktaa tha, par durbalchitt sultan ko bhay tha ki kahin aisa karne par desh main vidroh na bhadak uthe, at: usne sabkon kshamaadaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Thus, along with other soldiers, Kamal was also left in pardon
 tatpashchaat sultan ne druj jati ke vidroh ko dabaane ke liye unhen damishq bhej diya
 There Kamal did a wonderful job, but according to his nature he returned to Kustantunia and after opening a room in Stambool, he opened the office of watan-o-hurriyat Party and started the work of the secret organization of freedom in it
 isi bich unhen yah gyaat hua ki macedoniya main sultan ke viruddh khulaa vidroh hone vaala he
 Sensing the exaggeration of the occasion, Kamal took leave from the Sultan's army and disguised as Jaffa, Mirua and Athens and reached Salonika, the center of the rebellion
 parantu vahaan par unhen pahchaan liya gaya
 Then he ran towards Jaffa via Greece
 par tab tak unki giraftaar kaa aadesh vahaan bhi pahunch chukaa tha
 An officer named Ahmed Bay had the burden of capturing Kamal, but since Ahmed himself was a member of the country, he instead of arresting Kamal sent him to the Gaza front and sent a report to the Sultan that he had not gone on leave
 Were
 yadhyapi kamaal salonika main bahut thode samay tak hi rah paye, phir bhi unhone yah bhalee-bhanti samaj liya tha ki salonika ko hi vidroh kaa kendra bananaa thik rahegaa, isaliye bade prayatnon ke baad san 1908 main unhone apana sthaanantaran salonika hi karvaa liya
 Here two years ago under the leadership of Anwar, a revolutionary party was established in the name of unity and progress committee
 kamaal tatkaal uske sadsy ban gayi, parantu dal ke netaaon se unki nahin baniin
 Nevertheless, he continued to do the work of the committee
 is dal ke ek netaa niyazi ne keval kuch sau aadamiyon ko lekar turki sarkaar ke viruddh vidroh bol diya
 Although it was a matter of great stupidity, but since the whole country was ready, the army that was sent to fight it also went to Anwar
 is prakaar desh main anwar kaa jai-jayakaar ho gaya
 Now the co-operative army was preparing to attack the capital
 sultan ne inhen dinon kuch shashan-sudhaar bhi kiye
 Even then the powers of the rebellion continued to work, but when the rebellion was successful, Sultan Abdul Hameed joined some of the army with enough bribe, which led the soldiers to revolt and kill their officers and once more Islam, Slogans of Sultan and Khalifa's Jai were raised
 in dinon anwar berlin main the
 He soon returned and he put Abdul Hameed on the throne and hanged several reactionary leaders
 is prakaar anwar kii krantikari samiti ke haath main prashasnic shakti aa gayi
 In order to confound the general public, the Sultan's nephew was placed on the throne
 idhar kamaal pasha anwar ke viruddh nirantar shadyantr karte rahe kyonki unke vichaar se anwar beshak adarshavaadi the kintu avyaavhaarik adhik vyakti the
 Despite all this, Anwar continuously thwarted the foreign invasions that occurred at that time, this increased Anwar's fame in public
 iske baad anwar ne apane sarv islamic swapn ko satya karne ke liye kaary armbh kiya or unhone iske liye sabase pehla kaam yah kiya ki turki sena ko sangathit karne kaa bhaar ek german general ko diya
 Kamal started the movement against this, saying that this is an insult to the Turkish race
 is par kamaal ko sainik doot banaakar sofia bhej diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the great war broke out
 isamen anwar safal nahin ho sake, par kamaal ne ek yuddh main kustantuniya par adhikaar karne kii british chaal ko vifal kar diya or uske baad unki jeet par jeet hoti chali gayi
 Nevertheless, Turkey was defeated in the Great War
 kamaal din raat parishram karke videshiyon ke viruddh aandolan karte rahe
 Sevra's treaty was announced in 1920, but its conditions were so bad that Kamal immediately prepared an army and prepared to attack Kustuntunia
 isi bich greece ne turki par hamalaa kar diya or smarana main sena utaar di jo kamaal ke pradhan kendra angaara kii taraf badhane lagi
 Now a big problem has arisen for Kamal, because if they lose in this war, then there is no possibility
 isaliye unhone badi taiyaari ke saath yuddh kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki dhire-dhire greek sena ko peeche hatana padaa
 Meanwhile, France and Russia also started secretly assisting Kamal
 thode dinon main hi greek nikaal baahar kiye gaye
