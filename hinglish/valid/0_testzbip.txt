 This sub-division can be divided into twenty-three clans, of which the following are the details of the main clans: is upagan ke dyptera bahudhaa sthool sharirawale hote hai, jinaki shrungikas choti or teen khandwali hoti hai
 In these, the last long section generally becomes a list
 mexilari sparshak ek yaa do khand ke hote hai
 Many members of this subgroup are identified by their narrowness and small forward-facing tentacles
 yah upagan 17 kulon main vibhajit kiya gaya he, jinamein se kuch mahatvapurn kul nimnilikhit hai : The names of some other clans of the Bracisara subgene are Regionidi, Myededi, Nemstrimaidi, Acroceraeidi, etc
 is upagan ke dypteraaon kii shrungikaaon main teen khand hote hai, jinamein saadharantaya prishthiya baldaar prashakhaayen hoti hai

 Many Takinidis and other pests fall into this community
 duusare samudaay main glansina or pupipaara sanmilit hai
 In these, the larvae get food from special nutritive glands in the female uterus
 inhen samudaayon ke larve paripakv avasthaa main janm lete hai or janm lete hi inkaa pupikaran ho jaataa he

 Many other similar larvae are middle-class, have weak head and are classified as hemicephalus
 is prakaar kaa sir adhuraa hota he or vaksh ke bheetar sikoda ja saktaa he
 Due to lack of legs, such larvae live in hiding in rotten street objects, garbage, cow dung, soil, plant tissue and animals body and water
 shrungikas kadachit hi ubhari hui tathaa vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai or unamem ek se lekar chah tak khand hote he
 They are very strong in the working larvae of Nematosaera, as they search for their food
 kabhi kabhi ye bahut ksheen bhi hote hai
 There is also a strange difference in the composition of the facade of different communities
 nematosra ke kuch kulon main ye adarshabhoot paae jate hai
 The true body in the Cyclarapha is degenerative and is replaced by favorable compositions, which form the cephalopharyngeal skeleton
 maansaahaari kiton ke mukhbhaag tikshn or kantedaar hote hai, daant hote hi nahin
 But vegetative dietary pests have teeth
 mritopajivi kiton main grasaneey tal udrekhit hota he
 In vegetative foods, there is less or no grease and in the carnivores, no mention is made at all
 sambhavat: adhiktar larve sade gale jaev padaarth khate hai
 Some plants of Diptera clans eat only plants, but mostly they are philanthropists or predators of others
 purnavriddhiprapt larva pupa main badal jaataa he
 In this change, either the larva flattens its skin, or the same skin forms a rigid waterproof oval cell, called the pupa sac

 shwasaradhran kii adhiktam sankhya das joda, jaise bibio main, hoti he, parantu sitopsinal or isi tarah kuch anya kiton main ye nau jode hote hai
 There are mainly two pairs of postherpostitis, one anterior and one posterior, but in some insects, mainly philanthropists, only posterior posterior synapses are found
 pupa koshth andar ke bhaar ke kaaran ek nishchit rekha par fat jaataa he
 The adult organism of the severe or wanton Cyclarapha, by inflating the lalatic bladder or tilineum, exits, forming a hole in the pupa sac
 is gana ke mukhya praani puure vishwa main paae jate hai or inamen bahut kam hi samudaay ek hi sthaan tak simit he
 At the same time it is also important that they are found in large numbers and important communities in the tropical region

 No other class of insect is of more economic importance than Diptera
 kuch mahatvapurn sankramak rogon ke, jaise malaria, sushuptirog, filpaanv, peetajvar ityadi ke, rogotpadak jeev raktashoshak mackhiyon dwaara manushyon main sanchaarit kiye jate hai
 The larvae of these flies are not harmful
 makkhiyaan manushyon tathaa pashuon ke liye ghaatak tathaa vinaashkari siddh hoti hai
 For example, various species of Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes spread malaria and phyllopan from one human to another
 isi prakaar eidisjipty panduswar ke vaahak hai
 Glossinae infects fly neoplasms in humans and nongana in pets
 raktchushak choti makkhi dakshini europe or uttari africa main sand fever athwa pappataisi fever ke sankraman ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Similarly, 'horse fly' spreads disease-causing organisms of a type of disease, sara, in India and elsewhere
 gharelu makkhi or isi prakaar kii anya makkhiyaan swat: rogotpaadan kaa kaary na karke keval ghaatak bimariyon ke rogavahak kaa kaary karti hai
 Although they are not indigestible, bowel fever, diarrhea of children, cholecystitis, diarrhea etc
 are the carriers of diseases
 ye ek ore to malamutradi, thook, rogiyon ke shavon, khaad tathaa anya prakaar kii sadi gali vastuon kaa, jinamein vyaadhiyon ke jeevanu rahete hai, sparsh karti hai or duusari ore ve manushyon ke khaadya padaarthon par baithti hai
 They spread disease through two methods
 ek bahya rogantaran, jiske liye makkhi ke sampurna sharir kii rachana upyukt hoti he or doosraa aantar rogantaran, jo makkhi ke bhojan karne or ugalane yaa vaman karne kii aadat se hota he
 The larvae of many flies harm agricultural plants
 inamen se kuch mahatvapurn makkhiyaan hai, jaise falmakshikaaye, jo saare sansar main falon kaa naash karne ke liye prasiddh hai
 The fruit flies of the Mediterranean are found on 120 types of nutritious plants
 bharat main dekas dorselis falmakshika falon or tarkariyon ko bahut adhik kshati pahunchaati he
 There are many other similar flies, which cause great harm to plants here, such as gourd fly, watermelon or foot fly and other flies which are destructive of tarai, bitter gourd etc
 yada kada tamaato par bhi inkaa akraman hota he
 Members of this class harm citrus plants, turmeric, ginger, mango, plum, cardamom, lentils, paddy, cotton, madar, custard apple, etc
 kuch ke larva ann sambandhi or duusari fasalon kii jadon ko adhik haani pahunchaate hai
 Similarly, cabbage maggots and onion flies cause great damage to cabbage and onions
 kuch duusari mackhiyon ke larva manushyon or gharelu jaanwaron ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 The disease caused by his presence comes under myiasis in simple words
 maaiyaasis us sthiti ko kehete hai, jisamen manushya yaa jaanavar ke sharir kaa koi bhaag dyptera gana kii mackhiyon ke andey yaa larve se aakraant rahata he
 These larvae are any natural holes in the body; Skin ulcers are found in alimentary canal or body tissues
 is shrenee main europe or america kii varble makkhi aati he, jo bharat main punjab main bhi pai jaati he
 It causes great harm by penetrating the skin of the animal
 isi prakaar ghode kii vadhai ghode or khachcharon kii aaharanlika par akraman karti hai
 The slaughter of the sheep lays eggs in the nostrils of the sheep and the larvae emerge from the eggs and reach the brain
 dyptera keval hanikaarak hi nahin hote, varan inaki bahut si aisi jatiyaan bhi hai jo maanav ke liye ati upyogi hai
 They help a great deal in the growth and yield of our crops, orchards and forests
 bahut si aisi duusari laabhadaayak makkhiyaan bhi hai jo duusare anya kiton ko samaapt kar detii hai
 This group contains predators and some parasites, which are beneficial
 parabhakshiyon main hower makkhi, kul sarfidi or rober makkhi kaa larva aata he
 The parasitic larvae of the Takinidi clan kill many other insects
 ganne kaa borer bital is prakaar ke paraseete takinid ke dwaara niyantrit hua he
 Similarly, other Takinids have proved helpful in controlling many harmful insect pests

85 chak sarg bharat ke uttar pradesh rajya ke elahabaad jile ke handiya prakhand main sthit ek gaanv he
 Suraj's seventh horse is the famous novel of Dharmaveer Bharti
 dharmaveer bharti kii is laghu aupnyasik rachana main hitopadesh or panchatantrvaali style main 7 dopahari main kahi gai kahaniyon ke rup main ek upanyaas nirmit kiya gaya he
 This book is from the Indian Jnanpith ise laghu upanyaas kii sangya di gayi he
 The texture of the plot gives a new dimension to the theme of the novel
 ‘suraj kaa satvon ghoda’ bhi bharat-iran kii pracheen shaileyon se prabhavit mana jaataa he
 But, this method of the old anecdote - aliphalla, panchatantra, dashakumarcharit or kathasaritsagara - is only the upper skin of the 'seventh horse of the sun', it cannot be considered the basic structure of the plot
 ek duusari style bhi isamen parilakshith kii ja sakati he- vah he, virgthaon yaa anya mahakavyon jaisi style, jisamen rachanaakaar apni rachanaaon kaa rachayita hi nahin varan ghatnaon ke bich swayan bhi upasthit he
 He is both a bhakta and an author
 is prakaar rachana tatasth hone, nijee anubhuti ko saarvajanik anubhav main tabdeel karne kaa daayitv ban jaati he
 Chandavaradayi, the author of 'prithviraj Raso', is also its important character, just as Valmiki and Tulsi present themselves in their compositions or that Sanjay is present in the Mahabharata event
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ ke kisse maanik mullah sunaate hai, lekin ve in kahaniyon ke vaktaa maatr hi nahin – ve inke bich badi shiddat se maujuud hai
 He is also the bearer of these stories, just like Valmiki, Sanjay and Chand
 kaha jaataa he ki ‘raso’ ko chandvardaayi ne puraa na kar yah kaam apane bete jalhan ko saunp diya tha
 The last excerpts of 'raso' are written by him, similarly there are stories of 'seventh horse of the sun' narrated by Manik Mulla, but presents him as a listener 'I'
 ‘main’ hi iskaa mul lekhak he lekin vah ramcharita maanas ke tulsi kii tarah, jo ramakatha ke shiv-parvati samvaad ke prastota maatr ban jate hai- hamaare saamne aata he
 He tells of the stories narrated by Manik that “finally i also want to make it clear that whatever is good and evil in the subject matter of this short novel is not on me but on Manik Mulla
 maine sirf apane dhang se vah katha aapke saamne rakh di he’’
 This writer-presenter is also present in the story in a minor capacity - as a listener
 rachana or rachanaakaar bhartiya parampara main sahaj awajahi karte rahe hai
 This novel also allows the narrative and narrator's likeness to be possible in the texture of its plot
 yatharth or kalpana ek duusare ke poorak hone lagate hai
 If it is said that the middle class is half-real and half-dreamed, then it will not be wrong
 srijan ke liye bhi kalpana or hakeekat kaa sanyog ek anivaary sthiti he
 Therefore, the middle class is the most creative, dreamy and change oriented
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ isi madhyavarg kii daastaan – uski antarvirohi sthitiyon ke saath – hamaare saamne prastut karata he
 The plot of this creation is woven into a new genre
 shuruuaat upodghaat se hui he
 Upadhuga means prelude, role
 mukhya katha-adhyyon ke bich main chaar anadhyaay bhi jode gaye hai
 Apart from these, the entire story is divided into seven afternoons
 saat dopaher kii katha maanik mullah kii he or upodghaat samet chaar anadhyaay unke shrota ‘main’ kii tippaniyan hai
 This tale, divided into twelve parts in total, sheds light on the lives of the leading characters - Jamuna, Lily and Satti - who came in contact with Manik Mulla
 saath hi, yah bhi pataa chalata he ki in paatro se jude sandarbhon par maanik mullah ke shrotaaon kii pratikriya kisi thi
 This novel takes shape with these mixed events
 upodghaat main hamen maanik mullah ke vyaktitv, unki abhiruchiyon, kisse gadhane kii unki kshamta or unako sunaane ke andaaj ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Here we also get to know that, "if there is enough time, the whole house is in the right, four friends are sitting, then it is certain that the talks will turn on politics and when the interest in politics ends, then the meeting The dialogue will rest on 'love'
 lekin jahaan tak saahitiyik vaarta kaa prashn tha, ve prem ko tarjeeh diya karte the
 These statements reveal which are the necessary tools for novel writing
 ve hai- fursat kaa samay, aise log jo swayan fursat main hon or ise kaatane ke liye kisson kaa sahaara chaah rahe hon, aisi jagah jahaan bahari vyavdhaan na ho
 Politics, love and literature can be natural subjects of a novel
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii rachana inhen upkarnon ke sahare hoti he
 Therefore, this work is composed from personal contexts, ignoring the vast social questions
 ise mahakavyatmak upanyaas kii shrenee main na rakhkar laghu upanyaas kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 Instead of establishing the ideal, the inauguration of reality is at its center
 yah yatharth bhi apni samvednaa or bhavbhumi main laghutaa ko hi, rosemara kii aam ghatnaon ko hi adhik ubharta he
 All the characters, including Manik Mulla, are an average character, they are so overwhelmed by their daily events that they try to examine the country, the world and society with their personal eyes
 isiilie bade saamaajik darshan kii ek ridusd samaj unki banati he
 Girija Kumar Mathur has divided the composition of 'the seventh horse of the sun' into three stories
 ‘pratham kathavritt kaa centre maanik mullah he
 Satellites of Jamuna, Lily and Tanna centers
 duusare katha-vrutt kaa centre bhi maanik mullah he, sati, mahesar or chaman singh centre ke upgrah
 The third is the story of 'I', on one side of which is a satirical depiction of Marxist principles and on the other side the individualistic art-aspects
 yah vrutt gaun he
 Girija Kumar Mathur further commented on its craft features, commenting that, "in Anadhyay, 'I' has analyzed the character of everyone in one way or the other, but he is so fascinated with Manik Mulla that his balanced analysis anywhere He has not let it happen
 arthath kahani rachane vaala ‘main’ naamak jo shrota he, vah upanyaas ke bheetar daawa to yah karata he ki main maanik katha ko jyon-kaa-tyon prastut kar rahaa hoon or technic samet baaki sabhi vastuon ke liye usne maanik mullah ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya he, lekin vah tatasth nahin rah sakaa
 In the composition of this novel, like Prakash's view about Manik, "ho na ho Manik Mulla also has some obsession towards women like other Hindi storytellers
 ” kuch aisa hi obseshan ‘main’ kaa maanik ke prati he
 He is overwhelmed by Manik's unique personality and determined to save his stories
 is anany shrota ‘main’ ne nishchit hi in kahaniyon ko mahatvapurn mana he, isiilie maanik mullah ke laapata hone par unhen bachaane kii disha main kalambaddh kiya he
 Therefore, 'I' cannot be considered a neutral presenter of Manik Mulla's stories, but 'I' and Manik are mostly one and not the same person
 isiilie maathur tisare vrutt ko gaun maanate hai
 Well, the main concerns of this novel develop around the stories of Manik
 ve dekhne main simit lag sakate hai lekin isse koun inkaar karegaa ki hamaari jindagi kii adhiktar urja inhen choti-moti samasyaon ko sulajhane main nikal jaati he or madhyavargi jansamooh inhen uplabdhiyon ke dwaara swayan ko sarthak mahasoos kar paata he
 Hence, 'the seventh horse of the sun' becomes a remarkable act of seeking significance in miniature, and reflects the untamed aspirations of the middle class
 upanyaas main lakik mulyon kii sakriyata hoti he
 The creation of a novel is not possible without a realistic perspective
 upanyaas ko ham jivan kaa kalatmak vikalp maan sakate hai
 a novelist creates a world in his novel through events, characters, situations, dialogue, etc
 ye charitra vaastavik na hote hue bhi vaastaviktaa kaa ehsaas rachate hai tathaa ‘jivan or samaaj kii jatiltaaon se jujhane kaa pramaan’ upasthit karte hai
 The plot, narrative, style, style, and purpose are important among the various elements from which the novelist creates his novel world
 nityanand tiwari kaa maananaa he ki, “har upanyaaskaar apni drushti se jivan kii samasyaon ko chirakar unke bheetar se in tatwon kaa sanghathan karata he
 These elements are not mechanical formulas
 inaki bhoomika niamak nahin, nirdeshak he
 The presence of these elements in 'seventh horse of the sun' comes in a balanced proportion, but privacy remains more active throughout the narrative

 Public institutions: Public institutions are legislative institutions that undertake social, commercial, economic or development related work for or on behalf of the state
 iskaa apana kosh he or vyavastha ke aantarik maamalon main yah anshat: swytt hoti he
 Different names have been used for this type of institute, such as - Government Corporation, Statutory Corporation, Quasi Government Body, etc
 kintu saarvajanik sanstha hi ab saamanyat: prayukt hota he
 In England, the idea of a public institution could not flourish for a long time even after the state controlled the mint and postal system

 The institute was called the "federal Railway Authority", but the scheme was not implemented due to non-implementation of the Act

 saamaajik or vaanijya sambandhi sevaaon ke vaanchit kaary or saahas ko avaruddh karne vaali naukarshahi parampara bhi iske lacheele or swytt hone ke kaaran nahin punap paati
 It mainly has the following benefits: 1

 2
 All the power is concentrated to do the same task

 For the post of president of the institute, such persons should be appointed who can give full time to the same

 On the other hand, environmental geography studies them as a natural disaster because it causes loss of ecosystems and life and property
 jwalamukhi Geologists are not unanimous about the activity, but if a volcano is currently erupting, or it is expected to burst soon, or if it has signs of activity like gas leaking, smoke or lava, or earthquake, then it Is considered active
 yah ve jwalamukhi hote hai jinke bare main vaigyanikon kii apeksha he ki ve fatenge nahin
 It is estimated that the lava and magma in them are gone and now there is no heat and material left to spew into them

 It is difficult for scientists to distinguish between dead and dormant volcanoes, but if a volcano in human memory ever exploded long ago in history, it is considered dormant but not dead
 bahut se aise jwalamukhi hai jinhen fatne ke baad ek or visphot ke liye dabaav banane main lakhon saal guzar jate hai - inhen us dauraan supt mana jaataa he
 For example, the Toba volcano, which erupted nearly 70,000 years ago, killed all humans in the Indian subcontinent and the entire human race was on the verge of extinction, ready to re-erupt every 3,80,000 years

 That is, those volcanoes whose cavity or mouth are not more than 100 feet in diameter and its shape is round or nearly round, and from which gas lava and fissile substances appear to be much higher in size with greater explosive emission
 Are called volcanoes with central origin

 The AK 47 is considered to be the world's first and perhaps the best Assault rifle
 iskaa vikaas soviet sangh ke mikhail kalashnicove ne kiya tha, isi kaaran ise kabhi kabhi kalashnicove rifl bhi kaha jaataa he
 During the Second World War, the German Army developed the concept of assault rifle, they saw that most of the encounters were within the range of 300 meters, while the rifles and cartridges which were found in those days were more in terms of such short distance fighting
 was
 is liye sena ne is prakaar kii rifl or kaartoos kii maang kii jisame sabamshin ke gun bhi ho or yah 300 meter ke daayre main kaam karti ho
 As a result, the German Army STG 44 rifle came out, although it was not the first rifle of this type, the Italian Army also sei-rigotti and the Soviet Army's Federov Evamot rifle were of this category
 lekin german sena ne ye rifle bade paimaane pe prayog kii thi jis se unhen inkaa moolyankan karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 The Soviet Army was also influenced by the principles and philosophy of the German Army and started following them after World War II

 The rifle faced a lot of problems in the initial stages of production, the first models it encountered were the receivers of the stamped metal sheet, its guides and ejector trail were also difficult to weld, due to which it got bigger The scale had to be rejected but instead of stopping production, a heavy mechanical receiver was put in it
 It was a costly solution but after doing it the product The speed of the day was increased, then no new mechanical revavers were being installed, only the receivers of the earlier Mosin Nagat rifles were being used, due to this problem, these rifles could not be distributed in mass in the Soviet Army until 1956
 , And during this time only SKS Rifle was given to the army, Once the production problem was resolved, a new model was started to be given to the AKM army
this new model was equipped with a stamped sheet metal receiver
 It also had a hammer marker so that a limited number of rounds could be run while the automatic shot was fired, and the weapon would not suffer any damage, it is also called round redioser
 The new model was 1 / 3 less heavy than the old model
 This model is the most popular today and its production has been the highest till date, although generally this distinction is not known to Kisii
 It is not right to call all rifles AK47
 Some of them are akms, you can differentiate them in the picture given below, the total four differences of AK47 are as follows
 Original model of type 1 a / b AK47, 1b was changed for folding, is ricel kii khasayit he iskaa saral dizin, chota aakaar or bahut kam laagat main badi sankhya main nirmaan karne kii suvidha, isaki kathorta or bharosemandi myth ban chuki he, ise arctic jaisi sardi padane vaale ilaake ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya tha isame bahut zyada kachra fasane ke baad bhi ye kaam kar sakati he, lekin iske chalate iske nishane utane achche nahin rah jate he, soviet laal sena ise samooh main prayog karne vaala hathiyaar maanati thi, is kaa saamaanya jivan kaal 20 se 40 saal mana jaataa he jo iske rakrakhaav pe nirbhar karata he, kuch eke 47 ke saath sangeen bhi laagaa ke di jaati he This rifle has an iron gauge on the back for ease of aiming, the front end of the rifle also has a gauge to assist in shooting, after adjusting them the user can easily aim for up to 250 meters
 Its interior parts like gas chamber, bore etc
 are plated with chromium which increases the life of this rifle and does not rust, modern Most of the cartridges of the cartridge contain parts of mercury which help in combating and melting any weapon
 is rifl ko saim automatic or automatic donon tareekon se chalaaya ja saktaa he is gas apretad rifl main rikoil takanic se puraane kartos girte jate ahi or iske jatke se nae kaartoos aa jate he This rifle can be dismantled very easily and you can see the operation and dismantling techniques in the manual given in the context

 The armies and governments have been using encryption for a long time for their secret communication
 ancripshan ko ab kai tarah kii aam naagarik pranaaliyon main jaankaree kii suraksha main prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the Institute of Computer Security reported that in 2007, 71% of the companies surveyed used encryption to pollute some part of their data, and 53% used encryption to store some of their data
 ancripshan bachaae gaye data ko surakshit rakhane ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii computer or bhandaaran upkarnon par rakhi gai filein
 haal ke varshon main, laptop yaa back-ap upkarnon ke gum yaa chori ho jane kii vajah se gopneey data jaise ki graahakon ke vyaktigat record ke ujagar ho jane kii kai khabaren saamne ai hai
 Encrypting such files allows us to protect them even if physical security measures fail

 Encryption is also used to protect data in pollination, for example when transferring data through networks, mobile phones, wireless microphones, wireless intercom systems, Bluetooth devices, and the bank's automated teller machine
 Over the years, there have been several reports of data interception in pollination
 paraagaman main data ko ancript karne se use surakshit karne main madad milti he kyonki aksar network ke sabhi praveshon ko shaareerik rup se surakshit karnaa mushkil hota he
 Encryption is quite capable of protecting the confidentiality of messages, but other technologies are needed to protect the integrity and authenticity of a message; For example, verification of the authenticating code or digital signature of the message
 Standards for encryption and cryptography software and hardware are widely available, but successfully using encryption to determine security can be a challenging problem

 It is possible that a rival receives encrypted information directly without removing encryption
 Such as traffic analysis, Tempest, or Trojan virus

 He was killed on the fifth day by destroying the entire Kshatriyas
 duryodhana pun: shok se aatur ho uthaa
 At that time Karna became the helm of his army
 pandav-sena kaa aadhipaty arjuna ko mila
 Karna and Arjuna had a great battle involving the destruction of weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat dewasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa; satrahawein din se pehle tak, karn kaa yuddh arjuna ke atirikt sabhi pandavon se hua
 He also defeated these Pandavas in a one-on-one battle, including Mahabali Bhima
 par mata kunti ko die vachananusaar usne kisi bhi pandav kii hatya nahin kii
 The clock finally arrived in the seventeenth day of war, when Karna and Arjun came face to face
 is shandaar sangram main donon hi baraabar the
 Karna was given a bow called Vijay by his guru Parashurama, which was designed by Vishwakarma himself
 duryodhana ke nivedan par pandavon ke mamaa shalya karn ke sarathi banane ke liye taiyaar hue
 As a matter of fact, Arjuna's charioteer was Sri Krishna himself and Karna was not to be inferior to Arjuna in any case, so he was requested to become a charioteer by surgery, as he had all the qualities that a qualified charioteer should possess
 ran ke dauraan, arjuna ke baan karn ke rath par lage or uskaa rath kai gaj peeche khisak gaya
 But, when Karna's arrows hit Arjuna's chariot, his chariot slipped away only a few times
 isapar shrikrishna ne karn kii prashansa kii
 Surprised at this, Arjuna asked the reason for this praise of Karna, because his arrows were more effective in pushing the chariot back
 tab krishna ne kaha ki karn ke rath par keval karn or shalya kaa bhaar he, lekin arjuna ke rath par to swayan ve or hanuman virajman he or tab bhi karn ne unke rath ko kuch baalist peeche khiskaa diya
 Similarly, Karna cut Arjuna's bow several times
 lekin har baar arjuna palak jhapakate hi dhanush par pratyancha chadha letaa
 Karna praises Arjuna for this and tells surgically that he now understood why Arjuna is called the best archer
 karn or arjuna ne divine astron ko chalaane ke apane-apane gyaan kaa purna upyog karte hue bahut lanbaa or ghamaasan yuddh kiya
 "nagastra" was used by Karna to separate Arjuna from the head
 lekin shrikrishna dwaara sahi samay par rath ko bhoomi main thodaa sa dhansa liya gaya jisase arjuna batch gaya
 This led to "nagastra" piercing his crown just above Arjuna's head
 nagastra par upasthit ashwasena naag ne karn se nivedan kiya ki vah us astr kaa dobaaraa prayog kare taaki is baar vah arjuna ke sharir ko bedhta hua nikal jaae, lekin karn mata kunti ko die vachan kaa paalan karte hue us astr ke punah prayog se manaa kar detaa he
 Karna removes the wheel of his chariot sunken into the earth
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya 
 He also finds himself unable to use divine weapons, as was the curse of his mentor Parashurama
 tab karn apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he or arjuna se nivedan karata he ki vah yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hue kuch der ke liye usapar baan chalaanaa band kar de
 Sri Krishna then tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to talk about war rules and religion, whereas he himself did not follow any war rules and religion at the time of Abhimanyu slaughter
 unhone aage kaha ki tab uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha jab usne divya-janma draupadi ko puri kuru rajsabha ke samaksh vaishya kaha tha
 Where did his religion go in the sports hall? isliye ab use koi adhikaar nahin kii vah kisi dharm yaa yuddh niyam kii baat kare or unhone arjuna se kaha ki abhi karn asahaay he isliye vah uskaa vadh kare
 Sri Krishna says that if Arjuna had not yet killed Karna at this decisive turn, the Pandavas would probably never be able to kill him and this war could never be won
 tab, arjuna ne ek divine astr kaa upyog karte hue karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 After Karna's body fell to the ground, a flame emerged from Karna's body and was absorbed into the sun
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna se kehete hai ki karn ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah ab yuddh niyamon or dharm kii baat kare, jabaki swayan usne bhi abhimanyu vadh ke samay kisi bhi yuddh niyam or dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 He further said where his religion had gone when he called the divine-born Draupadi as a prostitute in front of the entire Kuru Rajya Sabha
 dhyut-krida bhawan main uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha
 So now he has no right to talk about any religion or war rules and he told Arjuna that Karna is helpless now so he should kill him
 shrikrishna kehete hai ki yadi arjuna ne is nirnaayak mode par abhi karn ko nahin maaraa to sambhawatah pandav use kabhi bhi nahin maar sakenge or yah yuddh kabhi bhi nahin jeeta ja sakegaa
 Then, Arjuna beheaded Karna using a divine weapon
 karn ke sharir ke bhoomi par girane ke baad ek jyoti karn ke sharir se nikali or surya main samahit ho gai

 He recruited a large number of soldiers in his army, in which poor people from all sections of Lucknow got a good opportunity to get jobs

 Like buildings, gardens, music, dance and other art medium, Wajid Ali Shah gave his army multicolored diversity and attractive splendor

 He also made a security squad of thirty agile women for the purpose of protecting themselves and the fairies during the time of Bali Ahadi
 jise apekshanuroop sainik prashikshan bhi diya gaya
 It is possible that Uda Devi had been a member of this squad earlier, because after becoming the emperor, the Nawab dissolved this squad and created a female platoon

 Uda Devi was killed on 16 November 1857 by receiving 36 British soldiers to death

 This was done to ensure India attained the status of a Dominion under the British Raj
 us samay british samrajya ke bheetar australia, canada, dakshin africa, newjiland or newfoundland dominian ke rup main sthapit the
 At the start of the First World War, moderates from the Indian National Congress decided to help Britain
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke is nirnay ke peeche sambhawatah ye kaaran tha ki yadi bharat britain kii sahaayta karegaa to yuddh ke pashchaat britain bharat ko swatantra kar degaa
 But soon the Indian National Congress got the impression that Britain would never do such a thing and hence the Indian leaders became dissatisfied and started looking for another route
 yahi asantushtataa hi home rule aandolan ke janm kaa kaaran bani
 Two Home Rule Leagues were established between 1915 and 1916
 'pune home rule lig' kii sthapana bal gangadhar tilak ne or 'madras home rule lig' kii sthapana ani besent ne kii
 The Home Rule League became a subsidiary of the Indian National Congress
 is aandolan kaa uddeshy swa-rajya kii prapti tha parantu is aandolan main shastron ke prayog kii anumati nahin thi
 Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant erected a flag in 1917 during the Home Rule Movement
 is dhvaj par paanch laal or chaar hari tirakshi pattiyaan baniin thi
 Seven stars were also inscribed on it, but this flag did not become very famous among the people
 1920 main, akhil bhartiya home rule lig ne mahatma gandhi ko iske adhyaksh ke rup main nirvaachit kiya
 In one year, this organization merged into the Indian National Congress for a united Indian political front and ended its own existence
 shrimati eni bessent ireland kii rahanevaali thi
 She was the head of the Theosophical Society in India
 ve bhartiya sabhyataa tathaa samskruti se bahut prabhavit thi
 So she left Ireland and settled in India and started considering India as her motherland
 is samay ireland main yris netaa redmand ke netritv main homerul lig kii sthapana hui thi jo vaidhanik tathaa shantimay upayon se ireland ke liye homerul tathaa swashaasan praapt karnaa chaahati thi
 When Anne Besant went to England in 1913, the Homerule League of Ireland suggested to her that the Homerul movement should be started to make India independent
 shrimati eni bessent bharat ko usee tarah kaa swaraj dilaanaa chaahati thi, jaisaa ki british samrajya ke duusare upniveshon main tha arthath bharat ko adhirajya sthiti dilaane kii icchhuk thi
 On returning to India for this purpose, he joined the Congress and organized the Homerul movement by uniting liberals and extremists
 homerul aandolan ek vaidhanik aandolan tha
 The main objectives of this movement were: bal gangadhar tilak chah varsh kii lambi sajaa kaatane ke baad 16 june 1914 ko jail se chute
 Most of the time of captivity was spent in Mandalay

 The Indian National Congress was yet to recover from the combined shock of the moderate nationalists' disappointment due to the partition of Surat, the oppressive attacks of the British on the agitators, and the constitutional reforms of 1909
 tilak ne sochaa ki sabase pehle to congress hokar baaki garampanthiyon ko bhi isamen shaamil karavaaya jaae
 Tilak was convinced that the Indian National Congress has become synonymous with the Indian National Movement and no national movement can succeed without its permission
 narampanthiyon ko samajhane-bujhane, unka vishwaas jeetne tathaa bhavishya main angreji hukumat daman kaa rasta na akhriyaar kare, is uddeshy se usne ghoshnaa kii ‘‘main saaf-saaf kahata hoon ki ham log hindustan main prashasan vyavastha kaa sudhaar chaahate hai jaisaa ki ireland main vahaan ke aandolankaaree maang kar rahe hai
 We have no intention of overthrowing the British rule
 is baat ko kehane main mujhe koi hichak nahin ki bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main jo hinsaatmak ghatnaayen hui hai, na keval meri vichaardhaara ke vipareet he, balki unke kaaran hamaare raajnneetik vikaas kii prakriya bhi dhimi hui he
 He reiterated his loyalty to the British rule and appealed to the Indian public to support the British rule in times of crisis
 narampanthi kheme ke tamaam netaa ab mahasoos karne lage the ki 1907 main surat main jo kuch unhone kiya, vah galat tha
 They were also upset with the stagnation of the Congress
 inhen tilak kii apil bahut bhaayi
 Apart from this, he was under constant pressure from Anne Besant to revive the nationalist political movement in the country
 eni bessent abhi haal hi main congress main shaamil hui thi
 In 1914, she was 66 years old, her political career began in England where she participated in the promotion of freedom thinking, radical reformism, Fabianism and theology
 1893 main ve bharat ai, uddeshy tha thiosaphical socity ke liye kaam karnaa
 He opened his office in Adiyar, a suburb of Madras and in 1907 started promoting Theosophy
 thode samay main hi unhone samarthakon kii ek badi sankhya kar lee
 Including mostly educated individuals from communities that had not yet had a cultural renaissance
 1914 main eni bessent ne apni gatividhiyon kaa dayera badhaane kaa nirnay kiya or ireland kii homerul lig kii tarah bharat main bhi swashaasan kii maang ko lekar aandolan chalaane kii yojana banaai
 They felt that for this it was necessary to seek the permission of the Congress and the cooperation of the extremist agitators
 garampanthiyon kaa sahyog paane ke liye unhen congress main shaamil karnaa jaruri tha
 Anne Besant understood the radical leaders of the Congress to allow Tilak and his extremist allies to join the Congress
 lekin 1914 ke congress adhiveshan ne uski koshishon par pani pher diya
 Ferozeshah Mehta and his moderate supporters of Bombay convinced Gokhale and Bengal moderates to keep the extremists out
 iske baad tilak or eni bessent khud apane boote par raajnneetik aandolan chalaane kaa faisla kiya or saath-hi-saath ve congress par dabaav bhi daalati rahi ki garampanthiyon ko punah apana sadsy bana le
 In early 1915, Anne Besant started the movement through two newspapers 'new India' and 'kaman Veil'
 jansabhaayen tathaa sammelan yojit kiye
 Their demand was that in the way the white people were given the right to form their own government in the white colonies, the people of India should also get the right to self-government
 april 1915 ke baad eni bessent ne or bhi kadaa or jujharu rukh akhriyaar kiya
 Meanwhile, Lokmanya Tilak started his political activities
 lekin ve kaaphi satark the ki congress kaa narampanthi khemaa naaraaz na ho yaa congress ko yah na lage ki tilak kii gatividhiyaan congress kii niti se mail nahin khaati
 His heartfelt desire was to join the Congress in some way
 tilak ne 1915 main puna main apane samarthakon kaa ek sammelan bulaayaa, jisamen yah faisla kiya ki gramin janata ko congress ke uddeshyon or uski gatividhiyon se parichit karaane ke liye ek santhaan kaa gathan kiya jaae
 After this decision, in August and September of the same year, the local organizations formed in different cities of Maharashtra, instead of intensifying political activities, spent all the energy to establish unity in the Congress
 ve baraabar jor dete rahe ki kisi bhi rashtriya aandolan ke liye congress main ekta bahut jaruri he
 Tilak sometimes resorted to intimidation to pressure some moderate Congress conservatives, but was confident that he would convince most moderate leaders to be persuaded
 disambar 1915 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan hua or tilak tathaa eni bessent ke prayaason ko safalataa mili
 It was decided to withdraw the extremists into the Congress
 firozshah mehta ke nidhan ke baad bombay ke narampanthiyon kaa virodh beasar sabit hua
 Gokhale had passed away
 garampanthiyon ko congress main laane main to eni bessent safal rahi par homerul lig ke gathan ke apane prastaav par congress or muslim lig kii manjuuri nahin le saki
 But his proposals for campaigning to revive Congress committees at the local level were accepted by the Congress but he knew the character and strength of the Congress of that time
 ve jaanati thi ki congress ne in kaaryakramon ko manjuuri to de di he, lekin vah is par amal nahin karegi
 Therefore, he had also laid down the condition with his proposal that if the Congress does not implement these programs by September 1916, then it will form its own organization
 tilak ko kagrence main waapas aane kaa adhikaar mil gaya tha or unhonen kagrence se kisi tarah kaa vaada bhi nahin kiya tha, isliye unhonen april 1916 main belgaum main hue prantiya sammelan main ‘homerul lig’ ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Annie Besant's supporters now swear
 ve sitambar tak intjaar karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 They pressurized Annie Besant to seek permission to establish the Homerul Group
 jamanadas dwarkadas, shankaralal baker or indulal yajyanik ne bombay main ek akhbaar ‘yang india’ kaa prachlan shuru kiya or angreji tathaa kshetray bhashaa main parache nikaalane ke liye desh ke kone-kone se chandaa ikattha karne lage
 Annie Besant waited until September
 congress puri tarah niskriy thi
 He also announced the establishment of the Home Rule League and appointed his supporter George Arundel as the Organization Secretary
 tilak or ani bessent ne apni-apni lig ke liye kaaryakshetron kaa bantwaaraa bhi kar diya, jisase kahin koi gadbady na ho
 Tilak's league was the responsibility of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Berar
 desh ke baaki hisse ani bessent kii lig ke jimme thi
 These two did not merge
 kaaran tha ani bessent ke kuch samarthak tilak ko pasand nahin karte the tathaa tilak ke kuch samarthak ani bessent ko, lekin un donon ke bich kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin tha
 Tilak visited Maharashtra
 homerul aandolan kaa khub prachaar kiya
 Explained to the public why it is needed, what are its objectives
 unheen ke shabdon main, ‘‘bharat us bete kii tarah he, jo jawan ho chukaa he
 The time is right for the father or foster to give his rightful rights to this son
 bhartiya janata ko ab haq lenaa hi hoga
 They have every right to it
 ’’ tilak ne kshetray bhashaa main shiksha or bhashaai rajyon kii maang ko ‘swaraj’ kii maang se jod diya
 He said, "the demand for the formation of provinces on the basis of Marathi, Telugu, Kannada and other languages means that the medium of instruction should be the regional language
 kya angrej apane yahan logo ko francisi kii shiksha dete he
 Do Germans teach their people in English or do Turks teach in French
 ’’ 1915 main bombay ke prantiya sammelan me tilak ne gokhale ke nidhan par shok prastaav rakhaa
 Bb As soon as Alur stood up to support it, Tilak said, "speak in Kannada to assert the right to Kannada language
 ’’ isse pataa chalata he ki tilak kshetray marathi sankeernata nahin thi
 Tilak was not a casteist in the cases of untouchables and non-brahmins
 maharashtra ke gaiyr brahmanon ne ek-ek baar sarkaar ko alag se gyaapan bheja ki ucch virgon kii maangon se unka koi sambandh nahin he
 So many people opposed it
 lekin tilak ne in virodh karanevaalo ko samajhaayaa, aap log dhairya se kaam lijie
 If we can convince them that we are with them and there is no difference between their demands and our demands, then i am sure that their movement to eradicate inequality will join our struggle
 ”he explained to non-brahmins that quarrel There is no distinction between Brahmins and non-brahmins between educated and uneducated
 brahman or gaiyr-brahmanon kii tulana main zyada shikshit he
 Therefore, the government advocating for non-brahmins is also forced to recruit Brahmins in government jobs
 sarkaar brahmanon ke prati apane nirankush ravaiye ke baavjood, unhen prashasan main jagah de rahi he kyonki vah maanati he ki padhe likhe log hi prashasan chalaa sakate he
 In a conference organized to eradicate untouchability, Tilak had said, "if God also tolerates untouchability, then i will not believe in God
 ’’ Tilak's speeches made at that time do not reflect religious appeal from anywhere
 homerul kii maang puri tarah dharmanirpekshata par aadhaarit thi
 Tilak said that the reason for opposition from the British is not that he is a follower of any other religion, we oppose them because they are not doing any work in the interest of the Indian public
 tilak ke shabdon main, ‘‘angrej ho yaa musalmaan yadi vah is desh kii janata ke hit ke liye kaam karata he, to vah hamaare liye paraayaa nahin he
 This transgression has no relation with religion or occupation
 yah sidhe-sidhe hiton se jud prashn he
 Tilak intensified his campaign by bringing out six Marathi and two English pamphlets
 in parcho kii 47 hajaar parchiyaan bechi gayi
 Later these leaflets were printed in Gujarati and Kannada languages
 lig kii chah shakhaayen banaai gai
 One each in Central Maharashtra, Bombay City, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and two in Berar
 homerul aandolan ne jaise-jaise jor pakadana shuru kiya sarkaar ne damanaatmak kaarywahi tej kar di
 The government chose a special day to attack this movement
 23 july 1916 tilak kaa 60 wa janmdin tha
 a large gathering was organized and Tilak was presented a bag of one lakh rupees
 sarkaar ne is avasar par unhen doosraa inaam diya
 He was given a show cause notice
 jisamen likhaa tha ki aapaki gatividhiyon ke chalate aap par pratibandh kyon na laga diya jaae
 He was asked to fill a bond of sixty thousand rupees
 tilak ke liye shaayad sabase mahatvapurn uphaar tha
 He said, "now the Homerul movement will spread like fire in the forest
 sarkari daman vidroh kii aag ko or bhadakayegaa
 '' tilak kii ore se mohammad ali jinna ke netritv main vakeelon kii ek puri team ne mukaddama ladaa
 Tilak lost the case in the magistrate's court but in November he was declared innocent by the High Court
 is jeet kii sabhi ore saraahna hui
 Gandhi wrote in the 'young-india' newspaper, "this is a great victory for freedom of expression
 homerul aandolan ke liye ek bahut badi safalataa he
 "tilak took advantage of this opportunity and said in his public speeches that the government had given permission to express the demand for Homerul or self-government
" tilak or unke sahyogiyon ne prachaar kaary tej kar diya or april 1917 tak unhonen 14 hajaar sadsy bana liye
 The League of Anne Besant also started functioning from September 1916 but their organization was very loose
 koi bhi teen vyakti milakar kahin bhi shakha khol sakate the jabaki tilak kii lig kaa sanghathan bahut majboot tha, sabhi chah shakhaon ke kaam tathaa kaary lenaa nirdhaarit the
 Annie Besant had two hundred branches of the league
 bahut shakhaayen kasbe or nagaron main thim, baaki gaanvon main, ek shakha ke tahat kuchhek gaanv aate the
 Although the Executive Council was elected, the entire work was handled by Annie Besant and her colleagues Arudel, CD Ramaswamy Iyer and BP Wadia
 sadasyon ko nirdesh dene kaa koi sangathit tarika nahin tha
 Either instructions were given to the members individually or by reading Arudel's articles in New India, people knew what to do
 ani bessent kii lig tilak kii lig kii tulana main sadsy banane main peeche rahe
 As of March 1917, the number of members of his league was only 7000
 jawahar laal nehru, bi
chakravarti tathaa je
 banerjee bhi isse shaamil ho gaye
 At present it is difficult to estimate the strength of the League by counting the branches, some of them quite active and some inactive, as they were mostly limited to the activities of the Theosophical Society
 bataur udhaaharan, madras nagar main shakhaon kii sankhya sabase zyada thi, lekin bombay, uttar pradesh ke nagaron or gujarat ke gramin ilaakon kii shakhaayen kaaphi sakriy thi
 Although their number was quite small
 in sari gatividhiyon kaa ek maatra lakshya homerul kii maang ke liye bade paimaane par aandolan chhedana tha
 For this, it was very important to give political education and spark political debate
 arudel ne ‘newindia’ ke madhyam se apane samarthako ko raajnneetik bahes chhedane, rashtriya raajnneeti ke bare main jaankaree dene vaale pustakaalayon kii sthapana, chaatro ko raajnneetik shiksha dene ke liye kakshaon kaa aayojan, doston ke bich ‘homerul’ ke samarthan main tark dene tathaa unhone aandolan main bhagidaari banane ke liye kaary karne ko kaha
 Many branches implemented these
 raajnneetik bahes chalaane par visheshrup se dhyaan diya
 How fast the promotion of Homerule can be gauged from the fact that by September 1916, three lakh leaflets printed from the propaganda fund had been distributed
 yah prachaar fund kuch maheene pehle hi sthapit kiya tha
 In these cases, there was a crude letter from the then government and arguments were made in support of Swaraj
 ani bessent kii lig kii sthapana ke baad in parcho ko phir chapa gaya
 They were also published in many regional languages
 saath-saath jansabhaon kaa aayojan or bhaashanon kaa kram bhi jari rahaa
 Whenever nationwide resistance was called upon for any issue, all the branches of the League supported it
 navambar 1916 main, jab ani bessent par baraar va madhya praant main jane par pratibandh lagaaya gaya, to arudel kii apil par lig kii tamaam shakhaon ne virodh baithken yojit kii or vysarai tathaa grih sachiv ko virodh prastaav bheje
 Similarly, in 1917, when Tilak was banned from going to Punjab and Delhi, protest meetings were held all over the country
 lig kii tamaam shakhaon ne iskaa datakar virodh kiya
 Enraged by the inaction of Grace, many moderate Kan Gracie also joined the Homeroom movement
 gokhale kii ‘sarven t of india sosayadi’ ko lig kaa sadsy banane kii ijaajat nahin thi, lekin unhaan ne janata ke bich bhaashan dekar or parache baan takar ‘homerul aandolan’ kaa samarthan kiya
 Many moderate nationalists in Uttar Pradesh visited the village of Gao, along with Homerule League workers, in preparation for the Congress conference
 inaki zyaadaatar baithak sthaneey adaalaton ke pustakaalayon main hoti, jahaan chaatra, vyavsaayee tathaa anya pesho se jude hue log ikattha hote
 And if the meeting was held on a market day, the farmers who came from the villages would have attended it
 in baithkon main hindustan kii garibi or behaali kaa mudda uthaaya jaataa
 a reminder of the richness of the past and the freedom movement of You Rope was highlighted, it was appealed to take inspiration from it
 in baithkon main hindi bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 The moderates' support of the Home Rule League was not surprising as the League was implementing the political propaganda and academic programs of the moderates
 1916 main congress kaa lakhanu adhiveshan homerul lig ke sadasyon ke liye apni takat dikhaane kaa acha mauka tha
 Tilak's supporters have created a tradition on which the Congress has lived for many years
 unke samarthako ne lakhanu pahunchne ke liye ek train arakshit kii jise kuch logon ne ‘kagrence special’ kaa naam diya, to kuch ne ‘homerul special’ kaha
 Arudel had asked every member of the league to make every effort to become a member of the Lucknow session
 lakhanu congress adhiveshan main tilak ko punah congress main shaamil kar liya gaya
 President Ambika Charan Mazumdar said- isi adhiveshan main mahatvapurn ‘kaan gres lig’ samjhauta hua, jo ‘‘lakhanu pact’’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Annie Besant and Tilak played an important role in this agreement
 madanamohan malviya samet kai varisht netaa iske bilkul khilaaf the
 He alleged that this agreement gives much importance to the Muslim League
 tilak ne is aarope par kaha, ‘‘kuch mahanubhaavon kaa yah aarope he ki hindu apane musalmaan bhaiyon ko zyada tavajjo de rahe hai
 i say that if the right to self-government is given only to the Muslim community, then i would have no objection, if the ambassadors get this right, i do not care, Hindustan should give this right to any community, we have no objection
 meraa yah bayaan samu chi bhartiya rashtriya bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Whenever you are fighting a third party, the most important is mutual unity, ethnic unity, religious unity and unity of different political ideologies
 ’’ Tilak was considered a very orthodox Hindu
 vah bhartiya praachya vidya ke prakand vidwaan the
 When he made such a statement, no one dared to oppose anyone else
 haalaanki musalamaanon ke liye alag nirvachan kshetron ke siththant ko swikaarna, vivaadaaspad tha
 But it was accepted that these minorities should not feel that the majority wants to dominate them
 lakhanu adhiveshan main sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii maang phir uthaai
 Members believed that this demand would be helpful in achieving the goal of Swarajya
 haalanki is maang main ve sari chijen shaamil nahin thi, jaisaa ki homerul lig ke sadsy chaahate the, lekin unhonen is par koi vivaad khadaa nahin kiya
 In any case, he wanted to maintain unity in the Congress
 tilak ne ek or prastaav rakhaa ki congress adhiveshan ke nirnyon tathaa kaaryakramon ko asaliroop dene ke liye ek kaaryakarini kaa gathan kiya jaae
 But this proposal could not be accepted due to opposition from moderates
 vastav main tilak chaahate the ki congress akarmanya na rahe, thodaa or kaam karen
 Tilak's proposal could not be accepted, but four years later, in 1920, when Mahatma Gandhi revised the Congress's constitution and gave it a new look - a form that was necessary to keep a movement going for a long time - he also got Tilak's It was considered necessary to accept this proposal
 congress adhiveshan kii samaapti ke turant baad usee pandal main donon homerul ligon kii baithak hui
 In which about one thousand delegates participated
 congress lig samjhaute kii saraahna kii gai or tilak tathaa ani bessent ne baithak ko sambodhit kiya
 While returning from Lucknow, these two leaders visited many areas of North, Central and Eastern India
 homerul aandolan ke badhate prabhaav ko dekhakar sarkaar kaa chintit hona swaabhaavik tha
 The Madras government became more rigid
 usne chaatro ke raajnneetik baithkon main bhaag lene par pratibandh laga diya
 It was opposed in the whole state
 tilak ne kaha, ‘‘sarkaar ko maaloom he ki desh prem kii bhaavana chaatro ko zyada uttejit karti he
 Anyway, any country can progress only with the strength of the youth
 madras sarkaar ne june 1917 main ani bessent, george arudel tathaa ve

 There were nationwide protests against it
 sar subrahmanyam ayyar ne sarkari oopaadhi asweekaar kar di
 All moderate leaders like Madan Mohan Malaviya, Surendranath Banerjee and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who were not yet in the league, joined it and raised their voice against the arrest of Annie Besant and other leaders? On 26 July 1917, Tilak said in a meeting to Congress that if the government does not immediately release these people, then a peaceful non-cooperation movement should be launched
 is prastaav ko sabhi prantiya congress samitiyon ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya
 The Congress committees of Berar and Madras were in favor of immediate action on this, but the other committees were in favor of waiting a little before taking any decision
 gandhiji ke kehane par shankaralal baikar or jamanadas dwarkaprasad ne aise ek hajaar logon ke dastakhat ikatthe kiye jo sarkari adeshon kii avhelnaa karke juluus kii shakl main jaakar ani bessent se milanaa chaahate the
 These people started signing farmers and laborers in support of Swaraj
 gujarat ke kasbon or gaavon kaa daura kiya or vahaan lig kii shakhaayen sthapit karne main madad kii
 There was an unexpected increase in the number of members of the Home Rule League
 is prakaar sarkari daman ne aandolan ko or badhaava diya, aandolankariyon ko or jujharu banaaya
 Montague writes in his diary, "shiva cut his wife into 52 pieces, the same happened to him when the Indian government arrested Annie Besant
" ’’ After these events, the Government of England changed its policies
 ab uskaa ruukh samjhautavaadi ho gaya
 The new Home Secretary Montague made a historic announcement in the House of Commons, "it is the policy of British rule to make the Indian public a partner in the administration of India and the gradual development of various institutions for self-government so that anyone associated with the British Empire in India a responsible government can be established
 ’’ yah bayaan marle ke bayaan se ekadam vipareet tha
 While keeping constitutional reforms in Parliament in 1909, Marley had clearly stated that the aim of these reforms is not to establish self-rule in the country
 mantague kii ghoshnaa kaa sabase bada phayda yah hua ki ab homerul yaa swaraj kii maang ko deshadrohi nahin kaha ja saktaa tha
 But it also did not mean that the British rule was going to accept the demand of Swaraj
 mantague kii ghoshnaa main yah baat bhi thi ki swashaasan kii sthapana tabhi hogi, jab uskaa uchit samay aayega or samay aayaa he yaa nahin iskaa faisla hukumat karegi
 This was enough for the British rule

 Currently Annie Besant was released in September 1917 due to the announcement of Montague

 In December 1917, at the annual session of the Congress, he was elected president on the proposal of Tilak
 lekin 1918 main anek kaarnon se homerul kamjor pad gaya, 1917 main baari safalataa milane ke baavjood yah aandolan mritpraaya ho gaya
 Moderates had joined the movement, agitated by the arrest of Annie Besant, became inactive after his release

 Hence, he had to stop attending congress meetings from September 1918 onwards
 1918 main sudhaar yojanaon kii ghoshnaa se rashtravyapee kheme main ek or daraar pad gai
 Some people were in favor of accepting it as-is and some wanted to reject it completely
 kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki isamen kai kamiyaan to hai par isamen aajmaana chahie
 Annie Besant herself was in a dilemma on the issue of these reforms and the peaceful non-cooperation movement
 kabhi to vah ise galat kahati or kabhi apane samarthakon ke dabaav ke kaaran thik kahati
 Initially Annie Besant with Tilak said that the Indian public should not accept these reform schemes, it is an insult to him, but later he appealed to accept it
 tilak kaaphi samay tak apane nirnay par adig rahe
 But due to the changed policies of Annie Besant and the moderation of the moderates, he was unable to pull the movement carriage and went to England towards the end of the year, opposing reforms on his own
 vahaan unhone indian anarest ke lekhak chirao par manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar rakhaa tha
 He stayed in England for several months as a result of the trial of this case
 ani bessent ek shashakt netritv dene main asamarth thi or tilak videsh main the
 As a result, the Home Rule Movement became devoid of leadership

 Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, these militant movements moved forward with the torch of independence
 homerul aandolan ne, uttarapradesh, gujarat, sindh, madras, madhyaprant tathaa baraar jaise anek nae kshetron ko rashtriya aandolan main shaamil kiya
 Thus the Homerul movement did not go in vain

 This movement awakened the sleeping Indians and instilled complete awakening among them

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis

 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world
