 Early developments The first purely practical application of chromatography was early dye chemists who tested their dye mixture by dipping wire or pieces of cloth or filter paper into a dye vat

 Imagine the Martin and Synge gel made of finely solid functions as silica gel, and as water made of tightly bonded silica crystals; The mobile phase was chloroform

 Although their method was mechanically similar with Tsvet's approach, it was innovative in that it included the concept of a stable liquid supported on an inert solid, with the result that the solute molecules split between the stationary liquid and a different mobile liquid phase

 At the time, Martin and Synge suggested that the well may contain a gas in the moving phase

 In 1952, the Martin and Synge Nobel Prize was awarded for their work, perhaps not so much for the novelty of the technique, but for suggesting a applicability to a model that suggests amino acids and peptide partitioning with other systems, a mathematical theory, and far-reaching bio
 Has an effect on chemical studies
 praarambhik vibhaajan-chrometography pranali silica jail or stambhon kii packing main ekarupata kii kami ke gunon main raproduchablity kii kami kii vajah se kathinaaiyon prastut kiya
 Partly for this reason, Martin and his colleagues worked out a new process in which a sheet of stationary medium filter paper was worked out
 kaagaj pani celulos ko bandhua ke rup main, ek or vibhaajan vidhi pradaan karne ke bare main sochaa tha
 The technique gave desired reproducibility, and paper of the 1940s initially found wide application in the analysis of biologically important compounds, such as amino acids, steroids, carbohydrates, and bile pigments

 The results of Soviet studies were reported in 1938, but the potential of the method was not widely realized until 1956, when German chemist Egon Staal began intensive research on its application

 Yet another chromatographic technique, gas chromatography, was first carried out in Austria in 1944 by chemist Erica Kramer, who used a solid stationary phase

 'adsorption' and 'solubility': affinity, in turn, is determined by the two properties of the molecule
 ham kaise acchhee tarah se mishran kaa ek ghatak sthir charan ke liye lathi kii sampatti ke rup sokhna paribhaashit kar sakate hai, jabaki ghulanshiltaa kaise acchhee tarah se mishran kaa ek ghatak mobile charan main ghul kii sampatti he
 The higher the stationary phase adsorption, the slower the molecule will move through the column
 ucchtar mobile charan main ghulanshiltaa, teji se anu kollam ke madhyam se kadam hoga
 So, the interplay between the above two factors determines the differential rates at which different components of the oblique will move through the column
 sokhna or ek anu kii ghulanshiltaa uchit sthir charan or mobile charan chunane ke dwaara chaalaaki se kiya ja saktaa he
 In chromatography, a liquid is pumped through a bed of particles

 a mixture of molecules that will be separated is introduced in the mobile phase
 nile rang ke anuon neeche anemeshan main laal anuon se alag kiya jayega or anuon ke in do prakaar se yukt ek mishran sthir charan ke saamne mobile charan main shuru kii he
 The mixture of red and blue molecules is then transported from the mobile phase through the stationary phase

 Red molecules separate from blue
 chrometography ke vibhinn prakaar In this article, we are dealing with what we refer to as normal phase chromatography which means that our stationary phase is polar in nature and our mobile phase is non-polar in nature

 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more

 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya

 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
 with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out, "you are more than a man, you are sawa- ie, a hundred and twenty five per cent hero ' kuch duusare strot batalaate hai 'savai' kii oopaadhi aurangzeb dwaara nahin balki badshaah farrukh sier dwaara inhen di gayi thi

After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made

 jaisingh ne badshaah farrukh sier ko bahut samajhaayaa ki saiyadon se yuddh karke unhen hameshaa ke liye saaf kar dena chahie
 At that time, 20 thousand Rajput riders were present in Delhi and Buddha Singh Hada of Bundi was also with them
 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya
 Jaisingh warned the emperor that his departure would threaten the emperor's life, but this advice was not understood by the emperor

 Finally, At Singh took Jaisingh with him to Jodhpur where he married his daughter to Jaisingh
 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden
 Even at that time, Jai Singh did not believe in At Singh Jodhpur, so he wore Jirhabkhtar even in his marriage

 He gave him a big welcome

 inhone deepasingh kumbhani ko sahu ke paas satara bheja
 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
 isse rajasthan main jaipur or bundi ke bich lambe samay tak bada du:khad sangharsh chalaa

 unhone kaha ki yah moulik dharmik bhaavana bharat main pakshi adhyayan ke vikaas main ek baadha tha
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics
