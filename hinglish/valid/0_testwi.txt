 In the dark India of the 19th century, sage Dayanand's country was very extensive among the nobles who awakened the light of awakening
 ve yug-pravartak rishi the, jinhone shiksha, raajnneeti, samaaj-sanghathan aadi sab kshetron main nae vichaaron kaa sandesh diya
 Rishi Dayanand experienced many defects in the education system prevalent in his time and presented the ancient Arya education system
 rishi ne use 'gurukul shiksha-pranali' kaa naam diya
 There were mainly two systems of education prevalent in India during his time - one was started by the British rulers of India and the other was prevalent in the Pandit congregation according to the old tradition
 sarkaar dwaara prachlit pranali bharat ke rashtriya tathaa dharmik aadarshon kepratikul thi
 In it, the language, religion, civilization, literature and culture of India were completely ignored
 pandit mandali kii shiksha-paddati samay kii aavashyaktaaon ko purna nahin karti thi usamen vartmaan yug ke gyaan-vigyaanon ko koi sthaan praapt nahin hi tha vah paakhandon kaa poshan karti thi
 The ideals that are required for character building, celibacy, renunciation, austerity, etc
, did not have importance in both systems
 rishi dayanand ne anubhav kiya ki bharat main pracheen gurukul pranali kaa punaruddhar kar in dosha ko dur kiya janaa chahie
 He presented the ideals and principles of education in the third group of 'satyarth Prakash' - Undoubtedly, the thoughts of Rishi Dayanand were very revolutionary ideas in the field of education
 rishi dayanand ke ek pramukh shishy mahatma munshi ram ne san 1897 main unhone gurukul ko prarambh karne kii aavashyaktaa ke nimnlikhit kaaran bataae - In the 19th century, two types of education were prevalent in India
 pehali paddati british sarkaar dwaara apane shashan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye viksit kii gai sarkari skulon or vishvavidhyalayon kii pranali thi or duusari sanskrit, vyakaran, darshan aadi bhartiya vaanmay kii vibhinn vidyaon ko pracheen paramparaagat vidhi se adhyayan karne kii paathshaala paddati
 There were some serious flaws in both methods
 pehali paddati main paurasty gyanvigyaan kii ghor apeksha thi or yah sarvatha arashtriya thi
 Lord Macaulay, who was an ardent proponent of this and enforced it by his well-known memorial in 1835, believed that 'the importance of books lying in one of the almari of a good European library was equal to the entire literature of India and Arabia'
 at: sarkari shiksha paddati main bhartiya vaanmay kii ghor upeksha karte hue angreji tathaa paashchaatya sahitya or gyaan vigyaan ke adhyayan par bal diya gaya
 The main objective of this education system was, in Macaulay's words, 'to create a group of Indians who are Indian in color and blood, but English in terms of interest, temper and pickle'
 isliye yah shikshapaddati bharat ke rashtriya or dharmik aadarshon ke pratikul thi
 The second education system was the school system practiced in Panditamandali
 isamen yadhyapi bhartiya vaanmay kaa adhyayan karaayaa jaataa tha, tathaapi usamen naveen tathaa vartmaan samay ke liye aavashyak gyaan vigyaan kii ghor upeksha thi
 At that time the great need of the country was to develop a national education system in harmony with the excellent elements of both education systems while coordinating the puerile and western knowledge science
 is mahatvapurn kaary kaa sampann karne main gurukul kongdi ne bada sahyog diya
 Mahatma Munshiram, the founder of the Gurukul, was greatly influenced by the educational ideas propounded in the famous book 'satyarth Prakash' by Maharishi Dayanand, the originator of the Aryasamaj, who had extraordinary significance in the Indian cultural renaissance of the last century
 unhone 1897 main apane patr 'saddharm prachaarak' dwaara gurukul shiksha pranali ke punarudwar kaa prabal andolan aarambh kiya
 On 30 October 1898, he laid out a detailed plan for it
 november, 1898 i
 main punjab ke aryasamaajon ke kendriya sanghathan arya pratinidhi sabha ne gurukul kholane kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya or mahatma munshiram ne yah pratigya kii ki ve is kaary ke liye, jab tak 30,000 rupaya ekatra nahin kar lenge, tab tak apane ghar main pair nahin rakhenge
 Under the circumstances, he completed this daunting task in eight months with his relentless industry and unwavering loyalty
 16 may 1900 ko punjab ke gujaranvaala sthaan par ek vaidic paathshaala ke saath gurukul kii sthapana kar di gai
 But Mahatma Munshiram did not find this place suitable
 ve shukla yajurveda ke ek mantra 'uphvare girinan sangame c nadinaan
 According to Dhia Wipro Ajayat 'they wanted a place near river and mountain
 isi samay nazibabad ke dharmanishth rais munshi amansingh ji ne is kaary ke liye mahatma munshiram ji ko 1,200 bighas kaa apana kangri gram daan diya
 The Kangri land surrounded by densely forested forests on the banks of the Ganges in the Himalayas was ideal for Gurukuls
 at: yahan ghaney jangal saaf kar kuch chappar banaae gaye or holi ke din somvaar, 4 march 1902 ko gurukul gujaranvaala se kangri laayaa gaya
 The Gurukul was started in some thatched huts with 34 students

 Its college department started in 1907 AD
 1912 i

 At this time, the British government considered it a seditious institution for a long time, being completely independent from the influence of the government

 Taking inspiration from it in different parts of the country, many gurukuls following its ideals and curriculum were established

 In 1935 AD, a separate Vidyasabha was organized to manage it under Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab
 gurukul shiksha paddati kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai- vidhyaarthiyon kaa guruon ke sampark main, unke kul yaa parivaar kaa ang banakar rahanaa, bahmacharyapurvak saral evam tapasyamay jivan bitaana, charitranirmaan or shaareerik vikaas par bauddhik evam maansik vikaas kii bhanti puraa dhyaan dena, shiksha main sanskrit ko anivaary bananaa, vaidic vaanmay ke adhyayan par bal dena, shiksha kaa madhyak maatrubhaasha hindi ko bananaa, sanskrit, darshan, veda aadi pracheen vishyon ke adhyayan ke saath aadhunik paashchaatya gyaan vigyaan or angreji kii padhai tathaa rashtriyata kii bhaavana
 Nowadays these characteristics have become universally accepted, but at the beginning of this century all these ideas were completely revolutionary, new and original
 gurukul shiksha kii katipay visheshtaayen nimnlikhit he: From the very beginning, all subjects were taught in Hindi through Hindi medium
 vigyaan, ganit, paashchaatya darshan aadi vishay bhi hindi main hi padhaaye jate the
 When the college department opened in 1907, Hindi was kept as a medium
 us samay hindi main ucch shiksha dena ek asambhav baat samajhi jaati thi
 Gurukul showed this by turning it into action
 us samay aadhunik vidwaanon kii pustaken hindi main nahin thi
 The Gurukul students first worked in this field and many Gurukul texts were published
 pro maheshacharan singh kii 'hindi chemistry', pro saathe kaa 'vikaswad', shriyut govardhan kii 'bhautikee' or 'rasayan' pro ramshrandas saxena kaa 'gunatmak vishleshan', pro sinha kaa 'vanaspatishaastra' pro prannath kaa 'arthshaastra', 'rashtriya aay-vyay shaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', pro baalkrishna kaa 'arthshaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', or pro sudhakar kaa 'manovigyaan' hindi main apane-apane vishay ke pehle granth hai
 The creation of scientific texts in Hindi was started by Gurukul
 in vaigyanik granthon ke atirikt anya bhi bahut se ucchkoti ke granth gurukul dwaara prakashit hue
 Prof
 Ramdev did his basic research on Indian history and published his famous 'history of India'
 mahatma munshi raamji ne bhi vividh dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kar moulik granth likhe
 In 1918, the President of the University of Calcutta, Dr
 Sadler, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, visited Gurukul
 gurukul kaa avlokan karke ve bahut prabhavit hue
 He expressed his views regarding Gurukul in one of his letters - us yug ke ek prasiddh vidwaan shri nivas shastri ucch shiksha ke madhyam ke rup main angreji ke k͠r samarthak the, par gurukul kaa kaary santoshprad paane par unhone kaha - 'meraa apana vichaar yah rahaa he ki vidhyalay vibhaag main shiksha kaa madhyam bhartiya bhashaayen hi rahani chahie, parantu mahavidhyalay vibhaag kii padhai angreji ke madhyam dwaara honi chahie
 But now seeing the Gurukul, i am moving away from this idea of mine
 maikale ke baad bharat main shiksha ke kshetra main jo sabase mahatvapurn or moulik praytn hua, vah gurukul he - remje macdnold The great curiosity of Gurukul Kangri was to make these ideas acceptable by his functional test
 pehle yah asambhav samajha jaataa tha ki hindi ucch shiksha evam vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan adhyaapan kaa madhyam ban sakati he
 Gurukul first made this idea possible in modern India through his trial
 yahan adhyapakon tathaa praadhyaapakon ne rasayan, bhautik vigyaan, vanaspati shaastra, manovigyaan, vikaswad aadi vishyon par hindi main pehali pustaken likhin
 The scientific writing of Hindi got a great boost from the fact that Gurukul Kangdi made Hindi a medium for education in all subjects including science and accordingly 17 books were also implemented
 maatrubhaasha dwaara shiksha ke is pareekshan ko dekhne ke liye 1918 i

 The Gurukul participated prominently in all national and social reform movements
 hindi sahitya ko anek yashasvi patrkaar, lekhak or saahitiyik pradaan kiye
 The practice of Sanskrit and Vedic poetry gave special encouragement to teaching and learning
 is gurukul se nikle hue snaatak hindi ke pratham shrenee ke lekhak siddh hue or unhone hindi ko mahamoolyawaan sahitya diya

 This university has three campuses- rangamanch vah sthaan he jahaan nrity, naatak, khel aadi hon
 The word theater is made up of the combination of the words color and stage

 The entire building, including the auditorium and theater, where the audience sits, is called the auditorium, theater, or theater
 pashchimi deshon main ise theatre yaa opera naam diya jaataa he
 It is believed that the development of drama first took place in India
 rugveda ke katipay sutron main yama or yami, pururava or urvashi aadi ke kuch samvaad hai
 In these dialogues people find the sign of the development of the play
 anumaan kiya jaataa he ki inhen sanvaadon se prerana grahan kar laagon ne naatak kii rachana kii or natyakala kaa vikaas hua
 Bharathamuni gave him a classical form as soon as possible
 bharat muni ne apane naatyashaastra main naatakon ke vikaas kii prakriya ko is prakaar vyakt kiya he: No matter how the plays were developed, the Natya Granth and many classical texts related to it were written in Sanskrit literature and Hindi was also followed by the practice of writing plays in Sanskrit
 sanskrit naatak utkrisht koti ke hai or ve adhiktar abhinay karne ke uddeshy se likhe jate the
 There were also plays, but rather the drama was an integral part of the life of ancient Indians, it is known from the investigation of Sanskrit and Pali texts
 kautilya ke arthshaastra se to aisa gyaat hota he ki naagarik jivan ke is ang par rajya ko niyantran karne kii aavashyaktaa pad gai thi
 An ancient description of the theater is found in it
 agnipurana, shilparatna, kavyamimasaa tathaa sangeetamartand main bhi rajprasad ke natyamandapon ke vivaran praapt hote hai
 Similarly, there is mention of Rangshala in Mahabharata and drama is played in Harivansh Purana and Ramayana
 itnaa sab hote hue bhi yah nishchit rup se pataa nahin lagata ki ve naatak kis prakaar ke natyamandapon main khele jate the tathaa un mandapon ke kya rup the
 As a result of the discovery so far, no such house can be called the authority Natyamandap except Sitavanga Cave
 paashchaatya vidwaanon kii bhi dharna he ki dharmik krityon se hi naatakon kaa pradurbhaav hua
 From this, the initial form of Rangasthali can be imagined that she must have been narrating
 dhire-dhire jab darshneeyata kii ore adhik dhyaan diya gaya hoga, tab yah anubhav kiya gaya hoga ki is vrittakar rangasthali main keval aage ke kuch darshak kii drishy kaa puraa anand uthaa sakate hai, peeche baithanevaalon ko sir uthaane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 From this point of view, the place of kataranuma must have been considered more suitable for Rangasthali
 dharmik krityon or nrity aadi ke liye yah uttam prabandh tha
 Gradually as the form of the plays developed more, it would have been felt that the narrator and the actors have good facility to see and hear only those who sit in front of them
 iske liye parvatiy sthanon main ghati bahut upyukt prathit hui hogi, jisamen dhaal par baithe darshak neeche abhinaytaon ko bhalee bhanti dekh sun sakate the or unke peeche failaa hua vistrut bhukhand sahaj sundar chitrit prakritik prishthbhumi prastut karata tha
 Perhaps this was followed by an unnatural background
 shaayad isi kaa anukaran aparvatiy sthanon main kritrim rangashalas banaakar kiya gaya, jinamein vrittakar diwaar ke andar seedhinuma sthaan darshakon ke baithne ke liye hota tha, jo bheetar bane unche chabutare ko teen ore se ghere rahata tha

 iske peeche nepathy hota tha
 Where the actors used to get up and manage their appearance

 Over time, the auditorium remained in front of only one side, instead of three

 From the 10th to the 13th century, biblical stories became the mainstay of acting, then gradually other stories also came, but these plays remained independent
 chir pratishthit rangamanch, jo europe bhar main jagah jagah toote phute pade the, phir na apanaae gaye
 The current theater was born with the Italian Renaissance, but at a time where all other arts were revived throughout Europe, theater had to see its infancy again

 The highly decorated dances of royal palaces culminated in dramatic theater

 The development of the theater is clearly reflected in the theater in Vicenza and Parma

 In this, many chambers like the back walls were enlarged
 san 1588 main savioneta main scamozi ne in kakshon ko mukhya rangamanch se mila diya or dhire-dhire baad main ve bhi rangamanch hi ho gaye
 Later, in 1618-19, the entire theater at Parma Theater was reversed and the painted wall of the background came forward, on which the play can be seen from a large gate in the middle

 When the curtain rises, the scene looks like a picture in a frame

 Shakespeare dominated from 1590 to 1620 AD

 But it was also opposed by the Protestat sect and consequently, the art of Natya was banned in 1642 AD

 It reflected the nature of the old dharamshalas, where earlier plays were played

 As the theater of all Europe was moving towards democracy, the United States, USA, was developing independent life of its own kind
 charlston, philadelphia, neuyork or boston ke rangamanchon par landan kaa prabhaav bilkul nahin padaa
 Yet American theaters had no notable features
 unke saamaanya rangamanch ghumantu companiyon ke se hi hote the
 But by the end of the 18th century a number of excellent katiyas were built, including the Chestnut Street Theater in Philadelphia and the Park Theater in New York
 inamen sundar prekshagrih bane or kuch europea prabhaav bhi aa gaya
 Subsequently, in 20-25 years, the Amarki theater became equivalent to, but even better than, the European theater

 From the point of view of construction, the composition of iron structures, the progress of science, the possibilities of electric light and the compulsory observance of the rules related to construction are mainly the root causes of this progress
 saamaajik or aarthik dasha main parivartan hone se bhi kuch sudhaar hua he
 Only a few years ago theaters, which essentially consisted of pillars, balconies and galleries, are now considered ancient

 Every spectator sitting in the auditorium should have the facility to look directly up to the theater, so special care is taken of the appropriate shield

 In thermodynamics and physicochemical, thermodynamics is the study of the energy produced or exploited in a chemical reaction
 ushmarsayan main praaia: urja ke shoshan yaa utsarjan ke parinamswaroop hone vaale bhautik parivartan aadi) kaa bhi adhyayan shaamil he
 Along with this, heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of manufacture, enthalpy and free energy are also calculated
 saadharantaya kisi pratikriya main kshepit yaa shoshit ushma ko uske sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar dete hai
 for example : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories It is dissolved that when combining with 1 gram-molecule hydrogen gas and 1 gram-molecule chlorine gas, when 2 gram-molecule hydrochloric acid gas is formed, 44,000 calories of heat are lost
 isi prakaar nimnaankit sameekaran dekhie : H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories dwaara yah prakat hota he ki yadi 2 gram hydrogen tathaa 254 gram iodine gas ke sangyojan se 256 gram hydrogen iodide gas banaai jaae to is pratikriya main 11,860 calories ushma shoshit hogi
 It is clear that the amount of heat absorbed in any activity will depend on the physical state of the substances participating in it; That is why it is also written
 bhautik avasthaa kaa jo prabhaav pratikriya-ushma par padataa he vah nimnaankit udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega : And dwitiya sameekaran main ushma kii kshepit maatra pratham samikarnon kii apeksha adhik he kyonki isamen 18 gram bhaap ke dravit hone main kshepit ushma kii maatra sammilit he
 For reactions in which the volume of the reactors also changes, the reaction heat will also depend on whether the reaction is done at constant volume or at constant pressure
 yadi pratikriya karte samay aaytan sthir rakhaa jaae, to mandal ko bahya daab ke viruddh kuch kaary nahin karnaa padataa
 Therefore, at constant volume, the real energy of the reaction is absorbed or absorbed
 parantu yadi kriya karte samay daab ko sthir rakhte hue aaytan ko badhane yaa ghatane diya jaae, to pratikriya-ushma kaa yatharth maan gyaat nahin hoga
 for example; In increasing the volume, the board works against external pressure, which will have energy expenditure; Therefore, if the reaction is exothermic, the amount of radiation will be reduced at this stage
 saadhaarant: pratikriyaaon kii ushma sthir aaytan par hi naapi jaati he
 From the thermodynamic point of view, reactions are often divided into several classes and are named reaction-heat to suit the reaction nature - such as solution-heat, dilution-heat, production-heat, combustion-heat, and relaxation-heat
 kisi viley ko vilaayak main gholne par praaia: ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The salts that react with water to form hydrated salts, most of the heat is absorbed when they dissolve
 anya lavenon ke ghulne main kshepit ushma kii maatra bahut kam he
 The amount of energy absorbed or absorbed when a gram-molecule of a substance is dissolved in a solvent is called solution-heat
 iske atirikt sandra vilyan ko tanu karne main bhi ushma main parivartan hota he or ise vilyan kii tanukaran-ushma kehete hai
 The volume of dilution-heat decreases with the dilution of the solutions and can be considered as zero for more dilute solutions
 aise tanu vilyanon kii ushmarsayan main "jaleey" kehete hai
 for example; Potassium nitrate dissolves in water to form a highly concentrated solution, so its solution heat is 8,500 calories
 is tathy ko nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : The amount of heat that is absorbed or absorbed in the formation of a gram-molecule of a compound by the addition of element elements is called the production-heat of that compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnaankit samikarnon dwaara spasht he ki carbon dioxide, methen, tathaa nitric amla kii utpaadan-ushma kramnusaar 94

 Most compounds are exothermic, such as hydrogen, chloride, water, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride, etc
 are all exothermic compounds
 ushmashoshak yogicon ke udhaaharan hydrogen iodide, carbon dicelaphid, aesetilin, ozone aadi die ja sakate hai
 Thermodynamic compounds are much less stable than exothermic compounds and are easily dissected into their elemental elements
 ushmakshepak or ushmashoshak yogicon ke sthayitv kaa uparyukt bhed unamem antarnihit urja ke antar ke kaaran hota he
 for example; When 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide is formed by combining 1 gram-molecule carbon and 1 gram-molecule oxygen, 94,300 calories of heat are absorbed
 spasht he ki apane avyav tatwon kii apeksha 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide main 94,300 calories urja kam hogi
 Similarly, in a calorific compound like carbon disulfide, it will have 22,000 calories more energy than its element elements
 yadi samast tatwon kii antarnihit urja ko shunya maan liya jaae, to upyukt vivechan se spasht he ki yogicon kii antarrihit urja unki utpaadan ushma ke baraabar hogi; parantu yadi utpaadan urja rinatmak he to antarnihit urja dhanatmak hogi or iske vipareet yadi utpaadan ushma dhanatmak ho, to antarnihit urja rinatmak hogi
 For example, the underlying energies of carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide would be equal to 94,300 and 22,000 calories respectively
 kisi tatv yo yogic kii 1 gram-anu maatra ko oxigen main sthir aaytan par purnataya jalaane se ushma kii jo maatra kshepit hoti he, use us tatv yaa yogic kii dahan-ushma kehete hai
 For example, it is clear from the following equation that combustion-heat of methane is 2,12,800 calories: carbon ko oxigen main jalaane par do yogicon kaa bananaa sambhav he- It is worth noting that the combustion heat of carbon is 94,300 calories, not 26,000 calories, because carbon is completely burned or oxidized in the first act itself
 duusari kriya main carbon, carbon monoksaide main parivartit ho gaya he, parantu abhi uskaa dahan purna nahin hua kyonki carbon monoksaide kaa or dahan karke use carbon dioxide main oxykrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a special type of colorimeter is used to find combustion heat called bomb-colorimeter

 After this, close the vam firmly and keep it in an ordinary colorimeter
 saadhaaran calorimapak main jal kii ek nishchit maatra le lee jaati or prayog dwaara pehle hi yah nirdhaarit kar liya jaataa he ki is calorimapak main jal ke taap ko 1 degree centegrade badhaane ke liye kitni ushma kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The temperature of the water is measured in the external colorimeter
 ab platinum ke taron a tathaa a dwaara lohe ke ek maheen taar t main vidyut pravaahit karte hai
 The wire becomes red by heating the current and the substance placed in the cup starts to oxidize
 lohe ke taar ke jalane main tathaa oxikaran kii is kriya main ushma kshepit hoti he, jisaki maatra bahya calorimapak main upasthit jal ke taap main vruddhi se gyaat kar lee jaati he
 The amount of heat absorbed by combustion of a substance can be found by subtracting the heat absorbed by the burning of iron from the amount of heat obtained from this experiment
 spasht he ki is prayog main mandal kaa aaytan sthir rahata he; atev is vidhi se kisi padaarth kii dahan-ushma nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 The amount of heat that is coated when a gram-equivalent amount of alkali is relaxed by a gram-equivalent amount of acid is called senescence-heat
 yadi amla tathaa kshar itane tanu vilyanon main liye jaaen ki ve purnataya yanon main vighatit hon to shithilikaran kii kriya keval hydrogen tathaa hydroxil yanon ke sanyog se avighatit anu banane kii kriya hogi
 Therefore, in dilute solutions, the heat of relaxation of strong bases by all strong acids will be the same
 prayog dwaara is ushma kaa maan 13,700 calories aata he
 Hence, the relaxation of strong alkali by strong acids can be expressed by the following equations: jahaan x koi mulak he or m koi dhaatu he, Ie arthath But if acid or alkali is weak, it will not completely dissolve in the dilute solution
 atev aise amlon yaa kshaaron kii shithilikaran ushma 13,700 calories nahin aegi
 For example, ionization-heat of ammonium hydroxide is -1,500 calories, so ammonium hydroxide and the relaxing heat of a strong acid would be 12,200 calories
 prayog dwaara shithilikaran ushma ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye saadhaarant: ek tharmas flask main kshar ke tanu vilyan kii ek nishchit maatra lekar flask ko sthir tapawale jal main dubaakar rakhte hai, jisase vikiran dwaara flask ke bheetar vilyan ke taap main antar na ho
 Now, by taking an equivalent amount of acid in the solution, they stabilize its temperature equal to the temperature of alkali
 amla kaa taap sthir ho jane par use shighrata se kshar main mila dete hai
 The highest temperature of the solution is measured by running a solution of a boiler
 ab yadi mishra vilyan kii maatra, uski vishisht-ushma, taap, prayukt flask kii ushmadharita gyaat ho, to shithilikaran kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra sugamawa se gyaat kii ja sakati he
 By the same method, the salts-heat of salts can also be removed easily

 According to this rule, hes kaa niyam ushma-rasayan main bahut upyogi siddh hua he
 With this help, heat-changes in non-direct reactions can also be removed indirectly
 udhaaharan ke liye; saadhaarant: carbonic yogicon kii utpaadan-ushma pratyaksh kriya dwaara nahin nikaali ja sakati, parantu carbonic yogic tathaa iske avyav tatwon kii dahan-ushma ko nirdhaarit karke yogic kii utpaadan-ushma hes ke niyam se nikaal sakate hai
 Energy derived from chemical activities has been the means of running our industries

 Boron compounds are proving very useful in this direction, because they have higher combustion heat than the same amount of carbon compounds and they are able to give us more energy
 ushmarsayan ke anya upyog bahut kaal se hote aae hai
 For example, the first table shows the highest production-heat of aluminum oxide
 isi gun kaa upyog golddeshmit kii ushman vidhi main kiya gaya he
 Reaction due to the high heat-production of aluminum oxide, main itani adhik ushma kshepit hoti he ki mandal kaa taap lagbhag 3,000 centegrade tak pahunch jaataa he or loha tak pigal jaataa he
 Thus the broken rail tracks can also be joined by melting the broken parts of heavy machines with the help of the above mentioned action
