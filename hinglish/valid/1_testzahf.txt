 All these countries share the same state, ruler, royal family and succession order
 is vyavastha kii shuruyaat 1931 kii westminster kii sanvidhi ke saath hui thi, jiske dwaara britain ke tatkaaleen dominian, australia, canada, newzealand, irish mukt rajya or newfoundland ko british rashtramandal ke baraabar ke sadsy hone ke saath hi purna yaa purnatmat vaidhik swatantraaa pradaan kii gayi thi
 Since the Second World War, all countries of the British Empire, extended around the world, were granted independence as a Dominion
 jiname se kuch rajyon ne purnatah swadhin hone ke baavjood rajtantr ke prati apni vafadaari ko barqaraar rakhaa, jabaki kuch rajyon ne british rajtantr ko nammaatr pramukh maanane se inkaar kar swayan ko ganatantric rajya ghoshit kar diya
 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he
 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present
 atah in pradeshon kaa bodh karne hetu, kisi raja ke adheen bhoomi kaa bodh karaane vaale kisi bhi shabd kaa upyog kiya jaasakata he
 Ordinarily, words like prajbhoomi, pradesh, and paribhumi are used, besides these, the terms mandal and rajbhumi can also be used

 rajmukut athwa da crown kii vyavastha ek vishesh raajnneetik sankalpana he, jisaki britain tathaa anya rashtramandal pradeshon ke vidhishastra tathaa rajatantric vyavastha main atimahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress
 ek santhaan ke rup main, rajmukut, britain kii raajnneetikvyavastha kaa sabase purana kaaryshil santhaan he
 The concept of Rajmukut in each Commonwealth region is the same, but divided legal concepts

 The rights of the crown are exercised either by the superintendent himself or by his representative, on the advice of the ministers or officials concerned
 rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he kii uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi bidhan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he
 This obligation was imposed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he, jinamein bill of ritis, 1689, act of setlement, 1701 or act of union, 1707 shaamil hai
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 uttaradhikaar sambandhit niyam keval sansadeey adhinium dwaara parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he
 After sitting on the throne, a person rules till his death

 The last time a ruler was involuntarily expelled was James VII and II in 1688 who were expelled at the time of the Glorious Revolution

 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 1701 ke act of setlement ke vidhaanon ke anusaar, james pratham kii potee, hanover kii electress, sofia, ke "vaid" protostant vanshaj hi singhasana ko uttaradhikrut karne ke liye sakasham hai
 That is, only legitimate children of the royal family's dynasty hold succession over Singhasan, and none of the illegitimate children, and their descendants, have any right over Singhasan
 is sandarbh main, royal marejez act, 1772 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar shahi parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhu kii sweekruti lenaa aavashyak he, or samprabhu ke sweekruti ke bina kiye gaye kisi bhi vivaah ko "avaidh" qaraar diya jayega, tathaa vah vyakti or uske santan singhasana par adhikaar se vanchit ho jaayenge
 Some changes were made to the provisions of this Act by the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act
 is adhinium ke anusaar, uttaradhikaar kram ke pehle chah sadasyon ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhi kii ijazat lenaa aavashyak he, anyathaa us vyakti tathaa us vivaah se hue saare santan or unke vanshajon ko uttaradhikaar kram se vanchit maan liya jayega
 But any such marriage cannot be declared illegal in any way
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 baharhaal, aam taur par un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line
 Will be vibhinn rashtramandal pradeshon ke sandarbh main, isi vishesh samooh ke liye bhinn shabdaawalee kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke taur par, australia main is samooh ko australian rajpariwaar or canda main canadian rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he

 jinamein se adhiktar deshon ne madhya 20veen sadi tak britain se swatantraaa hasil kar lee
 Although all those countries rejected the suzerainty of the government of the United Kingdom, many of them recognized the British ruler as their suzerainty
 in deshon ko rashtramandal pradesh yaa rashtramandal prajabhumi kaha jaataa he
 At present, the United Kingdom is not only the United Kingdom, but in addition there are a total of 15 other nations
 haalanki in rashtron main bhi unhen lagbhag saamaan pad va adhikaar praapt he jaisaa kii britain main, parantu un deshon main, unka koi vaastavik raajnneetik yaa paaramparik karttavya nahin he, shaasha ke lagbhag saare karttavya unke pratnidhi ke rup main us desh ke maharajyapal puraa karte hai
 The Government of Britain has no role or interference in the work of the governments of the Commonwealth territories

 But this is not so because of the geometry of the sphere
 prithvi par do sthanon ke bich udaan bharne kaa sabase chota rasta vah hota he jo un donon jagahon se guzarane vaale mahavritt par ho
 When the same Mahavrta Marg and "straight Path" are seen on paper, the "straight path" seems small, but if you look at the circle, the Mahavartha path is small
 aisa isliye hai ke prithvi kii sataha ek gole par he or jahaaz ko uske saath-saath chalanaa hota he - vah zamin ke andar ghuskar ek sthaan se dusre sthaan nahin ja saktaa

 In arithmetic, the logarithm of a number on a given base is a number that is equal to the given number by raising its power over that base
 udhaaharan ke liye, 10 aadhaar par 1 xxrep 5 0 kaa laghuganak 5 hoga kyonki aadhaar 10 par 5 ghaat lagane se uskaa maan 1 xxrep 5 0 ho jaataa he
 That is, for any number x, base b and exponent n, yah paribhaasha tabhi vaid he jab aadhaar b, 1 ke alaava koi anya dhanatmak vaastavik sankhya ho, arthath b> 0 y b ≠ 1, x koi bhi dhanatmak vaastavik sankhya ho tathaa n koi bhi vaastavik sankhya ho 
 Each logarithm must have a basis
 bhinn bhinn aadhaaron ke liye ek hi sankhya ke bhinn bhinn laghuganak hote hai
 Generally, two numbers are treated for the base, according to which two systems of logarithms are made
 prakritik pranali main laghuganak kaa aadhaar ek aparimey sankhya e maani jaati he
 In the name of its inventor, John Napier, such logarithms are also called 'nepali logarithms'

 The logarithm base in this system is 10
 ise 'saadhaaran laghuganak' kehete hai
 It is suitable for practical experiments
 pratilghuganak : yadi log a = b to b ko a kaa pratilaghu kehete hai
 For example, log 39
2 = 1
5933, then antilog 1
5933 = 39

 For example, log10 = 3
66048
 3
66048 main 3 purnansh or 0
66048 apurnansh he
 The following is the rule for finding the integer logarithm of a number: apurnansh gyaat karne kaa niyam nimnlikhit hai : The numerator depends on the value of the number and the order of the digits dealt with
 yadi do sankhyaon main ek hi prakaar ke ank ek hi kram main vyavahrut hon or keval dashamalav bindu kaa sthaan bhinn ho, to un sankhyaon ke apurnansh ek hi honge, kyonki apurnansh sankhya main dashamalav bindu ke sthaan par nirbhar nahin hota he
 For example, the degrees of both 4538 and 45
38 will be the same, although the integers will be different

 The reciprocal relationship between the Napirian logarithm and the natural logarithm of 1614 AD is expressed as follows: nepier ne ikai ke laghuganak kaa maan shunya nahin mana tha
 As a result, according to their theory, the equation = force = not compatible with the arithmetic was not possible without modification

 She released a lot of Shinchan records
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki vah shinchaiyn kii tarah dikhataa bhi he
 When it was made a serial, it was also well received in Spain and aired on Cartoon Network as well as channels like Antenna-3
 yah itnaa lokapriy ho gaya ki ise vahaan kii paanch sthaneey bhashaaon main anuwaad karke dikhaaya gaya
 Shinchan's cartoon character was liked in Malaysia, as much as his comics book
 vahaan comics kaa tittle hota tha ‘dick keradas’, jiskaa matlab hota he brilient kid
 The cartoon was also aired in the Philippines and was well received
 ise vahaan kii philipino language main dab kiya gaya or shinchaiyn ko aawaaj dene kaa kaam kiya ‘andrew i’ ne
 In Latin America in 2003, Shinchan aired on Fox Kids / Jetics
 lekin, 2005 main yah duusare channel anemax par prasaarit kiya jane laga
 How popular this character has become there can be gauged from the fact that it is shown 3-4 times in a single channel on a single day
 bharat main shinchaiyn mukhya taur par ‘hangaamaa’ tivi par dikhaaya jaataa he
 Soon Chinchain has become quite popular in India too
