 Lingayatism is a part of the oldest Sanatan Hindu religion of India
 is mat ke zyaadaatar anuyaayi dakshin bharat main hai
 This opinion is based on the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv jo satya sundar or sanathan hai, jinase sristi kaa udgaar hua, jo aadi anant hai
 In Hinduism, there is a description of the trinity, in which the name of Lord Shiva comes first
 shiv jinase sristi kii utpatti hui
 After this, the origin of Lord Brahma, who gives life to the whole world

 'virshaiv' kaa shabdic arth he - 'jo shiv kaa param bhakt ho'
 But with the passage of time, Veerashaiva's philosophy, philosophy, practice, rituals, social mobilization, Acharanyam etc
 became different from other sects
 yadhyapi virshaiv desh ke anya bhaagon - maharashtra, andhra, tamil kshetra aadi - main bhi paae jate hai kintu unki sabase adhik sankhya karnataka main pai jaati he
 Shaivites derive their religious beliefs and philosophy from the Vedas and the 28 Shaivagams

 In the nearly three centuries between the 12th and 16th centuries, there have been some 300 pledges, of which 30 have been women
 inamen sabase prasiddh naam basav kaa he jo kalyaan ke jain raja vijjal kaa pradhan mantri tha
 He was not only a yogi mahatma but also a karmat Sanghatanaka who established the Veerashaiva sect

 He was opposed to ritualistic fanatics and emphasized the truth of mental purity and devotion

 a wonderful revolution arose in the society due to the end of caste discrimination and the rise of women

 Many of the followers of Vasava were Harijans and they also performed inter-caste marriages

 What we see in humans is the development of specialization and self-consciousness, but this self-consciousness is the motivating reason for the attempt to reunite with the Supreme Consciousness

 Veerashaivas have established a tradition of spiritual discipline called 'shatasthala Shastra'
 yah maanav kii saadhaaran chetana kaa angsthal ke pratham prakram se lingsthal ke sarvocch kram par pahunch jane kii sthiti kaa suchak he
 In the whole process of spiritual practice, spiritual discipline, the emphasis is on devotion and refuge

 The spiritual aspirant uses one or all of his three powers to establish unity with God
 premashkti ke prayog kaa naam bhaktiyog, chintanashkti ke prayog kaa gyanayog tathaa karm shakti ke prayog kaa naam karmyog he
 It is through these that final unity with God is established
 isamen andeh nahin ki virashaivon ke bhi mandir, tirthasthan aadi vaise hi hote hai jaise anya sampradaayon ke, antar keval un devi devataaon main hota he jinaki puja kii jaati he
 As far as the relation of the Veerashaivas is concerned, the temples or other forms of cultivation are not as important as the idol of the favored linga, which is held on the body
 aadhyatmik guru prayek virshaiv ko isht ling arpit kar uske kaan main pavitra shadakshar mantra 'om nam: shivaay' phunk detaa he
 Each Veerashaiva bathes and worships with contemplation and meditation by placing the idol of the favored penis on the hand's gadali
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki prayek virshaiv main satyaparayanata, ahimsa, bandhutavbhaav jaise ucch naitik gunon ke hone kii aashaa kii jaati he
 He is indulgent and avoids alcoholic substances etc

 The Vedas, the Upanishads and the Shaivagam are all in Sanskrit, so the Veerashaiva pledges added to the Kannada language and literature by incorporating their essence and the eternal elements into the Kannada language and literature

 gyaan kaise praapt hota he ? mukti kaise hogi ? or vairaygy kaise praapt hoga ? ye teen shaashvat prashn hai jo har kaal main aatmanusandhaniyon dwaara puche jate rahe hai
 Sage Ashtavakra addressed these three questions in the form of a dialogue with King Janaka, which is popular as the Ashtavakra Gita
 ye sutara atmagyaan ke sabase sidhe or saral vaktavy hai
 In these, only one path is displayed which is the path of knowledge
 ye sutara gyanoplabdhi ke, gyani ke anubhav ke sutara hai
 One only needs to know oneself - to be knowledgeable, that's all
 koi aadambar nahin, aayojan nahin, yatnaa nahin, ytn nahin, bas ho janaa vahi jo ho
 Therefore, there can be only one interpretation of these sutras, there is no problem of dissent; There is no scope for Pandity and Pongapanthi

 actor-network siddhanth ) saamaajik siddhanth evam anusandhan kii vah vidhi he jo vastuon ko saamaajik network kaa bhaag maanati he
 Thinking around the concept of network has not yet found a satisfactory solution to the problem of establishing a link between technological and social thinking
 actor- network thiyari isi samaadhaan kaa prayaas karti he
 Bruno Latur and Michel Callan, scholars of science and technology studies, produced it with the help of sociologist John Locke
 takneekee rup se ise ‘material-semiotic’ paddati kaa naam diya jaataa he
 That is, this theory not only studies the relationship between objects, it also helps in understanding the relationship between concepts
 yah siddhanth yah maan kar chalata he ki kai sambandh ek saath bhautik or sanketamulak hote hai
 For example, a bank has a triangular interaction between individuals, their ideas and technology
 parinamswaroop ek aisa network banataa he jo ekal astitv ke rup main ‘act’ karte hue vibhinn tattvon ke saath apana sutara kaayam karata he taaki swayan main susangat or sampoorn ho sake
 Actor-networks are constantly being made of this
 aise networkon main sambandhon ko lagaataar or baar-baar ‘paraform’ karnaa padataa he, anyathaa network bikhar jaataa he
 To keep this network consistent, it is necessary to minimize the conflict between its members
 francisi darshanik zeel dalaz or felix guatari ke chintan se prerana lene vaali is thiyari kii ruchi yah bataane main he ki actor-network kaise banataa he, kaise khud ko kaayam rakhata he or kaise bikhar jaataa he
 But it does not know how the network takes its manifest form
 network kii avadharana ke prati dwaidh ke baavjood is siddhant ke kaaran mobility or connactivity sambandhi prashnon par naveen chintan kii gunjaaishein nikali hai
 An effective layout of the characteristics, achievements and limitations of this theory is found in the treatise "actor Network Theory and Ochter" edited by John Locke and John Hassard
 lock ke anusaar yah thiyari ‘bhautikta ke lakshanshastra’ yaa ‘sambandhaatmak bhautikta’ jor detii he
 This implies that this theory analyzes physical forms with the relativity tools of signs taken from the realm of symptomatology
 in bhautik roopon main rojaanaa ke jivan se judi vastuen bhi ho sakati hai
 Actor-network theory deviates from social network analysis due to its similar characteristics
 lakshan-vigyaan ek bhashashastreey upkaran he, par yah siddhant uski antardrushtiyon kaa istemaal karke tattvon kii sambandhaatmakataa kii toh letaa he or phir uske zariye behichak hokar har tarah kii saamagree kaa vishleshan kar daalata he
 In the nineties, feminist thinker Donna Haarave also studied elements that pointed to a new kind of intellectual property, despite being in physical form, to fathom the relationship between the physical and the symbolic
 lock ke anusaar iske madhyam se yah paddati pataa lagaati he ki duusare tattvon ke saath apni ke maanviya gair-maanviya tattvon par kya asar padataa he
 Under relationships with each other, things pass through their own or others' functionality
 yahan lock poochhate hai ki is kriyaatmakataa or sambandhon kii apekshaakrit sthirataa or sthaniktaa ke bich kya sambandh he? iske jawaab main lock ek vaikalpik sthaan-vaigyanik ke rup main network ke vichaar ko pesh karte hai
 That is, under a network, different elements are able to maintain their spatial integrity based on their mutual sources or relationships
 soshal network vishleshan ke maharathi jis network kii charchaa karte hai, vah network yah nahin he
 For them, the network is a relatively neutral and descriptive term
 jon lock ke liye network apane-aap main sthaniktaa kaa ek swaroop yaa swaroopon kaa ek samucchy he
 This feature of the network imposes strict limitations on any kind of topological possibility
 vah network ke bheetar kaam kar rahe sutron kaa samaroopikaran nahin hone detii
 Neither possible relations can be harmonized
 parinamswaroop sambhav tattvon ke charitra kaa bhi samaroopikaran nahin hota
 Thierry boundaries emerge on this
 lock ko network kii avadharana ke saath pehali mushkil yah lagati he ki uske zariye ek seemaa tak hi vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 The reason for this is that the network has already assumed a special form
 ek aisa rup jo apni pahunch ke sabhi jud sakane vaale tattvon ke saath ek jaisaa hi vyavhaar karata he
 Locke's objection is that because of this attitude, complete information is not available about the formulas created within the network and between networks
 isi kaaran se tattvon ke bare main bhi pataa nahin chal paata ki unhone apana maujuuda rup kaise praapt kiya
 Locke holds that this problem cannot be solved until it goes beyond the idea of the Theory Network to emphasize the multiplicity of elements, and re-outline the complexity of the relationship
 rochak baat yah he ki actor-network thiyari ke pramukh bruno ne baad main isaki aalochana kii
 Latur said that four things are not effective in this theory
 na actor shabd kargar he, na network, na thiyari or na hi actor or network ke bich laga haifan
 His reasoning was that twenty years ago, using the idea and metaphor of the network provided scope for going beyond established ideas like society and nation-state, but today the World Wide Web has existed and almost everyone Understands the rough meaning of the network
 darasal, apni hi thiyari ko kaarij karne ke peeche latur kii manshaa yah kehane kii thi aaj ke jamaane main network ke vichaar kaa istemaal sansthagat roopon ke vishleshan se kataraate hue lacheelepan or pravahon par jor dene ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 It happens in this case that the question of spatiality is left out of the analysis and the criticism of the institutional form is left to those criticisms
 duusare, yah aalochana karte hue latur ko yah chintaa bhi sata rahi thi ki aajkal samaaj-vigyaan main network pad kaa andhadhundh istemaal hone laga he, jabaki yah mukhyatah takneekee shai he jisaki nafaasat or pechidagi ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya janaa chahie
 At this point of criticism, Latur appears to have scope for the idea of rijmo suggested by Dalz and Guattari
 rijmo kii khaas baat yah he ki vah kisi suparibhaashit bhu-kshetreeyata ke bina hi apni shakhaon ke sambandh-sutron ke kaaran pranaligat gunon ko vyakt karata he
 Dalz and Guattari state that the definition of Rijmo is based on kinship formulas and heterogeneity
 vah kisi ke saath kisi bhi samay sambandh kaayam kar saktaa he
 On the lines of Rijmo, Latur states that the network should be assumed as a form that is constantly evolving, and which presents an unprecedented possibility of linkages
 yah aalochana karte-karte latur is nishkarsh par pahunche ki network kehane ke bajaay ab 'work-net' kii abhivyakti kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie
 According to him, the most important part of the network is 'work'
 sambandh-sutara karne liye karnaa, yaa paraformativity aavashyak he
 In the context of the history of Thailand, all the kings of the present Chakri dynasty are often called Rama

 Having characters in separate teams was to give a group a distinct style
 Kishimoto wished "extreme" for each member who is very high in one ability but unqualified in the other
 The villain's entry in the story was largely to contradict the moral values of the characters
 Kishimoto has admitted that the description of the difference in values centered on the creation of his villain in such a way that, "I really don't think about their fight
" While creating the characters, Kishimoto adopted a similar five-step process: concept and sketch, drafting, inking, Shading and color | These steps were followed when he was making actual manga and also drawing color illustrations that are usually seen on the cover of Tankbon, Weekly Shनnen Jump, or other media, but the tool kit he uses Changes only occasionally
 For example, he used an airbrush for a weekly Shonen Jump cover but decided not to use it in the future as it required cleaning
 For Part II, part of the manga debut, with version 28, Kishimoto stated that he had not tried to "overdo the specific manga style" and that he had not included "too much disorder" and that the panel map Is kept so that the reader can easily understand the plot
 Kishomoto said that his style of painting has changed from "something more real than ideal manga"

 a gas hose or 'gassed hose' is a kind of electron hose in which electricity is basically operated by gas or vapor filled in the nozzles
 isko gas visarjan nalika bhi kehete hai
 It contains some appropriate gas inside a malleable anti-thermal vessel and the electrodes are properly configured within it
 praaia: paatr kaanch kii bani hoti he kintu kuch nalikaaon ke paatr siremic ke bhi banaaye jate hai
 The vessels for military use tubes are made of metal with a glass layer of inner surface
 gas nalikaaon ke vaidyut gundharm in nalikaaon main bhari gaison kii prakruti or unke daab par bahut seemaa tak nirbhar karte hai
 a little gas is put into these tubes
 adhiktar jo gaisen prayog main laai jaati hai, ve hai pardwashp, aragan, nian aadi
 They remain at a pressure of 1 to 30 * 10-3 millimeters in the gasoline
 jaise-jaise dhanagar kii voltata shunya se badhaai jaati he, pattic dhara nirvaat naliyon ke samaan in naliyon main bhi badhane lagati he
 However, when the voltage reaches the ionization potential of the gas, ionization occurs by encounter
 pattic dhara apane purna maan par pahunch jaati he or phir pattic voltat ko adhik badhaane kaa usapar koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 This result is shown in Figure 9
 aisa is kaaran hota he ki muthbhed ke dwaara jo dhanatmak aayan paidaa ho jate hai, ve purna rup se antaran aavesh ke prabhaav ko hataa dete hai, tabhi electron dhara par iskaa niyantran samaapt ho jaataa he or purna electron dhara pravaahit hone lagati he
 As already mentioned, this gas bipolar is used in desorption, where more power is required; For example in the power source of the sender
 ye ve gas dwidhruvi hai jinamein pattic or runagra ke bich ek niyantrak grid laga diya jaataa he
 The work of this controller grid is also almost the same as that of vacuum tube grid control, but a large variation is under control of both
 yadi is grid ke vibhav ko rinatmak maan se dhire dhire badhaayaa jaae to yah dekha jayega ki jaise hi uskaa maan us bindu tak aa jaataa he jisapar dhara pravaahan aarambh ho jaataa he, vaise hi dhara ekadam nune se apane purna maan par pravaahit hone lagati he
 As the full current starts flowing, there is no effect of the current on the grid
 uske baad chaahe grid main kitna hi rinatmak vibhav laga diya jaae, pattic dhara kaa pravaahan nahin ruk saktaa
 The flow of the filler current can be prevented by reducing only the filtered voltage to the ionization potential
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jaise hi vidyuddhara pravaahit hoti he, dhan aayan rinatmak, grid ko dhak lete hai or griu ke vibhav kaa koi prabhaav dharapravaahan main nahin rah jaataa
 These types of tubes are used in the form of scheme and 'trigger', which is very important in today's electronic devices

 These tubes have high-frequency-electric-field reactions with electrons

 Thus the energy of the high frequency oscillator increases

 After the passage of time, due to the degeneration of Drona, at present this mountain has started to be called as Doonagiri, according to or similar to the Kumaoni dialect

 According to the mythological geography and history of India, it is considered one of the seven important mountain peaks

 It is on this mountain, the oldest Shaktipeeth temple of Maa Vaishnavi, at an elevation of about 8000 feet above sea level, towards the northeast angle
 isko ab sthaneey kumaunni boli-bhashaa main maan dunagiri ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Since the very ancient times, many great elements of Indian history and culture have been associated with this proven Shaktipeeth of Doonagiri
 devi ke gudh rahasyon kaa chintan karne vaale rishi muniyon ne himalay ke is parvat par dhunni ramaakar ashtidhatri ke darshan kiye
 The temple of Doonagiri mother Vaishnavi Shaktipeeth was renovated in 1318 AD by the then ruler of Katyuri dynasty Sudharamdev

 According to Swami Shri Shree Satyeswaranand Giriji Maharaj, who has practiced yoga for many years in Doonagiri, there are only two Vaishnavi Shaktipeeths in India, one in Jammu and Kashmir by the name of Vaishno Devi and the other Gupta Shaktipeeth is revered as Vaishnavi mother of Doonagiri

 Legend also states that when Hanuman ji was going through the sky route, the piece of Dronanchal was broken and called Doonagiri, but there is no concrete mention of it in the Ramayana nor in any mythological texts
 jo bhi varnan va aadhaar milte hai, unase yahi spasht hota he ki arvachin dron yahi vartmaan dunagiri he
 Thus the prevailing beliefs about Doonagiri are neither confirmed in the Puranadi texts nor is there any mention of any such incident in the Ramayana from which it may be known that when Hanumanji was taking Dronanchal, some piece of the road
 i have fallen somewhere

 Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH
 protocol vinirdesh do pramukh sanskarnon ke bich antar karata he, jise esaech -1 or esaech -2 kaha jaataa he
 The most visible application of the protocol is for accessing shell accounts on Unix-like operating systems, but it also sees some limited usage on Windows
 2015 main, microsoft ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhavishya main relies main esaech ke liye mul samarthan shaamil hoga
 SSH was designed to replace Telnet and for unprotected remote shell protocols such as Berkeley Ragin, RSP, and rexac protocols
 ve protocol sade text main jaankaree, vishesh rup se password bhejte hai, jo packet vishleshan kaa upyog karke avrodh or prakatikaran ke liye atisamvedansheel hote hai
 The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide the confidentiality and integrity of data over unsecured networks such as the Internet, although leaked files by Edward Snowden indicate that the National Security Agency can sometimes decrypt SSH, allowing them to Allows read content of SSH sessions
 
 On 6 July 2017, government transparency organization wikileaks confirmed that the US Central Intelligence Agency had developed tools that could be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows or GNU / Linux operating systems to start on systems compromised by SSH customers SSH connection made can be stopped! paribhaasha SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate remote computers and, if necessary, allow the user to authenticate
 esaech kaa upyog karne ke kai tareeke hai; ek network conection ko ancript karne ke liye swachaalit rup se jenerate kiye gaye saarvajanik-nijee kunjee jode kaa upyog karnaa he, or phir log on karne ke liye password pramanikaran kaa upyog karnaa he
 Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without specifying a password
 is paridrishy main, koi bhi vibhinn kunjee kii milan karne vaali jodi utpann kar saktaa he
 The public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key 
 jabaki pramanikaran nijee kunjee par aadhaarit he, pramanikaran ke dauraan kunjee ko network ke madhyam se kabhi bhi sthanantarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 SSH only verifies if the same person offering the public access is the owner of the matching private key
 esaech ke sabhi sanskarnon main agyaat saarvajanik kunjee ko satyapit karnaa mahatvapurn he, yani unhen maanya ke rup main sweekaar karne se pehle, saarvajanik kunjee ko pahchaan ke saath sambhddha karen
 Accepting an attacker's public key without verification would authorize an unauthorized attacker as a legitimate user
 mukhya prabandhan On systems such as Unix, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user who is allowed to remotely log into the file ~ / 
ssh / authorized_ keys
 yah fil keval esaech dwaara sammanit he yadi yah maalik or root ke alaava kisi bhi cheez se likhane yogya nahin he
 When the public key is present at the remote end and the matching private key is present at the local end, the password does not require typing in the stack
 This password needs to be well)
 haalanki, atirikt suraksha ke liye nijee kunjee ko pasfrez se lock kiya ja saktaa he
 The private key can also be viewed in standard locations, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting
 esaech-kijen upyogita hameshaa jodon main saarvajanik or nijee kunjee banaati he
 SSH also supports password-based authentication that is encrypted with an automatically generated key
 is maamle main, hamalavar vaid sarwar paksh kii nakal kar saktaa he, password maang saktaa he, or ise praapt kar saktaa he 
 However, this is only possible if the two parties have never authenticated before, as SSH remembers the key that previously used the server
 esaech client ek nae, pehle agyaat sarwar kii kunjee sweekaar karne se pehle ek chetavanee uthaata he
 Password authentication can be disabled prayog SSH is commonly used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; It can transfer files using the corresponding SSH file transfer or secure copy protocol
 SSH client-sarwar model kaa upyog karata he Standard TCP port 22 is assigned to contact the SSH server
 ek esaech client program aamtaur par remote conection sweekaar karne vaale esaech dimen se conection sthapit karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Both typically exist on most modern operating systems, including macos, most distributions of Linux, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd, Solaris, and openvms
 vishesh rup se, windos kuch aadhunik desktop / sarwar oes main se ek he jisamen difolt rup se esaech shaamil nahin he
 Versions of ownership, freeware and open source varying levels of complexity and completeness exist
 mul linaks fil prabandhak draig-and-drop ke saath ek split-falak jeeyuai pradaan karne ke liye fish protocol kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 The open source Windows program provides the same file management capabilities using winsip PUTTE as a back end

 connactivity samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye cloud computing main esaech mahatvapurn he, cloud-aadhaarit abhaasi mashin ko sidhe internet par ujagar karne ke suraksha muddon se parhez karnaa
 An SSH tunnel can provide a secure route to the virtual machine, via a firewall, over the Internet

 According to this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit at normal pressure and boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit

 This scale is used in thermometers used to measure traditional fever

 Tribes are social communities that existed before the development of the state or which are still outside the state
 janajati vastav main bharat ke adivaasiyon ke liye istemaal hone vaala ek vaidhanik pad he
 The term Scheduled Tribes has been used in the Constitution of India and special provisions have been implemented for them
 bharat main kabeeli jansankhya ke vishay main spasht or sulajhe vichaaron kaa abhaav rahaa he
 There is no consensus among scholars about the definition of the word 'kabila'
 falswaroop janaganana reporton main bhi jahaan kuch kabeelon ko jatiyon kii suchi main rakhaa gaya he, bahut si nichi jatiyon ko bhi kabeelon main sammilit kar liya gaya he
 In this regard, there is also an unevenness from one census to another
 ek janaganana ke anusaar samast bhartiya kabeelon kaa dharm 'atmavad' kii shrenee main aata he kintu uski agali janaganana main hi kabeeli dharm kii sarvatha pruthak shrenee bana di gai he
 In fact, the original question is, who is called 'kabila'? This term is probably the most recent but qualitative definition of the term more equitable than the definitions given so far
 is naveen paribhaasha ke anusaar kabila nishchit bhugolic seemaa ke bheetar vaas karanevaala aisa antarvivaahi saamaajik samooh he jisamen kaaryon kaa vishishtikaran nahin paaya jaataa
 Organized by the same language or dialect and administered by tribal authorities, this group considers social distance from other tribes and castes, but is untouched by social dislike like caste system
 kabeeley ko apni paramparaayen, vishwaas evam reetiyaan hoti hai or prajateey tathaa bhagaulik sangrathan se udbhoot sajaatiyata kii bhaavana kabeeley ke sadasyon main bahya prabhaavon se pratiraksha ko janm detii he
 The tribe may or may not be scheduled
 kabeeley main par-samskruti-dhaaran kii prakriya yaa to purnroopen sampann ho chuki hoti he yaa aanshik rup main hi
 Tribals constitute 8
61% of the total census of India
 prajateey aadhaar par bhartiya kabeelon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The first category consists of Naga, Kuki, Garo and Assamese clan of Mongolian origin or Bhotia clan of Almora district
 duusari shrenee ke antargat munda, santhal, korwa aadi pura-australia kabeeley or teesri shrenee main vishuddh arya mul ke nichle himalayavasi khas kabeeley yaa hind-arya-rakt kii pradhanta liye kintu mishrit prakaar ke bhil aadi kabeeley rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistically, Indian tribes can be classified into three distinct linguistic groups
 ye samooh kramash: munda, tibeti-burmi or dravid bhashapariwaron ke hai
 Some tribes have abandoned their original dialect and started speaking Hindi
 kuch munda kabeeley is shrenee main aate hai
 The Bhils of Gujarat, originally speaking Munda-speaking families, have also adopted Gujarati or Marathi according to their domicile
 nishchit bhugolic simaaon main based in kabeelon ke atirikt nat, bhantu, saansi, karwaal or kanjar aadi aise khanaabadosh kabeeley hai jo haal tak aparadhopjivi the kintu jinhen kathor niyantran or kathin niyamon se mukt kar diya gaya he
 The total population of these tribes of all categories is about three crore but many tribes have adopted caste and caste occupations
 isiilie haal kii janaganana ne inaki sankhya lagbhag do karod tehrai he
 Keeping in view the problem of rehabilitation, the tribes can be divided into three categories according to cultural considerations: saanskrithik drushti se graamy va nagarasamoohon se dur kabeeley, arthath ve jo praaia: samparkvihin hai, The tribes affected by urban culture in which contacts have resulted in the planting of problems and graamy tathaa nagarasamoohon ke sampark main aae ve kabeeley jinamein aisi samasyaayen yaa to uthi hi nahin, athwa safal par-samskruti-dharan ke kaaran ab nahin raheen
 In the context of cultural contacts, Indian tribes can be divided into two categories, Adapters and Perpetrators
 anukulak kabeeley teen prakaar ke ho sakate hai-sahabhoji, samjivi or par-samskruti-dharak
 Sahbhitaita means participating in similar economic functions with neighboring groups
 samajivita shabd kaa prayog kabeelon kii aarthik or saanskrithik aatmanirbharta ke arth main kiya gaya he
 Par-culture 'concept refers to the unilateral acceptance of cultural traits, that is, par-culture-holding clans are those who adopt the customs of their civilized neighboring groups
 is vargeekaran main un kabeelon kii gananaa nahin hui jo bahya samskritiyon ke sampark se achoote chhot gaye hai
 But the reality is that there is no 'zero point' of cultural contacts in India
 duusare shabdon main, sabhi kabeeley apane se adhik unnat samskritiyon ke sampark main aae hai or parinamswaroop yaa to samasyagrasit hai athwa sampark sthiti se samaayojan sthapit kar apekshaakrit santoshprad jivan vyateet kar rahe hai
 Most of the Indian tribes are inhabited by forests and depend only on wild natural resources
 cochin ke kadaar, travnakor ke malayantaram, madras ke palian or vynad ke panian aise hi kabeeley hai
 Some tribes have economies between food storage and backward agriculture
 in kabeelon main pramukh madhya pradesh ke kamaar or isi rajya main maandla kshetra ke vaiga tathaa dakshin main bisan pahadiyon ke reddy hai
 Both the above categories of tribes have a profound influence on the forest policies of the government
 bhartiya kabeelon kii teesri aarthik shrenee main desh kii adhikansh kabeeli jansankhya ko rakhaa ja saktaa he
 This category belongs to tribes whose main source of livelihood is agriculture, but who have adopted the harvesting business as the other main occupation due to the proximity of forests
 uttar-purvi evam madhya bharat ke praaia: sabhi kabeeley is shrenee main aate hai
 The British government adopted a policy of non-interference with the tribal population and left it to their fate
 iske vipareet vartmaan shashan kii niti sakriy hastkshep kii he
 The Government of India is committed to adopting and moving policy towards tribes
 kintu yah samaj lenaa aavashyak he ki kabeelon kaa str ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main bhinn ho jaataa he or kushal nitinirdhaaran ke purv sthaneey dashaon kaa purna gyaan apekshit he
 Past mistakes are a guide to the future
 ab tak shashan kii ore se kabeeli punarvaas jaise vishaal kaary ke darshanik aadhaar kaa spasht vivechan prastut nahin kiya gaya he or yah tab tak sambhav nahin jab tak bhartiya kabeelon ke vishay main samuchit jaankaree praapt nahin ho jaati
 Equally emphasis is placed on the preservation of traditional Sanskrit of tribal programs and the planting of changes in a smooth and organized manner
 kabeeli janata main navdith saamaajik saamaajik chetana or sarkari prayatnon dwaara labhanvit hone kii aakanksha bhartiya kabeeli samasyaon ke prasang main do nae dishasanket hai
 The work of recovering tribes from their present backward condition and conforming them to rural cultures should be done with great caution
 yadi pragati kii yojana is prakaar kii gai to bhavi bhartiya samskruti main jeevanyaapan ke keval do praaroop honge-graamy or naagarik, evam samaaj vaigyanikon kaa daayitv hoga ki ve in do praroopon ke bich kii khai ko drudh pulon dwaara paatane kaa praytn karen
 British rule also paid attention to tribal population from time to time
 kabhi-kabhi sarkaar ke paas hinsaatmak vidrohi kii kii soochna pahunchati thi
 Most of such revolts usually originated in three reasons: isai mishnariyon ko apane kaaryakalapon main shashan kaa purna sahyog praapt hota tha or shashan kii ore se unhen anek adhikaar bhi mili hue the
 Thus the government was relieved of the tribal problem and the missionaries were following a policy of arbitrary intervention
 kintu jab pahadiya logon ne hindu jameendaaron ke viruddh vidroh kaa naaraa lagaaya to british sarkaar ne shantisthapana ke liye apni sena bheji
 The flame of reprisal was pacified by giving peace to rebel leaders
 shantisthapana ke hit main pahadiya kshetra ke chaaron ore avkashprapt or samarthyaheen sainikon ko basane ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya
 Over time, practices and punishments also came under the jurisdiction of the tribal leaders
 nyaay or anushaasan main sudhaar hua or shashan ne kabeeley ko vishesh vyavhaar ke yogya samajha
 Consequently, in 1782, the palace hills were removed from the jurisdiction of ordinary courts
 san 1796 main pahadiyaan kshetra kaa nayaa namakaran 'damaani-ko' hua or iske prashasan ke liye nai nyayavidhi sweekrut hui
 This entire region came under the authority of a collector whose rule had no relation with the law prevailing in other parts of India
 isi samay chota nagpur or santhal pargana main bhi asantosh kii aag sulag rahi thi
 The zamindars had many times demanded armed intervention from the regime
 san 1886 main vikhyath santhal vidroh bhadak uthaa
 Santhal Pargana was made a separate district and as per the 38th exchange of 1855, it was declared as an 'unregulated' area as per regulations
 fort wiliam, fort saint george or bombai kii prabandhkarini parishadon ke tatvadhan main anek nae adhinium paarit hue
 According to the India Council Act of 1861, the 'unregulated' rules made by local authorities were recognized
 san 1870 ke bharat sarkaar adhinium dwaara saprishad mahasha ko aise kshetron ke liye niyam banane kaa adhikaar praapt hua jahaan british bharat ke anya bhaagon main prachlit vyavhaar tathaa dand prakriya simit rup main lagu hoti thi
 By the 14th District Scheduled Act approved in the Indian Legislature in 1874, the local government got new rights to apply the law in the areas specified in the Act
 sthaneey shashan ko adhikaar mila ki vah un kanoonon kaa spashtikaran kare jo british bharat ke anya bhaagon kii bhanti in kshetron main lagu nahin hote the
 If necessary, in the revised or limited form any law prevailing in other parts of British India was implemented in these areas, it was mandatory to notify the Center
 kintu is vishisht shashanvyavastha ne bhi kabeeli kathinaaiyon ko hal nahin kiya
 The Government of Madras, in order to curb the land ownership in the hill tribes, made a law in 1917 to try to fix the rate of interest on the lending available to the tribes
 san 1876 main hi santhal pargana main vyaktigat rup se athwa adaalaton ke aadesh dwaara bhoomi kaa vikray or hastantaran avaidh ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 The Montford Committee accepted the position of governance towards the tribes in the 52nd section of the 1919 Act
 is dhara ke anusaar pichde kshetron kaa do bhaagon main vibhaajan kiya gaya- The defensive measures of 1935 attempted to improve the tribal population
 naveen bhartiya samvidhan main kabeelon ke pati shashan ke rakshanatmak uttardaayitv par or adhik jor diya gaya he
 New measures have been found to improve their condition and governance is unprecedentedly active in their upliftment
 in kshetron main shiksha, saamudayik vikaas, saamaajik kalyaan tathaa paariwarik swatchta aadi ke liye samuchit prabandh ho rahe hai
 Apart from the policy of special treatment towards tribes, the government has also secured some places for tribes in state services
 is kaary ke liye anusuchit kabeelon evam jatiyon kaa vibhaag banaaya gaya he jisaki adhyakshata ek ayukta karata he
 This department is grappling with the problems that plague the tribes
 kabeeli punarvaas ke in prayatnon kii asafalataa ke vishay main itnaa sheeghra kuch bhi kahana sambhav nahin
 But there is no doubt that these efforts have been motivated by the desire to improve and understand the present condition of the tribes
 bharat main anusuchit janajatiyon se sambandhit kai praavdhaan hai
 They can be divided into two main categories - security and development
 anusuchit janajatiyon kii suraksha sambandhi praavdhaan samvidhan ke anuchhed 15, 16, 19, 23, 29, 46, 164, 330, 332, 334, 335 va 338, 339, 371 va, paanchavi suchi va chhathi suchi main nihit hai
 The provisions relating to the development of Scheduled Tribes are mainly contained in Article 275 First Provision and 339

 bharat ne galiyare ke nirmaan ko antararashtriya kaanoon ke anusaar avaidh mana he kyonki yah paak adhikrut kashmir se hokar gujarata he, jise bharat apana hissaa maanata he
 In this case, India also lodged an objection with Chinese President Xi Jinping
 bharat ne paak-adhikrut kashmir ko lekar rus sarkaar ke samaksh bhi apana virodh jataayaa he
 It is believed that this corridor to be built at a cost of 46 billion dollars between Pakistan and China will prove to be a big change in the geopolitical scenario of South Asia
 is galiyare kaa uddeshy china ke uttari-pashchimi jhinjiyang praant ke kashgar se pakistan ke baluchistan sthit guadar bandargah ke bich sadakon ke 3000 kimi vistrut network or duusari dhanchaagat pariyojnaon ke madhyam se sampark sthapit karnaa he
 According to the documents, it is to be completed by 2030, and will be beneficial for both countries
 is galiyare ke nirmit ho jane ke baad china urja aayaat karne ke liye vartmaan ke 12,000 kimi lambey raste ke mukaable chhate raste kaa istemaal karegaa
 This will save China millions of dollars per year
 saath hi, hind mahaasaagar tak isaki pahunch bhi aasaan ho jaayegi
 Pakistan hopes that it will develop its infrastructure and in return get a potential of $ 34 billion for its water, solar, heat and wind powered power plants, which will reduce or end its severe energy crisis
 
 bhavishya main sipiisi kaa hissaa banane ko lekar iran, rus or saudi arab bhi kaaphi utsahit hai
 This possibility has added to the mystery of this much publicized economic corridor
 vahiin, is samjhaute kaa kam prachaarit paksh he- is saude ke tahat china pakistan ko aath pandubbi kii aapurti bhi karegaa, jisase pakistan kii nausainik shakti kaaphi bad jaayegi
 China's interest in Pakistan is not limited to economic gain
 purna rup se sanchalit guadar bandargah se china ko keval vyavsaayik laabh hi nahin hoga, balki isse ise bade paimaane par samrik or bhuraajnneetik laabh bhi hoga
 Although Gwadar is currently being developed for commercial interests only, there is every possibility that it will be developed into a fully equipped naval base in future
 aisi sthiti main china ko is kshetra main bade paimaane par ranneetik laabh mil saktaa he
 As is well known, Pakistan is going through the worst phase of extremism, terrorism and corruption these days, its intention would be not only to take economic benefits from this project, but also to improve its global image under Chinese patronage
 haalanki, pakistan ko sipiisi se hone vaale anumaanit laabh ke saath iske sambhavit nakaaratmak prabhaavon ko bhi santulit karnaa hoga
 Although this corridor will bring a huge economic benefit to Pakistan, but there are also many doubts about its capacity and economic justification
 saath hi, pakistan ko in dinon anek aantarik or bahari rajnatik chunautiyon se jujhna pad rahaa he, jo galiyare ke vikaas main baadhak ban sakate hai
 Thousands of Chinese security personnel are stationed here in the security of Chinese workers, officers and engineers working in Pakistan because of the construction work of the corridor, and Pakistan has ignored such a big thing, it is amazing
 pakistan kii dharti par itani badi sankhya main videshi sainikon kaa hona, pakistani pratishthan ke liye chintaa kaa vishay hona chahie, khaskar china kii nayi samrajyavaadee soch or ise saakaar karne ko lekar afghanistan main kiye ja rahe prayatnon ko dekhte hue
 In the guise of development, the way China is using Pakistan's natural resources, especially Balochistan, has worried many people here
 chini companiyon ne pakistan main hajaaron acre jameen patte par lee he taaki fasalon ko ugaaya ja sake
 Also, Chinese companies will not have to pay local taxes to Pakistan to export it
 aise main pakistan sarkaar china ko kai aise sansaadhan de rahi he, jisase baad main use samasya kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The key to the success of this corridor is near the Gwadar Port in Balochistan and Pakistan aspires to become the economic head of the region
 haalanki baluchistan ko alag raashtra banane ko lekar uthati aawaaj or is kaaran sena ke ruukh ko lekar paidaa hua vivaad bhi is galiyare ke liye kai chunautiyaan pesh kar rahaa he
 The citizens of Balochistan are opposing CPEC
 agar yah galiyara safaltaapurvak banakar taiyaar ho gaya to ummid he ki pakistan ke duusare praant ke anek log apana praant chhod kar baluchistan aakar bas jaayenge
 For this reason, there have been many attacks by Baloch rebel groups on Chinese engineers and officials working for various CPEC projects
 vahiin kai pratibandhit sanghathan bhi is pariyojna ko lekar dhamkee de rahe hai, haalanki unka uddeshy is aad main pakistan ke saath apana hisaab baraabar karnaa he
 Along with this, many political organizations of the province like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh have also expressed their concern about changing the actual outline of this corridor
 unka maananaa he ki is galiyare main jaan-boojh kar badlaav kiya gaya he, taaki punjab praant ko aarthik laabh pahunchaaya ja sake
 Recently, a Pakistani politician warned in Parliament that an East India Company was taking shape as a china-pakistan economic corridor
 yah baat yojana or vikaas par seenet kii sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh seenetter taahir mashhadi ne kahi thi or unki mukhya chintaa is galiyare ke liye pakistan dwaara china se baari karj ko lekar thi
 Mashdi objected to the demand to set electricity rates in line with Chinese interests
 iske alaava sharton or vittiya vivaran ko lekar paardarshita kaa abhaav bhi chintaa kaa sabase bada kaaran he
 The Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan has also said that he does not know how much of the $ 46 billion is debt, how much equity and how much has to come in the form of goods
 unhone adhik paardarshita kii maang kii he
 Similarly, the International Monetary Fund has also warned of the possible negative consequences of the economic corridor
 chunki yah galiyara samooche pakistan se hokar gujaregaa, atah galiyare ke madhyam se yahaan ke sabhi praanton ke avasanrachana ko behatar hone kaa mauka milegaa
 According to the outline of this ambitious project, new roads, highways, railways, airports and ports will also be built and developed
 aisi bhi aashaa he ki isse khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or baluchistan jaise praant vikaas ke maamle main punjab ko kaaphi peeche chhod denge
 Not only this, when this project is fully developed, it will also generate employment on a large scale
 ummid to yah bhi he ki china ke is prastaavit nivesh se pakistan kaa sakal gharelu utpaada 15 pratishat tak badhkar 274 billian dollar tak pahunch jaayegaa
 The sluggish economy of Pakistan is directly related to the local energy crisis here
 pakistan apni urja jaruraton ko puraa karne main buree tarah naakaam rahaa he
 In view of this energy crisis, CPEC will also start other energy projects totaling 10,500 MW and the work on these projects will be done at a fast pace so that they can be completed by 2018
 ek vishisht yojana ke tahat, thar marusthal main 6,600 megawatt kii 10 pariyojnaon ko viksit kiya jaayegaa, jo is behad dur-daraaj ke ilaake ko pakistan kii urja rajdhani main badal degaa

 The general meaning of constitutionalism is the idea that the power of government arises from the constitution and this also determines its limits
 samvidhanwaad sarkaar ke us swaroop ko kehete hai jisamen samvidhan kii pramukh bhoomika hoti he
 Constitutionalism is to favor the 'state of the law' rather than the authorities having an arbitrary decision
 samvidhanwaad kii mul bhaavana yah he ki sarkari adhikari kuch bhi, or kisi bhi tareeke se, karne ke liye swatantra nahin hai balki unhen apni shakti kii simaaon ke andar rahete hue hi kaary karne kii aazaadee he or vah bhi samvidhan main varnit prakriya ke anusaar
 Constitutional states were born as a result of historical process
 manushya dwaara rajasatta ke atyaachaar va durupyog ke bachane ke prayaas ke parinaam swaroop samvidhanwaad kaa janm hua
 Modern constitutionalism has broad grounds, but its basic premise is considered to be "rule of law"
 pracheen kaal se hi aise vividh vichaaro par chintan kiya jaataa rahaa hai jo rajasatta ko prabhavi bhang se niyantrit kar sake evam uske sad-prayog main sahaayak ban sake
 From this point of view, since ancient times, there is a long tradition of considering various measures in the form of eternal law, natural law, divine law and human law along with royalty and moral affiliations and religious beliefs
 samvidhanwaad british upniveshwaad kii dein he
 The British tried to hit three targets with one stone through this
 unka pehla makasad yah tha ki samvidhanwaad ke madhyam se unke upnivesh dhire-dhire swa-shashan kii taraf badhen or vi-upniveshikaran kii prakriya ko dhimaa kiya ja sake
 Their second aim was to ensure that the colonized states remain under their influence even after attaining self-rule
 swa-shashan ke samvidhanvaadee raste ko isi lihaaz se dizine kiya gaya tha
 The British also tried to achieve a third and complicated objective with constitutionalism
 ve apane udaarataavaad, sansadeey loktantr, mukt bazaar or vyakti-swatantry ke agrahon kaa talmail upniveshwaad ke sainik, saamaajik or aarthik yatharth se karnaa chaahate the
 Actually, the imperialist philosophy of the colonial forces of Europe was not the same
 isi ke parinamswaroop upniveshikaran or a-upniveshikaran kii prakriya ke prati ve alag-alag drushtikon apanaate the
 Interestingly, the British colonialists were also no less racist and oppressive than contemporary European colonists
 par, unhone ireland ko chhodkar apane anya upniveshon main satta ke kramik hastantaran or apratyaksh shashan kii niti apanaayi
 The rule of Queen Victoria followed the policy of Pax Britannica, according to which British rule generally abstained from interfering with local customs and politics
 uskaa jor vyapaar, videsh niti or pratiraksha ko apane niyantran main rakhane par rahata tha
 Accordingly, he appointed an executive council of officers to advise him even in the colonies to be controlled by the governor
 aage chal kar unhone vidhaan parishadon kaa nirvachan bhi karavaaya taaki banaaye gayi kanoon upniveshit janata ko apane pratinidhiyon dwaara banaaye gayi prathit hon
 In comparison to the British, the emphasis of the French was on complete assimilation of their colonies into the French nation
 british raajnneetijna admand bark kaa kahana tha ki agar kanoonon ko deshaj janata ke jeniyas, prakruti or maanas ke mutabik banaaya jaae to aupniveshik shashan sarvaadhik prabhavi sabit hota he
 According to this principle, successive British governments not only suppressed the growing political discontent in the colonies, but also carried out the process of political and constitutional reforms
 is niti ke peeche unnisvin sadi kaa vah tajurba tha jo angrez upniveshvaadiyon ne america, newzealand or australia main sthapit upniveshon se hasil kiya tha
 In these colonies, some forms of political representation were developed under which the residents of the area felt that they also had citizenship of England
 isi ke aadhaar par angrezon ne niti banaayi ki rashtravaadi andolanon ko samvidhansammat raajnneeti karte hue swa-shashan kii taraf jane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 The people there should be gradually given legislative rights
 pehle ve bhitari shashan kii zimmedaari sanbhaalein or phir baad main videsh niti kaa niyantran bhi unke haath main de diya jaae
 The British continued to use the verbiage that through their colonial mission they wanted to enrich the 'backward' societies of Asia and Africa with prudent British traditions of parliamentary democracy and responsible governance
 darasal, upniveshon ko apane haath main rakhana uttarottar mushkil hota ja rahaa tha
 Hence, Britain adopted a path of constitutional reforms to secure its power and influence, taking a flexible and consequentialist attitude
 samvidhanwaad kii niti is manyata par aadhaarit thi ki kisi samrajya ko kaayam rakhane ke liye faujee daman or jabariyaa kabza karne kii niti ab prabhavi nahin rah gayi he
 This reality became even more clear after the Second World War
 british niti-nirmaataaon ko yakeen ho gaya ki a-upniveshikaran kii chaal ko keval sanvaidhanik sudhaaron ke madhyam se hi niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only in this way could the British government maintain close economic, political and strategic relations with newly created independent and sovereign nations
 upniveshvaadiyon kii koshish rahati thi ki ve upniveshit janata ko kendrikrut or ekikrut prashasan ke tahat laaen taaki unka aarthik dohan zyaada se zyaada kiya ja sake
 In response to this, nationalism used to take economic arguments in the form of confrontation
 angrez hoshiyaari se rashtravaadiyon ke bich se udaar or naram tattvon ko chunate the or sthaneey nitiyaan is prakaar banaate the ki unheen tattvon kaa bolbalaa rashtriya andolan par kaayam ho jaae
 Along with suppressing the militant nationalists and encouraging the soft nationalists, their second policy was to tie up with socially traditional and conservative elites
 samajha jaataa he ki unke is samvidhanwaad kaa sabase kaamyaab prayog ceylone main hua
 Seeing the strategic importance of this colony during the Second World War, the British agreed to give the status of Dominion or independent colony to Sri Lanka
 badale main unhone ceylone ke saath pratiraksha or videsh niti ke maamle main sahyog sunishchit kar liya
 Sri Lankan society was divided into Sinhalese majority and Tamil and Muslim minority
 angrezon ne saamaajik rup se anudaaravaadi sinhalai prabhuon ke saath gathjod sthapit kiya
 Similarly, in return for giving independence to Malaya in 1957, the British ensured Malay participation in Commonwealth trade and the immune system
 1945 ke baad hi angrezon ne malaya ke anudaarpanthi paramparaagat shaskaon ke saath gathjod karke ek kendrikrut prashasan khadaa kar liya tha
 It was under this that elections were held in 1954 and the party of the British mind won
 angrezon ne satta hastatanran usee ke haath main kiya
 This policy of constitutionalism did not follow the will of the British everywhere
 unhone bharat main bhi sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii lambi prakriya chalaai, par dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan or baad main congress ke netritv main chali british virdohi muhim ne unke iraadon ko naakaam kar diya
 The deteriorating relations between the Congress and the Muslim League also did not allow the British to melt
 haalaanki is hakeekat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki rashtravaadi andolan kii bagdor garampanthiyon ke haathon main jane se rokane ke liye angrezon ne narampanthiyon kii tarafadaari vaala rukh hameshaa apanaaye rakhaa
 Some observers also see the intention and plan of British rule to create a shining image of some leaders of the national movement
 isi tarah pashchim africa upnivesh gold coast main angrezon kaa samvidhanwaad vaanchit nattejey nahin de paaya
 Under the new constitution of 1950, Nakruma's party forced rapid constitutional reforms instead of successively
 sarvik matadhikaar ghoshit hone ke baad hue chunaavon main nakruma kii party ne zordaar jeet hasil kii or angrezon kii icchit raajnneetik takatein haar gayin
 The colonists were forced to release Nakruma from prison for ruling
 1957 main gold coast ghana ganraajya main badal gaya
 There were also some colonies where the British did not adopt the policy of constitutionalism and continued the repressive attitude
 kenya kaa udhaaharan bataata he ki vahaan kii paristhitiyon main angrezon ne udiyaman africa rashtrawaad kii shaktiyon ko ugr or ashaantikari kah tak kaarij kar diya
 Their effort was to get a multi-constitutional constitution passed so that the status of white minorities could be maintained
 unhone kenya ke sabase bade kabeeley kikayu kii maange thukraa deen
 The British cleared the way for the extremists among the nationalists due to non-constitutional concessions
