 The mathematician Chebicheff "proved" that cods of five or fewer rods could not achieve ungrammatical motion, but his evidence turned out to be inaccurate, because in 1877 AD, Hart denounced the five-rod citation as simple

 Although the definition and field of ethics have been the subject of differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 Moralism has developed in two different directions
 ek ore to achaarshatragyon ne "naitik nirnay" kaa vishleshan karte hue uchit-anuchit sambandhi maanviya vichaaron ke moolbhoot aadhaar kaa prashn uthaaya he
 On the other hand he has discussed moral ideals and the paths adopted for the accomplishment of those ideals
 achaarshastra kaa pehla paksh chintansheel he, doosraa nirdeshnsheel
 We have to look at these two together, because the suffix is both enclosed and inseparable
 pashchimi jagat main achaarshaatra ke siddhant jis tarah kalkrmanusaar, ek ke baad ek, saamne aae us tarah kaa krambaddh vikaas paurvatya darshan ke itihaas main nahin miltaa
 In the past, different moral perspectives and sometimes even conflicting approaches continued to develop simultaneously

 Conduct questions have been given an important place in Indian philosophies
 kisi na kisi rup main prayek darshan ne mukti yaa moksh ko saamne rakhaa he or muktilabh ke liye sadachaar ke niyamon kii samiksha aavashyak ho jaati he
 There is some degree of harmony between Vedic and non-vedic traditions on this matter

 In Jain philosophy, the goal of life is to make the soul attain its original purity
 is maarg kii sabase badi rukaawat yah he ki karmon ne jeevatma ko jad tatv se kalushit kar diya he

 prayek vyakti ko apane hi sukh kii sadhana kerani chahie, na ki dusron ke
 There is a sharp disagreement among various sects of Buddhist philosophy regarding the nature of knowledge and philosophy
 vaibhashik or sautrantik darshan vastavvaadi hai, yogachaar vigyaanvaadee or madhyamik shoonyavaadee
 But on the question of conduct, all Buddhist thinkers have accepted the early teachings of Gautama Buddha
 "chaar arya satyon" main chauthaa, arthath "du:kha-nirodh-maarg" achaarshastra kaa aadhaar he
 Its practical form is "madhyam Pratipada" or Madhyam Marg
 ek ore vyarth atmotpidan, duusari ore kshanik sukhon kii aradhana, in donon "atiyon" kaa parihaar hi sadacharan he
 The work-cause-chain can be eliminated by following the middle path
 janm mutyu ke anwarat chakra se chhutkaaraa nirvana he
 The Mahayana sect interpreted Nirvana more positively
 vyakti ko apane nirvana se hi santusht nahin hona chahie
 The ideal of the Bodhisattva is to continuously strive for the welfare of others after attaining self-realization
 prem, sahanubhuti, anukanpa or pranimaatr ke prati maitri kii bhaavana, in sadgunon par buddha aacharanshastra main vishesh jor diya gaya he
 All sects of Hindu philosophy have accepted the main doctrines of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita as far as conductology is concerned
 upanishdon ne jahaan ek ore param tatv ke gahan prashn ko uthaaya he or brahmagyaan ko hi darshan kaa yartharth lakshya mana he, vahaan duusari ore aatmsaadhana or "sheel" ke vyaavhaarik paksh par bhi dhyaan diya he
 In the Mahabharata, Bhishma has taught Yudhishthira the ethics in which the system of agriculture, commerce etc

 niti vishay par kai pracheen pustaken hai, jaise, ushna ko shukraniti, kautilya kaa arthshaastra, kaamandakeey nitisar ityadi
 The Bhagavad Gita is more important in terms of ethics than philosophy
 brahmavidya or yogashastra kaa samanvay karaane ke uddeshy se nishkaam karm kaa adarsh gita main pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 Inaction is neither the goal of freedom nor of spiritual knowledge
 karmsanyas se shreyaskar he falasakti tyagkar kartavya karte rahanaa
 Patience, composure and self-realization are essential for virtue
 ishwarbhakti or gyaan se bhi manushya kaa jivan parishkrut hokar karmyog main sahaayta milti he
 According to Adi Shankara, the basic philosophy of the Gita is monotheistic
 mukti kaa ekmev saadhan gyaan he
 There is conflict between knowledge and action and coordination between the two is impossible
 phir bhi shankaracharya ne yah sweekaar kiya ki aatmshuddhi kii praarambhik manjilon main karmon kaa bhi mulya he
 Ramanuja considered the importance of Bhaktimarga as the main message of the Upanishads and the Gita
 madhyayug ke bhartiya achaarshastra par, advait vedant kii tulana main, bhaktimaarg se prerana lenevaali vaishnav parampara kaa hi adhik prabhaav padaa
 This trend was reinforced by the Sufism of Islam
 vyapak rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki madhyayugin achaarshastra, jiskaa pratibimb darshanik granthon kii apeksha santkavy main adhik spasht rup se miltaa he, maanavtawaad he
 In modern times Gandhism combines all the healthy traditions of Indian ethics
 upanishdon kii aatmsaadhana, jaino kii "ahimsa", buddha kii anukanpa or prem, gita kaa karmyog, islam kaa vishwabandhutav, in sabhi ke liye gandhivaad main sthaan he
 And since these ideals, the ethics of the national Mahatma Gandhi, represent the Indian culture values, even while raising the problems of the country
 achaarshastra ko darshan or dharamshastra se pruthak sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke adhyayan main kathin he, lekin pashchimi jagat kii apeksha purvi jagat ke saanskrithik itihaas main yah kathinaayee or bhi tivrata se saamne aati he
 There are two sources of philosophical, religious, moral, cultural values of China: "taoism and Kulfuchiism"
 inamen aapasi virodh hote hue bhi in donon kaa samanvay hi, pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se, chini vichaarkon kaa lakshya rahaa he
 Later a third ideology made its debut in China, which can be broadly called Buddhist ideology
 laotse -tao ke anusaar prakruti se saamanjasy sthapit karnaa hi "shubh" he
 The essential virtue for this is simplicity, softness, beauty and peace
 maanav ko apana jivan swaabhaavik or ruju bananaa chahie
 Lao-tsu was the originator of this Tao Marg
 kalphushas -kanfushas kaa drushtikon isse multya bhinn he
 According to this, it is the duty of a human being to do the absolute best of life
 yah kartavya use samaaj ke sadsy kii haisiyat se hi nibhaana he
 Achievement and effort are the real "auspicious"
 sadachaar kaa aadhaar he santulit jivan or santulit jivan ke do siddhant hai : "chung" kaa siddhant arthath apane vyaktitv kii ucchtam maangon ko santusht karte raho or "shu" kaa siddhant, arthath vishwa se samasvarta nirmaan karte hue jivan vyateet karo
 Like Aristotle's "golden middle way", Confucian's ethics is also anti-semitism
 menshisy -mentious kaa achaarshastra kanfushas ke siddhant par hi aadhaarit he, parantu usamen samaajakalyaan kii apeksha maanavvaad par adhik jor diya gaya he
 Many Chinese philosophers were also dissatisfied with the mysticism and exaggeration of the "tao" and the Confucian tradition, formal teachings
 isliye bahut se aise panthon kaa aavirbhaav hua jinhone yaa to samjhaute kaa maarg apanaaya yaa jivan ke kisi vishisht paksh ko lekar ek nae achaardarshan kii sristi kii
 For example, the cult of "motsu" was utilitarian
 sadacharan kaa maapdand "adhiktam upyog" he, parantu iskaa saadhan he prem yaa maitri
 The conflict is so immoral that it becomes redundant and "wasteful"
 "fasia" panth ne achaarshastra ko raajnneeti ke sameep pahunchaa diya or kaha ki rajasatta tathaa vidhaan se hi sadachaar kii raksha kii ja sakati he
 a fervent attempt to coordinate "tao" and Confucianism can be seen in the "yin-yang" doctrine
 vishwa main do shaktiyaan lagaataar kaam karti rahati hai-"yaang", jo kriyasheel, sakaaratmak, "purushochit" he or "yin", jo niskriy, nakaaratmak, "striyochit" he
 A
 Both tendencies are reflected in every object, institution and relationship
 inkaa uchit maatra main vaastavya hi "shubh" paristhiti he
 And it is human's duty to create such a situation
 madhyayugin chini achaarshastra par buddha vichaaron kii spasht chhap he
 Mahayana and especially secondary philosophy developed more rapidly in China than Theravada
 parantu nagarjun ke "shoonyavad" ko paramparaagat "vyaavhaarikta" ke saanche main dhalkar chini vichaarkon ne buddha jeevandarshan ko ek nai disha pradaan kii
 The slogan of this new philosophy is: "one in the aggregate and one in the composite"
 ming yug 12veen or 13veen shatabdi ke achaardarshan main ndehwaad or atibhautikwaad ke spasht chinh hai, lekin "ming" yugin saanskrithik punarutthan ke baad chini vichaardhaara phir buddhivaad kii ore jhuki
 Since then, the ethos of China has remained predominantly intellectual until the modern era
 zarathustravaad main acharsiddhanton ko bada mahatvapurn sthaan diya gaya he
 Certainly little can be said about Zarathustra himself
 "gaathaon" main uskaa vyaktitv aitihaasik lagata he, parantu "avesta" main vah kaalpanik puranic ban jaataa he
 Zarathustradharma is primarily dualistic
 "avesta" main "ahur" ko ekmev paramsatta ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he or kaha gaya he ki "ahur" kii abhivyakti do dishaao main hoti he
 On the one side there is darkness, on the other is darkness Root material object on one side, spirituality on the other side
 lekin "ahur" kaa ekatv keval aupchaarik he
 Accepted - Later on, Mani openly turned Zuruthism completely dualistic
 uske anusaar bhautik vastu ek swatantra shakti he jiskaa aadhyatmasakti ke saath lagaataar sangharsh chalata rahata he
 There are two divisions of human personality: one soul which is light and the other which is dark
 sankalpaikti in donon ke bich main he or kisi bhi ore jhuk sakati he
 Human is independent in direct conduct
 yadi vah chaahe to rachanaatmak alokalakti kii ore apane aapako le ja saktaa he
 Salvation from destructive dark power is possible by renouncing earthly pleasures
 bhavishya main alok kii sampurna vijay nishchit he
 Bringing that vision closer is partly dependent on human behavior
 maanviya aacharan kaa vaigyanik dhang se pareekshan sabase pehle sofist darshanik ne kiya
 BC Healthy traditions of philosophy had formed in Greece since the 7th century, but the first thinkers of Protagoras focused mainly on the external world
 theliz se anaksagores tak sabhi darshanik vishwa ke aditatv kii khoj karte rahe
 Sophists revisited the goal of philosophy and attempted to philosophically assess the direct problems of human life
 protagoras -"manushya hi prayek vastu kii kasuti he"-protagoras kii is ukti main sofist achaarshastra ke achche or bure donon ang pratibimbit hai
 While on the one hand the ethics of this statement bends towards concrete problems, on the other hand it also becomes personal and relative
 gorgius -gorgius ke sampark se protagoras kaa maanavvaad nire ndehwaad main parinat ho gaya or is ndehwaad se, darshanik str par, atiswarthwaad or sukhwad ko bal mila
 Socrates - Against these distortions, Socrates first created an ethics that, despite being idealistic, was based on real conditions
 sucraat kaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 "knowledge is virtue"
 jise uchit karmon kaa vaastavik gyaan he, uskaa aacharan thik hona hi padegaa; or agyaan kii parinti duraachaar main hona bhi utana hi anivaary he
 Sophists used to use the words "justice", "rule", "restraint", but they never gave a subtle explanation
 sucraat ne is baat par jor diya diya ki vyaktinirpeksh naitik aadarshon kaa aadhaar gyanamimasaa hi he
 The difference between "knowledge" and "information" is the same between normative ethics and traditional ethical assumptions
 sabhi kaa lakshya samaan he---"bhalaai"
 But by knowledge only "goodness" and harmony can be reconciled
 or is saamanjasy kaa saamaajik rup keval aise rajya main mil saktaa he jahaan shaskagan achche jivan kii ek kala samajhakar use aatmsaat karne kaa ytn karte rahe
 Aflatun - Plaining true allegiance to the lofty idealism of Socrates, Aflatoon Plato refined his teachings and supported them with philosophical scholasticism
 afalaatoon ke achaarshastra kaa ek pahalu vishuddh tathvik he
 The so-called "power" of the objects of the physical world is mere shadow
 vaastavik satta keval bhaavon yaa prayatnon kii he, kyonki pratyay hi nity or swasampurna hai
 The purest and higher-class effort among these is "auspicious"
 is tarah sadachaar kaa aadhaar adisatta kaa shubhatv he
 But Afaldatun's ethos also has a second, realistic side
 isamen maanav swabhaav kaa sookshm vishleshan miltaa he
 In the words of human nature k-aflatoon has three divisions of the human "soul"
 inhen ichha, samveg or buddhi se sanchaalan miltaa he
 The dominance of the third over the first two departments is the basis of virtue
 vyakti main na keval maanviya pravriti, arthath vivekshiltaa he, varan us main "pashviya" or "vanaspatiya" pravritiyaan bhi hai jo use jaivik or daihik str se upar uthne se rokatii he
 The aim of the intellect is not the destruction of these tendencies, but their rule and control
 is uddeshy kii sahi vyakhya keval saamaajik str par hi ho sakati he, na ki vyaktigat str par
 There are three classes according to the three organs of human nature in society - workers, warriors and rulers
 yah vargvibhaajan prakritik he or vargaheen samaaj kii kalpana nyaaysangat nahin he, kyonki nyaay kaa aadhaar antat: prakritik niyam hi he
 The ideal system is one in which people of every class keep practicing their virtues
 shaasha vivekshil hon, yoddha vir or shramik mehnatee tathaa vinamr
 A
 Virtues are mutually complementary and their proper use is a "moral condition"
 aisi paristhiti antatogatva tisare varg ke logon par hi nirbhar he, kyonki aichhik or samvegatmak pravritiyon ko buddhi hi kaabo main rakh sakati he
 The attitude of the ruling class should be purely philosophical, rational and for this proper education is absolutely necessary
 arestu -sucratvaadi parampara kii parinti arestu ke achaarshastra main milti he
 Aristotle reviewed various aspects of conduct in a scientific manner while analyzing and experimenting
 achaardarshan kaa swatantra "shaastra" ke rup main vikaas arestu ke "nikomekian athiks" se hi aarambh hota he
 According to Aristotle, the expression of "auspicious" occurs in two directions
 pehali disha vah he, jisamen abhyaas or praytn dwaara maanav apni nimnatar pravritiyon ko uccharit shakti ke--arthath buddhi ke-niyantran main laata he
 The virtues that are created as a result of this effort are "moral virtue"
 lekin shubhatv kaa ek doosraa madhyam bhi he-arthath buddhi dwaara vishuddh satta yaa charam satya kii khoj
 This knowledge and meditation creates "intellectual virtues"
 adarsh jivan to aise hi manan kaa jivan he
 
 parantu achaarshastra kaa pratyaksh sambandh bauddhik sadgunon kii apeksha naitik sadgunon se adhik ghanishtha he
 The principle of moral virtue is the principle of the Middle Way
 ek ore atirek or duusari ore abhaav, in donon trutiyon se bachakar hi sadachaar sambhav he
 For example, "courage" is a moral virtue
 iskaa atirek he "asaavadhaanee" or isaki nunata he "kaayarta"
 Similarly, the limits of each moral virtue can be fixed
 aryspitapas -arestu ke baad greek achaarshastra kii dhara do virdohi dishaao main vibhakt ho gai
 On one hand, Epicurus posited hedonism and on the other, genes put asceticism as the ideal
 vastav main in donon ke beej sucraat yug main hi pad chuke the
 The basic source of Epicurus' hedonism is the "cyrenic" ethos and the "stoic" system of Zeno is the basis of the anti-hedonistic philosophy of the "cynic" creed
 sireneik panth kaa pravartak aristipas tha or sinic panth kii sthapana sucraat ke shishy antistheneez ne kii thi
 Epicurus - Epicurean ethics considers satisfaction and solution as the goal of life, considering knowledge and conscience as mere means
 sukh ke prati khinchaav or du:kha kaa everjan swaabhaavik pravritiyaan hai
 The "cyrenaic" approach was originally justified, but its explanation of happiness is narrow
 keval kshanik sukh ko sarvasv samajhnaa morrkhtaa he
 Our goal is to make life overall happy
 is kriya main vishisht sukhon ko kabhi-kabhi tyaagna padataa he
 The intensity of pleasures is only one aspect, attention is also paid to their stability
 maansik shanti shareerik ichhaapoorti se adhik sukhmay he, kyonki vah hamen adhik samay tak santusht rakh sakati he
 The supreme virtue is "caution", because it protects us from pain to a extent
 zino -stoikwaad kaa sinddhant iske bilkul vipareet he
 According to Zino, conscience is everything
 sukhprapti kaa apni jagah par koi mahatv nahin he, yadhyapi vivekshil jeevankram main yadi sukh bhi mili to use jabardasti thukraana jaruri nahin he, jaisaa ki"sinikapanthi" karte the
 It is enough to consider sensual pleasures as secondary and trivial
 "prakruti ke anusaar jivan" kaa matlab he vivekshil jivan, kyonki maanav ke liye chetan, kriyasheel vivekshakti hi "prakritik" he
 The basis of virtue is self-control, duty and self-denial
 naitik vikaas ke maarg main sabase badi rukaawat he asanyam
 In spite of his strong retirement in "stoic" ideology, Zino and his followers also made considerable efforts to avoid the distorted individualism of the "cynic" creed
 madhyayugin jeevanamoolyon par stoik achaardarshan kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Seneca and Emperor Marcus Aurelius supported this philosophy
 plotinus -madhyayugin achaarshastra mukhyat: dharmik yaa aadhyatmavaadi he
 Before the fall of the Roman Empire, Greek philosophy began to be re-evaluated in terms of Christian theology
 is tarah kaa pehla mahatvapurn prayaas nakeelatunavaad main dekha ja saktaa he
 The mystical tendencies contained in Socrates - Aflatun - Aristotle's ideology have been elevated to the philosophy of Plotinus
 maanav jivan kaa sarvonchch uddeshy he "ek" athwa "paramsat" kaa aparoksh gyaan
 For this purpose, we have to make ourselves "worthy" and for this morality is necessary
 is tarah plotinus ke liye achaardarshan kaa mahatv simit or sopaksh he
 Other prominent representatives of neo-colonialism are Phyllo and Porfiri
 agaastin -sant agstin kaa "paitristik" darshan bhi ishwaranubhuti ko charam lakshya maanata he
 God-love can be the basis of real morality
 agstin ne yah kahkar ki ishwarkendrit jivan main hi "adhiktam ichhaapoorti" sambhav he, apratyaksh rup se sukhwad ke siddhant ko ek seemaa tak sweekaar kiya
 Thomas Equinus - The most developed form of medieval ethnography is in the philosophy of Saint Thomas Equinus
 ekwines ne isai dharmatatv ko afalatunavaad se arestuvad kii ore le jane kaa ytn kiya
 The research of truth and auspiciousness is possible in two parts - faith and conscience
 ye donon swatantra hai, parantu inamen koi moolbhoot virodh nahin he
 Aristodarshan is the highest success of Viveshkti
 "vishwaas" kii sabase udaatt siddhi he isamsih kaa "yatharthasangat aadhyatmavaad"
 But the successes of "conscience" and "faith" at a lower level than these can also inspire in moral life
 ishwargyan hi param shubh he
 After Equinus the "scholastic" ideology gradually became sedentary and narrow
 achaarshastra kaa swatantra astitv kareeb-kareeb samaapt ho gaya or naitik prashnon kaa vivechan isai dharamshastra kii kuch vadagrast samasyaon main shabdic uhapoh tak hi simit rah gaya
 The modern era of ethics begins with the secular philosophy of the 15th-16th centuries
 is darshan kaa ek paksh vaigyanik or prakrutivaadee he jiskaa swasth rup bekan or vikrut rup habz main jhalkata he
 In ethics, Habs is more important than Bacon
 habz kaa drushtikon bhautikwaadi he

 On the basis of the inscription of elephant elephants during the reign of Kharkhel, the ruler of Kalinga, Rappson believes the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty between 220 BCE and 211 AD, but there is a difference in various Puranas regarding the Yasan period of the Satavahanas

 On the basis of a statement mentioned in the Puranas, he has believed that the "shunga Miryatya" Kanva rulers were the servants of the Shunga rulers and ruled alongside them like the Peshwas and the founder of the Satavahana dynasty named Simuk or Shishuka ruled the Kanva king
 After killing Sushraman, he killed both the Kanva and Shung dynasties and subjugated his empire

 The statement of Vayu Purana on the basis of which Dr Bhandarkar has misinterpreted, is rightly defined by Dr Rai Chaudhary
 unke anusaar yah gandyash maatra itnaa hi bataata he ki simuk ne jab kanv vansh kaa ant kar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana kii to usne un shunga upashaskaon bhi samaapt kar diya jo ki kanv vansh ke haathon shunga shaskaon ke parajeet hone ke baad bhi bache rah gaye the
 Hence, Satavahana rulers took over the reins of their rule by ending the Kanva dynasty in 29 BC
 parantu is sab karkon ke hote hue bhi is sambhaavna se inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa ki simuk jisane 23varshon tak shashan kiya vah kuch samay pehle hi arthath pehali shatabdi i0pus0 ke madhya main hi singhasanarudh ho gaya hoga

 vah apane chhate se kaary kaal me samraat ban gaya tathaa usne dakshin pathpati tathaa apratihat chakra aadi oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kii
 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field
 shatakarni pratham kii patni nayanika athwa naganika angeey kul ke ek maharathi trankairo kii putree thi

 nasik, karle tathaa junar ke uske shilaalekh; esake bahusankhya sikken tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdaat ke dwaara uttari tathaa dakshini bharat main die gaye daan sab ke sab ye pramanit karte hai ki nahpaan ke samay main kshahraat vansh kaa samrajya kaaphi vistut tha tathaa usne satvaahan shaskaon se kaaphi bada pradesh chin kar hi apane samrajya ko itnaa vishaal banaaya tha
 Nahapan and his Jamaat Shaka Ashwadat unleashed the Satavahana power in the western Deccan by conquering Malwa, the Narmada Valley, northern Konkan, the western part of Berar and and southern Maharashtra
 ve satvaahan raja jo nahpaan ke haathon parajeet hue kadaachit sundar shatakarni, chakor shatakarni tathaa shivsaati the jinka ki kaarykaal bahut hi chota tha parantu yah paristhitiyaan adhik samay tak nahi chali tathaa gautami putr shri shatakarni ke satvaahan shaasha banate hi is kshahraat-satvaahan sangharsh main nayaa mode aayaa
 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 kuch visheshgyon dwaara gautamiputra satkarni ko raja shalivahan bhi mana jaataa he
 He united the whole of India and defended against foreign invaders
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya
 He is described as the doer of Saka, Yavan and Pahlav Sasakas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 4) dhara 370 ke tahat jo praavdhaan he unamem samay samay par parivartan kiya gaya he jinka armbh 1954 se hua
 The significance of 1954 is that in 1953, wazir-e-azam Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah of Kashmir, who was an intimate friend of Jawaharlal Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned
