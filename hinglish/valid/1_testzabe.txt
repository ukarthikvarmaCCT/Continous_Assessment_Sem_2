 Most Bauls follow Vaishnavism, in Vaishnavism, men are called Vaishnavites and women are Vaishnavi

 introduction nutan comics main hansi or tahaakon se bhare anek charitra hue hai, jiname chhutki kaa naam sabase upar aata he
 Like cartoonist Pran's lovely and bubbly Pinky, Chutki managed to make an identity in the world of Indian comics with her short but funny stories
 chhutki kaa charitra ek choti si natkhat ladki kaa he, jise hameshaa hi pile bade bade binduon vaali laal rang kii fraq pahane chitrit kiya gaya he
 According to the Indian character, he has been made a blonde in a very strange way
 khayr jo bhi ho, charitra or uski kahaniyaan hai bahut mjedaar
 The character of Chutki was designed by the Pammi group, mostly named as Pammi Bhai, later joined by the Dhammi Group
 jahaan tak rahi baat kahaniyon kii to unhen likhaa tha premnath sharma ji ne
 chhutki kii comics main kai choti-badi kahaniyaan hua karti thi - jinka koi nishchit vistaar nahin hota tha
 The first published comics of Chutki were titled - Chutki gyaat prakashit comixon kii suchi - Cover of paintings jald hi a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb is an explosive device whose base of destructive power is nuclear reaction
 yah nabhikeey sanlayan yaa nabhikeey vikhandan yaa in dono prakaar kii nabhikeey abhicriyon ke sammilan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Both types of reaction result in huge amount of energy from very few materials
 aaj kaa ek hajaar kilo se thodaa bada nabhikeey hathiyaar itani urja utpann kar saktaa he jitani kai arab kilo ke paramparaagat visphotakon se hi utpann ho sakati he
 Nuclear weapons are known as destructive weapons
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main sabase adhik shaktishaalee visphotak, jo prayukt hua tha, uskaa naam 'blockbster' tha
 In its construction, 11 tons of the most widely known explosive trinitrotoluene was used till then
 is visphotak se 2000 guna adhik shaktishaalee pratham parmaanu bam tha jiskaa visphot tii
 en
 tii
 ke 22,000 ton ke visphot ke baraabar tha
 Now more powerful atomic bombs have been made than the first atomic bomb
 parmaanu bam main visphutit hone vaala padaarth uranium yaa plutonium hota he
 Power is achieved only by nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium
 iske liye parmaanu ke cendrak main neutron se prahaar kiya jaataa he
 a very large amount of energy is obtained from this stroke
 is prakram ko bhautik vigyaani nabhikeey vikhandan kehete hai
 Neutrons are free from the neutrons in the interior of the atom's nucleus
 ye neutron anya parmaanuon par prahaar karte hai or unase phir vikhandan hota he
 They then fission other atoms
 is prakaar shrunkhlaa kriyaayein aarambh hoti hai
 The uncontrolled series of atomic bombs result in the explosion of the atom with great intensity
 uranium ke kai samasthanik gyaat hai
 Normal uranium contains 99
3 percent U-238 and 0
7 percent U-235
 you-238 kaa vikhandan utani saralata se nahin hota jitani saralata se you-235 kaa vikhandan hota he
 U-235 has three neutrons less than U-238
 neutron kii is kami ke kaaran hi you-235 kaa vikhandan saralata se hota he
 Other fissile materials used in atomic bombs are U-233 and plutonium-239
 parmaanu visphot ke liye vikhandaneey padaarth kii kranthik sanhati aavashyak hoti he
 Critical code is the minimum amount of current for a chain action
 yadi vikhandaneey padaarth kii maatra kranthik sanhati se kam he to neutron keval dhurradhurr karata rahegaa
 Increasing the volume slowly will create a time when at least one free neutron strikes a new atom and breaks it down
 aisi sthiti pahunchne par vikhandan kriya swat: chalane lagati he
 The volume of the Revolutionary Code is confidential

 aise proprietary software kaa pehle bhi astitv tha ,or yah saafe hota ja rahaa tha kii bhavisya main sab software proprietary software hi hoga
 According to Stolman's MIT friend Brewster Kahle, the change in the software's legal character was due to the US Copyright Act of 1976

 tritiy francisi ganatantr ne france par 1870 se lekar 1940 tak shashan kiya
 It was founded at the end of the Second French Empire at the time of the france-prussia War and came to an end with the defeat of France in 1940 by Nazi Germany
 1870 i
 main sidan ke yuddh main prasha ke haathon france kii sharmnaak paraajay hui thi jiske parinamswaroop france ko apane do bahumoolya pradesh alsaas evam loren prasha ko dena pade the
 After this defeat, the political situation of France became turbid and for the third time a republic was established, which is known as the Third Republic of France in history
 is paraajay ke baad napolian tritiy ko baadhya hokar aatm-samarpan karnaa padaa
 He was arrested
 jab agle din arthath 3 sitambar ko yah samachar france kii rajdhani paris pahunchaa to paris kii samast janata ke mukh par yah prashn tha ki ab kya hoga, kyonki unke dwaara 20 varsh purv sthapit raaj-satta akasmaat hi nasht ho gai
 The public now reached the decision that republican rule should be established in France
 us samay vyavasthapika sabha kaa adhiveshan ho rahaa tha
 At that time the people got the proposal passed by the House at the time that Napoleon III should be separated from the post of Emperor of France
 is prakaar napolian tritiy kaa patan hua or france main teesri baar ganatantric sarkaar kii sthapana hui
 The next day after the fall of Napoleon III, members of the House of Assembly gathered at the City Hall in Paris under the leadership of Gambetta, who decided to establish republican rule in France
 paris kii adhikansh janata ne uskaa saath diya
 At that time there were three party heads in France who were supporters of the Republic, but in some things there were enough differences among them
 kintu yah samay parsparik vaad-vivaad or ladaai-jhagade main vyateet karne kaa nahin tha, kyonki german sena badi teji ke saath france kii ore badi chali aa rahi thi
 Therefore, the people of all the parties collectively decided that the government should be formed at the earliest under the leadership of Gamebeta and Thiers
 prasha ne france par jo akraman kiya tha usamen france parajeet ho rahaa tha
 It was the desire of the gamebeta etc
 that the war should not be ended, but the royalist were in favor of ending the war
 yah vivaad itnaa teevr ho gaya ki iskaa nirnay karne ke liye ek raashtra pratinidhi sabha kaa aayojan karnaa padaa jisamen sanyog se rajasattavadiyon kii sankhya adhik thi jisase spasht hota he ki france kii janata is samay yuddh kii apeksha shaanti chaahati thi
 On 10 May 1871, a treaty was reached in France and Germany, according to which France had to lose its two prosperous provinces - Elles and Laurent
 inkaa kshetrafal das hajaar vargamil tha or isaki jansankhya 16 lakh thi
 He had to pay a lot of money to Germany as a compensation for war
 france ko metj or strassvarg ke prasiddh durgo par germany kaa adhikaar sweekaar karnaa padaa
 After the treaty with Germany, fights started in various parties
 paris kii janata ne thiurs evam raashtra pratinidhi sabha ke viruddh vidroh kiya jiske kaaran nimnlikhit the- After harshly suppressing the Paris uprising, a serious situation arose in front of Theers
 is vidroh ke kaaran france kii dasha bahut hi shochaneey ho gai thi or abhi tak france main vah sena upasthit thi jo germany kii ore se yudhkshati purti praapt karne ke liye thahari hui thi
 That army could be evacuated from France by paying three billion rupees
 aisi paristhiti main itani badi rakam kaa praapt karnaa koi saral kaary nahin tha
 Theers did not panic from this horrific situation
 usne bade utsaah tathaa saahas ke saath dhan praapt karnaa aarambh kiya
 Within two years, by giving all the money to the German army, he evacuated France from them
 uske is kaary se france kii janata kaa us par vishwaas bad gaya or vah har sambhav rup se uski sahaayta karne ke liye udyat ho gai
 After this, Theyers' attention was drawn to what kind of government and governance should be established in France now
 thiurs ke netritv main jo samayik sarkaar nirmit kii gai thi vah ganatantr ke aadhaar par thi, vah uskaa raashtrapati tha
 But there was a majority of the royalists in the National House of Representatives
 desh main shaanti tathaa suvyavastha kii sthapana hone par rajasattavadiyon ne rajasatta kii sthapana ke liye praytn karnaa chaha
 Thayers was initially a royalist, but there was so much difference among the royalists that Thayers was forced to change his views
 ab vah ganatantr kaa samarthak ban gaya jiske kaaran rajasattavadi uske virdohi ho gayi or unhone rajasatta kii sthapana ke liye khule taur par aandolan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Thiers could not bear his act
 atah usne disambar 1872 i
 main ghoshnaa kii ki yadi france main rajasatta kii sthapana kaa prayaas kiya jaayegaa to france main punah rajyakranti ho jaaegi
 The clear result of this proclamation was that the royalists turned against him
 usko ganatantrvaadiyon kaa bhi samarthan praapt nahin ho sakaa, kyonki ve usko bahut naram vichaaron vaala vyakti samajhate the
 In May 1873, a motion was passed against him by the monarchists, which made it clear that the House of Representatives had no faith in him and he was forced to resign from his post due to this situation
 ab rajtantravaadiyon ne marshan maikmahome ko raashtrapati ke pad par asin kiya
 He was a partisan of the state and announced that he would relinquish the office of president at a time when a person would be appointed king
 rajasattavadiyon main is prashn par ki kis vyakti ko raja banaaya jaye, bada vaimnasy tathaa matbhed tha or ve kisi nishchit parinaam par nahin pahunch sake
 Now the constitution of the Third Republic began to be made
 29 may san 1875 i
 ke ek prastaav dwaara nishchit kar diya gaya ki ab france main rajtantr kii sthapana na hokar ganatantr kii sthapana hogi
 The motion passed by a majority of just one vote
 iske uparaant france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan banaaya gaya jiske anusaar The Republic Government, after strengthening its position, paid special attention to the progress of the country and made the following reforms- france kii ganatantr sarkaar ke samaksh carch kaa prashn bada mahatvapurn tha
 The question was what kind of relationship the state and the church should have
 yah keval dharmik prashn hi na hokar ek raajnneetik prashn bhi tha
 The reason for this was that the clergy of France was a supporter of the monarchy and opposed to the republic
 jitne bhi aandolan rajtantr ke samarthan main hue un sabamein padri varg kaa pratyaksh athwa paroksh rup se haath avashya tha
 For this reason the supporters of the republic began to attack the rights of the church
 1877 i
 main hi gembete ne yah spasht rup se kah diya tha ki 'padri varg ganatantr kaa kattar virdohi he
 'by this time, the Church had authority over all of France's education
 france kii adhikansh janata apane bacchon ko is shiksha se mukt karne ke paksh main thi
 After the Dreyfus case, the republicans began to attack the Church's rights
 unhone uski shakti ko kam karne ke liye nimna kanoonon ko paas kiya- The defeat of Napoleon III and the Treaty of Fernfurt caused a great blow to France's honor and prestige in the international world
 is samay europea raajnneetik rang-manch par germany ke chancelar bismark kaa bolbalaa tha, jisane aisi niti kaa anukaran kiya ki europe main france kaa koi mitra nahin ban paye
 Due to France's colonial policy, its relations with Great Britain were not good and Bismarck made political treaties with other important states
 jis samay tak germany kii shashan-satta par bismark kaa adhikaar rahaa vah apni niti main safal rahaa
 But later this situation could not last
 bismark ke pad tyaagane par france or rus kii sandhi hui jo 'dwigut sandhi' ke naam se itihaas main prasiddh hui
 The reason for this treaty was that both of them feared Germany and now Germany began to openly favor Austria in the Balkan Peninsula
 iske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki akraman ke samay donon ek duusare kii sahaayta karenge
 After this, France tried to befriend great-britain
 england germany kii badhati hui shakti se ashankit rahane laga tha or usne bhi anubhav kiya ki usko kisi europea shakti se mitrataa kerani aavashyak he
 France and England ended their mutual quarrel and entered into a treaty called the Anta Cordial
 1907 i
 main rus bhi isamen sammilit ho gaya
 Thus established threesome friendship in Europe
 morocco ke prashn par europe ke vibhinn guton main sangharsh hone kii sambhaavna utpann ho gai thi, kintu aapasi samjhaute dwaara is prashn kaa nirnay kar liya gaya
 Thus, after sustained efforts, France gained its lost power and prestige in the international world and it was counted among the great nations of Europe
