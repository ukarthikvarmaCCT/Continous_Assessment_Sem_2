 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 To secure the establishment of his new kingdom, Babur faced a Rajput treaty in the Battle of Khanwa led by Rana Sanga of Chittor

 unhone sher shah suri kii kuch nitiyon ko bhi apanaaya tha, jaise kii apane prashasan main samrajya ko sarkaron main vibhajit karnaa

 Timur Lung was a ruler of the fourteenth century who founded the great Timuri dynasty
 uskaa rajya pashchim asia se lekar madhya asia hote hue bharat tak failaa tha
 It is counted among the great and inexorable conquerors of the world
 vah baralas turk khandaan main paidaa hua tha
 His father Turgai Barlas was the leader of the Turks
 bharat ke mogul samrajya kaa sansthaapak babar timur kaa hi vanshaj tha
 Taimur was born in 1336 in Mavraunnahar, a region between the rivers trans-oxiana, Trans Amu and Sir, in a place called Kesh or shahar-e-sabz
 uske pita ne islam kabool kar liya tha
 Hence, Timur was also a staunch follower of Islam
 vah bahut hi pratibhavan or mahatvakankshi vyakti tha
 Like the great Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, he also wanted to trample the whole world with his power and, like Alexander, wished for Vishwavijaya
 san 1369 main samarkand ke mongol shaasha ke mar jane par usne samarkand kii gaddi par kabja kar liya or iske baad usne puri shakti ke saath digvijay kaa kaary prarambh kar diya
 He established his military system only on Genghis Khan's method and, like Genghis, he invaded far-off countries with cruelty and ruthlessness and destroyed them
 1380 or 1387 ke bich usne khurasaan, sistan, afghanistan, faras, ajarbaijan or kurdistan aadi par akraman kar unhen adheen kiya
 In 1393 he established suzerainty over Mesopotamia over Baghdad
 in vijayon se utsahit hokar ab usne bharat par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 His nobles and chieftains were not initially ready to attack a remote country like India, but when he declared his pious mission to destroy the idolatry prevalent in India for the propagation of Islam, his nobles and chieftains attacked India
 Agreed
 murtipuja kaa vidhwans to akraman kaa bahaanaa maatr tha
 In fact, he was attracted by India's gold
 bharat kii mahan samruddhi or vaibhav ke bare main usne bahut kuch baaten sun rakhi thim
 Therefore, to plunder India's wealth, he had planned an attack
 use akraman kaa bahaanaa foundne kii avashyaktaa bhi nahin mahasoos hui
 At that time the Tughluq Sultanate of Delhi was in a miserable state due to the weak successors of Ferozeshah
 bharat kii is raajnneetik durbalata ne taimur ko bharat par akraman karne kaa swayan suavasar pradaan diya
 In early 1398, Timur first sent one of his grandchildren, Pir Mohammed, to attack India
 usne multan par gheraa daalaa or chha: maheene baad usapar adhikaar kar liya
 In April 1398, Timur himself left for India from Samarkand with a heavy army and in September he crossed the Indus, Jhelum and Ravi
 13 oktober ko vah multan se 70 mile uttar-purab main sthit tulumba nagar pahunchaa
 He looted this city and killed many of its inhabitants and enslaved many
 phir multan or bhatner par kabja kiya
 There many temples of Hindus were destroyed
 bhatner se vah aage badha or maarg ke anek sthanon ko luutata-khasotata or nivaasiyon ko katl tathaa kaid karata hua disambar ke pratham saptaah ke ant main dilli ke nikat pahunch gaya
 Here he killed one lakh Hindu prisoners

 Frightened, Tughlaq Sultan Mahmud went towards Gujarat and his wazir Mallu Iqbal escaped and hid in Baran
 duusare din taimur ne dilli nagar main pravesh kiya
 For five days, the whole city was badly looted and its unfortunate inhabitants were slaughtered or imprisoned
 pidiyon se sanchit dilli kii daulat taimur lootakar samarkand le gaya
 Taimur also took many captive women and craftsmen with him
 bharat se jo karigar vah apane saath le gaya unase usne samarkand main anek imaaraten banavaain, jinamein sabase prasiddh uski swaniyojit jama masjid he
 Timur came to India only for plunder
 uski ichha bharat main rahakar rajya karne kii nahin thi
 So, after staying in Delhi for 15 days, he left for home
 9 janvari 1399 ko usne meerut par chadhaai kii or nagar ko lutaa tathaa nivaasiyon ko katl kiya
 He then reached Haridwar where he defeated two armies of the nearby Hindus
 shivalik pahadiyon se hokar vah 16 janvari ko kangra pahunchaa or usapar kabja kiya
 After this he marched on Jammu
 in sthanon ko bhi lutaa khasota gaya or vahaan ke asankhya nivaasiyon ko katl kiya gaya
 Thus, on 19 March 1399, after extensive damage to India's life, wealth and property, he again crossed the Indus River and returned to his country from Bharatbhoomi
 bharat se lautne ke baad taimur se san 1400 main anatolia par akraman kiya or 1402 main angora ke yuddh main automan turkon ko buree tarah se parajeet kiya
 He died in 1405 when he was planning to conquer China
 taimur langs doosraa changez khaan bananaa chahta tha
 He claimed to be a descendant of Genghis, but was in fact Turk
 vah langadaa tha, isliye 'taimur langs' kehalaata tha
 He became the ruler of Samarkand after his father in 1369 AD
 iske baad hi usne apni vijay or krurta kii yatra shuru kii
 He was a great soldier, but also a complete goth
 madhya asia ke mongol log is bich main musalmaan ho chuke the or taimur khud bhi musalmaan tha
 But when he was brought up by Muslims, he would not take softly with them
 jahaan-jahaan vah pahunchaa, usne tabaahi or bhalaa or puri musiibat failaa di
 He had great pleasure in getting huge piles of male and cisterns
 purv main dilli se lagaakar pashchim main asia-kochak tak usne lakhon aadmi qatl kar daale or unke kate siron ko stupon kii shakl main jamavaya
 In 1399, Taimur had a terrible attack on India
 apni jeevani 'tujuke taimuri' main vah quran kii is aayat se hi prarambh karata he 'i paigambar kafiron or vishwaas na laane waalon se yuddh karo or un par sakhti barto
 He further writes giving the reason for his invasion of India- kashmir kii seemaa par kator nami durg par akraman hua
 He ordered all men to be murdered and women and children imprisoned
 phir un hathi kafiron ke siron ke minar khadey karne ke aadesh diye
 Then the fort of Bhatner was surrounded
 vahaan ke rajputon ne kuch yuddh ke baad haar maan lee or unhen kshamaadaan de diya gaya
 But he was attacked as soon as he was indiscriminate
 taimur apni jeevani main likhata he ki 'thode hi samay main durg ke tamaam log talwaar ke ghat utaar diye gayi
 10,000 people were beheaded in an hour
 islam kii talwaar ne kafiron ke rakt main snaan kiya
 My soldiers, treasures and grain, which had been collected in the fort for years, were looted by my soldiers
 makaanon main aag laga kar raakh kar diya
 Buildings and fortifications were demolished
 doosraa nagar sarasuti tha jis par akraman hua
 'all Kafirs were Hindu slaughtered
 unke stri or bachche or sampatti hamaari ho gai
 When Timur entered the Jat region
 usne apni sena ko aadesh diya ki 'jo bhi mil jaye, katl kar diya jaye
 'and then whatever village or town came before the army, it was looted
 purushon ko katl kar diya gaya or kuch logon, striyon or bacchon ko bandi bana liya gaya
 ' dilli ke paas loni hindu nagar tha
 But some Muslims were also prisoners
 taimur ne aadesh diya ki musalamaanon ko chhodkar shesh sabhi hindu bandi islam kii talwaar ke ghat utaar diye jaayen
 By this time, the number of Hindu inmates had reached one lakh
 jab yamuna paar kar dilli par akraman kii taiyaari ho rahi thi uske saath ke amiron ne usase kaha ki in bandiyon ko camp main nahin choda ja saktaa or in islam ke shatruon ko swatantra kar dena bhi yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hoga
 Timur writes tughlaq badshaah ko haraakar taimur ne dilli main pravesh kiya
 He came to know that the Hindus have taken refuge in Delhi with their large number of women and children and valuable things while fleeing from the surrounding countryside
 usne apane sipaahiyon ko in hinduon ko unki sampatti samet pakad lene ke aadesh diye

 In the early years of the nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the palace hills
 uske varnan ke anusaar ye pahadiyaan abhedya lagati thim
 This was a dangerous area where very few travelers dared to go
 bukanan jahaan kahin bhi gaya, vahaan usne nivaasiyon ke vyavhaar ko shatrutapurna paaya
 They were apprehensive about the company executives and were not willing to talk to them
 kai udaahranon main to ve apane ghar-baar or gaanv chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 Who are these mountain people? Why was he so suspicious of Buchanan's visit? In Buchanan's magazine we get a glimpse of the pity that these people had in the early years of the nineteenth century
 un sthanon ke bare main usne diary likhi thi, jahaan-jahaan usne bhraman kiya tha, logon se mulaakaat kii thi or unke reeti-rivaajon ko dekha tha
 Looking at the revenue records of the later decades of the eighteenth century, one can understand why these hill people were called 'pahadiya'
 ve rajmahal kii pahadiyon ke ird-gird rahaa karte the
 They used to live with the forest produce and did jhum farming
 ve jangal ke chote-se hisse main jhaadiyon ko katkar or ghaas-foons ko jalaakar jameen saaf kar lete the aarai raakh kii potash se upjaai bani jameen par ye pahadiya log apane khaane ke liye tarah-tarah kii daalen or jowar-bajra uga lete the
 They used to scrape the land a little with their hoe and used to cultivate the cleaned land for a few years, then leave it fallow for a few years and move to a new area so that the lost fertility in that land is again generated
 Used to go
 un jangalon se pahadiya log khaane ke liye mahua ke phul ikattha karte the, bechney ke liye resham ke koya or raal or kathkoyala banane ke liye lakadiyaan ikattha karte the
 The small plants that grew under the trees or the green sheets of grass-straw that were spread on the fallow ground became pastures for animals
 shikariyon, jhum kheti karne waalon, khaadya batorne waalon, kathkoyala banane waalon, resham ke keede paalane waalon ke rup main pahadiya logon kii zindagi is prakaar jangal se ghanishtha rup se judi hui thi
 They lived in their huts amidst tamarind trees and rested in the shade of mango trees
 ve puure pradesh ko apni nijee bhoomi maanate the or yah bhoomi unki pahchaan or jivan kaa aadhaar thi
 They resist the entry of outsiders
 unke mukhiya log apane samooh main ekta banaae rakhte the, aapasi ladaai-jhagade nipta dete the or anya janajatiyon tathaa maidani logon ke saath ladaai chhidane par apni janajati kaa netritv karte the
 By making these hills their base, the hill people used to attack the plains where the farmers settled and did their farming in one place
 pahadiyon dwaara ye akraman zyaadaatar apane aapako vishesh rup se abhaav yaa akaal ke varshon main jivit rakhane ke liye kiye jate the
 At the same time, this attack was also a way to show its strength to the inhabited communities in the plains
 iske alaava, aise akraman bahari logon ke saath apane raajnneetik sambandho banane ke liye bhi kiye jate the
 The zamindars living in the plains often had to lathe these hill heads regularly and buy peace from them
 isi prakaar, vyapaaree log bhi in pahadiyon dwaara niyantrit raaston kaa istemaal karne kii anumati praapt karne hetu unhen kuch pathakar diya karte the
 When such tolling hill heads were found, they used to protect the traders and also assured that no one would rob their goods
 is prakaar kuch le-dekar kii gai shanti sandhi adhik lambey samay tak nahin chali
 It was disbanded in the last decades of the eighteenth century when the boundaries of the area of stable cultivation began to be aggressively extended to eastern India
 angrejon ne jangalon kii kataai-safaai ke kaam ko protsaahit kiya or jameendaaron tathaa jotdaaron ne parati bhoomi ko dhan ke kheton main badal diya
 The expansion of permanent agriculture was necessary for the British because it could increase the sources of revenue, create crops for export and establish a stable, well-organized society
 ve jangalon ko ujaad maanate the or vanavaasiyon ko asabhy, barbar, updravi or krur samajhate the jin par shashan karnaa unke liye kathin tha
 So they realized that by clearing the forests, they would have to set up a permanent farm there and domesticate and civilize the wild people and get rid of hunting and persuade them to take up farming
 jyon-jyon sthaayee kashi kaa vistaar hota gaya, jangalon tathaa charaagahon kaa kshetra sankuchit hota gaya
 This intensified a quarrel between the hill people and the permanent cultivators
 pahari log pehle se adhik niyamit rup se based hue gaanvon par hamale bolne lage or gramvaasiyon se anaaj or pashu chin-jhapat kar le jane lage
 The colonial authorities were excited and tried their best to control these hills but it was not easy for them to do so
 1770 ke dashak main british adhikariyon ne in pahadiyon ko nirmul kar dene kii krur niti apana lee or unka shikaar or sanhaar karne lage
 Subsequently, in the 1780s, Augustus Cleveland, the collector of Bhagalpur, proposed a policy of peace-keeping according to which the hill chiefs were to be given an annual allowance and in return they had to take the responsibility of keeping their men well
 unase yah bhi aashaa kii gai thi ki ve apni bastiyon main vyavastha banaae rakhenge or apane logon ko anushaasan main rakhenge
 But many Pahariya chiefs refused to accept the allowance
 jinhone ise sweekaar kiya unamem se adhikansh apane samudaay main apni satta kho baithe
 With the colonial government becoming salaried, they came to be considered as subordinate employees or paid heads
 jab shanti sthapana ke liye abhiyaan chal rahe the tabhi pahadiya log apane aapako shatrutapurna sanyabalon se bachaane ke liye or bahari logon se ladaai chaalu rakhane ke liye pahaado ke bhitari bhaagon main chale gaye
 So when Buchanan visited the region in the winter of 1810–11, it was only natural that the Paharians would look at Buchanan with suspicion and mistrust
 shanti sthapana ke abhiyaanon ke anubhav or krurtapurna daman kii yaadon ke kaaran unke man main yah dharna ban gai thi ki unke ilaako british logo kii ghuspaith kaa kya asar hone vaala he unhe aise prathit hota tha ki prayek gora aadmi ek aisi shakti kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahaa he jo unase unke jangal or jameen chin kar unki jivan style or jivit rahane ke sadhano ko nasht karne par utaaru hai
 In fact, these days he was getting information about a new threat and that was the arrival of Santhal people
 santhal log vahaan ke jangalon kaa safaaya karte hue, imarti lakdi ko katate hue, jameen jotate hue or chaaval tathaa kapaas ugaate hue us ilaako main badi sankhya main ghuse chale aa rahe the
 As the Santhal settlers had taken possession of the lower hills, the hills had to retreat to the palace hills and inward
 pahadiya log apni jhum kheti ke liye kudaal kaa prayog karte the isliye yadi kudaal ko pahadiya jivan kaa pratik mana jaae to hal ko nae bashindon ;santhalon kii shakti kaa pratinidhi maananaa hoga
 This battle between Hull and Kudal lasted for a long time
 san 1810 ke ant main, bukanan ne ganjuriya pahaad, jo ki rajmahal shrankhlaon kaa ek bhaag tha, ko paar kiya or aage ke chattani pradesh ke bich se nikalakar vah ek gaanv main pahunch gaya
 Although it was an old village, the land around it had just been cleared for farming
 vahaan ke bhudashya kaa dekhakar use pataa chalaa ki ‘maanav shram ke samuchit prayog se’ us kshetra kii to kaaya hi palat gai he
 He wrote, "enough plowing has been done in Ganjuria, which shows how many magnificent areas can be changed
 i think, its beauty and prosperity can be developed like any region of the world
" yahan kii jameen alabatta chattani he lekin bahut hi zyada badhiya he or bukanan ne utani badhiya tambaakoo or sarson or kahin nahin dekhin
 On inquiring, he came to know that the Santhals had increased the boundaries of the agricultural area considerably
 ve is ilaake main 1800 ke aas-paas aae the unhane vahaan rahane vaale pahari logon ko neeche ke dhaalon par bhaga diya, jangalon kaa safaya kiya aarai fir vahaan bas gaye
 The Santhals started coming to Bengal around the 1780s
 jameendaar log kheti ke liye nayi bhoomi taiyaar karne or kheti kaa vistaar karne ke liye unhen bhaade par rakhte the or british adhikariyon ne unhen jangal mahalon main basane kaa nimantran diya
 When the British failed to settle the hills in one place for their permanent agriculture, their attention went towards the Santhals
 pahadiya log jangal kaatane ke liye hal ko haath lagane ko taiyaar nahin the or ab bhi updravi vyavhaar karte the
 Whereas, on the contrary, Santhals appeared to be ideal residents, as they had no hesitation in clearing the forests and plowing the land with full force
 santhalon ko jaminen dekar rajmahal kii talahati main basane ke liye taiyaar kar liya gaya
 By 1832, a large tract of land was demarcated as damin-i-koh
 ise santhalon kii bhoomi ghoshit kar diya gaya
 They had to live within the area, plow by plowing and become permanent farmers
 santhalon ko di jane vaali bhoomi ke anudaan-patr main yah shart thi ki unako di gai bhoomi ke kam-se-kam dasven bhaag ko saafe karke pehle das varshon ke bheetar jotna tha
 The entire area was surveyed and its map drawn
 iske chaaron ore khambe gaadkar isaki parisima nirdhaarit kar di gai or ise maidani ilaake ke sthaayee kashkon kii duniya se or pahadiya logon kii pahadiyon se alag kar diya gaya
 After the demarcation of damin-i-koh, the settlements of the Santhals grew rapidly, the number of Santhal villages which were 40 in 1838 rapidly increased to 1,473 by 1851
 isi avadh main, santhalon kii jansankhya jo keval 3,000 thi, badhkar 82,000 se bhi adhik ho gai
 As the cultivation expanded, so did the revenue amount of the company's vault
 unnisvin shatabdi ke santhal geeton or mithkon main unki yatra ke lambey itihaas kaa baar-baar ullekh kiya gaya he: unamem kaha gaya he ki santhal log apane liye basane yogya sthaan kii khoj main baraabar bina thake chalate hi rahete the
 Now coming here in damin-i-koh, as if his journey had come to a complete halt
 jab santhal rajmahal kii pahadiyon par based to pehle pahadiya logon ne iskaa pratirodh kiya par antatogatva ve in pahadiyon main bheetar kii ore chale jane ke liye majaboor kar die gaye
 They were prevented from coming downstream into the lower hills and valleys and confined to the rocky and more barren areas of the Ei Pari hills and the inner dry parts
 isse unke rahan-sahan tathaa jivan par bura prabhaav padaa or aage chalakar ve garib ho gaye
 Jhoom farming depends on the ability to find new lands and utilize natural fertility of the land
 ab sarvaadhik urvar jaminen unke liye durlabh ho gayi kyonki ve ab damin kaa hissaa ban chuki thim
 Therefore, the Pahadia people could not carry on their farming methods; Jhoom farming successfully
 jab is kshetra ke jangal kheti ke liye saafe kar die gaye to pahadiya shikariyon ko bhi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In contrast, the Santhal people had abandoned their previous nomadic lives
 ab ve ek jagah bas gaye the or bazaar ke liye kai tarah ke vanijyik fasalon kii kheti karne lage the or vyapaariyon tathaa sahukaaron ke saath len-dein karne lage the
 However, the Santhals soon realized that the land they had started cultivating was getting out of their hands
 santhalon ne jis jameen ko saafe karke kheti shuru kii thi us par sarkaar ;rajya baari kar laga rahi thi, sahuukaar ;diku log bahut oonchi dar par byaaj laga rahe the or karj adaa na kiye jane kii surat main jameen par hi kabja kar rahe the or jameendaar log damin ilaake par apane niyantran kaa daawa kar rahe the
 By the 1850s, the Santhals had begun to realize that the time had come to revolt against landlords, moneylenders and colonial rule, to create an ideal world for themselves, where they ruled
 1855-56 ke santhal vidroh ke baad santhal pargane kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya, jiske liye 5,500 vargamil kaa kshetra bhagalpur or birbhum jilon main se liya gaya
 The colonial Raj hoped that the Santhal people would be satisfied by creating a new pargana for the Santhals and implementing some special laws in it
