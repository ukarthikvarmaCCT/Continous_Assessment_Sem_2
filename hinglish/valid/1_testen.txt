 René Descartes, who devoted much of his time to the study of the pineal gland, called it "the seat of the soul"
 He believed that it is the confluence-place between the body and the intellect
 descartes dwaara aisa maanane ke kaaran se sambandhit praasangik uddhran he, My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed
 The reason i believe this is that i cannot find any part of the brain, except this, which is not double
 Since we see only one thing with two eyes, and hear only one voice with two ears, and in short have never more than one thought at a time, it must necessarily be the case that the impressions which enter by the two eyes or by the two ears, and so on, unite with each other in some part of the body before being considered by the soul
 Now it is impossible to find any such place in the whole head except this gland; moreover it is located in the most suitable possible place for this purpose, in the middle of all the concavities; barook di spinoja ne baad main iskaa khandan kiya: For he maintained, that the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain, namely, to that part called the pineal gland, by the aid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body, and also external objects, and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various ways 


 Such is the doctrine of this illustrious philosopher; it is one which, had it been less ingenious, i could hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man
 Indeed, i am lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who had stoutly asserted, that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from self-evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which occult qualities are commonplace
 What does he understand, i ask, by the union of the mind and the body? "piniyal-aankh" kii avadharana francisi lekhak jarges batel ke darshan kaa centre rahi he, jise vidwaan sahityakar denis holier ne apane adhyayan against architekchar main savistaar vishleshit kiya

 Vidyadhar Bhattacharya
 vidyadhar bharat ke nagar-niyojan ke purodha the
 286 years ago, his role in realizing the dream of Amber Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of a well-organized and modern city like Jaipur was most decisive and important
 ganit, shilpashaastra, jyotish or sanskrit aadi vishyon main unki asaadhaaran gati thi
 Vidyadhar was a gaud-brahmin of Bengal descent, whose ten Vedic Brahmin ancestors came to Jaipur at the time of bringing the rock of Kuldevi Durga Shiladevi of Amer-state from Khulna-sub-region of Jessore (now Bangladesh)
 unheen main se ek ke vanshaj vidyadhar the
 a noted scholar and researcher of Jaipur history, Dr
 Aseem Kumar Rai has written on the basis of a horoscope received from the Pothikhana of city-palace, Jaipur, - 'vidyadhar was born Vaishakh Shukla Dashami in Bengal, Gyanendra Chakraborty in Vikram Samvat 1750, in Amer
 Santosh Ram was born in the house of the famous
 unki mrityu phalgun sudi navami samvath 1807 ko jaipur main hui
 According to the research of Dr
 Aseem Kumar Rai, the earliest mention of Vidyadhar's name in the old papers of the Jaipur Durbar was available in Samvat 1775, when he was working on the post of 'naib-daroga' in Amar's 'mahkama-hisab'
 Were
 samvath 1781 main vidyadhar ke mamaa krishnaram ko apni putree or bhaanje vidyadhar ke vivaah ke liye darbar kii or se 5 hazaar rupee bataur parvarish die jane kaa likhit ullekh mila he
 Sawai Jaisingh sat on the throne of Amber in 1699–1700 AD after the death of his father Maharaja Vishnusinh in the battle in Kabul - six years after the birth of Vidyadhar - who was unusual for one of his often anonymous accounting clerks
 Not only was talent recognized and respected; Rather, in 1729, he was promoted and given the important post of 'desh Diwan' of the Amer state
 san 1743 main savai jaisingh ke dehavsaan ke baad bhi vidyadhar shashan main rahe or samay-samay par sammanit or puraskrit hote rahe
 Vidyadhar's name as a city planner and head-architect of Jaipur is not an introduction
 vah kai avasaron par apni pratibha pradarshit kar chuke the or savai jaisingh ko unki medha or yogyata par puraa bharosa tha isliye san 1727 main amer ko chhod kar jab paas main hi ek nayaa nagar banane kaa vichaar utpann hua to bhala vidyadhar ko chhod kar is kalpana ko kriyanvit karne vaala bhala doosraa or koun hota? lagbhag chaar saal main vidyadhar ke maargdarshan main nae nagar ke nirmaan kaa aadharbhoot kaam puraa hua
 Jaisingh first named it after his name, 'sawai Jayanagar', which was later abbreviated to 'sawai Jaipur' and eventually became more popular in common parlance as 'jaipur'
 1734 isvi main jaipur main saat-khand ke rajmahal ' ' kaa nirmaan jahaan vidyadhar ne karavaaya, vahiin is se pehle san 1726-27 main amer main durgam or prasiddh kile jaigarh kii tamir bhi inhone hi shilpashaastra ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par karwaai - jiske turant baad inhen amer rajya kaa rajasav-mantri kaa ohada mila
 The old city was surrounded by tall, strong enclosures, with seven doors made for entry
 bahut baad main ek or dwaar bhi bana jo 'new get' kahalaaya
 The entire city is divided into six parts of the same size and is divided by 111 feet wide roads
 prasaad-bhaag main hawamahal parisar, taunhaal, talkatoraa, govinddev mandir, udyaan evam vedhashala aadi hai, to puraane shahar ke uttar-pashchimi ore kii pahari par nahargarh, shahar ke mukut jaisaa lagata ek kila
 Vidyadhar's city planning today is a standard-example in many universities in India and abroad, dividing the city according to Vastu Shastra in different blocks on the basis of right-angled routes, developing specialized hot-markets, and constructing many constructions to enhance its beauty
 As students are taught

 Russian Indian scholar A
 A
 Korotskaya has expressed in detail about the specific architecture of Vidyadhar and Jaipur in the city of India in his famous book
 savai jaisingh ke samakaleen, sanskrit or brajabhasha ke mahakavi shrikrishnabhatta kaviklanidhi ne apane itihaas-kavyagranth ishwarvilas mahakavy main vidyadhar kii prashasti main kaha he "bengalaypravar vaidicagaudwipro: kshipraprasadsulabh: sumukh:kalavan vidyadharosspati mantriwaro nripasyarajadhirajaparipujit: shuddh-buddhi:" bhavarth yah ki maharaja jaisingh kaa mantri vidyadhar goud jati kaa bengali-brahman he, dekhne main bada sundar or bolne main bada saral swabhaav kaa he, vibhinn kalaon main nishnaat shuddh buddhi vaale ko maharajaadhiraj jaisingh bada maan-sammaan dete hai
 "kavishiromani Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri published his famous poetry-book jaipur-vaibhavam in 1947 in 476 pages, then the immortal architecture of Vidyadhar - the city beauty, scenic places, temples, routes, respected citizens, festivals and festivals of Jaipur etc
 Had focused on san 1727 main jaigarh puraa hone par inhen 'siropav' sammaan mila, 1734 main chandramahal banavaane par punah siropav or san 1735 main jhotwada ke paas 'darbhavati nadi' / 'drayavati' se nahar banavaa kar uskaa pani jaipur shahar main laane par ek bada rajasamman 'siropav' mila
 About this, Yadunath Sarkar wrote on page 196 of his book 'history of Jaipur' - "as is evident from the Jaipur State papers, Vidyadhar's honor and rank as an architect was certainly high in jaipur-sarkar
 san 1729 isvi main unhen 'desh-dewan' pad par padonnat kiya gaya, san 1734 main 'saat-manzil ke rajmahal ko sheeghra puraa karwaane' or varsh 1735 main 'drayavati' nadi kaa pani jaipur main laane' ke uplakshya main ke liye rajya se sammanit kiya gaya
 This is also confirmed by the Jaipur inscriptions - he also received many honors and awards, including the evidence of an elephant being presented to him on 23 February 1751
 


"jaipur rajdurbar main vidyadhar kaa sammaan itnaa tha ki "unke putr muralidhar chakravarti ko na keval apane pita kaa pad saunpa gaya balki 5,000 rupee salanaa kii vaarshik aay kii jaagir bhi

 The Jaipur Development Authority has established an entire huge suburb named 'vidyadhar Nagar' on the jaipur-sikar Road in his name from the map of famous architect Balakrishna Vitthal Das Doshi of Ahmedabad
 itihaas se gyaat hota he ek putr muralidhar ke alaava vidyadhar ke do putriyaan bhi thim- mayadevi or comyadevi

 According to the information of Surajbaksha, a descendant of Vidyadhar, "meghnath Bhattacharya, the younger brother of Mahamahopadhyay Harprasad Shastri, had published a very important commentary on his ancestor Vidyadhar in 'sahitya-parishad-patrika' in 1904 AD
 is vivaran ko samvath 1322 main kalakatta ke gyanendra mohan das ne apni bangala-pustak 'bagaiyr bahire bangaali' main bhi shaamil kiya tha
 According to this description: "yashohar's king Vikramaditya sent his son Pratapaditya to Agra to know the Mughal rule
 jab vah agra pahunchne se pehle kuch din mathura main tha, to use vahaan grenite kii ek kaali shila mili jiske bare main yah baat itihaas main prasiddh thi ki yah shila vahi he, jis par ek ke baad ek patake kar mathura ke raja kansa ne devaki kii saat santanon ko maar daalaa tha

 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal
 yah dwipadi namakaran parampara ko baad main namavali ke jaivik code main badalane kaa kaam sabase pehle liyonheart phuks dwaara prayog kiya gaya or maanak ke rup main kerolas lineyas dwaara 1753 main spasis plantaram main jari kiya gaya
 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp
 " or bahuvachan main "spp
 " ko vishesh naam par rakhaa jaataa he: udhaaharan ke liye, kenis sp
 aisa aamtaur par nimnlikhit sthitiyon main hota he: In books and articles, the names of genus and castes are usually printed in italics
 "sp
" or "spp
" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA – DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue

 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai
 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness
