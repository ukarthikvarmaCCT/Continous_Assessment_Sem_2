 The pluralistic concept of democracy developed mainly in America
 iske pranetaon main es
 em
 linset, robert daal, ve
 presnts, epa
 hunter aadi pramukh hai
 He argues that political power is not as simple as it appears, it is divided between the elite groups including various groups, organizations, classes and associations which usually provide leadership to society
 vibhinn swaarth samooh apni maangon ko sidhe taur par to prastut karte hi hai, vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke madhyam se bhi pesh karte hai
 a definition of pluralistic democracy is given as follows
 yah ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jisamen nitiyaan vibhinn samoohon ke bich parsparik paraamarsh or vichaaron ke aadan pradaan ke dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he kyonki koi bhi samooh yaa abhijanvarg itnaa shashakt nahi he ki vah akele sarkaar par itnaa dabaab daal sake ki vah uski sari maangon ko puraa kar sake
 The pluralists approve of this partnership of power that it benefits that no social group can dominate the policy-making process of the government so that it can ignore the interests of other classes
 lekin, bahulwaadi siddhantakaaron kii ek manyata yah bhi thi ki sabhi nagarikon ko raajnneetik kshetra main apane hiton ko sanghatit karne or unhen saadhane ke liye vaidhanik avasar or aarthik sansaadhan praapt hai
 Without this opportunity, citizens cannot support or oppose any proposed move
 bahulwaadi vichaarak raajnneeti ko vyaktiyon ke badale samoohon ke bich nishchayon kii prakriya maanate hai or ghoshnaa karte hai ki loktantr sarvottam tareeke se tabhi kaam karata he jab naagarik apane vishesh hiton ke samarthak samooh se jud jate hai
 They emphasize that there should be active participation of individuals in a society and join different groups to implement their resolve
 saath hi, saare samoohon or unke sadasyon ko yah sweekaar karnaa chahie ki chunaav raajnneetik nirnyon main vishaal samudaay kii sahabhaagita kaa ek kargar hathiyaar he
 Similarly, all groups and members of the elite class make democracy possible through mutual competition
 isse spasht he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth vastav main abhijanwaad kaa purnatah virodh nahin karata kyonki iske pravartakon ke anusaar abhijanvarg kaa astitv ek hakeekat he or ve uski avasthiti se santusht he
 This is the reason that pluralistic theories are sometimes considered to be only partially different from elite principles
 mahaan america raajnneetik vichaarak robert daal loktantr kii abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi abhidharanaon ko sanyukt karte hue apni loktantric abhidharana ko bahutantr kii sangya detaa he
 According to him, the public is active through both groups and politicians of the elite
 usne anek aise samudaayon kaa hawala diya he jo sarkaar ke niti-nirdhaaran ko prabhavit karte hai- jaise, vyapaaree gharaane or udyogpati, saudagar, shramik sanghathan, kisaan sanghathan, upabhokta, matadaata ityadi
 It is not that their entire agenda is implemented
 saare samooh samaan rup se shashakt nahin hote or anek samooh apni manonukoolnitiyon ko manwaane kii apeksha pratikulanitiyon kii rokthaam main zyada prabhavi hote hai
 Among the objections raised against the pluralist doctrine are the following: raajnneeti kriyalap main sahabhaagita loktantr kaa mul tatva he, lekin khaskar poonjivadi loktantron main yah praayah chunaavon main matdaan tak hi simit rahata he
 The participatory principle of democracy considers augmented participation as an ideal as well as a practical necessity
 is siddhanth ke pramukh prastaavkon main 1960 ke dashak se carol perlman, si
 bi
 macmmersan or en
 polant jaas jaise vampanthi vichaarak pramukh rahe hai
 Following are the two salient features of participatory democracy: sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But this consumption is also possible only when the person is independent and equal
 yadi logon kaa vishwaas ho ki nitigat nirnyon main kargar sahabhaagita ke avasar vastav main vidyaman na hai to ve nishchay hi sahabhaagi banenge
 In such a situation, they will also be able to partner effectively
 jis loktantr main, chaahe vah raajnneetik ho yaa pravidhik yaa shilpatantric abhijanvarg kaa varchasv hota he vah nagarikon ke liye santoshprad nahi hota or amlog sahabhaagita ke dwaara hi us varg ke varchasv ko samaapt kar sakate hai
 Proponents of participatory theory also state that in today's industrial and technological societies, the standard of education has been elevated and the gap between elite and non-elite has reduced in a society rich in intellectual and political consciousness
 isliye kaaryakshmata or vikaas kii drushti se adhikansh maamalon main saamaanya logon kii sahabhaagita koi baadha nahin rah gai he
 Frankly speaking, the denuclearization of power is the strongest defense against tyranny
 sahabhaagita par aadhaarit loktantr hi nagarikon ko tatasthta, agyaan or algaav se bachaa saktaa he or loktantr kii buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The question is, how should the political participation of the common citizen? Its theorists have given the following ways: macmmersan kii tippanee he ki aaj ke raashtra kshetra or jansankhya kii drushti se vishalkay hai or yah sambhav nahin he ki saare naagarik rosemare ke raajnneetik vimarsh yaa niti nirdhaaran main shaamil hon, phir bhi yadi kuch sharto ko sweekaar kar liya jaae to sahabhaagita kaa anupaat nishchit rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa ha
 These conditions are: david held ne sahabhaagita siddhanth par aapatti uthaate hue kaha ki yah puraatan / abhijan bahulwaadi jaise siddhanton se behatar to he, lekin isse yah spasht nahin ho paata ki kaise or kyon sirf sahabhaagita maanviya vikaas, jo loktantr kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshya he, ke ucchtar str ko praapt kar sakegi
 There is no evidence or rational basis that participation will make citizens more cooperative and committed to the common interest
 held is kendriya manyata ko bhi aavashyak rup se satya nahin maanata ki aam log apane jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par niti nirdhaaran karne or nirnay lene main adhik uttaradaayi bananaa chaahate hai
 If they do not want to participate in the determination of socio-economic matters and policies, then it cannot be considered appropriate to force them
 phir bhi maan liya jaae ki aam log apane loktantric rujhaan ko yadi ek seemaa se aage le janaa chahen or buniyadi swatantraaa or adhikaar ke maamle main dakhlandaji karne lage to loktantr kaa kya hashr hoga, aise prashnon par sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon ne paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Cook and Morgan, the realization of participatory democracy is not as easy as it seems on the top
 udaahranarth, sahabhaagi ikai ke samyak aakaar or krity kya hon phir, nagarikon kii sakriy sahabhaagita ke bal par sthaneey staron par liye gaye nirnyon ko sampurna raashtra ke hit ke saath kis prakaar samanvit evam samekit kiya jayega? ek sthaneey sahabhaagi ikai ke nitigat maamle duusari ikai ke virdohi bhi to ho sakate hai
 Then there is one thing that decisions taken on the basis of maximum possible participation are not necessarily the most effective decisions
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthak kaaryakshmata evam prabhaav ke muddon par paryaapt dhyaan nahin dete
 Contrary to popular belief, the idea of democracy has also been accepted by Marx and later Marxist thinkers
 itnaa avashya he ki unki loktantr-sambadhi abhidharana paashchaatya udaaravaadi loktantric abhidharanaon se purnatah bhinn he
 Since the Marxists believe that the democratic right in the capitalist system is not in the true sense, but only in the hands of the resource-rich class, they want to establish a democracy that is 'public democracy'
 marxvaadi loktantr main utpaadan ke sadhano par swaamitv ko khatm karne or sarvharavarg dwaara arthvyavastha ko niyantrit karne ke pashchaat samaajawaadee loktantr kii sthapana hoti he
 Marx was a critic of liberal constitutional democracy because according to him the basis of capitalist democracy is an economic system in which the means of production are always under the control of the capitalist class
 yahi puunjipati varg apni dhan-shakti ke bal par raajnneetik vyavastha kii niyantran main rakhkar sarkaar or rajya-tantra ko apane adheen rakhata he
 State power, rights and privileges rest solely with the same class and the working class only has the freedom and rights of name
 rajya kaa adhikari varg, nyaayalay or police bal bhi tatasth na hokar prabhutasampann varg ke hi hit sadhak hote hai
 Therefore, democracy takes the form of a system of governance which is used to promote the power and privilege of the ruling class and to serve the interests of the upper class
 iske baavjood, marks or angels ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki sampann puunjipati varg dwara niyantrit udaaravaadi burjua loktantr bhi kisi had tak apane nagarikon ko vaastavik adhikaar dene ke aitihaasik daawey kar saktaa he or shramik varg iskaa istemaal apane ko sangathit kar sarvhaara kii kranti ke liye kar sakate hai
 In liberal democracies, the common franchise can be used to set the background of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat
 marxvaadi yah avashya maanate hai ki kuch sthitiyon main hinsak krantikari aandolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he lekin aisi sthitiyon kii sambhaavna atyalp he
 Even if the parliamentary route is adopted to meet the goal of socialist revolution, it can only be an additional tool in other types of conflicts
 marxvaadi vishleshan ke anusaar vaastavik loktantr sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko kaayam karne ke liye sarvharavarg kii kranti ke pashchaat hi sambhav he kyonki udaaravaadi bujuar loktantr kaa adarsh pratibhagita kaa ho saktaa he, lekin yatharth main saadhanheen shramik varg kii sahabhaagita usamen nahin ho paati
 In his work The Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx and Engels wrote in a clear explanation of their concept: 'between capitalist and communist societies lies the period of conversion of one into the other
 isi se mail khaati ek raajnneetik sankraman kii avadhi bhi hoti he jisamen rajya sarvhaara varg ke adhinayakawad or samyawad main bhed kiya he
 They consider it an intermediate period
 isaki parinti samyavaadee samaaj kii sthapana main hoti he
 It is important to understand in what sense Karl Marx and Engels used the term totalitarianism
 unki drushti main prayek rajya shaasha saamaajik varg kaa adhinayakawad rahaa he
 In the capitalist system, this class belonged to the thriving industrial and merchant bourgeoisie, while the state with its own concept would be a state controlled by the proletariat immediately after the revolution and then the process of socialist reconstruction would begin which would end in the establishment of a classless society
 isliye, unki drushti main loktantr or sarvhaara adhinayakawad ek hi saath chalenge, thik vaise hi jaise ki poonjivadi vyavastha main udaaravaadi loktantr vyavharytah loktantr bhi or udyogpatiyon evam vyapaarik gharaanon ke burjua varg kaa adhinayakawadi shaasha bhi
 Therefore, Marx and Engels said that the system after the revolution and the hegemony of the working class would be the system of 'people's democracy'
 janata se unka taatpary muththibhar sampann burjua ke sthaan par jansamanya kii vishaal aabaadi se tha
 The following are the salient features of 'people's democracy' as propounded by Marx: samaajawaadee samaajon kii rachana ne marxvaadi vichaaron ko or aage badhaayaa, lenin jisane rus main 1917 main pratham samaajawaadee rajya kii sthapana kii ne marxvaadi chintan kii nai vyakhyaayein prastut kii
 He accepted the totalitarianism of the proletariat and emphasized its importance of socialist revolution, but he also added with it that the totalitarianism of the proletariat can be exercised only by a large proletarian organization or communist party
 usne loktantr kii teen avasthaaen bataaiah poonjivadi loktantr, samaajawaadee loktantr or samyavaadee loktantr
 According to him, democracy is a form of state and in a class-divided society, the government is both totalitarian and democratic
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power
 lenin sweekaar karata he ki nav sthapit samaajawaadee rajya utana hi damanaatmak hota he jitna ki poonjivadi rajya
 It is also necessary to implement the rule of the proletariat
 chunki burjua kaaphi shaktishaalee hota he, isliye samaajawaadee loktantr ke aarambhik daur main sarvhaara varg ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he ki vah balpurvak poonjivadi varg kaa unmoolan kar de
 The dictatorship of the proletariat has two goals: lenin ke anusaar yah kaary mukhya rup se samyavaadee dal ko karnaa padataa he
 Thus, in Lenin's view, capitalist democracy does not have true democracy, whereas proletarian authoritarianism has more secular democracy, as it is the rule of the majority proletariat
 uskaa yah bhi daawa tha ki antatah sachche samyawad kii prapti ke saath loktantr anaavashyak ho jayega, kyonki us samaaj ke sandarbh main iskaa koi arth nahin rah jayega
 After Marx, Engels and Lenin, many thinkers have presented many interpretations of Marxism
 inamen edward bernstin, karl kotski, rojaa lukjamvarg aadi pramukh hai
 Edward Bernstein claims that Marxist interpretation of capitalism is wrong and totalitarianism of the proletariat is neither necessary nor desirable
 uske anusaar, raajnneetik loktantr or udaaravaadi swatantraaaen adhik mahatvapurn he
 Lenin does not believe that authoritarianism of the proletariat is necessary
 bernstin kaa tark he ki jab tak sarvhaara varg bahumat hasil nahin kar letaa, samaajawaadee kranti asambhav he or yadi vah bahumat hasil kar letaa he to adhinayakawad kii jarurat hi nahin rahati
 According to him, democracy is necessary and socialism can be established only by combining democratic tradition with Marxist socialist theory
 marxvaadi krantikari rojaa lakjamberg ne lenin kii loktantr- virdohi niti ke sambandh main aapatti uthaate hue kaha he ki isse vishaal janasamudaay kaa adhinayakawad nahin, vishaal janasamudaay par adhinayakawad sthapit ho jaataa he
 • The majority of the population, which is the purveyor of the non-elite, is largely non-committal, lazy and indifferent, so it is necessary to have a minority that provides leadership
 • abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 • loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 • According to the proponents of participatory theory, democracy is the real meaning of equal participation of every individual, not merely to keep the government stable as the elitist or pluralist ideologues assume
 sachche loktantr kaa nirmaan tabhi ho saktaa he jab naagarik raajnneetik drushti se sakriy hon or samuhik samasyaon main nirantar abhiruchi lete rahen
 Active participation is necessary so that the major institutions of society have adequate exchange and political parties have more openness and sense of responsibility
 • sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 • Democracy is a form of state and government is both totalitarian and democratic in a class-divided society
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power

 yah maansik aghat balak kii parivartan sheeltaa ko sakriya kar detaa he: james ke haathon se baahar nikle hue naakhadaar panjon ko nochakar or vah apane pita ke hatyare ko maar daalata he
 Taking his last breath before dying, Thomas Logan makes the revelation that he is his real father and not John Howlett
 James runs away with his father's inappropriate child Victor Creed, who is now his brother
 agali sadi main ve america sena main sainik ke rup main america grih yuddh, donon vishwa yudhon or vietnam yuddh main ladate hai
 In Vietnam, Victor tries to rape a local rural woman, but is stopped from doing so and eventually kills a high-ranking officer

 He is visited by Major William Stryker, who is now in military custody and proposes membership of a team of mutants named Team X, which includes the eagle agent Zero, the bearer's soldier Wade Wilson, teleporter John Wraith, the unbeatable Fred Dukes and legitimate energy Chris Bradley are also included
 ve dal main shaamil to ho jate hai, lekin dal ke sandigdh kaaryakalapon tathaa maanav jivan ke prati anadar bhav ke kaaran james dal ko tyaag detaa he
 Six years later, James - now bearing the name Logan - lives in Canada with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox
 karnal striker logaan ko khoj nikaalte hai or aagaah karte hai ki aisa koi he jo dal ke sadasyon kii hatya kar rahaa he, kyonki wilson or bradli donon hi mar chuken hai
 Shortly afterwards, Victor kills Kayla and brutally beats Logan
 striker logaan ko victor ko peetane ke tareeke kii peshkash karata he; logaan apane kankal ko admantium, darasal ek prakaar kaa avinashi vajra kii tarah kathor dhaatu se majboot karne ke liye shalopchaar jhelta he
 Before the process, Logan demands new dog tags written with "wolverine" - based on a story told by Kayla
 ekbar jab yah prakriya paripurna ho jaati he, striker logaan kii yaaddaasht ko mitaa dene kaa aadesh detaa he, lekin logaan ansuni kar detaa he or jiro dwaara peechha kiye jane par apane hi tareeke se ladakar bhaag nikalataa he
 Running away, Logan hides in the cellar of a middle-aged farming couple

 The very next day, Zero discovers Logan in the farm
 zero nirmamtapurvak dampati kii hatya kar detaa he or do hamviz or ek helicopter kii sahaayta se logaan par hamalaa kar detaa he
 With the help of a motorcycle and strong claws from his adamantium, Wolverine succeeds in overcoming Zero and killing him in battle

 The Dukes, now fatally fat, reveal that the striker now conducts his experiments on the mutant and also that Victor is taking new subjects for him
 unamem se ek, remi lewa, bachakar bhaag gaya he or dweep kaa sahi thikaana jaanata he
 Wraith and Logan find Gambit in New Orleans and ask about the location of the island, but Gambit suspects that Logan may have been sent to capture him again and that is why he attacks him
 is bich, vreth or victor main muthbhed ho jaati he or ve aapas main ladane lagate hai
 Victor kills Wraith and takes his blood sample for the striker
 logaan victor par hamalaa kar detaa he or apane bade hue panje se lagbhag use maar daalata he
 However, Gambit intervenes in the fight so that Victor escapes
 a scuffle goes on between Logan and Gambit, with Logan defeating Gambit and subduing him
 jab use yah yakeen ho jaataa he ki logaan striker ke liye kaam nahin kar rahaa he, gambit use striker kii suvidha vaali jagah thri miles iland par le jaataa he
 When Logan learns that Kayla is still alive, he conspires with the striker in exchange for the protection of her kidnapped sister, yet she does not realize that she really loves Logan
 jab logaan ko yah mahasoos hota he ki uske saath dhokhaa hua he to use thes pahunchati he or vah vahaan se chalaa jaataa he lekin jane se pehle vah victor ko naaraaz kar detaa he kyonki usne usase ladane se manaa kar diya tha jabaki vah logaan se ladanaa chahta tha
 When Victor demands the promised adamantium in exchange for his service, the striker declines on the grounds that Victor will not survive the process
 Victor tries to kill Kalaya when she tries to convince him that the striker has betrayed the two of them, but Logan can only hear her scream and return
 logaan victor ko ek barbar ladaai main haraa detaa he or lagbhag jaan se maar daalata he lekin jab kaayla use uski maanavtaa kii yaad dilaati he tab vah ruuk jaataa he
 In return, Logan stabs Victor by knocking him unconscious and then helps Kayla to free the imprisoned mutants

 Logan lures Vipan XI to fight at the plant's cooling tower

 ve vepan XI ke saath ladate hai or antat logaan vipan XI kaa sir katkar or pair se thokar markar shitalan tower kii sataha main thel detaa he
 Victor leaves, repeating the pledge to finish the work begun and Gambit saves Logan from the collapsing tower
 jaise hi logaan ghayal kaayla ko surakshit sthaan main le janaa chahta he, striker logaan ke lalaat par admantium ke bullate se shoot kar use behoshee ke hawaale kar detaa he
 The striker focuses his gun on Kayla, but she is able to force the striker to knock the gun down using the power of her mutant accreditation
 uske baad vah use tab tak paidal chalate rahane kaa aadesh detii he ki uske pair lahuluhaan na ho jaayen
 tab kaayla ki maut uske apane hi ghaavon se ho jaati he
 As Logan regains consciousness, Gambit returns, but the adamantium bullets that were fired on his head quickly fade his memory

 The film featured the appearance of multiple cameos, shorter versions of older film characters, including Barry windsor-smith's "weapon X" story based on Jason Striker, as well as Chris Clairemont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series re-read 
 The inspiration also includes 2001's limited series Origins, which shows Wolverine's life before Weapon X

 It was done by Goer, but the project failed, as it paid special attention to Blade: Trinity
 Blade: Trinity was similarly a failure as a byproduct

 ek baar jab vikreta aane vaale kharidaar ko apana graahak bana letaa he to aadhaar prabandhan shuru ho jaataa he
 The process that begins under Aadhaar management involves the seller developing a relationship with its customer, nurturing the relationship, increasing the benefits offered and continuously improving its product / service so that its business is protected from competitors are
 vipanan yojana kii safalataa ke liye 4 Ps kaa mishran upabhoktaaon yaa lakshith bazaar kii maangon va zaruuraton main pratibimbit hona chahie
 ek bazaar khand ko vah kharidne ke liye raji karnaa jisaki unhen zarurat nahin, bahut hi kharchila kaam he or shaayad hi kabhi safal hota he
 Marketers rely on information from both formal and informal marketing research and decide what the customer wants and how much they are willing to pay for it
 vipanak aashaa karte hai kii is prakriya se unhen ek satat pratiyogi laabh hasil hoga
 vipanan prabandhan is prakriya hetu vyaavhaarik anuprayog he
 The proposal is also an important part of the 4 Ps principle
 america vipanan sangh ke anusaar, "vipanan ek sanghathanaatmak kaary or prakriyaaon kaa ek samooh he jisase graahak banaaye jate hai, unase sampreshan kiya jaataa he or unhen upyogita pradaan kii jaati he tathaa upabhokta se rishte banaaye jate hai taaki sanghathan evam uske hitdharakon ko laabh mili
 Methods of marketing have been reported in many social sciences, especially in psychology, sociology and economics
 The influence of anthropology is also small but increasing
 bazaar anusandhan in gatividhiyon ko majbooti detaa he
 Marketing through advertising also connects to many creative arts
 vipanan ek vistrut evam kai prakashnon se bade str par paraspar sambaddh vishay he
 It is notorious for recreating itself and its terminology in a new way according to time and culture
 "vipanan" ek jaankaree dene vaala vyavsaayik kaary he jo lakshya kiye ja rahe bazaar ko company va uske utpaadon ke pratispardhaatmak laabh evam keemat ke bare suchit va shikshit karata he
 Price is the price a customer pays to own or use a product
 "pratispardhaatmak laabh " is baat ko darshata he kii company yaa uske utpaada donon apane pratidwandi se behatar aisa kuch kar rahe hai jisase upabhokta ko phayda pahunche
 The center of marketing is on delivering company and product related information to certain customers
 vipanan kaary main kai nirnay kiye jate hai kii koun si soochna deni he, kitni soochna deni he, kisko deni he, kaise deni he or kahaan deni he
 Once decisions are made, there are several methods and procedures that can be implemented in support of selected strategies
 vipanan kya he? main kris newton kehete hai vipanan ko aksar galatfahami main vigyaapan yaa bikri samaj liya jaataa he
 Marketing is defined as all the strategies and decisions that are decided in the following twelve areas: vipanan kaa dhyey he company or uske utpaadon ke liye lakshith bazaaron main praathamikta kaa nirmaan karnaa tathaa use banaaye rakhana
 kisi bhi kaarobaar kaa abhipraay hota he apane graahakon ke saath paraspar laabhakaari evam sthaayee sambandhon kaa nirmaan karnaa
 haalanki vyapaar ke sabhi kshetra isi dhyey kii prapti ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai, kintu vipanan par sabase adhik isaki jimmedaari hoti he
 If its definition is seen in a larger scope, the marketing work is done in coordination with three subjects: "product marketing", "corporate marketing" and, "marketing communication"
 ranneetik vipanan : yah nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas kii ek sanghathan bazaar main apane pratidwandiyon se kaise muqabla kare
 vishesh rup se, iskaa uddeshy apane pratiyogiyon ke saapeksh ek laabhadaayak badhat lenaa he
 Operational marketing: is to attract and retain customers and be more and more useful to them
 saath hi tatpar sevaaon dwaara graahak ko santusht karnaa or uski apekshaaon par khara utarana he
 Operational marketing involves the determination of Porter's five forces 1960 ke dashak ke armbh main, profesar nil borden ne harvard bijness skool main company ke aise kaaryon kii pahchaan kii jo utpaada yaa sevaayen kharidne ke graahak ke faisle ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Bourdain suggested that all those steps the company takes are a "marketing mix"
 professor i
jerome maikaarthi, bhi harvard bijness skool se the, unhone 1960 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main sujhaayaa kii vipanan mishran main 4 tatwon kaa samavesh he: utpaada, mulya, sthaan or sanvardhan
 In common parlance, "marketing" is the promotion of the product, especially advertising and branding, but in commercial use it means a wide range of marketing means customer-centricity
 utpaadon kaa vikaas graahakon ke ek samooh yaa kuch maamalon main kuch khaas graahakon kii aavashyaktaaon kii poorti hetu kiya jaataa he
 E
 Jerome mccarthy divided marketing into groups of four general activities
 His typology gained so much recognition worldwide that his "four P's" became part of the language
 ye chaar Ps hai: These four elements are known as the marketing mix, which a vendor uses to create a marketing plan
 kam keemat ke upabhokta utpaada ke vipanan main chaar p kaa model sabase adhik kaam aata he
 This model has to be adjusted in the case of industrial products, services, high value consumer products
 seva vipanan bejod kism kii sevaaon ke liye hona chahie
 audyogic yaa B2B vipanan, un dirghakaalin anubandhon ke liye hona chahie jo aapurti shrinkhalaa ke maamalon main vishisht hon
 sambandhon kaa vipanan main vipanan ko dirghakaalin sambandhon ke pariprekshya main dekha jaataa he bajaay vyaktigat vyavhaar ke
 Against this, Morgan suggested in Riding the Waves of Change, that one of the biggest drawbacks of the 4 Ps approach is that "it inadvertently emphasizes inward, while the essence of marketing must be outward"
 Nevertheless, 4 Ps is helpful as a memorable and workable guide and framework for the major categories of marketing work under which they can be used
 pehle se maujuud chaar Ps ke alaava sevaaon ke vipanan main teen atirikt sheershak jode gaye hai jinhen vistrut vipanan mishran kaha jaataa he
 These are: brands ek naam, shabd, dizine, pratik yaa koi anya visheshta he jo kisi utpaada yaa seva ko pratispardhi ke prastaav se alag karata he
 a brand represents the consumer's experience towards an organization, product, or service
 brands ko ek pahachaane jane yogya satta ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ek vishisht mulya kaa vaada karti hai
 Co-branding involves marketing activities involving two or more products
 mulya nirdhaaran se aashay us paise se he jo ek utpaada ke badale diya jaataa he
 This value is determined by the utility of the item, how much money and / or sacrifice the customer is willing to pay in return
 vipanan sanchaar ranneeti ke hisaab se vibhinn shreniyon ke liye vipanan sandesh taiyaar karata he or unhen tay lakshya kii ore preshit karata he
 There are separate stages of converting strangers into customers that control the communication medium used
 kisi vyakti yaa sambhavit graahakon ke samooh ko aprope karne vaale cells main dwaara maukhik prastuti: Short-term incentives to encourage product purchases iskaa ek udhaaharan he coupon yaa ek bikri
 logon ko kharidne ke liye protsaahan diya jaataa he, par isse graahak vishwaas nirmaan nahin hota or na hi bhavishya main dubaara kharidne ke liye protsaahit hota he
 a major drawback of sales growth is that it can be easily copied by competitors
 iskaa istemaal karte hue hameshaa apane utpaada ko dusro se bhinn nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Nowadays many companies focus on their customers
 iskaa matlab yah he ki companiyon ki gatividhiyaan evam utpaada graahakon ki maang ke anusaar hote hai
 This is usually done in three ways: a customer driven approach, an understanding of market change and an approach to make the product innovative
 upabhokta sanchalit drushtikon ke tahat upabhokta kii maangen ranneetik vipanan faislon kaa nirdhaaran karti hai
 No strategy is adopted until it is successful in consumer research testing
 Every aspect of a product, including the nature of the product, is governed by the needs of the future consumer
 aarambhik bindu sadaiv upabhokta hi hota he
 The logical aspect behind this is that research and development funds should not be spent in preparing a product that people do not want to buy
 History is witness that many products did not run in the market despite being unique examples of technology
 is graahak kendrit vipanan ke aupchaarik drushtikon ko SIVA ke taur par janaa jaataa he 
multah is pranali main graahak par focus karne ke liye chaar p ko nae naam or nae shabd die gaye hai
 The SIVA model offers a demand / customer centric version, an alternative to the well-known 4ps supply model of marketing management
 SIVA model ke chaar tatv hai: The model was proposed by Chekitan Dev and Don Schultz in the Marketing Management Journal of the American Marketing Association and presented in the Market Leader - The Journal of the Marketing Society in the UK
 yah model pramukh taur par graahak par focus karata he In the innovation approach, the company follows product innovation, then develops a market for that product
 utpaada navachaar prakriya ko sanchalit karata he or vipanan anusandhan yah tay karne ke liye kiya jaataa he kii us nae utpaada hetu laabhadaayak bazaar khand maujuud he
 The reasoning is that perhaps customers do not know what options will be available to them in future, then we should not expect them to tell us what they will buy in future
 However, marketers can aggressively adopt and take advantage of product innovation
 utpaada navachaar drushtikon kaa paalan karte vakt vipanak ko yah tay kar lenaa chahie kii unke paas vibhinn evam vividh utpaada navachaar drushtikon hon

 bair namakan taron ko naam dene kaa ek tareeqa he jisamen kisi bhi taramandal main sthit taare ko ek unani akshar1 or uske taramandal ke unani naam se bulaayaa jaataa he
 In Bayer names, the Greek form of the constellation is used as a relation 2
 misaal ke liye, parnin ashv taramandal ke taron main se teen taron ke naam is prakaar hai - α pagasaaye, β pagasaaye or γ pagasaaye 
 In 1603, the German astronomer Yohan Baer began Bayer nomination
 unhone apni taraf se puri koshish kii ki taron kaa namakan unki prakaash kii shakti ke mutabik hi ho, lekin us jamaane main prakaash ko maap paanaa bahut kathin tha or bahut se taramandal hai jinamein alfaa namankit kiya gaya tara us taramandal kaa sab se roshan tara nahin hota
 The Greek alphabet has only twenty-four letters, while many constellations have more than fifty stars
 aise main unani ke aakhri akshar ke baad angrezi varnmaala ke chote akshar istemaal hote hai
 In this method, the fifty-first star will be named "z"
 agar pachaas se bhi zyaada taare hon to phir ikyavanave taare se angrezi ke bade aksharon kaa prayog shuru ho jaataa he
 In this way, entire 76 stars can be named
 jab kisi material ko 0°k tak thanda kiya jaataa he to uskaa pratirodh purnatah shunya pratirohakata pradarshit karte hai
 This property of them is called superconductivity
 shunya pratirohakata ke alaava atichaalakata kii dasha main padaarth ke bheetar chumbakeey kshetra bhi shunya ho jaataa he jise mesanar prabhaav ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is well known that the resistivity of metallic drivers decreases with their heat loss
 kintu saamaanya chaalkon jaise tanba or chaandi aadi main, ashuddhiyon or duusare apurnataaon ke kaaran ek seemaa ke baad pratirohakata main kami nahin hoti
 Even copper exhibits nonzero resistivity at absolute zero temperatures
 iske vipareet, atichaalak padaarth kaa taap krantik taap se neeche le jane par, isaki pratirohakata teji se shunya ho jaati he
 The electric current of a closed circuit made of superconducting wire can remain constant without any power source
 atichaalakata ek pramaatra-yantric drugvishay he
 Superconducting materials also exhibit the effect of magnetic reflection
 in sabakaa taap-vaidyut-bal shunya hota he or tamson-gunank baraabar hota he
 Their specific heat also changes abruptly upon transition heat
 yah vishesh ullekhneey he ki jin parmaanuon main bahya electronon kii sankhya 5 athwa 7 he unamem sankraman taap ucchtam hota he or atichaalakata kaa gun bhi utkrisht hota he
 1) Superconducting wires are used to make magnets with very high magnetic field intensity
 inhen atichaalak chumbak kehete hai
 They are used in particle accelerators
 2) bhavishya main inkaa upyog chote evam adhik kaarydaksh transafarmar, motor, vidyut janitr, aadi banane main kiya ja saktaa he
 3) Superconductors squid can be used for storing energy because once the current is set up in a superconducting loop and left it will continue to run for eternity
 5) iskaa upyog magnetic lavitesan main kiya ja sakegaa
 6) In addition to this, superconductivity is also being used in superconducting transmission lines, electromagnets, radio-frequency cavities, superconducting transistors, superconducting electron-beam lenses, superconducting bearings, bolometers, etc
 jab koi dhaatu kisi upyukt aakaar main, jaise belan athwa taar ke rup main lee jaati he, tab vah vidyut ke pravaah main kuch na kuch pratirodh avashya utpann karti he
 But first in 1911, the Kemerling Ones made a sensational discovery that if the mercury was cooled to below 4 degrees, its electrical resistance would suddenly collapse and become a good conductor
 lagbhag 20 dhaatuon main, jinamein ronga, paara, sisa ityadi pramukh hai, yah gun paaya jaataa he
 The temperature under which this condition is attained is called transition heat and the conductivity of this condition is superconductivity
 sankraman taap na keval bhinn-bhinn dhaatuon ke liye pruthak-pruthak hote hai, apitu ek hi dhaatu ke vibhinn samasthanikon ke liye bhi vibhinn hote hai
 Superconductivity properties are also found in many alloys such as palladium antimony
 parmaanu main electron andakaar path main parikrama karte hai or is drushti se ve chumbak jaisaa kaary karte hai
 The torque of these magnets is reduced by the external magnetic field
 duusare shabdon main, parmaanu visham chumbakeey prabhaav dikhaate hai
 If a material is placed in a suitable magnetic field, then the internal magnetic field of that conductor is destroyed, that is, it starts acting like a heterogeneous magnetic substance
 talaprishth par bahane vaali vidyut dhaaraon ke kaaran aantarik kshetra kaa maan shunya hi rahata he
 This is called the effect of mysnar
 yadi atichaalak padaarth ko dhire-dhire badhane vaale chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae to kshetra ke ek vishesh maan par, jise dehali maan kehete hai, iskaa pratirodh punah apane purv maan ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 Several suggestions have been made to explain the theory of superconductivity

 For example, in ancient India there is a planetarium named Mrigashirsha, which in Greek civilization is called Oraian, which means "hunter"
 pracheen bharat main taramandalon ko nakshatra kaha jaataa tha
 In modern-day astronomy, constellations are called groups of the same stars, which are internationally agreed with the International Astronomical Union
 aadhunik yug main kisi taron ke taramandal ke ird-gird ke kshetra ko bhi usee taramandal kaa naam de diya jaataa he
 Thus the entire celestial sphere has been divided into different constellations
 agar yah bataanaa ho ki koi khagoleey vastu ratri main akaash main kahan milegi to yah bataaya jaataa he ki vah kis taramandal main sthit he
 Keep in mind that stars and other objects appearing in a planetarium may appear close to each other when viewed from the earth, but this is not necessarily the case
 jis tarah dur dekhne par do pahaad ek-duusare ke nazadik lag sakate hai lekin sameep jane par pataa chalata he ke unamem bahut faaslaa he or ek pahaad vastav main duusare pahaad se milon peeche he
 "planetarium" was called "nakshatra" in Sanskrit and in various Indian languages this word is used even today
 taramandal ko angrezi main "constlation" or arabi main "majamua-al-nazoom" kehete hai
 The constellation consists of stars and celestial objects, which, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, are permanently visible in the same area in the sky
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he kii ye vastav main ek-duusare ke paas hai yaa inkaa aapas main koi mahatvapurn gurutvkarshan bandhan he
 In contrast, the stars of the trilateral are actually in a cluster and have a gravitational bond between themselves
 kashmiri bhashaa ek bhartiya-arya bhashaa he jo mukhyatah kashmir ghati tathaa chenab ghati main boli jaati he
 According to the 2001 census, its number of speakers in India is around 56 lakhs
 paak-adhikrut kashmir main 1998 kii janaganana ke anusaar lagbhag 1 lakh kashmiri bhashaa bolne vaale hai
 In addition to Kashmir's Vittasta Valley, there are speakers of this language from north to Zojila and Barzal and beyond Banhal in the south to the small sub-region of Kishtwar
 kashmiri, jammu praant ke banhaal, ramban tathaa bhadravaah main bhi boli jaati he
 The principal dialect is "kashtwadi" of Kishtwar
 kashmir kii bhashaa kashmiri he ye kashmir main vartmaan samay main boli jane vaali bhashaa he
 Various scripts have been used for the Kashmiri language, with the main scripts being Sharda, Devanagari, Roman and parasho-arabic
 kashmir vaadi ke uttar or pashchim main boli jane vaali bhashaaen - dardadi, srinya, kohwaad kashmiri bhashaa ke ulat thim
 This language is similar to indo-aryan and hindustani-iranian languages
 bhashavidon kaa maananaa he ki kashmir ke pahaado main rahane vaale purv nagavasi jaise gandharva, yaksha or kinnar aadi ,bahut pehle hi mul aryan se alag ho gaye
 Similarly, it took a long time for Kashmiri language to become like Arya language
 naga bhashaa swatah hi viksit hui he is sab ke baavjood, kashmiri bhashaa ne apni vishisht swar style ko banaae rakhaa or 8 veen-9 veen shatabdi main anya aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon kii tarah, kai charnon se guzarana padaa
 The Sharda script was used to write the Kashmiri language, around the tenth century
 puranic kashmiri lipi ko keval sharada main likhaa gaya he
 The way of writing Sharda language is indigenous, which was developed from the original Brahmi
 vidwaanon, shaskaon or hindu, muslim, buddha aadi jaise sabhi dharmon ke log sharada lipi main likhte the
 Lalda, Rupa Bhavani, Nand Rishi and other devotional poems were written in the Sharda script itself and can still be read in the library
 is lipi kaa istemaal kashmiri pandit dwaara janm praaanpatr banane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 The Sharda script is currently confined to Hindus but to write the Kashmiri language, Muslims use Arabic letters
 kashmiri bhashaa main sharada ke alaava, devanagari lipi, roman or persian-arbik kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 The Kashmiri language also includes papers and magazines like Koshur News, Khasar Bhavani Times, Vibhuta, Miller etc
 ab kashmiri bhashaa kaa software bhi aa gaya he
 The Roman script has also been used for the Kashmiri language but it is not popular
 The Government of Jammu and Kashmir also considered the persian-arabic script, now known as the Kashmiri script, to be the official script
 vyapak rup se is bhashaa ko prakaashan main upyog kiya jaataa he
 Some people write Kashmiri in arabic-persian script, which is not very different from Urdu
 kashmiri main, a, aa, u, uu aadi jaise vyanjanon ke kai rup hote hai or vyanjanon main dantululiye c, ja, marathi kii tarah hote hai, lekin unhen saamaanya lekhan main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 The vernacular name of Kashmiri begins; But till the 17th century, the name "bhasha" or "deshbhasha" remained in force
 sambhavat: anya pradeshon main ise kashmiri bhashaa ke naam se hi suchit kiya jaataa rahaa
 Historically, the first instructions of this name follow Amir Khusro's nuh-script with Sindhi, Lahori, Tilangi and Mabri etc
 spashtat: yah disha vahi he jo punjabi, sindhi, gujarati, marathi, banglaa, hindi or urdu aadi bharatarya bhashaaon kii rahi he
 The arguments on which Grierson conceived Kashmiri to be "dard" need to be re-examined; Because even Kashmiri language kills are not solved
 ghosh mahapraan ke abhaav main jo daarad prabhaav dekha gaya he vah to sindhi, pashtu, punjabi, dogri ke atirikt purvi banglaa or rajasthani main bhi dikhaai padataa he; par kriyaapadon ke sanshleshan main karta ke atirikt karm ke purush, ling or vachan kaa jo sparsh paaya jaataa he usapar daarad bhashaayen koi prakaash nahin daalatin
 Perhaps the Kashmiri language is influenced by "dard", but not the origin
 15veen shatee tak kashmiri bhashaa keval sharada lipi main likhi jaati thi
 Later the Persian script became popular and now a customized form of this has become stable
 siraampur se bible kaa sarvapratham kashmiri anuwaad sharada lipi hi main chapa tha, doosraa farsi lipi main or kuch sanskaran roman main bhi nikle
 There have also been experiments to adopt Devanagari and nowadays it is being written in Devanagari also
