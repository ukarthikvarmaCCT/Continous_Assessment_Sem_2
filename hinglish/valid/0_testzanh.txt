 arthath vyakaran main sangya yaa sarvnaam shabd kii vah avasthaa jiske dwaara vaakya main uskaa kriya ke saath sambandh prakat hota he use kaarak kehete hai
 
 kaarak yah ingit karata he ki vaakya main sangya yaa sarvnaam kaa kaam kya he
 Factors can be seen in many forms - kuch bhashaaon main sangya or sarvnaam ke atirikt visheshan or kriyavisheshan main bhi vikaar aate hai
 Just like in Sanskrit - 'sheetlane Jalen' has an adjective 'sheetlane'
 vibhinn bhashaaon main karkon kii sankhya tathaa kaarak ke anusaar shabd kaa rup-parivartan bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Sanskrit and other ancient Bharatiya languages have eight factors
 german bhashaa main chaar kaarak hai
 Causative inflection - The nouns or pronouns followed by the words 'ne, ko, se, for', etc
 are the signs which are called causative 'inflection'
 hindi main aath kaarak hote hai

 Kartaprathama - 2
 karm dwitiya -- ko 3
 Karan - to, with, by 4
 sampradaan -- ke liye, ko 5
 Dedicated - from 6
 sambandh -- kaa, ke, kii, raa, re, ri 7
 Tribunal - In, on 8
 sambodhan -- he ! are ! o! This verse has been created to remember the causative sign- vishesh - karta se adhikaran tak vibhakti chihn shabdon ke ant main lagaae jate hai, kintu sambodhan kaarak ke chihn-he, re, aadi praayah shabd se purv lagaae jate hai
 The form in which the verb is understood by the person doing the action is called the 'doer' factor
 iskaa vibhakti-chihn ‘ne’ he
 This 'ne' sign is not used in the present and future
 iskaa sakarmak dhaatuon ke saath bhootkaal main prayog hota he
 Like- 1
 Ram killed Ravana
 2
ladki skool jaati he
 The subject of the verb in the first sentence is Rama
 isamen ‘ne’ karta kaarak kaa vibhakti-chihn he
 In this sentence, 'mara' is a past verb
 ‘ne’ kaa prayog praayah bhootkaal main hota he
 In the second sentence, the subject of the present tense is the girl
 isamen ‘ne’ vibhakti kaa prayog nahin hua he
 In the past, even with the subject of the intransitive verb, there is no synonym
 jaise-vah hansaa
 The verb is not used with the subject of the transitive verb of present and future
 jaise-vah fal khaataa he
 He will eat the fruit
 kabhi-kabhi karta ke saath ‘ko’ tathaa ‘sa’ kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 like- balak ko so janaa chahie
 The book was read from Sita
 rogi se chalaa bhi nahin jaataa
 The word was not written from him
 kriya ke kaary kaa fal jis par padataa he, vah karm kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection is 'ko'
 yah chihn bhi bahut-se sthanon par nahin lagata
 Like- 1
 Mohan killed the snake
 2
 ladki ne patr likhaa
 In the first sentence, the action of 'kill' has resulted in a snake
 atah saanp karm kaarak he
 The prefix 'ko' is attached to it
 duusare vaakya main ‘likhane’ kii kriya kaa fal patr par padaa
 Hence letter is the karm factor
 isamen karm kaarak kaa vibhakti chihn ‘ko’ nahin laga
 The form of the noun, etc
, with the help of the means of performing the verb, that is, with the help of which the work is done, it is called Karan Karkar
 iske vibhakti-chihn ‘se’ ke ‘dwaara’ he
 Like- 1
 Arjun killed Jayadratha with an arrow
 2
balak gend se khel rahe he
 In the first sentence, the doer Arjun did the act of killing with the arrow
 atah ‘baan se’ karan kaarak he
 In the second sentence, the subject is doing the task of playing the child 'with the ball'
 atah ‘gend se’ karan kaarak he
 Sampradaya means give
 arthath karta jiske liye kuch kaary karata he, athwa jise kuch detaa he use vyakt karne vaale rup ko sampradaan kaarak kehete hai
 The taker is called the denominator
 iske vibhakti chihn ‘ke liye’ ko hai
 1
 Greet the sun for health
 2
guruji ko fal do
 In these two sentences 'for health' and 'guruji ko' are sampradaya factors
 sangya ke jis rup se ek vastu kaa duusari se alag hona paaya jaae vah apadan kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection mark is 'from'
 jaise- 1
baccha chat se gir padaa
 2
 Sangita fell from the horse
 in donon vaakyon main ‘chat se’ or ghode ‘se’ girane main alag hona prakat hota he
 Hence there are aberrations from horse and roof
 shabd ke jis rup se kisi ek vastu kaa duusari vastu se sambandh prakat ho vah sambandh kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection symbol is 'ka', 'K', 'ki', 'ra', 're', 'ri'
 jaise- 1
yah radheshyaam kaa betaa he
 2
 It is Kamla's cow
 in donon vaakyon main ‘radheshyaam kaa bete’ se or ‘kamala kaa’ gaay se sambandh prakat ho rahaa he
 Hence the relation here is causative
 jahaan ek sangya yaa sarvnaam kaa sambandh duusari sangya yaa sarvnaam se suchit hota he, vahaan sambandh kaarak hota he
 Of its inflection mark, ki, k; Ra, Ri, Ray; Na, ne, ne
 jaise- Ram's boy, Shyam's girl, Geeta's children
 meraa ladkaa, meri ladki, hamaare bachche
 Apna boy, apna girl, apne boy
 shabd ke jis rup se kriya ke aadhaar kaa bodh hota he use adhikaran kaarak kehete hai
 Its diacritics are 'in', 'on'
 jaise- 1

 2
 TV in the room Is kept
 in donon vaakyon main ‘phulon par’ or ‘kamare main’ adhikaran kaarak he
 By which the feeling of calling or alerting someone is called an address factor and an address mark is put

he gopal ! yahan aao
 In these sentences 'hey Bhaiya' and 'hey Gopal'! Addressing factor

 The story is of a footprint village
 mahendra or kalyani apane abodh shishu ko lekar gaanv se dur janaa chaahate hai
 There are incidents of loot and robbery etc
 dakaiton ne kalyani ko pakad liya tha par vah jaan bachaati dur jangal main bhatak jaati he
 The soldiers grab Mahendra - where there is a scuffle and a monk named Bhawanand protects him
 bhavanand aatmaraksha main angrej sahab ko maar detaa he - lut kaa saamaan vyavastha main lagaataa he
 The second monk reaches Jeevanand there
 bhavanand or jeevanand donon sanyasi, pradhan satyanand ke shishy hai - jo ’aanandamath‘ main rahakar desh seva ke liye karm karte hai
 Mahendra wants to know Bhavanand's introduction, because if Bhavanand had not been found, he could have lost his life
 bhavanand ne jawaab diya- meraa parichay jaanakar kya karoge? mahendra ne kaha - main jaananaa chahta hoon, aaj aapane meraa bahut upkaar kiya he
 Mahendra does not understand that the Saints can also be like dacoits
 itane par bhi bhavanand mahendra kii patni or putree se milaane kaa bhi aashwaasan detaa he
 Bhavanand's currency had changed suddenly
 vah ab dheer sthir prakruti kaa sanyasi nahin lag rahaa tha
 a smile was floating on his face

 At first, Guru Sahib expressed reluctance
 parantu unke gursikhon evam raja jai singh ke baar-baar aagrah karne par wo dilli jane ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 After this, all social groups of Punjab came and gave Guru Sahib
 unhone guru sahib ko ambala ke nikat punjokhara gaanv tak choda
 At this place Guru Sahib ordered the people to return to their respective homes

 Apart from this, there are many statements in Sikh history about his intellectual ability

 Meanwhile, the outbreak of diseases like cholera and young mother brought an epidemic in Delhi

 Bypassing the caste and high altitude, Guru Sahib launched a campaign to serve all Indian people

 Aurangzeb could not even tease them in view of public sentiment and circumstances
 parantu saath hi saath aurangzeb ne ram raay ji ko shah bhi dekar rakhi, taaki saamaajik matbhed ujagar hon
 Guru Sahib himself also suffered from high fever while serving people suffering from epidemics day and night

 When his condition became more serious, he called his mother to him and said that his end is near

 The term was used only for the future Guru, Guru Teghbahadur Sahib, who was living in the village of Bakala on the banks of the Beas River in Punjab

 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit

 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 He also translated the works of writers of other languages whom he read and were influenced by
 'tollstoy kii kahaniyaan', galsvardi ke teen naatakon kaa 'hadtaal', 'chaandi kii dibiya' or 'nyaay' naam se anuwaad kiya
 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty

 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 prem chandra ko log aaj unki kaabiliyat kii vajah se yaad karte hai jo vivaadon ko bahut kam jagah detii he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature

 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman

 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature

 Three of them were almost complete, and with Utah in mind, they would make this fourth attempt in unprecedentedly large waves in France
 apane vishleshan ko pradarshan karne baad, utah ko khufia taur par france main paappas naamak field agent ke yahaan bheja jaataa he
 The two arrive at France and Utah, with the help of others, sets off on a long tunnel wave
 jyon hi vah pahunchataa, vahiin pehle se ek anya surfar laharon tak pahunch jaataa he, jise utah ke saath us asthir laharon par chhod detaa he
 Yutah gets trapped in those waves and faints, but the same surfer returns and saves Yutah
 jaagane par vah khud ko us surfar, bodhi, or uski team ke logon main raach, chowder or gromet se miltaa he
 They leave him to enjoy the party and then meet Samasara, an already familiar girl

 vah yah bhi bataati he he ozaki ne teesri chunauti ko puraa kar aage bhi jari rakhaa, jaisaa kii baaki vishwaas karte he ki wo nahin batch paaen
 Actually his death was not due to attempts to complete the challenge, but a large ship took his life for which he had climbed on the back of the whale to save the whale from their kill
 unki naav par maujuud, us kishor, bodhi, ne kabhi sachai bataane kaa nishchay kiya lekin ozaki ne jo aarambh kiya tha use anjaam dene kaa bhi pran thaan liya tha

 satraa maheenon baad, utah use prashanth mahaasaagar main duusari tuphaani laharon kaa saamana karte dundh letaa he
 Yutah tries to get Bodhi back as a punishment for the crimes he has committed so far, but he realizes Bodhi will not accept without surfing, both of whom know that there is no scope for him to return

 The mutual broadcasting system, which Westwood One acquired two years ago, followed suit and essentially merged with NBC Radio

 In 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice president at RCA, and a desperate NBC tried to lure Fred Silverman from number-one ABC to reverse the network's fortunes
 Apart from notable exceptions of Different Strokes, Real People, The Facts of Life and the short series Shogan, he too could not get any hits
 Failures quickly gathered in his bag
 Ironically, many of them lagged behind the ratings that Silverman started on CBS and ABC
