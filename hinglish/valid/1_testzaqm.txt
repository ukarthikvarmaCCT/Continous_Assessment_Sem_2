 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko "gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa maan hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutveey sthiraank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Suppose the code of the Earth is m and there is a body with the code m on its surface
 prithvi kii sanhati yadi uske centre par hi sanghanit maani jaae or prithvi kaa ardhavyas r ho to prithvi dwaara us pind par kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal : According to Newton's Second Movement, the force exerted on a body is equal to the product of the body and acceleration of that body
 at: prithvi ke aakarshan ke prabhaav main mukt rup se giranevaale pind par kaary karanevaala gurutvkarshan bal: Where g is the gravitational acceleration of that body, so arthath g= pind kii ikai sanhati par kaary karanevaala bal
 But from the equation atev gurutvajanit twaran g ko bahudhaa ‘prithvi’ ke gurutvkarshan kii tivrata bhi kehete hai
 The problem of finding the value of gravitation constant g attracted the attention of scientists only after Newton's law of gravity was presented
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yah prakruti ke mul niyatanko main se ek he or desh, kaal tathaa paristhiti se sarvatha nirpeksh he
 Therefore, it is called universal constant
 saath hi, yah prithvi kii sanhati se bhi sambandhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 Therefore, to know the density and density of the earth, it also requires knowledge of its value

 Therefore, before finding the density of the earth, it was only natural to attract the attention of scientists towards methods to determine the exact value of G

 If the Earth's Code m and radius r, then the gravitational force acting on that body w = g m m / r2 xxrep 12 
 Now if any other heavy body of m code is placed under this body and the distance between the centers of both bodies is d, then due to mutual attraction of both, the first body will bend more down, that is, its weight will increase

 naatakon ke sambandh main shastreey jaankaree ko natya shaastra kehete hai
 The oldest book of this information is also known as Natyashastra, the author of which was Bharata Muni
 bharat muni kaa jeevankaal 400 isapurv se 100 i ke madhya kisi samay mana jaataa he
 Bharatamuni's Natya Shastra is still highly respected as a complete book of music, drama and acting
 unka maananaa he ki natya shaastra main keval natya rachana ke niyamon kaa akalan nahin hota balki abhinayta rangamanch or prekshak in teenon tatwon kii purti ke sadhano kaa vivechan hota he
 In 37 chapters, Bharatamuni explores all the facts related to theater actor, acting, dance, lyricism, audience, dasarupaka and rasa nishpati
 bharat ke natya shaastra ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki naatak kii safalataa keval lekhak kii pratibha par aadhaarit nahin hoti balki vibhinn kalaon or kalakaaron ke samyak ke sahyog se hi hoti he
 These are the two distinctions of Natya and Nritta, visual poetry
 nat-nati dwaara kisi avasthavishesh kii anukriti natya he - 'natyate abhinayatven roopyate- iti natyam'
 Anukarita is called Nritta, associated with rhythm and rhythm
 ye donon hi abhinay ke vishay hai or lalit kala ke antargat maane jate hai
 The major parts of the play are four - Vachik, Satvik, Aangik and Dietary
 ukti-pratyukti kii yathavat anukriti vaachik abhinay kaa vishay he
 Uninterrupted display of emotions is a sattvic act
 bhavapradarshan ke liye haath, pair, netra, bhru, evam kati, mukh, mastak aadi angon kii vividh cheshtaaon kii anukriti angik abhinay he
 Costumes, chadhaal, living conditions and dialect of food are the subject of acting in accordance with the country
 chaturvidh abhinay ke sahaayak nrity, geet, vaadya evam gati, vritti, pravriti or asana kaa anusandhan bhi natya ke antargat he
 In this way, by presenting the description of the form and usage of various organs and functions of acting, the scripture which determines the rules and practice related to it is 'natyashastra'
 abhinay ke anuroop sthaan ko natyagrih kehete hai jiske prakaar, nirmaan evam saajasja ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan bhi naatyashaastra kaa hi vishay he
 The description of behavior and interactions of actors and actresses of a diverse range of actors and actresses, and the duties of a director is also included in the wider scope of Natyashastra
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy aihik jivan kii naanaa vednaaon se parishrant janata kaa manoranjan he - yah dev, daanav evam maanav samaaj ke liye aamod pramod kaa saral saadhan he
 It is a captivating research that appeals to the observer class by satisfying the nines and scouring the spirit - it is a chant, 'chakshuskratu', in general affording people of differing interest, irrespective of caste and caste, age, discrimination etc
 iske pravartak swayan prajapati hai jinhone rugveda se paathya, samaveda se geet, yajurveda se abhinay tathaa atharvangiras se ras kaa parigrah kar sarvavarnik pancham veda kaa pradurbhaav kiya
 uma-mahadev has obliged it by supporting Lasya and Tandava for Suprit Ho Lokanuranjan
 vastut: aisa koi shaastra, koi shilp, na koi vidya or na koi kala aisi he jiskaa pratinidhitiv naatyashaastra main na ho
 In this way, the presiding deity of the Natyasastra, who is inspired by the divine divinity, is also conceived, like the preceptors of the other Vedas and Vedangs, whose form is mentioned in the text named 'nrisinaprasad'
 natya sambandhi niyamon kii samhita kaa naam 'naatyashaastra' he
 According to the Indian tradition, the original creator of Natyashastra is considered to be Prajapati himself and has been given special respect for Natyakala by calling it 'natyaveda'
 jis prakaar param purush ke nirishwaas se aavirbhoot vedarashi ke drashtaa vividh rishi prakalpit hai usee tarah mahadev dwaara prokt natyaved ke drashtaa shilaali, krishashv or bharatmuni maane gaye hai
 The Natya Samhita, compiled by Shilali and Krishashva, is not available today, only the treatise published by Bharata Muni is known as 'natyashastra'
 iskaa pranayan sambhawatah kashmir desh main hua
 The Natyashastra can be stabilized around the second century BCE, depending on the composition, construction style and exclusion
 is granth main pratybhigna darshan kii chhap he
 There are 36 chapters in Natyashastra as a symbol of the 36 basic elements accepted in Pratibhagya philosophy

 The sixth and seventh chapters are lectures of rasas and bhavas, which are the foundation of the prevailing philosophy in Indian poetry

 In the next four chapters, the form and format of the verses and figures are explained
 natya ke bhed tathaa kalevar kaa sangopang vivaran 18wein or 19wein adhyay main dekar 20wein vritti vivechan kiya he
 Thereafter, in the 29th chapter, various types of dramas are featured
 29 se 34 adhyay tak geet vaadya kaa vivaran dekar 35wein adhyay main bhoomivikalp kii vyakhya kii he
 The last chapter is sub-committal

 Another 37th chapter is also available in the manuscripts, whose inclusion has been decided by the editor in the Sagar edition
 iske atirikt mul maatr granth kaa prakaashan chaukhamba sanskrit siries, varanasi se bhi hua he jiskaa paath nirnyasagari paath se bhinn he
 The version of the Natyashastra including Abhinav Bharati Tika is published from Baroda under the Gaekwad series
 vastut: yah granth natyasanvidhan tathaa rassidhant kii moulik samhita he
 Its belief is so high that its sentences are called 'bharatasutra'
 sadiyon se ise aarsh sammaan praapt he
 Originally there were 12,000 verses and some passages in this book, that is why it is called 'dwadashasahasri Samhita'
 parantu kalkrmanusaar iskaa sankshipt sanskaran prachlit ho chalaa jiskaa aayam chah hajaar padyon kaa rahaa or yah sankshipt samhita 'shatsahasri' kahalaai
 Bharatmuni is believed to be the pioneer of the Udaya Samhita and has been consulted by the ancient commentators with the titles of 'dwadash Sahasrikar' and 'satsahsrikar'
 jis tarah aaj uplabdh chanakya niti kaa aadhaar vruddh chanakya or smritiyon kaa aadhaar kramash: vruddh vasishtha, vruddh manu aadi mana jaataa he, usee tarah vruddhi bharat kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he
 This does not mean that Vasistha, Manu, Chanakya, Bharata etc
 became two people, but in this context 'vriddha' means perfect codifier

 mukuton kaa ekikaran yani Union of the Crowns scotland ke raja james 6 kaa 24 march 1603 i
 ko angreji singhaasana va ireland ke samrajya par avarohan va natijatan teenon deshon ke vaishvik kootneetiyon va sambandhon kaa ek samraat ke antargat ekikaran tha
 The crowns were unified after the death of Elizabeth I, the last Queen of England belonging to the Tudor royalty, who was James's unmarried and descended aunt
 james ke ekikrut vrihad britain banane ke athak prayaason ke baad bhi yah ekikaran vyaktigat yaa vanshanugat ekikaran hi rahaa kyonki scotland kaa singhaasana britain se alag hi rahaa
 However, it was ruled by James
 iske anusaar scotland or england alag desh bane rahe jabaki ireland ke saath un teenon deshon kaa shaasha ek hi rahaa
 After the passing of the Unification Law, 1707, at the time of the last Scott Queen Anne, Scotland became part of Great Britain, together with England and Wales
 iske baad se in teenon kshetron ko sammilit rup se great britain kaha jane laga
 The foundation of this unification was laid when King James 4 of the Scots married the elder sister of Henry 8, Margaret Tudor, under the Treaty of Everlasting Peace between England and Scotland
 kavi wiliam dunbar ne is sandhi kii mahatta kaa apni kavita da thricills and da rois main varnan kiya he
 The treaty was made as part of efforts to end centuries-old anglo-scottish disharmony
 is vivaah ne stuarton ko england ke tuder rajgaraane ke uttaradhikariyon ke saath rishton ke bandhan main baandh diya or british satta ke liye ek nayaa vanshabeej bo diya
 At that time it was very difficult and unnatural for a Scottish prince to inherit the power of England
 tamaam angrej samant va darbari is sandhi se khush nahin the va bhavishya main iske nateezon se phikrmand the
 They did not want any Scott to sit on the throne of England
 haalanki yah sandhi chirkaalin nahin rah saki or 1513 main hi england ke henry 8 ne ireland ke raja ke saath milakar france par akraman kar diya
 At this time, France announced the end of its old Treaty of Allied alliance with Scotland, which resulted in James invading the kingdoms of northern England with old partner France
 aane vaale varshon main scotland va england ke sambandh kharaab bane rahe
 The issue of inheritance, which did not seem to be valid until 1503 during the reign of Henry VIII, became worse with no legitimate Tudor descendants
 margaret tudor ke vanshajon ko england kii satta se bedakhal kar diya gaya tha
 This relationship deteriorated further when one of the Scots began to claim the throne of England
 elizabeth pratham ke shasankaal main scoton va angrejon ke bich sambandh behad kharaab rahe jab scoton kii rani mairi 1 ne elizabeth pratham ke uttaradhikaar ko chunauti di
 Since Elizabeth was not the child of Henry 8's first wife, many people did not consider him a legitimate ruler of England
 elizabeth ne apane khilaaf shadyantra rachane ke aaropon main mairi ko mrityudand de diya tha
 However, since Elizabeth was unmarried and childless, there was no other legitimate heir to the English throne in England and Scotland other than James 6, the son of Mary and descendant of Margaret Tudor
 parinamswaroop scotland kaa james 6 donon sihansano par kabiz hua or donon ke ekikaran kaa prastaav rakhte hue donon samrajyon ko ek hi rajvansh ke antargat le aayaa
 From then on, James is also called James i of England as well as James i of England
