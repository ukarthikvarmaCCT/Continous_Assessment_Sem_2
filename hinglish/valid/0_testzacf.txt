 The analogous condition that affects bowel movements is called parkopriceps
 kuch log kuch samay ke liye yaa kabhi kabhaar duusare logon kii upasthiti main mutr tyaag karne main kathinaayee anubhav karte hai
 In paruriasis, this condition goes beyond general hesitation, embarrassment, confusion or fear that people will know that someone is not able to urinate
 kuch log chalate vaahanon main peshaab nahin kar pate vahiin, kuch log ek shant shauchalay main apane girte hue mutr kii aawaaj se baichaiyn ho jate hai

 Madrasas are also maintained in many mosques which are given the responsibility of religious education
 masjidon musalamaanon kaa centre he jiskaa uddeshy keval dharmik nahin balki musalamaanon kaa saamaajik, shaikshanik or raajnneetik centre masjiden rahi hai
 Bazamat prayers play a very important role in the relationship, reconciliation and status tracking of Muslims
 is ke alaava masjidon yudhon or anya apatkaaleen sthitiyon main ek panaahagaah kaa kaam karti rahi hai
 It has not only been for Muslims but also for giving shelter to non-muslims, like the mosque Paris has been a refuge for Jews during World War II
 masjidon vah jagah hai jahaan se pehali vishvavidhyalayon ne janm liya jaise jamiya aalazehar, jamiya karviin, jamiya zayatonia aadi

 lekin samay ke saath musalamaanon sansaadhan padhate chale gaye or unhone apni jarurat or kshetra kii samskruti ke anusaar masjid nirmaan kii
 Expensive works in mosques and lofty towers and domes began to be built later
 minar ke kaaran yah tha ki masjid dur se dikhaai, is par chadhakar azaan di awaz dur tak aae or kshetra kii samskruti or kala kii jhalak thi
 From the dome the voice of the speech and prayer of the mosque speaker was spread throughout the mosque with an echo and beauty
 islam chunki jivit chizon kii tasviren protsaahit nahin isliye masjid kii tazain ke liye quran aayaat kaa vibhinn sundar tareeke se istemaal kiya gaya or vibhinn jaumitrek dizin bhi kiye gaye
 Due to the glimpses of time, necessity and culture, many things in the mosque became almost essential such as minarets, domes, a courtyard in the mosque, wuzu fountains, halls for namaz etc
 iske alaava aksar masjid ke hamaam, pustaken box, mb or kuch masjidon ke saath madrason, anusandhan kendra yaa niyamit vishvavidhyalayon shaamil hai
 The minaret is the main hallmark of the mosque which the mosque can be seen from a distance

 Not tall at the height of the mosque tower
 yah bahut chota bhi ho saktaa he or bahut ooncha bhi
 Small mosques in Europe do not have towers because they often have one or two rooms
 sabase lanbaa minar masjid hasan samiksha, kasabalanka, morocco kaa samajha jaataa he jo 210 meter ooncha he
 Initially the mosque did not have minarets and they were very simple but soon the minarets became almost part of the mosque

 However, at the end of 1943, he made some demands that he felt required compliance by the Allies for Germany to agree on immediate peace

 Tresco convinced him to go ahead even in the event of no success and said, "there must be an attempt to kill

 a guard knocked and opened the door and asked them to hurry as the meeting was about to begin
 As a result, Stauffenberg was able to produce only one bomb
 He dropped the second bomb with his camp colleague, Warner von Heften, and returned to the briefing room, where he placed the briefcase under the table, as close to Hitler as he could
 a few minutes later, he apologized and exited the room

 He writes on Evans, "in the problematic path of his argument, he weaves two nets: 1
 Stauffenberg's questioning of" moral motivation ", 2
 St as a role model
 Suitability of Fenberg
 " He further writes, "so if, with the initial impartiality that Evans writes, Stauffenberg had a strong moral motivation - whether it emerged from his aristocracy, from Catholic doctrine or from romantic poetry - then it also reduced his National Socialism Taxes that Stauffenberg incorrectly defined as 'spiritual renewal'

 The difference between Leonardo and other European Renaissance artists is that Vinci did not spend time primarily copying artifacts of ancient times
 ve swabhaavat: prakruti ke anany adhyeta the
 In his paintings of life, along with the subtle reality of expressive representations, such a combination of live motion and flow of lines is found as is not found in any earlier painter

 There is a similar view in relation to some other idols, but certainly nothing can be said

 Falundica is a part of the human's throat
 yah ek prakaar kaa utak hai jo bahari rogaanuon se akraman ke viruddh pehali raksha-pankti kii tarah kaam karata he
 The throat is an important part of our body
 iskaa mahatv isi baat se spasht he ki sharir ke bheetar pahunchane vaale khaadya−padaarth tathaa hawa−pani ke pravesh kaa daayitv isi par he
 Due to performing this important work, this part is first affected by any poisonous elements present in food, water and air
 naak or kaan bhi isse achoote nahin rahete
 Although looking outward, our nose, throat and ears are seen separately, but inside the throat, the cells of these three organs merge together
 is kaaran in teenon angon main se kisi ek bhi ang main kisi prakaar kaa sankraman ho jaataa he to uskaa prabhaav teenon angon par padataa he
 For this reason, it is important that any infection is treated quickly
 bahari vaataavaran main upasthit kisi bhi jahrile tatv ke sankraman se in angon ko bachaane ke liye prakruti ne mukh tathaa gale kii sanrachana is prakaar kii he ki un jahrile tatwon ko hamaare munh ke andruni tantra par koi prabhaav na pade
 Nose and mouth appear only as a whole organ when seen in external form, their separate parts are not visible
 parantu vastav main yah ang kai hisson main bante hote hai
 Although the nitcalcavity marantz and natalchapter appear to be different in sight, but in the back they are joined together in a cavity called 'oroferringles'
 oropherigles ke upar naak ke peeche ke bhaag ko 'lejopheringles' kehete hai
 The cause of tonsil problem can be any type of infection or infection which is entering our body through the mouth and nose
 ye pradooshan yaa infections viral yaa bacterial kisi bhi prakaar ke pradooshak se dooshit hawa saans ke madhyam se jab sharir main pravesh kar jaati he to yah turant samasya paidaa kar sakati he
 In places where the atmosphere contains stink, dampness and any other chemical element, in such places due to continuous exposure to toxic elements by air, the problem of tonsil disease can arise
 bacchon main is rog ke zyada maamle drushtigat hote hai kyonki unki rog pratirohak kshamta kam hoti he
 It is not that this problem can be seen in older people who cannot suffer from it
 tonsillitis is rog kii ek khatarnaak avasthaa hoti he kyonki sharir main antibadis hone ke kaaran pratikriya hoti rahati he
 In this state, as soon as the antigen enters our body, the tonsil tissue starts to fight it
 The antigen produced by it reacts with the proteins present in other parts of the body and makes similar antibodies there
 in antibadis kaa dil ke volve par sidhaa prabhaav padataa he tathaa dil ke volve kharaab hone kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa he
 Tonsil happens mostly to children, but its side effects can occur at any age
 bachapan main gale ke sankraman kaa uchit upachaar na hona bhi hamaare desh main dil kii bimariyon kaa ek kaaran he
 In addition, tonsils can also cause diseases such as barrafangil's apishish, neutrafringel's apache
 sharir kii yantric sanrachana main vifaille tatwon ko gadabadi ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali is samasya kii pahchaan kuch praarambhik lakshan dekhakar kii ja sakati he jaise− baar-baar galaa kharaab hona, gale main sujan hona, dard hona, baar−baar bukhaar aana aadi
 If such symptoms are occurring again and again to the patient
 jaise ek varsh main paanch yaa chah baar to use tonsil kaa aaparishan karvaa lenaa chahie
 Laser operation takes two to three hours and does not rip at all
 tonsil se bachaav ke liye jaruri he ki bacchon ko santulit bhojan diya jaae taaki unke sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta majboot ho
 The most important thing is that immediately after seeing the symptoms of tonsils, contact the doctor immediately
 doctor dwaara die gaye dawaai ke course ko puraa karnaa chahie
 Often people stop the medicine as soon as they get a little rest, but doing so makes the disease more severe
 is rog ke dauraan rogi ko khaanaa−pani nigalane main takalif hoti he
 So many people eat less, it is not right
 rogi ke sharir kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti naram yaa taral khaadya padaarth dekar kii jari chahie
 By this, the body's immunity remains
 kalibanga rajasthan ke hanumangarh jile kaa ek pracheen evam aitihaasik sthal he
 Very interesting and important remains of Harappan civilization have been found here

 Kalibanga is located in hanumangarh district near pilibanga
 yah sthaan pracheen kaal kii nadi saraswati ke tat par sthit tha
 This river now forms the Ghaggar River
 satluj uttari rajasthan main samahit hoti thi
 The confluence of Saraswati and Drishdwati was in the nohar-bhadra region near Suratgarh
 swany sindhu nadi apni vishalata ke kaaran varsha ritu main samudr jaisaa rup dhaaran kar leti thi jo uske namakaran se spasht he
 In our country India, "indus civilization" originally originated in the development and spread of "saptasindhav" region and the Saraswati uptika has a special contribution in it
 saraswati upatyaka saraswati evam drushadwati ke madhya sthit "brahmavart" kaa pavitra pradesh tha jo manu ke anusaar "devnirmit" tha
 Vedic hymns were also spoken in this region full of wealth
 saraswati nadiyon main uttam thi tathaa giri se samudr main pravesh karti thi
 It is said in the veda - "ekachatat Saraswati river name Shuchiyratou
 girabhy: asamudraat
 
 " satluj uttari rajasthan main saraswati main samahit hoti thi
 CF Olden said on the basis of historical and geographical facts that the river Saraswati flowing in the veda on the ghat of the Ghaggar river was 'drishdwati'
 tab satluj va yamuna nadiyaan apane vartmaan paaton main pravaahit na hokar ghagghar va hakaraa ke paaton main bahati thim
 By the time of the Mahabharata, Saraswati had disappeared and by the 13th century the Sutlej had merged into Vyasa
 pani kii maatra kam hone se saraswati retile bhaag main suukh gai thi
 According to Olden sir, many small and big rivers originate between Sutlej and Yamuna
 inamen chautang, maarkanda, saraswati aadi thi
 These rivers still flow in the rainy season
 rajasthan ke nikat ye nadiyaan nikal kar ek badi nadi ghagghar kaa rup le leti hai
 Later, this river is known in Pakistan by the names Hakra, Wahid, Nara
 ye nadiyaan aaj sukhi hui hai - kintu inkaa maarg rajasthan se lekar karanchi or purv kuccha kii khadi tak dekha ja saktaa he
 According to Wakankar Mahasaya, there were more than 200 towns settled on the banks of river Saraswati, which are Harappan
 is kaaran ise 'sindhughati kii sabhyataa' ke sthaan par 'saraswati nadi kii sabhyataa' kahana chahie
 Originally, ghaggar-hakra was the ancient Saraswati river which flowed through the combined Gujarat of Sutlej and Yamuna, whose river was 8 km above the Brahmaputra river
 vakankar ke anusaar saraswati nadi 2 lakh 50 hajaar varsh purv nagaur, lunasar, osiyaan, deedwanaa hote hue luni se milti thi jahaan se vah purv main kuccha kaa ran main nanooran jal sarovar hokar lothal ke nikat sambhaat kii kadhi main girti thi, kintu 40,000 varsh purv pehle bhuuchaal aayaa jiske kaaran saraswati nadi maarg parivartan kar ghagghar nadi ke maarg se hote hue hanumangarh or suratgarh ke bahawalpur kshetra main sindhu nadi ke samaanaantar bahati hui kuccha ke maidan main samudr se mil jaati thi
 In the Mahabharata period, the kaurava-pandava war was fought on this bank
 isi kaal main saraswati ke vilupt hone par yamuna ganga main milane lagi
 The relics of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization were found in 1922 AD by Mu'an, who originated from the Daro and Harappa, under the leadership of Rakhaldas Banaji and Dayaram Sahni, which revealed the ancient civilization of 4500 years ago
 baad main is sabhyataa ke lagbhag 100 kendron kaa pataa chalaa jinamein rajasthan kaa kalibanga kshetra atyant mahatvapurn he
 Kalibanga has proved to be the third major city of the Harappan culture after Mu'an, Daro and Harappa
 jiske ek tile ke utkhanan dwaara nimnaankit avshesh strot ke rup main mili hai jinaki visheshtaayen bhartiya sabhyataa ke vikaas main unka yogadan spasht karti hai - Among the remains unearthed in Kalibanga are copper-made tools, weapons and sculptures, which reveal that humans had entered the copper age since the stone age

 Unlike other centers of the Indus Valley Civilization, the remains of a huge fort have also been found in Kalibanga, which is a proof of the protective measures adopted by humans here
 uparyukt avasheshon ke sroton ke rup main kalibanga va sindhu-ghati sabhyataa main apana vishisht sthaan he
 Some archaeologists believe that the Kalibanga civilization is more apt to be called 'saraswati Valley Civilization' as it is situated on the Saraswati coast, because the human here was more advanced than the Harappan civilization in prehistoric times
 kheti karne kaa gyaan hona, durg bana kar suraksha karnaa, yajna karnaa aadi isi unnat dasha ke suchak hai
 In fact, Kalibanga has made considerable contribution in the development of prehistoric civilization and culture
