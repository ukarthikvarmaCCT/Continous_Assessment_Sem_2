 Some foreign words, such as "shaving", "hospital", "lace", "oyster", "doggar", etc
 have also been introduced through the Khadi dialect

 The character was created by writer Otto Binder, and the artist Al Plastino designed it
 kaara sarvapratham ection comics # 252 main prakashit "da supergirl from kryptone" naamak ek kahani main dikhaai di thi
 After Kara's death in 1985, several different characters adopted the name Supergirl, including Matrix, Linda Danvers, and sir-el, etc
 comic book main upasthiti ke apane shuruaati dinon ke baad se yah charitra anemeshan, film, televijan or vyapaar sambandhi anya madhyamon main pradarshit hoti rahi he
 In May 2011, Supergirl placed 94th on its list of Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time by IGN
 iske baad november 2013 main bhi isien ne is charitra ko disi comics ke sheersh 25 nayakon kii suchi main 17wein sthaan par rakhaa
 Superman is the cousin of Superman in the original Supergirl relationship
 pehle kuch varshon tak to use superman kii comic kathaon main ek sahaayak charitra ke rup main darshaya gaya, or phir 1969 main disi kii adventure comics shrunkhlaa main use pehali baar mukhya charitra ke rup main pradarshit kiya gaya
 In 1972, the first comic series called Supergirl was released, which remained in publication until 1974
 iske baad 1982 main da dering new adventures of supergirl naamak ek masik comic shrunkhlaa bhi jari kii gayi, lekin 1984 main uskaa prakaashan bhi band kar diya gaya
 Kara died in 1985 in the series Crisis on Infinite Earths
 chrysis katha shrunkhlaa ke baad sabhi disi paatro ko riboot kiya gaya
 In this reboot, the story of Supergirl's origins was also completely changed
 naa to vah ab superman kii bahan thi, or naa hi kryptone vaasi
 This new character was named Matrix
 matrix ek kritrim jeev thi, jise lekes luther dwaara pocket continam se bane protoplasm se nirmit kiya tha
 Matrix first appeared in Superman V2, # 16
 1996 main lekhak peter david dwaara rachit supergirl naamak comic shrunkhlaa kaa prakaashan shuru hua
 At the beginning of the series, Matrix merged with his body in an attempt to save a woman named Linda Danvers
 manushya sharir praapt karne ke baad kuch varshon tak matrix ne saarvajanik jivan main linda danvars naam se rahanaa shuru kiya
 In Supergirl # 50, Matrix and Linda's bodies split
 haalaanki itane dinon tak matrix ke saath rahane ke kaaran linda ne bhi shaktiyaan praapt kii, or phir usne bhi kuch samay tak supergirl naam apanaaya
 The events in the 2005 series Infinite Crisis were erased from history
 supergirl # 75 main bhavishya main aayi kaara jor-el kii mulaakaat linda se hui, or phir kaara ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar linda uske samay main itihaas main chali gayi
 At the same time, he married Superman, and they both had a daughter
 haalaanki agyaat kaarnon se kuch varshon baad linda superman ko bina kuch bataaye kahin gaayab ho gayi
 Linda appeared again in a 2008 short series Rain in Hell, showing that Linda is now in Hell
 superman or linda kii putree, eriela kent ne bhi bhavishya main supergirl naam apanaaya
 a new Supergirl named sir-el appeared in the 2003 comic series Superman: The 10 Cent Adventure # 1, which, according to him, was the future daughter of Superman and Lois Lane
 maanav rup main vah mia naam se saarvajanik jivan jiti thi
 Later books reveal that she was not a Kryptonian, but a human, who derived her powers from the villain Brennić
 brinye ke saath hui ek ladaai main hi uski mrityu bhi ho gayi
 The timeline reorganized itself in Superman # 200, and this erased sir-el's existence forever
 sir-el kii mrityu ke baad disi comics continuity ke antargat "da supergirl from krypton" naamak superman / bitman comic book shrinkhalaa ke ank # 8 main kaara jor-el kaa ek aadhunik sanskaran pun: prastut kiya gaya, jisane kai anya disi comics prakashnon main sahaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 a comic book series called Supergirl based on the modern Kara zor-el is currently in publication
 saanchaa:supergirl Nyaya Darshan is one of the six Vedic philosophies of India
 iske pravartak rishi akshapaad gautam hai jinka nyayasutra is darshan kaa sabase pracheen evam prasiddh granth he
 The means by which we get the knowledge of the known elements, the same means are called 'justice'
 devraj ne 'nyaay' ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha he- In other words, with the help of which a theory can be reached, it is called justice
 pramaanon ke aadhaar par kisi nirnay par pahunchnaa hi nyaay he
 It is mainly logic and metaphysics
 ise tarkshastra, pramanshastra, hetuvidya, vadavidya tathaa anvikshiki bhi kaha jaataa he
 Vatsyayan has done the test of proof of justice
 ) is drushti se jab koi manushya kisi vishay main koi siddhanth sthir karata he to vahaan nyaay kii sahaayta apekshit hoti he
 Therefore, justice-philosophy is the fundamental need and origin of a thoughtful human society
 uske bina na manushya apane vichaaron evam siddhanton ko parishkrut evam susthir kar saktaa he na pratipakshi ke saiddhanthik aghaton se apane siddhanth kii raksha hi kar saktaa he
 Jurisprudence is the gateway to the Sanskrit literature of the highest order
 uske praarambhik parigyaan ke bina kisi unche sanskrit sahitya ko samaj paanaa kathin he, chaahe vah vyakaran, kavy, alankaar, ayurveda, dharmagranth ho yaa darshanagranth
 In philosophy, it is impossible to walk even a step without it
 nyaayashastra vastutah buddhi ko suprishkrut, teevr or vishad banane vaala shaastra he
 But as important and useful as jurisprudence is, it is also very difficult, especially as Navyanya is made up of collecting mischief
 vaisheshik darshan kii hi bhaanti nyaayadarshan main bhi padaarthon ke tatv gyaan se nickshreys kii siddhi bataayi gayi he
 There are 16 substances considered in the judiciary- gautam ke ‘nyayasutra’ se hi nyaayashastra kaa itihaas spasht rup se prarambh hota he
 Discussion of certain principles of this jurisprudence in ancient texts is still widely available today; But no one has the right knowledge of what was the proper and holistic form of that ancient logic
 ‘buddha darshan’ ke prakarnon main yah ullekh miltaa he ki buddha mat vaale apane mat kaa pratipaadan aastik siddhanton ke viruddh kiya karte the
 To prohibit this, the structure of the judiciary was formed
 buddha kaa samay chhathi shatabdi isa purv mana jaataa he
 This was the time when Gautama composed jurisprudence
 nyaayadarshan kaa ek naam tarkshastra bhi he
 In some places in the ancient scriptures, Gautama and in some places, Akshapad has been called the author of the judiciary
 acharya vishweshwar kii tarkbhasha kii bhoomika ke antargat prishth 11-20 main iskaa ullekh he
 The 'indian Philosophy' by Umesh Mishra states that logic was even before Buddhists and was very broad
 iske bhinn-bhinn pracheen naam hai
 Such as - Astrology, Hetology, Hetology, Logic, Logistics, Rhetoric, Evidence, Vakovakya, Takki, Vimansi etc
 nyayasutra kii sanrachana kab hui, iskaa nirnay kar paanaa bahut kathin he
 The reason is that the scholars wrote BC Have presented their beliefs between the sixth century to the fifth century BCE; But everyone has their own arguments
 usase kisi nishchit nirnay par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 Overall views of jurisprudence can be divided into two streams - the theorem and thesis
 gautam se gangashopadhyaay ke purv tak ke vidwaanon kii rachanaaon ke vichaar prameyapradhan hai or gangashopadhyaay kii tatvachintamani tathaa usapar aadhaarit parvarti vidwaanon kii rachanaaon ke vichaar pramanpradhan hai
 The bibliography of the theorem is called 'ancient justice' and the bibliography with the proof of thought is called 'new justice'
 pracheen nyaay kii bhashaa saral or padaarthvivechan sthool he tathaa navy nyaay kii bhashaa jatil or padaarthvivechan sookshm he
 The literature available after the Nyasutra is considered to be the first place of Vatsyayanized 'nyayabhasya'
 nyaaybhashya par ‘nyaayavarthik’ naam kii ek tikaa ‘udyotkar’ ne likhi he, jisamen nyaayashastra ke pramayon ke sahi swaroop ko jaanane kii sarvaadhik upadeyata vidyaman he
 Their period is also around the fifth-sixth century of Christ
 udyotkar dwaara rachit ‘nyaayavarthik’ naamak tikaa prakashit hone ke pashchaat bhi nyaayashastra par baudhon kaa aghat band nahin hua, jiske kaaran khyatipraapt tikaakar vachaspati mishra ko nyaayavarthik ke upar bhi ek tikaa likhni padi, jo ‘nyaayavarthikataatparytika’ ke naam se prasiddh atyadhik mahatvapurn tikaa he
 Scholars consider the time of Vachaspati Mishra to be the ninth century CE
 inhone hi is nyaayashastra ko shuddh evam lipibaddh kiya
 Due to this purity, it is available today that there are 5 chapters and 10 chapters in the judiciary, 84 cases and 528 sutras, 196 posts and 8385 letters
 bhartiya darshan main pramaan use kehete hai jo satya gyaan karne main sahaayta kare, arthath vah saadhan yaa prakriya jisase kisi duusari baat kaa yatharth gyaan ho
 Evidence is the main subject of justice
 'prama' naam he yatharth gyaan kaa
 Whatever is the reason of real knowledge, that is, through which there is real knowledge, it is called proof
 nyaayadarshan main pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd - ye chaar pramaan maane gaye hai
 It refutes the evidence of historical, economic, possible and lack of it
 pratyaksh pramaan ke do bhed hai- bahya or abhyantar
 The olfactory, percussion, eye, eye, and srotra, these "senses" are external evidence, due to the senses being in the upper part of the body and the client of external matters, and the mind being with the soul inside the body and the inner substance of the soul and Being a customer of kindred qualities, it is called "internal direct evidence"
 pratyaksh shabd se indriya, tajjanya gyaan or unke vishay in teenon kaa bodh hota he
 These three types of realizations arise from the following derivatives respectively: indriya rup pratyaksh pramaan kii sankhya chha: hone se tajjanya gyaanon kii sankhya chha: hoti he or unhen idriyadvarak naamon se vyavahrut kiya jaataa he, jaise- ghranaj, rasana, chakshush, twaach, shravan or maanas in pratyaksh gyaanon main prayek ke do bhed hote hai- nirviklpak or saviklpak
 Nirvikalak - In this direct, there is a sense of the nature of the object, its subject matter, there is no value of relationship; Therefore, the subjectivity of this direct is characteristic of the particularity and compatibility and that unique subjectivity is the symptom of this direct
 yah atindriya hota he arthath iskaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 It is inferred in the form of "optional direct"
 saviklpak - yah pratyaksh vishishtagrahi hota he
 Its subjectivity is of three types by distinction of specialness-type, specialness and compatibility
 yah nirviklpak" se utpann hota he or man se iskaa pratyaksh vedan hota he
 Its direct is treated by the term "attrition"
 prayek janya saviklpak pratyaksh ke do bhed hote hai- loukik or alokik
 Cosmic - is the customer of the direct current and the nearest object
 uskaa janm vastu ke saath indriya ke loukik sannikarsh se hota he; ve sannikarsh chha: hai - sanyog, sanyukt samavaay, sanyuktasmawet samavaay, samavaay, samavet samavaay or visheshantaa
 These include the combination of matter by combination, the properties of matter by joint, the property of karma and general, the property of combination and common with group, the word for group, the word with group, and the general of word with specialness
 alokik - alokik pratyaksh duurastha or avidhyman padaarth ko bhi grahan karata he
 He is born with a supernatural dilemma of the senses with the subject
 alokik sannikarsh teen hai- saamanyalakshan, gyanalakshan or yogaj
 Common symptoms - Known general or general knowledge is called general symptoms
 isse samipsth, duurastha, vidyaman or avidhyman sabhi prakaar ke samast samanyashrayon kaa pratyaksh hota he
 This direct occurs in the same condition when the contents of the cosmic direct of an ordinary shelter are embodied
 isi sannikarsh kii mahima se kisi ek maatr dhooma main kisi ek maatr vahri ke saahchary gyaan se hi sab dhoomon main sab vahri kii vyapti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he tathaa sannikrusht dhooma main vahri kii vyapti kaa nishchay rahete hue bhi asannikrusht dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kaa andeh hota he
 Gyanalakshan - Knowledge of Tattad subject is called "gyanalakshana" of the senses along with Tattad subject
 is sannikarsh se gyaan ke vishay kaa hi pratyaksh hota he, uske aashray kaa nahin
 With this effect, the misleading of the religion of one substance in another is visible
 yogaj - yogabhyas se manushya kii aatma main ek vishisht dharm kaa udai hota he
 This religion is called the yogic approximation of the senses with the subject
 isse indriyon kaa samathrya bad jaataa he, jiske falswaroop indriyaan duurastha or avidhyman padaarth kaa bhi pratyaksh karne lagati hai
 It is through his influence that the yogi attains servility
 nity pratyaksh - is sandarbh main yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki ukt janya pratyakshon se atirikt ek nity pratyaksh bhi he, jo ajanma evam avinashi he
 He directly subjects the whole world and is the cause of all actions as gratuitous
 vah ekmaatr ishwar main hi samavet rahata he
 By inference proof, knowledge of all those substances which, despite having ability to be known by the senses, are not known to the senses due to being remote or non-sensible or which do not have the ability to be known by the senses
 iske do bhed hote hai - swaarthanumaan or pararthanumaan
 The presumption that resolves a doubt or verifies itself is called a "self-prediction" and the inference that the other person - curious, respondent or arbitrator - resolves or verifies the skeptic is called a "prediction" goes
 "swaarthanumaan" kii nishpatti anya purush ke vachan kii apeksha na kar apane prayaas se hetu main saadhy kii vyapti kaa gyaan arjeet kar kii jaati he or "pararthanumaan" kii nishpatti anya purush ke vachan se arthath panchavyavatmak nyaay ke prayog se vyaptigyaan praapt kar kii jaati he
 That is why Gangeshopadhyay has clearly stated in the element of Tattvacinthamani- nyaay - isaki paribhaasha aarambh main bataai gai he
 Its five components are considered in jurisprudence - vows, for, examples, subunits and guimans
 jis vaakya se paksh ke saath saadhy ke sambandh kaa gyaan ho use "pratigya", jis vaakya se hetu main saadhy kii gyaapakataa avgat ho use "hetu", jis vaakya se hetu main saadhy kii vyapti bataai jaae use "udhaaharan", jis vaakya se paksh main saadhyvaakya hetu kaa sambandh bodhit ho use "upanay" or jis vaakya ke hetu kaa abadhitatv evam asatpratipakshitatv bataate hue hetu ke samarthy se paksh main saadhy ke sambandh kaa upsanhaar kiya jaae use "nigaman" kaha jaataa he
 Their examples are in order: isi panchavyavatmak vaakya ko vatsyayan ne "param nyaay" kaha he
 For, Vyaptigyan or Vyapti Jnana, the enlightened mind is called inference
 inamen teesraa paksh bahut hi kam prasiddh he par pratham do paksh adhik prasiddh hai
 Udayanacharya and his followers call "liut" and Gangesopadhyay and his followers Vyaptigyan are estimates
 nyaay darshan main anumaan ke teen bhed bataae gaye hai- purvawat, sheshwat or saamanyatodrusht
 Vatsyayana has given two types of interpretations of these estimates as follows: 1
 purvawat = ek aashray main ek saath pratyaksh do padaarthon main jaise- paakshala main ek pratyaksh dekhe gaye dhooma or ek se duusare kaa purv kii bhanti saath hone kaa anumaan vahri main dhooma se parvat vahni kaa anumaan 2
 Sheshvat = Prohibition of the person and the absence of attraction elsewhere, such as - being emotional, estimating the substance, properties, deeds, common residual substance
 vishesh or samavaay main shabd ke antarbhaav kii prasakti honaper satta jati kaa aashray hone se saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay main ek dravyamaatr main samavet hone se dravya main or shabdaantar kaa kaaran hone se karm main antarbhaav kaa nishedh tathaa abhaav main bhavatmak shabd ke antarbhaav kii aprasakti se shesh bachane vaale gun main shabd ke antarbhaav kaa anumaan
 3
 Normative = The two substances in which the broad sense relation, such as desire, property and soul are not directly known, but when the direct known relationship is not directly known, but the general analogy of substances in general is the properties and substance
 The relation of the matter is well known, the desire is in the estimation of each other, the resemblance of the property in the form of matter and the substance in the soul
 The other will cause the more properties estimated true selves fluid as their shelter
 ukt teenon anumaanon main prayek ke teen bhed maane jate hai- "kevalanwai", "kevalavyatireki" or anvayavyatireki
 The basis of these distinctions is given by Raghunath Shiromani to Sadhya, Udayanacharya to Vyapatrahaka Sahyog and Gangeshopadhyay considered Vyapati
 raghunatha kaa taatpary yah he ki jis saadhy kaa vipaksh nahin hota us saadhy kaa anumaan "kevalanwai" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jaise vaachyatv, gyeyatv aadi saarvatrik dharmon kaa anumaan; evam jis saadhy kaa sapaksh nahin hota us saadhy kaa anumaan "keval vyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jaise gandh se pruthivi main pruthivitarbhed kaa anumaan; tathaa jis saadhy main sapaksh, vipaksh donon hote hai us saadhy kaa anumaan "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he, jais gum se vahri kaa anumaan
 Udayanacharya means that "exploitation" = co-operation of purpose and "perennial co-operation" = co-operation of subjectivity in practice, both these synergies are knowledge of enlightenment and permission from the same, hence the permission of which the productive prevalence The rise of knowledge is only due to the knowledge of innovation, the reason for the permission "only", and the permission of which the productive philosophy is born only to the person
 The permission is due to the practice of "permission only" and the permission of which the productive prevalence of knowledge arises from the knowledge of both exploitation and perverse association is called "anonymity" inference
 gangashopadhyaay kaa abhipraay yah he ki anumiti kii utpatti keval anvayavyaptigyaan se hi nahin hoti, kintu vyatirekvyaptigyaan se bhi hoti he, at: jis anumiti kaa janm keval anvayavyaptigyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalanwai", evam jis anumiti kaa janm keval vyatirekvyapti ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalavyatireki" tathaa jis anumiti kaa janm anvay or vyatirek donon vyaptiyon ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he
 The substance in which permissiveness arises from the knowledge of practicum and inclinations is called "for" or linga
 uske do bhed hote hai - "saddhetu" or hetvabhaas 
 The following five forms must be present in the Siddhetu: yahan ukt paanchon ke roopon se sampann hona keval anvayavyatireki saddhetu ke liye hi aavashyak he
 Kevalavayi Saddhetu requires "oppositionism" to be accomplished by an additional four forms
 hetvabhaas - jiske gyaan se anumiti uske karanbhoot vyaptigyaan yaa pakshadharmatagyaan kaa pratibandh hota he use - hetugat dosha arth main - "hetvabhaas" kaha jaataa he or ye dosha jin hetuon main hote hai unhen- "dusht hetu arth main"- "hetvabhaas" kaha jaataa he
 Five distinctions of the pertinent defect are considered
 nimnlikhit talika se yah samajha ja saktaa he ki ve bhed koun hai, unke dwaara kya pratibadhya hota he, tathaa unase yukt dusht hetuon ke kya naam hai? Due to permission - Three-time counseling for gender is the reason for permission
 "paksh hetu ke sambandh kaa gyaan" pratham ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he- jaise parvat main dhooma ke sambandh kaa "parvato dhoomavan" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 "the knowledge of the prevalence of attainment in the" is called the second gender counseling - as in Dhoom, the "dhoomo Vahriya Vyapya" of Vravivyapati: "this kind of knowledge
 paksh main saadhyavyapya hetu ke sambandh kaa gyaan" tritiy yaa charam ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he - jaise parvat main vahrivyapya dhooma ke sambandh kaa "parvato vahrivyapya dhoomavan" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 Discrimination - "discrimination" is also a reason for permission
 paksh main saadhy kaa nishchay rahane kii dasha main anumiti kii utpatti ko rokane ke liye ise anumiti kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 The ancient Nyayikas have referred to the "sadhyasya", Udayanacharya the "permissive Desire", the affable Mishra as the "permissive-will" in the absence of the permissive will, and in the absence of it the "will of God" and Gangesopadhyay has given the "siddha-siddhivirishivistiddhivabhava" Is considered "favoritism"
 gangashopadhyaay kaa mantavya yah he ki jab paksh main saadhy siddhi hoti he or us saadhy ko anumaan se jaanane kii ichha nahin hoti, usee samay anumiti kii utpatti nahin hoti he; kintu saadhy ko anumaan se jaanane kii ichha hone par paksh main saadhyanishchay kii dasha main bhi anumiti kii utpatti hoti he
 There is no fixed requirement of provable or allowance for that
 pratibandh kaa bhav - yah bhi anumiti kaa kaaran he
 It can be divided into four forms according to the following table
 in chaaron nishchayon se anumiti kaa pratibandh hota he; at: in chaaron nishchayon kaa abhaav "pratibandhkabhaav" ke rup main anumiti kaa kaaran hota he
 Vyapati - Vyapati knowledge has been said to be the reason for permission as second gender tradition
 is vyapti ke nirvachan main naiyayikon ne bada purusharth pradarshit kiya he; kyonk yahi anumaan ke pramantv kii aadharshila he
 The prevalence has been mainly considered to be of two types - "anvayavaypati" and "vyatirekavyapati"
 jis vyapti ke sharir main - saadhy main hetu vyaapkatv - pravesh ho use siddhanthabhat anvayavyapti kaha jaataa he - jaise "hetuvyapaksaadhyasaamanadhikarany"
 And the coverage in which the body - in the sense of being - is known as "vyatirekavya vyapti" - is a "sadhyabhavya vyakbhava competition"
 anvayavyapti kaa taatpary yah he ki hetu kaa aise saadhy ke aashray main rahanaa, jiskaa hetu ke kisi aashray main abhaav na ho
 And the meaning of contrast is that of having a sense of belonging in the shelters of meditation
 jaise - dhoomaketu kisi aashray main vahri kaa abhaav na hone se vahri dhooma kaa vyapak he or us vahri ke aashray mahanas aadi main dhooma rahata he; isi prakaar vahnybhav ke aashrayon main dhooma kaa abhaav rahata he; isliye dhooma main vahni kii "anvay" or "vyatirek" donon vyaptiyaan rahati hai
 Measures of Vyaptigāna - Three practitioners of Vyātigāna are considered - "ignorance of adultery," "knowledge of Sadhvachar or Hettabhavāsākha in practice" and "logic"
 inamen pratham do vyaptigyaan ke saarvatrik saadhan hai; par tark sarvatra nahin kvachit hi apekshit hota he
 As Vishwanath has said in the epics of his treatise called Bhasha Parivatha: tark - gautam ne tark kaa lakshan kaha he : 
 parvarti navy naiyayikon ne tark kaa lakshan is prakaar kiya he : "vyapya ke aharya aarope se vyapak kaa jo aharya aarope hota he" vah "tark" he
 This logic is considered to be a derivative of its purity in the contrary conjecture, ie, the lack of extensive consumer exposure due to the lack of comprehensive competition
 jab kabhi hetu main saadhy vyabhichaar kii shankaa hone se vyaptigyaan kaa pratibandh hone lagata he, us shankaa ko tark dwaara nirast kar vyaptigyaan kaa path prashast kar diya jaataa he
 Just as the knowledge of the support of the housewife in the pompous Dhoom, even when there is a suspicion of adultery in the mountain Dhoom, "logic" is used to overcome it
 jaise - "kisi bhi dhooma main yadi vahri kaa vyabhichaar hoga to vahri dhooma kaa kaaran na ho sakegaa or yah sambhav nahin he ki vahri ko dhooma kaa kaaran na mana jaae; kyonki us dasha main dhooma ke sampadanarth vahri ke grahan main manushya kii niyat pravriti kaa lop ho jayega"
 As a result of this argument, it is concluded that "dhoom originates from the atmosphere and hence there is a lack of adultery" and after the conclusion, the knowledge of transnationalism in Dhoom is uninterrupted as the apprehension of adultery in the mountain Dhoom is concluded
 it happens
 uparyukt tarklakshak sutara kii vishwanathavritti main tark ke atmashray, anyonyashray, chakrak, anavastha or in chaaron se pruthak baadhitarthprasang, ye paanch bhed batala kar prayek kaa udhaaharan pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Degree - The one who lives in all the shelters of matter but does not live in all the shelters for it is called "title"
 oopaadhi ke teen bhed hote hai - shuddh saadhy kaa vyapak, pakshadharmasahit saadhy kaa vyapak tathaa sadhanyukt saadhy kaa vyapak
 Knowledge of the title is not a direct opponent of prevalence
 arthath hetu main saadhy vyapak oopaadhi ke vyabhichaar se usamen saadhy vyabhichaar kaa anubhav hota he or saadhy ke us anumanik vyabhichaargyan se vyaptigyaan kaa saakshaat pratibandh hota he
 The analogy of other substances in one substance is called "upaman" evidence
 isse arthvishesh main shabd vishesh ke shakti sambandh kaa gyaan hota he
 His process is as follows
 jab koi aranyavasi manushya kisi gramvasi manushya ko bataata he ki arany main tumhaari gau ke sadrush gavay naam kaa ek pashu hota he, jab tum arany main kabhi janaa to jis pashu ko apni gau ke sadrush dekhnaa use gavay samaj lenaa, tadnusaar jab gramvasi kabhi arany jaataa he or vahaan apni gau ke sadrush kisi pashu ko dekhtaa he use aranyavasi kii baat kaa samaran hota he or use falswaroop us pashu main use gavay shabd ke shaktsambandh kaa nishchay ho jaataa he
 In this way, the philosophy of Gosaduchya in Gaavya is called the fruit called Upamakruti, the remembrance of the meaning assigned by the Aranyavasi, his business and the determination of the power of the word Gaavya in the Gaavya
 udaynacharya ne yahi baat agrim karika main kahi he
 This topic is even more detailed in the advance works of Vishwanath Nyaypanchanan: ise bhi dekhen - aptpraman In which the experience of the substance is remembered by the knowledge of the power or characteristic relation of the substance, it is called "word proof"
 ghat shabd main ghatpadaarth ke shakti sambandh ke gyaan se ghat kaa samaran hokar ghat kaa anubhav or ganga shabd main gangatir ke lakshan sambandh ke gyaan se gangatir kaa samaran hokar gangatir kaa anubhav hone se ghat or gangatir rup arthon main ghat or ganga shabd pramaan hote hai
 The word so-called is a sign of such meaning, or it is interpreted by such-and-such word, this type of eternal God-sign is called power
 jaise raja bhageerath ne kapil muni ke shaap se dugdh or apane purvaj saar suton ke uddhararth jis jalpravaah ko prithvi par pravartit kiya, us jalpravaah main ganga kaa anadi sanket us arth main ganga shabd kii shakti he
 In the sense, the modern sign of the word, which is a non-permanent sign, in that sense, the modern sign of that word is called "definition"
 jaise kisi nutan vastu ke liye uske nirmaataa dwaara nishchit kiya gaya koi naam
 The word's connotation is called "symptom"
 jaise- shabd ke shakyarth jalpravaah kaa tir ke saath sanyog sambandh
 When power cannot be realized by the power of a speaker with a word, by that symptom the belief of that meaning is completed
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar arth ke shakti or lakshan sambandh sanskrit bhashaa ke shuddh shabdon main hi ashrith hote hai, anya bhashaaon ke shabd nyaayashastra kii drushti main apshabd yaa apbhransh maane jate hai
 The word apabhramsa signifies the meaning when it is defined or it has the power of meaning
 shakti or lakshan se atirikt vyanjana naam kaa koi shabdaarth sambandh nyaayashastra main maanya nahin he
 Realization of the meaning for which such a third relationship is considered, the realization of it is done by symptoms, somewhere by knowledge symptoms, by mind, and sometimes by inference
 shabd pramaan ke do bhed hote hai- loukik or vaidic
 In these, the temporal terminology is considered to be evidence from the dialogue of other temporal proofs, but the Vedic terminology is also considered as proof without communicating any temporal proof
 vedamulak smritiyon ko loukik kaha jaae yaa vaidic, kintu unka pramantv veda ke samvaad par nirbhar hota he
 The word proof experience is called Shabdabodha
 vah padagyaan, pad-padaarth sambandh gyaan, padaarth samaran aakankshagyaan, aasakti yaa aasaktigyaan, yogyatagyaan yaa ayogyata nishchay kaa abhaav, taatparygyan yaa taatparygyapak prakaran in saat kaarnon se utpann hota he
 Experience and remembrance - Knowledge from the above four evidences is called experience
 anubhav ke do bhed hote hai- upekshaatmak or anupekshaatmak
 The experience that dissolves without imposing a sacrament of its subject is called "neglectful experience" and the experience which is destroyed by generating the sacrament of its subject is called "unimportant" experience
 kalantar main isi sanskaar ke jaagran se jo purv anubhav ke samaan gyanantar paidaa hota he use hi "samaran" kaha jaataa he
 The precision and inexactness of remembrance depends on the reality and inexactness of experience
 samaran ko pramaan or bhram donon se bhinn mana jaataa he, kyonki use pramaan maanane par uske liye atirikt pramaan tathaa bhram maanane par uske kaaran rup main atirikt dosha kii kalpana kerani hogi, jo uchit nahin he
 Pratyabhijya - Fluent cognition is called "pratyabhidya"
 sanskaar or indriya ke sammilit vyapaar se uski utpatti hoti he
 Being a customer of the unity of a predetermined and visible substance is the proof of the same permanent substance in power
 jab man sanyukt indriya ke sannikarsh se kisi vishay kaa pratyaksh hota he, jab tak us vishay ke saath indriya kaa tathaa indriya ke saath man kaa sanyog bana rahata he, pratirakshan us vishay kaa nayaa nayaa pratyakshgyaan hota rahata he
 This direct group is called streamwise knowledge
 vishay ke abaadhit hone se yah gyaan bhi pramaatmak mana jaataa he
 Otherwise, there are two distinctions of popular choice knowledge - prama and delusion
 bhram kaa hi doosraa naam he "anyathaakhyati"
 It has three distinctions - skepticism and accusation
 ek hi aashay main paraspar virdohi do padaarthon ke ek gyaan ko "sanshay" kaha jaataa he, jaise- "shabd: nityo na vaa" 
 The determination of the religion of another object in an object is called "antonyms", such as the knowledge of silverness in the CP glowing in the light of the sun
 virdohi gyaan ke rahete hue gyaata kii ichha se utpann honevaala gyaan "aarope" yaa "aharya" kaha jaataa he, jaise ranga ko chaandi bataakar kisi ganvaar ke haath use bechnewale thag ko range main chandeepan ke abhaav kaa gyaan hote hue bhi usamen ichhaapurvak chandeepan kaa gyaan
 In order to derive these other interpreters, the "enlightenment" supernatural approximation has been conceived in jurisprudence
 swatastv, paratstv- gyaan ke prama or bhram do bhed bataae gaye hai
 There are different views of different philosophies about their origin and their knowledge of divinity or illusion, but in jurisprudence, it is assumed that the origin of pramma is not only due to general knowledge but with the help of qualitative reason
 And the illusion originates with the help of discriminatory reason rather than by itself
 isi prakaar gyaan ke pramaatv evam bhramatv kaa gyaan bhi swat: arthath gyaan ke swaroopagraahak kaaran maatr se na hokar anya kaaran ke sannidhan se hota he, jaise pramaatv kaa gyaan "safal pravritihetuk anumaan" or bhramatv kaa gyaan "vifalpravritihetuk anumaan" se hota he
 The knowledge from which the tendency is successful i
e
 the attainment of the known subject is considered prama and the knowledge from which the tendency to fail is not the root of the known subject, it is called illusion
 nyaayashastra ke gyatavya vishyon me vaad, jalp or vitanda kaa bhi mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Vatsyayan has treated these three with the word "katha" in his judgment
 katha kaa arth he kisi vishay par vidwaanon kaa vah parsparik vichaar jo vaad, jalp or vitanda ke rup main uplabdh hota he
 The idea that is aimed at elemental decision is called "plead" and the idea that is aimed at conquering the opponent is called "jalp" and "vittanda"
 vaadaatmak vichaar main "chal" or "jati" kaa prayog tathaa "apsiddhant" "nune", adhik" or "hetvabhaas" se atirikt nigrah sthanon kaa udbhaavan vajry mana gaya he
 In this view, there is no need for assembly, arbitrator and king or royal representative
 isamen bhaag lenevaale vidvan avinitvanchak, asuyavan yaa duragrahi nahin hote
 Its goal is to reach elementality with pure justice
 isamen vichaarkon ke bich jayaparajay kii koi bhaavana nahin hoti
 The nature of jalp and vitanda is quite different from that of the suit
 in vichaaron main bhaag lene vaale vidwaanon kaa uddeshy tatvanirnay nahin, apitu jis kisi prakaar apane pratidwandvi ko mook banaakar apane aapako vijayi siddh karnaa hota he
 That is why the use of deceit and caste in these ideas and the emergence of all types of control places are cut off, as well as the smooth conduct of the idea requires assembly, arbitrator and state control
 jalp or vitanda ke uddeshy main aikya hone par bhi unki prakruti main bahut antar he
 Just as in the Zalp both the plaintiff and the defendant deny their party's means and antagonism, but in Vitanda only the plaintiff seeks his party's means, the defendant establishes his favor by defending the plaintiff's favor only And keeps on trying his means
 tatv nirnay ke liye "vaad" tathaa nirnit tatv kii raksha ke liye "jalp" or vitanda kii upyogita maani jaati he
 These subjects are also major subjects of jurisprudence
 prativaadee ke chhalpurvak akraman se apane paksh kii raksha ke liye chal kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 To denounce the plaintiff's side, his word conceives of his unnamed meaning as "deceit"
 chal ke teen bhed hote hai- vaakchal, saamanyachchhal or upachaarchchhal
 Knowledge of "caste" is necessary to avoid the use of "caste" itself, and to gain the ability to declare it unresponsive when the defendant uses "caste"
 vyapti ke abhaav main keval sadhamry yaa vaidharmy se vaadi ke paksh main dosha-pradarshan karne kaa naam "jati" he : There are twenty four distinctions of caste - apane aapako nigrahasthaan main padane se bachaane ke liye tathaa prativaadee ke nigrahasthaan main pahunchne par vigrahasthaan kaa nirdesh kar prativaadee ko nigruhit karne kii arhata praapt karne ke liye nigrahasthaan kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Its twenty-two distinctions are pledge, pledge, objection, pledge, oblation, subordination, meaningless, nonsense, unquestionable, non-committal, non-existent, inferior, excess, repetitive, non-objection, ignorance, retribution, deflection, obloquy, apportionment, abrogation, abstention
 chal, jati or nigrahasthaan ke ukt bhedon ke lakshan or udhaaharan kii jaankaree ke liye nyaayadarshan ke pratham adhyay ke dwitiya aahrik tathaa pancham adhyay or unpar vatsyayan ke nyaaybhashya kaa avlokan karnaa chahie
 Atma - The avidya, which is the Divine consciousness, is called Atma
 uske do bhed hai- jeevatma or paramatma
 God - The name of God is God
 vah ek or vyapak he
 Knowledge, desire and effort are its special qualities and they are all continual and universal
 ishwar hi jeevon ke purvarjit shubh, ashubh karmon ke anusaar jagat kii rachana karata he
 At the beginning of creation, Vedas are constructed for the benefit of the living beings
 brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra in chaar varnon tathaa brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanprastha or sanyas in chaar ashramon kii vyavastha kar manushyon ko varnashram dharm kii tathaa anya prakaar ke vividh lokvyavahaar kii shiksha pradaan karata he
 The same world is known as Brahma, being a foster, Vishnu as a foster and Rudra being a coddler
 vah anumaan or shaastra se gamy he
 Perhaps he is also visible, but only to the Siddha Yogi
 jeevatma- jeevatma kii sankhya anant he
 Every living being is the shelter of the broad and special qualities of knowledge, desire, effort etc
 and with those qualities is the direct Vedya by the mind
 prayek jeev shubhashubh karmon kii punya paaparup vaasana tathaa vividh prakaar ke anubhavon kii vaasana dwaara anadi kaal se baddh hota he
 Dev, demon, yaksha, gandharva, humans, animals, birds, snakes, scorpions, insects, moths, creepers, vegetation etc
 She is born in various varietal vagaries
 ukt bandhan tathaa tanmoolak du:khayantranaa se use chhutkaaraa nahin miltaa jab tab use paramatma or swatma kaa tatvasaakshaatkaar nahin ho jaataa
 Twenty-one types of sorrow have been considered in salvation - jurisprudence
 ghran rasna, chakshu, tvak, shroatra or man ye chha: indriyaan; gandh, ras, rup, sparsh, shabd or ragadveshmohatmak dosha ye chha: vishay; vishayendriyon ke sampark se hone vaale chha: vishayanubhav, sharir sukh or du:kha- inamen antim "du:kha" swabhaavat: dweshya hone ke kaaran mukhya du:kha he, kintu sukh mukhya du:kha se anubiddh hone ke kaaran tathaa anya unniis mukhya du:kha ke janak hone ke kaaran gaun du:kha hai- in ikkis prakaar ke du:khon se sarvada ke liye purna rup se chhutkaaraa paane kaa hi naam he "moksh"he Mokshaksara - The "purification of the mind" from the ritual of Siddharma, "element knowledge of substances" and "direct realization of the real nature of the soul" These three are the means of salvation
 nity, naimitthik or nishkaam karm ke shraddha evam niyampurvak chir anushthan se jab manushya apane chitt kaa shodhan kar letaa he, sansar ke vishyon se use virakti ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop use jagat ke padaarthon visheshat: paramatma or swatma kii tatvajigyaasa hoti he
 Inspired by that curiosity, he reached the feet of Sadhguru, proof of this, by studying Shastra
 Theorem, etc
 Sixteen substances - whose justice - the penetrating scholars of Vaiseshika have ingested into these seven substances - matter, virtue, action, general, special, equitable and absence - earns philosophy
 ananthar manan, nididhyasana evam adarpurvak dirghakalvyapee avichhinn abhyaas se paramatma kaa alokik maanas tathaa visheshgunamukt aatma kaa loukik maanas tatv saakshaatkaar praapt kar nyaay darshan ke dwitiya sutara main kahe gaye kram se pehle jeevanmukti praapt karata he, arthath jivan kaal main hi sab bandhanon se mukt ho jaataa he or uske baad praarabdh karmon kaa bhoga dwaara avsaan ho jane par vartmaan sharir se sambandh todakar videhamukti ko praapt karata he
 He is never born again in any form, and he becomes eternally unhappy like God and is eternally reputed in his pure pure form

 The time of Maharaja Bhojraj has been accepted by historians from 1010-1055 AD
 atev saraswatikanthabharan kaa rachanakaal isvi gyarahavin shatabdi kaa madhya mana ja saktaa he
 Its pioneer is somewhat predecessor to Mammatt, the author of Kaviprakash
 yadhyapi aanandavardhan dwaara dhvanisiddhant kii sthapana ho chuki thi tathaapi us samay tak kaavyatma ke rup main dhwani kii manyata vivadagrast si hi thi ; atev saakshaat rup se dhwani ko kavy kii paribhaasha main aatma ke rup main sthaan dene kii dridhtaa na bhojdev ne hi apanaai or na bhatta mammat ne hi
 Both acharyas have given importance to doshava and quality in poetry
 bhojdev kii yah visheshta he ki unhone alankaaron kii upadayeta kanthat: sweekaar kii he tathaa kavy ke liye rasanvit hona aavashyak samajha he
 Thus, Bhojdev's Saraswati Kantha Bharan has influenced Mammat and Vishwanath in part
 saraswatikanthabharan ek dirghakaay granth he jisamen paanch pariched hai
 In the first passage, after giving the definition of poetry general, the author has first discussed the long and virtue of poetry
 isi sandarbh main bhojdev ne pad, vaakya evam vaakyarthgat dosha bataae hai
 The number of defects of each type is sixteen
 bhojdev ke anusaar gun, shabdagat or vaakyarth gat hote hai or prayek ke choubees bhed hai
 At the end of the first passage, certain defects become attributes somewhere
 is kavyatatv ko udhaaharan dwaara samajhaate hue unhone kavyadosha kaa nityanityatv sweekrut kiya he
 In the second passage, while deciding on the phraseology, he first emphasized justification and has given a thoughtful explanation of caste, ritual, attitude, shadow, posture, utterance, tact, bhuniti, hump, bed and readiness
 in baarah tatwon main se reeti ko chhod shesh tatwon kaa vishad vivechan sanskrit ke kisi anya uplabdh sahityagranth main praapt nahin hota
 Banabhatta mentions the bed of special poetic element, but its definition is available only in Saraswati Kantabharana
 tatpashchaat, yamak, shlesh, anupras, chitra, prahelika, gudh evam prashnottar alankaaron ke bhuri bhedopabhedon kaa sodaaharan vivaran diya gaya he
 This part also has the most personal feature of Saraswati Kantabharan
 tadnantar bhojdev kavyavyutpatti ke kaarnon kaa vivechan kar kavy ke teen bhedon ko shravy, drishy evam chitrabhinay ke rup main prastut karte hai
 He has not mentioned Darsuparchakas under visualization, but his division on dance and dance is limited
 tisare pariched main arthanlakaaron ke swaroop evam prakaar bhed kaa vivechan he jo itar saahityachaaryon kii apeksha bhinn swaroop ko liye hue he
 In the fourth passage, there is a discussion of bisexuality, in which the distinction of ornaments of upma etc
 is explained in detail
 antim pariched he - rasvivechan
 In it, the character of Naikadi and the expressions, emotions and experiences have been decided in detail; At the same time, there is also a reference to the form of Kavyapaka, the diverse nightlife
 ant main bharti, kaishiki aadi vrittiyon ke vivechan ke saath granthopasanhaar hota he
 Rasasiddhanta's explanation in Saraswati Kantabharana is often a bird's eye view of the subject
 kavyagat ras gambhir vishay he jisaki garima ke saath purnat: nyaay karne kii drushti se bhoj ne ek shringarprakash naamak swatantra granth kii rachana kar rasvivechan ke adhyay kii purti kii he
 The specialty of Saraswati Kantha Bharan is that it is a broader and derivative text than other literary texts
 iske rachayita bhojdev granthvistaar ke bhay se bhit honevaale nahin hai, udhaaharan de-dekar anek sookshm bhed evam upabhedon ko samajhane kaa sadaa ve udaar prayaas karte hai
 Although the recognition of the discrimination presented by them has not been accepted by the later writers, yet the persistence of disagreeing with their elemental deliberations is also not visible
 is granth par adyopant kisi tikaa kii rachana nahin milti
 On the first three passages, there is a vaccine called Ratneshwar Ramsinghrit Darpan Tika and on the fourth passage, the description of the famous commentator Jagadghar, is not the vaccine for the fifth passage
 yah granth nirnay sagar dwaara prakashit he
 It has not been translated yet
 saraswatikanthabharan main uddhrut udhaaharan shlokon kii suchi or unke rachayitaaon kii khoj kar ek suchi karnal jacob ne banaai he, jo india offis librori, landan main surakshit he

 From the start of the work till the completion of the work, it is done to reconsider each step and finalize the outline and complete that particular task

 Actress Vidya Balan plays the title role of the head of a brothel in the film, and the backdrop of the story stems from the 1947 partition of Indian independence

 In 1947 India sought independence from the British, assigning the responsibility of dividing Cyril Radcliffe, the last Viceroy of India, to Mountbatten, Cyril Radcliffe
 redcliff ne do line banaain - ek punjab main or bengal main ek or
 This line was known as the Radcliffe Line
 begum jaan ek veshya he jo sakkargarh or doranga ke shaharon ke bich ek veshyalay chalaati he
 The prostitutes are many girls who raised themselves, who were either abandoned or abandoned by their families and now work for them
 veshyalay ke sadasyon main ek bujurg mahila bhi shaamil he jise ammaa, sujith naamak ek sthaneey kaaryakarta shaamil hai, jo apane graahakon or ankal saleem ko lekar aate hai
 They travel to government officials Hari Prasad, Ilyas Khan and Inspector Shyam Singh and are asking all the residents to evict the brothel, as it is on the land that has to pass through the Radcliffe Line, to show the love between Sujeet and Rubina

 begum jaan ke veshyalay ko raja sahab kii dekharekh main rakhaa jaataa he, jinke sangrakshan ke tahat ve surakshit or sundar hai
 He pays his taxes and duties Begum Jaan sends him a message to help him in this matter
 vah veshyalay main aati he or unke liye prastut karata he or unki durdasha sunakar, vah unhen yah bataakar aashwaasan detaa he ki vah jald hi dilli ja rahe hai or is maamle par vahaan charchaa karenge
 However, he demands to spend the night with the young Shabnam, who recently joined the brothel as a psychic after being abused
 begum ko raat main anand lene ke liye kaha jaataa he, jabaki vah apni raat kaa anand uthaate hai
 He is forced to oblige begum jaan or uske band ko ek maheene kaa notice dene ke baavjood unhen chhodane ke kai asafal prayaason ke baad, hari or eliyas, ek hataash aakhri resort ke rup main, sonpur main ek kukhyat hatyare kabir kii sahaayta ke liye, use dhamkee dene ke liye uske sadasyon ko veshyalay khaali karne ke liye raja saab ek din veshyalay main waapas laute, begum jaan ko yah suchit karne ke liye ki unke prayaas vifal rahe hai or ab unhen veshyalay khaali karnaa hoga
 Begum, who was expecting, was shocked in despair
 kabir begum kii pyaari kutton ko maarane ke liye aage badhate hai, yahaan tak ki begum or unki ladakiyon ko bhi apane maance khilaati hai
 He again kills Sujeet when he is returning from the market along with some members of Begum Jaan
 vah apane jivan kaa tyaag karte hue bhaagane ke liye unhen prerit karata he yah hatya begum jaan or uske sadasyon ko aage badhati he
 As a result of Kabir's threatening tactics, Begum asks Salim to train each girl to use weapons and fight back
 gahan prashikshan abhyaas satr yojit kiye jate hai
 Meanwhile, Mastrji, Ladli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and, in her proposal, unaware that another prostitute named Gulaba, is also hesitant about feelings for her, Begum Jaan rejects her offer and abandons her
 Asked, planning to kill him with the help of a cruel master
 vah belaag jaan se vishwasghaat karne vaale veshyalay se bhaagane ke liye gulaba ko aashwast karata he
 Gulaba does so, but Mastrji leaves him and lets him be raped by his partner in a horse carriage

 gulabow waapas laut aate hai or baad main masterji ke gale ko maarthe hai, jabaki vah kabir or unke gundon dwaara veshyalay par hamalaa karte hue dekh rahe hai
 However, he was shot shortly thereafter
 gundon ne veshyalay ke andar ujaale hue mashaalon ko phenk diya, jiske kaaran imaaraten lapaton main ghiri hui thim
 Begum Jaan and her girls fought a certain battle
 kai maare gaye hai vah or uske chaar jivit sadsy muskuraate hue apane ghar ko jalte hue dikh rahe the; ve imaarat ke andar chalate hai or daravaaje band karte hai
 They burn death as Amma tells the story of Padmavati, the queen of Chittorgarh, who, like the plight of Begum Jaan, refused to fall into the hands of the enemies and was martyred as a martyr
 jaise hi film samaapt ho jaati he, eliyas, hari prasad or shyaam singh ko unke kaaryon kaa apmaan mana jaataa he; eliyas khud ko goli martha he or hamen veshyalay ke avshesh or begum jaan kii viraasat ke ant main dikhaaya gaya he

 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
