 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein

 Asirgarh is a village located in Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh
 aseergarh kaa aitihaasik qila bahut prasiddh he
 The Asirgarh Fort is located at a height of 250 feet above sea level on the summit of the Satpura hills, about 20 kilometers north of Burhanpur
 yah qila aaj bhi apane vaibhavshaalee ateet kii gungatha kaa gaan mukt kanth se kar rahaa he
 Its then invincibility proves itself
 isaki gananaa vishwa vikhyath un gine chune kilon main hoti he, jo durbhed or ajey, maane jate the
 Historians have referred to it as 'bab-e-deccan' and 'kalod-e-deccan', because after conquering this fort the gate of the south was opened, and the conqueror established the suzerainty over the entire Khandesh region
 Used to be is qile kii sthapana kab or kisne kii yah vishwaas se nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Historians have been forced to have a clear and correct opinion
 kuch itihaaskaar is qile kaa mahabharat ke vir yoddha guru dronacharya ke putr ashwatthama kii amartv kii gaatha se sambandhit karte hue unki puja sthali bataate hai
 There is a beautiful tunnel near the 'gupteshwar Mahadev Temple' of Burhanpur, which is as long as Asirgarh
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki, parvon ke din ashwatthama tapti nadi main snaan karne aate hai, or baad main 'gupteshwar' kii puja kar apane sthaan par laut jate hai
 Some historians attribute it to the Ramayana period
 prasiddh itihaaskaar 'mohammad kasim' ke kathananusaar iskaa 'aashaa ahir' naamak ek vyakti ne nirmaan karaayaa tha
 Asha Ahir had thousands of animals
 unki suraksha hetu aise hi surakshit sthaan kii aavashyaktaa thi
 It is said that he came to this place in the fifteenth century and built a wall of brick, lime and stones at this place
 is tarah aashaa ahir ke naam se yah qila aseergarh naam se prasiddh ho gaya
 Asirgarh had also been under the suzerainty of the kings of the Chauhan dynasty for some time, which is mentioned by historians of Rajputana in context
 kuch samay baad aseergarh qile kii prasiddhi dur-dur tak fail gai
 Naseer Khan Farooqui, son of Malik Khan, a soldier of Ferozeshah Tughlaq, was influenced by the fame of Asirgarh
 vah burhanpur aayaa
 He met Asha Ahir and requested that "my brothers and Balkana zamindars keep harassing me, and remain enemies of my life
" isliye aap meri sahaayta karen or mere parivaar ke logon ko is surakshit sthaan par rahane kii anumati den, to krupa hogi" aashaa ahir udaar vyakti tha, usne naseer khaan kii baat par vishwaas karke use qile main rahane kii ajna de di
 Naseer Khan first sent women and children in some bundles and in some sent armed soldiers armed with warriors
 aashaa ahir or uske putr swaagat ke liye aaye
 As soon as the doli entered the fort, Asha Ahir and her sons were attacked and were put to death
 is prakaar dekhte hi dekhte naseer khaan faaruqi kaa is qile par adhikaar ho gaya
 After the death of Adilshah Farooqui, the fort of Asirgarh came under Bahadur Shah's authority
 vah dur drushti vaala badshaah nahin tha
 He did not make any arrangement for the safety of himself and the fort, Emperor Akbar was distraught to establish his suzerainty over this fort upon hearing the fame of Asirgarh
 usne dakshin kii ore palaayan kiya
 As soon as Bahadur Shah Farooqi came to know about this, he made such a powerful arrangement in the fort for his protection, that even after being surrounded for ten years, there was no need for anything from outside
 samraat akbar ne aseergarh par akraman karana prarambh kar diya tha, evam qile ke saare raste band kar diye the
 He started firing at the fort with cannon night and day
 is prakaar yuddh kaa kram nirantar chalata rahaa, parantu akbar ko har baar asafalataa kaa hi munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 He consulted with his counselors, then it was decided to talk to Bahadur Shah
 sandeshvahak dwaara sandesh bheja gaya
 At the same time it was also assured that Bahadur Shah will not face any kind of heat
 bahadurshah ne samraat akbar kii baat par vishwaas kiya
 He came out of the fort to meet her
 bahadurshah faaruqi ne abhivadan kiya or tatpashchaat baat prarambh hui
 While the conversation was going on, a soldier attacked Bahadurshah from behind and wounded him and took him captive
 usne akbar se kaha "yah tumne mere saath vishwasghaat kiya" he
 To this Akbar said that "everything is justified in politics
" " phir akbar ne raajnneetik daanv-pench or chal-kapat se qile ke qiledaaron or sipaahiyon kaa sona, chaandi, heere, motiyon se moonh bhar diya
 These greed opened the gate of the fort
 akbar kii fuj qile main ghus gai
 Bahadur Shah's army could not stand in front of Akbar's army
 is tarah dekhte hi dekhte 17 janvari san 1601 i
 ko aseergarh ke qile par akbar ko vijay praapt ho gai or qile par mogul shashan kaa dhvaj fahraane laga
 Akbar's army took Bahadur Shah's sons captive
 akbar ne bahadurshah faaruqi ko gwalior ke qile main or uske putron ko anya kilon main rakhane ke liye bhijwa diya
 Just as the Farooqi emperor had obtained this fort by political tricks, cunningly, in the same way this fort was also going through his hands
 is prakaar aseergarh or burhanpur par mughalon kaa aadhipaty sthapit hone ke pashchaat faaruqi vansh kaa patan ho gaya
 Famous historian Farishta writes that, "emperor emperor like Akbar also had to use the 'key of gold' to acquire the Asirgarh Fort"
 akbar ke shasankaal ke pashchaat yah qila san 1760 i
 se san 1819 i
 tak maraathon ke adhikaar main rahaa
 After the fall of the Marathas, this fort came under the suzerainty of the British
 san 1904 i
 se yahan angrezi sena nivas karti thi
 The fort of Asirgarh is divided into three divisions
 upar kaa bhaag aseergarh, madhya bhaag kamargarh or nichalaa bhaag malaygarh kehalaata he
 Two routes have been made to reach this fort
 ek rasta purv disha main, jo ek saral seedhidaar rasta he, or doosraa rasta uttar disha main he, jo atyant kathin evam kshtdaayak he
 This route is for vehicles
 vaahan kii suraksha ke liye raste ke donon ore diwaar bana di gai he
 This route ends near a large moat
 jahaan ek bada phatak nazar aata he, jo 'madar darvaaze' ke naam se prasiddh he
 Seeing the height of the fort from below, it dares, that it will be difficult to climb to such a height, but the desire to see the fort, thrives the body and fills a new power and enthusiasm
 jaise- jaise ham upar kii ore chadhate jate hai, aas-paas kaa prakritik soundarya hriday ko aakarshith karata he
 In these beautiful scenes the person climbing the fort is so engrossed, that he does not even realize how high he has reached
 qile kii bhul-bhulaiya bharaa rasta dekhakar manushya aashcharyachakit ho jaataa hai
 Seeing this strange color of the fort, when you go further, the first gate of the fort is seen
 is darvaaze se kuch dur purv disha main lambi-lambi ghaas main chupe hue ganga-yamuna naam ke pani ke alag-alag do strot dikhaai dete hai, jinka pani atyant svachh or meetha hai yahan pani kahan se aata he, kisi ko nahin maaloom
 The staircase built in the water is clear, and the way ahead
 aage badhane par bhay kaa ahsaas hota he
 It seems that some secret route must have gone to some part of the fort
 is darvaaze ke saamne ek kaali chattan he, jis par akbar, danial, aurangzeb or shahjahan ke chaar shilaalekh farsi bhashaa main sthapit hai
 These inscriptions are inscribed with the names of the conquerors and subedars of the fort
 shahjahan ke shilaalekh se gyaat hota he ki, unke kaarykaal main yahan kuch imaarton kaa nirmaan karavaaya gaya tha
 The door which is near this chattan was built by Rajagopaladas, the governor of the fort
 yahan se khadey hokar dekhen to, aas-paas ke sundar drishy hriday ko aakarshith karte hai
 Small cannons were installed on the walls of the fort and on the gates with a small margin
 qile ke upari bhaag par pravesh karte hi saamne kii ore vishaal maidan he, jis par ghaas ugi hui dikhaai detii he
 At one time it was cultivated here, but now this vast plain is deserted
 aage badhane par aseergarh kii masjid kii do minaaren saafe dikhaai detii hai
 This is the 'jama Masjid' of Asirgarh
 yah masjid purnatah kaale pathar se nirmit he
 This magnificent mosque is a classic example of the construction art of the Farooqi regime and is memorable
 yah masjid burhanpur kii jama masjid se 5 varsh purv nirmit karwaai gai thi
 The length of this mosque is 935 feet and 40 feet in width

 It has 13 arches and 4 hallways

 uttari kone kii mehrab main burhanpur kii jama masijad ke shilaalekh kii tarah sanskrit kaa shilaalekh he
 From this, the year of construction of the mosque is known
 saamne ke stambh par samraat akbar ne ek shilaalekh farsi bhashaa main ankit karavaaya tha, jisamen aseergarh par vijay kaa varnan he
 This inscription was carved on the stone by the then famous accountant 'mohammad Masoom'
 masjid ke madhya bhaag main ek vargakar pathar kaa chabutara he, iske upar lohe kaa bada pech laga hua he
 It is said that there is a secret passage under this iron door, which goes outside the fort
 yah rasta itnaa chauda he ki, ghudsavaar saraltapurvak isamen se guzar saktaa he
 It is also told that, this underground secret road used to go to Burhanpur
 angrejon ne is raste ke bare main khoj kii, parantu asafal rahe
 There are two identical towers adjoining the hallway of the mosque, which are about 80 feet high
 in minaaron ke upree bhaag tak pahunchne ke liye sidhiyon kaa ghumaavdaar rasta bana he
 To the left of the mosque entrance is a well, whose water is sweet, cold and clean

 This temple is said to be the place of worship of Ashwatthama, the Mahabharata
 mandir ke baahar nandi virajman hai, or unke saamne shivlinga va murtiyan he
 In this temple too, a secret passage is told, which ends at the ganges-yamuna, some distance away from the first door outside the fort
 sambhav he ki shatru ke qile main pravesh kar jane par evam us par dhokhe se peeche kii taraf se akraman karne hetu yah gupt maarg banaaya gaya ho
 This temple still exists even after continuous natural phenomena occur
 vastav main yah qila manushya dwaara kiye gayi kaaryon kaa aashcharyachakit kar dene vaala adbhut karnama he, jo apana udhaaharan aap hi he

 chhatrasaal ne bundelkhand kii swatantra satta sthapit karne main athak parishram kiya
 Aurangzeb also tried to suppress them but did not succeed
 chhatrasaal ne kalin ko bhi apane adhikaar main kiya
 After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 AD Bahadurgarh ascended the throne
 chhatrasaal se isaki khub bani
 During this time, the Marathas had also increased in strength

 Chhatarpur was built by them

 Built many palaces, ponds and temples in Chhatarpur during Sone Shah's time
 chhatrasaal ke samay se hi maraathon kaa shashan bundelkhand par prarambh ho gaya tha
 At that time, the ruler of Orchha also gave charath to the Marathas
 dilli ke musalmaan shaskaon dwaara araajaktaa failaane ke kaaran uttar bharat main dhime-dhime angreji shashan failata ja rahaa tha
 In 1759, Govindrao Pat was killed in the war against Ahmad Shah Abdali

 Colonel Wellesley attacked Kalpi in 1778 and defeated the Marathas
 kalantar main naanaa fadanvis kii salaah main madhav narayan ko peshwa banaaya gaya tathaa maraathon or angrejon main sandhi ho gai
 With the help of Himmat Bahadur, the British captured Bundelkhand
 san 1818 i0 tak bundelkhand ke adhikansh bhaag angrejon ke adheen ho gaye
 The year 1847 proved to be the best for the British because the son of Maharaj Ranjit Singh was made the king of Punjab after him
 lard dalhauzi is samay governor general the or unhon dilipasingh ko ayogy shaasha bataakar punjab par kabja jamaa liya
 Shivaji's descendant Pratapsingh was imprisoned in Satara, accusing him of meeting the Portuguese and subduing the garden of the south
 jhansi main gangadharrav kii mrityu ke baad damodar raav ko god liya gaya
 Efforts to remove Laxmi Bai also continued, but at the same time the incident of 1857 rebellion occurred
 berhampur, meerut, dilli, murshidabad, lakhanu, elahabaad, kaashi, kanpur, jhansi main vidroh hua or kai sthaan par updrav hue
 On Jhansi, the rebels asserted their authority over the fort and Rani Laxmibai fought the battle in some way and called Rani Laxmibai

 bakhtavali nen 31 nan0 palaton ne shekharmajaan se mail kar liya vidroh kii lahar, sagar, damoh, jabalpur aadi sthanon main fail gai
 By this time the position of the king of Panna was strong, the British sought his help
 raja ne turant sena pahunchaai or jabalpur kii 52 nan0 kii palaton ko buree tarah dabaa diya gaya
 Shanai: Shanai: Bakhtavali and Mardansingh were defeated by Sir Harose in the valley of Narhat

 In Jhansi, Kalpi, the British had to fight back

 Here too, he suffered defeat
 vah gwalior pahaunchi or sindhiya ko haraakar vahaan bhi shaasha ban baithi par sar huroj ne gwalior par achaanak hamalaa kiya
 The defeat of Rao Saheb Peshwa, Tatya Tope, death of the queen etc
 completely cooled the fire of rebellion
 bundelkhand ke saare pradesh is prakaar angreji rajya main samaa gaye
 The coronation of Bundelkhand was not a rebellion of the people but of the feudal forces and the army, in this background, cultural and religious sentiment as well as a special form of loyalty
 desh kii seemaa vastut: samanto kii jaagiron athwa rajyon kii simaayen thim
 The religion of the feudals was the religion of the people, so the occupation of the country by the rebels and the destruction of religion was unbearable, which was practiced by both Hindus and Muslims under the pretext of bullet fat
 kalyaan singh kudra ne jhansi kii rani lakshmibai kii vir gaatha karte hue likhaa he - chalat tamancha teg kirch karaal jahaan guraj gumaani girai gaaj ke samaan
 Here there is a center, there is a strength, and there is nothing, but there is a match
 
 Where one is killed, one is in the body, one is left and one has to leave the sun
 tahaan bai ne savai angarej so bhanjai, tahaan rani maradaani jhukzaari kiravaan
 
 kavi ne rani kii veerta kaa parichay dete hue kaha he ki rani kis prakaar veertapurvak shatru kaa saamana karte hue veergati ko praapt hoti he
 The boundaries of Bundelkhand were very wide till the time of Chhatrasal, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Banda in Uttar Pradesh, Sagar, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Mandla and Madhya Pradesh's Shivpuri, Katera, Pichor, Kolaras, Bhind, The districts and parganas of Lahar and Mander were included
 is pur bhubhag kaa kshetrafal lagbhag 3000 vargamil tha
 Before coming to the English state, Bundelkhand had many jagirs and small states
 bundelkhand kamishnari kaa nirmaan san 1820 main hua
 In 1835, the districts of Jalaun, Hamirpur, Banda were merged with the districts of Uttar Pradesh and Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, which was looked after by Agra
 san 1839 main sagar or damoh jile ko milakar ek kamishnari bana di gai jisaki dekharekh jhansi se hoti thi
 a few days later, the commissioner's office moved from Jhansi to Naugaon
 san 1842 main sagar, damoh jilon main angrejon ke khilaaf bahut bad aandolan hua parantu foot daalane kii niti ke dwaara shaanti sthapit kii gai
 After this, the history of Bundelkhand is an expression of the policies of the British Empire
 anek shaheedon ne samay samay par swatantraaa ke aandolan chede parantu gandi ji jaise netaa ke aane se pehle kuch thos uplabdhi sambhav na hui
 The history of Bundelkhand is full of variations from beginning to end, but there is a healthy tradition of cultural and religious unity here

 adhikrut website Non-violence and vegetarianism have special importance in human life
 ahimsa ek shravak ke liye anuvrat dharm he baheen duusari ore muniyon ke liye mahavrath he
 Man becomes a participant in micro-violence in daily life practice, but the practice of a monk is non-violent
 jain aacharyon, muniyon tathaa kuch shravakon main hi purn aacharan kii shuddhita paayi jaati he, jinaki kerani tathaa kathani ek hoti he
 If we have to develop character, then of course, we have to bring uniformity in mind
 ahimsanuvrat : ratnakarandak shravakachar main acharya samantabhadra swami ne ahimsanuvrat ke bare main likhaa he ki man se, vachan se tathaa kaay se jaanboojhkar hinsa na to karnaa, na karwaanaa or na kiye jane kaa anumodan / samarthan karnaa ahimsanuvrat kaa paripaalan he
 These five nonviolent trespasses are limb piercing, ligament, soreness, overloading and stopping diet
 ahimsa jain dharm kaa aadhaar stambh he
 In Jainism, there is a feeling of welfare of mere animals
 jain dharm main manushya, pashu-pakshi, keede–makode ke alaava prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu or vanaspati main bhi jeev mana gaya he
 According to Jainism, not killing these creatures is non-violence
 jain darshinicon ne us kriya ko hinsa kaha he jo pramaad athwa kashaipurvak hoti he
 Violence is of two types: emotional violence and liquid violence
 bhav hinsa kaa sambandh kashay se he
 Matter violence arises from emotion violence and emotion produces violence
 ek vyakti aisa he jo keval vadh kii bhaavana karata he; doosraa bhaavana ke saath vadh karata he; or teesraa vyakti bina bhaavana ke hi vadh kar detaa he, at: in teenon hi hinsa main asamanta he
 Dr
 Mohan Lal Mehta has written that violence constitutes the following four forms of non-violence: 1
 The violence which is both emotional and also physical, we shall call such violence complete violence
 2
 jo hinsa keval bhavarup he, aisi hinsa kisi ansh main apurna hoti he
 It can also be called imperfect non-violence
 3
 jo hinsa keval dravyarup he, aisi hinsa ko apurna ahimsa athwa apurna hinsa kaha ja saktaa he
 It involves only death
 4
 jahaan na bhavarup hinsa hain dravyarup hinsa, aisi sthati kaa naam purna ahimsa he
 There is neither a propitious tendency nor death
 khan paan kaa asar hamaare jivan or vyavhaar par bahut zyada padataa he
 Man is naturally a vegetarian creature but modern lifestyle has made him omnivorous
 at: aatm chintan tathaa swa moolyankan kii aavashyaktaa he isse anek samasyaon kaa swat: samaadhaan ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, we should not participate in blind competitive race, but work in our own discretion
 kaha bhi gaya he ki : jaisaa khaaoge ann, vaisaa hoga man
 Ahimsa has been called conduct because all beings in the world want to live, no one wants to die
 jis prakaar sabhi ko sukh priy he or dukh priy nahin he isaliye kisi ko bhi hinsa nahin kerani chaiye
 The importance of non-violence has been told in all religions, but in the name of religion, riots, violence and violent activities take place all over the world
 iske peeche kaa pramukh kaaran dharmik kattarta, dharmik unmaad, sahishnutaa tathaa bhaichaare kii kami he
 Therefore, an effort should be made to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony through religious tolerance and dialogue
 jain dharm kii drushti se hinsa ek kashay he jo kashay se utpann hoti he or kashay ko utpann bhi karti he
 While non-violence is neither the cause of suffering nor the act of suffering
 at: ahimsa aacharniya he
 Principles of Jainism: Aphorism and Syedism teach us about the religion of all religions, whereas the principle of Lord Mahavira "live and let live" shows the way for the welfare of all living beings
 baheen “parasparopgraho jeevanaam” kaa siddhant sabhi jeevon par upkaar karte huye, bhalaai kaa kaary karte huye jivan jeene kii prerana detaa he
 In conclusion, i want to say that today the world needs to adopt the principles of Lord Mahavira because for world welfare, non-violence is the only solution for world peace
 ahimsa parmo dharm kii jai
 a person should remain sattvic and behave in his life
 iske alaava khan paan main purna shaakaahaar kaa paalan karnaa chaiye
 In this way, there will be superiority and prosperity in life
 prakruti kaa sangrakshan hoga
 It is in the interest of all living beings, there is no harm in it, that is why it is a modern superior lifestyle
 ise apanaakar maanav apni shreshthata savit kar saktaa he

 Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic arithmetic in which the count starts at 1 after reaching an integer
 ise kabhi-kabhi ghadi kaa ganit bhi kehete hai
 In this field, the Swiss mathematician Eiler did a remarkable job
 iske baad karl fredrick gouse ne isko or aage badhaayaa
 One small use of modulo mathematics is during clock time
 abhi subah ke 8 baje hai ; ab se 7 ghante baad 8 + 7 = 15 bajnaa chahie jise ham 3 bajnaa kehete hai
 
 arthath modulo 12 ke liye 15 or 3 dono samaan hai
 Two whole numbers a and b are said to be the remainder of the modulus n, when a - b is divisible by n
 isko nimnlikhit prakaar se likhte hai : n is called modulus of equilibrium
 udhaaharan ke liye Because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12
 rinatmak purnankon ke liye bhi yahi niyam he- The properties of equilibrium are similar to the properties of equations
 yadi a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b or c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } d, tab a+c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b+d or ac ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } bd 
 If f is a polynomial function of x, where x is a multiple of integers and a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b, then f ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} f, but if ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} ac, then It is not necessary that b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c, eg 1 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 6, but 1 and 3 are not equivalent to
 ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } ac se jo uchit fal nikaala ja saktaa he, vah keval yahi he ki samsheshtha kii is ankan paddati kaa ek bada laabh yah he ki isaki sahaayta se sankhya siddhant ke bahut se falon ko sundar dhang se nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 The aggregate and truncated residuals have a set-equilibrium relationship equivalence relation
 iskaa arth he ki nimnakit sambandh satya he : a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} a; a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b kaa arth b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } a he
 a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b, b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c means a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c
 isliye samsheshtha sambandh purnaakon ke samucchy ko atulyata ke virgon main is prakaar baantata he ki ek varg ke prayek do purnank maapak m ke prati samshesh hai or bhinn bhinn virgon ke do purnank maapak m ke prati samshesh nahin hai
 If one integer is taken from each of the m squares, then one set of whole residues per modulus m will be obtained
 is prakaar -3, 3, 2, 12, 14, 20, -6 mapank 7 ke prati sampurna avasheshon kaa samucchy he
 The set of simple residuals to modulus m is 0, 1, 2, 3 


 m-1, and the absolute minimum is the following set of absolute residuals: 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 2, xxrep 6 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } / 2, jab m visham he And 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 2, xxrep 4 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} / 2, when m is even isi prakaar yadi m ke prati abhajya purnankon kaa samucchy liya jaae, to ve f tulyata ke aise virgon main bant sakate hai ki kisi ek varg kii prayek 2 sankhyaayein mapank m ke prati samshesh hongi or bhinn bhinn virgon kii koi 2 sankhyaayein mapank m ke prati samshesh nahin hai
 As before, if a number is taken from each square, a set of residuals reduced to the modulus m is obtained
 m = 12 ke liye is prakaar kaa ek samucchy 1, 5, 7, 11 he
 It is worth remembering that if the set of components of the entire residue of modulus m is multiplied by a prime number r relative to m, then a second set of whole residues per modulus m is obtained
 isi prakaar yadi mapank m ke prati laghukrit avasheshon ke samucchy ke sabhi avyavon ko m ke saapeksh kisi abhajya sankhya m se guna kiya jaae, to mapank m ke prati laghukrit avasheshon kaa ek doosraa varg praapt hoga
 It follows from the following Eiler Ferm theorem: rf ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 1, yadi = 1 Veer Kunwar Singh University is a university located in Ara, Bihar

 Important Principles of Parliamentary Democracy 1
 The head of state is not just head of government but only constitutional head
 2
 vaastavik karypalika shakti, mantriparishad jo ki samuhik rup se sansad ke nichle sadan ke saamne uttaradaayi hoga, ke paas hogi
 3
 Members of the Council of Ministers will be drawn from members of Parliament
 1
 pradhanmantri ke pad par aate hi yah parishad gathit ho jaati he
 It is not necessary that some other ministers take oath along with the Prime Minister
 keval pradhanmantri hi mantriparishad hoga
 There was no restriction on the number of members of the Council of Ministers in the original constitution, but by the 91st amendment, the number of Council of Ministers was limited to 15% of the number of members of the Lok Sabha, even in the states, the number of Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15% of the Assembly but There will be a minimum of 12 ministers

 The President appoints Minister Gana on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he, cabinet ke kaary kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he, desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he, sabhi nitigat nirnay vahi letaa he, raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhya sampark sutara bhi vahi he, parishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he, parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he, sansad main parishad ke paksh main ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes main vah bhaag le saktaa he, mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he tathaa vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna mangava saktaa he
 Due to all these reasons, the Prime Minister is considered the most important political personality of the country
 pradhanmantri sarkaar ke prakaar The Prime Minister is the type of parliamentary government in which the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers
 He affects the decision making ability of the cabinet
 He is more powerful than the cabinet
 His decisions are the decisions of the cabinet
 The general policies of the country are not determined by the cabinet
 The Prime Minister would do this with the help of his close aide even if he is not a member of the Council of Ministers
 Land such as Indira Gandhi was assisted by his kitchen cabinet pradhanmantri sarkaar ke laabh There is some loss cabinet sarkaar It is the same type of parliamentary government, in which the policy decision is taken collectively by the cabinet, in which the Prime Minister does not dominate the cabinet, its decisions are generally balanced but sometimes they are such which are not vague and bold
 1989 ke baad desh main pradhanmantri prakaar kaa nahin balki cabinet prakaar kaa shashan rahaa he
 Prime Minister's functions 1- mantriparishad ke gathan kaa kaary 2- Chief ruler 3- niti nirmaataa 4- Leader of Parliament 5- videsh niti kaa nirdharak After the majority is over, when the Council of Ministers resigns, then the executive government comes into existence or in the event of death / resignation of the Prime Minister
 yah sarkaar antarim prakruti kii hoti he
 It remains established until the new Council of Ministers takes oath
 yah isliye kaam karti he taaki anuchhed 74 ke anuroop ek mantriparishad raashtrapati kii sahaayta hetu rahe
 In VN Rao v Union of India, the Supreme Court held that the Council of Ministers should always be present
 yadi yah anupasthit hui to raashtrapati apane kaam swany karne lagegaa, jisase sarkaar kaa rup badal kar raashtrapati ho jaayegaa, jo ki samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ke khilaaf hoga
 This executive government cannot take any financial / policy decision as the Lok Sabha is not present at that time
 vah keval desh kaa dainik prashasan chalaati he
 The most dire situation came before such a government when Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government had to conduct the Kargil War in 1999
 kintu vikat dasha main is prakaar kii sarkaar bhi koi bhi nitigat nirnay le sakati he
 In a parliamentary government, these traditions are considered to be legally applicable to all organs of the government
 unka varnan karne ke liye koi vidhaan nahin hota he naa hi samvidhan main kisi desh ke shashan ke bare main purna varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Constitutional framers cannot predict the future development and their impact on the governance of the country
 atah ve unke sambandh main samvidhan main praavdhaan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 In this way the constitution is a living body but not a complete description
 is varnan main bina sanshodhan laaye parivartan bhi nahin ho saktaa he
 The same traditions are not statutory like the provisions of the Constitution, they act as lubricants in the running of the government and are helpful in the effective running of the government
 panrparaaye is liye palit kii jaati hai kyonki unke abhaav main rajnatik kathinaaiya aa sakati hai
 That is why they are considered complementary to the constitution
 britain main ham inkaa sabase viksit tathaa prabhaavshaalee rup dekh sakate hai
 There are two types of these: - sarkaar ke sansadeey tathaa raashtrapati prakaar Arguments in support of parliamentary rule 1
 In President's rule, the President is the actual working council who is elected by the public for a certain period of time, he is also responsible to the legislature, his ministers are also not members of the legislature and are responsible for the same
 Not in the same parliamentary rule, power is vested with the Council of Ministers which is responsible to the legislature
 is 2
 bharat kii vividhta ko dekhte hue sansadeey shashan zyada upyogi he is main desh ke sabhi virgon ke log mantri parishad main liye ja sakate he 3
 There is less chance of conflict in this regime because ministers are also members of legislature 4 bharat jaise vividhta purna desh main sarvamaanya rup se raashtrapati kaa chunaav karnaa lagbhag asambhav he 5 Minte Marley Reforms Since 1909, the people of India have been introduced to parliamentary rule

 Normally, a person can develop HSV-2 infection during sexual activity only when he has contact with a person who is suffering from vaginal HSV-2
 yah kisi aise vyakti se bhi ho saktaa he jo sankraman se prabhavit ho or usamen koi dard na ho
 Also, he may not know that he is suffering from infection
 echesavi-2 se peedit adhikansh vyaktiyon ko apane sankraman kii jaankaree hi nahin hoti he
 The first outbreak occurs after 2 weeks of virus transmission and the signs are visible
 ve vicitra rup main do se chaar saptaah main thik ho jate hai lekin jananaang yaa guda main yaa uske aasapaas ek yaa do fafole rah jate hai
 The blisters burst and remain soft pimples that take two to four weeks to heal
 aisa pehali baar hota he
 Oddly, the second disease may appear spreading, which appears several weeks or months after the first disease, but is less severe and of shorter duration than before
 bhale hi sankraman sharir main lambii avadhi ke liye bana rahe kintu kuch varshon kii avadhi ke dauraan failane vaale rogon main kami aa jaati he
 Other signs and symptoms are similar to those of flu, including fever and swollen glands
 aisa koi ilaaj nahin he jisase ki twachaa rog kaa upachaar kiya ja sake, kintu anti virus davaaiyon ke prayog se dawaai prayog kii avadhi ke dauraan ise failane se roka ja saktaa he
 Additionally, by taking preventive measures daily, the partner can be protected from symptomatic skin disease

 Dr
 Awasthi's work is multi-faceted, but the publication and fame of his talent has been mainly due to poetic literature
 atah unki kavita kii sankshipt charchaa karnaa apekshit he
 His poetic literature can be divided into four sections- 1
 geet-anugit 2
 Management of poetry and long compositions 3
 vyangy rachanaayen 4
 Child poems da0 mohan avasthi ne geeton kii rachana tab se prarambh kar di thi, jab ve hai skool ke vidhyaarthee the
 Since 1950, his poems were being published in magazines like 'saraswati'
 da0 avasthi ke geeton kaa ‘sheershak’ insaan hi he- paapi ke bheetar bhi he yadi punya nihit, to yah bhi meri kavita kaa abhiyaan banegaa
 My poem on land or in heaven, the title of my poem will become human
 da0 mohan avasthi ke geet maanav jivan kii samast samvednaa, pidaa evam darshan ko samete hue hai- baat mujhase karo tum na us maut kii shakl jisane abhi tak dikhaai nahin harsh main, shok main, raag me, dwesh main aadmi ke kabhi kaam aayi nahin
 Dr
 Awasthi is the promoter of 'anguita' method
 unhone 29 april 1973 ko dainik ‘deshdoot’ elahabaad main prakashit ek anugit ke dwaara is vidh kaa pravartan kiya, jise ‘dhrmayug’ main chape anugit se ek dhra ke rup main pratishtha mili
 His follow-up collection 'wings of Stir' remains a topic of discussion among litterateurs at this time
 unke anugit jivan kii vividhta ko roopayit karte hai
 Desperate from human grief, we fall prey to despair and frustration, but Awasthi ji thinks that grief is the spice of life, the taste, the foundation of humanity - long silence is a peace of peace, there is no way of sadness but who is dense? Whom talking to whom made sorrow a spice of life
 da0 avasthi kaa khand-kavy ‘abhishpt maharathi’ or lambi kavitaayen- apana khoyaa gaan, badha aaj vigyaan, mat aaj swarg ke geet sunaao mujhako aadi atyadhk prasiddh hai
 His satirical compositions - Guest's Mara, Interview, Flood, God save me from the house loop, i am calling in the court, in the midst of emergency and the poet is the chief of the conference
 unki vyangy rachanaaon main samaaj or jivan kaa sach utraa he- ghusaa jab kachhari main kankad ne terra, rakho ek rupaya yahan, haq he meraa
 The people, the rooms, the circle of people come, give me my right, give me my right
 lute aath-das-bees rupee udhar hi, jidhar hoke meraa laga ek pheraa
 
 maran hetu machhar masahari main aata, shalab jwaal maala sunahari main aata
 The river comes deep in the middle of Ghar Dhar, and the climate is urban
 magar aadmi kii jo shamat he aati, to wo daudkar he kachhari main aata
 
 - Critics and scholars did not give importance to Hindi children's literature as expected
 bal sahitya kii rachana praudh rachanaakaar hi kar saktaa he
 Dr
 Mohan Awasthi has composed many ballads and many of his poetry collections have also been published
 da0 avasthi ‘kala kala ke liye’ nahin apitu ‘kala jivan ke liye’ ke himachati hai
 He has written enough child literature
 ‘chaabidaar khilone’ geet main unhone batalaaya he ki sansar ke sabhi jeev us param saÿ ke chaabidaar khilone hai- hathi ghoda oont aadmi chidiyaan yaa mrigagaune, sabhi jeev hai, us ishwar ke chaabidaar khilone
 The golden sun fields are two of its golden balloons, how lovely are the games of God
 da0 avasthi pragativaad ke baad ke shreshth rachanakaaron main se ek hai
 He has devoted himself to poetry with full devotion and faith, being disenchanted with all kinds of literary factions, promises and slogans and unaffected by the Maithuni poems of various promises contemporary to the new poem
 unki kavita kaa ek hi saadhy he ki aadmi paara-paara na ho- Body, soul, soul, mind, consciousness, skill, skill, form, art form, it becomes a coordinated man, remember that it should not be mercury
