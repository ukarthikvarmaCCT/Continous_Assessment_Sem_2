 The circulatory system or vasosphere is the set of organs that carry the transport of nutrients between the cells of the body
 isse rogon se sharir kii raksha hoti he tathaa sharir kaa taap evam ph sthir bana rahata he
 Amino acids, electrolytes, gases, hormones, blood cells and nitrogen waste products etc
 are transported by the circulatory system

 The main aorta arises from the heart, which, at the end of the abdomen passing through the chest, divides into two final branches
 mahadhamani se shakhaayen nikalakar angon main chali jaati hai
 As the branches grow, their size gets smaller
 ye chote akaarwali dhamnikaaye kehalaati hai
 The proximal branches of the arteries merge with each other, so that if the path of one is cut off or stops due to disease, then it reaches blood from the other artery to the expansion area
 isko shakhamilan kehete hai
 There are two main arteries arising from the heart, the pleura and the aorta
 phupfusi dhamni daahine nilay se nikalne ke pashchaat do shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati he or prayek phuffus main ek ek shakha chali jaati he
 The purpose of this artery is to transport the blood to the lungs to take oxygen

 The arteries carry the purified blood from the heart and end up in the microscopic cells in the organs, by which the organs receive nutrition and oxygen from the blood
 in keshikaon se shirayen prarambh hoti hai, jinke dwaara poshan or oxigen se rahit rudhir se grahan kar lete hai
 The veins begin from these capillaries, through which a bloodless body without nutrition and oxygen returns to the heart

 Concave veins always remain along the arteries and are therefore located deep, with a small or medium size often with one vein on either side, but only one vein with large arteries
 donon shirayen jahaan tahaan choti choti shakhaon dwaara aapas main jud jaati hai
 Veins all over the body have the same name as the arteries with which they reside

 But this script is very sad
 isaki pramanikta ke prati bhi andeh he tathaa yah bhi gyaat nahin ki sinhalai 'sanne' se isane kahan tak apana rup grahan kiya he
 Probably this epic was composed in 25 Sargo and the story was concluded with the coronation of Rama - it is estimated from the great verses quoted in 'sonne'
 at: iskaa kathanak bahut kuch 'bhattikavy' ke jaisaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Its narrative from the cantagram is as follows: shesh sargo main ayodhya aagaman tathaa rajyabhishek varnit rahaa hoga
 It is known from the interpretation of the last verses that the name of the author of this epic was 'kumaradas', also known as Kumarabhatta or Kumar
 ye sinhaladweep ke raja the
 His father's name was Kumaramani
 kumaardaas kii khyaati bharatvarsh main paryaapt thi
 Jalahan has quoted several verses of 'janakiharan' in his Suktimuktavali

 inke do maatulon - shri megh or agrabodhi - ne inkaa paalan poshan kiya
 The poet has remembered those poems with great gratitude at the end of this poem
 ye kumaardaas sinhaladweep ke itihaasangranth mahavansh main varnit maudgalyayan ke putr kumaar dhatusen se bhinn the
 Legend has it that Mahakavi Kalidas, an admirer of his poetry 'janakiharan', was called Saprem Sinhaldwip by Kumardas
 vahaan jaakar kalidas durbhagyavash ek sundari ke premjaal main fasakar maar daale gaye
 King Kumaradas, disgusted by this heinous murder of his guest and friend, also burnt himself on the same pyre
 aaj bhi lanka ke dakshin praant main kalidas kaa samadhisthan vidyaman he
 From Rajashekhar's foregoing statement, it leads to the conclusion that Kumaradas must have been after Kalidasa
 unki rachana par raghuvansh or kumarasambhav kaa atyadhik prabhaav bhi dikhaai padataa he
 In spite of the excessive urge towards Yamak, the rituals and prasad qualities of this poem have their own specialties

 The Mahar Regiment is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army

 The Mahar Scouts and their forces were recruited by the Maratha king Shivaji as soldiers in the fort

 The Bombay Army favored the Mahar soldiers for their bravery and loyalty to the flag and also because they could be trusted during the anglo-maratha War
 ve kai safaltaaon hasil kii he, koregaanv kii ladaai, jahaan mahaar bahul company sainikon ko ek bahut bada peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main parajeet main bhi shaamil he
 The battle was celebrated by an obelisk, the Koregaon Pillar, which went on to raid the summit of the Mahar Regiment until Indian independence

 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon ke liye antim jhatka, 1892 main aayaa jab yah "varg regimenton" santhaan ko bhartiya sena main nirnay liya gaya
 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 About 16,500 years ago, Himanias started melting and they entered North America
 lagbhag usee samay ke aasapaas beringia bhi pani main doobane laga or aaj se qareeb 6,000 varsh pehle tak taton ke rup vaise ho gaye jaise ki aadhunik yug main dekhe jate hai
 Berinjia was about 4,000 km long and 1,600 km wide
 yah aadhunik siberia kii lenaa nadi se lekar canada kii maikenzi nadi tak pahunchataa tha
 Its area was so large that according to some geologists it was less of a ground bridge and more of a subcontinent
 maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean
 in beringian logon kaa jivan yaqinan kathin tha kyonki yah ek atyant sard ilaaka tha
 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery

 bahurat naam ke pehle nihnav ke sansthaapak kshatriyakund gram ke nivasee swayan bhagwaan mahavir ke damaad jamaali the; mahavir ko kevalgyaan hone ke 14 varsh pashchaat shravasti main inaki utpatti hui maani jaati he
 Jamali believed that it takes a lot of time to complete a work, it is not complete at one time, so the creation cannot be created
 mahavir kii putree priyadarshana ne pehle to apane pati ke paksh kaa samarthan kiya lekin baad main vah mahavir kii shishyaa ban gai
 Two years later, Tishagupta, a disciple of Acharya Basu, raised a soul dispute in the Rajgriha
 mahavir ke matanusaar aatma sharir ke samast parmaanuon main vyaapt he, lekin tishyagupt kaa kahana tha ki jeev kaa koi ek yaa do pradesh jeev nahin kaha ja saktaa, kisi antim pradesh ko hi jeev kahana chahie
 This is another infidel named Jeeva Pradesh

 This is called the third Nihnava named Avyaktism

 Then, after 544 years of mahavira-nirvana, Rohgupta, a disciple of Shreegupta, accepted the jiva-rashi separately, rendering Triassism in Antranjia
 kuch log mankhali goshaal ko is mat kaa anuyaayi sweekaar karte hai, or kuch vaisheshik darshan ko trirashivaad kaa ang maanate hai
 This is the sixth child

 mahavir bhagwaan ke pashchaat jain sthaviron kii panrapara se pataa lagata he ki acharya bhadrabahu ke samay tak digambar or shwetambar parampara main vishesh matbhed nahin tha
 Around the first century of the year AD, both these traditions were joined

 Just as the Chaityavasi or monastic is called 'jati' or 'sripujya' in the White Legends and the Vanvasi is called 'svegi', similarly the Digbaras' kilns should consider the monastic and naked monks as remnants of the Vanvasi branch, though there is a point to be kept in mind
 That, like the Shvetambara sect, there is no mention of any separate organization named Chaityavasi in the Digambara sect
 maaloom hota he, chaityavasi yaa mathvaasi ho jane par bhi digambar sadhu praaia: nagn hi rahete the, lekin aage chalakar unamem vastra dhaaran kane kii pravriti chal padi
 Shrutasagar, a 16th century scholar of Vikram, has written that in Kalikala, Mlechha etc

 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for The agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style given way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India

 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell
