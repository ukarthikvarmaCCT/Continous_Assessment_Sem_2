 Between 1983 and 1989, NT Rama Rao served as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
 During his tenure, he spent large sums to erect several statues of people from the region's political and religious history
 During his visit to New York, he saw the Statue of Liberty and was inspired by the efforts to restore it
 He said "I wanted something like that 


 That would have been my contribution to society
" Rama Rao chose to depict Gautama Buddha because "he was a humanitarian who told the whole truth to the people
 It is our pride
" After a long search, he found a solid white granite rock near Raigiri, Bhongir on a mountainside 46 km outside Hyderabad
 In October 1985 NTR inaugurated work on structure
 For over a year, hundreds of labourers helped the temple architect and builder s
m
ganapathi Sthapati create the statue
 After five years and the expenditure of US$3 million, the statue stood at 58 feet and weighed 350 tons, making it the world's tallest monolithic statue of the Buddha
 a concrete platform measuring 15 feet, now referred to as the "rock of Gibraltar," was constructed in the middle of Hussain Sagar to aid in erecting the statue
 The roads of the city were also widened for this purpose
 This statue is located at Lumbini Park in the Hussain Sagar Island can be reached by boat in 15 minutes
 Then government of Andhra Pradesh led by N
 T
 Rama Rao was ousted in 1989
 By the next year, the statue was ready for erection
 ABC Limited, a local company, was given the responsibility of transferring the statue onto the concrete platform
 Using a trailer vehicle, the statue was brought to the shore of Hussain Sagar
 On 10 March 1990, company workers shifted the statue on top of a barge
 After traveling only 100 gaz, the statue tipped and fell into the lake
 The accident killed 10 people
 After a two-year salvage operation, the statue was pulled out of the lake
 On 1 December 1992, the statue was installed on the platform successfully
 In 2006, the Dalai Lama consecrated the statue after performing a ritual

 vyavsaay evam sanghathan ke sandarbh main prabandhan kaa arth he - uplabdh sansadhano kaa dakshatapurvak tathaa prabhaavapurn tareeke se upyog karte hue logon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa taaki lakshyon kii prapti sunishchit kii ja sake
 Management includes organizing, organization-building, staffing, leadership, and controlling the organization or initiative
 sanghathan bhale hi bada ho yaa chota, laabh ke liye ho athwa gaiyr-laabh vaala, seva pradaan karata ho athwa vinirmaankarta, prabandh sabhi keliye aavashyak he
 Management is necessary so that individuals can make their best contribution towards the accomplishment of collective objectives
 prabandh main parsparik rup se sambandhit vah kaary sammilit hai jinhen sabhi prabandhak karte hai
 Managers spend different time on different tasks
 sanghathan ke ucchstar par baithe prabandhak niyojan evam sanghathan par neeche str ke prabandhakon kii tulana main adhik samay lagaate hai
 Many authors have given the definition of management
 prabandh shabd ek bahuprachlit shabd he jise sabhi prakaar kii kriyaaon ke liye vyapak rup se prayukt kiya gaya he
 By the way, it is mainly used for various activities of any enterprise
 uparokt udhaaharan evam vastusthiti ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho gaya hoga ki prabandh vah kriya he jo har us sanghathan main aavashyak he jisamen log samooh ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 People do different types of tasks in the organization but they still work to achieve the same purpose
 prabandh logon ke prayatnon evam samaan uddeshy ko praapt karne main disha pradaan karata he
 In this way, the management sees that the tasks are completed and the targets are achieved, at least at the least cost and minimum cost
 atah prabandh ko paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se praapt karne ke uddeshy se kaaryon ko puraa karaane kii prakriya he
 We need to analyze this definition
 kuch shabd aise hai jinka vistaar se varnan karnaa aavashyak he
 These words are- paribhaasha main prayukt prakriya se abhipraay he praathmik kaary athwa kriyaayein jinhen prabandh kaaryon ko puraa karaane ke liye karata he
 These tasks are - planning, organization, appointment, direction and control which will be discussed further in this chapter and in the book
 prabhavi athwa kaary ko prabhavi dhang se karne kaa vastav main abhipraayah die gaye kaary ko sampann karnaa he
 Effective management is about doing the right thing, completing actions and achieving objectives
 duusare shabdon main, iskaa kaary antim parinaam praapt karnaa he
 But just completing the work is not enough, there is another aspect of it and that is efficiency ie doing the work efficiently
 kushalta kaa arth he kaary ko sahi dhang se nunatam laagat par karnaa
 There is a kind of cost-benefit analysis and the relation between input and output
 yadi kam sadhano kaa upyog kar adhik laabh praapt karte hai to ham kahenge ki kshamta main vruddhi hui he
 Efficiency will be increased if less resources are used for the same benefit or output and less cost is incurred
 aagat saadhan ve hai jo kisi kaary vishesh ko karne ke liye aavashyak dhan, maal upkaran evam maanav sansaadhan hon
 Naturally, management is related to the efficient use of these resources because they reduce costs and in the end they increase profits
 yah donon shabd alag-alag hote hue bhi ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 It is important to have both effective and efficient management
 prabhaavapurntaa evam kaushal donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 But balance between these two sides is necessary and sometimes management has to compromise efficiency
 udhaaharan ke liye prabhaavapurn hona evam kushalta kii andekhi karnaa saral he jiskaa arth he kaary ko puraa karnaa lekin unchi laagat par
 For example, suppose a company aims to produce 8,000 units in a year
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye adhikansh samay bijli na milane par prabandhak prabhavotpadak to tha lekin kshamtawan nahin tha kyonki, usee nirgat ke liye adhik aagat kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Sometimes business focuses more on the production of goods with less resources, ie reduced the cost but failed to produce the scheduled production
 parinamswaroop maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya isliye isaki maang kam ho gai tathaa iskaa sthaan pratiyogiyon ne le liya
 This is a situation of lack of efficiency but effectiveness as the goods did not reach the market
 isliye nunatam laagat par prabandhak liye lakshyon ko praapt karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he
 For this, balance has to be made in effectiveness and efficiency
 saadharantaya ucch kaary kushalta ke saath ucch prabhaavapurntaa hoti he jo ki sabhi prabandhakon kaa lakshya hota he
 But unduly emphasizing high work efficiency without effectiveness is also undesirable
 kamjor prabandhan prabhaavapurntaa evam kaarykushal dona kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 After studying some definitions, we get to know some elements which we call the basic features of management
 prabandh kuch uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kaary karata he
 Objectives are the expected results of any action
 inhen vyavsaay ke mul prayojan se praapt kiya janaa chahie
 Any organization has different objectives and management has to achieve all these objectives effectively and efficiently
 uddeshyon ko sanghathanaatmak uddeshy, saamaajik uddeshy evam vyaktigat uddeshyon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The management is responsible for determining and accomplishing the objectives for the organization
 ise sabhi kshetren ke anek prakaar ke uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa hota he tathaa sabhi hitarthiyon jaise-anshadhari, karmchaaree, graahak, sarkaar aadi ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 The main objective of any organization should be to utilize human and material resources for maximum possible benefit
 jiskaa taatpary he vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ko puraa karnaa
 These objectives are - to keep oneself alive, to earn profit and to grow
 kisi bhi vyavsaay kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy apane astitv ko banaae rakhana hota he
 Management should strive towards the survival of the organization
 iske liye sanghathan ko paryaapt dhan kamanaa chahie jisase ki laagton ko puraa kiya ja sake
 It is not enough for business to survive
 prabandh ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki sanghathan laabh kamaaye
 Profit serves as an important impetus for the continued successful operation of the enterprise
 laabh vyavsaay kii laagat evam jokhimon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Increasing your prospects in the long term is very important for the business
 iske liye vyavsaay kaa badhanaa bahut mahatva rakhata he
 Management should take full advantage of the potential of organization development to remain in the industry
 vyavsaay ke vikaas ko vikray aavart, karmchaariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi yaa phir utpaadon kii sankhya yaa poonji ke nivesh main vruddhi aadi ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 Creating benefits for society
 sanghathan chaahe vyavsaayik he athwa gaiyr vyavsaayik, samaaj ke ang hone ke kaaran use kuch saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 This means creating favorable economic values for different parts of society
 isamen sammilit hai- utpaadan ke paryaavaran bhinn paddati apnaanaa, samaaj ke logon se vanchit virgon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa evam karmchaariyon ke liye vidhyalay, shishugrih jaisi suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa
 The box further gives an example of an organization fulfilling a corporate social responsibility
 sanghathan un logon se milakar banataa he jinase unka vyaktitv, prishthbhumi, anubhav evam uddeshy alag-alag hote hai
 All these become part of the organization to satisfy their diverse needs
 yah pratiyogi vetan evam anya laabh jaisi vittiya aavashyaktaaon se lekar saathiyon dwaara manyata jaisi saamaajik aavashyaktaaon evam vyaktigat badhotaree evam vikaas jaisi ucch stareey aavashyaktaaon ke rup main alag-alag hoti hai
 Management has to match individual objectives with organizational objectives to align with the organization
 prabandh ek saarvbhaumik kriya he jo kisi bhi sanghathan kaa abhinn ang he
 Now we will study some of the reasons why management has become so important- prabandh itnaa hi purana he jitani kii sabhyataa
 Although the origin of modern organization is new, but organized work has been taking place since ancient times of civilization
 vastav main sanghathan ko vishisht lakshan mana ja saktaa he jo sabhy samaaj ko asabhy samaaj se alag karata he
 The early practices of management were the rules and laws that emerged from the experience of government and commercial activities
 vyapaar evam vaanijya ke vikaas se kramshah prabandh ke siddhant evam vyavhaaron kaa vikaas hua
 The word 'prabandha' is used today in many meanings which highlight various aspects of its nature
 prabandh ke adhyayan kaa vikaas beete samay main aadhunik sanghathanon ke saath-saath hua he
 It has been based on both the experience and behavior of managers and the associated set of principles
 beete samay main iskaa ek gatisheel vishay ke rup main vikaas hua he
 Which has its own special characteristics
 lekin prabandh kii prakruti se sambandhit ek prashn kaa uttar dena aavashyak he ki prabandh vigyaan he yaa kala he yaa phir donon he? iskaa uttar dene ke liye aaie vigyaan evam kala donon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen tathaa dekhen ki prabandh kahan tak inaki purti karata he
 What is art Art is the personal and efficient use of current knowledge to achieve desired results
 ise adhyayan, avlokan evam anubhav se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now, because art is concerned with personal use of knowledge, a kind of originality and creativity is required to put into practice the fundamental principles studied
 kala ke aadharbhoot lakshan is prakaar hai- Art assumes that there is some theoretical knowledge already
 visheshgyon ne apane-apane kshetron main kuch moolbhoot siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jo ek vishesh prakaar kii kala main prayukt hota he
 For example, literature on dance, public address / speech, art or music is acceptable
 is moolbhoot gyaan kaa upyog vyakti, vyakti ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 Art is, therefore, a very personal concept
 udhaaharan ke liye do nartak, do vaktaa, do kalakaar athwa do lekhakon kii apni kala ke pradarshan main bhinnata hogi
 All art is practical
 kala vartmaan siddhanton ko gyaan kaa rachanaatmak upyog he
 We know that music is based on seven notes
 lekin kisi sangeetkaar kii sangeet rachana vishisht athwa bhinn hoti he yah is baat par nirbhar karti he ki in suron kaa kis prakaar se sangeet srijan main prayog kiya gaya he, jo ki uski apni vyakhya hoti he
 Management is an art because, it fulfills the following characteristics- prabandhak ek krambaddh gyaan-samooh he kinhin saamaanya satya athwa saamaanya siddhanton ko spasht karata he vigyaan kii moolbhoot visheshtaayen nimna hai- Science is a hierarchical set of knowledge
 iske siddhant kaaran evam parinaam ke bich main sambandh aadhaarit hai
 For example, the occurrence of the apple falling from the tree to Earth gives rise to the principle of gravity
 vaigyanik siddhanton ko pehle avlokan ke madhyam se viksit kiya jaataa he or phir niyantrit paristhitiyon main baar-baar pareekshan kar uski jaanch kii jaati he
 Scientific theories are universal for validity and application
 uparyukt visheshtaon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai prabandh vigyaan ke rup main kuch visheshtaon ko dhaaran karata he- It is necessary to manage all types of organization processes
 aapane yah bhi avlokan kiya hoga ki sanghathanon ko unka prabandh karne ke liye kuch vishisht yogyataon evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You may have also noticed that on the one hand there has been an increase in the corporate form and on the other hand more emphasis is being placed on managing the business
 kya iskaa arth yah hua ki prabandh ek pesha he? is prashn kaa uttar jaanane ke liye aaie peshey kii pramukh visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen evam dekhen ki kya prabandh inako puraa karata he
 The following are the characteristics of the profession sabhi peshey bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit gyaan ke samooh par aadhaarit hote hai jise shiksha se arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 Admission to the profession is limited by examination or educational qualification
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat main yadi kisi ko chartered accountint bananaa he to use bhartiya chartered accountint santhaan dwaara yojit kii jane vaali ek vishesh pariksha ko paas karnaa hoga
 All professions are associated with one or the other councils, which regulate their entry, issue certificates to work and prepare and implement the Aadhaar Code
 bharat main vakaalat karne ke liye vakeelon ko baar council kaa sadsy bananaa hota he jo unke kaaryon kaa niyaman evam niyantran karata he
 All professions are bound by a code of conduct that gives direction to the behavior of their members
 udhaaharan ke liye jab doctor apane peshey main pravesh karte hai to vah apane kaary naitikta kii shapath lete hai
 The basic purpose of the profession is loyalty and commitment and the interests of its customers
 ek vakil yah sunishchit karata he ki uske muvakkil ko nyaay mili
 Management does not fully meet the principles of the profession
 vaise isamen kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jo nimna hai- Management is a universal term used in a group of relationships in an enterprise by people connected to each other to perform certain tasks
 prayek-vyakti kaa sambandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main kisi na kisi kaary vishesh ko puraa karne kaa uttardaayitv hota he
 In order to fulfill this responsibility, he is given some rights ie decision making authority
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv kaa yah sambandh vyaktiyon ko adhikari evam adhinsth ke rup main ek duusare ko bandhate hai
 This creates different levels in the organization
 kisi sanghathan ke adhikaar shrunkhlaa main teen str hote hai- High Level Management - These are the senior most executive officers of the organization who are called by many names
 yah saamanytah chairman, mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, mukhya prachaalan adhikari, pradhan, uppradhan aadi ke naam se jane jate hai
 High management is a team of managers of different functional levels
 unka mul kaary sanghathan ke kul uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn tatwon main ekta evam vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa he
 These high level managers are responsible for the welfare and continuity of the organization
 form ke jivan ke liye ye vyavsaay ke paryaavaran evam uske prabhaav kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They formulate the goals and armaments of the new organization for their achievement
 vyavsaay ke sabhi kaaryon evam unke samaaj par prabhaav ke liye ye hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 The task of higher management is complex and stressful
 isamen lanbaa samay lagata he to sanghathan ke prati purnapatibaddhta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Middle level management- These are the link between upper managers and lower level, they are subordinate to upper managers and heads of first linear managers
 inhen saamanytah vibhaag pramukh, parichaalan prabandhak athwa sanyantr adheekshak kehete hai
 Middle level managers are responsible for the implementation of control plans and armaments developed by higher management
 iske saath-saath ye pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke sabhi kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Their main task is to complete the plans prepared by the higher level managers
 iske liye Supervisory or Operations Manager - Foremen and supervisors come at the lower level in the authority line of the organization
 paryvekshak kaarybal ke kaaryon kaa pratyaksh rup se avlokan karte hai
 Their rights and duties are determined by schemes made by higher managers
 paryvekshan, prabandhakon kii sanghathan main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he kyonki yah sidhe vaastavik kaary bal se samvaad karte hai evam madhya stareey prabandhakon ke dishanirdeshon ko karmchaariyon tak pahunchaate hai
 By these efforts, the quality of the product is maintained, the loss of goods is kept to a minimum and the level of safety is maintained
 kaarigari kii gunvattta, evam utpaadan kii maatr karmchaariyon ke parishram, anushaasan evam swamibhakti par nirbhar karti he
 Management is considered as the process of planning, organization, direction and control of tasks from members to the organization and the use of resources of the organization for achieving the set objectives
 yah pehle se hi yah nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary he ki kya karnaa he, kis prakaar tathaa kisko karnaa he
 This means setting objectives in advance and setting a path to achieve them efficiently and effectively
 suhasini ke sanghathan kaa uddeshy he paramparaagat bhartiya hathkargha evam hastshilp kii vastuon ko kharidkar unhen bechnaa
 He sells woven garments, decoration items, garments and household articles made from traditional Indian clothes
 suhasini inaki maatr, inke vibhinn prakaar, rang evam banaavat ke sambandh main nirnay leti he phir vibhinn aapurtikartaaon se unke kray athwa unke ghar main taiyaar karaane par sansadhano kaa aavanton karti he
 No one can prevent planning problems from occurring, but they can be anticipated and they can form contingency plans whenever they arise
 yah nirdhaarit yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye kaary saunpane, kaaryon ko samoohon main baantne, adhikaar nishchit karne evam sansadhano ke aavanton ke kaary kaa prabandhan karata he
 Once a specific plan is prepared to meet the objectives of the organization, then the organization will examine the actions and resources necessary for the implementation of the plan
 yah aavashyak kaaryon evam sansadhano kaa nirdhaaran karegaa
 It decides who will do what work, where it will be done and when
 sanghathan main aavashyak kaaryon ko prabandh ke yogya vibhaag evam kaary ikaiyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he evam sanghathan kii adhikaar shrunkhlaa main adhikaar evam vivaran dene ke sambandhon kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Appropriate techniques of organization help in completion of work and promotion of operational efficiency and effectiveness completion of results
 vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon ko kaary kii prakruti ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn dhaanchon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You will read more about this in further chapters
 saral shabdon main iskaa arth he sahi kaary ke liye uchit vyakti ko foondnaa
 An important aspect of management is to ensure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right place and time to achieve the objectives of the organization
 ise maanav sansaadhan kaary bhi kehete hai tathaa isamen karmchaariyon kii bhartee, chayan, kaary par niyukti evam prashikshan sammilit hai
 Infosys Technology, which develops software, requires system analysts and programmers, while Labmart requires a team of designers and craftspeople
 nideshan kaa kaary karmchaariyon ko netritv pradaan karnaa, prabhavit karnaa evam abhiprerit karnaa he jisase ki vah supurd kaary ko puraa kar saken
 This requires creating an environment that inspires employees to function optimally
 abhiprerana evam netritv-nirdesan ke do mul tatv hai
 Motivating employees simply means creating an environment that motivates them to work
 netritv kaa arth he dusron ko is prakaar se prabhavit karnaa, ki vah apane netaa ke icchit kaary sampann karen
 a good manager, with the help of praise and criticism, directs in such a way that employees can contribute their best
 suhasini ke dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii chaadaron ke liye silk par bhadkile rangon ke chaape viksit kiye
 Although it looked very attractive, but due to the use of silk, it was very expensive for the common man
 unke kaary kii prashansa karte hue suhasini ne unhen suzav diya ki in silk kii chaadaron ko vah deepawali, christmas jaise vishesh avasaron ke liye sahej kar rakhen tathaa unhen niyamit rup se sooti vastren par chhaapen
 Control is defined as the act of managing in which it directs the execution of organization work to achieve the goals of the organization
 niyantran kaary main nishpaadan ke str nirdhaarit kiye jate hai, vartmaan nishpaadan ko mapa jaataa he
 It is matched to predefined levels and corrective steps are taken in the event of deviation
 iske liye prabandhakon ko yah nirdhaarit karnaa hoga ki safalataa ke liye kya kaary evam utpaadan mahatvapurn hai, uskaa kaise or kahan maapan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sudharatmak kadam uthaane ke liye koun adhikrut he
 When Suhasini found that his team of designers made a bed sheet that was more expensive than the fixed price for his sale, he changed the cloth for the sheet to control costs
 prabandhak ke vibhinn kaaryon par saadharantaya uparokt kram main hi charchaa kii jaati he jiske anusaar ek prabandhak pehle yojana taiyaar karata he; phir sanghathan banaata he; tatpashchaat nirdesan karata he; or ant main niyantran karata he
 In fact the manager rarely performs these tasks one by one
 prabandhak ke kaary ek duusare se jude hai tathaa yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he koun-sa kaary kahan samaapt hua tathaa koun-sa kaary kahan se prarambh hua
 In the process of managing an organization, a manager has to perform five tasks related to each other
 sanghathan ek aisi paddati he jo ek duusare se jude evam ek duusare par aadhaarit upapaddatiyon se bani he
 The manager has to connect these different groups to achieve the same objectives
 vibhinn vibhaagon kii gatividhiyon kii ekaatmakataa kii prakriya ko samanvay kehete hai
 Coordination is the power that binds all other functions of management to each other
 yah aisa dhaagaa he jo sanghathan ke kaary main nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye kray, utpaadan, vikray evam vitt jaise sabhi kaaryon ko piroe rakhata he
 Coordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management
 lekin yah prabandh kaa saar he kyonki yah samuhik lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kiye gaye vyaktigat prayatnon main ekta laata he
 Each managerial task is an activity that contributes to the coordination in itself
 samanvay kisi bhi sanghathan ke sabhi kaaryon main lakshith evam anternihit hai
 The process of coordinating the actions of the organization starts with planning
 ucch prabandh puure sanghathan ke liye yojana banaata he
 According to these plans organization structures are developed and employees are appointed
 yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan yojana ke anusaar hi yah sunishchit karne ke liye nirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If there is any difference between the actual actions and their achievements, it is resolved at the time of control
 samanvay kii kriya ke madhyam se prabandh kaa samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon main ekta ko sunishchit karne ke liye vyaktigat evam samuhik prayatnon kii sahi vyavastha karata he, samanvay sanghathan kii vibhinn ikaayiyon ke bhinn-bhinn kaaryon evam prayatnon main ekta sthapit karata he
 It provides the required amount of effort, quantity, time and serialization that ensures the minimum attainment of planned objectives
 uparokt paribhaashaon se samanvay kii nimna visheshtaayen spasht hoti hai- Co-ordination brings togetherness in collective work - Coordination brings interests that are not related to each other or different from each other, unity in objective work activity
 yah samooh ke kaaryon ko ek kendra bindu pradaan karata he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki nishpaadan yojana evam nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar ho
 Coordination brings unity in action - The objective of coordination is to bring unity in action to achieve the same objectives
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon ko jodne kii shakti kaa kaary karata he tathaa yah sunishchit karata he ki sabhi kriyaayein sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii jaaen
 You found that the production and sales departments of Labmart have to coordinate their work so that production can be done as per the market demand
 samanvay nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he- samanvay koi ek baar kaa kaary nahin he balki ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 It starts with planning and runs till control
 suhasini thand ke samay ke liye vastren ke sambandh main june ke maheene main hi yojana bana leti he
 She then arranges for an adequate workforce

 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke τεκτονικός se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he
 The term plate was first used by Canadian geologist Wilson and the term plate tectonics was first used by Morgan
 is siddhant ke anusaar prithvi kii upree parat ke rup main sthit sthalmandal, jisamen crust or upree mantal kaa kuch hissaa shaamil he, kai tukdon main vibhajit he jinhen plate kaha jaataa he
 Generally, the number of large plates in these plates is considered seven
 iske alaava kuch majhale or chote aakaar kii plates bhi hai
 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100
 parvat nirmaan ke sandarbh main prathamatya do mat prachlit the, urdhwadhar sanchalan dwaara or kshaitij sanchalan dwaara
 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains
 sankuchanavaadiyon ko pehali chunauti tabhi mili thi jab mahadwipon ke kshaitij sthaanantaran kii sankalpana kaa udbhav hua
 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other
 angrez darshanik francis bekan ne pehali baar sateek nakshon ke adhyayan se yah samanta chihnit kii, maanchitr vigyaani abraham ortalius ne 1596 main pehali baar yah kaha ki america europe or africa se tut kar alag hue hai or german dharamshastri theodor lilonethal ne 1756 main ortalius ke kathan kii pushti bible ke ek kathan ke aadhaar par karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue
 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate
 mudakar neeche kii ore kshepit hone vaala yah hissaa gaharaai main ja kar taap or daab kii adhikta ke kaaran pighalkar megma main parivartit hota he
 The depth at which this event occurs is known as the tiller zone or Benioff zone
 aise kinaaron ke sahare bhusannatiyon ke padaarth dabaav ke kaaran mudakar parvaton kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Going down, the molten material rises up as a magma plume and also produces volcanism
 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented
 is siddhant ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ke uttari or dakshini ore bane parvaton kii shrunkhlaayen tershiri yug main hue vivartanik ghatnaon kaa parinaam hai jinamein tethes sagar main jamaa avsaadon ke africa or europea platon ke bich sampeden dwaara inkaa nirmaan hua
 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati

 rajanyik kshetra main aise kathanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jinke falswaroop katu vaataavaran main sarasata aa sake or uttejnaatmak baat bhi namrata kaa rup dhaaran kar sake
 Such statements are called undertones
 is prakaar ke neunoctiyon kii suchi paryaapt lambi he
 Only a few can be mentioned for example
 neunoktiyaan rajkeey aacharan kii drushti se ullekhneey sthaan rakhti hai
 They create a polite and gentle environment even in the most difficult of circumstances and do not let unnecessary excitement prevail in public
 shisht shabdon main shantipurvak ek rajanyajna apni sarkaar ke amaitreepurn vichaaron kaa pradarshan kar detaa he
 These undertones prevent the environment from being stimulating
 yadi in shabdon par shishtataa kaa shahad na lagaaya jaye to ye itane katu ho jaayenge ki anya rajya inako nigal bhi na sake or sheeghra yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar de
 According to Prof
 Nicholson, the advantage of this traditional communication system is that in the soft environment it creates, a state gives a serious warning even without provocation
 neunoktiyaan kii haani yah he ki vastav se sankatpurna sthitiyon main bhi is prakaar kii uktiyaan sarsaadhaaran ko pravachana main daal detii hai
 The public begins to understand that there is no serious crisis in front of the country and their relations with other states are affectionate and friendly
 janatantr main janata kii yah asaavadhaanee khatarnaak ban jaati he
 Just as improper use of something causes a crisis, similarly in a big crisis, the humility of the statement makes the people more humble and sure than necessary
 janata yah nahin jaan paati ki uske rajya ke sambandh main kis desh ke saath kab bighad rahe hai or kab sudhar rahe hai
 By distorting words, a dilemma about their meaning also arises
 kaha kuch jaataa he or vastav main uskaa arth kuch or samaj liya jaataa he
 Inattention results in loss of many meanings
 pro niklson ne is sambandh main ek rochak udhaaharan prastut kiya he
 a Consulate General of England sent a notice to the Department of Nations saying that 'I have to write with great sadness that a sub-consul under me does not care for his health as much as the doctors advise him to do'
 vastav main sambandhit up-vaanijya doot sannipat avasthaa kii antim seemaa par tha
 Due to the excess of shortcomings in the language of diplomats, it was considered an act of deceit and deception
 jise ham aam vyavhaar main asaty bhaashan kehete hai
 He is called courtesy and courtesy in diplomatic practice
 lokapriy kahawat ke anusaar ek rajanyajna sambhavit kaary ke liye kahata he 'avashya ho jaayegaa' or asambhav ke kaary ke liye kahata he 'ho jaayegaa'; kintu vah 'kabhi nahin hoga', shabdon kaa prayog nahin karata, yadi karata he to vah rajanyajna nahin he
 This courtesy and concise behavior is losing its importance nowadays
 janata dwaara videsh niti ke sanchaalan main adhikadhik ruchi lene ke kaaran yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki rajanyagnon ke shabdon or kaaryon main sambandh rahe
 The public should believe that what their foreign ministers or diplomats are actually saying has the same meaning and they will actually do it
 aajkal sheet yuddh kii sthiti main prachaar kaaryon kaa mahatv badhane ke kaaran, prayek rajya videshi sarkaar ke prati aam rup se ashisht bhashaa kaa prayog karata he
 The small thing is called exaggerated
 baar-baar ek desh ke kaaryon ko amaitreepurn ghoshit karte hue bhi yuddh kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jaati
 The Soviet Union had said against NATO, SETO and SATO etc
 that they would consider their membership as unfriendly
 itane par bhi usne kisi rajya ke prati yuddh kii ghoshnaa nahin kii varan iske vipareet pakistan aadi rajyon ko hathiyaar bhi bheje
 It is clear that the practice of exaggeration is being abandoned nowadays and the nature of exaggerated statements is increasing
 is parivartan ke auchity ke sambandh main vichaarak ek mat nahin hai
 Advocates of the tradition of allegiances say that the use of lewd, sarcastic and provocative language should be stopped as soon as possible and instead the newspapers and other means of communication should make the public aware of the meaning of brief statements so that its evils can be removed

 muharram islamic varsh yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa he
 It is also a Muslim festival
 hijri san kaa aagaaj isi maheene se hota he
 This month is considered one of the four holy months of Islam
 allaah ke rasul hazrat mohammad ne is maas ko allaah kaa maheenaa kaha he
 Also, the statement of keeping Roza in this month has been said
 mukhtaliff hadison, yani hazrat mohammad ke kaul va amal se muharram kii pavitrataa va isaki ahmiyat kaa pataa chalata he
 Likewise, Hazrat Muhammad once referred to Muharram and called it the month of Allah
 ise jin chaar pavitra maheenon main rakhaa gaya he, unamem se do maheene muharram se pehle aate hai
 These two months are Jikada and Jilhijj
 ek haddees ke anusaar allaah ke rasul hazrat mohammad ne kaha ki ramajaan ke alaava sabase uttam roje ve hai, jo allaah ke maheene yani muharram main rakhe jate hai
 While saying this, nabi-e-karim Hazrat Muhammad added one more thing that just as the most important namaz after the obligatory namaz is performed, similarly after Ramadan, the best roses are from Muharram
 islamic yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa muharram he
 It is a matter of coincidence that today this aspect of Muharram is out of the eyes of the common man and should pray to Allah in this month whereas prophet-islam kept fast in this month and attracted the attention of his companions
 is bare main kai pramanik hadisen maujuud hai
 Ibadats going on the 9th of Muharram have also been described as a great cause
 hazrat mohammad ke saathi ibne abbaas ke mutabik hazrat mohammad ne kaha ki jisane muharram kii 9 taarikh kaa rojaa rakhaa, uske do saal ke gunaah maaf ho jate hai tathaa muharram ke ek roje kaa sawab 30 rojon ke baraabar miltaa he
 Goya should be fasting in the month of Muharram
 yah roje anivaary yani jaruri nahin hai, lekin muharram ke rojon kaa bahut sawab he
 However, it is definitely said that on this day the installment of Hazrat Noah, the prophet of Allah, got an edge

 The 10th day of Muharram month is called 'ashura'
 aashura ke din hazrat rasul ke navaase hazrat imam hossain ko or unke bete gharavaale or unke sathiyon ko kerbala ke maidan main shahid kar diya gaya tha
 Muharram is a major festival of people who believe in the religion of Islam
 is maah kii bahut visheshta or mahatv he
 In the same month in 680, a religious war took place in a place called Karbala, which took place between the grandson of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad and Ibn Zayd

 And since then, not only Muslims of all the world but also people of other communities also remember the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his companions during this month

 In such a situation, there is a need to look at the things mentioned by Hazrat Muhammad and follow them properly

 bhartiya samskruti main yah kai sandarbhon main aata he- Guide is a 1965 Hindi language film
 yah bharat ke prasiddh angrezi lekhak aar ke narayan ke da guide naam ke upanyaas par aadhaarit he
 The film starts from the present when Raju is being released from jail and then the story goes on in the past
 raju ek guide he, jo paryatakon ko aitihaasik sthalon main ghumaakar apni kamai karata he
 One day, a rich and old archaeologist Marco arrives in the city with his young wife Rosie, the daughter of a prostitute
 marco shahar ke baahar gufaaon main kuch shodh karnaa chahta he or apane guide ke rup main raju ko kaam detaa he
 He discovers a new cave and is so lost in his work that Rosie ignores him
 jab marco gupha kii khoj main laga hua he, raju rozi ko saiyr sapate ke liye le jaataa he or uske nrity kshamta or maasoomiyat kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karata he
 Rosie tells Raju that she is the daughter of a prostitute and how she became Marco's wife in order to gain respect in society, but has paid a huge price for it because she has a passion for dance while Marco is strongly disliked
 is bich, rozi jehar khaakar aatmahatya karne kii koshish karti he
 Upon receiving the news of this incident, Marco comes back from the caves and is quite annoyed to see Rosie recovering and tells Rosie that her attempt to commit suicide was a drama, otherwise she would have had more sleeping pills if she really wanted to die
 She could easily do this after eating
 ek din jab rozi gufaaon main jaati he to paati he ki marco ek adivasee ladki ke saath prem rach rahaa he
 Rosie and Marco have heard a lot about this and Rosie once again tries to commit suicide
 raju use samajhaata he ki aatmahatya paap he or vah apana sapana puraa karne ke liye zindaa rahe
 Rosie breaks up with Marco, but now she needs a place to hide her head and also the support of someone who gives her Raju
 raju ke samudaay main rozi ko bhi veshya hi mana jaataa he 
 Raju's mother and maternal uncle urge him to take Rosie out of the house but Raju refuses, so his mother leaves him and goes to live with his brother
 uskaa mitra or driver gaffoor bhi rozi ko lekar usase kinaaraa kar letaa he
 Raju's income ends and the entire city turns against him
 in sabake baavjood raju rozi ko ek gayak or nrutyaangna banane ke liye protsaahit karata he or uski madad karata he
 And soon Rosie becomes a star
 jyon-jyon rozi nai oonchaaiyaan chooti he, raju aawaragardi karne lagata he or use jue or nashe kii lat lag jaati he
 Now Marco comes back again
 roji ko waapas jeetne kii koshish karne ke man se, vah rozi se milane aata he or phulon kaa guladasta laata he
 Raju collides with her in the middle and Raju takes a bouquet of flowers from her
 marco raju se kahata he ki rozi ke kuch gahane he jo ek loker main jamaa hai or jinako nikaalane ke liye rozi ke hastakshar chahiyein
 Raju, in the fear that if Marco and Rosie meet again, does not re-establish their relationship, Rosie forged signatures in the locker papers, but does not allow Marco to meet Rosie
 is bich raju or rozi ke sambandhon main khatas aa jaati he jab vah raju ko apane paas aane se bhi manaa kar detii he or kahati he ki agar raju uske qareeb aayaa to vah baahar chali jaayegi
 Before this both of them had a debate and Rosie remembered Marco saying that perhaps Marco was right that the man should not live in a woman's income
 jawaab main raju kahata he ki yah rozi kii galatafahami he ki vah apane boote main star ban gayi he or usko star banane main raju kaa bhi bada haath he
 After some time, Rosie finds out the forgery
 raju ko do saal kii sazaa ho jaati he
 Rosie does not understand why Raju did the forgery while he can ask for money directly from Rosie
 raju ne paise kii khaatir nahin balki rozi ke pyaar main aisa kadam uthaaya tha kyonki vah marco or rozi ko milane nahin dena chahta tha
 Now the film returns to the present
 raju kii rihaai ke din rozi or raju kii maan jail main use lene aate hai lekin unhen pataa chalata he ki achche aacharan ke kaaran raju ko chah maheene pehle hi reeha kar diya gaya he
 Rosie and Raju's mother erase their estrangement
 rihaai hone ke baad raju akelaa bhatakta rahata he
 He wanders around because of poverty, despair, hunger and loneliness
 ek din vah kuch saadhuon kii toli ke saath ek chote se gaanv ke puraane mandir ke ahaate main so jaataa he or agle din us mandir se nikalne se pehle ek sadhu sote huye raju ke upar pitambar vastra udha detaa he
 The next day, Bhola, a farmer in the village, considers Raju to be a monk, sleeping in a Pitambar cloth
 bholaa kii bahan shaadi na karne kii zid kar rahi thi
 Bhola brings her to Raju and Raju convinces her to agree to the marriage
 bholaa or bhi aashwast ho jaataa he ki raju ek sadhu he
 He spreads this thing throughout the village
 gaanv vaale use sadhu maan lete hai or uske liye khaanaa or anya uphaar lekar aate hai or apni samasyaayein bhi usko bataate hai
 Now Raju comes to be known as Swamiji in that village and he also has differences with the Pandits of the village
 gaanv waalon ko ek kahani sunaate huye raju unako ek sadhu ke bare main bataata he ki ek baar ek gaanv main akaal pad gaya tha or us sadhu ne 12 din tak upwas rakhaa or us gaanv main barish ho gai
 Incidentally, there is a famine in the area of that village
 gaanv kaa ek murkh raju se vaartalap ke dauraan sunata kuch or he or gaanv waalon ko aakar bataata he ki swami ji ne varsha ke liye 12 din kaa upwas karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Raju falls into the fold
 pehle to raju iskaa virodh karata he
 He even tells Bhola that he is a prosecutor who has been punished because of a girl
 lekin is par bhi gaanv waalon kii us par se aasthaa kam nahin hoti he or vah kukhyat daaku ratnakar kaa udhaaharan dete hai jo aage chalakar valmiki ke naam se prasiddh hote hai
 Eventually Raju agrees to fast, although he does not believe that there is a relationship between a man keeping fast and rain
 lekin upwas ke dauraan raju kaa aadhyatmik vikaas hota he or uski khyaati dur-dur tak fail jaati he
 Thousands of visitors start coming to seek his blessings
 uski khyaati sunakar rozi, uski maan or uskaa dost gaffoor bhi usase milane aate hai
 Gafoor does not allow Bhola to enter the temple because he belongs to another religion
 raju madhyasthata karata he or kahata he ki insaaniyat, prem or paroapkaar hi uskaa dharm he
 Gradually, Raju's condition deteriorates
 aakhir main barahawein din varsha hoti he lekin raju kaa nidhan ho jaataa he
 While on one hand the villagers are jubilantly outside the temple, on the other hand, inside the temple, their relatives celebrate the mourning of his death
