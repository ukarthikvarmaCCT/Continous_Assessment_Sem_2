 Therefore, very sensitive detectors are needed for this work

 The frequency of gravitational waves is estimated from 10–16 Hz to 104 Hz
 siddhanthata har aisi vastu jo twarit ho rahi ho, gurutveey tarang paidaa karti he
 But gravitational waves produced by objects with low mass and low acceleration are so weak that they are very difficult to measure
 koi vastu jitani adhik dravyashaalee hogi or uskaa twaran jitna adhik hoga, vah utana hi adhik shaktisaali gurtviya tarange bhi paidaa karegi
 For example, in the universe, these gravitational waves are created when a very massive celestial body rapidly rises and explodes in its last state of life
 isi tarah, jab do viratkaay krishna vivar ek-duusare ko khinchate hue aapas main takaraa kar ek ho jate hai tab bhi shaktishaalee gurutveey tarangen paidaa hotin hai
 The gravitational waves produced at the time of explosion in stars or collisions between Krishna's vivas are so strong that they can be measured even on the Earth located millions of light years away

 Secondly, as the German philosopher Heidegger considered himself a humanist on the ancient Greek model, he held that humanism applied only to the German race and especially the Nazis, and thus in Davies's terms he was an anti-humanist humanist
 davis yah sweekaar karte hai ki beesvin sadi ke yudhon ke bhayankar anubhavon ke baad "galatiyon or vahashipan jo ve apane peeche lekar aate hai, ke sheeghra bodh ke bina manushya kaa praarabdh yaa maanviya tarkon kii vijay jaise muhaavarey gadhana ab sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
" kyonki "kisi aise aparaadh kii kalpana karnaa bhi asambhav he jo maanav tark ke naam par nahin kiya gaya ho
 phir bhi vah aage kehete hai "aitihaasik maanavtaavaadiyon dwaara grahan kiye gaye maidan ko chhod dena bhi avivekpurna hoga
 kyonki maanavtawaad kai avasaron par dharmandhata or utpeedan ke liye akelaa maujuud vikalp hota he
 Freedom to speak and write and campaign, oppose and disobey in favor of individual or collective interests: all these can be expressed clearly in humanitarian terms
 " Humanism began to dominate American school systems in the 19th century as a stream of education
 iskaa maananaa yah tha ki maanav buddhi kaa vikaas karne vaale adhyayan ve hai jo manushyon ko "sabase adhik sahi myne main manushya" banaate hai
 The practical basis for this was the belief in faculty psychology or specific intellectual faculties such as analytical, mathematical, linguistic etc
 ek sankaay ko majboot bananaa anya sankayon ko bhi faaydaa pahunchaane vaala mana jaataa tha 
 19veen-sadi ke ant main shaikshanik maanavtawaad ke ek mahatvapurn shaahakaar the america shiksha ayukta wiliam tori haris, jinke "five windos of da sol" ko "sankayon ke vikaas" ke liye vishesh rup se upyukt mana jaataa tha
 Marxists such as Terry Eagleton have criticized such ideas, pointing to the sophisticated cultural taste of some Nazi torture camp defenders
 maanavtawaad uttarottar hamaari prajatiyon, dharti or jivan kii ek samgr samvedansheeltaa ko darshata he
 Holistic humanism broadens its field among humans to consider the powers and obligations of human generosity while maintaining the iheu's definition of the individual's vision of life
 yah sweekaar karne yogya drushtikon punarjagran maanavtawaad kii ore vaapasi karata he jisamen yah shashan pranali kii ore maanavtaavaadiyon kii pakshadharata kii bhoomika kii purv kalpana karata he or yah ati sakriy jivan drushti kii barabari ke uttardayitva se labalab he jo vyaktigat maanavtawaad se aage hai
 It identifies pollution, militarism, nationalism, sexism, poverty, and corruption as permanent and noticeable issues of human character, inconsistent with the interests of our species
 yah jor dekar kahata he ki maanviya shashan pranali ekikrut honi chahie or yah samgr he, jisamen yah kisi vyakti ko mahaz uske anushangik vishwaason ke tark ke aadhaar par alag nahin karata he
 This in itself can be called the character of undisclosed humanism, which teaches the principles and beliefs of the species to fulfill the individual principles of man
 yah samakaleen america or british maanavtawaad ke vipareet he jinaki pravriti dharm par is seemaa tak kendrit rahane kii he ki in samaajon main aksar or visheshkar nae anuyaayiyon dwaara "maanavtawaad" ko saamaanya naastikta ke samatuly rakhaa jaataa he
 This extravagant identification with single mistrust is now being seen as undue truncation of one of humanity's most valuable and potentially complete intellectual traditions by removing the widespread and worthy adoption of humanism
 dwite gilbert jones likhte hai ki maanavtawaad hamaari prajatiyon dwaara puri tarah se angikaar kiya ja sakane vaala akelaa darshan ho saktaa he - isliye samgr maanavtaavaadiyon dwaara apane sambhavi anuyaayiyon par naa to bebuniyaad or swaarthee sharten lagaana uchit he or naa hi isko dharmik ugrata se jodna
 Here no one felt any weight of supernatural pressure on the human mind demanding devotion and loyalty
 maanavtaa - apni sabhi vishisht kshamtaaon, pratibhaaon, chintaaon, samasyaon, sambhaavnaaon ke saath - abhiruchi kaa centre tha
 It has been said that medieval thinkers bowed their knees to philosophical contemplation, but new studies strengthened them and dared to stand up to their full potential and move forward

 Sayan has practiced many texts, but the vertex of his fame is Vedbhashya
 inase pehle kisi kaa likhaa, chaaron vedon kaa bhashya nahin miltaa
 He was the commander and chief of the Vijayanagara Empire for 24 years
 europe ke praarambhik vaidic vidwaan tathaa aadhunik bharat ke shri arobindo tathaa shriram sharma acharya bhi inke bhashya ke prashansak rahe hai
 After writing the corpus of the Vedic words of Yask, the commentary of Sayan is well accepted
 sayan ne apni rachanaaon main apane charitra ke vishay main aavashyak tathyon kaa nirdesh kiya he
 They were residents of South India
 inke pita kaa naam tha mayan or mata kaa shrimati
 His gotra was Bhardwaj
 krishna yajurveda kii taittiriya shakha ke anuyaayi shrotriy the
 His elders were the chief ministers and spiritual masters of Maharaja Harihar, the founder of the Vijayanagara Empire
 unka naam tha - madhavacharya jo apane jivan ke antim samay main shrungerypeeth ke vidyacharan swami ke naam se adhipati hue the
 The name of Anuj of Sayan was Bhognath who was the general secretary of Sangamanresh and a great poet
 sayan ne apane alankaar sudhanidhi naamak granth main apane teen putron kaa namollekh kiya he jinamein kampan sangeet shaastra main praveen the, mayan gadhy-padya rachana main vichkshan kavi the tathaa shingan veda kii kramjata aadi paathon ke marmajna vaidic the
 a clear introduction to the names of Sayan's refugees is evident from the adherence to Vedic languages and other texts
 sayan shashan kaary main bhi daksh the tathaa sangram ke maidan main sena nayak ke kaary main bhi ve nipun na the
 Sayan had relations with these four Rajyans of Vijayanagar - Kampan, Sangam, Bukka and Harihar
 inamen se kampan sangam pratham ke dwitiya putr the
 And was Anuj of Harihar i who founded the Vijayanagara Empire
 kampan vijaynagar ke purvi pradesh par rajya karte the

 In about twenty five years, Sayanacharya appears to have commented on the Vedas
 is prakaar sayan kaa aavirbhaav 15veen shatee vikrami ke prathamardh main sampann hua
 Sayan's life was so influenced by Agraj Madhava and it was mixed with him that even the Pandits had enough doubt about their separate personalities
 iskaa niraakaran prathmat: aavashyak he
 Madhvacharya was the shikhamani of Indian scholars in the 14th century
 ve veda, dharamshastra tathaa mimasaa ke prakand pandit hi na the, pratyut vedon ke uddharak tathaa vaidic dharm ke prachaarak ke rup main unki khyaati aaj bhi dhoomil nahin hui he
 It is the result of his spiritual teachings and political inspiration that he established the Vijayanagara Empire in the form of Maharaja Harihar Rai
 madhavacharya kaa is prakaar is samrajya kii sthapana main purna sahyog tha at: ve rajya kaary ke sucharu sanchaalan ke liye pradhanmantri ke pad par bhi pratishthit hue
 It was his inspiration that these two siblings made the revival of Vedic culture the ultimate goal of their empire and they succeeded in this auspicious task
 falat: ham madhavacharya ko 14veen shatee main dakshin bharat main jaayman vaidic punarjagrati kaa agradoot maan sakate hai
 Madhav propounded many original texts for the widespread spread of epistemology and theology - antim granth kii rachana ke vishay main aalochak ndehshil bhale hon, parantu purvanibaddh chhahon granth madhavacharya kii asandigdh rachanaayen hai
 Madhwacharya retired after serving the authority of the minister for many years and leading the empire towards the desired attainment and sat on the honorable bench of Sringeri
 inkaa is ashram kaa naam tha - vidyaarany
 Even at this time, he made the Peetha dynamic and propounded a book called Panchadashi, which is an extremely popular book for understanding the elements of Advaita Vedanta
 vijaynagar samraat kii sabha main amaatya madhav, madhavacharya se nitant pruthak vyakti the jinhone sutasamhita ke upar taatparydipika naamak vyakhya likhi he
 The credit for giving orders and inspiration to Sayan for writing commentaries of the Vedas is to these Madhavacharya
 isi kaaran sayanane vedbhaashyako "madhaveey vedarthprakash" naam diya he
 The introduction of the three gurus of Sayan is found in his texts- sayanacharya 'vedbhashyakaar' kii khyaati se mandit hai
 But in addition to the Vedic interpreters, there is the power of his published texts, many of which are still unpublished
 in granthon ke naam hai- Subhashit Sudhanidhi - a succinct compilation of policy sentences
 kampan bhoopal kesamay kii rachana hone se yah unka aadya granth prathit hota he
 Atonement Sudha Nidhi - Also known as Karmavipak, this book presents the details of the atonement theme of Dharma Shastra
 alankaar sudhaa nidhi - alankaar kaa pratipadak yah granth das unmeshon main vibhakt tha
 Often the overall examples of this book are related to the life-style of Sayan
 abhi tak keval teen unmesh praapt hai
 Purushartha Sudhanidhi - This vivid compilation of mythological verses representing the four Purusharthas of religion, meaning, work and salvation was written under the direction of Bukk Maharaj
 ayurveda sudhanidhi - ayurveda vishyak is granth kaa nirdesh upar nirdisht san
 3 vaale granth main kiya gaya he
 Yajna Tantra Sudhanidhi - This treatise on the subject of Yagyanushthan is the creation of the reign of Harihara II
 dhaatuvritti - panineey dhaatuon kii yah vishad tathaa vistrut vritti apni vidvatta tathaa pramanikta ke kaaran vaiyakarnon main vishesh rup se prakhyat he
 This is a doubtless creation of Sayan even though it is known as Madhaviya Dhatravarti - its introduction is evident from the subtext of the book
 vedbhaashya - yah ek granth na hokar anek granthon kaa dyotak hai
 Sayan made his epoch-making commentary on the four Vedas of Vedas, certain Brahmins and certain Aranyakas
 inhone paanch samhitaon tathaa 13 brahman aaranyakon ke upar apane bhashyon kaa nirmaan kiya jinke naam is prakaar hai- Sainacharya himself was a Brahmin, scholar of the Taittiriya branch under Krishnayajurveda
 falat: prathmat: unhone apni taittiriya samhita or tatsambaddha brahman aaranyak kaa bhashya likhaa, ananthar unhone rugveda kaa bhashya banaaya
 The commentary of the Atharvaveda is the last among the Samhita speakers, just as the Satapathabhasya is the last in the Brahmin languages
 in donon bhashyon kaa pranat pranayan sayan ne apane jivan ke sandhyakaal main harihar dwitiya ke shasankaal main sampann kiya
 Sayan has named his languages as "madhviya Vedarthaprakash"
 in bhashyon ke naam ke saath "madhaveey" visheshan ko dekhakar anek aalochak inhen sayan kii ni:sandigdh rachana maanane se parad
mukh hote hai, parantu is andeh ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Madhav Madhav of Sayan was the inspirational preacher of the kings of Vijayanagar
 unheen ke upadesh se maharaj harihar tathaa bukkaraay vaidic dharm ke punaruddhar ke mahneey kaary ko agrasar karne main tatpar hue
 These Mahapatis had given the burden of writing the commentaries of the Vedas to Madhava, but due to their involvement in the odd task of governance, they placed this important weight on their shoulders only
 sayan ne rugveda bhashya ke upodghaat main is baat kaa ullekh kiya he
 As a result, it is not surprising for Madhav to be associated with his name as he is the motivator and imperative in the creation of these languages
 yah to sayan kii ore se apane agraj ke prati bhuyasi shraddha kii dyotak ghatana he
 That is why metalwork, too, even after being called "madhaviya", is a doubtless creation of Sayan, which he has clearly mentioned in the epilogue of the book - vedbhaashyon ke ek kartrutv hone main katipay aalochak andeh karte hai
 The Mysore inscription of Samvat 1443 shows that the Vedic route founder Maharajadhiraja Harihara conferred the three Brahmins named chaturveda-bhasya-promoter Narayana Vaipayyaji, Narhari Somayaji and Pandhari Dixit before Vidyaranya Sripad Swami
 is shilaalekh kaa samay tathaa vishay donon mahatvapurn hai
 The term "chaturveda-bhashya-prakrutta" available in it signifies the fact that these three Brahmins did special work in the creation of the Vedic languages
 prathit hota he, in panditon ne sainako vedbhaashyonke pranaynmen saahayya diya tha or isiilie vidyaarany swami ke samaksh unka satkar karnaa ukt anumaan kii pushti karata he
 It is not possible for one person to have so many verses
 falat: sayan is vidvamandali ke netaa ke rup main pratishthit the or us kaal ke mahneey vidwaanon ke sahyog se hi yah kaary sampann hua tha
 Vedas were interpreted even before Sayan
 kuch uplabdh bhi hai
 But such a well-known commentary on the entire scripture of the Vedas was not produced before
 sayan kaa yah vedbhaashya avashya hi yaajik vidhi-vidhaanon kii drushti se rakhkar likhaa gaya he, parantu iskaa yah matlab nahin ki unhone veda ke aadhyatmik arth kii ore sanket na kiya ho
 The meaning of Vedic mantras was first mentioned in Brahmin texts and based on this, the work of the meaning of words in Nighantu and the elaboration of those meanings in Nirukta was done
 nirukt main ine-gine mantron kaa hi taatpary unmilit he
 For the disclosure of the meaning and meaning of such a huge Vedic language, Sayan is the only credit
 veda ke visham durg ke rahasy kholane ke liye sayan bhashya sachmuch chaabi kaa kaam karata he
 Today the new methods of Vedarth epistemology may have been born, but the entry of the Pandits into the Vedas of the epistemology is the result of the efforts of Sayan itself
 aaj kaa vedarth parishili aalochak acharya sayan kaa vishesh rup se rini he
 Western scholars, such as Max Müller, have increased the pace in Vedic literature only on this topic
 vedarth mimasaa ke itihaas main sayan kaa naam suvarnaksharon main likhane yogya he

 kshatriya, , kshatra, rajanya - ye chaaron shabd saamanytah hindu samaaj ke dwitiya varna or jati ke arth main vyavahrut hote hai kintu visisth aitihaasik athwa saamaajik prasang main paripashwon se sambandh hone ke kaaran inke apane vishesh arth or dhvaniyaan hai
 The meaning of 'kshetra' was originally 'semen' or 'perforation power'
 kintu baad main yah shabd us varg ko abhihit karne laga jo shastrastron ke dwaara anya varnon kaa parirakshan karata tha
 In the Vedas and Brahmins, the word Kshatriya is used in the sense of Rajvarga, the Jatakas and Ramayana, Mahabharata, the feudal class and many warring people have been captivated by the word Kshatriya
 sanskrit shabd "kshas dasyon ho puraa kshatriya, vaisya va shudra naamak chaar virgon main vibhakt tha

 rugveda ke "purushasukt" main chaar varnon ke puranic itihaas kaa varnan he
 Some scholars consider Purusukta to be illuminated in the Rigveda, which is based more on new arguments than on the basic structure of Vedic literature
 chunki vaidic samaaj ke varnon main sabhi bhartiya jatiyon kaa ullekh nahin he arthath purush sookt ko vanshanugat jati vyavastha kii vakaalat hetu likhaa gaya tha
 The alternative explanation is that apart from Purusukta, the word "shudra" has not been used anywhere else in the Rigveda, so some scholars believe that Purusha Sukta was a combination of the post-rigvedic period, which was an oppressive and exploitative class structure

 haalanki, purushasukt main "kshatriya" shabd prayukt nahin hua he, "rajan" shabd hua he, phir bhi vaidic granthawali main yah pehla avasar mana jaataa he jahaan samaaj ke chaaron varna ek samay main va ek saath prayukt huye hai
 The use of the word "rajanya" is presumed to have been used for the king's relations at that time, even though it was established as a distinct section of society
 vaidic kaal ke antim charnon "rajanya" shabd ko "kshatriya" shabd se pratisthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan "rajanya" shabd raja se sambandh hona ingit karata he tathaa "kshatriya" shabd kisi vishesh kshetra par shakti prabhaav yaa niyantran ko
 The word "rajanya" prominently refers to the dominant place under the same lineage while the word "kshatriya" refers to the rule or ruler
 jaisawal kaa tark he ki rugveda main "brahman" shabd bhi durlabh prathit hota he, yah sirf "purushasukt" main hi aayaa he tathaa sambhawatah purohit varg vishesh ke liye nahin prayukt hua he
 On the basis of Panini, Patanjali, Katyayan and Mahabharata, Jaiswal believes that the political class was addressed by the name Rajjani and that Rajajnya was a democratically elected ruler
 loktantrik prakriya se chune huye shaasha jaise ki andhak va vrishni ityadi is sandarbh main udhaaharan maane jate hai
 Ram Sharan Sharma shows how after growing polarization between "rajanya" and "vis", a common head was selected by the various dynasty heads which resulted in differentiation of separate classes like ruling class on one side and "vis" on the other

 If hydrogen and iodine are kept together in molecular proportions in a closed process vessel at high temperature, the following action begins: is kriya main hydrogen tathaa iodine ke sanyog se hydrogen iodide banataa he tathaa samay ke saath hydrogen iodide kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 In contrast to this action, if pure hydrogen iodide gas is heated to 500 ° c in the reaction, the compound is dissolved by the opposite action, which causes hydrogen iodide to dissolve into hydrogen and iodine and the ratio of these products Increases over time
 yah kriya nimnaankit rup main hoti hai : In both the above actions, the speed of the action gradually decreases and finally becomes completely stable
 rasinic kriya kii is sthiti ko rasinic samyavastha kehete hai
 In the equilibrium mixture of the action, the relative amounts of the above substances remain the same, whether it is the combination of hydrogen and iodine to form hydrogen iodide, or the dissociation of hydrogen iodide into hydrogen and iodine, or the equilibrium equilibrium mixture of the three components
 Process in which equal numbers of hydrogen and iodine atoms are present

 yah hindustan aronaticks limited dwaara viksit ek seat or ek jet ingine vaala, anek bhoomikaaon ko nibhaane main sakasham ek halkaa yudhak vimaan he
 It is a tailless, compound-delta winged aircraft
 iskaa vikaas 'halkaa yudhak vimaan' yaa naamak kaarykram ke antargat hua he jo 1980 ke dashak main shuru hua tha
 The aircraft was officially named Tejas on 4 May 2003 by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 yah vimaan puraane pad rahe mig-21 kaa sthaan legaa
 Production of a limited series of Tejas began in 2007
 do siton vaala ek trainer sanskaran viksit kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki iskaa nausena sanskaran bhartiya nausena ke vimaan vaahak poton se udaan bharne main sakasham he
 The Indian Air Force is said to need 200 single-seater and two-seater 20 conversion trainers, while the Indian Navy may order 40 single-seater aircraft instead of its Sea Harrier
 tejas ke nausena sanskaran ke vimaanon ke 2009 tak aasmaan main udaan bharne kii ummid thi
 Recent developments suggest that the aircraft will join the Indian Air Force by the end of 2010 or early 2011

 On 1 July 2016, the first Tejas unit of the Indian Air Force was formed, named 'number 45 Squadron IAF Flying Dragors'
 isamen abhi do vimaan sammilit hai
 The LCA program was launched in 1983 for two primary purposes
 pramukh or sabase spasht lakshya bharat ke puraane padate ja rahe mikoyan-gurevitch mig-21 kii jagah lene vaale vimaan kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 The mig-21 has been the mainstay of the Indian Air Force since the 1970s, but the early examples became around 20 years old in 1983
 "laung turm ri-equipment plan 1981" ke jariye yah darj hua ki 1990 ke dashak ke ant tak mig-21 ke seva jivan kaa ant ho jaayegaa or 1995 tak bhartiya vaayu sena ko apane bal kii anumaanit dhanchaagat jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye 40% vimaanon kii kami padegi
 The other main objective of the LCA program was to act as a carrier for the all-round growth of India's domestic aerospace industry
 1947 main swatantraaa milane ke turant baad, bhartiya netaaon ne vimaanan or anya samrik udyogon main aatmanirbharta kaayam karne kaa ek mahatvakankshi rashtriya lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 The importance of aerospace "self-reliance" initiatives is not only to build an aircraft, but to enable the local industry to manufacture state of art products and equip them with commercial recognition in the global market
 elsie kaarykram kaa uddeshy aadhunik uddyan praudyogikiyon ke vistrut daayre main bharat ke swadeshi airospes kshamtaaon ko or vistaarit karnaa or samunnat karnaa he
 To better meet these goals, the government has decided to adopt a different approach to management and established the Aeronautical Development Agency in 1984 to manage the LCA program
 haalanki, tejas ko aksar hindustan aironautics limited kaa utpaada kaha jaataa rahaa he, par tejas ke vikaas kii jimmedaari vastav main ada kii he, jo 100 se adhik raksha prayogshaalaon, audyogic sanghathanon or academik sansthaanon kaa ek rashtriya sangh he or hieli jiskaa mukhya thekedaar he
 The NDA formally comes under the aegis of the Defense Research and Development Organization of the Indian Ministry of Defense
 elsie ke liye bharat sarkaar kii "aatmanirbharta" ke lakshya main teen sabase parishkrut or sarvaadhik chunauteepurn pranaliyaan- fli bai vir udaan niyantran pranali, bahu aiami pulse-dopalar radar or after burning terbo fain ingine shaamil hai
 Although India follows a policy of severely restricting foreign participation in the LCA program, only in respect of Hieli's key systems has Ada invited significant foreign technical assistance and consultation
 iske alaava, ingine or radar hi keval pramukh pranaliyaan hai, jinke sambandh main kida ne gambhirtha se videshi upkaran pratisthapann kii baat sochi, haalanki yah shuruaati elsie vimaan ke liye uthaaye gayi antarim upaay the, jisamen deshi sanskaran ke purna vikaas ke liye or adhik samay kii jarurut thi, jaisaa ki elsie kaveri bijli sanyantr ke maamle main hua tha
 With a view to achieving self-sufficiency in the field of aviation technologies, the ambition of the LCA program is highlighted by the fact that only three of the top 35 aviation equipment and line replaceable units include foreign systems
 inamen multi function displage sexent or elbit se, helmet-mounted disple and site signal pranali elvit se or lesar pod kii aapurti rafel dwaara aapurtit kii jaati he
 When the LCA reaches the level of production, even Indian companies will probably start supplying mfds out of these three
 kuch anya mahatvapurn upkarnon ke item kaa aayaat kiya gaya he
 As a result of the ban imposed on India after nuclear weapons tests in May 1998, it was originally planned to import several important items, such as landing gear, despite these being developed indigenously
 elsie ke kaarykram kii shuruyaat main kida dwaara pahchaan kii gai paanch mahatvapurn praudyogikiyon, jinaki "puri tarah se swadeshi "ladaaku vimaan kii sanrachana or nirmaan main bharat sakasham ho saktaa tha, main se do puri tarah safal rahe- samunnat carbon-fibre compojit sanrachanaon va skin kaa vikaas or nirmaan or ek aadhunik "glass cockpit

 In the shadow of the problems that have come in the way of the other three major technology initiatives, most of these achievements have not gone unnoticed
 baharhaal, bharat ke gharelu udyogon kii kamyaabiyon ke parinamswaroop elsie ke 70 pratishat purje bharat main ban rahe hai or aane vaale varshon main aaayaatit upkarnon ke upyog par bharat kii nirbharta dhire-dhire kam ho jaayegi
 In 1955, Hieli took on the challenge of an air staff requirement based on the experience gained from the HT-2 program and the manufacturing capabilities gained from the licensed production of the De Havilland Vampire FB
52 and T

 isse kai bhoomikaaon vaale ek ladaaku vimaan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui jo zyada oonchai par avarodhan kar sake or kam duuri par rah kar jamini hamale ke liye upyukt ho
 The ASR also required that the infrastructure be suitable as an advanced trainer and for ship operation optimization, although this option was later abandoned
 parinamswaroop bharat ke pehle gharelu viksit jet ladaaku, sabsonic HF-24 maarut kaa nirmaan hua, jisane sabase pehle june 1961 main udaan bhari
 Marut could not be inducted into the Indian Air Force until 1967 due to problems in developing and acquiring a suitable turbojet engine
 Meanwhile, Hieli gained additional experience developing and testing the Holland Genat F
1, which was under production license from 1962 to 1974, which led to a later improved version of the Genat Mk II Ajit HJT-16 Kiran turbojet trainer
 Developed, which was incorporated into service in 1968
 1969 main, bharat sarkaar ne apni aironautics samiti kii is sifarish ko sweekaar kar liya ki hieli ko ek kshamta sabit kar chuke ingine ke saath unnat praudyogiki vaale ladaaku vimaan sanrachana va viksit karne chahie
 'tactical air saport aircraft` ke aadhaar par ASR chihnit rup main maarut jaisaa hi tha
 Hieli then completed a study of the structure in 1975, but the project could not be completed due to an inability to obtain "capability proven engines" selected from foreign manufacturers
 chunki ajit atake vimaan kaa utpaadan jari he, jisase hieli ke ejiniyaron ke liye sanrachana kaa kaam thodaa hi bachaa, jabaki madhyamik hawaii samarthan or avarodhan kshamta ke saath hawa main shreshthata vaale ladaku vimaan kii bhartiya vaayu sena kii aavashyaktaa adhuri hi rah gai
 In 1983 DRDO received permission to undertake a program for the design and development of a light fighter aircraft and thus only this time a different management approach was adopted
 1984 main, elsie kaarykram prabandhan ke liye aironotical deveopment agency sthapit kii gai
 Ada is an effective "national association", with Hieli being a key partner
 hieli praathmik thekedaar ke rup main kaary karata he or uski elsie kii sanrachana, pranali ekikaran, airfrem vinirmaan, vimaan ko antim rup se taiyaar kar, udaan pareekshan, seva se sambandhit samarthan kaa agrani daayitv he

 Gas Turbine Research Establishment has the responsibility for the structure and parallel development of the GTX 35VS Kaveri after burning turbofan engine for Tejas, which will use General Electric F404 turbofan as an interim power plant until Kaveri becomes available
 elsie ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena ke hawaii karmchaariyon kii oktober 1985 tak puri nahin ho pai thi
 This delay led to the dismantling of the original program and the first flight took place in April 1990 and was taken into service in April 1995, however, this delay could prove to be a boon, as it would have made Ada a national R&D and industrial resource, The recruitment personnel got time to sort out the tasks like creating the infrastructure and to get a clear vision, so that the advanced technologies country Switch to the further development and does not need to be imported
 pariyojna paribhaasha oktober 1987 main shuru hui or 1988 ke sitambar main ise puraa kiya gaya
 Dassault Aviation of France was appointed as an advisor to review the PD and provide advice based on its extensive aviation expertise
 vimaan kii sanrachana or vikaas kii prakriya main PD charan ek praarambhik mahatvapurn tatv he, kyonki isse vistrut sanrachana, vinirmaan drushtikon or rakrakhaav sambandhi aavashyaktaaon ke pramukh tatwon ke parinaam nikle
 iske alaava, isi bindu par samgr kaarykram laagat ko sabase prabhavi dhang se niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The cost of implementing changes in structure requirements, capabilities and facilities increases rapidly and the graph of development tends to fall down compared to the time of commencement and is likely to cost more time and cost to complete the program
 elsie sanrachana ko 1990 main antim rup diya gaya or "relax static stability" ke saath yah ek chote delta pankh vaali mashin ke rup main tha, jisase ki yuddh kaushal main bhoomika badhaai ja sake
 lagbhag turant baad hi uddyan ke electranik upkarnon or unnat samgr dhaanche jaise kuch nirdisht kaarnon se thodi chintaa hui or bhartiya vaayu sena ko andeh hua ki ek aisi mahatvakankshi pariyojna ke samarthan ke liye bharat ke paas paryaapt buniyadi dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin
 may 1989 main ek sarkari samiksha samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya, jisane ek aam raay yah di ki bharat ke paas pariyojna shuru karne ke liye buniyadi dhaanche, suvidhaon or praudyogiki ke adhiktar kshetron main adhik paryaaptta he
 However, as a step of foresight it was decided that the level of development of full-scale engineering of the program would have to proceed in two stages
 charan-ek "avadharana ke saboot" par dhyaan kendrit karegaa or isamen do praudyogiki pradarshak vimaanon kii sanrachana, vikaas or pareekshan or ek sanrachanaatmak namoona pareekshan airfrem kaa gathan shaamil honge or TD vimaan ke safal pareekshan ke baad hi bharat sarkaar elsie sanrachana ko apana puraa samarthan degi

 Phase-1 began in 1990 and Hieli began work on technology demonstrations in mid-1991, however, due to the financial crisis, full-scale funding was not authorized until April 1993, resulting in Phase 1 work of FSED Started in June
 pehla praudyogiki pradarshak, TD-1, 17 navambar 1995 ko puraa hua or uske baad 17 navambar 1998 main TD-2 puraa hua, lekin kai sanrachanaatmak chintaaon or udaan niyantran pranali ke vikaas main pareshaani ke kaaran inhen kai saal tak jameen par hi rakhaa gaya
 One of the most ambitious requirements for the LCA was the specification "relax Static Stability"
 Although Dassault proposed an analog FCS system in 1988, Ada believed that digital flight control technology would soon replace it
 General Dynamics debuted on the YF-16, which was the first aircraft in the world to be called slightly unstable from an aerodynamic point of view
 adhiktar vimaanon kii sanrachana sthitik sthirataa ke liye "sakaaratmak" thi, jiskaa matlab he ki niyantran jaankaree ke abhaav main unamem ek str par lautne kii prakritikpravriti va niyantrit udaan hoti he
 But this quality is contrary to the skilled efforts of the pilot
 duusari taraf "nakaaratmak" sthitik sthirataa kii suvidha vaala vimaan apane str va niyantrit udaan se alag hat saktaa he, jab tak payalat lagaataar ise santulit karne kaa prayaas nahin karata, haalanki yah gatishiltaa ko badhaata he, par yah bahut kuch payalat par he ki vah ek yantric udaan niyantran pranali par kitna bharosa karata he
 The development of the FBW flight control system demands extensive knowledge of flight control laws and expensive writing on software codes for flight control computers, as well as knowledge of the need for its integration with flight electronic systems and other electronic systems
 jab elsie kaarykram shuru kiya gaya tha, FBW ek atyaadhunik praudyogiki thi or yah itani samvedansheel thi ki bharat ko koi desh nahin mila, jo ise niryaat karne ke liye taiyaar ho
 isliye, bharat kaa apana sanskaran viksit karne ke liye neshnal aironautics prayogshaala ne 1992 main elsie rashtriya niyantran kanoon team kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Scientists and mathematicians in the CLAW team succeeded in developing their control laws, but could not test them, as India did not have advanced "real time ground stimulators" at the time
 tadnusaar, 1993 main british airospes or lochid martin ko madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya, par vaimaaniki vikaas pratishthan ke liye niyantran kanoonon ko FCS software main code karne kaa prayaas pehle kii gai ummid se zyada bada kaam sabit hua
 Problems with specific control laws were investigated in BAE simulators
 haalanki yah viksit karne kii prakriya main tha, isaki koding ke pragatisheel tatwon ko kramash:ade or hieli main "minibard" or "aayranbird" test ring jaanch kii gai
 The second series of simulations were tested during flight on the F-16 VISTA of the integrated flight control software
 july, 1996 main simmulator, 33 pareekshan udaanen bhari gayi
 haalanki, lochid martin kii bhagidaari 1998 main khatm ho gai, kyonki us saal may main bharat ke duusare ke parmaanu pareekshanon ke jawaab main america ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 The CLAW team at NAL was able to successfully complete the integration of flight control laws indigenously, and FCS Software completed a 50-hour pilot test on the TD-1 without interruption, resulting in early 2001 The aircraft was approved for flight
 janvari 2001 ko elsie kii pehali udaan TD dwaara bengalore ke paas banaaye gayi rashtriya udaan pareekshan centre se hui

 However, after examining other radars in the 1990s, the DRDO became confident that its indigenous development was possible
 hieli ke hyderabad divijan or LRDE ko sanyukt rup se MMR kaarykram ke netritv ke liye chunaa gaya
 Although it is not clear exactly when the structure work will start, the radar development effort started in 1997
 DRDO kaa centre for airborne studies MMR ke liye pareekshan kaarykram chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 Between 1996 and 1997, CABS converted the existing Hieli / HS-748M aerial surveillance post testbed into lca's electronic flight system and radar test bed, dubbed the 'hack' and the only major structural change other than the rotodome assembly Also known as LCA, the nose cone of the LCA was prosecuted according to the MMR
 2002 ke tak MMR ke vikaas main deree or laagat main vruddhi kaa anubhav hona bataaya gaya
 In early 2005, testing was confirmed only for air-to-air 'look up' and 'look down' modes - two very basic modes
 may 2006 main yah khulaasa kiya gaya ki pareekshan vaali kai vidhiyon kaa pradarshan abhi bhi "apekshaaon se kam" he
 As a result, Ada reduced weapons tests during flight with a weapon dropping pod, which is not a primary sensor, postponing several critical tests
 pareekshan report ke anusaar, samasya kii jad radar or LRDE dwaara banaaye gayi unnat signal procesar modul ke bich anukulata gambhir mudda he
 Interim options for acquiring Alta's EL / M-2052 such as 'off the Self' foreign radar are being seriously considered
 prarambh main, prototip vimaan ko general electric F404- GE-F2J3 afterburning terbophan ingine se las karne kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 Simultaneously, in 1986, a parallel program was launched for the development of an indigenous power plant
 gas terbine anusandhan praadhikaran ke netritv main GTRE GTX-35VS, jiskaa naam "kaveri" rakhaa gaya, ke bare main yah ummid kii gai ki vah puri tarah utpaadit vimaan F404 kii jagah legaa
 However, the progress of the Cauvery development program slowed down due to technical difficulties
 2004 ke madhya main, kaveri rus main oonchai pareekshan main asafal ho gai or ise tejas vimaan ke pehle utpaadan ke rup main pesh karne kii antim ummid samaapt ho gai
 The companies were invited by issuing a tender for further development of Kaveri
 farvari 2006 main kida ne kaveri kii samasyaon ko dur karne ke kaam main takneekee sahaayta ke liye francisi vimaan kaa ingine company snisma se anubandh kiya
 At that time, DRDO hoped to have the Kaveri engine ready for use in Tejas by 2009-10
 kaveri ke vikaas main paidaa ho rahi khaamiyon ko dekhte hue 2003 main ucch gunvattta vaale general electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 injanon ko aath purv utpaadit LSP vimaanon or do nausena prototip ke liye kharidne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 Ada awarded a US $ 105 million contract to an American General Electric in February 2004 to develop and produce 17-IN20 locomotives, which began supply in 2006
 farvari 2007 main, hieli ne ek atirikt F404- GE-IN20 afterburning terbophan ingine kaa aadesh diya, jisase bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye tejas ladaaku vimaan ke pehle parichaalan squadran ko takat di ja sake
 Prior to the timely order, the F404-GE-IN20 was put on trial as a light combat aircraft and was part of the final evaluation of the test flight until mid-2007
 F404-GE-IN20 ingine ne sthapit kiye jane se pehle 19,000 pound sthapit kiye bina thrust arjeet kiya, 330 ghante kaa twarit mishan pareekshan puraa kiya, jo 1000 ghante kii udaan ke baraabar tha
 The IN20 replaced the F2J3 development engines, which carried 600 flights and used eight engines
 sitambar 2008 main, yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki kaveri tejas ke liye samay par taiyaar nahin ho sakegaa or ek aisa bijli sanyantr chunanaa hoga, jo utpaadan prakriya main ho

 Its potential contenders could be Eurojet EJ200 and General Electric F414
 eurojet EJ200 ke pranodan peshkash ko kaaphi joardaar mana gaya he
 The single crystal turbine blade technology, which was originally refused to Indian scientists, was also offered by Eurojet to India through the EJ200 engine
 may 2009 main yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki vimaan ke liye adhik shaktishaalee ingine hasil karne ke liye 3,300 karod rupye kii ek vaishvik nivida jari kii jaayegi, kyonki maujuuda general electric F404 ingine itnaa takat nahin paidaa karte ki kam se kam hathiyaaron ke bhaar ke saath vimaan hamale karne main sakasham ho
 Eurojet Turbo and American company General Electric will compete to supply 100 engines for LCA
 eurojet EJ200 or GE epa-414 ingine bhartiya vayusena kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karenge kyonki ve 95-100 kiloneuton takat utpann karte hai
 Indian Air Force sources also said that the structure of the airframe would be designed in such a way that heavy engines could be installed, which is expected to take three to four years
 haalanki tejas vimaanon ke shuruuaati batch kam shakti vaale general electric F404 injanon dwaara sanchalit honge, jo 80-85 kiloneuton kii takat utpann karte hai
 In December 1996, the then scientific advisor APJ Abdul Kalam calculated and calculated its unit cost at US $ 2
1 million
 2001 ke ant main kida or elsie kaaryakramon ke nideshak dow kota harinarayan ne elsie kii ikai laagat 17 se 20 lakh america dollar aanki or bataaya ki ek baar utpaadan shuru ho gaya to isaki keemat 15 karod america dollar tak ho sakati he
 However, by 2001 others indicated that LCA would cost US $ 24 million
 vartmaan daron par isaki prati vimaan keemat abhi bhi 21
27 million america dollar he
 Considering the increase in cost, some aviation experts believe that when the aircraft comes out, it can cost US $ 350 million per aircraft

 In addition to the above contract of 20 LCA, the proposal for purchase of additional 20 LCA final operational clearance configuration is in progress
 elsie ke vinirdesh bhartiya vaayu sena dwaara taiyaar vaayu seva jaruraton ke anusaar hai
 Tejas Mark-2 is also likely to be developed due to the inability of Mark-1 to meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force staff
 bhartiya vaayu sena 2005 main jari kiye ja chuke 40 vimaanon ke aadesh ke alaava kisi bhi mark-1 vimaanon kaa aadesh nahin degi
 jab phir se sanrachana kiye gayi mark-2 viksit honge to 125 vimaanon tak ke ek aadesh par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to a spokesperson of the Indian Air Force, the Mark-2 will have more powerful engines, sophisticated aerodynamics and other upgrades to reduce the number of obsolescent devices
 bhartiya nausena ke mark-2 tejas sanskaran ek vimaan vaahak pot se bahut kam samay main udaan bharne or utarane main sakasham honge
 The naval version of the Tejas is expected to be ready soon
 nausena pramukh admiral nirmal verma ne nausena ke apane pehle saptaahik samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki 2009 disambar tak DRDO ne aashwaasan diya he ki elsie kaa nausena sanskaran 2013 tak vaahak pareekshan ke liye taiyaar ho jayega or gorshkove / vikramaditya or saath hi bhartiya vimanavahak poton par tainaati ho sakegi
 He said the Navy was conducting a 'conceptual study' for more capable carrier aircraft for the IAC-2
 "nausainik ke elsie sanskaran" kii visheshtaon main se kuch : The Tejas is a jet fighter aircraft with a single engine and various roles, featuring tailless and compound delta wing platforms and with a "relaxed statics stability" structure, which helps increase aircraft maneuvers
 mul rup se isaki seva jamini hamale kii bhoomika ke saath madhyastareey "mook bam" ke rup main hawa main shreshthata sabit karne vaale vimaan ke rup main lene kaa makasad rakhaa gaya, par sanrachana sambandhi najariye main lacheelepan kii vajah se yah hawa se sataha or nauvahan-virdohi hathiyaar ke rup ekikrut ho saktaa he, jisase yah kai tarah kah bhoomika or kai tarah ke mishan puraa karne kii kshamta hasil kar saktaa he
 The structure of the tailless and compound delta planforms is to keep tejas short and light

 Wing tunnel test models and complex computational fluid dynamics analysis on a large-scale scale model have minimized the aerodynamic configuration of LCA, allowing it to achieve minimal supersonic drag, low wing loading, and high rates of roll and pitch
 sabhi hathiyaaron ko prayek shakha main ek yaa ek se adhik 4,000 kilo kii kul kshamta ke saath saat hardpaints ke saath dhoya jaataa he : har wing ke tahat teen stesan or ek fuzleg centerline par hota he
 There is also an eighth portside intake trunk under offset station, which can carry a variety of pods and under-fuseleg stations to centerline stations and inboard pairs of wing stations

 Externally inboard and midboard wing stations and centerline fuseleg stations have "weight" hardpoint provisions of up to three 1,200 or five 800-liter fuel tanks
 elsie aluminium-lithium mishra dhaatu, carbon fibre compojit or titanium mishra dhaatu-stells se bana he
 C-FC supplies up to 45% of its airframe as Tejas weight, including a fuselage wing, XI tailfin, rudder, air brakes and landing gear doors
 sabhi dhaatu sanrachana kii tulana main sammishran vaale dhaatuon kaa upyog vimaan ko halkaa or majboot donon banaata he or elsie c-fcs kaa niyojan pratishat apni shrenee ke samakaleen vimaanon main ek sarvocch he
 In addition to making the aircraft very light, there are minimal joints or spikes, which increases the reliability of the aircraft and reduces the possibility of cracks resulting from structural weakness
 elsie ke liye telphin ek akhand madhukosh ke tukade jaisaa he, jo "sabatractive" yaa "didctive" pranali kii tulana main utpaadan laagat ko 80% tak kam kar sakati he

 The use of alloys in the LCA reduced the total number of devices by 40% compared to the use of metal frames
 In addition, the number of accelerating devices decreased by half from 10,000 in alloy structures whose metal The frame structure was required
 samgr sanrachana se ek or madad mili ki airfrem main 2,000 chhed nahin karne pade
 kul milakar, is vimaan vajan 21% se kam he
 One of these factors can be reduced production costs, an additional benefit - and significant cost savings - realized in the expected time to assemble the small aircraft - seven months for the LCA as against 11 months of an all-metal airframe
 Use tejas ke nausainik sanskaran ke airfrem main naak ke jhukaav ke sambandh main sanshodhan kiya jaayegaa taaki vimaan utaarne ke samay drishy ko or behatar kiya ja sake auraudane ke dauraan gati or badhaane ke liye or wing leading age vortex controlrs kaa upyog kiya jaayegaa
