 According to Allison Acister, four common ideas related to structuralism constitute an 'intellectual tendency'
 sanrachnawad shabd ko aksar ek vishisht prakaar ke maanavvaadi sanrachnawadi vishleshan ke sandarbh main istemaal kiya jaataa he jahaan tathyon ko sanketon ke vigyaan se ullekith kiya jaataa he
 In continental philosophy the term is generally used in a similar way
 haalanki, is shabd kaa prayog sanrachanaatmak drushtikon ke vividh sandarbh jaise ki saamaajik network vishleshan or varg vishleshanmen bhi kiya jaataa he
 Structuralism in this sense is synonymous with structural analysis or structural sociology, the latter of which is defined as "an initiative in which social structure, barriers and opportunities are seen more clearly
 It is cultural norms or other subjective things

 " Structuralism was incorporated into education in the second half of the 20th century and became one of the most popular methods of education related to the analysis of language, culture, and society

 The term "structuralism" itself appeared in the works of French anthropologist Claude lévi-strauss and promoted the "structuralist movement" in France, which inspired not only thinkers such as Louis Althuzer, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, but also the works of structuralist Marxist Nicos Poulantzas

 Robert Scholes has defined structuralism as a reaction to modernist isolation and despair
 sanrachnawadiyon ne ek sankethik vigyaan viksit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Ferdinand de Saussure is considered the originator of 20th century structuralism and we can find evidence of this after his death in the Course in General Linguistic written by his colleagues based on the notes of his students, in which he did not use language but language
 Has focused on the underlying system and called its theory signology
 haalanki, bhaashan kii jaanch karne ke madhyam se hi antarnihit pranali kii khoj kii ja sakati he
 As such, structural linguistics is in fact the former form of corpus linguistics
 is drushtikon ne yah pareekshan karne par dhyaan kendrit kiya ki vartmaan main bhashaa sambandhit tatv aapas main kis tarah se jude hue hai, vah ye ki, kalkramik taur par na ki 'samakaleen' tareeke se
 ant main, unhone tark diya ki bhashaai sanket do bhaagon main bane hai, shabd rup or ek avadharana ke rup main
 yah pichley drushtikonon se kaaphi alag tha jisane duniya main shabdon or unase sambandhit vastuon ke bich ke rishte par dhyaan kendrit kiya 178-179)
 In structural linguistics, paradigm, syntax, and value are the key or main ideas, although these ideas were not yet fully developed in Saussor's view
 ek sanrachanaatmak pratimaan asal main bhashaai ikaayiyon kaa ek varg he, jo kisi nirdhaarit sthiti main die gaye bhashaai paryaavaran main ho, jo cintam he
 The role of different functions of each of these members of the paradigm is called value
 sanrachnawadi aalochana sanrachana ke ek bade vyapak saahitiyik paath se sambandhit he jo roopankan ho saktaa he ek vishesh style, antar-vaachnik sambandhon kii shrenee, ek saarvbhaumik vaachik sanrachana kaa namoona yaa aavarti namoonon yaa roopankan kii ek vyavastha kii katha kii ek dharna bhi ho sakati he
 Saussure's course influenced many linguists between World War i and World War II, for example, Leonard Bloomfield in the United States, Louis Jemslebh in Denmark and Olf Samerfeldt in Norway developed their own private structural linguistics
 france main entoni milate or emily benvenist sausar kaa kaarykram jari rakhenge
 haalanki, sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki bhashaa vigyaan ke praha skool ke sadsy, jaise roman jecobason or nicolai trubejakoy ne shodh kiya, jo kaaphi prabhaavshaalee hoga
 The most obvious example of Prague school structuralism lies in the vision of phoneme
 praha skool main bhashaa kii vibhinn awaazon kaa sankalan kar sirf unki suchi hi nahin banaayi jaati thi balki yah jaanch bhi kii jaati thi ki ve aapas main kis tarah se jude the
 They proved that by compiling sounds in the language, they could be analyzed by creating a series of contrasts
 is prakaar lagata he ki angreji main / pi / or / bi / alag dhvanigram kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai kyonki aise maamle hai jahaan donon ke bich keval do vipareet shabdon jitna antar he
 The analysis of sounds in terms of opposing features presents a comparative field, for example, making it clear that the difficulty Japanese speakers have in distinguishing the / r / and / l / sounds of English is because Japanese These sounds are not conflicting
 haalanki yah drushtikon ab bhashavigyaan main maanak he, par us samay yah krantikari tha
 Phonology will become the normative basis for structuralism in various fields
 nrivigyaan or saamaajik nrivigyaan main sanrachanaatmak siddhant ke anusaar arth ek samskruti ke andar vibhinn tareekon, ghatnaon or gatividhiyon ke madhyam se utpaadit or punarutpaadit hota he, jiskaa mahatvapurn pranaaliyon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa hai
 a structuralist studies activities as diverse as preparing and serving food, religious rites, sports, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to explore the serious structures within which culture is produced and reproduced
 is done
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanrachnawad ke ek praarambhik evam pramukh vrittik, nrivanshavigyaanshasri or maanav vigyaani claude levi straas ne 1950 main puranic kathaon, sambandhon tathaa bhojan kii taiyaari sahit saanskrithik ghatnaon kaa vishleshan kiya
 In addition to these studies he did more linguistic-centric writing where he dealt with Saussor's separation between language and parole to discover the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that make up the "serious grammar" of society are our Are generated in the brain and continue to work in us inadvertently
 levi straas jaankaree siddhant or ganit dwaara prerit the
 Another concept was borrowed from the Prague school, in which Roman Jacobson and others analyzed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features
 levi straas ne ise apane mastishk kii saarvbhaumik sanrachanaon kii avadharana main shaamil kiya, jiskaa usne garm-thanda, purush-mahila, samskruti-prakruti, pakke-kachche yaa vivaah banaam nishiddh auraton ke vipareet yugmak jodon par aadhaarit pravartan main upyog kiya
 a third influence came from Marcel Mauss, who wrote on the gift exchange system
 udhaaharan ke liye, mouss ke aadhaar par levi straas ne tark diya ki sambandh pranaliyaan samoohon ke bich mahilaon ke aadan-pradaan par aadhaarit he jaisaa ki edward ivance prichard or meyar fortes dwaara varnit 'vansh' ke siddhant ke virodh main kiya gaya he
 The writings of Levi Strauss became very popular in the 1960s and 1970s by removing Marcel Mauss in his Ecole Perfume Hautes Itudes Chair, and it greatly expanded the term "structuralism" itself
 Writers such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach were heavily influenced by structuralism in Britain
 france main mauris godlier or emenual terry jaise lekhakon ne marxvad ko sanrachanaatmak nrivigyaan ke saath joda
 sanyukt rajya america main marshall salins or james boon jaise lekhak maanav samaaj kaa apana vishleshan uplabdh karaane ke liye sanrachnawad ke sahare aage bade
 1980 ke dashak main kai kaarnon kii vajah kii sanrachanaatmak nrivigyaan ne apni lokapriyata kho di

 Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism should be put more forward in the case of anthropology
 And in general, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Ordeau led to the idea of how human institutions and behavior were changing cultural and social structures, a trend that Sherry Autoner called 'theory of practice'
 haalanki, kuch nrivigyaani siddhantavaadi jo levi straas ke sanrachnawad ke sanskaran main ullekhneey galtiyaan khoj chuke the, maanav samskruti ke liye ek buniyadi sanrachanaatmak aadhaar se peeche nahin hat sake
 jeevatjivotpatti sambandhi sanrachnawad samooh ne tark diya ki samskruti ke liye kisi tarah kaa sanrachanaatmak aadhaar hona chahie kyonki har insaan ke mastishk ke dhaanche kii pranali ek hi tarah kii hoti he
 He proposed a type of neuroanthropology that formed the basis of cultural homogeneity and differentiated the integration between cultural anthropology and neuroscience — a program adopted by theorists such as Victor Turner
 saahitiyik siddhant main sanrachnawad antarnihit aparivartaneey sanrachana kii jaanch dwaara vaachan saamagree ke vishleshan karne kii vyavastha he jo ferdinand di sausar kii bhashaai sanket pranali par aadhaarit he
 Structuralists believe that every text should have structure, which explains how it is easier for experienced readers to understand a text than it is for non-experienced readers
 isliye, ve kehete hai ki jo kuch bhi likhaa he vah "sahitya ke vyakaran" ke vishisht niyamon dwaara niyantrit prathit hota he, jise log shaikshik santhaan main sikhte hai or ise anaavruth kiya janaa chahie
 One potential problem with structuralist explanations is that it can be too brief as scholar Catherine Belsey has stated, "a structuralist threat that can collapse all differences"
 An example of such a reading can occur when a student writes after reading West Side Story that the author has not "actually" written anything new, as his writing has a Shakespearean Romeo Juliet-like structure
 donon hi avataranon main ek ladki or ek ladke main pyaar darshaya gaya he jabaki ve donon aise samoohon se jude hue the jo aapas main nafrat karte the or yah sangharsh unki maut ke baad hi khatm hua
 Structuralist reading focuses on how a single text eradicates the tension inherent in narrative structures
 agar ek sanrachnawadi pathan kai paathon par kendrit hota he, tab unamem aisi koi susangat pranali avashya honi chahie jisase ve paath ek duusare se jude rahe
 Structuralism has such versatility that the same story can be distinguished from literary criticism, as if two friendly families decide the marriage of their children, knowing that both children hate each other and ultimately They both commit suicide to stay away from this marriage; The conclusion is that the structure of the second story is in stark contrast to the structure of the first story: the family relationship of the two lovers and the two couples is shown to be the opposite
 sanrachnawad kii saahitiyik aalochana kaa tark he ki "saahitiyik paath kaa naveen mulya" nai sanrachana kii bajaay charitra vikaas or aawaaj kii baarikiyon main vidyaman ho saktaa he, jisase sanrachana vyakt kii jaati he
 a branch of literary structuralism, such as Freudism, Marxism and transformational grammar, consider both a deep and a superficial structure
 frydwad or marxvad main gahari sanrachana ek kahani he, frid ke maamle main ladaai antat: jindagi or maut kii sahaj pravriti ke bich he or marks main sangharsh virgon ke bich he jisaki jaden aarthik aadhaar main "nihit" hai
 Literary structuralism often follows the parables of Vladimir Prupp, Algridus Julian Grammus, and Claude Levi Strauss, who seek a variety of ur-kahaani or multiple versions of Ur-myths to seek deeper elements found in stories, myths, and more recently short stories
 Are combined by production
 frid or marks kii tarah lekin parivartankaree vyakaran ke vipareet ye buniyadi tatv arth-vaahak hai
 There is considerable resemblance between structural literary theory and the primordial criticism of Northrop Frye, who is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths
 kuch aalochakon ne vyaktigat kaaryon ke siddhant ko bhi lagu karne kii koshish kii lekin vyaktigat kaam main anuthi sanrachanaon ko khojane kaa prayaas sanrachanaatmak kaarykram ke pratikul chalata he or iskaa nai aalochana se saadrishy he
 The other branch of literary structuralism is semiotics and is based on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure
 1940 or 1950 ke dashakon main jin paul sartre dwaara pratipaadit astitvvaad pramukh bhav tha
 Structuralism made headlines after the First World War WWII in France, and especially in the 1960s
 france main sanrachnawad kii aarambhik lokapriyata ne ise duniya bhar main prasaarit kar diya
 saamaajik vigyaan isse bahut adhik prabhavit the
 Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and emphasized that human behavior is determined by different structures
 is bare main sabase mahatvapurn praarambhik kaam claude levi straas kaa 1949 kaa sanskaran elementary strecchars of kinship tha
 Levi Strauss came into contact with Jacobson in New York during World War i WWII and was influenced by both Jacobson's structuralism and the American anthropological tradition
 elementry strecchars main unhone sanrachanaatmak drushtikon se sambandh pranali kii jaanch kii or bataaya ki vastav main vibhinn saamaajik sanghathan kitne spasht rup se kuch aadharbhoot sambandh sanrachanaon kaa parivartit rup hai
 In the late 1950s he published Structural Anthropology, a collection of essays on the outline of his program for structuralism
 1960 ke dashak ke purvarddh tak sanrachnawad swayan ek andolan ke rup main saamne aane laga or kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki yah maanav jivan ke liye ek aisa ekikrut tarika prastut karata he jo sabhi drushtikonon ko gale lagayegaa
 rolland barthes or jacks darida ne is baat par dhyaan kendrit kiya ki sanrachnawad ko kis tarah se sahitya main prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 By combining Freud and De Saussure, the French structuralist Jacques Lacan applied structuralism to psychoanalysis and Jean Piget diffused structuralism into the study of psychology
 lekin jin piget jo khud ko behatar rachnawadi ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai, sanrachnawad ko "siddhant nahin ek vidhi" maanate hai kyonki unke liye "sanrachana ke bagaiyr koi nirmaan nahin hota, chaahe vah amoort ho yaa anuvanshik" Michel Foucault's book The Order of Things examined the history of science to find out how Gnanamimamsa or the structures of knowledge created a path through which people imagined knowledge and information
 thik isi tarah se, vigyaan ke america itihaaskaar thomas kun ne apane moulik vigyaan kii sanrachanaon main bhi da strecchar of scientific revolutions - jaisaa ki sheershak se hi jaahir he, apane kathor sanrachnawadi hone kaa hi ahsaas karaayaa

 By combining Marx and structuralism, another French thinker Louis Althuzer introduced his personal brand of structural social analysis and extended "structural Marxism"
 Since then other writers in France and abroad have extended structural analysis practically to every system

 apni lokapriyata ke parinaam swarup 'sanrachnawad' kii paribhaasha bhi sthanantarit ho gayi
 After its popularity as a movement expanded and faded away, some writers considered themselves 'structuralist' only to later abandon the label
 french or angreji main is shabd kaa arth kuch alag he
 For example, in America, Derrida has been regarded as a paradigm of post-structuralism, while in France it has been characterized as structuralist
 antat:, kuch lekhakon ke kai alag-alag shaileyon main likhaa
 udhaaharan ke liye, barthes ne kuch kitaaben likhin jo spasht rup se sanrachnawadi hai or duusari spasht rup se aisi nahin hai
 Structuralism today is less popular than approaches such as post-structuralism and deconstruction
 iske kai kaaran hai
 Often, structuralism has been criticized for being unhistorical and favoring deterministic structural forces rather than acting in individual capacity
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak kii raajnneetik halchal shiksha ko prabhavit karne lagi, shakti or raajnneetik sangharsh ke muddon ko logon ke dhyaan ke kendra main le jaaya gaya
 Ethnologist Robert Jullin defined a different ethnological method that clearly tainted itself against structuralism
 1980 ke dashak main dikanshatruction or bhashaa kii buniyadi aspashtataa par iskaa prabhaav- apni paardarshee taarkik sanrachana kii apeksha- adhik lokapriy ban gaya
 By the turn of the century structuralism was seen as an important historical denomination of ideas, but it was the movements launched by it that replaced attention, rather than structuralism itself

 unhone yah bhi bataaya he ki ishwar satya he or manushya ko achche kaary karne chahie taaki paramatma ke darbar main use lajjit na hona pade
 Guru Nanak has said in one of his books that Pandits read pothi, but do not understand the idea
 dusron ko upadesh dete hai, isse unka maaya kaa vyapaar chalata he
 His words are false, he wanders into the world
 inhen sabad ke saar kaa koi gyaan nahin he
 These pundits are still in debate
 guru arjuna dev to yahan tak kehete hai ki paramatma vyapak he jaise sabhi vanaspatiyon main aag samaayi hui he evam doodh main ghi samaaya hua he
 In the same way, the light of the divine is prevalent in everyone, the divine is spread in all its parts
 sikh dharm ko majboot or maryadasmpann banane ke liye guru arjuna-dev ne aadi granth kaa sampadan karke ek bahut bada aitihaasik evam shaashvat kaary kiya
 He also honored the compositions of 15 saints and 14 creators with five Sikh Gurus in the Adi Granth
 in paanch guruon ke naam hai- guru nanak, guru angaddev, guru amardaas, guru ramdaas or guru arjunadev
 Guruji showed his benevolent humanist vision by storing the speech of 15 saints in Shaikh Farid, Jayadeva, Trilochan, Sadhana, Namdev, Veni, Ramananda, Kabir, Ravidas, Pipa, Saitha, Dhanna, Bhikhan, Parmanand and Surdas
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone haribans, balha, mathura, gaynd, nalh, bhall, salh bhikkha, kirat, bhai maradaana, sundardaas, raai balwand evam satta duum, kalsahaar, jaalp jaise 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko aadigranth main sthaan dekar unhen ucch sthaan pradaan kiya
 While doing this amazing work, no limitation of religion, caste, region and language was created in front of Guru Arjun Dev
 unhen maaloom tha in sabhi guruon, santon evam kaviyon kaa saanskrithik, vaicharik evam chintanparak aadhaar ek hi he
 It is noteworthy that when Guru Arjunadeva completed the editing work of Adigranth in 1604 AD, then the first five gurus had the works in it
 iske baad guru govind singh ne apane pita guru teg bahadur kii vaani shaamil karke aadigranth ko antim rup diya
 There are a total of 778 posts of 15 saints in the adi-granth
 inamen 541 kabir ke, 122 shaikh farid ke, 60 namdev ke or 40 sant ravidaas ke hai
 One to four positions of other saints have been placed in the Adi Granth
 gauratlab he ki aadi granth main sangrahit ye rachanaayen gat 400 varshon se adhik samay ke bina kisi parivartan ke puri tarah surakshit hai
 But the former Guru Gobind Singh, before his death, appointed Guru Granth Saheb for the spiritual guidance of all Sikhs and the entire Khalsa Panth for 'worldly direction' as 'guru Pad'
 us samay aadigranth guru sahab ke rup main sweekaar kiya jane laga
 Guru Gobind Singh initiated people of all religions and castes into the guru-shishya-tradition to make Sikhism a classic
 unhone aane vaali shatabdiyon ke liye is nae manushya kaa srijan kiya
 This new human being is not always divided into castes and religions, is always committed to the protection of religion, human and country
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii yah sancharana, nihsandeh, sikh maanas kii thati he
 Then, the ultimate goal of Sikhism is human welfare
 kadaachit isi maanav-kalyaan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko ek lambaa patr likhaa tha, jisamen ishwar kii stuti ke saath-saath aurangzeb ke shashan-kaal main ho rahe anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa maarmik ullekh he
 In this letter, the pretext of doing righteous deeds and not shedding the blood of innocent subjects, cracking under the guise of religion and God and warning for lies and like a warrior, is a war to fight in the battlefield
 kaha jaataa he ki is patr ko padhakar aurangzeb kii runh kaanp uthi thi or iske baad vah adhik samay tak jivit nahin rahaa
 Even his inner desire to meet Guruji could not be fulfilled
 yah koi shrey lene-dene vaali baat nahin he ki sikh guruon kaa sahaj, saral, sada or swaabhaavik jivan jin mulyon par aadhaarit tha, nishchay hi un mulyon ko unhone paramparaagat bhartiya chetana se grahan kiya tha
 According to the demand of the country, time and circumstances, he had deeply influenced the political, social, religious, economic and cultural life of the then by changing his personality
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The Sikh Gurus gave a new direction to the religion and social order of their time
 unhone bhakthi, gyaan, upasna, aadhyatm evam darshan ko ek sankeern daayre se nikaalkar samaaj ko us tabake ke bich pahunchaa diya, jo isse purnat: vanchit the
 This awakened the self-realization of the people and a new vision and awareness arose in them, they started recognizing the self-realized experience
 is prakaar nirgun niraakaar param shakti kaa pravaah prakhar evam twarit rup se praapt hua
 Another peculiarity of Sikhism is that Sikh Gurus talked about human beings venturing into life, achieving happiness while earning and attaining God by meditating
 unka maananaa tha ki parishram karanevaala vyakti sabhi chintaaon se mukt rahata he
 Guru Nanak has even said that the person who earns hard work and does some charity in it, he recognizes the right path
 sikh guruon dwaara prarambh kii gai ‘lungar’ pratha vishvabandhutv, maanav-prem, samanta evam udaartaa kii anyatra na pai jane vaali misaal he
 Sikh Gurus also established cultural and moral values that never fade
 unhone apane darshanik evam aadhyatmik chintan se bhaanp liya tha ki aane vaala samay kaisaa hoga
 Therefore, he insisted on alternative thinking against blind copying
 shaareerik-abhyaas evam vinodashiltaa ko jivan kaa aavashyak ang mana
 Punjabi folk songs, folk dances and Hola Mahalla are the inspiration-seeds of the Sikh Gurus at the core of their performance
 in lokgeeton evam lok nrityon kii jaden punjab kii dharti se footati hai or logon main thirakan paidaa karti hai
 Bhangra and Giddha are the cultural pride of Punjab, whose beats are often heard in India and abroad
 punjabi samskruti rashtriyata kaa merudand he
 There is unity in its soul, sympathy, cooperation, compassion and human love in its blood
 punjabi samskruti aadmi se jodatii he or uski pahchaan banaati he
 a Punjabi wandering in any corner of the world is one of its own miniature Punjab
 prayek sikh kii apni swatantra chetana he, jo jivan-sambandhi samasyaon ko apane hi prakaash main sulajhane ke uddeshy se gambheer rup se vichaar karti ai he
 Take the history of the Sikh Gurus, they did not formulate the imperialist concept at all, instead they kept on looking at the humanitarian world through cultural, religious and spiritual harmony
 azaadi ke purv, bharat-paak vibhaajan evam iske baad kai dashakon main punjab main samay-samay par aae hinsaatmak-zalazalon evam nirdayee vidhwanson ke baavjood is dharti ke logon ne apana shantipurna astitv banaae rakhaa he
 The guidance has been flashes
 sikhon ke das guru he
 Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is a religious book of Sikhs
 sikhamat kii shuruyaat hi "ek" se hoti he
 The Sikh scriptures only interpret "one"
 ek ko nirankaar, parbrahm adik gunavachak naamon se janaa jaataa hai
 The form of Nirankar is mentioned at the beginning of Sri Gurugranth Sahib, which is called 'mool Mantra' in common language
 takreeban sabhi dharm isi "ek" kii aradhana karte hai, lekin "ek" kii vibhinn avasthaaon kaa zikr va vyakhya shri guru granth sahib ji main di gai he wo apane aap main niraali he
 The living soul which is formless, has only 4 qualities of Nirankar
 baaki chaar gun praapt karte hi jeev aatma vaapis nirankaar main samaa jaati he, lekin usko praapt karne ke liye jeev aatma ko khud ko gurmat ke gyaan dwaara samajhnaa zaruri he
 It is called "soul contemplation" in Sikhism
 aatma kaa niraakaari swaroop man, chit, surat, budhi, mati adik kii jaankaree sikh dharm ke mul sikhyaon main di jaati he
 By understanding these activities, a person can understand himself
 sikh dharm kii shuruyaat hi aatam gyaan se hoti he
 What is soul? Where did it come from? Why does it exist? What to do is Etihadi is taught by special Sikh propaganda of spirituality
 aatma ke vikaar kya hai, kaise vikaar mukt ho
 The soul itself is part of the nirankar
 iskaa gyaan karavaate karavaate nirankaar kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Sikhism does not believe in personnel philosophy
 anya dharmo kaa kahana he ki prabhu ko ache karm pasand hai or bure karmo waalon ke saath parameshwar bahut bura karata he
 But according to Sikhism, humans cannot do anything themselves
 insaan sirf sochane tak simit he karata vahi he jo "hukum" main he, chaahe wo kisi garib ko daan de rahaa ho chaahe wo kisi ko jaan se maar rahaa ho
 The same thing was made firm by Shri Gurugranth Sahib at the beginning: isi liye gurmat main paap punya ko nahin man jaataa
 If a person performs an action, then that difference should be done by mixing voice with soul
 yahi karn he kii gurmat karm cond ke viruddh he
 Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji tried to liberate the common people from the clutches of the contractors, pandas, pirs etc
 of religion by removing the prevalent practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisy in the Indian society of his time
 nimnlikhit chaar 'padaarth' maanav ko apane jeevankaal main praapt karnaa anivaary he : Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha were not taken into four substances
 shri guru gobind singh ji kehete hai: In Sikhism, devotees and Satgurus have called Nirankar without formlessness
 kyonki sansaarik padaarth to ek din khatm ho jate hai lekin parabrahm kabhi nahin marataa
 That is why it has been called a famine
 yahi nahin jeev aatma bhi aakar rahit he or is sharir ke saath kuch samay ke liye bandhi he
 Its existence is without the body, which is far from the intelligence of the common man
 yahi karn he kii sikhamat murti puja ke sakht khilaaf he
 Satgurus and devotees have treated idol worshipers with blind, animal etiquette words
 us kii tasviir bane nahin ja sakati
 Not only this, any worldly material like Kabar, historical things of devotees and Satgurus, idols are worshiped against the basic principles of Sikhs
 dharmik granth kaa gyaan ek vidhi jo nirankaar ke desh kii taraf lekar jaati he, jiske samaksh sikh natmastak hote hai, lekin dharmik granthon kii puja bhi sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 In Sikhism, every living being is called an avatar
 har jeev us nirankaar kii ansh he
 Any panchi, animal, tree, etc
 are incarnations in the world
 maanush kii yoni main jeev apana gyaan puraa karne ke liye avatarit hua he
 The person is not worshiped in Sikhism as "god forbid that everyone is alive, giving, AK God"
 tamaam avatar ek nirankaar kii shart par puure nahin utarate koi bhi ajooni nahin he
 This is the reason that Sikhs do not consider anyone as God
 haan agar koi avatar gurmat kaa upades karata he to sikh us upadesh ke saath zarur jude rahete hai
 As Krishna has said in the Gita that soul does not die and death does not happen, Sikhism agrees with this, but further Krishna has said that karma is the religion from which Sikhism does not agree
 pigambar wo he jo nirankaar kaa sandesh athwa gyaan aam lokai main baante
 As it is said in Islam that Muhammad is the last prophet, it is said among the Sikhs that "every jug jug bhakta upaaya"
 bhakt same dar same paidaa hote hai or nirankaar kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaate hai
 Sikhism agrees with "la ilaha ill Allah" but only Muhammad is not Rasul Allah
 arjuna dev ji kehete hai "dhur kii bani ai, tin sagali chint mitaai", arthath mujhe dhur se vaani ai he or meri sagal chintaaen mit gai hai kionki jisaki taak main main baitha tha mujhe wo mil gaya he
 Originally, the statement of devotees Avam Satguru was done by Satguru Arjun Dev Ji, which is called Adi Granth, is famous as a religious text of Sikhs
 This book is a true sermon of 36 devotees and it is astonishing that 36 devotees have lectured Nirankar in equal view
 There is no difference in a word
 Along with the Sikh Adi Granth, the Dasam Granth, which is the collection of the speech of Satguru Gobind Singh Ji, is also considered
 This book is under the Khalsa
 But taking knowledge of Adi Granth in the original form is the best practice for Sikhs
 yahi nahin sikh har us granth ko sammaan dete hai, jisame gurmat kaa upadesh he | Adi Granth or Adi Guru Granth or Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Guru Darbar or Pothi Sahib, is a religious book compiled by Guru Arjun Dev, which records the experiences of the spiritual life of 36 devotees
 The Adi Granth is said to be because of the knowledge of "adi" in it
 According to the chanting, "truth" is the beginning
 The scripture that makes it known is called Adi Granth
 Its references are within the text itself
 However, Vidwan says that because this book was not made by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, this is why it is an Adi Granth and Satguru Gobind Singh Ji climbed the 9th palace, hence this Adi Granth was called Jagan Guru Granth
 bhakton evam satguruon kii vaani potheon ke rup main satguru arjuna dev ji ke samay mojood thim | bhai gurdas ji ne yah granth likhaa or satguru arjuna dev ji disha nirdharak bane | unhon ne apni vaani bhi granth main darj kii | yah granth kii kai nakle bhi taiyaar hui | 1430 pages of Adi Granth were standardized by the Khalsa
 dasam granth, sikhon kaa dharmagranth he jo satgur gobind singh ji kii pavitra vaani evam rachnaao kaa sangrah he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji made many compositions during his lifetime, whose small books were made
 un kii maut ke baad un kii dharm patni mata sundari kii ajna se bhai mani singh khalsa or anya khalsa bhaaiyon ne guru gobind singh ji kii sari rachnaao ko iktha kiya or ek jild main chadha diya jise aaj "dasam granth" kaha jaataa he
 Simply put, Guru Gobind Singh ji composed and Khalsa edited
 dasam granth kaa satkar sari sikh kaum karti he
 The Vāsānī of the Dāsam Granth such as Jaap Sahib, Tāva Parsād Savaiye and Chopai Sahib are part of the daily Sajda, Nitnem, of the Sikhs, and these Vanyas are read while making Khande Bate's Pahol, which is called Amrit Chakna in the common language
 takhat hajur sahib, takhat patna sahib or nihang singh ke gurudwaron main dasam granth kaa guru granth sahib ke saath parkash hota hai or rose hukamname bhi liya jaataa he
 The attacks of Sarabloh Granth and Bhai Gurdas are doubtless creations
 However, the Khalsa Mahima is adorned in the Sarbloh Granth which is the authenticated work of Satguru Gobind Singh, the rest of the Srabloh text contains a karma scandal, a person worshiping itiyadi vizhi mojud who is against the basic principles of the Sikhs
 The words of Bhai Gurdas are recorded in the words of idol worship, karma doctrine etc
 sikh dharm kaa itihaas ke liye koi bhi itihaasik strot ko puri taranh se prpakh nahin man jaataa | shri gur sobhaa hi aisa granth man gaya he jo gobind singh ke nikatavarti sikh dwaara likhaa gaya he lekin isamen tareekhen nahin di gai hai | sikhon ke or bhi itihaasak granth hai jaise kii shri gur parataap suraj granth, gurbilas paatshahi 10, shri gur sobhaa, manhima parkash evam panth parkash, janmasakhiyaan itiyadi | shri gur parataap suraj granth kii vyakhya gurdwaron main hoti he | kabhi gurbilas paatshahi 10 kii hoti thi | 1750 ke baad zyaadaatar itihaas likhe gaye hai | itihaas likhane vaale vidwaan zyaadaatar sanatani the jis kaaran kuch itihaasik pustakon main satguru evam bhakt chamatkaari dikhaae hai jo kii gurmat falsafe ke mutabik thik nahin he | guru nanak kaa hawa main udana, magarmuch kii sawari karnaa, mata ganga kaa baba buddha dwaara garbvati karnaa itiyadi ghatnaaye jamsakhion or gurbilas main susajit hai or baad vaale itihaaskaaron ne inhi baton ke upar shrdhvas masala laga kar likhaa hua he | kisi satgur evam bhakt ne apana sansari itihaas nahin likhaa | satguru gobind singh ne bhi jitna likhaa he vah sankshep or took parmaan jitna likhaa he | sikh dharm itihaas ko itnaa mahatv nahin detaa, jo itihaas gurbani samajhane ke kaam aae utana hi sikh ke liye zaruri he | Today Sikhs are engaged in purifying history

 vaise to ve rekhaayen itani sookshm hoti hai ki saamanyat: inaki ore dhyaan bhi nahin jaataa, kintu inke vishesh adhyayan ne ek vigyaan ko janm diya he jise anguli-chhap-vigyaan kehete hai
 In this science, the advanced lines of the upper fingers of the fingers have special significance

 It is believed that finger-print science was born in Asia in very ancient times
 bhartiya saamudrik ne uparyukt shankh, chakra tathaa champon kaa vichaar bhavishya gananaa main kiya he
 More than two thousand years ago, fingerprints were used in China to identify a person
 kintu aadhunik anguli-chhap-vigyaan kaa janm ham 1823 i
 se maan sakate hai, jab brisla vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak shri parkinje ne anguli rekhaon ke sthayitv ko sweekaar kiya
 The present fingerprint system was started by Sir William Harschel of the Indian Civil Service in 1858 AD in Hooghly district of Bengal
 1892 i
 main prasiddh angrej vaigyanik sar francis galton ne anguli chhaapon par apni ek pustak prakashit kii jisamen unhone hughali ke sab-register shri ramgati bandyopadhyaay dwaara di gai sahaayta ke liye kritagyata prakat kii
 He proved a system of fingerprint classification and record keeping, proving the stability of the finger lines so that the suspect could be identified properly
 kintu yah pranali kuch kathin thi
 Police Inspector General of South Province Sir E
R
 Henry improved the above system and laid down a simple system of classifying fingerprints
 iskaa vaastavik shrey shri ajijul haq, police sab-inspector, ko he, jinhen sarkaar ne 5000 kaa puraskaar bhi diya tha
 Seeing the infallibility of this system, the Government of India established the world's first finger-print-office in Calcutta in 1897 AD to identify persons previously punished by fingerprints
 anguli chhap dwaara pahchaan do siddhanton par ashrith he, ek to yah ki do vyaktiyon kii anguliyon kii chhaapen kabhi ek si nahin ho saktin or doosraa yah ki vyaktiyon kii anguli chhaapen jivan bhar hi nahin apitu jeevanoparant bhi nahin badalati
 Therefore, by comparing any considerable fingerprint with the fingerprint of a person, it can be determined whether the fingerprint to be considered is his or not
 anguli chhap ke abhaav main vyaktiyon kii pahchaan karnaa kitna kathin he, yah prasiddh bhavaal sanyasiwad ke anushilan se spasht ho jayega
 After careful inspection of the lines, the personal characteristics of them appear in the form of lines and diagonals
 anguli-chhap-vigyaan teen kaaryon ke liye vishesh upyogi he, yathah There are many criminals who do not want to give their finger prints voluntarily
 at: kaidi pahchaan adhinium dwaara bhartiya police ko bandiyon kii anguliyon kii chhap lene kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Each state of India has a government fingerprint office in which records of the fingerprints of the punished persons are kept and necessary information is given after the expected comparison
 elahabaad sthit uttar pradesh ke karyaalay main hi lagbhag teen lakh aise abhilekh hai
 a central finger-print-office has also been established in Calcutta in 1956 AD
 inke atirikt anek aise visheshgy hai jo anguli chhaapon ke vivadagrast maamalon main apni sevaayen dene kaa vyavsaay karte hai
 The use of fingerprints is not limited to the police department, but in many public works it has proved useful for infallible identification

 Any civil society can ensure the identity of its own and lost children in the event of accidents or otherwise being damaged or going mad by getting a civil registry of their fingerprint for their protection and identification

 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption
 sarkaar ne ise upekshit karnaa jari rakhaa
 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August
 april main kiye gaye anna hajaare ke anshan kii samaapti kii sharton ke anuroop sarkaar ne 10 sadasyeey lokapal masauda nirmaan samiti ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii
 5 representatives of the government and 5 representatives of civil society were placed in it
 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge
 isamen aath sadsy honge jisamen se chaar kaanoon ko jaanane vaale evam anbhavi log honge
 The time limit for investigation was kept at seven years
 bharat kaa 65 vaan swadhinata diwas samaaroh anna hajaare dwaara april ke anshan kii samaapti kii is ghoshnaa kii chaaya main hua ki yadi 15 agast tak sarkaar ne lokapal vidheyak paas nahin karaayaa to ve punah anshan karengen
 Several days before August 15, it had become clear that there would be a hunger strike announced from August 16

 Anna did not agree to a fast for at least 30 days
 der raat ko dilli ke police ayukta ne kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, manish sitaudiya or arvind kejarivaal vaali anna team ke saath baithak kii
 After spending three days in Tihar Jail, when Anna Hazare came out at quarter past 12, he was seen full of enthusiasm
 unhone inkulab jindabad or bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke saath apane samarthakon kaa josh badhaayaa
 Anna said while addressing the supporters "1947 main adhuri aazaadee mili
 The movement for independence gained in 1947 started in 1942 and now from August 16 another freedom struggle has started, which you have to reach the end
 anna rahe yaa na rahe lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yah mashaal jalati rahani chahie
 i thank all of you who have been sitting outside the jail for 4 days and appeal to the children, old and young, to reach Ramlila Maidan in maximum numbers
 koi todfodaur rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen or trephic kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen
 He will talk to them only on the Ramlila ground
 " After conveying the message to the supporters, Anna Hazare left for Mayapuri in a procession
 khule trek main anna ke juluus ke saath- saath hajaaron logon kii bheed haath main tirangaa liye unke saath paidal march kar rahi thi
 Such a scene has rarely been seen on the streets of Delhi, when the public moved forward with slogans holding slogans in the heavy rain
 mayapuri chowk par pahunchane ke baad anna car se rajghat pahunche
 After spending 3 days in Tihar Jail, when Ramlila Maidan was prepared for the fast, Anna Hazare reached there at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on August 18 via Mayapuri and Rajghat with the procession
 vahaan unke aane kaa subah se intjaar kar rahe samarthakon ne naaron ke saath unka swaagat kiya
 On coming to the stage at Ramlila Maidan, Anna also greeted his supporters with the slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and gave him his message- “in 1942 there was a revolution in our country, which led to the British leaving
 angrej chale gaye, lekin bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua
 Therefore, the second fight for independence has started
 desh ke sabhi logon ne mere bhai, meri bahan, yuva - yuvatiyon ne yah jo mashaal jalaai he, is mashaal ko kabhi bujhane nahin dena
 The torch will continue to burn even if Anna Hazare remains
 abhi ek lokapal nahin is desh main puraa parivartan laana he
 We have to think how we will be able to give the palace to the poor affairs of the country
 kranti kii shuruyaat hochuki he
 i will not say much today because in the last three days my weight has reduced by 3 kg, but you are getting the energy of the movement you are running in the country
 ' Many countries have been made by youths, i am sure the youth of this country has awakened and now the future of this country is bright
 in gaddaaron ne desh ko lutaa he ab hambhrashtachar bardaasht nahin karenge
 We can never forget our freedom
 sar kataa sakate hai lekin sar jhukaa sakate nahin
 i am happy that there was no sabotage and no damage to national property
 ab main zyada kuch nahin kahuunga, lekin main aapse phir baat karuunga
 " 21 agast ko is andolan ko nai disha mili
 Addressing supporters at Ramlila Maidan, Anna Hazare said "vaise to is ramlila maidan main varsho se ravan jalataa aa rahaa he, magar is baar bhrashtachar kaa ravan jalegaa
 Their fight will stop only after the solution to end corruption
 mujhe kisi kaa dar nahin he
 Because i have neither any bank balance nor any assets
 mandir ke chah guna aath meter ke kamare main rahata hum
 "he called upon the people to go to the homes of the mps of their constituency and sit for their well being
 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is
 22 agast ko subah se shaam tak logon kaa saansadon or mantriyon ke gharon ke saamne jaakar pradarshan karne kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 Police also detained 50 people after demonstrating in front of Union Minister Kapil Sibal's house
 is andolan ko aage badhaane or kharchon ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye ramlila maidan main banaae gaye daan shivi par bhi logon kii lambii qatari lagi rahi
 Be it children or elderly, rich or poor, everyone was donating to this movement according to his capacity
 log apane gharon se khaanaa banaakar yahaan anna ke samarthakon ko baant rahe the
 The rich businessman, who was distributing food and drink in a truck or a laborer who was busy in cleaning the Ramlila Maidan, all were coming here on a call of Anna to the country of their own free will
 anshan ke saatven din anna kaa vajan 5 kilo kam ho gaya
 Ketones started coming in his blood and urine
 lekin unka utsaah purvavat hi bana rahaa
 Concerned over the deterioration of his health and its political impact, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee to hold talks
 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
 sansad kii kaarywai kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekhakar evam netaaon ke bayaan or chehre dekhakar janata anna ke saath rahane ke nirnay par atal thi
 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue 
 asli anshan puri ladaai jeetne ke baad tuutegaa
 i will roam across the country till the fight is over
 unhen vishwaas he ki unke madhyam se saamne laae gaye janata ke muddon se sansad inkaaranheen karegi
 But if the parliament refused, then the mass parliament would have to be ready
 aaj yah baat sabit ho gai he ki jan sansad, dilli kii sansad se badi he
 Whatever the Parliament wants, the Parliament of Delhi has to accept it
 hamen baba sahib ambedkar ke banaae samvidhan ke tahat is desh main parivartan laana he
 Today it has been proved that change can be brought
 ham bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This is just the beginning
 lambi ladaai aage he
 It is the question of the farmers, the question of the workers
 paryaavaran, pani, tel jaise tamaam mudde hai
 It is a question of education of poor children
 hamen chunaav sudhaar bhi karne hai
 The entire system has to be changed
 hamaara asli anshan is puure badlaav ke baad hi tuutegaa
 Today such a big movement took place in the country, but completely non-violent
 duniya ke saamne aap sabhi ne misaal rakhi he ki andolan kaise karnaa chahie
 This has been the most important thing in this movement
 22 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, raksha mantri e
ke
 antni va grih mantri pi
 chidambaram se charchaa ke baad sarkaar ne pranav mukherjee ko vaartakar niyukt kiya or anna ko patr likhakar is sarkari pahal kii jaankaree di
 After this, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Anna's aide Arvind Kejriwal and Akhil Gogoi met at the residence of Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 iske baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has been appointed for this
 23 agast kii raat ko pehle daur kii vaarta main sarkaar kii ore se mukherjee va salmaan khurshid ne bhaag liya
 Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan joined on behalf of civil society
 sarkaar ne vaarta ko santoshjanak bataaya
 The government expressed concern over Anna's health and said that talks would be held again on Wednesday morning
 anna dal ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar or hamaare bich teen muddon par asahmati he
 The government has sought time till Wednesday morning to consider them
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anna se anshan todane kii bhi apil kii he
 But in the conversation that took place today, nothing came out that we should ask Annaji to break the fast
 vaarta main sarkaar kuch muddon par sahamat ho gai thi
 But many subjects had not yet been agreed
 iske saath hi anna ke sahyogi kuch sharton par sarkaar kii manjuuri bhi chaahate the
 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers
 iske turant baad congress kor group kii baithak bhi hui
 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he
 i don't know why it changed in the government's attitude in one day and night
 mangalvaar ko wo hamaari baaten sun rahe the, aaj wo apni baaten suna rahe the
 Yesterday, he was respecting our words
 kal or aaj main din-raat kaa fark aayaa he
 " is gatirodh ke pashchaat 25 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vilasarav deshmukh ko patr dekar anna ke paas bheja
 Anna assured to quit the fast after three things were approved
 27 agast ko sansad kii kaaryava ke saath hi anna ke sahyogiyon se bhi lagaataar barta chal rahi thi
 But the government was not making its stand clear
 antat shaam tak in vaartaon kaa parinaam anna kii teen maangon par sansad ke samarthan ke prastaav ke rup main aayaa
 Vilas Rao Deshmukh again came to Ramlila Maidan with a letter from the Prime Minister to inform about it
 jiske pashchaat anna ne 28 agast ko anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast
 unka rakt chaap kaaphi kam ho gaya tha
 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August
 rajdhani dilli, mumbai, kolkata, patna, ranchi, lakhanu, bengaluru, shimla, jaipur, raipur, gandhinagar sahit puure desh main diwaali jaisaa maahaul ban gaya
 In Delhi, Anna Hazare's supporters reached India Gate waving the tricolor and shouting slogans to express their happiness
 log deshbhakti ke geeton par jhuumate najar aae
 Several individuals got out of the cars and joined the procession
 rajdhani raipur sahit chhattisgarh ke bilaspur, korba, raigarh main bhi anna hajaare samarthakon ne pataakhe jalaae or vijay ke uplakshya main naare lagaae
 If people left firecrackers in various mohallas of Patna, many people distributed sweets
 kargil chowk par pichley 12 dinon se anna ke samarthan main dharna or anshan par baithe log shanivaar der shaam jashn manaane main mashgool ho gaye
 Many people went to the temple to thank God and pray for taking care of Anna Hazare's health
 patna ke saath hi rajya ke darbhanga, purniya, saharsa, mujffarpur, bhagalpur sahit kai jilon main is janata kii jeet kaa jasn manaaya gaya
 It was really only a moral victory
 itihaas jarur bana tha kintu kaagajon par kisi thos cheez kaa nikalakar aana abhi baaki tha

 According to the Quran, Muhammad is the last prophet in the series of prophets sent by Allah
 The Quran refers to Muhammad as "nabi", "messenger of Allah", "prophet"
 Qur'an's 2: 101, 2: 143, 2: 151, 3:32, 3:81, 3: 144, 3: 164, 4: 79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7: 157, 8: In verses 01, 9: 3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09, Muhammad is called by various names, including bearers of good news, cautioners, and "who invite people to a just God Are, included
 The Quran states that Allah had sent Muhammad as "rahmat ul lil Alameen" for truth and love for the world
 allaah kuran ke surah al-ambia 21:107 main kahata hai :to be according to kanjul iman Muhammad is mentioned in the Qur'an as "pressured", "negotiator", "god messenger", "god servant", "proclaimer", "witness", "eloquent", "warner" "reminding" " Callers are called with names like "god," "stunning", and "kanti Giver"
 quran main mohammad sa0 ko "ahamed" ke naam se bhi sambhodith kiya he | saarvbhaumik bhaichaare kaa niyam or maanav-samanta kaa siddhanth, jiskaa elaan aapane kiya, vah us mahaan yogadan kaa parichaayak he jo hazarat mohammad ne maanavtaa ke saamaajik utthan ke liye diya
 The Quran also classifies some religious issues regarding Muhammad
 The most important of them is the command to follow the teachings of Muhammad, the Quran repeatedly commands people to "follow Allah and His Prophet"
 The name Muhammad appears four times in the Quran

 While returning to Mecca, Amina died due to weakness and illness, Abwa Salt became a deserted place
 After the death of his parents, Muhammad was in the care of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, but when he was eight years old, his grandfather also died
 After this he was in the care of his uncle Abu Talib
 Muhammad Sahana being orphaned at a young age is seen as a divine plan, under which he can develop the qualities of "self-reliance, reflection and perseverance", and become the founder of a great religion
 Many Islamic scholars believe that the orphanage of Muhammad had made him dependent on Allah, making it difficult for him to have a proper beginning

 During this period, three major states - Sao Wei, Eastern Wu and Shu Han - moved to obtain control over China
 kabhi-kabhi in rajyon ko sirf 'vei', 'vu' or 'shu' bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 According to some historians, this period began with the establishment of the Wei Kingdom in 220 AD and the end of the Jin Dynasty's conquest of the Eastern Wu State in 280 AD

 raajnneeti vigyaan ek saamaajik vigyaan he jo sarkaar or raajnneeti ke adhyayan se sambandhit he
 Political science is a broad subject or field of study
 raajnneeti vigyaan main ye tamaam baaten shaamil hai:raajnneetik chintan, raajnneetik siddhanth, raajnneetik darshan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, sansthagat yaa sanrachanagat dhaancha, tulanaatmak raajnneeti, lok prashasan, antarrashtriya kanoon or sanghathan aadi
 The origin of political science is very ancient
 unani vichaarak arestu ko raajnneeti vigyaan kaa pitamah kaha jaataa he
 Plato's idealism and Aristotle's rationalism are included in Greek thought
 raajnneetishastra yaa raajnneeti vigyaan atyant pracheen vishay he
 Initially it was not accepted as an independent subject
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan nitishastra, darshanashastra, itihaas, evam vidhishastra aadi kii avadharanaon ke aadhaar par hi karne kii parampara thi
 In modern times, it was not only accepted as an independent subject, but also developed well in the context of social sciences
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan aaj ke sandarbh main pehle kii apeksha ek ore jahaan atyadhik mahatvapurn he vahiin duusari ore vah atyant jatil bhi he
 The importance of political science is revealed by the fact that today the study of political process is necessary to understand both national and international politics
 prakriya ke adhyayan se hi vaastavik raajnneeti evam unke bheetar avasthit tathyon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 The complexity of political science is linked to their overlapping form and the nature and nature they generate
 aaj raajnneeti vigyaan ’raajnneetik’ va gaiyr raajnneetik donon prakaar ke tatwon se sambandhit he
 Political elements directly govern the political process and from this point of view, under political science, the study of state government, government institutions, electoral system and political behavior is done
 gaiyr raajnneetik tatv apratyaksh rup se raajnneetik prakriya ko chalaane main yogadan dete hai or is kaaran raajnneeti kii sahi samaj inako samanvit karke hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 For this purpose, in political studies, adequate importance is given to the supporting elements like society, economy, religion, culture, geography, science and technology, psychology and history
 unani vichaarkon ke samay se lekar aadhunik kaal tak ke vibhinn chintakon, siddhanthavettaon or vishleshkon ke yogadanon se raajnneeti vigyaan ke rup, adhyayan saamagree evam uski paramparaaye samay-samay par parivartit hoti rahi hai
 Accordingly, this subject has been continuously developing
 is vikascram main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke sambandh main do pramukh drushtikonon kaa udai hua he : paramparaagat drushtikon evam aadhunik drushtikon
 The traditional or traditional approach shows state-precedence while the modern approach is process-dominant
 isa purv chhathi sadi se 20veen sadi main lagbhag dwitiya mahayuddh se purv tak jis raajnneetik drushtikon kaa prachlan rahaa he, use adhyayan suvidha kii drushti se 'paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon' kaha jaataa he
 It is also called idealistic or classical approach
 paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhant ke nirmaan va vikaas main anek raajnneetik vichaarkon kaa yogadan rahaa he yatha- plato, arestu, siciro, sant agastin, equinas, lock, ruso, montescue, kant, hegal, green aadi
 Even in the modern era, many scholars are considered supporters of the traditional view such as Leo Strauss, Eric Vogolin, Occott, Hannah Arent, etc
 pracheen yunaan va rome main raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye darshanashastra, nitishastra, tarkshastra, itihaas va vidhi kii avadharanaon ko aadhaar banaaya gaya tha kintu madhyakaal main mukhyatah isai dharamshastreey drushtikon ko raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The Renaissance movement in the 16th century gave rise to intellectual political consciousness as well as the concept of nation-state
 18 veen sadi kii audyogic kranti ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke vikaas ko nai gati pradaan kii
 The glorious revolution of England, the democratic revolutions of France and America developed the traditional political theory as 'liberal democratic political theory'
 paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye mukhyatah darshanik, taarkik naitik, aitihaasik va vidhik paddatiyon ko apanaaya he
 Since the 19th century it has placed special emphasis on legal, constitutional, institutional, descriptive and comparative methods
 20veen sadi ke prarambh se hi paramparaagat drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye ek nai drushti apanaai jo ateet kii tulana main adhik yathartwaadee thi
 In traditional political science, the practice outside the government and its statutory organs emphasized the study of socio-political facts affecting the policies and decisions of the government
 raajnneetik dal evamdababasamoohon ke saath-saath aupchaarik sanghathanon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 It also emphasized the study of social, economic conditions and movements which are clearly outside the formal organization of the government but affect its policies and programs
 ’raajnneeti’ kaa paryaayavachi angreji shabd 'politics' unani bhashaa ke 'polis' shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'nagar’ athwa ’rajya’ he
 In ancient Greece, each city was organized as an independent state, and the term politics reflected the learning of the governance related to those city states
 dhire-dhire nagar rajyon kaa sthaan rashtriya rajyon ne le liya atah raajnneeti bhi rajya ke vistrut rup se sambandhit vidya ho gai
 In the modern era, when the world is leaning towards scientific and systematic study of every subject, the study of subjects related to the state is called political science or political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashae di hai
 These definitions can be interpreted under the following headings: - raajnneeti vigyaan rajya kaa adhyayan he- anek raajnneetishastriyon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se hi raajnneeti vigyaan rajya naamak sanstha ke adhyayan kaa vishay he
 Scholars believe that from ancient times to modern times, the state has been the 'central element' of political science
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to the famous political scientist Blunshli, political science is the science which is related to the state and it tries to understand what is the basic element of the state, what is its essential form, what are its various forms of expression and its development
 How did it happen
 ’ german lekhak garis kaa kathan he ki raajnneeti shaastra main, shakti kii sanstha ke rup main, rajya ke samast sambandhon, uski utpatti, uske moort rup, uske prayojan, uske naitik mahatv, uski aarthik samasyaon, uske astitv kii avasthaaon uske vittiya pahalu, uddheshy aadi par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Garner, "political science begins and ends with the state
" ’’ doctor jakaaria kaa kathan he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra vyavasthit rup main un aadharbhoot siddhanton kaa nirupan karata he jinke anusaar samshti rup main rajya kaa sanghathan hota he or prabhusatta kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 ' uparyukt sabhi paribhaashaon se spasht he ki raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kendriya vishay rajya he
 The reason for this is the belief that has been going on since the time of Plato and Aristotle that the existence of the state is for the achievement of some sacred goals
 raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar kaa adhyayan he - kuch raajnneetishastriyon kii raay main raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa nahin apitu sarkaar kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 They believe that the state is a special organization of human beings and its functional expression is through the government
 unka tark he ki rajya ek amoort sanrachana he jabaki sarkaar ek moort evam pratyaksh sanstha he or sarkaar hi samprabhutaa kaa prayog karti he
 Government is the device of the state by which its purpose and purpose are converted into action
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main sarkaar kaa hi adhyayan hona chaiye
 According to Seele, "political science researches the elements of governance in the same way that property science deals with property, biology of life, arithmetic numbers and geometry of space and length
" ’’ leacock ne is sandarbh main sankshipt evam sargarbhit paribhaasha di he- ‘‘raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar se sambandhit shaastra he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan rajya evam sarkaar donon kaa adhyayan he- paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kuch vidwaanon kii manyata he ki keval rajya yaa keval sarkaar kii drushti se di gai paribhaashae apurna hai
 In fact, the state and the government have a close relationship and in the absence of any one of them, the other cannot be studied
 yadi rajya amoort sanrachana he to sarkaar ise moort va bhautik rup pradaan karti he tathaa isi prakaar yadi rajya prabhusatta ko dhaaran karne vaala he to sarkaar us prabhusatta kaa upbhog karti he
 Hence, both of these should be studied under political science
 paul janet ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan saamaajik vigyaanon kaa vah ang he jisamen rajya ke aadhaar tathaa sarkaar ke siddhanton par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dimock, political science is related to the state and its means to the government
 ’’ gilakraist ne sankshipt paribhaasha dete huye kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan rajya va sarkaar kii saamaanya samasyaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan maanav tatv ke sandarbh main adhyayan he- kuch raajnneetishastri uparokt paribhaashaon ko purna nahin maanate kyonki in paribhaashaon main maanav tatv kii upeksha kii gai he
 They believe that the study of the state or government is aimless and insignificant without human beings, because they have been created for the benefit of human beings, so the study of human elements is mandatory
 professor laski kii anusaar ‘‘raajnneeti shaastra ke adhyayan kaa sambandh sangathit rajyon se sambandhit manushyon ke jivan se he
 Expressing the importance of the human element in the context of political science, in the Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Herman Heller even went on to say that "the all-round nature of political science is determined by its fundamental human beliefs
" ’’ vastutah iskaa arth yah he ki raajnneeti vigyaan ek aisa saamaajik vigyaan he jiske antargat is tathy kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he ki kisi sangathit raajnneetik samaaj main swayan manushya kii sthiti kya he
 Political science studies the policies of the government towards various communities and sections of the society along with the study of the rights and freedoms of the individual
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha ham aise shaastra ke rup main kar sakate he jiskaa sambandh uske rajya naamak sanghathan se hota he or jiske antargat swabhaavatah sarkaar kaa bhi vistrut adhyayan sammilit hota hai sankshep main raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat rajya, sarkaar tathaa anya sambandhit sanghathanon va sansthaaon kaa, maanav ke raajnneetik jivan ke sandarbh main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Traditional definitions related to political science indicate the following trends: jis prakaar raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha vibhinn vichaarkon ne vibhinn prakaar se kii he, usee prakaar uske kshetra ko bhinn-bhinn lekhakon ne vibhinn shabdon main vyakt kiya he
 For example, according to the French thinker Blünschli, "political science deals with the bases of the state
 It studies its essential nature, its diverse forms, its expression and its development
" ’’ dow garnor ke anusaar ’’isaki moulik samasyaon main saadharantah pratham rajya kii utpatti or uski prakruti kaa anusandhan, dwitiya raajnneetik sansthaaon kii pragati, uske itihaas tathaa unke swaroopon kaa adhyayan, tathaa tritiy, jahaan tak sambhav ho, iske aadhaar par rajnatik or vikaas ke niyamon kaa nirdhaaran karnaa sammilit he
 Gatell has written a detailed description of the field of political science, that "historically, political science studies the origins of the state, the development of political institutions and the principles of the past
 


 vartmaan kaa adhyayan karne main yah vidyaman raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa vichaardhaaraon kaa varnan, unki tulana tathaa vargeekaran karne kaa praytn karata he
 For the purpose of making political institutions and activities more advanced on the basis of changing circumstances and moral norms, political science also looks forward to the future and also considers what the state should be like
 ’’ From the above definitions, in the field of political science, three ideologies emerge
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kshetra nirdhaaran karne hetu sanyukt raashtra sangh kii unesco dwaara sitambar 1948 main vishwa ke pramukh raajnneetishastriyon kaa sammelan ayojit kiya gaya jisamen paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshetra ke antargat nimnlikhit adhyayan vishay shaamil kiye jane kaa nirnay kiya gaya- Principles of Politics - Study of political theories and ideas of past and present
 raajnneetik sansthaayen - samvidhan, rashtriya sarkaar, pradeshik va sthaneey shashan kaa saral va tulanaatmak adhyayan
 Political Parties, Groups and Lokmat - a study of the political behavior of political parties and pressure groups, the process of participation of citizens in public opinion and governance
 anterrashtriya sambandh- anterrashtriya raajnneeti, anterrashtriya vidhi, anterrashtriya sanghathan tathaa anterrashtriya prashasan kaa adhyayan
 Traditional political science is based on philosophy and imagination 
 paramparawaadi vichaarak adhikanshtah darshan se prabhavit rahe hai
 These thinkers have paid attention to the values of human life
 inke chintan kii pranali nigamanaatmak he
 Plato has a special significance in traditional political science
 plato ke atirikt roman vichaarak siciro or madhyayug main sant augustin ke chintan main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii spasht jhalak milti hai
 There are a large number of strong supporters of traditional political science in the modern era
 ruso, kant, hegal, green, bosanke, laski, okshot evam leyostros kii rachanaaon main plato ke vichaaron kii spasht jhalak dikhaai detii he
 In the modern period, there has been severe criticism of traditional political science study material and state related beliefs
 aalochakon ke anusaar rajya va raajnneetik sansthaaon kii paridhi se pare bhi kuch prakriyaayein evam ek parivesh dekhne ko miltaa he jiske adhyayan kii upeksha raajnneeti vigyaan kii garima va upyogita ke liye anarthakaari he
 Defenders of this view believe that human behavior is the source of inspiration and study of all social sciences and political science is generally the study of the political aspect of human behavior
 dwitiya mahayuddh se purv katipay raajnneetik vichaarak raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main manushya kii raajnneetik prakriyaaon evam gatividhiyon ko pramukh sthaan diye jane ke prati aagrahashil rahe
 Balter Wagehot, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Bryce, etc
 emphasized realistic studies of politics
 graham vaalas, arthur bentle, ketalin or lasvail ne maanav evam uske vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal diya
 Charles Marriam emphasized the development and use of scientific techniques and methods for the study of political science at the 1925 Conference of the American Political Science Association
 1930 main lasvail ne apni pustak ‘psico-pathology and politics’ main raajnneetik ghatnaon evam kriyaaon kii vyakhya ke liye frid ke manovigyaan ko aadhaar banaaya
 Before the Second World War, the University of Chicago in the United States had become the domain of behavioral political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan se aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan tak kii vikaas prakriya main dwitiya mahayuddh kii ghatana kaa vishesh mahatv he jiske baad kii duniya purv kii duniya se raajnneetik sanrachana, audyogic vikaas, vaigyanik va takneekee uplabdhiyon tathaa sainya kshamta kii drushti se atyadhik bhinn thi
 This serious change took place globally, replacing the traditional concepts of human society and culture, giving rise to new concepts
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat is vaataavaran main charles marium ke apni rachana ’new aspect of politics’main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan hetu naveen evam vaigyanik takneekon ke prayog kaa purna samarthan kiya
 In the above background, in the 1960s, political scientists at the University of Chicago in the United States tried to free political science from the philosophical system and make its study more scientific
 raajnneeti vigyaan ko saamaajik vigyaan maanate huye iske adhyayan ko purna banane hetu samajashaastra, manovigyaan, arthshaastra, maanavshaastra jaise samaaj vigyaanon kii vaigyanik paddatiyon ko apnaanaa uchit samajha
 Among these scientists, David Easton, Caitlin, Lasvale, etc
 are prominent
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii aadhunik avadharanaon kii drushti se george ketalin, david easton, hairald lasvail va kaplan vishesh ullekhneey he
 These scholars have emphasized the real and practical contexts of politics in their political science statements, considering it to be a study of power, influence, political justification and power
 aadhunik drushtikon ke samarthak raajnneeti shastriyon dwaara raajnneeti vigyaan ke bare main jo vichaar prastut kiye hai unako nimnlikhit binduon ke antargat spasht kiya ja saktaa he- Political science is the study of human actions - According to the modern approach of political science, political science studies the political behavior and actions of human beings
 maanav vyavhaar ko gaiyr raajnneetik-kaarak bhi prabhavit karte he
 All these factors are studied in political science
 e
 hard evam es
 hantigton kaa kathan he ’’raajnneetik vyavahaarwad shashan ko maanav or uske samudaayon ke kaaryon kii ek prakriya ke rup main sweekaarta he
 Hasjar and Stevenson hold the view that "political science in its field of study is primarily concerned with the mutual and collective interaction of individuals and the power relations between states and states
" raajnneeti vigyaan shakti kaa adhyayan he- ketalin va lasvail is vichaar ke samarthak he
 The mainstay of both is psychology
 ketalin ne 1927-28 main rajya ke sthaan par manushya ke raajnneetik kriya kalap ke adhyayan par bal dete huye raajnneeti ko prabhutv evam niyantran ke liye kiye jane vaala sangharsh bataaya he
 According to him, the main source of conflict has been the desire of human beings that other people believe in its existence
 1962 main apnipustak systematic politics main ketalin ne likhaa he- niyantran bhaavana ke kaaran jo kaary kiye jate he tathaa niyantran kii bhaavana par aadhaarit sambandhon kii ichchhaaon ke kaaran jis dhaanche va ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan hota he, raajnneeti shaastra kaa sambandh un sabase he
 Another powerful thinker Laswell believes that every person tries to make an impact for the attainment of certain values and valuable persons in the society, and the spirit of power lies in the influence
 atah lasvail ke anusaar 'raajnneeti shaastra kaa abhisht vah raajnneeti he jo batalaaye ki koun, kya, kab or kaise praapt karata he
 According to him, political activity starts from the situation in which the doer tries to achieve different values and power is the necessary condition
 raajnneeti vigyaan raaj-vyavasthaaon kaa adhyayan he- is drushtikon ke samarthak david easton, amand, aar
 kegan aadi he
 This approach defines political science as a sociological approach
 inaki manyata he ki sampoorn samaaj swayan main ek vyavastha he or raaj vyavastha is sampoorn samaaj vyavastha kii ek upvyavastha he tathaa vah uske ek abhinn bhaag ke rup main hoti he
 There are many functional structures in the state system such as constitution, organs of government, political parties, pressure groups, public opinion and election and human behavior is an integral part of this system
 sankshep main in vidwaanon kii manyata he ki raajnneeti vigyaan sampoorn samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raaj-vyavastha kii in sanrachanaon kii parsparik kriyaaon evam sambandhon tathaa maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Political science places more emphasis on the following facts under the study of polity - the study of the political process as part of the overall social order, the structure of the system and the inter-relationship of groups
 raajnneeti vigyaan nirnay prakriya kaa adhyayan he- is drushtikon ke samarthak raajnneetishastri yah maanate he ki raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar kaa adhyayan karte huye samaaj yaa rajya main vidyaman paristhitiyon ke sandarbh main sarkaar yaa shaastra ke niti sambandhi nirnay lene kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 For this reason, political science is a science that studies the policy process and policy making of a government, especially in the context of the factors affecting both of them, this view holds that in the context of human nature, policy making by the government -the process must be studied
 vaastavik raajnneetik jivan main shashan ke naam par nirnay lene kaa kaary swayan vyakti karte hai or isaliye nirnay nirmaan prakriya par nirnayakartaaon ke vyaktitv, abhiruchi samskruti, dharm, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, maansik str nirnay lene kii shakti aadi tatwon kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Hence it can be said that according to the modern view, political science studies the social political life of man
 iske antargat raajnneetik prakriyaaon ke saath saath raajnneetik sanghathanon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Pinock and Smith what is and should be and how to get as much coordination between these two as possible, we call the systematic study of government and political process political science
 aadhunik yug main raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kshetra atyadhik viksit he
 The ubiquity of politics in terms of power and influence has brought it everywhere and not only socially but also almost all aspects of personal life are under the political system
 raajnneeti kii sarvavyaapaktaa ne jahaan ek taraf raajnneetik vyakhyaaon kii lokdharmita siddh kii he vahiin usne raajnneetik kya he, is sambandh main aspashtataa va bhram bhi paidaa kiya hai
 Despite this, the field of political science can be understood well in state and non-state contexts
 rajyapradhan sandarbh main rajya kii avadharanaon- samaajwaad, loktantr ityadi, sarkaar yaa sanghathan samvidhan varnitav vaastavik vyavhaar sambandhi, sarkari pad va sansthaaon ke parsparik sambandh, nirvachan, vyavasthapika va nyaaypalika ke sanghathanaatmak va prayogtmak paksh tathaa rajya kii vyakhya se sambandhit raajnneetik vichaardhaara va avadharanae, utpatti ke, rajya kriyasheeltaa ke siddhanth, rajya-parak vichaardhaaraen swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar ityadi
 In the non-state context, the procedural reality of politics, different views of the political system, non-state institutions such as political parties, pressures and interest groups, non-state processes and their expansion, international political realities and complexities, etc
 come
 pratinidhitiv ke sidwanton va vidhiyon ko bhi isi sandarbh main samajha ja saktaa he
 There are some basic assumptions of the modern approach to the field of political science, such as the adoption of a realistic approach in determining the field of study, the subject matter of political science should be understood under an inter-disciplinary approach, the scientific method and approaches in the study of political science Be used
 aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshentra ko nimna binduon ke antargat spasht kiya ja saktaa he- Study of political behavior of human- Modern approach emphasizes the study of political behavior of human
 yadhyapi par maanav vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne balki gaiyr-raajnneetik tatwon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he uski manyata he ki maanav vyavhaar ko yatharth rup main samajhane ke liye un sabhi gaiyr raajnneetik bhaawanaaon, manyataon evam shaktiyon ke adhyayan ko sammilit kiya jaye jo maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte he
 Study of various concepts - Modern political science mainly studies power, influence, power, control, decision process etc
 is drushtikon ke anusaar ye aisi avadharanaai he jinaki prishthbhumi main hi raajnneetik sansthaae kaary karti he
 Political scientists study political institutions in the context of these concepts
 isi kaaran is prakaar ke adhyayan ko sattaaon kaa anaupchaarik adhyayan kaha gaya he
 Study of Political Science Problems and Conflicts - Modern political scientists such as Professors Dyck and Peter Odgaard cover political science in the field of study of public problems and conflicts
 unke mat main mulyon evam sadhano kii simitta ke kaaran unke vitaran kii samasya paidaa hone se tanaav va raajnneeti kaa prarambh ho jaataa he
 Apart from political parties, it spreads to various individuals and groups
 professor daayak ne raajnneeti ko saarvajanik samasyaon par paraspar virdohi ichchhaaon vaale paatro ke sangharsh kii raajnneeti kaha he
 Peter Odiegard believes that there should be no control of externalities other than politics in this struggle
 saarvajanik sahmati va saamaanya abhimath kaa adhyayan - kuch vidwaanon ke mat main raajnneeti vigyaan saarvajanik samasyaon par sahmati va saamaanya abhimath kaa adhyayan he
 In his view, the struggle is not only for the struggle but to influence the general consensus and general opinion
 isiliye edward weinfield ne kaha he ki ‘kisi masale ko sanghariumay banane athwa sulajhane vaali gatividhiyon sabhi raajnneeti kaa ang he
 '' uparokt vishleshan se spasht he ki aadhunik drushtikon ke viddhanon main raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshetra ke sambandh main kuch matbhed hone ke baavjood kuch aadharbhoot baton par sahmati he, jaise sabhi kii manyata he ki raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan kshetra yathartwaadee ho, iske adhyayan main antar-anushaasanamak drushtikon va vaigyanik paddati kaa prayog hona chahie
 However, it is true that the claim of scientific authenticity and certainty of modern political scientists in political science has not yet been fulfilled
 isi kaaran pinok evam smith ne aadhunik drushtikon main kuch sanshodhan ko sweekaar karte hue raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke saath hi raajnneetik sansthaaon ke sanghathanaatmak evam moolyaatmak adhyayan ko uchit sthaan dene kii baat kahi he According to Aristotle, man is a social animal
 saamaajik jivan ke samast aayam uski jivan style ko sampann karte hai
 All the regulatory subjects of these dimensions are interconnected and continuously operational on the axis of standard life
 raajnneeti in sabhi ayaamon ko samanvit karne kaa mahatvapurn kaary karti he
 Due to the close proximity of political science and other social sciences, there has been a tradition of inter-disciplinary study in the study of political science since ancient times
 pracheen unani vichaarak plato, arestu kii rachanaaon main darshan va achaarshastra se raajnneeti kii ghanishthata spasht hoti he

 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was an obstacle in accepting a close relationship between political science and other social sciences because in this period various sciences were emphasized to consider themselves as complete and independent sciences

 No one can do proper and holistic study of a social science society
 isliye tamaam samajashaastra aapas main sambandhit hai or antarshastreey adhyayan paddati ne phir se samajashastron ke is sambandh ko ubhaar diya he
 Today, the opening of new branches of political science, such as political economics, political ethics, political history, political sociology, political psychology, and political geography, is a symbol of the fact that political science cannot operate without establishing relations with other social sciences

 Despite being a Muslim by birth, the poignant facts Rahim had written while sitting within the heart of Hindu life, show his immense heart

 Abdurrahim Khankhana was born in 1613 AD in history Lahore, home of the famous Bairam Khan
 sanyog se us samay humayun sikandar suri kaa akraman kaa pratirodh karne ke liye sainya ke saath lahore main maujuud the
 Hearing the news of the birth of Bairam Khan's son, he himself went there and named the child "rahim"
 rahim ke pita bairam khan teraa varshiya akbar ke atali tathaa abhibhavak the
 Bairam Khan was conferred with the title of khan-e-khana
 ve humayun ke sadhu or antarang mitra the
 Rahim's mother was Sultana Begum, a beautiful and quality girl from Jamal Khan, a Mewati Rajput in present-day Haryana province
 jab rahim paanch varsh ke hi the, tab gujarat ke patan nagar main san 1561 main inke pita bairam khan kii hatya kar di gai
 Rahim was raised by Akbar like his son
 shahi khandaan kii paramparanuroop rahim ko 'mirza khan' kaa kitaab diya gaya
 Rahim studied intensively under the supervision of Baba Jambur
 shiksha samaapt hone par akbar ne apni dhai kii beti mahabaano se rahim kaa vivaah kara diya
 After this, Rahim won wars in Gujarat, Kumbhalner, Udaipur etc
 is par akbar ne apane samay kii sarvocch oopaadhi 'miorj' se rahim ko vibhooshit kiya
 In 1584, Akbar honored Rahim with the title of khan-e-khana
 rahim kaa dehanth 71 varsh kii aayu main san 1627 main hua
 Rahim was buried near his wife's mausoleum in Delhi as per his wish
 yah mazaar aaj bhi dilli main maujuud hai
 Rahim himself built it during his lifetime
 humayun ne yuvaraj akbar kii shiksha-deeksha ke liye bairam khan ko chunaa or apane jivan ke antim dinon main rajya kaa prabandh kii jimmedaari dekar akbar kaa abhibhavak niyukt kiya tha
 Bairam Khan gave full support in strengthening Akbar's kingdom with efficient policy
 kisi karanvash bairam khan or akbar ke bich matbhed ho gaya
 Akbar successfully suppressed the rebellion of Bairam Khan and expressed his desire to go on Haj, keeping the honor and honor of his master
 parinamswarup bairam khan haj ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 Bairam Khan stayed in Patan, Gujarat, and sat on the beach after boating at Patan's famous Sahasraling Sarovar, with the intention of offering an Afghan chieftain Mubarak Khan and deceitfully killed Bairam Khan
 yah mubarak khan ne apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye kiya
 This incident made Bairam Khan's family an orphan
 in dhokhebaajon ne sirf katl hi nahin kiya, balki kaaphi lutpaat bhi machaaya
 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court
 aise samay main akbar ne apane mahanata kaa saboot dete hue inako badi udaartaa se sharan diya or rahim ke liye kaha “ise sab prakaar se prasann rakho
 He must not know that his father, Khan Khana is no more
 baba jambur ko kaha yah hamaara betaa he
 Put it in front of our eyesight
 is prakaar akbar ne rahim kaa paalan- poshan ekadam dharm- putr kii bhaanti kiya
 a few days later, Akbar married widow Sultana Begum
 akbar ne rahim ko shahi khandaan ke anurup “mirza khan’ kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim's education - initiation was in accordance with Akbar's liberal secular policy
 isi shiksha-diksha ke kaaran rahim kaa kavy aaj bhi hindooon ke gale kaa kaniihaar bana hua he
 According to Dinkar Ji's statement, Rahim gave many times more space in his poems than the place Akbar gave to Hinduism in his deen-elahi
 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the
 New people were appointed to this post every two-three days
 samraat akbar ne is pad kaa kaam- kaaj sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye apane sachche tathaa vishwaas paatr amir rahim ko mustakil mir arj niyukt kiya
 The whole court was stunned upon hearing this decision
 is pad par asin hone kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti janata evam samraat donon main saamaanya rup se vishwasaneey he
 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education
 in mahaan logon main sher ahamed, mir kalaan or darbari vidwaan abulfjal the
 Despite the efforts of all the people, Shahzada Salim did not mind studying
 akbar ne sadaa kii tarah apana aakhri hathiyaar rahim khaane khaanaa ko saleem kaa atali niyukt kiya
 It is said that Rahim was very happy to get this glory
 rahim ne avadhi or brajabhasha donon main hi kavita kii he jo saral, swaabhaavik or pravahpurn he
 In his poetry, there is adornment, calm and humor
 doha, soratha, barbai, kavitt or savaiya unke priy chand hai
 Rahim Dohavali, Barwai, heroine Bhide, Madanashtak, Raas Panchadhyayi, Nagar Shobha etc
