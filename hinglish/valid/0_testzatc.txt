 aluminium shwet rang kii ek dhaatu he
 The Latin word alumen and the English word alum mean alum
 is fitkaree main se jo dhaatu pruthak kii ja saki, uskaa naam aluminium padaa
 Our introduction to alum is very old
 kankshi, tuvari or saurashtraj iske puraane naam he
 Alum is in fact a double compound of both potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate
 san 1754 main margraph ne yah pradarshit kiya ki jis mitti ko alumina kaha jaataa he, vah chooney se bhinn he
 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification
 europe main bhi lagbhag isi varsh hero ne swatantra rup se isi prakaar yah dhaatu taiyaar kii
 The same hall-hero method is being used in the production of this metal nowadays

 Here at least three methods are given with minor changes which are called boreal compilation

 boral sankalan kii ek durbal vidhi a kaa boral yoga nimna prakaar paribhaashit karti he If it is differentiated at z ∈ c for some a, then the weak boreal sum of a converges to z and is called ∑ akzk = a { \ displaystyle { \ textstyle \ sum} a_ {k} z ^ {k} = a \ ,} Writes
 mana kisi falan ke liye sabhi vaastavik sankhyaon par boral sankalan paryaapt rup se dhire-dhire badhata he ki nimna samakalan suparibhaashit he tab a kaa boral sankalan nimna sutara se diya jaataa he If the integral converges at z ∈ c for some a, then convergence of a converges at z and is called ∑ akzk = a { \ displaystyle { \ textstyle \ sum} a_ {k} z ^ {k} = a \ , } Is written

 The last Kumbh in Haridwar took place in 1998
 haridwar main 26 janvari se 14 may 2004 tak chalaa tha ardh kumbh mela, uttaranchal rajya ke gathan ke pashchaat aisa pratham avasar tha
 During this, 14 April 2004 was considered the most auspicious day for the holy bath
 puranic vishwaas jo kuch bhi ho, jyotishiyon ke anusaar kumbh kaa asaadhaaran mahatv brihaspati ke kumbh raashi main pravesh tathaa surya ke mesh raashi main pravesh ke saath judaa he
 The position of the planets medicates the Ganges water at Har ki Pauri place on the banks of the Ganges flowing from Haridwar and it becomes nectaric in those days
 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation
 haalaanki sabhi hindu tyohaar samaan shraddha or bhakthi ke saath manaae jate he, par yahan ardh kumbh tathaa kumbh meley ke liye aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya sabase adhik hoti he
 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell
 mahakumbh 2013 snaan ke liye kumbh main jo din vishesh hai wo is prakaar hai - Parkinson's disease is a disease of the central nervous system in which the patient's body parts keep vibrating
 parkinsonism kaa armbh aahista-aahista hota he
 i do not even know when the symptoms started
 anek saptahon va maheenon ke baad jab lakshanon kii tivrata bad jaati he tab ahsaas hota he ki kuch gadabad he
 When the doctors scrape the history, the patients and the family look back and remember that yes these symptoms were already present with less intensity
 lekin taarikh bataanaa sambhav nahin hota
 Sometimes these symptoms are added to a specific event - for example an accident, injury, fever etc
 yah sanyogvash hota he
 The said immediate event leads the patient's attention to the symptoms of Parkinsonism, which were already slowly making their presence known
 bahut saare marijon main parkinsonism rog kii shuruuaat kampan se hoti he
 Vibration means dhugeni or dhuzan or tremor or trembling
 parkinson kisi ko tab hota he jab rasayan paidaa karne vaali mastishk kii koshikaaye gaayab hone lagati hai The beginning of parkinsonism is slowly
 pataa bhi nahin pasta ki kab lakshan shuru hue
 After several weeks and months, when the intensity of symptoms increases, then there is a feeling that there is something wrong
 doctor jab history kuredate hai tab marij va gharavaale peeche mud kar dekhte hai yaad karte hai or sweekaarte hai ki haa sachmuy ye kuch lakshan, kam tivrata ke saath pehle se maujuud the
 But it is not possible to give the date
 kabhi-kabhi kisi vishisht ghatana se in lakshanon kaa armbh jod diya jaataa he - udhaaharan ke liye koi durghatana, chot, bukhaar aadi
 It happens by chance
 ukt taatkaalik ghatana ke kaaran marij kaa dhyaan parkinsonism ke lakshanon kii ore chalaa jaataa he jo ki dhire-dhire pehle se hi apni maujuudagi bana rahe the
 In many patients, parkinsonism starts with tremor
 kampan arthath dhoojani yaa dhujan yaa trimur yaa kaanpana
 One wrist or more fingers of hand, wrist of hand, arm
 pehle kam rahata he
 Sometimes it happens
 ruk ruk kar hota he
 Later it stays longer and also affects other organs
 praayah ek hi ore rahata he, parantu anek marijon main, baad main donon ore hone lagata he
 When the hand rests on the table or on the knee, on the ground or on a chair, this vibration is seen
 barik sadhe hue kaam karne main dikkat aane lagati he, jaise ki likhnaa, batan lagaana, daadhee bananaa, moonch ke bal kaatna, sui main dhaagaa pirona
 After some time, the foot on the same side is affected
 kampan yaa usase adhik mahatvapurn, baaripan yaa dhimaapan ke kaaran chalate samay vah pair ghistata he, dhire uthta he, der se uthta he, kam uthta he
 Slowness permeates all activities
 chaal dhimi / kaam dhimaa
 The strength of the muscles of the body is not reduced, it is not paralyzed
 parantu sughadta va phurti se kaam karne kii kshamta kam hoti jaati he
 There is a hitch in the arms and legs
 marij ko baaripan kaa ahsaas ho saktaa he
 But the doctors are able to identify Jakadan better - when the patient is able to bend and straighten the hands and feet, there is a lot of resistance
 marij jaanboojh kar nahin kar rahaa hota
 Jakadan resistance remains on its own
 khadey hote samay va chalate samay marij sidhaa tan kar nahin rahata
 Lean forward slightly
 ghutane va kuhani bhi thode mude rahete hai
 The steps are small
 paanv jameen main ghistate hue aawaaj karte hai
 Steps arise less and there is a tendency to fall

 Software testing is an empirical search, whereby stakeholders are made aware of the quality of the product or service under test, in the context where it is intended to be used
 software pareekshan, udyog ko software ke karyanvayan main jokhim ko samajhane or saraahna karne kii anumati dene ke liye, software kaa uddeshy or swatantra avlokan bhi pradaan karata he
 Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of execution of a program or application with the intention of finding software bugs
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki software pareekshan vah prakriya he, jo yah vidhimaanya or satyapit karti he ki ek software program / anuprayog / utpaada: Depending on the test method employed, software testing can be implemented at any time in the development process
 baharhaal, test ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Different software development models focus the test effort at different stages in the development process
 ek adhik paaramparik model main, pareekshan ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Relatively new development models, such as Agile or XP, often use development-driven testing and assign a greater share of testing to the developer in the development process
 pareekshan, puri tarah se software ke bheetar sabhi dosha kii pahchaan nahin kar saktaa he
 Instead, it presents a critique or comparison that compares the status and behavior of the product to the norm — the principle or system by which a person can identify a problem
 in pramaniktaaon main shaamil ho sakate hai vinirdesan, anubandh, tulaneey utpaada, usee utpaada kaa pichhlaa sanskaran, niyat yaa apekshit uddeshyon kaa anumaan, upyogkarta yaa graahak kii apekshaayen, upyukt maanak, prayojya niyam, yaa anya maandand
 Every software product has a target audience
 udhaaharan ke liye, video game software ke darshak, banking software se puri tarah se alag he
 Therefore, when an organization develops or invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its buyers and other stakeholders
 software pareekshan is moolyankan ke prayaas kii prakriya he

 Initially, the separation of debugging from testing was attributed to Glenford J
 Promoted by Myers in 1979
 haalanki unka dhyaan bracoge pareekshan par tha isane software ejineering samudaay kii buniyadi vikaas gatividhiyon, jaise dibging ko satyaapan se alag karne kii ichha kii pushti kii
 Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel classified the phases and goals in software testing in 1988 into the following stages: pareekshan kaa ek praathmik uddeshy, software vifaltaaon kaa pataa lagaana he, taaki dosha ko khoja or sudhara ja sake
 This is a non-negligible finding
 pareekshan yah sthapit nahin kar saktaa ki ek utpaada sabhi paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaary kar rahaa he, par sirf itnaa sthapit kar saktaa he ki yah kin vishisht paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaam nahin karata he
 The scope of software testing often includes the execution of that code in various environments and situations, as well as the investigation of aspects of that code, in addition to the examination of the code: whether it does what it should and what it does, what it does This needs to be done
 software vikaas kii vartmaan samskruti main ek pareekshan sanghathan, vikaas dal se alag ho saktaa he
 There are different roles for members of the test team
 software pareekshan se praapt jaankaree kaa prayog, us prakriya ko sahi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara software kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Functional testing refers to a test that verifies a specific action or function of the code
 ye aam taur par code kii aavashyaktaaon ke pralekhan main paaya jaataa he, haalanki kuch vikaas prakriya, prayukt maamle yaa upyogkarta khabaron se kaam karte hai
 Functional tests answer the question "can the user do it" or "does this particular feature work"
 non-functional pareekshan, software ke un pahaluon ko darshata he, jo sambhav he ki kisi vishesh prakaarya yaa upyogkarta kii kriya, jaise arohan yaa suraksha se sambandhit naa hon
 non-functional pareekshan is tarah ke sawaalon kaa jawaab detaa he ki "ek baar main kitne log log in kar sakate hai", yaa "is software ko hack karnaa kitna aasaan he"
 Not all software flaws are caused by code errors
 mahange dosha kaa ek aam strot, apekshaaon ke interval ke kaaran panapata he, udhaaharan he, aparichit apekshaayen, jo program diziner dwaara vilopan kii trutiyon main falit hote hai
 a common source of expectation interval is non-functional expectation, such as testability, mountability, maintenance capacity, usability, performance, and security
 software dosha nimnlikhit prakriyaaon ke madhyam se hote hai
 The programmer makes an error, which results in a malfunction in the source code of the software
 yadi is karaabi ko nishpadit kiya jaataa he, to kuch khaas sthitiyon main system trutipurn parinaam degaa, jo ek vifaltaa kaa kaaran banegaa
 Not all faults will necessarily result in failure
 udhaaharan ke liye, ded code main dosha, kabhi vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 When the environment is changed, a breakdown can turn into a failure
 pariveshgat in parivartanon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, software kaa ek nae hardware platform par chalaaya janaa, sorce data main parivartan yaa bhinn software ke saath parsparik kriya
 ek ekal truti, vifaltaa ke vistrut lakshan main parinat ho sakati he
 It is generally believed that the earlier a malfunction is discovered, the cheaper it is to fix
 nimnlikhit talika, karaabi ke pataa lagaae jane vaale charan ke aadhaar par, use thik karne kii laagat ko darshaati he
 For example, if a problem with expectations is revealed only after release, then the cost will be 10–100 times more than the cost of detection by reviewing the expectations
 software vifaltaa kaa ek aam kaaran, anya anuprayog, ek nae oparating system, yaa, badhate hue web brouzar sanskaran ke saath sangatta he
 In the case of a lack of backwards compatibility, this may be because the programmer considered testing their program's coding or software only on the "latest version" of this-and-that operating system
 is tathy kaa anayas nateeja yah he ki: unka naveenatam kaary, software / hardware ke purv mishran ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin bhi ho saktaa he, yaa yah ek anya mahatvapurn oparating system ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin ho saktaa he
 In any case, these differences, whatever they may be, would have resulted in software failure, as realized by some significant sections of computer users
 ise ek "suraksha unmukh ranneeti" maan sakate hai, jo ki dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel dwaara sujhaaye naveenatam parikshan charan ke saath sateek baithta he, jaisaa ki neeche uddhrut he
 
 software pareekshan ke saath ek mukhya samasya he ki input or pre-condishan ke saare combination ke antargat pareekshan sambhav nahin he, yahan tak ki ek saamaanya utpaada ke saath bhi nahin
 This means that the number of defects in a software product can be quite high and the defects that occur occasionally are difficult to find in testing
 adhik mahatvapurn rup se, gunvattta ke gair-kaaryaatmak aayam - upyog-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, nishpaadan, sangatta, vishwasaneeyata-atyant vyaktiparak ho sakate hai; kuch aisa, jo ek vyakti ke liye paryaapt mulya kaa gathan karata he, jo duusare ke liye asahneeya he
 There are several approaches to software testing
 samiksha, aar-paar guzaarana, yaa nirikshan ko static pareekshan mana jaataa he, jabaki die gaye ek pareekshan maamle ke set ke saath vaastavik nishpadit program code dinemic pareekshan mana jaataa he
 Static testing can be omitted
 dinemic pareekshan tab prayukt hota he, jab khud program ko hi pehali baar prayog kiya ja rahaa ho 
 Dynamic testing can begin to test specific parts of the code before 100% completion of the program
 iske liye vishisht takanic hai stabs / drivers kaa prayog karnaa yaa phir ek dibgar parivesh se nishpaadan
 udhaaharan ke liye, spredshit program, khud apni prakruti dwaara, kaaphi had tak paraspar rup se jaanche jate hai, jiske tahat parinaam, prayek gananaa yaa text parichaalan ke turant baad pradarshit hote hai
 Software testing is used in association with verification and authentication: satyaapan or pramanikaran shabd kaa aam taur par prayog, udyog main antar-parivartanshiltaa se kiya jaataa he; in donon shabdon ko galat tareeke se paribhaashit karnaa bhi aam he
 According to the standard terminology of IEEE Software Engineering: software pareekshan software tester dwaara kii ja sakati he
 The term "software tester" was commonly used until the 1980s, but was later seen as a separate business
 software pareekshan main avadhiyon or vibhinn lakshyon se sambandhit vibhinn bhoomikaaon ko sthapit kiya gaya he: manager, test lead, test diziner, tester, automation develper or test administrator Although controversial, software testing can be seen as an important part of the software quality assurance process
 SQA main, software prakriya visheshgy or lekha pareekshak, software or uske vikaas par ek vyapak drushtikon rakhte hai
 They investigate the software engineering process and replace it to reduce the amount of defects in the software provided: the so-called defect rate
 ek "sweekaarya dosha dar" kaa gathan karne vaali chizein software kii prakruti par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, in an arcade video game designed to give the impression of flying an airplane, it would likely have a relatively greater tolerance for faults, compared to mission critical software used to control an airliner
 Happens, which is actually flying
 yadhyapi SQA ke saath ghanishtha sambandh hai, pareekshan vibhaag aksar swatantra rup se kaary karte hai or ho saktaa he ki kisi company main SQA kaa koi kaary naa ho
 Software testing is the task of detecting defects in software by comparing the expected results of a computer program to a given input set, compared to its actual results
 virodhabhas swaroop, QA, darasal hone vaali trutiyon ko rokane ke uddeshy se nitiyon or prakriyaaon kaa karyanvayan he
 Software testing methods have traditionally been divided into black box testing and white box testing
 in donon abhigmon kaa prayog us drushtikon ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ek test ejeeniyar test maamalon kii digining ke liye apanaataa he
 Black box testing treats the software as a "black box" - black box testing methods without any internal implementation information include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all pairs testing, fudge testing, model-based Testing, traceability metrics, exploratory testing and specification-based testing
 isliye, blike box pareekshan main ek ore "ek asambaddh raay" kaa phayda he or duusari ore "andhi talash" kaa nuksaan
 White box testing occurs when the tester has access to algorithms, including internal data structures and the code that implements it
 ve donon ek code kawarej metric ko lautaate hai, jise pratishat ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Gray box testing involves access to internal data structures and algorithms to design test cases, but at the user, or black box level
 Changing input data and formatting output do not fall under the gray box, since input and output are clearly out of the "black-box" that we are calling the system under test
 yah antar vishesh rup se tab mahatvapurn he, jab do alag developers dwaara likhe code ke do modulon ke bich integration pareekshan sampadit kii jaati he, jahaan pareekshan ke liye sirf interphes ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 However, modifying a data repository must fall under the gray box, since typically the user will not be able to change data outside the system under test

 Tests are often classified based on their place of involvement in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test
 unit pareekshan un pareekshanon ko sanderbhit karata he, jo code ke ek vishesh khand kii kaaryashiltaa, aam taur par prakriya str par, satyapit karte hai
 In an object-oriented environment, this often occurs at the category level and involves minimal unit testing of constructors and destructors
 is prakaar ke pareekshan aam taur par developers dwaara likhe jate hai, jab ve code par kaam kar rahe hote hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek vishesh prakriya apekshanuroop thik dhang se kaam kar rahi he
 To catch corner cases or other branches in the code, a process may have multiple tests
 unit pareekshan akele, software ke ek ansh kii kaaryakshmata ko satyapit nahin kar sakati, balki iskaa prayog yah sunishchit karne ke liye hota he ki software dwaara prayukt building block, ek duusare se swatantra rup se kaary karte hai
 Integration testing is any type of software test that attempts to verify interfaces between components against a software design
 software ghatak ko, punraritiya tareeqe se yaa ek saath ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The earlier approach is generally considered a better practice, as it allows interface issues to be quickly localized and fixed
 integration pareekshan, interphes main trutiyaan ujagar karne or ekikrut ghatak ke bich parsparik kriya ko darshane ke liye kaam karata he
 Progressively, large clusters of tested software components are integrated and tested to fit the elements of architectural design until the software begins to function as a system
 system pareekshan yah satyapit karne ke liye ek puri tarah se ekikrut system kaa pareekshan karata he ki vah apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he
 System Integration Testing confirms that a system is integrated with any external or other party systems defined in the system requirements
 regration pareekshan ek pramukh code parivartan ke baad dosha ko khojane par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 In particular, it attempts to uncover software regression or older bugs that have returned
 jab bhi software prakriya, jo pehle sahi dhang se kaam kar rahi thi or ab apekshanusaar kaary karnaa band kar de, tab aise pratigaman ghatit hote hai
 Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program change when the newly developed part of the software collides with already existing code
 regration pareekshan ke aam tareekon main shaamil he, pehle chalaae gaye pareekshan ko phir se chalaanaa or jaanch karnaa ki pehle thik kii gai kharabiyaan kahin phir se ubhar to nahin ai hai
 The depth of the test depends on the stage in the release process and the risk of additional features
 They can be either complete, for changes added too late in the release or risky, too shallow, made up of positive testing at each feature if the changes are happening early in release or are considered low risk Let's go
 exeptence pareekshan kaa taatpary do main se ek se ho saktaa he: Alpha testing is mock or real operational testing by potential users / customers or an independent test team on the developer's site
 software ke beta pareekshan main jane se pehle, alpha pareekshan ko aksar of-da-shelf software ke liye aantarik sweekruti pareekshan ke ek rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Beta testing comes after alpha testing
 beta sanskaran ke naam se vikhyath software kaa sanskaran, programing team se baahar ek simit graahakon ke liye jari kiya gaya
 The software is released to groups of people, so that further testing can be done to ensure that the product has minimal faults or bugs
 kabhi-kabhi, beta sanskaran ko bhavi upyogkartaaon kii adhiktam sankhya ko pratikriya ke kshetra ko badhaane ke liye, khuli janata ke liye uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 non-functional aspects of software 
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan ke vipareet, jo software ke sahi sanchaalan ko sthapit karata he, gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan is baat kii pushti karata he ki software tab bhi thik dhang se kaary karata he, jab ise avaidh yaa apratyaashit input praapt hoti he
 Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of a non-functional test
 gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan, vishesh rup se software kii khatir, yah sthapit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he ki pareekshan ke antargat rachana, avaidh yaa anpekshit input ko sahan kar sakati he yaa nahin or is prakaar ve input vailidation routine or saath hi saath erar-handlling routine kii majbootee ko sthapit kar sakenge
 Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked to the software fault injection page; Many open source and free software tools are available, which perform non-functional testing
 parformens pareekshan, yaa lod pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software, badi maatra main data yaa upyogkartaaon ko sambhaal saktaa he yaa nahin
 This is generally known as software scalability
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar kshamta pariksha ke rup main jaani jaati he
 Stability testing checks to see if the software can function consistently well over or above an acceptable period
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar lod pareekshan ke rup main nirdisht hoti he
 Usability testing is needed to test whether the user interface is easy to use and understand
 suraksha pareekshan us software ke liye jaruri he jo havers dwaara system ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye gopneey data ko parishkrut karata he
 Internationalization and localization are needed to examine these aspects of software, for which a pseudostabilization method can be used
 yah is baat kii pushti karegaa ki anuprayog, ek nai bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jane yaa ek nai samskruti ke liye anukulit kiye jane ke baad bhi kaam karata he
 Destructive testing attempts to thwart software or subsystems to test its robustness
 software pareekshan ke ek aam tareeke ko, ise graahak ko bheje jane se pehle or isaki kaaryakshmata viksit kiye jane ke baad, pareekshakon ke ek swatantra samooh dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays and thus compromise the time devoted to testing
 ek or paripati he pariyojna ke shuru hone ke kshan hi software pareekshan ko shuru kar dena or pariyojna ke samaapan tak yah ek satat prakriya he
 In response, some emerging software disciplines such as Extreme Programming and Agile Software Development Movement follow a "test drive software development" model
 is prakriya main, software ejeeniyar dwaara unit test pehle likhe jate hai, 
 beshak ye pareekshan shuru main vifal ho jate hai; jaise ki unase ummid rahati he
 And then as the code is written it passes incrementally to a larger fraction of the test suite
 test sweet ko, vifaltaa kii nai paristhitiyon or corner cese ke milte rahane ke kaaran, lagaataar navinikrut kiya jaataa he or unhen kisi bhi viksit regration test ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Unit tests along with the rest of the software source code are maintained and typically integrated into the build process

 This article discusses the phases of this movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly of the South
 By 1966, the Black Power Movement emerged, largely from 1966 to 1975, broadening the objectives of the civil rights movement and encompassing racial pride, economic and political self-reliance, and liberation from oppression by white Americans

 As in mccomb, his efforts were fiercely opposed - arrests, beatings, shootings, arson and murder
 The registrar used literacy checks to keep blacks from playing a role in voting and created a standard under which even highly educated people were unable to meet their conditions
 Additionally, the employers excluded blacks who tried to register and the landlords evicted them from their homes
 a few years later, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state

 As gaining a unique identity, blacks started wearing fitted dashiki and growing their hair as natural Africans
