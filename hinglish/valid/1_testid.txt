 In most textbooks a race is a "real and potentially inter-breed natural population group" that is set apart as other such breeding groups
 is paribhaasha ke vibhinn bhaagon jaise kuch asaamaanya yaa kritrim samagam isse baahar rakhe gaye hai: The definition in the above ideal textbook works well for multi-cellular animals, but there are some situations where they can be ruled out as inappropriate: kshaitijiya jin sthanantaran shabd "jati" paribhaashit karne ko or bhi jatil bana dete hai
 There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between unequal groups of the prokerat group and, at least often, unequal groups of eukaryates, and Williamson argues that there is some evidence available of this in crustaceans and echinoderms

 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals that cause asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently
 phir bhi, anguuthe ke niyam kii sthapana yah kehete hue kii gai ki ve ek duusare se 97% se adhik samaan 16S rrna jin kram bacteria yaa orchia kii jaanch DNA-DNA sankaran dwaara kii jaani chahie chahen vah samaan jati se sambandhit hon athwa nahin
 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98
7%
 yon rup se paidaa hone vaale jeevon, jahaan par jin sambandhi saamagree ko prajnan sambandhi prakriya main saajha kiya jaataa he, to do praaniyon ke antar janan prakriya or donon lingon ke sankar vansh samaan sanketak ke rup main sweekaar kiye jate hai ki praaniyon ne samaan jati ke sadsy ke rup main prachur jeenon ko apanaaya he
 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures
 donon paristhitiki or saamaajik aarthik jatiyaan jivan ke liye sahaayak jatiyaan hai
 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand
 kabhi-kabhi, khaskar jab ateet main sanchaar bahut adhik mushkil tha, to algaav par kaary karne vaale vargeekaran vaigyanikon ne alag-alag jantuon ko alag-alag naam die jinaki pahchaan baad main ek samaan jati ke rup main kii gai
 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals

 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example
 kachhue ko aanvik str par anya sarisrup kii gati ke maatr aathven bhaag ke saath viksit hone ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya or albatras main aanvik vikaas kii dar storm-petrals kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi hi pai jaati he
 Obsolete hybridization techniques are available nowadays and are replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparisons
 anvik vargeekaran sidhe vikasvaadi prakriyaaon par aadhaarit nahin he, balki in prakriyaaon dwaara samgr parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Processes that represent generation and diversity maintenance such as change, process of change, and selection are not homogenous

 Dasharatha Manjhi came from a very backward area and belonged to the Dalit caste

 " inhone apane kaam ko 22 varshon main puraa kiya
 This road reduced the distance of Atri and Wazirganj sectors of Gaya from 55 km to 15 km
 maanjhi kaa prayaas kaa mazaaq udaaya gaya par unke is prayaas ne gehalaur ke logon ke jivan ko saral bana diya
 Although they cut a safe mountain, which is punishable according to the Indian Wildlife Protection Act and they also sold stones of this mountain, yet their efforts are commendable

 bhagavadgita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he or bhagavadgita ke antim adhyay main die upadesh ko dharm samvaad kaha he
 Religion means 1- One who holds 2- One who holds
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha jaataa he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The meaning of religion in the Bhagavad Gita is living nature, that is nature, Kshetra means body
 bhagavadgita ke anya prasangon main isi kii pushti hoti he
 For example, 'swadharma Vyatam Shreya: Par Dharma: Pardharma: Horrible', staying in your nature, dying in it is considered a welfare factor
 yah dharm shabd gita shaastra main atyaadhik mahatvapurn he
 Sri Bhagavan has described the ultimate credible religion for ordinary human beings to live a life based on self-righteousness
 maharishi vyas brahmagyani the
 From his point of view, Dharma means soul and Kshetra means body

 Religion, that is, the one who has attained selfhood, where God is present in the form of God, it must have been in the mind of Brahmarshi Vyas ji
 Therefore, the use of the word Dharma Kshetra in the Bhagavad Gita by Vyas Ji has used the word Dharmakshetra, taking cognizance of the living spirit of Shri Krishna Chandra and Dhritarashtra, who hold the universe

 References - Basanteshwari Bhagavad Gita - Pro Basant sanskrit kaa sabase pracheen vyakaran 'vaidic vyakaran' kehalaata he
 This was somewhat different from Paninian grammar
 sanskrit main likhit brihad sahitya ke mukhyatah do khand hai - vaidic sahitya or loukik sahitya
 There are mainly five divisions of Vedic literature- kalpasutra jo pradhantah teen prakaar ke hai, These three types of sutras are taken under 'kalpasutra'
 inke atirikt hai- shulvasutra jo yagyavedi sambandhi rekhanit roopon kaa niyojan karte hai or is kaaran kabhi-kabhi kalpasutron ke hi bheetar gine jate hai
 Apart from the above mentioned Kalpasutras, there are other texts which are related to sound, science, grammar, verses and constellation
 yah granth vedangon main pariganit hote hai
 These texts are also found in sutra-style and their time is the treatise of Vedic and secular Sanskrit
 loukik sanskrit-sahitya kaa vaidic sahitya se anek prakaar kaa bhed paaya jaataa he
 Vedic literature is purely religious and it contains the seeds of all cosmic elements
 loukik sanskrit sahitya pradhan rup se dharmik-dharmanirpeksh, athwa dharm main ise lok-paralok se hi sambandhit kaha ja saktaa he
 Epics, Puranas and other poetic dramas, ornamentation, philosophy, sutras, method or manuals, Vastushastra, medicine, mathematics, machines and industries related to medicine and branches of various other disciplines are also found in this literature
 loukik sahitya kii bhashaa tathaa vaidic sahitya kii bhashaa main bhi antar paaya jaataa he
 The word form and metallicity of the two are different in many ways
 vaidic sanskrit ke rup keval bhinn hi nahin hai apitu anek bhi hai, vishishtatya ve rup jo kriya roopon tathaa dhaatuon ke swaroop se sambandhit hai
 Following are some important differences of both the literature in this regard: - shabdarup kii drushti se udaahranarth, loukik sanskrit main keval aise rup banate hai jaise - devah, janaah 
 Whereas in Vedic Sanskrit they also form Roop Devasah, Janamah
 isi prakaar, prathama tathaa dwitiya vibhakti bahuvachan main ‘vishwani’ rup vaidic sahitya main ‘vishwa’ bhi ban jaataa he
 In Tritiya Vibhakti plural 'devaih' is found in Vedic Sanskrit as well as 'devebhih'
 isi prakaar saptami vibhakti ekvachan main 'vyomni' athwa 'vyomani' roopon ke saath-saath vaidic sanskrit main ‘vyoman’ bhi praapt hota he
 In Vedic and temporal Sanskrit, there is a special difference between creations and metallics
 vaidic sanskrit is vishay main kuch adhik samrudh he tathaa usamen kuch anya roopon kii uplabdhi hoti he
 Whereas in cosmic Sanskrit, there are only two such lakaras that indicate the position of the verbs - Lot and Vidhilin which are formed from the metal of the present tense
 udaahranarth path se pathtu or pathet ye donon banate hai
 In Vedic Sanskrit there are two other lakaras denoting the state of verbs - Lettakar and Prohibitive Lulkar
 in chaaron avasthaaon ke dyotak lakaar vaidic sanskrit main keval lat prakruti se hi nahin banate hai kintu lit prakruti or lu prakruti se bhi banate hai
 Thus metallics are highly abundant in Vedic Sanskrit
 iske atirikt lin pratyay sambandhi bhed vaidic sanskrit main paye jate hai jaise 'minimsibhi' prayukt hota he parantu loukik sanskrit main 'minimahi' prayukt hota he
 As far as other forms made of metal are concerned, only one 'tumun' is found in the cosmic Sanskrit whereas in Vedic Sanskrit, about a dozen forms are found such as Gantvae, Gamadhai, Jeevasai, Datavai etc
 punasch, loukik sanskrit aage chalakar adhikadhik kritrim athwa subaddh hoti gai he or iske udhaaharan hamen subandhu or banbhatat ke gadhykavyon main prayukt bhayaavah samaason main milte hai
 In this art, he is excelled by other prose of his field
 kuch vaidic shabd loukik sanskrit main aprapya hai or kuch naye shabdon kaa udbhav bhi ho gaya he
 For example, the use of the Vedic word 'apas' in the sense of 'work' has disappeared in secular Sanskrit
 loukik sanskrit main prayukt ‘parivaar’ shabd vaidic sanskrit main anuplabdh he
 This is its specialty in Vedic and temporal Sanskrit
 shabdaarth vigyaan kii drushti se kuch shabdon main ek vishisht parivartan hua he jaise ‘ritu’ jiskaa vaidic sanskrit main arth he ‘shakti’ or loukik sanskrit main uskaa arth 'yajna’ ho gaya he
 Apart from the change in language, some other variations are available in both the literature
 prathamtah, jaisaa ki upar kah chuke hai, vaidic sahitya pradhantah dharmik he jab ki loukik sanskrit apane varnyavishay kii drushti se dharm ke saath-saath loukik jivan ke prayek kshetra se sambaddh he
 Though the soul of both is integral, there are also visions of difference in integrality
 vaidic vaanmay, mukhyatah jaisaa ki rugveda tathaa atharvaveda main hamen praapt hota he, ashaavadi he jabaki loukik sanskrit sahitya nirashaavadi he, is nirashavad kii jhalak baudhon ke ‘sarv dukhan’ main bhi he
 The emergence of 'compassion' and 'friendship' of Buddhists is also the origin of Vedic literature
 vaidic dharm bhi parvarti kaal main avyakt rup se vishisht parivardhit hua dikhaai detaa he
 Even the principal deities of the Vedic era like Indra, Agni, Varuna did not get relatively distinct in secular Sanskrit but Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva only had a secondary place in the Vedas, in the later period they should have an important position
 Gone
 is kaal main kuch nae devi devataaon- ganesh, kuber, lakshmi or durga ityadi kaa bhi vaidic mul se vikaas hua
 Later poets have a greater inclination to take the shelter of exaggeration, such as Magha, Sriharsha etc
 while the earlier poets like Ashwaghosh, Bhasa and Kalidas lack exaggeration
 vaidic vaanmay main atyukti kaa maha abhaav he
 In the secular culture, we see a specific urge towards the use of truncated forms

 According to Mahabharata and other Vedic literature, it was the largest war in the history of Vedic period in ancient India

 Apart from kings from all over India, Kshatriya heroes from many other countries also participated in this war and all the heroes gained momentum
 is yuddh ke parinamswarup bharat main gyaan or vigyaan donon ke saath-saath vir kshatriyon kaa abhaav ho gaya
 In a way, the Vedic culture and civilization which was at the peak of development was abruptly destroyed
 pracheen bharat kii svarnim vaidic sabhyataa is yuddh kii samaapti ke saath hi samaapt ho gayi
 This great war was described by the great sage and philosopher of the time, Lord Ved Vyasa, in his epic Mahabharata, which was remembered by singing and listening throughout India for millennia

 The Pandavas were victorious in this war
 mahabharat main is yuddh ko dharmayuddh kaha gaya he, kyonki yah satya or nyaay ke liye ladaa jane vaala yuddh tha
 Many remains associated with the Mahabharata period have been found in Purana Qila in Delhi
 purana kila ko pandavon kaa kila bhi kaha jaataa he
 Arms and spears of the Mahabharata period have also been received by the Archaeological Survey of India in Kurukshetra

 The main reason for the Mahabharata war was the high ambitions of the Kauravas and the infatuation of Dhritarashtra's son
 kaurav or pandav aapas main sahodar bhai the
 Vedavyas ji was born to Niagara through the womb of Vichitravirya, Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu were born from the womb of Ambalika
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari ke garbh se sau putron ko janm diya, unamem duryodhana sabase bada tha
 Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was ruled in his place, so that Dhritarashtra always had a grudge against Pandu and his sons
 yah dwesh duryodhana ke rup me faleebhoot hua or shakuni ne is aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 At Shakuni's behest, Duryodhana made many conspiracies from childhood to Lakshgriha
 parantu har baar wo vifal rahaa
 When Yudhishthira was made the crown prince when he was young, he tried to kill him by sending him to Lakshagriha, but the Pandavas escaped
 pandavon kii anupasthiti main dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya parantu jab pandavon ne vaapis aakar apana rajya vaapis maanga to unhen rajya ke naam par khandahar rupi khandav van diya gaya
 At Dhritarashtra's request, Yudhishthira accepted this proposal to avoid the crisis of civil war
 pandavon ne shrikrishna kii sahaayta se indra kii amaravati puri jitani bhavy nagari indraprastha kaa nirmaan kiya
 The Pandavas collected abundant gems and money and performed the Rajasuya Yajna
 duryodhana pandavon kii unnati dekh nahin paaya or shakuni ke sahyog se dyut main chhal se yudhisthir se uskaa sara rajya jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kar use apamaanit kiya
 Probably the seeds of the war of Mahabharata had fallen on this day
 antatah punah dyut main harkar pandavon ko 12 varsho ko gyaatvaas or 1 varsh kaa agyatavaas sweekaar karnaa padaa
 But even after fulfilling this condition, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa, parantu shrikrishna ne yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Then Sri Krishna went to the Kurujya Sabha on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacemaker and there, Krishna offered Duryodhana to stop the war by giving only five villages to the Pandavas
 parantu jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to antatah yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahunche, jahaan yah bhayankar yuddh ladaa gaya kurukshetra ke us bhayanak or ghamaasan sanhaarak yuddh kaa anumaan mahabharat ke bhishma parv main diye ek shloke se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki Bhrata bharatrantra swatriyaan ma matulah॥ 12 varshon ke gyaatvaas or 1 varsh ke agyatavaas kii shart puri karne par bhi jab kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 But Shri Krishna said that this war can cause destruction of the entire world civilization, so he suggested to make every effort to stop the war
 shrikrishna ne kaha ki duryodhana ko ek antim avasar avashya dena chahie, isaliye shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or duryodhana se pandavon ke saamne keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 When Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Sri Krishna explained to him that due to this persistence of Duryodhana, many innocent people along with his descendants and companions would have to sacrifice war
 is baat krodhit hokar duryodhana ne shrikrishna ko bandi banane kii koshish kii parantu shrikrishna maaya kaa prayog karke sabko apane viraat rup se bhaybheet kar vahaan se chale gayi
 After this Yudhishthira had to be forced to fight
 usee samay bhagwaan vedavyas ne dhritarashtra ke paas jaakar kaha ki tumhaare putron ne samast gurujanon kii baton kii avhelnaa karke antatah mahavinashkari yuddh ko khadaa hi kar diya
 On requesting to know the information of Dhritarashtra war, Ved Vyas told him that if you want to see this great war, then i can give you divine vision
 is par dhritarashtra ne kaha ki isamen mere hi kul kaa vinaash hona he, isaliye main is yuddh apni aankhon se nahin dekhuungaa
 So please make such a arrangement that i keep getting news of this war
 yah sunakar vedavyas ji ne sanjay ko bulaakar use divya drushti de di or kaha, “he dhritarashtra! maine sanjay ko divya drushti pradaan kar diya he
 There will be no such thing in the entire war zone which is hidden from it
 yah tumhen is mahayuddh kaa sara vrittant sunaayegaa
 After saying this, Ved Vyas went away
 jab yah nishchit ho gaya ki yuddh to hoga hi, to donon pakshon ne yuddh ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar deen
 Duryodhana was preparing for war for the last 13 years, he got education of mace war from Balram ji and with hard work and practice, he became better than Bhima in fighting mace war
 shakuni ne in varshon me kii vishwa ke adhiktar janapadon ko apni taraf kar liya
 Duryodhana wanted to make Karna the commander of his army, but on Shakuni's persuasion, Duryodhana made Pithama Bhishma the commander of his army, due to which many districts of India and the world were in favor of Duryodhana
 pandavon kii taraf keval vahi janapad the jo dharm or shrikrishna ke paksh me the
 According to Mahabharata, Kurujaya was the largest and powerful district in the world during the Mahabharata period
 vishwa ke sabhi janapad kururajya se kabhi yuddh karne kii bhul nahin karte the evam sauhardpurn sambandh banaae rakhte the
 Therefore, all the districts agreed to help them in the war with the greed of benefiting by the Kurus
 pandavon or kauravon dwaara yadavon se sahaayta maangane par shrikrishna ne pehle to yuddh main shastr na uthaane kii pratigya kii or phir kaha ki "ek taraf main akelaa or duusari taraf meri ek akshuhinee narayani sena", ab arjuna va duryodhana ko inamen se ek kaa chunaav karnaa tha
 Arjuna chose Shri Krishna, then Shri Krishna gave one of his Akshohini army to Duryodhana and himself accepted to be the charioteer of Arjuna
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 Then Krishna met Karna and explained to him that he was the brother of the Pandavas, so he should fight on behalf of the Pandavas, but Karna did not leave the Kauravas with Duryodhana's debt and friendship
 iske baad kunti ke vinati karne par karn ne arjuna ko chhodkar uske shesh chaar putron ko avasar praapt hone par bhi na maarane kaa vachan diya
 Here, Indra too made a brahmin of the Brahmin and took his armor and helix from Karna
 jisase karn kii shakti kam ho gayi or pandavon kaa utsaah bad gaya kyonki us abhedya kavach ke kaaran karn ko kisi bhi divyastra se maaraa nahin ja saktaa tha
 The Pandavas and Kauravas carried out 7 and 11 divisions of their army respectively at Akshauhini
 ek akshuhinee main 21, 870 rath, 21, 870 hathi, 65, 610 savaar or 1,09,350 paidal sainik hote hai
 It used to be the measurement of the army in ancient India
 har rath main chaar ghode or unka sarathi hota he har hathi par uskaa hathivan baithta he or uske peeche uskaa sahaayak jo kursi ke peeche se hathi ko ankush lagaataa he, kursi main uskaa maalik dhanush-baan se sajjit hota he or uske saath uske do saathi hote hai jo bhaale phenkate hai tadnusaar jo log rathon or haathiyon par savaar hote hai unki sankhya 2, 84, 323 hoti hai ek akshuhinee sena main samast jeevadhariyon- haathiyon, ghodon or manushyon-kii kul sankhya 6, 34, 243 hoti hai, atah 18 akshuhinee sena main samast jeevadhariyon- haathiyon, ghodon or manushyon-kii kul sankhya 1, 14, 16, 374 hogi
 The same number becomes 11, 416, 374 for eighteen Akshauhini i

 In the 18 day war of Mahabharata, a variety of arrays were made by the generals of both sides
 jo nimnlikhit hai- Illustration of the formation of Chakravyuh pracheen shilachitr jisamen abhimanyu chakra vyuh main pravesh karata hua dikhaaya gaya he After completing the preparations for the war, both Kaurava and Pandava teams reached Kurukshetra
 pandavon ne kurukshetra ke pashchimi kshetra main saraswati nadi ke dakshini tat par based samantapanchak tirth se bahut dur hiranyavati nadi ke tat ke paas apana padaav daalaa or kauravo ne kurukshetra ke purvi bhaag me vahaan se kuch yojan kii duuri par ek samtal maidan me apana padaav daalaa
 Both sides stationed their troops in smooth and flat areas where there was a lot of grass and fuel
 yudhisthir ne devmandiron, tirthon or maharishiyon ke ashramon se bahut dur hiranyavati nadi ke tat ke sameep hajaaron sainya shivi lagavaaye
 There were abundant food items, weapons, weapons and many medical and artisans in each camp by paying salaries
 duryodhana ne bhi isi tarah hajaaron padaav daale vahaan keval donon senaao ke bich main yuddh ke liye 5 yojan kaa gheraa chhod diya gaya tha
 Then the next day the armies of both the sides came face to face with each other
 pandavon ne apni sena kaa padaav samantra panchak tirth paas daalaa or kauravon ne uttam or samtal sthaan dekhakar apana padaav daalaa
 Elephants, horses and chariots were not counted in that war
 pitamah bhishma kii salaah par donon dalon ne ekatra hokar yuddh ke kuch niyam banaaye
 Following are their rules is prakaar yuddh sambandhi niyam bana kar donon dal yuddh ke liye prastut hue
 The Pandavas had seven Akshauhini army and eleven Akshauhini army along with the Kauravas
 donon paksh kii senaayen purv tathaa pashchim kii ore mukh karke khadi ho gayin
 Bhishma from the Kauravas and Arjuna from the Pandavas were representing the army
 kurukshetra ke keval 5 yojan ke kshetra ke ghere me donon paksh kii senaayen khadi thim
 Before the war, Arjun asks Shri Krishna to take his chariot to the middle of both the armies so that he can see which of the warriors he has to face in the war
 jab arjuna yuddh kshetra main apane guru dron, pitamah bhishma evam anya sambandhiyon ko dekhtaa he to vah bahut shokgrast evam udhaas ho jaataa he
 He tells Shri Krishna that those for whom we want to get all this Rajbhog, they are standing here in our opposition to get the same Rajbhog in this war zone, what will we do by getting Raj after killing them
 atev main yuddh nahin karunga, aisa kahkar arjuna apane dhanush rakhkar rath ke pichley bhaag main baith jaataa he tab shrikrishna yoga main sthit hokar use gita kaa gyaan dete hai or kehete hai ki sansar main jo aayaa he usko ek naa ek din janaa hi padegaa
 Both this body and the world are mortal, but the soul living inside this body does not die even when the body dies
 jis tarah manushya puraane vastra tyaag kar naye vastra pahentaa he usee prakaar aatma bhi purana sharir tyaag kar nayaa sharir dhaaran karti he isko tum aise samajho ki yah sab prakruti tum se karvaa raheen he tum keval nimitt maatr ho
 Shri Krishna teaches Arjuna the knowledge of three, Gyan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga, after listening to which Arjun gets ready for war
 mahabharat evam anya puranic granthon ke anusaar yah yuddh bharat vanshiyon ke saath-saath anya kai mahaan vanshon tathaa vaidic gyaan vigyaan ke patan kaa kaaran bana
 Some of the main results of this war described in Mahabharata are as follows: nakaaratmak fal Positive fruit hindu paramparaon evam puraanon main di gayi pracheen rajwanshon kii suchi ke aadhaar par tathaa anya vaidic granthon main di gayi jyotishiya gananaaon ke aadhaar par mahabharat kaal ke baad kaa pracheen bhartiya rajvansh aitihaasik ghatana kalkram main nimnlikhit he- Falundica is a part of the human's throat
 yah ek prakaar kaa utak hai jo bahari rogaanuon se akraman ke viruddh pehali raksha-pankti kii tarah kaam karata he
 The throat is an important part of our body
 iskaa mahatv isi baat se spasht he ki sharir ke bheetar pahunchane vaale khaadya−padaarth tathaa hawa−pani ke pravesh kaa daayitv isi par he
 Due to performing this important work, this part is first affected by any poisonous elements present in food, water and air
 naak or kaan bhi isse achoote nahin rahete
 Although looking outward, our nose, throat and ears are seen separately, but inside the throat, the cells of these three organs merge together
 is kaaran in teenon angon main se kisi ek bhi ang main kisi prakaar kaa sankraman ho jaataa he to uskaa prabhaav teenon angon par padataa he
 For this reason, it is important that any infection is treated quickly
 bahari vaataavaran main upasthit kisi bhi jahrile tatv ke sankraman se in angon ko bachaane ke liye prakruti ne mukh tathaa gale kii sanrachana is prakaar kii he ki un jahrile tatwon ko hamaare munh ke andruni tantra par koi prabhaav na pade
 Nose and mouth appear only as a whole organ when seen in external form, their separate parts are not visible
 parantu vastav main yah ang kai hisson main bante hote hai
 Although the nitcalcavity marantz and natalchapter appear to be different in view, but in the back they are joined together in a cavity called 'oroferringles'
 oropherigles ke upar naak ke peeche ke bhaag ko 'lejopheringles' kehete hai
 The cause of tonsil problem can be any type of infection or infection that is entering our body through the mouth and nose
 ye pradooshan yaa infections viral yaa bacterial kisi bhi prakaar ke pradooshak se dooshit hawa saans ke madhyam se jab sharir main pravesh kar jaati he to yah turant samasya paidaa kar sakati he
 In places where the atmosphere contains stink, dampness and any other chemical element, in such places due to continuous exposure to poisonous elements through air, the problem of tonsil disease can arise
 bacchon main is rog ke zyada maamle drushtigat hote hai kyonki unki rog pratirohak kshamta kam hoti he
 It is not that this problem can be seen in older people who cannot suffer from it
 tonsillitis is rog kii ek khatarnaak avasthaa hoti he kyonki sharir main antibadis hone ke kaaran pratikriya hoti rahati he
 In this state, as soon as the antigen enters our body, the tonsil tissue starts to fight it
 The antigen produced by it reacts with the proteins present in other parts of the body and makes similar antibodies there
 in antibadis kaa dil ke volve par sidhaa prabhaav padataa he tathaa dil ke volve kharaab hone kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa he
 Tonsil happens mostly to children, but its side effects can occur at any age
 bachapan main gale ke sankraman kaa uchit upachaar na hona bhi hamaare desh main dil kii bimariyon kaa ek kaaran he
 In addition, tonsils can also cause diseases such as barrafangil's apishish, neutrafringel's apache
 sharir kii yantric sanrachana main vifaille tatwon ko gadabadi ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali is samasya kii pahchaan kuch praarambhik lakshan dekhakar kii ja sakati he jaise− baar-baar galaa kharaab hona, gale main sujan hona, dard hona, baar−baar bukhaar aana aadi
 If such symptoms are occurring again and again to the patient
 jaise ek varsh main paanch yaa chah baar to use tonsil kaa aaparishan karvaa lenaa chahie
 Laser operation takes two to three hours and does not rip at all
 tonsil se bachaav ke liye jaruri he ki bacchon ko santulit bhojan diya jaae taaki unke sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta majboot ho
 The most important thing is that immediately after seeing the symptoms of tonsils, contact the doctor immediately
 doctor dwaara die gaye dawaai ke course ko puraa karnaa chahie
 Often people stop the medicine as soon as they get a little rest, but doing so makes the disease more severe
 is rog ke dauraan rogi ko khaanaa−pani nigalane main takalif hoti he
 So many people eat less, it is not right
 rogi ke sharir kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti naram yaa taral khaadya padaarth dekar kii jari chahie
 By this, the body's immunity remains

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
