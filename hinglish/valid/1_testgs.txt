 In British culture, most traditional units start with a large number of counties which contain small divisions
 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties
 Urban or Rural Division / Area: Indigenous: Sufficient gaps are found in the shabdawalis of these divisions in different parts of the world, due to which sometimes it is very difficult to be very accurate in Hindi translation from other languages

 apartaaon ne 176 yatriyon main se 27 ko dubai main chhod diya lekin ek ko buree tarah chaaku se maaraa or kai anya ko ghayal kar diya
 India's lack of knowledge about the Taliban rule in Afghanistan made negotiations between the Indian authorities and the hijackers difficult

 According to the Indian government, the identity of the kidnappers was as follows: isi-814 par maujuud mukhya flit atendent anil sharma ne baad main bataaya ki ek nakaabposh, chashmadhari aadmi ne vimaan ko bam se uda dene kii dhamkee di thi or captain devi sharan ko "pashchim kii ore udaan bharne" kaa aadesh diya tha
 The hijackers wanted Captain Sharan to take the plane over Lahore via Lucknow but Pakistani authorities immediately refused to allow it as they were wary of linking up with terrorists
 iske alaava eendhan bhi paryaapt nahin tha
 Captain Sharan told the hijackers that they would have to land in Amritsar, India
 amritsar main captain sharan ne vimaan main dubaara eendhan bharne kaa anurodh kiya
 However, the Disaster Management Group in Delhi directed the officials at the Amritsar airport to ensure that the aircraft was stationary, where armed personnel of the Punjab Police were already present for the effort

 a fuel tanker was eventually dispatched and instructed to cease access to the aircraft
 jaise hi tanker vimaan kii ore bhaaga, hawaii yatayaat niyantran ne payalat ko dhimaa karne kaa radio sandesh bheja or tanker turant ruk gaya
 The sudden halt thus increased suspicion of the hijackers and forced them to immediately take the aircraft away from the air traffic control without clearance
 tanker vimaan se kuch hi feet kii duuri par rah gaya tha
 The aircraft requested an emergency landing in Lahore, Pakistan due to the extremely low fuel level
 pakistan ne is dar se anurodh ko thukraa diya ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath unke desh kaa naam joda ja saktaa tha
 Pakistan also shut down its air traffic services, thus effectively managing the entire Pakistan airspace for Indian Airlines flight and all the lights at Lahore airport were switched off

 Since India did not recognize the Taliban-regime, it sent an officer from its High Commission in Islamabad to Kandahar
 The negotiation process was complicated by India's lack of prior contact with the Taliban-government
 haalanki taliban kaa iraadaa tab andeh ke daayre main aa gaya jab iske sashastr ladaakon ne apahrit vimaan ko gher liya
 The Taliban maintained that military forces were deployed in an attempt to prevent the hijackers from killing or injuring hostages, but some analysts believe this was done to halt the Indian military operation against the hijackers

 Nasadi Sukta is the 129th Sukta by doing the 10th mandal of the Rigveda
 iskaa sambandh brahmand vigyaan or brahmad kii utpatti ke saath he
 It is believed that this sukta tells very accurate facts about the creation of the universe
 isi kaaran duniya main kaaphi prasiddh hua he
 The philosophical description of the origin of the universe in the Nasdaq Sukta is described in a very excellent form and the amazing knowledge of the sages proves that the culmination of civilization in the whole world could be seen in India and it would not be an exaggeration
 nasadeey sookt ke rachayita rishi prajapati parameshthi hai

 before the creation of the universe, there was no untoward element in the Holocaust condition
 sat= bhav tatva bhi nahin tha, rajah=swarglok mrityulok or pataal lok nahin the, antariksh nahin tha or usase pare jo kuch he vah bhi nahin tha, vah aavaran karne vaala tatva kahan tha or kiske sangrakshan main tha
 At that time, what was deep that was penetrable by difficulty = difficulty, that is, they were not all
 anvay-tarhi mrityuh nasit na amritam, ratryah ahnam praketah nasit tat aneeth avatham, swadhaya ekam ha tasmaat anyat kinchan na aas na parah
 Meaning - There was no death in that period of time and there was no lack of amrit = death
 ratri or din kaa gyaan bhi nahin tha us samay vah brahm tatv hi keval praan yukt, kriya se shunya or maaya ke saath judaa hua ek rup main vidyaman tha, us maaya sahit brahm se kuch bhi nahin tha or us se pare bhi kuch nahin tha

 That is, at that time both the work and the reason were mixed, it is a world wide and low level lack of form was covered with ignorance, therefore, the work with the cause was uniform and this world was born from the glory of God's resolve and penance

 Was it slant first or middle or last? Did that element exist below or exist above? He was born with the same sentiment everywhere, thus in this created world some substances were in the form of living beings holding the seed form karma and some elements were nature forms in the great form; Swadha = material foods are of inferior nature and consuming substances are full of excellence
 anvay-kah addha veda kah ih pravochat iyan visrushtih kutah kutah aajaata, deva asya visarjan arvak ath kah veda ytah aa babhuv
 Meaning - Who really knows this and who can tell the details of the creation of this world in which this variety of creation came from all the causes and for which reason

 Anvay - i am brilliant: especially, if there is a disease, or if it is not

 Meaning - The main reason for this variety of creation which has arisen due to gratitude and reason, is the holding of it by God

 The lord of this creation, God, is distinguished in his light or bliss form

 adhyas, advait vedant kaa paribhaashik shabd he
 Knowledge of one thing in another is called adhyas
 rassi ko dekhakar sarp kaa gyaan iskaa udhaaharan he
 The rope here is true, but the knowledge of the snake in it is false
 mithyaa gyaan bina satya aadhaar ke sambhav nahin he, at: adhyas ke do paksh maane jate hai- satya or anrut yaa mithyaa

 The 'mithunisation' of falsehood is the root cause of the practice
 is mithunikaran main ek ke dharmon kaa duusare main aarope hota he
 The curvature of the rope is charged in the snake, so knowledge of the snake is possible
 saath hi yah dharmarope koi vyakti jaan-boojhkar nahin karata; vastut: anjaane main hi yah aarope ho jaataa he, isliye satya or anrut main adhyasavastha main paraspar vivek nahin ho paata
 As soon as there is a conscience, the practice is destroyed
 jin do vastuon ke dharmon kaa paraspar adhyas hota he ve vastut: ek-duusari se atyant bhinn hoti hai
 They do not have elemental equilibrium; But on the basis of ceremonial theology, both are mithunised as pertaining
 shankar bhashya main adhyas kaa lakshan batalaate hue kaha gaya he ki ek vastu main tatsadrush kisi purvadrushti vastu kaa samaran hota he
 This memory is called adhyas
 parantu purvadrisht vastu kaa samaran mithyaa nahin hota
 Seeing someone 'this is the same person', such knowledge generated is true
 isliye 'smritirup' shabd kaa vishesh arth yahan abhipret he
 Like the form of a memory object, knowledge of that object in a different place is considered to be a common feature of Adhyas
 rassi ko dekhakar sarp kaa samaran hota he or tadnantar sarp kaa gyaan hota he
 This is a different thing from Sarpa Gyan Smriti Sarpa
 vachaspati mishra ne 'bhaamati' main kaha he-'sarpadibhav se rassi aadi kaa athwa raktaadi gun se yukt sphatik aadi kaa gyaan na hota ho, aisi baat nahin he, kintu is gyaan se rassi aadi sarp ho jate hai yaa usamen sarp kaa gun utpann hota he, yah bhi asangat he
 If it were, then in the desert there would have been a knowledge of Mandakini by seeing the rays of the rays, and the graceful Mandakini has come out of the garland of the waves and people would have pacified their papaya with its water
 isliye adhyas se yadhyapi vastu sat jaisi lagati he, phir bhi usamen vaastavik satyatv kii sthiti maananaa morrkhtaa he
 If this practice is devoid of truth then it should not be known like Bandyaputra etc
 kintu sarpgyaan hota he, at: yah atyant asat nahin he
 At the same time, adhyaas cannot even sage knowledge, because the serpent's knowledge is not true at all
 sat or asat paraspar virdohi hai at: adhyas sadasat bhi nahin he
 Ultimately, Adhyas is said to be singularly indescribable from a member
 is kram se adhyast jal vaastavik jal kii tarah he, isiilie vah purvadrushti he
 This is untrue, inexplicable
 adhyas do prakaar kaa hota he
 The role that Adi Shankaracharya wrote to Vedantasutra's commentary is called Adhyasabhasya

 yah ek laghu rachana he jisamen 50 se bhi kam shloke hai jo paanch bhaagon main vibhakt hai

 grager jon mendal ek german bhashi austrian augstanian padri evam vaigyanik the
 He is called the father of genetics
 unhone matar ke daanon par prayog kar anuvanshiki ke niyam nirdhaarit kiye the
 The importance of his works was not recognized until the twentieth century, later the rediscovery of those rules revealed their importance
 anuvanshikta ke janmdata grager johan mandal kaa janm 22 july san 1822 i main moravia desh ke ek saadhaaran krishak parivaar main hua tha
 Marvia is now in Czechoslovakia
 balak johan parivaar ke kheton main paudhon kii dekharekh main madad kiya karata tha
 He used to get special pleasure in this work
 bachapan main hi ye krishak pita se tarah-tarah ke prashn poocha karte the ki phulon ke alag-alag rang or rup kahaan se aate hai
 He did not have answers to such questions of the son
 ve bachche ko ucch shiksha dilaanaa chaahate the
 His family was surrounded by the curse of poverty
 phir bhi pita ne kharche main katar-byont karke bete ko jaise taise chaar varsh kalege main padhaayaa
 When he was twenty-one years old, he entered a monastery
 saint gregory ke sammaan main inhone grager naam dhaaran kiya
 He had chosen a good business
 math main man ram gaya tha
 His fellow monks were lovers and intelligent people
 ve dharm se sahitya tak or kala se vigyaan tak sabhi vishyon kii vivechna main badi dilchaspee liya karte the
 He had a small green garden, because he enjoyed special pleasure in plants, so made him its president
 is ke saath-saath apana dharmik adhyayan bhi jari rakhaa or san 1847 i main padri ban gaye
 Seeing Mendel's interest in science, Mutt sent him to study physics at the University of Venice for two years
 jab vahaan se adhyayan puraa karke laute to, aaltabrun nagar, jahaan inkaa math tha vidhyalay main bhautikee kii dekhbhaal kiya karte the
 All this did not cause any hindrance to the monk duties
 yahaan bhi mendal ne prashn uthaane aarambh kiye jinhen ve pita ke khet par uthaaya karte the
 Why are some peas smooth and some wrinkled? What should we do so that only smooth peas will emerge
 kabhi-kabhi ve laal phulon ke hi beej bote hai, to kuch nae paudhon main gulabi phool kyon aate hai? In the end, Mendel's eagerness prevailed
 inhone kuch aise prayog karne kaa nishchay kiya, jo vastav main vigyaan se sambandhit the
 He did not resort to mere imagination
 ve prayek baat ko dhyaan se dekha karte the or note karte jate the; kyonki matar aasaani se ug aati thi
 So they conducted experiments with peas
 matar kii jindagi choti thi or mendal bahut-si pidiyon kaa adhyayan kar sakate the
 Between 1856, Mendel sowed and observed 10,000 pea plants
 inhone jis tarah kii samasya hal karne kaa prayaas kiya uskaa ek udhaaharan yah he: matar ke ek unche or ek chote paudhe kii santan unchi hogi athwa choti? unche paudhe or chote paudhe se santan praapt karne ke liye mendal ne unche paundhe ke phool main se sunahari dhuli lee
 And put it on the head of the woman of small plant
 isse jo beej bane unhen boyaa
 All the plants were tall like 'father' plants
 mendal ne unchepan ko prabhavi lakshan kaha he
 When these high children had children, their seeds were grown, they found that not all plants were tall in the second generation or plants
 prati teen unche paudhon ke peeche ek paudha chota tha
 This small plant was found in the heredity of grandmother
 tathaa chhotepan ko aprabhavi lakshan kaha
 Similarly, yellow seed peas were hybridized with green seeds
 tab ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki unase utpann pehali peedi se sab paudhon ke beej pile the
 It had three yellow and one green in the next generation ie plants
 yahaan pilaa prabhavi or haraa aprabhavi lakshan tha
 Repeated these experiments numerous times, but the result was the same
 aath varsh tak badi satarkta ke saath kaary karne ke baad, jab inako purna vishwaas ho gaya, to kaha ki paudhon kii anuvanshikta kuch amogh aparivartansheel niyamon ke anusaar kaary karti he| It was only natural that they should be excited about these new principles
 ab inhone nishchay kiya ki samay aa gaya he jab inako sansar ko bataanaa chahie, ki unhone kis baat kaa pataa laga liya he
 1865 AD main inhone ek lekh likhaa or use nagar kii vaigyanik sabha ke saamne padhaa: par inhone mahasoos kiya ki koi bhi inaki baat ko samaj nahin paa rahaa he
 The audience humbly applauded and immediately forgot what they heard there
 kadachit ve unhen acchhee tarah samajha nahin sake the
 Returned home and rewrote that article
 kuch saptaah baad unhone use duusari sabha main padhaa, par yahan par bhi kisi shrota ne koi ruchi nahin lee
 Perhaps they have understood that can any important thing be proved from pea plants

 He was soon unholy and unimproved and covered with dust in the library's cabinets

 a few days later he told his fellow monks, "my time must come one day
" " Sixteen years after his death, the world came to know how big a scientist he was
 san 1900 main teen europea vaigyanikon ko us bhuule hue lekh kaa pataa chalaa tha, jise 30 varsh purv prakashit kiya tha
 They realized his importance and spread his news to the scientific world
 sheeghra hi is nishkarsh par pahunch gaye ki mendal ke niyam keval paudhon ke liye hi nahin, jantuon evam maanvon ke liye bhi sahi hai
 Later experiments showed that there were some exceptions to their rules
 ab ham unhen niyam nahin kehete, balki siddhanth kehete hai
 Their principles have proved very helpful for the farmers
 unhone krishakon ko bataaya he ki gehun, makka or duusari fasalon kii acchhee kismein kaise taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 Following these principles, animal producers have succeeded in producing stronger, healthier cows and sheep

 In India too, bicycle wheels played an important role in economic growth
 1947 main aazaadee ke baad agle kai dashak tak desh main cycle yatayaat vyavastha kaa anivaary hissaa rahi
 Especially from 1960 to 1990, most families in India had bicycles
 yah vyaktigat yatayaat kaa sabase taqatvar or kifayati saadhan tha
 In villages, farmers used to take vegetables and other crops on cycles only till weekly mandis
 doodh kii supplai gaanvon se paas se kasbaai bazaaron tak cycle ke jariye hi hoti thi
 The entire system of the postal department used to run on a cycle
 aaj bhi postman cycle se chitthiyaan baantate hai
 Age changed and courier services became more reliable, but the importance of bicycle did not end here
 badi sankhya main courier baantne vaale bhi cycle kaa istemaal karte hai
 Liberalization began in the country in 1990 and a series of rapid economic changes began
 desh kii yuva peedi ko motorcycle kii sawari zyada bha rahi thi
 In the license permit raj, the patience of those who waited years for a scooter was exhausted
 udaarikaran ke kuch saal baad shahari madhyavarg ko apane shauk puure karne ke liye paisa kharch karne main hichak nahin thi
 The hobby of motorcycle was increasing in cities
 gaanvon main bhi is maamle main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 Ambassadors, Bullets and Bajaj Group scooters were lagging behind in New India
 hero honda desh kii nai dhadkan ban rahi thi
 This change intensified in the coming years
 desh main badlaav ke donon pahiye badal gaye the
 Despite this, the importance of cycling in India is not over
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki china ke baad duniya main aaj bhi sabase zyada cycle bharat main banati hai
 Since the nineties, there has been a significant change in the statistics of sales of bicycles
 cykilon kii kul bikri main badhotaree ai he, lekin gramin ilaakon main isaki bikri main giravat ai he
 Due to easy economic sponsorship, people are giving more preference to motorcycles in these areas
 darasal, 1990 se pehle jo bhoomika cycle kii thi, uski jagah gaanvon or shaharon main motorcycle ne le lee
 The sales of two-wheelers in 2002-03, which was 48
12 lakh, increased to 74
37 lakh in 2008-09
 iskaa matlab yah he ki pichley kaarobaari saal main desh main jitani cycle bikin, utani hi bikri dopahiyon kii bhi rahi
 The following are the different parts of bicycle: bisikil kaa sabase mahatvapurn ang uskaa frem he
 The structure of the frame should be such that the parts mounted on it can do their work efficiently
 bisikil kii tikoni frem or aage tathaa peeche ke chimate khokhli, gol naliyon se banaae jate hai
 They are then stuck to the corners of the frame by holding them in appropriate brackets
 tikoni frem ke banane main dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uski naliyon kii madhya rekhaayen ek hi samtal main rahen
 The front steering end of the frame, the handle stalk, and the front lines of the front tongs should coincide
 donon taru ke chimaton kii bhujaayen bhi unki madhya rekha se samamit tathaa samaantar honi chahie
 The mid-line of the wheels should coincide with the mid-line of the tongs, otherwise the bike will not be able to remain straight while remaining balanced
 pahiyon main aajkal naabhi kii sparsheey disha main are lagane kaa rivaaj he
 Tactile arrears, deceptive forces can be well applied to the wheel circle
 prayek do asann are kaichinuma lagakar, hub kii flaj se sparsheey disha main jhuke rahete hai
 The rear wheel takes 40 and the next 32 holes, so accordingly holes are made in its circles and half the number of holes are made in each flange of the hubs
 chakkaa taiyaar karte samay vyasabhimukh aath aron ko pehle lagaakar sahi kar lete hai, phir shesh aron ko usee kram se bharte jate hai
 In the pictures, the flanges on the left side of the hub are shown with the arrows, which are seated in odd numbered holes on the circle
 sam sankhyankit chhedon main dahini taraf kii flanz ke are baithenge, at: unke sthanon ko khaali dikhaaya gaya he
 Are made of wire are always called tans because of being in a state of tension
 prayog karte samay bhi pahiyon ke aron kii samay samay par pariksha karte rahanaa chahie, koi ara dhilaa or koi adhik tanaav main nahin hona chahie
 If everyone is seen playing with a finger, a sound should be emitted from them, otherwise the wheels will start to get broken after breaking
 unhen kasne kaa kaam ghere par lagi nipalon ko uchit disha main ghumaakar kiya ja saktaa he
 For a bicycle to work properly, it is necessary to pay attention to its ball bearings
 yadi kisi bering main se zaraa bhi awaz nikalati ho to avashya hi usamen koi kharabi he
 Open it and count the pills on both sides, wipe it with a cloth and brighten it
 yadi koi goli tuuti, chatkhi yaa ghis gai ho to use badal dijie, phir uski katori ke valayakaar khaanche tathaa konon ko dekhie
 They should not be worn, cut, or rough
 yadi kharaab hon, to unhen bhi badal dijie
 If there is no AB above and the pills are also of the same number and the same size, then the lack of oil in it should be understood
 bering ke kisi bhi bhaag main kisi bhi prakaar kaa kachra yaa keechad to hona hi nahin chahie
 It is fitted in the rear wheel, by which the rider can change the ratio of the speed of the bicycle to his will and need
 aajkal teen chaal denevaale giar habon kaa adhik prachaar he
 Such a gear navel is also made that the rear, ie inverted, brakes the paddle
 chaal badalane ke liye zanjeer chakra or naabhi ke bich kii chaal ke anupaat ko, naabhi kii dhuree ke madhya lagi baarik kadiyonwali ek zanjeer ko khinchakar badal diya jaataa he
 Pulling it changes the position of the gears inside the navel
 zanjeer ko khinchne kaa kaam to savaar apane liveron dwaara jor lagaakar karata he, lekin waapas lautne kii kriya naabhi ke bheetar lagi kamaani dwaara swat: hi ho jaati he
 To open the umbilical part, one should first open the left hand cone, then open the ring of bullets on the right hand side
 peeche ke chakke par iske laga dene se savaar jab chaahe pair chalaanaa band kar saktaa he, phir bhi vah pahiyaa aazaadee se ghumta rah saktaa he
 It is of two types, one with friction cylinder and the other with ratchet tooth
 prayek mukt chakra main yah gun hona chahie ki bhitari purjon ke atak jane se pedal kii zanjeer par khinchaav na paidaa ho or dubaara jab pedal chalaae jaaen tab bhitari purje ek dam aapas main jutakar kaam karne lagen or phisalein nahin
 Also, the texture of the wheel should be impervious to dust and water
 aajkal ratchet daant yukt mukt chakra kaa hi adhik prachlan he
 On the inner periphery of its enclosure, ratchet teeth are severed, wherein the dogs stuck in place, through a chain of paddles, convey the stretch given by the rider to the navel of the wheel
 pedal chalaanaa band hote hi zanjeer thahar jaati he tathaa ve kute kamaani ke jor se rechat ke daanton main baari baari se girte hai, jisase "katkat" kii aawaaj hoti he
 If the free cycle starts slipping, or gets jammed when running again, the first trick to correct it is to fill the wheel empty with plenty of kerosene, and when all that oil is gone, then give lubricating oil to it
 yadi aib dur na ho, to chakra ke dhakkan ko khol kar dekhnaa chahie ki kahin kute ghis to nahin gaye hai, athwa unki kamaniyaan hi tut gai hon
 Then it should be cleaned completely from within and replacing the broken parts or tablets with new ones, the bangles of the lid should be tightened carefully
 tair ko pahie ke ghere par jamaaye rakhane ke liye iske donon kinaaron par yaa to ispaat ke tarayukt, athwa rabar kii hi kathor gonth bana di jaati he, jo chakke ke ghere ke mude hue kinare ke neeche dabakar ataki rahati he or bhitari rabar nalee main hawa bhar dene se tair tanakar yathasthaan baith jaataa he
 The inner hose should be filled with the same pressure so that the tires bear the burden of the rider and the wheels do not hit the road pebbles, otherwise there will be a fear of the hose being crushed and tires broken
 aavashyaktaa se adhik hawa bhar dene se tair kaa lacheelaapan kam hokar bisical sadak par uchhalati hui chalati he, lekin aavashyak maatra main kasakar hawa bhar dene se pahie kaa vyas apni seemaa tak bad jaataa he or acchhee sadak par chalate samay pedal se kam maatra main shakti lagaani padati he
 Bud's air wall is often used to fill the air in the inner tube, the design of which is clearly shown in Fig

 rabar kaa valb tub fata, kuchlaa or sada galaa nahin hona chahie
 The cap on the upper end of the hair plug should always be on
 balve kaa aadhaar nat ghere par sakhti se ksaa rahanaa chahie
 The plug of the valve, including the rubber valve tube, should enter into the grooves without interruption
 pedal craikon ko unki dhuree se cotteron dwaara hi joda jaataa he
 If the crack or axle becomes bent due to bicyclic fall, or accident, the cotter should be removed to dislodge the cranks, by opening the cotter nut attached to it, by hammering the churid end of the cater with a hammer, but attention
 Be careful not to spoil the bangles
 crank ke vaksh ke neeche lohe kii koi laag lagaakar hi cotter thonknaa chahie, anyathaa crank dhuree yaa ball bering par jhatka pahunchega
 If the two cranks are not in a straight line due to a malfunction, the flattened portion of the cotter should be sanded, or overturned
 yadi crank apni dhuree par dhilaa ho, to cotter ko adhik gaharaai tak thokane se bhi kaam ban jaataa he
 For a long time, both the cotter and the crank hole are cut and the axis of the spindle also gets damaged due to running the bicycle with loose couture
 at: nayaa cotter badalanaa hi acha rahata he
 Often the paddle pin is curved as a bicycle falls
 aisi haalat main pedal ke baahar kii taraf vaale vering kii topi utarkar uskaa samanjak cone nikaalkar goliyaan haath main le leni chahie
 Then the frame of the paddle should be moved and the inner wiring tablets should be taken and the paddlepin will remain in the crank
 uskaa nirikshan kar tathaa guniyaan main sidhaa kar, pedal ko yathapurv band dena chahie
 It is made by chained small petal links, cylinders and rivets
 ise saaf kar, tel kii chiknayee dekar or uske khinchaav ko sanmajit kar thik haalat main rakhana chahie
 The loosening of the chain's reverse joints and wear of the cylinders increases its overall length
 pedal ke dantachakr ke daanton kaa pich to badalata nahin, at: zanjeer chakra se utar kar takalif detii he
 The idea is that in the middle of the tangent of the chain mounted on the letter, it is pulled outward with a thumb and index finger
 yadi zanjeer lagbhag inch hi khinchati he, tab to thik he or yadi inch tak khinch jaati he to avashya hi ghiskar dhili ho gai hogi
 Therefore, it should be changed
 pahiyon ke gheron par dabaav daalanevaale hastchalit brikon kii karypranali liver or dandon ke sambandh par aadhaarit hoti he
 Bowden's brakes are based on a stretch of an incompressible wire mounted in a flexible steel tube
 brikon ko chhudaane ke liye kamaani kaam karti he
 Brakes are the main safety device, so brake poles should be harmonized, ie they should not be stuck in the arrows or tires
 danda majboot hone ke saath saath saralata se jodon par ghoomanevaale hone chahie
 Good looking and parts should also be neat and clean
