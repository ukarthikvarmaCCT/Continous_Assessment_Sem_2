 It has the story of a Yaksha who is expelled from Kubera Alkapuri
 nishkasit yaksha ramagiri parvat par nivas karata he
 In the rainy season he starts reminding him of his girlfriend
 kamarth yaksha sochataa he ki kisi bhi tarah se uskaa alkapuri lautnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye vah premika tak apana sandesh doot ke madhyam se bhejne kaa nishchay karata he
 Yaksha, who is living a life of loneliness, does not even get a messenger, so he thought of sending his message through the cloud to a deranged girlfriend
 is prakaar asadha ke pratham din akaash par umadte meghon ne kalidas kii kalpana ke saath milakar ek anany kriti kii rachana kar di
 Meghdoot has been popular in Indian literature since ancient times
 jahaan ek ore prasiddh tikaakaron ne is par tikaayen likhi hai, vahiin anek sanskrit kaviyon ne isse prerit hokar athwa isko aadhaar banaakar kai dootkavy likhe
 The lofty spread of emotion and imagination available in Meghdoot is rare in Indian literature
 nagarjun ne meghdoot ke hindi anuwaad kii bhoomika main ise hindi vaanmay kaa anupam ansh bataaya he
 Meghdootam poetry is divided into two sections
 purvamegh main yaksha badal ko ramagiri se alakapuri tak ke raste kaa vivaran detaa he or uttarmegh main yaksha kaa yah prasiddh virahadagdh sandesh he jisamen kalidas ne premihruday kii bhaavana ko udel diya he
 Some scholars have considered this work as a personal expression of the poet
 "meghdoot" main lagbhag 115 padya hai, yadhyapi alag alag sanskarnon main in padyon kii sankhya her-pher se kuch adhik bhi milti he
 Dr

 According to De, the original "meghdoot" contains less than 111 verses, the rest seems to be later trajectories
 adhikansh vichaarkon kaa maananaa he ki kalidas ne apane jivan kii kisi virah vyathaa katha ko meghdoot main sandesh banaakar nibaddh kiya he
 According to the Hindi poet Nagarjuna- varsha ritu kii snigdh bhoomikapratham diwas asadha maas kaadekh gagan main shyaam ghan-ghatavidhur yaksha kaa man jab uchataakhade-khadey jab haath jodkarchitrkoot ke subhag shikhar paraus bechaare ne bheja thajinke dwaara hi sandeshoun pushkaravart meghon kasathi banakar udne vaalekalidas! sach-sach batalanapar pidaa se pur-pur hothak-thak kar or chur-chur homal-dhaval giri ke shikharon parpriyavar! tum kab tak soye the?royaa yaksha yaa tum roye the?kalidas! sach-sach batalaana
 The story of Nal and Damayanti in the Mahabharata narrative titled "nalopakhyan", sending it as a messenger, is also a follow-up to the tradition of the envoy
 kavi jinase "meghdoot" kii tarah hi mandakrantha chand main tirthakar parswanath ke jivan se sambhddha chaar sargon kaa ek kavy "parshwabhyuday" likhaa jisamen megh ke dautya ke rup main meghdoot ke shatadhik padya samavisht hai
 In the 15th century, the "vikram" poet wrote the poem "nemidoot", with a reference to "neminath" and "rajmati", in which the poet describes the disunity of Neminath's abandoned Rajmati by problematizing the last steps of 125 verses of Meghudat
 isi kaal main ek anya jain kavi "charitrasundar gani ne shantarasparak jain kavy "shildoot" kii rachana kii
 Apart from these two works, Vimalakirti's "chandradoot", Unknown Poet's "chetodoot" and Meghvijay Upadhyaya's "meghdoot Problem" are the other Jain poets of this tradition
 triayami holography ek static kiran pradarshi pradarshan yukti hoti he
 The word derives from the Greek, ὅλος holos, meaning complete + γραφή graphy
 is takanic main kisi vastu se nikalne vaale prakaash ko record kar baad main punarnirmit kiya jaataa he, jisase us vastu ke recording madhyam ke saapeksh chhavi main vahi sthiti prathit hoti he, jaisi recording ke samay thi
 This image appears to change according to the viewer's position and orientation, as it would when the object was present
 is prakaar anikit chhavi ek triayami chitra prastut karti he or hologram kehalaati he
 The hologram was invented by british-hungarian physicist Danis Gabor in 1947, which was further developed in 1960
 iske baad ise audyogic upyog main laayaa gaya
 Its use appears as a small square square strip on the cover of books, credit cards, etc
 ise hi hologram kaha jaataa he
 It looks like a three-dimensional image or a trimb, but it is basically a two-dimensional shape
 iske liye jab do dwiaiami akritiyon ko ek duusare ke upar rakhaa jaataa jaataa he
 In technical language it is called superimposition
 yah maanav aankh ko gaharaai kaa bhram bhi detaa he
 The creation of holograms requires the recording of fine details, so it is made through laser light
 lager kirane ek vishesh tarangadairghy kii hoti hai
 Because holograms are seen in normal light, laser rays with these special wavelengths make the hologram bright
 hologram par chitra praapt karne ke liye do alag alag tarangadairghy vaali lager kirnon ko ek photographic plate par ankit kiya jaataa he
 Before this, both laser rays pass through a beam spreader, causing the light of the laser rays on the plate to be like a flashlight and imprint the image
 isse ek hi jagah do chhaviyaan praapt hoti hai
 That is, through laser light on the same base, two different shapes are inscribed in such a way that different shapes are seen when the viewer views the hologram from different angles
 maanav aankh dwaara jab hologram ko dekha jaataa he to vah donon chhaviyon ko milakar mastishk main sanket bhejti hai, jisase mastishk ko uske triayami hone kaa bhram hota he
 When the hologram is ready, it is printed on silver plates
 ye chaandi kii parten diflacted prakaash se banaai jaati hai
 The specialty of a hologram is that it is quite complicated to steal and copy, so different companies are using their hologram to protect themselves and differentiate themselves from other competitors
 hologram ke prayog se nakli utpaada kii pahchaan saralata se kii ja sakati he
 Holistic India Limited is a major hologram company in India
 nakli dawaaon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bharat kii pramukh aushadhi company ne glaxo ne bukhaar kam parane vaali aushadhi krosine ko ek tri-aiami hologram pack main prastut kiya he
 This sophisticated 3D hologram is the first and only analgesic anti-pyretic brand in India
 hologram kaa prayog karne vaali prasiddh bhartiya companiyon main hindustan uniliver, philips india, ashok leland, kirloskar, hockins jaisi companiyaan shaamil he
 Apart from this, plans for production of holographic yarn for silk and synthetic textile industry are also in progress
 1 Hologram is less expensive and it can be easily detected if the products are tampered with
 isaki madad se utpaada kii saakh or vishistataa bani rahati he
 Apart from this, 3D hologram is also used in voter ID card etc
 iske liye bhartiya nirvachan ayog ne bhi nirdesh jari kiye hai
 Holograms are also used in voter ID cards of India
 iske alaava vidyut aapurti metron par bijli kii chori rokane hetu bhi hologram kaa prayog hota he

 In this way, the classification of animals and plants is used in classics or taxonomy in English, two terms for taxonomy - taxonomy and systematics
 karl liniyas ne 1735 i
 main sistemaa naturai naamak pustak systematics shabd ke aadhaar par likhi thi
 In the modern era both these terms are used for plant and animal classification
 vargiki kaa kaary aakaariki, akritivigyaan kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also an analysis of many types of knowledge, beliefs and systems, which are used in the field of classification
 jeevigyaan sambandhi kisi prakaar ke vishleshan kaa pratham sopan he suvyavasthit dhang se uskaa vargeekaran; at: padap, yaa jantu ke adhyayan kaa pehla kadam he uskaa namakaran, vargeekaran or tab varnan
 The basic formulation of taxonomy is based on morphology, morphology, ecology and genetics
 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sanshleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 aajkal padap kii chaar lakh jatiyon se adhik jatiyaan gyaat hai
 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus
 prati varsh lagbhag 4,750 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 More than a million names have been given from 1763 to 1942 AD in plant groups called phenerogams and cryptougams, including synonyms and subcastes
 varnit jantuon kii jatiyaan ginati main padap jatiyon se kahin adhik hai
 The names of more than two million castes, including the sub-castes, are known and about 10,000 new castes are described every year
 vargeekaran vigyaan kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna maanav kaa itihaas
 As soon as it was understood, man started recognizing and naming the animals and plants around him
 greece ke anek pracheen vidwaan, visheshat: hipocreties ne or democritus, ne apane adhyayan main jantuon ko sthaan diya he
 Apparently Aristotle has compiled the wisdom of his time appropriately
 aristotle ke ullekh main vargeekaran kaa prarambh dikhaai padataa he
 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology
 janvigyaan visheshgyon main jon re pratham vyakti the, jinhone jati or vansh main antar spasht kiya or pracheen vaigyanikon main ye pratham the, jinhone ucchtar prakritik vargeekaran kiya
 They had an impact on the great naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who lived in Sweden
 linius ne is disha main adwitiya kaary kiya
 Therefore, they are considered to be the father of classification science
 atharahavin shatabdi main vikaswad ke vichaaron kaa prabhaav vargeekaran vigyaan par padaa
 This influence reached its peak in the mid-nineteenth century
 isi samay doorvarti sthanon ke jantuon main vargeekaran visheshgyon kii gambhir ruchi ho gai thi
 They wanted to know about animals from distant countries and related them to familiar animals
 isliye is samay lambii jalayatraayen hui
 Animals from far away were studied and their offspring and family etc
 were studied
 ek aisi yatra bigle naamak jahaaj par hui thi jisamen charles darwin naamak prakrutivaadee bhi sammilit tha
 During this period, great progress was made in taxonomy and many new castes, lineages and clans were added to the classification
 beesvin shatabdi main kiya gaya vargeekaran vigyaan kii visheshta he
 According to Haxley, modern taxonomy is a synthesis of geography, ecology, extracellular and genetics etc
 pehle samay main vargeekaran vigyaan kaa aadhaar tha "prakaar", jisko akritik lakshanon kii sahaayta se upasthit karte the
 In modern taxonomy, the description of castes is not solely based on natural traits, but is biological, due to which attention is also given to geographical, ecological, genetic and some other characteristics
 praroop sankalpana shreniyon kii sthirataa ko vistrut rup detii he, ek duusare ke bich antar ko badhaati he or parivartanshiltaa ko kam karti he
 In contrast to this is the population concept, according to which species is made up of variable population and is not stable
 utkram se vishesh samoohon athwa shreniyon kii paribhaasha karnaa vargeekaran kaa nishchit dhang he
 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories
 adhiktar mul naam ke pehle adhi athwa up upsargon ko jodakar in shreniyon kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 For example, precepts and subgroups etc
 unchi shreniyon ke liye kai naam prastaavit kiye gaye, parantu saamaanya prayog main ve nahin aate
 Only the primitive caste is used between the family and the clan
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'
 kintu ise abhi tak kodon main sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 Categories can also be created between the seven main categories, for which prefixes 'adhi-', 'sub-' or 'infra-' should be used
 iske alaava jantuvigyaan tathaa vanaspati vigyaan ke vargeekaran kii shreniyon main maamuli antar bhi he )
 The following are the commonly used categories at this time: parjiviyon main vrahat bhinnata, jeev vaigyanikon ke liye unka varnan karnaa tathaa unhen namavali baddh karnaa ek badi chunauti upasthit karti he
 DNA to separate, identify and identify the various castes that have taken place between different groups on different taxonomy scales
 Experiments have been very important and helpful for ecologists
 vargeekaran kii kul aath shreniyan hai
 The theory of Atma Darpan was formulated in 1902 by HC Cooley
 is siddhant ke antargat kule kehete he kii samaaj ek darpan ke samaan hota he
 a person becomes himself as he goes in society
 jis prakaar ek purush athwa mahila aaine main dekhakar sajati savarti he or apane ko baar baar niharti he or dekhte he kii vah thik usee prakaar se taiyaar ho paayi he athwa nahi kehane kaa taatpary he kii vah jis samaaj main ja rahi he us ke anuroop apane ko taiyaar kar paaya he kii nahin
 In this, society is a mirror through which a person learns by watching
 isi ko kule ne aatm darpan kaa siddhant kaha he
 The male Jalasarp or Hydras planetarium is a constellation appearing in the southern part of the celestial sphere

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 In modern astronomy, it is believed that when a cloud of molecules in space starts collapsing with gravity, it makes an adyagraha circle around a star
 pehle anu jamaa hokar dhul ke kan bana dete hai, phir kan milakar dale ban jate hai
 Due to the constant impact of gravity, these pulses cause collisions and congestion and gradually become large pieces of debris that form planets, satellites and separate objects simultaneously over time

 These planets and satellites sometimes collide in the first stages of the creation of a planetary circle, which sometimes causes them to break and sometimes become larger

 Later, he became involved in studying Sanskrit, Vedas, scriptures and other religious books to become a priest
 unke jivan main aisi bahut si ghatnaayen huin, jinhone unhen hindu dharm kii parmparik manyataon or ishwar ke bare main gambhir prashn poochne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Once there is an incident of Shivaratri

 On that day of Shivaratri, his entire family stayed in a temple for night awakening
 saare parivaar ke so jane ke pashchaat bhi ve jaagate rahe ki bhagwaan shiv aayenge or prasad grahan karenge
 He saw that the rats were eating the bhog kept for Shivji

 Due to the death of his younger sister and uncle due to cholera, he started thinking deeply on the meaning of life and death and started to ask questions which made his parents worried
 tab unke mata-pita ne unka vivaah kishoravastha ke prarambh main hi karne kaa nirnay kiya main yah aam pratha thi)
 But the boy Moolshankar decided that marriage was not made for him and in 1846 he set out in search of truth

 He made it his goal to rejuvenate the Aryavarta Hindu society, regardless of anyone's opposition and condemnation

 He got a new feeling
 ve ghar se nikal pade or yatra karte hue vah guru virajanand ke paas pahunche

 This is your gurudakshina
 unhone aashirwad diya ki ishwar unke purusharth ko safal kare
 He gave the final teachings - Manuscripts condemn God and Rishis, not Rishikrit texts

 Do not leave this criterion by hand

 It was here that he told the then Viceroy, i want the state of foreigners is also not completely pleasing

 It is difficult to prove the full benevolence and intent of mutual interaction without leaving it

 The rules and principles of Arya Samaj are for the welfare of the pranamatra

 i believe that there is nothing wrong in the Gita
 iske alaava gita vedon ke khilaaf nahin he
 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhen agaadh gyaan tha
 He was fluent in Sanskrit
 saath hi ve prachand taarkik the
 He studied the Christian and Muslim scriptures thoroughly
 atev akele hi unhone teen-teen morchon par sangharsh aarambh kar diya
 The two fronts were of Christianity and Islam, but the third front was of Sanatanadharmi Hindus, in which Swamiji had to face many insults, stigmas and sufferings
 dayanand ne buddhivaad kii jo mashaal jalaayee thi, uskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying
 hindu navotthana ab puure prakaash main aa gaya tha or anek samajhadaar log man hi man anubhav karne lage the ki vastav main puranic dharm kii pongapathi main koi saar nahin he
 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity
 apane mahagranth satyarth prakaash main swamiji ne sabhi maton main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa khandan kiya he
 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta
 san 1872 i
 main swami ji kalakatta padhaare
 There Devendranath Thakur and Keshav Chandra Sen gave him a big welcome
 brahmo samaajiyon se unka vichaar-vimarsh bhi hua kintu isiyat se prabhavit brahmo samaji vidwaan punarjanm or veda kii pramanikta ke vishay main swami se ekamat nahin ho sake
 It is said that in Calcutta itself, Keshav Chandra Sen advised Swamiji that if you leave Sanskrit and start speaking in Aryabhasa, then there can be immense favor of the country
 tabhi se swami ji ke vyakhyanon kii bhashaa aryabhasha ho gayi or aryabhashi praanton main unhe aganit anuyaayi milane lage
 Swamiji came to Mumbai from Calcutta and on 10 April 1875, he founded the 'arya Samaj'
 mumbai main unke saath prarthana samaaj waalon ne bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 But this society was a Mumbai version of Brahmo society
 atev swami ji se is samaaj ke log bhi ekamat nahin ho sake
 Swamiji came to Indraprastha after returning from Mumbai
 vahaan unhone satyanusndhan ke liye isai, musalmaan or hindu panditon kii ek sabha bulaayi
 But even after two days of deliberations, people could not reach any conclusion
 indraprastha se swami ji punjab gaye
 a lot of enthusiasm arose in Punjab and Aryasamaj branches started opening up all over the province
 tabhi se punjab aryasamajiyon kaa pradhan garh rahaa he
 Maharishi Dayanand attacked them fearlessly, in order to remove the social evils and superstitions and evils prevailing in the then society

 He opposed the birth caste and talked about the Vedanukool varna-determination of karma
 ve dalitoddhar ke pakshdhar the
 He started a strong movement for the education of women

 ve taitravaad ke samarthak the
 His philosophical views were Vedanukool
 unhone yah bhi mana ki jeev karm karne main swatantra hai tathaa fal bhogane main paratantra hai
 Maharishi Dayanand was trying to establish unity by bringing all the religious leaders on one platform
 unhone indraprastha darbar ke samay 1878 main aisa prayaas kiya tha
 His fundamental ideas in his immortal treatise Satyarth Prakash, Sanskar Vidhi and Rigvedadi Bhasya are clearly attainable
 ve yogi the tathaa pranayam par unka vishesh bal tha
 He was in favor of participation of all varnas and women in social restructuring
 rashtriya jaagran kii disha main unhone saamaajik kranti tathaa aadhyatmik punarutthan ke maarg ko apanaaya
 The foresight, patriotism and pragmatism displayed in his education concepts are completely relevant and contemporary
 maharishi dayanand samaaj sudhaarak tathaa dharmik punarjagran ke pravartak to the hi, ve prachand rashtravaadi tathaa rajnatik adarshavaadi bhi the
 Due to the state of foreigners being in the Aryavarta, there are differences, differences, no consumption of celibacy, reading and studying the law and self-immolation in childhood, sensuality, false language, kulakshan, propagation of Vedas, etc
 are misdeeds
 The brothers fight and then the third foreigner comes and becomes a punch
 unhone rajdhyaksh tathaa shashan kii vibhinn parishadon evam samitiyon ke liye aavashyak yogyataon ko bhi ginaya he
 He favored the system of justice based on sage pranit texts
 swami dayanand saraswati ko saamanyat: keval arya samaaj ke sansthaapak tathaa samaaj-sudhaarak ke rup main hi janaa jaataa he
 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 vichaar vimarsh tathaa yojana-nirdhaaran ke uparant swami ji to haridwar main hi ruk gaye tathaa anya paanchon rashtriya netaa yojana ko yatharth rup dene ke liye apane-apane sthanon par chale gaye
 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, the British officers had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different kinds of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled
