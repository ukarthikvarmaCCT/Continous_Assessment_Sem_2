 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Dyslexia ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Template: Dyslexia dyslexia is a learning disability that manifests itself primarily in the form of difficulties in visual marking of speech or written language, especially in reading man-made writing systems
 This differs from reading difficulties arising from other factors such as non-neurological lack of hearing or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instructions, suggesting that dyslexia may have occurred due to differences in the way languages are written and spoken by the intellect
 is
 dislexia kii anekon paribhaashaayen hai lekin koi sahmati nahin he
 Some definitions are purely descriptive, while other factors embody theories
 aisa prathit hota he ki dislexia koi ek cheez nahin balki anek he, kyonki yah kai kaarnon se hone vaali kai pathan kala kii dikkaton or kamiyon ke sankalpanaatmak samashodhan-grih kii tarah kaam karti he
 Most of the currently available dyslexia research is related to the alphabet writing system and especially to languages of European origin, although more research related to dyslexia and other writing systems is slowly coming to light
 yah dislexia ko ek or adhik saarvbhaumik vyapak pariprekshya pradaan karegaa
 Cassells and Colthart, 1993, have compared acoustic and superficial types of developmental dyslexia to classical subtypes of acquired dyslexia that are classified according to the rate of reading errors in non-words
 However, the difference between superficial and acoustical dyslexia has not replaced the old empirical terminology of unsynchronized versus dyseidetic types of dyslexia
 The superficial / acoustic distinction is only descriptive and devoid of the aetiological perception of the underlying brainstem, whereas the nonmetabolic / dysacidic distinction is related to two different mechanisms, one related to the lack of speech discrimination and the other to the visual perception effect
 Most people with Bodder's dyslexic type of dyslexia have attentional and spatial difficulties that complicate the reading process
 haalanki dislexia ek snaivik antar kaa parinaam mana jaataa he, yah ek bauddhik viklaangata nahin he
 Dyslexia is found in people of all levels of intelligence
 1881 main oswald barkhaan ne ise pahachaanaa or rudolph berlin ne 1887 main ise 'dislexia' naam diya , 1896 main, dablyoo pringal morgan ne british medical jarnal "kongenital verde blindness" main ek pathan sambandhit seekhney ke vikaar kaa varnan kiya
 During the 1890s and early 1900s, James Hinschelwood published a series of articles in medical journals describing similar cases of the term blindness
 1917 main apni kitaab janmajaat shabd drishtiheenta, main hinshelwood ne is baat par jor diya ki praathmik viklaangata shabdon or aksharon ke liye drishy smriti main he or unhone isamen akshar reversal, tathaa vartanee or pathan kii dikkaton jaise lakshanon kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 According to 1925 Samuel T
 Orton is a syndrome unrelated to brain damage that causes difficulty in learning to read
 aurton ke siddhant stressosimboliya ke anusaar dislexia vaale logon ko shabdon ke drishy roopon ko unke bhashya roopon ke saath sambandh sthapit karne main kathinaayee aati he
 Orton found that reading deficiencies in dyslexia were not occurring simply because of vision deficiencies
 unka vishwaas tha ki mastishk main hemispherick prabhutv kii sthapana main vifaltaa iskaa kaaran he
 Orton later developed an educational intervention with psychologist and teacher Anna Gillingham that began the experiment of Cymalthenius multi-sensory constriction
 iske vipareet, dearborn, benet, tathaa blue ke anusaar iskaa kaaran dekhne kii pranali kaa ek dosha tha
 He tried to find out whether the spontaneous movement of the eyes from the left to right would be helpful to explain the facts seen in dyslexia disorder, especially the ability to read upside down

 This phenomina is clearly associated with the dynamics of vision, disappears when the space between letters is increased and converts reading to spelling

 In the 1970s, a new hypothesis emerged that dyslexia arises due to a lack of phonological processing or difficulty understanding how words are formed by discrete sounds
 prabhavit logon ko in dhvaniyon kaa unke aksharon ke saath sambandh bithaane main dikkat aati he
 Many studies have understood the importance of sound awareness, 1979 galaburda or cemper or galaburda it al 1985, dislexia grast logon ke mastishk ke autopsi pashchaat parikshan dwaara

 1993 Cassells and Colthart described developmental dyslexia as two prevalent and distinct varieties using subtypes of alexia, superficial and acoustic dyslexia
 Mannis et al 1996, came to the conclusion that there are probably more than two subtypes of dyslexia associated with many inherent deficiencies
 1994 post autopsi spacimen dwaara galaburda it al, ne yah report kiya: dislexia grast logon main asaamaanya auditory pressesing yah darshata he ki auditory system main sanrachanaatmak asaamanyataayen sambhawatah maujuud rahi hongi

 The development of neuroimaging techniques during the 1980s and 1990s made possible significant advances in dyslexia research
 pojitron emishan tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging adhyayanon ne vayask saamaanya adhyayan ke tantrika hastakshar ko ujagar kar diya he or dhwani prasanskaran kaa prayog karte hue, in adhyayanon ne dislexia main disfunctional dhvanikrut processing ko baanye-hemi sphier sthit pericelvian kshetra main loklij kar diya he, khaskar aksharatmak lekhan pranali ke liye

 1999 Wiedel and Butterworth described a case of an english-japanese bilingual person
 It has been suggested that a language in which the mapping of orthology to orthography is transparent or opaque, or that a language whose orthographic unit representing the voice is coarse is not likely to have more cases of dyslexia and orthography may affect the symptoms of dyslexia
 2003 colins or rurke ke rivyuu ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki mastishk or dislexia ke sambandhon ke vartmaan model aamtaur par mastishk vikaas ke kisi dosha par dhyaan kendrit karte hai

 According to this theory, reading is an unnatural act and is being done by human beings in our evolutionary history from a very brief period
 The practice of Western societies to promote reading among the general public is not very old, so the forces that shape our behavior are quite weak

 Makkhali Gosal or Makkhali Goshal is a prominent living philosopher of the 6th century
 inhen naastik parampara ke sabase lokapriy ‘aajeevak sampradaay’ kaa sansthaapak, 24waan tirthankar or ‘niyatwaad’ kaa pravartak darshanik mana jaataa he
 In Jain and Buddhist texts, he has been described as 'makkhaliputt Goshal', 'goshalak Mankhaliputt' while in the Shanti Parva of 'mahabharata' he has been called 'manki' Rishi
 ye mahavir or buddha ke samakaleen the
 Historians believe that the materialistic and atheistic philosophical traditions of Jainism, Buddhism and charvaka-lokayat are only shadows or extensions of Makkhali Gosal's livelihood philosophy
 makali gosaal ke bare main koi bhi praathmik or pramanik strot uplabdh nahin he
 For information on Makkhali Gosal and the Ajivak sect, historians rely entirely on the inscriptions found in the 'bhagavati Sutras' of the Jain Agam and the 'samnaphal Sutta' of the Buddhist scripture Dighi Nikaya and in the Mauryugin par caves, which include Makkhali Gosal and his livelihood followers
 And he has been ridiculed for referring to the Buddha as inferior

 According to Jain texts, Makkhali used to wander with an idol in his hand
 isiilie jainon or baudhon ne unhen ‘macaliputt goshaal’ kaha he
 In ancient Sanskrit texts, they have also been called 'muskari Goshal' because the livelihood people used to run 'muskari' in their hands

 Kharagpur was selected for the first campus of the Indian Institute of Technology
 vartmaan samay main yahaan kai audyogic ikaiyaan bhi sthapit hai
 Kharagpur derives its name from Mallabhum, the twelfth king of Kharga Malla, when he conquered it
 khadgpur hijli samrajya kaa hissaa tha or hindu uriya shaskaon ne urisa ke gajpati raajaaon ke tahat ek vivaad ke rup main shashan kiya tha
 Historians claim that in the 16th century, Kharagpur was a small village surrounded by dense forest
 gaanv ucch chattani banjar bhoomi par tha
 The only place of residence near Kharagpur was Hijli
 hijli bengal kii khadi ke delta main rasulpur nadi ke tat par ek chota dweep gaanv tha
 It developed into a port city in 1687
 hijli bhi ek praant tha or yah 1886 tak astitv main tha
 It included parts of Bengal and Orissa
 iske paas tamaluk, pansura or debara jaise mahatvapurn shahar the, uttar main dakshin main kelghai or haldi nadiyon ke saath, or purv main bengal kii khadi or khadgpur, keshari, dantan or jaleshwar se ghire purvi paksh the
 Hijli was ruled by Taj Khan who was a disciple of Guru Pir mcdrum Sha Chisti
 kushan, gupta or paal rajwanshon or mughalon dwaara bhi iskaa shashan kiya gaya tha
 It is said that during the reign of Hijli and the reign of the Mughal Raj, Hijli had excellent trade and trading centers with judiciary, prisons and administrative offices
 hijli kii rajdhani baheri main 1628 tak thi or use baad main hijli main sthanantarit kar diya gaya tha
 Hijli province was at its peak in 1754 and was extremely prosperous during this period

 In 1687 Job Charnock with troops and warships captured Hijli, defeating Hijli and Mughal defenders
 mughalon ke saath yuddh ke baad, job charnok or mughal samraat ke bich ek sandhi par hastakshar kiye gaye
 The loss incurred by Job Charnock forced him to leave Hijli and move towards Uluberia, while the Mughal emperor continued to rule the province
 vahaan se, ve antat purvi bharat main apana vyavsaay sthapit karne ke liye kolkata main sutanuti main bas gaye
 This was the beginning of the East India Company in India
 hijli jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai aaj hi hijli praant kaa ek chota sa hissaa he, or 1 9veen shatabdi main angrejon dwaara prashasnic karyaalayon kii sthapana ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 It is curious that the entire Kharagpur division of today has the same boundaries as the Hijli province
 18 veen shatabdi main khejuri, ek or bandargah shahar delta kshetra main kukhali nadi ke tat par sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It was mainly established by the British to do business with European countries
 khejuri bhi ek dweep tha

 Headache is only a symptom, not a disease
 iske anek kaaran ho sakate hai, jaise saadhaaran chintaa se lekar ghaatak mastishk arbud tak
 It is not possible to describe more than a hundred reasons for this, but notable reasons are described in the following groups: 1

 The total population of Samians has been estimated between 1
5 to 2 lakhs
 samiyon ko europe main pehle 'lap' yaa 'laplander' bulaayaa jaataa tha, lekin sami ab ise ek apshabd samajhate hai kyonki iskaa matlab ' kapade kaa chithda' he
 This word meant that the Sami are poor and fathala
 sami log apni mathrubhumi main pichley 5,000 saalon se bas rahe hai, haalaanki inke ilaaken main 10,000 varsh puraane avshesh mili hai jinamein se kuch par usee prakaar ke chithran hai jo sami aaj bhi paramparaagat rup se prayog karte hai

 At first it was believed that they lived north of central Scandinavia, but modern discovery has also found medieval Semitic remains in some parts of southern Norway
 18veen sadi tak sami log bahut had tak norge se swatantra jivan vyateet karte the, lekin 19veen sadi main apane raashtra ko sangathit karne ke prayaas main norge ne samiyon par apni samskruti chhodkar norgeian samskruti or bhashaa apnaane ke liye dabaav daalaa
 Northern Norway was developed, and it also created an inferiority complex among the Samians for their culture
 sweden or finland main itnaa dabaav nahin tha lekin vahaan bhi paathshaalaon main sami bhashaaon par pabandi laga di gai
 In Sweden, under the racist policies of 1913–1920, the Samians were described as an inferior caste
 jivit logon or qabron main dafan shariron se adhyayan ke liye sample liye gaye
 Some Sami women were forcefully sterilized so that they could not produce children
 norgeian logon ko sami kshetron main ghuskar basane ke liye riyaayaten di gai

 The Samians strongly opposed this
 band phir bhi bana lekin is ghatana se samiyon main apane adhikaron or apni pahchaan le liye ladane kii ek nai chetana janmi
 In 1986 the Samians created their own national anthem and flag

 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha

 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better

 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time

 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 He also wrote that the Knowledge Dictionary of Hindi is not a translation of Bangla, but was originally written in Hindi

 That is why, by appreciative patience, he immediately laid the foundation of the Hindi encyclopedia and completed it
