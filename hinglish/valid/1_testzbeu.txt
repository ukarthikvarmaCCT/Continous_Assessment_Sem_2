 - jaaysi The explanation given to the word 'avadhoot' at the beginning of Avadhootopanishad gives a description of the personality of the person indicated by this verse
 is upanishad ke anusaar is shabd main aae a kaa akshartv athwa aksharpad, va kaa arth varenya kaa sarvshereshth pad, dhu kaa arth dhoot sansarvardhan athwa sansaarik vaasanaon kaa uchchhed or t kaa arth he tatvamasyadilakshyatv
 In addition to this Upanishads, lectures of a specific person from this post are available in texts like Avadhutagita, Gorakshanathar Siddha-siddhanta-santra, Goraksha-siddhanta-sangraha etc
 "mahanirvanatantr" main pradhanat: chaar prakaar ke avadhoot kahe gaye hai : "brahmavadhoota" who is the Brahmpaspaka of any varna and is in any ashram; "shaivavadhoot" jo vidhipurvak sanyas le chukaa ho: "beeravadhoot" with long and scattered hair on the head, a necklace or a rosary of Rudraksh, a kapin in the cuticle, a body of ash or bloodstains, the wood in the hand, the urn and the dum degree and together with the antelope; "kulavadhoot" jo kulachaar main abhishik hokar bhi grihasthashram main rahe
 Among the disciples of Ramananda under the Vaishnava sect, sadhus called Avadhoota are also found
 inke sir par bade-bade bal rahete hai, gale main sphatik kii maala rahati he or sharir par kantha evam haath main dariyaan khappar dikh padate hai

 bhiksha ke liye jab ye grihasthon ke dwaar par jate hai tab "bir avadhoot" naam kaa samaran karke ekataraa yaa anya vaadyayantra bajaakar gane lag jate hai
 These people often remain in chaos
 inhen bengal main kabhi-kabhi 'boul' naam se bhi abhihit karte hai jo sarvatha inase bhinn varg ke kuch anya laagon kii hi vaastavik sangya he
 Avadhuta's position in Nagapat is considered extremely high and according to "goraksha-siddhanta-sangraha" he is devoid of all types of nature disorders
 vah kaivalya kii uplabdhi ke liye aatmaswaroop ke anusandhan main nirat rahaa karata he or uski anubhuti nirgun evam sagun se pare hoti he
 Guru Dattatreya is also called Avadhuta and is fully discussed in the Datta sect
 pashchimottar pradesh main un striyon ko "avadhooti" kehete hai jo purush sanyasi ke vesh main rahakar bhasma, rudrakshadi dhaaran karti hai tathaa saadhaarant: kisi gangagiri naam kii waisi hi sanyasin yaa avadhutani kii parampara kii samajhi jaati hai
 In Tantric Buddhist practice, three nadis called lalana, rasna and avadhuti are considered prominent

 swar-sandhi paanch prakaar kii hoti hai - sutra-ak: Savarna Long: That is, when the Savarna comes after a pratyahar, both of them become long
 hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u ke baad yadi hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u aa jaaen to donon milakar deergh aa, i or uu ho jate hai
 like - a / aa + a / aa = aa Treaty of e and e u or uu kii sandhi It consists of A, a before E, e then A; If there is O, o is o and if there is R, it becomes Ar
 ise gun-sandhi kehete hai
 like - a + i = e ; nar + indra = narendra a + u = O; Wisdom + sermon = sermon; a + ri = ar dev + rishi = devarshi Aa + r = Ar Maha + Rishi = Maharishi a, aa kaa e, i se mail hone par i tathaa a, aa kaa o, ou se mail hone par ou ho jaataa he
 This is called growth pact
 jaise - a + a = Ai; a + a = acac; a + o = ou van + aushadhi = vanaushadhi ; aa + o = ou maha + aushadhi = mahaushadhi ; If there is an exogenous vowel in front of E, E, e becomes 'Y'
 u, uu ke aage kisi vijaateey swar ke aane par u uu ko ‘v’ ho jaataa he
 When a foreign vowel comes in front of 'R', r becomes 'R'
 inhen yan-sandhi kehete hai
 e + a = or + A; River + Arpan = Removal u + e = v + e ; anu + eshan = anveshan Any vowel beyond A, Ai and Ou becomes Ay, Ay, Av and Av respectively
 ise ayaadi sandhi kehete hai
 a + a = Ay + A; Ne + un = nayan i + a = aay + a ; gai + ak = gayak o + a = av + a; Po + Un = Wind ou + a = aav + a ; pau + ak = paavak Au + e = Av + E; Nine + iq = sailor vyanjan kaa vyanjan se athwa kisi swar se mail hone par jo parivartan hota he use vyanjan sandhi kehete hai
 like-sharat + Chandra = Sharachandra
 ujjwal If the first letter of a square, ch, t, t, p matches the third or fourth letter of a class or is a word, l, l, v, or a vowel, then k is called g, t is d
 And p becomes ble
 jaise - If the first letter of a class matches the letter n or m then it becomes the fifth character of the same class
 jaise - If the word combines with c, d, d, d, b, b, y, r, or or any vowel, it becomes d
 jaise - Beyond T, it becomes l when it is or is not J, i get j or J, i get t or i get T, Dr or i get d and l is taken
 jaise - If t combines with Sch, then t becomes ch and ch becomes ch
 jaise - If t combines with h then t becomes d and h is D
 jaise - If the six letters come after the vowel, then the six letters before the six are increased
 jaise - If there is a consonant from k to m after M, then m changes to Anuswara
 jaise - After M, m becomes dual
 jaise - m is a reminder after a dish containing any of the words y, y, l, l, v, sh,,, st, h
 jaise - R, र, becomes n beyond N
 parantu chavarg, tavarg, tavarg, sha or sa kaa vyavdhaan ho jane par n kaa n nahin hota
 like - s se pehle a, aa se bhinn koi swar aa jaae to s ko sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad swar yaa vyanjan aane par visarg main jo vikaar hota he use visarg-sandhi kehete hai
 Like- manah + favorable = manokool visarg ke pehle yadi ‘a’ or baad main bhi ‘a’ athwa virgon ke tisare, chauthe paanchaven varna, athwa ya, r, l, va ho to visarg kaa o ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ko chhodkar koi swar ho or baad main koi swar ho, varg ke tisare, chauthe, paanchaven varna athwa y, r, l, va, ha main se koi ho to visarg kaa r yaa r ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle koi swar ho or baad main c, chha yaa sha ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad yadi t yaa sa ho to visarg s ban jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle i, u or baad main k, kha, t, tha, pa, pha main se koi varna ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ho or baad main koi bhinn swar ho to visarg kaa lop ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad k, kha athwa pa, pha hone par visarg main koi parivartan nahin hota
 like - mohaddichak jagadishpur, bhagalpur, bihar sthit ek gaanv he

 Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined Euclid's mathematical ray arguments, Galen's medical tradition, and Aristotle's intromission theories

 He attempted to solve this by saying that the eye perceives only the rays perpendicular to the object — because at any point on the eye only the ray which is seen directly reaches it, without refracting from any other part of the eye, to be supposed

 Since there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any point, and all these rays would converge on the center of the eye in a cone, this allowed them to send multiple points to solve an object's problem
 aankh; agar keval lambavat kiran mattered, to uske paas ek se ek patrachaar tha or bhram hal kiya ja saktaa he
 He later emphasized that other rays would be refracted through the eye and believed to be perpendicular
 lambavat kirnon ke bare main unke tark spasht rup se spasht nahin karte hai ki keval lambavat kirnon ko kyon mana jaataa tha; kamjor oblique kirnon ko or adhik kamjor kyon nahin mana jayega? unke baad ke tark main ki apavartit kirnon ko mana jayega jaise lambavat prathit nahin hota he
 However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was very influential, especially in Western Europe: directly or indirectly, his De Aspectibus induced more activity in optics between the 13th Done and 17th century
 kepler ke baad ke retina chhavi ke siddhant sidhe alhasen ke vaicharik dhaanche par banaaya
 Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and various experiments are done with lenses, mirrors, refraction, and reflection

 For example, he described what happened in Herring's law of equal protection in the 19th century
 unhone agilonius se 600 saal pehle urdhwadhar kshitij kaa varnan likhaa tha jo vastav main agilonius kii tulana main aadhunik paribhaasha ke kareeb he- or doorabeen asamanta par unke kaam ko 1858 main panem dwaara doharaaya gaya tha
 Craig ion-stockdale, agreeing that Alhazen should be credited With many advances, some caution is needed, especially when considering Allezen in isolation from Ptolemy, who Alhazen was highly familiar with
 alhasen ne doorabeen drushti ke bare main tolemi kii ek mahatvapurn truti ko sahi kiya, lekin anyathaa unka khaataa bahut samaan he; tolemi ne yah bhi bataane kaa prayaas kiya ki ab hering ke kanoon ko kya kaha jaataa he
 In general, Alhazen built and expanded Ptolemy's optics
 lijun or sabra ke aadhaar par doorabeen drushti ke adhyayan main ebn al-hetham ke yogadan ke ek or vistrut vivaran main, renud ne dikhaaya ki patrachaar, homonymous or paar diplopia kii avadharanaen jagah par thim ebn al-hetham ke prakaashiki main
 But unlike Howard, he explained why Ibn al-haytham did not give the spherical figures of the terrible and why, due to experimental reasoning, they were actually closer to discovering Panam's fusion zone than the Vi -t-müller circle
 is sambandh main, ebn al-hetham ke doorabeen drushti ke siddhant ne do mukhya simaaon kaa saamana kiya: retina kii bhoomika kii manyata kii kami, or spasht rup se okular tract kii prayogtmak jaanch kii kami
 Alhazen's most original contribution was that after contemplating how the eye was created anatomically, he considered how it would function anatomically as an optical system
 unke prayogon se pinhole prakshepan kii unki samaj ne ankhon main chhavi vichlan ke bare main apane vichaar ko prabhavit kiya he, jise unhone taalna chaahate the
 He stated that the perpendicular rays on the lens were pushed forward as they left glacial humor and that the resulting image was straightened into the optic nerve behind the eye
 unhone galen kaa maananaa tha ki lens drushti kaa grahan karne vaala ang tha, haalanki unke kuch kaam sanket dete hai ki unhone sochaa tha ki retina bhi shaamil thi
 Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision followed the Aristotelian scheme, which comprehensively describes the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion

 According to Matthias Schram, Alhazen was "the first to systematically use the method of differentiation in an experimental situation, in one experiment showing that through two small apertures on a screen formed by a projection of the intensity of light projection The moonlight continuously decreases as one of the apertures is gradually blocked
 jije tumer ne shraam ke vichaar ke bare main kuch andeh vyakt kiya, bahes karte hue ki alhasen ke kaam ke bahut bade sharir main aniatik rup se vishesh maarg padhane se bachane ke liye saavdhaanee kii aavashyaktaa he, kyonki us samay, unki pustak optics abhi tak nahin hui thi arabi se puri tarah se anuvaadit
 While acknowledging the importance of Alhazen in the development of experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers
 tumer yah sweekaar karata he ki "shraamam vaigyanik paddati ke vikaas main uplabdhi ko bataata he
 "toomer's 1964 list, as a precondition, is necessary for historians to examine Schram's claim that Ibn al-haytham was the true founder of modern physics, a translation of Ibn al-haytham
 mark smith ne aljazen ke dohare drushti, pratibimb, or apvartan main tolmi ke prayogon ke vistaar ko yaad kiya: alhazen kii optics pustak ne europe, roger bekan, vitelo or pekaham main pariprekshyavaadiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Optics was incorporated into Risner's 1572 printing of the optine thesaurus, through which Kepler eventually resolved the contradictions inherent in Vitello's explanation of the imaging chain, from the outer object to the retina of the eye
 book of optics ke book ve main catopatricks par unke kaam main ab elsen kii samasya ke rup main janaa jane vaala ek charchaa he, jise pehali baar 150 isvi main tolmi dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It consists of drawing lines from two points in the plane of the circle meeting at a point on the perimeter and making equal angles with the normal at that point
 yah ek golakaar billiard teble ke kinare par bindu khojane ke baraabar he jis par ek khilaadi ko kisi die gaye bindu par ek kyuu gend kaa lakshya rakhana chahie taaki vah teble kinare se oochaal sake or duusari gend par duusari gend ko hit kar sake
 Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "looking at a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will appear on the eye of the observer
 " yah chauthi degree ke sameekaran kii ore jaataa he
 This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of the fourth powers, where only the formula for sums of first squares and cubes was stated
 kisi bhi abhinn shaktiyon ke yoga ke liye sutara ko khojane ke liye unki vidhi ko aasaani se samanyikrut kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki unhone swayan aisa nahin kiya 
 He used his result on the sum of integral powers to be now called integration, where the formulas for the integral squares and the fourth powers formulas allowed him to calculate the amount of paraboloid

 Kitab al-manazir describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain some optical phenomena using mechanical means
 unhone projectile ke saath prayog kiye or nishkarsh nikaala ki satahon par lambavat projectile kaa prabhaav keval unhen ghusane ke liye paryaapt tha, jabaki satahon ne tirchhi projectile strike ko hataane ke liye majaboor kiya
 For example, to explain refraction from a rare to dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown on a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet
 ek lambavat phenk slate ko todta he or gujarata he, jabaki baraabar bal or baraabar duuri se ek tirchhi nahin hota he
 He also described this result by showing how intense, direct light hurts the eye using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen is associated with 'strong' light with vertical rays and 'weak' light
 kai kirnon or ankhon kii samasya kaa spasht uttar lambavat kiran kii pasand main tha, kyonki vastu kii sataha par prayek bindu se keval ek aisi kiran ankhon main pravesh kar sakati he
 Sudanese psychologist Omar Khalifa has argued that for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusion, Aljazan should be considered the founder of experimental psychology
 khalipha ne yah bhi tark diya he ki alhasen ko " manovigyaan ke sansthaapak" bhi mana janaa chahie, jo up-anushaasan or aadhunik manovigyaan ke agradoot hai
 Although Alhazen made several subjective reports about vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychology techniques and the claim has been rejected
 alhasen ne chandramaa bhram kii vyakhya kii peshkash kii, ek bhram jisane madhyayugin europe kii vaigyanik parampara main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Many authors repeatedly gave explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the large visible moon near the horizon when it was high in the sky
 alhazen ne tolmi ke apvartan siddhant ke khilaaf tark diya, or asli, vistaar ke bajaay, kathith rup se samasya ko paribhaashit kiya
 He stated that determining the distance of an object depends on the uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer
 jab chandramaa akaash main ooncha hota he to koi hastkshep karne vaali vasteen nahin hoti hai, isliye chandramaa nazadik dikhaai detaa he
 The approximate size of an object of constant angular size varies with its approximate distance
 isliye, chandramaa aasmaan main kareeb or chote dikhaai detaa he, or kshitij par aage or bada hota he
 Based on Alhazen's explanations through works by Roger Bacon, John Peacham, and Vitello, the Moon illusion was gradually accepted as a psychological phenomenon, rejecting the refraction theory in the 17th century
 haalanki alhasen ko aksar anumaanit duuri spashtikaran ke saath shrey diya jaataa he, lekin vah ise pesh karne vaale pehle lekhak nahin the
 Cleomades gave this account, and he credited it to Posidonius
 tolmi ne apane prakaashiki main is spashtikaran kii peshkash bhi kii ho sakati he, lekin paath aspasht he
 Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than these earlier writers, and this probably explains why Alhazen received credit
 optical granth optics kii pustak ke alaava, alhazen ne usee vishay par kai anya granthon ko likhaa, jinamein unki risaala faai-don ' shaamil he
 He investigated the qualities of brightness, rainbow, eclipse, snake, and moonlight

 Alhazen discussed the physics of the celestial sphere in his epitome of astronomy, arguing that the Ptolemaic model should be understood in terms of physical objects in terms of physical objects — in other words that it is possible to construct physical models in any of them
 Neither will the celestial bodies collide with each other
 dharti kendrit tolmik model ke liye yantric model ke suzav "pashchim ke isaayiyon ke bich tolmik pranali kii aakhri jeet main yogadan diya"
 Alhazen's determination to route astronomy into the realm of physical objects was important, however, which meant that the astronomical hypothesis was "responsible for the laws of physics", and could be criticized and improved in those terms
 unhone makala faai al-qamaar bhi likhaa
 In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of the body
 place on tritis on place main, alhazen aristotl ke vichaar se asahmat the ki prakruti ek shunya kaa ulanghan karti he, or unhone us sthaan ko pradarshit karne ke prayaas main jyamiti kaa upyog kiya aantarik satahon ke bich kalpana kii gai tri-aiami shunya he ek yukt sharir On his configuration of the world Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the Earth: puri tarah se prithvi ek gol kshetra he jiskaa centre duniya kaa centre he
 It is stable in its middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any variety of motion, but always at rest
 }} The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's Almagest, which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries and later influenced astronomers such as George von Peerbach during the European Middle Ages and the Renaissance
 apane al-shukk 'al batalamuon main, tolmi ke khilaaf tolmi yaa aporiyas ke bare main dabets ke rup main anuvaadit, 1025 or 1028 ke bich kuch samay main prakashit, alhazen ne tolmi ke almaguest, planetary hypothis or optics kii aalochana kii, jisamen unhone in vibhinn virodhabhaason ko ingit kiya vishesh rup se khagol vigyaan main kaam karata he
 Ptolemy's Almagest was concerned with mathematical theories regarding the motion of planets, while hypotheses concerned that Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of planets
 tolmi ne swayan sweekaar kiya ki unke siddhant or vinyas hameshaa ek-duusare se sahamat nahin the, bahes karte hue ki yah koi samasya nahin thi, basharte iskaa koi dhyaan dene yogya truti na ho, lekin alhazen tolmi ke kaaryon main antarnihit virodhabhaason kii aalochana main vishesh rup se chintit the
 He supposedly introduced some mathematical tools into Ptolemy astronomy, particularly failing to meet the physical requirement of equal, uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity related to actual physical motion to imaginary mathematical points, lines, and circles
 : tolmi ne ek vyavastha grahan kiya jo astitv main nahin ho saktaa he, or tathy yah he ki yah vyavastha unki kalpana main utpann karti he, grahon se sambandhit gati unhen apane anumaanit vyavastha main kiye gaye truti se mukt nahin karti he, kyonki maujuuda gati ke liye grah ek aisi vyavastha kaa parinaam nahin ho sakate jo astitv main asambhav he

 }} samasyaon ko ingit karne ke baad, alhasen ne baad main kaam main tolmi main bataae gaye virodhabhaason ko hal karne kaa iraadaa kiya he
 Alhazen believed that there was a "real configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to understand
 vah tolmi kii pranali ko puraa karne or marammat karne kaa iraadaa rakhata tha, ise puri tarah se pratisthapit nahin karata tha
 In doubt about Ptolemy Alhazen presented his views on the difficulty of obtaining scientific knowledge and the need to ask existing authorities and theories: unhone kaha ki maujuuda siddhanton kii aalochana - jo is pustak par haaavee he-vaigyanik gyaan ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan rakhti he
 Model c of Motion of each of Alhazen's seven planets was written
 1038
 keval ek kshatigrast pandulipi paaya gaya he, keval parichay or pehla khand, grah gati ke siddhant par, jivit he
 Following his doubts on Ptolemy, Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, which describes the motion of planets in terms of spheres, geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry
 unhone ek bhugarbheey brahmad rakhaa or mana ki khagoleey gati samaan rup se paripatr he, jiske liye uparokt gati ko samajhane ke liye mahakavy shaamil karnaa aavashyak he, lekin vah tolmi ke baraabar ko khatm karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 In general, his model did not seek to explain the causes of motion, but focused on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain the observed motion without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model
 alhazen ne kul pachchis khagoleey kaaryon ko likhaa, kuch takneekee muddon se sambandhit hai jaise ki meridian kaa sateek nirdhaaran, sateek khagoleey avlokan se sambandhit ek doosraa samooh, vibhinn khagoleey samasyaon or milky ve ke sthaan jaise prashnon se sambandhit teesraa samooh; al-hajen ek dur sthaan ke liye tark diya, is tathy ke aadhaar par ki yah nishchit sitaron ke sambandh main nahin chalata he

 In his analysis and synthesis, he may be the first to say that each is also the correct number form 2n-1 where 2n-1 is primary, but he was not able to prove this result; Euler later proved it in the 18th century
 alhazen ne wilson ke prameya ko ab jise istemaal kiya jaataa he, kaa upyog karke sangatta se judi samasyaon ko hal kiya
 In his Opusula, Alhazen considers the solution to the system of homogeneity, and gives two general methods of solution
 unki pehali vidhi, cannical vidhi main wilson ke prameya shaamil the, jabaki unki duusari vidhi main chini shesh prameya kaa ek sanskaran shaamil tha
 Alhazen traced the sum formula for the fourth power, which can usually be used to determine for any integral power

 Without tangible ideas of the size and shape of distance, vision can tell us nothing about such things
 " Alhazan was a Muslim, however, it is not certain which schools of Islam he belonged to
 sunni ke rup main, vah yaa to ashaari skool kaa anuyaayi ho saktaa he, yaa mutajili skool ke anuyaayi 
 Sabra also suggested that he may be a follower of Shia Islam
