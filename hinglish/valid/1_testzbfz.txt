 Other approaches include using arrays of real-value numbers rather than using bit series to express chromosomes
 Theoretically, the smaller the character, the better the performance, but ironically, good results have been obtained using chromosomes of the real value

 According to these characteristics, direct current range motors are the most suitable and commonly used, but direct current motors are generally not suitable for actuation at high voltages and due to this
 Traction mechanisms are generally up to 3,000 volts

 But these motors are not able to give suitable characteristics at normal power frequency
 inkaa pravartan kam aavriti par adhik santoshprad hota he
 Therefore, normally, or 25 cyclic frequency is used for traction
 is kaaran inhen saamaanya sanbharanatantron se nahin sambharan kiya ja saktaa he
 Being a latent system, there is also a problem of phase balance at the sub-center

 This was also done in the later Vedic period through which the king ruled the village

 There was also a public fund of the village in which money came from fines, penalties etc

 In the Gupta period, the village was the smallest unit of governance, whose head was called "gramik"
 vah "panchmandal" athwa panchayat kii sahaayta se gram kaa shashan chalaata tha
 The "gram Vriddhas" were members of this panchayat

 There were eight such committees which were responsible for maintaining peace and security in addition to performing various functions of public interest
 ye nyaay sambandhi kaary bhi karti thim
 The village was completely autonomous and thus the central government was free from many responsibilities
 muslim or maratha kaalon main bhi kisi na kisi prakaar kii panchayat vyavastha chalati rahi or prayek gram apane main swaavlambee bana rahaa
 During the British rule, the panchayat system got the biggest shock and this system became disjointed
 phir bhi graamon ke saamaajik jivan main panchayatein bani raheen
 Each caste or class had its own separate panchayats which governed its social life and those who violated the system and rules of the panchayat were severely punished
 shashan kii ore se in panchayaton ke kaaryon main hastkshep nahin kiya jaataa tha
 From the beginning, the policy of the British was that the work of governance should, as much as possible, remain in the hands of as many state employees
 iske parinamswaroop faujadaari or divaani adaalaton kii sthapana, naveen rajasav niti, police vyavastha, gamnaagaman ke sadhano kaa vikaas aadi kaarnon se graamon kaa swaavlambee jivan or sthaneey swaittata dhire-dhire samaapt ho chali
 But later on the British also realized that due to their policy of centralization, the governance burden is increasing day by day
 duusari ore rashtriya jagrati ke kaaran swaittashasan kii maang bhi bad rahi thi
 Hence they were forced to take steps towards decentralization
 prarambh main jila bordon or municipal bordon kii sthapana kii gai
 The Royal Commission on Decentralization of 1907 acknowledged the importance of panchayats and wrote in its report that the foundation of any permanent organization, so that the active cooperation of the public with the administration should be in the villages
 kamishan ne sifarish kii ki kuch chune hue graamon main, jo parsparik dalbandi or jhagadon se mukt hon, panchayatein sthapit kii jaaen or prarambh main unhen simit adhikaar die jaaen
 In 1915, the then Government of India accepted the recommendations of the commission in principle, but in practice they were completely ignored
 bahut hi kam graamon main panchayatein bani; jo baniin, ve bhi sarkaar dwaara puri tarah niyantrit thi
 According to the Government of India Act in 1919, the provincial governments were given certain powers of self-government and around 1920 the Gram Panchayat Acts were enacted in all the provinces
 sanyukt pradesh main 1920 ke panchayat act ke adheen lagbhag 4700 gram panchayatein sthapit kii gayi
 Panchayats were given limited powers in all the provinces

 He also had some judicial rights

 Their main means of income were fines or donations

 On the other hand, the masters of the national movement felt that the economic and moral decline of the villages could be prevented only by the re-establishment of the panchayats
 gandhi ji ke graamon ke liye dassutri kaarykram main panchayaton ko sudrudh banane kii baat mukhya thi
 They wanted to make panchayats the cornerstone of independent India's governance
 1937 main saat praanton main sthapit congressi sarkaron ke saamne bhi yahi adarsh tha
 In Uttar Pradesh, jeevansudhar Samitis were formed in many villages which were entrusted with the task of village development

 tak graamon main sahi panchayat vyavastha kaa abhaav hi rahaa
 Active efforts to revive this system started after independence
 uttar pradesh main san 1947 main panchayat raaj adhinium banaaya gaya
 Under the Constitution, the "directive Elements of Politics" stated that the state's principal duty was "to lead the organization of Gram Panchayats" and "to give them such powers and powers as to enable them to function as units of autonomous governance"

 The term "micro-computer" has become popular in common use since the introduction of mini-computers, although Isaac Asimov used the term "micro-computer" in 1956 in his short story "the Dying Night"

 Most early models such as the Altair 8800 were often sold as kits that were collected by the user and came in at least 256 bytes of RAM, plus any input / other than indicator lights and switches
 There was no output device; It was useful as a proof to demonstrate the concept of what such a simple device can do

 shaikshik praudyogiki uchit takneekee prakriyaaon or sansadhano ke srijan, upyog tathaa prabandhan ke dwaara adhigam or kaary pradarshan sudhaar ke adhyayan or naitik abhyaas ko kehete hai
 Instructional theory and learning theory are often associated with and included with the term educational technology
 jabaki anudeshi praudyogiki main adhigam evam anudesh kii prakriyaayein tathaa pranaliyaan shaamil hai, shaikshik praudyogiki main maanviya kshamtaaon ke vikaas hetu prayukt anya pranaliyaan shaamil hoti hai
 Educational technology incorporates, but does not include, software, hardware and Internet applications and activities
 lekin in shabdon ke arth ko lekar ab bhi bahes hoti he
 Educational technology can be most simply and easily defined as an array of tools that can be helpful in the learning process of the learner
 Educational technology relies on a broad definition of the term "technology"
 praudyogiki, maanav upyog kii bhautik samagriyon jaise mashiinon yaa hardware ke rup main sanderbhit kii ja sakati he, lekin isamen pranaliyaan, sanghatham kii vidhiyaan tathaa takanic jaise vyapak vishay bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some modern equipment is included but is not limited to only overhead projectors, laptops, computers, and calculators
 "smartphone" or game jaise nae upkaran gambhirtha se apni abhigyaan kshamta kii vajah se kaaphi dhyaan aakarshith karne lage hai
 Those who use educational technology for conceptual discovery and communication are either learners or teachers
 maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki hastpustika par vichaar karen
 Technology means "applied science" for the disciplinary areas, academic and human performance technology
 " duusare shabdon main, vaigyanik paddati ke upyog ke dwaara moulik shodh se vyutpann koi bhi prakriya yaa prakriyaayein praudyogiki maani ja sakati hai
 Educational or human performance technology may be based purely on algorithmic or experiential processes, but neither of the two necessarily implies physical technology
 praudyogiki shabd unani shabd “techne” se bana he jiskaa arth he shilp yaa kala
 ek anya shabd "takanic" bhi usee mul se aayaa he, jiskaa upyog shaikshik praudyogiki par vichaar karte samay kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore educational technology can be expanded to include teacher techniques
 1956 kii bloom kii pustak, texonomi of ajukational ovujactivj shaikshik manovigyaan ke paath kaa ek uttam udhaaharan he
 Bloom's taxonomies, when designing learning activities, can be useful to keep in mind what the learning goals of the learners are and what is expected of them
 baharhaal, bloom kaa kaary spasht rup se swatah hi shaikshik praudyogiki se sambhddha nahin hota or shaikshanik ranneetiyon se adhik sambandhit he
 According to some, an educational technologist is one who transforms basic academic and psychological research into evidence-based applied science for learning or instruction
 shaikshik praudyogvigyon ke paas praayah shaikshik manovigyaan, shaikshik media, prayogtmak manovigyaan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan yaa adhik vishuddh rup main, shaikshik, anudeshaatmak yaa maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki yaa anudeshaatmak abhiklpana ke kshetron main snaatak oopaadhi hoti he
 But some of the theorists listed below always used the term "educational technologist" to describe themselves, preferring a term like "teacher"

 Advocating a proficient approach to learning based on the classification of his intellectual practices, Bloom supported instructional techniques that changed both instruction and timing as needed by the learner
 1970 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak tak in diginon par aadhaarit model aam taur par computer aadhaarit prashikshan ), computer sahaytayukta anudesh yaa computer kii sahaayta se anudesh kehalaate the
 In a more simplified form, they were like today's "e-content", often the main part of "e-set up", sometimes referred to as web-based training or e-instruction
 paathyakram abhikalpak adhigam saamagree ke, graphics or multimedia prastuti ke saath sanvardhit chote-chote paath-khand banaate hai
 Multiple choice questions are added continuously with immediate feedback for self-evaluation and guidance
 aisi i-saamagree iemes, adiel / scorm or iiqui dwaara paribhaashit maanakon par bharosa karti he
 The decades of the 1980s and 1990s gave a wide variety of institutions that could be placed under the umbrella of a label computer-based education
 aksar rachnawadi or sangyaanavaadee adhigam siddhanton par aadhaarit, in pariveshon ne amoort evam prakshetra-vishisht samasya samaadhaan shikshan par jor diya
 Preferred technologies were the microcosm, simulation and hypertext
 shiksha ke kshetra main digital sanchaar or netwarking 80 ke dashak ke madhya main shuru hue or 90 ke dashak ke madhya main, visheshkar vishwavyaapee web, email tathaa manchon ke madhyam se lokapriy hue
 online adhigam ke do pramukh praroopon main antar he
 Computer-based training or computer-based learning, both of these earlier types emphasized student and computer practice and training on the one hand and student and micro-world and simulation on the other
 aaj, computer ke madhyam se sanchaar niyamit vidhyalay pranali main prachlit roopavali he, jahaan chaatr evam anudeshkon ke bich parsparik kriya kaa praathmik praaroop computer ke madhyam se he
 CBT / CBL usually means personalized learning, while CMC includes teacher / private teacher facility and requires a flexible assessment of learning activities
 iske alaava, aadhunik isiti upkarnon ke saath, adhigam samoohon or sambhddha gyaan prabandhan kaary ko banaae rakhane ke liye shiksha pradaan karata he
 It also provides tools for student and course management
 adhigam praudyogikiyaan kaksha sanvardhan ke alaava, purnakalik duurastha shikshan main bhi pramukh bhoomika nibhaati hai
 While most quality offerings rely on paper, video and occasional CBT / CBL content, the use of e-learning has increased through forums, instant messaging, video conferencing and more
 chote samoohon ko lakshyit paathyakram aksar mishrit yaa sankar abhiklpana jisamen vartmaan paathyakram mishrit hota he, kaa duurastha gatividhiyon ke saath upyog karte hai or vibhinn shaikshanik shaileyon kaa upyog karte hai
 The emergence of multiple mobile and ubiquitous technologies in the 2000s gave a new impetus to spatial learning, adapted to learning-for-reference scenarios
 kuch sahitya skool evam pramanik vyavastha donon ko ekikrut karne vaale mishrit adhigam paridrishyon kaa varnan karne ke liye ekikrut adhigam avadharana kaa upyog karte hai
 Three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks have been present in the educational technology literature
 ye hai vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad or rachnawad, teenon vaicharik skulon main se prayek aaj ke sahitya main upasthit he, lekin inkaa vikaas usee prakaar hua he jis prakaar manevigyaan sahitya kaa hua he
 Evolution of this theoretical structure Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, Edward C
 Tolman, Clark L
 Hull, B
C
 F
 Skinner and many others date back to the 20th century with animal learning experiments
 kai manovaigyanikon ne in siddhanton kaa maanav adhigam ke saath varnan or prayog karne ke liye istemaal kiya
 While it is still very useful, this learning philosophy has lost the support of many teachers

 ogaden lindsle ne bhi isi prakaar vyavhaar vishleshan par aadhaarit seleration adhigam pranali viksit kii thi lekin vah keller or skinner ke model se bilkul alag thi
 Cognitive science has changed teachers' attitudes towards learning
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main sangyanatmak kranti kii shuruyaat ke bahut prarambh se adhigam siddhant main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he
 The empirical framework of behaviorism was mostly retained even though a new paradigm had been introduced
 sangyanatmak siddhant mastishk aadhaarit adhigam ko samajhane ke liye vyavhaar se pare dekhte hai
 Cognitionists consider how human memory works to promote learning
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan main atkinson-shifrine ke smriti model tathaa badele ke kaaryakari smriti model jaise smriti siddhant ke saidhantik dhaanche ke rup main sthapit ho jane ke baad, 1970, 1980, 1990 ke dashakon main adhigam kaa nayaa sangyanatmak dhaancha ubharne laga tha
 It is important to note that computer science and information technology have had a major impact on the theory of cognitive science
 computer science ke kshetra main anusandhan or praudyogiki dwaara kaaryakari smriti or deergh avadhi smriti kii sangyanatmak avadharanaon ko sugam bana diya gaya
 Another major influence on the field of cognitive science is that of Noam Chomsky
 aaj shodhakarta sangyanatmak bhaar tathaa soochna sansaadhan siddhant jaise vishyon par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 Constructivism is a learning principle or educational philosophy that many teachers started considering in the 1990s
 is darshan ke praathmik siddhanton main se ek he ki shikshaarthi nai jaankaree se apane swayan ke arthon kii rachana karte hai, jab ve vaastaviktaa yaa bhinn drushtikon vaale anya logon ke saath parsparik kriya karte hai
 a constructive learning environment requires that students use their prior knowledge and experiences to develop new, relevant and / or adaptive learning concepts
 Under this framework, the teacher's role becomes that of a guiding facilitator, so that the learners can construct their own knowledge
 Constructive teachers should make sure that prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught
 jonasen kaa suzav he "acchhee tarah se sanrachit" adhigam vaataavaran nausikhia shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hota he or "biimaar sanrachit" vaataavaran keval adhik unnat shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Teachers using technology, while teaching from a constructivist perspective, should choose technology that reinforces prior knowledge in problem solving environments
 sangyojanavaad "digital yug ke liye ek adhigam siddhant" he, jise jorge cemens tathaa steven downess dwaara apane vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad tathaa rachnawad ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par, yah samajhane ke liye ki ham kaise jite hai, ham kaise samvaad karte hai or ham kaise sikhte hai, is par praudyogiki kaa kya prabhaav hua tha, viksit kiya gaya tha
 Executive Editor of the International Journal of Teaching Technology and Distance Education, Donald G
 Perrin states that the theory "combines the relevant elements of multiple learning theories, social structure and technology to compose a powerful theoretical concept for learning in the digital age" 
 " Problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning are active learning educational technologies that are used to facilitate learning
 vah praudyogiki jisamen bhautik evam prakriya prayukt vigyaan shaamil hai, ko is pariyojna, samasya, poochtacha-aadhaarit adhigam ke saath sammilit kiya ja saktaa he kyonki in sab main ek samaan shaikshik darshan he
 All three are student-centered, ideally these include real-world scenarios in which students are actively involved in critical thinking activities
 vah prakriya ek praudyogiki maani jaati he, jise apnaane ke liye chaatr protsaahit hote hai
 Bloom's taxonomies and instructional design are excellent examples of technology used by teachers and educational technologies

 Some of the claimed benefits are listed below: haalanki kaksha main praudyogiki ke kai laabh he, vahaan spasht kamiyaan bhi hai
 Lack of proper training, limited access to a sufficient amount of technology and the need for additional time for multiple implementations of technology are some of the reasons why technology is often not used extensively in the classroom
 ek nayaa kaary yaa vyapaar seekhney ke samaan, kaksha praudyogiki kaa prabhavi ekikaran sunishchit karne ke liye vishesh prashikshan mahatvapurn he
 Since technology is not the ultimate goal of education, but a means by which it can be achieved, teachers should have a better grasp of the technology used and its benefits than more traditional methods
 yadi in donon main kshetron main se kisi ek main bhi kami he, to praudyogiki shikshan ke lakshyon ke liye ek laabh na ho kar baadha ke rup main dekhi jaaegi
 Another difficulty is introduced when access to a sufficient amount of a resource is limited
 yah aksar dekha gaya he ki computer kii maatra yaa kaksha ke upyog ke liye digital camaron kii sankhya ek puri kaksha kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hoti he
 In some less informed forms, there is also limited access to technology research due to high cost of technology and fear of degradation
 anya maamalon main, laptop ke madhyam se ek kaksha main hi computer pahunch kii suvidha hone ke bajaay ek kaksha ko parivahan dwaara computer prayogshaala main le jane jaisi sansaadhan sthaapan kii asuvidha ek baadha he
 Technology implementation may also take time
 kuch praudyogikiyon ke prayog main ek praarambhik seoup yaa prashikshan samay laagat nihit ho sakati he
 Even after the completion of these tasks, in the event of a failure of the technology during the activity, the teachers must have an alternative lesson ready as a result

 Whenever the technology platform changes, new resources are to be designed and distributed

 Sugriva is a major character in the Ramayana
 vah wali kaa anuj he
 Hanuman befriended Rama
 valmiki ramayana main kiskindhakand, sundarkand tathaa yukand main sugriv kaa varnan vanararaj ke rup main kiya gaya he
 When he befriended Rama, he was living with Hanuman and some other loyal bears and monkey generals on the Rishimuk mountain in fear of his forefather
 lanka par chadhaai ke liye sugriv ne hi vanar tathaa riksh sena kaa prabandh kiya tha
 Dundubhi's elder brother Mayavi had a great old enmity with a woman
 mayavi ek raat kiskindha aayaa or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 After accepting the challenge, Vali ran after that asura
 saath main sugriv bhi uske saath tha
 Running away due to fear, the elusive one entered a tomb below the ground
 wali bhi uske peeche-peeche gaya
 Before leaving, he ordered Sugriva to guard Sugriva by standing at the mouth of the tomb until he came back after slaying Mayavi
 ek varsh se adhik interval ke pashchaat kandara ke muhane se rakt bahata hua baahar aayaa
 Sugriva listened to the asura of the demon, but not the brother
 yah samajhakar ki uskaa agraj ran main maaraa gaya, sugriv ne us kandara ke munh ko ek shila se band kar diya or waapas kiskindha aa gaya jahaan usne yah samachar sabko sunaaya
 The ministers, after consulting him, crowned Sugriva
 kuch samay pashchaat wali prakat hua or apane anuj ko raja dekh bahut kupit hua
 Sugriva tried his best to convince him, but Vali did not listen to him and grabbed Sugriva's kingdom and wife Ruma and expelled him
 dar ke kaaran sugriv ne rishyamook parvat main sharan lee jahaan shaap ke kaaran wali nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is where Sugriva met Rama due to Hanuman
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Eventually Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 hataash sugriv phir se kiskindha ke dwaar kii ore wali ko lalkaarane ke liye chal padaa
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajkumaar ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhaayegaa
 The duel started again between the two brothers, but this time Rama did not make any mistake in recognizing the two brothers and he fired an arrow with a tree
 baan ne wali ke hriday ko bedh daalaa or vah dharashaayi hokar zamin par gir gaya
 After Vali's slaughter, Tara thought it appropriate to accept Sugriva as the lord because he had to protect Angad's interests as well
 jab sugriv rajollas main tallin ho gaya or ram ko sita kaa dhundne kaa vachan bhul gaya to ram ne lakshmana ko use apana vachan yaad karaane ko bheja
 Laxman was quite angry anyway
 unhone kiskindha kii rajdhani pampapur main lagbhag akraman bol diya
 Sugriva realized his mistake but did not dare to face Laxman
 usne tara se aagrah kiya ki vah lakshmana ko shant kar de
 Madonmutt came out of Tara Ranivas and calmed Lakshmana
 usne maharishi vishwamitra kaa udhaaharan diya ki aise mahatma bhi indriya vishyak bhogon ke aage laachaar ho gayi the phir sugriv kii to bisaat hi kya or yah bhi ki vah manushya nahin varan ek vanar he
 Tara also described that Sugriva sent messengers to gather forces in all four directions
 valmiki ramayana tathaa anya bhashaaon ke roopantaranon main yah ullekh he ki adhkhule nayanon vaali madonmatta tara ke tarkon ko sunakar lakshmana thodi shant ho gayi or uske pashchaat sugriv ke aagaman or usase sita ko khojane kaa aashwaasan paakar waapas chale gayi
 Some regional adaptations of the Ramayana also show that at the time when Lakshman raged in the palace of the palace of the capital of Kishkindha, his first wife, Ruma, who was drinking with Sugriva, was not Tara and Bhoga Vilas
 He was engrossed in both
 yahan par yah yaad dilaanaa uchit hoga ki ram se maitri karte samay sugriv ne apane rajya ke chhin jane se bhi adhik wali dwaara apni patni rumaa ke chhin jane kaa khed prakat kiya tha
 In some versions Sugriva himself comes in front of Laxman and not Tara to calm Laxman and assures him that he has started gathering army
 sugriv se yah aashwaasan paakar lakshmana thodaa shant ho jate hai
 During the war of Lanka, Sugriva had challenged Kumbhakarna and almost killed his death
 kumbhkarna ko yuddh main vanar sena kaa naash karte dekh sugriv ne ek saal kaa vriksh ukhadkar kumbhkarna par akraman bol diya
 But that tree collided with Kumbhakarna's head and broke
 kumbhkarna ne phir sugriv ko pakadakar ghasita or use maar hi daalata lekin lakshmana ne ain vakt par aakar sugriv ko bachaa liya

 Its main weakness was as a shared unidirectional bus
 iske alaava netbarst architekchar kisi bhi purv intel yaa eemdi microarchitekchar kii tulana main kahin adhik taap utsarjit karata tha
 As a result, the introduction of the Pentium 4 received mixed reviews: developers disliked the Pentium 4 as it took the form of a new set of code optimization rules

 In response to these unexpected hurdles, Intel tried to recreate several new core designs and developed new manufacturing technologies, such as using multiple cores, increasing FSB speeds, increasing cache size, and lower clock speeds

 Multimedia encoding and some computer games benefited the most from the extreme version of Pentium 4 and even Athlon 64's overtaking two variants, although Athlon 64's lower price and balanced performance led to a much better value proposition
 Being seen as phir bhi charam sanskaran ne intel ke spasht lakshya ko hasil kar liya, jo ki athlon64 ko maujuuda paintium4 se har pramukh maandand par behatar sabit hone se rokna tha, anyathaa usne aisa kar diya hota

 Intel also released a series of Prescott pro Intel 64s that were Intel's implementation of the expansion from x86-64 64-bit to x86 architecture
 inhen multah epa-siries ke rup main jari kiya gaya tha or keval oiem ko bechaa gaya tha lekin baad main inkaa nayaa naam 5x1 siries diya gaya or inhen aam janata ko bechaa gaya
 In order to intensify some processors using multithreaded software such as video editing, the model numbers 506 and 516
 Two low-ends based on the 5x5 / 5x9 series by incorporating hyper-threading with Prescott of the 5x0, 5x0j and 5x1 series
 Intel64-active Prescott was also released
 5x1 shrinkhalaa 64 bit computing kaa bhi samarthan karti he
 Prescott was ultimately the overall final code name inside the netburst microarchitecture
 iske uttaradhikari paintium em ne vistrut sipiu microarchitekchar kii ore rujhaan dikhaaya or isamen kshamta ko ghataane evam kaarykushalta ko badhaane ke liye dhime clock speed ko unke process rodmap ke saath sanrekhit kiya gaya
 The low-level Israeli design team that made up the Pentium m core took responsibility for this next microarchitecture iteration
 paintium em ko paintium 4 or paintium 4-em kii kaarykushalta or taap utpaadan sambandhi muddon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye pesh kiya gaya tha
 Although it was clocked at a much lower speed than the Mobile Pentium 4, it was significantly faster clock-by-clock
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek 1
6 gigahertz paintium em kii kaarykushalta ek 2
4 gigahertz mobile paintium 4 ke lagbhag baraabar thi
 Although it was intended to be used only in laptops, some manufacturers manufactured desktop motherboards using Pentium M-supported sockets
 xxrep 4 = prescot 2em xxrep 4 = 2005 kii pehali timahi tak intel ne 6x0 kramakan, kodenam "prescot 2em " ke saath ek nae prescot kor ko jari kar diya tha
 Prescott 2M is also sometimes referred to as "irwindale" originating from its geon
 isamen intel 64, eksdi bit, iaiasti, tiem2 or 2 embi el2 cash kii visheshtaayen maujuud hai
 However, any superiority added by the additional cache was mostly ruled out due to the high cache latency and double-sized words when used on Intel 64 mode
 gati main ek lakshith tivrata dene kii bajaay dugune aakaar ke cash ko utani hi jagah dene or isiliye 64-bit mod opareshnon ke liye kaarykushalta pradaan karne ke iraade se taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The Prescott 2M of the 6xx series included some processes using multithreaded software such as hyper-threading in order to intensify video editing
 14 navambar 2005 ko intel ne vity kii sakriyata ke saath prescot 2em processron ko jari kiya
 Intel released only two models in this Prescott 2M category: the 662 and 672 which run at 3
6 ghz and 3
8 ghz respectively
 paintium 4 kaa antim sanshodhan seader mil tha jise 5 janvari 2006 ko jari kiya gaya
 In general, this was a direct die-shrink of a Prescott-based 600 series core at 65 nm with no real characteristics added
 seader mil main 86 wat kii tidipi ke saath prescot kii tulana main kam taap paidaa hota tha
 At the end of 2006, the D0's core stepping reduced it to 65 watts
 isamen ek 65 enem kor maujuud he or 31-charan vaali pipeline, 800 megahertz ennesabi, intel 64, hyper-threading or vartualizeshan takanic isaki vishistataaen hai
 Like the Prescott 2M, the Cedar Mill also has 2 MB L2 cache
 ise 3 gigahertz se 3

 kisi bhi 6x1 shrenee ko vartualizeshan takanic kaa samarthan praapt nahin tha
 As of March 2007 it has not been possible to acquire the 6x3 nor is there any data for this product range on Intel's website
 seader mil koron ko inhi ke samaan khaasiyat vaale prescot koron se alag karne ke liye intel ne unke model number main 1 jod diya
 Thus Pentium 4, 631, 641, 651 and 661 are 65 mm processors while Pentium 630, 640, 650 and 660 are their 90 nm counterparts respectively
 "seader mil" naam oregon ke seader mil se sambandhit he jo ki oregon ke hilsboro main sthit intel ke centre ke nikat ek pados kaa sthaan he
 The original successor to the Pentium 4 was Tejas, scheduled for early-mid-2005 release
 haalanki ise prescot ko jari kiye jane ke baad kuch maheenon ke liye radd karnaa padaa, jisaki vajah thi atyant oonchi tidipi or dual kor paintium di or paintium charam sanskaran or seader mil aadhaarit paintium 4achti ke apwaad ke alawa netbarst microarchitekchar par vikaas ko puri tarah chhod diya gaya
 Since May 2005, Intel has released dual-core processors based on Pentium 4 as Pentium d and Pentium Extreme Edition
 ve intel ke samanantaravaad kii ore jhukaav kaa pratinidhitva karte hai or unki manshaa antat apane processron kii shrinkhalaa ke adhikansh utpaada ko multiple-kor bananaa he
 These came under the code names Smithfield and Pressler for the 90 nm and 65 nm parts, respectively
 paintium 4 ke param uttaradhikari intel kor 2 procesar hai jo 27 july 2006 ko jari kor microarchitekchar par aadhaarit "conro" kor kaa prayog karte hai
 Intel Core 2 processors have been released as single, dual and quad core processors
 intel kor 2 shrankhla main single kor ke samakaksh mukhya rup se oiem bazaaron ke liye maujuud hai, jabaki dual or quad kor procesar khudara vikreta or oiem donon ko beche ja sakate hai

 It is located in the western part of Viti Levu Island and 24 kilometers south of Lautoka
 prashasnic rup se yah fiji ke pashchimi vibhaag ke ba praant kaa bhaag he
 Lautoka has a large population of people of Indian origin and is a major center of Hindu and Islam religions in Fiji
 vishwa ke dakshini golardh kaa sabase bada hindu mandir, shri shiv subrahmanya mandir, nandi main hi sthit he
 The Fijian language is written in Roman script, but the consonant of the "d" consonant is pronounced "nad" rather than "the" as in English

 For many years after the non-cooperation movement ended, Mahatma Gandhi kept himself focused on social reforms
 1928 main unhone pun:raajnneeti main pravesh karne kii sochi
 In that year, an all-india campaign was being carried out against the Simon Commission, which was sent from England to investigate the conditions of the colonies, with all white members
 gandhi ji ne swayan is andolan main bhaag nahin liya tha par unhone is andolan ko apana aashirwad diya tha tathaa isi varsh bardoli main hone vaale ek kisaan satyagrah ke saath bhi unhone aisa kiya tha
 In the end of December 1929, the Congress held its annual session in the city of Lahore
 yah adhiveshan do drushtiyon se mahatvapurn tha : jawaharlal nehru kaa adhyaksh ke rup main chunaav jo yuva peedi ko netritv kii chadi saunpane kaa pratik tha or ‘purna swaraj’ athwa purna swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa
 Now the pace of politics had increased once again
 26 JAN 1930 ko vibhinn sthanon par rashtriya dhvaj faharaakar or deshbhakti ke geet gaakar ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaaya gaya
 Gandhiji himself gave clear instructions as to how this day should be celebrated
 unhone kaha ki yadi ;swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa sabhi gaanvon or sabhi shaharon yahan tak ki— acha hoga
 It would be nice if all the places have seminars at the same time
 gandhi ji ne suzav diya ki nagaade petakar paaramparik tirake se sangoshtee ke samay kii ghoshnaa kii jaae
 The celebrations will begin with the hoisting of the national flag
 din kaa baaki hissaa kisi rachanaatmak kaary main chaahe vah soot katai ho athwa ‘achhuton’ kii seva athwa hinduon va musalamaanon kaa punarmilan athwa nishiddh kaary athwa ye sabhi ek saath karne main vyateet hoga or yah asambhav nahin he
 Those participating in it will take a firm pledge that the Indian people, like others, have the inalienable right to enjoy the freedom and fruits of their hard work and that if any government deprives the people of these rights or suppresses them If it does, then people also have the right to change or eliminate it
 ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaae jane ke turant baad mahatma gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve british bharat ke sarvaadhik ghrunit kanoonon main se ek, jisane namak ke utpaadan or vikray par rajya ko ekadhikaar de diya he, ko todane ke liye ek yatra kaa netritv karenge
 The issue of salt monopoly which he had selected was another example of Gandhi's skillful prudence
 prayek bhartiya ghar main namak kaa prayog aprihaary tha lekin iske baavjood unhen gharelu prayog ke liye bhi namak banane se roka gaya or is tarah unhen dukaanon se unche daam par namak kharidne ke liye baadhya kiya gaya
 State's monopoly on salt was quite unpopular
 isi ko nishaanaa banaate hue gandhi ji angreji shashan ke khilaaf vyapak asantosh ko sangathitakarne kii soch rahe the
 Most of the Indians understood the importance of this challenge of Gandhiji but not the British Raj
 haalaanki gandhi ji ne apni ‘namak yatra’ kii purv soochna visarai lard ervin ko de di thi kintu ervin unki is kaarywahi ke mahatv ko na samaj sake
 On 12 March 1930, Gandhiji started walking towards the sea from his ashram in Sabarmati
 teen hafton baad ve apane gantavy sthaan par pahunche
 There he made himself a criminal in the eyes of the law by making a handful of salt
 isi bich desh ke anya bhaagon main samaantar namak yatraayen ayojit kii gai
 Apart from the officially sanctioned national campaign like the Non-cooperation movement, there were numerous streams of protest
 desh ke vishaal bhaag main kisaanon ne damankaaree aupniveshik van kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya jiske kaaran ve or unke maveshi unheen jangalon main nahin ja sakate the jahaan ek jamaane main ve berokatoke ghoomte the
 In some towns, factory workers went on strike, lawyers boycotted British courts and students refused to study in government educational institutions
 1920-22 kii tarah is baar bhi gandhi ji ke aahvaan ne tamaam bhartiya virgon ko aupniveshik shashan ke viruddh apana asantosh vyakt karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In response, the government started arresting dissidents
 namak satyagrah ke silsile main lagbhag 60,000 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Gandhiji was also among those who were arrested
 samudr tat kii ore gandhi ji kii yatra kii pragati kaa pataa unki gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye tainaat police afasaron dwaara bheji gai gopneey repot se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In these reports, Gandhiji's speeches are also given in the villages of the road in which he called upon the local authorities to leave government jobs and join the freedom struggle
 vasana naamak gaanv main gandhi ji ne unchi jati waalon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki yadi aap swaraj ke haq main aawaaj uthaate hai to aapako achhuton kii seva kerani padegi
 You will not get swaraj only by the abolition of salt tax or other taxes
 swaraj ke liye aapako apni un galtiyon kaa praayshchit karnaa hoga jo aapane achhuton ke saath kii hai
 For Swaraj, all Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Sikhs will have to unite
 ye swaraj kii seedhiyaan hai
 Fpulis' spies wrote in their report that women and men of all castes are attending Gandhiji's meetings
 unka kahana tha ki hajaaron walantier rashtravaadi uddeshy ke liye saamne aa rahe hai
 Many of them were government officials who resigned their posts in colonial rule
 sarkaar ko bheji apni report main jila police suparintendent ;police adheekshak ne likhaa tha ki fshri gandhi shant or nishcint dikhaai die
 As they are advancing, their strength is increasing
 namak yatra kii pragati ko ek or baat se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 American news magazine Time used to laugh at Gandhiji's stature
 patrika ne unke takue jaise shariray or makadi jaise pairo kaa khub majaak udaaya tha
