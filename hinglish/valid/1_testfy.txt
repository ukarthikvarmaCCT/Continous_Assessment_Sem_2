aryabhat ke kaary ke pratyaksh vivaran sirf aryabhatiy se hi gyaat hai
 The name Aryabhatiya is given by later commentators, Aryabhata himself would not have named it; This is mentioned by his disciple Bhaskara i in the articles of Ashmakatantra or Ashmaka
 ise kabhi kabhi arya-shat-asht - jo kii unke paath main chhandon kii sankhya he- ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 This sutra is written in a very concise style similar to literature, where each line helps to recall a complex system
 is prakaar, arth kii vyakhya tippaneekaron kii vajah se he
 There are 108 verses in the entire book, as well as 13 introductory additions, the whole is divided into four verses or chapters: iske atirikt, kuch sanskarnon ant main kritiyon kii prashansa aadi karne ke liye kuch pushpikaayen bhi jodate hai
 Aryabhatiya introduced some innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries
 granth kii sankshiptata kii charam seemaa kaa varnan unke shishy bhaskar pratham dwaara apni samikshaon main kiya gaya he or apane aryabhatiy bhashya main nilkanth somyaji dwaara
 In the history of India, which is known as 'gupta period' or 'golden Age', at that time India made unprecedented progress in the fields of literature, art and science
 us samay magadh sthit nalanda vishvavidhyalay gyandaan kaa pramukh or prasiddh centre tha
 Students from foreign countries used to come here for learning
 vahaan khagolashastra ke adhyayan ke liye ek vishesh vibhaag tha
 According to an ancient verse Aryabhata was also the chancellor of Nalanda University
 aryabhat kaa bharat or vishwa ke jyotish siddhanth par bahut prabhaav rahaa he
 The most influence in India was on the astrological tradition of the state of Kerala
 aryabhat bhartiya ganitagyon main sabase mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 In 120 Aryachandas, he has written the principles of astrology and the mathematics related to it in his Aryabhatiya treatise
 unhone ek ore ganit main purvavarti archimedes se bhi adhik sahi tathaa sunishchit pai ke maan ko nirupit kiya to duusari ore khagolvigyaan main sabase pehali baar udhaaharan ke saath yah ghoshit kiya gaya ki swayan prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 This is the importance of what Aryabhata had discovered without the present day advanced means of astrology
 koparnicus ne jo khoj kii thi uski khoj aryabhat hajaar varsh pehle kar chuke the
 In "golapada", Aryabhata wrote "when a man in a boat moves with the flow, then he understands that the material trees, stones, mountains etc
 are going in reverse
 usee prakaar gatiman prithvi par se sthir nakshatra bhi ulti gati se jate hue dikhaai dete hai
 "thus Aryabhata first proved that the earth rotates on its axis
 inhone satyuga, treta, dwapar or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to them, 14 manvantars in one kalpa and 72 mahayugas in one manvantar and Satyuga, Dwapara, Treta and Kaliyug in one chaturyuga are considered equal
 aryabhat ke anusaar kisi vrutt kii paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh 62,832 : 20,000 aata he jo chaar dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh he
 Aryabhata has used a very scientific method of representing large numbers with a group of letters
 sthaan-mulya ank pranali, jise sarvapratham teesri sadi kii bakhshali pandulipi main dekha gaya, unke kaaryon main spasht rup se vidyaman thi
 He did not use the symbol, of course, but according to the French mathematician Georges Efrah — with zero coefficients, knowledge of zero as a place holder for the power of ten was contained in Aryabhata's place-value digit system
 haalanki, aryabhat ne brahmi ankon kaa prayog nahin kiya tha; vaidic kaal se chali aa rahi sanskrit parampara ko nirantar rakhte hue unhone sankhya ko nirupit karne ke liye varnmaala ke aksharon kaa upyog kiya,matraaon ko smarak ke rup main vyakt karnaa
 Aryabhata worked on Pai's approximation and may have come to know that Pai is irrational
 aryabhatium ke duusare bhaag main ve likhte hai: According to this, the ratio of diameter and circumference is × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five significant figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he
 If this is correct, then this is a very sophisticated approach, as the irrationality of pi in Europe was proved only by Lambert in 1761
 aryabhatiy ke arabi main anuwaad ke pashchaat bijganit par mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi kii pustak main is sanniktan kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In Mathematica 6, Aryabhata describes the area of a triangle as: iskaa anuwaad yah he : kisi tribhuj kaa kshetrafal, lamb ke saath bhujaa ke aadhe ke parinaam ke baraabar hota he
 Aryabhata has discussed the subject of duality in his work and named it Ardha-jya which literally means "ardha-tantra"
 aasaani kii vajah se logon ne ise jya kahana shuru kar diya
 When his work was translated from Sanskrit to Arabic by Arabic writers, he called it Jiba
 chunki, arabi lekhan main, swaron kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he, isliye iskaa or sankshipt naam pad gaya jb
 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 a problem of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic known today as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: That is, say n = 8x + 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 This leaves the smallest value 85 for N
 saamaanya taur par, diophentine sameekaran kathinata ke liye badnaam the
 Such equations are widely discussed in the ancient Vedic text Sulab Sutra, the more ancient parts of which date back to 800 BC
 Can be older
 aisi samasyaon ke hal ke liye aryabhat kii vidhi ko kuttak vidhi kaha gaya he
 kuṭṭaka kuttak means grinding, that is, breaking into small pieces and this method consisted of a recursive algorithm for writing the original segments as small numbers
 aaj yah kalanvidhi, 621 isvi pashchaat main bhaskar kii vyakhya ke anusaar, pehle kram ke diophentine samikarnon ko hal karne ke liye maanak paddati he,or ise aksar aryabhat elgoridm ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Diophantine equations are used in cryptology and the RSA Convention, 2006 focused on the Kuttaka method and earlier works of Sulvasutra
 aryabhatiy main aryabhat ne virgon or ghanon kii shrenee ke rochak parinaam pradaan kiye hai
 And aryabhat kii khagol vigyaan pranali audaayak pranali kehalaati thi, khagol vigyaan par unke baad ke lekh, jo satahi taur parek dwitiya model, prastaavit karte hai, kho gaye hai, parantu inhe aanshik rup se brahmagupta ke khandakhadyak main hui charchaaon se punah nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some texts, they attribute the rotation of the Earth to the virtual motion of the sky
 prathit hota he ki aryabhat yah maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree kii parikrama karti he
 This is known from a statement referencing Sri Lanka, which describes the motion of stars as the relative motion produced by the rotation of the Earth
 aglaa chand taron or grahon kii gati ko vaastavik gati ke rup main varnit karata he: Lanka here is a reference point on the equator, which was taken to be the same value in terms of the meridian for astronomical calculations
 aryabhat ne saura mandal ke ek bhukendriya model kaa varnan kiya he, jisame surya or chandramaa gruhachakra dwaara gati karte hai, jo ki parikrama karata heprithvi kii
 In this model, which is found in the Pitamahist theory, the motion of each of the planets is controlled by two planetary cycles, a small slow planetary cycle and a large early planetary cycle
 prithvi se duuri ke anusaar grahon kaa kram is prakaar he : chandramaa, budh, shukr, suraj, mangal,brihaspati, shani or nakshatra The position and duration of the planets were calculated as relative to points moving uniformly, in the case of Mercury and Venus, which revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the average Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn In the case of, which move around the Earth in the zodiac at their specific speed
 khagol vigyaan ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah dwi grahchakr vaala model tolemi ke pehle ke greek khagol vigyaanke tatwon ko pradarshit karata he
 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 unhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it
 is prakaar chandragahan tab hota he jab chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh karata he or prithvi kii is chaaya ke aakaar or vistaar kii vistaar se charchaa kii or phir grahan ke dauraan grahan vaale bhaag kaa aakaar or isaki gananaa
 Later Indian astronomers improved these calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the major gist
 yah gananaatmak misaal itani sateek thi ki 18 veen sadi ke vaigyanik guilom le jentil ne, pandicherry kii apni yatra ke dauraan, paaya ki bharatiyon kii gananaa ke anusaar 1765-08-30 ke chandragrahan kii avadhi 41 second kam thi, jabaki uske chart 68 second adhik darshaate the
 According to Aryabhata, the circumference of the Earth is 39,968
0582 kilometers, which is only 0
2% less than its actual value of 40,075
0167 kilometers
 yah sanniktan unani ganitagya, eratosthenas kii sanganana ke upar ek ullekhneey sudhaar tha,200 i
) jinaki gananaa kaa aadhunik ikaayiyon main to pataa nahin he, parantu unke anumaan main lagbhag 5-10% kii ek truti avashya thi
 If added to the modern English units of time, Aryabhata's calculation of the Earth's period of time) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4
091
 isi prakaar, unke hisaab se prithvi ke varsh kii avadhi 365 din 6 ghante 12 minute 30 second, aadhunik samay kii gananaa ke anusaar isamen 3 minute 20 second kii truti he
 The perception of the constellation of time was known in most other astronomical systems at that time, but this computation was probably the purest at that time
 aryabhat kaa daawa tha ki prithvi apni hi dhuree par gumti he or unke grah sambandhi grahchakr modelon ke kuch tatv usee gati se ghoomte hai jis gati se surya ke chaaron ore grah ghoomte hai
 Thus it is suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on the underlying Sun-centered model, in which planets orbit the Sun
 ek samiksha main is surya kendrit vyakhya kaa vistrut khandan he
 This review BL a book by Van der Varden describes "this book is unknown about Indian home doctrine and it directly contradicts every word of Aryabhata"
 However, some people accept that Aryabhata's system stems from an earlier Sun-centered model, which he did not know
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki ve grahon ke maarg ko andakaar maanate the, haalaanki iske liye koi bhi praathmik sakshya prastut nahin kiya gaya he
 Although Aristarchus of Samos and sometimes Heraclides of Pontus are credited with knowledge of the Sun-centered theory, Greek astronomy known in ancient India makes no discussion of the Sun-centered theory
 bhartiya khagoleey parampara main aryabhat ke kaary kaa bada prabhaav tha or anuwaad ke madhyam se inhone kai padosi samskritiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Its Arabic translation was particularly influential during the Islamic Golden Age
 unke kuch parinaamon ko al-khwarijmi dwaara uddhrut kiya gaya he or 10 veen sadi ke arabi vidwaan al-biruni dwaara unhen sandarbhit kiya gaya gaya he, jinhone apane varnan main likhaa he ki aryabhat ke anuyaayi maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 His definitions of sine, cosine as well as versine, and inverse sine, influenced the origin of trigonometry
 ve pehle vyakti bhi the jinhone sin or varsin talikaon ko, 0 degree se 90 degree tak 3
75 ° antaraalon main, 4 dashamalav sthanon kii sookshmata tak nirmit kiya
 In fact the modern names of "sine" and "cosine" are the incorrect pronunciation of the words sine and cosine as practiced by Aryabhata
 unhen arabi main jiba or kojiba ke rup main uccharit kiya gaya tha
 He was then misinterpreted by Gerard of Cremona during the translation of an Arabic geometry text into Latin; He took the Arabic word 'pocket' for jiba which means "a seam in a dress", el sinus
 aryabhat kii khagoleey gananaa kii vidhiyaan bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee thi
 Along with trigonometric tables, they were widely used in the Islamic world
 or anek arabi khagoleey talikaon kii gananaa ke liye istemaal kii jaati thi
 In particular, the astronomical tables found in the works of the Arabic Spain scientist al-jharkali were translated into Latin as the tables of Toledo and have been in use for centuries as the most subtle almanac in Europe

 The Jalali Tithipatra estimates its dates on the basis of actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata
 This type of date sheet requires an almanac to calculate the dates
 yadhyapi tithiyon kii gananaa karnaa kathin tha, par jalaalee tithipatr main gregory tithipatr se kam mausami trutiyaan thi
 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was named after him
 chandra khadd aryabhat kaa naam unke sammaan swarup rakhaa gaya he
 An institute near Nainital in India has been named Aryabhata Observational Science Research Institute for research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences

 Bacillus Aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in 2009 by ISRO scientists, is named after him

 Arjun Rampal English: Arjun Rampal, is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films, as well as being a model
 unki pehali film - moksh 2001 main pradarshit hui, jise ashok mehta ne nirdeshit kiya gaya tha
 However, the film was released after his second film Pyaar, Ishq and Mohabbat, in which he starred alongside Sunil Shetty and Aftab Shivdasani

 a unique copy of this material is preserved in the Asiatic Society's collection
 granth ke shuruaati pannon main kai khamiyaan hai, haalanki baad ke pannon main adhikansh saamagree suvachy he
 Vibhuti Bhushan Bhattacharya of Saraswati Bhavan of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi edited this material, but unfortunately, he died

 What is there in this manuscript? Joseph writes - yah granth karika ke rup main likhaa gaya he or chah adhyyon main vibhajit he
 The first chapter gives a preface that highlights the purpose of writing this book
 doosraa adhyay ‘sankhyavidhan’ he jisamen vibhinn sankhyaon main maapan kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 It starts with 'yava'
 phir ‘anguli’, vitasti yaa baalist, hast danda jaise maapon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Then Kos and Yozan are mentioned
 iske baad vajan ke maapon kaa varnan he, khaskar chaaval ke vajan karne vaale maap
 The measurements used by the goldsmiths such as Gunja, Masha, Karsha and Pal are also mentioned
 samay kii maap ke bare main kaaphi ruukhe dhang se varnan kiya gaya he
 According to this, there are 30 Muhurats in a day, while a month is made from 30 days and 12 months to a year
 isamen kuch aisi maapen bhi di gai hai jo ab prachlan main nahin hai jaise varatka, gandak yaa gandic, kakini, pan, dallak ityadi
 Interestingly, Ghatiman, Dramkedar and Dinar are also mentioned

 The sixth chapter attempts to explain various rules through examples
 is granth main kai kamiyaan nikaali ja sakati hai
 Despite this, one has to say that this book is a glimpse of the study of mathematics practiced in North India thousands of years ago
 is pandulipi main vargamul kii gananaa ke liye nimnlikhit sutara kai baar aayaa he- Let be the square root of a number q { \ displaystyle { \ sqrt {Q}}} where q is not a perfect square
 yadi, a1, a2, a3 kramshah adhik shuddh vargamul hon to, ise teen charnon main nimna prakaar se kiya ja saktaa he- Ie mana 889 kaa vargamul nikaalnaa he
 When we first take a1 = 29, b = 48, 889 kaa vargamul lagbhag 29,8160303 he
 Hence the above result is pure up to 4 digits of decimal
 ab ham a1 = 30, b = -11 lekar dekh sakate hai ki adhik shuddh parinaam miltaa he- This result is pure up to 6 digits of decimal
 2017 main, is pandulipi se 3 namoonay lekar unka radiocarbon vishleshan kiya gaya
 The results from this are surprising in the sense that these three samples were composed in three different centuries - the first 224 AD - 383 AD, the second 680–779 AD, and the third 885–993 AD
 is prashn kaa uttar nahin mil paa rahaa he ki vibhinn shatabdiyon main rachit panne ek saath jode ja sake
 2895 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2895 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 The short circuit in an electrical circuit is one that allows the current to go through a path in which the impedance is zero or very low
 "khulaa circuit", laghu paripath kaa vaidyuthik vilom he jisamen vidyut paripath ke kinhi do binduon ke bich pratibaadha kaa maan anant hota he
 a short circuit is an unusually low resistive combination between two nodes in a power circuit that is determined for different voltages

 a short circuit may cause circuit damage or overheating, fire, or explosion
 aise maamle bhi hai jahaan short circuit jaanboojhkar utpann kiye jate hai, jaise, crobaar circuit protectors main
 In case of short circuit, the current flowing from the source jahaan: In circuit analysis, the term short circuit is used to refer to a zero-impedance combination between two nodes in terms of analogy
 yah dono nodes ko ek hi voltage main bane rahane par jor detaa he
 In an ideal short circuit, this means neither a resistance is created in the short circuit nor there is a drop in voltage
 saral paripath vishleshan main, taron ko shorts ke arth main liya jaataa he
 In real circuits, this results in a connection of approximately zero impedance and almost no resistance
 aise maamle main, roke gaye karrent ko baaki ke circuit ke jariye simit rakhaa jaataa he
 a common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery are connected to a conductor wire with very low resistance

 In electrical equipment, unwanted short circuits usually occur when the insulation of a wire is removed, or when another conductive material is used, which causes the electric charge to flow through a different path rather than flowing through its specified path
 Gets a chance to mukhya circuit main, do charnon ke bich, ek fez evam ek neutral ke bich athwa ek fez or arth ke bich laghu paripath ho sakate hai
 Such short circuits are more likely to result in very high current and therefore in such a situation, a large number of overflow protection devices are quickly activated

 a typical sign of electric arc damage is surface erosion
 yahaan tak ki chote arches bhi electrode se ullekhneey maatra main padaarthon ko baahar nikaal sakate hai
 Low-voltage power lines use non-insulated wires, as they rely on the transfer of their circulating spaces to provide the necessary insulation

 To reduce this problem, Australia has started using aerial bundled conductors, in which the three-phase wire is insulated with the ground wire and wrapped back together
 ab khatarnaak sparks utpann nahin ho sakati hai
 By using fuses, circuit breakers, or other overload protection that disconnects the power as a result of excessive current, short circuit damage can be reduced or prevented
