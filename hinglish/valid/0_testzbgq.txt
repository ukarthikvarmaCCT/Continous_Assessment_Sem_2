 british ekadhidaruk ko united kingdom samet kul 15 rashtramandal pradeshon, mukutiyaa nirbhartaaon or samudrapar pradeshon ke rajmukuton sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler is Queen Elizabeth II from 6 February 1952 when she succeeded the throne from her father George Sageham
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhi kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but due to centuries-old common law, sovereigns are obliged to exercise most of their powers only in accordance with the specifications of Parliament and Government
 is kaaran se, ise vaastavik taur par ek sansadeey samrajyata maani jaataa he
 Being a parliamentary ruler, most of the powers of the ruler are limited to impartial and non-political functions

 Around the year 1000, several small early medieval states had developed in the states of England and Scotland

 1922 main ireland kaa paanch-chhyai hissaa irish mukt rajya ke naam se, sangh se bahaar nikal gaya
 The Balfour Declaration, 1926, recognized the transformation of British Dominions from the colonial post into separate, self-governing, universal countries within the Commonwealth
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad british samrajya simatata gaya, or british samrajya ke adhiktar purv upnivesh va pradesh swatantra ho gaye
 Those countries which consider the former colony, the British ruler as their ruler, are called British Commonwealth divisions or Commonwealth territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is referred to as the British ruler, but in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 britain kii rajatantric vyavastha main, raja / rani ko rashtrapramukh kaa darj diya gaya he
 In the British political system, which has been progressively developing and changing over a period of thousands of years, the traditional and real powers of the ruler have been fluctuating
 british rajnatik sankalpana main, britain ke samprabhu ko rajmukut ke maanvi avatar ke rup main mana jaataa he, arthath ve sampoorn rajya va puri shasampranali ke samast shasnadhikaar ke antyant strot hai, or britain par shashan karne kaa adhikaar antytah british samprabhu ke paas hi he
 Therefore, all government officials and employees, including judges, mps and all ministers, are sovereign employers and providers of authority
 tathaa nishtha kii shapath maharani ke prati lee jaati he
 And it is mandatory to obtain royal assent to all the Parliamentary Acts to be legal
 tathaa united kingdom kaa raashtragan god seve da queen he
 Apart from this, the image of the ruler is inscribed on all postage stamps, coins and currency notes

 Therefore, most of the works done by the rulers in the name of Rajmukut, whether done by the ruler himself, such as the Queen's address or the state inauguration of Parliament, the decisions of Surrey work are taken elsewhere: vidhayik kaary maharani sasansaad dwaara, sansad, house of lords or house of comons kii salaah or sweekruti dwaara kiya jaataa he, vahin, kaaryakari shaktiya maharani ke naam par unki mahima kii sarkaar dwaara abhyayit kiye jate hai
 In which, the Prime Minister and other ministers of the Crown and the Council of Ministers are represented, which is, in effect, a committee of the Queen's Royal Council
 tathaa shaasha kii nyaay karne or dand dene kii shaktiyaan nyaaypalika par nihit kii gayin hai, jo sanvaidhanik taur par, sarkaar se swatantra he
 The Church of England, which is headed by the Queen, has its own administrative system
 iske alaava bhi shaasha ke anya kaaryon ko vibhinn samitiyon va nikaayon ko saunpe gaye hai
 When necessary, the superintendent has the responsibility to appoint a prime minister to head his government
 alikhit samvidhan kii aitihaasik parampara ke anusaar aam taur par pradhan mantri house of comons main bahumat praapt dal ke net hote hai
 The Prime Minister takes up his assignment after a personal meeting with the ruler, in which the appointment is passed immediately, without further formalities, with a tradition of "kissing hands"
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main, adhirat ke paar apane vivek ke upyog kar, apane icchaanusaar sarkaar ke pratinidhi kaa chunaav karne ke adhik avasar hota he, haalaanki aise sthiti main bhi reetinusaar sadan ke sabase bade dal ke netaa ko hi chunaa jaataa he
 From 1945 till date, only two such situations had occurred
 pehali baar faivari 1974 ke aam chunaav ke baad, or 2010 ke aam chunaav ke baad, jab conzarvative party or libral-democratic party ne gathbandhan banaaya tha
 Traditionally, the authority to convene and dissolve the session of Parliament was at the discretion of the ruler, and the ruler voluntarily called and dissolved the assembly
 atah dharnatmak rup se aaj bhi sansad bulaane va bhang karne ke adhikaar kaa abhyay shaasha hi karte hai
 The fixed-term Appropriations Act passed in 2011 put an end to the right to dissolve Parliament
 haalaanki satrantan karne kaa adhikaar shaasha ke paas abhi bhi he
 If a minority government demands dissolution of Parliament and declaration of new elections, the ruler is completely free to reject such demand
 dharnatmat rup se shaasha swechha se pradhanmantri ko kabhi bhi padochit kar sakate hai, parantu varttman sthiti main pradhanmantri ko stifa, mrityu yaa chunavi haar kii sthiti main hi pad se nishkashit kiya jaataa he
 The last ruler to expel the Prime Minister during his tenure was William IV, who evacuated Lord Melbourne in 1834
 samprabhu, sthapit carch of england ke sarvocch prashaasak hai
 All the bishops and archbishops of the church are appointed by the ruler, on the advice of the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri, carch ayog dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye pratyaashiyon kii ek suchi main se niyukta ko chunate hai
 Rajmukut plays a minor role in English Girja
 carch ke varishthatam padri, cantarbari ke archbishap, is carch tathaa vishwa bhar ke angalikai sampradaay ke aadhyatmik netaa ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 And the Adhirat also takes the oath of patronage of the Church of Scotland, and is also responsible for appointing the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church, otherwise, he has no meaningful role in Girja's work, nor does he have any authority over it 
 visthapit carch of wales tathaa carch of ireland main samprabhu kaa koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin he
 By the colonial expansion of Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, Britain occupied many other regions of the world
 jinamein se adhiktar deshon ne madhya 20veen sadi tak britain se swatantraaa hasil kar lee
 Although all those countries rejected the suzerainty of the government of the United Kingdom, many of them recognized the British ruler as their suzerainty
 aise dehon rashtramandal pradesh yaa rashtramandal prajabhumi kaha jaataa he
 At present, the United Kingdom is not only the United Kingdom, but in addition there are a total of 15 other nations
 haalanki in rashtron main bhi unhen lagbhag saamaan pad va adhikaar praapt he jaisaa kii britain main, parantu un deshon main, unka koi vaastavik raajnneetik yaa paaramparik karttavya nahin he, shaasha ke lagbhag saare karttavya unke pratnidhi ke rup main us desh ke maharajyapal puraa karte hai
 The Government of Britain has no role or interference in the work of the governments of the Commonwealth territories

 Formerly all the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations used to be part of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1950 India declared itself a republic after independence, and also abolished the sovereignty of the British monarchy as its head of state
 parantu bharat ne rashtramandal kii sadsyta barqaraar raakhi
 Since then, in Commonwealth countries, the British sovereign is also given the position of "head of the Commonwealth", which is the nominal head of the organization of the Commonwealth
 is pad kaa koi rajnatik arth nahin he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he, jinamein bill of ritis, 1689, act of setlement, 1701 or act of union, 1707 shaamil hai
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Regency Acts in 1937 and 1953, the emperor has not achieved 18 years of power, either physically or mentally incapacitated, to be carried out as regent
 ginni ke pati yaa patni,: viklaangata nimnlikhit vyaktiyon ke kam se kam teen kii pushti kerani hogi lord chancelar, house of comons ke spikar, bhagwaan ucch vakil, or scrol ke rakshak
 To complete the Regency, it also required a declaration of the same three persons

 Regent, is of British citizenship, and resident in Britain
 in niyamon ke anusaar, keval regent bhavishya tha jorge chaturth, jo rajya karata rahaa jab unke pita jorge III pagal ho gaya tha 
 However, the Regency Act in 1953 states that if the Regency is needed, the heir to the Queen, Prince Philip, Duke Regent of Edinburgh
 regency rani kii aavashyaktaa hogi, to regent board kii line main agle ho jayega 
 During temporary physical disability or absence from the state, the guineas could delegate their actions to the advisory state, spouse or at best four on the line of succession
 rajya kii aavashyaktaaon ke salaahkaar regent ke rup main vahi kar rahe hai
 Currently, councilors from five states: sansad, samprabhu ke adhikansh sarkari kharchon ke liye raashi sansadeey anudaan tathaa saarvajanik dhan dwaara pradaan karata he, jise "naagarik suchi" kehete hai
 And an annual grant is also allocated for maintenance of royal residences and official visits to the queen
 karmchaariyon kii laagat, rajya kaa daura, aupchaarik patibaddhtaon or aadhikarik manoranjan sahit zyaadaatar kharchon ke liye dhan kii poorti naagarik suchi dwaara hi ho jaati he
 This amount is set by Parliament for a term of 10 years
 varsh 1760 tak shaasha kii vittiya aavashyaktaayen, vanshanugat rajasav, mukutiy sampadaaon ke laabh, dwaara puri hoti thi
 In 1760, King George III agreed to abandon his hereditary Rajavan for the civil list, which lasted until 2012
 varttman samay main mukutiyaa esteton se ai mudra kii maatra civil list yaa adhirat ko pradaan kiye jane vaale anya anudaanon se bhi adhik he
 Thus between 2007-08 Crown Estates increased the treasury by £ 200 million, while 40 million pounds were paid by Parliament
 atah 7
3 arab pound kii sampada ke saath mukutiy sampadaayen britain ke sabase badi zameendaaron main se ek he, yah sari sampatti nyaas ke antargat raakhi gayi hai or samprabhu swechha se inkaa sauda nahin kar sakate hai
 Since 2012, the parliamentary grant and the civil list have been merged and replaced with a narrow sovereign grant
 mukutiy sampada kii tarah hi lankaster kii dachi kii bhoomi va sampattiyaan bhi shahi nyaas ke antargat raakhi gayi he
 All this is part of the royal allowance
 is dachi dwaara utpann rajasav ko shaasha ke "nijee kharchon" ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he, jo naagarik suchi dwaara vahan nahi kiye jate hai
 Similarly, the Duchy of Cornwall is an area, allotted for the personal expenses of the ruler's eldest son in trust
 samprabhu, mulya vardhit kar jaise apratyaksh karon ke paatr he, or 1993 se iskar tathaa puunji laabh kar ke bhi
 In this context, citizen list and parliamentary grant are not considered income, as they are given for official functions
 rani kii kul sampatti ke anumaan kaa, is baat ke aadhaar par kii, anumaan lagane main keval vyaktigat sampatti ko gina jaa rahaa he yaa shaasha ke dwaara nyaas main yojit sampatti ko bhi liya jaa rahaa he, ke aadhaar par kaaphi fark pad saktaa he
 For example, the royal collection is not the personal property of the Adhirat, but is disciplined by the "crown Collection Trust", a charity
 forbs patrika kii 2008 ke anumaan main rani kii nijee sampatti ko $ 650 million bataaya gaya tha, parantu iske koi aadhikarik aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 In 1993 Lord Chamberlain stated that the £ 100 million estimate of the Queen's personal wealth was "grossly exaggerated", announced in the press
 " The official residence in London is Buckingham Palace, which in addition to being an official residence, is also the main site of most state and royal ceremonies

 About 16 million lightning is produced every year in the world
 sambhavat: anya kisi bhi prakritik ghatana ne itnaa bhay, romaanch or aashcharya nahin utpann kiya hoga or na aaj bhi karti hogi jitna taditapaat or badalon kii kadak se utpann hota he
 From time immemorial, the belief was prevalent in almost all the countries of the world that lightning is the punishment of God, which he inflicts on the creature or object on which he becomes angry
 greek or roman deshvasi ise bhagwaan jupiter kaa prahaardand maan te the
 Even today, many people think the same and rely more on the superstition that has been cultivated instead of trying to understand the scientific cause of lightning
 pracheen dharmagrathon main varnit anek kathaayen unke is andhvishwaas ko bal detii hai
 When there was some increase in the electrical information, the scientists came to the idea that the phenomenon of lightning is similar to the way the condenser flows through the air between the plates when it is exposed
 is dharna kii pushti karne ke liye prayog karne kaa saahas kisi ko nahin hota tha; kintu ant main benjamin franklin kii prerana se france ke do vaigyanikon, dalibard or delor, ne prayog karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He took two metal rods
 dalibard kaa chad 40 foot tathaa delor kaa chad 99 foot unchaa tha
 With both rods, they were able to immerse sphulings of about one and a half inches in length
 yah prayog anyant khatarnaak tha or aage chalakar ek anya vaigyanik ne yahi prayog doharaate samay apane praanon se hi haath dhoyaa tha
 Nevertheless, it could not be determined from the above experiment that the electricity generated in the sticks came from the clouds, because the rods had no access to the clouds
 isaliye benjamin franklin ne apana patangvaala suvikhyath prayog kiya
 He flew a kite and carried it inside the clouds
 jyonhi patang kii door bhigi, patang or door donon hi tan gaye jisase yah pataa chalaa ki donon vidyut aavesh yukt ho gaye he
 Franklin also tied a key in that door
 chaabi ke paas ungali le jane se donon ke chatchathat kii aawaaj ke saath sphulingon kaa visarjan hua
 Not only this, he also charged him by touching the key with a leaden jar
 isse yah nishchit ho gaya ki badalon main bhi vidyut hoti he
 The immersion in the electric form of this power is called "lightning"
 yah visarjan badal or badal, athwa badal or prithvi, ke bich ho saktaa he
 Lightning usually occurs in the Kapasivarshi clouds
 in meghon main atyant prabal urdhvagami pavandharaayen chalati hai, jo lagbhag 40,000 foot kii oonchaai tak pahunchati hai
 There are some such activities in them, due to which the electric charges are generated and dissociated
 in kriyaaon ke spashtikaran ke liye wilson, simpasan, sakrij aadi ne apane siddhant prastut kiye hai, jo paraspar virdohi jaan padate hai, kintu itnaa to sabhi batalaate hai ki tadit kii jananaprakriya meghon main hoti he or iske liye un meghon main vidyaman jalsikar, athwa himakan aadi avakshepan kan, hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 Even with respect to the electrification of clouds, all are unanimous that their upper levels are rich and the middle and lower levels are negative
 in aaveshon kaa vibhaajan meghon ke andar shunya degree sein0 tapawale staron ke bhi kaaphi upar hota he
 From this, it is easy to conclude that the charge is formed by the snowflakes formed in the clouds and the upward wind currents, not by the water droplets
 kabhi-kabhi nimna str main bhi kahin-kahin dhanaveshon kaa ek centre sa ban jaataa he
 Due to the formation of negative charge at low levels of clouds, the positive charges are generated by induction at the bottom of the earth
 badalon ke aage badhane ke saath hi prithvi par ke ye dhanavesh bhi thik usee prakaar aage badhate jate hai
 Attracted by negative charges, the surface positive charges climb up to the conductor or semiconductor objects standing on the earth
 is vidhi se jab meghon kaa vidyutikaran is seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he ki padosi aaveshkendron ke bich vibhav pravanta vibhang maan tak pahunch jaati he, tab vidyut kaa visarjan deergh sphuling ke rup main hota he
 This is called lightning
 prithvi kii ore aanevaali tadit kai kramon main hokar pahunchati he
 a hilol of electrons from the cloud comes down 50 meters in 1 micro second and stops
 lagbhag 50 maa0 se0 ke pashchaat doosraa kram aarambh hota he or isi prakaar kai kramon main hokar ant main yah tarang prithvi tak pahunchati he
 This is called major trauma
 apane udgamasthal se prithvi tak pahunchne main ise kul 0
002 second tak kaa samay lagata he
 The above facts were revealed by the photo taken by Schönland and his colleagues with the help of a highly sensitive camera
 usee photo pattica par yah bhi dikhalaai padaa ki pramukh kram ke prithvi par pahunchne ke kshan hi ek atyant tikshan jyoti prithvi se meghon kii ore unheen kramon main hokar gai jinase hokar pramukh kram aayaa tha
 This is called regressive emergency
 jahaan pramukh kram kaa ausat veg 105 meter prati second hota he vahiin pratigaami aadhaat kaa veg 107 meter prati second hota he, kyonki uskaa maarg pehle se hi ynit hone ke kaaran prashast rahata he
 Even after the above major and regressive strokes, many strokes are seen moving downwards and upwards respectively
 ye dwitiyak aghat kehalaate hai
 These secondary accidents coming down do not come in the same order as the major shock
 si0 epa0 vagner or ji0 di0 mccan ne batalaaya he ki badalon ke vibhav praaia: do karod volt kii koti ke hote he
 Simpson and Screege concluded by experiments that the potential of clouds at a height of 10,000 feet often declined at a rate of 50 to 100 volts per cm
 tadit prakriya ke bich main vidyuddhara kaa maan do lakh se pandrah hajaar ampiore ke bich rahata he
 Due to this strong current, the molecules and atoms of air entering the path of lightning ionize and produce light
 yahi chamak hamen damini ke rup main dikhalaai padati he
 It is clear that through air the electrification between the clouds and the earth will be more probable where the power will have to cross the resistance of the air to a minimum
 isaliye unchi minaaron, unche bhawanon, ekaaki vriksh tathaa pataakadand ityadi par taditapaat adhiktar hota he iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki koi vastu badal se jitani hi adhki nikat hogi, usapar utana hi adhik prarit aavesh utpann hoga
 Apart from this, due to the point of the minarets, tree peaks, etc
 being more flat than the flat ground, the electric charge accumulates on them more
 taditaghatjanit vidyuddhara ekadish hoti he
 In the period of five microseconds of shock, its value increases from exponential order to maximum and decreases to only half within about 25 microseconds
 yah prabal dhara praaia: 100 microsecond tak rahati he
 After this, some of the decreasing thousand respectively reach the ampere and it remains the same for some millennium seconds
 yadi taditaghaat kii punrariti nahin hui to kam hote hote yah dhara nishesh ho jaati he
 There are generally three types of lightning: vistrut tadit kaaphi vistrut kshetra par hoti he or iskaa aviral prakaash badalon par kaaphi dur tak fail jaataa he
 Striped or lined lightning is often visible
 isamen ek yaa adhik prakasharekhaayen, sidhi yaa tedi idhar-udhar daudti hui drushtigochar hoti hai
 In this, the electric discharge would be from cloud to cloud, cloud to earth or cloud to atmosphere
 yah tadit swayan teen prakaar kii ho sakati: Like a lighted ball lightning the condom, the earth is seen coming
 iskaa ausat vyas 20 senmi0 hota he
 As it moves towards the Earth, its velocity decreases
 lagbhag teen se paanch second tak dikhalaai padane ke uparaant vah atyant prachand dhwani ke saath visphotit ho jaati he
 It appears very rare and the cause of its origin is unknown
 bhawanon ko tadit ke sidhe aghat se bachaane ke liye benjamin franklin dwaara viksit tadit dand vyavastha sarvaadhik shreshth he
 An iron rod, with its upper end pointed like a spear and protruding to the very top of the building, is buried deep inside the ground through the side of the building
 nichalaa sira bhoomi main taanbe kii ek pattica main laga hota he
 This lightning not only paves the way for the minimum resistance to lightning existing in the cloud, but it instantly transmits the induced currents produced on the building to the earth immediately
 is prakaar yah badalon or bhawan ke bich aaveshon ke parsparik aakarshan kii sambhaavna bhi paryaapt gata detaa he
 Since the past, during the days of electric cymbals, sailors have been seeing the erosion of the lightning of the clouds from the mast of their ships
 yah ksharan raat ko adhik spasht dikhalaai padataa he
 It is called the fire of the European sailor Saint Elmo
 aajkal taditaniyantran sambandhi anek prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 a recreational experiment was done by sitting a person in a motorcar and sending artificial light from top to bottom on that motor
 chunki tadit main vidyaman electranon main, samaan aaveshyukt hone ke kaaran, paraspar vikarshan hota he, isaliye motorcar kii chat par girte hi ve bikhar gaye or uski deevaaron se hote hue neeche prithvi main chale gaye
 This could not penetrate the motor and the person remained completely safe
 is prayog se yah nishchay ho jaataa he ki aadhunik dhaatu ke dhaanchevaale bhawanon main, jinaki neenv kaaphi gahari hoti he, baitha hua vyakti tadit ke prahaar se atyant niraapad hota he
 If such buildings, or light-headed buildings, cannot be found, then shelter should be taken in such a large building which is quite wide

 But efforts were made by him to resolve the matter under pressure which worsened the situation completely
 25 march 1971 ko pakistan ke is hisse main sena evam police kii aguai main jabardast narsanhaar hua
 This led to tremendous fury among the residents of the eastern region working in the Pakistani Army and formed a separate Mukti Corps

 The first crystallinity refers to the science in which crystals are studied
 eks-kiran ke difrackson dwaara crystalonke adhyayanke pehle crystalonka adhyayan keval unki jyamiti dekhakar kii jaati thi
 But nowadays it is done by defraxing various types of beam
 manibhavigyaan, yaa crystalki vah vidya he, jisamen manibhon yaa crystalon kii akruti, gun or sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 'crystal' is derived from the Greek word crustalos
 crustolos kaa mul arth he "him", par yah shabd baad main shail-crystal ke liye, jo quartz kii ek rangahin paardarshak kism he, prayukt kiya jane laga
 In ancient times people believed that it was formed due to freezing of water due to excessive frost
 shanai: shanai: "crystal" shabd kisi bhi aise khanij ke liye prayukt kiya jane laga, jo swabhaav se hi sadhran falkon se ghira hota he
 The term cannot be used for ring gems and other ornaments, because the well-arranged flat panels that appear in them are not made in a natural way, but are artificial
 ye falak katkar polish karne ke baad banaae jate hai
 True crystal panels are formed as a result of natural crystallization, whether the crystallization action is in the crust or in the laboratory
 duusari avasthaa main kistalan ke liye padaarth or vaataavaran to manushya dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he, lekin crystal kii vaastavik rachana tathaa uske vishisht falkon kaa vikaas manushya ke hastkshep ke bina hota he
 These panels are formed as a result of a special internal atomic structure
 isi sanrachana par crystal ke bhautik gun nirbhar karte hai
 An artificial gemstone made of glass does not have a regular internal structure, so it is not counted in a crystal despite being externally similar to a crystal
 at:, crystal kii sachhee pahchaan uske anuon ke parmaanuon ke niyamit vinyas dwaara hoti he
 a crystal is an even mass, which is usually solid and is surrounded by smooth flat faces on all four sides, based on specific principles
 iske bhautik gun nishchit rahete hai
 Both its external form and physical properties are the external sign of regular internal structure
 adhiktar khanij, jo upyukt avasthaaon ke antargat banate hai, crystal hote hai
 There are some substances, which we call liquid crystals
 yadhyapi inamen niyamit parmanviya vinyas kaa pramaan miltaa he, tathaapi ye sachche thos nahin he
 On the other hand there are some solid minerals which do not have regular atomic structure
 inhen ravaaheen kehete hai
 Some crystals are very small
 inke falkon kaa vikaas sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se bhi nahin spasht hota
 These are called deep crystals
 saadhaarant: crystalia shabd kisi bhi aise padaarth ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen parmaanu ek niyamit rup main vyavasthit rahete hai, lekin crystal shabd unheen crystalia padaarthon ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he jo chaaron ore se samtal falkon se ghire hote hai
 The size of the crystal depends on the crystallization time
 crystalan jitna dhire-dhire hoga, crystal utane hi bade banenge
 When the crystogen occurs quickly, the molecules do not have the opportunity to move more towards the growth center
 is kaaran bade-bade crystalon kii rachana nahin ho paati he
 At the same time, the activity of molecules also slows down due to increasing viscosity
 vilyan, galan or vaashpan teenon avasthaaon main crystalan ho saktaa he
 The crystals in a solution are formed by the evaporation of the "solvent", the temperature of the solvent drops, or the pressure decreases
 is prakaar namak ke crystal, sodium chloride ke jaleey vilyan se, teenon main se kisi bhi vidhi se ban sakate hai
 Similarly, crystals can be formed from molten material of the same composition
 jal se him crystal kii rachana tathaa pighale hue megma se aagney shail kii rachana iske saadhaaran udhaaharan hai
 In the previous example, as the liquid magma cools down, it forms communities of the mineral molecules present in it and eventually forms the mineral content of the molten rock
 vaashp se crystal kii rachana apekshaakrit durlabh he
 Examples of this are ice crystals made from atmospheric water vapor and sulfur crystals made from sulfuric vapors emitted from hot water springs belonging to volcanoes
 khanij vigyaan ke adhyayan main crystalki kaa mahatvapurn yoga he
 The minerals found in the crust are usually homogeneous crystalline solids
 inamen adhiktar suviksit crystal kii akritiyaan, jo aantarik anvik sanrachana se sambhddha hai, milti hai
 Among these, gemstones like diamond, red, sapphire, emerald, topaz, amethyst etc
 are particularly notable
 in crystalia khanijon ko, jinamein crystal kii akritiyaan nahin dikhaai detii hai, ghiskar patale tukade nikaale jate hai or unka dhruvan sookshmdarshi ke dwaara pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 This test gives some knowledge of the elements of crystalline symmetry present in those minerals, based on which the intrinsic molecular dislocation of those minerals, on which the shape of the mineral's crystals depends, is also the basis of the physical and optical properties of the mineral
 yah vigyaan thos carbonic tathaa acarbonic yogicon ke adhyayan main samaan rup se upyogi he
 Many of these compounds form crystal shapes, which helps in their identification
 un crystalia padaarthon kaa jinamein aasaani se pahchaan main aanevaali crystal akritiyaan nahin dikhaai deteen, yaa jo crystalakomapi dwaara adhyayan ke liye bahut chote hai, eksre dwaara vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 Thus, photographic models obtained by some methods are interpreted on the basis of internal crystalline symmetry, thereby taking advantage of identifying them
 crystal kisi vishesh laabh praturup kii ikai kii punrariti se bana ek niyamit samudaay he
 Thus, the symmetry of this unit signifies the external symmetry of the crystal of the substance concerned
 crystalan kaa adhyayan dhaatukarm ke liye aprihaary he
 Some metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, obtained as pure elements in the crust, show a crystalline form, but some of the metals, which are extracted from minerals, do not reveal the external shapes of the crystallization method
 in dhaatuon kii aantarik sanrachana or samamiti adhyayan ke liye saranchana chrisalaki kii vidhiyon ko upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 These methods are also being used nowadays in the study of clay minerals, whose presence or absence makes the properties of the soil known to determine whether the clay is useful for making porcelain and porcelain
 ye khanij bahut chote chote kanon se lekar colidi maap ke aakaar main praapt hote hai tathaa teen virgon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai
 X-ray analysis has revealed that these minerals are crystalline
 electron sookshmdarshi ke dwaara, jisamen ek lakh guna aavardhan hota he, inamen se bahut se crystalon kii bahya akritiyaan dekhi gai hai
 Many methods of structure crystals have been successfully used in the study of so-called liquid crystals, such as cholesterol estates, ammonium olite, etc
 in crystalon ko pracheen kaal main nishchit rup se drav mana gaya tha
 But it is only solid in the intermediate state
 inamen dikhaai denevaali drav prakruti, yaa dridhtaa kii kami, crystal ke balon kii kamajori ke kaaran hai, jo itane shaktishaalee nahin hai ki kisi ek nishchit jyamitiya akruti ko banaae rakh saken
 The first significant gift to Krystalki is that of the Danish physician Nicolas Stann
 san 1669 main aapane batalaaya ki ek crystal ke kuch kone sadaa baraabar rahete hai, chaahe falkon ke rup or aakaar main kitna hi antar kyon na ho
 a few years later, Hygenz considered the refraction of calcite by assuming that it was composed of small elliptical particles in a regular order, and based on this, you saw the crystal's shape, cleavage, variation in its hardness, and directions
 Simultaneously explained the double refraction
 18veen shatabdi main crystalki ke kshetra main koi vishesh pragati nahin hui
 Only solvents, which contained solutes, formed crystals by evaporation
 inhen 'kritrim crystal' kaha gaya
 Romé de L'लle studied many natural and artificial crystals with the help of instrument called contact crystal angiometer
 yah yantra unke sahaayak karangyo ne san 1780 main kone maapne ke liye banaaya tha
 On this basis you set up six "primary shapes": cube, even octave, rhombus, parallel hexahedral, octagonal on a rhombus base, and double-pied pyramidal
 anya akritiyon ke liye yah kalpana kii gai he ki ve uparyukt prayek akruti ke kinaaron or ghan konon ke falkon dwaara pratisthaapan se nirmit hui hai
 The first work of Romé de l'ile was published in 1772 AD
 uskaa doosraa vistrut sanskaran 1783 i main chapa
 As a result of your work, the rule of stability of the interface angle, whose foundation was laid by the stans 100 years ago, was fully established
 yadhyapi crystalavigyaani crystal kii sambhavya aantarik sanrachana ke vishay main pehle se hi pariklpana kar rahe the, par is sambandh main suvyasthit varnan sabase pehle san 1784 i
 main abi aui ne kiya
 While inspecting the cleavage surfaces associated with the shape of the crystal, you established the idea that a crystal is made up of iterations of the smallest possible molecule unit
 is aadharbhoot ekak kii akruti ko us crystal kii samamiti ke anuroop mana gaya
 On the basis of this unit, crystals of different nature could have been formed, if a few lines were regularly discarded as the selection progressed
 is prakaar ghanakon kii ikai se ek vishamalambaaksh dwadashafalak ban saktaa he, yadi ghan namoonay kaa chayan karte samay kinaaron par ke "ghanakon" ko chhod diya jaay
 This unit can form an octal if left unselected at the corners
 purna crystal or uski aadharbhoot ikai ke sambandh ke aadhaar par aui ne "parimey ghaataank" ke niyam ko, jo crystalki kaa sabase mahatvapurn niyam he, sthapit kiya
 The significance of this discovery of Aui can be gauged from the fact that he is called the father of the crystal
 aui ke "parimey ghaataank" ke niyam ke aadhaar par san 1830 main hezel ne yah gyaat kiya ki samtal falkon vaale thos pindon main 32 prakaar kii samamitiyaan sambhav hai
 Your work remained inadvertently for a long time
 swatantra rup se gadolin phon laing bhi usee nishkarsh par pahunche jis par hezel pahunche the or unhone 1870 i
 main is tathy ko purna rup se sthapit kar diya
 The work of the internal structure of the crystal continued to progress after the discovery of Oui, and it is assumed that the structure of large crystals results from the repetition of the molecular unit of the crystal or the space surrounded by crystals of multivariate units
 is kshetra main sibar, dena, brooster, delaphos aadi ke naam ullekhiy he
 However, there was no significant progress regarding the composition and shape of the crystal units
 pichley varshon main bahut se ganitagya or crystalavigyaani un bhinn bhinn vinyason kii khoj main lage rahe jinke dwaara vibhinn samudaayon ke crystal apni ikai koshikaon se bane
 The first work in this direction was that of Frankenheim
 inkaa vishwaas tha ki 15 prakaar ke vibhinn vinyas sambhav hai
 These configurations were of stereoscopic nature
 breves ne frankenhim ke trivimzalkon ke liye pusht pramaan die or yah bhi dikhalaayaa ki un 15 main se do vinyas bilkul samaan hai
 He divided these 14 stereoscopes, which are the foundation of the crystal structure, into seven communities
 brevais ne yah bhi suzav diya ki prayek anu ke gurutvakentre ke chaaron ore parmaanuon kii jyamitiya vyavastha samaan he
 In other words, the environment of each point in Braves' stereoscope is similar to the environment of each other point and is equally oriented
 uparyukt bindu anuon ke gurutv centre kaa dyotak he
 Weiner also established this principle independently
 tulyarup parmaanuon kii vyavastha kii niyamitata ke antargat prayek aisa parmaanu aa jaataa he, jiske chaaron ore duusare parmaanu usee tareeke se vyavasthit hote hai
 In the same year Jordan, by referencing crystals, found out only on the basis of mathematics how possible the regular frequency of the so-called all-encompassing circles is possible
 viner ke siddhant ko maanakar tathaa jordan kii vidhi ko crystal main prayukt kar sohanke ne gyaat kiya ki 65 bindu khaas tareekon se avkaash main vyavasthit ho sakate hai, jabaki keval samaan paryaavaran kii aavashyaktaa he na ki samaan abhivinyas kii, jaisaa ki brevais ke trivimzaal main
 From these 65 Bindu communities, such a structural arrangement was obtained, which not only provided for the full-fledged class of different communities, as was also the case in the Bravais Stereoscopic, but also the symmetry of many classes below it
 trivimdik main paravartan tathaa pratilomon kriyaaon kaa samavesh kar fedorof, shouenflise or barlo ne swatantra rup se tathaa vibhinn tareekon se adhyayan kar 195 sanrachanaatmak anuvinyas vyavasthaayen gyaat kin
 Thus all the points became community or class 230
 ab neeche kii shrenee kii samamiti ko bhi samajhnaa sambhav ho gaya
 The 32 symmetry classes thus established correspond to the 32 classes of crystal symmetry, which are considered in the natural crystal
 yadhyapi crystal sanrachana kaa jyamitiya siddhant pichhali shatabdi ke antkaal main safaltaapurvak sthapit hua, par crystal ke visheshgy crystal ke moulik ikai ke aakaar, maap or swabhaav ke bare main anbhigya hi the
 The units have until now been considered to be the cube parallelogram of Oui, or Fedoroff's plane
 pope or baalo ke vichaar main ye bahufalkeey ikaiyaan pratyasth, par asampidya or virupaneey golon ke sanghanit samucchy se vyutpann hai
 Only after Rantgen, the discovery of the X-ray, and by Fon Laeva used it to find the inner structure of the crystal, were these units considered as spheres of atomic aggregates
 kuch vaigyanikon ne eks kiranpunj ke vivartan ke liye crystal ke krambaddh parmaanuon ko uchit grting ke rup main upyog karne kii baat sochi
 The first experiments in this regard were carried out by his colleagues, Friedrich and Nipping
 shwet eks kiranpunj ko ek crystal main le hokar bheja gaya or use ek photographic plate par liya gaya
 Washing this plate revealed a lot of dark spots around a central black part, which was in a regular pattern
 is prakaar ke photograph ke adhyayan se apekshaakrit saral crystalon kii sanrachana ko jaan lenaa sambhav hua
 Other activists increased the speed of research with improved techniques after Lavé's discovery
 dablyoo ech bragg or dablyoo el bragg ne crystalon kii gyaat dishaao main kati platon ko ek eks kiran spectrometer par, jisamen ekvarni vikiran prayog karne kii vyavastha thi, ghumaya
 Dibai and Scherr pressed Crystal's powder into a small bar and punched it in a small bar, placing it in the axis of a cylindrical microtubule film and placing monochromatic x rays on it
 is prakaar se prabhavit film ko develop karne par kuch vakr rekhaayen praapt huin
 These were the same ray beam interpolation figures
 shibold ne ek vidhi nikaali, jisamen puure crystal ko ek mukhya mandal main ghumaya jaataa he or usapar ekvarni vikiran daalaa jaataa he
 To find the diffraction, either a flat or a cylindrical photographic plate can be used
 is vidhi ke dwaara crystal kii ikai koshika kii vimayein thik thik prakaar maapi ja sakati hai
 In this rotation method, the Weissenberg improved further
 crystal ko ek chote kone kii seemaa ke bheetar main idhar udhar dolit kiya jaataa he or belanaakaar camera crystal ke saath hi saath is tarah ghumta he ki udbhasana ke samay baraabar uske saath rahata he
 The dimensions of the unit cell, as determined by X-ray analysis, often correspond to the latent proportions known by crystal angiometry in all minerals
 eks kiran vishleshan dwaara ham crystal kii sanrachana ko purnataya jaan sakate hai
 The crystal is first placed in the proper stereoscope, then the contents of its unit cell are made known
 crystal chaaron ore se satahon se ghira hota he
 These surfaces are called panels
 falak saadhaarant: samtal or chikne hote hai
 Plaques can be of the same type or different types
 yadi sab falak ek tarah ke hote hai tathaa samaan rup se viksit hote hai tab unki jyamitiya akritiyaan samaan hoti hai
 But the shape of these types of faces is different if they are obtained in combination with other types of faces
 ek hi praroop ke sabhi falak ek crystal rup ke sadsy hote hai
 This form is a combination of faces whose presence is necessary for crystal symmetry when one of them is present
 in falkon kii sankhya us crystal samamiti ke upar nirbhar karti he
 The line joining the two appendages is called the core of the crystal
 vah konaa jahaan teen yaa adhik falak milte hai konia, jise bahut se lekhak ghan kone kehete hai, kehalaata he
 In a crystal similar to a polyhedron, the addition of the pane number and the cone number becomes equal to the number of cores and the addition of two
 crystalki main do falkon par khinche gaye antarafalak abhilanbon ke bich ke kone ko ant:falak kone kehete hai
 It is to be kept in mind that this angle is the complement of the actual angle between the faces
 yah vishesh prakaar kaa antarafalak kone, kone maapne kii vidhi ke anuroop he
 It is also compatible with mathematical calculations on the one hand and the stereoscopic representation of the crystal faces on the other side and subsequent spherical trigonometry
 apekshaakrit bade crystalon kaa antarafalak kone maapne ke liye sansparsh crystal konemapi, jise 1870 i
 main karangyo ne banaaya tha, upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Many panels in the crystal can be arranged such that their surfaces, where the attached pairs meet, are parallel
 aise falkon ke samudaay ko mandal kehete hai
 The imaginary line, which passes through the center of the crystal and which is parallel to the cores, is called the mandrel axis and the plane in which the faces of all the faces of the circle are called mandalasal
 falak ek yaa anek rup ke ho sakate hai
 There are many ways to display crystals on paper
 ek sidhaa or saral tarika crystal ke koron kaa ek vaisaa hi nakshaa kheenchna he, jaisaa ki ve ek bindu se, jo thik unke upar parimit duuri par ho, dikhaai dete hai
 Two identical views can also be displayed, the first as seen from the front and the second as seen from the right
 ye teenon drishy ejineering ke neenv vinyas, saamne kaa utthapan or bagali utthapan ko kramash: nirupit karte hai
 This method of representation is called perpendicular interpolation
 pravanta prakshep main crystal ko ek udagr samtal ke upar prakshepit kiya jaataa he
 In it, the crystal is seen from a point which is 9 ° 28 "at an infinite distance from the surface of the topmost pane, or conia, and 18 ° 26" to the right
 crystalon ke falak, samamiti kii nishchat yojanaon ke anusaar vyavasthit rahete hai
 Some base symbols, called the basic components of symmetry, are studied
 ye avyav nimnlikhit hai : If a symmetric plane is present in the crystal, it divides the crystal into two identical and equal parts in such a way that one part is a reflection of the other
 yadi crystal main ek samamiti aksh he, jo us aksh par crystal ko ghumaane se, ek puure chakra main, crystal kaa ek hi nirdisht rup ek baar se adhik, do, teen, chaar baar dikhalaai padataa he
 In this view, the symmetric axis is called a triangular, triangular, quadrangular, or hexagonal symmetric axis
 uparyukt samamiti akshon ke liye crystal ko kramash: 180 degree, 120 degree, 90 degree or 60 degree ghumana padataa he
 Axial symmetry greater than the hexagonal symmetry axis is not possible in crystals
 or na panchakoniya aksheeya samamiti hi sambhav he
 If a symmetry center is present in the crystal, a conia present in one part of the crystal, a core or contiguous conia of a pane, core or vane is also present in the opposite part of the crystal
 kisi crystal main samamiti avyav or unke gunon ko jaanane ke liye crystal ko samroop falkon ke asmaan vikaas se honevaali aniyamittaaon se, jaisaa ki prakruti main saadhaarant: hota he, mukt kalpit kiya jaataa he
 In the case of geometric symmetry only, the symmetry center or the corner, core or plane in the opposite side of a plane, should be equally spaced
 isamen vipareet falak bhi ek hi aakaar or rup ke hote hai
 In crystal structural symmetry, the symmetry of the interface angle is the determinant component, the expansion and shape of the panels are not important due to natural deformation
 crystal main virupan kaa kaaran vilaayakon kii shuddhta yaa crystal kii vruddhi gati, taap yaa sampeden main pratikulata he
 These facts determine the particular form of the crystal
 crystal kaa vishesh rup upasthit roopon tathaa prayek rup ke falkon ke aapekshik vistaar ke lakshanon ke yoga kaa hi parinaam he
 The term "" special form "" is used, along with the principal facet configurations existing in crystals, or the words used for prismatic and flat forms that result from greater growth in one or two directions in the crystal
 crystal kii samamiti kii visheshtaon ko purna rup se adhyayan karke pracheen kaaryakartaaon ne samamiti kaa niyam banaaya
 This formula or rule is as follows: The faces of a crystal are located according to the definite component of symmetry
 us crystal ke liye falkon kii sthiti nishchat rahati he or isi par uskaa bahyarup tathaa bhautik gun nirbhar karata he
 Earlier activists also found that no matter how different the crystals of a substance show, their corresponding interface is the basic formula for the stability of the angle
 crystalia aksh vah kalpit rekha hai, jo crystal ke centre se hokar jaati he
 These fictitious lines are used as reference axes to indicate the position of the crystal panels
 saadhaarant: ye aksh mukhya samamiti aksh hote hai, yaa kuch koron ke samaantar hote hai
 Depending on the nature of the crystal, three symmetry planes are normal or some or four such axis values of the crystal can be assumed
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki aksh ek duusare ke baraabar hon, yaa doosar par samaan rup se jhuke hon
 The relative lengths of these axes are called 'axial ratio'
 ye adhiktar x, y, z dwaara likhi jaati hai
 It is customary to consider y as the unit
 ve aapekshik dooriyaan jinpar crystal falak ke crystalia akshon ko katate hai unka ant:khandi anupaat kehalaata he
 The pane, which cuts the axes in such a way that the ratio of those distances is proportional to the units of the successive axes, is called the unit pane, or parametric plane
 ekak falak nirdhaaran karne ke liye saadhaarant: sabase adhik milanevaali falak samshti ko hi chun liya jaataa he
 The size, or slope of any pane can be expressed by their unit intercepts
 yadi ek falak teen akshon x, y, z par a, b, c antarkhand katata he, tab unke sambandh ko vaais kii vidhi ke anusaar ax, by, cz dwaara dikhalaayaa ja saktaa he
 The exponential method, first popularized by Miller, is more prevalent in place of Vice's parameter method
 is vidhi ke vyutkramank yaa ghaataank yadi bhinn main hai, to guna kar inako purna sankhya main badalakar prayog kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, if a panel cuts the x axis twice the distance of the unit and y three times the distance, and is parallel to Z, its vice-sign will be 2 x, 3 y, ¥ z
 inke vyutkramank 1 / 2, 1 / 3 1 / ¥ honge
 Multiplying by 6 it will be 3, 2, 0
 at: is falak kaa milarchihr 3, 2, 0 likhaa jayega or yah teen, do, shunya padhaa jayega
 Sometimes it is placed in small brackets, because X-rays in crystals indicate signs without compositions
 majhale koshthak main yah {3 2 0} falak ke puure rup ko batalaata he or bade koshthkon main yah ek mandal ko suchit karata he
 The collation sign is important for all of Krystalki's methods, goniometry reading, three-dimensional interpolation and mathematical calculation
 anubhav se gyaat hua he ki saamanyat: ek crystal main keval ve hi falak rahete hai, jinke aksheeya ant:rkhand ikai ke laghugunit, yaa anant hote hai
 Similarly, Miller exponents are simple rational numbers or zeros
 ise parimey ghaataank niyam kehete hai
 It is not possible to have exponents like 20
5 or 1
327 xxrep 5 
 etc
 bhinn bhinn prakaar ke crystalon ko samajhane ke liye suvidhanusaar crystalia akshon kii bhinn bhinn avasthaaen kalpit kii jaati hai
 They are classified into six crystal communities

 In the quadrilateral community, two equal horizontal axes Y1 and Y2 form right angles to each other and the vertical axis is unequal
 trisamalambaaksh samudaay ke teen aksh samaan hai or ek duusare par samakon banaate hai
 Y1, Y2 are horizontal and Y3 is vertical

 In fact, some of these are complete or full-scale forms, in which all the planes required for the full symmetry of that community exist
 inamen kuch rup aanshik hote hai, jaise ardhafalakeey or chaturthanshfalakeey akritiyaan
 In half-surface shapes, half the faces of the complete community shapes of the same community and one-fourth of the quadrilateral figures are present
 iske atirikt bhi ek or aanshik rup hota he, jise ardhakriti rup kehete hai
 In this, half of the planar crystals are centered on, or are formed on only one side of the crystal, the remaining half is either absent, or the other half is represented there
 kisi bhi samudaay se sambhddha, ye aanshik rup us samudaay ke purnafalkeey rup kii apeksha nimna shrenee kii samamiti ke hote hai
 Hence crystals of any community fall under different symmetry classes
 samamiti virgon kaa namakaran us varg ke sabase adhik saadhaaran rup ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 In principle considering all possible combinations of symmetry, 32 classes of symmetry have been determined
 saadhaarant: inamen se keval 11 hi khanijon main milte hai, anya 13 khajinon tathaa kritrim crystalon main durlabhta se milte hai or anya 6 to keval kritrim crystalon main hi milte hai

 In many cases, there is absolutely no change
 inamen crystalia ikaiyaan avyavasthit rup se judi rahati hai or is prakaar ek "aniyamit samucchy" kii rachana hoti he
 Similarly, "heterogeneous aggregates" may also have almost complete alteration, such as a natural growth mantle or partial alteration, or a complete absence of alteration

 Crystals of low-grade symmetry are sometimes simulated by crystals of relatively high-grade symmetry through cyclic Yamal
 crystalon main yamalan kaa kaaran anuon main purna samaantaran kii kami maani jaati he, jo crystalan ke prakram main anublon ko yathochit samay na milane ke kaaran hoti he
 In cyclic Yamals, there seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to obtain high symmetry of the Yamalan crystals

 veshyaaon ko kaamshaastra kii shiksha denevaali nari ko kuttani kehete hai
 Its existence as an essential part of the prostitute institution is seen for the first time around the fifth century AD
 isse anumaan hota he ki iskaa aavirbhaav gupt samrajya ke vaibhavshaalee or bhogavilas ke yug main hua
 In order to show the widespread influence of Kuttani, great utility for prostitutes and the accomplishment of subjugation of sexiest people, Damodar Gupta, the Prime Minister of Kashmir King Jayaped, wrote a poem called Kuttanimatam
 yah kavy apni madhurima, shabdasoshthav tathaa arthgambhiry ke nimitt aalochanajgat main paryaapt vikhyath he, parantu kavi kaa vastavaki abhipraay sajjanon ko kuttani ke hatkandon se bachaana he
 For this purpose, the famous poet Kshemendra of Kashmir also practiced poems named Samyamatruka and Deshopadesh in the eleventh century
 in donon kaavyon main kuttani ke rup, gun tathaa kaary kaa vistrut vivaran he
 Some description of Kuttani is also available in Hindi texts
 kuttani avasthaa main vruddh hoti he jise kaami sansar kaa bahut anubhav hota he
 Kuttani, depicted in Kuttinamat, can be easily guessed from the Kutni as the outer shape of the Kutni - the inner eyes, the inferior to the Bhushan and the lower part of the ear hanging below, the head made of black and white with Ganges, the veins on the body
 , Stretched neck, white washed dhoti and sheet-embellished body, Embellished thread embellished with many herbs and beads, fine gold trick in junior finger La
 veshyaaon ko unke vyavsaay kii shiksha dena tathaa unhen un hatkandon kaa gyaan karana jinke bal par ve kaami janon se prabhoot dhan kaa apharan kar saken, iskaa pradhan kaary he
 Kshmendra has compared it to many Hissar animals due to this special quality - it is a blood-drinking and meat-eating disease, which the sensual people make like a jackal, bouncing: kuttani ke bina veshya apane vyavsaay kaa purna nirvaah nahin kar sakati
 An inexperienced prostitute's guru sthaniya kuttani is a statue of deceit and deceit for the masses, there are odd instruments to make money; It is the river of Maya, famous for felling trees like trees, whose floods submerge thousands of rich houses: kuttani veshya ko kaamukon se dhan anthne kii shiksha detii hai, hriday dene kii nahin; vah use premsanpann dhanaheenon ko ghar se nikaal baahar karne kaa bhi upadesh detii he
 The above texts are preached to avoid him
