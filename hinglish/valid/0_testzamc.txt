 maanav sharir ke sookshm tatwon ko jaanane vaale bataate hai ki stri main rin or purush main dhan vidyut kaa bhandar hota he
 Even by sight seeing, this electric woman continues to produce a strange vibration in men
 parantu sharir ke sajiv tam praan kendra guhya sthanon kaa jab donon ekikaran karte hai tab to ek sharir vyapee tufaan utpann ho jaataa he
 The electrical magnitudes of both bodies penetrate both with great velocity and charge and produce a powerful intimate bonding-love in both
 ek duusare ke sookshm tatwon kaa ek duusare main badi teevr gati se prachur pariman main aadan-pradaan hota he
 This is why they become enamored with each other, an attraction and harmony is established between them which is exceptionally difficult to remove or break
 paanv daabana, sir masalana jaisi shaareerik sevaaon main aisi koi halchal nahin hoti kintu yon sambandh se do vyaktiyon ke sookshm praan tatwon main aavesh purna aadan-pradaan hota he
 Therefore, body service and sexual relations cannot be called equal
 pativrat or patnivrath kaa samarthan shaastra ne isi vaigyanik aadhaar par kiya he
 When a man is in contact with a woman, love between them increases
 ek kii shakti nishchit maarg se duusare ko praapt hoti he
 The qualities of karma come close to each other in nature and one soul becomes two bodies
 yon sambandh ke dwaara donon ke rakt main sajiv sanmishran hota he, kisi beemaari main kisi rogi ko rakt kaa injection dena hota he to doctor log pati-patni ke jode main se hi rakt lene ko mahatv dete hai
 Because a similar element arises due to coitus in the couple's blood
 pati-patni ke bich sachcha prem, vafadari, seva, atmiyata, vishwaas tabhi rah saktaa he jab unamem ‘ekanishtha’ kaa vrath ho
 If a woman establishes a secret relationship with many men or a man with many women, then due to the combination of many elements in her body, blood, mind, brain, instability, pulls, attraction, distraction starts
 aisi avasthaa main sachcha prem, vafadari evam atmiyata asambhav he
 The married life of adulterous men is full of treachery, cunning, illusion and deceit
 ve avasar padane par apane saathi ko dhokhaa de sakate hai
 Adultery is committed with theft, fear, shame and hesitation of sin, an attempt to hide it
 upyukt avasar foundne ke prapanch unke man main uthaa karte hai
 These sin circles, after coming to practice continuously for some time, they get deep in the human mind and take root
 phir uske swabhaav main ve baaten shaamil ho jaati hai or jivan ke vividh kshetron main ve prakatit hoti rahati hai
 This is why adulterous people are often thieves, cheeky, adventurous, cowardly, liars and thugs
 ve apane vyapaar tathaa vyavhaar main samay-samay par apni is kupravritiyon kaa parichay dete rahete hai
 Their faith is lost, people do not have a sense of prestige and respect for them, true cooperation is not found, consequently important paths of life development are closed
 paap vrittiyon ke man main jam jane se antajkaran kalushit hota he
 Reputation and fidelity are destroyed and there is a lack of true friendship or cooperation spirit in every field
 yah teenon hi baaten narak kii darun yatnaa ke samaan hai, vyabhichaari ko apane kukarm kaa dushprinaam isi jivan main uparyukt teen prakaar se nity hi bhugatna padataa he
 With the inclusion of female men, the effect of one goes on the other
 ek ke durgun duusare main pravesh hue bina nahin rahete
 Along with doing work, the other side also leaves the impression of its misgivings
 This layer gets stronger day by day and it becomes more degraded day by day
 vyabhichaar stri or purush donon ke liye ghaatak he, par striyon ke liye vishesh rup se ghaatak he
 The reason is that women take the male's semen in the most subtle, conscious and vital place of their body in the Guhyendriya
 veery pani kii buund nahin he varan purush ke sharir or man kaa saar bhoot praan satv he
 Every single drop of it is full of tremendous power to produce humans
 us prachand, shakti shaali praan satv ke saath purush kii guhya or prakat shaktiyaan kendribhoot hoti hai
 Wearing this fluid element in the vagina is like taking an injection of the essence of one's qualities
 yah nishchit he ki paapi or patit swabhaav ke vyakti hi vyabhichaari hote hai unka paap evam patan, praan satv veery ke saath stri ke atmik kshetra main vyaapt ho jaataa he or usamen bhi yah durgun bhar detaa he
 By the combination of so many adulterous men, having accumulated many types of faults in their astral bodies, the weak inner consciousness of the woman is greatly distorted
 ek myaan main anekon talwaar thunsane se bhayankar sthiti utpann hoti he
 In the same way, when a woman's qualities, deeds, temperaments and influences enter her body, they collide among themselves
 uskaa prabhaav manobhumi ko vikrut kar detaa he
 Adulterous women are not of a straight nature, they include irritability, annoyance, nervousness, excitement, instability, fainting, untruth, deceit, insatiableness etc
 The amount of pangs increases, headaches, constipation, pain, dryness, thirst, insomnia, tiredness, nightmares, Physical disorders like deodorant also start to increase, the presence of many men's lives in one body, such a number of painful results are present
 veshyavriti karne vaali striyon kaa saannnidhya aisa anishtakar hota he ki purush ko bade teevr jatke ke saath naarkeey yaatnaaon ke kund main dhakel detaa he
 Toxic chemical substances are formed by the gathering of many types of valor at one place
 jaise ghi or shahad amuk maatra main mila dene se hanikaarak rasayan ban jaati he vaise hi anek vyaktiyon ke shukr keet, yoni maarg main ekatrit hokar vish ban jate hai, yah vish sujak, atishak, jaise yoni rog utpann karata he
 When those diseases increase, then the men who come in contact with the woman feel the contagion of the men to other women, thus due to adultery, these devastating diseases arise and spread
 jiske peeche yah rog lag jate hai uskaa peechha mushkil se chhutata he
 This disease kills the patient by rotten and crying
 vyabhichaarini striyon kaa garbhashay dooshit ho jane ke kaaran yaa to unke santan hoti hi nahin, hoti bhi he to paitruk rogon ko lekar hoti he
 The sinful attitudes of parents definitely affect the child
 us santan main anek asuri durgun paye jate hai, vyabhichaar se utpann hui santan ko ‘varna shankar’ ke apmanjanak ghrinaaspad naam se shaastrakaron ne pukaara he
 The reason is that the parents' tendencies are embedded in that child
 aise baalkon kii abhivruddhi hona sansar ke liye abhishaap rup he
 Therefore, adultery is absolutely condemnable
 dharm kii drushti se to stri or purush donon ke liye hi vah ek samaan paap he parantu shaareerik drushti se striyon ke liye vah or bhi bura he kyonki striyon ke guhya ang main purush ke veery kii sthapana hoti he, isse unke upar anek prakaar ke shaareerik or maansik prabhaav vishesh rup se hote hai
 The man does not bear the woman's semen, so in some parts he has little physical harm
 yadi pati-patni main ekanishtha na ho, ve vyabhichaar main pravrutt hon to ghar kii aarthik dasha thik nahin rah sakati
 Both will be focused on their own selfish interests
 yadi pati vyabhichaari ho to duusari stri ko dhan dekar apane ashriton ko arth hin banaavega
 If the woman is an adulteress, she will secretly give the house money to her whenever she needs a jar husband
 yadi jaar pati se legi to use gupt rup se rakhegi, yaa fishan aadi main apvyay karegi
 The money received from adultery seems like a free one, it goes to wasteful expenditure
 veshyaayein itnaa dhan kamaati hai par yauvan dhalane par dusron kii muhtaaj hokar roti khaati hai
 Nothing can be deposited with them
 phijul kharchi kii aadat yadi stri yaa purush ek ko bhi ho to ghar kii aarthik vyavastha thik nahin rah sakati
 There will always be a dominance of poverty and lack of money; Economy and caution in small incomes in case of single-mindedness and intimacy of husband and wife does not bring economic hardship, but in spite of good income when there is fraud or laxity between the two
 Remains vyabhichaari vyaktiyon ko apane premi ko swechha purvak praapt karne kii suvidha nahin hoti, jab avasar bhi miltaa he to thode samay ke liye
 That too with apprehension, fear and hesitation
 aisi sthiti main tripti daayak sanyog sukh, kisi bhi prakaar nahin mil saktaa
 Pooja, this sign of married happiness, does not give satisfaction to either of them
 manovigyaan shaastra ke anusaar yah prakat he ki- atrupt sanyog mastishk sambandhi vikaar or maansik durgun utpann karata he
 Due to lack of desired satisfaction, adulterous people are worried about their beloved character
 virah dukh pate hai, avasar ke liye aatur rahete hai, ji kii jalan bujhane or premi ko aakarshith rakhane ke liye uski samiyata praapt karne kaa praytn karte hai
 In this type of efforts, all their attention is entangled
 har ghadi vahi fitur savaar rahata he, samay kaa adhikansh bhaag unheen baton main kharch ho jaataa he, falswaroop jivan ke anya aavashyak evam mahatvapurn kaam bigadate hai, adhure pade rahete hai, chhot jate hai
 In this mental excitement, the body dissolves day by day
 aise log beemaari or kamajori se grasit hokar alpaayu main hi kaal kavlit ho jate hai
 Due to incontinence, there is more ejaculation, due to the high expenditure of this life substance, many young men have been seen to end their life by falling prey to tapedic
 ek nishtha kaa bandhan shithil ho jane se samaaj kaa sanghathan bilkul nasht bhrasht ho jaayegaa
 Relationship of woman, child, mother, father etc
 will remain a transient contractual quantity
 swasthata, sundarata, swabhaav yaa dhan kii adhik maatra kaa jahaan avasar milegaa vahaan pehle sambandh ko chhodkar log duusare naye sambandh kii sthapana kiya karenge
 Then no man and woman will have faith in their partner
 sadaa yahi bhay laga rahegaa ki adhik acha avasar mila ki saathi pallaa chhodkar bhaaga
 In the midst of such fears, how can a strong family be established? The foundation of a strong family is the true friendship, unity and intimacy between the male and female, and can only happen if they are loyal to each other, sacrifice something for them
 is tyaag or vafadari kii praathmik pariksha-ekanishtha, vyabhichaar se bachanaa hi he
 Where there will be no seclusion - it is impossible to have true intimacy between those spouses
 asthir sashankit or prem rahit pariwaron kaa samaaj sansar ke saare saundarya kaa or maanav jati kii mahatta kaa naash hi kar degaa
 If adultery is not banned, one person will look at the other's house and the other's third house and there will be an atmosphere of unrest, instability and mistrust everywhere
 stri yaa purush kisi ko sachcha saathi na mil sakegaa
 By considering all these things, the importance of husband and wife is clear
 kaam seven ek manoranjak khel maatr nahin he
 It is a scientific process of soul exchange
 yah vah mahaan rasinic kriya he jiske dwaara do praanon kaa ekikaran hota he or us sanyog se naye praanon kii baalkon kii utpatti hoti he
 The purity of future children, public health, stability of society, family's dependence, etc
, have a very close relationship with the virtue of life's important problems
 isamen shithilataa aate hi itani dukhadaayi ulajhanein utpann ho jaati hai jinke saamne kaam seven kaa indriya sukh bilkul tuchh or upekshniya he
 The activities in which the collective interest of human society is rooted, are the religions, the works which cause collective harm, are sins
 chunki vyabhichaar se manushya jati ko samuhik haani he isliye vah tyajya he evam adharm he
 Readers should try to avoid adultery haalanki vivaahit purushon ke liye kam sajaa yaa phir ek tarah se chhot kaa praavdhaan he
 Adultery is considered very bad in India
 yadi koi stri yaa purush apni pati athwa patni ke alaava kisi anya se shareerik sambandh banaate hai to unhen bura samajha jaataa he

 sati daksh prajapati kii putree or bhagwaan shiv kii patni thi
 The story of their origin and end is available in different forms in different Puranas
 shaiva puraanon main bhagwaan shiv kii pradhanta ke kaaran shiv ko param tatva tathaa shakti ko unki anugamini bataaya gaya he
 Parallel to this, Shakti Puranas have described Shakti as the supreme power and Lord Shiva as his follower
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main apekshaakrit tatasth varnan he
 It talks about the birth of 16 girls from the womb of maternity, daughter of Daksha's self-styled manu
 devipurana main 14 kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he tathaa shivpurana main daksh kii saath kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he jinamein se 27 kaa vivaah chandramaa se hua tha
 There was also a sati among these girls
 shivpurana ke anusaar brahma ji ko bhagwaan shiv ke vivaah kii chintaa hui to unhone bhagwaan vishnu kii stuti kii or vishnu ji ne prasann hokar brahma ji ko bataaya ki yadi bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah karwaanaa he to devi shiva kii aradhana kiijie
 He told that he should ask Daksha to do penance of Bhagwati Shiva and appease him and ask for the boon of being his daughter
 yadi devi shiva prasann ho jaaegi to saare kaam safal ho jaaenge
 According to his statement, Brahma ji asked Daksha to do austerities of Bhagwati Shiva and Prajapati Daksha did severe penance of Goddess Shiva
 unki tapasya se prasann hokar shiva ne unhen vardaan diya ki main aap kii putree ke rup main janm luungi
 i am the maid of Lord Shiva in all births; Therefore, i will please Lord Shiva by doing austerities and become his wife
 saath hi unhone daksh se yah bhi kaha ki jab aapkaa aadar mere prati kam ho jayega tab usee samay main apane sharir ko tyaag duungi, apane swaroop main leen ho jaaongi athwa doosraa sharir dhaaran kar loongi
 He gave this boon to Daksha for every canto or kalpa
 tadnusaar bhagwati shiva sati ke naam se daksh kii putree ke rup main janm leti he or ghor tapasya karke bhagwaan shiv ko prasann karti he tathaa bhagwaan shiv se unka vivaah hota he
 The story after this is very much in line with the narrative described in the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana
 prayag main prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devatagan khadey hokar unhen aadar dete hai parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rah jate hai
 Due to his cosmic wisdom, considering Lord Shiva as his son, that is, like a son, Daksha feels insulted for not standing up to him and not showing respect to him and that is why he used many gimmicks towards Lord Shiva and offered him a sacrificial part Cursed to be deprived
 isi ke baad daksh or bhagwaan shiv main manomalinya utpann ho gaya
 Thereafter, a huge yajna was organized by Daksha in his capital Kankhal in which he neither invited Lord Shiva nor his daughter Sati
 sati ne rohinee ko chandramaa ke saath vimaan se jate dekha or sakhi ke dwaara yah pataa chalane par ki ve log unheen ke pita daksh ke viraat yajna main bhaag lene ja rahe hai, sati kaa man bhi vahaan jane ko vyakul ho gaya
 Despite the persuasion of Lord Shiva, Sati remained distraught and Lord Shiva with his ganas ordered him to go there
 parantu vahaan jaakar bhagwaan shiv kaa yajna-bhaag na dekhakar sati ne ghor aapatti jataayi or daksh ke dwaara apane tathaa unke pati bhagwaan shiv ke prati bhi ghor apmanjanak baaten kehane ke kaaran sati ne yogagni se apane sharir ko bhasma kar daalaa
 On being created by the Shivs, Bhrigu Rishi sacrificed in Dakshinagni and the deities named Ribhu, who were born out of it, drove the Shivgas
 is samachar se atyant kupit bhagwaan shiv ne apni jataa se virbhadra ko utpann kiya or virbhadra ne gana sahit jaakar daksh yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalaa; shiv ke virdohi devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand diya tathaa daksh ke sir ko kaat kar havan kunda main jala daalaa
 After this, Lord Shiva was pleased to be praised by Brahma ji along with the gods, and again he recovered the damages incurred in the yajna and due to burning of the head of Daksh, he also got the goat's head alive
 phir unke anugrah se yajna purna hua
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are all believed to have originated with the grace of Shakti due to the predominance of Shakti in Shaktism
 devipurana main varnan hua he ki purna prakruti jagdambika ne hi brahama, vishnu or mahesh teenon ko utpann kar unhen sristi kaaryon main niyukt kiya
 He was the one who ordered Brahma to be the creator, Vishnu to be the follower and Shiva as his destroyer
 aadesh-paalan ke purv in teenon ne un parama shakti purna prakruti ko hi apni patni ke rup main paane ke liye tap aarambh kar diya
 Due to Jagadambika failing in the test, Brahma and Vishnu attained full nature as a wife and being pleased with the penance of Lord Shiva, Jagdambika herself gave birth and assured to become his wife
 tadnusaar brahma ji ke dwaara prerit kiye jane par daksh ne usee purna prakruti jagdambika kii tapasya kii or unke tap se prasann hokar jagdambika ne unki putree hokar janm lene kaa vardaan diya tathaa yah bhi bataa diya ki jab daksh kaa punya ksheen ho jayega tab vah shakti jagat ko vimohit karke apane dham ko laut jaaegi
 According to the boon, Purna Prakriti took birth as Daksha's daughter in the name of Sati and when she was eligible to marry, Daksha contemplated her marriage
 daksh apni loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ke prabhaav ko na samajhane ke kaaran unke vesh ko amaryadit maanate the or unhen kisi prakaar sati ke yogya var nahin maanate the
 Therefore, considering this, he organized a zero swayamvar meeting with Lord Shiva and requested Sati to choose the groom according to his choice
 bhagwaan shiv ko upasthit na dekh kar sati ne 'shivaay namah' kah kar varmala prithvi par daal di tathaa maheshwar shiv swayan upasthit hokar us varmala ko grahan kar sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash laut gayi
 Daksha was very sad
 apni ichha ke viruddh sati ke dwaara shiv ko pati chun liye jane se daksh kaa man un donon ke prati kshobh se bhar gaya
 That is why Daksha did not invite Shiva and Sati in the Virat Yajna organized in his capital later
 phir bhi sati ne apane pita ke yajna main jane kaa hath kiya or shiv ji ke dwaara baar-baar rokane par atyant kupit hokar unhen apana bhayanak rup dikhaaya
 This describes Shiva's escape after being horrified and Jagdambika took 10 forms to stop him
 phir shivaji ke poochne par unhone apane dashon roopon kaa parichay diya
 Then after Shiv ji's apology, Purna Prakriti smiled and was eager to go to the yagna of her father Daksha, then Shiv ji told her sorrow and ordered a chariot attached to the majority of lions and got Bhagwati sent to Bhagwati's house with respect
 shesh katha katipay antaron ke saath purvavarnit katha ke praayah anuroop hi he, parantu is katha main kupit sati chhayasati ko lila kaa aadesh dekar antardhan ho jaati he or us chhayasati ke bhasma ho jane par baat khatm nahin hoti balki shiv ke prasann hokar yajna purnataa kaa sanket de dene ke baad chhayasati kii laash surakshit tathaa dedeepyaman rup main daksh kii yajyashala main hi punah mil jaati he or phir devi shakti dwaara purv main hi bhavishyavaanee rup main bataa die jane ke baavjood loukik purush kii tarah shivaji vilaap karte hai tathaa sati kii laash sir par dhaaran kar veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai
 With this, Lord Vishnu cuts the corpse of Sati from the Sudarshan Chakra, in succession, to break the stricken deities and take care of the situation
 is prakaar sati ke vibhinn ang tathaa aabhushanon ke vibhinn sthanon par girane se ve sthaan shaktipeeth kii mahima se yukt ho gayi
 In this way 51 Shaktipeeths were constructed
 phir sati kii laash na rah jane par bhagavan shiv ne jab vyakulatapurvak devataaon se prashn kiya to devataaon ne unhen sari baat bataayi
 Relinquishing this, Lord Shiva cursed Lord Vishnu by incarnating him in the Suryavansha in the Treta Yuga to separate from his wife and then worshiped Bhagwati in 51 Shaktipeeths in the most prominent 'kamarupa' and by that perfect nature The next time, in the Himalayan house, Parvati received the boon of becoming his wife again by taking Purnavatar
 is prakaar yahi sati agle janm main parvati ke rup main himalay kii putree banakar punah bhagwaan shiv ko patni rup main praapt ho gayi

 newton ke hi samakaleen german vidwaan hygange ne,san 1678 i
 main 'prakaash kaa tarang siddhanth' kaa pratipaadan kiya tha
 According to this, ether is a very light and mysterious substance in the whole world: in the vast emptiness between the stars and inside the solid matter and also in the interior of atoms
 prakaash isi ishwar samudr main atyant choti lambaaiwali pratyasth tarangen hai
 Waves of red light are the longest and violet the shortest
 isse vyatikaran or virvatan kii vyakhya to saralata se ho gai, kyonki ye ghatnaayen to tarangamulak hi hen
 The events of polarization also showed that the waves are transverse, not longitudinal
 hygange kii tarangikaaon ko pariklpana se aparvatan or paravartan tathaa donon kaa yogapaty bhi acchhee tarah samaj main aa gaya
 But now there are two difficulties
 ek to saral rekha gaman kii vyakhya na ho saki
 Secondly, it was not understood why the speed of the planets and satellites was not reduced even by the speed of the eighth years due to the rubbing of the ether
 inase bhi adhik kathinaayee yah thi ki newton jaise mahan vaigyanik kaa virodh karne kaa saahas or samarthy kisi main na tha
 Hence, for almost two centuries, the kingdom of Kanikasiddhanta remained intact
 san 1807 main yang ne vyatikaran kaa prayog atyant suspasht rup main kar dikhaaya
 After this, Fennel also gave a very good explanation of simple line movement by waves
 1850 i
 main phuko ne pratyaksh naap se yah bhi pramanit kar diya ki jal jaise adhik ghantvawale madhyamon main prakashveg vaayu kii apeksha kam hota he
 Due to the adverse and conducive of wave theory, wave theory became universally accepted
 iske baad to is siddhant ke dwaara anek naveen or ascharyajanak ghatnaon kii praguktiyaan bhi prekshan dwaara satya pramanit hui
 Now the question is what kind of substance is ether
 yah vidit he ki kisi bhi pratyasth drav main Where yadi tarang anudairdhya he to v = / p) 1 / 2 -- If the wave is transverse then v = 1 / 2 - sansar main koi bhi dravya aisa gyaat nahin he jisaki pratyasthata tathaa ghanatv ke maan aise hon ki uski tarang kaa veg prakaash ke gyaat veg 3 x 108me
 prati second ho sake
 Therefore, the medium of light wave cannot be matter
 vah koi vilakshan padaarth he or in tarangon kii anuprasthata ke kaaran yah bhi nirvivaad he ki ether koi thos athwa jelly ke sadrush ardhthos padaarth he, kyonki dravon or gaison main dridhtaa ke abhaav ke kaaran anuprastha tarang chal hi nahin sakati
 Apart from this, we have not detected any longitudinal waves of light
 at: sambhavat: aisi tarangon kaa veg anant hota he, arthath sameekaran ke anusaar ether kaa k = anant he or ether anspidya he
 However, the velocity of the planets is not affected by this solid and incompressible material
 is kathinaayee kaa samaadhaan kelvin ne yah kiya ki ether kaa ghantv p or dridhtaa n donon hi atyant kam hai, kintu unka anupaat aisa he ki sameekaran ke anusaar tarang veg 3 x 108 me
 prati second ho jaataa he
 The following three theories were made regarding the different velocities of light in different transparent materials: frenel kaa siddhant : sab dravyon main ether kii pratyasthata, k baraabar hoti he, kintu uske ghanatv p, main fark hota he
 Macula's theory: The density of ether in all liquids is equal, but there is a difference in elasticity
 keliun kaa siddhant : anudairdhya tarang kaa veg anant ke sthaan main 0 mana gaya
 As a result, the equation k + 4 / 3n = 0, ie k = - 4 / 3n
 This means that k of the ether is negative
 vah asampidya nahin, kintu sankuchansheel he
 To reduce its volume, pressure does not have to be increased on it, rather it has to happen
 kintu in teenon main se ek bhi siddhant prekshan kii kasuti par thik na utraa
 It is true that Frennel derived from his theory the well-known formulas regarding the intensity of rays refracted and reflected by transparent materials, which have been proved true by observation
 kintu aisa ek galati ke kaaran hua tha, jo saubhagyavash unhone kar di thi
 When Green tried to rectify that mistake, the results were absolutely untrue

 aadhunik gujarat rajya kaa naam gurjar jati ke naam par padaa hai
 The word Gujarat originates from the word Gurjatra which means - those which are under the control of Gurjars
 gujarat se pehle yah kshetra laat, saurashtra or kathiyawad ke naam se janaa jaataa tha| The chronology of the Gujjars of Bhadoch is as follows sabase pehle gurjar jati ne chhathi shatabdi ke ant main aadhunik gujarat ke dakshini ilaake main ek rajya kii sthapana kii
 Hen Song has named this state as Bhadoch
 bharuch ke gurjaron ke vishay main hamen dakshini gujarat se praapt nau tatkaaleen tamrapatron se chalata hai
 In these Tamrapatras, he described himself to be of Gurjar Nrupati dynasty
 is rajya kaa kendra narmada or maahi nadi ke bich sthit aadhunik bharuch jila tha, haalaaki apane utkarsh kaal main yah rajya uttar main kheda jile tak tathaa dakshin main tapti nadi tak failaa tha
 According to Gauri Shankar Ojha, this state should have the areas of Bhadoch district, Orpad 'chorasi' and Surat Baluke in Surat district, the surrounding areas of Badoda, Rewa Kantha and Sachin
 The capital of this state was Nandipuri
 Two miles north of the eastern gate of Bhadoch is a fort called Nandipuri, identified by Dr
 Buhler as Nandipuri inscribed in Tamrapatro
 kuch itihaaskaar bharuch se 36 mile dur, narmada ke kathe main sthit, nador ko nandipuri maanate hai
 At that time, Bhadoch was the most important port and trade center on the west coast of India
 bharuch bandargah se arab or europea rajyon se vyapaar kiya jaataa tha| It is not known from which clan the Gujjars of Bhadoch belonged
 sambhawatah armbh main ve bhinmaal ke chap gurjar rajaao ke samant the
 It is also possible that they are a branch of the Chap dynasty Gurjars of Bhinmal
 bhinmaal ke gurjaron ki tarah bharuch ke gurjar bhi surya ke upaask the
 There is evidence of the existence of a Gurjar kingdom in modern Rajasthan soon after the fall of the Hun Empire in India
 , is gurjar rajya kii rajdhani bhinmaal thi| tatkaaleen grantho main rajasthan ko us samay gurjar desh kaha gaya hai
 Hein Song has also described Gurjar "qi-chi-lo" as the second largest state in Western India in his book "siu Ki"
 pracheen bharat ke prakhyat ganitagya brahmagupta kii pustak brahmasphut siddhant ke anusaar 628 i
 main shri chap vansh kaa vyaghramukh naamak raja bhinmaal main shashan kar rahaa tha
 Possibly a reason for the expansion of Gujjars from the Gurjar country towards Bhadoch in the south-east was to take over the foreign trade route
 baad main bharuch ke gurjar sambhawatah vallabhi ke maitra vansh ke aadhin ho gaye| bhagwaan ji laal indra aadi itihaaskaaron ne maitra vansh ko bhi hun-gurjar samooh kaa mana hai
 According to Lord Lal Indra, Gurjars from Bhinmal came to Bhadoch via Malwa, leaving a branch and reached Gujarat where they established the Vallabhi kingdom under the leadership of Maitraka dynasty
 ‘maitra’ irani mul ke shabd mihr / ‘mihir’ kaa bhartiya roopantaran hai, jiskaa arth hai – surya| mihir shabd kaa hun-gurjar samooh ke itihaas se gaharaa naata hai
 Hun was a worshiper of 'varah' and 'mihir'
 ‘mihir’ hunon kaa doosraa naam bhi hai
 'mihir' is also the title of Hun and Gurjars
 hun samraat ‘gul’ or gurjar samraat ‘bhoj’ donon kii oopaadhi ‘mihir’ thi tathaa ve mihir gul or mihir bhoj ke rup main jane jate hai
 Mihir Ajmer's Gurjars still hold a title
 is baat ke shashakt pramaan hai ki bharuch ke gurjaron or vallabhi ke maitrako ke abhinn sambandh the
 The Maitraks of Vallabhi established control over seaside foreign trade with the help of the Gurjars of Bhadoch and the Chavados of bet-dwarka, Diu, patan-somnath etc
 vallabhi ke maitrako ke baad bharuch ke gurjar vaatapi ke chalukyo ke bhi samant rahe the
 The most powerful king of the Gurjara dynasty of Bhadoch was Dadda II
 uske dwaara jari kiye gaye tamrapatro se pataa chalata hai ki vah surya kaa upaask tha
 It is also known from one of his copper sheets that he protected the king of Vallabhi, defeated by the lord Harshavardhana of North India
 Pulakeshi II, the then Chalukya ruler of Vatapi, also claims to have defeated Harshavardhana in the Kacharo of Narmada in the Aihole inscription
 ve
 e
 smith ne vaatapi ke chalukyo ko gurjar mana hai
 Hornley has described them as Gurjars of Hoon origin
 atah aisa prathit hota hai ki harshavardhan kaa yuddh hun-gurjar samooh ke tino rajwansho kaa ek parisangh se hua tha, jisame armbh main vallabhi kshetra main use safalataa mili, kintu narmada ke tat par lade gaye yuddh main vah dadda II evam pulkeshi II se parajeet ho gaya
 After Dadda II, the rulers of this dynasty came under the influence of Brahmin culture
 Due to which their tribal identity started emphasizing the identity of Kshatriya varna in place of Gurjar and now they adopted Shaivism in place of Surya Puja
 dadda III is parivaar kaa pehla shaiva tha
 Dadda III studied Manu Smriti and strictly applied Varnashrama Dharma to his kingdom
 is vansh ke antim shaasha jai bhat III dwaara zaari kiya gaya ek tamrapatr navsari se praapt hua hai, jiske anusaar usne bharat prasiddh karn ko apana aadi purvaj bataaya hai
 Probably originally the Gurjars, worshipers of Surya 'mihir', began to associate themselves with the mythical hero Surya-son Karna to increase their status in Indian society
 734 i ke baad hame bharuch ke gurjaron ke vishay main kuch pataa nahin chalata
 The reason for the end of this dynasty's rule is the Arab invasion or the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the south
 bharuch ke gurjaron ke shashan ke samay aadhunik gujarat kii jansankhya main gurjar tatv kaa samavesh se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But till now no part of modern Gujarat was named Gujarat

 Small formulas have been given in Nirukta to make meaning of words

 kashikavriti ke anusaar nirukt paanch prakaar kaa hota he— varnagam varnaviparyay, varnadhikaar, naash or dhaatu ke kisi ek arth ko sidb karnaa
 In this treatise Yask has mentioned the views and opinions of Shaktayan, Gargya, Shakpuni Muni's word-etymology and has given his views on it
 vartmaan uplabdh nirukt, nighantu kii vyakhya he or vah yask rachit he
 Yasak's contribution is so great that he is also called Niruktakar or Nirukrita and Niruktavat
 yask ne apane nirukt main purvavarti niruktkaar ke rup main aupmanyav, autumbarayan, vashryamani; gargy, agrayan, shakpuni, aurnanabh, tetiki, gaalav, sthaulashthivi, kaunshtuki or katthakya ke naam uddhrut kiye hai

 Such an esoteric idea on the word scripture is not seen anywhere else in ancient times
 shabdashastra par anek mat prachlit the iskaa pataa yask ke nirukt se lagata he
 Some people were of the opinion that all words are metallic and metals are mere verbs in which different words are formed by adding suffixes etc
 is mat ke virodhiyon kaa kahana tha ki kuch shabd dhaaturup kriyaapadon se banate he par sab nahin, kyonki yadi 'ashan' se ashv mana jaay to pratruek chalane yaa aage badhanevaala padaarth ashv kehalaayegaa
 Yask has denied this opposing view
 yask muni ne iske uttar main kaha he ki jab ek kriya se ek padaarth kaa naam pad jaataa he tab vahi kriya karanevaale or padaarth ko vah naam nahin diya jaataa
 Another opposition of the other side was that if the names are given in this way, then any substance has as many properties as it should have
 yask isapar kehete he ki ek padaarth kisi ek gun yaa karm se ek naam ko dhaaran karata he

 nirukt main shabdon ke mul kaa varnan he, yani kis bhaavana ke kaaran ghode ko ashv kaha jaataa he iskaa varnan he
 Whereas the grammar describes the feeling emanating from the original words of Ashvaruddha
 nirukt main chunki mulon kaa varnan he, atah jin shabdon kaa varnan he vah chote hai, jabaki vyakaran main lambe shabdon or vaakyon kaa bhi varnan he, kyonki vyakaran sandhi-samaas-alankaar aadi kaa vivechan karata he

 In fact, Mokshagaman is the ultimate faith in the contemplation of Jain philosophy, which should result in every heart

 da
 avasthi ne mukhyatah apane saahityalochan dwaara sahitya kii anek vidhaon ko newnaadhik matraaon main, par moolyavaan dhang se samrudh kiya he -- aalochana, rang-samiksha, kavita, naatak, prahasan, kahani, reportaj, patr, diary aadi kuch bhi unase achhuti nahin rahi he
 During Awasthi's lifetime, only one original book was published
 shesh kritiyaan unke nidhanoparant unki patni kamalesh avasthi ji ke praytn se prakashit ho paayin
 The list of his original and edited works is as follows: - 1

 He has also rejected the demand for creative imperatives of symbols, images etc
 like poetry by Ramswaroop Chaturvedi
 unka spasht uddeshy kahani-samiksha kii swatantra paddati viksit karne kaa tha jo puraa nahin ho paaya parantu unke kathan se unka mantavy spasht pratibimbit ho jaataa he -- "kathakriti kii puri samaj yaa vyakhya ke liye us jivan kii gaharaai kii maap aavashyak he jahaan se lekhak kii kala-drushti udit hoti he
 That is why the analysis of character-building ability, plot-structure-power, etc
, not symbols or images, is important for narrative review rather than language criterion for recidivism or authenticity of experience

 is nadi main paapi praani marane ke baad rote hue girte hai or bhayankar jeev jantuon dwaara danshi evam trasit hokar rote rahete hai
 It is considered extremely difficult for sinners to go beyond this
 yamalok main sthit is nadi ko paar karne ke liye dharamshastra main kuch upaay bhi kahe gaye hai
 In the Mahabharata, it is also reported that when the Bhagirathi Ganga flows into Pitralok, it is called Vaitarani
 'baitarani' naam kii ek bhautik nadi bharat ke odisha rajya main he jo balasore jila or katak jila kii seemaa banaati he
