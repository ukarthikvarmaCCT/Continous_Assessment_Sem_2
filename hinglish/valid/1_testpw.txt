 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it

 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country

 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai

 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, British officials had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different types of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human

 Fuel tax can work as an incentive for more efficient production, so for lower pollution, car design and development of alternative fuels
 High fuel tax encourages buyers to make lighter, smaller and more fuel efficient cars, Or do not run a Fee car
 Generally, today's automobile can be rebuilt 75 percent and using recycled steel we can use the car to reduce energy usage and pollution
 In the United States, Congress made Faderahalli mandatory fuel efficiency, which was regularly debated, although passenger car standards could not be improved more than what the standard was made in 1985
 Light truck standards have also changed very quickly and were reported in 2007
 Alternative fuel vehicles are another option that is less polluting than conventional petroleum-driven vehicles

 If the place is not completely surrounded, but its face is always open to come from the sea, then the name 'basin' is more suitable for it, although the name is not universal
 godiyon ke mukh par phatak yaa kothiyaan lagi hoti hai, jisase unamem yathechh tal tak pani rakhaa ja sake
 The dock in which the water usually stays up to the same floor is called the Sajal dock and the dock from which the water can be emptied completely is called the 'dry dock'
 sukhi godi main jahaaj nirikshan karne yaa marammat karne ke liye laae jate hai
 One form of dry dock is 'tirati Docki'
 yah tairte hue bade bade pipon kii sanrachana hoti he, jo bheetar pani bharkar, yaa khaali karke, nichi yaa unchi kii ja sakati he or jahaaj usapar rakhkar pani ke upar uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Ports that have a naturally safe and deeply massive basin, low tide and no strong currents in the sea, do not require a prostitute dock, such as in New York
 kintu sukhi yaa tirti godi sabhi bade aadhunik pattanon kaa anivaary ang hoti he
 There is a natural or deep dug-out subdivision on the seashore or riverbank, on the banks of which paved ghats or platforms are made for loading or unloading goods in ships

 And if the water entering the water is made perpendicular or at any other angle, then it is called Paia
 ghat, dhakke yaa paae sajal godi ke mukhya ang hai
 Sometimes the sloping ghats are also built, which can be high and low along the tide
 ye chal pulon dwaara achal ghaaton se jude rahete hai
 Dock walls are made very strong
 ye praaia: dhan kancreet kii, akhand kancreet kii, sampidit vaayu dwaara galaai gai kothiyon kii, prabalit kancreet main pendayukta dholon kii, yaa sthunon, dholon aadi kii mishrit deevaaren hoti hai
 On top of these, there is definitely a title of granite
 aajkal jahaaj praaia: baxnuma banate hai
 Their walls stand upright or sometimes lean upwards
 isliye ghat kii deevaaren saamne kii ore bilkul khadi yaa lagbhag khadi banaai jaati hai, taaki jahaaj ghat ke bilkul paas tak aa saken or naubhaar chadhaane utaaranevaali crenon kii pahunch ke bheetar ho sake
 The walls are made of flowers, whose back surface is sloping or terraced
 inaki niven kaaphi chaudee hoti hai, taaki neeche mitti par uski kshamta se adhik bhaar na pade
 The foundation is also laid some sloping at the back, so that the pressure of the filling does not slide towards the wall
 diwaar ke achal bhaar tathaa peeche kii bharaai kii thel kaa dhyaan rakhkar deevaaron kaa abhikalpan kiya jaataa he
 Their average thickness is not less than a quarter of the height, often a third is laid

 Dock gates are of wood or steel
 harithhrut, jarrah, yaa anya baari or kathor lakdi inamen lagaai jaati he
 Brackish water has a bad effect on iron and if it is mixed with sewage, then more

 jahaan unche jowar bhaate aayaa karte hai, vahaan kabhi kabhi unka laabh uthaakar jowar ke samay jahaaj andar le aate hai or bhaate ke baad phatak band kar dete hai
 Thus there is no need to drain water by pump
 jahaajon ke nirmaan, nirikshan or marammat aadi ke liye sukhi godiyaan sabhi jagah aavashyak samajhi jaati hai or inke abhikalp ke samay bhavi vistaar kii gunjaaish bhi rakhi jaati he
 The usefulness of a dry dock is judged in terms of how long a ship can come
 bombai kii godi, jo san 1914 main chaalu hui, 1,000 foot lambii, 100 foot chaudee or 34 foot 9 inch gahari he
 It was the second in the world's dock at that time
 iske pehle hi san 1913 main, liverpool kii 1,050 foot 4 inch lambii, 12 foot chaudee or 43 foot 11 inch gahari, gladston godi taiyaar ho chuki thi
 Now the 1,212-foot-6-inch long, 148-foot-wide and 45-foot deep dry dock of Cape Town, commissioned in 1945, is the largest in the world
 tirti godiyon ko uthaane kii samarthy 300 ton se 1,00,000 ton tak hoti he
 The Campbell design was very prevalent before the Second World War, according to which a 60,000-tonne sloping dock was built to accommodate the largest Atlantic liners and warships in Sadhampton
 baad main to or bhi badi badi godiyon kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav hua
 The 54,000-tonne 'admiralty Tilti Dock of Portsmith is 859 feet 6 inches long and 129 feet 6 inches wide inside
 yah pani main 38 foot doobnevaala jahaaj uthaa sakati he
 The 50,000-tonne 857-foot 8-inch-long, 126-foot-6-inch-wide and 40-foot-deep dock was built in Bombay in 1947 to replace the Singapore dock destroyed by Bamnavarsha in World War II in 1947, which later reached Malta
 Has gone
 tirti godiyaan badi saralata or teji se taiyaar kii ja sakati hai, sthanantarit kii ja sakati hai or sthitvishesh ke anukool dhaali ja sakati hai
 Therefore, they are more valuable than dry dock for emergency repair of ships
 kintu lohe yaa ispaat kii hone ke kaaran ye 30-40 varsh se adhik nahin chalatin
 They also need safe space and more depth
 jahaan 500 foot lambey, 55 foot chaude or 28 foot duubakar chalanevaale jahaaj ke liye 520 foot lambii, 60 foot chaudee or 30 foot gahari sukhi godi paryaapt hogi, vahaan tirti godi jahaaj ke neeche jane ke liye 20 foot gaharaai or legi; or yadi 15-20 foot unchaa jowar bhaata aata he, to tirti godi ke liye lagbhag 70 foot gaharaa pani chahie
 If the natural depth is not so much, then so much will have to be done by dredging
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main yah kathin hi nahin, praaia: asambhav he
 Yes, the length of the sloping dock is not mandatory to be more than the width of the ship, only its lifting capacity should be greater than the weight of the ship
 tirti godiyaan kai prakaar kii hoti hai
 Some have both more walls, some have only one more
 donon or diwarwali godiyon main bakse jaisi, kabla-yojya khandonwali or peepa khandon vaali godiyon kaa bahut prachlan he

 First built for the Spanish government of Havana, the Havana-type dock consists of two steep walls, between which the caskets are attached to the cables
 inamen se koi bhi peepa nikaalkar shesh ke upar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 This type is now ancient

 The offshore dock was patented in 1884 AD
 isaki diwaar tat ke ke saath kabje lage gadanron dwaara judi hoti he
 The dock is in two sections and one section can be placed on top of the other

 isamen diwaar to lambii hoti he, kintu neeche pipon ke bich bich jagah rahati he, arthath diwaar main peepe is prakaar lage hote hai jaise haath main ungliyaan
 Ships mounted on these casks can be placed on the coast of the burrows built on the coast and the dock can be emptied
 yah bhi do khandon main hoti he, jo ek duusare ke upar rakhe ja sakate hai
 For stability, these segments are connected to a sloping ulari, or stoplever, by parallel punishments attached to the hinge
 ye pot parivahan ke liye atyant aavashyak hai
 Modern ports must have adequate arrangements for them
 inkaa uddeshy yah he ki samudr se aasaani se pot aa ja saken, unhen paryaapt tathaa surakshit ghat mili, naubhaar teji se chadhaane utaarne kii suvidha ho, ghaaton par naubhaar laane or vahaan se le jane kii tathaa aavashyaktaa ho to use godaam main rakhane kii, samuchit vyavastha ho
 By improving these facilities, often a lot of expenses incurred in the expansion of the docks can be saved

 Elsewhere, goods are unloaded directly on trains, or loaded into other trains
 kahin par bade jahaajon se maal chote jahaajon par utaar liya jaataa he
 Somewhere both these methods are adopted
 saamaanya naubhaar ke liye praaia: prayek nikaas sthal par teen teen ton ke ek ek dock kraine lagaae jate hai
 The average weight of most bundles is usually 30 hunderweight
 isse baari boj uthaane ke liye 10 se 20 ton kshamtawale tirte kraine kaa prayog karnaa acha rahata he
 The system of lifting about 2,000 tonnes of normal cargo per day is considered good

 The Sunnis believe that according to Sanaah the true political successor of the Prophet should be chosen on the basis of the Shura, as was done in Saqifa, who would have chosen the successor of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab's father-in-law Abu Bakr, who was elected the Shia, on the other hand
 That Hazrat Muhammad Sahab appointed his son-in-law Hazrat Ali ibn Abi Talib as his real political and religious heir

 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a location
 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 a significant portion of phenotypic variation in the population is due to genotypic variation
 aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan is anuvaanshik vividhta main samay ke saath parivartan ke rup main vikaas ko paribhaashit karata he
 The frequency of a particular allele will become more or less prevalent to other variants of that gene

 The frequencies of alleles will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift
 vividhta jinom main utparivartan se aati he, jansankhya ke bich yon prajnan or pravaas ke madhyam se jin ke pherbadal
 Despite the continuous introduction of new variations through mutation and gene flow, most genomes of a species are the same in all individuals of that species
 haalanki, ginotip main apekshaakrit chote antar bhi phenotip main naatakeey antar paidaa kar sakate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, chimpanji or insaan apane jeenomon main se lagbhag 5% main antar karte hai
 Main article: Mutation ek gunasutra ke hisse kaa doharaavamuteshan koshika ke jinom ke diene anukram main parivartan hai
 When mutations occur, they can alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect
 udo drosophila melenogaster main padhai ke aadhaar par, yah suzav diya gaya he ki yadi koi jin jin dwaara nirmit protein main parivartan karata he, to yah sambhawatah hanikaarak hoga, inamen se lagbhag 70% muteshan hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he, or shesh tatasth yaa kamjor rup se laabhakaari
 Mutations can involve repeating large sections of a chromosome, which may introduce additional copies of a gene into the genome
 jin kii atirikt pratiyaan viksit karne ke liye nae jeenon ke liye aavashyak kachche maal kaa ek pramukh strot hai
 This is important because most genes evolve from pre-existing genes into gene families, which share common ancestors
 udhaaharan ke liye, maanviya aankh un sanrachanaon ko banane ke liye chaar jin kaa upyog karata he jo prakaash ko samajhate hai: rang drushti ke liye teen or raat drushti ke liye ek; sabhi chaar ek ekal paitruk jin se utarate hai
 When a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function, a new gene can be generated from the tribal gene
 ek baar jin ko doharaaya gaya he, kyonki yah pranali kii atirek bad jaati he, yah prakriya aasaan ho jaati he; jodi main ek jin ek nayaa samaaroh praapt kar sakati he jabaki duusari prati iske mul kaary ko jari rakhti he
 Other types of mutations may generate entirely new genes from previously non-coding DNA
 nae jeenon kii peedi bhi kai jeenon ke chote hisse ko doharaaya ja saktaa he, in tukdon ke saath nae kaaryon ke saath nae sangyojan banane ke liye pun: sangyojan kiya ja saktaa he
 When new genes are assembled by manipulating pre-existing parts, the domain acts as a module with simple independent functions, which can be combined with new and complex functions to produce new combinations
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, policted sinthasis bade anzime hote hai jo antibiotics banaate hai; ve ek sau swatantra domen tak hote hai jo prayek ek samgr prakriya main ek kadam uthte hai, jaise ek vidhansabha line main ek kadam More information: Sexual reproduction, genetic recombination, and development of sexual reproduction In homosexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or linked, because they cannot be mixed with genes of other organisms during reproduction
 iske vipareet, yon jeevon ke santanon main unke mata-pita ke gunasutron ke swatantra mishran ke madhyam se utpann hote hai
 According to a related process called recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matched chromosomes
 punarsangyojan or punarsanrachana elle aavritiyon ko badalati nahin he, balki alils ke nae sanyojanon ke saath santanon ko janm dene vaale elils ek duusare ke saath jude hue hai
 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not in its lineage; It is most common in bacteria
 dawa main, yah antibiotic pratirodh ke prasar main yogadan detaa he, jaise jab ek bacteria pratirodh jin kaa adhigrahan karata he, to yah unhen anya prajatiyon main teji se sthanantarit kar saktaa he
 Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria such as yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred

 Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing the transfer of genes into biological domains as well
 chloroplasts or mitochondriya ke adhigrahan ke dauraan, eukeriotic koshikaon or bacteria ke purvajon ke bich bade paimaane par jin transfar bhi hua he
 It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene translocation between bacteria and Archaea
 gaharaa rang ke saath aabaadi main prakritik chayan parinaamon ke baad utparivartan
 From a neo-darwinian perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interracial organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, patangon kii aabaadi main kaale rang ke liye aleble adhik saamaanya ho jate hai tantron jo elil aavritiyon main badlaav laa saktaa he, main prakritik chayan, anuvanshik bahaav, anuvanshik hichhiking, utparivartan or jin pravaah shaamil hai
 Main article: Natural selection natural sellection ke madhyam se vikaas prakriya he jiske dwaara jansankhya kii lagaataar pidiyon main astitv main vruddhi or prajnan adhik saamaanya ho jate hai
 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically
 paristhitiki tantra ke sansthaapak ujin odum ne ek paristhitiki tantra ko paribhaashit kiya he: "kisi bhi ikai main sabhi jeevon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he

 This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to characterize specific forces that, together, include natural selection
 prakritik chayan sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kaary kar saktaa he, jaise ki jin, koshika, vyaktigat jeev, jeevon or prajatiyon ke samooh
 Selection can work at multiple levels simultaneously
 vyaktigat jeev ke str ke neeche hone vaale chayan kaa ek udhaaharan transporens naamak jin he, jo ek jinom main dohraane or fail saktaa he

 vartmaan prajatiyaan vikaas kii prakriya main ek charan hai, unki vividhta ke saath prajati or vilupt hone kii ghatnaon kii lambii shrinkhalaa kaa utpaada he
 The common ancestry of organisms is first inferred from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation
 doosraa, jivan kii vividhta puri tarah se anuthe jeevon kaa ek set nahin he, parantu aise jeev hai, jo roopaatmak samanthaayen saajha karte hai
 Third, implicit traits with no explicit purpose are similar to functional ancestral traits and, finally, the use of these similarities can be classified into a category of nested groups — similar to a family tree

 In his recent works Hema has introduced an additional layer in his works as a sculptural element
 The artist repeatedly uses patterned surfaces that use symbols of Indian spirituality and elements of traditional clothing design
 Hema's blending of her images with these surfaces aims to shed light on the themes of migration and displacement in South Asia, as well as reflect the existential plight of an artist as a solo creator
 His use of cinematography and depiction of elements such as smoke give the impression of claws of destruction; This topic becomes even more clear from its title Killing Site

 Through Greek texts from the Greeks, many nations of Europe, Asia and Africa learned this discipline and became popular everywhere
 unani-roosi-samskruti ke haas ke pashchaat gyaan or vidya ke saath vaidyak kii dharohar bhi musalamaanon ke haath main ai jinhone ise balakh, bokhaara, turkistan, china or bharat se lekar andlus tak failaayaa
 In the early period of Islam, although its guardians were Muslims, it remained in the hands of other castes
 lagbhag dedh sau varsho tak unani chikitsa paddati ko isai, yahudee, tarapujak, irani, kuldani, misri or surayani aadi vibhinn bhashabhashi jatiyaan jaananevaali thim
 When these texts were translated into Arabic, the Muslims began to learn this discipline, then many world-renowned, like Raji and Sheikh emerged
 unani chikitsa ke aadharbhoot siddhant nimnlikhit he: Ilmetib is the scripture which gives knowledge of healthy and unhealthy states of human body and this scripture explains how health can be protected and how can disease be prevented in the condition of disease
 manushya kaa swasthya un tatwon kii prakritik or aprakritik sthiti par nirbhar karata he jinase maanav sharir bana he
 These elements are called Umur Mukbwema, or Azazai Mukwavema, a Greek physician
 manushya kaa astitv inhin tatwon par nirbhar he
 As long as these elements remain in their natural state, the human body performs its work regularly
 isi kaa naam swasthya he
 The origin of human nature depends on these basic elements, if there is not one of these elements, then the condition of human body will become impossible
 umoor tabiiyya ko hi ayurveda main dosha-dhaatumal-vigyaan or allopathy main phiziology kehete hai
 Umur Tabiyya consists of seven elements: ye hi sharir ke kool ghatak, yaa upadan he jinase manushya bana he
 Ilm is the representation of these substances in Manafedlaja
 unaniyon ne sharir ke sanghatnkaaree samast padaartho ko do pradhan bhaagon, dravyabhoot or adravyabhoot, main baanta he adravyabhoot ghatak dravya nahin he
 This is their property from the shelter of liquid components
 inhen chhod dene par dravyabhoot ghatak keval chaar thaharte hai, jinamein arkan dravyibhoot ghatakon ke bhi nirmaayak moolbhoot tatv hai
 On leaving it, only three liquid components, Akhalat, Aza and Arwah are left
 unaniyon ne sharir ke samast sanghatnkaaree tatwon ko swaroop kii drushti se teen virgo main baanta he: Shaykhurais has given a detailed account of all the outstanding subjects of the Greek physician and his organ suffixes in the early chapters of his well-known treatise, Al Law
 is granth main yah bhi batayaya gaya hai ki hakim ko kin kin bishyon ko kitna jaananaa aavashyak hai tathaa kin bishyon main pratyaksh, anubhav evam pareekshan apekshit hai
 The second crop of Sheikh Sir Kulliyat's law is the form in Moujat Tib: 'chookin unani vaidyak shaastra swasthya or aswasthya kii drushti se maanav sharir kaa nirupan karata hai or prayek vastu kaa gyaan usee samay purnataya praapt kar liya jaay, basharte ki us vastu ke kaaran kaa hon, iske liye yah aavashyak hai ki unani vaidyak shaastra main swasthya or aswasthya ke hetu, unke kaaran gyaat kiye jaae
 Since health and their diagnosis are sometimes individual and manifest, and sometimes latent and latent, which cannot be known from the senses, there is a requirement of guiding the nuisance and symptoms for their knowledge, so it became inevitable that the Greeks In Vaidya Shastra, the nuisances and symptoms that occur in health and unhealthy should be mentioned
 We are able to identify health and unhealthy disease
 ulum hakikia main aisa kaha hai ki kisi vastu kaa gyaan uske nidaan kaarnon se praapt hota hai
 If his diagnosis is not the cause, then knowledge of his personal symptoms can be detected to some extent
 unani grantho main asbagh ke chaar bhed bataae gaye hai
 These are: Asbab Maddia, Asbab Faliya, Asbab Suriya and Asbab Tamamiya, or Gaia
 basbaab maddiya se swasthya evam rog adhishthit hote hai
 It also has two strains: 1
 adjacent and illustrious
 sannikrusht nidaan ang pratyang, oj evam vaayu hen or viprakrusht nidaan chaturdosh or chaturmahabhoot hai
 Upholstery phallia are the factors that change, or protect, the human body
 asbab suriya ke teen upbhed he: 1
 prakruti, 2
 bal or 3
 sanghathan 
 External health is found by staying in the nature, force and organization
 in teenon main se kisi ek ke vikrut hone se rog hota hen
 Asabas are all body movements
 sutara unani vaidyak main nimna vishyon kaa pratipaadan kiya jaataa he : mahabhoot prakruti, dosha, abhishravayav, sanmishravayav, praan or oj, bal, swasthyay evam aswasthya or tanmadhyavarti halaat, aswastha drusht, yaa shareerik avasthaa main or adholikhit nidaan kaaran khaadya, peya, vaayu, jal, desh tathaa sthaan, sansaadhan, stambhan, vyavsaay, swabhaav, kayika evam maansik kaary, acarya, vibhinn vaayu lingabhed, sharir par aane vaale anya bhra vishay, swasthya sangrakshan, prayek vyaadhi ke nivaranarth khaadh evam peya kii vidhi, cheshtaa acheshtaa kaa anumaan, aushadhsewan, hastkarm evam shalyakarm se laabh uthaanaa
 Of these, there are some that Hakim must accept without reasoning and there are some who have to prove by logic and logic
 vaidyak shaastra main kuch vishay anya shastron se grahan kiye gaye hai, aise vishyon kaa swaroop tark evam yukti ke bina sweekaar kar lenaa vaidya ke liye anivaary hai
 The organ suffixes and their deeds are known by knowledge and the cremation and surgery
 shaikh kehete hai, jin vishyon kaa jaananaa or jinaki vaidyak main tark evam yukti se siddh karnaa aavashyak hen, ve rog, unke nidaan kaaran or unke lakshan he tathaa yah he ki vyaadhi kaa nivaaran kis prakaar kiya jaae evam swasthya sangrakshan kis prakaar ho saktaa hai
 These topics are such that among them, whose existence is not clear and definite, it is necessary to prove them in detail with time and evidence - alphabetical reasoning and logic
 shaikh ke vivaran se hamen jahaan unani vaidyak ke samast pratipaadyon evam sidvanto kaa sankshep main gyaan ho jaataa hai, vahaan is vishay kaa bhi gyaan hota hai ki in pracheen vidwaanon ke paas pratyaksh gnanarth us praarambhik evam saral yug main jo jo upkaran uplabdh the, unase apni shakti evam samarthy bhar kaam lene main in audyogikon ne koi baat uthaa nahin rakhi hai
 Changing Kapitya Siddhanto and arriving at different conclusions of different investigators at different times is a free rule
 paashchaatya vaigyanik vishyon ke sambandh main bhi aisa sadaa hi hota aa rahaa hai
 What was once considered irrefutable truth, has been proved untrue many times by new means, tools and discoveries
 pratyaksh gyaan ke baad bhi bhuyodarshan karne waalon se bhul hona sambhav he, to is niyam se pracheen vidwaan bhi nahin batch sakate hai
 They studied and observed the laws of nature according to their ability
 pratyaksh prayog yaa anubhav ke baad kuch nishkarsh sthir kiye, unamem se kuch peeche ke prayogon or anubhavon se mithyaa siddh hue
 With this we cannot blame those ancient scholars
 shaikhurais ke anusaar vyaadhi kaa pratikaar hetuvyaadhivipareet dwaara hi kiya jaataa hai
 It is treated as wizard
 yahi moolbhoot siddhant anya chikitsa pranaaliyon ke bhi hai
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga puraana, hinduon ke dharm sambandhi aakhyaan granth hai
 Which includes creation, rhythm, accounts of ancient sages, sages and kings etc
 ye vaidic kaal ke bahutkaa baad ke granth hai, jo smriti vibhaag main aate hai
 Among the texts which have an important place in the Indian life stream, Puranas are considered very important as devotional texts
 atharah puraanon main alag-alag devi-devataaon ko kendra maanakar paap or punya, dharm or adharm, karm or akarm kii gaathaayen kahi gai hai
 Some Puranas describe the beginning of the universe from beginning to end
 'puraana' kaa shabdic arth he, 'pracheen' yaa 'purana'
 The Puranas are composed mainly in Sanskrit but some Puranas have been composed in regional languages as well
 hindu or jain donon hi dharmon ke vaanmay main puraana milte hai
 There is no limit to the subjects mentioned in the Puranas
 isamen brahmandavidya, devi-devataaon, raajaaon, nayakon, rishi-muniyon kii vanshavali, lokkathaayen, tirthayatra, mandir, chikitsa, khagol shaastra, vyakaran, khanij vigyaan, hasya, premakathaon ke saath-saath dharamshastra or darshan kaa bhi varnan he
 There is a great disparity in the contents of various Puranas
 itnaa hi nahin, ek hi puraana ke kai-kai pandulipiyaan praapt hui hai jo paraspar bhinn-bhinn hai
 The creators of Hindu Puranas are unknown and it seems that many creators have composed them over many centuries
 iske vipareet jain puraana jain puraanon kaa rachanakaal or rachanakaaron ke naam bataae ja sakate hai
 Coming from ritual to knowledge, a continuous stream of devotion has flowed through the Puranas in the Indian psyche
 vikaas kii isi prakriya main bahudevvaad or nirgun brahm kii swaroopatmak vyakhya se dhire-dhire maanas avatharavaad yaa sagun bhakthi kii ore prerit hua
