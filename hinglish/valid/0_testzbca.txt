 The Ramayana composed by him is called Valmiki Ramayana
 ramayana ek mahakavy he jo ki shriram ke jivan ke madhyam se hamen jivan ke satya se, kartavya se, parichit karwaata he
 The word Adikavi is formed from the combination of 'adi' and 'kavi'
 'aadi' kaa arth hota he 'pratham' or 'kavi' kaa arth hota he 'kavy kaa rachayita'
 Valmiki Rishi composed the first Sanskrit epic which is famous as Ramayana
 pratham sanskrit mahakavy kii rachana karne ke kaaran valmiki adikavi kahalaaye
 Valmiki was an early poet but his specialty was that he was not a Brahmin, but a boatman
 
 After writing the epic of Valmiki Ramayana, he was called Adikavi but he was a learned boatman, he was not a Brahmin, once Maharishi Valmik was looking at a pair of crouch birds

 dekhat ban sar sell suhaae
 Valmik Ashram Prabhu came tathaa jab "ram" ne apni patni sita kaa parityag kar diya tab maharishi vaalmik ji ne hi sita ko aasraa diya tha
 The above quotations prove that Valmik was a contemporary of "rama" and that the Valmik sage had full knowledge of all the events that took place in his life
 unhen "ram" kaa charitra ko itnaa mahaan samajha ki unke charitra ko aadhaar maan kar apane mahakavy "ramayana" kii rachana kii
 There is no specific evidence of the birth of Adikavi Valmiki anywhere
 satyuga, treta or dwapar teenon kaalon main valmiki kaa ullekh miltaa he wo bhi valmiki naam se hi
 According to Ramacharitra Manas, when Ram came to Valmiki ashram, he lay down like a stick on the ground to offer obeisance at the feet of Adikavi Valmiki and came out of his mouth
 " arthath aap teenon lokon ko jaanane vaale swayan prabhu ho

 purvi slaavon ke bare main 859 isvi se pehle ke kaal main zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 The reason for this is that their regions were far from the rest of Europe and there was no written form of their language
 863 main sirilik lipi vishesh rup se slavi bhashaaon ko likhane ke liye ijad kii gai
 By 600 CE, the Slavic people are believed to have divided into eastern, western and southern branches

 Trains, elevators, and cranes are all running smoothly through power electronics
 akshay urja ke sroton ke vidyut grid se jodne main shakti electronic kaa hi haath he
 Even radar systems rely on power electronics
 yadhyapi shakti electraniki main chote-mote sabhi electronic avyav prayukt hote hai, kintu nimnlikhit avyavay shakti electraniki ke vishishti pahchaan hai- Work in the field of power electronics was preceded by miniature-signal electronics
 sabase pehle vidyut shakti ke niyantran tathaa parivartan ke liye vidyut mashiinon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This was followed by the Mercury Arc Rectifier
 tatpashchaat nirvaat evam gas-bhare vaalvon kaa yug aayaa
 The development of SCR in 1957 gave a new direction to Shakti Electronics
 aajkal esasiaar, jitio, bijetti, mossphate, aijibiti aadi swichon ke prayog se atyant dakshata purvak vidyut-shakti kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Due to this, the field of power electronics has become very wide and important
 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation

 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 This is why a contact-circuit is used
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he

 The corrosion process of metals, which results in mechanical degradation of metals, differs from this action
 dhaatuon main sanksharan vastut: rasinic kriya, athwa vaidyutracinic kriya, ke rup main hota he
 According to the root base, both of the above types of corrosion actions are different stages of the root action
 dhaatuon kii sanksharan kriyapranali kii mukt urja main vishisht evam aavashyak rup main nunata utpann hoti he
 The interaction of a gas, or a humid environment, in the corrosion of metals by direct chemical action produces suitable conditions for corrosion
 sanksharan kii vidyutracinic kriya main, dhaatuon ke drav main nimajjit hone se, vidyutdhara utpann hone kii upyukt paristhitiyaan utpann ho jaati hai
 Thus, there is electrodynamic degradation of metals in corrosion
 unamem tathaa dravon main nimajjit hone se dhaatuon kii sanksharan keval uparyukt paristhitiyon par nirbhar nahin karti, anya karkon kaa bhi vishesh evam mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 Generally, the final product produced in the corrosion reaction of metals is a compound which is found in nature as a mineral substance
 udaahranarth, taanbe ke patt ko bahut varshon tak aantarasthaleey vaataavaran main, khuli avasthaa main rakhane se patt ke upree tal par ksharak sulphate kii ek parat germ jaati he
 This copper base sulfate is similar to brokatite mineral found in nature
 isi prakaar lohe athwa ispaat ke patt ko lavniya jal main purnat: nimajjit rakhane par varsha main uske tal par jalyojit loh oxide kii kathor parat jam jaati he
 Hydrated ferric oxide is similar to the mineral gothite found in nature
 is prakaar dhaatuon kii sanksharan kriya dhaatuon ke madhyasthayee dhatvik avasthaa main sthaayee oxikrut avasthaa main prayaavartan kii kriya he
 Metals that are found in nature in their pure form, such as gold, do not usually have corrosion action by the factors present in nature and consequently such metals are found in an unconnected state
 sanrachanaatmak aadhaar par sanksharan kriya nimnaankit vibhinn swaroopon main dhaatuon par prabhaav utpann karti he : Prevention of corrosion of metals theoretically excludes all measures and factors that encourage the reversal of the permanent state
 is prakaar ke kaarak vibhinn dhaatuon ke liye bhinn bhinn hote hai, parantu saamaanya rup main oxigen tathaa oxigen mishrit vilyan evam jal main viley padaarth sthaayee avasthaa ke prayaavartan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Complete exclusion of the above factors is often impossible in the prevention of corrosion
 at: inaki upasthiti main swayansthirak kriyaaon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The factor that causes maximum inhibition on the speed of corrosion under special conditions of metal corrosion is called the controlling factor of corrosion
 audyogic drushti se mahatvapurn praaia: sabhi dhaatuon ke bahya tal par vaataavaran main khule rahane se dikhaai denevaali, athwa na dikhaai denevaali, sookshm parat jam jaati he, jo anuvarthi sanksharan prakriyaayon ko prabhavit karti he
 Generally this layer is made of open metal oxide
 iske gun mul dhaatu ke gunon se bhinn hote hai tathaa khule rahane kii paristhitiyon se bhi vyavahaarabhinnata utpann hoti he
 In most circumstances this layer of oxide prevents corrosion of the parent
 is prakaar kii moti parat jab prasaaran evam sankuchan ke kaaran kahin kahin se tut jaati he, tab in sthanon par vidyut-rasinic-sanksharan prarambh ho jaataa he
 Corrosion of metals is divided into the following six parts: uparyukt prayek dasha ke sanksharan prakram main visheshta hoti he or iske nivaaran ke liye bhinn bhinn upaay kiye jate hai
 Various methods are used in the corrosion prevention of metals, the following being: sanksharan nivaaran kii antim reeti sarvaadhik upyog main aati he
 In this manner, a natural preventive overlap of oxides, such as oxides on the clean outer surface of the metal, is used or a similar synthetic surplus material is used
 adhilep dwaara nivaaran kii is reeti main rangalep evam isi prakaar ke anya lepon kaa upyog hota he, jinamein ksharak chromet padaarth, litharge, rakt sis, laal loh oxide, graphite, vitumini padaarth aadi pramukh hai
 Galvanization, metallization, cementization, electrolytic overlap and other metal overlays are increasingly used in corrosion prevention

 paapon kii gart tale dhansa puuran jaaydaad ke bantwaare kii maang karata he
 India leaves all the assets voluntarily and goes to fight in the indo-pak war, while Puran does business of black marketing and smuggling of grain on the one hand and fools the villagers on the other side
 ladaai main bharat dushman ke haathon zakhmi ho jaataa he or pakadaa jaataa he lekin kisi tarah dushman ko chakma dekar apane gaanv kii taraf zakhmi haalat main he nikal padataa he
 On the way, Charandas conspires to kill the wounded India, but Malang Chacha, who is handicapped, saves him and gets himself injured
 ghayal bharat or malang chachaa ko bachaane main doctor kavita mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 On the other hand, Puran is also arrested
 usko apni galati kaa ahsaas ho jaataa he or vah gorakh dhandha karne waalon ko pakadvane main sarkaar kii sahaayta karata he
 The composers of this film are kalyanji-anandji and the lyricists are Gulshan Bawra, Indivar, Prem Dhawan and Qamar Jalalabadi

 In 1967, Frank Vanlas successfully patented CMOS
 kabhi-kabhi CMOS kaa ullekh sampoorak-samamiti dhaatu-oxide-ardhchaalak ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The terms "complement-symmetry" signify the fact that the typical digital design style used with CMOS uses p-type and n-type complementary and symmetric pairs of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors for logical tasks
 ucch shor pratirodh-kshamta evam nimna sthitik urja khapat CMOS upkarnon kii do mahatvapurn visheshtaayen hai
 Significant amounts of energy are taken only when the transistors in the CMOS device are switching between on and off states
 parinamswarup, tark ke anya roopon, udaahranarth transistor-transistor tark yaa NMOS tark, jo p-channel upkarnon ke bina sabhi n-channel upkarnon kaa prayog karata he, kii tarah CMOS upkaran bahut adhik apshisht ushma utpann nahin karte
 CMOS ek chip par taarkik kaaryon ke ek ucch ghanatv kii bhi anumati detaa he
 This is the main reason that CMOS emerged victorious in the eighties and became the most used technology for implementation in VLSI chips

 "CMOS" refers to both a specific style of digital power-circuit system design and the range of processes used to implement that power-circuit system on integrated circuits
 CMOS vidyut-paripath tantra sthitik avasthaa main kam vidyut nasht karata he or samaan kaaryaatmakataa vaale anya kriyanvayanon kii tulana main adhik saghan hota he
 As this advantage has become more important, CMOS processes and their various forms are becoming dominated, so a large proportion of modern integrated circuits are produced over CMOS processes
 computaron, doorsanchaar upkarnon or signal processing upkarnon main paae jane vaale logic gates tathaa anya digital paripathon ke kriyanvayan ke liye CMOS paripath p-prakaar va n-prakaar ke dhaatu-oxide-ardhchaalak kshetra-prabhaav transistors ke sangyojan kaa prayog karte hai
 Although CMOS logic can be implemented with discrete devices, typical commercial CMOS products are integrated circuits consisting of millions of transistors of both types on flat pieces of size between 0
1 to 4 square centimeters of silicon
 in upkarnon ko saamanytah "chips " kaha jaataa he, haalanki udyog ke antargat unka ullekh "daay " yaa "dise ", "diese ", yaa "daay " ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The main principle that allows the implementation of logic gates to CMOS circuits is the use of p-type and n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors to construct paths from voltage source or surface to output
 jab output tak jane vaala koi path voltage strot se nirmit kiya jaataa he, to paripath ko upar kii ore khinchaa hua kaha jaataa he
 Another circuit state occurs when a path leading to the output is constructed from the ground and the output is brought down to the probable plane
 CMOS paripathon kaa nirmaan isaliye kiya jaataa he taaki sabhi PMOS transistors main anivaary rup se voltage strot yaa kisi anya PMOS transister se praapt input hi ho
 isi prakaar sabhi NMOS transistors main bhi anivaary rup se dharaatal yaa kisi anya NMOS transister se praapt input hi hona chaiye
 ek PMOS transister kii rachana ek nimna get voltage lagu kiye jane par apane strot or gantavy samparkon ke bich ek nimna pratirodh tathaa ucch get voltage lagu karne par ucch pratirodh nirmit karti he
 On the other hand, the design of an NMOS transistor produces a high resistance when a low gate voltage is applied between the source and a destination and a low resistance when a high gate voltage is applied
 dahini ore bana chitra yah darshata he ki jab koi input ek PMOS transister or ek NMOS transister, donon se joda jaataa he, to kya ghatit hota he
 When the voltage of input a is low, the channel of the NMOS transistor is in a high resistance state
 yah q se dharaatal tak pravaahit ho sakane vaali dhara ko simit kar detaa he
 The channel of the PMOS transistor is in a low resistance state and a very high current can flow from the supply to the output
 chunki aapurti voltage tathaa q ke bich pratirodh kam he, atah q se lee gai ek dhara ke kaaran aapurti voltage or q ke bich voltage main giravat bhi kam hoti he
 Hence the output displays a high voltage
 duusari ore, jab input a kaa voltage ucch hota he, to PMOS transister of avasthaa main hota he, atah yah dhanatmak aapurti se output tak pravaahit ho rahi dhara ko simit kar degaa, jabaki NMOS transister on avasthaa main he, jisase output ko dharaatal kii ore jane kii anumati milti he
 Since the resistance between q and the surface is low, the drop in the voltage of the current going into q is less when q is placed above the ground
 is kam giravat ke kaaran output ek nimna voltage pradarshit karata he
 In short, the outputs of PMOS and NMOS transistors are complemented such that when the input is low, the output is high and when the input is high, the output is low
 input or output ke is vipareet vyavhaar ke kaaran CMOS paripath kaa output iske input kaa pratilom hota he
 An important feature is the duality between the PMOS transistors and NMOS transistors of a CMOS circuit
 ek CMOS paripath output se vidyut strot athwa dharaatal tak sadaiv hi ek path kii upasthiti kii anumati dene ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 To accomplish this, the set of all paths leading to the voltage source must complement the group of all paths leading to the ground
 This task can be done simply by defining one in terms of the other's NOT
 di morgan ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tark ke kaaran, samanaantar PMOS transistors ke anuroop NMOS transistors kramik hote hai, jabaki kramik PMOS transistors ke anuroop NMOS transistors samanaantar hote hai
 More complex logical functions, such as functions involving AND and OR gates, require changes in the path between the gates to represent the logic
 jab kisi path main kramik rup se lage do transistors shaamil hote hai, to donon transistors main apane sambandhit aapurti voltage ke prati nimna pratirodh hona chaiye, jo ek AND kaa nirmaan karata he
 When a path consists of two transistors connected in parallel, either one or both of the transistors must have a low voltage to connect the supply voltage to the output, creating an OR
 CMOS tark main ek NAND get kaa paripath chitra dahini ore pradarshit kiya gaya he
 If the inputs from both a and b are high, both NMOS transistors will operate, neither of the PMOS transistors will operate, and a conductor path will be established between the output and Vss, which will cause the output to be low
 If any input from either a or b is low, then an NMOS transistor will not operate, a PMOS transistor and a conductor path will be established between the output and Vdd, making the output high
 NMOS kii tulana main CMOS kaa ek laabh yah he ki nimna-se-ucch or ucch-se-nimna, donon output roopantaran teevr hote hai kyonki NMOS tark ke bhaar registers ke vipareet chaalu kiye jane par pul-ap transistors ke bich pratirodh nimna hota he
 Additionally, the output signal swings at full voltage between low and high tracks
 yah shaktishaalee, adhik nikat rup se samamit pratikriya CMOS ko adhik shor pratirodhi bhi banaati he
 For a method of calculating delay in a CMOS circuit, see Logical Attempts

 The circuit is constructed on a P-type substrate
 policilicon, visaran or n-well ko "buniyadi paraten " kaha jaataa he or inhen vastav main P-prakaar ke adhbstar ke khandakon main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 These contacts form a combination by separating a resistive layer between the base layers and the first layer of metal
 NAND ke input policilicon hai
 CMOS transistors are formed by intersection of polysilicon and diffusion: n diffusion for n devices; p Diffusion for p Tools
 The output is connected in metal

 The n device is produced on a P-type substrate
 P-upkaran kaa utpaadan ek N-prakaar ke coop main kiya jaataa he
 a P-type substratum "tap" is attached to the VSS and an N-type n-well tap is connected to the VDD to prevent latches
 CMOS tark NMOS tark paripathon kii tulana main kam bijli nasht karata he kyonki CMOS keval swichan karte samay hi bijli letaa he 
 kisi aadhunik 90 nanometer prakriya main, ek vishisht ASIC par output kaa swichan 120 picoseconds le saktaa he or aisa prayek das nanoseconds par hoga
 jab bhi output nimna ho, to NMOS tark vidyut nasht karata he, kyonki bhaar pratirodhi tathaa n-prakaar ke network ke dwaara Vdd se Vss tak ek dhara-path hota he
 Whenever CMOS circuits are switched on, they dissipate power by charging different load capacities
 veshtit aavesh voltage parivartan or dharita kaa gunanfal hota he
 Multiply the switching frequency at the load capacities to obtain the current used and multiply by the voltage again to obtain the characteristic switching power lost by a CMOS device: p = CV 2 f { \ displaystyle p = CV ^ { 2} f} 1990 ke dashak main chip par taar adhik sankare ho jane or lambey taar adhik pratirohak ban jane ke kaaran vidyut khapat kaa ek atirikt rup lakshaneey ban gaya
 un pratirohak taron ke ant par sthit CMOS gates dhime input roopantaran dekhte hai
 In between these conversions, both NMOS and PMOS networks are partially conductive and the current flows directly from Vdd to Vss
 is prakaar prayog kii gai vidyut ko lohdand vidyut kaha jaataa he
 a cautious design that protects against null-driven long thin wires has improved this effect, and iron power is almost always much lower than switching power
 NMOS or PMOS donon transistors main ek get-strot simarekha voltage hota he, jiske neeche upkaran se pravaahit dhara bahut adhik ghat jaati he
 Historically, CMOS designs operated at a supply voltage much higher than their threshold voltage
 lagbhag shunya simarekha voltage vaala ek vishesh prakaar kaa CMOS transister mul transister he
 To increase the speed of production, producers have moved towards constructions that have lower voltage limits; However, a modern NMOS transistor with a Vth of 200 mv has a characteristic sub-limit leakage current
 aisi rachanaaen, jinamein paripathon kii ek badi maatra shaamil hoti he, yadi ve sakriy swichan na kar raheen hon, tab bhi ve is risaav dhara ke kaaran bijli kii khapat karti hai
 Leakage is a major part of the total power used by such compositions

 The use of high-k dielectrics in place of silicon dioxide, which is conventional gate dielectric, allows similar device performance, but with a thicker gate antitumor, and thus avoids this current
 nae padaarth or tantra rachana kaa prayog karke risaav vidyut main kami CMOS ke pravardhan ko shakti pradaan karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
