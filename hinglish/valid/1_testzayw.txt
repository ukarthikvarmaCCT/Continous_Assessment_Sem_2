 saath hi, unke lomak shirshon main ek parshvik lacheelaapan bhi hota he jisase daanton ke lomak ko daanton ko donon ore se pakadaney or masoodon ko chot pahunchane ke khatre ke bina masoodon kii rekha ke neeche saaf karne ke liye behatar niyantran praapt hota he
 Occasional flossing and / or incorrect flossing can lead to bleeding from the gums

 haalanki unhone brush karne or lomak karne ke kram ke bare main koi sifarish nahin kii he, brush karne ke pehle lomak karne se toothpaste ke fluoride ko daanton ke bich pahunchane main sahaayta milti he
 More vigorous or faulty floss may result in damage to the gingival tissue
 sahi lomakakriya ke liye, associyeshan lomak ko daant ke parshv ke viruddh c ke aakaar main mode lene or tab daant ko masoode kii rekha ke neeche se sire tak do se teen baar saaf karne or yah kriya bagal ke va uske baad ke daanton par dohraane kii salaah detaa he
 Some powerful flossers use vibrations, which begin at the ends and pass through the floss
 isaki prerana sambhawatah aadhunik vidyut toothbrashon main bristalon ke kampan ke isi tarah ke prayog se mili he
 As the vibration produces light motion, the floss finds the path of lowest resistance when thrust is applied
 yah gati daant va masoode ko asthaayee rup se alag karke lomak ko us sthaan main pravesh karne main madad karti he
 This makes penetration under the gingival line much easier and less force is used to penetrate the space between the teeth
 kam balaprayog ke kaaran lomakakriya par adhik niyantran sambhav hota he
 Normal floss may force the floss to penetrate the teeth until it penetrates, and the mobility it produces can have painful effects on gingival tissue
 behatar niyantran se ise kam kiya yaa puri tarah se isse bachaa ja saktaa he
 Many people consider vibrations to be comfortable; It is a common technique of massage and handicapped-scientific instruments
 thik jaise vidyut toothbrush daanton or masoodon ke liye aaraamdeh hote hai, vaise hi kampan karne vaala lomak masoode kii rekha kaa peedaaharan or maalish kar saktaa he
 It is less likely to cut by not pressurizing a different area of floss and using less pressure
 masoodon par hone vaali chhilan bhi adhik samroop se vitarit hoti he, jisase utak kaa anukulan bhi adhik samarupi hota he
 Combining the action of floss with a tooth brush can prevent gum diseases, buccal diseases and tooth decay
 niyamit rup se lomak karne ko hriday rog kii ghatnaon main kami se bhi joda gaya he

 Jaina Agamas are considered to have both distinction and impenetration in Dravya and synonyms
 parantu inke anusaar inkaa bhed vyaavhaarik he, parmarthat: donon abhinn he
 Similarly, both the harmony and the absence of the varna in the soul are inaccurate, but according to them, in practical terms the varna is in the soul and not in the spiritual form
 inhone deh or aatma ke aikya ko vyavahaarany main mana parantu nishchaynay main donon kaa bhed mana
 They consider matter as integral to power
 vaisheshik darshan main satta saamaanya ke kaaran dravya ko sat maanate hai, parantu unka kahana he ki is mat main to satta se bhinn hone ke kaaran dravya asat ho jayega
 Hence matter is the form of power and this is divine
 satta hi dravya, gun or padaarth ke rup main naanaa deshkal main viksit hoti he at: sab kuch dravya rup hi he
 Their intention was to consider virtue and synonym as impervious to matter and to accept both hospitality and truthism from discrimination

 In the Aupanishad and Mahayana philosophies, there is a distinction between behavior and altruism or genius and truth
 is bhed ko maanakar hi aadhyatmavaadi darshanik ek advaytatv kii pratishtha karte hai
 Jain philosophy is ghostly, not spiritualist
 phir bhi inhone vyavahaarany or nishchaynay main bhed mana
 What is generally seen is not always true, and there is no necessity that truth should always be visible in pure form
 unhone aatma ke teen rup maane
 Infatuated with external substances, the mind that considers the body as integral to itself is Bahiraatma
 deh kaa bhedagyaan ho jane par mokshamarg arudh aatma ko antaratma kaha gaya he
 When the soul is decayed by meditation, the soul attains pure form
 tab usko paramatma kehete hai
 He has declared this divine being completely integral to the then philosophy by calling Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Buddha etc
 which probably no Jain Acharya did
 yahi inaki visheshta he jo anya jainacharyon se inhen alag karti he or inaki samanvayvaadee pravriti kaa nidarshan he
 He considered the soul to be different from the work, but integrated it with the imagination of the man of the Sankhya, but did not consider the soul as infeasible
 unke mat main aatma anaatmak parinman kaa kartta nahin he kintu parinami hone ke kaaran usko kartta bhi mana he
 Spirit, knowledge etc
 is the doer of the subjective results
 unka kahana tha ki tatv kaa vyavhaar or nischaynyon se varnan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Element is positive
 jeev shuddh rup main ne to baddh he, na abaddh
 Only beings released from bondage and bondage have been called co-workers and divine divine beings
 vyavahaarany kaa niraakaran nishchaynay se hota he
 They say that though there is knowledge of the element by taking the shelter of the decision, yet after the philosophy is realized, the decision is also destroyed

 The capital here is Quetta
 yahan ke logon kii pramukh bhashaa balooch yaa baluchi ke naam se jaani jaati he
 In 1944, the idea of independence of Balochistan came into the idea of general Money but in 1947 it was included in Pakistan at the British behest
 1970 ke dashak main ek balooch rashtrawaad kaa udai hua jisamen baluchistan ko pakistan se swatantra karne kii maang uthi
 This region is one of the least populated areas of Pakistan
 iske purvi kinare par sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa udbhav hua
 Some scholars believe that the original people of the Indus Valley Civilization were Baloch only
 par iske sakshya naganya hai
 The skepticism remains so far because of not reading the script of the Indus Valley
 par sindhu sabhyataa ke avshesh aaj ke baluchistan main kam hi paae jate hai
 The Baluchi people believe that their original residence was in the Syrian region and their origin is Semitic

 is praant main 27 zile hai : Heparin, liver), also known as unbroken heparin, a high-sulfate glycosaminoglycan, is widely used as an anticoagulant injection and has the highest negative charge by any known biological molecule density
 is
 iskaa istemaal vibhinn prayogtmak or chikitsa upkarnon jaise test tub or gurde kii dialysis mashiinon par thakka-rodhi aantarik sataha banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Pharmaceutical grade heparin is obtained from mucosal tissues of animals slaughtered for meat, such as the cavernous intestine or bovine lung
 haalanki chikitsa main iskaa upyog mukhya rup se thakkarodh ke liye kiya jaataa he, sharir main isaki vaastavik kriyaatmak bhoomika aspasht bani hui he, kyonki rakt virdohi skandan ko adhikanshtah heparan sulphate proteyoglaikens dwaara hasil kiya jaataa he jise antahstareey koshikaon se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Heparin is usually stored within the secretory spores of the mast cell and is released into the vasculature only at sites of tissue injury
 yah prastaavit he ki thakkarodh ke bajaay, heparin kaa mukhya uddeshy aisi jagahon par hamalavar bacteria or anya bahya tatwon se raksha karnaa he
 In addition, it is widely conserved in various species, including some invertebrates that do not have a similar blood coagulation system
 deshi heparin ek bahulak he jiskaa aanvik bhaar 3 kda se 30 kda tak hota he, haalanki adhikansh vanijyik heparin nirmaan kaa ausat anvik bhaar 12 kda se 15 kda ke bich hota he
 Heparin is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family of carbohydrates composed of a variable-sulfated disaccharide unit
 mukhya disekaride ikaiyaan jo heparin main hoti hai unhen neeche dikhaaya gaya hai
 The most common disaccharide unit is composed of a 2-o-sulfated iduronic acid and a 6-o-sulfated, N-sulfated glucosamine, idoa-glcns
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah gomance ke fefdon se 85% ke heparin kaa nirmaan karata he or shookreey antric mukosa se 75% banaata he
 There are some rare disaccharides not shown below that contain 3-o-sulfated glucosamine) or a free amine group
 Under physiological conditions, protons are removed from the ester and amide sulfate groups and they attract positively-charged counterions to form a heparin salt
 aisa isi rup main hota he ki heparin ko aam taur par ek thakka-rodhi ke rup main diya jaataa he
 One unit of heparin is approximately equal to 0
002 mg of pure heparin, an amount similar to that required to keep a cat's liquid blood at 0 ° c for 24 hours
 glca-glcnac glca-glcns idoa-glcns -glcns idoa glcns- glcns- heparin kii tri-aiami sanrachana is baat se jatil ho jaati he ki iduronic acid donon main se kisi ek nimna-urja gathan main maujuud ho saktaa he jab ise ek auligosecride ke andar ek aantarik rup se rakhaa jaataa he
 The conformational equilibrium is affected by the sulfation state of adjacent glucosamine sugars
 phir bhi, heparin ke ek dodexasaikaride kii ghol sanrachana jo puri tarah se chah glcns-idoa ke doharaav ikaayiyon se gathit he, uskaa nirdhaaran NMR spectroscopy or anvik modelling takanic ke sangyojan ke istemaal se kiya jaataa he
 Two models were constructed, one in which all idoa were in the 2S0 formation and the other in which they are in the 1C4 formation
 But there is no evidence to suggest that changes between these formations occur in a concrete style
 ye model, protein data bank code ke anuroop hai 1HPN
 In the image above: in modelon main, heparin ek pechdaar gathan apanaataa he, jiskaa ghumaav, sulphate samoohon ke gucchhon ko pechdaar dhuree ke donon ore kareeb 17 angstrom ke ek niyamit antaraal par rakhata he
 Heparin is a naturally present anticoagulant produced by basophils and mast tissue
 heparin ek thakka-rodhi ke rup main kaary karata he, jahaan yah thakkon or maujuuda thakkon ko khun ke bheetar vistaarit hone se roktaa he
 While heparin does not break down clots that have already formed, it allows the body's natural clot lysis system to function normally to break down clots that have formed
 heparin ko aam taur par, nimnlikhit sthitiyon ke liye thakka-rodhan ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he: Derivatives of heparin and its low molecular weight are effective in preventing deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients, but there is no evidence that either one is more effective in preventing death
 heparin, anzime pravrodhak antithrombin III main bandha jaataa he or ek gathnaatmak parivartan ko paidaa karata he jo pratikriyasheel sait loop ke lacheelepan main vruddhi ke madhyam se iske sakriyan ko falit karata he
 Activated AT then inactivates thrombin and other proteases involved in blood clotting, most notably factor Xa
 AT dwaara in proteis kaa niskrian dar, heparin ke bandhan kii vajah se 1000-guna bad saktaa he
 AT binds to a specific pentasaccharide sulfation sequence contained in a heparin polymer glcnac / ns-glca-glcns-idoa-glcns The conformational change in AT upon heparin-binding mediates its inhibition of factor Xa
 thrombin nishedh ke liye, haalanki, thrombin ko heparin bahulak se aise sait par bandhan karnaa chahie jo pentasecride ke nazadik he
 The high-negative charge density of heparin contributes to its extremely strong electrostatic interaction with thrombin
 AT, thrombin or heparin ke bich trigut sankul kaa gathan, thrombin kii niskriyata main falit hota he
 For this reason the activity of heparin against thrombin is size-dependent, where ternary packages require at least 18 saccharide units for effective formation
 iske vipareet, kaarak virdohi Xa gatividhi ko keval pentasecride badhyakaari site kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This size difference induced low-molecular-weight heparin and more recently for fondaparinux as an anti-pharmaceutical clot
 nimna-aanvik bhaar vaale heparin or phondaparinaks, thrombin-virdohi gatividhi ke bajaay kaarak-virdohi Xa gatividhi ko lakshith karte hai, jahaan unka lakshya jamaav ke ek adhik sookshm viniman or ek behatar chikitsiya suchakank ko aasaan karnaa he
 The chemical structure of fondaparinux is shown on the left
 yah ek synthetic pentasecride he jisaki rasinic sanrachana, AT badhyakaari pentasecride anukram ke lagbhag samaan he jise paulimeric heparin or heparan sulphate main paaya ja saktaa he
 With LMWH and fondaparinux, there is a reduced risk of osteoporosis and heparin-borne thrombocytopenia
 APTT kii monitering kii bhi jarurat nahin he or yah beshak thakka-rodhi prabhaav ko pratibimbit nahin karata he, kyonki APTT, kaarak Xa main parivartan ke prati asamvedansheel he
 Danaparoid, a mixture of heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, can be used as anticoagulants for patients in whom HIT has developed
 kyonki danaperoid main heparin yaa heparin ke tukade nahin hote, heparin-janit antibody ke saath danaperoid kii paar-abhikriyasheeltaa ko 10% se kam suchit kiya gaya he
 The effect of heparin is measured in the lab by partial thromboplastin time ,
 heparin ko antretar diya jaataa he kyonki iske ucch nakaaratmak charge or bade aakaar ke kaaran ise aant dwaara avashoshit nahin kiya jaataa he
 Heparin may be injected intravenously or subcutaneously; Intrauterine injection is avoided because of the possibility of formation of hematoma
 lagbhag ek ghante ke laghu jaivik ardh-jivan ke kaaran, heparin ko aksar diya janaa chahie yaa ek satat seven ke rup main hona chahie
 However, a single dose of low-molecular-weight heparin has been allowed daily, thus not requiring frequent intake
 agar lambii avadhi ke liye thakka-rodhan kii aavashyaktaa he, to heparin ko aksar thakka-rodhi chikitsa kii shuruyaat karne ke liye tab tak istemaal hota he jab tak ki maukhik liya jane vaala warfarine apana prabhaav nahin shuru kar detaa
 Details on providing this are available in the Clinical Practice Guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians: heparin kaa ek gambhir parshv-prabhaav he heparin prerit thrombocytopenia 
 HIT, pratiraksha sambandhi pratikriya ke kaaran hota he jo platelets ko pratiraksha sambandhi pratikriya kaa nishaanaa banaata he, jo platelet kii giravat main falit hota he
 This is why thrombocytopenia occurs
 yah sthiti aam taur par vichchhedan par ulat jaati he or isse saamanytah synthetic heparin ke upyog se bachaa ja saktaa he
 There is also a benign form of thrombocytopenia associated with the initial use of heparin and which resolves without stopping heparin
 heparin upachaar ke do gaiyr-rakthasravi parshv-prabhaav hai
 The first is the serum aminotransferase level, which has been reported in about 80% of patients taking heparin
 yah vishmata, yakrut rog ke saath sambandhit nahin he or yah dawa band kar dene ke baad gaayab ho jaati he
 Another complication is hyperkalemia, which occurs in 5% to 10% of patients taking heparin and is the result of heparin-induced aldosterone pressure
 heparin chikitsa kii shuruyaat ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar hikerakalemia dikhaai de saktaa he
 With greater rarity, alopecia and osteoporosis may develop as side effects due to prolonged use
 jaisaa ki kai dawaaon ke saath hota he, heparin kii atimatra ghaatak ho sakati he
 In September 2006, heparin received worldwide publicity when 3 prematurely born babies died when they were mistakenly given heparin overdose at an Indianapolis hospital
 protamin sulphate ko heparin ke thakka-rodhan kii pratikriya ke liye diya gaya
 Heparin is one of the oldest drugs that is still in widespread clinical use today
 isaki khoj america food and drug administration kii sthapana se pehle 1916 main hui, haalanki isane naidanik pareekshan main 1935 tak pravesh nahin kiya
 It was originally isolated from canine liver cells, hence its name
 Heparin's discovery can be attributed to the research work of two individuals: Jay mcclean and William Henry Howell
 1916 main, meclean, jo johns hopkins vishvavidhyalay main dwitiya varsh kaa medical chaatr tha howell ke maargdarshan main thakka-samarthak taiyaariyon par kaam kar rahaa tha or usne kenine jigar koshika main vasa main ghulansheel phosphetoid thakka-rodhi ko alag kiya
 In 1918, Howell coined the term heparin in 1918 for this type of fat-soluble anticoagulant
 1920 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main, howell ne ek pani main ghulansheel policecride thakka-rodhi ko alag kiya, use bhi heparin kaha gaya, haalanki yah pehle alag kiye gaye phosphetoid se pruthak tha
 It is possible that mcclean's work drew the attention of the Howell group towards finding anticoagulants, which eventually resulted in the invention of polysaccharides
 meclean ne ek sarjan ke rup main kaam kiya

 In the 1930s, many researchers investigated heparin
 karolinska institute ke erik jorpes ne 1935 main heparin sanrachana par apane anusandhan ko prakashit kiya, jisane 1936 main swedish company vitrum AB ko antahshira prayog ke liye pehla heparin utpaada shuru karne main sakasham banaaya
 Between 1933 and 1936, Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, then part of the University of Toronto, developed a technique for producing safe, non-toxic heparin, which could be given to patients in a salt solution
 heparin kaa pehla maanav pareekshan may 1935 main shuru hua or 1937 tak yah spasht tha ki conot kaa heparin ek surakshit, sulabh or prabhavi rakt thakka-rodhi he
 Prior to 1933 heparin was available, but in small quantities and very expensive, toxic and as a result not useful in medicine

 Enzymes traditionally used to digest heparin or HS are naturally generated by the soil bacterium Pedobacter heparinus
 yah jeevanu, yaa to heparin yaa HS ko apane ekmaatr carbon or nitrogen strot ke rup main upyog karne main sakasham he
 To do this, it produces a range of enzymes such as lyases, glucuronidase, sulfoesterase, and sulfamidase
 It is primarily the lichens used in heparin / HS studies
 yah jeevanu teen lices ko utpann karata he, heparinesis I, II or III or prayek main bhinn substrate visheshta he jaisaa neeche varnit he
 Licases fragment heparin / HS by beta elimination mechanisms

 Nitrous acid can be used to chemically de-polymerize heparin / HS
 nitras acid kaa istemaal ph 1
5 yaa 4 ke ek ucch ph par kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitrous acid under both conditions affects the deaminative cleavage of the chain
 'ucch' or 'nimna' donon hi ph par, dieminative vidar glcns-glca or glcns-idoa ke bich hote hai, sab ucch ph main ek dhimi dar par hote hai
 The deamination reaction and therefore the chain fissure is irrespective of O-sulfation which is carried out by either monosaccharide unit
 nimna ph par, dieminative vidar acarbonic SO4 ke jari karne or glcns ke anhydromanoj main roopantaran main falit hota he
 Low ph nitrous acid treatment is an excellent method in separating N-sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin and HS from non-n-sulfated polysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate; Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate are susceptible to nitrous acid fissure
 gozaaty or shookreey utak ke alaava, jisamen se pharmaceutical-grad heparin ko aam taur par nikaala jaataa he, heparin ko nimnlikhit prajatiyon se bhi nikaala or visheshit kiya jaataa he: The biological activity of heparin within the 6–11 species is unclear and further supports the idea that the main physiological role of heparin is not clotting
 in prajatiyon main, 1-5 main soochibaddh prajatiyon ke samaan kisi bhi tarah kii rakt jamaav pranali nahin he
 The above list also shows how heparin has been highly evolutionarily conserved with molecules of similar structure produced by diverse organisms under different phyla

 In the context of business and organization, management means - to coordinate the work of people by utilizing the available resources efficiently and effectively so as to ensure the achievement of goals
 prabandhan ke antargat aayojan, sanghathan-nirmaan, staffing, netritv karnaa, tathaa sanghathan athwa pahal kaa niyantran karnaa aadi aate hai
 Regardless of whether the organization is large or small, for profit or non-profit, providing services or manufacturing, management is essential for everyone
 prabandh isliye aavashyak he ki vyakti samuhik uddeshyon kii purti main apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Management involves mutually related tasks that all managers perform
 prabandhak alag-alag kaaryon par bhinn samay lagaate hai
 Managers at the higher levels of the organization spend more time on planning and organization than managers at the bottom
 kai lekhakon ne prabandh kii paribhaasha di he
 The word manga is a plural term widely used for all kinds of verbs
 vaise yah kisi bhi udhyam kii vibhinn kriyaaon ke liye mukhya rup se prayukt hua he
 From the above example and the study of the situation, it must have become clear that management is the action which is necessary in every organization in which people are working as a group
 sanghathan main log alag-alag prakaar ke kaary karte hai lekin vah abhi samaan uddeshy ko paane ke liye kaary karte hai
 Management provides direction in people's efforts and achieving the same objective
 is prakaar se prabandh yah dekhtaa he ki kaary puure hon evam lakshya praapt kiye jaaen kam-se-kam saadhan evam nunatam laagat par ho
 Hence, management can be defined as the process of completing tasks with the aim of achieving the objectives effectively and efficiently
 hame is paribhaasha ke vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are some words that need to be described in detail
 ye shabd hai- The process used in the definition refers to the primary task or actions that the management performs to complete the tasks
 ye kaary hai- niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan evam niyantran jin par charchaa is adhyay main evam pustak main aage kii jaaegi
 Effective or actually doing the job effectively means actually completing the given task
 prabhavi prabandh kaa sambandh sahi kaary ko karne, kriyaaon ko puraa karne evam uddeshyon ko praapt karne se he
 In other words, its function is to get the final result
 lekin maatr kaary ko sampann karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he iskaa ek or pahalu bhi he or vah he kaarykushalta arthath kaary ko kushaltapurvak karnaa
 Efficiency means doing the job correctly at minimum cost
 isamen ek prakaar kaa laagat-laabh vishleshan evam aagat tathaa nirgat ke bich sambandh hota he
 If we gain more by using less means then we will say that there is an increase in capacity
 kshamta main vruddhi hogi yadi usee laabh ke liye athwa nirgat ke liye kam sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he evam kam laagat vyay kii jaati he
 Input means are those which have the money, goods, equipment and human resources required to do a particular task
 swabhaavik he ki prabandh kaa sambandh in sansadhano ke kushal prayog se he kyonki inase laagat kam hoti he evam ant main inase laabh main vruddhi hoti he
 These two words are related to each other despite being different
 prabandh ke liye prabhavi evam kshamtawan donon kaa hona mahatvapurn he
 Both effectiveness and skill are two sides of the same coin
 lekin in donon pakshon main santulan aavashyak he tathaa kabhi-kabhi prabandh ko kushalta se samjhauta karnaa hota he
 For example it is easy to be effective and ignore efficiency which means completing the work but at a high cost
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ek company kaa lakshya varsh main 8,000 ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 To achieve this goal most of the time, the manager was not effective when the electricity was not available, but not efficient because more inputs were used for the same output
 kabhi-kabhi vyavsaay kam sansadhano se maal ke utpaadan par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he arthath laagat to kam kar di lekin nirdhaarit utpaadan nahin kar paae
 As a result, the goods could not reach the market, hence its demand was reduced and it was replaced by the competitors
 yah kaarykushalta lekin prabhaavapurntaa kii kami kii sthiti he kyonki maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya
 Therefore, it is more important for the manager to achieve the goals at the lowest cost
 iske liye prabhaavapurntaa evam kushalta main santulan rakhana hota he
 Generally high work efficiency is accompanied by high effectiveness which is the goal of all managers
 lekin bagaiyr prabhaavapurntaa ke ucch kaary kushalta par anaavashyak rup se jor dena bhi avaanchhneeya he
 Weak management is due to lack of both effectiveness and efficiency
 kuch paribhaashaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat hamen kuch tatwon kaa pataa lagata he jinhen ham prabandh kii aadharbhoot visheshtaayen kehete hai
 Management serves to fulfill certain objectives
 uddeshy kisi bhi kriya ke apekshit parinaam hote hai
 These should be derived from the basic purpose of the business
 kisi bhi sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn uddeshy hote hai tathaa prabandh ko in sabhi uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se paanaa hota he
 Objectives can be classified into organizational objectives, social objectives and personal objectives
 prabandh, sanghathan ke liye uddeshyon ke nirdhaaran evam unako puraa karne ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 It has to achieve many types of objectives in all fields and keep in mind the interests of all the stakeholders like shareholders, employees, customers, government etc
 kisi bhi sanghathan kaa mukhya uddeshy maanav evam bhautik sansadhano ke adhiktam sambhav laabh ke liye upyog hona chahie
 Which means meeting the economic objectives of the business
 ye uddeshy hai- apane aapako jivit rakhana, laabh arjeet karnaa evam badhotaree
 The basic objective of any business is to maintain its existence
 prabandh ko sanghathan ke bane rahane kii disha main praytn karnaa chahie
 For this the organization should earn enough money to meet the costs
 vyavsaay ke liye iskaa bane rahanaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Management has to ensure that the organization makes a profit
 laabh udhyam ke nirantar safal parichaalan ke liye ek mahatvapurn protsaahan kaa kaary karata he
 Benefits are necessary to meet the costs and risks of the business
 deergh avadhi main apni sambhaavnaaon main vruddhi vyavsaay ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 For this, the growth of business is very important
 udyog main bane rahane ke liye prabandh ko sanghathan vikaas kii sambhaavna kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 Business growth can be measured as sales turnover, increase in the number of employees or increase in the number of products or investment of capital, etc

 Whether the organization is a business or a non-business, it has to fulfill some social obligations as it is a part of the society
 iskaa arth he samaaj ke vibhinn angon ke liye anukool aarthik mulyon kii rachana karnaa
 This includes adopting a different environment of production, providing employment opportunities to the deprived sections of the people of the society and providing facilities like school, baby house for the workers 
 aage box main ek nigamit saamaajik daayitv ko puraa karne vaale sanghathan kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he
 The organization consists of people from whom their personality, background, experience and purpose are different

 These vary from financial requirements such as competitive salaries and other benefits to social needs such as peer recognition and higher level needs such as personal growth and development
 prabandh ko sanghathan main talmail ke liye vyaktigat uddeshyon kaa sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon ke saath milan karnaa hota he
 Management is a universal action that is an integral part of any organization
 ab ham un kuch kaarnon kaa adhyayan karenge jiske kaaran prabandh itnaa mahatvapurn ho gaya he- Management is as old as civilization
 yadhyapi aadhunik sanghathan kaa udgam nayaa hi he lekin sangathit kaary to sabhyataa ke pracheen samay se hi hote rahe hai
 In fact the organization can be considered as the distinguishing feature that distinguishes civilized society from uncivilized society
 prabandh ke prarambh ke vyavhaar ve niyam evam kanoon the jo sarkari evam vanijyik kriyaaon ke anubhav se panape
 Principles and practices of management developed with the development of trade and commerce respectively
 ‘prabandh’ shabd aaj kai arthon main prayukt hota he jo isaki prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko ujagar karte hai
 The study of management has developed along with modern organizations in the past
 yah prabandhakon ke anubhav evam aacharan tathaa siddhanton ke sambadh samooh donon par aadhaarit rahaa he
 In the past, it has developed into a dynamic subject
 jisaki apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 But it is necessary to answer a question related to the nature of management whether management is science or art or both
 To answer this, let us study the characteristics of both science and art and see how far the management fulfills them
 kala kya he? kala icchit parinaamon ko paane ke liye vartmaan gyaan kaa vyaktigat evam dakshatapurna upyog he
 It can be obtained through study, observation and experience
 ab kyonki kala kaa sambandh gyaan ke vyaktigat upyog se he isliye adhyayan kiye gaye moolbhoot siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laane ke liye ek prakaar kii moulikta evam rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basic characteristics of art are as follows- kala yah maanakar chalati he ki kuch saidhantik gyaan pehle se he
 Experts in their respective fields have proposed some basic principles that are used in a particular type of art
 udhaaharan ke liye nrity, jan sambodhan / bhaashan, kala athwa sangeet par sahitya sarvamaanya he
 Use of this basic knowledge varies from person to person
 kala, isiilie atyant vyaktigat avadharana he
 For example, two dancers, two speakers, two artists or two writers will differ in the performance of their art
 sabhi kala vyavhaarik hoti hai
 Art is the creative use of knowledge to current principles
 ham jaanate hai ki sangeet saat suron par aadhaarit he
 But the music composition of a musician is unique or different, it depends on how these notes are used in music creation, which is its own interpretation
 prabandh ek kala he kyonki, yah nimna visheshtaon ko puraa karti he- a manager is a hierarchical knowledge group that clarifies any general truths or general principles
 The basic characteristics of science are as follows: vigyaan, gyaan kaa krambaddh samooh he
 Its principles are based on the relation between cause and consequence
 udhaaharan ke liye, ped se seb kaa tuutakar prithvi par aane kii ghatana gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ko janm detii he
 Scientific theories are first developed through observation and then tested and tested under controlled conditions repeatedly
 vaigyanik siddhant, vaidhata evam upyog ke liye saarvbhaumik hote hai
 On the basis of the above characteristics, we can say that as a management science, it has certain characteristics- sabhi prakaar kii sanghathan prakriyaaon kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 You must also have observed that organizations require certain qualifications and experience to manage them
 aapane yah bhi paaya hoga ki ek ore to vyavsaay nigamit swaroop main vruddhi hui he to duusari ore vyavsaay ke prabandh par adhik jor diya ja rahaa he
 Does this mean that management is a profession? To know the answer to this question, let us study the salient features of the profession and see if the management fulfills them
 peshey kii nimna visheshtaayen hai All professions are based on a well-defined set of knowledge that can be acquired through education
 peshey main pravesh, pariksha athwa shaikshanik yogyata ke dwaara simit hoti he
 For example, in India, if one wants to become a Chartered Accountant, one has to pass a special examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
 sabhi peshey kisi na kisi parishad sabha se jude hote hai jo inamen pravesh kaa niyaman karte hai kaary karne ke liye pramaan patr jari karte hai evam aadhaar samhita taiyaar karte hai tathaa usko lagu karte hai
 To advocate in India, lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their actions
 sabhi peshey aachaar samhita se bandhe hai jo unke sadasyon ke vyavhaar ko disha dete hai
 For example, when doctors enter their profession, they take an oath of their work ethic
 peshey kaa mul uddeshy nishtha evam patibaddhta he tathaa apane graahakon ke hiton kii sadhana he
 a lawyer ensures that his client gets justice
 prabandh, peshey ke siddhanton ko puri tarah se puraa nahin karata he
 Well it has some characteristics which are as follows- prabandh ek saarvbhaumik shabd he jise, kisi udhyam main sambandhon ke samooh main ek duusare se jude logon dwaara kuch kaaryon ko karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Everyone has the responsibility to complete a particular task in this chain of relationships
 is uttardaayitv ko puraa karne ke liye use kuch adhikaar die jate hai arthath nirnay lene kaa adhikaar
 This relationship of authority and responsibility binds individuals to each other as officers and subordinates
 isse sanghathan main vibhinn staron kaa nirmaan hota he
 There are three levels in the authority chain of an organization- ucch stareey prabandh-yah sanghathan ke varishthatam kaaryakari adhikari hote hai jinhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa he
 It is commonly known as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Head, Deputy Principal etc
 ucch prabandh, vibhinn kaaryaatmak str ke prabandhakon kii team hoti he
 Their basic task is to keep the overall objectives of the organization in mind, to unify the various elements and harmonize the work of different departments
 ucch str ke ye prabandhak sanghathan ke kalyaan evam nirantarata ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 They analyze the environment of the business and its impact for the life of the firm
 ye apni uplabdhi ke nae sanghathan ke lakshya evam vyuh-rachana ko taiyaar karte hai
 They are responsible for all the functions of business and their impact on society
 ucch prabandh kaa kaary jatil evam tanaavpurn hota he
 It takes a long time, so full commitment to the organization is required
 madhya stareey prabandh- ye ucch prabandhakon evam neeche str ke bich kii kadi hote hai, ye ucch prabandhakon ke adhinsth evam pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke pradhan hote hai
 They are commonly called department heads, operations managers or plant superintendents
 madhya stareey prabandhak, ucch prabandh dwaara viksit niyantran yojanaayen evam vyuh-rachana ke kriyanvayan ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 In addition, they are responsible for all the functions of first-line managers
 inkaa mukhya kaary ucch stareey prabandhakon dwaara taiyaar yojanaon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 For this paryvekshiya athwa prachaalan prabandhak- sanghathan kii adhikaar pankti main forman evam paryvekshak nimna str par aate hai
 Supervisors directly observe the work of the workforce
 inke adhikaar evam karttavya ucch prabandhakon dwaara banaai gai yojanaon dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Supervision, managers have an important role in the organization as they communicate directly with the actual work force and communicate the guidelines of middle level managers to the employees
 inhen ke prayatnon se utpaada kii gunvattta ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he, maal kii haani ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he evam suraksha ke str banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 The quality of workmanship, and mere production, depends on the hard work, discipline and loyalty of the employees
 prabandh ko sanghathan se sadasyon se kaaryon ke niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran evam nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sanghathan ke sansadhano ke prayog kii prakriya mana gaya he
 It is already the task of determining what to do, how and who to do
 iskaa arth he uddeshyon ko pehle se hi nishchit karnaa evam dakshata se evam prabhavi dhang se praapt karne ke liye maarg nirdhaarit karnaa
 The purpose of Suhasini's organization is to buy and sell traditional Indian handloom and handicrafts items
 vah bune hue vastra, sajaavat kaa saamaan, paramparaagat bhartiya kapade se taiyaar vastra evam gharelu saamaan ko bechate hai
 Suhasini takes a decision regarding their quantity, color and texture, then allocates resources from different suppliers for their purchase or preparation in their home
 niyojan samasyao ke paidaa hone se koi roak nahin saktaa lekin inkaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yah jab bhi paidaa hote hai to inako hal karne ke liye aakasmik yojanaayen bana sakati hai
 It manages the task of assigning tasks, dividing tasks into groups, assigning rights and allocation of resources for the implementation of the prescribed plan
 ek baar sanghathan ke uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye vishisht yojana taiyaar kar lee jaati he to phir sanghathan yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye aavashyak kriyaaon evam sansadhano kii jaanch karegaa
 This will determine the necessary tasks and resources
 yah nirnay letaa he ki kis kaary ko koun karegaa, inhen kahan kiya jayega tathaa kab kiya jayega
 Necessary tasks in the organization are divided into the departments and work units capable of management and the relationship of giving rights and details in the authority chain of the organization is determined
 sanghathan ke uchit takanic kaary ke puraa karne evam prachaalan kii kaary kshamta evam parinaamon kii prabhaav purnataa ke sanvardhan main sahaayta karte hai
 Different types of businesses require different frameworks according to the nature of work
 iske sambandh main aap aage ke adhyyon main or adhik padhenge
 In simple terms it means finding the right person for the right job
 prabandh kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sahi yogyata vaale sahi vyaktiyon ko, sahi sthaan evam samay par uplabdh karaane ko sunishchit karnaa he
 It is also called human resource work and includes recruitment, selection, appointment and training of employees
 infosis technology, jo sofratware viksit karti he, ko pranali vishleshankartta evam kaarykram taiyaar karne vaale vyaktiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jabaki labmart ko dizinkartta evam shilpakaaron ke team kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The task of directing is to provide leadership, influence and motivation to the employees so that they can complete the assigned work
 iske liye ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo karmchaariyon ko sarvshereshth dhang se kaary karne ke liye prerit kare
 There are two basic elements of motivation and leadership
 karmchaariyon ko abhiprerit karne kaa arth keval ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karnaa he jo unhen kaary ke liye prerit kare
 Leadership means influencing others in such a way that they perform the desired tasks of their leader
 ek acha prabandhak prashansa evam aalochana kii sahaayta se is prakaar se nirdesan karata he ki karmchaaree apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Suhasini's team of designers developed ravishing colors on silk for bed sheets
 yadhyapi yah bahut lubhaavne lagate the lekin silk ke prayog ke kaaran aam aadmi ke liye yah bahut adhik mahange the
 Praising her work, Suhasini suggested that she keep these silk sheets for special occasions like Deepawali, Christmas and print them regularly on cotton clothes
 niyantran ko prabandh ke kaary ke us rup main paribhaashit kiya he jisamen vah sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sanghathan kaary ke nishpaadan ko nirdeshit karata he
 Levels of execution are determined in the control function, the current performance is measured
 iskaa purvanirdhaarit staron se milan kiya jaataa he or vichlan kii sthiti main sudharatmak kadam uthaae jate hai
 For this, managers have to determine what work and production are important for success, how and where it can be measured and who is authorized to take corrective steps
 suhasini ne jab paaya ki uske dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii vah chadar banaai jo unki vikray ke liye nishchit mulya se adhik mahangi thi tab usne laagat par niyantran ke liye chadar hetu kapadaa hi badal diya
 The various functions of the manager are usually discussed in the above order according to which a manager prepares the plan first; Then creates organization; Thereafter directs; And finally controls
 vastav main prabandhak shaayad hi in kaaryon ko ek-ek karke karata he
 The tasks of the manager are related to each other and it becomes difficult to determine which work ended where and which work started from where
 kisi sanghathan ke prabandhan kii prakriya main ek prabandhak ko paanch ek duusare se sambandhit kaary karne hote hai
 Organization is a system that is made up of interconnected and interconnected subsets
 prabandhak ko in bhinn samoohon ko samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye ek duusare se jodna hota he
 The process of monotony of activities of different departments is called coordination
 samanvay vah shakti he jo, prabandh ke anya sabhi kaaryon ko ek duusare se baandhti he
 It is a thread that threads all functions such as purchasing, production, sales and finance to maintain consistency in the work of the organization
 samanvay ko kabhi-kabhi prabandh kaa ek alag se kaary mana jaataa he
 But it is the essence of management because it brings unity in individual efforts to achieve collective goals
 prayek prabandhkeey kaary ek aisi gatividhi he jo swayan akeli samanvay main sahyog karti he
 Coordination is targeted and embedded in all the functions of any organization
 sanghathan kii kriyaaon ke samanvay kii prakriya, niyojan se hi prarambh ho jaati he
 Higher management plans for the entire organization
 in yojanaon ke anusaar sanghathan dhaanchon ko viksit kiya jaataa he evam karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 Implementation of schemes is required according to plan to ensure that guidance is required
 vaastavik kriyaaon evam unki uplabdhiyon main yadi koi matbhed he to iskaa niraakaran niyantran ke samay kiya jaataa he
 Through the process of co-ordination, the management makes proper arrangements for individual and collective efforts to ensure unity in the steps taken to achieve the same objectives, the co-ordination will unify the different functions and efforts of different units of the organization
 is
 yah prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa raashi, maatr, samay evam krambaddhata uplabdh karaata he jo niojit uddeshyon ko nunatam virodhabhas, praapt karne ko sunishchit karata he
 The following characteristics of coordination are clear from the above definitions- samanvay samuhik kaaryon main ekaatmakataa laata he- samanvay aise hiton ko jo ek duusare se sambandhit nahin hai yaa ek duusare se bhinn hai uddeshy purna kaary gatividhi main ekta laata he
 It provides a focal point to the group's actions, which ensures that the execution is in accordance with the plan and schedule
 samanvay kaarywahi main ekta laata he- samanvay kaa uddeshy samaan uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kaarywahi main ekta laana he
 It serves as the power to connect various departments and ensures that all actions are taken to achieve the goals of the organization
 aapane paaya ki labmart ke utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ko apane kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he jisase ki bazaar kii maang ke anusaar utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Coordination is a continuous process - Coordination is not a one-time function but a continuous process
 yah niyojan se prarambh hota he evam niyantran tak chalati he
 Suhasini makes a plan regarding clothes for winter time in the month of June itself
 tatpashchaat vah paryaapt kaarybal kii vyavastha karti he
 According to the production plan, it is constantly monitored for this, it will have to tell its marketing department in time to prepare for the promotion of sales promotion and advertising
 samanvay sarvyaapee kaary he- vibhinn vibhaagon kii kriyaayein prakruti se ek duusare par nirbhar karti hai isiilie samanvay kii aavashyaktaa prabandh ke sabhi staron par hoti he
 It establishes unity in various departments and functions at different levels
 sanghathan ke uddeshy bana virodh aa sake, praapt karne ke liye suhasini ko kray, utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he
 The task of purchasing department is to buy cloth
 yah utpaadan vibhaag kii kriyaaon ke liye aadhaar ban jaataa he or ant main vikray sambhav ho paata he
 If the fabric is of inferior quality or does not have the specifications prescribed by the production department, then further sales will be reduced
 yadi samanvay nahin he to kriyaaon main ekta evam ekikaran ke sthaan par punrariti evam avyavashtha hogi
 Coordination is the responsibility of all managers - coordination is the task of every manager in any organization
 Higher level managers coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the organization's policies are implemented
 madhyastar ke prabandhak, ucchstar ke prabandhakon evam pratham pankti ke prabandhakon, donon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Operations level managers coordinate the tasks of their employees to ensure that the work is done according to plans
 samanvay sochaa-samajha kaary he- ek prabandhak ko vibhinn logon ke kaaryon kaa dhyanpurvak evam soch samajhakar samanvay karnaa hota he
 In a department, members work voluntarily in cooperation with each other, coordination coordinates this spirit of cooperation
 samanvay ke na hone par sahyog bhi nirarthak siddh hoga or bina sahyog ke samanvay karmchaariyon main asantosh ko hi janm degaa
 Therefore we can say that coordination is not a separate function of management but it is its essence
 yadi koi sanghathan apane uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se praapt karnaa chahta he to use samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Coordination is an integral part of all the functions of coordination in the same way as the thread in the rosary
 vibhinn prabandhkeey kaaryon ko ekikrut karnaa vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon main paryaapt maatr main samanvay ko sunishchit karata he
 As such, the constant change inherent in a large-scale organization due to coordination problems is weak or passive leadership and complexities
 bade sanghathanon main is prakaar kii jatiltaaon ke samanvay ke liye vishesh prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Size of organization - Large number of people engaged in large organizations complicate the problem of coordination
 prayek vyakti apane aap main vishisht he
 And realizes the needs of himself and the organization
 prayek kii apni kaary karne kii aadaten hai, apni prishthbhumi hai, paristhitiyon se nipatane ke prastaav / tareeke hai tathaa dusron se sambandh hai
 By the way, a single person does not always act wisely
 uske vyavhaar ko na to sadaa thik se samajha jaataa he or na hi puri tarah se uskaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, for the efficiency of the organization, it is essential that the objectives of the individual and the group are integrated by coordination
 kaaryaatmak vibhedikaran- sanghathan ke kaaryon ko baar-baar vibhaagon, prabhaagon, virgon aadi main baanta jaataa he
 The problem of coordination arises because the jurisdiction becomes stronger and the barriers between them become even stronger
 kai baar yah isliye hota he kyonki kaaryon kaa vargeekaran yukti sangat nahin hota yaa phir prabandhak tark sangat maarg na apana kar anubhav kaa maarg apanaate hai
 In such cases, coordination is necessary to function effectively in the organization
 vishishtikaran- aadhunik sanghathanon main ucch str kaa vishishtikaran he
 Specialization is born due to the intricacies and functions of modern technologies and the diversity of those who do them
 visheshgy sochate hai ki ve ek duusare ko peshey ke aadhaar par jaanchne ke yogya hai lekin duusare logon ke paas is prakaar ke nirnay kaa koi paryaapt aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 If experts are allowed to work without coordination in front of a global manager, the results will be very expensive
 isiilie sanghathan main lage vibhinn visheshgyon ke kaaryon main samanvay hetu ek rachana tantra kii aavashyaktaa he
 Coordination is the essence of management
 yah kuch aisa nahin he taki jiske liye ek prabandhak aadesh de
 Rather it is something that a manager tries to achieve by planning, organizing, appointing, directing control tasks
 atah prayek kaary samanvay kaa abhyaas he
 Organization and their management is changing
 jaise-jaise vibhinn samskritiyon evam deshon kii seemayen dhundhlee pad rahi hai evam sampreshan kii nayi-nayi takneekon ke kaaran vishwa ko ek vaishvik gaanv samajha ja saktaa he
 International and intercultural relations are also growing rapidly
 aaj kaa sanghathan ek vaishvik sanghathan he jiskaa prabandh bhumandaleey paridrishy main kiya jaataa he
 In summary, one can say that a global manager is one who has both 'hard' and 'soft' skills
 jo prabandhak vishleshan karnaa, vyuharachna karnaa, ejineering evam praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhte hai unki aaj bhi aavashyaktaa he lekin vishwavyaapee safalataa ke liye vyaktiyon main team kaise kaary karti he, sanghathan kaise kaary karte hai evam logon ko kis prakaar se abhiprerit kar saktaa he, is sabaki samaj kaa hona bahut aavashyak he
 For example, a manager who has access to different cultures can work in Western Europe, a non-english speaking country, then move to developing countries like Malaysia or Kenya and then to an office in New York, USA
 Can be transferred
 vah in teenon sthanon par turant prabhavi dhang se kaary kar sakegaa
 The role of global manager has evolved in the same way that global industry and economy have developed
 yah ek paribhaashit vyavsaay ke sandarbh main ek aiami bhoomika se bahuaiami bhoomika main parivartit ho gaya he jiske liye takneekee kaushal, sofrat prabandh evam kaushal evam vibhinn samskritiyon ko grahan karnaa evam seekhney ke sammishran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 Saadat Khan wrested the power of the local kings in the Gorakhpur region and in the beginning he launched a campaign against Tilaksen of the Butkal Gharana who was terrorizing the present Maharajganj area, but in this task he could not get complete success
 19 march 1739 ko saadat khan kii mrityu ho gayi tathaa safadarajang avadh kaa nawab bana
 He sent an army to the northern part of the then Gorakhpur, who defeated the son of Tilaksen of Butwal and recovered the money presented to him

 faltah 10 navambar 1801 ko nawab ne company ke karj se mukti hetu katipay anya kshetron ke saath-saath gorakhpur kshetra ko bhi company ko de diya
 As a result of this treaty, the area of present Maharajganj also went to the company

 Wood could not succeed in defeating them

 Due to his wavering policy, Gorkha continued to raid the entire region and make the lives of citizens quintessential
 yahaan tak ki wood ne 17 april 1815 ko butwal par kai ghante tak golabari kii kintu uskaa apekshit parinaam nahin niklaa
 Thereafter, a second campaign to liberate the Terai region from the Gorkhas was launched under the leadership of Colonel Nicholas
