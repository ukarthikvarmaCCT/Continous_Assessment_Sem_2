 inaki rachanaaon kii visheshta lok-vaani kaa adbhut prayog rahi he jisase janamanas par inkaa amit prabhaav padataa he
 The voice of the sweet and simple sage Shiromani Raidas is like a bridge between the knowledgeable and the romantic branches
 prachinkaal se hi bharat main vibhinn dharmon tathaa maton ke anuyaayi nivas karte rahe hai
 In all these, the saints have contributed significantly from time to time to increase harmony and brotherhood
 aise santon main shiromani raidas kaa naam agraganya he
 He was Gurubhai of Sant Kabir because he also had Guru Swami Ramanand
 inaki yaad main magh purna ko ravidaas jayanti manaai jaati hai
 Guru Ravidas ji was born in Kashi
 unke pita kaa naam santokh das or mata kaa naam kalsa devi bataaya jaataa he
 Raidas had gained sufficient practical knowledge from the association of saints and saints
 juute banane kaa kaam unka paitruk vyavsaay tha or unhone ise saharsha apanaaya
 They used to do their work with utmost diligence and diligence and paid lot of attention to completing the work on time
 unki samyanupaalan kii pravriti tathaa madhur vyavhaar ke kaaran unke sampark main aane vaale log bhi bahut prasann rahete the
 Ravidas ji was very benevolent and kind from the beginning and it became his nature to help others
 sadhu-santon kii sahaayta karne main unako vishesh anand miltaa tha
 They used to give them shoes without paying any price
 unke swabhaav ke kaaran unke mata-pita unase aprasann rahete the
 After some time he drove Ravidas and his wife away from their home
 ravidaas ji pados main hi apane liye ek alag imaarat banaakar tatparta se apane vyavsaay kaa kaam karte the or shesh samay ishwar-bhajan tathaa sadhu-santon ke satsang main vyateet karte the
 The small events of his life reveal his qualities related to the observance of time and speech
 ek baar ek parv ke avasar par pados ke log ganga-snaan ke liye ja rahe the
 When one of the disciples of Raidas urged them to walk too, they said, i must walk for Ganga-bathing, but today i have promised to make shoes for a person
 yadi main use aaj juute nahin de sakaa to vachan bhang hoga
 When Ganga goes to bathe, if the mind remains here then how will it attain virtue? It is advisable to do whatever the mind is prepared to do with the inner conscience
 man sahi he to ise kathaute ke jal main hi gangasnan kaa punya praapt ho saktaa he
 It is said that after this kind of practice, the proverb became popular - that if the mind is healed, the Ganges is in disarray
 raidas ne oonch-neech kii bhaavana tathaa ishwar-bhakthi ke naam par kiye jane vaale vivaad ko saraheen tathaa nirarthak bataaya or sabko paraspar miljul kar prempurvak rahane kaa upadesh diya
 He himself composed melodious and devotional hymns and used to recite them passionately
 unka vishwaas tha ki ram, krishna, kareem, raghav aadi sab ek hi parameshwar ke vividh naam hai
 In the Vedas, Quran, Puranas etc
 the same God is praised
 krisn, kareem, ram, hari, raghav, jab lag ek na pekha
 Ved Qateb saw Quran, Puranan, Sahaj one
 
 He believed that devotion to God, observance of virtue, goodwill and good behavior is essential
 abhimaan tyaag kar dusron ke saath vyavhaar karne or vinamrata tathaa shishtataa ke gunon kaa vikaas karne par unhone bahut bal diya
 In one of his hymns, he has said- kah raidas teri bhagati doori he, bhaag bade so paavai
 On the public pride mete, the public is selected
 unke vichaaron kaa aashay yahi he ki ishwar kii bhakthi bade bhagya se praapt hoti he
 a person working without pride is successful in life, as the giant elephant is unable to pick up the sugar particles, while the small body papilla easily selects these particles
 isi prakaar abhimaan tathaa badppan kaa bhav tyaag kar vinamratapurvak aacharan karne vaala manushya hi ishwar kaa bhakt ho saktaa he
 Raidas's voice was filled with true feelings of devotion, desire for the larger interest of society and human love
 isliye uskaa shrotaaon ke man par gaharaa prabhaav padataa tha
 His hymns and sermons gave people such education that a satisfactory solution to their doubts was made and people automatically became their followers
 unki vaani kaa itnaa vyapak prabhaav padaa ki samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke log unke prati shraddhalu ban gayi
 It is said that Meerabai was very impressed by his devotion and became his disciple
 varnashram abhimaan taji, pad raj bandahijasu kii
 doubt-granth khandan-nipan, Bani Vimul Raidas
 
 Even today the teachings of Sant Raidas are very important for the welfare and upliftment of the society
 unhone apane aacharan tathaa vyavhaar se yah pramanit kar diya he ki manushya apane janm tathaa vyavsaay ke aadhaar par mahaan nahin hota he
 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai
 Raidas Manush could not join till caste was formed

 The classification of Meteneus is as follows: osmudesii - ise royal fern bhi kehete hen
 It has only two genus and 17 species
 is jati kaa osmonda har sthaan par or todia austrailia yaa dakshin africa main paaya jaat he

 shikharji yaa shri shikharji yaa parasnath parvat bharat ke jharkhand rajya ke giridih zile main chota nagpur pathaar par sthit ek pahari he jo vishwa kaa sabase mahatvapurn jain tirth sthal bhi he
 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism attained salvation in this saintly region known as 'shri Sammed Shikharji'
 yaheen 23 wein tirthakar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi nirvana praapt kiya tha
 It is believed that 20 of the 24 Jains attained salvation
 1,350 meter unchaa yah pahaad jharkhand kaa sabase ooncha sthaan bhi he
 Shikharji is an important pilgrimage site for the followers of Jainism
 parasnath parvat vishwa prasiddh he

 sammed shikhar jain dharm ko maanane waalon kaa ek pramukh tirth sthaan he
 It is considered to be the best among Jain pilgrimages
 jain dharamshastron ke anusaar jain dharm ke 24 main se 20 tirthankarasn or anek santon va muniyon ne yahan moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore it is called 'siddhakshetra' and in Jainism it is called Tirtharaj i
e
 'king of Tirthas'
 yah tirth bharat ke jharkhand pradesh ke giridih jile main madhuban kshetra main sthit he
 It is the main pilgrimage of Jainism
 ise 'parasnath parvat' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jain texts, the existence of both Samamed Shikhar and Ayodhya is parallel to creation
 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he
 All this is possible only when all the devotees here remember the Tirthankaras and follow the teachings, teachings and principles given by them with pure conduct
 is prakaar yah kshetra bahut pavitra mana jaataa he
 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance
 jain niti shastron main varnan he ki jain dharm ke 24 tirthankarasn main se pratham tirthankar bhagwaan 'adinath' arthath bhagwaan rishabhdev ne kailash parvat par, 12wein tirthankar bhagwaan vasupujya ne champapuri, 22wein tirthankar bhagwaan neminath ne girnaar parvat or 24wein or antim tirthankar bhagwaan mahavir ne pavapuri main moksh praapt kiya
 The remaining 20 Tirthankaras attained salvation at Sammed Shikhar
 jain dharm ke 23wein tirthankar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi isi tirth main kathor tap or dhyaan dwaara moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore, the Tonk of Lord Parshvanath is situated on this peak

 -- mahatma gandhi, satya ke prayog, aatmakatha The main three elements in India's ancient education system can be considered - yahi gurukul shiksha-pranali kaa mul rup he
 In the dark India of the 19th century, sage Dayanand's country was very extensive among the nobles who awakened the light of awakening
 ve yug-pravartak rishi the, jinhone shiksha, raajnneeti, samaaj-sanghathan aadi sab kshetron main nae vichaaron kaa sandesh diya
 Rishi Dayanand experienced many defects in the education system prevalent in his time and presented the ancient Arya education system
 rishi ne use 'gurukul shiksha-pranali' kaa naam diya
 There were mainly two systems of education prevalent in India during his time - one was started by the British rulers of India and the other was prevalent in the Pandit congregation according to the old tradition
 sarkaar dwaara prachlit pranali bharat ke rashtriya tathaa dharmik aadarshon kepratikul thi
 In it, the language, religion, civilization, literature and culture of India were completely ignored
 pandit mandali kii shiksha-paddati samay kii aavashyaktaaon ko purna nahin karti thi usamen vartmaan yug ke gyaan-vigyaanon ko koi sthaan praapt nahin hi tha vah paakhandon kaa poshan karti thi
 The ideals that are required for character building, celibacy, renunciation, asceticism, etc
 were not important in both systems
 rishi dayanand ne anubhav kiya ki bharat main pracheen gurukul pranali kaa punaruddhar kar in dosha ko dur kiya janaa chahie
 He presented the ideals and principles of education in the third community of 'satyarth Prakash' - Undoubtedly, the thoughts of Rishi Dayanand were very revolutionary ideas in the field of education
 rishi dayanand ke ek pramukh shishy mahatma munshi ram ne san 1897 main unhone gurukul ko prarambh karne kii aavashyaktaa ke nimnlikhit kaaran bataae - In the 19th century, two types of education were prevalent in India
 pehali paddati british sarkaar dwaara apane shashan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye viksit kii gai sarkari skulon or vishvavidhyalayon kii pranali thi or duusari sanskrit, vyakaran, darshan aadi bhartiya vaanmay kii vibhinn vidyaon ko pracheen paramparaagat vidhi se adhyayan karne kii paathshaala paddati
 There were some serious flaws in both methods
 pehali paddati main paurasty gyanvigyaan kii ghor apeksha thi or yah sarvatha arashtriya thi
 Lord Macaulay, who was an ardent proponent of this and enforced it by his well-known memorial in 1835, believed that 'the importance of books lying in one of the almari of a good European library was equal to the entire literature of India and Arabia'
 at: sarkari shiksha paddati main bhartiya vaanmay kii ghor upeksha karte hue angreji tathaa paashchaatya sahitya or gyaan vigyaan ke adhyayan par bal diya gaya
 The main objective of this education system was, in Macaulay's words, 'to create a group of Indians who are Indian in color and blood, but English in terms of interest, temper and pickle'
 isliye yah shikshapaddati bharat ke rashtriya or dharmik aadarshon ke pratikul thi
 The second education system was the school system practiced in Panditamandali
 isamen yadhyapi bhartiya vaanmay kaa adhyayan karaayaa jaataa tha, tathaapi usamen naveen tathaa vartmaan samay ke liye aavashyak gyaan vigyaan kii ghor upeksha thi
 At that time the great need of the country was to develop a national education system in harmony with the excellent elements of both education systems while coordinating the puerile and western knowledge science
 is mahatvapurn kaary kaa sampann karne main gurukul kongdi ne bada sahyog diya
 Mahatma Munshiram, the founder of the Gurukul, was greatly influenced by the educational ideas propounded in the famous book 'satyarth Prakash' by Maharishi Dayanand, the originator of the Aryasamaj, who had extraordinary significance in the Indian cultural renaissance of the last century
 unhone 1897 main apane patr 'saddharm prachaarak' dwaara gurukul shiksha pranali ke punarudwar kaa prabal andolan aarambh kiya
 On 30 October 1898, he laid out a detailed plan for it
 november, 1898 i
 main punjab ke aryasamaajon ke kendriya sanghathan arya pratinidhi sabha ne gurukul kholane kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya or mahatma munshiram ne yah pratigya kii ki ve is kaary ke liye, jab tak 30,000 rupaya ekatra nahin kar lenge, tab tak apane ghar main pair nahin rakhenge
 Under the circumstances, he completed this daunting task in eight months with his relentless industry and unwavering loyalty
 16 may 1900 ko punjab ke gujaranvaala sthaan par ek vaidic paathshaala ke saath gurukul kii sthapana kar di gai
 But Mahatma Munshiram did not find this place suitable
 ve shukla yajurveda ke ek mantra 'uphvare girinan sangame c nadinaan
 According to Dhia Wipro Ajayat 'they wanted a place near river and mountain
 isi samay nazibabad ke dharmanishth rais munshi amansingh ji ne is kaary ke liye mahatma munshiram ji ko 1,200 bighas kaa apana kangri gram daan diya
 The Kangri land surrounded by densely forested forests on the banks of the Ganges in the Himalayas was ideal for Gurukuls
 at: yahan ghaney jangal saaf kar kuch chappar banaae gaye or holi ke din somvaar, 4 march 1902 ko gurukul gujaranvaala se kangri laayaa gaya
 The Gurukul was started in some thatched huts with 34 students
 punjab kii arya janata ke udaar daan or sahyog se iskaa vikaas teevr gati se hone laga
 Its college department started in 1907 AD
 1912 i
 main gurukul kangri se shiksha samaapt kar nikalne vaale snaatakon kaa pehla dikshant samaaroh hua
 At this time, the British government considered it a seditious institution for a long time, being completely independent from the influence of the government

 In 1921, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha decided to build Vedas, Ayurveda, Agriculture and Ordinary Colleges to expand it
 1923 i
 main mahavidhyalay kii shiksha or pariksha vishyak vyavastha ke liye ek shikshapatal banaaya gaya
 Taking inspiration from it in different parts of the country, many gurukuls following its ideals and curriculum were established

 In 1935 AD, a separate Vidyasabha was organized to manage it under Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab
 gurukul shiksha paddati kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai- vidhyaarthiyon kaa guruon ke sampark main, unke kul yaa parivaar kaa ang banakar rahanaa, bahmacharyapurvak saral evam tapasyamay jivan bitaana, charitranirmaan or shaareerik vikaas par bauddhik evam maansik vikaas kii bhanti puraa dhyaan dena, shiksha main sanskrit ko anivaary bananaa, vaidic vaanmay ke adhyayan par bal dena, shiksha kaa madhyak maatrubhaasha hindi ko bananaa, sanskrit, darshan, veda aadi pracheen vishyon ke adhyayan ke saath aadhunik paashchaatya gyaan vigyaan or angreji kii padhai tathaa rashtriyata kii bhaavana
 Nowadays these characteristics have become universally accepted, but at the beginning of this century all these ideas were completely revolutionary, new and original
 gurukul shiksha kii katipay visheshtaayen nimnlikhit he: From the very beginning, all subjects were taught in Hindi through Hindi medium
 vigyaan, ganit, paashchaatya darshan aadi vishay bhi hindi main hi padhaaye jate the
 When the college department opened in 1907, Hindi was kept as a medium
 us samay hindi main ucch shiksha dena ek asambhav baat samajhi jaati thi
 Gurukul showed this by turning it into action
 us samay aadhunik vidwaanon kii pustaken hindi main nahin thi
 The Gurukul students first worked in this field and many Gurukul texts were published
 pro maheshacharan singh kii 'hindi chemistry', pro saathe kaa 'vikaswad', shriyut govardhan kii 'bhautikee' or 'rasayan' pro ramshrandas saxena kaa 'gunatmak vishleshan', pro sinha kaa 'vanaspatishaastra' pro prannath kaa 'arthshaastra', 'rashtriya aay-vyay shaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', pro baalkrishna kaa 'arthshaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', or pro sudhakar kaa 'manovigyaan' hindi main apane-apane vishay ke pehle granth hai
 The creation of scientific texts in Hindi was started by Gurukul
 in vaigyanik granthon ke atirikt anya bhi bahut se ucchkoti ke granth gurukul dwaara prakashit hue
 Prof
 Ramdev did his basic research on Indian history and published his famous 'history of India'
 mahatma munshi raamji ne bhi vividh dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kar moulik granth likhe
 In 1918, the President of the University of Calcutta, Dr
 Sadler, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, visited Gurukul
 gurukul kaa avlokan karke ve bahut prabhavit hue
 He expressed his views regarding Gurukul in one of his letters - us yug ke ek prasiddh vidwaan shri nivas shastri ucch shiksha ke madhyam ke rup main angreji ke k͠r samarthak the, par gurukul kaa kaary santoshprad paane par unhone kaha - 'meraa apana vichaar yah rahaa he ki vidhyalay vibhaag main shiksha kaa madhyam bhartiya bhashaayen hi rahani chahie, parantu mahavidhyalay vibhaag kii padhai angreji ke madhyam dwaara honi chahie
 But now seeing the Gurukul, i am moving away from this idea of mine
 maikale ke baad bharat main shiksha ke kshetra main jo sabase mahatvapurn or moulik praytn hua, vah gurukul he - remje macdnold The great curiosity of Gurukul Kangri was to make these ideas acceptable by his functional test
 pehle yah asambhav samajha jaataa tha ki hindi ucch shiksha evam vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan adhyaapan kaa madhyam ban sakati he
 Gurukul first made this idea possible in modern India through his trial
 yahan adhyapakon tathaa praadhyaapakon ne rasayan, bhautik vigyaan, vanaspati shaastra, manovigyaan, vikaswad aadi vishyon par hindi main pehali pustaken likhin
 The scientific writing of Hindi got a great boost from the fact that Gurukul Kangdi made Hindi a medium for education in all subjects including science and accordingly 17 books were also implemented
 maatrubhaasha dwaara shiksha ke is pareekshan ko dekhne ke liye 1918 i

 The Gurukul participated prominently in all national and social reform movements
 hindi sahitya ko anek yashasvi patrkaar, lekhak or saahitiyik pradaan kiye
 The practice of Sanskrit and Vedic poetry gave special encouragement to teaching and learning
 is gurukul se nikle hue snaatak hindi ke pratham shrenee ke lekhak siddh hue or unhone hindi ko mahamoolyawaan sahitya diya
 Prominent among them were Indra Vidyavachaspati, Prannath Vidyalankar, Satyaketu Vidyalankar, Jaydev Sharma Vidyalankar, Jayachand Vidyalankar, Chandragupta Vedalankar and Acharya Ramdev
 samprati gurukul kangri main vedavedang, sanskrit, darshanashastra, itihaas, raajnneeti, ayurveda, krishi tathaa vaigyanik vishyon kii ucch shiksha kaa prabandh he

 This university has three campuses- biodijal jaivik sroton se praapt tathaa dijal ke samatuly indhan he jo paramparaagat dijal injanon ko bina parivartit kiye hi chalaa saktaa he
 India's first biodiesel plant has been set up at Kakinada SEZ in collaboration with Australia biodijal shat-pratishat navinikarniya sroton se banaaya jaataa he
 It is a clean alternative to conventional fuels
 isko bhavishya kaa indhan mana ja rahaa he
 Biodiesel does not contain petroleum, but it can be used in different types of vehicles by mixing it in petroleum in a reasonable proportion
 biodijal vishaiylla nahi hota; yah biodegradable bhi he
 Biodiesel is different from other alternative fuels derived from vegetable oils
 biodijal ko bina kisi parivartan kiye hi dijal injanon main prayog kar sakate hai jabaki vanaspati telon se praapt indhanon ko keval 'ignishan kambasshan' vaale injanon main hi prayog laa sakate hai or vah bhi kuch parivartanon ke baad
 For this reason, biodiesel is one of the easiest fuels to use
 or sabase acchhee baat yah he ki kheti main kaam aane vaale upkarnon ko chalaane ke liye sabase upyukt he
 The process by which a biodiesel is produced is called trans-esterification
 is prakriya main vanaspati tel yaa vasa se glicrin ko nikaalnaa hota he
 By-products like methyl ester and glycerin are also found in this process
 biodijal main sulfur or aromatics nahin hote jo ki paramparaagat indhanon main paye jate hai
 The best thing about biodiesel is that it is not harmful to the environment like other fuels
 iske alaava yah aise sroton se praapt hota he jo punah naveen kiye ja sakate hai
 It does not produce polluting fumes like conventional fuels

 4 june 2010 ko bhartiya raksha mantralay or zvejadochka shipyard ke madhya pandubbi ke unnayan or jirnoddhar ke liye america $8 karod kaa samjhauta hua tha
 The submarine had suffered two fire incidents, the first minor incident in 2010 and the second on 14 August 2013 at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai in which it sank
 sindhurakshak shrenee kii is deazal-electric pandubbi ko rus main banaaya gaya tha or 24 disambar 1997 ko bhartiya nausena main shaamil kiya gaya tha

 shri ramcharita maanas ke nayak ram hai jinako ek mahashakti ke rup main darshaya gaya he jabaki maharishi valmiki krit ramayana main shri ram ko ek maanav ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 Lord Rama of Tulsi, despite being omnipotent, is a modest Purushottam
 treta yug main hue aitihaasik ram-ravan yuddh par aadhaarit or hindi kii hi ek lokapriy bhashaa avadhi main rachit ramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Ramcharit Manas is an epic written by 15th-century poet Goswami Tulsidas
 jaisaa tulsidas ne ramcharita maanas ke balkand main swayan likhaa he ki unhone ramcharita maanas kii rachana kaa armbh ayodhya main vikram samvath 1631 ko ramanavami ke din kiya tha
 According to Sri Hanuman Prasad Poddar of Gitapress Gorakhpur, Goswami Tulsidas ji took 2 years 7 months 26 days to write Ramcharitmanas and he completed it on the day of Ram Marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksha of Samvat 1633
 is mahakavy kii bhashaa avadhi he jo hindi kii hi ek shakha he
 In Ramcharitmanas, Goswami Tulsidas has described the serene and vivid character of Shri Ramchandra

 kai varsh tapasya karne ke baad shankaraji ne swayan parvati se kaha ki main, brahma or vishnu kai baar manu satarupa ke paas var dene ke liye aaye, jiskaa ullekh tulsi das ji dwaara rachit ramcharitamanas main is prakaar miltaa he- "bidhi hari har tap dekhi apaara, manu sameep aaye bahu baaraa"
 As the above-mentioned quadrant shows, these people have come many times to say that whatever groom you want to ask, ask for it; But Manu Satarupa had to ask for Parambrahma himself as a son, then how could he ask for a boon from Shankar, Brahma and Vishnu? Our Lord Shri Ram is omniscient
 ve bhakt ke hryday kii abhilaashaa ko swat: hi jaan lete hai
 When 23 thousand more years have passed, the sky is uttered by Prabhu Shriram- "prabhu Sarbagya dasa nij jani, motion exclusive tapas nripa rani
 maangu maangu baru bhai nabh bani, param gambheer kripamrita sani
 
 " is akaash vaani ko jab manu satarupa sunate hai to unka hryday prafullit ho uthta he
 And when Parambrahma Rama himself appears, praising him, Manu and Satarupa say- “sunu sevak surtaru suradhenu, Bidhi hari har bandit pada renu
 sevat sulabh sakal sukhadaayak, prantapal sachrachar nayak
" arthath jinke charnon kii vandana vidhi, hari or har yani brahma, vishnu or mahesh teenon hi karte he, tathaa jinke swaroop kii prashansa sagun or nirgun donon karte hai: unase ve kya var maangen? is baat kaa ullekh karke tulsi baba ne un logon ko bhi ram kii hi aradhana karne kii salaah di he jo keval niraakaar ko hi parambrahm maanate hai
 The panchayati raj system of India consists of a gram panchayat or gram sabha at the village or small town level, which is a major component of the local self-government of India
 sarpanch, gram sabha kaa chunaa hua sarvocch pratinidhi hota he
 Panchayats have been important in the social, political and economic life of India since ancient times
 saarvajanik jivan kaa prayek pahalu isi ke dwaara sanchalit hota tha
 Panchayats also existed in the Vedic period
 gram ke pramukh ko gramani kehete the
 This was also done in the later Vedic period through which the king ruled the village
 baudhdhakalin gramparishad main "gram vruddh" sammilit hote the
 Their chief was called "grambhojkaar"
 parishad athwa panchayat gram kii bhoomi kii vyavastha karti thi tathaa gram main shanti or suraksha banaae rakhane main grambhojak kii sahaayta karti thi
 She also used to edit other public interest works
 smriti granthon main bhi panchayat kaa ullekh he
 Kautilya considered the village a political entity
 "arthshaastra" kaa "graamic" gram kaa pramukh hota tha jise kitne hi adhikaar praapt the
 He used to assist the villagers in carrying out their public duties
 saarvajanik hit ke anya kaaryon main bhi gramvaasiyon kaa sahyog vaanchhneeya tha
 There was also a public fund of the village in which money came from fines, penalties etc
 is prakaar graamic or grampanchayat ke adhikaar or kartavya sammilit the jinaki avhelnaa dandaneey thi
 In the Gupta period, the village was the smallest unit of governance, whose head was called "gramik"
 vah "panchmandal" athwa panchayat kii sahaayta se gram kaa shashan chalaata tha
 The "gram Vriddhas" were members of this panchayat
 harsh ne bhi isi vyavastha ko apanaaya
 In his time, the state was divided into "bhukti", "subject" and "village"
 harsh ke madhuban shilaalekh main samkundaka gram kaa ullekh he jo "kundaghani" vishay or "ahichhatra" bhukti ke antargat tha
 Grampramukh was called Gramik
 naveen or dasvin shatabdi ke chol or uttar mallur shilalekhon se pataa chalata he ki dakshin main bhi panchayat vyavastha thi
 The development of rural self-government was the main feature of Chola rule
 in samya shashan ikaayiyon ko "kurrum" kehete the, jinamein kai gram sammilit hote the
 Kurrum was an autonomous unit
 shashansatta ek mahasabha main nihit hoti thi jile gram ke log chunate the sabha apni samitiyon ke madhyam se shashan kaa kaam chalaati thi
 There were eight such committees which were responsible for maintaining peace and security in addition to performing various functions of public interest
 ye nyaay sambandhi kaary bhi karti thim
 The village was completely autonomous and thus the central government was free from many responsibilities
 muslim or maratha kaalon main bhi kisi na kisi prakaar kii panchayat vyavastha chalati rahi or prayek gram apane main swaavlambee bana rahaa
 During the British rule, the panchayat system got the biggest shock and this system became disjointed
 phir bhi graamon ke saamaajik jivan main panchayatein bani raheen
 Each caste or class had its own separate panchayats which governed its social life and those who violated the system and rules of the panchayat were severely punished
 shashan kii ore se in panchayaton ke kaaryon main hastkshep nahin kiya jaataa tha
 From the beginning, the policy of the British was that the work of governance should, as much as possible, remain in the hands of as many state employees
 iske parinamswaroop faujadaari or divaani adaalaton kii sthapana, naveen rajasav niti, police vyavastha, gamnaagaman ke sadhano kaa vikaas aadi kaarnon se graamon kaa swaavlambee jivan or sthaneey swaittata dhire-dhire samaapt ho chali
 But later on the British also realized that due to their policy of centralization, the governance burden is increasing day by day
 duusari ore rashtriya jagrati ke kaaran swaittashasan kii maang bhi bad rahi thi
 Hence they were forced to take steps towards decentralization
 prarambh main jila bordon or municipal bordon kii sthapana kii gai
 The Royal Commission on Decentralization of 1907 acknowledged the importance of panchayats and wrote in its report that the foundation of any permanent organization, so that the active cooperation of the public with the administration should be in the villages
 kamishan ne sifarish kii ki kuch chune hue graamon main, jo parsparik dalbandi or jhagadon se mukt hon, panchayatein sthapit kii jaaen or prarambh main unhen simit adhikaar die jaaen
 In 1915, the then Government of India accepted the recommendations of the commission in principle, but in practice they were completely ignored
 bahut hi kam graamon main panchayatein bani; jo baniin, ve bhi sarkaar dwaara puri tarah niyantrit thi
 According to the Government of India Act in 1919, the provincial governments were given certain powers of self-government and around 1920 the Gram Panchayat Acts were enacted in all the provinces
 sanyukt pradesh main 1920 ke panchayat act ke adheen lagbhag 4700 gram panchayatein sthapit kii gayi
 Panchayats were given limited powers in all the provinces
 ve janaswasthya, swatchta, chikitsa, jalavikas, sadakon, talabon kuon aadi kii dekhbhaal karti thim
 He also had some judicial rights
 ve adhiktam 200 ru
 kii chal sampatti se sambhddha mukademe le sakati thim or faujadaari ke mukademon main 50 ru
 tak jurmaana kar sakati thim
 Their main means of income were fines or donations
 parantu vaastaviktaa yah rahi ki pracheen panchayaton kii tulana main ye panchayatein purnataya prabhaavaheen thim, inke panch janata dwaara na chune jaakar sarkaar dwaara manonith kiye jate the tathaa aay ke saadhan na hone ke karan inaki aarthik sthiti shochaneey thi
 On the other hand, the masters of the national movement felt that the economic and moral decline of the villages could be prevented only by the re-establishment of the panchayats
 gandhi ji ke graamon ke liye dassutri kaarykram main panchayaton ko sudrudh banane kii baat mukhya thi
