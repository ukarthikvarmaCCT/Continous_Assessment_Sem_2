 But everyone claims to take credit for the victory and the head has been on the lookout for the loss of the election
 bhartiya raajnneeti main sabase puraane raajnneetik dal congress party pichley kuch saalon se desh kii raajnneeti main rasaatal kii ore ja rahi he
 In such a situation, Sonia Gandhi took over the party, but ever since she made some distance from the activities of the party, party vice president Rahul Gandhi has taken charge of the party
 maharashtra or odisha main hue sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bijepi ke behatar pradarshan or congress ke phiseddi pradarshan par party ke netaaon main kaanaafoosee shuru ho gai he
 While the party is calling it an internal battle and blaming the financial crisis of the party, senior party leaders are considering the reason for the defeat as lack of capabilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi
 yah alag baat he ki sabhi ke sabhi kaanaafoosee hi kar rahe hai or sabhi ko paanch rajyon main ho rahe chunaavon ke parinaam kaa intjaar he
 a senior Congress leader said, "the biggest question is who will tie the bell in the cat's neck
" kai party netaaon kaa maananaa he ki 2014 main party kii karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne party kii kaman apane haath main le lee thi or puure desh main party main badlaav kaa prayaas kiya or puure desh main prachaar bhi kiya
 But the results so far are not encouraging for the party
 party ek ke baad ek rajya main harati ja rahi he or dekha jaae to dhire dhire party saaf hoti ja rahi he
 The concern of senior party leaders does not end here
 sabhi ko yah bhi dikkat he ki party ke paas abhi tak narendra modi sarkaar se takkar lene ke liye koi gemplan nahin he na hi koi ranneeti he
 Party leaders even said on condition of anonymity that Rahul Gandhi's attacks have not proved effective so far and bjp's win in Maharashtra and Odisha will have an impact on voting in the remaining phases of UP
 tippaniyan These leaders say that there is no hope of anything more than a change in the party for a long time as accountability and performance has never been a measure under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 yah maang ek baar phir jor pakadegi ki kya rahul gandhi party ke adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalenge or unki bahan priyanka gandhi wadra or zyada sakriy bhoomika nibhaaengi yaa nahin
 Whatever be the case, with the announcement of the election results on March 11, if nothing changes, then the question will arise on the Congress leadership
 yah sawaal congress party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii kshamtaaon par bhi uthaae jaaenge
 Whispers have started among the party leaders over the bjp's better performance in the local body elections in Maharashtra and Odisha and the Congress's poor performance
 jahaan party ise aantarik ladaai bataa rahi he or party kii vittiya khastahal ko jimmedaar bataa rahi he vahiin, party ke varisht netaa in haar kii vajah ko party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii kshamtaaon main kami ko maan rahe hai
 It is a different matter that all of them are whispering and all are awaiting the result of elections in five states
 ek varisht congressi netaa ne kaha, sabase bada sawaal to yah he ki billi ke gale main ghanti koun baandhegaa
 Many party leaders believe that after the party's crushing defeat in 2014, Rahul Gandhi took over the reins of the party and tried to change the party and campaigned all over the country
 lekin abhi tak ke parinaam party ke liye utsahvardhak to nahin dikhaai de rahe hai
 The party is losing in one state after another and if seen, the party is slowly getting cleaned up
 party ke varisht netaaon kii chintaa yaheen nahin samaapt hoti he
 Everyone also has a problem that the party does not yet have any gameplan nor any strategy to take on the Narendra Modi government
 party netaaon ne naam na lene kii shart par to yahaan tak kaha ki rahul gandhi ke hamale abhi tak kargar siddh nahin hue hai or maharashtra or odisha main bijepi ko mili jeet kaa asar upi ke baaki bache charnon main matdaan par bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 The comments in netaaon kaa kahana he ki party main kaaphi dinon se chale badlaav se bhi zyada kuch hone kii ummid nahin dikhti he kyonki rahul gandhi ke netritv main javabdehi or parformens kabhi bhi paimaana nahin rahaa he
 This demand will once again pick up on whether Rahul Gandhi will take over as the party president and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will play a more active role or not
 kuch bhi ho, 11 march ko chunaav parinaamon kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi agar kuch badlaav nahin hua to sawaal congress netritv par to uthegaa hi

 Two economic thinkers and policy makers — chief economic advisors Arvind Rourmanyam and former Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia — standing at opposite poles in politics, put an end to these concerns by stating that economic data-generating institutions are "of the highest quality whose credibility Unquestionable, where there is no question of political interference

 Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray took oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday
 chunaav parinaam aane ke baad shivasena ne apni puraani sahyogi bhaajapa se gathbandhan todakar ensipi or congress jaise virdohi dalon se haath mila liya
 In this way, one of the states ruled by the BJP was further reduced, which is being seen as a defeat of the BJP
 maharashtra se pehle hindi pattee ke madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh jaise teen bade rajya bijepi ke haath se nikal chuke hai
 It is worth noting that barely six months ago, the BJP had won a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections with tremendous performance
 loksabhaa kii 543 siton main se bijepi ko 303 siten mili thim jo ki kul siton kaa kareeb 56 fisadi he
 When these figures were mixed with the constituencies, it was found that out of the total 4120 assembly seats in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was number 2089 on 2089 seats
 yani loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main modi ke netritv main bhaajapa 51 pratishat vidhansabha siton par jiti
 India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed the Lok Sabha election result on the basis of assemblies and compared it to the current representation in the assemblies (as on 28 November 2019)
 hamane paaya ki bijepi centre main to taqatvar he, lekin rajya vidhansabhaon main kamjor pad rahi he

 In its first report, we found that in December 2017, BJP ruled over 40% of the territory, which was reduced to 40% in November 2019
 haalanki, iske baavjood bijepi desh main sabase badi raajnneetik party bani hui he
 BJP currently has 1326 (32 per cent) mlas which is the highest number of mlas by any single party in the country
 bijepi kii virdohi party congress 846 (20 fisadi) vidhayakon ke saath duusare number par he
 However, collectively local and state level parties have the highest number of mlas
 desh bhar ke kul vidhayakon kii sankhya main se 43 fisadi vidhayak sthaneey or rajya stareey partiyon ke paas hai
 The remaining seats are either vacant or an independent candidate has won from there
 aagaamee chunaavbharat main sab rajyon main kul milakar jitne vidhayak hai, uske 32 pratishat bijepi ke paas hai lekin kuch rajya aise hai jahaan agle kuch maheenon main chunaav hone vaale hai

 During the Sawai Gandharva festival, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, the famous classical singer of the Kirana Gharana, a vocalist, became so uneasy at not being able to sit properly that he himself went on stage and played the tanapura until the other player have arrived
 banaras gharaane ke shastreey gayak rajan-saajan mishra kii jodi ke saajan mishra ne bataaya, ‘ek dfa savai gandharva samaaroh main tanpura vadak ke sur thik nahin baith paa rahe the
 Panditji was feeling very restless due to this
 aakhirkaar unase rahaa nahin gaya or vah khud uthakar aaye or tab tak tanpura bajaate rahe, jab tak doosraa vadak nahin aa gaya
 Pandit Bhimsen Joshi was so comfortable and far from showing
 ’ savai gandharva mahotsav swayan joshi ne apane guru savai gandharva kii yaad main shuru kiya tha
 It is held in Pune and it is a matter of pride for any artist associated with classical music to perform in it
 mishra ne yaadon ke galiyaaron main lautate hue kaha, ‘vah bhartiya shastreey sangeet jagat ke badshaah the or miyaan tansen ke baad logon ke jehan main shastreey gayak ke rup main pandit ji kaa hi naam aata he
 He was a friend of my uncle Pandit Gopal Mishra, so we got the opportunity to see and hear him and his affection since childhood
 ’ unhone kaha ki bachapan se jise sunakar ham log jawan hue or baad main unke saath hi kai dfa manch par prastuti dene kaa saubhaahgya milanaa kisi sapane ke sach hone jaisaa tha
 Mishra said in a spiritual tone, 'every person except the human body has to go every day, but the person should go through such deeds to become immortal
 pandit ji kaa nashwar sharir bhale hi hamaare bich nahin rahaa, lekin unki aatma sadaiv hamaare saath rahegi
 'he said that with the demise of Panditji, a note of' Desh Raag 'has gone into the background
 prasiddh shastreey gayak miyaan tansen ke guru swami haridas ke vanshaj or prasiddh shastreey gayak vasifuddin dagar ne kaha, ‘pandit bhimsen joshi kaa nidhan sampurna shastreey sangeet jagat ke liye gaharaa aghat he
 There are many big names of the Kirana Gharana, but Pandit Bhimsen Joshi made a different place from his singing and this is the most important reason that he was highly respected by all the musicians of the Gharana
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar ne unhen bharat ratna se nawaja tha, lekin vah vastav main shastreey sangeet ke amuly ratna the
 Whenever i met him i always found his singing young and full of enthusiasm
 kitne bhi thake hone ke baavjood vah urja or josh ke saath kaarykram prastut karte the
 Pandit Chhannulal Mishra, a classical singer from the grocery house, told Varanasi on the phone, 'one time i went to his house, he cut an apple with his hands and fed it to me
 vah behad sahruday or saral kalakaar the
 Recalling Joshi, he said 'he was like my brother
 unki aawaaj main gajab kii damakashi thi or unke jane ke baad khuli aawaaj main gane vaala koi gayak mujhe najar nahin aata
 ' iraq or syria main lard rahe jihadiyon ne ravivaar ko 'islamic khilaafat' kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kii he

 online vitarit ek audio recording main islamic state of iraq and syria (iesas) ne apane pramukh abu bakr al-bagdadi ko 'khalipha' or sari duniya main maujuud muslimon kaa netaa ghoshit kiya he
 ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed Al Adnani said, 'the Shura (council) of the Islamic nation met and discussed this (khilafat) issue
 
 
 
 The Islamic nation decided to establish an Islamic Khilafat and elect the Caliphate of this Muslim nation
 ' unhone kaha, 'jihadi netaa bagdadi ko muslimon kaa khalipha chunaa gaya he
 ' iske saath hi unhone bataaya ki sarkari kagajaton or dastavejon main islamic raashtra ke naam se iraq or levent jaise shabdon ko hataaya ja rahaa he
 Once again, journalism again saw his dislocated knees, injured elbows, and bandages tied on his wrist - there are similar occasions to tell that the foundation of Indian democracy is being irrigated by the blood of journalism
 haalanki tivi channelon par patrakaron kii ye pitayee dekhakar kai logon ko parapidak sukh kaa anubhav hua hoga
 The first joy would have been that the police had told these minor presses and channels their status
 bataa diya ki vah jab chaahe unhen jaanwaron kii tarah khaded kar peet sakati he
 Those people of Satlok Ashram too must have been happy on this beating, whose arbitrary media did not allow Baba to run
 yaad dilaayaa ki ek aadmi prashasan or sarkaar ko angootha dikhaa rahaa he or adaalat kii tauheen kar rahaa he
 Forced the police to take action
 media ko in sabaki mili−juli sazaayen jhelni padi
 50 years ago Muktibodh wrote in his poem 'into Darkness' - hi-hi i have seen him naked, i will surely get punishment for it
 50 saal baad hamaare andhere samay main muktibodh kii ye bhavishyavaanee jaise sach nikali
 Journalism saw the beaten people, saw the police dragging them and showed them the courage to land on camera
 isliye patrakaron ko dauda−dauda kar unke camere haath−paanv hausale sab todane kii koshish hui
 Journalism is also considered as a game of power and money these days- probably because many bad things of our time have entered our journalism too
 vah in dinon kamazor aadmi kii awaz se zyada majboot aadmi kaa bayaan sunne lagi he
 But in spite of all this, despite all the glitter and superficial display of strength, journalism blossoms most when it stands for justice, when it forces a Magarur Baba to hide in the ashram and a shameless system Forces the action
 phir vah is karrwai ke dauraan pit rahe or ghayal hue shaks kii ghasiti jaati tasaveer utaarti he
 If the punishment for standing up for this truth is beaten, then this punishment is accepted by the journalists again and again, because it gives them strength and legitimacy, in the words of Raghuvir Sahai, in this shameful and defeated time

 pakistan main ye sikh kar rahaa he shandaar kaam, ramadan main musalamaanon ko de rahaa he khaas ofer National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said on Saturday that he was "fully convinced" that most Kashmiris are in support of the removal of Article 370 and assured him that the sanctions in Kashmir were aimed at Pakistan for terrorism through its false intentions To stop it from happening
 unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 ‘‘ek vishesh darja nahin tha
 This was a special distinction
 ise nirast kiye jane se ham kashmiri logon ko anya bharatiyon kii barabari par laaen he
 In a conversation with a group of selected journalists, Doval said that the restrictions were later relaxed and prohibition is in force in only 10 of the 199 police districts in Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh while landline telephone service in all areas is completely Has been restored from 'netaaon kii najarbandi par unhone kaha ki ehtiyathan aisa kiya gaya or kanoon ke tahat bhi isaki anumati he jiskaa matlab he ki sarkaar adaalaton ke prati javabdeh he or agar kuch bhi nyaayettar hota he to use baari jurmaana bhugatna padegaa
 He said, 'I am absolutely confident that most of the Kashmiris have supported the removal of Article 370
 unhone is kadam main behatar avasar, behatar bhavishya or yuvaaon ke liye adhik naukariyaan dekhi he
 Doval told journalists in the Indian and foreign media, "there are few people opposing it
" logon ko lagata he ki yah unki aawaaj he
 This is not necessarily true
 ' unhone kaha ki pakistan kashmir main sankat paidaa karne par tula hua he or vah ghati main ashaanti kii sthiti dekhnaa chahta he taaki uske bharat virdohi dushprachaar main use madad mili
 To achieve this objective, Pakistan has sent many terrorists to Kashmir to create an atmosphere of unrest and the neighboring country wants to ensure that normalcy is not restored
 dobhaal ne kaha, ‘‘yadi koi jammu-kashmir main saamaanya sthiti behaal karne main dilchaspee rakhata he to vah bharat he
 We will not let people fall prey to Pakistan's conspiracy and its bullets coming from across the border
 ham logon kii suraksha ke vaaste sab kuch karenge
 To a question about the alleged violation of human rights by the army, Doval said that only local police and central paramilitary forces are deployed to restore law and order
 isliye sena dwaara kisi atyaachaar kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 He said that according to intelligence reports there are reported to be 230 militants in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and some of them have entered from across the border to create unrest here
 dobhaal ne kaha, ‘‘pakistan ke liye kashmir main ashaanti paidaa karne ke vaaste keval ek hi hathiyaar aatankwaad he
 If Pakistan stops engaging in subversive activities, normalcy can be restored in Kashmir
 jab unase poocha gaya ki yadi pakistan apni napak gatividhiyon ko jari rakhega to bharat kya karegaa to unhone kaha, ‘‘har samasya kaa samaadhaan he
 However, he did not elaborate in this regard
 mobile phone or internet sevaaon par paabandiyaan lagaaye jane ko nyyochit tehraate hue unhone kaha ki inkaa pakistan or aatankwaadiyon dwaara vidhvansak gatividhiyon ke liye aasaani se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, "even before the Internet came into our life, people were doing their work
 '' haalanki unhone sweekaar kiya ki log in paabandiyon se naakhush he
 He said, "in any society, people always want more than what they have
 lekin hamaare liye unka jivan adhik mahatvapurn he

 Let me tell you that BJP had put a lot of emphasis to snatch Tripura from the left
 pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, uttar pradesh ke siem yogi adityanath jaise diggaj netaaon ne yahaan reliyaan kii
 In fact, for the BJP to win this small state of north-east is an attempt to fulfill the promise that the BJP chief made to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on Vijayadashami last year
 aresas se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, pichley saal vijayadashami ke din bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne sangh ke varisht netaaon se kaha tha ki vijayadashami par diya jane vaala guru-dakshina agle saal (2018) main samarpit karuunga
 His reference was to win the BJP in Tripura
 abhi tak jin-jin rajyon main left party kii sarkaar rahi he
 In any election there, BJP could not win directly from leftist parties, but in this election, BJP has won unilaterally, breaking old records
 bataa den ki kerala main bhi bhaajapa ne jeet hasil karne kii bahut koshish kii, lekin sirf ek seat jeet saki thi
 It is worth mentioning that in the meeting of party general secretaries, Amit Shah had bluntly said that even though Tripura is a small state, it is very important for BJP that this victory will not only be an electoral victory, but it will also prove to be an ideological victory
 20 saal se left front kii sarkaarbta den ki 1998 se tripura main maanik sarkaar mukhyamantri hai
 This time too, he was the face of the Chief Minister's post from the Left Front in the hope of a fifth term in the Tripura Assembly elections, but the BJP turned his back on his intentions
 gauratlab he ki tripura main maanik sarkaar ke siem banane se pehle se hi 1993 se left front kii sarkaar lagaataar banati aa rahi he

 Suresh Kalmadi, who is facing pressure to cancel his visit to the London Olympics, on Saturday hit back at Ajay Maken, accusing the Sports Minister of campaigning against him and also demanded Maken's resignation
 dilli kii adaalat ne shuukravaar ko kalmari ko landan olympic jane kii sweekruti de di thi
 Kalmadi said that Maken should not have given such a reaction against the court's decision and requested the Prime Minister to seek the resignation of the Sports Minister
 kalmari ne kaha, ‘aagaamee olympic ke liye mujhe landan yatra kii sweekruti dene ke mananeey adaalat ke faisle par ajay maakan kii pratikriya padhakar main stabdh hum
 Maken's decision to go against the court's decision is unfair to the Sports Minister, in view of which i urge our Prime Minister to seek resignation from Maken for such remarks and statements
 ’kalmari ne maakan par khel mahasanghon kii kaaryastylee main hastkshep or ‘gutbaji’ paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya jisase antat: olympic main khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan prabhavit hoga
 Kalmadi said, 'maken's threat to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) that he will try to ensure that i do not remain a part of the Indian delegation shows that he is not aware of the functioning of autonomous sports institutions
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main landan olympic ke saath ho rahi aieef kii baithak main athletics mahasanghon ke antarrashtriya sangh (ieeef) kii parishad ke sadsy ke rup main hissaa luungaa
 i do not need any support from the Sports Ministry
 ’unhone kaha, ‘isliye kendriya khel mantri kaa yah aarope ki olympic main meraa pratinidhitiv olympic kii bhaavana ko samaapt kar degaa, darshata he ki maakan khelon kii bhaavana upeksha kar rahe hai
 Kalmadi is currently out on bail after spending nearly a year in Tihar jail on corruption charges related to the Commonwealth Games
 kalmari ne kaha ki jab tak dosha sabit nahin hota tab tak vah nirdosh hai or isliye antarashtriya athlettic sanstha ke aamantran par unki landan yatra par logon kaa sawaal uthaanaa anuchit he
 He said, 'much was said, but Maken seems to have forgotten that it was during my tenure as IOA President that India won the most medals in both the Commonwealth and Asian Games
 rashtramandal khel mahasang ne bhi apni report main kaha tha ki dilli rashtramandal khel ab tak ke sarvshereshth khel the
 'he said,' i was unanimously elected to the IOA thrice, it shows the confidence of the sports unit
 kanoon ke mutabik doshi nahin paae jane tak main nirdosh hum
 My bail plea in the Hon'ble High Court clearly states that no financial charges have been proved against me
 bhrashtachar ke koi aarope sabit nahin hue hai
 Kalmadi said that Maken's interference in the functioning of the National Sports Federations is creating problems and factionalism for the sports in the country which will ultimately affect the performance of the players in the Olympics
 unhone kaha, ‘aise samay jab bhartiya khel rashtriya khel mahansaghon, kochon or khilaadiyon ke samuhik prayaas se aage bad rahaa he tab khel mantralay kaa khilaadiyon ke training kaarykram main kisi bhi tarah kaa hastkshep keval khelon main hissaa le rahe hamaare khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par pratikul asar daalega
 He said, "I think this campaign of Maken against me is to create a rift between the officials and Indian players participating in the London Olympics
" ’kalmari ne kaha, ‘is baar bharat ke paas sarvaadhik padak jeetne kaa acha mauka he or is samay khilaadiyon ke ham main andeh ki kisi bhi tarah ke bich bona gairajaruri he
 'he said,' Maken seems to have forgotten that i have been allowed by the court to go to London for the Games from 28 July to 13 August at the invitation of the IAAF Council

 The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the IAS officers of making political statements
 'aap' netaaon ne sarvice rule kaa hawala dete hue iees association se 6 sawaal bhi puche hai
 Spokesperson Ashutosh has demanded IAS officers to be sued for violation of service conduct rule
 aam aadmi party ke rashtriya pravaktaashutoshne kaha ki varisht adhikariyon ke dwaara dilli ke andar jo maahaul banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, uski aam aadmi party naa keval ninda karti he balki ye bhi kahati he ki ye sab badi sajeesh ke tahat kiya ja rahaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party mlas have been arrested on the basis of a statement by the Chief Secretary, but the police is not taking any action in the attack on Aam Aadmi Party government ministers and others in the Secretariat
 party ne press conference ke dauraan aarope lagaaya ki sarvice conduct rule ke tahat yah saafe he kisarkaari afasarkisi bhi tarah kii raajnneetik bayaanbazi nahin kar sakate or naa hi wo hadtaal yaa protest jaisi kisi gatividhi main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Senior officials cannot make any kind of political statement, but despite this, through Twitter and Facebook, the officials are making political statements against the Aam Aadmi Party government and the Chief Minister and political attacks are being carried out using the government office
 is
 adhikariyon se jude kuch soshal media acounts se saafe ho jaataa he ki iees afasar protest bhi kar rahe hai or ye bhi kah rahe hai ki kisi bhi tarah kii sarkari meeting main nahin ja rahe hai
 6 AAP questions from IAS officers: 1
 mukhya sachiv ke saath kathith marpet kaa maamla adaalat ke sangyaan main he, jaanch or sunwaayee chal rahi he, baavjood iske adhikari mukhyamantri se maafi maangane kii maang kar rahe hai jo anuchit he
 At whose behest is the officer doing this? Do the authorities not trust the law and the court? 2
 sachivalay main mantri ke saath hui marpet ko lekar kisi bhi varisht adhikari ne ek shabd bhi bolaa he? aisa kyon? kahin aisa to nahin ki adhikari bhi is shadyantra main shaamil hai?3
 According to the service rule, government officials cannot make any kind of political statement, but why are they doing this and on whose instigation? 4
 aise afasaron ke kilaaf kyon naa vibhageeya karrwai ho?5
 Why are government premises and government offices being used for political rhetoric? 6
 kyon nahin in tamaam adhikariyon kii kol ditels kii padtaal honi chahie, aakhir pataa to chale ki in adhikariyon ne kis-kisase baat kii he, inke taar kin-kin bhartiya janata party ke netaaon se jude hai? In Modi Nagar, Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, police could not find a clue of a minor girl even a month after her disappearance
 itnaa hi nahin sthaneey log thana kotwali ke paas 2 din se dharne par baith gaye
 If no police officer reached to meet them, the people who sat on the dharna against the police sat on the dharna outside the police station expressing their displeasure and they also surrounded the police station
 dharne par baitha peedit parivarpeedit parivaar kaa aarope he ki unhone police ko bacchee ke gaayab hone ke din ke teen sisitivi footage or tamaam kol detail bhi de di hai
 Despite this, the police failed to find his daughter
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki police ne unki bacchee ko dhundne ke liye koi thos koshish nahin kii he
 It is also alleged by the victim family that whatever costs are being incurred so far to find the girl
 vah bhi peedit parivaar hi kar rahaa he
 However, since this whole incident, there is a lot of anger among the locals and there is a lot of resentment against the police
 aakhirkaar ab pareshaan hokar peedit parivaar ke saath saikadon kii sankhya main sthaneey log ikattha hokar thana kotwali par dharne par baith gaye
 People left from outside the police station only after police officials assured to find the girl soon
 dharne par baithe logon kaa kahana he ki 15 din pehle unhone sio karyaalay kaa bhi gheraav kiya tha or thana kotwali police ke dwaara kii gai abhi tak kii sabhi karrwai ke bare main bataaya gaya tha jiske baad sio ne 3 din kaa samay maanga gaya tha lekin tab se 15 din biit jane ke baad bhi police kisi tarah kii koi thos karrwai nahin kar pai he or aaj bhi sirf chaatra ko dhundhane kaa aashwaasan hi de pai he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi narrated two stories to his workers at the party's 84th convention in Delhi on Sunday
 rahul ke is sambodhan main congressi kaaryakartaaon ne kai baar taaliyaan bajaakar unka utsahvardhan kiya or is dauraan 'badlaav kaa vakt he', 'rahul tum sangharsh karo
 
 ' jaise naare bhi lage
 However, during Rahul's two stories, Congress workers kept listening to the story silently and after the end of the stories, the same applause was not heard from them on other issues
 is pratikriya ko dekhakar sambhaavnaaen jataai ja rahi hai ki shaayad kaaryakartaaon ko kahani kaa ant samaj nahin aayaa
 Rahul narrated these two stories in connection with the recent assembly elections in Gujarat
 in chunaavon main congress ne kai chunaav visheshgyon kii ummid se behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 Even though the Congress failed to form the government, the Congress leaders were satisfied with their performance
 in nateezon ke aane ke baad se hi congressi netaa in chunaavon ke nattejey kaa zikr karte rahete hai
 Rahul said, 'in the election of Gujarat people said that i go to the temple
 lekin main bahut pehle se hi sirf mandir hi nahin, masjid, carch or gurudware main bhi jaataa hum
 Let me tell you two stories of going to the temple
 'rahul ne kaha, 'ek baar shiv kaa mandir tha, vahaan puja ho rahi thi, pandit baithe the, puja khatm hui
 i asked Panditji the question- Guruji, tell me what you did? Pour milk, pour water, chant, but what did you do in worship? Panditji said- first remove your security people, i did it
 phir unhone mujhe mandir ke peeche diwaar par khadaa kiya, kaha- diwaar par maathaa lagaao
 When i planted, he said - i tell one thing, i am not from here, belong to Kashmir, do not tell people
 agar tu bhagwaan dhund rahaa he, vah to tuje kahin bhi mil jayega
 Temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras, in trees, in the sky
 
 
 sab jagah milegaa
 i said thank you Master and i left
 'rahul ne duusari kahani main kaha, 'phir se vaisaa hi shiv kaa mandir tha, waisi hi ek puja thi, ek pandit the
 i also asked the same question
 sawaal poochne kii aadat he
 Pandit said- Don't ask the son
 main ad gaya, maine phir se poocha
 Panditji said- i have done worship, you are going to become Prime Minister
 phir bole- mandir kii chat par kya he? maine kaha- cement he, vah bole- jab tum piem ban jaaoge, chat par sona laga dena
 'A person tells the truth
 ek baaten banaata he, jhooth kahata he
 The second story of Rahul ended here
 haalanki darshakon ko lag rahaa tha ki kahani aage bhi bachi he or ve uske samaapan kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 But by then Rahul had started speaking on another topic

 ek tarah se unka jail ke andar hi janata darbar lagata tha, jahaan logon kii samasyaayein sulajhaai jaati
 Let us tell you that Shahabuddin is under suspicion in the murder of journalist Rajdev Ranjan
 dm or espi ke mutabik unhone jail main chhapemari nahin kii, balki wo suraksha kaa jayja lene aae the

 isse pehle bhi shahabuddin ko kai baar siwan se shift kiya gaya he
 He was shifted to Bhagalpur even during the Bihar assembly elections
 lekin rajya main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad unhen waapas siwan bhej diya gaya
 However, the district administration did not want them to be kept in Siwan jail
 gathbandhan sarkaar main argedy ke sabase bade party ke rup main ubharne kaa asar siwan main saaf dikhne laga
 There was a huge increase in the number of people meeting Shahabuddin
 siwan kii aabhohawaa main pichley 10 varshon se jo badlaav aayaa tha, usamen jehar ghulne laga
 Bihar government minister Abdul Ghafur's visit to Siwan jail to meet Shahabuddin and share his picture on Facebook has encouraged the criminals
 log khauf main jeene lage
 The Nitish government, facing the charge of the journalist from the murder of the journalist, had no choice but to shift Shahabuddin from Siwan jail
