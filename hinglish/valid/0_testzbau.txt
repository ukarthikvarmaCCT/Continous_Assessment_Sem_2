 Calories are obtained from the fuel element
 yadhyapi vartmaan kaal main vitamin or khanij tatwon kaa vishesh mahrathav he, tathaapi poshan ke liye calories kaa mahatv bhi apane sthaan par he
 The function of fuel elements is to generate heat in the components, keep muscles active and participate in higher body work
 sharir main kuch kriyaayein aisi hai jo shithil or sushupt avasthaa main bhi hoti rahati hai
 Some of these functions occur involuntarily, such as the production of juice in the intestines, digestion and movement in the heart rate, etc
 kuch kaary aichhik rup se hote rahete hai, jaise ni:shwaas kriya ityadi
 For all these works, heat and energy are released from the fuel elements, which can be measured in calories
 shant or shithil avasthaa main jo shaareerik prakriyaayein hoti rahati hai, unako ""aadhaar upaapachay"" kehete hai
 There are many ways to do this
 shaareerik kaary jitna badhata he, upach bhi usee anupaat main aata he or usee anupaat main ooshmaa kii calories kii bhi vruddhi hoti he

 The next stage of the initial symptom of the disease is called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV or chronic HIV
 The second stage of HIV infection can last from 3 years to 20 years without treatment
 Normally this Charan shows few or no symptoms whereas at the end of this phase many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle aches
 Swelling or enlargement of the lymph glands is also seen within 3–6 months in about 50–70% of people
 Although most hiv-1-infected individuals have a detectable viral load, they eventually grow to AIDS in the absence of treatment, while in some cases CD4 + T-cells remain in the body for more than 5 years without antiretroviral therapy

 In addition to this, common symptoms include multiple respiratory tract infections
 Evaporative infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that are usually controlled by our immune system
 Different types of infections occur in different people, depending on which organisms or infections are commonly found in the environment around the person
 These infections can affect every organ system in the body

 In 2009, 12% of cases in the United States were reported to have been used by people who used intravenous drugs, and in some areas, more than 80% of those who used drugs were found to be HIV positive
 The risk of infection by using HIV infected blood is up to 93%
 In developed countries, the risk of HIV transmission from infected blood is very low because the HIV test of the person giving the blood is done before taking his blood

 Although the work of repair and reconstruction of all Jat forts continued during his reign, his contribution in particular was in the construction of modern palaces of Bharatpur and Deeg

 It is said that Nawab Ghaziuddin of Lucknow, who was a friend of Maharaja Suraj Mal, when he came to Deeg in 1759, he also gave money for the construction of buildings as a gift

 Arthur's sparse historical background is sourced from various sources, including the writings of Annales Cambrié, Historia Britonum, and Gildas
 arthur naam aarmabhik kavy sroton main paaya jaataa he jaise vaai gododdin 
 The image of the great Arthur's international interest developed largely through the popularity of the eccentric and imaginative Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th-century Historia Regum Brittannié

 How much of Geoffrey's Historia has been adopted from earlier sources and how much Geoffrey invented himself is unknown

 Arthurian literature was in good shape during the Middle Ages but its influence increased after centuries of diminishing influence when a major revival was experienced in the 19th century
 21 veen sadi main kahaniyon ko jivan mila, na keval sahitya main balki theatre film, tivi, comics or anya media main use apanaaya gaya
 There has been a long debate by scholars on the basis of the historicity of the legend of King Arthur
 ek mat ko maanane waalon ne historia britainum or ennals cambiye kaa hawala dete hue arthur ko ek vaastavik aitihaasik vyakti, ek romano-british netaa mana he, jisane 5 shatabdi ke antim yaa 6 shatabdi ke prarambh main kisi samay hamalavar angl-saxons ke khilaaf yuddh kiya tha
 The Historia Britannum is a later compilation found in Latin historical manuscripts dating back to the 9th century, found here by Nannius, a Welsh cleric who lists twelve battles that Arthur fought
 ye mons badonikus yuddh yaa mount bedan ke saath samaapt huin jahaan kaha jaataa he ki unhone akele 960 logon ko maar giraaya
 baharhaal, haal hi ke adhyayan main is avadhi ke itihaas ke ek strot ke rup main historia britainum kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthe hai
 The other text is the 10th-century Annales Cumbrié, supporting the case of Arthur's historical existence, in which the episode of the Battle of Mount Baden is also linked to Arthur
 annals main ladaai kii tithi 516-518 he or camelan yuddh kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jisamen arthur or medrut donon maare gayi, yuddh kii tithiyaan 537–539 hai
 These accounts are often considered Historia 'accounts and confirm that Arthur did in fact battle with Mount Baden

 The latest research has shown that Annals Cambriae was born in the late 8th century on the basis of a chronicle

 This is more likely to have been added at some point in the 10th century and did not exist in any preceding set of annals

 Many recent historians have removed Arthur's account of north Roman Britain for lack of early evidence convincing the region

 The historian John Morris made the so-called kingdom of Arthur the main principle of organizing his history in The Age of Arthur, a history of sub-roman Britain and Ireland
 Yet he had very little to say about the historical Arthur
 aise siddhanton kii ek aanshik pratikriya ke rup main anya vichaar samooh ubhara jisane tark diya ki arthur kaa koi aitihaasik astitv nahin tha
 Morris's Age of Arthur inspired archaeologist Noel Myres to observe "there is no personality in the boundary line of history and mythology that wasted so much time on the historian
" The 6th-century polemic de Expedio et Onquestu Brittannié of Gildas records lively memories of Mount Baden, mentioning war but not Arthur
 arthur kaa ullekh anglo- saxon chronical main nahin kiya gaya he yaa 400 or 820 ke bich likhit kisi bhi vartmaan pandulipi main uskaa naam nahin he
 The major early sources of post-roman history are also absent in Bede's Especialist History of the English People which mentions Mount Baden
 itihaaskaar david dumelise ne likhaa he "mujhe lagata he ki ham unki gutthi ko bahut jald sulajhaa lenge
 unki hamaare itihaas kii kitaab main apni jagah he or 'bina aag ke dhuaan nahin uthta' ek vichaar samooh yah maanata he
 

 The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur, we can dismiss him from his history, above all, from the excerpts of his books
 " Some scholars state that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore - or even a semi-forgotten kelt deity - who was given real credit for all works in the distant past
 unki akruti kii tulana kent ke kulchihn ghodon ke devataaon henguest or horas ke saath kii jaati he, jo baad main aitihaasikta se jud gayi
 Bede attributes these great individuals to the anglo-saxon conquest of eastern Britain in the 5th century

 na to historia main or naa hi annals main unhen "shaasha " mana he: purvavartiyon ne iske sthaan par unhen yuddh kaa netaa or sipaahi kaha he
 Historical documents of the post-roman period are few, so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur's historical existence is unlikely
 12 veen shatabdi ke baad se ghatnasthalon or jagahon ko arthurian ke rup main chihnit kiya gaya he, lekin puraatatv vishwaas ke saath keval naamon ko ujagar kiya he, jo shilaalekh ke madhyam se surakshit sandarbhon main paye gayi
 The so-called Arthur stone was found in 1998 in the ruins of the Tintagel Fort in Cornwall, which found safe 6th century references, which created a brief stir but proved irrelevant
 glastombari cross sahit arthur ke sakshya ke anya abhilekhon ko jaalsaji qaraar diya gaya he
 Although many historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur, no convincing evidence has emerged in his identification
 welsh naam arthur kaa mul bahes kaa vishay bana hua he
 Some suggest that it is derived from the Latin family name Artorius used for the obscure, which Etimalji tried to prove to be invalid or of Etruscan origin)
 From the Welsh arth of others, the original form is "bear-man", although there are difficulties with this theory - notably the Britonic compound name * Arto-uiros to Old Welsh * Artgur and Middle / Modern Welsh * Arthwr and Arthur ur coach, John Koch said that all this could happen in the context of Arthur's historicity about Latin and it should be dated after the 6th century
 ek vaikalpik siddhant Arthur ko Arcturus se jodta he, jo nakshatra Boötes mandal kaa sabase chamakdaar sitara he, saptrushi ke paas jise Ursa Major yaa the Great Bear kehete hai
 The name means "guardian of the bear"
 shastreey latin main Arcturus shabd pracheen latin Arturus se viksit hua hoga or jab welsh main aayaa hoga to Artur ban gaya hoga

 aise etimalji kaa sahi mahatv spasht nahin he
 It has often been assumed that a derivation from Artorius would mean that Arthur's legends had a real historical basis but recent studies indicate that this assumption is not well established

 The creator of Arthur's familiar literary personality was Geoffrey of Monmouth, his pseudo-historical Historia Regum Britannié written in the 1130s

 The second is that the former Gulfridian Arthur was a character of folklore and local magical wonder-stories, leading a troupe of supernatural heroes, who lived in forests and landscapes

 The most famous Welsh poetic reference to Arthur comes in the song collection of the death of a hero known as y Gododdin -Y Gododdin, whose creation is attributed to the 6th-century poet Aneirin
 ek antare main ek yoddha kii bahaduree kii prashansa kii gayi he jisane 300 dushmano ko maar giraaya, lekin iske baavjood unhone yah bhi kaha ki "vah arthur nahin the", yah kaha jaataa he ki unke kamaal kii tulana arthur kii veerta se nahin kii ja sakati

 Tliassin is credited with the creation of several poems, of which he is said to have been a 6th-century poet who also mentions Arthur, although all of them are likely dated to between the 8th and 12th centuries
 is
 unamem "kaadir teyrnon" shaamil he jisamen "arthur da blessd" kaa sandarbh he, "preiddeu annvan" jo arthur kii duusari duniya ke ek abhiyaan ko bataata he or "marvanat vathyar pen " jo arthur kii veerta ko sandarbhit karata he or arthur tathaa uthar ke bich pita-putr ke sambandhon kii charchaa he jo monmouth ke jeffri se pehle kii taarikh kaa he
 Other early Welsh Arthurian texts also include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, "pa gur yvi y porthour?" 
 It is in the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper who wants to enter a fort in which Arthur describes himself and his people's works, particularly Sei and Bedwire
 welsh gadhy gaatha kalhavch and olven jo aadhunik mabinogeon sangrah main shaamil he, main arthur ke logon kii bahut lambi suchi he jisamen unke 200 se adhik logon ke naam hai, haalanki si or bedvar ne phir kendriya sthaan le liya he
 The story follows Arthur's tales as a whole in which he helps his relative, Kalhwach, conquer a series of impossible tasks to find Chief Minister Yesbadden's daughter Olwen, a giant semi-extraterrestrial boar hunting Twitch Twitch
 Is included
 9veen sadi kaa historia britonam bhi is kahani ko sandarbhit karata he, vahaan boar kaa naam troy tii he
 Finally, Arthur is mentioned several times in the Welsh Triad, a collection of brief summaries of the Welsh tradition and legend, classified into three related groups or anecdotes to remember
 baad main triad kii pandulipiyaan aanshik rup se jeffri ke monmouth se or baad main mahadwipiya paramparaon se lee gayi hai parantu jo aarmabhik main aisa koi prabhaav nahin dikhataa or aam taur par purv welsh parampara hone par sahmati he
 Even as Arthur's court began a case against the emplacement of Britain, the Arthur court was often cited as an alternative to "the Island of Britain", with "sources being three xxx of the island of Britain"
 Although it is not clear in the Historia Britonum and Annals Cambriae that Arthur was also considered a king, at the time of writing Calhwach and Olwen and the Triads he became the "chief of the lords of the island", Pentyarned Yer Ynyns Han, Wales, Cornwall and the North had other worlds

 Arthur in particular refers to the famous Vite of many post-roman saints, none of which are generally considered credible as historical formulas
 12 veen shatabdi ke prarambh main lankarfan ke karadok dwaara likhit life of saint gildas ke anusaar bataaya jaataa he ki arthur ne gildas ke bhai heil ko maar daalaa or uski patni gwenhvifar ko glastombari se bachaaya

 An apparently less well-known document of Arthur is the Legenda Sancti Goejnovi, often referred to as early as the 11th century, but his writings are also claimed to be of early 15th-century manuscript
 arthur ke sandarbh ke taur par mahatvapurn main malmesburi ke wiliam kaa di gestis rijam angaloreum or harman kaa di mirachulis sanktaaye maariye laudensis ullekh he jo ek saath pehali baar kuch sakshya uplabdh karaate hai jisase yah maanane kaa pehla nishchit pramaan miltaa he ki arthur vastav main mare nahin the or kuch sthanon par vah waapas lautate hai, yah ek aisa vishay he jis par galfridian lokkathaon main aksar dobaaraa gaur kiya gaya he
 The first document of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey's Latin Historia Regum Brittannié of Monmouth

 1138 main puri hui, jo british raajaaon ke ek prasiddh trogen se nirvaasan brookes se lekar 7 veen sadi ke welsh raja kaadvalladar kaa kalpanasheel or kaalpanik dastavej he
 Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-roman period as Historia Brittannié and Annales Cambrié
 unhone arthur ke pita uthar pendragon, unke jaadugar salaahkaar merlin or arthur ke garbhaadhan ko shaamil kiya he jisamen uthar merlin jaadu se apane dushman gorlois ko pahchaan letaa he, gorlois kii patni igerna ke saath tintagel par sota he or vah arthur ko garbh main dhaaran karti he
 Upon Uther's death, fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeded him and became King of Britain and fought many battles that were similar to those that occurred at the end of the Historia Britonum and the Battle of Bath
 uske baad unhone dweep ke apane abhiyaanon ke madhyam se arthurian samrajya banane se pehle island or orkeney dwipon ke pict or scots ko haraaya
 baarah varsh kii shanti ke baad arthur apane samrajya ke vistaar ke liye ek baar phir baahar nikle or norway, denmark or francisiyon par niyantran paa liya
 The French are still controlled by the Roman Empire, when it is conquered and Arthur's victory naturally leads to another confrontation between his empire and Rome
 arthur or unke shoorveer ne jinamein kius, beduerus or gualguanus sahit france main roman samraat lusius tiberius ko haraaya lekin jab ve rome kii ore kooch kii taiyaari kar rahe the to arthur ne suna ki uske bhattije modredus ne unki patni guenhdar se shaadi kar lee he or singhaasana par kabja kar liya he, jise unhone britain kaa daayitv diya tha
 Arthur returned to Britain and defeated Modredus near the Kamblam River in Cornwall and killed him but was badly injured
 unhone apana mukut apane rishtedaar konstantine ko saunp diya or unhen apane ghaavon ko bharne ke liye avalon ke tapu par le jaaya gaya jiske baad unhen phir kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 The debate over how much of this narrative is Geoffrey's own invention
 nishchit rup se lagata he ki jeffri ne saxons ke khilaaf arthur kii baarah ladaaiyon kii suchi kaa istemaal kiya he, jo 9 veen sadi ke historia britonam main he, saath hi annals kambriye ke kamlann yuddh or is mat kaa istemaal kiya he ki arthur ab bhi jinda hai
 Arthur's personal stature as king of the whole of Britain is also derived from pre-gulfridian tradition, found in Calhwach and Olwen, Triads and Saints Lives
 ant main jeffri ne arthur kii sampattiyon se kai logon ke naam ko liya he jinamein parivaar ke kareebi, purv-galfridian welsh parampara ke sahchar shaamil hai, jinamein keus, beduerus, guenhdar, uthar or sambhawatah kaliburnus kaa naam shaamil he, jo baad main exkalibur bana jisamen anuvarthi arthurian kahaniyaan hai
 However, while the name, important events, and title may have been derived, Brinley Roberts has argued that "the Arthurian section is Geoffrey's literary work and borrowed nothing from earlier narratives
" " isliye, udhaaharan ke liye, welsh medrut ko jeffri dwaara shararthpurna modredus kiya gaya he, lekin welsh sroton main 16 veen sadi takusake itane nakaaratmak charitra kaa sanket nahin mila he
 The Historia Regum Brittannié is primarily Geoffrey's own creation, with relatively few modern attempts to challenge the notion, and often scholars' belief that Neuwburgh's William's 12th-century commentary follows that Geoffrey "coined his story" , Probably due to "excessive love for lying
" " is drushtikon se ek virdohi jeffri ashe maanate hai ki jeffri kii katha aanshik rup 5 veen sadi ke riotamus naam ke british raja ke kaaryon ke strot se aanshik taur par alag he, vahi charitra vaastavik arthur he, haalanki itihaaskaaron or saltisists ne ashe ke nishkarsh se sahmati nahin jataayi he
 Irrespective of their sources, Geoffrey's Historia Rejum Brittanni's immense popularity cannot be denied
 More than 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin compositions are said to have survived and do not include translations into other languages
 is prakaar udhaaharan ke liye lagbhag 60 pandulipiyaan historia ke welsh-bhashaa sanskaran main shaamil hai, jo sabase pehle 13 veen sadi main nirmit hai; puraani dharna he ki welsh ke ye puraane sanskaran vastav main jeffri ke historia se liye gayi hai, jinhen lambe samay tak academik halkon dwaara chhod diye jane ke baad 18 veen sadi ke louis morris jaise pracheen vaastu se jude vidwaanon ne unnat kiya
 As a result of this popularity Geoffrey's Historia Rejum Brittannié had a considerable influence on the medieval development of the later Arthurian legend
 While this does not mean that this was the only creative force behind the Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed, and provided a historical framework that added stories of magical romance and amazing adventure
 jeffri ke historia kii lokapriyata or iske anya vyutpann kaary ko aam taur par 12 veen or 13 veen shatabdiyon main vishesh rup se france main mahadwipiya europe main mahatvapurn sankhya main naye arthurian kaaryon ko samajhane main ek mahatvapurn kaarak banane par sahmati he
 It was not, however, only the Arthurian influence when "matter of Britain" developed
 " jeffri kii rachana ke vyapak rup se jane jane se pehle is baat ke spasht saboot hai ki mahadweep main arthur or arthurian kahaniyon kaa gyaan tha saath hi saath celtic ke naam kaa upyog or kahaniyaan thim jo arthurian romance main jeffri kii historia main nahin milteen
 arthur ke nazariye se shaayad nayi arthurian kahani kaa sabase mahatvapurn prabhaav uskaa atyant pravahpurn hona he jisamen swayan raja kii bhoomika he
 Arthur himself remained less than the center of Arthurian literature of this 12th century and later, Lancelot, Guinevere, Perceval, Galahad, Gwain !, Tristan and Isolde
 jabaki arthur purv-galfridian sahitya or swayan jeffri ke historia ke bahut kendra main the, romance main ve teji se darkinar kar diye gayi hai
 His character was also changed considerably
 aarmabhik donon samagriyon or jeffri ke yahaan ve ek mahaan or kathor yoddha hai, jo vyaktigat rup se chudilon or diggajon kii hansate hue hatya karte hai or sabhi sainya abhiyaanon main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah karte hai, jabaki mahadwipiya romance main ve aalsee or "kuch nahin karne vaale raja" ho jate hai, jisaki "niskriyata or maun sweekruti ne paroksh rup main unke adarsh samaaj main ek kendriya dosha paidaa kiya
 Arthur's role in these works is often that of an intelligent arrogant, quiet, somewhat soft and sometimes weak king
 isliye ve sirf pile pad jate hai or chup ho jate hai jab mort arthu main lenslot ke guinavere ke saath prem ke bare main jaanate hai, jabaki charetiane di troyes ke ywaen, da line of da nite main ve ek bhoj ke baad jaagate rahane main asamarth hai, ve jhapai lene lagate hai
 Still, as Norris J
 Lass observes that whatever his faults and weaknesses are in these Arthurian romances, "his reputation is nowhere — or almost none - due to compromising his personal weaknesses 


 His authority and glory remain
 " Arthur and his followers appear in the Marie de France of Levis, but it was the creation of another French poet Charatin de Troyes, who had the greatest influence on the development of the character of Arthur and his legend

 However, the most important lenslot for the development of the Arthurian legend is The Night of the Cart, in which Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with the Queen of Arthur, the role of Arthur's husband to expand and popularize the recurring theme, and Percival, The Story of the Grill in which a holy comb and the Fisher King are introduced and it is then seen that Arthur has little in the story Role is found
 chretiane ne is prakaar "arthurian katha ke vistaar or us katha ke prasar ke liye adarsh farm kii sthapana donon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai" or uske baad unki nirmit duniya ke sandarbh main arthur ke chithran kii neenv rakhi thi
 Perceval, though incomplete, with four distinct contracts of poetry that were particularly popular, which appeared over the next half-century, was developed by other authors such as Robert de Boron, the concept of the grail and its discovery
 There is a fact that helped accelerate the fall of Arthur in continental romance
 Similarly, the Arthurian legend of Lancelot and his extramarital affair with Arthur's wife Guinevere became one of the classic motifs, although Lancelot's prose is Lancelot's and later texts were a combination of Chretien's character and Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's lanzalet
 yahaan tak ki chretiane kii rachana welsh arthurian sahitya main bhi pratipushti dikhaayi detii he jiskaa parinaam yah niklaa ki romance arthur welsh main sakriy arthur saahitiyik parampara kii jagah lene laga

 By AD 1210, continental Arthurian romance was mainly expressed through poetry, stories from this period onwards began to be told in prose
 The most important of these was the prose romance Vulgate Cycle of the 13th century, written in the first half of the century, a series of five Middle French prose
 ye rachanaaen astire del saint gril, astire de merlin, lenslot propre, quest del saint graal or mort artu, jisko jodakar puure arthurian katha kaa pehla susangat sanskaran taiyaar kiya gaya
 The cycle continued to reduce the role played by Arthur in his narrative, which he played in his legends, partly due to the penetration of Galahad's character and the expansion of Merlin's role
 yah mordred ne arthur or unki bahan ke bich ek vyabhichaar ke sambandhon ke jariye or camelot kii bhoomika ko sthapit karke bhi kiya, iskaa pehali baar ullekh arthur ke praathmik darbar main chretiane ke lenslot main nidhan main varnit he
 This series of texts was soon followed by the post-vulgate Cycle, of which Suite du Merlin is also a part, which has greatly diminished the significance of Lancelot's love affair with Guinevere but continues to sideline Arthur, In the same order more attention was focused on the discovery of the grill
 isi prakaar arthur in french gadhy romaason main chote charitra kii tulana main mushkil se hi mahatvapurn charitra hai; swayan vulget or stire de merlin tathaa mort artu main ve keval mahatvapurn charitra hai
 The development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of "arthur of Romance" culminated in Le Morte d'arthur, an English rereading of the entire tale by Thomas Mallory, in the same treatise in the late 15th century
 malori ne jis katha ko aadhaar banaaya uskaa multah sheershak da hole book of king arthur and of hij nobel nits of da round teble he- jo romance ke vibhinn pichley sanskaran, vishesh rup se vulget cycle he or aisa lagata he ki uskaa uddeshy arthurian kahaniyon kaa ek vyapak or pramanik sangrah bananaa he
 Perhaps the result of this and the fact that Le Morte d'arthur is one of the first printed books in England, published by William Caxtone in 1485, the earliest Arthurian compositions are derived by Mallory

 For example, the 16th-century humanist scholar Plydore Vergil rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of the north-roman Empire, which is found throughout the post-gulfridian medieval "chronicle tradition" and was the terror of the Welsh and English tradition

 King Arthur and the Arthurian legend was not completely abandoned, but by the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used as a vehicle of metaphor for 17th and 18th century politics
 is prakaar richard blackmor ke mahakavyon prince arthur or king arthur main arthur ko james dwitiya ke khilaaf wiliam III ke sangharsh ke ek roopak ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he
 Similarly, the most popular Arthurian story throughout this period seems to be Tom Thumb, first told through chapbooks and later through Henry Fielding's political dramas, although the activity is clearly laid out of Arthurian Britain, humor
 Is cast and Arthur appears as a primarily comedy version of his romance character
 19 veen sadi ke prarambh main madhyayugin, svachhndathawad or pracheen punaruddhar ke prati rujhaan ne arthur or madhyakaalin romance ko phir se jaagrath kiya
 a new code of ethics for 19th-century civilizations took shape with heroic ideals embodied in the "arthur of Romance"
 phir se janmi is nayi ruchi ko pehle 1816 main mahasoos kiya gaya, jab malori kaa le morte di arthur punarmudrit hua tha jo pehali baar 1634 main prakashit hua tha
 Initially the medieval Arthurian legends were particularly interested in and inspired by poets, for example William Wordsworth's "the Egyptian Med", an allegory of the Holy Grail
 inamen vikhyath hai alfred lard tennisan, jinaki pehali arthurian kavita "da ladi of shailot" thi, jo 1832 main prakashit hui thi
 Although Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these compositions, Tennyson's Arthurian creation of the Idols of the King reached a peak of popularity in the later medieval romance tradition, a new interpretation of Arthur's life for the Victoria era
 Renewed
 The first publication was in 1859, selling 10,000 copies within its first week
 Arthur became a symbol of ideal humanity in the Idols, whose aim is to establish an ideal state on earth that ultimately fails due to man's weaknesses
 tennisan kii rachana ne badi sankhya main anusarankartaaon ko prerit kiya, arthur kii kathaon main logon kii vyapak ruchi paidaa kii or khud charitra tathaa malori kii kahaniyon ko ek vyapak darshak ke saamne laae

 This interest in and stories related to "arthur of Romance" persisted throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century, and influenced poets such as William Morris and pre-raphaelite painters, including Edward burne-jones
 yahaan tak ki vinodpurn katha tom thamb, jo 18 veen sadi main arthur kii dantakatha kaa praathmik abhivyakti tha, use idles ke prakaashan ke baad phir se likhaa gaya
 While Tom retained his small size and retained the comic relief character, his story now incorporates more elements from medieval Arthurian romance and Arthurco is taken more seriously and historically into these new versions

 Also the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian stories did not continue unabated
 By the end of the 19th century it remained largely confined to pre-raffaelite followers and could not live without being affected by the First World War, which damaged the reputation of valor and thus for its medieval expressions and interest in Arthur As a role model of valor

 The influence of Arthur's romance tradition continued through novels in the late 20th century, such as T
H
 White's The Once Enchanted Future King and Marion Jimmymer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, as well as comedies such as Prince Vilent
 Tennyson had reworked the stories of Arthur's romance and commented on issues that were applicable to his time, and at the same time adopted a modern approach to the case
 For example, Bradley in his writings has adopted a feminist view of Arthur and his narrative, which is contrary to the medieval content of Arthur's narrative, and American writers often rework Arthur's story with conviction and Connect with values like equality and democracy
 This romance has become popular in the film Arthur and similarly in the theater

 As noted by Taylor and Brewer, the return of the medieval "chronicle tradition" of Geoffrey and Historia Britonum to this monmouth became a recent trend after the outbreak of World War II, when Arthurian literature became dominant in a few years, when Arthur's legends were of the same tone in Britain against the resistance of the German invaders

 This tendency to place Arthur in historical perspective is also clearly visible in historical and fantasy novels published during this period

 Hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined the Arthurian youth groups in the United States, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur's legends were encouraged as exemplars

 Lass found, "arthur's notion of popularity seems limited, it is not surprising that he appears to have some motifs and names, but there is no doubt about the extent to which he lived many centuries ago

 Amba was reborn as Shikhandi
 amba kashiraj kii putree thi
 She had two other sisters named Ambika and Ambalaika
 
 On becoming eligible for marriage, his father created the self of his three daughters
 hastinapur ke sangrakshak bhishma ne apane bhaai vichitraveery ke liye jo hastinapur kaa raja bhi tha, kashiraj kii teenon putriyon kaa swayamvar se haran kar liya
 They took all three to Hastinapur
 vahaan unhen amba ke kisi or ke prati aasakt hone kaa pataa chalaa
 Bhishma arranged for Amba to be taken to her lover, but Amba returned from there disgusted
 amba ne iskaa uttardaayitv bhishma par daalaa or unase vivaah karne par jor diya
 She did not deviate from her determination even after Bhishma argued that she was bound by her pledge to observe lifelong celibacy
 antat amba ne pratigya kii ki vah ek din bhishma kii mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 For this, he did severe penance
 uskaa janm punah ek raja kii putree ke rup main hua
 Due to the memories of the previous birth, Amba again started penance to fulfill her goal
 bhagwaan shankar ne prasann hokar uski manokamana purna hone kaa vardaan diya tab amba ne shikhandi ke rup main maharaj drupad kii putree ke rup main janm liya
 Shikhandi was originally born as a girl in the house of Panchal Naresh Drupada
 uske janm ke samay ek aakashvani hui kii uskaa laalan ek putree nahin varan ek putr ke rup me kiya jaae
 Therefore Shikhandi was brought up like a man
 use yudhkala kaa prakshikshan diya gaya or kalantar main uskaa vivaah bhi kar diya gaya
 On the day of his marriage, his wife insulted him on knowing the truth
