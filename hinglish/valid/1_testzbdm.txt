 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai

 Several scholars in America, mainly Maranthau, Richard Snyder, Martin Kaplan, Carl W
 Doyce, Charles mcclelland, have made specific contributions in this regard
 iske atirikt viksit va vikasshil donon deshon ke adhyayan par bal diya he
 The compilation of its subject matter, theory rendering and methods have also developed a lot
 parantu aaj bhi sabase mahatvapurn kami ek saarvbhaumik / saamaanya siddhanth pratipaadan kaa abhaav bana hua he
 Its importance in the post-cold War world has increased
 is bhoomandaleekaran ke daur main sabhi rajya ek prakaar kii aarthik vyavastha se judate ja rahe hai
 International and national issues like environment, terrorism, feminism, ADS, depletion of ozone layer, human rights etc
 have become associated with human / human beings rather than national
 atah aaj in sabake samaadhaan hetu antarrashtriya manchon / sanghathanon kii sakriy bhagidaari aavashyak he
 Now universal theory has also been rejected from the point of view of postmodernism and more emphasis has been given on subjective and local basis

 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll
dat
 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers like Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows
 yun to aajkal prayukt "register sanchika" sanchikaon kii praarambhik pariklpana darshaati he, kintu yah praayah lupt ho chuki he
 Mehndi, also known as henna, is a means of decorating the body used in South Asia

 It has also come into vogue in the western countries since the 1990s
 mehandi kaa prachlan aaj ke is nae yug main hi nahin balki kaaphi samay pehle se ho rahaa he
 Even today, all girls and women apply it with great fervor, even girls and women are not only very fond of mehndi but in our Indian tradition mehndi has been practiced since a long time, because mehndi women make up There is an integral part without which every custom is considered incomplete
 mehandi olgane ke liye hina naamak paudhe / jhaadi kii pattiyon ko sukhaakar pisa jaataa he
 Then its paste is applied
 kuch ghante lagane par ye rach kar laal-marun rang detaa he, jo lagbhag saptaah bhar chalata he

 tukumen Sovereign State of Argentina · Bolivia · Brazil · Chile · Colombia · Ecuador · Guyana · Panama * · Paraguay · Peru · Suriname · Trinidad and Tobago * * Uruguay · Venezuela adheen kshetiruba · fockland dweepasmooh · francisi guyana · Ethics, also known as Behaviorism, Ethics, Ethics and Ethics, is a branch of philosophy
 yadhyapi achaarshastra kii paribhaasha tathaa kshetra prayek yug main matbhed ke vishay rahe hai, phir bhi vyapak rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki achaarshastra main un saamaanya siddhanton kaa vivechan hota he jinke aadhaar par maanviya kriyaaon or uddeshyon kaa muulyankan sambhav ho sake
 Most authors and thinkers also agree that ethics is primarily concerned with norms and values, not the study or discovery of objects and these criteria should be used not only in the analysis of personal life but in the analysis of social life
 i also
 acha or bura, sahi or galat, gun or dosha, nyaay or jurm jaisi avadharanaon ko paribhaashit karke, nitishastra maanviya naitikta ke prashnon ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karata hai
 As a field of intellectual review, he also deals with the areas of moral philosophy, descriptive ethics, and value theory
 nitishastra main abhyaas ke teen pramukh kshetra jinhen manyata praapt hai: In this, the party works according to whatever advice is given to the lawyer and his party
 rashaworth keader kehete hai ki ""nitishastra" kii maanak paribhaashaon main 'adarsh maanav charitra kaa vigyaan' yaa 'naitik kartavya kaa vigyaan' jaise vaakyansh aam taur par shaamil rahe hai
 "ethics are a set of concepts and principles that, as Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define, guide us in determining what behavioral sensitivities help or cause harm"
 cambridge dictionari of philocyphi yah kahati hai ki nitishastra shabd kaa "upyog saamanytah vinemian rup se 'naitikta' ke saath hota hai' or kabhi-kabhi kisi vishesh parampara, samooh yaa vyakti ke naitik siddhanton ke arth hetu iskaa adhik sankeern upyog hota hai"
 Paul and Elder say that most people get confused between social practices, religious beliefs, and behavior, and ethics, and do not consider ethics alone as a concept
 "nitishastra" shabd ke kai arth hote hai
 This can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy
 manushya ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan anek shastron main anek drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Human behavior, like nature's trades, occurs in the form of a work-cause-chain and can be studied and interpreted causally
 manovigyaan yahi karata he
 But we do not characterize natural trades as good or bad
 raste main achaanak varsha aa jane se bhigane par ham badalon ko kuvachy nahin kehane lagate
 On the contrary, on the actions of fellow human beings, we pass judgment of good and bad
 is prakaar nirnay dene kii saarvbhaum maanviya pravriti hi achaardarshan kii janani he
 In ethics, we think systematically and try to know what is the wise basis of our good and evil decisions
 kaha jaataa he, achaarshastra niamak athwa aadarshanveshi vigyaan he, jabaki manovigyaan yatharthanveshi shaastra he
 Certainly there is some fact in this classification of scriptures, but it can also be misleading
 ukt vargeekaran yah dharna utpann kar saktaa he ki achaardarshan kaa kaam naitik vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa anveshan tathaa udghaatan nahin he, apitu kritrim dhang se vaise niyamon ko maanav samaaj par lad dena he
 But this assumption is wrong
 nitishastra jin naitik niyamon kii khoj karata he ve swayan manushya kii mul chetana main nihit hai
 Of course, this consciousness is seen taking different forms in different societies and ages
 is anekarupata kaa pradhan kaaran maanav prakruti kii jatilta tathaa maanviya shrey kii vividhrupatha he
 The thinkers of different countries explore the moral standards inherent in the prevailing laws of their societies
 hamaare apane yug main hi, anek nai puraani samskritiyon ke sammilan ke kaaran, vichaarkon ke liye yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki ve anginat roodhiyon tathaa saapekshya manyataon se upar uthakar vastut: saarvbhaum naitik siddhanton ke udghaatan kii ore agrasar hon
 Meta-ethics asks how we understand this, how we know about it and what it means when we talk of 'what is right' and 'what is wrong'
 yah man main chal rahi ulajhanon kaa ek sakaaratmak nichod he
 Critical ethics is the study of ethics
 yah nitishastra kii vah shakha hai, jo un prashnon ke sammuchay kii jaanch karti hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik rup se kisi ko kaise kaam karnaa chaiye
 Critical ethics differs from meta-ethics in that it examines the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 paramparaagat, mandandak nitishastra is baat kaa adhyayan tha ki vah kya hai jo kisi kriya ko kya sahi yaa galat banaata hai
 These principles provide broad moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 maanav kaa sadaiv se ek pramukh drushtikon upyogetavaad rahaa he
 This ideology reflects that aspect of human behavior, which states that ==naitik darshan== manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain Political ethics is the practice of making ethical ethical decisions about political action and political agents
 varnatmak nitishastra varnapat ke darshanik chor kii ore kam jhukta he kyonki uskaa uddeshy hai kaise log jite hai is bare main khaas jaankaree praapt karnaa or drusht pratimaanon ke aadhaar par saamaanya nishkarsh nikaalnaa
 In relation to what is the basic question of ethics, two important opinions are found
 ek mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kii pradhan samasya yah batalaana he ki maanav jivan kaa param shrey kya he
 On realizing the ultimate credit, we will say auspicious actions to those who are going to take that credit; Opposite actions will be called inauspicious
 duusare mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kaa pradhan kaary shubh yaa dharmasammat kii dharna ko spasht karnaa he
 In other words, the function of ethics is to clarify the form of a rule or rule according to which rituals are performed as auspicious or religious
 e do mantavya do bhinn kotiyon kii vichaarpaddatiyon ko janm dete hai
 The ultimate credit has been conceived in many ways; We will describe these fantasies or theories further
 yahan ham sankshep main yah vimarsh karenge ki naitikta ke niyam-yadi vaise koi niyam hote hai to-kis koti ke ho sakate hai
 The notion of a rule or law comes either from the penal law of the state or from the physical sciences, where the laws of nature are cited
 rajya ke kanoon ek prakaar ke shaskaon kii newnaadhik niyantrit ichha dwaara nirmit hote hai
 They are sometimes made for the benefit of some classes, they can be broken and some people may be harmed by their adherence
 iske vipareet prakruti ke niyam akhandaneey hote hai
 State laws are subject to change, but laws of nature are immutable
 niti yaa sadachaar ke niyam aparivartaneey, paalankarta ke liye kalyankar evam akhandaneey samajhe jate hai
 In these respects the rules of ethics are completely similar to the laws of health science
 aisa jaan padataa he ki manushya athwa maanav prakruti do bhinn kotiyon ke niyamon ke niyantran main vyaprut hoti he
 On the one hand, human beings are subject to laws which are inaugurated or represented in the physical sciences, chemistry, science, psychology, psychology etc
 and on the other hand the rules of ideal sciences, such as health science, logic, etc
, which they are not bound by, but which are followed It is necessary for its happiness and progress
 nitishastra ke niyam is duusari koti ke hote hai
 Following are the major problems of ethics- nitishastra kii samasyaon ko ham teen virgon main baant sakate hai : Many imaginations have been made in the East and West about the ultimate credit
 bharat main praaia: sabhi darshan yah maanate hai ki jivan kaa charam lakshya sukh he, kintu unamem se adhikansh kii sukh sambandhi dharna tathakthith saukhyavaad se nitant bhinn he
 In this second or prevailing sense, we can only call the Charvak philosophy a Soukhvadi
 charvak ke naitik mantavyon kaa koi vyavasthit varnan uplabdh nahin he, kintu yah samajha jaataa he ki uske saukhyavaad main sthool andriya sukh ko hi mahatv diya gaya he
 Other philosophies of India, the ultimate happiness which is called the goal of life, have been equated with class, liberation or salvation or nirvana
 nyaay tathaa sankhya darshanon main apvarg yaa mukti kii kalpana kii gai he, use bhavatmak sukhrup nahin kaha ja saktaa kintu upanishdon tathaa vedant kii muktavastha aanandarup kahi ja sakati he
 Both the liberation of Vedanta and the nirvana of Buddhists are indicative of the situation when the soul of a person goes beyond the duality of happiness, sorrow etc
 yah sthiti jeevankaal main bhi aa sakati he; bhagavadgita main sthitprajna kaha gaya he vah ek prakaar se jivanmukt hi kaha ja saktaa he
 In Western philosophies, many opinions regarding the ultimate credit are found: hamaare param shrey athwa shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa saadhan yaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhi vibhinn matvaad hai
 In the opinion of most suffragists, the perception of good and evil is through wisdom
 hegel, breadle aadi kaa mat yahi he or kaant kaa mantavya bhi iskaa virdohi nahin he
 Kant believes that ultimately our sense of action is the source of moral ideals
 anubhavvaadiyon ke anusaar hamaare shubh ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot anubhav hi he
 This view gives rise to moral ambiguity
 teesraa mat pratibhaanvaad athwa apyajhhvjj ) he
 According to this view, there is such a power within us that we know or know the auspicious inauspicious way
 pratibhaanvaad ke anek rup hai
 The British philosophers named Shaftesbury and Hutcheson thought that just like the senses accepting Roopa Rasa etc
, we also have a moral sense in us that directly sees good and evil
 bishap butler naam ke vichaarak ke mat main hamaare andar sadasadbuddhi naam kii ek prerak vritti hoti he jo swaarth tathaa pararth ke bich uthanevaale dwandv kaa samaadhaan karti hui hamen auchity kaa maarg dikhalaataa he
 There are many motivational circles of our conduct; One instinct is self-love, the other is self-interest
 sadasadbuddhi kaa sthaan in donon se upar he, vah in donon ke upar nirnaayak rup main pratishthit he
 The German thinker Kant is also counted among the pratibhists
 pratibhanvaadee naitik siddhanton kaa ek saamaanya lakshan yah he ki ve kisi kaary kii bhalaai buraai ke nirnay ke liye uske parinaamon par dhyaan dena aavashyak nahin samajhate
 No karma becomes auspicious or inauspicious because its results are of one or the other category
 yaa kisi kaary ke samast parinaamon kii purvakalpana waisi hi kathin he jaisaa ki unpar niyantran kar sakna
 The good and evil of karma are determined by its motivation
 jis karm ke mul main shubh prerana he vah sat karm he, ashubh prerana main janm lenevaala karm asat karm yaa paap he
 Thorn's statement that auspicious resolution is a thing that is self-respecting, whose credibility is absolute and definite; The credit of all remaining items is relative
 keval shubh sankalpaikti hi apni shreyrup jyoti se prakashit hoti he
 Indian thinkers have also expressed many opinions regarding what is the source of knowledge of moral auspicious and inauspicious
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar shruti dwaara prerit aachaar hi dharm he or shruti yaa veda dwaara nishiddh karm adharm
 Thus religion and unrighteousness are law-abiding
 bhagavadgita main nishkaam karmyog kii shiksha ke saath-saath yah batalaaya gaya he ki kartavya-kartavya kii jaankaree ke liye shaastra hi pramaan he
 Under the scripture, both Shruti and Smriti are calculated
 hindu dharm ke prayek varna tathaa ashram ke liye alag-alag kartavyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he; in kartavyon kaa vishad vivechan dharmasutron tathaa smritigranthon main miltaa he
 In addition to the duties of this category, it has also been considered as proof for the understanding of general religion or universal religions
 sajjanon ke aachaar ko pathpradarshak rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The basis of the imperative of moral conduct has also been conceived in many ways
 manushya ke itihaas main naitikta kaa sabase mahatvapurn niamak dharm rahaa he
 We should follow moral rules, because that is what favors God or theology
 sadachaar kii duusari niamak shakti rajya he
 Kingship is an important factor in preventing people from immoral acts
 isi prakaar samaaj kaa bhay bhi naitik niyamon ko shakti detaa he
 According to thorn, we should do religion for ourselves; Duty of duty is itself a favored or practicable object
 jo vichaarak kartavya-kartavya ko paramashrey kii apeksha se rakshit karte hai, ve kah sakate hai ki naitik achaaran kii prerana mulat: atmonnati kii prerana he
 We do auspicious actions, because by doing that we progress towards our ultimate credit
 nitishastra kii ek mahatvapurn samasya yah he ki kya manushya karm ke liye swatantra he? jab ham ek vyakti ko uske kisi kaary ke liye bhala bura kehete hai, tab spasht hi use us kaary ke liye uttaradaayi maan lete hai, jiskaa matlab hota he yah prachhann vishwaas he ki vah vyakti vichaaradhin kaary karne na karne ke liye swatantra tha
 The thorn says: Since i must, i can
 taatpary yah ki karta kii swatantraaa ko maane bina naitik jivan evam naitik moolyankan kii vyavastha sambhav nahin dikhti
 We do not call the trades of nature as bad, but only give such judgment on the deeds of man; This shows that there is some difference between natural and human businesses
 yah antar manushya kii swatantraaa ke kaaran he
 a person's determination to make the ritual of an action not a matter of desire is free
 nirdharanwad ke poshakon ko ukt mat grahya nahin he
 Physics states that there is unbroken rule of work-cause-rule everywhere in the universe
 prayek vartmaan ghatana kaa nirdhaaran ateet hetuon se hota he
 The whole world is a large work-cause-tradition
 sab prakaar kii ghatnaayen akhand niyamon ke adheen hai
 In such a situation, how can it be believed that human beings are free of choice and business without reason and ruleless? The activities of human beings cannot be considered exceptional in the phenomenology of the world
 yadi anek avasaron par ham maanviya vyapaaron ke sambandh main safal bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakate to iskaa kaaran hamaari un vyapaaron ke niamak niyamon kii apurna jaankaree he, na ki un vyapaaron kii niyamaheenata
 The theory of determinism is bolstered by the physical scriptures; He also derives support from the mechanistic interpretation of nature
 kintu iskaa yah matlab nahin ki nirdharanwad ek bhautik siddhant he
 It is said that there is no place for the freedom of the individual in the philosophies of Spinoza and Hegel
 sankhya darshan main purush ko nirgun tathaa niskriy mana gaya he
 All actions are attributed to the intellect and intelligence is said to be governed by three qualities
 gita main likhaa he-saare kaary prakruti ke teen gunon dwaara kiye jate hen, ahankaaravash manushya apane ko karta maan letaa he
 In the Gita itself, the numerical five reasons for each karma have been enumerated, namely, Adhisthana, Kattrta, Karana, Miscellaneous Attempts and Divines; In such a situation one cannot be said to be responsible only for karma
 maikenzi aadi kuch vichaarak ukt donon maton se bhinn aatmanirdharanwad ke siddhant ko maanate hai
 Where a person performs karma in the spirit of freedom, karma itself is determined by the powers inherent in his personality
 is arth main manushya swatantra he
 The feeling of remorse arising after bad work proves the freedom of the doer
 iran - israel sambandh pracheen kaal se hi ek madhur sambandh rahe lekin iran ek muslim bahut raashtra he to israel ek yahudi raashtra he iran israel sambandh kii daraar iran kii islamic kranti kaa hona or iran main rajshahi shashan kaa patan hona mul kaaran tha iran kii islamic kranti ke baad iran israel sambandh or vartmaan samay main ek dushman ke rup main he
 On 19 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution dividing Palestine into Arab and Jewish territories and thus the United States became the Israeli nation in Palestine with the help of the British, after which Mushey Sharatuq telegraphed the then Foreign Minister of Iran and In his Telegraph, the Shah of Iran, describing the event of Cyrus the Great rescuing Jews thousands of years ago
 Appealed to the government that he repeated Yhudihyon greatness to recognize Israel and Cyrus
 iran kii shahi sarkaar ne israel main irani nagarikon kii sampatti kii nigaraanee ke bahaane abbaas saiqal ke netritv main ek pratinidhimandalisrael bheja
 This was the first step of the imperial government of Iran towards relations with Israel, during which Turkey formally accepted Israel
 turki israel ko manyata dene vaala pehla islamic desh bana
 The imperial government of Iran was well aware that the Jewish lobby was very powerful in the US, besides its relations with the Arabs were not very good and then on 14 March 1950, the Iranian royal government accepted Israel but After the strong reaction of the country and the Arab countries, this relationship was ended but this process did not last for long and on 18 August 1953, the United States and Britain got the mill And then made the uprising in Iran has become once again the relation between Iran and Israel
 iran kii shahi sarkaar ne israel ko tel bechney kaa prastaav diya jise israel ne jhat se sweekaar kar liya kyonki arab deshon ne uskaa bahishkaar kar rakhaa tha, jab misr ke raashtrapati gamaal abd al nasir ne suez nahar ke rashtriyakaran kaa elaan kiya or israel ne britain or france kii sena ke saath mil kar misr par akraman kiya to iran or israel ke bich tel kaa len- dein bad gaya
 In 1957, there was secret negotiations between the imperial government of Iran and Israel and an agreement between the two was signed for one dollar and thirty cents per barrel of oil
 israel ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri david bin gorian ke aadesh se israelibandargahon par pipe linon kaa jaal bichaaya gaya iranka tel israel ke liye atyaadhik mahatvapurn ho gaya
 In 1959, Iran used to give thirty thousand barrels of oil per day to Israel, which reached the Pachhavanev thousand barrels per day in 1971
 iran israel ko tel kii aapurti karne vaala sab se bada desh tha or iske alaava iran va israel ke sambandh lagbhag har kshetra main vistrut the or israel ke rajaneta or buddhijivi iran ke naresh ko baar baar yah yaad dilaate the ki vah us sires mahaan kii nasl se he jisane dhai hazaar saal pehle yahudee kii puri jati kobcha liya tha
 This friendship between Iran and Israel was more than above and despite the wishes of Israel, due to the special circumstances of Iran's imperial government, the people of the country and the Islamic world were not in favor of bringing the relationship between Iran and Israel fully
 But with the success of the revolution in Iran, this relationship continued for thirty years, and Israel suffered heavy losses in every field
 yahi nahin, iran main islamic kranti kii safalataa ke baad banane vaali sarkaar ne philistin ke samarthan main atyaadhik mahatvapurn qadam uthaaya jo nishchit rup se philistiniyon ke liye aashaa kii kiran bana
 The first embassy in the Islamic Republic of Iran was the changed situation that the country with which Israel had the deepest ties established diplomatic relations with Palestine after the success of the revolution
 iran main 11 farvari 1979 ko islamic kranti safal hui or uske thik ek hafte baad philistin librasion front ke netaa yasir araafaat ko bulaakar ek kaarykram main philistini duutavas khol diya gaya
 The Embassy of Palestine was opened in the same building that housed the Israeli Embassy during the imperial government
 iran main kranti kii safalataa ke kuch hi samay baad logon ne tehran main sthit israel duutavas par kabja karke vahaan philistini duutavas kaa board laga diya tha, iran main tattakaaleen israeli rajdoot usuf harmalin apane taintis karmchaariyon ke saath iran main kisi agyaat sthaan main chup gayi the baad main amareeki raksha mantri harlod brown ne madhya purv kii yatra kii or is dauraan unki koshishon se yah log iran se nikalne main safal hue
 Six days later Yasir Arafat came to Iran and inaugurated the first embassy in Iran after the revolution
 He also became the first foreign leader to visit Iran after the revolution
 iran main kranti kii safalataa ko adtis varsh guzar chuke hai lekin israel se dushmani or philistin se dosti usee tarah se baaqi he or bahut se vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki iran ke khilaaf puri duniya main america ke netritv main jo kuch ho rahaa he uskaa mul kaaran bhi yahi he

 Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted
 in ayskon main aamtaur par aayran oxidon kii bahut adhik maatra hoti he or inkaa rang gahare dhoosar se lekar, chamkila pilaa, gaharaa bangnee or jang jaisaa laal tak ho saktaa he
 Iron is usually magnetite, hematite, joitite), limonite
 n), yaa siderit, ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 Hematite is also known as "natural ore"
 yah naam khanan ke praarambhik varshon se sambandhit he, jab hametit ke vishisht ayskon main 66% louh hota tha or inhen sidhe louh banane vaali blast fernence main daal diya jaataa tha
 Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is used to make steel

 Therefore, all sources of iron used by human industries are iron oxide minerals, the initial form used in industry is metamet
 haalanki, kuch sthitiyon main, louh ayask ke nimna shrenee ke sroton kaa upyog audyogikrut socitiyon ke dwaara kiya gaya, jab ucch shrenee kaa hametit ayask uplabdh nahin tha
 This includes the use of taconite in the United States after World War II, and the use of joithat and or bog ore during the American Revolution and Napoleon's War
 pragaitihaasik samaaj main louh ayask ke strot ke rup main latterit kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Magnetite is often used because it is magnetized and therefore can be easily released from geng
 louh ayask ke nimna shrenee ke sroton ko aamtaur par shuddhikaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates, it is usually broken into small pieces for purification, after which it is powdered and heavy liquid separation is used
 iske liye acchhee tarah se pise gaye ayask ko, bentonite yaa kisi or agent se yukt vilyan ke upar se pravaahit kiya jaataa he, jisase vilyan kaa ghanatv bad jaataa he
 When the density of the solution reaches the appropriate level, the hematite sinks and the silicate mineral floats on the surface and can be removed from the surface and separated
 louh ayask kii khanan vidhiyaan ayask ke prakaar par nirbhar karti hai
 At present four main types of iron ore deposits are found, which depend on the geology and mineralogy of the ore deposits
 ye hai magnetic, titanomagnetic, messive hametit or pisolitic yranstone bhandar 
 Bonded iron) is formed from metamorphic sedimentary rocks that are mainly composed of thin layers of iron minerals and silica
 isamen maujuud louh khanij carbonate siderit ho saktaa he, parantu louh ayask ke rup main kaam main aane vaale khanij main oxide magnetit yaa hametit hota he
 Bonded iron manufacturing is known in North America as taconite

 The process of mining involves activities of large quantities of ores and waste materials
 vyarth padaarth do roopon main hota he, khan main se nikali aisi chattaane jo ayask nahin hai, jo mulok kehalaata he or avaanchit khanij jo khud ayask kaa aantarik hissaa he, jo geng kehalaata he
 Mulok is removed from the mine as a waste material and the geng is separated during the process of purification or refining and removed from the ore as a residue
 taconite avshesh adhiktar khanij quartez hote hai, jo rasinic rup se niskriy hote hai
 This material is stored in large, regulated stagnant water ponds
 mukhya bindu jo magnetit ko aarthik drushti se upyogi banaate hai, ve hai, magnetit kaa crystalia gun, BIF poshak chattaanon main louh kii shrenee or sandooshak tatv jo sandrit magnetit main maujuud hote hai
 The size and strip ratio of most magnetite sources is irrelevant because the BIF is constructed hundreds of meters thick, has layers of hundreds of kilometers, which can easily contain 2,500 million or more tons of ore
 louh kii praroopik shrenee jisamen bandhit louh nirmaan se yukt magnetit aarthik rup se upyukt ho jaataa he, usamen mote taur par 25% Fe hota he
 Which can generally yield 33% to 40% magnetite, which can produce 64% concentrated iron
 praroopik sandrit magnetit louh ayask main 0
 Contains less than 1% phosphorus, 3–7% silica and less than 3% aluminum
 magnetic ke kanon kaa aakaar or silica ke dravyaman ke anusaar iskaa ansh yah nirdhaarit karata he ki chattan ko kis seemaa tak pisa jaye taaki ek ucch shuddhta se yukt sandrit magnetit uplabdh karaane ke liye chumbakeey pruthakkaran kii prakriya ko prabhavi rup se kiya ja sake
 This determines the amount of energy a milling process will require
 aam taur par adhikansh magnetit BIF bhandar ko itnaa pisa jaataa he ki kanon kaa aakaar 32 se 45 micro meter ho jaae, taaki kam silica se yukt sandrit magnetit praapt kiya ja sake
 Concentrated magnetite typically contains 63% Fe by weight and typically contains less phosphorus, less aluminum, less titanium, and less silica, and is demanded at a premium price
 vartmaan main magnetic louh ayask kaa khanan america main minesota or michigan main kiya jaataa he or taconite kaa khanan purvi canada main kiya jaataa he
 bif-containing magnetite is currently mined exclusively in Brazil, exporting it to Asia in considerable quantities and Australia has a new and larger magnetite iron ore industry
 kabhi kabhi grenite or ultrapotacic aagney chattaane magnetit ke crystalon ko alag karti hai or sandran ke liye aarthik drushti se upyukt magnetit ke pind banaati hai
 Some iron deposits, especially those in Chile, are formed by the flow of volcanoes, which contain a collection of characteristic crystals of magnetite
 ataakama registan main chile ke magnetit ke louh ayask bhandar, in jwalamukhi nirmaanon se nikalne vaali dhaaraon main magnetit ke jalodh sanchay banaate hai
 In the past, some magnetite skarns and hydrothermal deposits served as high-grade iron ore deposits requiring very little refining
 malaysia or indonesia main isi prakruti ke kai grenit se sambandhit bhandar bhi hai
 Other sources of magnetite iron ore include metamorphic accumulation of effective magnetite ore, such as ores found in the Tawman River of Tasmania that are formed by the cutting of ophiolite ultramafics
 louh ayask kaa ek anya laghu strot he paraton main jamane vaala megma kaa sanchay jisamen praroopik rup se venedium se saath titanium se yukt magnetit ayask hota he
 These ores form a niche market in which special types of smelters are used for the extraction of iron, titanium and vanadium
 in ayskon kaa shuddhikaran anivaary rup se bandhit louh nirmaan ayask kii tarah hi kiya jaataa he, parantu inhen aamtaur par krashing or screening ke dwaara adhik aasaani se parishkrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Typical concentrated titanomagnetite contains 57% Fe, 12% Ti and 0
 5% V2O5 hota he
 Hematite iron ore deposits are currently used in all continents, most commonly in South America, Australia and Asia
 adhikansh bade hametit louh ayask ke bhandar kayantarit roopantaran ke dwaara nirmit bandhit louh nirmaan hote hai or kabhi kabhi aagney ke sanchay bhi ho sakate hai
 Haematite iron is generally found to be lower than bif-containing magnetite or other rocks that make up its main source or protolith rock, but this makes iron extraction cheaper, since it has a higher content of iron content, so it is purified
 Or finishing is not required
 haalanki, hametit ayask magnetit ayskon kii tulana main sakht hote hai or isliye yadi shuddhikaran kii aavashyaktaa ho to inhen krash karne or pisane ke liye adhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hematite ores may also contain high concentrations of other ingredients, typically including high amounts of phosphorus, water, and aluminum

 The main obstacle in economics for iron ore reserves is not necessarily the category or size of the store, as it is not particularly strict to geologically certify the load in the substantial tonnage of rocks present
 mukhya baadha he bazaar ke saapeksh louh ayask kii sthiti, ise bazaar main laane ke liye rail buniyadi dhaanche kii laagat or aisa karne ke liye aavashyak urja kii laagat
 Iron ore mining is a high-volume, low-profit trade, because iron costs much less than base metals

 For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands of some key players
 vishwa main ausatan ek billian metric ton kachche ayask kaa salanaa utpaadan hota he
 The world's largest producer of iron ore is Brazilian Mining Corporation Well, followed by anglo-australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group

 BHP, Rio and Vel control 66% of the market between them
 australia main louh ayask ko teen mukhya sroton se praapt kiya jaataa he: pisolit "channel louh bhandar" ayask praathmik bandhit-louh nirmaan ke yantric apradan se utpann hota he or aluvial channelon main sanchit ho jaataa he jaise panavonica, pashchimi australia; or prabhavi kayantarit rup se parivartit bandhit louh nirmaan se sambandhit ayask jaise newman, chichester range, hammersle range or kulianobing, pashchimi australia main
 Other types of ore have also been reported recently, such as oxidized ferruginous hardcaps, for example latrite ore deposits near Lake Argyle in Western Australia
 bharat main louh ayask ke kul vasuuli yogya bhandar lagbhag hametit ke 9602 million ton or magnetit ke 3408 million ton hai
 Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Orissa, Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the main Indian producers of iron ore
 louh ayask kii duniya kii khapat salanaa 10% bad rahi he iske mukhya upabhokta china, japan, korea or sanyukt rajya america or europea sangh hai
 China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore, the world's largest steel producer
 yah sabase bada ayatak bhi he, jisane 2004 main louh ayask ke 52% samudri vyapaar kii kharid kii
 Next to China is Japan and Korea, which consume significant amounts of crude iron ore and metallurgical coal
 2006 main, china ne 38% kii vaarshik vruddhi ke saath 588 million ton louh ayask kaa utpaadan kiya
 Over the past 40 years, iron ore prices have been determined by a so-called benchmark system, between miners and steel makers
 parmparik rup se, in donon samoohon ke bich hui pehali deal ne ek benchmark sthapit kiya jiskaa anusaran shesh udyog ke dwaara kiya gaya
 In this way, the same price is negotiated once per year
 ek spot bazaar bhi maujuud he, haalanki yah paaramparik rup se bahut chota he
 The problem with this system is that when the spot prices are higher than the benchmark, the miners do not get additional revenue, which is earned by selling the ore in the spot market
 jab spot keemten benchmark kii tulana main kam hoti hai, kuch ispaat milen, apane ayask ko spot bazaar se kharid kar dhokhebaaji karti hai
 In other words, the benchmark system provides protection to steel mills but not to miners
 duusari ore, benchmark pranali khanankartaaon or steel milon ke liye keemton main sthirataa laati he, jisase ve apane utpaadan kii yojana adhik prabhavi rup se bana sakate hai
 In recent years, the benchmark system has been breaking down, as some miners motivate their customers to use the spot market and interactions with the largest buyer, China, cause friction
 kyonki spot bazaar kaa aakaar or mahatva bahut adhik bad gaya he, vittiya baadhaon se bachane ke saadhan jaise louh ayask main swap utpann hua he
 Given that most other bulk commodities have emerged as a market-based price system, it is a reasonable condition that iron ore will follow this path over the medium to long term
 haalanki, kuch maamalon main, shipping kii laagat ayask ke mulya se adhik he
 This is particularly relevant for Brazilian iron ore, which has to travel more to reach China than Australian iron ore
 isiilie, ateet main australian nirmaataaon ne apane ayask par premium ke liye tark diya, iskaa kaaran yah he ki yah jahaaj ke liye bahut sasta he
 Currently iron ore reserves are quite large, but some people say that the rate at which there is a continuous exponential growth in its consumption, it may even limit the source of this resource
 udhaaharan ke liye, world watch institute lester brown kaa suzav he ki 2% prativarsh kii vruddhi ke saath ek bahut sangrakshanvaadi akalan ke aadhaar par louh ayask 64 saal tak hi chal paayegaa
 The oxygen and iron atoms in iron ore are bonded together as molecules
 ise dhatvik louh main badalane ke liye iskaa pragalan karnaa padataa he or isamen se oxigen ko hataane ke liye ise ek pratyaksh apchayan kii prakriya se guzarana padataa he
 Oxygen-iron bonds are very strong, and to separate iron from oxygen, a more strong element bond must be present that can combine oxygen with itself
 iske liye carbon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he kyonki adhik taapmaana par carbon-oxigen bandha kii prabalata louh-oxigen bandha kii tulana main ucch hoti he
 In this way, iron ore is grinded and mixed with coke and ignited in the smelting process
 haalanki, yah itnaa aasaan nahin he jitna dikhataa he; louh se alag hone vaali oxigen pehle carbon mono oxide banaati he
 In this way, the process of smelting of iron and carbon is carried out in a state of low oxygen so that the carbon burns to form CO and not CO2
 kuch tatwon kii yahaan tak ki bahut thodi maatra kaa paaya janaa bhi louh ayask ke vyavhaar yaa pragalan kii gatividhiyon ko bahut adhik prabhavit karata he
 These effects can be good and bad as well, some can be very bad
 kuch rasayanon jaise flux ko jaanboojh kar milaayaa jaataa he jo blast fernence kii kriya ko adhik prabhavi banaate hai
 Others are added because they make iron more liquid, or give it some more desirable properties
 ayask, eendhan or flakes kaa chunaav is baat ko nirdhaarit karata he ki dhaatumal kaise vyavhaar karata he or utpann louh kii visheshtaayen kya hongi
 Ideally iron ore only contains iron and oxygen
 vastav main aisa bahut kam dekha jaataa he
 Typically, iron ore contains many elements, often undesirable in modern steel
 silica lagbhag hameshaa louh ayask main paaya jaataa he
 Most of this silica separates as clinker in the smelting process
 1300° se adhik taapmaana par kuch kaa apchayan ho jaataa he or yah louh ke saath mishra dhaatu banaata he
 The hotter the furnace, the more silicon in the iron
 16 veen se 18 veen shatabdi ke europea kachche louh main 1
 It is not uncommon for silicon to be found up to 5%
 silicon kaa pramukh prabhaav yah he ki yah dhoosar louh ke nirmaan ko badhaava detaa he
 Gray iron is less brittle and easier to give a finish than white iron
 isiilie dhalaai kii prakriya main ise praathamikta di jaati he
 According to Turner's report, silicon also reduces contraction, reduces holes caused by the gas released during its cooling and makes casting more efficient
 phosphorus ke louh par chaar pramukh prabhaav padate hai: yah isaki kathorta or prabalata ko badhata he, thos hone ke taapmaana ko kam karata he, taralata ko badhaata he, jaldi thanda hone main madad karata he
 Depending on what purpose the iron will be used for, it can have a good or bad effect
 bog ayask main aksar phosphorus kii unchi maatra hoti he
 The concentration and hardness of iron increases with the concentration of phosphorus
 dhalwaan louh main 0
 05% phosphorus makes it hard as medium carbon steel
 adhik phosphorus se yukt louh ko thande main hi hathaudon se kathor kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of hardness is true for any concentration of phosphorus
 jitna zyada isamen phosphorus hota he utana hi louh adhik kathor ho jaataa he or ise hathaudon ke dwaara or adhik kathor banaaya ja saktaa he
 Modern steel makers can increase hardness by up to 30%, for which they have a phosphorus level of 0
 07 or 0
 Maintains between 12% and is also resistant to iron shock
 yah shaman ke kaaran kathorta ko or adhik badhaata he, lekin saath hi ucch taapmaana par louh main carbon kii vileyata ko bhi kam karata he
 This reduces its usefulness in the manufacture of blister or blister steel, where the amount and speed of absorption of carbon is very important
 phosphorus ke louh main paae jane kaa ek nimna paksh bhi he
 0
 2% se adhik sandratha main paae jane par louh teji se kam avadhi main thanda ho jaataa he, yaa kam taapmaana par bhangur ho jaataa he
 Quick cooling is especially important in iron rod
 haalanki, chadi vaala louh aamtaur par garm kar ke hi kaam main liya jaataa he, lekin yaa sakht, hona chahie, aasaani se mud jane yogya hona chahie or kamare ke taapmaana par aghat rodhi bhi hona chahie
 a nail that is shattered to pieces by a hammer or a wheel that breaks into a rock, will not get a good price when sold
 phosphorus kii ucch sandratha kisi bhi louh ko vyarth bana sakati he
 The effects of quick cooling increase with temperature
 is prakaar se, louh kaa ek tukda, jo garmiyon main purna rup se upyogi he, vah sardiyon main bahut adhik bhangur ho saktaa he
 There is evidence that during the Middle Ages very rich people held swords containing high phosphorus in summer and low phosphorus swords in winter
 phosphorus kaa saavdhaneepurvak niyantran dhalaai kii prakriya main bahut adhik phydemand ho saktaa he
 Phosphorus lowers the liquidity temperature, thereby iquidus depresses the temperature, allowing the iron to stay longer and increases for molten fluidity
 1% maatra kaa badhaaya janaa pighale hue louh ko baha kar doguni duuri tak le jayega
 Maximum impact, around 500 ° C, ko 10
 2% sandratha par praapt kiya jaataa he
 For foundry work Turner found that 0 in ideal iron
 2-0
 55% was phosphorus
 parinami louh ko jab saanchon main bharaa gaya to isamen rikt sthaan kam the or isamen sankuchan bhi kam hua
 In the 19th century, some producers of ornamental cast iron used iron containing 5% phosphorus
 charam taralata ne unhen bahut adhik jatil lekin najuk dhalaai main madad kii
 However, they could not carry the load because they lacked strength
 vahaan ucch phosphorus lohe ke liye do upachaar kar rahe hai
 Is old and easy, avoidance
 yadi kisi ke dwaara utpaadit louh jaldi thanda hota he, to vah louh ayask kaa ne strot khojega
 The second method involves mixing iron oxide and oxidizing phosphorus during the mining process
 yah takanic aamtaur par 19 veen sadi main pudling se sambandhit he, jise sambhavatya jaldi nahin samajha gaya
 For example, Isaac Zane, owner of Marlborough Iron, did not know it in 1772
 bataaya jaataa he ki zaane aadhunik vikaas ke liye pratishthit the, yah takanic virgina or pencilvenia ke aayran masters ke liye bhi agyaat thi
 Phosphorus is a harmful contaminant, as it makes the steel brittle, regardless of 0
 6% kii alp sandratha main hi upasthit ho
 Phosphorus cannot be easily removed with the help of flux or smelting and therefore the amount of phosphorus must be reduced to work on iron ore
 bharat kaa louh stambh jisamen jang nahin lagata use phosphoric sanghatan ke dwaara parirakshit kiya gaya he
 Phosphoric acid has been used as a rust modulator, since phosphoric iron is less susceptible to oxidation
 aluminium kii laghu maatra kai ayskon or kuch lim stone main upasthit hoti hai
 The ore is washed before smelting to remove the former
 eent ke astr vaali bhatti main daalane se pehle, aluminium kaa sandushan itnaa kam hota tha ki iskaa louh yaa dhaatumal par koi prabhaav nahin padataa tha
 However, when bricks began to be used to internalize the furnace floor and the lining of the blast furnace, the amount of aluminum increased dramatically
 aisa dhaatumal ke dwaara bhatti ke aantarik str ke apradan ke karan hota tha
 Aluminum is very difficult to reduce
 iske parinamswaroop louh kaa aluminium sandushan ek samasya nahin he
 However, it increases the viscosity or viscosity of the clinker
 iske bhatthi ke sanchaalan par kai pratikul prabhaav padate hai
 The dense slag will be charged slowly and this will increase the time taken in this process
 aluminium kii adhik maatra bhi dravit dhaatumal ko hataane main samasya paidaa karegi
 At the extreme, it will be the cause of a frozen furnace
 adhik aluminium se yukt dhaatumal main kai vilyan hote hai
 The first is to stop; Do not use ore or lime source in sources with high aluminum content
 lim flux ke anupaat ke badhane se viscasita kam ho jaayegi
 Sulfur or sulfur is a contaminant often found in coal
 yah kai ayskon main alp maatra main paaya jaataa he, parantu ise calsikaran ke dwaara hataaya ja saktaa he
 Sulfur melts quickly in both liquid and solid states of iron at the temperature present in the smelting of iron
 sulfur yaa gandhak kii bahut kam maatra ke prabhaav taatkaalik or gambheer hote hai
 These were first worked by iron manufacturers
 sulfur louh ko laal banaata he or isse yah jaldi garm hota he
 When heated quickly, iron is brittle in hot state
 yah ek gambhir samasya thi kyonki 17 veen or 18 veen sadi ke dauraan prayukt louh dhalwaan louh yaa baar aayran hota tha
 The cast iron is repeatedly beaten with a hammer to give shape to the cast
 ek jaldi garm hone vaale louh kaa tukda hathaudaa maarane par tut jayega
 When a piece of hot iron or steel breaks, the exposed surface is immediately oxidized
 oxide kii yah parat welding dwaara daraar kii marammat karne main baadha pahunchaati he
 Larger cracks cause iron or steel to break
 choti daraaron ke karan vastu kaa samay par upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 How quickly it heats depends on the amount of sulfur present
 vartmaan main 0
 Iron containing more than 03% sulfur is not used
 jaldi garm hone vaala louh kaam kar saktaa he, lekin yah kam taapmaana par kaam karata he
 Working at low temperatures requires more physical effort than either Smith or the foremen
 aisa parinaam praapt karne ke liye dhaatu ko praapt karnaa adhik kathin hota he
 a bar with less sulfur may work, but it requires more time and effort
 kachche louh main sulfur safed louh ke nirmaan ko badhaava detaa he
 0 only
 5% tak maatra ke kaaran yah dhire dhire thanda hone lagata he or silicon kii ucch maatra
 White cast iron is more brittle, but also harder
 isse aam taur par bachaa jaataa he, kyonki is par kaam karnaa mushkil hota he, keval china ke alaava jahaan sulfur kii ucch maatra se yukt kaccha louh 0
 Contains 57%, it is made from coal and coke and is used to make bells and chimes
 Turner ke anusaar, achche foundry louh main 0
 15
 pratishat se kam sulfur hona chahie
 Casting iron with high sulfur may be used in the rest of the world, but it will create cast iron of poor quality
 sulfur sandushan ke upachaar ke kai tareeke hai
 The first and most commonly used prehistoric method in history is to avoid it
 china ke vipareet europe main koyale kaa upyog praglan ke liye eendhan ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa tha, kyonki isamen sulfur hota he or isliye iske kaaran louh jaldi garm ho jaataa he
 If an ore forms a metal that heats up quickly, the Ironmaster will search for another
 jab khanij koyale kaa sarvapratham upyog europea blast fernence main 1709 main kiya gaya, to isamen coke milaayaa jaataa he
 Raw coal was used from 1829 before the start of the hot blast
 sulfur ko ayask se roasting or washing hataaya ja saktaa he
 The journey is oxidized by the feed, producing sulfur dioxide, which either flies into the atmosphere or can be washed off
 garm jalwaayu main yah sambhav he kii pyritic ayask ko barsaat main chhod diya jaataa he
 Due to the combined effect of rain, bacteria and heat, sulfides are oxidized to form sulfates, which are soluble in water
 haalanki, aitihaasik rup se, louh sulphide, ek aam louh khanij he, iskaa upyog louh dhaatu ke utpaadan ke liye ek ayask ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Natural weathering was used in Sweden
 yahi prakriya, bhuvaigyanik gati par, gossan lymonite ayask banaati he
 The importance of iron containing low sulfur is demonstrated by the consistently high prices for which iron was paid from Sweden, Russia and Spain from the 16th to 18th centuries
 vartmaan main sulfur koi samasya nahin he
 Modern treatment is the addition of manganese
 lekin, oparator ko pataa hona chahie ki louh main kitna sulfur he, kyonki mangneej kaa paanch guna isamen milaayaa janaa chahie, taaki yah ise niraveshit kar sake
 Some display historical iron manganese levels, but most are lower than the levels required to release sulfur
