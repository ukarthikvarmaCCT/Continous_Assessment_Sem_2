film ke kaary main, mul camera film ko viksit or ek yantric editing mashin se sampadan karne ke liye ek van-lite varkaprint main copy kii jaati he
 An edge code is recorded in the film to indicate the position of the picture frame
 avid yaa final cat pro jaise non-lenior sampadan vyavastha ke viksit hone ke baad se, kuch produkshnon ke dwaara hi film workelo kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In the video workflow, the original camera negative is developed and telesigned for editing with computer editing software
 pikchar frem kii sthiti ko loket karne ke liye video main ek timecode record kiya jaataa he
 During this process the production sound is also enhanced along with the video picture frame
 film sampadak kaa pehla kaam vyaktigat "tex" par aadhaarit sequence se liye gaye raf cat ko nirmit karnaa hota he
 The purpose of rough cut is to choose the best shot and decorate it in order
 nirdeshak aamtaur par yah sunishchit karne ke liye kii anuroop shots kaa chayan kiya jaay, sampadak ke saath kaam karata he
 The next step is to create a fine cut through all the scenes so that it can flow seamlessly with an unbroken story
 trimming, kuch secondon main drishyon ko chhaantane kii ek prakriya, yaa frem bhi, isi charan ke dauraan hota he
 After the final cut is selected and approved by the director and producer, the film is "locked", which means that no changes will be made to it now
 Next, the editor automatically or manually creates a negative cut list or an edit decision list
 ye sampadan suchiyaan fine cat main prayek drishy ke pikchar frem ke strot kii pahchaan karti hai
 Once the picture is locked, it is handed over to the Sound Department's Postproduction Sound Supervision Editor to produce the sound track
 aawaaj recording ko sincranaise kiya jaataa he or ri-recording mixr ke dwaara antim dhwani mishran taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Sound mixing includes dialogue, sound effects, atmos, ADR, Walla, Follage and music
 dhwani trek or pikchar ko ek saath yukt kiya jaataa he or yah film main nimna gunvattta ansar print kaa parinaam he
 Now depending on the recording medium, there are two possible workflows for producing high quality release prints: ant main saamaanya rup se lakshith darshakon ke dwaara film kaa purvavlokan kiya jaataa he or pratikriyaaon ke aadhaar par aage kii shooting or sampadan kiya ja saktaa he
 There can be two ways to put a film together
 ek rasta rekhiy sampadan or anya gaiyr rekhiy sampadan kaa he
 Linear editing uses film as if it is a continuous film
 film ke sabhi bhaag pehle se hi kram main hote hai or unhen idhar-udhar le jane kii yaa karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 In contrast, taped sequence is not taken into consideration in non-linear editing
 drishy chaaron ore ghumaae ja sakate hai yaa hataa bhi die jate hai
 This is the final stage, where the film is released in theaters or, sometimes in a consumer medium, or downloaded directly from the provider
 cinemagharon main vitaran kii jarurat ke hisaab se film ko anulipit kiya jaataa he
 Press kits, posters and other advertising material are published and the film is promoted
 film companiyaan aamtaur par film ko ek launch party, press vijyapti, press ke saath saakshaatkaar, press samiksha scrining or filmotsav screening ke saath relies karti hai
 Most movies have a website
 film chaynit cinemagharon main chalati he or dividi aamtaur par kuch maheenon ke baad jari kii jaati he
 The distribution rights for film and DVD are also generally sold for worldwide distribution
 vitarak or production company laabh ko aapas main baantati he
 Filmmaking also occurs outside the mainstream and is commonly called independent filmmaking
 divi praudyogiki kii shuruuaat ke baad se production ke saadhan or adhik ganatantric ho gaye hai
 Filmmakers can potentially shoot and edit the film, create and edit sound and music, and mix the final cut on their home computer
 haalanki, production ke saadhan bhale hi ganatantric ho jaayan, nivesh, paaramparik vitaran or marketing ke kaaran paaramparik vyavastha se baahar janaa bahut kathin he
 In the past, most independent filmmakers relied on film festivals to focus on their film and sell it for distribution
 baharhaal, internet ne swatantra filmon ke vitaran kaa apekshaakrit sasta madhyam sulabh karaayaa he
 As a result, many companies have risen to assist filmmakers to showcase independent films and sell them in mainstream Internet markets, even many popular Hollywood films
 With digital self-distribution, independent filmmakers, who had failed to garner a traditional distribution deal, have the ability to reach a global audience

 The specialty of concrete is that it gradually becomes solid and hard after adding water to it
 is prakriya ko jaleekaran kehete he
 In this chemical reaction, water, reacting with cement, forms a hard stone material in which other things are tied
 kancreet kaa prayog sadak banane, pipe nirmaan, bhawan nirmaan, neenv banane, pul aadi banane main hota he
 The use of concrete dates back to 2000 BC
 Has been happening since kancreet ke gun un padaarthon par nirbhar hete hai jinase yah banaaya jaataa he, paratu pradhanat: ve us padaarth par nirbhar rahete hai jo pathar, gitti aadi ko paraspar chipkaane ke liye prayukt hota he
 In the 19th century, lime was available for the purpose of the invention of Portland cement, but now lime concrete is used only where there is no need for more confirmation
 adhik pushtataa ke liye cement-kancreet kaa upyog hota he
 Cement concrete can be hardened with steel and used in places where there is a possibility of grabbing or turning, such as in dharms or columns
 kancreet agralikhit padaarthon kaa mishran he : Any inert material, such as a broken stone or brick, large gravel, shade or machine-made bark; baaluu yaa pathar kaa chura yaa pisi eent ; To add the aforementioned substances, alkaline substances such as cement or lime and aavashyaktaanusaar pani
 When this mixture is mixed well and kept only loose enough to reach every corner of the pit or mold, it is filled in a pit or hollow space of any shape, such as the foundation or side of the arch
 can go
 yah cement, pani, baaluu or pathar yaa eent kii gitti athwa badi bajri yaa jhaavaan se banataa he or bhavannirmaan main adhik kaam main aata he
 As mentioned above, when these substances are mixed well, they form a plastic material like potter's clay, which gradually hardens like a stone
 yah kritrim pathar prakruti main milanevaale kanglamaret naamak pathar ke swabhaav kaa hota he
 Due to this property of cement concrete in building construction, it can be easily molded in any place and it can be given any desired form
 iske liye aavashya padaarth praaia: sabhi sthanon main uplabdh rahete hai, parantu sarvottam parinaam ke liye kancreet ko milaane or dhaalane kaa kaam prashikshit mazdooron ko saunpna chahie
 The strength of concrete depends on the proportion of its components and the way they are mixed
 ejiniyari or bhavannirmaan main iske praaia: asankhya prakaar ke upyog ho sakate hai, jinamein baari ninve, pushte, nausthaan kii bhitiyaan, tarangon se raksha ke liye samudr main bani deevaaren, pul, udrodh ityadi brihatkaay sanrachanaayen bhi sammilit hai
 As steel reinforced concrete, it is used for many other structures, such as floors, ceilings, arches, water tanks, arches, large piles of bridges, moorings, pegs under the foundation in soft ground, for ships
 Sea Ghats, and many other compositions
 tikaaupan, pushtataa, saundarya, agni ke prati sahansheeltaa, sastaapan ityadi aise gun hai jinke kaaran bhavannirmaan main kancreet adhikadhik lokapriy hota ja rahaa he or inke kaaran bhavannirmaan main prayukt honevaale pehle ke kai anya padaarth hatate ja rahe hai
 Small pieces of sandstone or brick are called ballast
 gitti ke badale badi bajri aadi kaa bhi upyog ho saktaa he, at: unako bhi ham yahan gitti ke antargat maanenge
 The combined form of both the ballast and the sand is called the corpus
 naap ke anusaar gitti ke nimnlikhit varg hai : Danawi, when the measurement is from 7
5 to 15 cm; moti gitti, 0
5 se 7
5 centimetre tak ; Fine, 0
15 to 5 mm
 gitti kii naap bataane ke liye "sookshmata mapank" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are ten authentic practices to measure, which are the following: 3 inch, 1 inch, 0
5 inch, 0
3 inch, 2
41 millimetre, 1
204 millimetre, 0
599 millimetre, 0
152 millimetre
 2
41 millimeter sieve is also called number 7 sieve and subsequent sieve in number 14, number 25 number 52 and number 100
 sookshmata mapank praapt karne ke liye maal ko in chalaniyon se krmanusaar chalaa jaataa he
 According to the weight of the goods, the percentage left on these sieve is divided by 100
 is prakaar praapt labdhi ko sookshmata mapank kehete hai
 For concrete concrete the fineness modulus should be between 2 and 3, and for coarse precipitate between 5 and 8
 sookshm milaave kaa 90 pratishat ansh inch kii jaali ke paar ho janaa chahie or 100 numberwali jaali par 85 pratishat se kam nahin padaa rahanaa chahie 
 For fine mixing, grinding of sand from the river or sea sand, or from a stone mine is used
 prakritik athwa pisi bajri main mitti, talachat or dhuli taul ke anusaar 3 pratishat se adhik nahin honi chahie tathaa churna kiye gaye pathar main 10 pratishat se adhik dhuli aadi na honi chahie
 Sand etc
 should be free from natural impurities like weeds
 mote milaave ke kam se kam 95 pratishat ko 3 inchavaali chalani se paar ho janaa chahie or kam se kam 90 pratishat ko inchavaali chalani par padaa rahanaa chahie
 Broken stone, broken brick, crushed stone, moss or shade can all be used for coarse mixing
 chai or coke halake kancreet ke liye upyogi hai, parantu baari or pusht kaam ke liye chooney kaa pathar, granite, naaise, trep athwa kadaa balua pathar kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 a soft stone weakened by adhesive should be used
 gitti kuch golakaar ho, ruksh ho, usase chippad na chhuten or todane main pusht ho
 The ballast absorbs more than five percent water by weight
 usamen yathasambhav mitti na ho or pranij padaarth na hon
 While many types of cement are treated according to work and requirement, most of the Portland cement is used for ordinary work
 yah pradhanat: tricalsium silicket, dicalsium silicket, tricalsium aluminete or jipasm kaa mishran hota he
 The first confirmation after adding water comes from aluminates and tricalcium silicate, as they cause more heat when adsorbed to water
 kaam main laane ke pehle cement ko sookhe sthaan main rakhana chahie anyathaa ardrata se cement kharaab ho jayega
 The cement hardened by keeping it in a moist place is of no use
 kabhi-kabhi, jab cement kii boriyaan ek ke upar ek bahut oonchaai tak ladi rahati hai tab neeche kaa cement adhik daab ke kaaran bhi bandh jaataa he, parantu yah cement kharaab nahin rahata or kancreet banaate samay saraltapurvak anya padaarthon ke saath mil jaataa he
 The initial time to harden should not be less than 30 minutes
 kancreet ko saanane ke baad 30 minute ke bheetar hi apane sthaan main dhaal dena chahie
 The last time of hardening should not be less than 10 hours
 saat din ke baad pariksha lene par daab or The water should be clean, it should not contain natural substances, acids, alkalis and any other harmful substances
 sankshep main, jo jal pine yogya hota he vahi kancreet banane ke bhi yogya hota he
 It is very important to measure various materials accurately in concrete making
 jab padaarthon ko aaytan ke anusaar naapakar milaayaa jaataa he tab naapnevaala bartan chota bada hone se antim naap main antar pad jaataa he, iskaa prabhaav bhi antim naap par padataa he
 Then, the type of adulteration and its humidity also have an effect
 maheen milaave main 3
5 pratishat ardrata rahane par aaytan lagbhag 25 pratishat adhik ho jaataa he
 The more fine the mixture is, the greater the volume will increase with humidity
 at: achche kaam main padaarthon ko taulakar milaanaa chahie
 But in general construction works are measured by volume
 at: un sabhi baton par dhyaan rakhana atyant aavashyak he jinase aaytan ghatata badhata he
 The amount of water required for each sack of cement is usually stated in gallons
 sukarta kaa anumaan is baat se kiya jaataa he ki kancreet ke milaane, dhaalane or dhaalane ke baad kootane main kitna samay lagata he
 Dryness depends on the amount of water, the ballast size and the ratio of coarse and fine adulteration
 jal or maheen milaava badhaane se sukarta badhati he
 There are many ways to measure convenience, but the maximum use is only in the mode of descent
 is reeti kaa varnan neeche kiya jaataa he
 The freshly made concrete is poured into a bucketless bucket whose shape is like a cone incisor
 upar kaa vyas 5 inch tathaa neeche kaa 8 inch hota he or oonchaai 12 inch hoti he
 After the concrete is filled into this vessel and cured, the pot is lifted
 tab kancreet kuch baith jaataa he
 The lower the surface of the concrete, the less it is called degeneration
 avpaat jitna hi adhik hoga, sukarta bhi utani hi adhik hogi
 To make the road, 1 inch of concrete is fine
 chat, dharan ityadi main avpaat 1ha inch se 2 inch tak hona chahie
 For pillars and thin walls that are stacked to divide rooms into two or more blocks, the elongation has to be increased by 4 inches, with the concrete spreading all over and leaving no polarity anywhere
 kancreet kii pushtataa, cement ke gun, jal or cement ke anupaat or saghanta kii maatra par nirbhar hoti he
 If the cement remains the same and the ballast and sand are of different sizes in such a way that full density is attained, then the strength of the concrete will depend on the ratio of water and cement
 jal or cement kaa anupaat badhane se, arthath adhik jal milaane se, pushtataa ghatati he, parantu samaran rahe ki pani kii maatra ek nishchit seemaa se kam nahin kii ja sakati
 The amount of water must be at least 0
25 of the cement content to complete the chemical reaction, but more water is required to facilitate and to make the concrete compacted
 0
35 se kam anupaat main pani milakar banaaya gaya mishran praaia: itnaa kharra hota he ki isse kaam nahin liya ja saktaa
 The durability of concrete mainly depends on its density
 kancreet main jitne hi kam randhra rahete hai, usamen utana hi kam kshareey jal athwa anya hanikar padaarth ghul pate hai, isliye usamen utana hi kam kshay hota he
 In order to achieve condensation, as little water should be applied and the ballast ballasts and sand type and quantity should be such that the concrete is not left blank
 mitvyayta yaa sastepan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki cement kam se kam pade or milaane, dhalre tathaa kootane main parishram nunatam lage
 Therefore, it should be kept in mind that no more than the minimum water required for required dryness is released
 in sab baton par vichaar karne se spasht he ki hamen pehle aisa jal-cement-anupaat chunanaa chahie ki aavashyak pushtataa mili or tab maheen or mote milaave ke avyavon kaa is anupaat main rakhana chahie ki acchhee sukarta or purna saghanta ke liye usamen nunatam maatra main jal or cement kaa mishran daalana pade
 The meaning of complete condensation is that all the spaces between the particles of adulteration should be filled with water-cement-mixture and air bubbles will remain
 milaave ke vividh padaarthon ko naap ke anusaar uchit anupaat main milaanaa atyant mahatvapurn he
 This does not only increase the confirmation, but also increases the dryness
 uchit reeti se shreneebaddh gitti-baaluu main sabhi naapon ke kan is prakaar rahete hai ki bade kanon ke bich ke rikt sthaan chote kanon se bhar jate hai, ityadi
 If this happens, all the spaces have to be filled with water-cement-mixture
 isliye kancreet kii charam saghanta ke nimitt milanevaale milaave kii gitti or baaluu ko is prakaar uchit reeti se shreneebaddh kiya jaataa he ki milaave main kam se kam riktata ho jaae
 In some important works, inter-gradation is done for cheapness
 isamen british standard number se 7 kii chalani tak kii bajri ko milaave main sammilit nahin kiya jaataa he
 Generally, a mixture of concrete is prepared in proportion to the volumes of cement, sand and ballast
 kabhi-kabhi cement kii maatra bataane ke liye boriyon kii sankhya bataai jaati he
 Each sack holds 112 pounds or 1
25 cubic feet of cement
 is prakaar 1 : 2 : 4 ke kancreet mishran kaa arth he 1 ghan foot cement, 2 ghanfoot baaluu or 4 ghan foot gitti
 The mixture contains on average 66% to 78% adulteration 7% to 14% cement and 15% to 22% water
 is prakaar 100 ghan foot taiyaar kancreet ke liye kuch milakar lagbhag 155 ghan foot sookhen padaarth kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 It is important that all the substances are mixed well in which there is uniform structure everywhere
 jab kabhi adhik kancreet kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab use haath se milaanaa kathin hota he isliye mashin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In such a machine there is a big drum inside which fans are installed
 dhol ko ingine se ghumaya jaataa he or bheetar cement, baaluu, gitti or pani naapakar daal diya jaataa he
 a good mixture is ready soon
 mishran taiyaar hone ke baad kancreet ko chapapat dhaalnaa or saghan karnaa chahie
 From the moment the water is poured, it should take less than 30 minutes in total
 isapar bhi iskaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki dhaalte samay kancreet ke mishran kaa koi avyav anshat: alag na hone paae
 This means that concrete should not be dropped from too high
 kancreet kii kutai lohe ke chhadon se kerani chahie or is prakriya main chhadon ko kuch dur tak kancreet main ghus janaa chahie
 When the mixture is so dry that this method cannot be used, vibrating devices are used in which it can be fully dense
 sapaat satahon ke liye aise compankariyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo sataha ke upar rakhe jate hai, parantu dharanon or deevaaron ke liye kancreet ke bheetar daale janevaale compankariyon se kaam liya jaataa he
 But if there is no facility for the vibrator to be inserted inside the concrete, then external vibrators are used which move the mold and thus the concrete becomes dense
 kam kutai to hanikaarak he hi, parantu kutai yaa kampan kii adhikta bhi hanikar ho sakati he, kyonki isse kancreet ke avyav alag hone lagate hai or usamen madhumakhi ke chhatey kii tarah rikt sthaan ban jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Therefore, it is pertinent to warn that if only 85 percent density is produced in lieu of full density then only 15 percent of the total strength of concrete will be produced
 jab tak kancreet kadaa hota rahata he tab tak use ardra rakhana chahie
 This action is called maturation
 yah atyant mahatvapurn he ki kadaa hone kii kriya main jitna pani cement ke rasinic sanyog ke liye aavashyak he, utana use miltaa rahe
 If the concrete is not properly matured, the strength is greatly reduced
 kancreet kii pushtataa kaa adhikansh do teen saptahon main utpann hota he, atev itane hi samay tak ko ardra rakhana aavashyak he
 If concrete remains in a dry environment during this time, it becomes more hesitant and as a result it bursts
 yadi taap adhik ho to kancreet kii pushtataa kam samay main aati he
 Therefore, during summer, the mold can be removed in less time than in winter
 yadi kancreet ko bahut sheeghra paripakv karnaa rahata he to kancreet ko bhaap se tapt kiya jaataa he
 Often this has to be done in the construction of roads, because it is inconvenient to keep the roads closed for two to three weeks
 nimnlikhit sarini main vividh sanrachanaon ke kancreet or unke gun dikhaae gaye hai : 28 days later compression capacity, mix pounds per square inch, experiment 1 : 2 : 4 2,250 prabalit kaam main

 1 : 1 : 2 3,450 purv pratibalit kancreet or aisi sanrachanaon main jahaan vishesh pushtataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Concrete that is not reinforced is called plain concrete
 saadhaaran bojwali deevaaron kii nivon main saadhaarant: 1 : 3 : 6 kaa cement kancreet diya jaataa he
 If the ground is hard, the same concrete can be given in the foundation of the pillars
 tanaav main aisa kancreet bahut pusht nahin hota or jab kisi bhaag main tanaav padane kii ashanka rahati he tab use ispaat kii chhadon se prabalit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 When a very large volume, concrete work is made, such as for example, buttress, heavy work floor, etc
, then it is called mass concrete for the purpose
 jab kabhi bahut sa kancreet ek saath dhaala jaataa he tab cement ke jal sokhne se badi garmi utpan hoti he
 At the back when the concrete cools, the internal stress is very high and the concrete is cracked
 isliye udrodh aadi banane main gitti or baaluu ko pehle se khub thanda kar liya jaataa he or kancreet main nal laga die jate hai, jinamein thanda pani pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 This does not increase the temperature
 vipul kancreet ke liye badi naap kii gittiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo vyas main 6 inch tak kii hoti hai
 This costs less water and if water-cement-ratio is not changed, cement also costs less
 falat: bachat hoti he
 Also, the density of concrete also increases
 yah gurutvaudrodh or badi tankiyon ke farsh ke liye mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki ye apni sthirataa ke liye apane hi bhaar par nirbhar rahete hai

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Although some people consider Indian culture to be a mixed form of many cultures, it is not so
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai

 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva

 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body

 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina

 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever

 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra

 While carbon dioxide emissions are lower in most bioplastics production than traditional alternatives, there are some real concerns that if not properly managed, the global bio-economy increases the rate of deforestation
 Will go
 Concerns about water supply and soil erosion are also associated with this
 anya adhyayanon main dikhaaya gaya he ki jaevplastic se carbon padchinh main 42 fisadi kii kami ai he

 Some shell-chemical based plastics are considered biodegradable and can be used as additives to improve the performance of many commercial bioplastics
 gaiyr-jaev avakramit jaev plastic ko tikaoo mana jaataa he
 The speed of biodegradation varies according to temperature, stability of polymer and available amount of oxygen
 natijatan, zyaadaatar jaev plastic audyogic ikaayiyon kii vanaspatik khaad kii ikai kii sakht niyantrit paristhitiyon main hi avakramit hote hai
 Most bioplastics in vegetative manure piles or soil / water are not degraded, although this is not the case with starch based bioplastics
 ek antarrashtriya str par sweekaarya maanak, ien13432, main paribhaashit kiya gaya he ki kitni jaldi or kis had tak vanijyik khaad kii maujuudagi main plastic avakramit hota he, jisase ki ise jaev avakramit kaha ja saktaa he
 It has been published by the International Organization for Standardization and is fully recognized in many countries including Europe, America and Japan
 haalanki ise keval vanijyik khaad ikaayiyon kii aakraamak sthitiyon ke liye banaaya gaya he
 There is no standard applicable for keeping the vegetative manure stage there
 visheshkar prasanskrit shail-rasayan aadhaarit plastic ke utpaadakon dwaara bhi aksar 'jaev avakramit plastic' shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jo ki avakramit hota dikhataa he
 Traditional plastics such as polyethylene are degraded by oxygen and peri-violet rays
 is prakriya ko rokane ke liye nirmaataa sthir karne vaale rasayanon kaa istemaal karte hai
 However, the addition of inducing degradation with plastic may make the controlled pre-violet / oxidation dissolution process possible
 is prakaar ke plastic ko avakramanayukt plastic yaa oxiavakramit plastic yaa photosvakramit plastic kaha ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan microbial karrwai se prakriya shuru nahin hoti he
 Although some degraded plastic manufacturers argue that degraded plastic residues will be attacked by microbes, these degraded materials do not meet the requirements of the commercial botanical manure standard of EN 13432
 The plastics industry is widely critical of oxy-biodegradable plastics
 , Which the Industry Association says does not meet its requirements
 oxos ke naam se jane jane vaale oxo-jaev avakramit plastic paaramparik petroleum aadhaarit utpaada hai jisamen kuch yojya jude hai jinase avakraman shuru hota he
 The ASTM standard used by Oxo manufacturers is just a guideline
 ise sirf 60 fisadi jaev avakraman kii jarurat hoti he, pi-life ek oxo plastic he jiske tahat mitti main 23 degree celsius taapmaana par 545 dinon baad avakraman 66 fisadi tak pahunchane kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ballatus of the National Innovation Agency stated that there is no evidence to prove that biodegraders are capable of truly consuming and degrading oxo plastics
 vahaan is baat kii bhi chintaa rahati he ki jaevplastic maujuuda ricycling pariyojnaon ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Packaging such as HDEP bottles of milk and PET bottles of water and soft drinks can be easily identified and that is why the notion of establishing recycling infrastructure has been successful in many parts of the world
 haalanki, piiti kii tarah plastic piele ke saath nahin mil paata he, aise main agar graahak donon main fark karne main asamarth ho to istemaal nahin hone vaala ricikald piiti milegaa
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan chantai karne kii upyukt praudyogiki par nivesh kar vishisht prakaar kii bottle kaa pataa lagaana sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the first method is not reliable and the second is quite expensive
 bazaar main vikhandan or ab tak ansulajhi paribhaasha kii vajah se jaev plastic ke bazaar ke kul aakaar kaa aankalan karnaa mushkil he, lekin ek aankalan ke mutabik saal 2006 main duniya bhar main isaki kareeb 85,000 ton khapat hui thi
 In contrast, the consumption of all flexible packaging was estimated at 12
3 million tonnes
 siopie or siojiijie ne europea arthvyavastha ke vibhinn kshetron ke liye sambhavit jaev plastic kaa ek aankalan kiya tha
 Total 2,000,000 tonnes per year 2000 se 2008 ke bich ab tak ke teen mahatvapurn kachche maal starch, chini or celulos par aadhaarit jaev avakramit plastic kii duniyabar main khapat 600 fisadi bad gai thi
 The bioplastics business group had expected that by the year 2011, the annual capacity would increase more than three times to 1
5 million
 BCC Research has predicted that biodegradable polymers in the global market will grow at a compound average growth rate of over 17 percent by 2012
 Nevertheless, bioplastics will account for only a small share of the total plastic market, which is predicted to reach 500 billion tonnes globally by the year 2010
 celulos ko chhodkar zyaadaatar jaev plastic takneekee apekshaakrit nai he or philhal shail-plastic ke mukaable keemat main bhi zyada he
 Bio-plastics have not yet reached the energy derived from fossil fuels for their production in the same way as fossil fuels, leaving no opportunity to reduce costs compared to petroleum-based plastics
 haalanki, kuch maamalon main vishesh anuprayogon vaale jaev plastic pehle se hi aparaajey hai kyonki unke shuddh maal kii laagat puure utpaada kii laagat kaa sirf ek hissaa maatr he
 For example, medical implants made of PLA dissolved in the body protect the patient from a second operation
 aksar starch se banane vaale bahulak krishi ke liye compostable malch film istemaal ke baad ekatra nahin kiya jaataa he or use maidan par hi chhod diya jaataa he
 The industrial standard EN 13432 is one of the most international in terms of probability and compliance with which it is claimed that the product resembles botanical manure in the European market
 sankshep main kaha jaae to is maanak ke mutabik ek vyapaarik vanaspatik khaad ikai main 90 fisadi saamagree kaa jaev-avakramit 180 dinon ke andar ho janaa chahie
 At the same time, the ASTM 6400 standard is the regulatory framework of the US and has a slightly less strict rule where 60 percent biodegradation is required in 180 days under commercial vegetative manure conditions
 starch aadhaarit bahut saare plastic, piele aadhaarit plastic or saxinets or adepats jaise kuch eliphatic-aromatic ko-poliester ne ye praaanpatr hasil kar liya he
 Additive plastics sold as photo degraded or oxo-biodegradable do not comply with these standards in their current form
 eestm di6866 prakriya ko jaiviny taur par praapt jaevplastic saamagree ko pramanit karne ke liye hi viksit kiya gaya he
 The cosmic rays collide with the atmosphere means that some carbon is radioactive isotopic carbon-14
 ped-paudhe vaataavaran main maujuud CO2 kaa istemaal prakaash sanshleshan main istemaal karte hai, isliye nae paudhe kii saamagree main carbon-14 or carbon-12 donon maujuud honge
 Under the right conditions and geological timelines, the remains of organisms can be transformed into fossil fuels
 ek lakh saalon ke baad mul jaev saamagree main maujuud sabhi carbon-14 kaa radiodharmee kshay ho jayega or sirf carbon-12 batch jayega
 jaev eendhan se taiyaar utpaada main apekshaakrit zyada maatra main carbon-14 hota he, vahiin shail-rasayan se bane utpaada main koi carbon-14 nahin hota he
 The amount of renewable carbon present in a material can be measured with a catalytic mass spectrometer
 jaev avakramit or jaev aadhaarit saamagree main ek mahatvapurn antar hota he
 Bioplastics such as high-density polyethylene may be 100 percent bio-based, yet are non-biodegradable
 in sabake baavjood echdipii jaise jaevplastic greenhouse kii kami karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he, khaskar tab jab urja utpaadan main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The bio-based components of these bioplastics are considered to be carbon neutral as they originate from biofuels
 eestm di5511-02 or eestm di5526 pareekshan ke tareeke hai jo iesao diaies 15985 jaise antarrashtriya maanakon kaa anupaalan karte hai
 Sogda, Sogdia or Sogdiana was an ancient civilization located in Central Asia
 yah aadhunik uzbekistan ke samarkand, bukhaaraa, khujand or shahar-e-sabz ke nagaron ke ilaake main faili hui thi
 The people of Sogda spoke a language called Sogdai which was the eastern Iranian language and became extinct with time
 mana jaataa he ki aadhunik kaal ke tajik, pashtun or yagnobi logon main se bahut inhi soudai logon ke vanshaj hai
 Note that the pronunciation of 'G' in 'sogda' is slightly different from 'G'
 sonda ke log swatantraaa-pasand or ladaake maane jate the or unka raashtra iran ke hakhaamani samrajya or shaq logon ke bich sthit tha
 When the Greek forces led by Alexander the Great arrived here in 327 BCE, they captured the famous fort called Sogdai Shila
 unhone bactria or sonda ko ek hi rajya main shaamil kar diya
 Soddai freedom from this died such that it could never come back again
 phir yahan ek unani raajaaon kaa silsilaa chalaa
 In 248 BCE, Diodotos i laid the foundation of yavan-bactrian rule here
 aage chalakar yuthidimos ne yahan sikke gadhe jinaki nakal sabhi kshetreey shaskaon ne kii
 Eukratidis i broke away from Bactria and for some time ran a separate Greek kingdom in Sogda
 150 ipu main shaq or anya banjaaraa jatiyaan akraman karke is kshetra main bas gai or yahan phir unka raaj shuru ho gaya
 China too had thick eyes on this area
 ise pashchimi kshetra kaa hissaa mana jaataa tha or chini khojayatriyon ne sonda ko "kangaju" kaa naam diya
 China invaded this area in 36 BC
 is kshetra se phir china or pashchim ke ilaaqon ke bich vyapaar badhane laga
 Sogda came on the silk route and the Sogdai people got into business with great vigor
 soudai bhashaa madhya asia main vyapaar kii bhashaa ban gai or bahut se gair-soudai bhi ise seekhney-bolne lage
 It is possible that most of the trade between China and India at this time was run by Soddai people
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki samay ke saath sonda main kaafii naitik patan hua or kuuchaa or khotaan main striyon kii bech-kareed hoti thi
 Sogda was incorporated into the Uygur kingdom in the tenth century AD
