 There are actually two types of mental processes underlying the mental process of imagination - first, the recollection of past sensibilities, the form of images and thoughts, that is, memory, second, the creation of those mismatched experiences in a new combination
 lekin kalpana main in donon prakaar kii kriyaaon kaa itnaa adhik sammishran rahata he ki na to inkaa alag-alag adhyayan hi kiya ja saktaa he or na inaki alag-alag spasht anubhuti hi vyaktivishesh ko ho paati he
 For this reason, imagination is called a highly complex mental process
 kalpana evam chintan kii maansik prakriyaaon kii prakruti itani adhik samaan hoti he ki saadhaaran bhashaa main kabhi-kabhi inkaa paryaayavachi shabdon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 From the point of view of equality, both actions are a reminder of past experiences and to create a new combination of them, and both actions arise to find a way to satisfy the dissatisfied needs and desires of the person
 lekin donon ke uddeshy bhinn hote hai
 Imagination seeks unrealistic, irrational and imaginary creative solutions to the satisfaction of needs, the purpose of thinking is always to find logical and real solutions and that is why it is also called logical action
 chintan kii kriya tab tak prarambh nahin hogi jab tak koi vaastavik samasya aavashyaktaaon kii santushti main maarg main upasthit na ho
 But imagination can also begin with the presence of unrealistic and imaginary problems
 kalpana ko bhi do prakaaron main baanta jaataa he
 The first type of fantasy encompasses daydreams and mental flights with the help of which a person creates an imaginary world, which becomes more important for the satisfaction of his needs than the actual world
 is prakaar kii kalpana se sabhi saamaanya vyakti labhanvit hote hai tathaa apni bhautik asamarthta ke maansik kuprabhav se apni raksha karte hai
 But the frequency of this type of imagination becomes a predominant symptom of mental patients, which results in the creation of bizarre illusions
 duusare prakaar kii kalpana sarjanaatmak naam se abhihit hoti he jiske antargat aisi kaalpanik udaanen gini jaati hai jinke dwaara saahitiyik, kalatmak vaigyanik, sarjanaatmak rachanakaarya hote hai
 Only creative people can do creative compositions
 sarjanaatmak kalpana kaa vishleshan karte hue pratibhashali helmholts, pvaankaar, graham vailes aadi ne isaki chaar avasthaaen bataai hai–taiyaari, nilyan, uchhwasan tathaa pramaapan 
 In the first stage, the creator examines the reality of his problem and purpose by uniting various facts and observations
 duusari avasthaa main koi spasht pragati drushtigat nahin hoti lekin, vastav main, vibhinn upakalpanaaon kaa aantarik manan chalata rahata he
 The most important is the third stage in which divine inspiration is attained and creation is done
 agar yah srijan kaary vaigyanik upakalpana ke rup main he to uski satyata ko pramanit karnaa hota he tathaa, agar vah saahitiyik vaa kalatmak srijan kaary he, to use apane-apane prakaashan ke madhmamon se vyakti karnaa hota he
 The facts that psychologists Rousman, Beade, and Platt and Baker have obtained from researchers and scientists, and C
 Patrick Madam from poets and painters, support these four stages of creative imagination
 kalpana ke shaareerik aadhaar ke sambandh main bhi do prakaar ke siddhant prachlit hai–pehla, kendriya siddhant ke anusaar, jo pracheen siddhant he, kalpana mastishk kii jatil kriyaaon par aadhaarit he or uskaa hi ek ang he
 Secondly, it is known as motivational or periphery theory, according to which imagination is a behavior, so it also contains the physical functions of the senses, brain and muscles like ordinary behavior
 is siddhant kaa samarthan vibhinn manovaigyanik prayogon ke madhyam se jaikbasan, maiks, sha, aserinsky or kalitmaan aadi ne kiya he or yahi siddhant dinondin adhik maanya hota ja rahaa he

 But this argument is not valid by all experts
 africa hathi kii ek teesri jati bhi prastaavit kii gai he jise pashchimi hathi kii sangya di gai he
 Scientists analyzing DNA analysis of African bush elephants, African wild elephants, Asian elephants, extinct American mastodons and mammoths came to the conclusion in 2010 that the African bush elephant and African wild elephant are arguably two distinct species
 unhone likhaa : This reclassification has great importance in terms of conservation
 abhi tak haathiyon ko ek hi jati kaa maanakar puri aabaadi kaa ek saath hi aankalan kiya jaataa tha
 But after reclassification, it will be convenient to figure out the population of elephant of a particular caste and find out which caste elephant is more in need of protection, because the law for the protection of elephant whose population comes within the periphery of the definition of threatened and Will have to be hardened and there will be a ban on illegal poachers and smugglers, trade of animals or their body parts belonging to that caste
 africa junglee hathi tathaa africa bush hathi paraspar prajnan kar sakate hai, haalaanki jangal main unke pruthak pariveshon ko apanaaye jane ke kaaran aise maukey kam hi milte hai

 san 1979 i main yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki africa haathiyon kii aabaadi 13 lakh kii he
 This conjecture is controversial and it is believed that this is an epistemology, but this fact is widely mentioned and has now become virtually the basis of estimation, which is falsely quantified as a continuous decline of caste

 Elephant teeth are completely different from other mammals
 puri umr bhar unke 28 daant hote hai
 These are: - anya stanpaayiyon ke vipareet, jinke doodh ke daant jhadane ke baad sthai daant aa jate hai, hathi ke daant nirantar badali hote rahete hai
 At the age of about one year, the leading milk teeth of ivory fall and ivory starts growing
 kintu chabane vaale daant ek hathi kii aayu main qareeb paanch baar yaa bahut virale hi chah barbadali hote hai
 Only four chewing teeth at a time, one on each side of both jaws, are used
 maanav daanton ke vipareet pakke daant doodh ke daanton ko upar kii taraf se nahin dhakelte hai
 Otherwise, new teeth grow in the back of the mouth and push the old teeth towards the front where the old teeth fall apart
 africa haathiyon main janm se hi chabane vaale daanton kaa pehla samooh maujuud hota he
 When the cub is two years old, the first chewing tooth on both sides of both jaws falls

 Elephants are gray in color, but African elephants appear to be red or brown in different colored soils
 geeli mitti main lotna hathi samaaj kii dincharya kaa ek abhinn ang hota he
 Not only is rolling important for socialization, but soil also acts as an anti-sunburn and protects its skin from ultraviolet rays
 hathi kii twachaa kathor hone ke baavjood samvedansheel hoti he
 If he does not bathe the soil regularly, then his skin can get damaged due to burning, insect bites and moisture
 mitti main lotane se twachaa ko hathi ke sharir kaa taapmaana niyantrit karne main madad milti he
 Elephants have difficulty extracting body heat from their skin, as the skin is very small in proportion to the body
 hathi ke vazan or uski twachaa ke satahi kshetrafal kaa anupaat manushya kii tulana main bahut adhik hota he
 Elephants have been seen raising their legs and trying to keep their feet at bay by keeping them cool
 hathi ke pairon ki banaavat mote stambhon yaa khambhon ke samaan hoti he
 Elephants require less power than muscles to stand because of their straight legs and large padded legs
 isi kaaran, hathi bina thake bahut lambey samay tak khadey rah sakate hai
 In fact, African elephants are rarely seen lying down, usually lying down when they are ill or injured
 iske vipareet asian hathi aksar letnaa pasand karte hai
 Elephant's legs are almost round
 africa haathiyon ke prayek pichley pair par teen nakhun or prayek saamne ke pair par chaar nakhun hote hai
 Indian elephants have four nails on each hind leg and five nails on each front leg
 pair kii haddiyon ke neeche ek kadaa, shleshi padaarth hota he jo ek gadde yaa shoker ke rup main kaary karata he
 Elephant's weight causes the feet to swell, but when the weight is removed it becomes the same as before
 isi kaaran se geeli mitti main gaharaa dhans jane ke baavjood hathi apni taangon ko aasaani se baahar khinch letaa he
