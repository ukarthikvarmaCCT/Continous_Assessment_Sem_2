 Truth works can be generated only due to truth
 sankhya darshan prakruti se sristi rachana or sanhaar ke kram ko vishesh rup se maanata he
 Along with this, the ultimate subtle cause of nature and its 24 functional substances are described clearly
 purush 25 waan tatv mana gaya he, jo prakruti kaa vikaar nahin he
 Thus, nature is the cause of all activities, but there is no reason for nature, because it has eternal power

 According to this theory, the meditation of God is internal

 Just as the entire ritual is based on the appropriation of mantras, the Mimamsa philosophy also supports the appropriation of mantras and its legislation
 dharm ke liye maharishi jaimini ne veda ko bhi param pramaan mana he
 According to him, the appropriation of mantras, shruti, sentence, case, place and Samakhya are considered as the fundamental basis in Yajna
 vedant kaa arth he vedon kaa antim siddhant
 The Brahmasutra composed by Maharishi Vyasa is the basic text of this philosophy
 is darshan ko uttar mimasaa bhi kehete hai
 According to this philosophy, being the doer-bearer and exterminator of the universe is the reason for the world
 upadan athwa abhinn kaaran nahin
 Brahma is omnipotent, omnipotent, blissful, eternal, eternal, eternal
 saath hi janm maran aadi cleshon se rahit or niraakaar bhi he
 It is clear from the first formula of this philosophy, that is, Brahma curiosity, that what one wants to know is different from Brahm, otherwise how can there be a desire to know oneself
 or yah sarvavidit he ki jeevatma hameshaa se hi apane dukhon se mukti kaa upaay karti rahi he
 But the quality of Brahma is different from this

 isa ke janm ke purv or baad kii ek do shatabdiyon main anek darshanon kii samanaantar dharaayen bhartiya vichaarbhumi par pravaahit hone lageen
 They also include streams of Buddhist and Jain philosophies

 He introduced a new religious tradition independent of the Vedas
 vedon ko na maanane ke kaaran jain or buddha darshanon ko "naastik darshan" bhi kehete hai
 Their original literature is in the form of the teachings of Mahavira and Buddha, which are found in the Prakrit and Pali lingua franca respectively and after the nirvana of these great men, the collection was done in consultation with their followers in many musicals
 buddha or mahavir donon himalay pradesh ke rajkumaar the
 He preached and preached his religions in his youth, taking renunciation
 unka yah sanyas upanishdon kii parampara se prerit he
 The glory of asceticism and renunciation in Jainism and Buddhism is also favorable to the philosophy of the Upanishads
 ahimsa or aachaar kii mahatta tathaa jatibhed kaa khandan in dharmon kii visheshta he
 The seeds of non-violence also exist in the Upanishads
 phir bhi ahimsa kii dhwaja ko dharm ke akaash main fahraane kaa shrey jain or buddha sampradaayon ko dena hoga
 The tradition of Jainism has continued from the teachings of Mahavir Swami till today
 mahavir swami ke upadesh 41 sutron main sankalit hai, jo jainagamon main milte hai
 Umaswati's "tattvaartadhigam Sutra" is an ancient and authentic scripture of Jain philosophy

 In Jainism, the soul is as broad and expanding as light
 punarjanm main naveen sharir ke anusaar aatma kaa sankoch or vistaar hota he
 By nature he is enlightened and blissful
 vah man or indriyon ke madhyam ke bina paroksh vishyon ke gyaan main samarth he
 There are three forms of this supernatural knowledge - periodology, mind: synonym and mere knowledge
 purna gyaan ko kevalgyaan kehete hai
 It is attained in the state of nirvana
 yah sab prakaar se vastuon ke samast dharmon kaa gyaan he
 This knowledge is "proof"

 This is called "asrav"
 yahi aatma kaa bandhan he
 The inhibition of this motion from asceticism, renunciation and virtue is called "sanvar" and the loss of accumulated karmapudgal is called "nirjara"

 buddha ke upadesh teen pitakon main sankalit hai
 These are called Sutta Pitaka, Vinay Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka
 ye pitak buddha dharm ke aagam hai
 The notion of functional truth is a fundamental feature of Buddhism
 upanishdon kaa brahm achal or aparivartansheel he
 According to Buddha, change is the truth
 pashchimi darshan main hairaclitis or bergasaan ne bhi parivartan ko satya mana
 There is also no irreversible basis for this change
 bahya or aantarik jagat main koi dhruv satya nahin he
 External substances are the effects of "observations"
 aatma bhi manobhaavon or vigyaanon kii dhara he
 Thus "buddhism" is founded by denying the subjectivism of the Upanishads in Buddhism
 phir bhi baudhdhamat main karm or punarjanm maanya hai
 Buddhism is filled with compassion even if the soul is not respected

 Seeing the cause of grief in Avidya, Trishna, etc
, they told their annihilation to be the path of nirvana

 Conspiracy theory is a term originally used to refer to a neutral descriptor of a civil, criminal or political conspiracy claim
 haalanki, yah baad main kaaphi apmanjanak ho gaya or puri tarah sirf haashiye par sthit us siddhant ke liye prayukt hone laga, jo kisi aitihaasik yaa vartmaan ghatana ko lagbhag atimanviya shakti praapt or chaalaak shadyantrkariyon kii gupt sajeesh ke parinaam ke rup main vyakhyayit karata he
 Conspiracy theories are viewed with skepticism by scholars, as they are rarely supported by conclusive evidence and contrary to institutional analysis, which focuses on the collective behavior of people in publicly known entities and which is historically And scholarly materials to explain current events and on facts recorded in mainstream media reports Held there, not the motives and speculative actions of secretive coalitions of individuals
 isliye yah shabd aksar halke rup se ek vishwaas ko chitrit karne ke prayaas ke rup main prayukt hota he, jo vicitra tarah kaa jhooth ho or sanakee ke rup main chihnit kiye hue yaa unmaadi prakruti ke logon vaale samooh dwaara vyakt kiya gaya ho
 is tarah kaa chithran apane sambhavit anauchity or anupyuktata ke kaaran aksar vivaad kaa vishay hota he
 According to political scientist Michael Barkun, conspiracy theories were once marginalized or limited to a small number of people, but have now become common to public media
 ve tark dete hai ki isane shadyantrwaad kii avadharana paidaa hone main yogadan diya, jo 20 veen sadi ke aakhir or 21 veen sadi ke prarambh main sanyukt rajya america main saanskrithik ghatana ke rup main ubhara or janata ke man main raajnneetik karrwai ke prabhavi pratimaan ke rup main loktantr ke sambhavit pratisthaapan ke rup main sajeesh ko mana gaya
 According to anthropologists Todd Sanders and Harry G
 West "the evidence suggests that today a broad class of Americans xxrep 5 
 accepts at least some of the theories of conspiracy as true
 " isliye shadyantr ke siddhanton main vishwaas samajashastriyon, manovaigyanikon or lokkathaon ke visheshgyon kii ruchi kaa ek vishay ho gaya he
 The term "conspiracy theory" can be a neutral modifier for any legitimate or illegal claim of civil, criminal or political conspiracy
 shadyantr karne kaa matlab he, "kisi avaidh yaa galat kaary ko puraa karne ke liye ek gupt samjhauta karnaa yaa kisi vaid makasad ko hasil karne ke liye aise tareekon kaa upyog karnaa
" haalanki, shadyantr ke siddhant kaa prayog ek varnanaatmak vidha kii ore ingit karne ke liye bhi hota he, jisamen bade shadyantron ke astitv ke liye vyapak tarkon kaa ek gada chayan shaamil ho
 In this sense the term "theory" is sometimes considered more informal as "speculation" or "preconception" rather than mainstream scientific theory
 iske alaava sajeesh shabd aam taur par shaktishaalee chehron, aksar un pratishthanon ke liye prayukt hota he, jinpar ek badi jansankhya ko dhokhaa dene kaa vishwaas kiya jaataa he, jaise raajnneetik bhrashtachar
 haalanki kuch shadyantr vastav main siddhant nahin hote, lekin ve aksar aam janata dwaara is rup main chihnit kar diye jate hai
 The first recorded use of the phrase "conspiracy theories" dates from 1909
 multah yah ek tatasth shabd tha, lekin 1960 ke dashak main hui raajnneetik uthapatak ke baad isane apane vartmaan apmanjanak arth ko dhaaran kiya
 It joined the Oxford English Dictionary as a supplement in late 1997
 "shadyantr siddhant" shabd vidwaanon or lokapriy samskritiyon dwaara "logon" se takat, paisa yaa aazaadee kaa "haran karne" ke makasad se kii gayi gupt sainya, banking, yaa raajnneetik karravaayiyon kii pahchaan ke liye baar baar prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In a less prevalent sense, it is used as folklore and urban historiography and a variety of interpretive narratives, which are associated with mythology
 yah shabd in daavon ko swat: khaarij karne ke apmanjanak arth main bhi istemaal hota he, jo haasyaaspad, nasamajhipurn, paagalpan bharaa, niraadhaar, vicitra yaa ataarkik ho
 udhaaharan ke liye "waterget shadyantr siddhant" shabd aam taur par sweekrut arth ke liye nahin hota he, jisamen vastav main kai pratibhaagiyon ko shadyantr ke chalate doshi tehraaya gaya or dusron ko aarope darj karne se pehle hi maaf kar diya gaya, balki iskaa vaikalpik or atirikt siddhanton vaale arth ke liye kiya jaataa he jaise ye daawey ki "deep throt" kaha jane vaala soochna strot gadha hua tha
 In his opening article titled "adapted from a Study Prepared for the CIA", Daniel Pipes attempted to define it, believing in distinguishing the 'mindset conspiracy' from more traditional patterns of thought
 unhone ise is rup main paribhaashit kiya: jo dikhataa he, vah dhokhaa he; shadyantr itihaas ko sanchalit karata he; kuch bhi avyavasthit nahin he, dushman hameshaa takat, shoharat, paisa or sex hasil karata he
 According to West and Sanders, when conspiracies were being talked about in the Vietnam era, Pipes incorporated the marginalized elements into thinking that conspiracies played a major role in major political scandals and murders, which in the Vietnam era Shook American politics
 "he sees a frenzied style in any significant historical or socio-scientific analysis of oppression
 " Political scientist Michael Barkun has categorized conspiracy theories in ascending order of width, which are as follows: ek vaishvik vichaar shadyantr ke siddhanton ko kendrit rup main itihaas main kabhi-kabhi "shadyantrwaad" ke rup main darj karata he
 Historian Richard Hofstadter in an essay titled The Paranoid Style of American Politics, published in 1964, discusses the role of paranoia and conspiracyism throughout American history
 barnard belin kii shastreey pustak da idological origins of american revolushan main kaha gaya he ki is tarah kii avadharana america kranti ke dauraan paayi ja sakati he
 Conspiracyism then marks the attitudes of the people as well as those types of conspiracy theories which are more global and historical in proportion
 shadyantrwaad shabd 1980 ke dashak main shikshavid frank pi
 mintj dwaara lokapriy kiya gaya
 In relation to conspiracy theories and conspiracyism, a wide range of calibrations can be introduced as a basis for the study of the genre from academic work
 shadyantrwaad ke agrani vidwaanon main shaamil hai: hophstadter, karl poper, maaikel barkun, robert alan goldvarg, dainiel pips, mark fenster, mintj, karl sagon, jorge johnson or gerald posnar
 According to Mintz, conspiracyism is an indicator: "belief in the primacy of conspiracies in open history
": "shadyantrwaad america or anya jagahon main vibhinn raajnneetik or saamaajik samoohon kii jarurat ko puraa karata he
 It identifies the elite, blames them for economic and social catastrophe and believes that once they were removed from positions of power through popular action, the situation could have been somewhat better
 jaise, shadyantr ke siddhant ek khaas yugkaal yaa vichaardhaara ke prakaar nahin bataate
" Throughout human history, political and economic leaders have been the cause of literally large numbers of deaths and disasters, and they have sometimes been involved in promoting conspiracy theories about their goals at the same time
 hitler or stallin sabase pramukh udaahranon main se hai ; anya saare udhaaharan bhi hai
 In some cases, the claims were dismissed as conspiracy theories, but they later proved to be true
 The idea that history itself is controlled by long-term conspiracies was refuted by historian Bruce Cummings: "lekin agar shadyantr maujuud hai, ve shaayad hi kabhi itihaas ko badalte hai; ve samay-samay par seemaant par fark laa sakate hai, lekin unke rachanakaaron ke niyantran ke baahar ek tark ke apratyaashit parinaamon ke saath: or yahi 'shadyantr siddhant' ke saath galat baat he
 History is changed by large forces and extensive structures of human groups
 " The use of the term Conspiracyism Michael Kelly, Chip Burlett and Matthew N
 Is written in Lyons
 berlett or liyons ke anusaar, "shadyantrwaad bali kaa bakra banane kaa ek khaas vrutantaatmak rup he, jo pashachik dushmano ko ek aam taur par bhale kaary ke khilaaf badi aantarik sajeesh main fansaata he, jabaki yah bali ke us bakre ko khatre kii ghanti bajaane vaale vaale nayak ke rup main aankata he
 " shadyantr ke siddhant shikshavidon, rajanetaaon or prachaar madhyamon dwaara vyapak aalochana kaa vishay he
 Perhaps the most controversial aspect of a conspiracy theory is the problem of exposing the truth of a particular theory, so that both the creator and the opposer can satisfy it
 Certain conspiracy charges may vary greatly, but may apply some of the common standards applied in each case to assess their potential truthfulness
 sanyukt rajya america ke pratishthan ke shaikshik aalochak nom chomuski shadyantr ke siddhant ko kam yaa adhik sansthagat vishleshan ke vipareet rakhaa he, jo vyaktiyon ke gupt sathganth ke badale mukhyat: janata, saarvajanik rup se gyaat sansthaaon ke dderghaavadhi vyavhaar va mukhyadhara kii media rapaton par zyada kendrit hoti he
 Controversy The general discussion of conspiracy theory is a matter of some public consensus apart from disputes arising out of the merits of certain conspiracy claims
 vibhinan paryvekshakon dwaara "shadyantr siddhant" shabd ko ek shadyantrpurn daawey kaa nishpaksh varnan qaraar kiya gaya he, jo ek apmanjanak shabd he, jiskaa prayog is tarah ke daawey ko bina pariksha ke khaarij karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or is tarah ke daawey ko badhaava dene waalon dwaara sakaaratmak samarthan dene kaa sanket karne ke liye bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term may be used by some people for an argument they do not fully believe in, but consider it transformative and exciting
 is shabd kaa sabase vyapak rup se sweekrut arth vah he, jo lokapriy samskruti or shaikshanik upyog ke chalan main he or nishchit rup se iskaa vaktaa kii sambhavit satyavadita par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 Conspiracy theories on the Internet are often dismissed as "marginalized" groups, but evidence suggests that a large proportion of Americans today, regardless of ethnic, gender, education, occupation, and other groups - At least some conspiracy theories are considered credible
 is shabd ke lokapriy arth ko dekhte hue bhi inkaa vastav main thos or puure sabooton vaale aaropon ko khaarij karne ke saadhan ke rup main avaidh rup se or anupyukt prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore the validity of each such use will be the subject of some controversy
 In his 1996 essay "the JKF Assassination 2: Conspiracophobia on the Left" written by Michael Paranti, examining the progressive media role in the use of the term, vaastuvaadi or sansthagat vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki is shabd kaa tab durupyog kiya jaataa he, jab vah un sansthaaon par lagu hota he, jo apane sweekrut lakshyon ke anusaar kaary kar rahe hai, jaise munaafe main vruddhi ke liye jab nigamon kaa ek samooh ke mulya ko sthir karne main sanlagn hota he
 Complications can occur for concepts such as ufos, which literally means "unidentified flying object", but it also has an associated meaning with an alien spacecraft, which is associated with certain theories of concept conspiracy, and thus something special It is also associated with social stigma
 maaikel parenti is shabd ke prayog kaa ek udhaaharan dete hai, jo iske khud ke prayog main paraspar virdohi dikhataa he
 they write, "shadyantr siddhant" shabd khud shadyantr siddhant kaa ek prakaar kaa vishay he, jo yah tark detaa he ki shabd kaa prayog charchaa ke vishay ke prati darshakon ke upeksha bhav main jod-tod karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, yaa to sach ko chupaane ke jaanboojhkar kiye gayi prayaas ke rup main yaa jaanboojhkar kii gai sajeesh ke chalaave ke rup main
 When conspiracy theories are presented as official claims, they are not generally considered as conspiracy theories
 For example, some of the decided activities of the House un-american Activities Committee may be called an official attempt to promote conspiracy theory, although its claims are rarely referred to as such
 aage is shabd ke siddhant kii aspashtataa se kathinaaiyaan paidaa hoti hai
 In popular usage, the term is often referred to as speculation based on unfounded or weak facts, leading to the idea that "if it is indeed true then it is not a conspiracy theory
" " In 1936, American commentator H
L
 Menken wrote: kam se kam 1960 ke dashak ke baad se shadyantr ke siddhanton main vishwaas samajashastriyon, manovaigyanikon or lokkathaon ke visheshgyon ke liye ruchi kaa ek vishay ban gaya, jab america raashtrapati jon epa kennedy kii hatya ke baad antat warren ayog kii report main darj tathyon ke aadhaar par maamle ke sarkari sanskaran ke khilaaf janata kii ek abhootpurv pratikriya ai
 According to some psychologists, if one person believes in one theory of conspiracy then others will also believe in it; a person who does not believe in one theory of conspiracy, will not believe in another either
 This may also be due to differences between the information on which the parties believe in formulating their conclusions
 manovaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki shadyantrwaad or shadyantr ke siddhant ke vikaas main arth kii talash aam baat he or yah akele itnaa shaktishaalee ho saktaa he, jo sabase pehle ek vichaar kaa nirmaan kar sake
 ek baar sangyaan hone par pushti kaa purvaagrah or sangyanatmak viswarata kaa parihaar vishwaas ko sudrudh kar saktaa he
 In a context, where a conspiracy theory has become popular in a social group, then communal reinforcement may equally be part of a role
 britain ke kent vishvavidhyalay main kiye gayi kuch shodh se pataa chalata he ki log yah jane bina shadyantr ke siddhanton se prabhavit ho sakate hai ki unka nazirya badal gaya he
 After studying some popular conspiracy theories about the death of Princess Diana of Walls, its participants accurately deduced how much their peers' attitudes had changed, but significantly underestimated them
 How much his attitude has changed in favor of conspiracy theories
 lekhakon ne nishkarsh nikaala ki shadyantr ke siddhanton main 'ek chhipi hui shakti' hoti he, jo logon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Humanist psychologists argue that even though a secret party behind the conspiracy has always had a hostile stance, there is an element of reassurance to conspiracy theorists, as it provides comfort to think that human affairs matters Complications and disturbances are at least borne by humans, not by factors outside human control
 Such a secret party is a tool to reassure itself that some events are not random, but are ordered by human intelligence
 yah pradarshit karata he ki is tarah kii ghatnaein subodh or sambhavit rup se niyantran karne yogya hoti hai
 If the adventures of a clandestine party can be indulged in a sequence of events, there is always little, but hope, but to weaken the strength of a small clandestine group — or to join it and that power itself To use
 Finally a belief in the strength of a small clandestine group is the undisputed assertion of human dignity — even if subconsciously, but necessarily a declaration that the man is not at all helpless, but that he is responsible, at least in some cases, for his own fate

 The important thing is that the group does not include theists
 The believer may feel free from any moral or political obligation to diagnose, even if an institutional or social flaw may be the real source of differences

 Hollywood cinema and TV shows continue to perpetuate and expand the belief in conspiracy as the standard functioning of corporations and governments

 In the context of jfk's assassination, the shooter works with the same system, "as conspiracies work"
 It is interesting that movies and TV shows act like news media in relation to humanization and dramatization of issues, which are easy to incorporate into a conspiracy theory
 ghar aana vietnam yuddh ke ghayal sainik ke lautne ko ek badi samasya main badal detaa he, kyonki ek mauka dikhataa he ki ghayal sainik prem jaal main funs jaayegaa or jab vah aisa karata he to iskaa ek majboot nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki ek badi samasya kaa hal ho gaya
 This aspect is a natural result of the development of Hollywood scripts, which give more importance to one or two lead characters, who are acted by big stars and thus establish a good way of marketing the film, but after testing Chakravyuh of illegal people is exposed

 Nowadays "news" is almost always dramatized in the concept of fictional journalism, at least "one side" is offered against the other, the concept that all stories must include "both sides" or There should be more intense theatrical developments like feature films
 Through this explicit dramatization, the media reinforces the idea that all things are intentionally for the benefit of someone, which may be another definition, at least, of political conspiracy theories

 Daniel Pipes wrote an article in the Jerusalem Post in 2004 titled Fusion Paranoria: The politically disaffected: Blacks, the hard Right, and other alienated elements 
 Their theories imply a political agenda, but lack much of a following
 The culturally suspicious: These include "kennedy assassinologists," "ufologists," and those who believe a reptilian race runs the earth and alien installations exist under the earth's surface
 Such themes enjoy enormous popularity, but carry no political agenda
 The major new development, reports Barkun, professor of political science in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, is not just an erosion in the divisions between these two groups, but their joining forces with occultists, persons bored by rationalism
 Occultists are drawn to what Barkun calls the "cultural dumping ground of the heretical, the scandalous, the unfashionable, and the dangerous" – such as spiritualism, Theosophy, alternative medicine, alchemy, and astrology
 Thus, the author who worries about the Secret Service taking orders from the Bavarian Illuminati is old school; the one who worries about a "joint reptilian-bavarian Illuminati" takeover is at the cutting edge of the new synthesis
 These bizarre notions constitute what Michael Kelly termed "fusion paranoia," a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever
 Conspiracy theories exist in the realm of myth, where imaginations run wild, fears trump facts, and evidence is ignored
 As a superpower, the United States is often cast as a villain in these dramas

" " He reiterated that "there are conspiracies that must be accepted
 But the recordable facts, which in spite of their fallacy, prove the conspiracy theory to be false, are that some of these conspiracies were ultimately successful

 Umberto Eco's novel Foucault Pendulum is a befitting satire on conspiracyism, in which the character attempts to form a conspiracy theory backed by all, and in which the military theologians and Bavarian theologians, the Rosicrucian groups studying logic, the Hallow Earth Enthusiast, the Catharsis, and the Roman Catholic priests

 The guerrilla war is described in the history of England

 Guerilla warfare in India became more frequent in the late 17th century and early 18th century

 The successful guerrilla warfare tactics of the Marathas destroyed the means of the Mughal army and destroyed their discipline and zeal so much that Aurangzeb had to call his best army back to Ahmednagar in 1706 AD and Aurangzeb died the following year

 ve rail, yatayaat, rasad, pul or isi ke anya sadhano ko bhi kshati pahunchaate hai, jo shatruon kii niyamit sena kaaryon main baadha daal saken
 There are three main items for the partisan wars
 pehali chhapamar ke kaary ke liye upyukt bhubhag, duusari raajnneetik avasthaa or teen vastu he rashtriya paristhitiyaan
 The most suitable for this type of work is the hilly land, which has a forest, or a similar plot full of forests and marshes
 chhapamar yuddh se raksha ke liye chhapamaron dwaara prayukt aniyamit vidhiyon kaa gyaan aavashyak he jisase sahakaari prayatnon dwaara unke prayatnon ko turant nasht kar diya jaay
 Another particularly useful method is to surround the area in which the guerrillas rest

 This area is not particularly attractive for the partisans, but the Arab revolt of 1916-18 was quite irregular

 larens or unke sahaayak arabon ne turk gadhon se bachate hue rail kii line kaat deen, akramanon se turkon ko pareshaan kiya or unhen aage badhane se roak diya
 Now from the other side, the regular English forces stationed in Jordan attacked the main Ottoman army
 idhar larens ne apni sena kii sahaayta se is turki sena kaa anya senaaon se sambandh viched kar diya
 The reasons for Lawrence's success were the mobility of his army, external aid, time and public opinion, which helped the civilians

 Yugoslavia is a proof of what results can be achieved with the cooperation of the modern air force and the guerrillas

 In 1941, Japan declared war

 Their second task was to obstruct Japanese control established in the country

 To overcome this difficulty, the guerrillas used small radio sets of the public

 Soon there was a regular arrangement for sending submarines, and by April 1944 all major islands had established radio contact with General macarthur

 It has been proved that the principles of guerilla warfare are the same today as in the early times of war
 aaj bhi chhapamar teevr gati se chalate hai, dhokhaa dekar shatrudal par vahaan akraman karte hai jahaan vah sabase adhik durbal hota he
 Also, they do not give the enemy an opportunity to retaliate

 The result will be that the area of raiding will become larger and more effective
 niyamit sena bhi choti choti tukadiyon main yuddh karegi
 Under these circumstances, only partisan wars will be successful
 yah kahana anuchit na hoga ki yuddh main aanvik shastron kaa prayog hone par keval chhapamar yuddh hi pramukh mahatv kaa hoga or anya vidhiyon kaa saadhaaran upyog hi rah jaayga

 The geographical spread of Hindi language is very far and wide which can be divided into three areas: - beemaa vigyaan keval bime kaa saadhaaran gyaan nahin he, apitu yah ganit, rasayan aadi anya vigyaanon kii tarah hi ek vishesh prakaar kaa vigyaan he, jisaki unnati vishesh rup se bime ke sambandh main hui he
 Its proper use is only in life insurance, although some use can be done in other places
 is vigyaan kii aadhaar visheshkar prayikta tathaa sankhyikeey vigyaan he
 Those branches of mathematics which are used in this science can be called insurance mathematics
 isi prakaar sankhyikee kii us shakha ko jiskaa upyog is vigyaan main hota he beemaa sankhyikee kah sakate hai
 On the basis of data of past and present tense, the insuranceist tells us that one person dies every second
 is prakaar har samay hi koi na koi mar rahaa hota he
 Even then, we never let this idea pass in our daily work
 yadi ham har samay kaa adhikansh samay yahi sochate rahen ki kahin agle kshan hamen kaal kaa grass na bananaa pade, to jivan dubhar evam niraashamay ho jayega
 Why is this? Because we all have some part of "insurance"
 ek din main shaayad 25 hajaar manushyon main se ek ke marane kii baari aati ho, at: swaabhaavik he har ek apane ko 24,999 main samajhataa he
 According to this one can say that the probability of death of a human being in the next twenty-four hours is one in 25 thousand, or 1 / 25000 = 0
 xxrep 4 0 4 times, and the probability of surviving twenty-four hours is 0
 xxrep 4 9 6 times
 donon milakar nishchit hi puraa ek hona chahie, kyonki jivit rahane yaa na rahane ke sivaa teesraa koi maarg nahin he
 In the above calculation, all human beings are considered deathless, but in reality this is not so
 kis prakaar ke manushyon ko ek jaisaa mana jaae or kis prakaar ke manushyon ko inase bhinn or kitna bhinn mana jaae, ye sab jatil prashn hai or inako hal karnaa bimaavigya kaa kaam he

 For this, he has created insurance schemes
 ve arjak yuvakon ko kehete hai, ""hamaari kisi jivan beemaa yojana main beemaa kara lo
 It will be good for those who die in the untimely, those who live will also be good
 "" jivan beemaa tathaa anya prakaar ke biimon main yah bada antar he ki anya biimon main jis vastu kaa beemaa hota he uske vasht hone par, milanevaale bimaadhan se vahi vastu phir praapt ho sakati he
 It has the value of the insured, but not the value of life
 jivan kaa beemaa guarantee ke rup main nahin ho saktaa
 Life cannot be returned
 bimaadhan se arjak vyakti kii mrityu se uske ashriton ko honevaali aarthik haani ko dur yaa kam kiya ja saktaa he
 This is what each life insurance plan does
 sanai chaahe beemaa karaane ke teen maheene baad hi kyon na mar jaae, uske ashriton ko puraa beemaa dhan milegaa
 Insurers know that insuring a small number of people can make a difference between prediction marks and actual scores, but insuring a large scale makes the prediction more accurate
 isliye kisi bhi bimyogy vyakti ko bina beemaa karaae chhodana nahin chahie
 At the same time, insurance experts also know that unhealthy humans are ready to insure more easily and only such people offer insurance of large amounts with ease
 atev badi dhanrashi tathaa adhik umravaale logon ke beemaa prastaavon ke sambandh main ve vishesh saavdhaanee rakhte hai tathaa uchit doctori pariksha kii salaah bhi dete hai

 Life Insurance Corporation has an amount of about seven billion rupees, from which several crores of rupees are received annually in the form of interest etc
 itani badi dhanrashi se raashtra kii badi seva hoti he
 a large part of this money is deposited with governments on interest, which is used to implement the five-year plans
 saath hi uparyukt dhanrashi se nijee vyavsaayon ko bhi poonji praapt hoti he
 Great work and large organization is also required to work on a large scale
 iske prabandh main bada vyay bhi hota he
 Insurers take care of mortality, interest earned and future income and expenditure on organization required for insurance, etc
 ye sabhi pehle se thik thik nishchit nahin kiye ja sakate, phir bhi bhoot, vartmaan or samaaj kii dasha aadi dekhakar yathasambhav sahi anumaan lag jaataa he
 The insurance installment is determined by considering all these things
 kisi beemaa sanstha kii atul dhanrashi ko hi dekhakar uski aarthik dasha kaa anumaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Most of the fees that the insured receives from them are returned to them or their dependents as insurance money after many years
 ek nai beemaa sanstha yaa teji se vruddhi karanevaali beemaa sanstha ke paas aarthik dasha kharaab hone par bhi apaar dhan raashi hogi, at: moolyankan ke rup main bimaavigya kaa ankush sanstha par na ho to prabandhakon ko badhati hui dhanrashi ko lutaa dene kaa pralobhan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the insurance specialist has to undergo biographical assessment from time to time

 When considering any question, the insurance technician has to look at it from all sides

 It is believed that the status of Varuna is ancient compared to other Vedic deities, that is why in the Vedic age, Varuna is not a sign of any natural contribution
 agni va indra kii apeksha varun ko sambodhit sookhton kii maatra bahut kam he phir bhi uskaa mahatv kam nahin he

 Magnetic field is the magnetic effect of electric currents and magnetic materials
 kisi bhi bindu par chumbakeey kshetra donon, disha or pariman dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he; isaliye yah ek sadish kshetra he
 The magnetic field is produced by the moving electric charge and the magnetic moment underlying the radicals
 'chumbakeey kshetra' shabd kaa prayog do kshetron ke liye kiya jaataa he jinka aapas main nikat sambandh he, kintu donon alag-alag hai
 These two regions are represented by b and H
 h kii ikai ampir prati meter he or b kii ikai testla he
 The magnetic field can be generated in two ways - electric motions and magnetic fields are two sides of the same object that are interrelated, in specific relativity, by moving charges and by the magnetic moment inherent in the fundamental particles

 unhone 1933 se 1935 tak bharat kii kendriya vidhaan sabha ke adhyaksh ke rup main, or 1935 se 1941 tak cochin rajya ke dewan ke rup main bhi kaary kiya
 Shanmukham Chetty was born in Coimbatore in 1892, and studied at Madras Christian College and Madras Law College
 apni shiksha puri hone par, shanmukham chetty justise party main shaamil ho gaye or 1917 main coimbatore nagarpalika ke parshad chune gaye
 In 1920, he contested for the Madras Legislative Assembly on a Justice Party ticket, in which he emerged victorious, although in 1922 he resigned from his post

 He was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the House in 1932, and then in 1933 he also became the Speaker of the House
 1935 ke chunaavon main parajeet hone par chetty waapas dakshin bharat laut aae, jahaan unhone 1935 se 1941 tak unhone cochin rajya ke dewan ke rup main kaary kiya
 After India's independence in 1947, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru chose Chetty as his finance minister

 shoonyavad yaa shoonyata baudhon kii mahayan shakha madhyamik naamak vibhaag kaa mat yaa siddhanth he jisamen sansar ko shunya or uske sab padaarthon ko sattahin mana jaataa he 
 "secondary justice" has adopted "nihilism" as a philosophical principle
 iske anusaar gyey or gyaan donon hi kalpit hai
 The ultimate element is the only "zero"
 "shunya" saar, asat, sadasat or sadasadvilakshan, in chaar kotiyon se alag he
 The world is the inversion of this "void"
 vivart kaa mul he sanvruti, jo avidya or vaasana ke naam se bhi abhihit hoti he
 According to this opinion, upon the retirement of the karmakales, a person attains nirvana and calms in the same way as oil and light when it ends
 nagarjun kii drushti main mul tatv shunya ke atirikt anya kuch nahin he
 The point to note is that this zero is not a prohibitive object to be dealt with
 kisi bhi padaarth kaa swarupanirnay karne main chaar hi kotiyon kaa prayog sambhavya he - Paramarth is free from these four categories and that's why we use the word "zero" for its designation
 nagarjun ke shabdon main Nagarjuna has used subversive reasoning for the attainment of nihilism - that logic, with the help of analyzing matter, it only remains in the void
 is tark ke bal par dravya, gati jati, kaal, sansarg, aatma, aadi tatwon kaa bada hi gambhir, maarmik tathaa moulik vivechan karne kaa shrey nagarjun ko he
 In this view, there are two types of truth - jinamein pratham avidya se utpann vyaavhaarik satta kaa sanket karata he; dwitiya pragna janit satya kaa pratipadak he
 The word "samvruti" means avidya
 avidyajanit hone se vyaavhaarik satya saanvruthik satya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the view of Nagarjuna, this two-pronged interpretation of truth is not the new imagination evoked by nihilism, indicated by ancient Buddha itself
 buddha ke katipay upadesh vyaavhaarik satya ke aadhaar par die gaye hai; anya upadesh parmaarthik satya ke upar alambit hai
 Buddha is both desired - nagarjun darshanik hote hue bhi vyavhaar kii upeksha karanevaale acharya nahin the
 They know that without taking shelter of behavior, there can be no preaching of charitable and in the absence of attainment of charitableness, Nirvana cannot be attained
 saadhaaran maanvon kii buddhi vyavhaar main itani aasakt he ki use parmarthpath par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, the untruth of behavior is not an object rendered by charitable words
 isiilie use "anksharatatv" ke abhidhaan se jaanate hai
 The charitable entity is so obsessed with behavior that it cannot be practiced to bring it to the ultimate path
 falat: vyavhaar kii "asatyata" dikhalaakar hi sadhak ko parmarth main pratishthit karnaa padataa he
 Paramarth is not a thing rendered by words
 isiilie use ankshar tatv ke abhidhaan se jaanate hai
 The ultimate essence is unintelligible, unobtrusive, omnipotent and unimaginative from intelligence, but only by imposing the worldly substances on it can we gain knowledge

 Similarly, when one part of a machine rotates on another part of it, then there is also a need to avoid rub and wear

 These solids are called bearings
 ye bering dhaatu ke bane majboot khaanche vaa naal main baitha die jate hai, jisamen swayan ghoomte rahane par bhi ye apni niyat sthiti se hatane na paaen
 Special metals and alloys are used to make bearings, which, despite rotating at a speed, neither wear out due to friction and heat nor can they break down under pressure
 gharshan ke prabhaav se ghisaai ko kam se kam karne ke liye kadi dhaatuon kaa prayog sadaa upyogi nahin hota, kyonki kadi dhaatuon main ragad padane par taap sheeghra utpann hota he or mashin ke us bhaag par, jo aisi kadi dhaatu kii bering par chal rahaa ho, ghisaai kaa hanikaarak prabhaav padhata he
 To prevent this ill effects and to keep the friction factor to a minimum, soft metals and alloys are used which are more abrasive and also durable

 Vang itself is a very soft metal, but together with copper and antimony, it forms a very hard alloy

 The presence of zinc, iron, or aluminum in the babbit mantle is harmful
 sisa, antimony evam taanbe kii mishradhatu main 15 prati shat tak antimony tathaa 20 prati shat tak vang milaayaa jaataa he
 The remaining lead remains
 is prakaar se bani mishradhatu bahut kadi tathaa agharshani hoti he
 Arsenic, antimony, and lead alloys, in which the amount of arsenic does not exceed 1 to 3 percent, are used to make bearings for high temperature machines

50 per cent cadmium
 isse bane beringon kaa upyog vimaanon aadi main kiya jaataa he
 Bearings made of this metal are used only in certain types of machines, where the speed of the machine is generally low and the temperature is 150 ° C
