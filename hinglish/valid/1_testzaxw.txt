 He has eight grandchildren and five grandchildren
 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalized British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun school in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject
 The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947
 Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican", and had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England, and throughout his Royal Navy days, Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947
 The day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed the style His Royal Highness on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 His first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 i am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children
" On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumors over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; however, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumors of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honor of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", And Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honor to let him do it
 " Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-colour, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and i have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that i would do any such thing
" During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation
 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 Template: Infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001

 a 1927 case in which an illegal liquor producer was caught via telephone tapping reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled that the FBI could use a wiretap in its investigation and while the FBI tapping function Does not enter a person's home to fulfill, it should not be construed as a violation of the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure Ga
 After the prohibition was repealed, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which made it illegal to tap phones without consent but allowed bugging
 In another Supreme Court case in 1939, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, the evidence the FBI obtained through phone tapping was not admissible in court

 The bibliography refers to the English word 'bibliography', which is very broad and differs among scholars in relation to a certain definition
 1961 main paris main unesco ke sahyog se 'iffla' kii jo kanference hui thi, usamen is shabd kii paribhaasha ke prashn par bhi vichaar kiya gaya tha or sarvasanmati se antat: is shabd kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha sweekrut kii gai thi : The above three meanings are included in the above definition accepted by 'ifla': iske antargat granth kaa bahya rup main prayek prakaar kaa adhyayan, jisase granth ke itihaas, nirmaan aadi kaa gyaan ho, aa jaataa he
 In this way, the construction of paper, the history of printing, development of various methods of printing of pictures, various activities performed during the construction of a book, etc
 all come under the term 'bibliography'
 granthsuchee vastut: soochiptr kaa hi ek rup he, par donon shabd paryaayavachi nahin hai
 The catalog contains knowledge of the literature available in any one library or museum
 soochiptr kisi prakaashak dwaara prakashit granthon kii suchi maatr bhi ho saktaa he tathaa kisi pustak vikreta dwaara beche janevaale granthon kii suchi bhi
 It is considered sufficient to give a minimum description of the texts which are included in the catalog
 isse kisi granth ke astitv maatr kaa gyaan hi ho paata he
 The method of preparing the catalog is also simple
 vah yaa to granthon ko dekhakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he yaa kisi duusare soochiptr kii sahaayta se
 Sometimes assistance of other libraries and scholars is also taken to prepare the catalog
 soochiptr main granthon kaa jo vivaran diya jaataa he, usase kaai vyakti yah pataa nahin laga saktaa ki kisi granth kaa mudran kin paristhitiyon main hua tathaa us granth ke baad ke sanskarnon main yadi koi parivartan, sanshodhan kiya gaya, to kyon? Although the area of the bibliography is also limited to a few pieces, its range may be minimal if on one side and very wide on the other
 granthsuchee ke antargat kisi ek lekhak, prakaashak, mudrak, vishay, kaal yaa desh se sambandhit granthon kii suchi ko liya ja saktaa he
 If available in a library of texts related to any author, publisher, printer, subject, period or country; Or other type of bibliographic material, such as all types of published unpublished literature, pamphlets, journals, newspapers and 'reprints' of maps printed in them, maps, drawings, microfilm material, handwritten texts, etc
 prepared with a particular purpose and order
 If it goes, it will be called a bibliography
 ise or adhik spasht karne ke liye ek udhaaharan lenaa apraasangik nahin hoga
 The list of all the texts available in the Aryabhasha Library of Nagri Pracharini Sabha, Kashi, will be called 'catalog of Aryabhasa Library'
 yadi vahaan uplabdh premchand se sambandhit tathaa unke dwaara likhit sabhi granthon kii suchi taiyaar kii jaae to use 'premchand kii granthsuchee' mana jaayga, yadhyapi use 'aryabhasha pustkaalay main premchand krit tathaa premchand sambandhi sahitya kaa soochiptr' bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The bibliography is restricted by some form of limitation
 yah seemaa bahut vyapak or bahut choti bhi ho sakati he
 If in the above example, a list of only the literature written and related by Premchand is published in a certain period, ie between 1920 and 1930, then this bibliography is limited to the subject 'premchand', a certain Also limited by time
 is granthsuchee ko, yadi koi chaahe to, 'premchand kaa kahani sahitya : 1920- 1930' tak bhi simit kiya ja saktaa he
 On the contrary, if one wishes, one can also include Premchand Krit and the entire literature related to them, translated and published in all the languages of the world
 aisi sthiti main granthsuchee kii seemaa bahut adhik bad jaaegi
 The point is to say that the bibliography is always limited to some direction, but on the contrary, the catalog should not be limited to any one subject, period or place
 soochiptr kii tulana main granthsuchee apane uddeshy main bhi simit hoti he
 According to the subject and purpose, the order of the texts in the bibliography is there and one of the main features of the bibliography is that it is all-inclusive within its prescribed range, although nowadays only a bibliography of selected literature is also compiled for some new and difficult subjects
 Has started going granthsuchee or soochiptr main doosraa mukhya antar yah hota he ki soochiptr kaa upyog mukhyat: pustkaalay ke sadsy yaa anusandhankarta aavashyak granth praapt karne yaa unke sambandh main aavashyak sankshipt vivaran praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 In contrast, the bibliography is used only for a fixed and limited purpose
 soochiptr se saamanyat: kisi granth ke sambandh main lekhak kaa naam tathaa uski prakationatithi hi gyaat ho sakati he, par granthsuchee main die gaye vivaran se sabhi prakaar kaa aavashyak sambhavit vivaran, jaise granth kaa lekhak, naam, mulya, prishthsankhya, prakaashak, prakashansthaan or tithi, aakaar prakaar, sanskaran, prakaashan sambandhi koi mahatvapurn tathy tathaa isi prakaar kaa anya vivaran bhi praapt hota he
 The bibliography can be of many types, but its main forms are as follows: arthath kisi desh main prakashit samast sahitya kii suchi
 It cannot be denied that the entire literature published in a country should be accessible to the people of that country without any objection
 koi vyakti yaa sanstha sabhi prakashit sahitya nahin kharid sakati
 Therefore, this literature should be kept in a place where everyone can use it equally
 yah kaary desh vishesh kii sarkaar dwaara hi sambhav he
 For this purpose, national libraries have been established in almost all the countries of the world
 par keval itane se hi samasya hal nahin ho jaati
 The library cannot be fully utilized without any means of knowing what literature has been stored in the library, and whether there is a text or not
 duusari baat yah bhi he ki kisi bhi desh kii samskruti itani sampann nahin hoti ki vah duusare deshon se bina kuch liye die hi falti phoolati rahe
 Nowadays, when it is considered necessary for the whole world to be tied in one thread from the point of view of science and humanity, it has become necessary for the researchers also to be aware of the progress and progress made in other countries
 at: prayek desh kii sarkaar kaa yah kartavya ho jaataa he ki vah koi aisa saadhan prastut kare jisase desh ke logon ko hi nahin varan videshiyon kii bhi desh main prakashit sahitya kii soochna mili
 The national bibliography serves this purpose
 rashtriya granthsuchee main kisi desh main prakashit sabhi prakaar ke evam sabhi vishyon ke samast granthon kaa vivaran diya rahata he
 This list is usually prepared on the basis of literature stored in the national library of the country
 abhi tak kisi bhi desh main aisi rashtriya granthsuchee taiyaar nahin ho saki he jisamen us desh main prakashit sampurna sahitya kaa vivaran ho
 The national bibliography is in fact the result of this century
 britain jaise desh main bhi 1950 se purv koi rashtriya granthsuchee nahin thi
 The British National Bibliography started publication there from 1950
 yah suchi yahan ke rashtriya pustkaalay- british museum ke pustkaalay- main kapirite kanoon ke antargat praapt hue granthon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kii jaati he
 In India, the year 1958 should be considered very important from the point of view of bibliography when the publication of the National Library Bibliography started there
 is suchi main bharat ke rashtriya pustkaalay main kapirite kanoon ke antargat praapt sabhi bhashaaon ke sabhi granthon kaa vivaran diya rahata he, par hindi tathaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon kaa durbhaagya hi he ki yah suchi keval roman lipi main prakashit hoti he
 In this way, the problem of literature of all Indian languages published in India after 1958 and thereafter has been solved a lot, but no bibliography of literature published in India before 1958 is available till date nor the Kai plan is under consideration
 
 lekin bharat ko is baat kaa garv hona chahie ki yahan rashtriya granthsuchee kaa prakaashan aarambh ho chukaa he jabaki kai deshon main abhi tak koi rashtriya granthsuchee prakashit nahin hui he
 The list of national libraries here can be used only by those who can visit the library themselves
 iske atirikt doosraa ekmaatr upaay patravyavhaar dwaara kisi granthvishesh ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt karnaa he
 But now, with the influence and cooperation of UNESCO, plans for publication of national bibliography are under consideration in some countries and it is expected that for the next two decades, national bibliography will be published in almost all countries
 rashtriya granthsuchee ke prasang main vishwa granthsuchee par dhyaan janaa swaabhaavik he
 Many efforts have been made in the world for world bibliography from time to time since the 18th century, but none of the efforts were successful
 vishwa granthsuchee ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi britain kii royal sosayadi ne sarvapratham vaigyanik sahitya kaa soochiptr prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya, par sheeghra hi yah prayaas sthagit kar dena padaa
 After this, an international catalog of scientific literature was planned as a supplement to the above list
 yah yojana bhi kuch samay tak hi chal saki
 The failure of both the above schemes revealed a number of problems related to the world bibliography, which did not normally get the attention of scholars
 in donon yojanaon ke baad bhi royal sosayadi is kshetra main kuch na kuch karti rahi he
 No matter how much money a library spends, it cannot buy the entire published literature of all countries
 british museum ke pustakalayadhyaksh anthoni panijee is pustkaalay main vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit sarvshereshth granth rakhana chaahate the
 For this purpose, they tried to get the best literature of all the languages of the world, but for many reasons they could not succeed in their efforts
 america kaa congress pustkaalay bhi, jo vishwa kaa sabase bada pustkaalay mana jaataa he, vishvapustkaalay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But the catalogs of the world's major libraries fill the gap of 'world bibliography' in very few portions, since these libraries have been trying to collect useful and important texts published in all the countries of the world
 aadhunik yug main vishwa granthsuchee ke mahatv kaa anumaan keval isi tathy se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unesco kaa praaia: prayek vibhaag or shakha granthsuchee ke vikaas main kisi na kisi rup main sambhddha he tathaa vividh vishyon kii granthsuchee taiyaar karan evam unase sambhddha samasyaon ke hal ke liye unescon ne alag alag samitiyaan sthapit kii he
 In order to improve the current state of bibliography in the world, members of the international conference which took place in Paris under the auspices of UNESCO in 1950, unanimously came to the conclusion that a 'bibliographic center' should be established in every country at the national level
 Where various necessary work related to bibliography can be done
 baad main inhen kendron kii sahaayta se vahaan kii rashtriya granthsuchee bhi prakashit kii ja sakati he
 These bibliographic centers established at the national level will be useful as foundations for world bibliography
 soochiptr bhi kuch seemaa tak granthsuchee kaa rup le sakate hai
 If a catalog of texts of only a certain subject is available in a library, it can be used as a bibliography to some degree
 adhikansh prasiddh evam bade pustakaalayon ke vishay soochiptr kalantar main vishay granthsuchee kaa mahatv praapt kar lete hai
 The feature of the texts included in the catalogs is not usually that they are works of a particular author, or because all the texts are related to a single subject, although in case of some catalogs both or any of the above is also correct
 Can
 varan un granthon main visheshta yah hoti he ki ve kisi ek prakaashak dwaara prakashit hote hai, kisi pustak vikreta ke yahan krayarth praapt hote hai yaa ve kisi pustkaalay ke sangrah main hote hai
 But the importance of large library catalogs is similar to the bibliography
 isi kaaran britain ke british museum pustkaalay, america ke congress pustkaalay or france ke 'bibliothek neshnal' ke soochipatron kii gananaa granthsuchee kii koti main hoti he
 The main purpose of their compilation and the main similarity of the texts involved is that they are related to any one subject
 yah granthsuchee, anya prakaar kii granthsuchiyon ke samaan samasamyik granthon kii bhi ho sakati he tathaa purvakaleen granthon kii bhi
 It can also be vivid or only selected literature, likewise there may or may not be commentary with details of the texts involved
 iskaa prakaashan patrapatrika ke rup main nirdhaarit samay main bhi ho saktaa he, choti pustika ke rup main bhi or swatantra granth ke rup main bhi
 Author titles 'supporting bibliography', 'other literature', 'readable literature' or useful literature, etc
, sometimes as independent chapters or appendices at the end of some passages of university textbooks and scientific texts, and at the end of some important research texts
 List some texts by giving
 kuch patrapatrikaon main prakashit mahatvapurn lekhon ke ant main bhi kabhi kabhi sahaayak granthsuchee di rahati he
 Similarly, a brief bibliography is given at the end of encyclopedias and research articles
 inhen bhi granthsuchee kaa hi ek rup maananaa chahie
 With the continuous growth of published texts in all the countries of the world, the need for author and subject bibliography also increases
 paashchaatya deshon main praaia: sabhi prasiddh lekhakon kii granthsuchee prakashit ho chuki he
 Some bibliographies of some authors have been published for different purposes
 lekin keval granthsuchee ke prakashit ho jane se hi samasya hal nahin ho jaati
 Unless there is no means to find out which books of which author, and for which subjects and what type of bibliographies are available, the available bibliographies cannot be fully utilized
 isi uddeshy se ab 'granthsuchiyon kii granthsuchee' ke sankalan kii ore paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakarshith hua he or europea bhashaaon main ab tak kai choti badi 'granthsuchiyon kii granthsuchee' prakashit ho chuki he
 In this connection, 'A World Bibliography of Bibliography' compiled by Theodore Westerman is notable
 is vishaal granth main vishwa kii bhashaaon main prakashit 84, 403 granthsuchiyon kaa satippan vivaran diya gaya he
 This new form of bibliography came to light early in the same century
 is prakaar ek vishay ke prakashit aprakashit mahatvapurn sahitya kaa vishad parichay diya rahata he
 a bibliography of this type has also been published in Hindi
 granthsuchee ke uparyukt prakaaron ke atirikt kuch anya prakaar bhi hai jinamein anukramanikas tathaa abstracts mukhya hai
 The most important and important thing in compiling any bibliography is that its purpose should be clear
 granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa kram uske uddeshy par hi nirbhar rahanaa he
 The texts to be included in any bibliography can be placed in any of the following order: acaradi kram
 According to the name of the author, according to the name of the book, the name of the subject or the place of publication
 kalkram, Classified, bhugolic kram According to the type of texts
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy prayek granth kaa vivaran dena maatr he to sabhi granth lekhakon ke naam se acaradi kram se rakhana upyukt hoga
 If the purpose of the bibliography is to tell the development of the history of a subject or to introduce the literature development of a famous writer, then all the texts should be kept from the chronological arrangement
 yadi pathakon ko upyogi evam mahatvapurn granthon ke sambandh main dishpradarshan karnaa ho to granthsuchee ke ant main acaradi kram main vishay anukramani dekar aisa kiya ja saktaa he or yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy keval yah batalaana he ki vishay par ab tak koun koun se granth likhe ja chuke hai tathaa kis ang kii abhi tak kami he to kisi vargeekaran paddati ke aadhaar par sampurna sahitya ko vargeekrut kram main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if the importance of the texts to be included in the bibliography is due to a place or geographical area, then all literature can be placed in geographical order
 granthsuchee ke saamaan yah arth bhi simit kshetra main prayukt hota he
 This meaning is mainly used only for texts published before the machine era and at the beginning of the machine age
 aadhunik kaal main vaigyanik yantron kaa itnaa adhik vikaas ho chukaa he, tathaa mudrankala ke kshetra main bhi itani adhik pragati ho chuki he ki kisi ek granth kii lakhon karodon pratiyaan bina kisi shaareerik shram ke mudrit kii ja sakati hai, saath hi is baat kii jaraa bhi sambhaavna nahin rahati ki in pratiyon main aapas main kisi prakaar kaa antar hoga
 Therefore, in modern times there is no question of 'description' of printed texts
 granthavarnan se taatpary granth ke vishayvarnan se nahin varan granth ke bahya rup, uske nirmaan evam astitv main aane kii vividh kriyaaon se he
 Before the machine era when texts were written by hand, it could not be expected that any two copies of the same book would be identical in every way
 or to or, unka kaagaj bhi ek sa nahin ho saktaa tha, phir likhaawat, chitrakaari, paragraph, 'pruf' kii ashuddhiyaan, hashia, aadi main to or bhi zyada asamanta rahati thi
 Even after almost 100 years or more after the invention of printing, the development of printing was not well
 is samay bhi mudrasambandhi adhikansh kaary maanav shakti dwaara hote the
 Therefore, it was natural that there should be some difference between two copies of the same book
 us kaal ke chape granthon ko dekhne par pataa chalata he ki ek hi samay or ek hi saath chhapi ek hi granth kii do pratiyon main compojing, mechap, pruf, formon kii sajaavat aadi main ascharyajanak asamanta he
 In the modern period, while in the early years of the invention of handwritten texts and printing of ancient times, the collection of printed texts has attracted the attention of artisans and literary institutions and collectors of handwritten texts at high prices for manuscripts of famous authors and their books Started collecting early versions, it became necessary for their convenience Land that Jayँ produce a Grnthsuchiya including original description
 is varnan ko dekhakar asli or nakli prati kaa bhed aasaani se kiya ja sake tathaa kalapremi sangraahak dhokhebaajon evam jaalsaajon dwaara thage na ja saken
 Needless to say that many fraudsters in Western countries have earned millions and crores by copying the manuscripts of famous authors and preparing 'fake first editions' of their texts
 baad main vastusthiti kii jaankaree hone par sangraahakon ko haath malkar rah janaa padaa he
 In order to protect art lovers and collectors from fraud, the description given in the bibliography is complete in itself and sufficient to identify any book
 paashchaatya granthon ke varnan ke liye vahaan ke vidwaanon ne granthavarnan kii kuch vishesh vidhiyaan maanya kii hai
 Granthwaran is actually a type of sign language that only the experienced can understand
 hastlikhit granthon tathaa mudrit granthon ke liye alag alag vidhiyaan tathaa niyam hai
 Similarly bibliography is also given more or less according to the purpose of the bibliography
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy maatr ek 'suchi' hi taiyaar karnaa he to suchi main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa aavashyak sankshipt vivaran diya jaataa he, par yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy granthon kaa vishad parichay dena hota he to granth ke pratham prishth se lekar antim prishth tak kaa puraa vivaran, chitron kaa puraa vivaran, prayek prishth kii mukhya mukhya visheshtaayen yadi hon, hashia kaa kram, paragraphon kaa kram, compojing kaa kram prayek prishth main kitni panktiyaan hai, yadi kisi prishth main kam yaa adhik panktiyaan hai to isaki soochna, koi pankti yadi kisi vishesh sthaan se prarambh hoti ho to uskaa vivaran, aadi sookshmatisookshm prayek baat kaa varnan, 'granth varnan' ke antargat aata he
 If two copies of an ancient book are available, then their physical designs are compared among themselves and if there is any difference between them, this fact is mentioned in 'granthwaran' and the attention of the collectors is drawn to this
 kisi ek granth kii do pratiyon main koi antar hone kaa arth yah kadaapi nahin ki donon main se ek prati jaali he
 Even if there is a difference between the two copies, both copies can be real, because there can be many possible reasons for the difference between them
 granthavarnan ke prasang main in kaarnon par vistrut rup se vichaar kar kisi ek nishkarsh par pahunchnaa hota he
 The detailed bibliography of this type is given in the list of books, which facilitates art lovers, collectors and librarians, but their use does not end here
 saahitiyik drushti se bhi granthavarnan kaa kuch mahatv rahata he
 Texts and other similar material by which ideas are expressed are often not true models of the author's ideas
 kabhi kabhi aisa hota he ki lekhak apane vichaaron ko thik-thik vyakt karne ke liye upyukt shabd nahin khoj paata tathaa kabhi kabhi vah aise shabdon kaa bhi prayog karata he jiskaa arth pathak yaa shrota kii drushti main kuch or hi hota he
 It is also necessary to pay attention to one other fact in this regard
 yadi lekhak swayan apane granth ko mudrit karata yaa uski hastlikhit pratiyaan taiyaar karata he tab to kisi prakaar ke bhram yaa galat shabd ke prayog kii sambhaavna praaia: nahin rahati lekin vastusthiti kuch or hi he
 When a book which comes out of the pen and brain of the writer comes out in printed form, then many other people are responsible for that form, not the writer
 in logon kaa saahitiyik gyaan praaia: shunya rahata he tathaa jis vishay ke granth ko ve taiyaar kar rahe hote hai us vishay se bhi ve praaia: anbhigya rahete hai
 In such a situation, complete justice cannot be done to the writer
 iske atirikt kabhi kabhi aisa bhi dekha jaataa he ki lekhak apni mul prati main jo kuch likhata he, use mudrit rup main dekhne par uskaa arth badalata hua najar aata he
 Even if the author himself takes a lot of caution in proof-reading and reduces that possibility a lot and thus has little control over the medium of expressing his ideas, there is no evidence that this control is completely 'impeccable'
 vastusthiti yah he ki lekhak swayan hi sab kuch nahin karata
 Even after self-proof reading, he has to depend on others for later actions
 at: 'truti maanav se hoti he', is siddhant ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki lekhak ke kaaphi saavdhaanee rakhane par bhi anya vyaktiyon dwaara koi galti ho jane kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Many famous authors have acknowledged that their texts are not in physical form exactly as they had imagined
 at: kalpana or yatharth ke antar ko dur karne ke liye granthavarnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As a matter of fact, Granthavarnan is like a bridge for literary review
 kisi granth kii vishay vastu kaa moolyankan karne ke purv sameekshak ko is baat se aashwast hona aavashyak he ki samiksha ke liye vah granth kii jis prati kaa upyog kar rahaa he, vah lekhak ke mul paath ke adhaar par hi taiyaar hui he
 If it is not so, then it becomes necessary to establish a relationship between them by looking at copies of all the volumes of the book
 kyonki kis granth kaa itihaas vastut: uske lekhak ke sahitiyik itihaas kaa hi ek mahatvapurn ang he
 It is also necessary for the reviewer to know the history of the text of the treatise, so that it can identify the version that is most closely to the author's original manuscript or to which the author himself has made an amendment
 sameekshak ko yah bhi gyaat hona chahie ki us granth main baad main kya kya nai saamagree jodi gai yaa usamen se koun sa ansh nikaal diya gaya, yah parivartan, parivardhan swayan lekhak dwaara yaa uski anumati se kiya gaya yaa mudrak, prakaashak athwa kisi anya vyakti dwaara
 The dates and the order of all the editions of a book should also be known to the reviewer
 yah spasht he ki itnaa sab vivaran praapt karnaa yaa taiyaar karnaa sameekshak kaa kaary nahin
 His task is only to study the content of the book and examine its quality
 at: sameekshak kii sahaayta ke liye granthsuchee main granthavarnan dena aavashyak ho jaataa he
 3- Study of the text as a physical substance, as stated in the beginning, under this meaning, the study and history of all the methods and things that help in the construction of a book
 yahan granth ke paath se kuch bhi taatpary nahin, kushal bibliographer keval yah dekhtaa he ki yah granth kaise bana tathaa granthanirmaan kii jo nirdhaarit maanya vidhiyaan hai un sabhi kaa prayog kis granth ke nirmaan main hua yaa nahin
 This study comprehensively covers the method of paper making, the difference in different types of paper, and their properties, various printing methods and their characteristics, the various functions covered under the printing method, the method of manufacturing the type, the working of the printing machines, the binding
 Everything is considered
 ukt teen arthon ko dekhne se yah spost pataa chalata he ki pratham do arth aapas main poorak hai kyonki grathvarnan granthsuchee main hi diya jaataa he tathaa varnan ke abhaav main granthsuchee or soochiptr main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 Scholars have raised counter-arguments from time to time regarding the third meaning and have questioned that the compiler of the bibliography does not have to have knowledge of printing
 par aadhunik vidwaanon ne jab yah maan liya he ki mudrankala kaa gyaan hue bina koi bhi vyakti granthsuchee kaa sakanlan nahin kar saktaa
 In fact, the bibliography is a concordance of the above three meanings
 granthsuchee vahi hoti he jisamen kisi ek nishchit pranali ke anusaar granthvivaran diya gaya ho
 According to the famous scholar Dr
 Greg, the bibliography refers to the study of the text in physical form, no relation to its content here
 isi prakaar prasiddh america vidvan dow boars ke mat se granthon kii suchi maatr taiyaar karnaa to soochikaran hi kaha jayega, par yadi us suchi main granthon kaa varnan bhautik padaarth ke rup main diya jaae to use sahi arth main 'vaigyanik evam vidhiwat granthsuchee' kaha janaa chahie
 Dr
 Boers went a step further in favor of making such a bibliography an analytical bibliography
 unka mat he ki granthsuchee main kisi granth kaa jo vivaran diya jaataa he, usak uddeshy us granth kii 'adarsh prati' kaa pataa lagaana he
 By ideal copy, he does not mean a copy that has no defects, but is a copy that originates at the beginning of the printer, no matter how many textual errors it contains
 aisi 'adarsh prati' kaa yathatathy granthavarnan karne ke liye mudran kala kaa vishad gyaan hona aavashyak he
 All the actions that have been used in the making of a book are mentioned in the Granthavarnan
 mudran kriyaaon kaa gyaan kisi granth ke keval mul paath kii drushti se hi nahin varan us granth kaa itihaas jaanane ke liye bhi sahaayak hota he
 Having knowledge of printing, the entire history of that book can be told by looking at different versions of the same book
 kisi granth kaa bhautik rup se sookshmatisookshm adhyayan uske mul paath sambandhi vivaadaaspad prashnon ko sulajhane main sahaayak hota he
 Along with this, sometimes he also draws attention to such things which have not been noticed by the scholars before
 yah sahitiyik drushti se to mahatvapurn he hi, anusandhan kii drushti se bhi isaki upyogita se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In the words of Dr
 Gragg, if the word literature is not taken in its limited sense, but in a detailed sense, then the text description should be called the grammar of literature

 The skill of facial approximation is closely related and related to forensic anthropology in that an artist specializes in reconstructing the remains of a human body
 pahchaan prayojanon ke liye maanviya chehre par kendrit kiya jaataa he
 Forensic artists can create a face approximation in a number of ways involving 2D, 3D, and methods using new computerized technology
 forensik kala me yah bhi aate he jaise kii Divodas was an ancient king in India who finds mention in the Rigveda

 In the Rig Veda 1: 112: 14 and 1: 116: 18, he is described as a benevolent king and protected by Indra and Ashwin
 'divodas' ke naam ke arth 'divyalok kaa das' he
 Divodas was the king of a clan called 'tritsu' of the 'bharat' community of Hindus

 There are many specific techniques available in the use of excavation, and each of these excavations has its own properties, and it reveals the style of archaeologist
 sansadhano or anya vyaavhaarik muddon ke kaaran puratatvvid apni icchaanusaar jab chahen va jahaan chahen utkhanan nahin kar pate
 in baadhaon kaa arth yah he ki kai gyaat sthalon ke utkhanan ko jaan-boojhkar chhod diya gaya he
 Its purpose is to keep them safe for generations to come, as well as their role for the communities living around them
 kuch maamalon main yah aashaa bhi vyakt kii jaati he ki praudyogiki sudhaar ke dwaara baad main inhen punahpareekshan kiye jane main sahaayta milegi tathaa usase praapt parinaam adhik laabhakaari honge
 Excavation is the recording of excavations and artifacts found at an archaeological site
 puratathvik avasheshon kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ko remote sencing, udhaaharan ke liye jameen ke bheetar dekh sakane vaali radar, ke dwaara ucch sambhaavna ke saath bataaya ja saktaa he
 In fact, the information about the development of archaeological sites can be obtained through these methods, but to know the subtle features, excavation with proper use of drills is required only
 utkhanan kii takneekon kaa vikaas khajaane khojane ke samay se hi hota aa rahaa he, jabaki anveshak kisi sthal par maanviya gatividhiyon ke dwaara padane vaale sampoorn prabhaav ko jaanane kaa prayaas karte the, saath hi is sthal kaa duusare sthalon ke saath-saath jis bhudrishy main yah sthit he, uske saath sambandh ko jaanane kaa bhi prayaas hota tha
 Its history begins with an immature discovery of treasures and artifacts that came under the category of "rare artwork"
 puratathvik mahatva kii vastuon ko ekatrit karne vaale in durlabh kalakritiyon main bahut ruchi lete the
 It was later appreciated that there was evidence of the lives of earlier people at a site which was destroyed by excavation
 kisi durlabh kalakriti ko apane sthaan se hataa dene par isamen nihit adhikansh suchanaaen nasht ho jaati hai
 As a result of this realization, archeology took the place of collecting objects of archaeological importance, this process is still being made perfect
 jab ise sthaan par hi chhod diya gaya ho, puratathvik saamagree, koi vishesh arth nahin pradarshit karti he
 It is stored along with events
 kisi mali ne ek kone main mitti kaa ek dher bana kar ek bajri-path banaaya ho saktaa he, yaa kisi chhed main ek paudha lagaaya ho saktaa he
 a Rajgir built a wall and filled the gap
 kai varshon baad, kisi ne isapar ek shookarshala banaayi tathaa isamen netal paudhon kaa jhuramut laga diya
 Later, the original wall collapsed
 inamen se prayek ghatana, jise purna hone main lambaa athwa chota samay lag saktaa he, ek paristhiti kaa nirmaan karti he
 These events, which aggregate as layers, are called archaeological sequences or records
 is anukram athwa ricard ke adhyayan se utkhanan ke dwaara vivechna kii jaati he, jiske baad in par paricharchaa tathaa gyaan viksit kiya jaataa he
 Leading procedural archaeologist Lewis Binford has noted that the archaeological evidence found at a site does not fully indicate the historical events at that site
 In an ethnoarchaeological comparison, they describe how the Nunamute Eskimo hunters of north-central Alaska spent time waiting for their prey, and the kinds of tasks they used to do during that time, including diverse Carving on objects, such as wood molds, masks, horn spoons, ivory needles as well as leather bags and strings of mojo Repair etc
 included
 binford kehete hai ki in sabhi gatividhiyon ke puratathvik sakshya utpann hue honge, parantu inamen se kisi se bhi in shikariyon ke is kshetra main ekatrit hone ke mukhya kaaran kaa pataa nahin chalata; jo ki vastav main shikaar karnaa tha
 They state that waiting for animals to hunt "was spent 24% of the total time of their activity; however there is no tentative conclusion of this behavior
 sthal par maujuud koi bhi upkaran tathaa "upotpaada" "mukhya" gatividhi kii ore sanket nahin karte hai
 All the activities performed at the site were essentially to eliminate boredom
 " There are two basic types of modern archaeological excavation: peshewar puratatvigyaan main do prakaar ke pareekshan utkhanan hote hai tathaa donon hi vikasaatmak utkhanan se sambandhit hote hai: inkaa naam test pit athwa trench tathaa watching brif he
 The purpose of test excavation is to ensure the extent and characteristics of archaeological potential before extensive excavation in an area
 adhikanshtah inhen vikasaatmak utkhanan main project management yojana ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 The main difference between trial trenches and watching briefs is that the trial trenches attempt to show archaeological potential by actively digging, while watching briefs are summarily the study of trenches where trenches are not seen for archaeological use, e
g
 As the trench was cut on the road to the gas pipe
 An evaluation method used in the United States called the Schauvel test pit, in which half a square meter trial trench is dug by hand
 aksar puratatvigyaan ateet ke logon ke astitv or vyavhaar ko jaanane kaa ekmaatr saadhan hota he
 Many thousands of civilizations and societies and billions of people have come and gone in thousands of years, whose written record is little or not available, or the available record is wrong or incomplete
 jis prakaar aajkal iskaa lekhan kiya jaataa he, vah 4 sahasrabdi i
pus
 tak astitv main nahin tha, maanav sabhyataa main takneekee rup se unnat sabhyataaon kii ek apekshaakrit choti sankhya ne iske baad hi yah lekhan prarambh kiya
 In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo have existed for millions of years
 These civilizations are not best known by chance; They have been available for the information of historians for centuries, while the study of prehistoric civilizations has only recently begun
 kai sakshar sabhyataaon main bhi kai ghatnaon or mahatvapurn maanav vyavhaar ko aadhikarik taur par darj nahin kiya gaya he
 From the early years of human civilization, any knowledge - agricultural development, cults of folk religion, development of early cities - should be obtained from archeology
 dhaulavira ke uttari phatak ke paas se das sindhu shabd-chinh praapt hue hai, jahaan par likhit record maujuud hai bhi, ve aksar adhure tathaa avashya hi kuch seemaa tak pakshpatpurna hai
 In many societies, literacy was limited to the elite, for example to the priestly class or those employed in a court or temple
 Literacy of the elite was also often limited to contracts and documents
 abhijatya varg ke apane hit tathaa duniya ko dekhne kaa nazariyaa aksar aam aadamiyon se kaaphi bhinn hota tha
 The possibilities of writing by ordinary people's representatives to be kept in libraries and safe for generations to come were very slim
 is prakaar, likhit record simit vyaktiyon ke pakshpaat, kalpana, saanskrithik mulya tathaa sambhavit kapat kaa pradarshan karte hai, jo ki badi jansankhyaon kaa ek chota ansh maatr hi the
 Therefore, written records cannot be relied upon as the sole source
 saamagree ke rup main praapt record samaaj ke uchit pratinidhitiv karne ke nikat he, haalanki yah apni ashuddhiyon par nirbhar he jaise ki namoona lene main kiya gaya pakshpaat tathaa vibhedatmak parirakshan
 In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains are sometimes influenced by the political or cultural significance of the descendants of those who created them, the monetary value the collectors receive, or the strong aesthetic
 bahut se log puraatatv ko is tarah ke saundarya, dharmik, raajnneetik, athwa aarthik kosh kii prapti se jod kar dekhte hai na ki purvakaal ke samaajon ke punarnirmaan ke rup main
 This approach often derives from popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy and King Solomons Mines
 When such unrealistic subjects are viewed seriously, their supporters are always accused of pseudoscience
 However, these efforts, whether real or imaginary, do not represent modern archeology
 puraatatv, vishesh rup se utkhanan main starikaran sarvocch or aadharbhoot avadharana he
 It is based on the law of superposition
 jab puratathvik avshesh jameen kii sataha se neeche hote hai, prayek ke sandarbh kii pahchaan karnaa, puratatvavid ke liye us puratathvik sthal ke vishay main nirnay lene ke liye aavashyak hota he, saath hi isse us sthal kii prakruti tathaa taarikh ke vishay main bhi jamkari milti he
 It is the role of an archaeologist to try to find out what references exist and how they were made
 puratathvik starikaran yaa anukram startigraphy athwa sandarbh kii ikai kaa sakriy superpozishan he
 In archeology, the discovery of an archaeological site is important
 adhik spasht rup se koi puratathvik sandarbh samay-kaal main ek ghatana he jo puratathvik ricard main sangrakshit ho gayi ho
 In the past, cutting a pit or moat is a reference, while filling the material is another reference
 anubhag main kai bharan kaa dikhnaa kai sandarbh kahe jaayenge
 sanrachanaatmak visheshtaayen, prakritik nikshep tathaa shavon ko gaadna bhi sandarbh honge
 Classifying a site into these basic, discrete units can create a chronology of archaeological activities and describe and explain them
 starikaran sambandh aise sambandh hote hai jinhen samay aadhaarit puratathvik sthalon ke bich sthapit kiya jaataa he, aisa unke banane ke kalanukramik anukram main kiya jaataa he
 An example might be to fill a gap and fill that gap back
 khai ko "bhare jane" tathaa "kaate jane" ke sandarbh main "bharaa janaa" kram main baad main aayega, udhaaharan ke liye khai ko bhare jane se purv usko kaata janaa aavashyak he
 One relation is that the latter in the sequence is referred to as "high" and the first in the sequence refers to "low", although the word high or low does not mean the reference is physically elevated or Be low yah ucch va nimna kii soch haris matrix ke rup main adhik upyogi ho sakati he, jo ki kisi sthal ke sthaan va samay main nirmaan kaa do-aiami nirupan he
 In order to understand an archaeological site in modern archeology, the process of dividing references into groups and enlarging that group based on their relationship is adopted
 in bade samoohon ke naam kii shabdaawalee alag-alag vyavsaayiyon ke aadhaar par badalati he parantu kuch shabd jaise ki antaraprishth, up-samooh, samooh tathaa bhoomi prayog aadi saamaanya rup se prayog kiye jate hai
 An example of a subset can be understood from the three references used in burial; The shape of the tomb, the dead body and the soil replenished above that body
 Sub-groups thus form groups based on stratified relationships with other sub-groups that form "stages" in a similar way
 ek up-samooh dafan-kriya anya up-samooh dafan-kriya ke saath bada samooh bana kar ek kabristaan kaa rup le sakati he, athwa dafan-kriya samooh bhi bana sakati he jise baad main kisi bhawan, jaise ki girijaghar ke rup main "charan" kii tarah samajha ja saktaa he
 a less strictly grouped of one or more references is sometimes called a feature
 charan aam aadmi ko sabase aasaani se samaj main aanevaala samoohikaran he, kyonki iskaa abhipraay lagbhag samakaleen puratathvik kshitij se he jo darshata he "yadi aap kisi vishisht samay main waapas ja pate, to aapako kya dikhaai padataa"
 ek charan kaa aashay, aksar, lekin hameshaa nahin, ek vyavsaayik str kii pahchaan se sambandhit hota he, ek "pracheen dharaatal", jo kuch samay pehle maujuud tha
 The construction of phase interpretation is the first goal of stratified interpretation and excavation
 "charan main" khudaai charanbaddhata se bhinn he
 The phasing of an archaeological site refers to the excavation or post-excavation of the site into contemporary horizons, while the "phase excavation" is to remove stratigraphic remains stratified so that they do not remove references that are temporally prior to it
 Of or "down in sequence" before other references that come after it in relation to stratification such as superimpo The law of zishan states
 vyavhaar main vyakhya kii prakriya puratathvik sthal par utkhanan kii ranneeti ke saath hi jari rahegi taaki jahaan tak sambhav ho "charanbaddhata" ko utkhanan ke dauraan hi kiya ja sake, tathaa ise ek acchhee karypranali mana jaataa he
 Initiation of excavation involves the removal of the top soil pile by machine
 is saamagree ko metal detector ke dwaara pareekshan kiya jaataa he taaki ki bhul se alag rah gaya koi bhi saamagree khoji ja sake, parantu yadi iske parityag se lekar ab tak yah anchhui nahin rahi he, isamen aadhunik samagriyon kii ek parat milegi jisamen puratathvik ruchi kaa abhaav hoga
 a feature located in rural areas is visible below the surface, but in urban areas there may be a pearl layer of human deposit, and initially the topmost reference will be displayed and it has to be distinguished from other references
 sandarbhon tathaa feechar ke namoonay lene kii ek ranneeti banaayin jaati he jisamen prayek feechar ke purna utkhanan athwa aanshik utkhanan ke vishay main nirnay liya jaataa he
 The preferred goal of excavation is to remove all archaeological deposits and features in the reverse order of their construction and to create a Harris Matrix as a chronological record or "sequence"
 This Harris matrix is used to explain and add to the ever-increasing units of knowledge
 puratathvik sthal se stareekrut rup se hataaya janaa yahaan kii ghatnaon ke kalanukram ko samajhane ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 However it is thought that "archaeological deposits should go from the site in the reverse order of their arrival"
 a grid is usually made in which the site is divided into 5-meter squares so that the features and references can be correctly placed in the map of the entire site
 is grid ko aam taur par kisi rashtriya jeeometic database, jaise ki britain ke ordenance survey, main shaamil kar diya jaataa he
 In the archeology of urban areas this grid becomes invaluable in the implementation of single reference recordings
 ekal sandarbh recording kaa vikaas 1970 ke dashak main landan sangrahalay ke dwaara kiya gaya tha tathaa tab se vishwa ke kai bhaagon main yah mul recording pranali ban gayi he, yah vishesh rup se shahari kshetron ke puraatatv kii jatiltaaon tathaa starikaran ke sarvatha anukool he
 Each excavated reference is given a "reference number" and is written on a reference sheet by type and is probably made on the entire plan or field
 samay kii kami or mahatv ke aadhaar par sandarbhon kii tasviren khinchi ja sakati hai lekin is maamle main photography kaa uddeshy sandarbhon kaa vargeekaran or uskaa anya sandarbhon se sambandh hota he
 The receipts of each reference are placed in bags along with their reference number and the code number of the site so that it can be used later in the reference per post excavation
 sandarbh ke mukhya hisson kii samudr str se oonchai, udhaaharan ke liye diwaar ke upree tathaa nichle hisse kaa antar, nikaal kar yojana ke khandon tathaa sandabh shit main darj kar liya jaataa he
 Heights are recorded with the dirty site or the entire station and are viewed relative to the site temporary benchmark
 kabhi kabhi sandarbhon se jamaa kiye gaye namoonay bhi liye jate hai taaki baad main inkaa paryaavarniya vishleshan athwa vaigyanik kalankan kiya ja sake
 The classic tradition of stratified excavation in its original sense involves a cyclic process in which it is "re-sputtered" to the surface of the site and separates the references and verges that are considered as part of their completeness or any other context
 Can only be understood sandarbh ko paribhaashit karne kii is praarambhik prakriya ke baad, sandarbh kaa moolyankan sthal kii vistrut jaankaree ke sambandh main isliye kiya jaataa he ki jisase sthal ko charnon main baantne kii aavashyaktaa ko jaancha ja sake, iske pashchaat ise vibhinn tareekon se hataaya va record kiya jaataa he
 Often, due to a practical approach or error, the process of defining the verge of reference is not followed and the reference is extracted without sequence or in a non-stratified manner
 isko "bina charan kii khudaai" kaha jaataa he
 This is not good practice
 sandarbh ko hataane ke pashchaat, tathaa yadi vyaavhaarik ho to feechar ke liye sandarbhon ke samooh ko hataane ke baad, "pruthak karte hue khudaai karte janaa" prakriya ko tab tak doharaaya jaataa he jab tak ki us puratathvik sthal se maanav nirmit avshesh puri tarah se hataa na liye jaayen, tathaa sthal ko puri tarah se prakritik na bana diya jaye
 The process of excavation can be obtained in many different ways and it depends on the type and time frame of the residue
 mukhya rup se avasheshon ko trowel tathaa matock kii sahaayta se uthaa kar thele athwa baltiyon main bhar kar baahar le jaaya jaataa he
 Many other tools, including thin towels, such as plaster leaf towels and several categories of brushes, are used for fragile items such as human bones and rotten wood
 puratathvik record se saamagree ko hataane ke kuch buniyadi disha nirdeshon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 These errors of excavation can be classified into two basic categories and it is almost certain to have one because excavation is a destructive process that records and destroys information and corrects mistakes easily
 Can not be done with adhik kaata janaa soochna kii haani darshata he jabaki kam kaata janaa mithyaa soochna darshata he
 One role of an archaeologist is to avoid false information and also to minimize loss of information
 ve vasteen evam shilpakritiyaan jo puratetvik abhilekhon main ab bhi shesh hai, ve sambandhit sandarbh ke utkhanan dwaara prapti ke dauraan mukhyatah haath se or avlokan ke madhyam se hi nikaali gayi hai
 Several other techniques are also available depending on suitability and time frame
 choti vastuon kii khudaai ko adhiktam karne hetu chaanane or plavan kii vidhi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise mitti ke paatro ke chote thikre yaa chakamak pathar ke tukade
 shodh aadhaarit utkhanan, jahaan kaaphi samay hota he, main chaanane kii vidhi kaa prayog kaaphi prachlan main he
 The process of filtering cement mix and mass level has also been successful to some extent
 is vidhi ke dwaara belche or matock se sandarbh ko shighratapurvak hataaya ja saktaa he, phir bhi isamen khudaai kii dar ucch rahati he
 The spoils are poured into the alloy by the belche and water is added to prepare the solution, which is then poured through a mesh filter
 plavan khudaai kii ek aisi prakriya he jo spoil ko pani kii sataha par daalane or baith chuke spoil main tairti hui vastuon ko alag karne ke dwaara sampadit kii jaati he, yah paryaavarniya data kii punarprapti ke liye vishesh rup se upyukt vidhi he, jaise beej or choti haddiyaan
 sabhi vastuon ko utkhanan ke dauraan hi nahin nikaala jaataa or kuch to vishesh rup se utkhanan ke baad, utkhanan ke dauraan liye gaye namoonon ke aadhaar, nikaali jaati hai, visheshtah plavan kii kriya utkhanan ke baad hi kii jaati he
 The role of the expert is important in extracting objects during excavation, which gives information about the calculation of the location related to the archaeological records in the context
 iske dwaara, praapt vastuon ke avshesh ke ucch kram ke sandarbh main punah nikshipt ho jane se, iske falswaroop hone vaali sambhavit khojon ke sambandh main pehle se jaankaree mil sakati he
 The computation of the location is part of the confirmation process and the evaluation of the validity of the functional concept on the phasing of the archaeological site during excavation
 udahaaran ke liye, ek aniyamit madhyayugin mitti ke thikre kaa ek pratyaashit louhayug naalee main paaya janaa, avashya hi us sthal par khudaai kii sahi yojana ke vichaaron ko swaabhaavik rup se badal degaa or prakshep kii prakruti ke bare main galat avadharana ke falswaroop kho sakane vaali anek jaankariyon ko surakshit kar legaa, jo utkhanan ke dwaara nasht ho jaati or jiske parinamswaroop utkhanan ke pashchaat visheshgy ko us puratetvik sthal se anya koi jaankaree mil paane kii sambhaavna bhi simit ho jaati
 yaa aniyamit jaankaree utkhanan main "anderkating" ke rup main trutiyaan dikhaa sakati he
 The calculation method depends to some extent on proper excavation and thus these two processes depend on each other
 khudaai karanevaale yantron ke prayog main lagaataar vruddhi ho rahaa he, visheshtah vikasakarta dwaara karwaae jane vaale utkhanan main, aisa mukhyatah samay ke dabaav ke karan hota he
 This is a matter of dispute because as a result of their use, the difference in the results regarding how the archaeological order is recorded at an archaeological site is definitely reduced
 mashiinon kaa prayog mukhyatah aadhunik boj ko hataane or spoil ko niyantrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Excavators in British archeology are sometimes indicated by the nickname "the Big Yellow Trowel"
 puratetvik utkhanan karne waalon kaa ek samooh saamanyatya ek nireekshak ke liye kaam karata he jo sthal nideshak yaa pariyojna prabandhak ke prati javabdeh hota he
 In the end he will be responsible for interpreting the archaeological site and preparing the final report
 adhikansh utkhanan antat vyavsaayik patron main prakashit kiye jate hai, haalanki is prakriya main kai varshon kaa samay lag jaataa he
 This process takes place after excavation and develops countless other experts
 taron kaa bedh karte samay hamen bahut-si niharikas uplabdh hoti hai, jinke vishleshan se hamen pataa chalaa he ki unamem se bahut-si gas yaa dhul ke megh hai
 The spectrums of stars also have some differences from the normal spectrum, due to which stellar gas or dust has been understood
 yah taramdhyavarti gas yaa dhul hi hamaari tara pranaaliyon ko janm dene vaali he
 As long as these substances exist in the world, new stars and stars will be born
 inkaa mul tatv praaia: hydrogen he
 These clouds have a diameter of 10 parsecs or less
 vishwa main gas yaa dhul kii kul dravya maatra anumaanath: surya kii dravya maatra kii 20 arab guni he
 Most of the stars are of the main order, of which the Sun is one
 in taron main bhi adhikansh taare dhundhale hai
 The basic elements of these stars are often the same
 dravya maatra ke kam yaa adhik hone se inkaa sthaan mukhya kram vakr main neeche yaa upar nishrchit kiya jaataa he
 The second place in terms of the number of stars is whitewashed wires
 iske atiriku daanav tathaa atidaanav taron ke varg hai
 Intermediate classes are also available
 yatha upadaanav tathaa upwaman aadi
 These classifications are closely related to the development of stars
 adhikansh taron ke mul tatwon main hydrogen kaa pratham sthaan he tathaa helium kaa doosraa, kintu taron main anya mul tatv bhi vidyaman hai
 Not dividing these elements in all strings a bit he
 Therefore, there is also a difference in their composition
 mukhya kram ke taron ke mul tatwon main hydrogen kii dravya maatra 70-90 pratishat tathaa helium 10-30 pratishat rahati he
 Metal elements are negligible in the wires of the second population and up to three percent in the wires of the first population
 taron ko mukhyatya carbonchakr athwa protein se protone abhikriya kii vidhiyon se anvik urja praapt hoti he
 In this process, the hydrogen particles of stars continue to break down into helium
 iske pashrchaat taare sankochan se ooshmaa praapt karte he
 Molecular reactions also begin in helium molecules when the internal heat is greatly increased by shrinkage
 isse bhi taare bahut samay tak urja praapt karte hai
 According to this process, the main basis of the life of stars is the storage of hydrogen available in them
 taron kaa urja prasaaran unki dravya maatra ke ghan kaa anupaati hota he, jiske falswaroop adhik dravya maatra ke taron kaa jeevankaal kam dravya maatra ke taron ke jeevankaal kii apeksha kam rahata he
 About 50-60 years ago, the reason for the continuous lighting of stars was considered to be the shrinkage method only
 sar naraman lakere ne isi aadhaar par taron ke vikaas kaa siddhant prastut kiya tha
 According to this theory, the stars were conceived in the initial stage as huge and frosty, which moved upward of the spectrum due to the increase of heat by shrinkage and then vanished by becoming frosty, becoming red colored vamana
 us samay tak jyotishiyon ne daanavaakar tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa adhyayan nahin kiya tha
 Subsequently, the famous theory of developmental philosophy was presented by Henry Norris Russell in 1913 AD
 isamen kalpana kii gai ki taron kaa vikaas laal rangavaale daanavaakar taron se hua jo dhire-dhire nile daanavaakar taare banakar mukhya kram-vakr ke neeche kii ore aate hai tathaa prakashahin ho jate hai
 This theory continued to prevail for about 20 years
 isi bich anushakti kaa gyaan ho jane se sankochan kaa sthaan anvik abhikriya ko mila
 In relation to the development of stars in the present period, most astrologers believe that the initial development of stars occurs as a star of the main order
 kuch samay tak kam dravya maatra ke taare mukhya kram-vakr ke saath chalate rahete hai
 Thereafter, they start consuming more of their hydrogen content and their heat and size starts to increase
 tab ve mukhya kram-vakr ko chhodkar vamavart se, vakr ke dahini ore se, shighrata se upar kii ore badhane lagate hai
 High-volume stars start coming down from the clockwise direction
 charam seemaa par pahunchne tak inkaa hydrogen bhandar samaapt ho jaataa he
 Then they start to get cold and move towards the main sequence
 is samay inamen sankoch kaa prarambh hone se inke helium bhandar main bhi anvik abhikriya aarambh ho jaati he
 The helium at the center of them has a strong molecular reaction and there is pressure disturbance within them
 kadachitisi kaaran inamen aavartan se sankochan or prasaaran utpanda ho jaataa he tathaa yai chaltaron kaa rup le lete hai
 When they consume all types of molecular energy sources, they survive for some time after shrinkage
 is avasthaa ke taare shwet vaaman hote hai
 All their fluids are in a deformed state and due to atrocities from the namikas, their density atyant bad jaataa he
 This is the last stage of the life of stars
 taare bina virodh ke mrityu mukh main nahin aate
 Therefore, before it is finally extinguished, there is a terrible explosion in them and the stars, as newcomers, take a momentarily bright life and are forever lightless
 vikrut gaison ke siddhant se pataa chalata he ki keval ve hi taare shwetvaman ban sakate hai, jinaki dravya maatra surya kii dravya maatra ke lagbhag 1
4 se kuch kam ho
 The amount of liquid of many stars is less than this limit
 isse adhik dravya maatra ke taare tabhi shwetvaman ban sakate hai, jab ve apni kuch dravya maatra kho den
 Such stars have been seen as supernatural stars, which lose their material quantity by explosion
 is vishrleshan se inhen atipurana hona chahie kintu inamen papuleshan dwitiya jaisaa teevr veg nahin he or inamen kuch akashgangeey tarapunjon main bhi Has been shown, which is relatively new
 is prakaar dekhne se shwetvaman taaro ke vikaas kii avasthaa rahasyamay prathit hoti he
 If we do not consider their individual nature for the development of stars, consider their collective form, then we have to analyze the sections of Population i and Population II
 ye donon vikaas kii do charam avasthaaen hai
 Population II has neither superheating stars, nor gas, nor dust, nor rapid rotation
 population pratham main dhul, gas, chamkile taare tathaa teevr ghurnan hai
 These stars are available in spiral arms
 iskaa arth yah hua ki population dwitiya kii navnirmaan kii shaqti samaapt ho chuki he tathaa population pratham abhi vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main he
 The celestial masses develop from gas clouds
 gas megh ke bhitari anuon main uthal-puthal hoti rahati he
 Due to this conflict of molecules, sometimes parts of it will become over-starred due to rotation, but fragments of low mass will be excessive, which will become the stars of the main order
 ativishwaas dravya bhaag akashgangeey punj banenge
 Fully existing stars will become members of Population II
 taron ke vikaas kii pranali ko ham akashgangaon ke vikaas se bhi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Irregular galaxies first develop
 jab ye kisi aksh ke id-gird ghurnan prarambh kar detii hai to vah gas dhul jo abhi tara nahin bani, inke aksh par lamb samtal ke chaaron ore ikattha hone lagati he
 As long as gas dust is available, new stars are born and become members of population first and old stars become like stars of population second in properties
 jab gas yaa dhul samaapt ho jaati he to ye akashgangaayen dirghavrittakar ho jaati he
 Small galaxies rarely spiral at all
 badi akashgangaayen ghurnan se sarpil bhujaaon ko utpanda kar leti hai
 Spiral galaxies are also members of Population II due to the intensity of rotation
 apni sarpil bhujaaon ko dhire-dhire kho detii hai tathaa unka antim rup dirghavrittakar he
 The main-order wires have rotational motion
 apane vikaas kii avasthaa main ye sankochan ke samay teevr They gain rotational momentum, and some parts of it separate from them to become new stars
 kadachityahi kaaran he ki hamen dohare taare adhik maatra main milte hai
 The main-order wires, which have low rotational speed, take the form of corrugated wires by increasing their size from dust or gas particles
 kadachit isiilie inkaa vayumandal adhik vistrut hota he
 All theories of the development of stars are still in abeyance
 inke vishay main or pareekshan tathaa anusandhan ho rahe hai
 Therefore, we will be able to prove the truth of these principles in future tests

 According to Hindu belief, only their descendants helped in the spread of the world

 The name is also widely used in other codes

 According to Aitareya Brahmin, he had anointed a king named 'vishwakarma Bhabhavan'
 aitarey brahmanon ne kashyapon kaa sambandh janamejay se bataaya gaya he
 Prajapati is called Kashyapa in Shatapatha Brahmin: mahabharat evam puraanon main asuron kii utpatti evam vanshavali ke varnan main kaha gaya he kii brahma ke chah maanas putron main se ek 'marichi' the jinhone apni ichha se kashyap naamak prajapati putr utpann kiya

 unke naam hai: aditi, danu, vinata, arashtha, kadru, sursha, khasha, surabhi, tamra, krodhavsha, ira or muni in se sab sristi hui
 Kashyapa is also the name of a gotra
 yah bahut vyapak gotra he
 For those who do not have gotra, Kashyapa gotra is imagined, because according to one tradition, all living beings originated from Kashyapa
 ek baar samast prithvi par vijay praapt kar parashuram ne vah kashyap muni ko daan kar di
 Kashyap Muni said- 'now you don't stay in my country
 ' at: guru kii ajna kaa paalan karte hue parashuram ne raat ko prithvi par na rahane kaa sankalp kiya
 They started going to Mahendra mountain every night with intense movement like mind

 Both of them were married to Maharishi Kashyap
 ek baar prasann hokar kashyap ne un donon ko manachaaha var maangane ko kaha
 Kadru asked for a mighty serpent-like son, and Vinata asked for two more stunning sons than him
 kalantar main donon ko kramash: ek sahastra, tathaa do andey praapt hue
 500 years later the serpent of Kadru's eggs appeared
 vinata ne irshyaavash apana ek anda swayan hi tod daalaa
 An undeveloped child came out of it, the subdivision was not developed, the subdivision did not develop, he was furious and cursed the mother to be the slave of Kadru for 500 years and said that if the second egg does not boil prematurely, then it will give the fully developed child to the mother
 Will release from slavery
 pehla balak arun banakar akaash main surya kaa sarathi ban gaya tathaa doosraa balak garud banakar akaash main ud gaya
 Vinata and Kadru once went out for a walk
 vahaan ucchashrava naamak ghode ko dekhakar donon kii shart lag gayi ki jo uskaa rang galat bataayegi, vah duusari kii daasi banegi
 The next day there was talk of horse color
 vinata ne uskaa rang safed bataaya tha tathaa kadru ne uskaa rang safed, par poonch kaa rang kaala bataaya tha
 Kadru had fraud in his mind
 usne ghar jate hi apane putron ko uski poonch par lipatakar kaale baalo kaa rup dhaaran karne kaa aadesh diya jisase vah vijayi ho jaay
 He cursed the snakes who did not obey his command that they should be consumed in the yagya of Janamejaya
 is shaap kaa anumodan karte hue brahma ne kashyap ko bulaayaa or kaha-'tumse utpann sarpon kii sankhya bahut bad gayi he
 Your wife did well by cursing them, so don't be angry with her
 ' aisa kahkar brahma ne kashyap ko sarpon kaa vish utaarne kii vidya pradaan kii
 When Vinata and Kadru went to see the Uchrashvarava the next day, it looked black due to its tail being covered with black snakes

 Garuda asked the snakes that what is the work that his mother would get rid of slavery? His Nag brothers asked him to bring amrit
 garud ne amrit kii khoj main prasthaan kiya
 He had to fight with all the gods
 sabase adhik shaktishaalee hone ke kaaran garud ne sabhi ko parrast kar diya
 Later he reached Amrit
 atyant sookshm rup dhaaran karke vah amritaghat ke paas nirantar chalane vaale chakra ko paar kar gaya
 Two snakes were guarding there
 un donon ko markar vah amritaghat uthaakar le uda
 Seeing that he himself did not drink the nectar, Vishnu was pleased at his insipid gesture and gave him a boon that without saying that drink the nectar too it would be ajar-immortal and his place on the Vishnu-flag
 garud ne vishnu kaa vaahan bananaa bhi sweekaar kiya
 Indra met on the way
 indra ne usase amrit-kalash maanga or kaha ki yadi sarpon ne iskaa paan kar liya to atyadhik ahit hoga
 Garuda tells Indra that he is taking Amrit for some purpose
 jab vah amrit-kalash kahin rakh de, indra use le le
 Indra was pleased and gave Garuda a boon that snakes would be his food items
 tadnantar garud apni maa ke paas pahunchaa
 He informed the snakes that he had brought the nectar
 sarp vinata ko daasitv se mukt kar den tathaa snaan kar len
 He placed the nectar-kalash on misrule until Indra stole the nectar after the snake returned by taking a bath
 sarpon ne kusha ko hi chata jisase unki jeebh ke do bhaag ho gaye, at: ve dwijive kahalaane lage
 Indra was very jealous of the Balkhilya Maharishi
 rusht hokar blakhilya ne apni tapasya kaa bhaag kashyap muni ko diya tathaa indra kaa mad nasht karne ke liye kaha
 Kashyapa married Suparna and Kadru
 donon ke garbhini hone par ve unhen sadachaar se ghar main hi rahane ke liye kahkar anyatra chale gayi
 After his departure, both wives started going to the yagyas of the sages
 ve donon rishiyon ke manaa karne par bhi havishya ko dooshit kar detii thim
 Therefore, due to their curse, they became rivers
