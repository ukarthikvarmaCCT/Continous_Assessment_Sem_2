 Krasi is a region of Eastern Europe which used to be eastern part of Poland before World War II but which was separated from that country and made part of Soviet Union
 1991 main soviet sangh ke tuutane ke baad ab yah ilaaka pashchimi ukraine, pashchimi belarus or purvi lithuania main sammilit he
 In Polish language 'krasi' means 'border area'
 isamen 'ji' kii maatra or uccharan par dhyaan den
 It is different from the pronunciation of both 'a' and 'aye' and is similar to the sound that comes from the word 'man' in English
 krasi apane itihaas main bahut dafaa alag-alag rashtron ke qabze main ja chukaa he
 It has a deep Polish influence and many Polish people lived here, although they never became a majority community in this entire region
 alag-alag samayon par iske puure yaa kuch kshetra par kivian rus, poland, roosi samrajya, germany, soviet sangh, ukraine, belarus or lithuania kaa bhaag rahaa he
 In 1018, the then Polish King Bolleswaf i Chrobri traveled east and attacked the Kingdom of Kievian Russia
 1340 main krasi kaa or bhi ilaaka polish qabze main aa gaya or polish log yahan jaakar basane lage
 The region had a very dense population and the local Lithuanians and Ruthenians had to accept Polish control
 1569 main 'lublin kii sandhi' naamak ghoshnaa ke antargat polish-lithuani rashtramandal sthapit hua
 After the creation of this large empire, many Polish people settled in large quantities in the Cross
 sthaneey gair-polish logon ke ucch virgon ne bhi majabuuran polish samskruti apnaani shuru kar di
 Nevertheless, the Polish people were a minority community in these areas
 1772 main purv se shaktishaalee roosi samrajya ne polish-lithuani rashtramandal ke purvi aadhe bhaag par qabza kar liya
 Although the Polish people were not a majority in this area, the region had become very important in Polish culture and national dignity
 polish logon ne ise 'chori kii gai dharti' bulaanaa shuru kar diya or ise waapas lene kii teevr ichha polish maansikta main panpane lagi
 Russia used to call it 'western Krai'
 yahan rus ke kilaaf vidroh hue jinhen jor se kuchlaa gaya or bahut se sthaneey polish nivaasiyon ko siberia bhej diya gaya
 The First World War ended in 1919
 roosi samrajya kii jagah soviet sangh ek nae desh ke rup main upasthit hua
 a new nation was formed in Poland, historically called the 'second Polish Republic'
 british videsh vibhaag ne purvi europe main shanti banaae rakhane ke liye soviet sangh or poland ke bich ek seemaa kaa prastaav rakhaa
 It was named after India's former Viceroy Lord Curzon and came to be called 'curzon Seema'
 lekin 1918 se 1922 ke kaal main poland ne teen jangen ladi - polish-ukraini yuddh, polish-soviet yuddh or polish-lithuani yuddh - or teenon hi jeet gaya
 The Cressey region east of the Curzon border was occupied by Poland
 poland ne yahan polish log basaane shuru kar die jis se sthaneey ukrainiyon ke saath bahut jhadpen hoti thim jinhen poland kuchalata gaya
 In 1933, the Nazi government came from Poland to the west in Germany, which wanted to expand towards the east
 unhone soviet sangh ke saath 1939 main ek gupt samjhauta kiya jiske antargat poland ko un deshon ke bich baant lene kii aapasi santh-ganth ho gai
 On 17 September 1939, the Soviet Union captured the Cross
 krasi ke polish samudaay ke ek bade bhaag ko jabardastee sudur purv siberia or kazakhstan bhej diya gaya
 The Second World War broke out in Europe, and Germany later attacked the Soviet Union and took control of the Cross and other areas
 1943-1944 main ukraini vidrohi sena ne ukraini kisaanon kii madad se dakshin-purvi krasi main 50 hazaar se 1 lakh ke bich polish logon kaa qatl kiya

 1943 ke tehran sammelan main america, britain or soviet sangh main samjhauta ho chukaa tha ki yuddh ke baad krasi soviet sangh ko de diya jayega
 The exiled government of Poland, based in London, opposed it, but none of them listened
 1945 main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samaapt hone par polish samyavaadee sarkaar krasi se adhikansh polish logon ko hataane ke liye razaamand ho gai
 Poland was given some eastern areas of Germany and Polish people from all over the countryside were taken there by rail
 udhaaharan ke liye krasi kaa lvuf shahar 'laviv' ke naam se ukraine kaa bhaag ban gaya 
 In the west, the city of Breslau in Germany became part of Poland under the name of Vratswaffe
 lvuf / laviv ke bahut se polish logon ko vahaan se hataakar vratswaf / brislu main basaaya gaya
 In 1944-46, more than 1 million Polish people were removed from the Cross and settled in these new western areas
 polish log apni sarkaar ke chupchaap soviet sangh ko krasi de dene se bahut naaraaz hue or samyavaadiyon ko deshadrohi samajhane lage
 As long as the communists remained in power, they depended on the Soviet Union and the demand to openly return to Poland in Poland was strictly suppressed
 1989 main samyavaadee satta kho baithe or tab se poland main krasi ko lekar bahut sahitya prakashit hua he
 Many Polish reviewers are saddened at the loss of this area

 Mental health describes either the level of cognitive or emotional well-being or the absence of any mental disorder
 sakaaratmak manovigyaan vishay yaa sakalyawaad ke drushtikon se maansik swasthya main ek vyakti ke jivan kaa anand lene kii kshamta or jivan kii gatividhiyon or manovaigyanik lacheelaapan hasil karne ke prayaas ke bich saamanjasy shaamil ho saktaa he
 Mental health is an expression of our emotions and signifies a successful adaptation to a wide range of demands
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan, maansik swasthya ko paribhaashit karte hue kahata he ki yah "salaamati kii ek sthiti he jisamen kisi vyakti ko apni kshamtaaon kaa ehsaas rahata he, vah jivan ke saamaanya tanaavon kaa saamana kar saktaa he, laabhakaari or upyogi rup se kaam kar saktaa he or apane samaaj ke prati yogadan karne main sakasham hota he
 It has been said before that there is no single "official" definition of mental health
 saanskrithik matbhed, vyaktiparak akalan or pratispardhi peshewar siddhant, ye sabhi is baat ko prabhavit karte hai ki "maansik swasthya" ko kaise paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 There are various types of mental health disorders some of which are common, such as depression and anxiety disorders and some are not common, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
 sabase haal main, vaishvik maansik swasthya kaa kshetra ubhara he jise 'adhyayan, shodh or abhyaas ke aise kshetra ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jo maansik swasthya ko sudhaarney ko praathamikta detaa he or duniya bhar main sabhi logon main maansik swasthya ke samaan str ko hasil karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In the mid-19th century, William Sweetzer was the first to clearly define "mental health" for the first time, which can be seen as a precursor to contemporary approaches to the work of promoting positive mental health
 isaac re jo america manorog association ke teraa sansthaapakon main se ek the, unhone maansik swasthya ko ek kala ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he jiskaa kaary he aisi ghatnaon or prabhaavon ke khilaaf mastishk ko sangrakshit karnaa jo isaki urja, gunvattta yaa vikaas ko baadhit yaa nasht kar sakate hai
 An important figure for the field of "mental health" was Dorothy Dix, a school teacher who spent her entire life campaigning to help people who were suffering from mental illness and exposed the harrowing conditions in which these people Used to be kept
 ise "maansik swatchta aandolan" ke rup main janaa gaya
 Prior to this movement, it was common that people affected by mental illness were largely neglected in the 19th century, often left alone in miserable conditions and with barely enough clothing
 dix ke prayaas itane kargar the ki maansik swasthya suvidhaon main rogiyon kii sankhya main vruddhi hone lagi, jiske parinamswaroop in rogiyon kii dekhbhaal acchhee tarah nahin ho paa rahi thi, kyonki in sansthaanon main karmchaariyon kii bade paimaane par kami thi
 In the early 20th century, Clifford Byers established the National Mental Health Committee and opened the first outpatient mental health clinic in the United States
 haalanki vaastavik manorog aspataal main ilaaj kii aitihaasik shuruyaat abhi bhi vivaad kaa vishay he, is baat ke saboot jamaa ho rahe hai ki pashchimi duniya main pehla pramanik manorog aspataal spain main 15 veen sadi ke dauraan sthapit kiya gaya
 The form describes the earliest of those hospitals, which was opened in 1410 by Father Juan Gilabert Joffre, a Mercederian ascetic and a group of concerned citizens of Valencia
 aspataal aaj bhi sanchaalan main he
 Mental health can be seen as a continuum where a person's mental health can have many different potential values
 maansik swasth ko aam taur par ek sakaaratmak gun ke rup main dekha jaataa he, is rup main ki ek vyakti maansik swasthya ke vardhit str tak pahunch saktaa he, bhale hi uname kisi bhi nidaan yogya maansik swasthya kii sthiti nahin he
 This definition of mental health indicates emotional health, the ability to live a full and constructive life, and the flexibility to deal with life's inevitable challenges
 kai chikitsiya pranali or swayan sahaayta kitaaben uplabdh hai jo swasth logon ke maansik kalyaan main atirikt sudhaar laane ke liye tareeke or ranneetiyon ke darshan ko sujhaati hai
 Positive psychology is becoming increasingly important in mental health
 maansik swasthya ke ek samgr model main aamtaur par aisi avadharanaen shaamil hoti hai jo maanavvigyaan, shaikshik, maansik, dharmik or saamaajik drushtikon par aadhaarit hoti he, saath hi saath isamen vyaktitv, saamaajik naidanik, swasthya or vikasaatmak manovigyaan kaa saidhantik drushtikon shaamil hota he
 An example of the welfare model includes models developed by Myers, Sweeney and Wittmer
 It consists of five life tasks - essence or spirituality, work and rest, friendship, love and self-direction and twelve subtasks - sense of utility, sense of control, realistic belief, emotional awareness and coping, problem solving creativity, humor
 Emotion, nutrition, exercise, self-care, stress management, gender identity and cultural identity, all of these as key components of healthy functioning traits and well-being Ana is
 ye ghatak jivan kii paristhitiyon ke prati pratikraya karne ke aise saadhan uplabdh karaate hai jo swasth kaamkaaj ko badhaava detaa he
 Most of the US population is not educated on mental health
 maansik swasthya ko kisi pramukh maansik swasthya haalat ke abhaav ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he yadhyapi sakaaratmak manovigyaan se ubharne vaale haalia sakshya se pataa chalata he ki maansik swasthya kisi maansik vikaar yaa beemaari kii anupasthiti se kahin aage kaa vishay he
 Naturally, mental health refers to the health of a person's mind
 isliye saamaajik, saanskrithik, shaareerik or shaikshanik prabhaav kisi vyakti ke maansik swasthya ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Mental health can be socially constructed and socially defined; That is, different businesses, communities, societies, and cultures have very different ways of conceptualizing their nature and causes, deciding what is mentally healthy and deciding which interventions are appropriate
 is prakaar, vibhinn peshewaron kii apni bhinn saanskrithik or dharmik prishthbhumi or anubhav honge, jo ilaaj ke dauraan lagu kii jane vaali karypranali ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Research suggests stigma is associated with mental illness
 unaited kingdom main, royal college of cycatrist chenging minds abhiyaan yojit kiya taaki is kalank ko kam kiya ja sake
 Many mental health professionals have begun to understand, or have understood, the importance of competence in religious diversity and spirituality

 duryodhana kii kutil nitiyon ke peeche shakuni kaa haath mana jaataa he or vah kurukshetra ke yuddh ke liye doshiyon main pramukh mana jaataa he
 He tricked the Pandavas many times and encouraged his nephew Duryodhana to do devious tricks towards the Pandavas
 uluk shakuni va aarshi kaa putr tha
 Shakuni was born to Subal and Empress Sudarma, the emperor of Gandhar
 shakuni kii bahan gandhari kaa vivaah dhritarashtra se hua tha
 The reason for Shakuni's hatred for the Kuru dynasty was that Bhishma, the commander of Hastinapur, once went to Gandhar to demand Gandhari's hand for Dhritarashtra
 tab gandhari ke pita subal ne ye baat sweekaar kar lee, lekin us samay unhen ye pataa nahin tha kii dhritarashtra janmaandh he
 Shakuni also opposed this, but Gandhari had by now considered Dhritarashtra as her husband
 isliye shakuni ne us din ye pran liya kii vah samooche kuruvansh ke sarvanaash kaa kaaran banegaa
 After dividing the Hastinapur kingdom into two equal pieces, one part, which was completely barren, was given to the Pandavas, which they, with their untiring efforts, converted it into a beautiful city called Indraprastha
 sheeghra hi vahaan kii bhavyata ki charchaayen dur-dur tak hone lageen
 On the occasion of the Rajasuya Yajna performed by Yudhishthira, Duryodhana also had the opportunity to visit that grand city
 vah rajmahal kii bhavyata dekh rahaa tha, ki ek sthaan par usne pani kii tal vaali sajaavat ko thos bhoomi samaj liya or pani me gir gaya
 Duryodhana considered it an insult and returned to Hastinapur
 apane bhaanje kii yah maansik sthiti bhaanpakar, shakuni ne man main pandavon kaa rajpaat chhinane kaa kutil vichaar aayaa
 He invited the Pandavas to play Chaucer and, using his devious intelligence, first asked Yudhishthira to make small claims
 jab yudhisthir khel chhodane kaa man banaata to shakuni dwaara kuch naa kuch kahkar yudhisthir se koi naa koi daav lagava letaa
 In this way, Maharaj Yudhishthira continued to defeat all his things by putting all his things on the daava and in the end he also put his brothers and his wife on the dao and lost them too and thus by insulting Draupadi, Duryodhana took his vengeance
 And took the foundation of the war of Mahabharata on the same day

 In 1861, an English scientist, Thomas Graham, observed that albumin, glue, glue, demand, silicic acid, and other similar substances were not able to filter through the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water
 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil

 For many technical methods, it is necessary to create a color
 jalasantrasi kalil hi saralata se banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki jalpremi kalil utkramntic hai
 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
 arq ke ucch taap par dhaatu vashpikrut ho jaati he
 Then the superfluous particles of vapor get integrated and form the shape of the particles
 vastav main vibhaajan dwaara kalil banane kaa pramukh saadhan kalil-mil he
 In this device, two plates, which are very close to each other, rotate in opposite directions
 vitarit kiya janevaala padaarth uchit madhyam ke saath in donon platon ke bich se bheja jaataa he
 In this way, the particles become smaller and take the shape of darker particles
 donon main se kisi bhi vidhi se nirmit kalilon ke shodhan ke liye unhen manibhabh padaarth se apohan dwaara pruthak kriya jaataa he
 To do this Kalil is placed in a parchment or cellophane bag
 is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein

 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he

 It is not easy to provide these situations with the equipment, as there are many factors that make them different
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : It is a simple experience that the air becomes cold in winter, and very hot in summer
 atev vayumandal main jab parivartan hota he tab uskaa prabhaav har vastu par padataa he
 For example, wood or iron gets cooled or heated according to the decrease in air temperature
 praani bhi jaade main thithurane lagate hai or garmi main vyakul ho uthte hai
 Therefore, it is a problem that while manufacturing the smelter, it should be kept in such a way that it is unaffected by the changes in the external atmosphere according to the weather and the heat inside the smelter remains in a stable state

 tel kii batti kaa bhi ek samaan jalanaa asambhav he, kyonki batti ke jalte rahane par usamen gul pad jaataa he
 The third difficulty is that the arrangement of holes for circulating air in the smelting chamber or spraying water on the eggs as needed can also affect the magnitude of the heat

 Therefore, the equipment should be in such a way that if the temperature starts decreasing inside the vault, then the temperature increases, and if it is rising higher then it decreases
 is bhanti hameshaa taap ek nishchit ansh par tikaa rahe
 In addition to the above difficulties, another difficulty is that space is limited inside the ovum and eggs are laid within it as much as possible
 chunki andey jivit pind hote hai, atev unhen svachh or taaji hawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But due to the movement of air, the evaporation of water from the surface of the eggs begins to increase, so if there is no mechanism to stop this type of evaporation, then on the ninth or tenth day or after that, the eggs will become very dry, while they are pre-dried
