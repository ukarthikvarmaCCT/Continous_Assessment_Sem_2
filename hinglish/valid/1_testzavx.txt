 "the novel has the story of a common pioneer named Raju becoming a spiritual teacher
 raju ek railway guide he jo roji kaa divaana ho jaataa he
 Rosie is the neglected wife of an anthropologist named Marco
 roji ko nrity se behad lagaav tha, lekin marco use isaki anumati nahin detaa he
 Accepting Raju, Rosie once again made up her mind to fulfill her dreams and leave Marco
 raju, roji kaa stage prabandhak ban gaya or raju ke prabandhan kaushal ke kaaran vah jald hi safal nartki ban gai
 But Raju came to mind and tried to control Rosie
 dhire-dhire raju or roji ke bich ke rishte kadave hote gaye
 Marco appears again
 udhar raju jaalsaji ke ek maamle main funs jaataa he or use do saal kii kaid ho jaati he
 When Raju comes out of jail after completing his sentence, the people of a village consider him as a saint
 tab tak uske man main malgudi or roji ke prati virakti ho jaati he or usee gaanv ke ek parityakt mandir main sharan le letaa he
 He helps the villagers in minor problems and thus he becomes a renowned monk
 ekbar us gaanv main akaal padataa he
 The villagers then ask him to fast for rain

 upanyaas ke ant main bhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin mil paata he ki kya raju bhukh se mar jaataa he yaa akaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Rosie is one of the most prominent characters in the guide
 upanyaas main use ek sundar nartki ke rup me prastut kiya gaya he, jisaki marco naamak maanavshastri se shaadi ho jaati he
 The wedding proves to be a curse for Rosie as Marco sees nothing but his work
 roji kii bhaavana ko samajhane kii koshish bhi nahin karata he
 Rosie is crazy about dance
 lekin marco use naachne kii anumati nahin detaa he
 She tries all the way but does not find success
 jab marco use malgudi main chhod detaa he to vah raju ke saath rahane lagati he or apana puraa samay nrity ko dene lagati he
 Rosie is of religious instinct and believes in Goddess Saraswati
 uske offis main kaanse kii najraj kii murti hoti he
 She did not discriminate against people over wealth
 raju amir or prabhavi logon se milanaa pasand karata he lekin roji aise logon ko bhav nahin detii
 kalakaar hone ke naate vah kalakaaron kaa aadar karti he or unke bich main rahanaa chaahati he
 Success does not fill her pride, but she stays grounded despite a successful career in dance
 ekbar raju is baat se gussa jaataa he ki roji uske saath samay nahin bitaakar kalakaaron ke saath samay bitaati he
 Rosie is like a traditional Indian wife
 vah apane pati ko bhagwaan kii tarah maanati he
 But her husband considers her an object and her art is monkey-jumping
 He insults her
 jab marco ko roji or raju ke najdiki rishte ke bare main pataa chalata he to vah kshubdh ho jaati he or uski upeksha karata he
 Rosie wanted to change Marco but that didn't change
 This shows that Rosie was very tolerant and hopeful
 safal nartki banane ke baad bhi uske man main apane pati ke prati sammaan kaa bhav tha

 Forests, habitats for animals, affect the water cycle and are useful for soil conservation, hence it is called an important part of the Earth's biosphere
 van dharti ke sabase pramukh sthaliy paaritantr hai
 The fauna of the forest house is responsible for 75% of the total gross primary product of the system and 80% of the earth's vegetation is found in the forests
 Forests at different heights form different ecosystems
 Such as the boreal forest near the poles, tropical forest near the equator and temperate forest at moderate heights
 The height of an area and the moisture present there affect the trees found in that area
 Humans and forests have both positive and negative effects on each other
 Forests provide resources to humans, they also provide sources of earning
 Forests also affect the health of humans
 While there is a negative impact on the forest due to human intervention

 The best known and most extensive are the lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforests include, for example: the seasonally inundated varzea and igapó forests and the terra firme forests of the Amazon Basin; the peat forests and moist dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia; and the high forests of the Congo Basin
 The forests of tropical mountains are also included in this broad category, generally divided into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of their physiognomy, which varies with altitude
 This mountain forests include cloud forests, which derive a significant portion of their water budget from clouds to high elevations, among those forests and support a rich abundance of vascular and nonvascular epiphyseates

 The Inuit have many different tribes but they all have mutual similarities and relationships
 'inuit' ek bahuvachan shabd he or ek vyakti ko 'inuk' kaha jaataa he
 In the old days the Inuit people were called 'eskimo' but many Inuit people consider it a derogatory term, so now this caste is usually called 'inuit'
 'inuit' shabd kaa arth 'log' he

 Meghdootam is a famous ambassador composed by Mahakavi Kalidasa
 isamen ek yaksha kii katha he jise kuber alakapuri se nishkasit kar detaa he
 The expelled Yaksha resides on the Ramagiri mountain
 varsha ritu main use apni premika kii yaad sataane lagati he
 Kamartha Yaksha thinks that it is not possible for him to return to Alkapuri by any means, so he decides to send his message through the messenger to the girlfriend
 akelepan kaa jivan guzaar rahe yaksha ko koi sandeshvahak bhi nahin miltaa he, isliye usne megh ke madhyam se apana sandesh virahaakul premika tak bhejne kii baat sochi
 In this way, the clouds rising on the sky on the first day of Ashada combined with Kalidasa's imagination, created a unique work
 meghdoot kii lokapriyata bhartiya sahitya main pracheen kaal se hi rahi he
 While famous commentators have written commentaries on it, many Sanskrit poets have written many ambitions inspired by it or based on it
 bhaavana or kalpana kaa jo udaatt prasar meghdoot main uplabdh he, vah bhartiya sahitya main anyatra viral he
 Nagarjuna, in the role of Meghdoot's Hindi translation, described it as a unique part of Hindi poetry
 meghdutam kavy do khandon main vibhakt he
 Yaksha in East Megh describes the cloud from Ramagiri to Alakapuri and in Yaksh in Uttaramegh it is the famous poignant message of Yaksha in which Kalidasa has poured out the spirit of love

 There are about 115 verses in "meghdoot", although in different versions the number of these verses is also slightly more than manipulation
 dow es

 Most of the thinkers believe that Kalidas has fixed a sad story of his life by making a message in Meghdoot
 hindi kavi nagarjun ke anusaar- The rainy season is the first day of the Ashadh month in the Kadekh Gagan, when the mind of the black cube-ghatvidur Yaksha was sent to the beautiful peak of Chitrakoot with folded hands, which was sent by the poor, who sent the message of the cloud of the cloud of the cloud of the Kaalidas! Be truly tired of the pain of the whole world and be amused by the peaks of amal-dhawal Giri! How long did you sleep? Yaksha cried or you cried? Kalidas! Tell the truth mahabharat ke "nalopakhyaan" naamak aakhyaan main nal tathaa damayanti dwaara isko doot banaakar paraspar sandash preshan kii jo katha ai he, vah bhi dootkavy kii parampara kaa hi anusaran he
 The poet, who, like "meghdoot", wrote in the Mandakranta stanza "parshvabhyudaya", a poem of four cantos related to the life of Tirthankar Parshvanath, which contains the centuries-old verse of Meghdoot as the legend of Meghd
 15veen shatabdi main "neminath" or "rajmati" vaale prasang ko lekar "vikram" kavi ne "nemidoot" kavy likhaa, jisamen meghudat" ke 125 padyon ke antim charnon ko samasya banaakar kavi ne neminath dwaara parityakt rajmati ke virah kaa varnan kiya he
 During this period, another Jain poet "charitra Sundar Gani" composed the Shantarasavakic Jain poetry "shiladoot"

 sajiv koshikaon ke dwaara prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit karne kii kriya ko prakaash sanshleshan kehete he
 Photosynthesis is the process in which plants produce carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground in the presence of sunlight through their green limbs, such as leaves, to produce complex organic foods such as carbohydrates and exclude oxygen gases
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main paudhon kii hari pattiyon kii konshikaon ke andar carbon diaksaide or pani ke sanyog se pehle saadhaaran carbohydrate or baad main jatil kabohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this process, oxygen and energy-rich carbohydrates, etc
) are produced and the oxygen gas comes out
 jal, carbondioxide, surya kaa prakaash tathaa chlorophyl ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa avyav kehete hai
 Out of this, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials of photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya sabase mahatvapurn jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon main se ek he
 All the living beings of the world directly or indirectly depend on it
 prakaash sanshveshan karne vaale sajivon ko swaposhi kehete hai
 Light does not participate in the reaction here, rather the presence of light is necessary for this reaction
 is rasinic kriya main carbondioxide ke 6 anuon or jal ke 12 anuon ke bich rasinic kriya hoti he jiske falswaroop glucose ke ek anu, jal ke 6 anu tathaa oksijan ke 6 anu utpann hote hai
 In this activity, the main product is glucose, and oxygen and water are released as a substance
 is pratikriya main utpann jal koshika dwaara avashoshit ho jaataa he or punah jaev-rasinic pratikriyaaon main lag jaataa he
 Free oxygen enters the atmosphere
 is mukt oxigen kaa strot jal ke anu he carbondioxide ke anu nahin
 The reaction converts the sun's radiation energy into chemical energy
 jo glucose ke anuon main sanchit ho jaati he
 In photosynthesis, solar energy of about 100 terawatts per year is tied up as chemical energy into food molecules
 is urja kaa pariman puri maanav sabhyataa ke vaarshik urja kharch se bhi 7 guna adhik he
 This energy is stored here as potential energy
 atah prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko urja bandhan kii kriya bhi kehete hai
 Thus photosynthetic organisms convert about 10,00,00,00,000 tonnes of carbon into biomass every year
 bahut pracheen kaal se yah gyaat he ki paudhe apana poshan jadon dwaara praapt karte hai
 In 1772, Stephen Helles stated that the leaves of plants take food from the air and light has some important function in this activity
 pristle ne 1772 main pehle bataaya ki is kriya ke dauraan utpann vaayu main mombatti jalaai jaye to yah jalati rahati he
 If a living mouse is placed in the air generated after burning the candle, it dies
 usne 1775 main punah bataaya ki paudhon dwaara din ke samay main nikali gas oxygen hoti he
 After this, the engine house stated in 1779 that green plants consume co2 in sunlight and remove oxygen
 di
 saasuur ne 1804 main bataaya paudhe din or raat shwasan me to oxijan hi lete he par prakaash sanshleshan ke dauran oxijan mukt karte he
 Therefore, oxygen is used throughout the day, but oxygen is made only by photosynthesis with carbon dioxide
 saas ne 1887 main bataaya ki hare paudhon ke co2 grahan karne tathaa o2 nikaalane se paudhon main starch kaa nirmaan hota he
 The process of photosynthesis occurring in green plants is a very important activity for plants and other living beings
 is kriya main paudhe surya ke prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit kar dete hai tathaa CO2 pani jaise saadhaaran padaarthon se jatil carbon yogic carbohydrates ban jate hai
 It is only through these carbohydrates that humans and living beings get food
 is prakaar paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dwaara sampoorn praani jagat ke liye bhojan-vyavastha karte hai
 Various crops are grown to obtain carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins etc
 and all these substances are produced by photosynthesis
 rabad, plastic, tel, celulos evam kai aushadhiyaan bhi paudhon main prakaash sanshleshan kriya main utpann hoti he
 Green trees take carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and remove oxygen, thus purifying the atmosphere
 oxigen sabhi jantuon ko saans lene ke liye ati aavashyak he
 This action is also very important for the protection of the environment

 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration, in turn, results in water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaaye apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Photosynthesis takes place only from green plants and the equation is very simple
 phir bhi yah ek vivadagrast prashn he ki kis prakaar CO2 evam pani jaise saral padaarth, carbohydrates jaise jatil padaarthon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 From time to time, various plant technology experts have expressed different views to understand this activity
 inamen baiyar, willstator tathaa stall tathaa aranon ke mat pramukh hai
 The votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal have only historical significance
 inako baad ke pareekshanon main sahi nahin paaya gaya
 In 1967, Arnone reported that the protein found in the chloroplast had a major function in photosynthesis
 aadhunik yug main sabhi vaigyanikon dwaara yah maanya he ki prakaash sanshleshan main swatantra oxygen pani se aati he
 On the basis of many experiments in modern times, it has been proved that the process of photosynthesis takes place in the following two stages
 pehle charan main prakaash prakriya athwa hill prakriya athwa photochemical prakriya
 And in the second stage the dark process or the Blackman process or the lightless process
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main donon prakriyaayen ek duusare ke pashchaat hoti he
 The light process ignores the dark process more quickly
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya paudhe ke sabhi chloroplast yukt koshikaon main hoti he
 That means all the green parts of the plant
 yah kriya visheshtah pattiyon ke mesophil utak main hoti he kyonki pattiyon ke mesophil utak kii perenima koshikaon main anya koshikaon kii upeksha chloroplast kii maatra adhik hoti he
 The process of photosynthesis that takes place in the presence of light is studied under light action
 is kriya ko hill aadi anya vaigyanikon dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya
 Dark processes act as a limiting factor when lighting processes
 prakaash prakriyaayen do charnon main hoti hai, photolysis evam hydrogen kaa sthaapan
 In the process of photolysis, light is absorbed as a photon by a molecule of chlorophyll
 jab chlorophyl kaa anu ek kwantem prakaash shoshit kar letaa he uske pashchaat chlorophyl kaa doosraa anu tab tak prakaash shoshit nahin karata he jab tak ki pehali urja prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main prayog nahin ho jaati he
 Photons of light thus absorbed by chlorophyll ejects an electron at high energy levels and this power is located on the third bond of phosphate and appears as high-energy adenosine triphosphate
 is prakaar chloropil prakaash kii upasthiti main atipi utpann karte hai tathaa is prakriya ko phosphorailation kehete hai
 In this way, the energy of sunlight is converted into ATP, ie chemical energy
 is prakaar chlorophyl anu main nirmit atipi chlorophyl anu se pruthak hokar CO2 ko sharkara main anoksikrut hone aadi anek rasinic kriyaaon main sahaayak he
 Chlorophyll becomes inert again upon freeing this ATP
 vaan nil frank, vishanik ke anusaar pani jab is kriyasheel chlorophyl ke sampark main aate hai tab pani anoksikrut h tathaa tej oxykaarak OH main vichchhedit ho jaataa he
 Chlorophyll + Light → Activated Chlorophyll H2O + Activated Chlorophyll → h + + OH- In this photolysis process O2 is liberated from water and hydrogen also moves to the hydrogen subscriber
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 is prakaar paudhon kii prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriyaayon se nikali samast oxygen jal se praapt hoti hai
 Hill, Reuben supported it and proved it using O18
 pani se oxygen nikalne ko chlorilla naamak shaiwal main CO2 kii anupasthiti main dikhaaya gaya
 This means that oxygen can be produced in the absence of CO2, but it must have hydrogen content
 aisa dekha gaya he ki paudhon main enedipi do NADPH2 banaata he
 2H2O + 2NADP = 2NADPH2 + O2 aranan ke matanusaar prakaash kriya mukhya rup se nirmaan se sambandhit he
 NADPH2 / NADP is formed by degradation
 NADP ko TPN bhi kehete hai
 ATP is a light energy molecule formed by the joining of a phosphate group in ADP and this action is called phosphorylation
 edipi ke phosforilation main prakaash urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he atah ise photo-phosforilation bhi kehete hai
 It is also a complex process and according to Aranan the lighting process takes place in two processes
 ayugma photo-phosforilation tathaa yugma photo-phosforileshvyugma photo-phosforilation main pani ke apghaton ke kaaran electron nirantar praapt hote he tathaa photo-phosforilation kii kriya par chlorophyl main prakaash urja se atipi kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 Thus upon activation of chlorophyll 'a', ferredoxin acts as an electron receptor to give a coenzyme called NADP in which NAD is converted to NADPH2 by capturing hydrogen released by water
 is prakaar pani main vighatan main hue mukt electron chlorophyl ‘b’ ko uttejit kar ucch urja str par pahoonch jate hai tathaa ye electron phir kas prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ko praapt hote hai, purna rup se gyaat nahin he lekin aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki plastokavinon naamak electron grahi in electronon ko pakad letaa he jo cytochrome dwaara punah chlorophyl ‘a’ main pahunch jate hai
 It also produces ATP simultaneously
 yugma photo-phosforilation kii kriya main surya ke prakaash se chlorophyl ‘a’ sakriy hokar electron ko baahar kii ore phankta he jo chlorophyl main upasthit ferydoxin dwaara pakad liye jate hai
 This electron is liberated and is captured by an electron receptor called plastoquinone
 is kriya ke madhya main edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he tathaa electron punah mukt hokar cytochrome vikar se hokar chlorophyl ‘a’ main vaapis pahunch jaataa he
 In this action also, ADP is converted into ATP
 is kriya main bahari electron prayog nahin hota tathaa chlorophyl se electron nikalakar punah vahiin vaapis aa jaataa he
 In this way water is decomposed by paired and combustion processes, which liberates oxygen gas and is captured by hydrogen, hydrogen receptor NADP as well as energy classified which is used in chemical process or unpublished reaction
 
 oxigen tathaa prakaash-sanshleshan This process does not require light
 is prakriya main praayah carbondioxide kaa avkaran hota he
 In this process, the carbon dioxide absorbed by the stomata of the leaf, due to the energy of hydrogen light released from the water, forms a permanent liquid
 CH2O, yah ek carbohydrates kii ikai anu he
 Calvin and Banson reported using radioisotropic techniques that the first permanent compound in the photosynthesis process was a 3-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acid
 chlorolla evam sindesmas naamak shaiwalon main radio active C14O2 kii upasthiti main kuch samay ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan karaayaa gaya tathaa inamen bhi pehla sthai dravya phosphoglicerick amla bana
 This phosphoglyceric acid subsequently forms glucose
 is prakaar kelvin tathaa uske sahakarmiyon ke kaaryon se yah siddh ho gaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan prakriya main CO2 glucose main parivartit ho jaati he
 He used isotopes of carbon in this experiment
 chlorophyl main ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate upasthit rahata he
 Now atmospheric CO2 penetrates through the leaf stomata and enters immediately, forming a temporary compound with ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 is prakaar bana asthai yogic jo 5-carbon sugar he sheeghra hi phosphoglaicerick acid ke 2 anuon main tut jaataa he
 Now here, when hydrogen is released by NADPH2, it converts PGA to PGAL
 is kriya main urja atipi se praapt hoti he
 In this way CO2 creates carbohydrates
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii andheri prakriya main jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla banataa he unhen C3 paudha kehete hai
 Phosphoglyceric acid is a 3-carbon additive, hence these plants are named so
 jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic 4 carbon vaala yogic banataa he unako C4 paudha kehete hai
 The compound with 4 carbons is usually oxaloacetic acid
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide ke sthirikaran yaa yogikeekaran ke samay keval C3 yaa kelvin chakra hi hota tha arthath pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla hi banataa he
 But in 1966 Hatch and Slack pointed out that there is also a second path for the stabilization of carbon dioxide
 unhone ganna, makka, ameranthus aadi paudhon main adhyayan kar bataaya ki phosphoinol piruvik amla jo ki 3 carbon visisth yogic he carbondioxide se sanyukt hokar 4 carbon visisth yogic oxaloecetic amla banaata he
 In this activity, phosphoinol acts as a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme catalyst
 prakaash-sanshneshan kii kriya main chaar mukhya avyav hai, jal, carbondioxide, prakaash evam parn harim
 The presence of these four is very important for this action
 inamen se jal evam carbondioxide ko prakaash-sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kehete hai kyonki inke rachanaatmak avyavon dwaara hi prakaash-sanshleshan ke mukhya utpaada carbohydrate kii rachana hoti he
 The plant takes these ingredients from the environment around them
 carbondioxide prakaash-sanshleshan kaa ek mukhya avyav tathaa kaccha padaarth he
 Carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is released by the actions of respiration, combustion, fermentation, dissolution etc

 Terrestrial plants take it directly from the air
 in paudhon kii pattiyon main chote chhidr hote hai jinhe parnarandhra kehete hai
 Carbon dioxide enters the leaves of the plant from these same foliage
 jalmagn paudhe jal main ghuli carbondioxide ko apni shaareerik sataha se visaran dwaara grahan karte hai
 The sources of carbon dioxide in water are aquatic animals, whose gases are produced in respiration
 jal ke bheetar chattaanon main upasthit carbonate tathaa bicarbonate ke vighatan se bhi carbondioxide utpann hoti he jisko jaleey paudhe prakaash-sanshleshan main grahan karte hai
 Carbohydrates called glucose are formed in photosynthesis
 isamen carbon tathaa oxigen tatv ke parmaanu carbondioxide se hi praapt hote hai
 Chlorophyll Chlorophyll is a proteinated complex chemical compound
 yah prakaash-sanshleshan kaa mukhya varnak he
 There are two types of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b
 yah sabhi swaposhi hare paudhon ke chloroplast main paaya jaataa he
 Chlorophyll molecules absorb sunlight energy and convert it into chemical energy
 surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit karke chlorophyl kaa anu uttejit ho jate hai
 These active molecules decompose the water molecules into h + and oh-ions
 is prakaar chlorophyl ke anu prakaash-sanshleshan kii jaev-rasaynic kriya ko prarambh karte hai
 Light Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis
 balb aadi ke teevr kritrim prakaash main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti he
 This activity is most common in red light
 laal ke baad begni rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 Both these colors are absorbed by chlorophyll in the greatest amount
 hare rang ko chlorophyl puri tarah paravartit kar dete hai atah har rang ke prakaash main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya puri tarah ruuk jaati he
 Water is the raw material for photosynthesis
 sthaliy paudhe ise mitti se jad ke mulromon dwaara avashoshit karte hai
 Aquatic plants absorb water from the outer surface of their water contact parts
 orchid jaise upararohi paudhe apane viviya mulon dwaara vayumandaleey jalawaashp ko grahan karte hai
 Oxygen is produced by the optical breakdown of water in the optical reaction of photosynthesis
 yahi oxigen upapadaarth ke rup main vaataavaran main mukt hota he
 The molecules of hydrogen are obtained from water in the glucose molecules formed in the half reaction
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke samay jal apratyaksh rup se bhi kai kaary karata he
 It maintains activity of organisms and activation of enzymes
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya anek karkon dwaara prabhavit hoti he
 Some of its factors are external and some are internal
 iske atirikt kuch seemaabaddh kaarak bhi hote hai
 External causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in nature and environment, such as light, since the plant receives energy for this activity from sunlight and this action is not possible from darkness
 carbondai oxide, kyon ki aisa dekha gaya he ki yadi anya sabhi kaarak paudhe ko ucchtam maatra main praapt hon tathaa vayumandal main CO2 kii maatra dhire-dhire badhaai jaye to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar bhi bad jaati he
 Temperature, because it has been observed that a certain temperature is also required for photosynthesis in plants and water is very important for water photochemical processes and it supports many chemical changes during this process
 aantarik kaaran ve hote hai jo pattiyon main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai jaise- parnaharith yaa chlorophil jiske dwaara prakaash urja rasinic urja main parivartit hoti he
 Pruss / organism / protoplasm in which wickers are found affect the photosynthesis
 bhojya padaarth kaa jamaav, kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main bana bhojan yadi sthaneey koshikaon main ekatrit hota rahe to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar dhimi ho jaati he
 The internal structure of the leaves is because the rate of photosynthesis depends on the number of stomata or stomata present in the leaves and their closing and opening time
 pattiyon kii aayu, kyon ki nai pattiyon main puraani pattiyon kii apkshaa prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar adhik hoti he
 In addition, the photosynthesis also affects the different speeds of all these objects
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whatever is less than the appropriate amount of light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll etc
, it controls the speed of the whole action
 yah kaarak samay vishesh ke liye seemaabaddh kaarak kaha jaataa he

 Also, the committee has made some recommendations for how the anti-national acts of the Church should be dealt with in their recommendations

 The committee's first recommendation is that missionaries whose main purpose is only religious conversion, they should be asked to return
 desh ke bheetar videshi mishnariyon kaa bahu t sankhya main aana avaanchhneeya he or isaki roak tham honi chahie
 The committee, in its second recommendation, stated that the first route for the Indian Church is to establish a united Christian Church for India, which is not dependent on aid from abroad
 samiti ne apni report main kaha he ki aisi chikitsa sambandhi sevaaon tathaa va anya sevaaon ko, jo dharm parivartan ke kaary ke liye kom main laayi jaati hon use kanoon dwaara varjit kar di jaani chahie
 By assuring pressure, fraud, improper fear, financial or other kind of help, taking advantage of a person's need, mental debility and stupidity, the effort to convert should be stopped altogether
 samiti ne apane report main sarkaar se kaha he ki sarkaar kaa yah pratham kartabya he ki vah anathalayon kaa swayan sanchaalan kare kyonki jin naaballigon ke mata pita yaa sangrakshak nahin hai unki vaidhanik sangrakshak sarkaar hi he
 Whatever literature is for the promotion of religion should not be distributed without the permission of the government

 This committee in its report warned against the well-planned anti-indian work of the church

 What is the political purpose of the financial assistance they are giving from abroad, this should also be investigated

 The government should do this work as soon as possible, otherwise it may be too late

 Biogas is mostly preferred over fossil fuels
 kam maatra main carbon vaataavaran ke liye swasth hota he, lekin adhik hone par yah takalifdeh ban jaataa he
 Carbon has been present in fossil fuels for so long that it is no longer part of the carbon cycle
 jeevashm eendhan ke jalane par carbon kaa str badhata he
 Biogas is made from recent dead organisms, so it does not disturb the carbon level in the atmosphere
 byogas jeevashm eendhan ke bajaay isliye bhi behatar he kyonki yah sasta or naveekrut urja he
 It is beneficial for developing countries because it can be made in small plants, but some say that the fuel derived from crops will cause food shortages and will lead to forest erosion, water and soil pollution, or oil
 Producing countries will be negatively affected
 byogas plant main pashuon ke vyarth padaarth yaa energy crops ke upyog se byogas banaai jaati he
 Energy crops are grown for biofuels rather than food
 biophul biomas kahe jane vaale mrit organic tatwon se banaaya jaataa he or yah taral, gasiy yaa thos rup main ho saktaa he
 a biogas plant has a digester and a gas holder to manufacture fuel
 plant kaa digester airtite hota he jisamen vyarth padaarth daalaa jaataa he or gas holder main gas kaa sangrahan hota he
 The construction of a biogas plant depends on the gas requirement and the availability of waste material
 saath hi digester ke batch feeding yaa lagaataar feeding par bhi
 The biogas plant is built on or below the ground surface and both models have their advantages and disadvantages
 sataha par bana plant rakh-rakhaav main aasaan hota he or use suraj kii garmi se bhi laabh hota he, lekin iske nirmaan main adhik dhyaan dena hota he kyonki vahaan digester ke andruni dabaav par dhyaan dena hota he
 In contrast, plants below the surface are easy to construct but difficult to maintain
 bharat main maweshiyon kii sankhya vishwa main sarvaadhik he isliye byogas ke vikaas kii prachur sambhaavna he
 Biogas is obtained by producing microbes by driving the excretory substances of cattle into the digester at low temperatures
 jaev gas main 75 pratishat methen gas hoti he jo bina dhunaa utpann kiye jalati he
 Unlike wood, charcoal and coal, it does not leave any residue like ash after burning
 gramin ilaakon main bhojan pakaane tathaa eendhan ke rup main prakaash kii vyavastha karne main iskaa upyog ho rahaa he
 Two types of family or domestic and community plants are established under the National Biogas Development Program
 isse svachh va sasti urja aapurti tathaa gramin paryaavaran kii safai ke saath hi ucch koti kii carbonic khaad bhi prapti hoti he kyonki jaev gas ke liye prayukt gobar tathaa jal ke kardam main nitrogen va phosphorus prachur maatra main hote hai
 Caution should only be taken that there is no drinking water source within a 15 meter radius of the biogas plant
 bharat ke tarai evam maidani kshetron main gobar ko upalon ke rup main sukha kar eendhan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 This kills most of the nutritional elements present in dung
 upala banane main pratidin kareeb 1-2 ghante samay bhi lagata he
 Therefore, instead of using cow dung for cooking, making bio gas from cow dung, using bio gas as fuel does not harm the nutrients because all the nutrients available to the plants are available in the bio gas slurry obtained from bio gas
 While living, there is no smoke in cooking, which does not have any adverse effect on the eyes of the housewife
 baio gas slori ko sidhe yaa chaaya main sukhaakar yaa varmi compost banaakar khaad ke rup main kheton main prayog karnaa chahie
 Nowadays diesel pump sets can also be run with bio gas, which saves diesel and other energy
 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased
 byogas sanyantra se nikali patali slori main 20% nitrogen amo
 nikal nitrogen ke rup main hota he atah yadi iskaa turant upyog khet main naaliyaan banaakar athwa sinchai ke pani main milakar khet main chhod diya jaae to iskaa laabh rasinic khaad kii tarah se fasal par turant hota he or utpaadan main 10 se 20 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefits like chemical fertilizers are immediately on the crop and increase in production by 10 to 20%
 Can
 slori khaad ko sukhaane ke baad usamen nitrogen kaa kuch bhaag hawa main ud jaataa he
 This fertilizer is applied in non-irrigated farming in evidence of about 5 tonnes per hectare and in irrigated farming 10 tonnes per hectare
 byogas slori ke khaad main mukhya tatwon ke atirikt sookshm poshak tatv evam humas bhi hota he jisase mitti kaa pot sudharta he, jaldharan kshamta badhati he or sookshm jeevanu badhate he
 With the use of this manure, like other organic manure, nutrients are gradually available to the crops for 3 years
 yadi gobar gas sanyantr ghar ke paas va khet se dur he tab patali slori ko sangrahan karne ke liye bahut jagah lagati he va patali slori kaa sthaanantaran bhi kathin hota he aisi avasthaa main slori ko sookhaana aavashyak he
 For this, the method of Gramopayogi filtration tank has been developed
 isamen byogas ke nikaas kaksh se jodakar 2 ghanmeter ke sanyantra ke liye 1

 are added
 is par nikaas kaksh se jab drav rup kii slori girti he tab slori kaa pani kachare ke thar se chhan kar neeche gaddhe main ekatra ho jaataa he
 In this way, 2 / 3 of the water that is put into the biogas plant at the time of cow dung is collected and re-collected in the pits, mixing it with cow dung and re-pumping it to the plant increases gas production
 iske alaava isamen sabhi poshak tatv ghulansheel avasthaa main hote he atah paudhon par chhidkaav karne se paudhon kaa vikaas acha hota he, evam fal main vruddhi hoti he
 In about 15-20 days, the first tank is filled, then the tank is covered and the slurry is opened in the second tank, it can be stored separately in pits or it is easy to fill the bullock cart and reach the field
 filtreshan tanks kii madad se kam jagah main adhik byogas kii slori kaa sangrahan kiya ja saktaa he va filtard pani ke baahar nikalne va uskaa sanyantra main punah upyog karne se pani kii bhi bachat hoti he
 In this way, the biogas plant solves the problem of biogas fuel, as well as the best manure in the form of slurry is also obtained for agriculture

 The term traction has been used here for two different deeds: one for the shallow and repeated weeding or hoofing that is done for the purpose of weeding and the deep plowing that occurs every year This is done so that grass roots and roots etc
 are buried under the ground
 tarkari or phool kii kheti main saadhaarant: jotai kii badi aavashyaktaa rahati he
 In most places in India, it is not desirable to grow grass on the ground in fruit gardens and therefore a little bit of weeding becomes necessary
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki godai yaa khurpiyane kaa pradhan uddeshy avaanchit ghaas paat kaa nirmulan he, isliye yah tabhi karnaa chahie jab ve chote hon or unhone apni jaden gahari na jamaa lee hon
 This traction should be shallow so that roots of flowers, flowers or fruits are not damaged

 At the same time, the fruit horticulture must be plowed at least in the summer and once in the rainy season with a plowing plow
 jotai kis samay kii jaae, yah bhi kuch mahatvapurn he
 If plowing is done on more wet land, it can definitely harm the land
 halki mitti kii apeksha baari mitti main aisi haani adhik hoti he
 In general, plowing is the only good thing that should be done on sufficiently dry land, but the land is not so dry that big chippings will start to crumble
 falon ke udyaan or tarkari ke kheton main bina jote hi vishesh rasinic padaarthon ke chhidkaav se ghaas paat maar daalana bhi upyogi siddh hua he
 If the distance between the plants is right, then a lot of land will be lying in the new fruit garden, which will not be useful for the fruit trees for years
 is bhoomi main sheeghra utpann honevaale fal, jaise papeeta, yaa koi tarkari paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Different types of plants require so many different amounts of water that no comprehensive rules can be made for them
 kitna pani diya jaae or kab diya jaae, yah is par nirbhar he ki koun-sa paudha he or ritu kya he
 It is necessary to water potted plants in the dry season every day
 sabhi padpon ke liye bhoomi ko nirantar nam rahanaa chahie jisase unki baadh na ruke
 Continuous watering is required for proper growth of fruits also
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki bhoomi main nami maatra itani kam kabhi na ho ki paudhe murjhaa jaaen or phir punap na saken
 Good irrigation is the one in which the water is spoiled in minimum quantity
 yah kharabi kai kaarnon se ho sakati he : upree sataha par se pani ke bah jane se, anaavashyak gaharaai tak ghus jane se, upree sataha se bhaap banakar ud jane se tathaa ghaas-paat dwaara aavashyak pani khich jane se
 It is easy to irrigate the armpits of rows with rows of sidewalks

 Adding nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to the soil has been found to be useful for most crops, as these elements are extracted in varying amounts by various crops
 isliye yah dekhnaa aavashyak he ki bhoomi ke in tatwon kaa santulan paudhon kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar hi rahe
 Adding too much of one element can cause a decrease or imbalance in other elements, which can lead to a reduction in yield
 bhartiya bhoomi ke liye khaad ke sabase mahatvapurn ang nitrogen tathaa vanaspatik padaarth hai
 Remember that there is a difference between land and land; Therefore, there is no comprehensive recipe that can be used everywhere in this regard

 History of ancient Egypt By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of North Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the region's population to migrate to the shores of the Nile Valley and nomadic moderns from the late Middle Pleistocene about 120 thousand years ago
 Human hunters began living in the area, the Nile River has been the lifeline of Egypt ever since

 During the ancient empire, astounding developments were made in architecture, art and technology, which was boosted by increased agricultural productivity, possible by a fully developed central administration
 Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yields, recruited farmers to work on construction projects, and one to maintain peace and order Established the justice system
