 In film work, the original camera film is developed and copied into a one-light workprint for editing with a mechanical editing machine
 pikchar frem kii sthiti ko bataane ke liye film main ek ez code ko record kiya jaataa he
 Since the development of non-linear editing systems such as Avid or Final Cut Pro, film workflows have been used by some productions
 video varkelo main, mul camera negative ko viksit kiya jaataa he or computer editing software se sampadan karne ke liye use telesine kiya jaataa he
 a timecode is recorded in the video to locate the position of the picture frame
 is prakriya ke dauraan nirmaan dhwani ko bhi video pikchar frem ke saath-saath badhaayaa jaataa he
 The first job of a film editor is to produce a rough cut from sequins based on individual "text"
 raf cat kaa uddeshy sabase achche shot kaa chunaav karnaa or use kram main sajaana hota he
 The director usually works with the editor to ensure that the corresponding shots are selected
 aglaa kadam sabhi drishyon ke dwaara ek badhiya cat nirmit karnaa hota he taaki vah ek akhand kahani ke saath sahaj rup se pravaahit ho sake
 Trimming, a process of sorting scenes in seconds, or even frames, occurs during this phase
 fine cat ke chun liye jane ke baad or nirdeshak or nirmaataa dwaara anumodith hone ke baad film ko "taala band" kar diya jaataa he, jiskaa matlab yah hota he ki ab usamen koi parivartan nahin kiya jayega
 iske baad, sampadak swat: yaa haath se negative cat suchi yaa ek sampadan nirnay suchi banaata he
 These editing lists identify the source of each scene's picture frame in Fine Cut
 ek baar jab pikchar lock kar di jaati he to use sound trek banane ke liye dhwani-vibhaag ke postproduction dhwani paryvekshan sampadak ke haathon main saunp diya jaataa he
 The voice recordings are synchronized and the final sound mix is produced by the re-recording mixer
 dhwani mishran main samvaad, dhwani prabhaav, atomos, ediaar, valla, pholage or sangeet shaamil hai
 The sound track and picture are combined together and are the result of low quality answer prints in the film
 ab recording madhyam par nirbhar karte hue ucch gunvattta release print kaa nirmaan karne ke liye do sambhavit workelo hote hai: Finally the film is previewed by the target audience in general and further shooting and editing can be done based on the responses
 film ko ek saath rakhane ke do tareeke ho sakate hai
 One way is linear editing and the other is non-linear editing
 rekhiy sampadan film kaa upyog is tarah se karata he jaise yah ek satat film he
 All the parts of the film are already in order and there is no need to move them around
 iske vipareet, gaiyr rekhiy sampadan main tepe kiye gaye kram ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 Views can be rotated around or even removed
 yah antim charan he, jahaan film cinemagharon main relies kii jaati he yaa, kabhi-kabhi upabhokta madhyam main relies kii jaati he, yaa prowider se sidhe-sidhe downlod kii jaati he
 The film is duplicated according to the need of distribution in theaters
 press kit, poster or anya vigyaapan saamagree prakashit kii jaati he or film kaa prachaar kiya jaataa he
 Film companies usually release the film with a launch party, press release, interview with the press, press review screening and film festival screening
 adhikansh filmon kii ek website hoti he
 The film runs in selected theaters and dvds are usually released after a few months
 film or dividi ke vitaran kaa adhikaar bhi aam taur par duniya bhar main vitaran ke liye bechaa jaataa he
 The distributor and the production company share the profits
 film nirmaan mukhya dhara ke baahar bhi hota he or aamtaur par ise swatantra film nirmaan kaha jaataa he
 The means of production has become more republican since the introduction of DV technology
 film nirmaataa sambhavit rup se film ko shoot or sampadit kar sakate hai, dhwani or sangeet bana or sampadit kar sakate hai or apane ghar ke computer par antim cat ko mix kar sakate hai
 However, even if the means of production become republican, it is very difficult to move out of the traditional system due to investment, traditional distribution and marketing
 ateet main, adhiktar swatantra film nirmaataa apane film par dhyaan dilaane or vitaran ke liye bechney kii garaj se filmotsavon par bharosa karte the
 However, the Internet has provided a relatively inexpensive means of distribution of independent films
 parinamswaroop kai companiyon swatantra filmein dikhaane ke liye film nirmaataaon kii sahaayta main uth khadi hui hai or ve mukhya dhara ke internet bazaaron main use bechati hai, yahaan tak ki halliwood kii kai lokapriy filmon ko bhi
 digital swa vitaran ke saath, swatantra film nirmaataaon ke paas, jo ek paramparaagat vitaran sauda jutaney main vifal ho gaye the, vaishvik darshakon tak pahunchane kii kshamta he

 kancreet kii yah visheshta he ki yah pani milakar chhod dene ke baad dhire-dhire thos evam kathor ban jaataa he
 This process is called hydration
 is rasinic kriya main pani, cement ke saath kriya karke pathar jaisaa kathor padaarth banaati he jisamen anya chijen bandha jaatin hai
 Concrete is used in road construction, pipe construction, building construction, foundation building, bridge etc
 kancreet kaa upyog 2000 i
pus
 se hota aa rahaa he
 The properties of concrete depend on the material from which it is made, but mainly they depend on the material used to interchange the stone, ballast, etc
 19veen shatabdi main portland cement ke avishkaar ke paley is kaam ke liye keval chuunaa uplabdh tha, parantu ab chooney ke kancreet kaa upyog keval vahiin hota he jahaan adhik pushtataa kii aavashyata nahin rahati
 Cement-concrete is used for greater confirmation
 cement kancreet ko ispaat se drudh karke un sthanon main bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa hai jahaan lapane yaa mudne kii sambhaavna rahati he, jaise dharanon athwa stambhon main
 Concrete is a mixture of the following substances: koi akriyasheel padaarth, jaise tutaa pathar yaa eent, badi bajri, chai athwa mashin se niklaa jhaavaan; Sand or sawdust or ground brick; purvonkt padaarthon ke jodne ke liye kaai padaarth, jaise cement athwa chuunaa or Water as required
 is mishran ko jab acchhee tarah mila diya jaataa he or keval itnaa dhilaa rakhaa jaataa he ki gadde yaa saanche ke kone-kone tak pahanch sake tab yah kisi bhi akruti ke gadde athwa khokhale sthaan main, jaise neenv kii athwa mehrab kii bagal main, bharaa ja saktaa he
 It is made of cement, water, sand and stone or brick ballast or large gravel or bark and is more useful in building construction
 jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he, jab yah padaarth bhalee-bhanti mila die jate hai tab unase kumhaar kii mitti kii tarah plastic padaarth banataa he, jo dhire-dhire pathar kii tarah kadaa ho jaataa he
 This artificial stone is of the nature of a stone called Conglomerate found in nature
 bhavannirmaan main cement kancreet ke is gun ke karan yah badi sugamawa se kisi bhi sthaan main dhaala ja saktaa he or isko koi bhi vaanchit rup diya ja saktaa he
 For this, the materials required are usually available in all places, but for best results, the work of mixing and molding the concrete should be entrusted to the trained laborers
 kancreet kii pushtataa uske avyavon ke anupaat or unako milaane ke dhang par nirbhar rahati he
 It can often have a myriad of uses in engineering and building construction, including large buildings, walls, naval reefs, sea walls to protect against waves, large structures such as bridges, protrusions, etc
 ispaat se prabalit kancreet ke rup main yah anek anya sanrachanaon ke liye prayukt hota he, jaise farsh, chat, mehrab, pani kii tankiyan, attalikaay, pul ke bade peepe, ghat, naram bhoomi main neenv ke neeche thoke janevo khunte, jahaajon ke liye samudri ghat, tathaa anek anya rachanaayen
 Durability, athleticity, beauty, tolerance to fire, cheapness, etc
 are qualities that cause concrete to become more and more popular in building and due to which many other materials used in building construction are being removed
 baaluu pathar yaa eent ke chote-chote tukdon ko gitti kehete hai
 Large gravel etc
 can also be used instead of ballast, so we will consider them under ballast here too
 gitti or baaluu donon ke sammilit rup ko abhisamooh kehete hai
 There are the following classes of ballast according to the size: daanvi, jab naap 7
5 se 15 centimetre tak hoti he; Ballast thick, from 0
5 to 7
5 cm; maheen, 0
15 se 5 millimetre tak 
 The "fineness modulus" is used to measure the ballast
 naapane ke liye das pramanik chalaniyaan rahati hai jinaki jaali kii naap nimnlikhit hoti he : 3 inch, 1 inch, 0
5 inch, 0
3 inch, 2
41 millimeter, 1
204 millimeter, 0
599 millimeter, 0
152 millimeter
 2
41 millimetrewali chalani ko number 7 chalani tathaa uske baad kii chalaniyon kaa krmanusaar number 14, number 25 number 52 or number 100 bhi kehete hai
 In order to obtain the fineness modulus, the goods move sequentially through these sieves
 maal kii taul ke anusaar in chalaniyon par jitna pratishat bachaa rah jaataa he unke yogafal ko 100 se bhaag de diya jaataa he
 The gain obtained in this way is called precision modulus
 kancreet ke liye sookshm milaave kaa sookshmata mapank 2 or 3 ke bich hona chahie or mote milaave kaa 5 or 8 ke bich
 90 percent of the micro-mixture must pass through the inch inch mesh and the 100-number mesh should not be less than 85 percent
 sookshm milaave ke liye nadi yaa samudr kii baaluu, athwa pathar kii khan se niklaa chura piskar prayukt kiya jaataa he
 According to soil, sediment and dust in natural or ground gravel should not be more than 3 percent and powdered stone should not have more than 10 percent dust etc
 baaluu aadi ko ghaas paat aadi pranij ashuddhiyon se mukt hona chahie
 At least 95 percent of the thick adulteration should be passed through a 3-inch sieve and at least 90 percent should be lying on an inch sieve
 todaa gaya pathar, todi gai eent, chur kiya gaya pathar, jhaavaan athwa chai, ye sab mote milaave ke liye kaam main laai ja sakati he
 Chhai and coke are useful for light concrete, but for heavy and athletic work, limestone, granite, fine, trap or hard sandstone are used
 chipkaanewaale padaarth se kamjor padanevaale naram pathar kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 The ballast should be somewhat spherical, safe, do not leave it chipped and it is strong to break
 taul ke anusaar gitti paanch pratishat se adhik pani sokhe
 It should not have as much soil and no natural substances as possible
 yon to kaary or aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kai prakaar ke cementon kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he, parantu saadhaaran kaam ke liye adhiktar portland cement kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 It is mainly a mixture of tricellium silicate, dicalsium silicate, tricalcium aluminate and gypsum
 pani milaane ke baad sabase pehle pushtataa alumineton or tricalsium silicket se aati he, kyonki pani kaa shoshan karte samay unke kaaran adhik garmi utpann hoti he
 Cement should be kept in a dry place before use, otherwise the moisture will spoil the cement
 nam sthaan main rakhane se jo cement kadaa ho jaataa he vah kisi kaam kaa nahin rahata
 Sometimes, when the cement sacks are laden to a great height on top of one, the cement at the bottom also binds due to high pressure, but this cement does not deteriorate and easily mixes with other substances when forming concrete
 kadaa hone kaa praarambhik samay 30 minute se kam nahin hona chahie
 The concrete should be molded in its place within 30 minutes after kneading
 kadaa hone kaa antim samay 10 ghante se kam na hona chahie
 Pressure on exam after seven days and pani svachh ho, usamen pranij padaarth, amla, kshar or koi bhi anya hanikaarak padaarth na hona chahie
 In short, water that is potable is also capable of making concrete
 kancreet banane main vividh padaarthon ko thik-thik naapnaa bahut mahatvapurn he
 When materials are measured and mixed according to volume, the size of the measuring vessel becomes small and the difference in the final measurement also affects the final measurement
 phir, milaave kii kism or uski ardrata kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he
 The volume increases by about 25 percent when the fine mixture is 3
5 percent humidity
 milaava jitna hi adhik maheen hoga, ardata se aaytan utana hi adhik badhegaa
 Therefore, weights should be mixed in good work
 parantu saadhaarant: nirmaan kaaryon main padaarthon kii naap aaytan se hoti he
 Therefore, it is very important to keep in mind all the things from which the volume decreases
 cement kii prayek bori ke liye aavashyak pani kii maatra saadhaarant: galenon main bataai jaati he
 The drivability is estimated by the time it takes for the concrete to be milled, molded, and shredded after grinding
 sukarta jal kii maatra, gitti kii naap or mote tathaa maheen milaave ke anupaat par nirbhar rahati he
 Increasing water and fine mixing increases dryness
 sukarta naapane kii kai reetiyaan hai parantu adhik upyog avpaat reeti kaa hi hota he
 This method is described below
 taaja bane kancreet ko pendi rahit baaltee main daalate hai jisaki akruti shanku ke chhinnak kii bhanti hoti he
 The top diameter is 5 inches and the bottom is 8 inches and the height is 12 inches
 kancreet ko is bartan main bharkar kootane ke baad, baratan ko uthaa liya jaataa he
 Then the concrete settles down
 kancreet kaa maathaa jitne neeche dhansata he utana hi avpaat kehalaata he
 The higher the degradation, the greater the dryness
 sadak banane ke liye 1 inch ke kancreet kaa avpaat thik rahata he
 The ceiling should be 1 inch to 2 inches in the roof, joins etc
 khambhon or un patali deevaaron ke liye jo kamaron ko do yaa adhik khandon main baantne ke liye khadi kii jaati hai, avpaat ko 4 inch tak badhanaa padataa he, jisamen kancreet falkar sab jagah pahunch jaae or kahin polapan na rah jaae
 The strength of the concrete depends on the properties of the cement, the ratio of water and cement and the amount of density
 yadi cement vahi rahe or gitti tathaa baaluu is prakaar se vividh naapon ke rahen ki purna saghanta praapt ho to kancreet kii pushtataa jal or cement ke anupaat par nirbhar rahegi
 By increasing the ratio of water and cement, that is, adding more water, the confirmation decreases, but remember that the amount of water cannot be reduced below a certain limit
 rasinic kriya puri hone ke liye jal kii maatra cement kii maatra kii kam se kam 0
25 honi chahie, parantu sukarta ke liye or kancreet ko kootakar saghan bana sakane ke liye isse adhik pani kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 a mixture made by mixing water in a ratio of less than 0
35 is often so scrappy that it cannot be used
 kancreet kaa tikaaupan pradhanat: uski saghanta par nirbhar rahata he
 The less the stomata remain in the concrete, the less alkaline water or other harmful substances dissolve in it, so the less decay it gets
 saghanta praapt karne ke liye yathasambhav kam pani daalana chahie or gitti ke rodon kii naap tathaa baaluu kaa prakaar or uski maatra aisi honi chahie ki kancreet main rikt sthaan na chhootane paae
 For austerity or cheapness, it is necessary that the cement should be kept to a minimum and the labor in mixing, molding and grinding should be minimized
 etdarth iskaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki aavashyak sukarta ke liye jitna nunatam jal apekshit ho usase adhik na choda jaae
 Considering all these things, it is clear that we should first choose such a water-cement-ratio to get the required confirmation and then keep the ingredients of fine and coarse adulteration in such a proportion that it has minimum amount for good dryness and full density a mixture of water and cement has to be added
 purna saghanta kaa arth yah he ki milaave ke kanon ke bich ke samast rikt sthaan jal-cement-mishran se bhar uthen or vaayu ke bulbule kahin na rahen
 It is very important to mix different ingredients of adulteration in the appropriate proportion according to the size
 isse keval pushtataa hi nahin badhati, sukarta bhi badhati he
 Properly graded ballast-sand contains particles of all sizes such that the spaces between larger particles are filled with smaller particles, etc
 yadi aisan hua to sab rikt sthanon ko jal-cement-mishran se bharna padegaa
 Therefore, the ballast and sand of the adulteration for the extreme compaction of the concrete are graded in such a way that there is minimum spacing in the mill
 kuch mahatvapurn kaamon main sastepan ke liye antar-shreneekaran kii reeti barti jaati he
 It does not include adulteration of gravel from British Standard number to sieve of 7
 saadhaarant: kancreet kaa mishran cement, baaluu or gitti ke aaytanon ke anupaat ke anusaar taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the number of sacks is stated to indicate the quantity of cement
 prayek bori main 112 pound yaa 1
25 ghan foot cement rahata he
 Thus a concrete mixture of 1: 2: 4 means 1 cubic foot of cement, 2 cubic sand and 4 cubic feet of ballast
 mishran main ausat se 66% se 78% milaava 7% se 14% cement or 15% se 22% pani hota he
 Thus for some 100 cubic feet of finished concrete, about 155 cubic feet of dry matter is required
 yah mahatvapurn he ki sab padaarth acchhee tarah mil jaaen jisamen sarvatra ek samaan kii sanrachana rahe
 Whenever more concrete is required, it is difficult to mix by hand, so a machine is used
 aisi mashin main ek bada sa dhol rahata he jiske bheetar pankhe lage rahete hai
 The drum is rotated by the engine and is injected with cement, sand, ballast and water
 sheeghra hi acha mishran taiyaar ho jaataa he
 Concrete should be flattened and compacted after mixing is ready
 pani daalane ke kshan se is kriya ke ant tak kul 30 minute se kam samay laganaa chahie
 Also, it should be kept in mind that no part of the concrete mixture should be partially separated while casting
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki kancreet bahut unche se nahin giraaya janaa chahie
 Concrete cutting should be done with iron rods and in this process the rods should be penetrated into the concrete for some distance
 jab mishran itnaa sookhaa rahata he ki is vidhi kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa to compankaaree yantron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jisamen puri saghanta aa sake
 For flat surfaces vibrators are used which are placed above the surface, but vibrators are used for concrete to be placed within the concrete for pickets and walls
 kintu yadi kancreet ke bheetar compankaaree ko daalane kii suvidha bhi na ho to aise bahari compankariyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo saanche ko hilaate hai or is prakaar kancreet saghan ho jaataa he
 a low mat is harmful, but an excess of mat or vibration can also be harmful, because it causes the separation of the concrete components and there is a possibility of forming spaces like a beehive
 at: yah chetavanee dena uchit he ki purna saghanta ke badale keval 85 pratishat saghanta utpann kii jaae to pushtataa purna saghan kancreet kii kul 15 pratishat hi utpann hogi
 As long as the concrete hardens, it should be kept humid
 is kriya ko paripakvikaran kehete hai
 It is very important that in the process of hardening, the amount of water required for chemical addition of cement should be kept
 yadi kancreet ko thik prakaar se paripakv na kiya jaae to pushtataa bahut kam ho jaati he
 Most of the concrete's concrete is produced in two to three weeks, so it is necessary to keep it moist for that long
 yadi is samay main kancreet sookhe vaataavaran main rahata he to usamen adhik sankoch ho jaataa he or parinamat: vah fat jaataa he
 If the heat is high then the concrete is confirmed in a short time
 isliye jaade kii apeksha garmi ke dinon main saanchaa kam samay main hataaya ja saktaa he
 If the concrete continues to mature very quickly, the concrete is heated by steam
 bahudhaa sadak banane main aisa karnaa padataa he, kyonki sadakon ke do teen saptaah tak band rakhane main asuvidha hoti he
 The following table shows the concrete of various structures and their properties: 28 din baad sampeden kshamta, mishran pound prati varg inch, prayog 1: 2: 4 2,250 in reinforced work
 1 : 1 : 3 2,850 mehrab, stambh, pani kii tankiyon or pani ke anya kaamon main
 1: 1: 2 3,450 pre-reinforced concrete and in structures where special reinforcement is required
 jo kancreet prabalit nahin rahata use sada kancreet kehete hai
 Cement concrete of 1: 3: 6 is usually given in the foundation of normal load walls
 yadi bhoomi kadi ho to khambhon kii nivon main bhi aisa hi kancreet diya ja saktaa he
 Under stress such concrete is not very strong and when there is a possibility of tension in some part, it is necessary to reinforce it with steel rods
 jab bahut bade aaytanwala, kancreet kaa koi kaam banataa he, jaise udrodh, pushta, baari kaam honevaale kaarkaane kaa farsh, ityadi tab subhite ke liye use vipul kancreet kaha jaataa he
 Whenever a lot of concrete is molded together, large heat is produced by the adsorption of cement
 peeche jab kancreet thanda hota tab bhitari tanaav bahut ho jaataa he or kancreet chatkh jaataa he
 Therefore, ballast and sand are pre-cooled in making uprostrum etc
 and taps are placed in concrete, in which cold water is flowed
 isse taap badhane nahin paata
 Large-scale ballast is used for mass concrete that is up to 6 inches in diameter
 isse pani kam kharch hota he or yadi jal-cement-anupaat na badla jaae to cement bhi kam kharch hota he
 This results in savings
 saath hi, kancreet kaa ghanatv bhi bad jaataa he
 This is important for gravity resistance and large tank floors, as they rely on their own weight for their stability

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is the cause of self and world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc

 These are different forms and powers of one God

 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but they are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 One of the initial concerns of the expanding station was that the army would claim their property
 Due to their facilities in the form of ferries, cranes, emission wells and coal supplies, many requests were made by the army for their use
 farvari 1901 tak, sena ne nausena godi par koyala or anya dukaanon ko sanbhaalane ke liye chal crinen sthapit karne ke visheshadhikaar, ek salaami bydaree or nausena aarakshan par ek dhvaj-dand or saath hi ek swayan ke utsrut coop ke liye aavedan kiya
 All these requests were denied by the Bureau of Equipment based on the principle that, once approved, they would "in fact permanently pawn over this property and eventually split it between the two departments, or We will do a complete boycott of the Navy Department based on the military justification established by the frequency of use
 " However, the Army Depot Quartermaster in Honolulu contracted to sink an emissive well at the Naval Station upon the Commandant's approval, and that Commandant in turn acted on the recommendation of the Bureau of Yards and Docks

 The Bureau of Equipment felt that it was pertinent to be careful when the Depot Quartermaster made it known to her in 1902 that any water used by the Navy from the wellhead was "given only courtesy of the Army
" " Despite the warnings from the Bureau of Equipment, the War Department, the Department of Labor and Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture had obtained permission to pay on the Naval Reservation
 1906 tak, commandent kaa maananaa tha ki stesan ke bhavishya par ek niti viksit karnaa beuro of yards and dox ke liye jaruri tha

 In 1903, the Department of Labor and Commerce received about 7 acres for an immigration station
 Received Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture acquired a portion of the site destined for the hospital for an experimental station

 "on the other hand," he wrote, "if it is intended to improve Pearl Harbor and eventually abandon this station, then every effort should be made to start work there as soon as possible 


 i am told That significant commercial interest will make a strong effort to improve Pearl Harbor next year and i think it would be a good time for the Navy Department to try in that same direction
 
 " 1908 main, parl harbar nausena shipyard sthapit kiya gaya
 The period 1908–1919 was a period of steady and continuous growth for the Naval Station, Pearl Harbor, with the exception being only 1913 when the drydock demolished discouraged

 udhaaharan ke liye 32 kaa ardhachchhed 5 he jo bataata he ki 32 ko baar-baar aadha karen to 5-baar main 1 aa jaataa he
 Similarly, the triad of 81 is 4 because if 81 is repeated thirds, then 1 comes in 4 times

 The development of simple logarithms is the result of the combined effort of John Napier and Henry Brig

 If r is the radius of the circle, Brig suggested that the smaller r = 0 and the smaller = 1010
 nepier ke anusaar laghu 1 = 0, laghu r = 1010
 After some time, the behavior of short 10 = 1 started in place of short su = 1010

 In many places in the Hebrew Bible, there is a mention of an animal called ream which is often presented as a metaphor representing power
 shaktishaalee sing yaa singon vaale mahaan shakti evam furti ke swami or paaltu na banaae jane yogya ek junglee pashu ke rup main ream ke prasang-sanket, orokes ke saath kaaphi mail khate hai
 This view has received the support of the Assyrian Rimu, often used as a metaphor for power and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns
 is pashu ko praayah pracheen mesopotamian kala kii ruparekha main darshaya jaataa tha jisamen keval ek hi sing drashtavy tha
 Translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible followed the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate and translated the ream as a unicorn and presented it as an identifiable animal that was characterized by its nature as an animal that could not be domesticated It was very famous because of it
 american standard varshan har maamle main is sangya "junglee bail" kaa roopantaran karata he
 The unicorns are not mentioned in Greek mythology but are mentioned in details in natural history because the Greek author of the replicated history was convinced of the reality of the unicorn which he had found in India, which was a remote and excellent field for him

 Aristotle may have followed Ctesias when referring to two horned animals - oryx and the so-called "indian donkey"
 strabo kehete hai ki kakeshas main ek sing vaale ghode paae jate the jinke sir mrug kii tarah hote the
 Pliny mentions the Elder oryx and an Indian bull as a horned animal, as well as "an overbearing animal called monocerus, whose head is like an antelope, legs are elephant-like, and tails are like bears
" While the rest of the body is like a horse; it makes a loud sound like a bull and has only a black horn, protruding from the middle of its forehead and whose long Dry the two hands as

 Although a creature called Qilin is sometimes called the "chinese unicorn" in Chinese mythology, it is a hybrid animal that looks slightly less like a unicorn than a chimer whose body is like an antelope and the head of a lion
 Is like and has green skin and has a horn which is long and folded forward

 Compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus, the earlier work of the medieval bestiary popularized an elaborate parable depicting a unicorn incarnated by a young woman
 jaisi vah iksingha use dekhtaa he, vah apane sir ko uski god main rakh detaa he or so jaataa he
 It became a basic emblematic tag that is the basis of the medieval ideas of the unicorn which justified its form as a direct form of religious art
 iksinge ke myth kii vyakhyaaon se dhokhaa khaane vaale premiyon / premicaon kii madhyakaalin shiksha par prakaash padataa he, jabaki kuch dharmik lekhak is iksinge or isaki maut kii vyakhya pishan of christ ke rup main karte hai
 These myths mention an animal with a horn that can be domesticated only by a virgin girl; Later, some writers interpreted this as a parable of Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary

 The story of a unicable domesticated only by a virgin girl was well established in medieval lore when Marco Polo described them as follows: ve haathiyon se shaayad hi chote hai
 Their hair is like a buffalo and the feet are like an elephant

 Their head is like a wild boar

 In his pseudodoxia epidemica by Sir Thomas Browne in the seventeenth century, the unicorn horn may have had the ability to neutralize venom, based on the popular belief that had been tested intelligently and elaborately
 isliye, jin logon ko zehar kaa dar hota tha, ve kabhi-kabhi "iksinge kii sing" se bane pyaalon se apana peya piya karte the
 The price of "unicorn" products, such as milk, skins, and offal, has also increased due to alleged aphrodisiac properties and other so-called medicinal properties
 iksingon ke bare main yah bhi kaha jaataa tha ki ye is baat kaa nirdhaaran karne main sakasham the ki ek mahila kunvaari he yaa nahin; kuch kahaniyon ke anusaar un par keval kunvaari kanyaayein hi chadh sakati thi
 As a traditional method of hunting unicorns, it was implicated by a virgin girl
 leonardo da vinci ne apni ek notebook main likhaa he: The unicorn is very incoherent and does not even know how to control himself, but because of the love he has for the beautiful virgins in his heart, it forgets its cruelty and wildness; And putting all your fears aside, it will go to a sitting young man and sleep on his lap and thus the hunters catch it

 They probably bring this animal to the bay with the help of a virgin girl who kills it with her beauty, to kill and take it to the palace; In the final and most famous panel, "the Unicorn in Captivity", the unicorn is once again shown alive and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence in a field of flowers

 takneekee taur par sabhi plastic jaev avakramit hote hai, jiskaa matlab ye he ki ve upyukt paristhitiyaan milane par rogaanuon dwaara avakramit kiye ja sakate hai
 However, most are so slow degraded that they appear to be non-biodegradable
 kuch shail-rasayan aadhaarit plastic ko jaev affvakramit mana jaataa he or kai vyapaarik jaev plastic ke pradarshan ko unnat karne main ise yojya ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Non-biodegradable bioplastics are considered sustainable
 jaev avakraman kii raftaar taapmaana, polimar kii sthirataa or oxigen kii uplabdh maatra ke mutabik badalati rahati he
 As a result, most bioplastics are degraded only under the strict controlled conditions of the vegetable manure unit of the industrial units
 vanaspatik khaad ke dher yaa mitti / pani main zyaadaatar jaev plastic avakramit nahin hote hai, haalanki starch aadhaarit jaev plastic ke saath aisa nahin he
 An internationally accepted standard, EN 13432, defines how quickly and to what extent plastic degrades in the presence of commercial manure, so that it can be called biodegradable
 ise antarrashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan dwaara prakashit kiya gaya he or puraa europe, america or japan samet kai deshon main manyata praapt he
 However it is designed only for aggressive conditions of commercial manure units
 vahaan vanaspatik khaad avasthaa ko rakhane ke liye koi maanak lagu nahin he
 The term 'biodegradable plastic' is also often used by producers of specially processed shell-chemical based plastics that appear to be degraded
 poliethilin jaise paaramparik plastic oxigen or para-bangnee kirnon se avakramit ho jate hai
 Producers use stabilizing chemicals to stop this process
 haalanki plastic ke saath avakraman ko prerit karne vaale ko jod die jane se niyantrit para-bangnee / oxikaran vighatan prakriya sambhav ho sakati he
 This type of plastic can be called degradable plastic or oxidized plastic or photo-degraded plastic because the microbial action here does not initiate the process
 haalanki kuch avakramanit plastic nirmaataaon kaa tark he ki avakramit plastic avasheshon par rogaanuon dwaara hamalaa kiya jayega, ye avakramit saamagree ien13432 ke vanijyik vanaspatik khaad maanak kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte
jaev plastic udyog vyapak rup se oxi-jaev avakramit plastic kii aalochana karata he, jiske bare main udyog sangh kaa kahana he ki vah apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte hai
 Oxo-biodegradable plastics, known as oxos, are traditional petroleum-based products with some additives that initiate degradation
 oxo nirmaataaon dwaara jis eestm maanak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah sirf ek dishanirdesh he
 It requires only 60 per cent biodegradation, p-life is an oxo plastic which claims to have reached 66 per cent degradation after 545 days at 23 ° c temperature in the soil
 neshnal innovations agency ke dow bailatus ne kaha ki aisa koi pramaan nahin he jisase sabit ho ki jaev-avyavi sachmuch main oxo plastic kii khapat or avakraman karne main sakasham he
 There are also concerns that bioplastic may damage existing recycling projects
 doodh kii echdieepi botalon or pani tathaa sheethal peya kii piiti botalon jaisi packaging kii badi aasaani se pahchaan kii ja sakati he or yahi vajah he ki duniya ke kai hisson main ricycling ke buniyadi dhaanche kii sthapana kii dharna kaamyaab rahi hai
 However, like PET, plastic is not available with PLA, if the customer is unable to differentiate between the two, then recycled PET will be used
 The solution to this problem can be ascertained by finding the specific type of bottle by investing on the appropriate sorting technology
 haalanki, pehla tarika bharosemand nahin he or doosraa kaaphi mahangaa
 It is difficult to estimate the overall size of the bioplastics market due to market fragmentation and a hitherto unresolved definition, but according to one estimate it consumed around 85,000 tonnes worldwide in 2006

 phir bhi, jaev plastic kul plastic bazaar kaa ek chota sa hi hissaa hoga, jiske ki saal 2010 tak vaishvik str par 500 billian ton tak pahunchane kii bhavishyavaanee he
 Most bioplastics technology, except cellulose, is relatively new and currently higher in price than shell-plastic
 jaev plastic apane utpaadan ke liye jeevashm eendhan se praapt urja par ab tak jeevashm eendhan ke samaan nahin pahunch sakaa he, jisase petroleum aadhaarit plastic ke mukaable laagat main kami karne kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa
 However, in some cases bioplastics with special applications are already unbeatable as their net material cost is only a part of the cost of the entire product
 udhaaharan ke taur par, sharir main ghul jane vaala piele se bana chikitsakeey implants marij ko ek duusare oparation se bachaata he
 Often, polymers made from starch are not collected after compostable mulch film is used for agriculture and is left on the field
 audyogic maanak ien 13432 sambhaavna or anupaalan ke maamle main sabase zyada antarrashtriya he jiske saath ye daawa kiya jaataa he ki ye utpaada europea bazaar main vanaspatik khaad jaisaa he
 In a nutshell, according to this standard, 90 percent of the material in a commercial botanical fertilizer unit should be biodegraded within 180 days

 The ASTM D6866 process has been developed to validate biologically obtained bioplastic materials
 brahmadia kirnon kaa vaataavaran ke saath takaraane kaa matlab he ki kuch carbon radiodharmee samasthanik carbon-14 hai
 Plants use CO2 in the atmosphere for photosynthesis, so new plant material will have both carbon-14 and carbon-12
 sahi paristhitiyon or bhuvaigyanik samaymapkram ke tahat jeevon ke avshesh jeevashm eendhan ke rup main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he
 After one million years, all the carbon-14 present in the original bio-material will be radioactive and only carbon-12 will be left
 a product made from biofuels contains a relatively high amount of carbon-14, while a product made of rock chemistry does not contain any carbon-14

 Despite all this, bioplastic such as HDPE plays an important role in greenhouse reduction, especially when used in energy production
 in jaevplastic ke jaev aadhaarit ghatakon ko carbon tatasth mana jaataa he kyonki unka mul jaev eendhan se he
 ASTM D5511-02 and ASTM D5526 are testing methods that comply with international standards such as ISO DIS 15985
 sonda, sobodiya yaa sobodiana madhya asia main sthit ek pracheen sabhyataa thi
 It was spread in the areas of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khujand and shahar-e-sabz in modern Uzbekistan
 sonda ke log ek soudai naamak bhashaa bolte the jo purvi irani bhashaa thi or samay ke saath vilupt ho gai
 It is believed that many of the modern-day Tajik, Pashtun and Yagnobi people are descendants of these Sogdai people
 dhyaan dijiye kii 'sonda' main 'ga' kaa uccharan 'ga' se thodaa alag he
 The people of Sogda were considered freedom-loving and militant and their nation was situated between the Hakhamani kingdom of Iran and the Shakas
 jab 327 isapurv main sikandar mahaan ke netritv main unani senaayen yahan pahaunchi to unhone yahan ke prasiddh soudai shila naamak qile par qabza jamaa liya
 They merged Bactria and Sogda into a single state

 In 150 BCE, the Shakas and other Banjara castes invaded and settled in the region and their reign began here again
 china bhi is ilaake par aankhe gadhe hue tha
 It was considered part of the western region and Chinese explorers gave Sogda the name "kangju"
 36 ipu main china ne is ilaake par akraman kiya
 From this region, trade between China and the regions of the west started increasing again
 sonda resham maarg par aa gaya or soudai log jor-shor se vyapaar main lag gaye
 Sogdai language became the language of trade in Central Asia and many non-sogdai also started learning and speaking it
 sambhav he ki is samay ke china or bharat ke bich ke vyapaar kaa adhikansh bhaag soudai log hi chalate the
 Some historians believe that over time there was a considerable moral decline in Sogda and women were sold and sold in Kucha and Khotan
