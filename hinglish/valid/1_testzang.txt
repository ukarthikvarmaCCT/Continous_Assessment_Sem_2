 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift

 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher

 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 Like the recent years, in the summer of 2018, forest fire cases have come up in many places in Uttarakhand state of North India
 tehri se lekar uttarkashi or bageshwar tak ke pahaad or van bheeshan aag se jujh rahe hai
 The worst affected by the fire was Pauri Garhwal district, where about 1000 hectares of forest land has been hit by fire
 uttrakhand van vibhaag ke mutabik unhen 15 farvari se 21 may tak kul 741 aisi ghatnaon kii soochna mili thi, jisamen 1213
766 hectare van kshetra 21 lakh rupee se zyada kaa rajasav nuksaan hua he
 Cases of fire in the forests of Uttarakhand are not new or unexpected
 1911, 1921, 1930, 1931, 1939, 1945, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1964, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1972 or 1995 main aag lagane ke pramukh haadason kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the recent past, only in 2016, there were 1857 cases of severe fire in the forests across the state, in which about 4048 hectares of forest area spread over 11 districts were burned
 kumaun mandal ke almoda-bageshwar kshetra main visheshkar kai ghatnaayen saamne aayi thi, or yahan lagi aag bujhane ke liye rashtriya aapadaa anukriya bal ko tainaat kiya gaya tha, jinhone bhartiya vaayu sena ke emai 17 helicopteron dwaara nainital or bhimtal se pani laakar jalvarsha kar is aag par niyantran paaya tha
 In 2017 too, there were many cases of forest fires
 graminon kaa maananaa he ki jangal kii aag graminon ke jaankaree ke abhaav ke kaaran bhi lag rahi he
 Some people throw burning beedis and cigarettes while walking in the woods, which causes a fire and spreads later
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki pehali aag uttarkashi, bageshwar, almoda, tehri, haridwar, nainital, uttarkashi or paudi ke jangalon main lagi
 Only 69
71 hectares of forest area was burnt in the events of May 19 and 20
 65 jagah fire alert bhi jari kiye gayi the, jinamein se 26 sthanon par aag lagi pai gai
 After this, a statewide high alert was declared, and the leave of all forest workers was canceled

 surveykshan patt yaa 'plane tebul' surveykshan main upyogi ek upkaran he
 The survey board provides a solid plane on which drawings, charts and maps are made
 planetebul surveykshan surveykshan kii badi anokhi vidhi he
 In most other methods of surveying, the points on the surface of the Earth are measured, calculated and plotted separately

 Due to these attractive properties this method is widely used in all countries
 is kaary main nimnlikhit upkaran prayukt hote hai
 Planetbull or board, tripod, sight-line, spirit label, and telemetry and magnetic compass
 planetebul banane ke liye bhalee prakaar mausam ke prabhaav se paki lakdi 12 se 15 semi
 chaudee or do se teen senmi
 moti pattiyon ko bhalee prakaar jodakar 75 x 60 yaa 60 x 50 varg senmi

 One of its surface is well flattened and peeled off
 duusari ore planetebul ke centre par dhaatu kii ek chakti laga di jaati he, jisamen tipai par kasne ke liye chudiyaan kati rahati hai
 In the tripod, three legs are attached to the head by screws
 pech deele karke pair khiskaae ja sakate hai or tipai kaa sir ekadam kshaitij kiya ja saktaa he
 a plantebul can be placed in a hole in the center of the head of the tripod
 pairon ko khiskaakar planetebul ko bhi spirit lebill se dekhakar kshaitij kiya ja saktaa he
 The planks can be folded into the horizontal plane by loosening the screws tightening the plantebul and stabilizing tightly in the desired position
 darsharekhi 60 yaa 75 senmi
 lambii, ek senmi
 moti or lagbhag paanch senmi
 chaudee dhaatu yaa lakdi kaa bana hota he
 Its two long edges are straight and one side sloping, so that it is possible to draw a straight and correct line
 darsharekhi ke donon siron par do drishy-vedhikaaye yaa pattiyaan lagi rahati hai
 a leaf is cut in the middle of one leaf, from which the surveyor looks at his target and threads a thread between the other leaf and ends at the ends of both leaves
 ek pattee main kati zairi, duusare main piroyaa or pattiyon ke siron par tana dhaagaa is prakaar rakhe jate hai ki vah ek hi samtal main paden
 When the viewer is placed on the horizontal plane, the thread and thread will be perpendicular to the bottom of the board
 yadi zairi se jhaankakar dhaage se katataa koi bhi dur kaa bindu yaa vastu dekhi jaae to darsharekhi prekshak kii sthiti se us bindu yaa vastu kii disha batayega
 If the paper is overlaid on the platenbul and the position of the observer is marked on it, at that time, the side of the spectator is kept touching the position on the observer's paper and through the line on the tangent edge of the spectator by seeing an object or point on the thread
 When pulled, it will be the direction of the object or point, called a ray, from the position of the observer
 yahi kriya kisi duusari sthiti se dohraane par ek hi bindu kii do sthitiyon se do kirane aapas main katkar pratichchhed bindu par uski sahi saapeksh sthiti de dengi
 Magnetic compasses are made in a rectangular, glass-covered, brass wax by suspending a needle of magnet on a nail
 prayog na hone par sui ko aalamb se uthaakar sthir karne kaa upaay bhi rahata he
 This helps to keep the plantables in the right directions at each position
 kaach kii nalee main halakaa drav bharkar donon ore se aise band kiya jaataa he ki uske andar vaayu kaa ek bulbula bana rahe
 The tube has a light curve
 ise dhaatu kii ek chaukor nalee main aise drudh band karte hai ki vakr nalee kaa ubhara bhaag dhaatu kii nalee kii ek sataha par kate chhed se dikhaai padataa rahe
 This is called spirit levil or telemetry
 yadi spirit levil tipai par kase chitrapatal par rakhaa jaae or tipai ke pair aise jamaa die jaaen ki talamaapi ko kisi bhi do samakon dishaao main planetebul par rakhane se uskaa bulbula kendrit rahe to planetebul kshaitij ho jaataa he
 Due to not being horizontal, the drawn rays of the points would be wrong mainly because they are located very high or below
 at: binduon kii sahi saapeksh sthitiyaan praapt nahin hongi
 Points, whose regulators are known, are plotted on the desired scale, located in the area for survey, on a graded paper
 yah kaagaj planetebul par madh diya jaataa he
 There are several ways of paper mounting
 yadi surveykshan kaary bahut thode samay kaa ho to kaagaj batan pinon se takhte par madh diya jaataa he
 If there is a survey of one or two weeks, in which the paper is necessary to remain absolutely stable, then by placing a strong thin paper skirting or maggi on all the four sides of the paper, you stick the enlarged portion of that skirting firmly on the table
 lambii avadhi tak chalanevaale surveykshan, yaa jisamen kaagaj kaa purnataya sthir rahanaa aavashyak ho usamen, kaagaj ko patal se lagbhag 15 senmi
 adhik lambey or chaude kapade par chipka dete hai
 The cloth is then pulled firmly onto the surface of the plantebul
 jab kapade par chipka kaagaj planetebul par lagaate hai to kaagaj par vargankan or niyantran vinduon kaa aalekhan kaagaj ko patal par madhne ke baad karte hai
 Thereafter, in the area where the survey is to be conducted, the surveyor takes a plantebul to a control point located in it, which is marked on its paper
 aise vindu ko stesan kehete hai
 The tripod is placed almost horizontally over the station with its legs stretched and the board tightened
 usapar talamaapi ko do krmanugat samakon sthitiyon main rakhkar tipai ke pairon ko aise jamaaya jaataa he ki bulbula kendrit rahe
 This makes the planetbulb horizontal
 iske baad diksthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Displacement is the condition of the planetbulb when the lines connecting the control points on the image of the platenbul to the paper become parallel to the lines connecting the same points on the earth
 yah dasha praapt karne ke liye surveykshak nimna kriya karata he : kalpana karen, surveykshak bhoomi par bane a vindu par khadaa he jisaki kaagaj par lagi a sthit he
 Similarly, if the physical and graphical positions of each other point are b and b, respectively, the surveyor places one edge of his viewer so that it is tangent to a and b, with the threaded target-eye towards b and the target with target-observable a
 Stay towards tab vah planetebul ko tipai par aise ghumata he ki darsharekhi kii zairi se b bindu dhaage par katataa dikhaai de
 On attaining such condition, he tightens the plantables
 is prakaar patalchitr apni sahi kii dishaao main sthapit ho jaataa he
 In this case, if the position of the visible director edge surveyor is kept touching the a and any other graphical point, the physical position of the point seen will be cut on the thread
 yah smaraneey he ki zairi sadaiv prekshak kii ore tathaa dhaage vaali drishyvedhika dekhe gaye vindu kii ore rahegi
 In the above case, by drawing a panel, the surveyor, using his pencil on his graphical position a point, sees the edge of the viewer touching the point, cuts the other points on the thread in the jharoka and draws rays towards them
 aisi kirane vah un sabhi vinduon kii ore khinchataa he jinhen vah maanchitr par darshana chahta he, jaise gaanv, nadi, sadakon aadi ke mode or sangam
 The turning point and the confluence point is the leader because the right part can also be formed through lines joining the point
 yahi kriya vah duusare steshnon par doharaat he
 This will cut the rays of the same point given from any two positions together, giving the correct relative position of the point at intersection
 yah sthitiyaan usee paimaane par hongi jisapar chaandon kaa aalekhan hoga
 This is called the intersection method of snapping
 yadi kirane khinchakar, unheen vinduon kii kramash: duuri naapakar, kiran par paimaane se kaat lee jaae to bhi sahi vindu praapt ho jaataa he
 This is called the radiation method of survey
 kisi nadi, nahar, maarg aadi rekhak chizon ke kinare sthit ek stesan se dur sthit adrishy stesan tak krmanugat kirane dekar duuri naapakar, vindu lagaate hue unka surveykshan ho to use chankraman surveykshan kehete hai
 The surveyor makes the shapes of the objects by mixing the cut points with lines
 maanchitr ko dekhakar bhoomi par or bhoomi se maanchitr par bani vastuon ko pahchaanane ke liye sankethik chihnon kaa vah prayog karata he, jisase saamaan akritiyon main bhi vibhedan ho sake
 For example, in place of canals, roads, railways, etc
, only lines will be formed, but the surveyor is able to draw them in different colors and ways to convince others
 vinduon ke bich kii saapeksh unchaaiyaan surveykshak samocch rekhaon se pradarshit karata he
 For this, the process of drafting is best
 bhoomi saamne he or maapan, aalekhan or chithran kriyaayein saath saath chalati jaati hai
 a thermometer is used to find relative heights
 is yantra se prekshak apni sthiti par kisi bhi duusare vindu kii oonchaai main bhinnata ke kaaran bane kone kaa sidhaa sparshajya pard saktaa he
 One can find the distance of that point from the plate by itself and then find the relative height of that point
 is prakaar sabhi vinduon kii saapeksh unchaaiyaan gyaat kar letaa he
 Heights are measured from a base to maintain uniformity in relative heights drawn from different positions of the surveyor
 yah aadharatal saamanyat: jowar bhaate kaa dhyaan rakhkar naape gaye samudr kaa ausat tal mana jaataa he
 The line connecting the points located at the same height from this plane is called the contour line
 ise khinchakar surveykshak oonchaai kaa abhas karaata he

 lev tolastoy unnisvin sadi ke sarvaadhik sammanit lekhakon main se ek hai
 He was born in a wealthy family in Russia
 unhone roosi sena main bhartee hokar kreemian yuddh main bhaag liya, lekin agle hi varsh sena chhod di
 His interest in writing was already awakened before he joined the army
 unke upanyaas yuddh or shaanti tathaa aanna karenina saahitiyik jagat main clasik rachanaayen maani jaati he
 Despite the wealth and literary talent, Tolastoy yearned for peace of mind

 Leaving his family, he set out to serve God and the poor
 unke swasthya ne adhik dinon tak unka saath nahin diya
 Finally, on 20 November 1910, at a small railway station named Astapava, this rich son embraced death as a poor, destitute, sick old man

 It had a favorable effect on Tolstoy in his youth
 par tollstoy kaa ant:karan ise uchit nahin samajhataa tha
 He has clearly condemned it in his diary
 1844 main tollstoy kazan vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hue or 1847 tak unhonen paurvatya bhashaaon or vidhisanhitaon kaa adhyayan kiya
 Due to the question of division of the state, he had to leave the university without graduating

 In 1851, Tolstoy also entered the army for some time
 unki niyukti kokeshas main parvatiy kabeelon se honevaali dirghakaalin ladaai main hui jahaan avkaash kaa samay ve likhane padhane main lagaate rahe

 In this journey, he witnessed the death of his elder brother suffering from tuberculosis

 The education system of this school was very progressive
 isamen vartmaan parikshapranali evam iske aadhaar par uteern anuteern kaarne kii vyavastha nahin rakhi gai thi
 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him

 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame
 ve manushyajivan kaa rahasy or uske tatvachintan ke prati vishesh jaagruk the
 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide
 par ant main unhone isapar vijay pai
 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"
 iske krantikari vichaar aise hai jinke kaaran rus main iske prakaashan kii anumati bhi nahin mili or pustak switsraland main prakashit hui
 Many of his other compositions of this time are of this category and they are all printed in Switzerland
 1878 se lekar 1885 tak kii avadhi main falaatmak sahitya srijan kii drushti se tollstoy niskriy rahe
 His intuition remained entangled in the search for the secret of human life
 ambtak kii samast rachanaayen unhen vyarth prathit hone lageen
 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi
 Our Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was a young man at this time
 inhen dinon unhone tollstoy kii rachanaayen ruchipurvak padhi thim or unki ore aakrisht hue the
 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He departed with his daughter Alexandra on 10 November 1910, but on 22 November 1910, he accidentally died in a lung in the passage station Estapovo
 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation

 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing

 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a result
 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Boudhayan theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true

 Therefore, a2 + b2> c2
 jin trikon main ek obtyus kone hota he, α + β < γ hota he
 Therefore, a2 + b2 <c2 occurs
 edsjar disxtra ne is prastaav ko acut, samakon or obtyus trikon ke bare main is bhashaa main kaha he: Where angle α is opposite to lateral a, angle β is opposite to lateral b and angle γ is opposite to lateral c
 yucalidian jyamiti ke siddhant se paaythagorian prameya se praapt hua he, vastav main, upar bataae paaythagorian prameya kaa yucalidian prakaar bina yucalidian jyamiti ke nahin hota he
 Is shown to be equivalent to self-respect
 ) udhaaharan ke liye, goleey jyamiti main, octate se simit ikai kshetra ke samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon kii lambaai π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} ke baraabar he; yucalidian paaythagorian prameya kaa ulanghan karti he kyunki π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} This means that in the Euclidean theorem, the Pythagorean theorem must take a different form from the Euclidean theorem
 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function
 atishyoktipurna trikonmiti main, sin ke kone kii samanta santusht karata he Thus, this equation takes the form jahaan a, b, and c samakon trikon ke parshvon kii ganaatmak dooriyaan hai 
 The distance between the points {and {in 3 dimensions is √2 + 2)] 2 + 2) = √2 + 2 + 2) and similarly for 4 or more dimensions
 paaythagoras formula ko cartigian nirdeshaank samtal main do ankon ke bich kii duuri pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he or maanya he agar sab nirdeshaank asli hai: ank {2+2)

yah isliye he kyonki yah formula paaythagoras kii prameya par nirbhar he, jo apane has pramaan main kshetrafal par nirbhar he or kshetrafal trikon par nirbhar he or anya jyamitiya aankadon par jo andar ko bahaar se alag karti he, jo mumkin nahin hota agar nirdeshaank jatil hote
 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem

1937 'salim is the personification of the educated Indian and interests me a great deal
 He is excellent at his own theoretical subjects, but has no practical ability, and at everyday little problems is hopelessly inefficient


 His views are astounding
 He is prepared to turn the British out of India tomorrow and govern the country himself
 i have repeatedly told him that the British Government have no intention of handing over millions of uneducated Indians to the mercy of such men as Salim:


 Salim Ali's early surveys found both support and support for his wife Tehmina, and he broke down after his wife died in 1939 after a minor surgery

 Although once a fan of hunting literature, Ali's views on hunting remained strong, but he continued to collect bird specimens for scientific study
 unke apane vichaar the ki vanya jeev sangrakshan ke abhyaas ko vyaavhaarikta kii aavashyaktaa he or use ahimsa jaise darshan par aadhaarit nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that this fundamental religious sentiment was a hindrance in the development of bird studies in India
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics
