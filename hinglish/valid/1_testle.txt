 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government
 isi kram main 1861 main elexander kaningham ke nirdesan main bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana
 in sabhi sthalon par paripakv tathaa unnat hadappa samskruti ke darshan hote hai
 The mature state of this culture is also seen in the coastal towns of Sutkagandor and Surkotada
 in donon kii visheshta he ek ek nagar durg kaa hona
 The North Harappan stage has also been found at Rangpur and Rosadi sites in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat
 is sabhyataa kii jaankaree sabase pehle 1826 main charles main ko praapt hui
 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he
 Evidence of severe firefighting has also been obtained
 mohenzodaro ke ek kamare se 14 nar kankal mili he jo akraman, aagjanee, mahamari ke sanket he

 ganit main atiparavalay ek aisa shankav hota he jisaki utkendrata ikai se adhik hoti he
 According to another definition, a hyperbola is a locus of points whose distance between two fixed points is always constant
 in nishchit binduon ko atiparavalay kii nabhiyaan kehete hai
 a hyperbola is a two dimensional plane curve defined by its geometric properties or equations
 ek atiparavalay main do bhaag hote hai, jinhen sanyugmi ghatak kaha jaataa he, jo ek-duusare kii darpan chhaviyaan hoti hai or donon anant lambey dhanush kii tarah hoti hai
 Hyperbola is one of three types of cone intersection, which is formed by a plane and a bicep intersection
 yadi ek samtal, ek dwishanku ke donon hisson ko pratichchhed karata he lekin vah samtal shankuon ke sheersh se nahin gujarata he, to shankav ek atiparavalay hota he 
 Hyperbola in geometry can be defined as a locus of points on the Euclid plane
 ek atiparavalay binduon kaa ek bindupath he, mana kisi bindu p { \ displaystyle P} ke liye, do nishchit binduon f 1 , f 2 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle F_{1},F_{2}}} se duriyon | p f 1 |, | p f 2 | { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle |PF_{1}|, \ |PF_{2}|}} kaa antar sadaiv niyat rahata he
 Usually the following type is represented as 2 a, a> 0: { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle 2a, \ a> 0 \ :}} h = { p ∣ | | p f 2 | − | p f 1 | | = 2 a } 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle H= \ {P \ mid ||pf_{2}|-|pf_{1}||=2a \ } \ 
}} The mid-point m { \ displaystyle M} of the line segment joining the two nuclei is called the center of the hyperbola and this line segment is called the principal axis
 mukhyaksh par sheersh v 1 , v 2 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle V_{1}},V_{2}} hote hai jo centre se a { \ displaystyle a} duuri par hai
 The distance between the navel and the center is called c { \ displaystyle c} focal distance
 anupaat c a { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle { \ tfrac {c}{a xxrep 4 } utkendrata e { \ displaystyle e} ke baraabar hota he
 the equation: atiparavalay kaa centre mulbindu, mukhyaksh x-aksh, tathaa nabhiyaan tathaa sheersh v 1 =, v 2 = 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle V_{1}=, \ V_{2}=}
} va nabhiyaan f 1 =, f 2 = { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle F_{1}=, \ F_{2}=}} Then the equation of the hyperbola for any point on the hyperbola x 2 a 2 − y 2 b 2 = 1 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle { \ frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{ \ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}=1 \ 
}} Eccentricity: e = 1 + b 2 a 2 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle e={ \ sqrt {1+{ \ frac {b^{2}}{a^{2 xxrep 5 }

 Some large tuna species, such as bluefin tuna, are warm-blooded and can raise their body temperature above the water temperature by shaking muscles
 yah unhen apekshaakrit thande pani main jivit rahane or anya kismon kii machhliyon kii apeksha samudr ke vividhtapurna vaataavaran main rahane ke liye sakasham banaata he
 "tuna" is derived from the Spanish word ्यूن्यू or تون tun / tūn in Arabic, thunnus in Latin and the Greek word θύννος, thanas
 toona kii 48 se adhik vibhinn prakaar kii prajatiyaan hai
 The Thunnus class includes 9 species: kai anya pidiyon kii prajatiyon kaa bhi saamaanya naam "toona" hi he
 One notable aspect of Thunnus' physiology is maintaining his body temperature above the surrounding seawater

 However, like typical endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively extremely low range

 toona ek mahatvapurn vyavsaayik machhlee he
 The International Sea Food Sustainability Foundation compiled a detailed scientific report about the global stock of tuna in 2009, including regular updates
 report ke anusaar, duniya bhar ke mahasaagaron main toona vyapak rup se, kintu chote-chote jhundon main, aam taur par bumadhya rekha ke 45 degree uttar or dakshin main ushnkaribandheey or shitoshna pani main pai jaati he
 They are classified in the category of Scombridae, which includes about 50 species
 inamen vyavsaayik or manoranjak matsay udyog ke liye prayukt hone vaali sabase mahatvapurn machhlee yellophine, bigai, blufin, albakor tathaa skipjaik hai
 The report further states that: 2006 main australian sarkaar ne aarope lagaaya ki japan ne avaidh rup se prativarsh 12000 se 2 xxrep 4 0 ton dakshini blufin pakad kar 6000 ton kii sahamat maatra se adhik machhlee pakadi thi; is prakaar kii jarurat se adhik machhlee kii laagat lagbhag 2 billian america dollar thi
 Over-fishing of this type has caused excessive damage to the amount of bluefin

 In response, Japan's Fisheries Research Agency states that tuna fishing companies in Australia and New Zealand underestimate the total amount of southern bluefin caught and ignore internationally accepted quantities

 Fishery practices have changed to adapt to dolphin fishes, which has led to an increase in the number of catch by-products such as sharks, turtles and other marine fishes
 machuaare ab dolphin machhliyon kaa peechha nahin karte, balki ab machhliyon ke ekatrit karne vaale upkarnon, jinhen abedi bhi kaha jaataa he, kii sahaayta se tairne vaale utpaadon ko pakadaney par dhyaan kendrit karte hai, jo anya jeevon kii ek badi aabaadi ko aakarshith karte hai

 suprasiddh vaigyanik sar james jin apni 'padarath vigyaan or darshan' naamak pustak kii bhoomika main likhte he - "darshan or vigyaan kii seemaa rekha jo ek prakaar se nirarthak ho chuki thi ; vaicharik padaarth vigyaan ke nikat bhoot main hone vaale vikaas ke karg vahi seemaa rekha mahatvapurn or aakarshak ban gai he
 " darshan or vigyaan jo ab tak vipareet dashaon ke pathik maane ja rahe the, vah yu samaapt ho gaya he
 The reality is that philosophy is also the solution to the 'element' that has come in the human mind and what is the goal of science as well? What is reality It has to be understood
 darshan ke shabd main jivan kii vyapaktaa samahit hoti he
 What is the world? What am I? Understanding these situations and accordingly moving towards my destination becomes a complete form of philosophy
 isiilie tatvagyon ne kaha-dukh jihasa or sukh lipsa jivan kaa lakshya he
 In the field of thought, knowledge and Shia have taken two forms, this is also a Bahujan consensus
 yaha tak tatv kya he ? is prashn kaa samaadhaan he vah darshan he or vah jaan lene ke pashchaat vishwa kaa swaroop yah he, usamen aatma kii sthiti yah he or in prayatnon va sadhano se aatma apane charam laksh moksh ko praapt kar leti he, is tarah aacharan karnaa dharm he
 Both philosophy and religion have equal importance in the liberation of the soul
 isiilie kaha gaya he -"gyaan riyabhayaan moksh:" Where we discuss the goal and definition of science, there is an urge to kill only
 sristi ke rahasyon ko kholte jaao va satya ko pate jaao iske aage vahaan kuch bhi nahin miltaa
 Many people have not been able to know philosophy properly
 unki drushti main vibhinn vyaktiyon dwaara chalaae gaye vibhinn dharm hi vibhinn darshan he
 That's why they think philosophy is tactful
 par sthiti isse sarvatha bhinn he
 Philosophy is born on the role of logic itself
 darshan yug se pehle shraddha yug tha
 What Mahavir Buddha Kapil etc
 great men said was believed to be true with the same evidence that Mahavir has said it and this Buddha or Kapil has said that the words of a man who had reverence in him were scriptures for him
 tark kaa yug aayaa
 Man started thinking - that man has said why should we believe the truth like this? The criterion of truth should be the logic, the proof
 yahi se darshan kaa udgam hua
 Therefore it is ignorance to assume that philosophy is not just providing logic but only reverence
 vigyaan kaa itihaas darshan se bahut kuch bhinn he
 No ultimate man has been considered certified on the basis of science
 lagata he- vigyaan kaa chintan kaa chintan dharm or darshanon ke vivaadaaspad nirnyon se ubarkar ek swatantra dhara ke rup main chalaa he
 Our truth should always be indistinguishable and one form, so scientists considered experiments and investigations as their proof
 vigyaan kii paribhaasha main satya vahi mana gaya jis par prayogshaalaon or vedhashalaon kii chhap lag gai ho ; kintu satya ko paa lenaa itnaa sahaj nahin tha, jitna ki unhone samajha tha
 If we do a neutral study by taking up the history of science, then there are found changing decisions on every page
 gati sahaayak ether ke vishay main nunatam prabhruti prakatan vaigyanikon ne kya kuch mana, ab tak kitne prayogon ke aadhaar par kitne nae nirnay aae or aaj pro 
 albarat ainstin ne kis prakaar ise astitv shunya-sa kar diya he
 In the era of nuclear, from democrats to atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, how many newcomers have been made in this era
 parmaanu kaa itihaas keval rimit vikaas kaa hi dhyotak nahin he ; vibhinn nirnyon ke uthal puthal kii vah ek granthimala bhi he
 Even if we consider it as a symbol of developed development, this question will always remain in front - if the truth of tomorrow changes today, will today's truth be able to last till tomorrow? Regarding the speed, position and appearance of the Sun, Moon, Earth and other planetary bodies, the talk of Tolmike era did not exist in Copernicus's age and the relativism of Einstein threatens a new form on Copernicus's decisions
 kya ham sochen is sambandh main ainstin ke nirnay antim hai ? The science that was important to advance philosophy as the product of a weak brain, nature did not allow that ego to live long
 aaj vigyaan apane samast nirnyon main swayan ndehshil he
 As he opens his hands to the new mysteries of nature, his ignorance becomes the role of understanding how big it is
 vaigyanik jagat main ye shabd aaj chaaron ore goonjane lage hai- "we have begun to understand and feel more well how big the spread of our ignorance is
 "sar james jin likhte he- "shaayad yah acha ho ki vigyaapan nit nai ghoshnaa karnaa chhod de, kyonki gyaan kii nadi bahut baar apane aadi-shrot kii ore bah chuki he
 " ek duusari jagah ve likhte he -"beesvin sadi kaa mahaan avishkaar saapekshavaad siddhanth nahin he or na parmaanu vibhaajan hi
 The great invention of this century is that things are not as they look
 is ke saath sarvamaanya baat to yah he ham ab tak param vaastaviktaa ke paas nahin pahunche hai
 " is tarah ham sahaj hi nirnay par pahunch jate he ki vigyaan ne darshan ke saath baghawat kar param satya tak pahunchne kaa jo ek swatantra maarg nikaala tha vah bhi itnaa sidhaa nahin niklaa jitna kii samaj gaya tha
 Nevertheless, we must understand that there is more coordination in philosophy and science than in conflict
 darshan ke peeche jaisi ek bahut lambii gyaan parampara he vigyaan main satya grahan kii ek utkar laalasaa he
 Scientists have never had the grace to hold what seemed unreal
 darshan ne jaise aage chalakar anek path banaaye yah- 'vaidic darshan','bodh darshan' yah 'jain darshan' aadi, is prakaar darshan main ab tak vibhinn margon kaa udai nahin hua
 All scientists come today on the same path if not today
 jivan main upyogita kii drushti se bhi darshan or vigyaan dono kaa swatantra mahatv he
 Both are paths to reach the destination of truth, but the development of philosophy grew mainly in the form of subjectivism
 isse manushya ko aatm-saakshaat, kaivalya va dhruthi, kshamaa, santosh, ahimsa, satya aadi mili
 Man can live in the absence of physical strength, that too with pleasure, but without spiritual and moral strength, man has no choice but to die in a pile of material means

 The count of Shodash Shringar appears to be unknown in ancient Sanskrit literature
 anumaanatah yah gananaa vallabhdev kii subhashitawali main pratham baar aati he
 According to him they are as follows- arthath majjan, cheer, haar, tilak, anjan, kundal, nasamukta, keshavinyas, cholii, noopur, angaraag, kankan, charanraag, karadhani, tambul tathaa kardarpan 
 Again this list of Shringar in Sri Rupgoswami's bright 16th century is counted as follows- ukt pramaan se shringaaron kii yah suchi banati he— arthath snaan, nasa mukta, asit pat, kati sutara, venivinyas, karnavatans, angon kaa charchit karnaa, pushpamaal, haath main camel, kesh main phool khonsnaa, tambul, chibuk kaa kasturi se chithran, kaajal, sharir par patrawali, makribhang aadi kaa chithran, alaktak or tilak
 Here the variation is evident in the list of Vallabhdev's and Sri Rupagoswami's period
 hindi kaviyon main jaaysi ke anusaar ye shringaar yon hai— majjan, snaan, vastra, patrawali, sindur, tilak, kundal, anjan, adharon kaa rangana, tambul, kusumgandh, capolon par til, haar, kanchuki, chhudraghantica ore paayal
 Acharya Keshavdas of Reetikavya has also calculated sixteen adornments as follows- ukt chand kii tikaa karte hue sardaar kavi ne ye shringaar yon gine hai— ubtan, snaan, amal patt, jaavak, veni goonthna, maang main sindur, lalaat main khor, capolon main til, ang main kesar lepan, menhadi, pushpabhushan, svarnabhushan, mukhwas danta manjan, tambul or kaajal
 It is clear here that the commentator has added several tools on his behalf
 nagendranath vasu ne hindi vishwakosh main in shringaaron ko gananaa nimnlikhit di he— ubtan, snaan, vastradharan, kesh prashaadhan, kaajal, sindur se maang bharna, mahavar, tilak, chibuk par til, menhadi, sugandh lagaana, aabhushan, pushpamaal, missi lagaana, tambul or adharon ko rangana
 The above various lists show that there is no definite definition or list to Shodash Shringar

 a hygienic or corneal is the transparent part of the eye that has outside light and is repelled
 yah aankh kaa lagbhag do-tihaai bhaag hota he, jisamen bahari aankh kaa rangeen bhaag, putali or lens kaa prakaash dene vaala hissaa hote hai
 There is no blood vessel in the cornea but a network of nerves
 isko poshan dene vaale dravya vahi hote hai, jo aansu or aankh ke anya paardarshee drav kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Often the cornea is compared to the lens, but there is a great difference from the lens
 ek lens keval prakaash ko apane par girane ke baad failaane yaa sicodne kaa kaam karata he jabaki cornea kaa kaary isse kahin vyapak hota he
 The cornea actually allows light to enter the eyeball
 iskaa uttal bhaag is prakaash ko aage putali or lens main bhejtaa he
 In this way it is very helpful in vision
 cornea kaa gumbadakaar rup hi yah tay karata he ki kisi vyakti kii aankh main duuradrushti dosha he yaa nikat drushti dosha
 When viewing, external lenses are used to focus the image on the lens of the eye
 isse cornea main badlaav aa saktaa he
 In this case, by installing an artificial contact lens near the cornea, its thickness is increased to a new focal point
 kuch aadhunik kaantect lens cornea ko dobaaraa iske vaastavik aakaar main laane ke liye dabaav kaa prayog karte hai
 This process lasts until the ambiguity is gone
 cornea camere kii lens kii tarah hota he jisase prakaash andar jaakar retina par padataa he iske baad chitra banataa he, jise drushti-dhamni vidyut sanket rup main mastishk ke upyukt bhaag tak pahunchaa detii he
 If the cornea is defective, the retina does not form and the person becomes blind
 kai baar ankhon main sankraman, chot yaa vitamin e kii kami ke kaaran bhi cornea kharaab ho jate hai
 Coronary defects are treated by surgical treatment
 ye oparation saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this, the surgeons complete this activity by sublimating the nerves attached to the cornea without shedding blood
 kabhi-kabhi oparation ke dauraan cornea par kisi bahari vastu se kharonch bhi lag jaati he yaa phir palak kaa hi koi bal tuutakar is par kharonch bana detaa he
 In this condition the cornea is cured within a few days with some eye liquid medicines
 bahut se log apana cornea daan kar dete hai taaki koi unki ankhon se yah duniya dekh sake
 This cornea donation is actually called eye donation
 netradaan karne vaale vyakti kii mrityu ke baad uske cornea ko nikaalkar mashin kii sahaayta se uski koshika ghanatv dekhi jaati he
 Having more than three thousand cells in an area of one square millimeter is the hallmark of a good cornea
 cornea ke oparation kaa prachlit sabase pehle italy main viksit kiya gaya tha
 Subsequently, it was adopted in the United States and later adopted worldwide
 is oparation main rogi ke ek daant or uske paas kii kuch haddi ko nikaal kar taraasha gaya or us main belanaakaar lens ko baitaane ke liye ek chhed kiya gaya
 The teeth, including the lens, are first transplanted under the skin of the patient's cheeks or shoulders for two months, so that they are well joined together
 baad main unhen vahaan se nikaal kar aankh main pratiropit kiya jaataa he
 For this, the pit of the eye is first prepared well
 aankh kii shleshma vaali parat main ek chhed kiya jaataa he, taaki lens thodaa-sa baahar niklaa rahe or aasapaas ke prakaash ko grahan kar sake
 In recent years, a new alternative is to make the intrastromal corneal ring uniquely made of plastic in such a way that it can sit inside the cornea
 inke dizin kuch is tarah se bane hote hanki ye cornea ko dobaaraa se khoi hui akruti waapas lautaate hai or drushti sudhaarte hai
 This transplant does not require the removal of corneal tissue
 isamen rogi ko thik hone main bhi adhik samay bhi nahin lagata he
 This new cornea transplant is a surgical procedure in which the discs of the cornea are removed and the donated tissue is applied
 haalanki ye safaltaapurvak ho jaataa he lekin ye bahut hi aaramdaayak hota he or thik hone main bahut samay lagata he

 Although researchers like Prakash Parimal have written the birth of Shivanand ji as Vikram Samvat 1710, there is no evidence of this fact available in his short book
 sach to yah he inkaa janm asal main kis saal, kahan hua yah shodh kaa vishay he
 The only reason for this is that in the old times, great and great writers did not often give any information or information about their personal life in their works

 It is widely believed that despite being the respected vice-chancellors of many kings, Goswamiji spent his last time with him at the request of Maharaja Anoop Singh of Bikaner

 Shivanand Goswami was a contemporary of Chanderi Governor Devi Singh Bundela, who had lent the jagir of some villages in a 'mantra-diksha' meeting with Goswamiji

 In 1692-1694 AD, Jaipur king Vishnusinh gifted him the fiefdom of the villages of Ramjipura, Harivanshpura, Chimanpura and Mahapura, the proof of which is still preserved in the records of Pothikhana of Jaipur

 Goswamiji was gifted the fief of two villages - Pulasar and Chilkoi by Maharaja Anup Singh of Bikaner

 He may have died there as well - but no historical material is available about his last days

 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur, the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, The court scholars of the village SURJANSAR Devisingh used to make many kinds of arguments against him in his absence, filling the ears of the king
 It was well known that Orchha or the favored deity of the Bundelas, was Lord Rama and that is why many Rama and Hanuman temples have also been established in this area, in the same way there is a temple of Hanumanji, the favored Bundelas of Orchha itself
 This temple used to lie between the ashram of Shivanandji and the palaces of Devisingh

 "the king was probably not completely satisfied with his answer
 isliye ek baar jab ve donon usee hanuman mandir ke maarg se aa rahe the, raja ne apane isht hanuman ko pranaam karne kii aagrahabhari vinati kar hi daali
 It is said that as soon as the supreme worshiper of Shakti, Shivanandji raised his hands for salutation, before that the idol of Hanumanji had a deep crack from top to bottom with the sound of stone bursting! The king became very frightened by this miracle
 or tab se uske man main aadyashakti ke prati bhi gahari nishtha jaagrath ho gayi

 The phonemes are the shortest unit of spoken language, making the difference between two sounds clear
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki swanim kaa sambandh dhwani se he
 If the sound is related to pronunciation, then it is also associated with hearing
 yadi dhwani suni nahin jaaegi to uskaa astitv bhi sandigdh hoga
 The phonemes have been said to be related to physiology and physics due to the pronunciation and auditory relations of sound, because if the pronunciation and hearing process are related to physiology, then the movement is completely related to physics

, but on subtle thinking there is a knowledge of subtle differences in these sounds

 Use the ~ sign for this; As- wall> wall / r / ~ / l
 kisi shabd ke aadi, madhya or ant main prayukt hone par yadi arth-parivartan ho, to swanim rup nishchit ho jaataa he; yatha - 'aap' shabd ke aadi or ant main 'ja' prayog se arth-parivartit rup is prakaar milte hai - Thus 'h' is phoneme
 'l' swanim ko is prakaar dikhaa sakate hai - The sound introduced is only in the beginning, its meaning does not change
 ant main swanim nahin he
 Ptk is phonemes in the middle and end positions, being used in more environments
