 hindi sahitya ke itihaas ko shabdabaddh karne kaa prashn adhik mahatvapurn tha
 The work of writing history of Hindi literature is definitely found in some form in various periods
 aarambhik kaal main maatr kaviyon ke suchi sangrah ko itihaas rup main prastut kar diya gaya
 Even if the description of the devout poets was given in the books of Bhaktamal etc
, then there was no other achievement except the expression of religious outlook and reverence

 Just as a normal circuit is constructed by adding different components, the IC is not constructed by making all the components within a semiconductor follow a specific process simultaneously
 ekikrut paripath aajkal jivan ke har kshetra main upyog main laaye ja rahe hai
 Due to these, the size of electronic devices has become very small, their working capacity has become very high and their power requirement has been reduced

 Later both companies were jointly licensed and its joint patents were granted
 pehali baar sookshmchip 1961 main logon ko uplabdh hui
 Jick Kilbey later invented the portable calculator
 tab se lekar ab tak sookshmchip main kai badlaav aa chuke hai
 While the first microchip had a transistor, a capacitor and three registers, today's microchip contains about 125 million transistors in a small space

 Today we can say that if the transistor had not been invented, it would not have been incompatible; And if it were not integrated, there would not be computers and other electronic devices whose circuit is made up of billions of components
 ekipari ke vikaas se nimnlikhit laabh hote hai- Integrated circuits are divided into three parts based on the nature of the circuit inside them - digital ekikrut paripathon ko unamem prayukt transistoron kii sakhya ke aadhaar par small scale integrated, medium scale integrated, large scale integrated, veri large scale integrated, ultra large scale integrated aadi main baanta jaataa he
 In the initial days there were only a few transistors inside the IC
