 narendramandal athwa nareshmandal bharatvarsh kaa ek purv vidhaan mandal tha
 It was a high and royal house of the Legislature of British India
 isaki sthapana san 1920 main britain ke raja, samraat jorge pancham ke shahi farmaan dwaara hui thi
 The basic objective of establishing ISCI was to provide a legislative platform to the princely states of British India so that the sabha of the British-protected princely states could present their hopes and aspirations to the British government

 After the conclusion of the British Raj in 1947, this House was displaced after the independence of India and the establishment of the Republic
 narendra mandal ko angrezi main "chembar aaf princez" kaha jaataa tha jise hindi main "narendramandal / nareshmandal" kaha jaataa tha
 In Hindi it can be translated as "royal chamber of royalty" or "royal chamber" or "royal chamber"
 angrezi main "chembar" kaa arth "kaksh", "prakoshth" athwa "cameraa" hota he or "prince" kaa arth hota he "rajkumaar" jisse kisi wastu ke rajkeey hone kaa bodh hota he

 odisi, homerkrut do prakhyat unani mahakavyon main se ek he
 In the Iliad, Homer describes the Trojan War and its aftermath, while the throne of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, also known as Ulysses, after the fall of Troy in Odyssey, describes the many difficulties he faced
 While doing so, he reaches his home after 10 years
 odesi i
pus
 aathvin shatabdi main likhi gayi he
 In relation to where it was written, it is believed that it was written in the present day Greece in the coast of Ionia, which is now part of Turkey
 odesi main odes yaa ulice naam ke ek puranic nayak ke troy ke yuddh ke baad mathrubhumi waapas lautate samay ghatane vaale sahaspurn kaaryon kii gaatha kahi gayi he
 Just as Hindus are happy reading the story of Lanka Vijay in Ramayana
 usee prakaar odissi main yunaan vir ulisis kii katha kaa varnan aanandamay he
 The prince of Troy kidnapped Queen Helen of Sparta and took him to the city of Troy
 is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye yunaan ke sabhi raajaaon or veeron ne milakar try par akraman kiya
 But neither the city gate was broken nor the ramparts could be broken
 ant main unani sena ne ek chaal chali
 a wooden hollow horse was mounted on a wheelbarrow
 use chhod ve apane jahaajon se waapas laut gaye
 The people of Troy thought that the Greeks left their idol of the god and were disappointed
 ve use khinchakar nagar main laae to mukhyadwar ke mehrab ko kuch kaatna padaa
 At night, when Troy was celebrating, Greek soldiers came out of the hollow ash statue and quietly opened the gate of Troy
 greek sena, jo waapas nahin gai thi balki paas main jaakar chhip gai thi, troy main ghus gai
 Troy perished behind a Helen just as Ravana's golden Lanka was destroyed behind Sita
 isi se angreji main ‘da trojan horse’ kaa muhaavara bana
 'odyssey' is the saga of the adventurous return journey of the Greek monarch Odessus
 try se lautate samay unka jahaaj tufaan main fas gaya
 He wandered here and there for a long time
 iske baad apane desh lautaa
 Mangalacharan - o Goddess, give me the power to sing the story of the skilled man Odesius who ravaged the fortress of Troy and wandered all over the world, who saw diverse castes and cities, and to protect the life on the waves of the rising sea
 Endured severe hardship
 yah katha choubees sargo main bataai gayi he, jiname sarg ek main try yuddh ke baad das varshon tak yoddha odesius varun ke krodh ke kaaran ksht bhogata evam bhatakta rahaa
 The story begins in the last part of this painful period
 sarg chaar main telmekas kii minilas evam hellen se bhent hoti he
 In Canto Nine, Odesian narrates the story of the Battle of the Syconies
 odesius ne kahajab try yuddh samaapt hua tab grihaagaman ke raste main hamane siconijon par akraman kiya, parajeet hue
 For nine days and nine nights, our battle-ships wandered far away from the north wind
 ant main ham lotson ke desh main pahunche - yah lotus ek madhur vanaspati he jiske khaane se hamaare navik ghor pramaad main nimagn ho gayi
 They were forcibly dragged and brought onto the vessel
 phir aage chalakar ham ek nayanvaale rakshason ke desh main pahunche or apni morrkhtaa se ek rakshas kii gupha main kaid ho gayi
 Then cleverly, after giving him liquor, he broke his eye with a big block and in the morning, when the demon opened the cave to his sheep to go out, we got out by tying ourselves with each sheep
 yah rakshas samudr evam bhucamp ke adhipati varun kaa putr tha
 Due to this, Varun became angry with us
 sarg teraa main atithey raja dwaara odesian kii yatra ke prabandhan kaa varnan he
 In the canto eccles there is the legend of Swayamvar's suggestion by Atheny to Pinilopy
 sarg 24 dusht kumari kii atmaaen ad yamalok main vaa unke sambandhiyon dwaara yuddh kii yojana or yuddh prarambh hone vaa ant main shaanti evam sandhi kii katha he
 Odissi is divided into 24 Anuwakas and its duration is 42 days
 aarambhik anuvaak main devataaon kii sabha main odisius kii sangrakshika ethina jiyas se shikaayat karti he ki odisius 10 varsh purv try se ravaanaa hua tha kintu abhi tak ghar nahin pahunch sakaa he; kaaran, calipso naamak rakshasi ne use ojijia naamak dweep main roak rakhaa he jabaki ethaka main pinalapi ke panigrahanarthi udham hi nahin machaa rahe hai balki odisius kii sampatti bhi chat kar rahe hai
 Zeus allows Athena to act as he pleases, and she appears as a mentor to Odysseus' son Telemacus, advising him to block the entry of Pinelopei's patronesses into his house and to locate his father himself
 Travel dwitiya, tritiy tathaa chaturth anuvaakon main telemacas sambadhi katha chalati he
 Telmacus organizes a gathering and condemns the pioneers of Pinelopy, and begins a journey without telling his mother, with the help of mentor Athena
 menter ke saath vah pilos pahunchakar vruddh nestor se miltaa he jahaan use trajan yuddh ke asal vivaran gyaat hote hai
 From Pilos he goes to Sparta
 vahaan mene laos kii patni hellen se miltaa he or ghar lautne kii taiyaari karne lagata he
 Shortly thereafter, the poet presents the events of the kingdom of Odysseus in Ithaca
 ek ore pinalopi apane putr ke ekaek lupt ho jane se santrast he or duusari ore uske panigrahanarthi bandargah par antinus kii dekharekh main ek jahaaj bhejkar vyavastha karte hai ki telemacas jaise hi laute, uski hatya kar di jaay taaki odisius kii sampatti or pinalopi par unka kabja ho sake
 The fifth verse again contains the scene of the assembly of the gods, in which Athena once again seeks the salvation of Odysseus
 jiyas harmij ko callypso ke paas bhejtaa he or uske kehane se vah vrikshon ke latthon kaa bedaa banaakar odisius ko ethaka kii ore ravaanaa kar detii he
 After traveling with the help of stars for 17 days, as Odysseus approaches the island of Fiacia, the rage of Poseidon, the god of the sea, shatters his fleet and begins to sink into the waves
 tabhi samudr kii apsara liukothea use ek pranarakshak roomaal detii he jiske sahare vah antat: fiaisia pahunchataa he
 In the sixth verse, Nausicaa, the daughter of King Elsinus of Fiacia, receives orders from Athena in the dream to wash her clothes on the beach the next morning, where she meets Naked Odysseus
 saatven anuvaak main vah use kapadaa pahanaakar ghar le aati he
 In the eighth verse, King Elsinus greets Odysseus in the court
 is avasar par bhaat trajan-yuddh-sambandhi geet gaata he to odisius vichlit hokar rone lagata he
 Odysseus has to give his real introduction when the king asks him the reason for crying
 agle teen anuvaakon main odisiastroy ke patan ke baad kii apni 10 varsh kii romaanchak yatra kaa vivaran sabko sunaata he
 In the 12th Anuwak, Odysseum arrives at Ithaca on the magical ship of Phycia where Athena meets him as a shepherd and transforms him into a beggar so that his wife's benefactors do not harm him by recognizing him
 13wein anuvaak main ethina odisius ko uske shookarpal ke yahan bhejkar swayan sparta jaati he or telemacas ko shighrata se ethaka lautne kaa aadesh detii he
 In the 14th verse there is a conversation between Odysseus and Schukarpal
 15wein anuvaak main telemacas apni maan ke panigrahanarthiyon ke shadyantr se bachakar surakshit ghar laut aata he
 In the 16th verse, Telemacus recognizes his father in the house of Schukarpal
 pashchaat pitaputra pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon se chhutkaaraa paane kii yojana banaate hai
 In the 17th and 18th paragraphs, beggar Odysseus arrives at his palace where his old dog, Eragus, recognizes him and dies in joy
 isi samay odisius prasaad main upasthit pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon kaa auddhatya dekhtaa he jisase aage chalakar unhen maarane ke uske bhayankar krity kii uchit bhoomika bhi ban jaati he
 In the 19th episode, Odysseus and Pinalopi have a face-to-face conversation, but Pinalopi does not recognize her husband, while her old husband Euryclia recognizes her by looking at the childhood amputation on her leg
 20 wein anuvaak main odisius gusse ke kaaran raat bhar jagakar anek baaten sochataa rahata he
 In the 21st verse, Pinlopi challenges his descendants to shout the bow of Odysseus in the innings in such a way that he arrives out of the middle of 12 rings hanging in a huge tree
 sab asafal hote hai kintu bhikshukveshi odisius chhallon ke bich se tir nikaal detaa he
 The 22nd verse marks the climax of the epic
 odisius pinalopi ke saare panigrahanarthiyon ko tiron se bedhakar maar detaa he
 No one escapes, as all the doors of the spacious chamber were already locked, in the 23rd episode Pinelopy recognizes her husband, and the heartwarming and touching scene of the two meet
 maha kavy ke antim athwa 24wein adhyay main, jise kuch aalochak prakshipt maanate hai, devdoot marakari pinalopi ke sabhi panigrahanarthiyon kii atmaaon ko narak ke nichle evam nikrusht pradeshon main le jaataa he jahaan unhen vibhinn prakaar ke traasamay dand die jate hai
 Meanwhile, Odysseus goes to the fields outside the city and meets his father Lartise
 ant main odisius ke ghar laut aane ke upalaksh main shandaar daavat hoti he or ithaka main sukhshanti sthapit hone kii soochna ke saath granth kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 The story of the Iliad is just 50 days - the events of the last two months of the tenth year
 yadi kathanak katha ke armbh se prarambh hota to us leeda evam hans ke sanyog se prarambh hona chahie tha
 But Homer catches the last part of the story
 bich-bich main vah purv katha kaa sanket karata jaataa he, vah bhi ek kram se nahin
 The legend is already known to the Greek audience
 isi se use koi kathinaayee nahin gyaat hoti, anyathaa ek anjaan vyakti ko katha kaa prathamansh tabhi spasht hoga jab ek baar vah sampoorn kavy kaa pathan kar jaae
 The second thing to keep in mind about Elliot is that his subject, as is evident from Mangalacharan, is the anthem of Echiles
 jahaan yah krodh apni charam parinti ke baad samaapt hota he
 The story ends until a little further, that is, the direct results of this anger until the death of Petraclus and indirect death of Hector, but the death of Echileus, the destruction of Troy, etc
 does not come in this epic
 homer apane mahakavy main ghoshit vishay par badi kadai se ‘tu da point’ sthit rahata he - jaraa bhi idhar-udhar nahin jaataa
 The result of this extreme restraint is the story or 'unity of the subject'
 prayek ghatana samoochee dizin ke andar kasi hui angik sangati ke saath baithaayi gayi he
 There is a lack of unity and consistency in the Indian epics and the whole structure is complete with a loose narrative system
 valmiki ramayana kaa vishay he polastyavadh, par usamen avaantar ghatnaayen bahut deele sutron se judi hai
 In the Mahabharata, this 'unity' is not at all - it is written in the style of encyclopedia
 tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas main avashya yah ‘gathili ekta’ evam ‘angik sangati’ homer kii hi tarah milti he
 As far as the unity and effectiveness of the subject is concerned, no Indian poet, even Kalidas, can equal Tulsidas
 yah baat yahan abhidharth main likhi ja rahi he
 Homer describes and describes the anger of Echiles and its development in 9 cantos and concludes the story by taking its direct, indirect fruits
 yadi vah aage kii ghatana, ekiles kii mrityu evam try-dhwans, tak varnit karne ke pralobhan main padataa to kavy main vah kati-chhati gathili dhaanchaagat ekta nahin aa paati
 The structure would have become loose
 arestu ne homer kii pratibha kii saraahna ‘poytics’ ke un adhyyon main kii he or homer kaa hi anukaran kaa adarsh banane kii shiksha di he, jahaan vah ‘teen ektaaon’ evam prabhavanviti kii charchaa karata he
 In Greek literature, there is a great emphasis on structure
 yah rup vidhaan kii jyamithik sangati, unki murtikla, natyakala aadi sabhi ke andar spasht he
 He did not attach any less importance to Bhaanda than sentiment and ornamentation
 homer main yah pravriti na keval beej rup main vidyaman he, balki uskaa sarvottam rup homer main hi miltaa he
 The whole 'action' in the Iliad is circular
 jahaan se prarambh hota he, vahiin par aakar samaapt hota he
 The rites that provided the structure and the homeland to the Greek tragedy are the ethnic treasures of the Greeks, and they also establish the life of Homer's genius
 isi se homer evam kaalaantar ke tragedy sahitya main dhaanchaagat evam bhavgat samanta he
 The structure of the Greek tragedy is governed by three elements - 'one country', 'one period', and 'one trade or subject'
 elliod main ‘desh’ ek hi he arthath sari ghatana try ke mehalon evam saamne ke samudratat par hi hoti he
 The 'period' is also the same, because the epic story is of a continuous duration of 50 days
 arthath, ‘kaal’ kaa ek anwarat akhand rup diya gaya he - 10wein varsh ke antim 50 dinon ko pakad kar
 He does not spread the circle on the surface for 10 years and he covers it within 50 days
 vyapaar yaa vishay bhi ek hi he - ekiles kaa krodh, uskaa shaman evam upsanhaar ke rup main uskaa fal
 Just here, the epic ends
 odesi kaa vishay vistrut he
 The hero of the epic Odysseus wandered for 10 years after the war
 is dashak ke antim bhaag se is mahakavy kaa bhi prarambh hota he
 The structure is exactly like the Iliad
 elliod ke 50 dinon kii ghatana main vartmaan kaa hi praadhanya he - un 50 dinon main kya ghatit hua, isi kaa varnan kavi kaa uddeshy he
 The events of the past come somewhere along the way
 parantu odesi main yah baat nahin
 The theme of Odyssey is 'odysseus's sad journey'
 atah yah 10 varshon kaa bhraman-vrittant hi uskaa uddeshy he
 Like the Iliad, it begins at the end of the decade, but its purpose is more related to the 'past' than the 'present'
 isliye homer aadhunik filmon kaa flashbek-technic kaa upyog karata he
 The epic begins in the 10th year, when Odysseus Apsara begins a voyage from the island of Kelipso, and his fractal vessel sinks and flows into the land of Nasica
 vahaan ke raja ko apane 9 varshon kii ram kahani sarg 9 se 12 tak main sunaata he
 The 'PRE-MEMORY' technique is in this 9th to 12th cantos
 parantu is purv smriti ke garbh main bhi ‘antahpurv smriti’ he 11wein sarg main, jab vah ekiles ko try yuddh kii katha kaa sheshansh sunaata he
 The time organization of Odyssey is very complicated
 ‘vartmaan’ ke garbh main ‘purv’ evam us purv ke garbh main ‘antahpurv’ nihit he
 The entire period can be termed as 'mukul-patra-bandh'
 kali main pankhudiyon kii ek parat ke andar duusari parat, duusari ke andar teesri parat padi rahati he
 In the same way, there is a time lag for Odessi
 yah kaal-bandh dvigun pechida isliye ho jaataa he ki odesi kaa ‘desh’ ek nahin he
 The theme of Odyssey is 'fierce Seascape and Cavitation'
 atah vyapaar ke kendra do ho jate hai
 One is Ithaca where her queen Pinilopy is waiting for her and her sons and sisters are surrounded by her enemies
 doosraa he odesius swayan evam uski samudr-sataha par kii chalyman sthiti

 There are three main mechanisms of decreasing CD4 + t levels as a result of HIV infection: first, the direct bacterial termination of infected cells; Second, the increased rate of apoptosis in the infected cell; And termination of infected CD4 + t cells by a CD8 cytotoxic lymphocyte identifying the third infected cell
 When the number of CD4 + t cells falls below a required level, cell-mediated immunity is eliminated and the body is more likely to suffer from opportunistic infections

 To successfully reproduce itself, HIV is required to convert its RNA genome into DNA, which is then imported into the center of the host cell and inserted into the host genome through the function of HIV integrase

 The failure of candidate vaccines to provide protection against HIV infection and AIDS has once again resulted in a focus on the bio-mechanisms responsible for HIV latency

 It is estimated that without treatment, the net median time of survival after infection with HIV is 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype, and based on studies, in places with limited resources where treatment is not available
 Among them, the median of survival rate after diagnosis of AIDS is between 6 and 9 months

 As new therapies continue to develop and HIV also continues to develop resistance against these treatments, changes in survival-related estimates are likely to continue

 In 1983, two preliminary research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luke Montagnier independently declared that a new retrovirus had been infecting AIDS patients and published their findings in the same edition of the journal Science
 gallo ne daawa kiya ki unke samooh dwaara aids ke ek marij ke sharir se ek vishaanu ko alag kiya he, jiskaa aakaar ascharyajanak rup se anya human tii-limphotropic virus ke samaan he, jise unke samooh ne hi sabase pahal alag kiya tha
 This new virus, separated from him by Gallo's group, was named HTLV-III
 usee samay, montagnier ke samooh ne gardan kii linfadenopathy main sujan) or shaareerik kamajori, aids ke do paaramparik lakshan, pradarshit kar rahe ek marij ke sharir se ek vishaanu ko alag kiya
 Opposing Gallo's group's report, Montagnier and his colleagues demonstrated that the basic proteins of the virus differed immunologically from the basic proteins of HTLV-I
 montagnier ke samooh ne unke dwaara alag kiye gayi is vishaanu ko linfadenopathy-associated virus naam diya
 It has been a subject of much debate as to who among Gallo or Montagnier should get more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS
 apane saathi francoise baire-sinosi ke saath, montagnier ko unki “human defeshiency virus kii khoj ke liye” 2008 main sharir-kriya vigyaan yaa chikitsa ke kshetra ke nobel puraskaar kaa aadha bhaag diya gaya
 Harald Zur Hausen also shared the award for his discovery that the human papilloma virus is the cause of cervical cancer, but Gallo was released
 gallo ne kaha ki sah-praptakarta ke rup main unhen namit na kiya janaa “niraashajanak” he
 Montagnier said he was "surprised" that Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel committee: "it was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS and that Gallo had an important role in it
" mujhe robert gallo se puri hamadardi he
 " kuch log, kuch aise vaigyanikon sahit, jo echivi ke manyata-praapt visheshgy nahin hai, echivi or aids ke bich sambandh, swatah echivi ke hi astitv, athwa echivi ke pareekshan or upachaar kii vidhiyon par prashnchihn lagaate hai
 These claims, known as AIDS rejectionism, have been investigated and debunked by the world's scientific community, although they have had a political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government Officially propagating AIDS rejectionism was responsible for the country's ineffective response to the AIDS epidemic

 The story of Halo begins in the twentieth century where the player plays the game from the perspective of Master Chiff, a cybernetically enhanced soldier
 khiladi ke saath cortana naam kii artificial intelligence saathi ke rup main hoti he jo uske neural interphes se judy hoti he
 The player fights with various aliens as well as unravel the mysteries of the mysterious halo, a ring-shaped artificial world
 helo ko "sikhane me aasaan" or isaki kahani ko aakarshak kaha gaya he
 Many game magazines have hailed Halo as a great and important game
 game kii kamyaabi or lokapriyata ne kai naam jaise helo killer or helo clon ko janm diya he jo helo se behatar yaa samaan bane he
 Due to the success of Halo, two parts of Halo 2, Halo 3 and a full part of Halo: Reach have been created and a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was released in 2011

 jab dhaal puri tarah se samaapt ho jaati he to khilaadi behad kamazor ho jaataa he or aage kii kshati ko sidhe charitra ke swasthya str main lagu kiya jaataa he
 In general, if any further damage is halted for a brief period, the shield refills
 helo main vividh prakaar ke vigyaan katha par aadhaarit hathiyaar uplabdh he
 Each weapon in the game has been praised for giving it a unique purpose, thus making them useful in different scenarios
 udhaaharan ke liye, plasma hathiyaaron ko thanda hone ke liye samay lagata he yadi unhe lagaataar chalaaya jaae, saath hi unhe punah lod nahin kiya ja saktaa he or bydaree kii kami par khaarij karnaa padataa he
 Conversely, traditional weapons are not heated, but require reload and ammunition
 khilaadi keval do hathiyaar ek baar main le saktaa hai, is prakaar, ek ranneeti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jab hatiyaaro ko chunane va chalaane kii baari aati he
 There is no need to throw grenades in the halo or drop the weapon during the melee, this can be done with both the arms in the hand
 chiff apane saath aath hathgole le saktaa he, chaar plasma or chaar fragmentation
 Both types of grenades work differently like other weapons in the game
 plasma grenade chipak jaataa he va fragmentation grenade chizo se takaraane par uchhal jaataa he
 The main enemy force of the game is the covenant which is a group of species associated with belief in a common religion
 iname ilite, jo bhayankar yoddha hote he or khiladi kii tarah khud kii urja dhaal dwaara sangrakshit hote he; grant, jo sankshep main, kaayar jeev hote he or aamtaur par iliton ke netritv main rahete hai or jo aksar aatank main ladane ke bajaay bhaag khadey hote he; jaikal, jo apane haathon main behad tikaoo urja dhaal pahante hai; or hanter jo moti kavach platon ke saath bade or shaktishaalee jeev he
 The second enemy is the Flood, a parasitic alien life form and appears in three main types
 sankraman rup, jo flad kaa asli rup he, najuk hote he par bady taadaad main aane par kshati pahunchaa sakate hai
 Combat forms are humans and ilites, who fall prey to infection

 a Starship Pillar of Autm escaped in Reich's battle with Spartan Lidar Master Chiff

 Tabhi attacks a Pillant of the Pillar of Autumn and destroys it

 Kies crash land but are caught by the covent

 After being rescued, the Keys master Chiff to find the main center of the halo so that he can know its purpose
 master chiff or cortana silt cartographer naamak nakshe vaale kendra me pahuchate he jo unhe mukhya kendra me lejaata he
 There Cortana enters Halo's system, but for some reason immediately sends Master Chiff to find Captain Kies and himself stays in the system
 apane commander ki khoj ke dauraan master chiff ko pataa chalata he ki kovanants ne galati se fluds ko azaad kar diya he

 When Master Chiff goes to use Idex and use it, Cortana comes and warns him not to activate Halo
 cortana ne yah pataa kar liya hota he ki helo ki raksha pranali akashganga me maujud sabhi jivit vastuo ko mitaane ke liye bani he, jisaki zaroorat fluds ko failane ke liye chahie hoti he
 When it is asked about 343 gilt sparks, it states that the range of this halo is only twenty five thousand light years but when it becomes active, the rest of the center will be activated, which will destroy all living things
 is scchai kaa pataa chalate hi master chiff or cortana helo nasht karne kaa tay karte hai
 While fighting the Floods, Covenants and Sentinels of 343 Guilty Spark, Cortana comes to notice that the easiest way to destroy the Halo is to auto-destruct the crashed Pillar of Autum
 par aisa karne ke liye unhe captain kiz ki praadhikruti chahie
 By the time Master Chiff reaches Keez, it is late and Kiz is completely under the control of the Floods
 master chiff unhe maar kar unke neural implatan nikaal let he or cortana ship kaa self distrakshan seqvence chaalu kar detii he
 But then 343 guilt sparks stop counting and together we learn human history

 a molecule of water can form a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can give and take two hydrogen atoms
 hydrogen fluoride, methanol or ammonia jaise anya anu bhi hydrogen band banaate hai lekin ve thermodinemic, gatyaatmak yaa sanrachanaatmak gunon ke visham vyavhaar ko pradarshit nahin karte jaisaa ki jal main dekha jaataa he
 The clear distinction between water and other hydrogen bonding liquids, lies in the fact that no hydrogen bonding molecule other than water can form four hydrogen bonds and is either due to an inability to give / accept hydrogen
 Or a large amount of residual may have steric effects
 jal main chaar hydrogen band ke kaaran utpann sthaneey tetrahedral kram ek khuli sanrachana or ek 3 aiami bonding network ko janm detaa he, jo 4 °C se neeche thanda kiye jane par ghanatv main visham kami ko falit karata he
 Although hydrogen bonding is a relatively weak attraction compared to covalent bonds within the water molecule, it is responsible for many physical properties of water

 Another surface tension is the capillary wave, which forms around the bearing of water droplets on the surface and sometimes flows over the surface in the form of strong currents
 prishth tanaav ke kaaran utpann pratyasthata, keshika lahar ko janm detii he
 Due to the mutual forces of adhesion and surface tension, water exhibits capillary action under which water rises up in a narrow tube, against the force of gravity
 jal, tub kii andari diwaar se laga rahata he or satahi tanaav sataha ko sidhaa rakhte hue use upar uthaata he or sanshakti ke madhyam se or adhik jal upar khinch liya jaataa he
 This process continues until the water flows into the tube and then later the gravitational force balances the adhesive hair
 satahi tanaav or keshika kriya, jeev vigyaan main mahatvapurn hai
 For example, when water is carried up into plants through the xylem, strong inter-molecular attraction holds the parts of the water together and maintains adhesion properties, water affinity to the xylem and by transpiration
 Stress that occurs prevents the breakdown

 The partially negative dipole ends of water are attracted to the positively charged components of the solute, and the exact opposite is applied to the positive dipole ends
 saamanytah, ynic or dhruviya padaarth jaise, acid, sharaab or namak, jal main apekshaakrit ghulansheel hai or gaiyr-dhruviya padaarth jaise vasa or tel nahin hai
 Non-polar molecules stay together in water because it is more favorable for water molecules to drop hydrogen from each other, rather than to engage in van der Waal contact with non-polar molecules
 ynic viley kaa ek udhaaharan he teble namak; sodium chloride, nacl, jo Na+ kaishan or Cl- yanon main alag ho jaataa he, jisamen se prayek jal ke anu se ghira rahata he
 The ions are then easily transported away from their crystalline lattices

 is tarah ke dishtakaari main e-si kaa aadha bhaag hi lod main bheja jaataa he jabaki baaki aadha hissaa lod main jane se roak diya jaataa he
 It is used only for very low power output, not for much power
 kyonki yah bahut kam dakshata se vidyut-shakti kaa hastaantaran karata he
 Half-wave rectifiers in a phase circuit can be made using only one diode
 
 It takes three diodes for a three-phase supply
 voltage regulation = acha Average voltage = v max / pie ausat dhara = ai maiks / pai RMS voltage or effective voltage = v max / 2 aaremes dhara yaa prabhavi dhara = ai maximum / 2 Efficiency = 40

286 PIV = Vmax Output frequency = f_in is tarah kaa dishtakaari input asi ke dono bhaagon ko lod main bhejtaa he or lod main ek hi disha main dhara sunishchit karata he
 It is clear that it is more efficient than half-wave rectifier
 ek-phej paripathon main do tarah ke purna-tarang dishtakaari prayog kiye jate hai: Center-tap rectifier requires only two diodes, but this requires a center-tap transformer
 During the positive cycle of center tap / midpoint rectifier-supply, diode D1 becomes forward bias and behaves like a closed key
 This diode D2 sleeps reverse bye and behaves like an open key, diode D2 forward bias sleeps off key during the negative cycle of the supply In the meantime, diode D1 becomes reverse bias and behaves like an open key
 Average voltage = 2vmax / fhai average current = two imax / jab adhik shakti kaa disi kii aavashyak hoti he to ek-feji vidyut shakti ke bajaay teen-feji asi ko ractifi karnaa adhik upyukt rahata he

 rujukari, input asi ko bahut adhik aavriti par band-chaalu karke disi banaate hai
 This causes the ripple frequency in the output DC to be very high and the current taken from the input AC is also almost sine-shaped
 aajkal adhik aavriti par band-chaalu kiye ja sakane vaale mossphate or aijibiti aadi swichon kii sulabhta ke kaaran is prakaar ke rujukari upyog main aane lage hai
 The output of the ripple in which the frequency of ripple is high, the value of l and c required to filter it will be less
 isi liye adhik shakti kii disi banane ke liye 12-pulse, 24-pulse yaa 48-pulse ke rujukari upyog main laaye jate hai

 o
 henry yaa wiliam sidney porter prasiddh american lekhak the
 He was born on September 11, 1862 in Greensboro, North Carolina and died on June 5, 1910 in New York
 pichley varshon main vah apana bich kaa naam 'sidney' hi likhaa karte the
 He left school at the age of sixteen, but his acuity to read and write was not lost
 bachapan main unhone greensbaro kii ek dawaaiyon kii dukaan main kaam kiya tha, jahaan ab tak uski jainti manaayi jaati he
 At the age of nineteen, he went to live in the area of texas to improve his health
 vahaan usne ghudsawaari sikh lee or junglee, adiyal ghodo ko bhi vash main karne laga
 Then he got a job in a farm office in Austin
 aapane aas-paas ke chitramay jivan kii jin vastuon kaa bhi use parichay hua, ve sab kii sab uski kahaniyon main chhan aayin
 This is the reason why his stories occur mostly in pasture territories, Central America or New York
 shahari jivan kii kahaniyon main jinke liye vah prasiddh he, jivan kii vidmbanaaon kisvikrati hai
 They are a reflection of their own bitter experiences
 apane pandraa varsh ke jis texas pravaas main unhone vivaah kiya or ek putree ke pita bane, usee main khedjanak ghataanaon ne unki umango ko dhank liya
 He got the job of counting the notes in a bank, but within a few days he came to know of a mess of a few thousand dollars in his account, he also missed the job
 aansa lagata he ki uske maalik use sajaa dilaanaa nahin chaahate the, isliye vah bina roak-tok, lagbhag ek varsh tak huston shahar ke ek akhbaar main kaam karata rahaa
 Then, he probably moved to New Orleans to avoid arrest, from where he took tickets for Tojillo and Honduras
 'cabejas and kings' naamak uski sarvapratham pustak main varnit, saahas or jeevat kii sari kahaniyon kaa ghatnasthal yaheen se mila he
 His wife's illness called him back to Austin
 unke lautate hi vah mar gayi
 Then he was tried and convicted for the crime of Khayanat
 wiliam porter, teen varsh or teen maheenon tak jail main rahe
 He was an ardent prisoner with an enthusiastic conviction
 lekin uske jivan par is kaal kii kaali chaaya hameshaa dikhaai padati rahi
 It was here that he developed compassion for the poor and this led to many of his best stories, out of which a play called 'alias jimmy Ballantine', based on the story 'heart Transformation', proved to be the best drama of the time
 jail casipaahiyon ke oran henry naamak captain ne hi uske upnaam ko khoj nikaala gaya he
 Porter thought that 'O Henry' was enough to sign
 unhone jab likhnaa shuru kiya to sampadakon se apana naam gupt rakhane kii bhi prarthana kii
 In New York, O
 Henry lived in the rooms of the neighborhoods of Madison Square and Irving Place and struggled fiercely to pay rent, earning money from his stories
 rabart ech0 davis, bartlet maaris, irvin es0 kaab aadi mitron ne or duusare kai likhkon or sampadakon ne unke kamaron kaa varnan kiya he
 They lived in an outside room
 jisaki khidkiyaan farsh tak faili hui thim,
 Sitting here, he would stare at the passersby and weave around them a net of creatures
 unhone ashaavadi, ekanki saamaanya vyaktiyon ko apni kahaniyon ke paatr bananaa shuru kiya
 Imagined girls who roam the cities to find business and love; Those young men who seek more advantages than others and drunken and unworthy men, who also suffer misfortune with arrogance and sometimes display sentimentality like the characters of the stories, become the storyline
 yadi kathavstu dukhaant hui to o0 henry usamen sthaneey boliyon kaa namak-mirch laga detaa
 No incident was so dull for him in which he could not shine
 thik isi jagah aakar usne us charam bindu yaa mode kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase uski anek kahaniyon kaa ant apratyaashit banane laga
 This is evident in short stories such as "decorated room," "roof room" and "spring menu", some larger stories also show this element
 america ke shrotao me, puraane jamaane ke aag ke chaaro ore baithkar kahaniyaan sunne ke yug se, is prakaar ke kisson ke prati vishesh lagaav rahaa he
 The stories of O
 Henry seem to be elaborate replicas of these traditional stories
 kathanak ke to vah jaadugar the or ansi-ansi kalpanarmya paristhitiyaan nirmaan karane main vah siddhhast the, jahaan uske paatr jeevanajite nahin balki usase khilwaad karte prathit hote he
 It was his intention to entertain the readers and to get his curiosity awakened, he has done various types of slapstick by his students
 ve romance ke bhukhe, bure vakt kaa himmat se muqabla karne vaale, kuleenata kaa dhong karne vaale or aadhunik 'alif-laila' kii rangeen duniya main vicharne vaale chitrit kiye gayi hai
 He has hardly done any detailed and sagopang analysis of man
 unhone to manushya kaa, aadhunik shahari jivan ke bhavar main fase hue, asahaay vyakti ke rup main hi, darshan karaayaa
 Nansi of the 'sneh Deep' story simply refuses to accept a shopkeeper as a girl because she works in a shop and says, "there is no such thing
" aaj ke bhrasht samaaj ko kism khojane kii aadat pad gayi he
 "he may have depicted a man so fallen that he is not even ashamed of his weaknesses
 uski sab kahaniyon ke neeche sahrudayta or sahanubhuti kii anterdhara bah rahi he
 He was always ready to give a place in the wider family of humanity to every ill-fated or backward person in life
 kabhi-kabhi ve uskaa manoranjan karte hai, kabhipane jivan kii vidmbanaaon se use dukhi kar dete he or kabhi vah bhavuk bhi ho uthta ahi parantu har haalat main, vah bhagya kii har chhedchhad ko sweekaar kar letehai or uske khalanaayak bhi haasyaaspad hi ho pate hai- dusht nahin
 O
 Henry's art flourished in his second book, The Four Million, which also gained him much popularity
 pratham baar prakashit hone ke chalis varsh baad, uski 'uphaar' naamak kahani kaa chalchitr bana
 Many compilations of his other stories were published such as 'sneh Deep', 'spirit of the West', 'voice of the City', 'bhagyachakra', 'choices', 'dhandhe Ki Baat', 'life Cycle'
 uski mratyu ke baad teen kitaaben or chhapin- 'safedposh thag', 'aawaara' or 'bhuule-bhatke'
