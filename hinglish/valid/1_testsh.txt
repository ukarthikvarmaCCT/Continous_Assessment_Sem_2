ani bessent ke samarthak bhi ab kasmasaane lage
 They were not ready to wait until September
 unhone ani bessent par dabaav daalkar homerul group kii sthapana karne kii ijaajat le lee
 Jamnadas Dwarkadas, Shankarlal Baker and Indulal Yagnik started a newspaper 'young India' in Bombay and started collecting funds from all corners of the country to bring out papers in English and regional language
 ani bessent ne sitambar tak intjaar kiya
 The Congress was completely inactive
 unhonen bhi homerul lig kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kar di or apane samarthak george arundell ko sanghathan sachiv niyukt kiya
 Tilak and Annie Besant also divided the work areas for their respective leagues, so that there is no mess
 tilak kii lig karnataka, maharashtra, madhyaprant or baraar kii jimmevary thi
 The rest of the country was responsible for the league of Anne Besant
 in donon ne apana vilay nahin kiya
 The reason was that some of Annie Besant's supporters did not like Tilak and some of Tilak's supporters Annie Besant, but there was no quarrel between them
 tilak ne maharashtra kaa daura kiya
 Preached the Homeroom movement a lot
 janata ko samajhaayaa ki isaki jarurat kyon he, iske uddeshy kya hai
 In his words, "india is like a son who is young
" samay kaa takaza he ki baap yaa paalak is bete ko uskaa vaazib haq de de
 The Indian public must now take the rights
 unhen iskaa puraa adhikaar he
 "tilak linked the demand of education and linguistic states in the regional language with the demand of 'swaraj'
 unhonen kaha ‘‘marathi, telugu, kannada tathaa anya bhashaaon ke aadhaar par praanton ke gathan kii maang kaa arth hi he shiksha kaa madhyam kshetray bhashaa ho
 Do the British teach French to their people here
 kya german apane logon kii angreji main shiksha dete he yaa turk french main shiksha dete he
 At the provincial conference of Bombay in 1915, Tilak proposed a condolence on Gokhale's death

 alur iskaa samarthan karne ke liye jaise hi khadey hue tilak ne kaha ‘‘kannada bhashaa kaa adhikaar jataane ke liye kannada main bolie
 "this shows that Tilak Kshetraya was not Marathi parochialism
" chuaachhut or gaiyr brahmanon ke maamalon me tilak jativaadee nahin the
 non-brahmins of Maharashtra once sent a separate memorandum to the government that they had nothing to do with the demands of the upper classes
 to kai logon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 But Tilak explained to these protesters, you guys should be patient
 yadi ham unhen yah samajha saken ki ham unke saath hai or unki maang tathaa hamaari maangon me koi fark nahin he, to mujhe pakkaa vishwaas he ki asamanta mitaane ke liye chhidaa unka aandolan hamaare sangharsh se jud jayega’’ unhone gaiyr brahmanon ko samajhaayaa ki jhagada brahmanon or gaiyr-brahmanon kaa nahin he bhed shikshit or ashikshit ke bich he
 Is more educated than Brahmins and non-brahmins
 isliye gaiyr-brahmanon kii vakaalat karanevaali sarkaar bhi majaboor hokar sarkari naukariyon main brahmanon ko hi bharti karti he
 The government, despite its autocratic attitude towards the Brahmins, is giving them a place in the administration because it believes that only educated people can run the administration
 chuaachhut unmoolan ke liye yojit ek sammelan main tilak ne kaha tha, ‘‘yadi bhagwaan bhi chuaachhut ko bardaasht karen, to main bhagwaan ko nahin maanunga
 '' tilak ke us samay die gaye bhaashanon main kahin se bhi dharmik apil nahin jhalkati
 The demand for home rule was completely based on secularism
 tilak kaa kahana tha ki angrejon se virodh kaa kaaran yah nahin he ki vah kisi duusare dharm ke anuyaayi he, unka virodh to ham isliye karte he kyonki ve bhartiya janata ke hit main koi kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 In the words of Tilak, "english or Muslim, if he works for the benefit of the people of this country, then he is not alien to us
" is paraepan kaa dharm yaa vyavsaay se koi rishta nahin he
 This is a question directly related to interests
 tilak ne chah marathi tathaa do angreji parache nikaal kar apane prachaar kaary ko or tej kar diya
 47 thousand slips of these leaflets were sold
 baad me in parchon ko gujarati or kannada bhashaa me chapa gaya
 Six branches of the league were formed
 madhya maharashtra bombay nagar, karnataka or madhyaprant main ek-ek tathaa baraar main do
 As the Homerul movement started gaining momentum, the government intensified the repressive action
 is aandolan par waar karne ke liye sarkaar ne ek vishesh din chunaa
 23 July 1916 was Tilak's 60th birthday
 ek bade sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya or tilak ko ek lakh rupye kii thili bhent kii gai
 The government gave him a second reward on the occasion
 unhen ek kaaran bataao notice diya gaya
 In which it was written that why should you not be banned due to your activities
 unhen saath hajaar rupye kaa muchalaka bharne ko kaha gaya
 Perhaps the most important gift was for Tilak
 unhonen kaha, ‘‘ab homerul aandolan jangal main aag kii tarah failega
 Government repression will provoke the insurgency
 ’’ An entire team of lawyers led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah fought on behalf of Tilak
 magistrate kii adaalat main to tilak mukaddama haar gaye par navambar main unhen hoicourt ne nirdaash qaraar diy
 This victory was appreciated by all
 gandhi ne ‘yang-india’ akhbaar main likhaa, ‘‘yah abhivyakti kii aazaadee kii bahut badi jeet he
 Homerule is a great success for the movement
 ’’ is avasar kaa tilak ne phayda uthaaya or apane saarvajanik bhaashanon main kehane lage ki homerul yaa swashaasan kii maang vyakt karne ke liye sarkaar ne anumati de di he
 Tilak and his associates expedited the campaign and by April 1917 they had made 14 thousand members
 ani bessent kii lig ne bhi sitambar 1916 se kaam karnaa shuru kar diya par unka sanghathan bahut dhilaa tha
 Any three persons could open a branch anywhere, whereas the organization of the League of Tilak was very strong, the work and work of all the six branches were scheduled to take place
 ani bessent kii lig kii do sau shakhaayen thim
 Many branches were in towns and cities, in other villages, a few villages came under one branch

 Annie Besant's league lagged behind member in comparison to Tilak's league
 march 1917 tak unki lig ke sadasyon kii sankhya keval 7000 thi
 Jawaharlal Nehru, B
 Chakraborty and J

 Banerjee also joined it
 philhal shakhaon kii ginati se lig kii takat kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he, kyonki inamen se kuch to kaaphi sakriy bhi or kuch niskriy, kyonki ve zyaadaatar ‘theosophical sosayadi’ kii gatividhiyon tak simit thi
 As an example, Madras city had the largest number of branches, but branches in the cities of Bombay, Uttar Pradesh and rural areas of Gujarat were quite active
 haalanki inaki sankhya kaaphi kam thi
 a quantum goal of all these activities was to launch a large-scale movement to demand homerul
 iske liye raajnneetik shiksha dena or raajnneetik bahes chhedana bahut jaruri tha
 Through 'new India', Arudel raised political debate, set up libraries providing information about national politics to his supporters, organized classes to impart political education to students, argued among friends in support of 'homerul' and He asked to work for participation in the movement
 kai shakhaon ne in par amal kiya
 Particular attention paid to political debate
 homerul kaa prachaar kitna tej hua iskaa andaaj isi tathy se laga sakate hai ki sitambar 1916 tak prachaar fund se chaape janevaale teen lakh parche baante ja chuke the
 This publicity fund was established a few months ago
 in parachon main tatkaaleen sarkaar kaa kaccha chittha hota tha or swaraj ke samarthan main tark die jate the
 After the establishment of the League of Anne Besant, these leaflets were printed again
 kai kshetray bhashaaon main bhi inkaa prakaashan hua
 Simultaneously, the order of public meetings and speeches continued
 jab bhi kisi mudde ko lekar deshvyapee pratirodh kaa aahvaan kiya jaataa tha, lig kii sari shakhaayen iskaa samarthan karti
 In November 1916, when Annie Besant was banned from moving to Berar and Central Provinces, on Arudel's appeal, all branches of the League organized protest meetings and sent protest proposals to the Viceroy and the Home Secretary
 isi tarah 1917 main jab tilak par punjab or dilli jane par pratibandh lagaaya gaya to puure desh main virodh baithken huin
 All branches of the League strongly opposed it
 kaan gres kii akarmanyata se kshubdh anek narampanthi kaan greysi bhi homerul aandolan main shaamil ho gaye
 Gokhale's 'servant of India Society' was not allowed to become a member of the League, but he supported the 'homerul Movement' by giving speeches and publicizing it among the public
 uttarapradesh main anek narampanthi rashtravaadiyon ne congress sammelan kii taiyaari ke silsile main homerul lig ke kaaryakrttaaon ke saath gaan wo, kasbon kaa daura kiya
 Most of their meetings took place in the libraries of local courts, where students, businessmen and people from other professions would gather
 or agar baithak kisi bazaar ke din hoti to isamen gaan von se aae kisaan bhi shariq hote
 In these meetings, the issue of poverty and disorder of India would be raised
 ateet kii samruththi kii yaad dilaai jaati or you rope ke swatantrata aandolan par prakaash daalaa jaataa, usase prerana lene kii apil kii jaati
 Hindi was used in these meetings
 narampanthiyon kaa home rule lig ko samarthan dena koi achraj kii baat nahin thim kyon ki lig narampanthiyon ke raajnneetik prachaar va shaiksh nik kaaryakramon ko hi amali jama pahana rahi thi
 The Lucknow session of the Congress in 1916 was a good opportunity for the members of the Home Rule League to show their strength
 tilak ke samarthakon ne to ek parampara hi bana di jis par congress bahut saal tak tiki rahi
 His supporters reserved a train to reach Lucknow, which some called 'congress Special', while some called 'homeroom Special'
 arudel ne lig ke har sadsy se kaha tha ki vah lakhanu adhiveshan kaa sadsy banane kii har sambhav koshish karen
 Tilak was again included in the Congress at the Lucknow Congress session
 adhyaksh ambikacharan majumdaar ne kaha- In this session, the important 'grace League' agreement, which is known as "lucknow Pact", was signed
 is samjhaute me ani bessent or tilak ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Many senior leaders including Madan Mohan Malaviya were totally against it
 unka aarope tha ki yah samjhauta muslim lig ko bahut tavajjo detaa he
 Tilak said on this charge, "there is an allegation by some great personalities that Hindus are giving more importance to their Muslim brothers
 main kahata hoon ki yadi swashaasan kaa adhikaar keval muslim samudaay ko diya jaae to mujhe koi etraj nahin hoga, rajdooton ko yah adhikaar mili to parvaah nahin, hindustan ne kisi bhi samudaay ko yah adhikaar de diya jaae hamen koi aitraaj nahi
 This statement of mine represents the national spirit of Samu Chi
 jab bhi aap kisi teesri party se lard rahe hote hai, to sabase jaruri hoti he, aapasi ekta, jaateey ekta, dharmik ekta or vibhinn raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon kii ekta
 '' tilak ko bahut adhik roodhiwaadee hindu mana jaataa tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of Indian oriental learning
 jab unhone is tarah kaa bayaan diya, to kisi or kaa virodh karne kii himmat nahin hui
 However, it was controversial for Muslims to accept the principle of separate constituencies
 lekin yah isliye sweekaar kiya gaya ki yahi alpsankhyakon ko yah na lage ki bahusankhyak un par prabhutv sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 The Lucknow session raised the demand for constitutional reforms again
 sadasyon kaa maananaa tha ki swarajya ke lakshya kii prapti main yah maang sahaayak hogi
 Although this demand did not include all those things, as the members of the Home Rule League wanted, they did not raise any dispute on this
 ve har haal main congress main ekta banaae rakhana chaahate the
 Tilak made another proposal that an executive committee should be formed to give realization to the decisions and programs of the Congress session
 par narampanthiyon ke virodh ke kaaran yah prastaav manjuur na ho sakaa
 In fact, Tilak wanted the Congress not to remain idle, to do a little more work
 tilak kaa prastaav to manjuur na ho paaya, par chaar saal baad jab 1920 main mahatma gandhi ne kanges samvidhan ko sanshodhit kar use nayaa rup diya-ek aisa swaroop jo kisi aandolan ko lambe samay tak chalaane ke liye jaruri tha-to unhonen bhi tilak ke isi prastaav ko maananaa jaruri samajha
 Soon after the conclusion of the Congress session, both the Home Rule Leagues met in the same pandal
 jisamen lagbhag ek hajaar pratinidhiyon ne bhaag liya
 The Congress League agreement was appreciated and Tilak and Annie Besant addressed the meeting
 lakhanu se lautate samay in donon netaaon ne uttar, madhya or purvi bharat ke anek kshetron kaa daura kiya
 It was natural for the government to be concerned about the increasing influence of the Home Rule movement
 madras sarkaar jaraa zyada hi kathor ho gai
 He banned students from attending political meetings
 puure pradesh main iskaa virodh hua
 Tilak said, "the government knows that the feeling of patriotism makes students more excited

 The proposal was sent to all Provincial Congress committees for approval
 baraar va madras kii congress samitiyaan to is par turant kaarywahi ke paksh main thim, lekin baaki samitiyaan koi nirnay karne se pehle thodaa intjaar karne ke paksh main thim
 At Gandhiji's behest, Shankarlal Backer and Jamnadas Dwarkaprasad assembled the signatures of a thousand people who wanted to meet Annie Besant in disguise of government orders

 Thus, the government repression further encouraged the movement, making the agitators more militant
 mantague ne apni diary main likhaa he, ‘‘shiv ne apni patni ko 52 tukdon main kaata, bharat sarkaar ne jab ani bessent ko giraftaar kiya, to uske saath thik aisa hi hua

 "this statement was the exact opposite of Marley's statement
 1909 main sanvaidhanik sudhaaron ko parliament main rakhte samay marle ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki in sudhaaron kaa uddeshy desh main swarajya kii sthapana katai nahin he
 The biggest advantage of Montague's declaration was that the demand of Homerul or Swaraj could no longer be called a traitor
 lekin iskaa arth yah bhi nahin tha ki british hukumat swaraj kii maang maanane ja rahi thi
 There was also a point in the declaration of Montague that self-government will be established only when its proper time comes and the time has come to decide whether or not it will come
 angreji hukumat ke liye itani chhut kaaphi thi
 It was clear that she was not going to hand over power to Indians in the near future
 philhal mantague kii ghoshnaa ke chalate sitambar 1917 main ani bessent ko reeha kar diya gaya
 At this time Annie Besant's popularity was at its peak
 disambar 1917 main congress ke vaarshik adhiveshan main tilak ke prastaav par unhen adhyaksh chun liya gaya
 But in 1918, Homerul was weakened due to many reasons, despite the huge success in 1917, this movement died
 ani bessent kii giraftaar se uttejit hokar narampanthi is aandolan main shaamil hue the, unki rihaai ke baad niskriy ho gaye
 The government had assured reforms
 in netaaon ko laga ki is aandolan kii jarurat nahin he
 Apart from this, he was also angry with the discussion of running a law prohibition movement
 isliye unhen sitambar 1918 ke baad se congress kii baithkon main hissaa lenaa chhod diya
 The announcement of reform plans in 1918 led to another rift in the nationwide camp
 kuch log ise jyon-kaa-tyon sweekaar karne ke paksh main the to kuch ise puri tarah naamanzoor karnaa chaahate the
 Some people believed that there are many shortcomings in it, but it should be tried
 in sudhaaron or shantipriy asahyog aandolan ke mudde par khud ani bessent duvidha main thi
 Sometimes she would call it wrong and sometimes because of pressure from her supporters

 There also seems to be a development in large size among the creeds of this caste

 Their teeth were not suitable for incision, but their teeth have a special type of blunt, with which the animals of this subclass broke and chewed their prey and their bones very easily

 We also find signs of living beings of this caste in the Eocene era
 is jati ke kravyadant ati pracheen shaf varg yaa khuravaale praaniyon ke shikaar par jivan nirvaah karte the
 At the end of these 'shaf' class beings, this line of cravings also gradually disappeared, and in the Eligocene, instead of these cravings, a new life resembled them, which was called Phisiped

 gaay, bail, bhens, bakrii, ghoda aadi paaltu pashuon ko khilaaye jane yogya sabhi chijen chaara yaa 'pashuchara' yaa 'pashu aahaar' kehalaatin hai
 The food which is fed to the animal in 24 hours, which contains food to meet its requirements, is called animal food
 jis aahaar main pashu ke sabhi aavashyak poshak tatv uchit anupaat tathaa maatra main upalavdh hon, use santulit aahaar kehete hai
 Scientifically, according to the body weight of milch animals, various elements of food such as protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins and water are required for its requirements such as sustenance, growth, and production
 pashuon main aahaar kii maatra uski utpaadakta tathaa prajnan kii avasthaa par nirbhar karti he
 The animal should get 2 / 3 part of the total diet with thick fodder and 1 / 3 part by mixing the grain
 mote chaare main dalhani tathaa gaiyr dalhani chaare kaa mishran diya ja saktaa he
 Increasing the amount of pulp feed in the diet can reduce the quantity of grains

 According to this, we can broadly divide the diet of adult milch animals into three classes
 yah aahaar kii vah maatra he jise pashu ko apane sharir ko swasth rakhane ke liye diya jaataa he
 It is used by the animal to maintain its body temperature in the proper range, for the necessary activities of the body such as digestion, transport, respiration, excretion, metabolism etc
 isse uske sharir kaa bajan bhi ek seemaa main sthir bana rahata he
 Whether the animal is in production or not, this diet has to be given to it, in the absence of it, the animal starts becoming weak, which affects its productivity and fertility
 is main desi gaay ke liye tuudi athwa sookhe ghaas kii maatra 4 kilo tathaa sankar gaay, shuddh nasl kii deshi gaay athwa bhens ke liye yah maatra 4 se 6 kilo tak hoti he
 Along with this, a mixture of grains is also given to the animal, the quantity of which is kept from 1 to 1
25 kg for the local native cow and 2
0 kg for the hybrid cow, pure breed indigenous cow or buffalo
 is vidhi dwaara pashu ko khilaane ke liye dane kaa mishran uchit avyavon ko thik anupaat main milakar bana hona aavashyak he
 For this, the herders themselves can make satisfactory animal grains by mixing the following components in the given proportions
 utpaadan aahaar pashu aahaar kii vah maatra he jise ki pashu ko jivan nirvaah ke liye die jane vaale aahaar ke atiri uske doodh utpaadan ke liye diya jaataa he
 In this, one kg of grain should be given in addition to the subsistence diet for production of 2
5 kg of milk for local cows whereas for hybrid / native milch cows / buffaloes this quantity is given for 2 kg of milk
 yadi haraa chaara paryaapt maatra main uplabdh he to har 10 kilo achche kism ke hare chaare ko dekar 1 kilo dana kam kiya ja saktaa he
 This will reduce the cost of animal feed and production will also be fine
 pashu ko dugdh utpaadan tathaa jivan nirvaah ke liye saaf pani din main kam se kam teen baar jarur pilaanaa chahie
 In the pregnancy of the animal, it is given an extra diet from the 5th month because after this period the growth of the unborn baby starts very fast
 atah garbh main pal rahe bachche kii uchit vruddhi va vikaas ke liye tathaa gaay / bhens ke agle byaant main sahi dugdh utpaadan ke liye is aahaar kaa dena nitant aavashyak he
 It should be given 1

75 kg for hybrid cows and buffaloes

 For this, the quantity of 3 kg in the animals of Jebu breed and 4-5 kg of grain in hybrid cows and buffaloes should be given in addition to the subsistence requirement of the animal

 Template: usgovernment udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year

 Compared to emission nebulae, reflection nebulae themselves do not form sufficient visible light lines, but rather reflect the light of their surrounding stars
 andhri yaa gahari niharikaayen visarit niharikaon jaisi hi hai, lekin unhen unke dwaara utsarjit yaa prativimbit prakaash dwaara nahin dekha ja saktaa
 iske bajaae, unhen dur ke taron yaa utsarjan niharikaon ke saamne ke gahare badalon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Although these nebulae appear differently on light waves, they are bright sources of emission on all infrared or infrared waves

 Planetary nebulae are nebulae formed from a gas-rich shell emanating from a low-moss asymptomatic massive branch star when it turns into a white dwarf
 ye niharikaayen, dhundhale utsarjan yukt utsarjit niharikaayen hai jo sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon jaisi hoti hai
 Technically, these are HII regions because most will be hydrogen ionized
 haalanki, grahon kii niharikaayen adhik ghani evam sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon kii apeksha adhik thos hoti hai
 Planetary nebulae have been given this name because the first astronomers who studied these objects thought that nebulae resembled the planets or discs of the planets, however, they are not related to planets
 ek proto planetary nebyal ek khagoleey vastu he, jo bhootpurv ananthasparshi vishaal shakha kii sthiti or uske baad ke grahon kii niharika ke charan ke bich ek taare ke twarit taarakeey kramik vikaas kaa alpakaaleen prakaran he

 piech yaa ph, kisi vilyan kii amlata yaa ksharakta kaa ek maap he
 It is defined as the co-logarithm of the activity of liquefied hydrogen ions
 hydrogen aayan ke gatividhi gunank ko prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he, isliye ve saidhantik gananaa par aadhaarit hote hai
 ph scale is not a fixed scale; It is concerned with a set of standard solutions whose ph is assessed by international contracts
 ph kii avadharana ko sabase pehle 1909 main carlsburg laboretry ke danish rasayanashastri, soren pedar luritz sorensen ne prastut kiya tha
 It is still unknown what the exact definition of p is
 kuch sandarbhon se pataa chalata he ki p, "power" kaa pratik he or anya ise german shabd "potenz" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai or abhi bhi anya ise "potential" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 Jens Norby published a paper in 2000 in which he argued that p is a constant and a symbol of "negative logarithm"; Which is also used in other works
 H, hydrogen kaa pratik he
 Sorensen suggested a "PH" signal for convenience that symbolized the "power of Hydrogen" using the co-logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, p
 yadhyapi is paribhaasha kaa adhikraman kar diya gaya he
 If an electrode is calibrated with a solution of known hydrogen ion concentrations, p can be measured
 shuddh jal ko tatasth mana jaataa he
 25 ° c But the ph of pure water is around 7
0
 7 se kam ph vaale solution ko amleey kaha jaataa he or 7 se adhik ph vaale solution ko ksharkeey yaa kshareey kaha jaataa he
 Measurement of ph has great importance in medicine, biology, chemistry, food science, environmental science, oceanography and many other applications
 ph ko ek jaleey solution main hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke dashamalav laghuganak ke ghataav ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Due to its logarithmic nature characteristic, ph is a dimensionless quantity
 jahaan a H, hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi he
 The reason for this definition is that a h is a property of a single ion that can only be measured experimentally with the help of an ion-selective electrode that reacts with the activity of a hydrogen ion according to the Nernst equation
 ph ko saadharantah ek sanyukt glass electrode kii sahaayta se mapa jaataa he jo hydrogen ke aayan kii gatividhi ke prati samvedansheel ek electrode or ek calomel electrode yaa ek silver chloride electrode jaise kisi riference electrode ke bich ke potential antar yaa electromotive bal, E, ko maapta he
 The combined glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation: jahaan E, ek mapa gaya potential he or e 0, maanak electrode potential arthath maanak avasthaa kaa electrode potential he jisamen gatividhi bhi ek he
 r is the gas constant; t is the Kelvin temperature; f is a Faraday constant and n is an example of the number of electrons transferred
 electrode potential, E, hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke laghuganak kaa samaanupati hota he
 This definition is completely impractical in itself because the activity, concentrations, and activity coefficients of hydrogen ions are the product
 hydrogen aayan ke ekal-aayan kii gatividhi kaa gunank, ek aisi quantity he jise prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 To get rid of this difficulty, the electrode is calibrated in relation to the solution of known activity
 ph kii sankriyaatmak paribhaasha ko aadhikarik rup main international standard ISO 31-8 ne nimna rup main paribhaashit kiya he: solution x ke liye, galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e x ko mapa jaataa he | Concentrated Solution of kcl || Solution x | H2 | Pt and then the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, ES, is also measured which is different from the above by substituting solution X, ph of unknown ph by solution s of known standard ph
 tab X, kaa ph hota he The difference between the ph of the solution x and the ph of the standard solution depends only on the difference between the two measured potentials
 is prakaar, ph ko ek potential se praapt kiya jaataa he jise ek electrode ke saath mapa jaataa he jo ek yaa ek se adhik ph maanakon ke vipareet anshakit hota he; ek ph meter setting ko is prakaar se samyojit kiya jaataa he ki maanak ke solution kii meter kaa pathan, ph maan ke baraabar hota he
 The ph values of a range of standard solutions S, along with further detailed information, are indicated in the IUPAC recommendation
 maanak solution ko praayah maanak bafer solution ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from the normality of Nernst's law in real electrodes
 dhyaan den ki chunki taapmaana, paribhaashit karne vaale samikarnon main paaya jaataa he, isliye solution kaa ph, taapmaana-aadhaarit hota he
 Special procedures are required to measure very low ph values, such as some very acidic mine waters
 aise maamalon main electrode kaa anshankan, sandrit salphurik acid maanak solution ke saath kiya ja saktaa he jiske ph maanon kii gananaa, gatividhi gunankon kii gananaa karne ke liye pitzar maapdandon kaa prayog karke kii ja sakati he
 ph is an example of an acidity function
 hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ko ajaleey solvents main mapa ja saktaa he lekin iske falswaroop ek bhinn amlata ke function kii prapti hoti he kyonki ajaleey solvent kii maanak sthiti, jal ke maanak sthiti se bhinn hoti he
 Supersides are a class of azoleic acids for which the function of Hammett acidity, h 0, has been developed
 yah sorensen kii mul paribhaasha thi jise ph ke paksh main adhikramit kiya gaya
 However, it is possible to directly measure the concentrations of hydrogen ions if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations
 ise karne kaa ek tarika, jo bade scale par prayukt hota rahaa he, yah he ki becoground electrolite ke ek apekshaakrit ucch sandratha kii upasthiti main strong kshar ke gyaat sandratha ke solution ke saath ek strong acid ke gyaat sandratha ke solution kaa anumaapan karnaa he
 Since the concentrations of acid and alkali are known, it is easy to calculate the concentrations of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with the concentrations
 Calibration is usually done using gran plots
 anshankan, ek slop factor, f or maanak electrode potential, e 0 ke liye ek maan utpann karata he taaki nernst sameekaran ko form Experimental measurements of e can be used to obtain hydrogen ion concentrations
 slop factor saamanytah ek se thodaa kam hota he
 a slope factor of less than 0
95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly
 becoground electrolite kii upasthiti yah sunishchit karata he ki anumaapan ke dauraan hydrogen aayan gatividhi gunank prabhavi dhang se sthir hota he
 Since it is constant, its value can be established by defining the standard state in a solution containing a background electrolyte
 is prakaar, is prakriya ke prayog ke parinamswaroop gatividhi ko sandratha ke sankhyatmak maan ke baraabar kiya jaataa he
 The difference between p and ph is very small
 yah kaha gaya he ki ph = p + 0

 durbhagyavash, donon prakaar ke maapan ke liye "ph" sangya kaa prayog karnaa bahut aam baat he
 poh is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of alkalinity or hydroxide ions, OH−
 poh ko swatantra rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he balki ise ph se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Concentrations of hydroxide ions in water, dwaara hydrogen yanon kii sandratha se sambandhit hota he jahaan KW, jal ke swa-ynikaran kaa sthiraank he
 The following co-logarithm is taken to, kamare ke taapmaana par poh ≈ 14 − ph
 haalanki mitti kii kshariyata ke maapan jaisi anya paristhitiyon main yah sambandh puri tarah se maanya nahin he
 Pure water has a ph of about 7; The exact value depends on the temperature
 jab ek acid kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se kam hoga or jab ek ksharak yaa kshar kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se adhik hoga
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par hydrochloric acid jaise kisi strong amla ke solution kaa ph, 0 hota he
 The ph of a strong alkali solution, such as sodium hydroxide, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 14
 is prakaar, maape gaye ph ke maan adhiktar 0 se 14 ke antargat hi hoga
 chunki ph, ek laghuganakeey scale he isliye ek ph ikai kaa antar, hydrogen aayan sandratha main das guna antar ke baraabar hota he
 As the glass electrode reacts to the activity, the electrode must be calibrated in a medium that is similar to the medium being investigated
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi samudri jal ke ek namoonay ke ph ko maapna chahta he to electrode ko ek aise solution main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jisaki rasinic sanrachana samudri jal ke sadrush ho, jiskaa vistrut varnan neeche diya gaya he
 An approximate measurement of ph can be achieved by using a ph indicator
 ek ph indicater ek aisa sabstens he jo ek vishesh ph maan ke aas-paas ke rang ko badal detaa he
 It is a week acid or week base and the color change occurs either in the acid dissociation constant around 1 ph unit or in the pk a value, either side of either
 udhaaharan ke liye, swaabhaavik rup se parivartit hone vaala litmus, acidic solution main laal or alkaline solution main nila ho jaataa he
 Universal indicators consist of a mixture of indicators in such a way that there is a continuous color change from about ph 2 to ph 10
 universal indicater patr, saamaanya patr he jisamen universal indicater shaamil hota he
 The solution which has a ph of 7 is called neutral i
e
 it is neither acidic nor basic
 Water is subject to a self-ionization process
 pruthakkaran sthiraank, k w kaa maan lagbhag 10−14 hota he isliye namak ke neutral solution main hydrogen aayan sandratha or hydroxide aayan sandratha donon lagbhag 10−7 mol dm−3 hote hai
 The ph of pure water decreases as the temperature increases
 udhaaharan ke liye, 50 °C par shuddh jal kaa ph, 6
55 hota he
 Note, however, that water exposed to air is slightly acidic
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jal, hawa se carbon dioxide ko avashoshit kar letaa he jo baad main dhire-dhire carbonic acid main badal jaataa he jo hydrogen aayan ko mukt karke pruthak kar detaa he: In the case of a strong acid, complete dissociation occurs so ph is generally equal to the logarithm subtraction of the acid concentration
 udhaaharan ke liye, hydrochloric acid ke ek 0
01 molr solution kaa ph, −log hota he arthath ph = 2
 The ph of a solution of one week acid can be calculated through the ICE table

 Although Vishnu's incarnation Krishna is mentioned in many Puranas, but in this Purana this subject is different
 'brahmavaivart puraana' main krishna ko hi 'parabrahm' mana gaya he, jinaki ichha se sristi kaa janm hota he
 The description of Sri Krishna Leela in the 'brahmavaivarta Purana' is quite different from 'bhagavata Purana'

 a hygienic or corneal is the transparent part of the eye that has outside light and is repelled
 yah aankh kaa lagbhag do-tihaai bhaag hota he, jisamen bahari aankh kaa rangeen bhaag, putali or lens kaa prakaash dene vaala hissaa hote hai
 There is no blood vessel in the cornea but a network of nerves
 isko poshan dene vaale dravya vahi hote hai, jo aansu or aankh ke anya paardarshee drav kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Often the cornea is compared to the lens, but there is a great difference from the lens
 ek lens keval prakaash ko apane par girane ke baad failaane yaa sicodne kaa kaam karata he jabaki cornea kaa kaary isse kahin vyapak hota he
 The cornea actually allows light to enter the eyeball
 iskaa uttal bhaag is prakaash ko aage putali or lens main bhejtaa he
 In this way it is very helpful in vision
 cornea kaa gumbadakaar rup hi yah tay karata he ki kisi vyakti kii aankh main duuradrushti dosha he yaa nikat drushti dosha
 When viewing, external lenses are used to focus the image on the lens of the eye
 isse cornea main badlaav aa saktaa he
 In this case, by installing an artificial contact lens near the cornea, its thickness is increased to a new focal point
 kuch aadhunik kaantect lens cornea ko dobaaraa iske vaastavik aakaar main laane ke liye dabaav kaa prayog karte hai
 This process lasts until the ambiguity is gone
 cornea camere kii lens kii tarah hota he jisase prakaash andar jaakar retina par padataa he iske baad chitra banataa he, jise drushti-dhamni vidyut sanket rup main mastishk ke upyukt bhaag tak pahunchaa detii he
 If the cornea is defective, the retina does not form and the person becomes blind
 kai baar ankhon main sankraman, chot yaa vitamin e kii kami ke kaaran bhi cornea kharaab ho jate hai
 Coronary defects are treated by surgical treatment
 ye oparation saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this, the surgeons complete this activity by sublimating the nerves attached to the cornea without shedding blood
 kabhi-kabhi oparation ke dauraan cornea par kisi bahari vastu se kharonch bhi lag jaati he yaa phir palak kaa hi koi bal tuutakar is par kharonch bana detaa he
 In this condition the cornea is cured within a few days with some eye liquid medicines
 bahut se log apana cornea daan kar dete hai taaki koi unki ankhon se yah duniya dekh sake
 This cornea donation is actually called eye donation
 netradaan karne vaale vyakti kii mrityu ke baad uske cornea ko nikaalkar mashin kii sahaayta se uski koshika ghanatv dekhi jaati he
 Having more than three thousand cells in an area of one square millimeter is the hallmark of a good cornea
 cornea ke oparation kaa prachlit sabase pehle italy main viksit kiya gaya tha
 Subsequently, it was adopted in the United States and later adopted worldwide
 is oparation main rogi ke ek daant or uske paas kii kuch haddi ko nikaal kar taraasha gaya or us main belanaakaar lens ko baitaane ke liye ek chhed kiya gaya
 The teeth, including the lens, are first transplanted under the skin of the patient's cheeks or shoulders for two months, so that they are well joined together
 baad main unhen vahaan se nikaal kar aankh main pratiropit kiya jaataa he
 For this, the pit of the eye is first prepared well
 aankh kii shleshma vaali parat main ek chhed kiya jaataa he, taaki lens thodaa-sa baahar niklaa rahe or aasapaas ke prakaash ko grahan kar sake
 In recent years, a new alternative is to make the intrastromal corneal ring uniquely made of plastic in such a way that it can sit inside the cornea
 inke dizin kuch is tarah se bane hote hanki ye cornea ko dobaaraa se khoi hui akruti waapas lautaate hai or drushti sudhaarte hai
 This transplant does not require the removal of corneal tissue
 isamen rogi ko thik hone main bhi adhik samay bhi nahin lagata he
 This new cornea transplant is a surgical procedure in which the discs of the cornea are removed and the donated tissue is applied
 haalanki ye safaltaapurvak ho jaataa he lekin ye bahut hi aaramdaayak hota he or thik hone main bahut samay lagata he

Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage made without the sovereign's acceptance shall be deemed "invalid", And that person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family
 18 veen or 19veen sadi ke dauraan britain ke aupniveshik vistaar dwaara, britain ne vishwa ke anya anek bhu-bhaagon ve kshetron par apana kabza jamaa liya
 Most of the countries achieved independence from Britain by the mid-20th century
 haalaanki un sabhi deshon ne united kingdom kii sarkaar kii adhipatyata ko nakaar diya, parantu unamem se kai raashtra, british shaasha ko apane adhirat ke rup main manyata dete hai
 These countries are called Commonwealth Territories or Commonwealth Praja Bhumi
 varttman kaal main, united kingdom ke adhirat keval united kingdom ke hi nahin balki uske atirikt kul 15 anya rashtron ke adhirat bhi hai
 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth countries other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St
 Lucia, St
 Kitts and Nevis, St
 Vincent and the Grenadines and Tuvalu Are included
 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he

 In 1672, at the place called Narnaul in present day Haryana, two brothers named Sadh Birbhan and Jogidas preached the Satnami Sadh Mat
 satnami saadh mat ke anuyaayi kisi bhi manushya ke saamne nahin jhukne ke siddhant ko maanate the

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 In Medina, Hazrat Muhammad had improved relations between the various existing communities
 The constitution of Madina specifying community relations was rewritten from Hazrat Muhammad's Salah, which led to the formation of an independent community, and the first Islamic state
 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In the Quran, Muhammad is also referred to as "ahmad"
 The law of universal brotherhood and the principle of human equality, which you proclaim, is a reflection of the great contribution that Hazrat Muhammad made to the social upliftment of humanity

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 sadakon kii disha yaa dhaal main parivartan laane ke liye, visheshkar jin sadakon par tej gaadiyaan chalane kii sambhaavna ho, bhalee bhanti aakalpit mode aavashyak hote hai
 There are basically two types of turns: horizontal turn and vertical turn
 kisi mukhya maarg par tej chalane vaali gaadi ke liye kshaitij disha main ekadam parivartan laana asambhav he, jabatak ki vah bilkul ruuk na jaae
 But if a suitable horizontal bend is made in the road, then the change of direction can be done respectively and with convenience, without experiencing the need to stop
 sadak jis chaal ke liye bani he or uski sataha jis prakaar kii he, inke upar hi kshaitij modo ke abhikalpan nirbhar hai
 Following are the minimum radii for different moves: aakalpit chaal 50, 40, 30, 20, mile prati ghanta Minimum radius of bend is 800, 500, 300, 250 feet mode par atirikt chaudaai 2, 3, 3, 4 phuton main Appropriate lifting should also be given in horizontal turns
 mode par gole kii chaudaai bhi badha deni chahie, jaisaa upar kii talika main dikhaaya he
 All turns must be of maximum feasible radius
 sadak ke sidhe bhaag par teji se chalati hui koi gaadi jab bhi mode main pravesh karti he, tab apkendri bal kii aakasmik kriya ke kaaran yatriyon ko kuch asuvidha kii anubhuti hoti he
 The smooth transition ensures a smooth transition between the straight section and the circular bend, so that road users do not feel uncomfortable in changing directions
 sadakon main sankrami mode kaa saamaanya rup sarpil hota he
 Wherever the gradient changes in the length of the road, the slope of the slopes should be rounded by giving a suitable vertical turn
 in mod se dhaal main parivartan sugam ho jaataa he, jisase tej chalanevaali gaadi main yatriyon ko asuvidha kii anubhuti nahin hoti or sadak kaa aage dur tak kaa maarg dikhaai detaa rahata hai
 In the estimation of vertical turns, these three things are considered, the distance required, how far it is necessary to appear forward and the slope of the truncation
 khadey mode akruti main praaia: paravalayik hote hai
 When the ridges are formed on the truncation, the bends are convex and when the cliffs form the valley, they are concave

 Aghor sect, Aghor sect or sect of Aghoris, is a sect of Hinduism
 iskaa paalan karne waalon ko 'aghori' kehete hai
 Its originator is believed to be Aghornath Shiva himself
 rudra kii murti ko shwetashwataropanishad main aghora vaa mangalamayi kaha gaya he or unka aghor mantra bhi prasiddh he
 Abroad, especially in Iran, such old views are also known and some scholars of the West have also discussed them
 henry balfor kii khojon se vidit hua he ki is panth ke anuyaayi apane mat ko guru gorakhnath dwaara pravartit maanate hai, kintu iske pramukh prachaarak motinath hue jinke vishay main abhi tak adhik pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Its three branches are famous by the names of Auaghar, Sarabhangi and Ghurre, the first of which was Kallusinh and Kaluram, who was the guru of Baba Kinaram
 kuch log is panth ko guru gorakhnath ke bhi pehle se prachlit batalaate hai or iskaa sambandh shaiva mat ke pashupat athwa kalamukh sampradaay ke saath jodate hai
 Baba Kinaram Aghori was born in the village of Samagarh in present-day Benaras district and lived in a depressed sense since childhood
 inhone pehle baba shivaraam vaishnav se diksha lee thi, kintu ve phir girnaar ke kisi mahatma dwaara bhi prabhavit ho gaye
 That Mahatma is often considered to be Guru Dattatreya, to whom he himself has made some signs
 ant main ye kaashi ke baba kaluram ke shishy ho gaye or unke ananthar krimikund par rahakar is panth ke prachaar main samay dene lage
 Baba Kinaram composed Viveksara, Gitavali, Ramgita etc
 inamen se pratham ko inhone ujjain main shipra ke kinare baithkar likhaa tha
 He died in 1826
 baba kinaaraam ne is panth ke prachararth ramgarh, deval, hariharpur tathaa krimikund par kramash chaar mathon kii sthapana kii jinamein se chauthaa pradhan centre he
 This cult is also commonly called 'ouddhpant'
 ‘viveksaar’ is panth kaa ek pramukh granth he jisamen baba kinaaraam ne atmaram kii vandana or apane aatmanubhav kii charchaa kii he
 According to him, there is truth or Niranjan which is present in all wide and prevalent forms and whose existence is a simple form
 granth main un angon kaa bhi varnan he jinamein se pratham teen main sristirahasy, kaayaparichay, pindbrahmad, anahatnaad evam niranjan kaa vivaran he; agle teen main yoga sadhana, niraalamb kii sthiti, aatmavichaar, sahaj samadhi aadi kii charchaa kii gai he tathaa shesh do main sampurna vishwa ke hi aatmaswaroop hone or aatmasthiti ke liye dayaa, vivek aadi ke anusaar chalane ke vishay main kaha gaya he
 Among its followers are people of all castes

 People who associate themselves with this cult by referring to themselves as 'aghori' or 'aughdar', are mostly seen embalming, eating corpse, drinking liquor in its skull, and behaving in disgusting things, which is probably the influence of Kapalikas
 Ho
 inke madiraa aadi seven kaa sambandh guru dattatreya ke saath bhi joda jaataa he jinka madkalash ke saath utpann hona bhi kaha gaya he
 Aghori is also similar in some respects to the beleaguered Jogi Aughdars who are counted among the early seekers of Nathpanth and who have no connection with the Aghor sect
 inamen nirvaani or grihasth donon hi hote hai or inaki veshbhusha main bhi sade athwa rangeen kapade hone kaa koi kadaa niyam nahin he
 Aghoris bear on the head, a garland of rhinestones in the neck and a skirt in the waist and a trident in the hand, causing the audience to fear

 Many of these compositions are available in plenty and they also throw a lot of light on the ideology of this branch
 aghor panth ke praneta bhagwaan shiv maane jate hai
 It is said that Lord Shiva himself propounded the Aghor cult
 avadhoot bhagwaan dattatreya ko bhi aghorshastra kaa guru mana jaataa he
 Avadhoot also considers Dattatreya to be an avatar of Lord Shiva
 aghor sampradaay ke vishwaason ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv in teenon ke ansh or sthool rup main dattatreya ji ne avatar liya
 Baba Kinaram is worshiped as a saint of the Aghor sect
 aghor sampradaay ke vyakti shiv ji ke anuyaayi hote hai
 According to him, Shiva is complete in himself and the root, Chetan exists in all forms
 is sharir or man ko saadh kar or jad-chetan or sabhi sthitiyon kaa anubhav kar ke or inhen jaan kar moksh kii prapti kii ja sakati he
 Aghor Sadhanas are performed mainly at cremation ghats and uninhabited places
 shav sadhana ek vishesh kriya he jiske dwaara swayan ke astitv ke vibhinn charnon kii pratikatmak rup main anubhav kiya jaataa he
 According to the Aghor belief, the word Aghor is basically made up of two words 'A' and 'ghor' which means one who is not stoic which means easy and simple
 prayek maanav janmajaat rup se aghor arthath sahaj hota he
 As the child grows up, he learns to differentiate and later inside him evils and evils and he is no longer in his original nature ie Aghor
 aghor sadhana ke dwaara punah apane sahaj or mul rup main aa sakate hai or is mul rup kaa gyaan hone par hi moksh kii prapti sambhav he
 The practitioners of the Aghor sect wear a garland of male mundans for visualization and also use male mundas as characters
 chita ke bhasma kaa sharir par lepan or chitaagni par bhojan pakaana ityadi saamaanya kaary hai
 There is no difference of location in Aghor sight i
e
 palace or crematorium are the same
 varanasi yaa kaashi ko bharat ke sabase pramukh aghor sthaan ke taur par maanate hai
 Due to Lord Shiva's own city, various Aghor seekers have also done penance here
 yahaan baba kinaram kaa sthal ek mahatvapurn tirth bhi he
 Apart from Kashi, the Girnar mountain of Junagadh in Gujarat is also an important place
 junagarh ko avadhoot bhagwaan dattatreya ke tapasya sthal ke rup main jaanate hai
 The seekers of the Aghor sect are also known for devouring the flesh of the deceased
 mritak kaa maance jahaan ek ore saamaanya janata main asprishy hota he vahiin ise aghor ek prakritik padaarth ke rup main dekhte hai or ise udrastha kar ek prakritik chakra ko santulit karne kaa kaary karte hai

 The architecture of India is a mixture of traditional and external influences
 bhartiya vaastu kii visheshta yahan kii deevaaron ke utkrisht or prachur alankaran main he
 The scheme of frescoes and sculptures, which in addition to ornamentation, expresses a serious sense of its subject, sometimes completely envelops the building from the outside
 inamen vaastu kaa jivan se sambandh kya, vastav main aadhyatmik jivan hi ankit he
 The gods and goddesses across the country, engraved in their supernatural acts engraved in the novel elevation, and the age-old mythological gems, symbolize the sculpture, opening a book of highly interesting stories and delightful paintings in front of the audience
 'vaastu' shabd kii vyutpatti sanskrit ke 'vas' dhaatu se hui he jiskaa arth 'basna' hota he
 Since a building is required to settle, 'vastu' means 'building to live'
 'vas' dhaatu se hi vaas, awaas, nivas, basati, basti aadi shabd bane hai
 Two-three thousand years BC The discovery of the developed Indus Valley Civilization has brought to light a surprising fact that the oldest art of India was as aesthetic as any other civilization
 jab aajkal kii koi bhi sabhyataa jaagran kii angadaai bhi na le pai thi tab bharat kii yah kala itani viksit thi
 The town planning knowledge of the makers of these settlements was so mature, the materials used by them were of such excellent quality and the composition was so strong that the beginning of that civilization is bound to be considered long ago, about four five thousand years, BC
 
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaayiyon se praapt avshesh tatkaaleen bhautik samruddhi ke suchak hai or unamem kisi mandir, devalayas aadi ke abhaav se yah anumaan hota he ki vahaan dharmik vichaaron kaa kuch vishesh sthaan na tha, athwa yadi tha to vah niraakaar shakti main aasthaa ke rup main hi tha
 Nevertheless, such a grotesque start to the history of end-to-end enriched Indian life with remarkable brilliance and excellent architectural expectation as well as more exploration, linking its link with the Aryan civilization, which is considered more ancient
 Can be found simit aavashyaktaaon main vishwaas rakhanevaale, apane krushikarm or ashramajivan se santusht arya praaia: gramvasi the or shaayad isiilie, apane paripakv vichaaron ke anuroop hi, samasamyik sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke vilaasi bhautik jivan kii chakachaundh se aprabhavit rahe
 In any case, the later Indian architecture seems to have originated from their temporary residences
 iskaa aadhaar dharti main or vikaas vrikshon main hua, jaisaa vaidic vaanmay main mahaavan, torana, gopur aadi ke ullekhon se vidit hota he
 So, if any memorial work of that temporary creation is not seen today, then no wonder
 dhire-dhire nagaron kii bhi rachana hui or sthaayee nivas bhi bane
 Rajagriha, the capital of Magadha in Bihar was probably at the pinnacle of advancement in the 8th century BCE

 There were towns at all four ends of the roads

 The arched outcrops, pillars decorated with pillars, pillars, jungles and catacombs from place to place give a sense of the sentimentality of the Buddhist holy cities
 rajya kaa aashray paakar anek stupon, chaityon, biharon, stambhon, toranon or gufaamandiron main vaastukala kaa charam vikaas hua
 Excellent examples of erstwhile architecture are found on stone and brick as well as wood, about which Sir John Marshall wrote in the "archaeological Survey of India, 1912-13" that "he demonstrates the unique subtlety and perfection of the immediate works
" Let's make it happen
 unke karigar aaj bhi yadi sansar main aa sakate, to apni kala ke kshetra main kuch vishesh seekhney yogya shaayad na pate"

 The artifacts from the fourth century AD are unique in terms of art
 dakshin bharat main guntupalle or shankaran pahari main shailakrutt vaastu ke darshan hote hai
 Sanchi, Nalanda and Sarnath have relatively later artefacts
 paanchavin shatee se eent kaa prayog hone laga
 From the same time Brahmin influence also appeared
 tatkaaleen brahman mandiron main bhitagaanv, budhramu, sirpur or kharod, tathaa ter ke mandiron kii shrunkhlaa ullekhneey he
 The temple of Bhittagaon, perhaps the oldest, stands on a high platform of 36 feet square, 70 feet high like a bastion
 budhramu kaa mandir bhi aisa hi he
 Like other Hindu temples, they do not have pavilions etc
, only the sanctum sanctorum
 bheetar deevaaren yadhyapi saadi hai, tathaapi unamem patte, kingriyaan, dilhe, aale aadi, rachana kii kuch vishistataaen imaaraton kii pracheenta kii drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 The proportion of its various parts is beautiful and the architectural effect is skillful
 aalon main bauddhachaityon kii daaton kaa prabhaav avashya padaa dikhaai padataa he
 Their styles have also been imitated in temples built centuries later
 hindu vaastukaushal kaa vistaar mehalon, samaadhiyon, durgon, baavadiyon or ghaaton main bhi hua, kintu desh bhar main bikhare mandiron main yah vishesh mukhar hua he
 In the Gupta period, there was stability in the form of temple art
 7veen shatee ke ant main shikhar mahatvapurn or anivaary ang samajha jane laga
 The Aryan style towards the north and the Dravidian style towards the south are clearly visible in the temple architecture
 gwalior ke "taili kaa mandir" or bhubaneshwar ke "batal deval mandir" uttari style kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai or somangalam, manimangalam aadi ke chol mandir dakshini style kaa
 But these styles are not bounded by any geographical boundary
 chalukyon kii rajdhani pattadakal ke das mandiron main se chaar uttari style ke or chah dakshini style ke hai
 In the 10th - 11th century Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas all dynasties nourished the southern style
 donon hi shaileyon par buddha vaastu kaa prabhaav he, visheshkar shikharon main
 There are many legends behind the Maya and mystery of historical buildings of India
 madhya bharat ke kuch sarvshereshth mandir ek kaalpanik rajkumaar janakacharya dwaara banaae kahe jate hai, jise brahmahatya ke praayshchitt swaroop bees varsh is kaam main lagane pade the
 According to another legend, these extraordinary buildings were not built by the Pandavas in a single night
 uttari gujarat kaa vishaal mandir gujarat-naresh siddhraj dwaara or khandesh ke mandir gavaali rajvansh dwaara nirmit kah jate hai
 Many temples in the south are said to be made up of the religious fervor of King Ramachandra's minister Hemadapant and the style of some of the temples of the 13th century is known as Hemadpanti
 ise agyaat nirmaataaon kii shaleenta kahen, yaa aitihaasik tamisr, kintu isamen sandeh nahin ki mandirwastu, jise anuthe udhaaharan bhubaneshwar ke lingraj, mukteshwar, brahmeshwar, rameshwar, parameshwar, uttareshwar, ishwareshwar, bharteshwar, lakshmaneshwar aadi mandir, konark kaa suryamandir, mamallipuram ke saptarath, kanchivram kaa kailashnath mandir, shri nivasanalur kaa korangnath mandir, trichanapalli kaa jambukeshwar mandir, darasuram kaa airavateshwar mandir, thanjore ke subrahmanyam evam brihadeshwar mandir, vijaynagar kaa vitthalaswami mandir, tiruvallur evam madura ke vishaal mandir, traavncor kaa shachindram mandir, rameshwar ke vishaal mandir velur kaa channakeshav mandir, somnathpur kaa keshav mandir, puri kaa jagannatha mandir, khajuraho kii adinath, vishwanath, parswanath or kandariyaa mahadev mandir, kiraadu ke shiv mandir, abu ke tejpal tathaa vimal mandir, gvalier kaa sasbahu mandir evam udayeshwar mandir sejakapur kaa navalkha mandir, pattan kaa somnath mandir, modhera kaa surya mandir, anbarnath kaa mahadev mandir, jogda kaa maanakeshwar mandir, mathura vrundavan kaa govinddev mandir, shatrunjay pahari ke jain mandir, ranpur kaa adinath mandir aadi aadi desh bhar main bikhare pade hai, jo bhavyata, vishalata, utkrushtataa or sarthakta sabhi drushtiyon se anupam he
 These tableau of Buddhist, Jain Vastu, Hindu Vastu, and Dravidian Vastu evolving together in the country are proof of the traditional religious tolerance of the vast India
 vaastukala par musalamaanon ke akraman kaa jitna prabhaav bharat main padaa utana anyatra kahin nahin, kyonki jis sabhyataa se muslim sabhyataa kii takkar hui, kisi se uskaa itnaa virodh nahin tha jitna bhartiya sabhyataa se
 Compared to the prestigious Indian social and religious trends, Muslim civilization was completely new, its fundamental principles were also different
 donon kaa sangharsh yatharthwaad kaa adarshavaad se, vaastaviktaa kaa swapndarshita se or vyakt kaa avyakt se sangharsh tha, jiskaa pramaan masjid or mandir ke bhed main spasht he
 The mosques are open, their center is in the direction of distant Mecca; While the temple is a house of mystery, the center of which is the middle devasthan or sanctum sanctorum surrounded by many walls and corridors
 majisd kii deevaaren praaia: saadi yaa pavitra aayaton se utkeern hoti hai, unamem maanav akritiyon kaa chithran nishiddh hota he; jabaki mandiron kii deevaaron main murtikla or maanavkruti chithran ucchtam shikhar par pahunchaa, par likhaai kaa naam na tha
 This depiction of the simple colors of the stones brought alive to the temples; Whereas the walls were articulated in the mosques by colorful stones, marble and painting plastered plaster
 gurutvkarshan ke siddhant par ek hi prakaar kii baari bharkam sanrachanaayen khadi karne main siddhhast, bhartiya kaarigaron kii yugon yugon se ek hi li par padi, nishpravaah pratibha, vijetaon dwaara anya deshon se laae hue nae siddhant, nai paddatiyaan or nai disha paakar sfoort ho uthi
 Consequently, apart from religious buildings, such as mosques, tombs, rajas and dargahs, a variety of secular buildings, such as palaces, pavilions, nagarwadars, wells, gardens and large forts, were built up to the enclaves encircling the entire city
 desh main uttar se dakshin tak jaise jaise muslim prabhtv badhata ga, vaastukala kaa yug bhi badalata gaya
 Three successive stages of Muslim Vastu are evident
 pehla charan, jo bahut thode samay rahaa, vijaydarp or dharmandhta se prerit "nirmulan" kaa tha, jiske bare main hasan nizami likhata he ki prayek kila jeetne ke baad uske stambh or neenv tak mahakay haathiyon ke pairon tale rondwakar dhul main mila dene kaa rivaaj tha
 Many forts, cities and temples were made non-existent in this way
 tadnantar doosraa charan soddeshy or aanshik vidhwans kaa aayaa, jisamen imaaraten isliye todi gayi ki vijetaon kii masjidon or makbaron ke liye taiyaar maal uplabdh ho sake
 Elephants were also used to carry out big dharnas and pillars from their place to take them to a new place
 pray: isi kaal main mandiron ko vishesh kshati pahaunchi, jo vijit praanton kii nai nai rajdhaniyon ke nirmaan ke liye taiyaar maal kii khan ban gaye or uttar bharat se hindu vaastu kii praaia: safaai hi ho gai
 The final phase began when Akranta was thoroughly awakened in many parts and he created well-crafted and exquisite architecture through planned construction rather than replacement
 shaileyon kii drushti se bhi muslim vaastu ke teen varg ho sakate hai
 The first is the Delhi style, or Shahanshahi style, often called "pathan Vastu"
