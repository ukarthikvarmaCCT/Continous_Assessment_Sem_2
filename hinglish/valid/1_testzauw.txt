 Vishnu has been recognized as the supreme power and control of the entire world since Vedic times
 hindu dharm ke aadharbhoot granthon main bahumanya purananusaar vishnu parameshwar ke teen mukhya roopon main se ek rup hai
 In the Puranas, Trimurti Vishnu has been called the follower of the world
 trimurti ke anya do rup brahma or shiv ko mana jaataa he
 While Brahma is considered the creator of the world, Shiva is considered the destroyer
 multah vishnu or shiv tathaa brahma bhi ek hi hai yah manyata bhi bahushah sweekrut rahi he
 Vishnu has been recognized as one who incarnates in various forms to guide justice, destruction of injustice, and guide the organism to follow the path appropriately
 purananusaar vishnu kii patni lakshmi hai
 Kamdev was the son of Vishnu
 vishnu kaa nivas ksheer sagar he
 His sleeping is over Sheshnag
 unki naabhi se camel utpann hota he jisamen brahma ji sthit hai
 He holds the Padma in his lower left hand, the mace in his lower right hand, the conch in the upper left hand and the chakra in his upper right hand
 'vishnu' shabd kii vyutpatti mukhyatah 'vish' dhaatu se hi maani gayi he
 In Nirukta, Yasakacharya has taken the word 'vishnu' in the sense of 'vyapati' and termed it as 'vishnu'
 vaikalpik rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko bhi 'pravesh' ke arth main liya gaya he, 'kyonki vah vibhu hone se sarvatra pravesh kiya hua hota he
 Adi Shankaracharya has also considered the meaning of the word 'vishnu' broadly in his Vishnusahsrnama-bhasya, and has clearly written as its etymology that "vishu, the epithet of vyasth meaning, becomes 'vishnu' in the form of metal" Vishnu " 
 'vish' dhaatu ko unhone bhi vikalp se hi liya he or likhaa he ki "athwa nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup vishnu he; jaisaa ki vishnupurana main kaha he-- 'us mahatma kii shakti is sampoorn vishwa main pravesh kiye hue hai; isliye vah vishnu kehalaata he, kyonki 'vish' dhaatu kaa arth pravesh karnaa he"
 Major commentators of the Rigveda have also broadened the meaning of the word 'vishnu' with one voice
 vishnusukt kii vyakhya main acharya sayan 'vishnu' kaa arth vyapnsheel tathaa sarvavyaapak karte hai; to shripad damodar satavlekar bhi iskaa arth vyapaktaa se sambaddh hi lete hai
 Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati has also taken the meaning of 'vishnu' omnipresent universally and has also taken the meaning of supreme scholar in many places
 is prakaar suspasht parilakshith hota he ki 'vishnu' shabd 'vish' dhaatu se nishpann he or uskaa arth vyapanyukt he
 In the Vedic Dev-tradition, Vishnu's place is secondary to the numerical point of view of the Suktas because his eulogy is performed in only 5 Suktas; But if they are not looked at from a numerical point of view and consider them from other aspects, then their importance comes out very high
 rugveda main unhen 'brihachharir', yuvakumar aadi visheshnon se khyapit kiya gaya he
 The nature and characteristics of Vishnu mentioned in the Rigveda can be observed in the following points: - vishnu kii anupam visheshta unke teen paad-prakshep hai, jinka rugveda main baarah baar ullekh miltaa he
 Probably this is his biggest feature
 unke teen pad-kram madhu se paripurna kahe gayi hai, jo kabhi bhi ksheen nahin hote
 His three rankings are so elaborate that entire folk exist in them
 ‘tredha vichkramanh’ bhi prakaaraantar se unke teen paad-prakshepon ko dhvanit karata he
 The terms 'uruguay' and 'urukram' are also reflective of the said fact
 madhu se aapurit unke teen pad-kram main se do drushtigochar hai, teesraa sarvatha agochar
 This third highest position has been called the flight of birds and beyond the mortal eye
 yask ke purvavarti shakpuni in teen paad-prakshepon ko brahmand ke teen bhaagon-- prithvi, antariksh or dhuloak main surya kii sanchaar gati ke pratik maanate hai
 Yasak's predecessor Aurnavabha considers him to be the covenant of the rising of the sun, the position in the mid-day and the setting
 tilak mahoday inase varsh ke tridhavibhaajan kaa sanket maanate hai
 If seen, most scholars consider Vishnu to be a sun-vachhi, one of his footprints from midday till midday, second footfall from midnight to midnight and third footfall from postwar to posthumous rise
 inhen purvokt do paad-prakshepon ko drushtigochar or tisare ko agochar kaha gaya he
 But many scholars including mcdanal also say that in this sense how can the third stage be considered as 'supreme'? Therefore, they, like the aforesaid Shakpuni, consider the three steps to be the path through the three worlds of the solar deity
 surya kii kalpana kaa hi samarthan karte hue mcdanal ne vishnu dwaara apane 90 ashwon ke sanchalit kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya he, jinamein se pratye ke chaar-chaar naam hai
 Thus 90 multiplied by 4 numbers means 360 horse, which they consider to be integral since the days of a solar year
 vastutah vishnu ke do padon se sampoorn vishwa kii niyantranaatmakataa tathaa tisare pad se unka param dham arthath unki prapti sanketit he
 In the Rigveda itself, these three verses have been given a mysterious explanation
 isliye is pad ko gyanatmak maanakar rugveda main hi spasht kaha gaya he ki vishnu kaa param pad gyaniyon dwaara hi gyatavya he
 Although Vishnu is also considered to be a resident of Vani, but his most beloved abode, 'path:' is well-known in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan ne ‘giri’ pad ko shlisht maanakar uskaa arth 'vaani' ke saath-saath lakshanik rup main ‘parvat ke samaan unnat lok’ bhi kiya he
 If 'giri' is accepted in both these ways, then the problem is solved
 vishnu kaa teesraa pad jahaan pahunchataa he vahi unka awaas sthaan he
 The world of Vishnu is the 'ultimate post', that is, it is the best form of destination
 us ‘param pad’ kii visheshta yah he ki vah atyadhik prakaash se yukt he
 There cows with many horns transmit there
 ‘gaavah’ yahan shlisht pad kii tarah he
 The meaning of the physical confirmation of milk, etc
, when there is 'cow' meaning from the pun and 'rays', there is a lot of light that is easily permissible for light, that is, spiritual progress
 vishnu ke ‘param pad’ main madhu kaa sthaayee utsa he
 This 'madhu' is also rejoicing to the gods
 is shlisht pad kaa jo bhi arth kiya jaay par vah har sthiti main parmanand kaa vaachak he, jiske liye devtaa sahit samast praani abhilaashi bhi rahete hai or prayatnsheel bhi
 Therefore, everyone wishes for the attainment of the said world
 usee mantra main vahaan punyashalee logon kaa, tripti kaa anubhav karte hue ullekh bhi hua he
 a prominent feature of Vishnu is his friendship with Indra
 indra ke saahchary main hi unke teen paad-prakshepon kaa pravartan hota he
 Together with Indra, he destroys the 99 forts of the Shambar monster
 isi prakaar vah vrutra ke saath sangram main bhi indra kii sahaayta karte hai
 Both have also been described with some other powers
 is prakaar vishnu dwaara sompaan kiya janaa or indra dwaara teen paad-prakshep kiya janaa bhi varnit he
 In the Rigveda, Mandal 6, Sukta 69, there is a homage to the two deities
 isi prakaar rugveda ke mandal 5, sookt 87 main indra ke sahchar marudganon ke saath unki sahastuti praapt hoti he
 The word Vishnu derived from Vishnu Dhatu literally means 'broad, dynamic, functional or enterprising'
 apane bal-vikram ke hi kaaran ve logon dwaara stut hote hai
 They are eternal semen
 is gun ke kaaran hi unhen pratik rup se ‘vrishna’ bhi mana gaya he
 They are the cause of fear of enemies due to their semen or heroic deeds
 unase log usee prakaar bhaybheet rahete hai, jis prakaar kisi parvatachaari singh se
 With the utterances of 'parameshvaradbhiti', etc
, it is proved to fear the common people
 unase bhaybheet hona akaaran nahin he
 They are about to commit acts of violence etc
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki ve kutsit hinsadikarta kaa hi vadh karte he
 Therefore it has been said for them that they are not murderers
 vishnu visteern, vyapak or apratihat gati vaale hai
 The terms 'urugay' and 'urukram' are a source of this fact
 ‘urugay’ kaa arth acharya sayan dwaara ‘mahjjanon dwaara stuyaman’ athwa ‘prabhutatya stuyaman’ karne se bhi vishnu kii mahima vikhandit nahin hoti
 Dr
 Yadunandan Mishra says that we are urged to make the meaning of this term 'with a wide speed', because it has been said to be a 'transmitter in all worlds'
 unke pad-kram itane sudeergh hote hai ki ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 If the creation of Vishnu's three stanzas, establish and hold them, then they also nurture dependent people there
 logon ko apana bhogy annadi unheen teen pad-kramon ke prasadswarup praapt hota he, jisase ki ve param tripti kaa anubhav kiya karte hai
 Those who praise Vishnu, they always do well, because their eulogy gives them the utmost energy
 is prakaar sphurti-pradaayini stuti vishnu tak pahunchaa paane ke liye sabhi lalayit rahete hai
 They are senior donors
 vishnu ke gunon main bhi trayaatmakataa parilakshith hoti he
 He is of three rank-order, three types of speed, measuring the three worlds and holding the Loktraya
 isi prakaar vah ‘tridhaatu’ arthath sat, raj or tam kaa samikrut rup athwa prithvi, jal or tej se yukt bhi hai
 Vishnu is the creator of earthly regions and the establishment of the most elaborate space etc
 ve swanirmit lokon main teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale hai
 These three movements symbolize their origin, status and merger
 is prakaar jad-jangam sabhi ke ve nirmaataa bhi hai, paalak bhi or vinaashak bhi
 He is the 'sole holder of Loktray'
 ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se akele hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 By measuring Loktraya, it also results that Loktraya means that the entire living beings are under his complete control
 vishnu bhrun-rakshak bhi hai
 Vishnu is prayed to protect the womb seed and the birth of a beautiful child
 unke paalak swaroop par spasht bal dene ke kaaran rugveda main ahoratr agnirup main bhi unhen 'vishnurgopa paraman paati

' arthath sabake rakshak-paalak kaha gaya he
 Acharya Saiyan also clearly considers Vishnu to be 'observant' in the interpretation of the twelfth mantra of the twenty-fifth Sukta of the Eighteenth Circle of the Rigveda
 xxrep 4 
 Therefore, in the overall perspective, Vishnu has been called the supreme benefactor in the Rigveda
 sarvaadhik mantron main varnit hone ke baavjood indra ko 'sukrit' or vishnu ko 'sukruttarah' kaha gaya he
 'sukritarah' has been interpreted by Acharya Sayan as 'the best of those who give good fruit'; Shripad Satavalekar ji has given the meaning 'best among those who do good deeds' and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati ji has also given the meaning 'ative best deeds
' indra 'sukrit' he to vishnu 'sukruttarah' hai
 The meaning is clear that it is assumed in the Rigveda that Vishnu is supreme
 isi prakaar indra ke raja hone ke baavjood vishnu kii sarvocchata rugveda main hi is baat se bhi spasht ho jaati he ki usamen vishnu ke liye kaha gaya he ki "ve sampoorn vishwa ko akele dhaaran karte hai" tathaa indra ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve rajya karte hai
 The meaning is clear that Vishnu, the creator and foster of the universe, has made Indra the king for operation
 is susandarbhit pariprekshya main vishnu kii sarvocchata se sambaddh brahman granthon evam baad kii puranic manyataayen bhi swatah udbhasith ho uthati hai
 In the Brahmin era, there was a lot of development of yajna-sanstha and with this, the importance of Vishnu in Deomandali became more than before
 aitarey brahman ke armbh main hi yajna main sthaan dene ke kram main agni se armbh kar vishnu ke sthaan ko 'param' kaha gaya he
 Among them is the place of other gods
 is tarah spasht rup se vaidic samhita granthon main sarvapramukh sthaan praapt agni kii apeksha vishnu ko atyucch sthaan diya gaya he
 In fact, Vishnu has been considered great in the Rigveda, but due to the lack of description, his place there is secondary
 brahman granthon main spasht kathan ke dwaara unhen sarvocch pad diya gaya he
 This superiority is also evident from the legend that Vishnu snatched the earth, Veda and Vani from the demons by his three steps and gave it to Indra
 vaidic vishnu ke teen pagon kaa yah brahmanon main kathatmak roopaantaran he; or isi ke saath vishnu kii sarvshereshthata bhi brahman yug main hi spasht ho gayi
 Aitareya Brahmin clearly considers Vishnu as the gatekeeper, the absolute protector of the gods
 rugveda tathaa brahmanon main uplabdh sanketon kaa puraanon main paryaapt parivardhan hua-- kathatmak bhi, vivarnaatmak bhi or vyaakhyaatmak bhi
 The Puranas have referred to Nirmal Parbrahma as Vishnu due to the absence of present, continual, unborn, Akshay, Avayya, Ekras and Hay at the core of this world
 ve 'paraanaa parah', intaraatma main avasthit paramatma, param shreshth tathaa rup, varna aadi nirdeshon tathaa visheshan se rahit hai
 They are devoid of these six vices - birth, growth, result, decay and destruction
 ve sarvatra vyaapt hai or samast vishwa kaa unheen main vaas he; isiilie vidvan unhen 'vasudev' kehete hai
 At a time when there was no day, night, sky, earth, darkness, light and nothing but these, at that time the only head man was Param Brahm, who is not the subject of senses and intellect
 sristi ke armbh main brahma ji ko vishnu ji ne jo mul gyanaswaroop chatupashloki bhagwat sunaaya tha, usamen bhi yahi bhav vyakt hua he -- sristi ke purv keval main hi main tha
 Apart from me, neither was gross nor subtle and neither was the cause of ignorance
 jahaan yah sristi nahin he, vahaan main hi main hoon or is sristi ke rup main jo prathit ho rahaa he, vah bhi main hi hoon or jo kuch batch rahegaa, vah bhi main hi hoon
 In these contexts, the supremacy of Vishnu and the feeling of being a Sarvnarshi is clearly reflected
 mana gaya he ki vishnu ke do rup hue
 The first form is the head man and the second form is 'kaal'
 ye hi donon sristi or pralay ko athwa prakruti or purush ko sanyukt or viyukt karte hai
 This time form God is eternal and eternal; Therefore, the origin, position and catastrophe of the world also never stop
 vaishnavon ke sirmaur tathaa 'puraanon kaa tilak' ke rup main maanya bhagwat mahapurana main sristi kii utpatti ke prasang main kaha gaya he ki sristi karne kii ichha hone par ekarnav main soye vishnu kii naabhi se camel kaa pradurbhaav hua or usamen samast gunon ko abhasith karne vaale swayan vishnu ke hi antaryami rup se pravisht hone se swatah vedamay brahma kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Similarly, in most Puranas, Vishnu has been accepted as the ultimate brahma
 unase sambaddh kathaon se puraana bhare pade hai
 Being a follower, they sometimes have to resort to various traps from the world view
 asuron ke dwaara rajya chin lene par punah swargadhipaty-prapti hetu devataaon ko samudr-manthan kaa paraamarsh dete hue asuron se chal karne kaa suzav dena; tathaa kamoddeepak mohini rup dharankar asuron ko mohit karke devataaon ko amrit pilaanaa; shankhachud ke vadh hetu tulsi kaa satitv bhang karne sambandhi devibhagwat tathaa shivpurana jaise uppuraanon main varnit kathaon main vishnu kaa chal-prapanch drashtavy he
 In this regard, it is important to note that being a follower, they see results
 kinhin varadaanon se asuron / anyaayiyon ke bal-vishisht ho jane ke kaaran yadi chal karke bhi anyaayi kaa ant tathaa anyaay kaa parimarjan hota he to ve chal karne se bhi nahin hichakate
 Killing Bali by hiding in Ramavatar and becoming the MLA of many tricks in the Mahabharata war in Krishnavatar is a reflection of his attitude
 chhidranveshi log inhen kathaon kaa upyog manamaani vyakhya karke ishwar-virodh ke rup main karte hai
 But it is necessary to look at them from the point of view of contextual knowledge, because in the Puranas or related texts, these passages are presented in the opposite situations only for the knowledge of specific duties beyond the ordinary
 dhyatavya he ki puraanon main tathvik gyaan ko hi brahm, paramatma or bhagwaan kaha gaya he
 The entire nature of Vishnu is cognitive
 puraanon main unke dwaara dhaaran kiye jane vaale aabhushanon tathaa ayudhon ko bhi pratikatmak mana gaya he :- In this way, Vishnu carries all the creative ingredients on his body
 vishnu kii akruti se sambandhit stutiparak ek shloke atiprasiddh he :- Shantakaram Bhujagasyanam Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan megh varnan shubhangam

 Charity - whose shape is extremely calm, sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag, with a lotus in the navel, which is also the basis of God and the whole world of the gods, which pervades all the way to the sky, similar to Neelamegh , Extremely beautiful whose whole parts are attained by meditating by yogis, who are masters of entire worlds, who are destroyers of fear of birth and death, such Lakshmipati, a Lnetr God Srivishnu i salute
 vishnu kii sarvshereshthata kaa yah taatpary nahin he ki shiv yaa brahma aadi unase nune hai
 God does not have a high and low sense
 vah to lila main sristi-sanchaalan hetu sagun hone kii praathamikta maatr he
 Therefore, be it Vaishnava or Shaiva - all the best texts like Purana and Mahabharata declare with one voice that God is one
 kaha gaya he ki ek hi bhagavan janardan jagat kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke liye 'brahma', 'vishnu' or 'shiv' -- in teen sangyaaon ko dhaaran karte hai
 There are many clear statements of Vishnu and Shiva being the same
 'avatar' kaa shabdic arth he bhagavan kaa apni swatantry-shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main moort rup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The accomplishment of an avatar is considered in two conditions - one abandons one's form and eclipses the new form by action; And the second coming in a related form after taking a new birth, in which the condition of a situation in the womb of the mother is also included
 isamen atyalp samay ke liye rup badalakar yaa kisi duusare kaa rup dharankar punah apane rup main aa janaa shaamil nahin hota
 In the well-known seventh and eighth verses of the fourth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita, God himself stated that the purpose of incarnation is that - whenever the loss of religion and the iniquity are uplifted, then for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 i originate in different eras
 iske atirikt bhagwat mahapurana main ek vishisht or adhik udaatt prayojan kii baat kahi gayi he ki bhagavan to prakruti sambandhi vruddhi-vinaash aadi se pare achintya, anant, nirgun hai
 So if they do not reveal their lila in the form of avatar, then how would the creatures understand their non-living qualities? Therefore, for the inspiring welfare of the creatures, he revealed himself and his leela
 isliye vibhinn avatar-kathaon main kai visham sthitiyaan hai jisase jeev yah samaj sake ki paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg kaisaa hota he! The first systematic list of incarnations of Vishnu is available in the Mahabharata

 It has further been said that they are all past and future incarnations
 mulpath main varnan chah avtaron kaa he :-1

krishna Since the Mahabharata is a work made before the birth of Buddha or before the imagery of Buddha being incarnate; So, naturally there is no sign of Buddha anywhere in it
 uske badale hans ko avatar rup main ginaney se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 The description of the avatar in the Dakshinatya text of Mahabharata is as follows: - matsay: kurmo varahashch narsinghsch vaaman:
 Ramo Ramscha Ramsha Krishna: Kalki Cha Te Dash
 yahan purvokt avtaron main se hans ko chhodkar tisare ram arthath balram ko jod dene se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 One thing can be proved from this account that till the time of Mahabharata, no more than ten avatars were imagined; Otherwise those Das avatars would not have been called 'all incarnations of the past and the future'
 baad main anya avtaron kii bhi kalpana prachlit hui or kul avtaron kii gananaa choubees tak pahunch gayin
 Despite counting 22 and 24 avatars in the Bhagavata Mahapuran, the majority of avatars have been the Mahabharata Das
 padmapurana, lingapurana, varahapurana, matsaypurana aadi anek puraanon main samaan rup se dash avtaron kii baat hi bataayi gayi he
 The description of Agnipuran is also exactly the same sequence
 is sandarbh kaa nimnaankit shloke praayah sarvanishtha he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varaashta Narasimhoth Vamana
 raamo ramashch krishnashch buddhah kalkishch te dash
 Thus, only the avatar of Vishnu is recognized

 isaki sthapana france-prasha yuddh ke samay dwitiya francisi samrajya ke samaapt hone par hui tathaa 1940 main naaji germany dwaara france ko parajeet karne ke saath iskaa ant hua
 France suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Prasha in the Battle of Sidan in 1870, as a result of which France had to give her two valuable territories to Alsace and Lauren Prasha

 After this defeat, Napoleon III was forced to surrender
 vah bandi bana liya gaya
 When the news reached Paris, the capital of France, the next day, ie on 3 September, there was a question on the face of all the people of Paris, what would happen now, because the royalty they had established 20 years ago was suddenly destroyed
 janata ab is nirnay par pahunchi ki france main ganatantr shashan kii sthapana kii jaani chaiye
 At that time the session of the administrative assembly was taking place
 janata ne sabha se us samay yah prastaav sheeghra hi paas karvaa liya ki napolian tritiy ko france ke samraat ke pad se pruthak kar diya jaye
 Thus the fall of Napoleon III and the establishment of a republican government for the third time in France

 But this was not the time to spend in mutual debate and fighting, as the German army was moving rapidly towards France

 The dispute became so intense that to decide it, a nation House of Representatives had to be organized, which incidentally had a large number of royalists, which shows that the French people wanted peace rather than war at this time

 ko france or germany main sandhi ho gai jiske anusaar france ko apane do samridhishalee praanton-alses or lauren se haath dhonaa padaa
 Their area was ten thousand square miles and its population was 1
6 million
 usko yuddh-kshatipurti ke rup main bahut adhik dhan germany ko dena padaa
 France had to accept Germany's authority over the famous fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg
 germany se sandhi hone ke uparaant vividh dalon main jhagade hone armbh huye
 The people of Paris revolted against Thiers and the House of Representatives, which led to the following: paris ke vidroh kaa kathorta se daman karne ke uparant thiurs ke saamne badi vikat paristhiti utpann hui
 Due to this rebellion, the condition of France became very disconcerting and till now there was an army present in France which was stationed on the part of Germany to obtain war supplies
 us sena ko teen arab rupaya dekar france se nikaala ja saktaa tha
 In such a situation it was not an easy task to get such a huge amount
 thiurs is bheeshan paristhiti se nahin ghabaraaya
 He started receiving money with great enthusiasm and courage
 do varsh ke andar german sena ko samast rupaya dekar usne unase france khaali karaayaa
 This act increased the trust of the people of France and she was determined to help him in every way possible
 iske pashchaat thiurs kaa dhyaan is ore aakarshith hua ki france main ab kis prakaar kii sarkaar tathaa shashan kii sthapana kii jaye
 The current government that was formed under Thiers's leadership was on the basis of republic, he was its president
 kintu raashtra pratinidhi sabha main rajasattavadiyon kaa bahumat tha
 On the establishment of peace and order in the country, the imperialists wanted to try to establish the state
 thiurs prarambh main rajasattavadi tha, kintu rajasattavadiyon main itnaa adhik matbhed tha ki thiurs ko baadhya hokar apane vichaaron main parivartan karnaa padaa
 Now he became a supporter of the republic, due to which the royalists turned against him and he started an open movement to establish the state
 thiurs unke is kaary ko sahan nahin kar sakaa
 Therefore, he announced in December 1872 that if there was an attempt to establish a state power in France, there would be a re-revolution in France
 is ghoshnaa kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rajasattavadi uske viruddh ho gayi
 He could not get the support of the republicans either, because they considered him a person of very soft views
 may 1873 i
 uske viruddh rajtantravaadiyon ne ek prastaav paas kiya, jisase spasht ho gaya ki raashtra pratinidhi sabha kaa us par vishwaas nahin he or is paristhiti se baadhya hokar usko apane pad se tyaag-patr dena padaa
 Now the monarchists placed Marshal mcmahome on the post of president
 vah rajasatta kaa pakshpaati tha or usne ghoshnaa kii ki vah usee samay raashtrapati ke pad ko tyaag degaa jis samay kisi vyakti ko raja niyat kar diya jaayegaa
 There was a lot of disharmony and differences among the royalists on the question of who should be made the king and they could not reach any definite result
 ab tritiy ganatantr ke samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya janaa aarambh hua
 On 29 May 1875, it was decided by a resolution that now the Republic would be established instead of the establishment of a monarchy in France
 yah prastaav keval ek vot ke bahumat se paas hua
 After this a new constitution was made for France according to which ganatantr sarkaar ne apni sthiti ko sudrudh karne ke uparant desh kii unnati kii ore vishesh dhyaan diya or usne nimnlikhit sudhaar kiye- The question of the Church was very important before the republican government of France
 prashn yah tha ki rajya or carch kaa sambandh kis prakaar kaa hona chaiye
 It was not only a religious question but also a political question
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki france kaa padri varg rajtantr kaa samarthak tha or ganatantr kaa virdohi tha
 All the movements that took place in support of the monarchy had a direct or indirect hand of the clergy
 is kaaran ganatantr ke samarthakon ne carch ke adhikaron par akraman karnaa aarambh kar diya
 It was only in 1877 that Gamebette made it clear that 'the clergy is a staunch opponent of the Republic
 ' is samay tak france kii samast shiksha par carch kaa adhikaar tha
 Most of the French people were in favor of freeing their children from this education
 dreyfas cese ke uparaant ganatantravaadiyon ne carch ke adhikaron par akraman karnaa aarambh kiya
 He passed the following laws to reduce his power- nepolian tritiy kii paraajay or phenkafort kii sandhi ke kaaran anterrashtriya jagat main france ke maan or pratishtha ko bada aghat pahunchaa
 At this time, the European political scene was dominated by German Chancellor Bismarck, who followed a policy that France could not have any friends in Europe
 france kii aupniveshik niti ke kaaran uske sambandh great-britain se achche nahin the or bismark ne anya mahatvapurn rajyon ke saath raajnneetik sandhiyaan kar rakhi thim
 By the time Bismarck held the German authority, he was successful in his policy
 parantu baad main yah sthiti nahin rah pai
 The resignation of Bismarck led to the Treaty of France and Russia which became famous in history under the name of 'twilight Treaty'
 is sandhi kaa kaaran yah tha ki donon ko germany kaa bhay tha or ab germany ne balkan prayadweep main austria kaa paksh khule taur par lenaa aarambh kar diya tha
 Accordingly, it was decided that both would help each other at the time of the attack
 iske pashchaat france ne great-britain ke saath mitrataa karne kaa praytn kiya
 England began to be apprehensive of the growing power of Germany and also felt that it was necessary to befriend a European power
 france or england ne apane parsparik jhagadon kaa ant kar aapas main ek sandhi kii jisko anta cordial kehete hai
 Russia also joined it in 1907 AD
 is prakaar europe main trigut maitri kii sthapana hui
 There was a possibility of conflict in various factions of Europe on the question of Morocco, but this question was decided by mutual agreement

 Some integrations are made easier by using them
 pratisthaapan 1
 yadi samakalya main a2 − x2 ho to, Keep and use this universal pratisthaapan 2
 If the integrand contains a2 + x2, let and use the identity 1 + tan 2 ⁡ θ = sec 2 ⁡ θ 
 { \ displaystyle 1+ \ tan ^{2} \ theta = \ sec ^{2} \ theta 
} Substitute 3
 If the integrand contains x2 - a2, let and use the identity In the integral we may use Note that the above step requires that a> 0 and cos> 0; we can choose the a to be the positive square root of a2; and we impose the restriction on θ to be −π / 2 <θ <π / 2 by using the arcsin function
 For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change
 For example, as x goes from 0 to a / 2, then sin goes from 0 to 1 / 2, so θ goes from 0 to π / 6
 Then we have Some care is needed when picking the bounds
 The integration above requires that −π / 2 <θ <π / 2, so θ going from 0 to π / 6 is the only choice
 If we had missed this restriction, we might have picked θ to go from π to 5π / 6, which would give us the negative of the result
 In the integral we may write so that the integral becomes

 Reading yun to hindi main i-mail ke liye aajkal darjanon saadhan uplabdh hai, parantu praaia: un sabamein kuch na kuch khamiyaan hai
 We mainly use two types of tools for e-mail, one is e-mail client and the other web based e-mail service
 For e-mail in Hindi, they can be further divided into two types
 oski font aadhaarit tathaa unicode hindi aadhaarit
 do-ek saal pehle tak oski font aadhaarit sevaayen hi hamaare liye ek maatr vikalp ke rup main mauzood thi, jinamein ham shusha se lekar weboduniya tak ke bhinn bhinn font kaa upyog kar khush ho lete the ki ham hindi main i-mail kar le rahe hai
 But English is mandatory for the headers, subject lines, etc
 of these emails
 yah bhi anivaary hota he ki jisko i-mail preshit kiya ja rahaa he, uske computer main vah font santhaapit ho
 Forgotten sometimes, if you have an opportunity to e-mail or view it in Hindi from another computer or to forward the Hindi e-mail to someone else, then the same font problems arise
 
 iske alaava hindi shabdon ke aadhaar par apane aavashyak i-mail ko dhundne or sahejane main bhi samasyaayen aati hai, chunki vastav main aap angreji ke aksharon ke jariye hindi main kaam kar rahe hote hai
 Problems of this kind are common in both e-mail clients such as Outlook Express and web-based e-mail services such as web-world or Rediff Mail
 is bich bhinn upayoktaaon ke bhinn difolt vinyas ke kaaran yadi bhashaa encoding paribhaasha badal jaati he, to phir likhe gaye paath ko pard paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Popular e-mail services like Yahoo also have this problem
 likhnaa How to write email in Hindi? in samasyaon kaa samaadhaan unicode hindi aadhaarit i-mail ke jariye sambhav he
 But here you have to be two to four with other types of problems
 aapke paas yadi purana oparating system he, to vah unicode ko samarthan nahin karegaa or aap unicode hindi main kaary karne main asamarth honge
 Even if your operating system supports Unicode, then your e-mail client and your browser should also be providing Unicode Hindi support
 kuch halaaton main, jaise ki windos98 main oparating system str par unicode hindi samarthan uplabdh nahin he, parantu is par internet explorer 6 kaa sampurna package santhaapit kar ise unicode hindi ke aanshik upyog laayak banaaya ja saktaa he
 By default, support for Hindi Unicode is available to users at the operating system level in Windows 2000 and later versions and in almost all popular versions of Linux released after 2002
 or inamen i-mail claayent tathaa brouzar bhi shaamil hote hai
 Nowadays some Java based tools have also been released that do not require any kind of Unicode support on your computer to run, but a Java-virtual machine is required to be installed
 computer or hindi wiki par likhane ke upaay kaa vivaran he kadi Experiences of e-mail exchanges in Hindi have found that recently, the web-based Gmail service that provides you with SSL3 secure POP3 and SMTP mail service on your e-mail client is the best
 pramukhat: web aadhaarit jimail outluk express 6 par bhi utani hi aasaani se kaam karata he jitna ki linaks ke ke-mail par
 i-mail client ko ji-mail samarthit banane ke liye bas aapako i-mail claayent ke pop / esaimatipi sarwar ko kramash: pop
gmail
com tathaa smtp
gmail
com par set karnaa hoga or esasail suraksha sahit port kramash: 465 tathaa 995 paribhaashit karnaa hoga
 If you find these settings difficult, then there are detailed guidelines for this, there is also an installable file which you can set these configurations automatically by running
 ji-mail kii anya suvidhaayen ye hai jo ise kisi bhi anya i-mail seva se behatar banaate hai: 1
 This web based email service mainly provides you with Pop3 and SMTP facility
 yani aap kisi brouzar se bhi i-mail kar sakate hai tathaa i-mail claayent jaise ki outluk express yaa ke-mail se bhi
 jimail aam upyog ke liye muft he
 However, it has only been released for a limited number of users
 2
 isamen aapako 2 jibi bhandaaran suvidha milti he, saath hi 10 embi fil atechament kii suvidha bhi
 3
 Subject fields of Unicode Hindi e-mail can also be given in Hindi and language encoding like Yahoo is not fragmented in the exchange of e-mail and the e-mail remains intact
 4
 isamen oski aadhaarit hindi jaise ki shusha yaa web-duniya font main bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 5
 G-mail uses SSL for security which you can extend further via GPG
 isamen antarnirmit spom filter bhi he jo aapako avaanchit mail se dur rakhata he
 6
 Google search is available within email, which is obviously quick and appropriate like Google search
 7
 isamen ek bilkul nai vichaardhaara yukt i-mail ko flag karne kii suvidha di gai he jisase i-mail ko mitaayaa na jaakar hameshaa ke liye apane dak-dibbe main rakhe rah kar badhiya upyog main liya ja saktaa he
 8
 It also supports Atom and RSS feeds that automatically collect the latest news and other data of the Internet in your e-mail
 9
 ji-mail ke jariye kisi bhi computer se kahin se bhi hindi unicode main kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, through an online Unicode editor like browser-based sixteenth, Hindi Unicode can be cut and pasted
 10
 abhi ji-mail kaa beta sanskaran jari kiya gaya he, jo nity prati nikhaar par he
 It is possible that we get more good features in its full version
 ji-mail kii ek khami he ki yah javascript par chalata he at: iske liye aapke mashin main java santhaapit hona aavashyak to he hi aapkaa brouzar java script chalaane laayak hona bhi aavashyak he
 For example in Linux systems for web-based email, you can run it from Mozilla and Firefox, but not from the Konqueror browser, which has some limited support for Java
 parantu yah brouzar kii khami he na ki ji-mail kii
 There is no such problem in Windows systems since almost all new browsers support javascript
 javascript par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran upayokta ko ji-mail ke nae sanskarnon ko alag se downlod karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 jab bhi aap ji-mail kaa upyog karte hai, yah naveenatam sanskaran hi rahata he
 And once the script takes a little time to run initially it becomes extremely fast for later use as it then only downloads the text, which consists of just a few bytes
 ji-mail haalaaki aam upyog ke liye muft jari kiya gaya he, parantu isaki sadsyta ko aamajanon ke liye abhi kholaa nahin gaya he
 For this you must be invited by an existing Gmail user
 haalaaki internet par aise kai site hai jahaan se aapako ji-mail ke account muft main mil jaayenge
 Overall, the G-mail service is a handy tool for Hindi e-mail, which is certain that it will still flourish
